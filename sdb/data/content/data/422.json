W. H.\nMyers, who invited Mrs. Sidgwick to read her paper, \"Results of a\nPersonal Investigation into the Physical Phenomena of SpirituaJism,\nwith some Critical Remarks on the Evidence for the Genuineness of such\nPhenomena.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick explained that by the physical phenomena of\nSpiritualism she meant those which, if correctly described and not due\nto conscious or unconscious trickery, nor to hallucination on the part\nof the observers, exhibit a hitherto unknown force acting in the\nphysical world, otherwise than through the brain or muscles of the\nmedium. They are thus distinguished from the automatic phenomena,\nof which writing by the medium's hand, trance speaking. and table\nturning with contact are examples. The list of physical pheno-\nmena includes raps, movements of tables without contact, ma~\ntiona, psychography, &c.\nShe stated that her own\u00b7 experience in Spiritualism bad begun in\n1874, but had been entirely inconclusive except in cases where it was\nproved that the phenomena were due to the action of the medium.\nShe narrated some of her experiences, including series of seances with\nMrs. Jencken, Mrs. Fay, Miss Wood and Miss Fairlamb, Mr. Bullock,\nMr. Williams, and Dr. Slade, and showed how she had obtained strong\ncircumstantial evidence of deception jn the case of Miss Wood, direct\nproof of jt in that of Mr. Bullock, evidence pointingstrongly to it in the\ncase of Mrs. Fay and Mr. Williams, and good reasons for a.ttributing\nDr. Slade's performances to Conjuring. She concluded the first part\nof her paper with an account of some .nces with Mr. Huby, at which\nDigitized by Google\n\fKaT,I886.1 Journal of &cietU lor P.!\/cAicallle8earcll. 267\nhe was seen himself acting the part of a spirit which professed to\nmaterialise and demateriaJise outside the cabinet.\nIn the second part of her paper Mrs. Sidgwick went on to discuss\nvarious causes of error. She did not believe that hallucination-i.e.,\nperception without objective counterpart, which is an explanation of\nwhat is seen at sh.nces suggested by v. Hartmann and others-bad\never occurred at 8I!ances within her experience ; but she thought the\nerroneous interpretation of what is perceived-a mistaking of what is\ninferred for what is actually seen, was very common. She said that\nfrom what she heard and read, she believed this often occurred in the\nrecognition of friends and relations in the Ie materialised\" forms. She\nadduced a few examples, and gave arguments from the history of spirit-\nphotography pointing to the same conclusion, and also stated that\nit was often too hastily assumed from appearances that the form could\nDOt bethe medium disguised.\nProceeding to conjuring of a less special kind, she said that from\nmany accoun~ of Spiritualistic samces it was obvious that sufficient\nprecautions had not been taken to exclude it, and that in others the\nabsence of any mention of such precautions suggested. that they bad\nnot been taken. But even cases which as described seemed inexplicable,\ncould not prove anything unless a very wide margin for conjuring were\nallowed,since conjuring tricks, as described, were also often inexplicable.\nShe thought the fact that leading Spiritualiata had avowed a belief\nthat certain conjurers were mediums, proved that they underrated the\npossibilities of conjuring. A wide margin not only for conjuring, but\nfor mistakesand mal-observation arising from other causes, was required\nall the more because the evidence was BO seldom experimental-that is,\nthe observer BO seldom knew beforehand what would be the precise\nphenomena and conditions. She thought the arguments used to\nprove that with mediums phenomena were obtained under conditions\nmore unfavourable to trickery than with conjurers, were fallacious,\nand that on the contrary conjurers could only compete on equal\nterms with mediums if they too were allowed to fail whenever they\npleued, and if they too were observed by witnesses doubtful as to the\nJlature of the performance. Sho described BOme experiences in slat&\nWriting which she and friends of hers bad had with an amateur conjurer,\nIIlder the same conditions as Dr. Slade, and which bad seemed at the\ntime inexplicable. These bad been very valuable to her, not only in\nconfirming her view about the wide margin required for conjuring, but\nalso in showing her how very limited were her own powers of\neontinuous observation-a lesson she bad already partially learnt with\nDr. Slade.\nMrs. Sidgwick said that two arguments against the reality of the\nR 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f268 JOflrnal oj'&Ciet!llor P8!1ckical Re&earch. [May, 1886.\nphysical phenomena of Spiritualism gained in force every year. These\nwere (1) the absence of phenomena about which there could be no\nquestion of conjuring, and (2) the fact that almost every medium who\nhad been prominently before the public had been detected in fraud.\nNevertheleas, Mrs. Sidgwick said that she thought there was some\nevidence which could not be neglected, and which formed a primdf~\ncase sufficient to make it our duty to seek for mol'et but she thought.\nit waste of time to seek it with established or professional mediums,\nunder the conditions at present imposed.\nIn conclusion, she urged those who might find in themselves or\ntheir friends the beginnings of .. medi11Dlship,\" to approach the subject\nwith as little prejudice with regard to the conditions under which\nphenomena will occur as poBBible. It is certain that there has been a\ngreat deal of very hasty assumption about these conditions, and as\npreconceived ideas in this matter have, on psychological grounds, &\ntendency to work themselves out, it is important to keep as free as\npossible from any not absolutely true. It is probable that many of\nthe conditions supposed to be necessary, and which complicate and\nincrease the difficulty of the inYestigation, have been invented merely\nto facilitate trickery.\nAt the close of the paper some questions were asked with the view\nof eliciting further details concerning Mrs. Sidgwick's experiences with\nthe conjurer, and Mr. F. W. H. Myers then gave a brief account of\nsome experiments in mesmerism at a distance which he and his\nbrother, Dr. Myers, had recently witnessed in France.\nMr. E. M. Clissold described an experience of his own in mes-\nmerising at a distance; and then, referring to Mrs. Sidgwick's paper,\nsaid that whilst recognising her evident sincerity and h~nesty of\npurpose, he could not but be struck with the meagre results obtained,\nafter so many patient and laborious investigations. He accounted for\nthis by supposing that in this branch of inquiry something more is\nrequired of the investigator than candour and ability. He asserted\nthat in consequence of some want of natural mental or spiritual\npower, a person otherwise adequately endowed might be unable to\nverify a single spiritual phenomenon. He reminded tile audience tbat\nno amount of negative evidence could weaken one fact honestly and\nfairly obtained; and he claimed that there was abundant and ever-\naccumulating evidence in favour of the genuineness of many of the\nalleged tacts.\nMr. Bidder o~iected to the results obtained by Mrs. Sidgwick\nbeing described as of a negative character. In his opinion they were\nvery positive indeed-a.s to impostllre.\nThe meeting then assumed a conversational character.\n\fMay,I886.] Journal 0\/ Societ!l\/or P8!1cAicai &&etJrch. 269\nRIVAL THEORIES AGAIN.\nBy TO HON. RoDEN NOBL.\nA. the Editor permit. me a few more worda on the aubject of my\ncontroveray with Mr. Myen, I .bould like to .y fint that Mr. Myen,\n.though lively and amuaiDg, perhaps permit. himaelf a little too freely to\n,make mere banter do duty for aerioua criticiam. Thia method baa led to\naome grave miarepreaentation (of coone due to miaundentandiDg) of my own\npoaition. Mr. Myen object. atrongly to my uae of the WON\" intuition.\"\nI have uaed, it aeema, the .me term for the ordinary perception of an\nexternal world, and for the inward viaion of Been. Well, I think it ia a very -\naood word for immediate unreuoned knowledge, or belief; and my reading\nof philoaophybaa taught me that it ia 80 undentood byatudenta of pbiloaophy\nin general. I apoke of the viaiona of Been, auch aa St. Tbereaa, St. Catherine,\nSt. John and St. Paul, of their conviction of the objective reality of thoae\nwho had appeared and communicated revelationa to them, urging that\nMr\u2022\u2022yen' phyaiological diagrama, mapping out the brain, with algebraical\nformube appended, did not Beem to explain away aucb a conviction, which I\ncalled an \u2022\u2022 intuition\" on the part of auch great revealen ; to whom, after all,\nwe do owe a few trifting benelite, luch aa Biblea, religiona, and aocial\nreformations. For I argued that if phyaiology doea not explain ordinary\n)Ieftleptiona, no better can it explain abnormal pe1'C8Ptiona. And now Mr.\nMyers 811ure8 me that when I uk him if he thinka phyaiology clbea explain\nperception, I might u well uk him whether he thinka the moon ia made of\ngreen cheeae. Well, I am extremely glad to bave elicited thia cooleaaion\nfrom him, but then I await alao with ,8Ome intereat the aupplementary\ninformation which aeema needed, u to why he makea the diagrama, and\ninvent. the formulAe. Of coune I have no objection. Indeed, it pleaaantly\nreminda me of the School Board, and elementary text-boob.\nBut I admit that, perhaps, Mr. Myen makea \"a hit, a palpable hit,\"\nwhen he cbaffa me about the \" common-aenae of madmen.\" I own that doea\nlOund atartJing! and I am not 80 aore of my right application of thia term\n~ their cue. It appeared to me, however, that it 1t'U applicable to any\n1UlreaIoned and immediate conviotion of the objectivity and extemality\nof any aenaible pe1'C8pt. I argue that dreama (at the time of dreaming) and\nabnormal viaiona have all the p8Jchological oharacteriatica of a normal\n)Ieftlept, and probably the phyaiological alao-.ve, indeed, one, the agree-\nment of waking and normal perceiven. But on that exception I remarked\n(a remark of which Mr. Myen tuea no notice) that theae abnormal aeen\nbeing admittedly in a di1I8rent mental condition or aphere, the agreement\nof normal and waking penona in their pe1'C8ptiona can hardly be expected ;\nyou might aa well wait for the general conaent of blind men to the aeeing of\ncolour, or of dreaming penona before allowing the objective validity of\nnormal waking pe1'C8pt.. Now, I intend theae remarka aerioualy; they are\nnot mere _rtiona; though I can aaaore Mr. Myen I do not wiah to be\ndogmatic; but they are poaitiona which I have uaed argument (bad or' good)\nto maintain, and therefore 1 do not recogniae mere jokea, however lively,\nM a valid an.wer. And really the joke about the madman who believea\nhimaelf the Archangel Michael ia no anawer at all, even aa a reductio ad\nDigitized by Google\n\f270 Journal qf &ciety ffn' P'1lcMetll Raeareh.

But I Buggested that when a madman, or a delirious\npenon, baa what we (from our point of view, and quite conveniently) call and\nmay call \"hallucinations of sense,\" and when a dreamer h88 distinct per-\nception in dreaml, it ia diffioult to prove that whereas our percepta haye\nobjective validity, and are eztenlGZ to our inditridual IMltlU, his are no such\nthing. And for this propoaition I gave reasons (valid or invalid).\nWe do not depend on the agreement of otben for our conviction of au\nobject'B externality,aeeing that, in qmer to consult them,we muat firatfUIIWIU\ntheir extemality to ounelves; though we may modify our impreaioD of tDIw.U\nan object ia by their verdict concerning it, 88 alao by teate, which our 01rll\njudgment may deviae.\nBut I have several Btrings to my bow! Mr. Myen only one to his! The\nstrange \u00abUe\u2022.fizu of madmen I have luggeated (by analogy of the facta re-\noently brought to light in conneotJ.on with meameriam) may with high pro-\nbability be auigned to the domination of ideas impreeaed on them by unseen\nintelligent agenta, perhapa not more neceuari1y evil and malioious than the\nFrench meameriat, who impreeaad on the clairvoyante that Bhe muat shoot;\nher own mother.\nThe dilturbanoe. or abnormal condition of the brain oe1Ia, or of the blood,\nmay very well aceompGny any Buch payohica1 agency ; but I hope we are\nnow agreed that it CICCONnh for nomoretbandoeatheir normalcondition , Mr.\nMyen sayl he does not admit that spirita influence even lOme dreams,\nonly that minda of other penons do.\" But by a\" Bpirit\" I meant\na penon, or indiridual polll8ll88d of a mind; I called him a\" Bpirit,\"\nbecause I BUPpose biB body of flesh and blood ia not concerned in\nBUch dream-influence. Nor did I argue that because BOme dreams are\nthus produced, all must be. 1 only said that the influence of a virtuall;y\ndisembodied Ipirit on dream W88 now proved to be a ftf'CI c\u00abuaa. and\nthat (withou~ prejudice to brain centrea and neneB, &c., which are no\nBufficient cause of dream) hence it became an entertainable hypotb8lil,\nin the absence of a better, thatall dreams might be thua originated; though\nno doubt the ciramatiaing faculty of the a1eeper must aIao be taken into\naccount. After all, recollect that even where we only fancy, invent.\nremember, thil prior sense-perception iaimplied 88 material for reconaVuc-\ntion.by the mind.

I think that here we get BOrne clue,\nhowever, to the puzzling fact that there are degrea of distinct perception,\nthat fancies may gradually paas into perceptiODl, aa lOme of the inatanoes of\nao-called hallucination, collected by our Society, tend to ahow : they do BO in\nthe cue of BOmnambules, and biol<>gised perBODB under dominant suggestion\nfrom without. The degree of subjectivity, and objectivity, may, no doubt,\nhowever, vary in a perception ; that is, the investing, inventing, dramatising\nfacul~ of the individual may contribute more or leaa to the result in any\ngiven case ; a percept may be transferred froin another mind, ready made.\nor the raw materials of it, to be worked up in you, or me. But what I\nsuspect is \"that when it is vividly real and objective, it must be\nalmost equally the aame in another mind, and Mared. At any rate.\nI think there is no suoh self\u00b7sundering in dream as Mr. Myers\nalleges. For hia secondary self is assumed to have a 8Ubjective e:rperience of\nita OWIl, flOt Mared by the primary. But in (I dream that i3 not 30:* the\ndream persona we fancy (if they are not real persona, as I suggest) have\nlikewise no subjectivities of their own ; they are exhausted, I mean, by the\npictures we frame of them, by the replies they make to 1111, or the questions\nthey ask: what is behind that is (mly our Otl1l} comprehetl8ion, and heariflg of\nthat; our ordinary one subjectivi~ is enongh for them, and they have no\nother; this is true o.lBO of the drarrwatil peraonre of a poet. But Mrs.\nNewnham's second self is supposed to hear and digest questions put, and\nthink outthea1lllwers before ahe answers, while Mrs. Newnham's primary\nself writes and reads them. Hamlet is not thinking about the murder of\nhis father unknown to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may imagine such\nthought in the character of Hamlet which he baa conceived ; and the\ndreameronly hears questions put, or remarks made, or questions answered\nby lOme person he imagines; that person is not thinking these out in a sub-\njectivi~ of\" his own (that is, if Mr. Myers' theory of his being only an\ninvention of the sleeper be correct); hence he gets no help for the\naecondary self he wants in the Newnham case from this BOUrce, even though\nmy suggestion be incorrect, that the penonages of a dream\u00b7drama may\nbe distinct individuals. In a dream we retain our own individuality,\nseeing and hearing ourselves, and conversing with other peraons, aa in every-\nday wakiDg hours.\nThe instance of the schoolboy cited in a note by Mr. Myers is,\nof course, familiar to everybody. Truly the answer to a problem flash.\ning on him in the midst of another train of thought, like inspirations of\ngenius, aeema to be from the \u2022\u2022 unconscious.\" But the only question is,\n10hat iI it. real e:eplaMti<m ~ My objection was not to the second term in\nMr. Myers' phrase, \" unconscious ideas,\" but to the first, my position being\ntJuat there is and can be flO \"unconscious\" ; and that the unconscious can no\naore pour\" matured ideas \" into the conscious mind than we can paaa over\n\u2022 Our cbeam pen!OIIIII8II often rep!y to us in a way that we do not expec*, and\nutter ideu that are novel and Il111'naing to us.

The two eldest boys-between\nwhom and myself was a gap of some years, were almost always away from\nhome, and ultimately went abroad, so that from the time I was quite a\nlittle child I was continually with my father, who nlade much of me, and at\nlast I became his constantcompanion.
