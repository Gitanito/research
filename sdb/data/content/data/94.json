Her father died when she was young. Her mother supported the family by running a boarding house for boys at Harrow School. As a young woman, she travelled widely in Europe. In 1867, she married Frank Besant, an evangelical clergyman, and bore two children. The marriage foundered on political differences and her belief in women\u2019s rights; the couple separated in 1873. She returned to London where she became immersed in Fabian socialism, developing a close relationship with one of its leading representatives, George Bernard Shaw. She lectured widely on excessive social control by the Church, notably its repression of women.\n\nIn 1889, WT Stead asked her to review The Secret Doctrine by Helena Blavatsky, the Russian-born co-founder of the Theosophical Society (TS). During the following years she became prominent in Indian politics and the Theosophical movement, and in 1893 she represented the TS at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. In 1907, she succeeded Colonel Olcott as international president of the TS, residing mainly at its headquarters in Adyar, Madras. She died there in 1933.  Hodgson Report\n\nIn 1884, the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) appointed a committee to investigate claims of s\u00e9ance-type phenomena by affiliates of the TS, notably those that concerned Blavatsky. The SPR commissioned Richard Hodgson, an Australian-born Cambridge graduate to travel to India to investigate the events. His subsequent report claimed the phenomena was produced fraudulently.1 Hodgson concluded:  \n\nWe regard her [Blavatsky] neither as the mouthpiece of hidden seers, nor as a mere vulgar adventuress; we think that she has achieved a title to permanent remembrance as one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting imposters in history.2\n\nIn a scathing rejoinder, Besant denounced Hodgson as \u2018foolish and prejudiced\u2019, and accused the SPR of harbouring a \u2018child-like trust\u2019 in the honesty and capability of its members. She argued that Blavatsky was incapable of \u2018carrying out an elaborate and prolonged system of fraud\u2019, being by nature \u2018hasty, impulsive, unconventional [and] careless of appearance\u2019.3 &nbsp;Hodgson countered by accusing her of \u2018ignorance\u2019 and \u2018absurdity\u2019.4  Psychic Research Activities\n\nIn 1907, Besant founded a rival organization in London named the International Club for Psychical Research (ICPR), which attracted occultists, spiritualists and theosophists.5 In 1911 it was thought to have six hundred members.6 The International Psychic Gazette, a monthly periodical, was started in 1912 as its official journal, but ceased publication after a few months.\n\nIn her talks and writings, Besant encouraged the development of psychic faculties, as long as this was undertaken with appropriate spiritual preparation.7 Examples of her own claimed experiences are described by Kurt Leland in Invisible Worlds: Annie Besant on Psychic and Spiritual Development (2014).\n\nIn Occult Chemistry (1908), Besant describes clairvoyant visions shared with Charles Leadbeater of the anatomical structure of elements, which she said they achieved by entering an altered state of conscious that enabled them to slow down of the movement of particles, thereby allowing them to see the nature of atoms in their natural state.8\n\nSPR researchers acknowledged that Besant may have had genuine psychic experiences, but objected that her tendency to take them at \u2018their most superficial face value\u2019 with \u2018utter disregard of any rules of evidence or canons of criticism\u2019 limited their value in scientific terms.9  Works\n\nFor a detailed list of Besant\u2019s works see here.\n\nFor a detailed list of Besant\u2019s articles see here.\n\nFor a detailed list of Besant\u2019s editorials see here.
