Organ of the dominant American spiritualist organization, the National Spiritualists Association of Churches.  Beginning in 1938 this was published in Cassadaga, Florida, then after 1979 in Indianapolis, Indiana, and currently in Phoenix, Arizona.  The journal mirrors the fortunes of spiritualism as a movement over almost a century.  The journal's content reflects the progression of the movement, already well under way when the journal  began, from the vehicle for making known to the world the wonderful reality of communications from beyond the grave, to an inner-directed house-organ for a religious sect.  The journal's lists of lecturers, mediums, churches and associations provide an invaluable resource for the study of spiritualism in the period.
