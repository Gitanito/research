He was born 24 March 1874 in Budapest, according to his birth certificate; however, he later claimed he was conceived in Budapest and born in Appleton, Wisconsin, USA. His father, a rabbi, brought the family from Hungary to America. His stage name was derived from the French magician Jean-Eugene Robert-Houdin.1\n\nHoudini became a trapeze performer at an early age, then performed in vaudeville shows after his family moved to New York City. From about 1900 he began to gain fame as an escape artist, combining great physical strength and agility with lock-picking skills. For instance, he was able to extricate himself from chains and shackles in a water-filled box suspended upside-down far above ground.\n\nHoudini died on 31 October 1926 of peritonitis following acute appendicitis, which was possibly caused by multiple blows to his abdomen taken as part of a performance in the preceding days.2  Exposing Spiritualism\n\nIn his book A Magician Among the Spirits (1924) Houdini states that he was always interested in spiritualism and that in his early career he held fake sittings. He was aware that he was deceiving his clients but considered it \u2018a lark\u2019. Later, following a bereavement, he wrote, \u2018I was chagrined that I should ever have been guilty of such frivolity and for the first time realized that it bordered on crime\u2019.3\n\nHoudini was convinced that spirits could not manifest in the physical world, based on many associates having promised him they\u2019d send him a signal from beyond after their deaths, but none doing so. He noted that grieving people would desperately seize on any evidence, making them easily susceptible to fraud. \u2018I have watched this great wave of Spiritualism sweep the world in recent months,\u2019 he writes, \u2018and realized that it has taken such a hold on persons of a neurotic temperament, especially those suffering from bereavement, that it has become a menace to health and sanity\u2019.4 Houdini claimed to have attended hundreds of sittings and read all spiritualist literature extant at the time.\n\nIn A&nbsp;Magician Among the Spirits, Houdini discusses techniques for fraudulently producing messages via slates, raps, table levitation and spirit photographs. He devotes a chapter to ectoplasm, concentrating on the medium Marthe B\u00e9raud (Eva C); his opinion was that the purportedly-spiritual substance was produced by mediums using illusionists\u2019 techniques similar to those used in his own frequently-performed \u2018Hindoo needle trick\u2019, in which he would apparently swallow as many as 200 needles and a great length of thread, then regurgitate the needles, all threaded.\n\nFig 1: To demonstrate the use of double exposure to create fake \u2018spirit photographs\u2019, Houdini had himself photographed with the apparent ghost of Abraham Lincoln.5\n\nAnother chapter describes crimes involving spiritualism culled from newspaper reports, such as wealthy widows being told by \u2018spirits\u2019 to leave their fortunes to mediums. In one episode, he describes a man murdering two of his sons in the belief that his dead wife had communicated asking him to send her children to her. Houdini also blamed the 1881 assassination of US president James Garfield on spiritualism, alleging that the assassin claimed to have been inspired by spirits.  Mina \u2018Margery\u2019 Crandon\n\nIn the same year as the publication of A Magician Among the Spirits, Houdini published a short book6 in which he claimed to have exposed the American medium Mina Crandon, known as Margery. She had accepted a challenge&nbsp;by the magazine&nbsp;Scientific American, which&nbsp;offered a prize of $2,500 to any medium who could convince a committee of investigators of the genuineness of his or her gifts. The committee was composed of William McDougall, Daniel F Comstock, Walter Franklin Prince, Hereward Carrington and Houdini.\n\nHoudini participated in a sitting in which \u2018spirits\u2019 rang an electric bell contained in a box. He sat to Margery\u2019s left, holding her hand, his calf touching hers, and in this position claimed he felt her use her foot to operate the box. At a second sitting he attributed a table levitation to the medium leveraging it with her head. He then persuaded the medium to sit in a cabinet of his devising; a collapsible ruler was later found there which he claimed she used to operate the bell box. She in turn accused him of having placed there himself.\n\nFig 2: Illustration from A Magician Among the Spirits. Margery is pictured in the centre, Houdini on the right (her left). According to him, even while their calves touch, she is able to operate the bell-box with her foot7.  Criticisms\n\nAn unattributed review of A Magician Among the Spirits in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research notes that two pages of errata and addendum had been added to the book, and adds that a further two pages could easily have been compiled, as the text was riddled with misspellings and factual errors.8 For instance, Houdini attributed exposes of mediums to investigators who in fact never met with them. The review also takes issue with Houdini\u2019s claim that an (unnamed) English doctor estimated that spiritualism had caused a million cases of insanity.9\n\nHoudini carried on a friendly relationship for some years with the author Arthur Conan Doyle, a devout spiritualist, despite their diametrically-opposed views. Eventually the two became disillusioned with each other, however. Doyle wrote, \u2018The unmasking of false mediums is our urgent duty, but when we are told that, in spite of our own evidence and that of three generations of mankind, there are no real ones, we lose interest, for we know that we are speaking to an ignorant man\u2019.10 Doyle attributed Houdini\u2019s stance in part to a desire for publicity, as the public had a keen interest in spiritualism.\n\nDoyle also offered a different version of what happened at the \u2018exposure\u2019 of Margery, based, by his own account, on notes taken at the sittings. At the first sitting, the entranced medium\u2019s \u2018control\u2019, named Walter, suddenly cried \u2018You have put something to stop the bell ringing, Houdini, you\u2014!\u2019 Lights were raised and the rubber from the end of a pencil was found stuck in the angle of the bell-box\u2019s wooden flap. Doyle argued that only Houdini had a deft enough touch to place it, and noted that this had never occurred when the magician was not present.\n\nDoyle\u2019s account of the ruler in the cabinet matches Houdini\u2019s but adds an observation by another sitter that Houdini was seen \u2018without any apparent reason to pass his hand along the lady\u2019s arm, and so into the box\u2019, presumably to place the folding ruler inside.\n\nHoudini maintained unwaveringly that his illusions and escapes were all accomplished through normal magicians\u2019 methods. However, according to Doyle, Houdini once told him that \u2018a voice which was independent of his own reason or judgment told him what to do and how to do it\u2019, apparently ensuring his safety. Once when he jumped without waiting for word from the voice he almost broke his neck. \u2018This was the nearest admission that I ever had from him that I was right in thinking that there was a psychic element which was essential to every one of his feats,\u2019 Doyle wrote.\n\nKM Wehrstein  Literature\n\nAmerican Memory (n.d.).
