JAN., 1905.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nTHE 69th Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover\nSquare, W., on Monday, December 5th, 1904, at 3 p.m.; the\nPresident, Professor Barrett, in the chair. There were also\npresent : Mr. W. W. Baggally, the Hon. E. Feilding, Sir Law\nrence Jones, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr. F.\nPodmore, Mr. A. F. Shand, Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Mr. H. Arthur\nSmith, Lieut-Colonel Le M. Taylor, Mrs. A. W. Verrall, and\nMiss Alice Johnson, Secretary.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as\ncorrect.\nFive new Members and nineteen new Associates were\nelected. The election of two new Members and thirty-one\nnew Associates of the American Branch was recorded. The\nnames and addresses are given above.\nThe monthly account for October was presented and taken\nas read.\nAfter discussing other business, the Council adjourned.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nTHE tenth of the series of Private Meetings for Members and\nAssociates only was held in the large hall at 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W., on Monday, December 5th, at 4 p.m. ;\nthe President, Professor Barrett, in the chair.\nTHE PEESIDENT informed the meeting that the Council had\ninvited Professor Charles Richet to be President of the Society\nfor the year 1905, and that Professor Richet had accepted\nthe invitation. The President also announced the receipt of\ntwo further contributions to the Endowment Fund, viz., \u00a32 2s.\nfrom Miss A. E. Bell, and \u00a31 19s. from a Member of the\nSociety who wished to remain anonymous.\nLIEUT.-COLONEL LE M. TAYLOR then read a paper, illus\ntrated by diagrams, on \" Various Spiritualistic Phenomena\nwitnessed by the Author.\" He divided the phenomena into\nthree classes : (1) psychical phenomena, involving no inter\nference with physical laws as accepted by science; (2)\nphysical phenomena, such as the spontaneous movement of\n\fJAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 5\nmaterial inanimate objects, \" spirit-lights,\" or \"materialisations\";\n(3) cases in which a purposive human-like intelligence is\nmanifested in connection with abnormal physical phenomena.\nHe then gave instances of each class. In the first case\nquoted, at a sitting held at the house of a lady whom he\nknew well, the medium being her servant, two chairs on\nwhich the medium and a lady by her were seated moved\naway from the table with the sitters on them, and continued\nto move when the sitters got up and returned to the table,\ntill they rested at points from 4 to 8 feet from the table.\nThe chairs then moved back towards the table without any\napparent contact. A chair in the middle of the room, with no\none near it, also moved and fell down.\nIn the second case, at a sitting held with \" Mrs. Marriott,\"\nColonel Taylor saw a \" spirit-light,\" like the flame of a candle,\non the table near him, and put out his hand to catch it.\nWhen his fingers had nearly closed round it, it slipped out\nbetween them, floated away, and disappeared.\nIn the third case, during supper after a sitting with \" Mrs.\nMarriott,\" who sat by Colonel Taylor at supper, knocks were\nheard in various parts of the room and on his chair. He\nthen pushed his chair away from the table, so as to leave a\nclear space round it, after which he both heard and felt raps\non various parts of it. By means of these raps the replies\n\" yes \" or \" no \" to both mental and spoken questions of\nhis were obtained, and thus some intelligence was manifested.\nIn the fourth case, at a sitting held at his own house\nwith two friends of his own, whom he called Mrs. and Miss\nHope, a table with books on it was placed behind the medium,\nMiss Hope, and another table with a zither on it behind the\nfirst. Eaps then occurred on both these tables and on the\nwood of the zither, but not in any case on its strings.\nSome of the raps were heard on the places where the sitters\nasked that they should sound, and some answered questions.\nThe two last cases were of the psychical class. The first\nof these occurred at a sitting held with the medium \"Walters.\"\nThe medium became entranced, and one of his \" controls \"\ngave a fairly good description of Colonel Taylor's wife.\nAnother \" control \" then stated that Colonel Taylor had two\npictures of her, on glass, in a box, and described the picture\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905.\nand the dress and attitude of the sitter in detail. None of\nthe persons present, besides Colonel Taylor himself, had ever\nknown his wife, who had died sixteen years previously. He\ncould not at the time think of any picture on glass in his\npossession, but a week later remembered that he had taken a\nphotograph of his wife on glass, and with some difficulty\nsucceeded in finding it, as well as the original negative ; and\nhe then found that it corresponded closely with the description\ngiven by the medium.\nIn the last case, at a sitting held in Colonel Taylor's house\nat Cheltenham a \" control,\" purporting to be his wife, made\na remark about her sister in Canada which seemed a very\nappropriate reference to an incident that had taken place the\nnight before, of which none of the sitters knew anything at\nthe time.\nFull details of all these cases are given in Colonel Taylor's\npaper, which it is hoped will be published later.\nTHE PRESIDENT then gave a brief account of several cases\nwhiV.i had come under his own notice some time ago and\nhad been recorded by himself at the time. In the first case,\nhe had had a large number of sittings in 1875 with some\nfriends of his own, Mr. and Mrs. C., and their young\ndaughter, who appeared to be the medium. The sittings were\nheld generally in the morning and in full daylight, so that it\nwas possible for him to watch closely the feet and hands of\nthe sitters. The phenomena consisted chiefly of raps, which\nwere heard sometimes on the table and sometimes on the\nchairs of the sitters, and once on a table near the medium\nbut not in contact with her. The raps manifested intelligence,\nwords being spelt out through them, but it was interesting\nto observe that the intelligence never seemed superior to that\nof the medium. Thus, one day a word was misspelt by the\nraps, just as the child herself would have misspelt it, as he\nafterwards ascertained. The phenomena occurred equally well\nwhen no one was present except the child and himself. The\nlifting of a heavy dining-room table also occurred under\nthese circumstances, the tips of the fingers only resting on\nthe table.\nIn a second case, which he had observed in 1877, the\nmedium was a Miss I. In this case, at a sitting held in\n\fJAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates 7\nthe evening with one gaslight burning in the room, and there\nfore plenty of light, raps were also obtained on the table,\nboth with and without contact of the hands of the sitters\nwith the table, and these raps also showed intelligence. At\nthe same sitting movements of the table, without any contact\nwhatever, were obtained. The sitters lifted their hands off\nthe table and sat back in their chairs with their arms folded,\ntheir feet being in full view. The table then raised two of\nits legs completely off the ground some 8 or 10 inches, and\nthus suspended itself for a few moments. It then did the\nsame with the other two legs. While remaining free from\ncontact with the sitters, the table then moved backwards and\nforwards, advanced towards Professor Barrett and rose up close\nto him. Similar phenomena occurred at a sitting in his\nown house when Miss I. and he alone were present and\nwith abundant light in the room. The medium was not paid\nand gave the sittings at considerable inconvenience to herself.\nThe third case occurred with the well-known professional\nmedium, Mr. Eglinton, at the house of Mr. Hensleigh Wedg\nwood in 1878. To this, of course, he (the speaker) attached\nless importance on account of the grave suspicion which after\nwards fell upon Eglinton in connection with his slate-writing\nperformances. Nevertheless, in justice to Eglinton, it ought to\nbe said that at this particular seance in Mr. Wedgwood's house\n\u2022every precaution which experience had up till then taught was\nresorted to, both by the speaker and by Mr. Myers, who was\nalso present, to prevent the possibility of trickery. Not only\nwere Eglinton's arms tied securely behind him and to a book\ncase behind, but the curtains which were drawn across his\nbody when he was seated in a chair were left open in the\ncentre, so that the middle of his body could be seen. Books\nwere then placed in a pile on his lap and a small hand\nbell on the top. Sufficient light was left in the room to\nread the second hand of a watch. The sitters then saw the\nleaves of the middle book opened and other movements occur\nwithout any visible motion on the part of the medium, and\nthe fastenings were intact when examined afterwards. A\ndescription of the whole sitting, taken from notes made at the\ntime, is given in the Proceedings S. P. R., Vol. IV., p. 36. The\nspeaker begged to draw the attention of the members to the\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905.\nfull account of these three cases which he gave in his paper pub\nlished in that volume of the Proceedings.\nHe also described another case of remarkable physical\nphenomena which occurred in a hotel in Edinburgh, witnessed\nby General and Mrs. Boldero, the medium being a lady\nfriend of Mrs. Boldero's, and the conditions and occurrences\nhaving been carefully noted at the time. Finally he referred\nto the case of D. D. Home, through whose mediumship amazing\nphysical phenomena were obtained under circumstances which,\nin his opinion, rendered fraud inconceivable. He especially\nrecommended for study the case recorded in the Journal\nS. P. E., Vol. IV., p. 124 et. seq., given in an appendix to a\npaper on Home which he (the speaker) had written in con\njunction with Mr. Myers.\nVarious hypotheses had been suggested to account for these\nextraordinary phenomena. Long ago he had been inclined to\nthink that some hallucination on the part of the sitters, or\nsome hypnotised state on their part, would account for what\nwas observed,\u2014the medium suggesting what was supposed to\ntake place and the sitters then thinking they saw it and sub\nsequently describing it as having actually occurred. In fact,\nnumerous experiments made by himself on suggestible subjects\nsupported this conclusion, which he had ventured publicly to\nadvocate nearly thirty years ago. But in the cases above cited\nand in others, this theory had been kept in view and found\nin his opinion to be hopelessly inadequate, and he now un\nhesitatingly abandoned it, though as a possible vera causa it\nought to be remembered and guarded against. Another theory\nwas mal-observation on the part of the sitters. This un\ndoubtedly was a source of frequent error, as shown in Mr.\nDavey's remarkable experiments recorded on p. 405 et seq. of\nthe Proceedings, Vol. IV. Again, as Mrs. Sidgwick showed\nin the paper which she contributed to the same volume of\nthe Proceedings, erroneous interpretation,\u2014which arises from con\nfusing what is observed with what is inferred\u2014the failure\nto distinguish between facts and inferences from facts,\u2014is very\ncommon at stances. To this all of us are specially liable when\nthe sitting is carried on in darkness or in a dim light.\nNotwithstanding the weight which properly attaches to these\nand other explanations that have been given of spiritualistic\n\fJAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 9\nphenomena, the speaker had been led to abandon them as in\nadequate to account for all that took place, and he had been\ndriven to the conclusion that intelligent, self-determined, and\napparently self-conscious agencies existed in the unseen\u2014in a\nword, unseen personalities\u2014which could, in some manner utterly\nunknown to us, operate on material objects, and also on the sub\nconscious self of the so-called medium. Beyond this he was\nnot at present prepared to go, though the evidence of identity\nwas growing in value.\nIn the course of the discussion that followed, DR. J. H.\nGOWEK described some experiences of his own in a private\ncircle of his friends at Denver, Colorado, where he had held a\nnumber of sittings for physical phenomena in 1902 and 1903.\nThey had often obtained raps, both with and without contact,\nand intelligible messages spelt out thereby, and they also\nobtained on several occasions movements of a heavy table\nwithout contact with any of the sitters and in a good light.\nOn one occasion, an extension table on a central pedestal,\nwhich divided when the table was extended, moved by itself,\nleaving a space of about 8 inches between its two parts, and\non being requested to close again, began to do so without\nany one touching it, but stopped when it was about half\nclosed. The sitters then placed their fingers upon the edge\nof it, and it then closed completely. On the same occasion,\nthe sitters requested that various liquids on the table should\nbe shaken by the force ; for instance, the water in a water\njug, and the whiskey in a bottle. Each of these shook\nsuccessively in response to the request, and without being\ntouched in any way by the sitters. When standing at a\ndistance from the table, the sitters also requested that a\npencil on it should be moved backwards and forwards. This\nwas done, and on one occasion the pencil rolled off the table.\nMJ:. W. W. BAGGALLY described some experiences in slate\nwriting with the medium Eglinton in full day light on a\nsummer's afternoon.\nDuring the sitting Eglinton called the attention of Mr.\nBaggally to some spirit photographs which lay on the table,\nwhen the position of the photographs necessitated the turning\naway of the sitter's head from the side where the medium sat.\nThis did not, however, prevent Mr. Baggally from watching\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905\nEglinton, as by bending his head at the time of pretending\nto examine the photographs he was able to have a slanting\nlook at the medium's movements. Mr. Baggally saw Eglinton\ndeliberately read a private question addressed to the spirits,\nwhich Mr. Baggally had written on a slate. This was at the\ncommencement of the sitting. A suspicious circumstance, also,\nwas that Eglinton several times said \" the spirits are pulling\nthe slate.\" When making use of this expression, the medium's\nhand which held the slate disappeared under the table.\nMr. Baggally concluded that the writing had been done\nby means of a small slate pencil, which either was attached\nto a prepared thimble or held under the nail of one of the\nmedium's fingers. The writing would be on the under sur\nface of the slate, at the end nearest to the medium's body ;\nand when he said \" the spirits are pulling \" and his hand\ndisappeared, it was in order to enable him to reverse the\nslate, so that the writing would then appear on the upper\nsurface, at the end farthest away from the medium. Mr.\nBaggally obtained a good deal of writing, but always in this\nposition. The sound of writing which was subsequently heard\ncould have been produced by scratching the surface of the\nslate with a finger nail.\nMr. Baggally said that he had also witnessed a heavy dining-\nroom chair move towards him, without contact, in the presence\nof Eglinton\u2014in broad daylight\u2014but thought it possible that\nthe chair legs had iron bars in them, and that the movement\nwas caused by a powerful electro-magnet beneath the floor of\nthe room, worked by a confederate, since the performance took\nplace at Eglinton's own house, and he would have had every\nopportunity of preparing a space below the floor in which a\nconfederate could place a magnet. Eglinton himself, previous\nto this experiment, moved the chair from the side of the room\nand placed it in the middle on a spot which might have been\npreviously known to a confederate. Mr. Baggally, however,\nadmitted that some things that he had witnessed in Eglinton's\npresence appeared inexplicable.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE, in reference to Mr. Baggally's suggestion\nthat Eglinton might have moved the chair by means of an\nelectro-magnet, said that this would certainly be possible if\niron bars had been concealed in the legs, and if the magnet\n\fJAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Me-mbers and Associates. 11\ncould have been brought up close under the floor ; but mani\nfestly far simpler appliances could be devised for the purpose\n\u2022of producing apparently abnormal movements. No such expla\nnation could be applied to the cases described by the President,\nsince in them the mediums had no opportunity of preparing\napparatus beforehand ; and the fact that a Physicist had\nobserved them made them specially important. Supposing\nthat occurrences of this kind ever became well-established\nand accepted by science, they need not involve any revolu\ntion in scientific theories of matter, though they would lead\nto an extension of our knowledge of human faculty. Even\nnow we are entirely ignorant as to how by exerting our\nwills we are able to move material objects,\u2014even our own\nbodies, and through them objects in contact with them.\nTo be able to move objects without contact is not a priori\nmore improbable, since it is difficult to form any clear concep\ntion of what is meant by \" contact \" between mind and\nmatter. The difficulty of believing the asserted occurrences\narises from the fact that there is such comparatively scanty\nevidence for their occurrence ; though it must be admitted\nthat the evidence is continually growing both in amount and\nimpressiveness.\nWith regard to the medium Eglinton, he had once had\na series of sittings for slate writing with him, arranged for\nby the late Edmund Gurney, once in the company of Balfour\nStewart, once with Mr. C. C. Massey, and many times with\nMr. Gurney. At the first sitting, though he took his own\nslate, he for the most part simply attempted to observe\nwhat happened\u2014not to impose any test conditions\u2014and one\nword of writing was obtained. At the remainder of the\nsittings, he attached the slate by a piece of string to one\nof his fingers before entering the house, and kept it attached\ntill he left ; under these circumstances a single letter of the\nalphabet was all the writing he ever obtained.\nOPENING OF AN ENVELOPE CONTAINING A POST\nHUMOUS NOTE LEFT BY MR. MYEES.\nON December 13th, 1904, Sir Oliver Lodge invited the\nMembers of the Council and a few other Members of the\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905.\nSociety to the Society's Rooms at 20 Hanover Square to\nwitness the opening of a sealed envelope which had been\nsent to him by Mr. Myers in January 1891 (nearly four\nteen years ago), in the hope that after his death its contents\nmight be given by communication through some medium.\nIt had been decided to open it because various statements\nmade in Mrs. Verrall's automatic script during the last three\nyears had led her to infer that it contained a certain phrase.\nThe apparent references to this posthumous note had begun\nvaguely, and gradually developed, with some repetition, into\nwhat seemed to be a clear and definite statement of what\nwas contained in Sir Oliver Lodge's envelope. The references\nto the envelope purported to come from Mr. Myers, and were\nmixed up with writing, some of which appeared to be veridical,\nrelating to other topics, especially with a statement\u2014written\nbefore the publication of Human Personality\u2014that a certain pas\nsage would be found in that book when published. This having\nbeen verified, it was hoped that the account given by the script\nof the contents of the envelope might turn out equally correct.\nThe meeting was summoned by a circular, of which the\nannexed is a copy :\nMARIEMONT, EDGBASTON, December, 1904.\nIt is probably known to you that some years ago F. W. H.\nMyers deposited with me an envelope containing some sort of writ\ning or message, to be posthumously deciphered if possible.\nIt is also known to 3'ou that Mrs. Verrall developed the faculty\nof automatic writing soon after Myers' death. It now appears that\nshe believes herself to have received messages or indications as to\nthe contents of this envelope. This impression of hers may, of\ncourse, be mistaken, but the advantage of it is that it is definite,\nand she is able to put into writing what she thinks the contents of\nthe envelope will be found to be.\nThat being so, I have taken advice, and find a general consensus\nof opinion that it is time now to open the envelope and verify or\ndisprove the agreement ; or, if there is partial agreement, to\nascertain its amount.\nThe envelope has been for some time deposited in a bank, but I\npropose to have it handed back to me some time this week, and to\nbring it up to London on Tuesday, December 13th, and then, at\n4 p.m., in the rooms of the Society for Psychical Eesearch, 20\n\fJAN., 1905. Posthumous Note left by Mr. Myers. 13\nHanover Square, after making a statement regarding it and reading\nMrs. Verrall's statement of what she believes to be in it, to open\nit in the presence of a sufficient number of witnesses. I do not\npropose to do it at a Council meeting, because I think it desirable\nthat one or two outsiders should be present, inasmuch as I wish\nthe event to be known and \"counted,\" whether it turn out suc\ncessful or the reverse. The only way to avoid chance coincidence\nis to determine beforehand whether any given event shall \" count \"\nor not; and, subject to anything that may happen between now\nand then, I propose that this shall count and that the envelope\nshall then be opened.\nI invite you, therefore, if you think fit, to come to the rooms of\nthe Society on Tuesday, December 13th, at 4 p.m.\nIt must be understood that the proceedings are confidential, and\nthat the question of subsequent publication must be reserved for\nthe Council of the Society. OLIVER LODGE.\nMrs. Verrall first reported to the meeting the conclusions\nshe had been led to form concerning the envelope from her\nown script, and read the apparently relevant passages. On\nthe envelope being opened, however, it was found that there\nwas no resemblance between its actual contents and what was\nalleged by the script to be contained in it.\nIt has, then, to be reported that this one experiment has\ncompletely failed, and it cannot be denied that the failure is\ndisappointing. Considering, however, how very few experi\nments of this kind have ever, so far as we know, been tried\nat all, and how great, on any hypothesis, must be the\nobstacles to . success, it would be unreasonable either to\nrelax our efforts on account of this single failure or because\nof it unduly to discount the other matter contained in Mrs.\nVerrall's script which there is any reason to regard as evi\ndential. It is hoped that a detailed report of the script will\nbe published before long.\nMeanwhile, the Council have reason to believe that there\nmay be several other persons in possession of sealed envelopes\nleft by Mr. Myers before his death for their contents to be\ndeciphered, if possible, afterwards.

Auditory.\nTHE following case of an apparently telepathic impression\ncomes from an Associate of the Society, Mr. Clissold, and\nwas sent to us, enclosed in a letter dated September 20th,\n1904, by Colonel Taylor, to whom Mr. Clissold and his\ndaughter have been known for some years.\nMr. Clissold writes :\nRAVENSWORTH, CHELTENHAM,\nSeptember Uth, 1904.\nOn Saturday, September 10th, I was in my daughter's garden\npruning some trees. I had just completed my work about 7 p.m.\nwhen I distinctly heard my daughter's voice calling me, \"\nwhen are you coming down ? \" using a familiar name by which no\none but she addresses me. I looked all round me and could see no\none, so I called to her several times, but receiving no answer\nsupposed that she had called me and then gone home.\nHowever, when I got to the bottom of the garden, a distance\nof about 40 yards from where I was pruning, I found her at work\namong her flowers, and on asking her why she had called me,\nshe said \" I never called you at all, but I was thinking of you\nvery much a short time ago and thought I must call you, but I\ndid not.\" It is perfectly certain that I heard her voice distinctly,\nand it is equally certain that my daughter did not call me. I\nwrite this simple account as it may be possible that other people\nmay have met with occurrences of a similar nature. Is it within\nthe bounds of probability that thought can, under certain conditions,\nbe transferred into audible sound 1 E. M. CLISSOLD.\nMr. Clissold's daughter writes :\nEOCK HOUSE, FOWNHOPE, HEREFORD.\nON Saturday, September 10th, I was tying up chrysanthemums\nnear our house and father was pruning trees about 40 yards from\nwhere I was working, but out of sight. I kept on thinking I would\ncall him to come down, as he had not been well in the morning,\nand I was afraid he would be over tired, but I knew he hated to\nbe worried. For about half an hour I thought of nothing else but\nwhether I should call him or not, and suddenly I saw him just\n\fJAN., 1905. Case. 15\nabove me, and he said, \"Why did. you call me?\" I said \"I did\nnot call you, but for some time I have been thinking of doing\nso.\" If I had called him, I should not have made use of the\nfamiliar name he said I used, as I knew the gardener was working\nclose by. My husband went up since, and stood listening at the\nexact spot where my father stood. I called as loud as I could to\nhim from the spot where I was working when my father heard\nme call him, and he could only hear me faintly; he was expecting\nit and listening for the call. My father was pruning at the time\nand not expecting to be called, and he is also a little deaf. I\nenclose a section of the ground showing our positions and the\nintervening features of the ground. ALICE PURDON.\nThe section referred to shows a number of terraces, rising\none above another, terminated by walls covered with ivy,\nbetween Mr. Clissold and his daughter. Mr. Clissold was at\nthe far end of the highest terrace, and his daughter on the\nlowest, at a level of 38 feet below where he was standing,\nand at a distance of 124 feet measured horizontally from a\npoint 38 feet vertically below him. Supposing, therefore, that\nshe had unconsciously uttered her thought aloud, it seems quite\nimpossible that he should have heard it.\nME. F. 0.

Collective Vision.\nTHE following case was sent to us by an Associate of the\nSociety, Mrs. H. J. Wilson, of 12 Cheyne Court, Chelsea,\nLondon, S.W., who is intimately acquainted with all the\nwitnesses. We are requested to print their initials only, but\nthe full names have been given to us. Mrs. C., the medium\nmentioned, is not a professional medium, but a friend of the\nother ladies.\nThe incident took place in May, 1904, and the first account\nwe give is copied from a letter written shortly afterwards by\nMrs. A. to Mrs. Wilson, as follows :\nIt was in my bedroom at B , Switzerland. Mrs. C was\nthe medium. She was seated facing the long mirror in my ward\nrobe, and we, that is C. [Mrs. P., sister of Mrs. A.]. A. [the\ndaughter of Mrs. A.], Mrs. H., and myself, were seated just be\nhind her, also facing the mirror. Mrs. C was not in trance.\nIn a very short time we saw my father's face form over Mrs. C.'s\nface (in the mirror), and then S 's face, two or three times fol\nlowing. She was smiling and looking hard at us, her two sisters.\nThen she faded away, and a long corridor came, with a large hall\nor room at the end of it, brilliantly lighted up. Many figures were\nwalking about, but my figure and E.'s [Mrs. A.'s son] were the\nmost prominent\u2014there was no mistaking them. I recognised my\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1905.\nown figure walking about, and leaning forward to talk. That was\nall, as it was rather late, and time to go to bed.\nS., the sister of Mrs. A. and Mrs. P., had died in March,\n1904; E., the son of Mrs. A., was living at the time, and\nin London.\nThe account of the other sister, Mrs. P., was dictated by\nher to Mrs. Wilson, and sent to us enclosed in a letter\nfrom Mrs. Wilson, dated October 3rd, 1904. It is as follows:\nIt was at B , about May 1st, 1904, at 8.30 p.m. The elec\ntric light was full on all the time, shaded only by a piece of silver\ntissue paper. There were present Mrs. C (the medium), Mrs.\nA , A., Mrs. H , and myself. Mrs. C. sat in front of a mirror,\nMrs. A. and I sat just behind her, and the other two to right and\nleft of us respectively. Behind us was the bedroom wall, and a\nwashing stand against that, with a small mirror over it. The\nmedium was not entranced. I saw S 's face form on Mrs.\nC 's face, followed by that of old Mrs. P . Then came a\nfull-length figure of my father in the mirror, in his robes, very like\nthe portrait. He looked benignant and rested, with lines of face\nmuch smoothed away. This faded, and then all perceived a long pas\nsage in the mirror, at a guess about 25 feet long, with bay window\nat the end, and sunshine streaming through. There was a window\nseat, and two figures standing by it, unrecognisable. Then third\nfigure appeared, also unrecognisable. They seemed to look out of\nwindow and converse. Medium then became tired.\nThe next account, written in October, 1904, is from Miss.\nA., and is as follows :\nMother, Mrs. C , Aunt C [Mrs. P.], another lady, and\nmyself, were all seated in front of a large pier glass, Mrs. C\n(the medium) being slightly nearer the glass (say 3 inches) than the\nrest of us. The gas was turned down to about half its strength.\nPresently, after sitting ten minutes or so, we saw what appeared to\nbe a white mist rising up in front of the medium's reflection, and it\nfinally resolved into a good and distinct likeness of Grandad. When\nwe recognised it the figure smiled and nodded its head. Then a\nlikeness of Aunt S appeared, not so distinct, but perfectly easy\nof recognition, after which a lady appeared unknown to four of us,\nbut recognised by the lady who was sitting with us.\nFor a time we saw nothing but mist again, but it gradually\ncleared, and a long corridor became visible with a door at the further\n\fFEB., 1905. Cases. 19\nend evidently opened inwards, and screened on the side nearest us\nby looped curtains, through which we saw into a brilliantly lighted\nroom, whether bright sunlight or artificial light we could not tell.\nFigures too distant to be recognised came and went in the room,\nand once a girl in what appeared to be bridal dress stood just be\nhind the opening of the curtain. Then the doors appeared to be\nshut for a time, but presently opened, and two figures pushed aside\nthe curtains and came down the corridor towards us, talking. We\nrecognised them as Mother and E . Then the picture faded\nagain, and we closed the sitting. This is to the best of my recol\nlection, but as I took no notes at the time, I may easily have for\ngotten details.\nIn answer to further questions Miss A. writes :\nOctober Uth, 1904.\nThe likenesses were formed on Mrs. C 's image in the glass,\nas it were, transforming her features into those of the persons re\npresented. Her own face, as distinct from the image, was unchanged,\nexcept that the eyes were closed, while the faces in the glass all\nhad their eyes open. This is an interesting point, I think.\nThe fourth witness, Mrs. H., dictated her account to Mrs.\nWilson in the early part of November, 1904, as follows;\nI first saw the head and shoulders of an old clergyman with gray\nhair\u2014no beard ; he wore the old-fashioned \" Geneva bands \" that the\nclergy used to wear. I did not recognise him, but heard Mrs. P\nand Mrs. A say it was their father. I did not see him on\nthe medium's face, but in a corner of the mirror, apart from the\nmedium. I also heard Mrs. P and Mrs. A say that they\nsaw their sister, but I did not see her. After this we saw a ball\nroom in the mirror, very brightly lighted, with people walking\nabout in it. I did not recognise any of them. I ought to have\nsaid that at first I saw a curtain across the room, and it was when\nit was withdrawn that I saw the people walking about.\nThe room we were sitting in was lighted by a candle.\nThis case is clearly analogous to the cases of visions seen\ncollectively in crystals, of which a very few instances have\nbeen reported to us (see e.g. Journal, Vol. x., p. 134; also\nMr. Andrew Lang's The Making of Religion, p. 98). It is,\nhowever, a very marked instance of collective hallucination,\nsince four witnesses had approximately the same impressions,\nwhich lasted for a perceptible length of time, and it has an\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1905.\ninteresting bearing on the hallucinations sometimes experienced\nat spiritualistic stances. It seems worth while, therefore, to\ndiscuss it at some length.\nIt is unfortunate that the witnesses did not record their\nimpressions at the time, or immediately afterwards, since it\nis clear that in some respects their present recollections are\nnot quite correct. Thus Mrs. P. says : \" The electric light\nwas full on all the time, shaded only by a piece of silver\ntissue paper.\" Miss A. says : \" The gas was turned down to\nabout half its strength.\" Mrs. H. says : \" The room we were\nsitting in was lighted by a candle.\" One or other of these\ndescriptions must be inaccurate, unless all of them are\nincomplete. It must however be remembered that we hardly\never find two people giving exactly the same description even\nof ordinary events, and we very seldom have the opportunity\nof comparing together as many as four independent accounts\nof the same occurrence. Whenever we did this, we should\nprobably find quite as much disagreement as in the present\ncase.\nThe position of the medium in relation to the mirror and\nto the sitters is described in very similar terms by Mrs. A.,\nMrs. P., and Miss A., except that Mrs. A. and Mrs. P. say\nthat they sat just behind the medium, while Miss A. describes\nthe medium as being only \" slightly nearer the glass (say\n3 ins.) than the rest of us.\"\nWhen we come to the descriptions of the figures seen in\nthe mirror, the discrepancies are far more marked. There\nis, of course, no proof of inaccuracy in this, because it is quite\npossible\u2014not to say probable\u2014that the hallucinations were\nnot the same to all the percipients. Miss A. is the only\none who describes the appearance of a white mist in\nthe mirror preceding the appearance of the figures. (Our\nreaders will remember that this appearance is a familiar\nexperience with crystal-gazers, whether as a preliminary to\nsubjective or to veridical visions.) With regard to the in\ndividual figures seen: (1) As to the father of Mrs. A. and Mrs.\nP., Mrs. A. and Miss A. say that they saw his face form\nover Mrs. C.'s face in the mirror, Miss A. adding that the\nfigure smiled and nodded its head. Mrs. P. describes a full-\nlength figure of her father in the mirror, in his robes, the\n\fFRB., 1905. Cases. 21\nfigure having no connection with the medium's reflection\nin the mirror. Mrs. H. describes the head and shoulders\nof an old clergyman with grey hair and \" Geneva bands,\"\n\" not on the medium's face, but in a corner of the\nmirror, apart from the medium.\" (2) The sister of Mrs.\nA. and Mrs. P. was seen by both of them and by Miss\nA. in a similar manner\u2014her face forming over the\nmedium's face in the mirror : but not seen at all by Mrs.\nH. though she heard the others saying they had seen it.\n(3) \"Old Mrs. P.\" is mentioned only by Mrs. P. (4) An\nunrecognised lady is described only by Miss A. (5) In the\nscene of the long corridor, with a brilliantly lighted room at\nthe end, and figures walking about in it, all the figures were\nunrecognised, except those of Mrs. A. and her son, which\nwere recognised and described (though somewhat differently)\nby Mrs. A. herself and her daughter.\nThese various discrepancies may arise either from actual\ndissimilarities in the hallucinations, perhaps from inaccuracies\nin the recollections of the witnesses, or possibly from a com\nbination of both causes ; but, however this may be, there\nseems no doubt that the hallucinations were to a great extent\nsimilar. The case then affords a striking proof of the\npossibility\u2014so often denied\u2014of producing hallucinations in\nseveral persons at once by mere suggestion and expectancy,\nwithout hypnosis or any such process. No verbal suggestion\neven was employed by the medium ; for Mrs. Wilson, having\nmade special enquiries on this point, tells us that Mrs. C.\nclosed her eyes and did not speak during the sitting ; the\nsitters, however, did describe what they were seeing to one\nanother during the time of the vision.\nThe case may also tend to throw light on what is stated\nto occur with more than one professional medium,\u2014when\nthe so-called \" materialised form \" is recognised by one sitter\nas the medium masquerading, while another recognises it at\nthe same time as the figure of a deceased friend.\nL. 1143. Impression.\nTHE following case of apparent telepathy from an animal was\nreceived through the kindness of Mr. Eider Haggard, to whom\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1905.\nLady Carbery had sent it in consequence of the somewhat\nsimilar case which he had contributed to The Times of July\n21st, 1904, and which we reprinted in full, with additional\nevidence, in the Journal for October, 1904. Lady Carbery\nwrote to Mr. Haggard:\nCASTLE FREKE, Co. CORK, July 25th, 1904.\nLady Carbery presents her compliments to Mr. Rider Haggard,\nand thinks he may be interested in the enclosed account of how she\nwas summoned to the help of a favourite mare. The statement could\nbe confirmed by the coachman and others. \"Kitty\" is still alive,\nending her days in the fields among her foals, and doing no work.\nThe account enclosed was as follows :\nOn one hot Sunday afternoon in the summer of 1900, I went\nafter luncheon to pay my customary visit to the stables, to give\nsugar and carrots to the horses, among the number being a favourite\nmare named Kitty. She was a shy, nervous, well-bred animal,\nand there existed between us a great and unusual sympathy. I\nused to ride her every morning before breakfast, whatever the\nweather might be\u2014quiet solitary rides on the cliffs which overhang\nthe sea at Castle Freke\u2014and it always seemed to me that\nKitty enjoyed that hour in the freshness of the day as much\nas I did. On this particular afternoon I left the stables and\nwalked alone to the garden, a distance of a quarter of a\nmile, and established myself under a tree with an interesting\nbook, fully intending to remain there for a couple of hours.\nAfter about twenty minutes an uncomfortable sensation came\nbetween me and my reading, and at once I felt sure that there\nwas something the matter with Kitty. I tried to put the feeling\nfrom me and to go on with my book, but the impression grew\nstronger, and I felt compelled to hasten back to the stables. I went\nstraight to Kitty's box, and found her \" cast \" and in urgent need\nof help. The stablemen were in a distant part of the stables, whence\nI fetched them to help the mare up. Their surprise was great to\nfind me in the stables for the second time that afternoon. . . .\nThis account was sent to us by Mr. Eider Haggard, and\nMr. Baggally undertook to make further enquiries into the\ncase. In reply to his first letter, Lady Carbery wrote :\nFRANKFIELD HOUSE, Co. CORK, Dec. 27th, 1904.\nLady Carbery . . . would be glad indeed to have the case in\nvestigated, as it has always seemed to her to be of the greatest\n\fFEB., 1905. Cases. 23\npossible interest. At the same time it may be difficult at this date\nto get a statement from the stablemen, one of whom is somewhere\nin England, but Lady Carbery will try to do so. She is absolutely\nconvinced that no one entered the stable. Had the stablemen done\nso they would at once have helped the mare to get up, and any one\nelse would have given the alarm. It seems a direct case of tele\npathy from animal mind to human. . . .\nLady Carbery afterwards sent Mr. Baggally a statement\nfrom her former coachman, Edward Nobbs, as follow :\nNOSELEY HALL STABLES, NEAR LEICESTER,\nDecember 3lst., 1904.\nI was coachman at Castle Freke at the time, and Lady Carbery\ncame to the stables after luncheon as usual on a Sunday afternoon\nwith carrots and sugar for the horses. Kitty was then loose in her\nbox and quite well. I then went to my rooms over the stables,\nthe other stablemen being also upstairs, and to my surprise about\nhalf an hour or three quarters later her Ladyship, who had been\nto the garden, called me and the other men to come and help\nKitty up, as she was lying cast in her box. No one had gone\ninto the stable in the interval.\n(Signed) EDWARD NOBBS.\nIn a letter to Lady Carbery of the same date, enclosing this\naccount, Edward Nobbs writes :\u2014\" I remember the Sunday\nafternoon quite well. Your Ladyship called me from the\nbottom of the stairs. Jerome McCarthy helped me with the\naid of one of the clothing rollers. At that time Kitty was in\nthe centre box . . .\" Lady Carbery tells us that Jerome\nMcCarthy is now in America.\nAN AUDITORY HALLUCINATION PEOBABLY DUE TO\nASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.\nTHE following is an interesting case of a hallucination which\nseems to be clearly attributable to association of ideas, the\nscene visited apparently calling up in the mind of the perci\npient a subconscious memory of the last time he had visited\nthe place, and this memory becoming externalised as an\nauditory hallucination. We have from time to time recorded\nin our Proceedings a good many instances of visual hallucina\ntions of the same kind, in which an object seen is reproduced\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1905.\nafter a longer or shorter interval as a hallucination. These\nhave sometimes been described as \"after-images,\" but more\nproperly as \" memory-images,\" to distinguish them from the\nordinary \" after-images \" which arise from fatigue of the retina.\nFor examples, with discussion of them, see Proceedings, Vol.\nVIII., pp. 449-455: Vol. X., pp. 139-148; and Vol. XL, pp.\n359-362. It is, however, very unusual for so long a period to\nelapse between the original impression and the hallucinatory\nreproduction of it as in the present case. The account comes\nfrom the Eev. J. H. Towrisend, D.D., Vicar of St. Mark's,\nTunbridge Wells, who writes :\nA few years ago my wife and I, who had been for our summer\nholiday in Wales, determined to spend a few days at Malvern on\nour way home.\nThe journey from Aberystwyth was somewhat long, and it wa&\npast nine on a lovely moonlight night when we arrived at that\nfavourite health resort beside the sheltering hills. Many years had\nelapsed since our last visit, and that had not extended over more\nthan two or three days. The only other time that I had been there\nwas as a child of six years old, so that my knowledge of the locality\nwas very hazy.\nThe lateness of the hour made it impossible for me to recognise\nany landmarks, even supposing that I had any recollection of the\nplace. Next morning I announced my intention of going to the top\nof the Beacon after breakfast, and asked my wife, who knew the\nplace well, how I should find my way.\nShe gave me the needful directions, and following her advice I\nsoon discovered an opening that at once brought me to the foot of\nthe Beacon, and, looking up, I could see two or three groups of\ndonkeys following the winding path that led to the top. I knew\ntherefore that I was all right, and, having set my aneroid, I took\na \"bee line\" for the summit. Purposely I avoided looking about,\nfor I was interested in watching the fall of the needle in the\naneroid which was in my hand, and moreover I wished to have\nthe grand view as a surprise at the end. It was a bright sunny\nmorning, with a fresh breeze, and the contrast between twelve hours\nin the train on the previous day and the exhilarating freedom of\npresent circumstances made me step upward gaily.\nClimbing is to me an inspiring exercise. Many a time have I\nraced uphill whistling in challenged competition with young nephews\n\fFEB., 1905. An Auditory Hallucination. 25\nand nieces, but even without their pleasant companionship the\nbracing air and delightful surroundings were an invigorating tonic.\nWith eyes fixed on the aneroid, and an occasional glance upward\nto see that I was going straight, I rapidly ascended, crossing the\nwinding pathway from time to time, and being just conscious of the\nstrings of donkeys, with their living freight, making in a leisurely\nway for the same goal.\nMuch sooner than I expected the summit was reached, and,\nhaving glanced round to see that I was really there, I hastily\nadjusted the aneroid and calculated the height of the ascent. All\nthis is ordinary experience; nothing that I have narrated is con\ntrary to the sensations of men who have walked to the top of the\nBeacon a hundred times, and\u2014like the King of France in ancient\nstory\u2014\" then walked down again.\"\nNow, however, comes the marvellous part of my tale.\nTo be quite sure that there was no higher point to reach, I looked\nwell around and took in everything. I was alone, quite alone, but\nfor the presence\u2014about fifty yards away\u2014of an old applewoman,\nwho, in a sort of bastion of fruit baskets and ginger-beer bottles,\nwas hopefully prepared for the friendly assaults to be made upon\nher position during the day. Between me and the aged female\naforesaid was a long low stone, and, as my eye fell upon it, I heard\ndistinctly a well-known voice saying to me : \" Well, this is the longest\nwalk that I ham taken since I was laid up, and I never could have done\nit but far your arm.\"\nI almost leaped into the air ! It was the voice of a favourite\nsister, whom I had not seen for years, and whom at that moment I\nbelieved to be in her pretty vicarage home some three hundred\nmiles away. I looked hastily all round. There was no one near\nbut the old applewoman aforesaid, knitting peacefully in her forti\nfication, and down below me, at a little distance, the first con\ntingent of donkeys and children could be seen gradually approaching.\nIn utter amazement my eyes stared at everything\u2014donkeys,\napplewoman\u2014and then again they fell upon the long low stone just\nin front of me. Wonder of wonders ! Again the Voice spoke, but\nthis time in lower tones : \" Well, this is the longest walk that I\nhave taken since I was laid up, and I never could have done it but\nfor your arm.\"\nWhat did it all mean ? Whence came those well-known accents ?\nI stood rooted to the ground in blank wonderment. Again I looked\nfor explanation all around. From below the ripple of childish\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1905.\nlaughter was coming nearer, but I was surely in another world\nthan theirs. They could not explain my mystery, neither could\nthe placid being guarding the refreshments.\nOnce more I looked involuntarily on the old grey stone, and\u2014\nwonderful to relate\u2014once more the mysterious Voice uttered the\nfamiliar sentence, but this time in minute and fairy tones :\n\" Well, this is the longest walk that I have taken since I was laid up, and\nI never could have done it but for your arm.\"\nThere was no standing it. The mystery must be solved; so,\n\u2022without sitting down to rest, without thinking of the splendid\nprospect which I had anticipated so eagerly, I turned and strode\ndown the steep way that I had come, making with the greatest\nspeed for the house and the room in which I had left my wife.\nHaving told my story faithfully, I begged her if possible to throw\nsome light upon the dark enigma.\nAfter a pause she replied : \" Fourteen years ago we all were stay\ning at a house on the other side, nearer the Beacon than this one,\nand you came for a visit of two or three days. I remember that\nMary had sprained her knee, but that is all that I can tell.\"\nThis information made things more interesting, so without delay\nI sat down and wrote to my far-away sister, requesting her to set\nto work at once and help me to fathom the mystery.\nBy return post I received a letter, from which I extract the\nfollowing : \" Your marvellous experience fills us with astonishment.\nYes, it is quite true, when you came to us at 'The Ruby' fourteen\nyears ago I was beginning to recover from a sprain that had laid\nme up for a long time, and had made me very nervous about trying\nto walk. I recollect perfectly how you coaxed me out for a little\nturn, leaning on your arm ; how you told me ever so many funny\nstories, so that I quite forgot myself and did not perceive that you\nwere craftily leading me on until at last you astonished me by\nsaying, ' Now, you who cannot walk are at the top of the Beacon ! '\nThen, I have no doubt\u2014although I have no recollection of it\u2014I\nmust have said the words which you have just heard, somehow, in\nsuch an extraordinary way.\"\nThis letter supplied a clue to the mystery up to a certain point,\nbut there still remained the question : whence came this Voice, or\nwhat seemed like one? What power called this spirit from the\nvasty deep of Memory?\nTurning my mind back upon the events of this strange incident\nit seemed to me as if that long low stone had something to say in\n\fFEB., 1905.

I remembered clearly that as I looked at it again the\nsentence came back both the second and third time.\n[It is probable], therefore, [that] I had placed my companion on this\nthe only seat at hand ; that as I did so, exulting in the success of my\ndevice, she uttered the sentence above mentioned ; and that when I\nnext saw that stone, fourteen years afterwards, the law of association\nof ideas produced in my brain what seemed like a sound in my ears.\nWhether there was any audible sound is another question, but to\nme it seemed like an actual voice, as recognisable as if my sister\nstood before me ; wholly unexpected, because I was not thinking\nof her; and not \"evolved from inner consciousness,\" because I had\nso entirely forgotten the incident that I needed to be reminded of\nit before the meaning of the words could be explained.\nI have never in the course of my life met with, nor have I heard\nof, a similar experience, but I venture to submit that it throws a\nside-light on some of those narratives which from time to time\nastonish the world, of \"voices speaking distinctly\" to individuals\nin visions by night or even in the daylight.\nI would go further and say that it may account for some of the\n\"appearances\" of which we have occasionally heard. If those cells\nof the brain which are connected with the ear may be acted upon\nby association, or some similar power, so as to produce the effect\nof sound, why could not those which command the eye be influenced\nin the same or a kindred way?\nJ. H. TOWNSEND, D.D.\nIn reply to various questions and a request for corrobora-\ntion from his wife and sister, Dr. Townsend writes :\nNovember 23rd, 1904.\n. . . The event took place towards the end of August, 1884,\ntwenty years ago last summer. To you this may seem fatal to\nanything like accuracy, but it is not so, for I wrote out the account\nfully at the time, and have copied it frequently ever since. More\nover, I have a singularly retentive and accurate memory, and up\nto a dozen years ago I could, on the mention of any date in my life,\nrecall almost to a certainty in which of my many homes I had\nbeen at the time, and sometimes the events of the very day. My\nwife remembers the circumstance in its general outline, but no\nmore beyond my occasional reference to it.\nMy sister's letter is in existence ; I re-read it some months ago,\nbut I have no idea in which of my many receptacles for such things\nI have stowed it away. . . .\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1905.\nWe asked Dr. Townsend whether the account sent to us\nwas an actual copy of what he wrote at the time, pointing\nout that this seemed inconsistent with the expression used in\nthe opening sentence, and he replied :\nNmember 25th, [1904].\n. . . The account which you have is a copy of what I wrote\nat the time, with the exception of the opening and closing paragraphs\n(explanatory and deductive) and the time-phrases necessary for the\npresent occasion.\nJ. H. TOWNSEND.\nAUTOMATIC INTELLIGENCE UNDER ANAESTHETICS.\nIN the following case a mental process, having been inter\nrupted by a period of complete unconsciousness, was spon\ntaneously and automatically resumed on the patient reaching\nwhat was probably the same stage of semi-consciousness as\nthat at which it had stopped. The case shows interesting\nanalogies with the different strata of memory found in some\nsubjects at different stages of hypnosis by Mr. Gurney and\nMrs. Sidgwick (see Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. IV., p. 515, and\nMr. Myers's Human Personality, Vol. I., pp. 452-455).\nThe case was recorded by Dr. W. A. Helm, and received\nthrough the Rev. A. T. Fryer. Dr. Helm writes :\nTHE COTTAGE, MUNSLOW,\nCRAVEN ARMS, Dec. nth, 1904.\nOn June 3rd, 1902, I was summoned to attend a young married\nwoman\u2014Mrs. B., of Craven Arms\u2014in childbirth. Finding it\nnecessary to use instruments, I began to administer chloroform.\nIn order to occupy her mind and ensure her breathing properly,\nI made her count slowly \" one, two, three,\" etc., repeating the words\nafter me. She repeated the numbers correctly up to \" thirty-\nseven \" and then lapsed into unconsciousness.\nDelivery was effected and the administration of chloroform\nstopped. My patient soon began to manifest signs of returning\nconsciousness. About 15\u201420 minutes after she had ceased to\nrepeat the numbers after me, she resumed her counting at the\nexact point where she had left off, \" thirty-eight, thirty-nine,\" etc.,\nup to about \"a hundred and forty,\" occasionally interjecting such\nremarks as \" How silly ! What am I doing this for 1\" \" Oh ! I\n\fFEB., 1905. Automatic Intelligence under Anaesthetics. 29\nwish they'd be quick and get it over ! \" and the like. On speaking\nof this occurrence to my patient on the following day, she had no\nrecollection of any break in the counting; it seemed to her as if\nshe had counted straight on from \" one \" to \" a hundred and forty \"\nwithout any interval. Neither the nurse in attendance nor myself\nsaid anything to the patient or repeated any number from the\nmoment when she lost consciousness until after she had resumed\ncounting. (I followed her \" thirty-seven \" with \" thirty-eight,\"\nand getting no response I ceased to count). . . .\nWILLIAM A. HELM, M.B.\nIn reply to some questions on certain points in his account,\nDr. Helm wrote :\nJanuary 3rd, 1905.\n. . . With regard to the ambiguous points in my communciation :\n(1) My patient resumed her counting when she was \"coming\nround\"\u2014she was not fully conscious. In fact she did not under\nstand what was said to her ; when I heard her counting I spoke\nto her several times to see if she would respond, but she took no\nnotice. Her brain was no doubt acting automatically, as in the\ncase of people who talk in their sleep. In this case the patient\nwas (before the operation commenced) anaesthetised to the full\nsurgical extent, viz., until the pupil-reflex was just abolished. (In\nansesthetising a person the most highly developed functions of the\nbrain are abolished first, and the least highly developed functions\nlast. When the patient is regaining consciousness the functions of\nthe brain are restored in reverse order.)\n(2) The operation was fully over before she began [again] to count.\nIt was not begun until she was fully unconscious and was concluded\nbefore she began to regain consciousness, so that she was naturally\nunaware that it had taken place. It seems to me probable (I had\nalmost written certain) that her mental processes were entirely in\nabeyance during the interval (some fifteen minutes or so) between\nher repetition of the numbers 37 and 38.\n(3) Neither I nor the nurse repeated any numbers to her from\nthe moment of her losing consciousness. The whole process of\ncounting from 38 to 140 was spontaneous and automatic on her\npart. . . .\nWILLIAM A. HELM.\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1905.\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE INDIAN EOPE-CLIMBING\nTEICK.\nIN the Journal for November, 1904, we printed an account of\nthe Indian rope-climbing trick as witnessed in 1901 by Mr.\nBurchett. One of our Members, Mr. F. C. Constable, of Wick\nCourt, near Bristol, who was for long a resident in India, has\nsince written to The Pioneer (of Allahabad, India) on the subject,\nand has in consequence received, among others, the following\nletter, which he sends us. The writer gives her name and\naddress, but asks that they shall not be printed.\nBERAE, INDIA, December nth, 1904.\nWith reference to your letter on Indian Jugglery, dated November\n24th, 1904, which appeared in The Pioneer of the 14th inst., I\nsaw the trick you mention from the verandah of Watson's Hotel,.\nBombay, in November (I am not sure of the day of the month),\n1897, between 2 and 3 p.m. A great many 'others must have\nseen it too, for the verandah was very full, three boats having\ncome in that day\u2014i.e. the P. and 0. Mail Steamer, the Messageries\nboat in which my husband and I were passengers, and either a\nEubattino or an Anchor Liner, and I remember a number of people\nwere collected after lunch on the verandah specified, talking or\nleaning over the balcony (which as you may perhaps know is on\nan upper storey) watching the people below, among whom were a\nparty of conjurors. They, among many other tricks, did the \" rope\ntrick.\" That is, one of them threw a rope into the air which hitched\nitself up to apparently nothing in the sky above ; one could see\nthe rope going straight up as far as one could see anything, and\nit certainly did not on being thrown up at once fall back to the\nearth again. A small boy then swarmed up this rope, becoming\nsmaller and smaller, till he likewise vanished from sight, and a few\nminutes later bits of his (apparently mangled) remains fell from\nthe sky, first an arm, then a leg, and so on till all his component\nparts had descended ; these the juggler covered with a cloth,\nmumbled something or other, made a pass or two, and behold 1\nthere was the boy smiling and whole before us, and the rope was\njerked off its invisible hook and rolled up, and the trick was done.\nThe jugglers were seated well below us on the open ground, with\nno attempt at concealment, and with nothing about them but the\nvery scant properties of an Indian Conjuror (too well known tc>\nrequire description). I was, unfortunately, quite unaware at the\n\fFEB., 1905. Account of the Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 31\ntime that I had the good fortune to be looking on at a trick very\nrarely seen, and I am sure the performance did not rouse any\nparticular comment at the time, unless possibly a passing remark\nthat the trick was a great improvement on the usual manga\ntree and basket-trick, etc. It was only several years later when the\nconversation at a dinner table casually turned on juggling, that I\ndiscovered that this trick, from being so rarely seen, was usually\nregarded as being mythical, and my statement that 7 had seen it\nwas received with polite incredulity, and the explanation given\nthat I had been hypnotised. If this latter were the case, I can only\nsay that I must have been hypnotised in a very large company, from\namong whom I have no doubt I could call many witnesses, did I know\nwhere to find them ; but I have lost sight of those of our fellow\npassengers whom I remember to have been present, and of course\na great many of those present were strangers to me. My husband\nwas either not on the verandah at the moment or does not remember\nthe occurrence. Had I only had the least idea that I was watching\nanything so out of the common, I should, of course, have made\na point of calling him to look at it too. But to me a juggler is\na juggler ; they have no great attraction for me, but when I look\nat them I expect to see things I can in no way account for.\nDid I doubt the evidence of my own eyes, which I do not, I\nhave one piece of circumstantial evidence to offer, showing that\nthe rope trick is not the myth so many imagine it. Some\ntime after the dinner discussion on this trick above alluded\nto, I happened to be at a small hill-station in Central India in\nthe hot, weather of 1900. Some very good conjurors, who had\nbeen home to the Earl's Court Exhibition, came to give a per\nformance there, and I asked their leader if he would do the rope\ntrick. The man knew at once to what I alluded, but said he could\nnot do the trick, as it is only done by a certain sect or class of\nconjurors (from the N.-W. Provinces, I think he said); he gave\nme the name of the sect, but I stupidly trusted my memory and\ndid not write it down. Now I have forgotten it. ...\nNOTES.\nOUE readers may be interested to learn that the first volume\nof Mr. Myers's Human Personality (Chaps.

MAB., 1905.\nthe newly elected President, Professor Charles Kichet, Professor\nof Physiology in the Paris Faculty of Medicine, referring briefly\nto the eminent services which he had rendered. to the cause of\npsychical research and his courageous support of the Society\nin its early days. . .. ,...'. ,\nTHE PRESIDENT then took the chair and delivered (in French)\nan Address, of which the following is a summary :\nThough a foreigner, I am not a stranger to the Society, but\nwas interested in its work from the beginning, having already\nrecognised that classical physical science did not afford an\nadequate view of the mystery underlying the phenomenal world.\nThe change in sentiment towards these studies during the last\n30 years is remarkable. In 1875 .not one of the so-called\n' occult ' phenomena,\u2014somnambulism, animal magnetism, hypno\ntism, etc.,\u2014.was officially accepted. Notwithstanding Sir W.\nCrookes's studies, spiritism was universally scouted as unworthy\neven of refutation. The spiritists themselves were more devoted\nto the spinning of theories than to the establishment of facts,\nand their vague accounts of the phenomena justly provoked\nscepticism. Scientific ' psychical research ' is necessarily scepti\ncal. We do not shrink, when we have reached certitude, from\nproclaiming it. But science does not consist of the establish\nment of a single fact, nor even of several. The isolated facts\nmust be co-ordinated, proved and elucidated by repetitions.\nThe change in public sentiment is largely due to the labours\nof the S.P.B. and the association with it of eminent men.\nThere is now an immense mass of material, and it is time that\na text-book dealing synthetically with the facts of ' occult\nscience ' should be provided. 'Occult science,' however, is an\nunsatisfactory term. All sciences at their outset are occult,\nand only cease to be so when they become further advanced.\nNor is ' psychical science ' a happy term. The ^v^y is not\ninvolved in many of its manifestations. ' Spiritistic science '\nis worse, inasmuch as the spirit hypothesis, notwithstanding its\nsomewhat naif simplicity, is not, on the whole, acceptable. I\npropose, with all the hesitancy that becomes one when venturing\non a neologism, a new term\u2014' metapsychical science,' on the\nanalogy of the word \" metaphysics.\"\nMy suggested text-book of this science would deal with\nphenomena (a) purely psychical, (6) purely material, (a) includes\n\fMAB., 1905. General Meeting.\nphenomena involving no vibration or movement of matter, such\nas premonitions, telepathy, etc. (6) includes phenomena import\ning some force acting on matter, such as raps, apports, material\nisations, etc. Sometimes (a) and (6) intermingle, as e.g. a\npremonition given by raps without contact.\nTo produce the material phenomena the action of some un\nknown physical force must be supposed. This supposition in\nvolves no a priori absurdity, for the known forces of nature are\nas nothing compared.with the unknown. One of the simplest of\nmaterial phenomena is that of raps produced without contact.\nAfter eliminating all possible explanations through fraud, mal-\nobservation, etc., there remain a large number of cases where\nraps, inexplicable by chance or by contractions, have been heard\nin a table which no one is touching. It may not be surpris\ning that classical science has been rigorous in demanding proof\nof such phenomena. But it is less to its credit that it should\nbe content to judge and to deny without serious experiment.\nPatience is required, and a few negative experiments do not\nsettle the question. But the history of metapsychics is full of\ncases where competent scientific observers, after years of patient\ninvestigation, with many checks, doubts, reactions, have ended\nin conviction. This path is not one of flowers, but is strewn\nwith stones, and those who adventure on it often have cause\nfor regret that they did not remain content with the prudent\nbut more cowardly course of slumbering either in the simple\nand blind credulity of the spiritists, in the solemn and negative\ndisdain of the scientists, or in the self-satisfied and apathetic\nindifference of the great majority of men.\nAssuming the existence of the ' material ' phenomena, con\ntemporary science is not thereby imperilled. But a difference\nappears between these forces and those already recognised by\nscience. They are intelligent, and hence arises a formidable\nproblem. Are they human or extra-human ? I see no a priori\nscientific reason against the latter hypothesis, but there seems\nno necessity as yet: for accepting it. The discussion is, however,\npremature ; facts must precede theories, and we must proceed\nexperimentally to ascertain the conditions of a phenomenon\nbefore considering its cause.\n\u2022'-When we come' to the psychical phenomena, the method of\nstudy must be: 'quite!'different, the object being the analysis of\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAB., 1906.\npsychological facts. A man's knowledge is derived from sensa\ntions and inferences from them. I may be aware of the death\nof A. B. because I have witnessed it or because I have been told\nof it, or because, knowing him to be ill, I infer it. Such\nknowledge would be adequately explained by the laws of\nordinary perception and reasoning. But if, having recently\nleft A. B. in perfect health, I am able suddenly to affirm him\nto be dead at the moment when an unforeseen blow has struck\nhim, we enter the region of metapsychics. Immaterial meta-\npsychical phenomena may thus be denned as those having an\norigin other than in our normal perceptive and reasoning facul\nties. A few cases may be explained as due to chance, but by\nfar the most fertile source of error in experiments in this type\nof rnetapsychical phenomena is not chance, but unconscious\nmemory. Formerly a sharp line was drawn between the things\none remembered and the things one did not. But the study\nof hypnotism has now shown that memory is an inexorable\nfaculty of our intelligence, and that none of our perceptions\nare ever truly effaced from it. The recollection of them\nslumbers, but remains indelible. The consciousness may forget ;\nbut the intelligence cannot.\nThis unconscious, or in Myers's phrase, ' subliminal,' memory\nis ever wakeful and attentive, mingling with our sentiments and\nour conduct, acting, reasoning; constituting our veritable 'ego';\nbut with this advantage over our conscious ' ego ' of being\nincapable of ever losing track of even the smallest particle of\nwhat, in our lives, men and circumstances may have brought\nto us. If we could but contemplate the immense mass of\nrecollections of which our sub-conscious memory is the vigilant\nguardian we should find treasures of which we are in complete\nignorance. Thus often cases of so-called ' lucidity ' are really\nbut products of our sub-conscious memory, however honestly\nwe may believe in and maintain our complete ignorance of the\nfacts concerned.\nAmong these alleged phenomena we find : Lucidity or clair\nvoyance ; either telepathic (i.e. the supernormal knowledge by\none mind of a fact contained in the consciousness of another)\nor clairvoyance pure (i.e. the supernormal knowledge of a\nfact unknown to any other person). Each of these may\noccur experimentally or spontaneously. Experimental lucidity\n\fMAH., 1906. General Meeting. 41\nis unhappily rarer than spontaneous or occasional lucidity.\n(Experiments with contact, such as ' thought-reading,' so-called,\nor ' willing,' must of course be disregarded.) But though neither\ncan be reproduced at will, there is strong evidence at least for\nthe latter. On the other hand, experiments in lucidity, especially\nin cases where chance can be accurately calculated, e.g. random\nselections from a pack of cards, are of far greater value.\nApparitions at the time of death, which are to be classed\namong cases of spontaneous lucidity, seem as well established\nas the fall of a meteorite, but unfortunately are as little capable\nof experimental repetition. Such apparitions are to be regarded\nas purely hallucinatory. The event penetrates the consciousness\nof the percipient, and then reveals itself in the symbolic form\nof an apparition, or of an auditory hallucination. It appears\nto me certain that particular individuals, so-called mediums,\nare more capable than others of supernormal perception, but\nI find it difficult to believe that between them and the rest of\nhumanity a hard line is drawn and that we are not all more\nor less susceptible to the same influences.\nThe personations or ' controls ' of mediums may be regarded as\na special class of lucidity. Mrs. Piper and Professor Flournoy's\nMile. Smith exhibit types of this class. The normal personality\nof the medium disappears, and another, completely different,\nenters upon the scene. Our first tendency is to believe in\nthe reality of these personalities. But they are precisely\nsimilar to the cases of secondary personality occasionally\nproduced under hypnotism, when there is no question what\never but that they are merely variations of the subject's own\nintelligence. May not these ' controls ' which play so large\na part in spiritism really be phenomena of just the same\nclass? For if to an ordinary hypnotic secondary personality you\nwere to add a certain admixture of lucidity you would\nget a complete imitation of the Piper phenomena. There\nseems to be no way in which the affirmation by one of\nthese personalities that he is so-and-so can possibly carry\ncomplete conviction.\nPremonitions, philosophically considered, seem the most per\nplexing of all the alleged phenomena. We should not, how\never, be deterred by mere strangeness. The question is not\nwhether a particular fact would upset our conception of the\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAB., 1905,\nUniverse, for that conception is but a;j sadly childish affair!\nThe real question is to ascertain whether, as I am tempted\nby my own experience to believe, there are in fact authentic\ncases of this kind.\nI conclude that though much -has been done, there remains\nmuch more to do. There are indeed but few of the alleged\nmetapsychical phenomena on which all doubt has been triumph\nantly dissipated,\u2014perhaps but two or three elementary ones\nwhich we can claim as definitely established, as, for example,\nraps without contact, or veridical hallucinations. Even these,\nthough to us they may seem to have been well enough proved,\nhave not yet been accepted by official and classical science*\nand we have still great efforts to make in order to gain for\nthem recognition. Hence our reserve in the matter of theory.\nNot but what many theories have been propounded, but all\nseem sadly insufficient. We have seen that it seems probable\nthat certain unknown forces act both upon matter and upon the\nhuman intelligence. Two hypotheses are suggested : that these\nforces are either inherent in the human body or extra-human;\nThe former hypothesis presupposes that our nervous organism\nhas the power of exteriorising itself by ' telekinesis ' or action\nat a distance, and of perceiving external things by ' telepathy '\nor supersensuous faculty. If the forces are extra-human, this\nmeans that there are intelligent forces capable of interference in\nbur world, of moving material objects and of acting on our\nthoughts. This hypothesis implies that the intelligences belong\neither to beings different from men, or to men who have once\nlived. That is, they are either genii, Safaoves, angels ; or sur\nviving human souls. It would be easy to show that this latter\nand very simple theory, which is that of the spiritists, is open\nto serious objections ; while theologians, for reasons of other\nthan an experimental character, are the only people who defend\nthe former. As to the theory which attributes all to incarnate\nhuman forces, it seems to me difficult to admit.\nThere are then three equally improbable and irrational\ntheories; which gives me the right of proposing another. It\nis neither long nor hard to understand, for a new theory,\ncapable of explaining the phenomena, I cannot formulate,\nhaving no idea, nor foreseeing in the least, what it should be.\nMy theory is simply this,:\u2014that the future -will certainly\n\fMAB., 1905; ,v., \" General Meeti\/rig.\nenlighten us.' I think indeed 'that in a not ; distant time;\nwhen new facts shall have been ascertained, we shall be able to\nformulate some other hypothesis than those of spirits and of\nhuman effluvia. This unknown 'theory X has every chance of\nbeing true, as was Kepler's theory before Kepler, the theory\nof chemistry before Lavoisier, and of electricity before Ampere,\nFaraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. In these cases the truth had\nbeen neither foreseen nor guessed, and so will it prove to be\nwith the true metapsychical theory. ' We have at present but\nisolated phenomena, the link between which we fail to perceive.\nThe discovery may be very simple, but it has not yet been\nmade ; for though many of the phenomena are real, every\ntheory that has been built upon them is absurd. Our motto\nmust then be Laboremus : let us work.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1904.\nA CONSIDERABLE impetus has been given this year to the\nEndowment Fund for Psychical Research by the generous offer\nof Mr. Morris Hudson in February to contribute \u00a350 to it\nif by the end of the year other members should have given\nenough to make up with his contribution the sum of \u00a31000.\nAlthough rather less than half this sum has actually been sub\nscribed, Mr. Hudson has very kindly allowed his conditional\ngift to stand, with the result that the Fund, including\naccumulated interest, amounts at the end of January, 1905, to\nabout \u00a36800. The Treasurer's report (see p. 51), shows how\nthe money is invested. Thus it still falls short of the minimum\nof \u00a38,000 which the Council decided to be necessary before\nthe Research Scholarship could be founded, but it is hoped\nthat this sum may be completed before long.\nWith regard to the current accounts for the year, printed\nbelow, there is little to note. A satisfactory feature is the\ncontinued increase in the income derived from the ordinary\nannual subscriptions, which amounts this year to about \u00a3100\nmore than last year (\u00a31051 as against \u00a3953). This is, of\ncourse, owing chiefly to the increase in membership,\u2014partly\nto the decrease in bad debts among subscriptions, and to\nsubscriptions being paid more regularly. It is also satis\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1905.\nfactory that it has been possible out of the ordinary income\nof the Society to invest \u00a3250 in the purchase of Midland\nRailway Pref. Stock.\nThe increase in membership during the year has been\nwell maintained. During the year 33 new Members were\nelected and one Associate became a Member ; on the other\nhand the loss in number of Members from various causes\nwas 18 (besides one Honorary and one Corresponding\nMember) leaving a net increase of 14 Members. Also 97\nnew Associates were elected and 5 Members became Asso\nciates ; the loss in numbers of Associates from various causes\nwas 69 (besides 7 Honorary Associates), leaving a net in\ncrease of 26 Associates. The total net increase of member\nship during the year is thus 40, and the numbers are\ndistributed as follows :\u2014Total number of Members and Asso\nciates, 861; consisting of 223 Ordinary Members, 32 Honor\nary and Corresponding Members, 594 Associates, 12 Honorary\nAssociates.\nDuring the year the American Branch has also increased\nfrom 536 to 569 Members and Associates.\nAt the end of July, Mr. J. G. Piddington was unfortu\nnately obliged by ill-health to go abroad, and is expected\nto be absent from England for about a year. Meanwhile\nthe work of the Hon. Secretary is being carried on by his\ncolleague, the Hon. E. Feilding.\nThe Library has now been completely re-arranged, the\nbooks being classified under different subjects, so as to make\nreference to them easier. A good many books, new and old,\nhave been and are being added, and a new catalogue has\nbeen prepared, which will shortly be printed. The rules\nhave been revised, so that Members are now allowed to take\nout three volumes at a time and to keep each for one\nmonth.\nThe Combined Index described in the last annual report\nof the Council has now been published. It covers all the\npublications of the Society from its foundation in 1882 to\nthe year 1900 inclusive, namely, the Proceedings, Vols. I. to\nXV., the Journal, Vols. I. to IX., the two volumes of\nPhantasms of the Living ; also the Proceedings of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research, Parts I.-IV. (forming Vol. I.),\n\fMAB., 1905. Report of the Council. 45\nwhich were issued during the years 1885-1889, after which\nthe American Society was formed into the American Branch\nof our own Society. It also contains a complete list of\nthe Contents of the Proceedings, and not only combines\ninto one all the separate Indexes, already published with\neach volume of the above works, but also contains a far\nmore complete list of names\u2014both of persons and places\n\u2014than were included in the separate Indexes, as well\nas a large number of additional items treating of topics and\ncases under classified headings, with numerous cross-references.\nThe Index has been prepared by Miss C. Burke, and\nrevised throughout by the Editor.\nTwo General Meetings and four Private Meetings of the\nSociety (for Members and Associates only), were held during\nthe year. The dates and the papers read were as follows :\n* January 29th. \" Presidential Address\" by Professor W. F.\nBarrett, F.E.S.\n* March 21st. \"A Case of Multiple Personality\" by Albert\nWilson, M.D.\nMay 9th. \" Experiments in Motor Automatism \" by Mrs.\nA. W. Verrall.\nJune 24th. \" The Light thrown on Psychological Processes\nby the Action of Drugs\" by Mr. Ernest Dunbar.\nOctober 21st. \"Some Cases Eecently Eeceived\" by the\nHon. Everard Feilding.\nDecember 5th. \"Various Spiritualistic Phenomena witnessed\nby the Author\" by Lieut.-Colonel Le M. Taylor.\nOf these papers, the first two have since been published\nin the Proceedings and it is hoped that the others will appear\nlater in the Proceedings or Journal.\nVarious series of experiments have been carried out during\nthe year:\n(1) With Mr. E. F. Eichardson, of Nottingham, who claimed\nthat he had successfully cultivated the power of thought-\ntransference in some of his friends. In the sittings held by\na Committee of the S.P.E., a report of which was printed in\nthe Journal for May, he failed entirely to substantiate this\nclaim.\n* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.\n\f46 Journal of Society for'Psychical Research. MAR., 1905\n'.'(2) Arrangements were made : in conjunction with the\nLondon Spiritualist Alliance for a series .of sittings with Mr.\nBailey, a professional medium whose performances in Australia*\nespecially in the production of apports, had been reported in\nLight, and about whom information had been received from\none of our Australian members, Mr. A. :W. Dobbie. Mr*\nBailey having arranged to visit several European countries\nthis year for the purpose of giving sittings, had consented to\nthe arrangements proposed by the S.P.K. and L.S.A. for\nsittings in London. He went first to Italy, however, and\nafter a few sittings in Milan and Eome returned suddenly to\nAustralia. Reports were published in Light of the Italian\nsittings, as to the results of which there seem to have been\ndifferences of opinion. Mr. Dobbie sent us reports of his\nown sittings with Mr. Bailey in Australia, which ,he con\nsidered unsatisfactory on the whole. He also sent us some\nspecimens of the apports produced at these \u2022 sittings, namely,\nsome small coins, said to be Egyptian, with the request that\nwe should submit them to experts at the British Museum.\nWe did so, and were informed that they were genuine, but\nextremely common and valueless. We have, however, since\nreceived from a gentleman who had sittings, which in his\nopinion were of extreme interest, with Mr. Bailey at Sydney,\na number of larger objects alleged to have been produced\nas apports at these sittings, and which 'are to be further\nexamined.\n(3) A large number of sittings have also , been held with\nvarious members of the Society, no professional medium being\npresent. The results in some cases were decidedly promising,\nbut not sufficiently conclusive to admit of .publication at pre\nsent. It is much to be desired that members of the\nSociety should themselves form small circles if they can meet\nwith any private persons who appear to have mediumistic or\nautomatic powers, and that they should report to the Secre\ntary or Hon. Secretary if they obtain results which are capable\nof being investigated. There are no doubt many \" sensitives \"\nwith whom interesting and instructive experiments might be\ntried, if they were : willing to submit themselves to a regular\nseries of such, and members of the Society are earnestly asked\nto bear this in mind and to co-operate with the Council in\n\fMAB., 1905. .'\u2022;'\u2022: '.\u2022\u2022- Report of'the Council. 47\ntrying to obtain the help of such persons in the work of the\nSociety. '.if..\n. Among other experiments carried out not at the Rooms of\nthe Society, some of the most interesting reported to us were\nthose of Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Bradgate in simultaneous auto\nmatic writing. These experiments were started at the sugges\ntion of Mr. Baggally, and an account of them was included in\nthe paper read by Mr. Feilding at the meeting on October\n21st, a brief report of which was printed in the Journal for\nNovember, 1904.\nSome cases of the cure of warts by suggestion have been\nreported to us by Mr. J. F. Young, of Llanelly, and Mr. Young\nis continuing his experiments in this direction. It will be\nremembered that a case of curing at a distance was recently\nprinted in the Journal (for July, 1904).\nMr. Feilding has carried out a number of experiments in\nhypnotism, some of which he described at the meeting of the\nSociety on October 21st. He would be very glad to hear of\nany persons likely to prove suggestible subjects who would be\nwilling to submit themselves to experiment.\nThe time of the officers of the Society has been largely\ntaken up with interviews, correspondence, answers to enquiries\nand investigation of cases. In the last department especially,\nconstant and invaluable help has as usual been given by Colonel\nTaylor, Mr. Baggally, and the Eev. A. T. Fryer, and occasional\ncontributions have been received from other members of the\nSociety, to all of whom our best thanks are due. During part\nof the year also useful help in the correspondence was given\nby Mr. Hume-Eothery. Mr. Fryer has also collected a large\namount of information about the present religious revival in\nWales, the psychological aspect of which is of considerable\ninterest for students of psychical research, and it is hoped\nthat a report of it from this point of view will be made.\nA local group for psychical research has been formed during\nthe year by Mr. Walter Howell at Birmingham, and a local\nSociety at Manchester under the presidency of Mr. A. W.\nOrr. The formation of a Society at Montreal, of which one\nof our members, Mr. E. Percy Gomery, is President, was also\nreported to us in October. This Society holds general meetings\nevery fortnight for the reading of papers, discussion or experi\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1905.\nmentation, in the rooms of the Natural History Society at\nMontreal, and already contains about 50 members. It seems\nto have made a vigorous start, and we hope to hear more\nof its doings later.\nThough the actual progress made each year seems, when\ntaken alone, to be but small, there is no doubt a steady growth\nin the interest taken in the subject all the world over. This\nis shown not only by the constant increase in our member\nship, but even more by the frequent references to the Society\nand its work in the literature of the day, which seem to indi\ncate that the importance of psychical research is coming to\nbe more and more widely recognised by the most enlightened\nand intellectual classes both of readers and writers. A note\nworthy symptom of this is to be seen in the fact that among\nthe books recommended on the subject of Metaphysics in the\nFellowship Course of Trinity College, Dublin, for 1905, is\nMr. Myers's Human Personality (Vol. I. Chaps. I.-IV.), Mr.\nMyers being the only English philosopher whose works appear\nin the list.\nIn the early days of the Society one of the greatest obstacles\nto progress was the difficulty of getting an impartial hearing\nfrom men of science and repute for the evidence from time\nto time brought forward. Perhaps our greatest danger to-day\nlies rather in the opposite direction,\u2014in a too great readiness to\naccept evidence that is still far from being complete. Telepathy,\nfor instance, till recently scouted, is now commonly spoken\nof as if it were almost on the same scientific footing as the\ntheory of evolution,\u2014not because there is any general familiarity\nwith the evidence on which it rests, but because it is popularly\nsupposed to have reached a stage of scientific acceptance,\nplacing it beyond the necessity of further demonstration. The\ngeneral result of this attitude is unfortunately to discourage\nthe accumulation of the fresh evidence which is so urgently\nneeded,\u2014not only for telepathy but in every branch of our\nwork.\nIt is astonishing, for example, how rarely opportunities are\npresented to us of investigating certain of the phenomena of\nspiritism most frequently reported and widely accepted by\nspiritists, such as the production of \" raps,\" either with or\nwithout contact.\n\fMAE., 1905. Report of the Council. 49\nIt is only recently through the kindness of a member of\nthe Society that the present officials have for the first time\nhad an opportunity of observing this particular phenomenon at\na couple of sittings at which raps without any apparent con\ntact occurred. If, however, raps are so common as they are\nalleged to be, it is greatly to be regretted that more frequent\noccasions should not arise for their careful investigation.\nWe venture, therefore, earnestly to ask members in whose\nexperience these phenomena occur to offer us an opportunity\nof witnessing them. And though any investigation which may\nbe allowed should, of course, be conducted in a systematic\nmanner, we hope that no assurance is required that it would\nnot on that account be otherwise than completely sympathetic.\nAnother obstacle to advance is the idea that certain types\nof phenomena are now so far established that it is superfluous\neither to make or to scrutinize records of them with the minute\ncare that was exercised by the early workers and founders\nof the Society,\u2014that, in effect, a lower standard of work is\nnow permissible.\nThe Council desire to inculcate on members of the Society\na view precisely the opposite of this. Our constant endeavour\nshould be, not to ignore, but if possible to improve on the\nmethods of our predecessors ; to examine \" in the same spirit\nof exact and unimpassioned enquiry\" whatever apparently well-\nauthenticated evidence is brought before us, and to discriminate\nas far as possible between the good and the bad, or the good\nand the less good ; rather than resignedly to lump it all together\nwith the indolent conclusion that everything is more or less\ncertain or uncertain.\nIf the phenomena alleged to occur have a real objective\nexistence, and if they have the bearing which they appear to\nhave on the most vital problems, no labour can be too great\nand no trouble should be spared to establish and to elucidate\nthem.\n[Account\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Collective Auditory.\nTHE following account was sent to us through a member of\nthe Council from a gentleman, belonging to the Society, who\nis a master in a well-known public school. The names of\nall the persons concerned have been given to us, with the\nrequest not to print them. Mr. C.'s account, enclosed in a\nletter dated January 13th, 1905, is as follows:\nIn the autumn of 1902 I was recovering from a long illness, in\nconsequence of which I wore a spinal jacket by day, and had turned\nmy downstairs study into my bedroom. It was also my custom\nto go to bed about 8 p.m. I have a boarding-house at a public\nschool with the care of about 30 boys ; the majority of these live\nin a part of the house shut off from our private rooms, but five or\nsix boys sleep in two rooms on the first floor near the bedroom used\nat the time by my wife. On Sunday, December 7th, 1902, about 7.30\nor 8 p.m., I was sitting alone in my room and thought I heard a\nknock on the door. I said \" Come in,\" but no one appeared, and\nI concluded the noise was due to the wind, as there was a breeze\nthat evening. I still think it may have been the effect of wind.\nA second time I heard a knock and there was no one, but still I\nwas not much surprised. Shortly afterwards I took off my jacket\nand went to bed. At that time when I had taken off the jacket\nI was not allowed to raise my shoulders until I had it on again.\nMy wife was in the room. Suddenly we heard a tremendous bang\nupon the door, as if some one had struck it full with the fist. I\nsaid to my wife, \"Go and see what it is.\" She replied, \"I dare\nnot.\" If I had been able to rise, I think I should have gone at\nonce, but I wish to note that I felt seriously alarmed, in a way\nthat I could hardly explain. My wife's remark shows that she\nfelt the same, and this feeling of unreasonable fright is what remains\nwith us both as the strongest impression. We listened intently,\nand are quite sure that no one could have left the neighbourhood\nof the door without being heard, and in four or five seconds my wife\nwent to the door and found no one. I heard nothing more.\nNext morning my wife at breakfast told me that in the night\nshe woke up and felt sure she heard some one walking up the stairs.\nShe went out of her room and while on the landing close to the\ndoor of a room in which three boys were sleeping, she heard dis\ntinctly one or two deep sighs. Beyond this she heard nothing and\n\fAPRIL, 1905. Cases. 55\nreturned to her room. . We thought a great deal about the\noccurrence and told several friends.\nAbout Christmas we received a letter from India to say that Mr.\nW , father of one of the boys who slept in the room mentioned\nabove, had died on December 6th after a short illness. It is worth\nmentioning that I had only once seen Mr. W , on the sole\noccasion when he came to my house and had an interview with me\nin the room where the knock was heard.\nIt seems to me probable that there is some connection between\nthe death and the noise. I should further say that I have never\nhad any experience of the kind or other hallucination, but that my\nwife on several occasions has heard unaccountable noises at the\ntime of death of some of her relatives.\nThe boy W\u2014\u2014 left my house in April, 1903, and I did not see\nhis mother, Mrs. W , until September, 1904, when she came to\ncall upon me with a view to sending her son back.\nI then told her what had happened. She was not surprised, and\ntold me of a strange occurrence that took place in India the same\nnight. Mr. W was attacked by typhoid fever. The doctor\ntold Mrs. W that the only chance for him was to conceal from\nhim the danger of his state, and he died after a very short illness\nwithout any farewell about 12 midnight, December 6. The follow\ning evening (I think somewhat late), Mrs. W was in the room\nalone with the body, and said, \" 0 , you never said good-bye,\ndear.\" Instantly she heard behind her a voice which said quite\nloudly, \" Good-bye, dear.\" She left the room, crossed the verandah,\nand went into another room on the far side of the verandah where\nthe children were sleeping. There she asked the nurse, \" Did you\nhear anything just now?\" The nurse said \"Yes, Miss J rose\nstraight up in her bed asleep and said quite loud, ' Good-bye, dear,'\nand then fell back again.\" Mrs. W tells me that the girl\ncould not possibly have heard what she (Mrs. W.) said in the other\nroom, as the rooms were too far apart.\nThis account is signed in full by Mr. C. and Mrs. C. signs\nthe following note :\nI consider this a correct account of what took place on the\nSunday, December 7th, 1902.\nIn the letter accompanying the account, Mr. C. writes :\nI should add that Mrs. W told me that Mr. W had a\nstrong belief in the possibility of communication with another world,\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.\nand was entirely devoted to his children. He was an Indian Civil\nServant and a man of great ability.\nIn reply to our questions Mr. C. writes :\nJanuary 25th, 1905.\nI made no note about the date, but the occurrence made such\nan extraordinary impression on me that I could not possibly forget\nit, and the fact of its happening on Sunday night (when there were\nno servants on any floor but the basement), prevents any possi\nbility of confusion in the day of the week. We mentioned the\nmatter at once to Mr. T. who is one of my assistant-masters\nliving in the house, and I send you his testimony.\nI enclose the two letters which I received about the death. I\nreceived Mr. W. A.'s first, and it came by the mail from India\narriving the end of Christmas week\u2014that would be from December\n26th-28th, probably December 27th, Saturday being the usual day\nfor the mail to arrive. You will notice that unfortunately it is not\ndated, but there is a reference to the 18th December as a future\ndate. The other letter is from another brother of Mrs. W and\narrived later. You see it is written on December 29th. . . .\nThe three letters enclosed in the above were as follows:\n(1) From Mr. T.\nJanuary 2bth, 1905.\nI distinctly recollect hearing Mr. C mention the mysterious\nknocks on his door. I believe on the day after the occurrence,\ncertainly before December 14th, 1902.\n(2) From Mr. W. A.\nDEAR MR. C-\nMr. W died most unexpectedly on the 6th\ninstant. . . . Mrs. W leaves for England on the 18th December\nand should arrive about 6th January, 1903.\n(3) From Mr. J.

The incident is explained to me by my child being so\ndevoted and so sympathetic\u2014it was perfectly natural that she\nshould feel what I was feeling. . . . There were two bedrooms\nside by side\u2014not opening into each other\u2014both opened on to a\nbalcony which ran along the house. My little girl, about 3\u00a3 years\nold, and her nurse were in one room asleep. It was about 2 a.m.\nI was kneeling by my husband's coffin in the other room. I was\ngreatly distressed that he had not said 'good-bye' to me. We were\nmost devoted and his death was a terribly sudden shock. It may\nseem strange that in the midst of such desperate trouble such a\nsmall thing as his not actually having said the word ' good-bye ' should\nhave affected me, but it did ; and I said, \" You never even said\ngood-bye.\" At the moment I heard a voice which seemed to come\ndirect from the coffin say, \"Good-bye, Mummy, good-bye.\" I went\ninto the next room and asked the nurse if she had heard anything\nand she said \"No.\" I said, \"Did no one speak?\" and she said,\n\"Now, do rest; Miss J is asleep. She just now rose straight\nto her feet and said, 'Good-bye, Mummy, good-bye,' but she is\nasleep now.\" He often called me \" Mummy \" as the child did.\nL. 1145. Auditory.\nThe following account was sent to us by a lady who\nhas had another apparently telepathic experience, printed in\nan earlier number of the Journal. We are asked not to print\nher name, which was given to us in confidence, and we\ntherefore use an assumed name. The percipient writes :\nJanuary 3rd, 1905.\nWe had spent the winter 1896-7 in Egypt for C.'s [her husband's]\nhealth, and we went to Hyeres about a fortnight before Easter.\nThere I left him, being obliged to come to London, and I intended\nto stay over Easter in town, if he continued as well as when I had\nleft him. He wrote cheerfully, describing his daily walks, and telling\nme that he felt very well. I was therefore not feeling anxious\nabout him.\nAbout 1 a.m. on Easter Monday I awoke thinking I heard\nhim call me. I sprang up in great anxiety, feeling sure that he\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.\nwas ill. After a time I persuaded myself that I had only been\ndreaming, and fell asleep again, only to wake a second time in\nthe early morning with the impression again that he was calling\nme. This time I got up, dressed and packed my things, and\nwhen my maid came in with a telegram she found me almost\nready to start. The telegram was \"Come at once.\" Hemorrhage\nhad come on about midnight, and all that night C. had been\nthinking of me and wondering how quickly I could get to him.\nI was able to catch the first train from London and arrived at\nHyeres several hours before the doctor, who had been telegraphed\nfor at the same time.\nMARY CARMICHAEL.\nConfirmation of this can be given by the maid.\nMr. Carmichael died about a year after this incident. Mrs.\nCannichael writes later :\nMarch llth [1905].\nYour letter of January 1 1 th reached me some time after at\nTunis, and I waited until my return home, when I hoped to\nsee the maid and to send you her confirmation of my story. I\nfound her very ill, and she said she had no recollection of any\nthing that happened that morning, all arrangements being so\nhurried. I then feared I could send you no further evidence, but,\nquite by chance, one of my sisters spoke of it, and reminded me\nthat she had been at the station to see me off and remembered\nthe incident perfectly. She has since sent me the enclosed, which\nplease make use of, if of sufficient interest and weight.\nThe note enclosed, signed with the full name of the writer,\nwas as follows :\nMarch 8th [1905].\n. On Easter Monday, 1897, my sister wired for me to come to\nCharing Cross and see her off by the early train, as she was\ngoing to Hyeres. She had been wired for and I was much surprised\nthat she had been able to get off so quickly, until she told me\nshe had been awakened in the night in the way she described.\nThe impression that my brother-in-law was very ill and wanting\nher was so clear that she had got up and prepared for the\njourney before receiving the telegram.\n\fAPBIL, 1905.

You will see that it is one of deferred visual and auditory\nhallucination announcing the death of the apparent agent. The\ndeposition of the percipient and of her husband and daughter is\n\u2022contained in that part of my narrative which begins with the\nwords, \"Now before his death Cavalcante\u2014\" and ends with\n\" \u2014normal cause be found to account for the noise.\" The Riekens,\nso far as I could make out, have never troubled themselves about\nspiritualistic matters, but they gave their evidence frankly and\nwithout reserve. The thing happened and they told me how it\nhappened. The girl looked upon the hallucination merely as a\nproof that her mother was superstitious. Superstition alone does\nnot explain away the coincidence. Telepathic agency is all the\nmore probable for the reason that between Frau Rieken and her\nintended son-in-law there existed much sympathy and affection.\nOn my first visit to Copacabana I examined the room where the\napparition was seen. . . .\nThe account written by Professor Alexander is as follows :\nIn the first half of November, 1904, popular disorders in Rio de\nJaneiro, which were ostensibly a protest against the government\nproject of obligatory vaccination, culminated in the revolt of the\nMilitary School. Marching from their quarters on the evening of\nthe 14th of that month, under the command of General Travassos,\nthe students met and scattered the police force sent to intercept\nthem. The firing took place about 11 o'clock p.m. at the spot where\nthe Rua da Passagem opens on to the Botafogo shore. The neigh\nbouring gas-lamps had been extinguished and the night was very\ndark, so that it is impossible to know the exact details of all that\noccurred. It is certain, however, that one of the first victims of this\nencounter was the alferes-alumno,1 Joao Sylvestre Cavalcante, who\nwas, it seems, wounded in the back as he retired from a parley with\nthe general in command of the police and then killed outright by\na second shot through the head. This occurrence was partly witnessed\n'A military student who in the course of his studies has attained to the\nrank of ensign.\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

CHRISTOVAM, January 24\/A, 1905.\n\"I declare that on the night between the 14th and 15th of\nNovember, about 11 o'clock in the evening, the Military School,\nunder the command of General Travassos, having halted in the Eua\nda Passagem, the alferes-alumno Josio Sylvestre Cavalcante was sent\nby the said general to parley with General Piragibe, who was in\ncommand of the police brigade. Immediately after the parley, as\nthe said alferes-alumno was returning, he was shot in the back by a\nbullet that came from the police brigade. On passing by me he\ntold me he was wounded, and riding (by my advice) to the rear of\nthe School, he fell immediately afterwards, and was dragged for a\nshort distance by the horse which he was riding.\n\" N.B.\u2014When the alferes-alumno Joao Sylvestre Cavalcante was\ncrossing the Eua da Passagem, he was wounded by a Mauser bullet\nin the right parietal [bone], and this shot killed him.\n\"ENSIGN TERTULIANO POTYGUARA.\"\nThis account of the death is said to be current among the military\nstudents who are now detained in the different barracks awaiting\ntheir trial by court-martial.2 One of these, Mario Clementine de\nCarvalho, declares that they left their quarters shortly after 10 o'clock\nand exchanged shots with the police about 11\u2014certainly not later\nthan 11.15. He struck a match, and looked at Cavalcante after he\nhad fallen. The poor lad lay in a muddy gutter, his horse dead on\nthe pavement beside him. The evidence of this witness and others\ndetermines within narrow limits the time of the death. It must\nhave taken place between a quarter to eleven and a quarter past,\nand most probably just about the hour itself.\nNow before his death Cavalcante had become engaged to a certain\nFraulein Maria Luiza Eieken, the daughter of Herr Eieken, a thriving\nmilitary tailor established in this city, and of Frau Louise Eieken.\nThis family lives at No. 20A Eua Barata Eibeiro, Copacabana, and,\nas the fianc6 of the daughter, Cavalcante, who lived close by, was of\n1 Professor Alexander sends us the original Portuguese statement of this\nwitness, as well as his translation of it.\u2014EDITOR.\n2 One of the officers who was with General Piragibe thinks that Cavalcante\nfell at the first shot.

On the morn\ning of the 14th he had returned at 9 o'clock to breakfast, which he\nshared with 'Mirni,' as the young lady was familiarly called. He\nwas in good spirits, and although there was some peculiarity in his\nmanner of taking leave, it is not likely that he had any presenti\nment of his approaching fate. Shortly before, indeed, he had made\nthe hypothesis of his own death a subject for jest. He left Copaca-\nbana never to return there alive.\nNo reports whatever respecting the adhesion of the School to the\ninsurrectionary movement reached the family that day. About 11 p.m.\nby their house clock (which was, however, too slow) a sound of firing\nwas heard from over the hill. But when, in spite of the advanced\nhour, Cavalcante did not return, Frau Rieken felt very anxious, and\nfor some time after she had retired to bed this state of uneasiness\nkept her awake. The room occupied by her and her husband is in\nthe upper part of the house, but as it is a small one and filled with\nlarge-sized furniture, the door is left wide open for the sake of\nventilation.1 She had already heard the clock strike two; it was\ntherefore between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning when she suddenly\nsaw Cavalcante standing at the entrance looking in upon her. He\nleant against the side of the door, his right hand raised and holding\nto the jamb and his left arm behind his back. He did not wear the\nregulation uniform in which he had been killed, but presented him\nself in the khaki undress he usually wore at home\u2014on his head a\nfelt hat with the brim turned down and a rose-coloured neckerchief\nround his neck. He seemed to be covered with mud and his face\nwas overcast with sadness. \" Guarda Mirni,\" he said. (\"Take care\nof Mimi.\") Frau Rieken's first surprise was succeeded by a sense\nof the impropriety of his being in that part of the house at such\nan hour, and she was about to awake her husband. But on looking\nagain the doorway was a blank\u2014Cavalcante had vanished\u2014it was\nbut a vision.\nNext morning, before any news had reached them, she told Herr\nRieken and her daughter of her strange nocturnal experience. Neither\nof them was willing to believe that the vision had any significance.\nOn walking down to the electric-car station at 8 o'clock Herr Rieken\nwas informed of the occurrence of the revolt and of Cavalcante's\ndeath by some young men who were there reading the papers.

APBIL, 1905.\nfirst he gave absolutely no credit to the report, and was convinced\nof its truth only after it had been confirmed by two naval officers of\nhis acquaintance. He proceeded at once to the Military School,\nwhither the body had been transported. In preparing it for burial\nhe cut away the uniform, which, although not the same as that seen\nin the vision, was indeed stained with the mud of the street. The\nshirt underneath was soaked with blood, and a bullet had passed\nthrough the head from one side to the other. Herr Rieken was also\ntold that the lad had been dragged by his horse after he had\nfallen.\nAbout a month later the same percipient had another visual\nhallucination, to which, however, there seems to have been no\ncoincidence in objective events. She saw the young man seated in\nhis usual careless attitude on one of the chairs in her sitting-\nroom.\nCavalcante had nearly completed his course of military studies.\nHe was noted for his application and intelligence, and recommended\nhimself to all who knew him by a most insinuating address. He\nwas nearly 27 years old at the date of his death.\nThe loss of their intended son-in-law has not been the only mis\nfortune which the Riekens have had to bear in recent times. One\nof their children, a boy nine years of age, had been previously killed\nby a passing car. Some three hours before this accident a crash as\nof breaking crockery or bottles had been heard in their store-room.\nOn going thither they found everything in perfect order, nor could\nany normal cause be found to account for the noise.\nFrom this account, which has been carefully drawn up and\ncorrected in accordance with the statements of the various witnesses,\nit appears that the lapse of time between Cavalcante's death at\nBotafogo and its nunciation at Copacabana was roughly three hours\n\u2014probably a little more. For some days there had been disorders\nin town, and both by day and night there had been firing in the\nstreets. Of this nobody was ignorant. But the news of the revolt\nof the Military School spread very late and evidently did not reach\nthe Riekens in the retired spot where they lived. It is an impor\ntant point in the evidence that Frau Rieken told her husband and\ndaughter of her hallucination before any of them had the slightest\ninkling of the events of the night.

A. T. Fryer, of 2 Newport Eoad, Cardiff, sends\nus the following note :\nFrom a comparison of many cases of mental interaction or\nthought-transference, conscious and unconscious, I find that the\namount of information conveyed from agents to percipients is ex\nceedingly small, so small indeed as to resemble the brevities known\nas code-words in telegraphy, where, as every one knows, a single\nword, or even a letter, represents a phrase, and may stand for a\nlong sentence, the code being, of course, previously arranged. No\nexact pre-arrangement of the telegraphic sort can be supposed in\nthe cases with which we have to deal, but yet we are forced to\nadmit the existence of an analogous operation, and to conclude that,\nwhere there is a large amount of information common to two\npersons, an indication of very limited extent serves to illuminate '\na more or less extended portion of the matter of common know\nledge. If a single word coming from A to B serves, apparently,\nto make B see not only a word but a whole scene with innumerable\nincidentals which were not in A's mind, it would appear that B's\nmind acts as the translator of the press telegram does when a brief\nmessage in code has to be worked up into a lengthy paragraph.\nThus a relative once wrote to ask me what had happened to me,\nbecause I had appeared to her and, looking very ill, complained of\na certain injury. Nothing had happened to me, but I was thinking\na good deal of the injury described which had happened to a\nfriend. My appearance was followed by a vision of the figure of\ndeath. I, too, had thought it possible that the said injury might\nresult in my friend's decease. Clearly two words, injured limb,\nand a third, death, were the whole contents of my sub-conscious\ntelepathic message ; the rest,\u2014and there was a very large amount\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.\nof scenic accompaniment not emanating from me at all,\u2014was made\nup by the recipient mind.\nNow a great many other cases show the same features of brevity\nin the agent-mind, enlargement in the recipient, and these are\nsufficient in number to make it desirable that the utmost pains\nshould be taken to discover the exact form, quantity, and quality\nof the originating impulse, and to find how much or how little\nof it was utilised or realised by the recipient. And as minds\nact according to innate or acquired habits, it is important to get\nall the possible instances we can from each person who has had\nmore than one experience of telepathic communication. Persons\nwho visualise their impressions rarely if ever auditise them, and\nvice versd. On the other hand, we should try to discover how\nmuch information is conveyed by the agent-minds, since it is\npossible that some are more communicative than others or able to\nsend more details. But the immediate necessity is to fix the exact\ncontents of the message as received. A. T. FRYER.\nNOTE ON A CASE OF AUTOMATIC INTELLIGENCE.\nKEFERRING to the communication from Mrs. G-arrett Smith\nquoted in the Journal for December, 1904 (p. 309), the sketch\ngiven does not profess to be an exact representation of the\ncurve corresponding to the equation written by the planchette,\nbut only represents her recollection of its general character.\nMr. J. W. Sharpe, of Bournemouth, has been good enough\nto draw out an accurate graph of the curve, and we have pleasure\nin reproducing his drawing here on a reduced scale.\n\fAPBIL, 1905. Note on a Case of Automatic Intelligence. 65\nIt will be remembered that the equation r = a was given\nu\nby planchette, as representing mathematically the shape of its\nown outline or boundary ; the intelligence controlling its move\nments being represented as that of a Cambridge Wrangler.\nWith regard to his drawing Mr. Sharpe observes that the\ncurve does not consist of two sets of spirals, as depicted on\np. 310 of the December Journal, but of two sets of loops, all\npassing through the cusp and touching one another there, and\nall contained within the outer heart-shaped boundary. The\nloops meet only at the cusp and there is an infinite number\nof them. They decrease in area without limit, ultimately\nsinking into the point of the cusp.\nThe equation very well represents the ordinary form of a\nplanchette. But if it had accidentally been reversed into\na\nr = a -\u2014-=, the curve would have been entirely different and\nsma\nentirely unlike any planchette outline.\nMr. Sharpe thinks it very unlikely that either of the auto-\nmatists had ever seen an accurate graph of the equation given\nin their writing. It is of course much more difficult to give\nthe equation to a curve (which was the feat performed by the\nwriting in this case) than, when the equation is given, to draw\nroughly the curve represented by it.\nTHE JOUBNALIST AT LAEGE IN PSYCHICAL\nEESEAECH.\nWITHIN the last two or three years \" ghost stories \" have\ncome to form a staple topic among sensational newspaper\nparagraphs, and it has sometimes been suggested to us that\nthe cases there reported ought to be taken up by the Society\nand carefully investigated. This has occasionally been done\nwith more or less success, and a few of the cases investigated\nhave been printed in the Journal, but the enquiries generally\ncome to nothing, and indeed if we consider the treatment\nconstantly accorded to verifiable topics in the daily papers, we\nshall hardly be surprised at their treatment of topics that are\noften from the nature of the case unverifiable. Yet these reports\nare as a rule received by the public with so little caution\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.\nthat it may be worth while now and then to trace the de\nvelopment of the legends. We give below two cases in which\nwe happen to have had an opportunity of doing this.\nThe first exemplifies the most simple method\u2014that of pure\ninvention. It is the story of the Talking Baby of Bethesda,\nwho just before its death in December, 1903, at the age of\nthree months prophesied that the next year would be a\nterrible year. Mr. Fryer's enquiries into the grounds for this\nstory were reported in the Journal for February, 1904, p. 194.\nThe story\u2014possibly in a modified form as far as the prophecy\nis concerned\u2014cropped up again in connection with the Welsh\nrevival, and Mr. Fryer sends us the following description of\nits origin from the Western Mail of January 21st, 1905, the\nname of the writer \" Awstin \" being known to him, and having\nbeen given to us in confidence.\n\"Awstin\" writes:\u2014When listening, as I have occasionally had to\nlisten lately, to sane and serious men\u2014ministers of the Gospel and\nothers\u2014quoting the tale of the North Wales baby prophet in support\nof their belief that the revival had, among other matters, been fore\ntold, I have been obliged to give, in private conversation, expression\nto somewhat strong condemnation of the folly of introducing such\ntwaddle, and have given my reasons for applying such an epithet\nto the story. I am glad, therefore, that in quoting the extraordinary\ncanard at the request of a correspondent the Western Ma.il a couple\nof days ago did not attempt to emphasise the \" prophecy \" by adding\na moral. Happening to know the father of the supposed baby, I am\nin a position to tell something of the birth and death of the infant\nprodigy and the origin of the joke\u2014for such it certainly originated\nin. Were it not foolishly connected with the revival by people who\nought to know better I would not trouble to interfere now, but it\nis really a pity that superstitious persons should be allowed to lead\nothers astray by means of such sorry stuff. A keen journalist, who\nis often on the look-out for \"sensations,\" met a brother journalist\nin North Wales the night prior to the publication of the remarkable\nprophecy, and asked if there was \"anything going on.\" \"Haven't\nyou heard of the baby prophet?\" asked the other. \"No,\" was the\nreply. \" Where\u2014what is it ? \" The other, in a merry mood, told\nthe story. The first man promptly telegraphed the tale all over the\ncountry. Then next morning the two journalists met again, and the\n\"father\" of the story\u2014if I may so call him\u2014was astonished at the\n\fAPRIL, 1905. The Journalist at large in Psychical Research. 67\nuse made of what he regarded as his good joke. \" Wasn't it true 1 \"\nasked the man who had telegraphed it. \" No,\" was the reply. \" Oh,\nwell,\" replied the other, \"you ought not to have told me, then.\"\nThe inventor of the tale expressed regret that the joke had been\ncarried so far, and the journalist who had made the \" scoop \" wired\na contradiction of the story all over the country. \"But the news\npapers,\" he declared to me, \"did not want the contradiction, and\nthey never used it.\" The baby prophet had been decently buried\nin the first paragraph sent out, and there the matter was supposed\nto have ended. The resurrection has been brought about by other\npeople. The story and its sequel were related to me by the journalist\nwho had been hoaxed.\nIn the second case, the story, which appeared in the Daily\nMail last Christmas Eve and was copied far and wide\u2014even\nby the foreign press\u2014was a more plausible one, and founded\non the more effective method of improvement. It began :\nFrom Brighton comes a story of a haunted house where a ghost\nhas been seen. Brighton's ghost has selected an ordinary two-storied\nhouse in a very ordinary street as its residence. [The writer then\ndescribes the figure of a woman with an awful look on her face\nseen by a lady in the house one evening, and goes on] :\nA gentleman well known in Brighton lived in the house with\nhis wife and children for fifteen months. Sturdy and muscular,\nwith a partiality for mountain-climbing as a pastime, this gentleman,\nwho was seen by a Daily Mail representative yesterday, is certainly\nnot the kind of man to suffer from \" nerves.\"\nHe said that he had not seen the ghost, but a very curious thing\nhappened in the corner of the drawing-room where the figure is\nsaid to have appeared, [viz., that he and his wife heard three notes\nsounded, three times in succession, on a guitar that was hanging\non the wall untouched. The account goes on to say that a barrister\nwith a revolver, a terrier and two friends watched in the house\none night and the three men saw a transparent figure of a woman\nwearing a brown dress. The figure walked up to the wall and then\nvanished.] It is said that some years ago a young woman, driven\nmad by the cruelty of a man, hanged herself in the bedroom of the house.\nOn the strength of these newspaper accounts, the case was\nquoted in the Annals of Psychical Science for last January. The\naccounts were obviously intended to suggest that the incidents\nreferred to had occurred recently ; but they reminded us forcibly\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I saw the account in the Daily Mail some few weeks\nLack, and am bound to say that what little respect remained to me\nfor newspaper accuracy and newspaper morals vanished. Christmas,\n1903, a reporter for the Brighton approached me, saying he was\nwriting a \" seasonable \" column. He had a few cases of local\nhaunted houses, [this one] amongst them, and he asked me to verify\nmy experiences. I did so, and when his little article appeared it\nwas substantially accurate as far as I was concerned. I don't think\nmy name was given. A year later the thing was dished up again\nfor the Daily Mail, and so worded as to make it appear of recent\noccurrence. My experiences were given with an introduction some\nwhat to this effect : \" This gentleman, who was seen by our\nrepresentative yesterday, said,\" etc., etc. Readers of the Daily\nMail could scarcely imagine that they were reading of events\n15 years old; nor would they think that the gentleman who was\nseen yesterday was only \"seen\" across the width of a crowded\nconcert room when not a word passed. I found out afterwards\nthat the writer of the Daily Mail article is the reporter for the\nBrighton , and he had dished up his 12 months old Brighton\narticle for the London daily; and then I recalled that he had\n\"seen\" me yesterday at a school entertainment, where I had gone\nto see my little daughter's calisthenics and he had presumably\ngone to report. We were on opposite sides of the room and\nnodded ! You are quite right, the newspapers do \" sometimes bring\nout an old story as if it were an entirely new one.\" . . .\nG. ALBERT SMITH.\nIt may be added that the newspaper account of the suicide\n(\" a young woman, driven mad by the cruelty of a man,\") hardly\ntallies with the evidence given at the inquest. The person who\ncommitted suicide was a Mrs. M. R, aged 42 years, a lodging-\nhouse keeper then occupying the house. \" The cruelty of a\nman \" is a touch added by the journalist.\n\fNo. CCXIX.\u2014VOL. XII.

SYDNEY OLIVIER, C.M.G., read a paper on \" Some\nNormal Extensions and Intensifications of Conscious Percep\ntion.\" Mr. Olivier apologised in advance for what might\nappear the triviality of much of what he should say and its\nsuperfluity as a contribution to the Society's proceedings.\nHis observations would have a plausible show of relevance\nonly to certain of the more cautious generalisations that have\ncommended themselves to the Sadducee wing of the Society,\nand even so would have little claim to novelty. Nevertheless,\nwhilst the Society has collected a great mass of record, and\nsifted much evidence in regard to abnormal phenomena, the\nPresident's address at the last General Meeting clearly acknow\nledged how moderate after all is the result towards enabling\nus to coordinate those phenomena with the normal impressions\nexperienced through the faculties we consciously employ every\nday. And looking only towards those phenomena for which\nmost are content to account without any spiritistic hypothesis,\nit must be admitted that telepathic impressions, veridical\nhallucinations and apparitions of various types, remain for\nus still like detached island craters on a volcanic rift or\nlike outcrops of a metallic lode which we believe our\nselves to have already in practical exploitation elsewhere,\nand which we are convinced must be really continuous.\nThe paper aimed at calling into consideration some normal\nevocations of subliminal consciousness of which we have\nfrequent experience. Such extensions and intensifications are\nfamiliar to us all, as material for observation and reflexion :\n\fMAY, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 73\nthe abnormal experience cannot be counted on, but if, and in\nso far as, the normal points in its direction, it may be profit\nable to study it more persistently.\nSuch experiences are commonly and may be deliberately\ninduced by what we call the Fine Arts, by sympathetic\npersonal relations, by Love, and by Religion. To begin with\nthe Art that addresses itself to the sense of sight, a sense\nmost obviously relevant to much of the Society's special\ninterests. When we look at a Dutch realist painting, or a\ntopical picture such as Mr. Frith's \" Derby Day,\" we see\nwhat is there on the canvas and what was, or is to be pre\nsumed to have been, before the eyes of the painter. When\nwe look at a landscape by Monet we see what is not painted\non the canvas, but was there to be painted. When we see\nan old woman painted by Rembrandt or a street-girl scrawled\nby Forain, we see equally what is not painted or drawn and\nwhat, further, was not there at all to be seen in the common\nsense of the word. We seem to have passed into something\nvery like the sphere of hallucinations.\nThere are different modes of seeing. First, in the ordinary\nsense, a conscious perception produced by the impact of\nether-vibrations upon the retinal nerves, the content of which\ncan be partially checked by photography. At the other end\nof the scale there is that purely imaginary seeing in which,\nby effort of will and memory, one calls up a pictorial\nimage \" in one's head.\" Between these range such impres\nsions as those experienced by a clairvoyant medium or in\ncrystal-gazing, which are much more real in effect, and\nthose still more real-seeming experiences of completely external\nised hallucinations of waking vision, indistinguishable in their\neffect from sight in the common sense of the word. The\nsubject of these has no hesitation in using the verb to see :\nindeed it is often only through afterthought and reflection,\nif at all, that he comes to say \" I must have imagined it.\"\nAn artist is one who sees, in the first, everyday sense,\nmore than the average and is more powerfully impressed by\nhis seeing. But he is more. He is a medium : an inter\npreter in a specialised degree between the sub-conscious and\nthe sensible. The vivid particular stimulus of his special\nsensibility not only produces in him abstraction and quasi\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.\nhypnotisation in regard to other interests, but throws him,\nin greater or less degree and with varying certitude, into a\ntrue exaltation or ecstasy, involving an extension of conscious\nness beyond the common tide-marks, so that his sight becomes\ninsight and his technique creation. And the impression made\nby a masterly work of art, if we are attuned to receive\nit, is not detailed, nor the result of analytical observation :\nit is massive and seems to arise quite irrationally out of\nsub-conscious perturbations. The particular state of feeling\nin the artist that impels him to, and accompanies art-\nproduction, is reproduced in us (in varying intensity) with\nout conscious, rational, analytical identification of the details\nthat reproduce it. The details, in fact, were not the\nimportant thing to the artist : the differentiating and deter\nmining thing was his feeling. A great part, if not the\nwhole, of the art of painting consists in such selection of\ndetails as will allow the sub-conscious conveyance of the\nfeeling embodied in the picture. The picture will then, and\nthen only, be truly seen ; and much of the seeing will be\nof the nature of a hallucination.\nThe efficacy of music in deepening consciousness and\nclarifying certain perceptions is even more conspicuous than\nthat of visible art. Eichard Wagner's essay on Beethoven,\nelaborating and applying Schopenhauer's theory of music, and\nto be read with his theory of hallucinations, is a pre\neminently suggestive exposition of the metapsychics of music.\nThe particular achievement of music to which the speaker\ndesired to call especial attention is its faculty of establishing\nsympathetic relations between individual minds. Every art\ndoes this in so far as it succeeds in freeing the consciousness\nfrom its habitual engrossments. But music has the reputa\ntion of being pre-eminently the food of love and the handmaid\nof religion because of its exceptional efficacy in hypnotising\nthe every-day consciousness and giving scope for activity to the\nsub-conscious personality, which, as it thereupon receives new\nimpressions into consciousness, gives them forms which are de\ntermined by the influences immediately acting upon it, so that\nsub-conscious attunements and reciprocal reaction of personali\nties become a conscious sympathy and a felt attraction.\nThe signification attached to the idea of \" sub-conscious\n\fMAY, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 75\npersonality \" or \" subliminal self \" in connexion with the\nargument of this paper formed the subject of a digression\ntoo long to summarise, leading on to the consideration of\nphenomena of sympathetic personal rapport. A perfectly\nnormal effect of the association of certain persons is to re\ninforce the mental faculties, or particular faculties, of each of\nthem, as the power of an optical glass is reinforced by the\naddition of a lens. This is a normal experience in that it\noccurs more or less unmistakeably to most people : but it is\nnot for most people a very common experience, which is the\nreason why one notices it and is sure of it as a fact when\nit does occur. The relation of the two minds may make itself\nfelt by apparent experiences of thought-transference, or rapid\nand instantaneous intelligence on the faintest hints or sug\ngestions, or merely by the stimulation and extension of self-\ncontained faculty in each.\nFalling in love is one of the most common and significant\ninstances in which a certain mode of hypnotism introduces\nnot only a kind of hallucinations, but also telepathic\nsensibility, great enhancement of direct mental rapport, ex\ntension and intensification of consciousness and marked\naccession of energy and faculty, sometimes to an extra\nordinary degree and with most substantial results. This is\ntrue of love in general : but the characteristics are most\nfamiliarly exhibited in the specialised form of love between\nthe sexes. The specialised sex-attraction, however, is only\none of the many hypnotic agencies affecting the developments\nof consciousness which come into range in this relation. Even\nthe beauty which the lover, in all relations of love, imputes\nto the person loved, is in a degree hallucinatory, just as are\nthe intelligence, the wit, and the other exalted qualities that\nwe discover in our particular friends. But the hallucination\nhas a \" veridical \" basis, and the lover is always more in\nthe right than are outsiders to whom the sub-conscious touch\nis not vouchsafed. It cannot be disputed that love, whether\nquickened thus by sex or race-relation, or standing full-\ngrown in the liberty of its own nature, can see the form and\naspect of the personality it embraces with a truth of sight as\nfar beyond that of others as is the truth of sight of one of\nthe great painters of personalities. All love is hyperaesthetic,\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.\nparticularly, perhaps, that of mother for child: the imaginations\nof lovers with regard to their reciprocal sensibility are certainly\nnot wholly baseless.\nNext to love, religion is the most important of the common\nmodes of extension of conscious perception. Professor W. James\"\nHibbert Lectures on \" Varieties of Eeligious Experience\" may\nbe referred to as indicating the place of this topic in rela\ntion to the idea of this paper. Without desiring to advance\nanything as to the ultimate source and significance of religious\nexperience, it is important to emphasise that the dogmas and\nrituals of all popular religions are Art-forms of varying genius\nand crudity : essentially hypnotic symbols, whose function is\nto give scope for the incarnation of elements of the sub-con\nscious self. We need a very careful graduated survey of the\nmethods by which this extension of consciousness is induced,\nand the influx manifested of what, under these conditions,\nat one end of the scale is identified as Divine Spirit, and at\nthe other exhibits characteristics indistinguishable from those\nimputed as peculiar to the Author of Evil. The series of\nthe manifestations stretches unbroken from the Dervish to\nthe Salvationist, from the African Witch-Doctor to West\nminster Cathedral.\nIt is in the crudities of aesthetic, amatory, and religious\nimpressions that we catch the normal person in the act of\nexperiencing extensions of consciousness, suddenly surprised\nout of himself and formulating his new experience. There\nwill be vagaries in his formulation ; he will hear, see, feel,\nand be convinced according to his idiosyncrasy. But his formu\nlation, the thing he believes himself to see, hear, feel, or know,\nwill have some real relation to the influence that produced it.\nThe arrest of the superficial consciousness by Art, natural\nbeauty, or other of the great sympathetic influences gives\nliberty of expression to the direct, subsensory impression,\nwhich can then itself be brought up into the world of sense\nand expressed in aesthetic or rational formulas. A com\npetent treatment of aesthetics from this point of view would\ndo much towards enabling us to see the connexion between\nthose abnormal visions which have a true psychical basis and\nour normal sense of sight.\nAt the conclusion of the paper, a discussion followed.\n\fMAY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 77\nTHE MEDIUMSHIP OF ME. C. BAILEY.\nIN the Beport of the Council for the year 1904, printed in\nthe Journal for March, 1905, reference was made (p. 46) to a\nprofessional medium, Mr. Bailey, whose performances in\nAustralia, especially in the production of apports, have become\nwidely known in the spiritualistic world. Dr. C. W. MacCarthy,\na medical man residing in Sydney, held a number of sittings\nwith Mr. Bailey there, and afterwards published an account\nof them in a pamphlet entitled, \" Rigid Tests of the Occult \"\n(reprinted from the Harbinger of Light, Melbourne). He\nsent this pamphlet to us, together with original letters from\na number of the sitters confirming the statements made in his\nreport ; also a selection of the apports,\u2014chiefly coins and clay\ntablets,\u2014produced at the sittings, with the request that we\nshould submit them to experts in England for an opinion as to\nwhether they were what the medium stated them to be, viz.,\ngenuine ancient coins, Egyptian, Hindoo, etc., and Babylonian\nor Assyrian tablets.\nWe may first describe briefly the conditions under which\nthese apports are stated in Dr. MacCarthy's pamphlet to have\nbeen produced. Tsvo series of sittings were held,\u2014in March,\n1903, and in June and July 1903.\nOf the first series, six sittings were held at the Queen's\nHall, Pitt Street, Sydney, and two at Dr. MacCarthy's own\nhouse, the sitters being in all cases selected by Dr. MacCarthy\nand his Committee. It was agreed upon beforehand that Mr.\nBailey should be carefully searched before each sitting by two\nor three of the sitters and then enveloped in a bag, leaving\nhis head and hands free, the bag to be tied closely around\nthe wrists and neck and then sealed, and the seals to be\nexamined after each sitting. This bag was provided by Dr.\nMacCarthy. It was also arranged that care should be taken\nto prevent Mr. Bailey's having free access to the stance room ;\nthat the door of the room should be locked prior to and during\neach sitting, and that the key should be kept by some one\nselected by Dr. MacCarthy for the purpose. The seance room\nalso was as a rule carefully searched beforehand, and in some\ncases the sitters were searched as well as the medium, as a\nprecaution against possible collusion.\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.\nIn the reports of the separate sittings few or no specific details\nare given as to the searching of the medium (except in the case\nof the second sitting held at Dr. MacCarthy's house), and in\nonly two cases, besides this last-mentioned sitting, are the\nnames of searchers mentioned ; but the account seems to imply\nthat different searchers were selected each time.\nA general description of the method of searching is given\nlater on in the pamphlet, pp. 37-39 ; no specific statement is\nmade here as to which of the medium's clothes were removed,\nand it may be noted that the accounts of the searching given\nin different places in the pamphlet vary considerably. There\nseems no doubt, however, that as a general rule (see pp. 37\nand 100), only the outer garments were taken off and searched,\nand that the sitters contented themselves with feeling and\npressing the under-garments and the body of the medium\nthrough them ; nor, as a rule, were the boots and socks taken\noff (p. 38). The under-garments are incidentally described\nlater on (p. 103) as \"web under-pants and a flannel bandage\nworn for medical reasons.\" Dr. MacCarthy states explicitly (p.\n103) that he, \"with other sane people,\" considered the complete\nremoval of the clothes entirely unnecessary and only consented\nto it on one or two occasions \" in order to give no loophole\nto outsiders.\" He observes also that in general this point\nwas \" not considered of importance by the searchers.\" The\nsearch of the body, if carried on according to the ideal described\n(p. 101), seems to have been fairly complete.\nAll the sittings of the first series were held in the evening,\nbeginning at 8 p.m., and the amount of light was arranged\nas directed by the \" controls,\" the light being almost invariably\nextinguished before the apports were produced and not turned\nup until the \" control \" announced that he had \" got something.\"\nThe summary that follows relates almost exclusively to the\napports.\nAt the first sitting no apports were produced. At the second\none, held on March 6th, 1903, the following appeared: a live\nbird sitting on a nest ; three clay tablets, said to have been\ntransported on the spot from the site of Babylon, some stones\nsaid to be Burmese rubies, and an Egyptian scarabaeus.\nAt the third sitting, on March 9th, three objects were\nheard to fall, with a good deal of noise, on the floor ; then\n\fMAY, 1905. . The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 79\nseven coins were handed to Dr. MacCarthy, and described by\nthe \" control \" as \" valuable ancient coins brought from\nEgypt,\"\u2014some ancient Eoman and some ancient Egyptian, of\nthe Greek period.\nAt the fourth sitting, on March llth, a small live bird\nappeared, also a clay tablet, which broke on falling to the\nground.\nAt the fifth sitting, on March 1 3th, the \" control \" handed\nto Dr. MacCarthy a sea-crab. Soon after, when the light\nwas turned on, a shovel-nosed shark, about a foot and a half\nlong, was seen in the hand of the medium, and on the table\na quantity of wet sea-weed. On the light being again\nextinguished, some ancient coins were produced.\nThe next sitting was held at Dr. MacCarthy's house on\nMarch 16th, when some coins, said to be Ptolemaic, were\nproduced, also a clay object, 5 or 6 inches long, said to be\na \" Babylonian cylinder,\" and a newspaper in strange characters\nsaid to be Arabic.\nOn March 17th, the sitting was held at Queen's Hall,\nas before ; the Hindoo control now performed what he described\nas \" some Hindoo magic.\" On a piece of paper about the size\nof a face he drew rough outlines of eye-sockets, nose and\nmouth. He then put it on a piece of black cloth on the\ntable, and arranged a cardboard lamp-shade over it. On the\nlight being turned out, this paper face or skull was seen to\nbe luminous, and became brighter and brighter. The control\ntook up the lamp-shade with the black cloth and paper\nskull and passed it round the circle for the sitters to see.\nThey all saw plainly \" a luminous object resembling a human\nskull,\" and one lady on seeing it fainted. The control\nremarked that if this had not happened he would have\ncaused the paper skull to leave the lamp-shade and float about\nthe room. Next a sound as of a falling stone on the table\nwas heard, and this was said to be a piece of gold ore.\nThen something soft fell on the table, described by the\ncontrol as an Indian cake, which had just been taken out\nof an oven in India. When felt it was found to be \" still\nhot.\"\nThe last sitting of this series was held on March 19th\nat Dr. MacCarthy's house. It had been agreed between him\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.\nand one of the controls (\" Dr. Whitcombe \" x) that if possible\nsome simple jewels or old coins should be produced at this\nsitting. Accordingly, some time after the the sitting began,\nthe light having been turned up, the Hindoo control raised a\nlittle fan which had been left for his use on the small table\nbefore him (as, the report here states, had been the custom\nat the other sittings) and underneath it a number of precious\nstones, mostly uncut, were seen. These were distributed to\nthe sitters. The light was then extinguished, and soon after\nthe rattle of coins was heard. The light being next turned\non, a number of ancient coins, said to be Egyptian, were\nproduced.\nFollowing the report of these sittings, the pamphlet gives\na summarised list of the apports,\u2014especially the clay tablets\nand cylinder, with descriptions of the figures and inscriptions\non the latter by the control \" Dr. Eobinson \" (who was said\nto have been professor of Syro-Chaldaic literature in the\nTheological Seminary in New York2), and translations by the\nsame control of the inscriptions. Illustrations of many of the\napports are also given.\nAt the second series of sittings, Mr. Bailey was placed in\na sort of cage, instead of in the bag previously used. This\ncage was a square wooden frame, 6\u00a3 feet high, 4 feet long,\nand 4 feet broad ; the top and sides were covered with mos\nquito netting and the cage was placed over the medium\n(after he had been searched) and then screwed down to the\nfloor.\nThe first four sittings of this series were again held in\nthe Queen's Hall, Sydney, apparently under the same general\nconditions as before. At the first, on June 1st, 1903, two\nlive birds and a bird's nest were produced ; one bird and\nthe nest mysteriously disappeared, the other bird remaining.\nAlso an Indian cap, with gold and silver wire embroidery,\nand eight Ptolemy coins were produced.\n1 Dr. MacCarthy in a letter to us says that the Medical Directory (British)\nfor 1875 gives \" Whitcomb, Hy. Moroney, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia,\nM.R.C.S., Eng. 1857.\"\n2 In a letter to us, Dr. MacCarthy says that he has verified most of the\nstatements about Dr. Edward Robinson from the Imperial Dictionary of\nUniversal Biography, London, 1868, Vol. VI., p. 829.\n\fMAY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 81\nAt the second sitting on June 4th, the apports were : a\nlive bird, ten ancient coins, a newspaper from Scinde, in\nArabic characters, Hindu language, and a leopard skin rug,\n3 feet 1| inches long and over 2J feet wide at the shoulder,\nsaid to have been brought from a bazaar in Delhi. The\nthird sitting was for materialisations.\nAt the fourth sitting on June llth, the covering of the cage\nwas made more secure, and the medium, after being searched,\nwas placed in a bag inside the cage. The apports then pro\nduced were : a live bird, a nest with one egg, sixteen coins,\na shrub about 5 ins. high. The bird and coins were left,\nthe other objects disappeared.\nAt the next sitting held at Dr. MacCarthy's house on June\n15th, the cage alone was used.. The apports were: a pair of\nsatin slipper shapes, silver embroidered in Indian fashion, four\ncoins, a shrub 4 or 5 ins. high, which afterwards dis\nappeared, and . a number of cut jewels.\nThe next sitting was again held at Dr. MacCarthy's house\non June 20th, under similar conditions to the last. The\napports were : a bird which disappeared, a bird's nest, ten\ncoins.\nThe next sitting, on June 25th, also held at Dr. MacCarthy's\nhouse, seems to have been the only one at which, during the\nsearch, all the medium's clothes were taken off. He was then\nre-dressed in other clothes, not his own, also searched, and\nthen taken into the stance room and, \" as usual, placed in\nthe cage with a chair, small table, and fan \" (it is not stated\nin the reports of the previous sittings that these objects were\nplaced in the cage with the medium, but the phrase used\nhere, p. 109, suggests that this was the custom throughout).\nA small flower-pot was also put in the cage. The apports\nwere : three moon-stones, eight coins, a small plant in the\nflower-pot.\nAt the next sitting at Dr. MacCarthy's house, on July 3rd,\na pair of the largest size boxing-gloves were\u2014without previous\nwarning\u2014placed on Mr. Bailey's hands, after he had been\nsearched and put into the cage. It was supposed that these\ngloves would prevent the medium from manipulating or\nabstracting hidden articles from his clothing. Two strings\nwere tied on each wrist, one round the glove and the other\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

After some preliminary talk the light\nwas put out ; and almost immediately a hard thing was\nheard to fall inside the cage, and a few seconds later a\nsecond hard thing fell. On the light being turned up the\nmedium was seen with the gloves on and two clay tablets\u2014\none broken\u2014were seen on the floor by him. It was then\ndecided to take off the gloves, after examining them to see\nthat the seals were unbroken. Mr. Bailey was instead put\ninto the bag inside the cage, which was again screwed down\nto the floor. The following apports were then produced : two\nlive birds, a bird's nest, 14 coins, an Egyptian scarabseus,\nand a plant about 5 ins. high.\nThe next sitting described took place before this one, viz.\non July 1st, also at Dr. MacCarthy's house, the medium being\nthen only put into the cage after being searched. The apports\nwere : two clay tablets, a Bedouin Arab woman's head-dress,\na witch-doctor's belt, and a \" magic \" plant about 6 ins. high,\nwhich afterwards disappeared.\nThe remainder of the part of the report relating to apports\ndeals with cases that occurred \" spontaneously \" in full day\nlight or gaslight, not at sittings, and when the medium had\nneither been searched previously nor was under any control\nat the time. For reasons not explained, the investigators\nappear to have considered these cases no less remarkable nor\nevidential than the cases of apports produced at sittings. These\napports consisted of:\n(1) Several clay tablets, as a rule larger than those pro\nduced at the sittings, the latter being from 2| to 3J ins.\nlong, and If to 2\u00a3 ins. broad, and the former from 3\u00a3 to 4\u00a3\nins. long, and 2J to 3f ins. broad; (2) a number of coins\nand precious stones ; (3) two turtles, one small enough to\nbe placed in a cap, the second a \" good-sized \" one.\nWe quote from Dr. MacCarthy's pamphlet a few typical\ninstances of these apports; some of which may be held to\nsuggest that Mr. Bailey is not unacquainted with certain well-\nknown conjuring tricks.\n(P. 5) I may here mention that on the same day [March 6th,\n1903], about 11.30 a.m., another tablet of a somewhat similar nature,\n\fMAY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 83\nbut having on it two figures in bas relief, fell in broad daylight\ninto my study in presence of the Sensitive and myself, the Sensitive\nhaving been suddenly controlled by the Hindu in the course of\nconversation with me. The tablet in falling, struck and indented\nthe edge of a piece of mahogany furniture. This remarkable\nphenomenon was no doubt made possible by the perfect sympathetic\nlink and other favourable psychic conditions at the time between\nthe Sensitive and myself.\n(P. 121) EXTRACT FROM MR. R.'s DIARY.\n\"June 2, 1903. Called at Mr. X[Dr. MacCarthy]'s house.\nFound Mr. Bailey present After some conversation between Mr. X.,\nMr. Bailey and myself, I noticed that Mr. Bailey was going under\ncontrol Dr. Whitcombe took possession, and subsequently the Hindu\nAbdul, both controls talking to us in a general way.\nAfter about half an hour the medium became normal. Saying\nhe felt cold he sat before the fire and warmed his hands. He\nremarked his feet were cold, and pulled off one boot and felt his\nfoot. Replacing the boot he sat down again, and leaning forward\ntowards the fire he placed his hands over the blaze. Instantly,\nwhile both his hands were still over the blaze, something was heard\nto strike the back support of the wooden chair upon which he sat,\nand I distinctly saw fall upon the floor at his right a clay tablet.\nI picked it up and found it to be quite damp. There was some\nfigure on the flat side. On the right back support of the chair we\nfound a fresh dint where evidently the tablet had struck.\nI consider this to be a fine test of Mr. Bailey's mediumship. There\nwas no possibility of his throwing the tablet, as his hands were over\nthe fire. The room door was closed and only we three within. I\nwas standing next to the medium, and in such a position that I\ncould have at once seen any manipulation. Mr. X. was standing\nbeside me. I was between him and Mr. Bailey, and the tablet\nstruck the chair on the side away from both of us, so that neither\nMr. X. nor myself could possibly have thrown it in such a position\nhad we chosen.\"\nDECLARATION.\u2014I declare the above details are truly given.\n(Signed) X.\n(P. 126) My bedroom, Thursday, June 11, 1903, 12 noon.\nA medical friend, Dr. F., and myself sat with Mr. Bailey, he\nsitting in front of the window, we sitting close to him.\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.\nHindu Abdul controlled. I said : \" Will you bring my friend,\nDr. F., something 1 \" He replied : \" Me try.\" Looking upward he\nslowly raised his left hand, the palm being in view, the fingers\nseparated. Still keeping his gaze fixed upwards, he grasped at some\nthing in mid-air, and opening his hand when in the act of lowering\nit, before it was lowered, and without bringing the other hand near it,\nwe saw in it a Ptolemy coin. N.B.\u2014Palming was precluded, the\npalms being in evidence, the fingers separated. Sleeving was im\npossible because of the still raised position of the hand when opened,\nand the non-inclining of fingers towards the sleeve. Other sleight-of-\nhand means were impossible, because of invariably slow movement\nand non-contact with other hand, the body or clothes.\nDECLARATION.\u2014The above particulars are correctly given.\nF.\n(P. 127) Miss S., who was present with the Sensitive and myself,\nrecords this sitting as follows :\u2014\n\" Having been promised by the Hindu, Abdul, two stones for a\nring, I came by appointment to the house of Mr. X. on Monday,\nJune 29, 1903, arriving about 4.20 p.m. Mr. Bailey arrived at\nthe same moment. We both came in together, and went straight\ntogether to the room for the sitting, where we expected Mr. X. to\njoin us. He had gone out and had not yet returned. Mr. Bailey\nsat on a chair close to the window, and about two yards from the\nfireplace. We chatted until Mr. X. arrived, about half-past four.\nThe three of us then sat close together. Suddenly Mr. Bailey was\ncontrolled by Abdul, who addressed in some foreign language an\ninvisible person whom he called Selim. He said Selim had gone\nfor the promised stones. In half a minute or so he said : ' They\nhere now ; me not catch them in hand ; you might think me had\nthem there. Where you think they are?' We could not guess.\nHe went over to the mantelpiece and, while we stood by, he lightly\nlaid hold of the top of a stethoscope resting on it, lifted it slowly\nup and there were the two stones underneath. He then sat again\non the chair (a large arm chair), we opposite to him, and while\nchatting to us with his hands on his knees, there fell at his right\nside, apparently from a height, judging by the force of the fall,\nsix coins. We picked them up. They were thick coins, covered\nwith various Oriental inscriptions. ...\"\nThe articles sent by Dr. MacCarthy for our examination\nwere described as follows :\n\fMAY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 85\n(A) Apporis :\n(a) Coins: (1) packet containing one ancient Persian, one\nancient Grecian, one modern Cairo, and twelve old Indian coins ;\n(2) packet containing twenty-one Ptolemy coins ; (3) packet\ncontaining eleven Roman coins, of the early Christian period,\nand one scarab.\n(b) Clay tablets, seventeen in number. Of these, seven, in\ncluding the \" Babylonian cylinder,\" were produced at the first\nseries of sittings. The marks on them are described as inscrip\ntions, of which the control Dr. Eobinson professed to give\ntranslations, which are printed in the pamphlet ; one was said\nto be a copy-book tablet ; another a tablet of weights and\nmeasures ; and a third has on it the figure of a \" lion-headed,\neagle-footed man.\" A long translation is given of the alleged\ncuneiform writing on the Babylonian cylinder.\nThe tablet that fell in Dr. MacCarthy's study on March\n6th, 1903, (see above) is also included ; it has on it two figures,\nalleged to represent \" Bel Merodach casting out Tiamut, the evil\nspirit.\"\nOf the remaining tablets, four were produced at the sittings\nof the second series, two on July 3rd and two on July 1st\n(see above) ; the other five were produced \" spontaneously,\" not\nat sittings. One of these came while Mr. Bailey was warming\nhis hands over the fire in Dr. MacCarthy's house on June\n2nd, as described above. It has on it a figure of the upper\nhalf of a man's body. Another one fell in the Queen's Hall,\nSydney, in full gas-light, and was broken in the fall. The\nremaining three have figures on, described respectively as\nSennacherib sitting on his throne, a winged Assyrian bull, and\nthe Assyrian Hercules strangling a lion.\n(B) Other objects :\n(a) A series of excellent photographs of the above and of\nthe other apports described in the pamphlet ; also a photograph\nof Mr. Bailey, and one of a corner of the stance room\nshowing the cage- covered with mosquito netting and the\nwindow and fire-place similarly covered.\n(&) A small piece of the mosquito netting used for covering\nthe cage.\n(c) The bag used to secure the medium in the second series\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.\nof sittings. This is made of stout black sateen, in the shape\nof a night-shirt, closed at the bottom and with long wide sleeves.\nThe body part is made of a single piece, folded once, and the\nsides sewn together to form a bag. Each sleeve is also made\nof a single piece, with one seam on the under side, and is let\nin to the body part close to the top, the shoulder seam being\ncontinued into a gusset at the neck. A piece of tape is run\ninto a hem at the neck, to be drawn up and tied round the neck\nwhen the medium was in. Similarly there is a wide hem at\nthe end of each sleeve, arranged for a tape to be run in, in\nsuch a way that when this tape is pulled up tight and tied\nround the wrist, the remainder of the hem projects beyond it\nas a sort of frill, a little over an inch wide.\nThe security of this bag as a means of control depends\nexclusively on the tightness of the tapes round the wrists and\nneck. Supposing that the medium could draw one hand\nbackwards out of the wristband (and it must be remembered\nthat he had both hands free to work with), he could with\ndraw the arm through the sleeve into the main part of the\nbag, could then take up any object he had hidden there on\nhis person or in his clothes, and could push this out through\nthe hole at the end of the sleeve into his other hand, and\nthen get the first hand into position again. We have verified\nthis by experiment with the bag, and a friend of ours\nfound another method by which, if the string round the neck\nis at all slack\u2014as it is almost certain to be\u2014objects can be\nproduced out of this bag by a person tied up in it.\nIt is also very doubtful whether the boxing gloves used\non July 3rd (see p. 81 above) would have prevented manipula\ntion of concealed objects by the medium. Their large size\nmust have tended to prevent the strings being tied very\ntight round them, and it seems by no means impossible\nthat the medium should have withdrawn one hand, leaving\nthe glove dangling on his wrist by the second string, and\nthen got his hand back into the glove again. The strings\nand seals would in that case remain intact.\nWith regard to the apports, Sir Oliver Lodge obtained from\nexperts at the British Museum the following statements :\n\fMAY, 1905.

Bailey. 87\nDEPARTMENT OF EGYPTIAN AND ASSYRIAN ANTIQUITIES,\nBRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON, W.C., 8th March, 1905.\nMY DEAR SIR,\nIn the absence of Dr. Wallis Budge I beg to acknowledge\nthe receipt of your letter enclosing photographs of a collection of\ncoins and of some supposed antiquities. The coins are genuine, but\nare not of any value or rarity. I have shown the photographs of\nthem to Mr. Rapson of the Dept. of Coins and Medals, and\nenclose the report he has written. All the supposed Babylonian\nand Assyrian antiquities are forgeries. They fall into three classes :\nI. Seven of the tablets have figures upon them. These have\nbeen suggested to the forger by well known sculptures found at\nKuyunjik (Nineveh) and Khorsabad. They have probably been\ncopied from the illustrations in Layard's \" Nineveh and Babylon \"\nand \"Nineveh and its Remains.\" What are intended for cuneiform\nsigns at the sides of the figures are not genuine.\nII. The six tablets without figures upon them are intended\nfor Babylonian or Assyrian inscribed tablets, but are very clumsy\nimitations.\nIII. The cylinder is not genuine, though it has been made by\na cleverer forger than the other objects.\nThere is a scarab among the Ptolemaic coins, and this may be\ngenuine, but it is not possible to tell from the photograph. This\nis the only one of the objects that it would be worth while to\nsend here for examination.\nWith regard to the photographs ;\u2014shall I return them to you\n\u2022or would you like Dr. Budge to see them 1 He will probably be\nback from Egypt next week.\nI am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully,\nLEONARD W. KING.\nDEPARTMENT OF COINS AND MEDALS,\nBRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON, W.C., 8th March, 1905.\nThere is nothing rare or valuable among the coins.\nThe copper coins of the Ptolemies may be obtained from the\ndealers for a few pence each.\nOf the oriental coins, the following modern states are re\npresented :\u2014Haidarabad, Indore, Baroda, Nawanaga, East India\nCompany. There is one Sassanian coin, and one modern Egyptian.\nThere is nothing of any value or rarity. The same remark applies\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Budge himself wrote later to Sir Oliver Lodge as\nfollows :\nDEPARTMENT OF EGYPTIAN AND ASSYRIAN ANTIQUITIES,\nBRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON, W.C., 14th March, 1905.\nDEAR SIR,\nMr. King has shewn me the letters which you sent here\nduring my absence, and also the photographs which you submitted.\nI have read his remarks to you, and I am fully in agreement with\nhim. The photographs are from poor copies of well-known objects\nand drawings, and the things from which they were made are\n\"forgeries,\" similar to large numbers which I have seen in Baghdad,.\nKazmain, and parts of Persia. They resemble the work made by\nJewish dealers in those places and in Southern Russia. . . .\nI am, yours very truly,\nE. A. WALLIS BUDGE.\nOn April 18th, the Secretary took the clay tablets and coin*\nto the British Museum to show to Dr. Budge. He reiterated\nthe opinion he had formed from the photographs, which he\nsaid were amply sufficient to enable an expert to judge of\nthe nature of the objects. He also showed the Secretary\na number of spurious tablets in the Museum, which were\nvery similar to those produced by Mr. Bailey, but as a rule\nmore skilfully and elaborately worked.\nThe current number of the Annals of Psychical Science contains\na careful account by M. Cesar Vesme of the sittings held\nwith Mr. Bailey in Italy last summer, and we propose to\ngive in the next number of the Journal a report by Mr.\nA. W. Dobbie of some other sittings in Australia.\nCORRECTION.\nA correspondent has kindly pointed out to us an error in-\ncalculation in the April Journal (p. 57). It was there stated\nthat Mr. C.'s experience at about 8 p.m. on December 7th\noccurred about 13 hours after Mr. W.'s death at midnight on\nDecember 6th at Bombay.

The names and\naddresses are given above.\nThe monthly accounts for March and April were presented.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 125th General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nlarge Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Thursday,\nMay llth, 1905, at 4.15 p.m.; Sir Oliver Lodge in the\nchair.\nTHE PRESIDENT, PROFESSOR CHARLES EICIIET, read a paper\nentitled \" Quelques Observations de Clairvoyance.\" He re\nmarked that well authenticated cases in which some degree\nof acquaintance with foreign languages was shown auto\nmatically by persons who had not acquired that knowledge\nby normal means rarely, if ever, occurred.\nAfter eliminating from his consideration certain cases in\nvolved in the mist of legend, he referred to the example\ngiven by M. Flournoy. His medium, Helene Smith, tran\nscribed, with many mistakes, some words of Sanscrit without\nbeing able to make intelligible sentences out of them. But\nM. Flournoy had well explained that she had probably\n\" absorbed what she knew of Sanscrit \" by glancing at a\ngrammar which was kept in a room which she had occasionally\nvisited.\nThe matter of which the speaker was about to treat was\nthe writing of phrases, sentences, even of pages of Greek\nby a person who did not know Greek. The person who had\nwritten these Greek phrases in a state of somnambulism or\nof half-consciousness was a lady 34 years of age, who was\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCNE, 1905.\nnot a professional medium. He would call her Mme. X.\nHe first saw Mme. X. in Paris in November, 1899, their\ncommon friend, Mr. Frederic Myers, having arranged the\nmeeting. On that occasion Mme. X. almost lost conscious\nness, and in a state of trance, her eyes closed, wrote with\ndifficulty in pencil a sentence in Greek. It was really two\nsentences run into one, and it contained certain mistakes.\nMme. X. wrote slowly and painfully, and with a sort of\nconvulsive trembling. On awakening she seemed to have no\nrecollection of what she had written. The sense of the\nfirst sentence written was, \" Human wisdom is of small\naccount, and, indeed, is nothing.\" The sense of the second\nwas, \" I am already about to leave you.\" He did not know\nwhether the first sentence was to be found in the classical\nauthors ; the second, which he at first believed to be in the\nNew Testament, occurred in Plato, at the end of the Apology\nof Socrates. Some days afterwards, being again in a trance,\nMme. X. wrote some more Greek words, signifying \" Greet\ning ! I am the all-powerful (?) I speak through Antoine\nEenouard. Give thanks to God.\" Antoine Benouard was the\nname of M. Eichet's great grandfather, Antoine Augustin\nEenouard, publisher and book-collector in Paris (1770-1853),\nwho had published several editions of Greek authors. Some\nother communications, also signed by him, were given at\nabout the same time\u2014in November and December, 1899.\nAnother sentence was written in Greek by Mme. X. in the\nmonth of June, about 7.30 p.m. They were in a small\nroom together, and the sun was setting. The sentence trans\nlated was, \" When the sun is declining or rising, the shadows\ngrow longer.\" This sentence, he afterwards found, appeared\ntextually in the Greek-French and French-Greek dictionary of\nByzantios and Coromelas, published at Athens in 1856 (first\nedition, 1846). For a long time no other Greek phrase was\ngiven, but in 1904 another sentence, which was found later to\nappear in the same dictionary, was forthcoming. Subsequently\nMme. X. sent him a communication written in Greek, in four\nparts of unequal length, and in characters of unequal size.\nIt was discovered, almost by accident, that the first part\nwas a translation of a passage in Paul et Virginie. It was\nimpossible to find a Greek translation of Paul et Virginie, so\n\fJUNK, 1905. General Meeting. 93\nhe addressed himself to Dr. Vlavianos, of Athens, telling him\nwhat he wanted and why he wanted it. Dr. Vlavianos replied\nthat three of these Greek passages were to be found textu-\nally in the dictionary of Byzantios and Coromelas, and sent\nhim the dictionary, of the existence of which he was up till\nthen entirely ignorant. In the MS. of Mme. X. there were\nerrors which did not appear in the original. Latterly in his\npresence Mme. X. had written quite a long sentence similar to\nthe others, and derived from the same source\u2014the dictionary\nof Byzantios.\nProfessor Eichet expressed himself as being absolutely\nconvinced of the good faith of Mme. X. Her MSS. were\nin modern Greek, of which, as of ancient Greek, she was\nentirely ignorant. Moreover, she had, as far as she knew,\nnever seen the dictionary of Byzantios until after all the\nphrases written by her and contained in the dictionary had\nbeen written. In addition to this, the mistakes made by her\nin writing Greek were such as no one acquainted in the\nleast with that language, even a beginner, would make. She\nwrote Greek like a person who did not understand it. Her\nwriting was in a trembling hand, just as would be that of a\nperson who did not write Greek fluently, but had copied it\nwithout being able to read it, as if from a representation\nwhich she had before her. For this and other reasons which\nhe detailed, and which had perhaps no less force than his con\nfidence in Mme. X., he considered the hypothesis of fraud\u2014\nlearned, complicated, prolonged, astute, implying the possession\nand the study of Byzantios's book\u2014as being absurd. The\nhypothesis of unconscious memory, as well as that of spirits,\nhe also examined and expressed himself unable to accept.\nThere was, however, no reason to ignore the facts, merely\nbecause any explanations that could be offered were absurd\nor insufficient. It was better to say simply that we were\nin the presence of the unexplained.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE in commenting on the remarkable case\nof Mme. X., said that it was important to observe that the\nerrors in the Greek quotations given by her were in all\ncases such errors as a person might make in transcribing\nsymbols that for him were meaningless. Everything, of course,\nmust depend in such a case upon the good faith of the\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOKE, 1905.\nmedium, on which, however, Professor Eichet had every\nreason to depend. He further drew an analogy between this\napparent power of Mme. X.'s and the power possessed by\ninfant prodigies of carrying out artistic and intellectual per\nformances which they certainly had not learnt in the ordinary\nway. In particular he referred to the case of the Spanish\nchild Pepito, who, at two years of age, played on the piano\na tune which he had heard his mother play. When perform\nances of this kind were rationally explained, he thought we\nmight understand such a case as Mme. X.'s.\nMRS. VERRALL said that the President's paper seemed to\nthrow some light on her own experiments in the same direc\ntion. As to the quotations given by Mme. X. being subsequently\nfound in a book to which she was not aware of having had\naccess, she (Mrs. Verrall) had come across the same curious\nand seemingly suspicious characteristic in her own experience.\nShe referred to a case mentioned in a paper she had read\nbefore the Society last year,1 when a Greek quotation was\nobtained by means of table-tilting, a reference being given\nto Heliodorus, where they afterwards found the substance,\nbut not the exact words, of the automatic message. The\ndifference between this case and that of Mme. X. was\npresumably due to the fact that the mediums in the former\ncase were well acquainted with the language, while Mme.

PODMORE observed that he could not quite agree with\nProfessor Eichet that the theory of unconscious memory was\ninadequate to explain Mme. X.'s ease. Professor Eichet had\nalready mentioned the somewhat similar case of Helene Smith,\nand there were a few other examples on record ; e.g. the\ncase given by Mesnet 2 of the soldier who, after being\nseverely wounded in the Franco-Prussian war, relapsed\ninto an automatic state, in which he once wrote with his\neyes bandaged a consecutive letter on half-a-dozen different\nsheets of paper, the sheets being removed successively after\nhe had written a few lines on each, when he always con\ngee Journal for June, 1904, Vol. XL, p. 249.\n2 For a fuller account of this case, see Journal, Vol. IX., pp. 230-231.\n\fJUNE, 1905.

On reaching the final\nblank sheet, he went back to the top of the page and\ninserted stops and corrections, etc., in the places where they\nwould have fallen had he written throughout on the last\nsheet, thus showing that his memory had retained the\ncomplete picture of what he had written, and was able to\nreproduce it.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT said that it would be interesting to\nlearn the conditions under which Mme. X.'s writings had\nbeen produced, and whether there was any reason for suspect\ning unconscious guidance by any of the sitters during the\nexperiments. He recalled one case of a person, ignorant of\neither Latin or Greek, who wrote various phrases in both\nthese languages when her shoulder was touched by an\nexperimenter well acquainted with them. He thought, how\never, that the evidence accumulated up to the present tended\nto prove that something in the nature of clairvoyance actually\ndid exist; it was the only satisfactory solution he had so\nfar been able to find for some of the phenomena associated\nwith the Divining Eod.\nTHE PRESIDENT, in replying to the various comments made,\nsaid in answer to Professor Barrett's question that there\nhad not in any case been contact between Mme. X. and\nany sitter while these writings were produced.\nOBITUARY.\nC. C. MASSEY.\nTHE Society has recently lost through the death of Mr. C. C.\nMassey one of its earliest and most valued friends. Though\nin recent years he had taken no active part in the Society,\nin its early days he was one of its most zealous and generous\nsupporters. Mr. Massey in fact formed one of that small\ngroup of friends, of whom, alas, I am nearly the only one\nremaining, to whom the foundation and early guidance of\nour Society are due. It was in his rooms we used to meet\nfor consultation and Committee work, and to his generous\nhospitality and ungrudging expenditure of time we were con\nstantly indebted.\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1905.\nA profound student both of philosophy and psychology,\nand one of the most original and suggestive thinkers I have\never known, it is deeply to be regretted he has left behind\nhim no work to make his name more widely known and\nadmired. Scattered papers from his pen are to be found in\nthe many volumes of Liyht, an occasional paper in our Pro\nceedings and in Mind, a printed essay here and there ; these\ngive no adequate idea of the width of his reading nor of the\noriginality of his thought. His name will, however, ever be\nheld in grateful memory by English students for his admirable\ntranslation and annotation of Baron Carl du Prel's great work\non The Philosophy of Mysticism, published in two volumes by\nG. Eedway in 1889. To this work Mr. Massey added a\nmost suggestive chapter by way of a Translator's Preface,\nfrom which I should like to quote if space permitted ; but I\ntake this opportunity of begging those of our members who\nhave not read l)u Prel's work, at any rate to read the\npreface which Mr. Massey has added ; a copy of the book is\ncontained in our Library.\nBut beyond and above his intellectual gifts and his passion\nate love of truth were the sweetness and beauty of his\ncharacter. One of the most unselfish and lovable of men,\never modest and retiring, yet with a rare and resolute moral\ncourage, he was outspoken in espousing unpopular causes when\nhis judgment convinced him they were right ; he was indeed a\n\"Just and faithful knight of Uod.\"\nHis death is to me and many others who had the privilege\nof his intimate friendship the great personal loss of an\naffectionate, large-hearted, and true friend.\nCharles Carleton Massey was born December 23rd, 1838,\nat Hackwood Park, Basingstoke, the residence of his grand-uncle,\nLord Bolton. His father, to whom he was devotedly attached,\nwas a well-known member of Parliament, Under Secretary for\nthe Home Office and Chairman of Committees during Lord Pal-\nmerston's administration, and afterwards Minister of Finance for\nIndia ; and on his return from India became member for Tiver-\ntou. C. C. Massey was educated at Westminster School, studied\nlaw, and was called to the bar. He rapidly gained a consider\nable practice for so young a man, but his supreme interest\n\fJUNE, 1905. Obituary : C. C. Massey. 97\nwas the study of philosophy and psychology, especially of\nthose transcendental phenomena which now engage the at\ntention of our Society. So great was his devotion to these\nsubjects that he threw up his practice and gave his time\nwholly to long and laborious study of the literature of this\nsubject in all countries, especially the vast storehouse of\nIndia. He only returned to the bar on the occasion of the\nfamous trial of Slade ; this medium he considered had been\nmost unfairly treated by Professor Eay Lankester, and hence\nin the spirit of true chivalry he took up the defence without\nfee and at great personal inconvenience and self-sacrifice.\nSubsequently, after Professor Zollner had published the results,\nof his prolonged and careful investigation of Slade and em\nbodied them in his well-known work on Transcendental\nPhysics, Mr. Massey translated the volume into English,\nadding a lengthy and instructive preface of his own. He also,\ngave to English readers a translation of E. von Hartmann's\nSpiritism.\nDuring the last twenty- five years Mr. Massey, who never\nmarried, had lived in chambers in Victoria Street, Westminster,\nbut much of his time was spent at the Athenseum Club, of which\nhe had long been a member. His death, on the 29th March\nlast, was due to heart-disease, from which he had been suffering\nthe last few years. His medical attendant, Dr. Simmons, of\nAshley Gardens, writes to me as follows :\nMr. Massey was practically under sentence of death the last two.\nyears, and his heart was only kept going by avoidance of all exertion.\nHe was most wonderfully brave throughout, made no fuss, and always\nconsidered other people more than himself. I kept him alive for\na month by hypodermics of strychnine twice daily. He had very\nlittle actual suffering and lived his own life to the end, got up\nand dressed almost every day, and retained all his faculties to\nthe last. We had many long talks together, and my daily inter\ncourse with him for weeks before his death has been one of the\nmost valued experiences of my life. I often felt I was doing\nhim poor service in keeping him alive, when I felt convinced I\nwas only putting off the day of his birth into a life which he\nwas so peculiarly fitted to appreciate and enjoy. He often wondered\nhow, the body being gone, with all its multitudinous attachments\nand interests dependent upon its physical nature, what would take\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1905.\nthe place of the physical world and give the mind material to\nwork upon. This seemed curious to me, as he lived here on\nearth so much in an intellectual and spiritual atmosphere that\nthe body must have been to him a fetter ; existence and com\nmunion with friends, as he doubtless now knows, is likely to be\nfar more perfect without it.\nA month or two before his death 1 wrote to Mr. Massey\nasking him if he had put his scattered writings in a form suit\nable for publication, and whether he would allow some of his\ncorrespondence with myself and other friends to be published.\nHis reply was characteristic, deprecating his own share in any\noriginality of view, and giving me his matured thoughts on\nhuman life here and hereafter ; an extremely touching and\nbeautiful letter, which some day I hope will be printed.\nIn a brief notice such as the present it is impossible to quote,\nas one is tempted to do, from the many admirable contributions\nMr. Massey published in Light. I would, however, draw special\nattention to his paper entitled \" The Application to Spiritualism\nof Scientific Research,\" published in Light for February 5, 1887.\nIn this paper Mr. Massey points out how few scientific in\nvestigators of spiritualistic phenomena consider that their own\nco-operation in the production of these phenomena may be a\nnecessary part of their manifestation. Obviously the first duty\nof every scientific enquirer should be to see what are the proper\nconditions necessary for the elicitation of psychical phenomena,\nwhich are as dependent on their mental environment as physical\nphenomena are on their material environment. The force of a\nsuspicious environment in preventing, or of a frigid environment\nin inhibiting, psychical results, is not more improbable than the\n\u2022effect of a damp or dusty environment in preventing the excita\ntion of a Holtz electric machine. The circumstance that we\nnow happen to know the reason for the latter and do not\nknow the reason for the former, is no excuse for the wholly\nunscientific neglect, and even ridicule, of the part played by\n.the investigator as well as by the medium. These elusive and\nperplexing phenomena can never be studied by those who\nimagine they are only called upon to play the role of an\namateur detective. On the other hand, the habit of calm and\ndispassionate investigation, the cautious and critical spirit of\nscientific enquiry, must not be relaxed ; and those who combine\n\fJCNE, 1905. Obituary : 0. C. Massey. 99\nthe dry and clear light of science with the kindly and sym\npathetic spirit need never fear that their investigations will\nbe either barren or useless.\nIn his later years Mr. Massey directed much thought to human\npersonality and its relation to the great Cosmos. Assured as\nhe was of the survival of personality after death, he nevertheless\nbecame convinced that the phenomena of spiritualism neither\nafforded, nor could ever afford, evidence of what we desire and\nmean by immortality. In this I wholly agreed. \" No external\nscience,\" he writes to me, \" can demonstrate immortality nor\neven raise a sure inference of it : the interest of many in\npsychical research no doubt rests on its possible results in\naffording such a demonstration ; this I hold to be an illusion,\nand feel almost bound to enter a speculative protest against it.\"\nWhat our investigations do teach us, and it is a transcendent\ngain to our knowledge, is that life and intelligence can and\ndo exist in the unseen, and that here and there a strong prima\nfacie case exists for connecting such intelligence with discarnate\nhuman personalities. But there is no experimental evidence\nto show that the complete integrity of the personality is pre\nserved after death ; the evidence, in fact, is all the other way ;\nstill less is it possible for such evidence to establish the im\nmortality of the soul, that is to say, its persistent survival and\nexpanding consciousness throughout the infinite future. Hence\nMr. Massey was led, as many others by far different paths\nhave been led, to the profound conviction that only through\nwhat he was in the habit of terming the \" process of the Cross,\"\nonly through self-surrender, can self-realisation be truly attained.\nW. F. BARRETT.\nCASE.\nL. 1147. Dream.\nThe following case was obtained for us by an Associate\nof the Society, Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of Gkmville and Caius\nCollege, Cambridge, and most of the confirmatory evidence was\ncollected by his efforts. The percipient, Mrs. Mann, writes\nas follows :\nKING'S FIELD, CAMBRIDGE, February lltli, 1904.\nOn the night of Friday, January 22nd, 1904, I had a vivid\ndream.\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1905.\nI saw my old friend, Dr. X., who left Cambridge about 10\nyears ago, and I had not seen him since, sitting by my side. He\ntook hold of my hand saying, \" Why have you not been to see\nme ? \" I said, \" Oh ! I've been so busy that I've not been able\nto get away. You are so altered since I saw you last.\" \" Yes,\" he\nsaid, \"but that is so long ago.\" He then disappeared. The dream\nso impressed me that I told it to my husband at breakfast the\nnext morning, Saturday 23rd, and also to a friend who knew the\ndoctor on the 25th.\nOn Saturday morning, the 30th, my husband at breakfast said\nhe had received a memorial notice of Dr. X.'s death, which took\nplace on the 23rd instant, the day after my dream.\nS. MANN.\nA. H. MANN.\nMrs. Sidgwick writes :\nNKWNHAM COLLEGE,\nCAMBRIDGE, February 12th, 1904.\nI called on Mrs. Mann this afternoon and she kindly talked very\nfully about her experience. It was distinctly a dream, but a very\nvivid and realistic one. It was brought to an end by her awaking.\nIn the dream she and Dr. X. seemed to be sitting on a sofa\u2014\nit might have been the one in her drawing room\u2014and they talked\njust as they used to do, his voice and manner unchanged. He had\nbeen her medical attendant . . .; but he gave up his practice and\nretired some 10 years ago, leaving Cambridge, and she had not\nseen him since, though her husband had. ... In the dream his hair\nand whiskers, which had been dark iron grey when Mrs. Mann\nlast saw him, were white. There had been no mention of Dr.\nX. in conversation, nor had Mrs. Mann been thinking of him, and\nshe knows of nothing which would have been likely to suggest the\ndream. She is quite sure that the dream occurred on the night of\nFriday, January 22nd, and I think her recollection of this is indepen\ndent of her knowledge of the date of the death, though she has nothing\nvery definite to remember it by. She told it on Saturday morning to\nDr. Mann and in the course of the day to Miss C . It was Miss\nC who on February llth wrote out the account of it, which Dr.\nand Mrs. Mann signed. On Monday, January 25th, Mrs. Mann\ntold the dream to Miss T , and she has promised to ask her\nto write an independent account. She showed me the memorial\nnotice of Dr. X.'s death on January 23rd.

As she was then unwilling to make any statement on\nthe matter, I may perhaps be allowed to mention that I had a short\nconversation with her several weeks after the event; and that she\nthen spoke of Mrs. Mann's dream as curious, and showed that\nshe was at that time ignorant of the doctor's death. Unfortunately\nthe conversation was interrupted before I had an opportunity of\nasking for her corroborative evidence.\nI have also seen a pencil note that Dr. Mann made in his diary\nunder the date Saturday, \" January 23rd : X.

In the first\ncase thf- 'xeerJllection was revived through a dream. This\nseems;-to. -be the most usual method, and we have from time\nto 'tkjie \"printed instances of it, see, e.g. Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,\n. $p\\ $8 1-3 90. In the second case, the lost memory was, as it\n.'\u2022.appears, recovered through automatic writing, which would\nnaturally happen far less frequently, since it is, of course, far\nless common to write automatically than to dream.\nThe first case was obtained through Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of\nGonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from Mr. L. G. Eeed,\nof King's College, Cambridge.\nMr. Eeed writes :\nJanuary 25th, 1905.\nIn the summer of 1901 I went into camp with the Durham\nL. I. Volunteers. Whilst there I took some photographs which I\ndeveloped at home when I came back. The negatives were roll\nfilms, and were neglected for some few days owing to stress of work.\nWhen a fellow Volunteer asked me for a photograph I could not\nfind the films in my photograph cupboard, nor did a thorough\nsearch in all possible drawers and cupboards bring them to light.\nThis was aggravating, for my friends would ask for prints very\nfrequently.\nAt last they slowly began to give up asking, but about a month\nafter I lost the negatives, another request reminded me of their\nmishap, but as they were given up for lost, I thought no more\nabout it.\nThat night I had a vivid dream ; in fact, I am not subject to\ndreaming, and I never remember having dreamt so \"well\" as to\nremember much about it next day. But I did remember this one\nin detail.\nI dreamt that I knew where the negatives were, that I went and\nfound them there, and that I was not at all surprised at the occur\nrence. Next morning I woke with the dream in my mind. I went\nimmediately to my father's wardrobe, took down an old coat, which\nat times I wore indoors, and drew out the missing negatives. I\nfelt certain they were there, but could not think how they came to\nbe there. I felt I was merely repeating what I had done in my\n\fJUNE, 1905. Automatic Revivals of Memory. 103\ndream. As I never remember carrying negatives in my coat pockets\nat any time, or even putting them in any pocket, the circumstance\nthat in the dream I \" knew \" that they were there is interesting.\nNo one in the house remembered placing them there, and consequently\nI had no previous suggestions from them concerning the coat.\nL. G. REED.\nMrs. Sidgwick adds :\nNEWNHAM COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, February -27th, 1905.\nI have seen Mr. Reed, who was introduced to me by Mr.\nStratton. He is an undergraduate at King's. It seemed clear on\nquestioning him that latent memory is the most probable explana\ntion of his dream of the whereabouts of the lost films and I\nthink he has rewritten the account since I first saw it so as to\nmake this evident. ELEANOR M. SIDGWICK.\nThe second case comes from Mrs. A. G. Dew-Smith, who\ndescribed it first in a letter to Mrs. Verrall as follows :\nMarch 3rd, 1905.\n. . . You remember I told you that I had lost two latch-keys of\nthe outside door here, and was much bothered. After I got back\nI instituted a drawer to drawer search which went on for several\ndays without success. I felt my subconscious ego knew quite well\nwhere they were, as I remembered that I had put them away\nin some safe place\u2014only keeping one out. . . . The other night\nI had a sort of impulse to write and asked where my keys were,\nand my pen wrote \"Dodsworth\"\u2014the name of the manager of the\nflats. I thought it most unlikely that he could throw any light\non their whereabouts ; but as I met him in the lift the next day\nI said, \"Do you remember those three keys you gave me of the out\nside door?\" \"I only gave you one,\" he said, \"you asked me\nto keep the other two, and I have got them.\" I had completely\nforgotten this, and thought \"Dodsworth\" so outside the mark that\nI should not even have asked him but for meeting him just after.\nMrs. Verrall informs us that Mrs. Dew-Smith had told her of\nthe loss of the keys while on a visit to her from February\n21st-23rd, 1905.\nIn reply to further questions Mrs. Dew-Smith writes :\nMarch Uth, 1905.\nMr. Dodsworth had in the first instance given me the keys, but\nI had so completely forgotten that he had (on my suggestion) kept\ntwo back, that I remembered (or thought I did) putting them away\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1905.\nmyself. During my search, which went on for a month or two,\nMr. Dodsworth's having anything to do with their loss did not once\noccur to me, and except to ask him to provide two more, I should\nnot have thought of applying to him. So I do not think it could\nhave been either \"a shrewder guess at what might have occurred\nthan I was able supraliminally to make,\" nor \"merely a piece of\ngeneral advice\u2014when in difficulty apply to Mr. Dodsworth,\" but\nfar more likely a case of revived memory. ALICK DEW-SMITH.\nNOTES.\nREADERS of the Journal may remember that in the February\nand March numbers of this year, we noted the fact that the\nfirst volume of Mr. Myers's Human Personality had been\nincluded in the list of books recommended for 1905 in the\nsection Metaphysics in the Fellowship Course of Trinity\nCollege, Dublin. We now learn from one of our members,\nProfessor Eric Drew, of Madras University, that the University\nof Madras had already adopted Human Personality as a text\nbook to be read for the M.A. two years' course in Psycho\nlogy. Professor Drew writes : \" Myers's work was considered\nso important that even before publication, which was later\nthan expected, the book had been set as a subject for 1905.\nIts publication just allowed time for its reading. [The] 1905\ncourse was fixed in 1903, before the book was out.\" He\nsends us the three hours' examination paper set on the book\nin the Madras M.A. Degree Examination of January, 1905.\nIn course of time\u2014perhaps sooner than some of us are\nnow prepared to expect\u2014we may find the book recognised\nsimilarly by Mr. Myers's own University of Cambridge (to\nwhich, by the way, Madras is affiliated), though the recog\nnition may probably be delayed by the general historical\nprinciple that a prophet is without honour in his own country.\nWe have received an interesting communication from a\nlady\u2014not a member of the Society\u2014who writes from the\naddress Newbattle Terrace, omitting to give the name of the\ntown. If by chance any one of our members happens to\nknow to what town this address belongs, we shall be much\nobliged if he will send word of it to us, so that we may\ncommunicate with the lady.\n\fNo. CCXXL\u2014VOL.

F. Barrett in the chair.\nThe REV. A. T. FRYER read a paper on \" Psychological\nAspects of the Welsh Revival of 1904.\"\n\fJULY, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 107\nThe paper opened with a reference to two difficulties attached\nto S.P.E. work, viz. inaccurate observation by witnesses, and the\nunwillingness of persons who have had abnormal experiences\nto relate them, or to permit examination of the evidence, this\nbeing especially the case with events of a spiritual order.\nAs order and law obtain in all other departments of creation,\nit was felt by the writer to be improbable that they should\nbe wanting in psychical or spiritual action. An account was\nthen given of the rise of the Kevival in 1904, first at New\nQuay, Cardiganshire, and subsequently in more developed form\nat Loughor, Glamorgan, with some notice of the aid given by\nthe press towards spreading interest in the movement. Then\nfollowed a brief biography of Evan Roberts, the most promi\nnent of the Revivalists, whose methods have been followed\nby others. Evan Roberts was classed with the mystics of\nthe Spanish and English school, his visions being somewhat\nlike those of Juliana of Norwich. The place occupied by\nprayer in creating the atmosphere of the Revival and affect\ning numerous minds was described and the observations of\none who had attended various services read. The guiding\nvoice to which Roberts gives implicit obedience was shown\nto be similar to the accounts of Socrates and his Daemon\nquoted in Human Personality by Mr. Myers ; and this part\nclosed with the relation of instances of successful prediction.\nThe eloquence in prayer observed on the part of many\nunlettered persons was shown to be in agreement with\nthe Welsh character. In the conversion of people the\nfear of hell seems not to operate with many as a motive.\nInstances were quoted of changes of countenance after con\nversion. Brief notice was paid to a narrative from a Welsh\ncollier who had, previous to his conversion, read widely in\npsychological literature. Cases of apparent telepathy were\nreported, in one of which the impression was visualised, with\nseveral instances of auditised impressions. An interesting\naccount was given of a convert who claimed to have\nexperienced a conversation with the Holy Spirit, with\nvarious visions similar in character to visions that occurred\nto persons elsewhere. Lunacy has not been increased by\nthe religious excitement, the percentage of cases at the\nGlamorgan County Asylum due to that cause being no\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.\nhigher in 1904, last quarter, than in previous years. The\nlights, objective and subjective, that have been seen by\nvarious persons, mostly North Walians, formed an important\npart of the inquiry. Cases of all descriptions were quoted,\nand the conclusion reached was that the sub-conscious memory\nof physical lights around the coast of Tremadoc Bay formed\nthe material used by the imagination, excited by religious\nservices and influences, in the formation of subjective appear\nances. A lengthy account was read of a well-attested \"light\"\nincident in the Ehonddafach. Reference was made to Mr.\nBeriah G. Evans' recent articles in the Occult Review. The\npaper closed with an appeal to members to give attention to\nspiritual phenomena.\nMR. SYDNEY OLIVIER observed, in regard to Mr. Fryer's\nreference to the racial differences between North and South\nWales, that in South Wales the psychical phenomena reported\nseemed to be mainly auditory and in North Wales mainly\nvisual, and asked if Mr. Fryer thought this generalisation\njustified.\nMR. FRYER replied that he did not think the facts reported\nwere sufficiently numerous to generalise from.\nMR. E. T. STURDY enquired whether any reports had been\nmade of luminous emanations from the bodies or heads of\ncertain persons in connection with the phenomena of the\nRevival.\nMR. FRYER answered that he had not met with any such\nreports.\nTHE HON. EVERARD FEILDING asked whether he was right\nin understanding that Mr. Fryer, in discussing the difference\nbetween objective and subjective lights, meant to suggest that\nif persons were born in a certain district where objective\nlights caused by some unusual physical condition occurred\nand then migrated to another district, their recollection of\nthese lights might induce in them subjective hallucinations\nof lights ; and did Mr. Fryer think that this explanation\nmight apply to the case he had quoted of a doctor and his\nwife who saw a light above the roof of a chapel where Mrs.\nJones was preaching ?\nMR. FRYER replied in the affirmative to both these\nquestions.\n\fJULY, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 109\nME. FEILDING said he had recently been told by a friend\nthat in a particular district of the Highlands lights, apparently\nof the same kind as those reported in Wales, were not infre\nquently seen by peasants, who regarded them as in some way\nforewarnings of death. His informant had seen them twice\nhimself, and on one occasion a light corresponding closely\nwith those mentioned in connection with Mrs. Jones of\nEgryn had preceded his mother when driving in a carriage.\nIn one case a peasant stated that he had seen a light enter\nhis house and settle on a table. The lights generally occurred\non damp autumn evenings, a fact which suggested that there\nwas some physical cause for them. He thought it very\ndesirable that a geologist or other scientific expert should\nexamine the part of the coast where the Welsh lights had\nbeen seen, in order if possible to ascertain what, if any, was\ntheir physical basis. That there must be a physical basis\nfor at least some of them seems clear from the fact to which\nMr. Fryer had referred that Pennant, in his Tour in Wales\nover two hundred years ago, speaks of lights of unexplained\norigin being common along this part of the coast.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT concurred in thinking that the phenomena\nof the lights deserved more attention than they had received\nfrom scientific men. He pointed out the antiquity of refer\nences to such phenomena, which were to be found e.g. in the\nworks of St. Augustine. The tradition of the nimbus might\nalso have taken its rise from appearances of a somewhat\nsimilar nature. The Welsh Revival showed many features\nin common with other revivals in the past, e.g. those initiated\nby the early Quakers and by the Wesleys ; in all these cases\nthere was possibly a telepathic element at work in the exten\nsion of impressions from one person or group of persons to\nothers.\nTHE MEDIUMSHIP OF ME. C. BAILEY.\n(Continued from, the May Journal, p. 88.)\nIN the Journal for May last, an account was given of sittings\nheld by Dr. MacCarthy with Mr. Bailey at Sydney. We\nnow give some further reports of other sittings by one of\nour Australian members, Mr. A. W. Dobbie, of Gawler Place,\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOLY, 1905.\nAdelaide, South Australia, with extracts from some of Mr.\nDobbie's letters on the subject.\n. Mr. Dobbie writes:\nADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, December 19tt, 1903.\n. . . Mr. Bailey is a man of very ordinary capacity and plain educa\ntion who earns his living by keeping a small laundry in conjunction\nwith his wife in No. 8 Murphy Street, South Yarra (a suburb of Mel\nbourne), Victoria. A very wealthy gentleman, a Mr. Stanford, who\nhas an office at the corner of Bourke and Russell Streets, Melbourne,\nhas taken him in hand during the past twelve or eighteen months, and\nhas had spiritualistic seances with Mr. Bailey twice a week under\nsupposed test conditions. Mr. Stanford, as a favour, allows friends\nand visitors in whom he has confidence to attend. He very kindly\nfirst showed me a great number (about 100) different apports or\narticles which professedly had been dematerialised and brought\nthrough space, . . . and gave me a free invitation to attend the\nseances any time I happened to be in Melbourne at the time. I\nattended two or three; but the searching was not done at the\nstances I attended. Mr. Stanford said that he had done so\nabout seventy times, and considered it was unnecessary to do so\nany more. A number of ladies and gentlemen in Adelaide paid\ndown 10\/- each and got Mr. Bailey to come to Adelaide and\ngive us a few stances. They were held in a private house of a\ngentleman who was prepared to swallow everything that came\nalong, so we who desired test conditions were not able to get\nthem. The sittings were held ; but did not give general satisfaction.\nThe control professed to take a fancy to me, and made some\ncomplimentary remarks, and referred to my \"magnetism being an\nacquisition to any circle,\" etc. On the strength of those remarks\nI ventured to ask the control to allow me to test him. I\nremarked that it was possible for the Hindustani writing which\nhe produced in the dark to be open to the objection of the\npossibility of the writing having been done previous to the sitting,\nand then asked him to write something at my dictation in Hindu\nstani. He replied by saying that at the next seance he would\nwrite at my dictation in any language I liked. I thought this\nwas a large order, and had my doubts. At the next seance he\nsaid : \"I promised to write something at your dictation, but at\nthe next stance I will write something at your dictation in three\nlanguages\u2014Sanscrit, Persian, and Hindustani.\" I felt disappointed\nand suspicious, but had to submit. Before the date arranged for\n\fJULY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. Ill\nthe next seance he returned to Melbourne, so that was another\ndisappointment.\nA few weeks afterwards I visited Melbourne and called at his\nhouse to claim a private sitting which he voluntarily offered me\nwhen he was in Adelaide but went away without doing so. I\nfound him in bed not well, so had to postpone it again. At a\nsubsequent visit I obtained the long-promised sitting, and will now\ngive you the results. When he became controlled he said, \"I\npromised to write you something in Hindustani, but I will do so\nin Nepauli, which is a better test.\" I ventured to remind him\nthat he originally volunteered to write for me in any language,\nand then in three languages\u2014Persian, Sanscrit, and Hindustani,\nbut now he had come down to one. However, I wrote a\nsentence and handed it to him, and he immediately started\nscribbling on the paper (this was in broad daylight in a splendidly\nlighted room, at three o'clock), and handed it to me. I then\ntold him that I originally wanted him to write in Hindustani,\nand that my friend who was going to translate the sentence for\nme might not know Nepauli; so I asked him to write me a\nsentence in Hindustani. He hesitated, and then said, \" Well, let\nit be short.\" I at once wrote a short sentence and handed it\nto him. He then professed to write it in Hindustani Urdu, and\ngave it to me. On my return to Adelaide I took it to my\nfriend Mr. Garthwaite, a retired Indian Civil Service officer, who\nfor twenty-five years had been chief school inspector in India,\nand was conversant with about twenty-five dialects of India, but\nnot Nepauli. He assured me that the writing was not Hindustani\nUrdu. I then sent the writing to the British Resident in\nNepaul, India, and asked him to translate the sentences for me.\nHe returned them, telling me that in both cases they were\n\"meaningless scribble,\" and were neither Nepauli or Hindustani\nUrdu. So much for the test experiment up to that point. I\nsent Mr. Stanford the British Resident's letter, and also told him\nthat Mr. Garthwaite said the same thing. Mr. Stanford was much\nsurprised, and wrote saying that he could not understand it, but\nthat possibly there was some explanation for it. About three\nmonths afterwards he sent me a professed translation by an educated\nHindoo, who was in Melbourne. However, that only made matters\nworse, because the translation made my sentence to be an altogether\ndifferent thing to what I wrote; so the experiment was a complete\nfailure from beginning to end. . '. .\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.\nJanuary 20th, 1904.\n. . . Since last writing ... I have succeeded in engaging the same\nmedium (Mr. Bailey) to come to Adelaide to give us five sittings\nunder the same stringent conditions [as at Sydney], except that\nhe would not strip naked, because doing so in Sydney gave him\na severe cold and laid him up for a week or more.\nHe arrived in Adelaide the week before last, a day behind his\ncontract time, and in a very jaded condition on account of the\nworry of selling up his furniture, etc. The result was that the\nsittings were not nearly so successful as those in Sydney and\nMelbourne. I send you two photographs illustrating the cage in\nwhich we placed the medium after he had been carefully searched\nby a doctor and another equally intelligent gentleman in my\npresence and also that of other members of the committee appointed\nto conduct the proceedings. After searching, we placed him in\nthe bag and carefully sealed the strings, and placed him in the\ncage as you see him in the photograph. The sitters, including\nthe committee and searchers, were also searched. Under those conditions\na live bird (but we only saw the small head), some ancient coins,\na small peepul tree (grown in a pot with earth from my garden\npreviously put in the cage) supposed to be grown from a seed\ntransmitted from India during the sitting, all appeared inside the\ncage. Also a bird's nest with one egg. . . .\nThe report of these sittings was written by a member of\nthe committee, Mr. J. W. Gellert. At the first sitting, held\non the day Mr. Bailey arrived at Adelaide, the medium, after\nbeing searched by two medical men, was put into a bag as\nat Sydney, and then inside a cage covered with mosquito\nnetting. No apports were produced.\nMr. Gellert's report of the second and third sittings is as\nfollows :\nSecond Seance, 13th January, 1904,\nAT SELBORNE CHAMBERS, PERU STREBT.\nThe meeting was held in another suite of chambers in same\nbuilding. There were about 40 persons present.\nDrs. Cleland and Rogers did the searching of the gentlemen.\nThe examinations by former gentleman were said by some whom\nhe searched to be most perfunctory. He took their word for what\nthey had about their persons.\n\fJULY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 113\nA message had come through the medium during the day, while\nhe was being photographed in the cage by Mr. Dobbie, from one of\nhis controls expressing objections to Dr. Ramsay Smith as a searcher\nof the medium. It appears that after first stance Dr. Smith\nhad expressed to some others his opinion of the need for stricter\nbodily search, and this may have reached ears of medium. Also,\nin his search of medium at first seance, he had opened front of\npants and under-pants and made some examination of lower trunk.\nHe was also more critical in his search work than was his colleague\n(though in opinion of writer he was not a whit more particular\nthan it was his duty to be). The control said also that the\nmedium's skin was not to be subjected to scrutiny\u2014that is, his\ncovered parts. He was accordingly searched by Dr. Rogers. He\nwas divested of coat and vest, and the examination was made by\npassing the hands over the clothing covering body and limbs and\ntaking off his boots, which were examined by Dr. Frank Magarey.\nThe boots were restored, but coat, vest, and waterproof overcoat\nwere left in search room, as was his hat. The searchers then\nconducted him to the locked seance room and put him in the bag,\ntied and sealed him at wrists and neck, and placed him in the\ncabinet, which was secured as at the first stance.\nThe sitters who had then been detained in the search rooms\nwere introduced to stance room, whose door was locked by catch-\nlock, against which writer sat.\nAfter a few minutes' discoursing by a control the lights were put\nout at control Abdul's desire. The company joined hands at his\nwish, and now and again sang\u2014also at his wish. The singing not\nbeing hearty enough, another control [came] who said he was used to\nconducting singing and \"led\" the hymn. At its conclusion Abdul\nagain took control, and said something would be brought. Selim\nhad gone for it, he said, and would soon be back. The power was\nnot very great, but they would do something. By and by a\nnoise as of something falling was heard in the cabinet, and control\nannounced that ancient money from the mounds had been brought,\nwhich he later informed us was of the reign of Ptolemy, and more\nthan 2000 years in age (I cannot recollect the exact date; he said\nfrom to such and such a date, not knowing exactly himself).\nHe said ten coins had come, but that only three would be left, as\nthe mound, by continued drawings on his part on various occa\nsions, was being depleted of these treasures. He had taken away\nhundreds.\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCLY, 1905.\nLater he brought a bird from India, and on a light being struck\nshowed something held in the hollow formed by his joined palms\nwhich was said to be a bird, though no one to whom I spoke could\nsee its shape. Only the tip of its head was allowed to peep out,\nand I could not distinguish even that. It might have been any\nthing or nothing. A cage should have been provided, he said, and\nit would have been put in. He asked that one should be procured\nfor following stances. The bird and seven coins were seen no more.\nOf the remaining coins, one was found partly under the outer edge\nof cabinet frame, which was of sufficient distance from floor to allow\nof a coin being passed under.\nFor next seance he asked for a cage and pot filled with earth.\nIt was also desired by control (one of the \" doctor men \") that\nas soon as he came to himself he should be given his vest, coat,\nand overcoat, as he was likely to catch cold and liable to shivers.\nThis was done, but no search was made of his clothes or person to\nascertain what had become of vanished coins and bird (?).\nThe conditions were not of sufficient stringency or conducted\nmethodically enough or with required attention to detail to be of\nany evidential value to the body of scientific opinion.\n3rd Stance, 14 Jan., 1904.\nMr. C. L. Whitham acted as searcher with Dr. F. Magarey. His\ncoat and vest were doffed and placed in a strong room in stance-\nroom ; they carefully examined him ; took off boots and socks\nand felt carefully clothing and person for anything which might be\nconcealed. After conducting him to stance-room he was tied and\nsealed in a bag made of mosquito netting\u2014his wife having com\nplained that the unbleached calico bag formerly used was too hot.\nThe mosquito bag being deemed a sufficient precaution for our\npurposes it was used. The controls expressed satisfaction with it.\nA decanter of water and tumbler, an empty canary cage, a pot\nfilled with earth from Mr. Bobbie's garden, and a black cloth from\nMr. Bobbie's camera outfit, and some sheets of ruled foolscap\nwriting paper with a pencil were placed on table in cabinet-cage.\nUpon the medium's entrance the cage was locked down as formerly.\n. . . Lights were extinguished after the preliminary talk of Br.\nWhitcombe (control) and Abdul (control) came.\nA cotton-wool (or some similar substance) nest with a small\negg was brought, but no bird. The control stated it was nest from\nwhich fledgeling brought ou previous evening was obtained.\n\fJULY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey, 115\nHe also planted a seed of some Indian sacred tree whose name\nhe did not seem certain of, but on repeated enquiry and suggestion\naffirmed to be of pepul family. The light was up dimly and I could\nsee the edge of pot with top of plant just appearing over line of\npot's edge, at one stage ; later it had grown more, and still later\u2014\nnot more than one hour altogether, I think\u2014it was at least 2 inches\nin height, with several leaves of | an inch in length.\nA luminous amorphous mass about size of hand appeared (some\nwhat the same as on previous sitting) to write a message from Alex.\nSutherland which was simply a \"greeting.\" Mr. Dobbie has it.\nA small silver coin was brought; the control, Abdul, attempted\nto pronounce its name, but having some difficulty, accepted the\nsuggestion that it was a denarius of the time of Adrian or\nHadrian (?).\nThe next control was Nana Sahib, who inquired for Mr. Stanford\n(of Melbourne). It was alleged by him that a memsahib friend of\nMr. Stanford's asked to see him. This control manifested much\nantipathy to the \"feringhi\" audience, and named them \"dogs.\"\nAfter glaring round the medium fell into a sort of catalepsy on the\nfloor\u2014his head resting against the mosquito netting side and partly\non frame of cabinet at such an angle as if any weight were there,\nthe netting must have torn at the tacking, and this did happen.\n(This was after production of apports), Mr. Dobbie went forward\nwith the idea of supporting his head to prevent a breakage of the\nnetting, but was warned back by Dr. Ramsay Smith. After a short\nwait the medium recovered himself (this all took place under a\nslightly subdued light and everything was plainly visible) and Abdul\nwas again in control. After telling sitters not to be frightened, he\nsaid Nana was not a good spirit and came because Mr. Stanford\nwanted him. Dr. Whitcombe afterwards explained that the Hindoo\ncontrols expelled him and (presumably\u2014my assumption) this caused\nthe \"fit.\"\nA gum-fastened envelope addressed to Abdul containing a message\nfrom some person was placed on mantelpiece outside cage, and he\n(Whitcombe) was asked that it should be made to pass into cabinet\nor that some object from houses or offices of some of sitters should\nbe brought ; but he said it was difficult, requiring space, and nothing\ncame of the request except that it might take place on following\nnight. . . .\nDr. Ramsay Smith expressed his opinion to me and others that\nthe whole affair of the fit was a sham. Had the seizure been a\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.\ngenuine one, nothing would have kept his head (which was kept\nbent) from straightening and going through netting of cabinet.\nIt was not epileptic nor hysterical nor apoplectic ; not patho\nlogical in short. Dr. F. Magarey supported that statement, that\nit was none of these kinds of seizures, but thought it possible that\nit might be of another order\u2014in brief, that it was not a fit,\nproperly so-called, but some trance catalepsy which would be quite\npossible admitting genuineness of phenomena produced.\nMr. Dobbie wrote later as follows:\nFebruary 3rd, 1904.\n. . . The tree that was produced inside the mosquito-net cage\nreferred to in my last letter is still growing in my glass-house. Per\nsame post I send you a coin which came into my possession under\nthe following circumstances : Mr. C. Bailey came to my office the\nmorning after the last of the sittings with one of my fellow-committee-\nmen (Mr. Frost) to receive his payment for the sittings. During\nthe interview he suddenly became controlled by Abdul, one of his\ncontrols, and in a bright, delighted kind of manner pointed to two\nvery interesting photographs I had taken during my visit to India\nin 1893, saying: \"That my country; you been there?\" etc., then\na minute or two afterwards said, \"You got the money.\" I said, \"I\ngave the medium the money a few minutes ago.\" \"No, no; I no\nmean that money, I mean your money.\" Mr. Frost, like myself not\nunderstanding what had happened, said to the control : \" Mr. Dobbie\ngave the medium the money, eight sovereigns, just now.\" Abdul\nreplied : \"I no mean that, Selim [another control] he fetch coin\nfrom Egypt for Mr. Dobbie just now; you look on floor, it fall\ndown.\" We then searched the floor, and finally found a large copper\ncoin behind my chair on the farther side from the medium. He\nthen informed us that it was a coin of the third Ptolemy. ... I\nmay mention that the bird's nest and egg, and also the live bird\nand most of the coins were taken back to where they came from\nduring the sittings. All we have left are three coins and the\ngrowing tree. He said the bird could not live here, and the Hindoos\ndo not take life even when in the egg, so they were taken back\nagain at once. . . .\nADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, February 25th, 1904.\nReferring to the sittings with Mr. C. Bailey ... I have now to\nreport a fresh development. At one of the sittings he requested me\n\fJULY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 117\nto provide a flower-pot filled with earth for the following evening.\nIn the morning I told him that the subscribers would prefer the\ntime being used for the production of apports from distant places\nrather than spending time on anything that, like tree-growing,\nwas known to be a common juggler's trick in India and elsewhere.\nHe replied that it was for the \"control\" to decide that, he himself\nhad \"nothing to do with what took place.\" I therefore provided\nthe pot with earth, and placed it in the cage with him in the\nevening. The result was that he (the control) provided or produced\nwhat he said was a species of peepul tree of India, and instructed\nme to keep it in perfect darkness for two days. Before the forty-\neight hours were up the medium was on the sea on his way to\nItaly. Ever since that time I have carefully nursed the plant in\nmy glass-house, and also under a propagating glass. It made a\nvery slight growth, and several persons (not experts) made the\nremark that it \"looks like a young olive tree.\" I, not thinking\nthe medium would be so mad as to attempt such a transparent\nfraud, did not suspect it being simply a cutting; but as it has\nlately been gradually curling its leaves, I was afraid that my glass\nhouse was not a suitable place for it, so yesterday morning took it\nto my friend Mr. Holtze, the Director of the Adelaide Botanic\nGardens, to request him to place it in his tropical plant-house. I\ntold him that it was supposed to be a species of Indian peepul\ntree. He at once said, \"I can positively assure ^ou, Mr. Dobbie,\nthat it is not a peepul tree. I believe it is simply a cutting of an\nolive tree, and I do not believe it has any root.\" I at once said,\n\"Then let us take it up at once and examine it.\" He then took\nit up carefully, and sure enough it was only a cutting devoid of\nroot. I may inform you that there are hundreds of olive trees\nabout Adelaide growing in the City Public Parks, so Mr. Bailey\nwould not have the slightest difficulty in getting any amount of\ncuttings. To all appearance he must have taken a cutting from one\nof the trees in the City Parks or Squares and hid it in his hair.\nI cannot remember his hair being searched, perhaps it was, but\nthe fact remains that the supposed peepul tree is simply an olive\ncutting. . . .\nMr. Dobbie enclosed with this letter a copy of a printed\nnote describing this incident, circulated to the sitters who\ntook part in these stances by the Committee, dated February\n29th, 1904, and signed by Messrs. F. B. C. Frost, E. S.\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.\nBogers, M.D., J. W. Gellert, and A. W. Bobbie. In a letter\ndated April 13th, 1904, he observes:\nWe paid Mr. Bailey for postages so that he might write to us\nevery month during his trip [to Europe], but he has not written a\nline to any of us. It is simply another proof of the utter un\nreliability of Bailey as a man judged from the ordinary standard.\nBesides the coins referred to in these letters, which Mr.\nDobbie sent us to be examined by experts, and which (as\nstated in the Journal for March, p. 46) were pronounced by\nthe British Museum authorities to be genuine, but quite\ncommon and valueless, we received from him two photographs,\none ordinary and one stereoscopic one, showing Mr. Bailey\nenveloped in the bag and sitting inside the cage covered\nwith mosquito netting. If these photographs represent, as\napparently they do, the exact arrangement in force at the\nsittings, they support the hypothesis suggested in the May\nJournal that objects concealed on Mr. Bailey's person or in\nhis clothes were in the dark passed out through the neck of\nthe bag ; for this is drawn up in such a way as to show part\nof his coat-collar and in one case part of the white linen\ncollar beneath, so that he would only have had to shift it a\nlittle higher up on his neck to allow plenty of play and\nspace. The report also shows that, as in the Italian sittings\ndescribed by M. de Vesme in the Annals of Psychical Science\nfor April, Mr. Bailey objected to being adequately searched.\nCASES.\nTHE two following cases are instances of what Mr. Myers, in\ndeveloping a suggestion of Mr. Gurney's, called \" veridical after\nimages,\" that is, visions that suggest \"the survival of a mere\nimage ... of past events or emotions with no active counter\npart in the present \" ;\u2014\" a kind of local imprint left by past\nevents, and perceptible at times to persons endowed with\nsome special form of sensitiveness.\" Cases of this kind are\ngenerally associated with deceased persons, and in regard to\nthese Mr. Myers writes:\n\" We are, indeed, always uncertain as to the degree of\nthe deceased person's active participation in post-mortem\n\fJULY, 1905. Cases. 119\nphantasms,\u2014as to the relation of such manifestations to the\ncentral current of his continuing individuality. But it is\nin dealing with these persistent pictures of a bygone earth-\nscene that this perplexity reaches its climax. They may, as\nI have already said, be the mere dreams of the dead ;\u2014affording\nno true indication of the point which the deceased person's\nknowledge or emotion has really reached.\" (Human Personality,\nVol. II., p. 384; see also pp. 4 and 360.)\nOf the two cases printed below, the first conforms to the\nusual type in appearing to represent a dead person ; the second\nis interesting in representing a recent event, the actor in\nwhich was still presumably living.\nG. 278. Apparition.\nThis case was sent to us by a member of the Society,\nMrs. C. C. Baker, the account having been written by a\nfriend of hers, Miss Bedford, and enclosed in a letter from\nMrs. Baker, dated April 25th, 1905. Miss Bedford writes:\nOn the 18th of November, 1904, I was bicycling from a village\na mile or two from my home, by a lane which follows the\nwindings of a river. A steep bank, lightly wooded, divides the\nroad from the river, and at intervals along the top where the bushes\nare sparse there are bits of rail painted white. It was broad\ndaylight; it could not have been later than 3.30, but there was\na light silvery fog. As I came round a corner, I saw a little distance\nahead of me a man sitting on the rail in a very dejected attitude ;\nhe seemed to have no hat on and to be looking down at the water.\nI was not near enough to distinguish his features, my sight not\nbeing very good. I had a misgiving he might be a starving tramp,\nas it was so cold nobody would sit on a rail for pleasure, and fearing he\nmight stop me, I looked round to see whether some men who were\nmending the road some way back were still in sight. They were\nnot, and when I turned my head again the man had vanished. I\nhad come quite close to the place, and the bushes being leafless I\ncould see all down the bank to the water, and he was nowhere\nto be seen. Had he been in the lane I must have overtaken him;\nhad he crossed I must have seen him, as the bank going up to the\nfield the other side is too steep for him to have climbed while my\nhead was turned. I then remembered having been told of a ghost\nwho had been seen at a spot in another lane about half a mile off,\non the other side of the main high road, but still following the\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.\nsame river, and I said to myself, \"I really should have thought\nthis was the ghost B. L. talks of, only it is the wrong place.\" I\nwas not the least frightened, though I had been dreadfully afraid\nto pass the other place in the dusk when I had just been told of\nit, and had crossed myself and prayed for his release that I might\nnot see it. I only knew that it was a man who had drowned himself\nabout forty years before. Just beyond where I saw him, round\nthe next bend, stands a little farm and a slope goes down to\nthe water.\nSome ten days later I sat next Miss L. at a luncheon party,\nand said to her, \" I think I must have seen the ghost you talked of\nthe other day; only it was in I Lane, not W Lane.\" She\nexclaimed, \" Where 1 Tell me exactly where.\" \" Sitting on the\nwhite rail where the lane bends round.\" \" Why ! \" she cried,\n\" that is the place where he did it.\" \" But you told me W\nLane,\" I said. \"Yes, because that is the only place I ever heard\nof his being seen. He was attached to a nursery governess of ours\nwho jilted him; he used to wait for her and walk with her there,\nand not long after his suicide my mother saw him there ; but he\nlived at T Farm, in I Lane, and he threw himself into the\nriver near his home.\" I was a good deal impressed with this.\nEarly in January I was visiting the same old couple from whom\nI had been returning when I saw the man, and they chanced to\nmention thay had lived in the same cottage over fifty years, so I\nasked, did they remember a young farmer who put an end to\nhimself in that lane some forty years ago. \"Oh yes,\" they said,\n\"that would be Sammy D ; he throwed hisself into the water\nalongside the farm where he lived just where the cattle goes\ndown to watering.\" Then the old woman took up the word;\n\" Crossed in love Sammy was : he was courtin' one o' the maids\nup to S (Miss L.'s old home) and she wouldn't have him; so\nhe come in one day and throwed his hat down on to the kitchen\ntable and went out and drowned hisself.\"\nThe one detail I had observed was that the man had no hat on.\nI then told them what I had seen, but they had never seen him\nnor knew any who had ; neither have I since, though I have passed\nboth places often.\n(Signed) JESSIE BEDFORD.\ni\nThe \" Miss L.\" of the above narrative writes :\nThe gate in W Lane where my mother (I believe several times)\n\fJULY, 1905.

OCT., 1905.\nTWO POLTEKGEIST CASES.\nI.\nTOWARDS the end of August, 1904, somewhat sensational reports\nappeared in several of the daily papers about a \" haunted\nhouse \" at Upholland, near Wigan, in Lancashire, where\n\" Poltergeist \" phenomena were said to be occurring in abund\nance. The house was tenanted by a widow named Mrs.\nWinstanley with six children, the eldest son being a French\npolisher by trade and the younger ones miners. The dis\nturbances occurred in a bedroom occupied by three of the\nsons, and seemed to be connected with a walled-up window\nin the room which was close to their bed. From this\nwindow and the adjoining parts of the wall of the room\npieces of paper were torn off and stones and mortar were\npulled out of the wall and scattered about the room. The\nwall was repaired, but the same things happened again.\nEarly in September of the same year, Lieut.-Colonel Le\nM. Taylor visited Upholland to investigate the case and his\nreport of it would have appeared sooner, but that it was hoped\nto get further evidence from one of the principal witnesses.\nHe also made plans and drawings of different parts of the\nhouse, and obtained photographs of it and of the \" haunted \"\nwindow, which are not reproduced here, but may be seen in\nour Eooms by members of the Society. Colonel Taylor writes :\nDecember 20th, 1904.\nI arrived at the village of Upholland at about 11 a.m. on\nFriday, September 9th, 1904, and at once called on the Rev. G. F.\nWills, who told me that the affair at the Winstanleys' had created\nmuch stir in the neighbourhood. The Winstanley family consists\nof Mrs. W. and her six children, namely William, age about 27,\nThomas 24, Peter 17, Henry 14, and two little girls under 12\nyears of age.\nMr. Wills said that they were of good repute ; that Peter was\nnot so steady as his brothers ... , the others he thought very\ntrustworthy.\nMr. Wills kindly took me into the village and introduced me to\nMr. Baxter as a good witness. He dictated to me the statement\n\f\u2022OCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 125\nherewith, over his signature. We then went and found Mr.\n\u2022Chadwick, who is the local agent for the owner of the \" haunted \"\nhouse; he agreed to come with me to the house in the evening. I\nthen saw Mrs. Winstanley herself, who received me very kindly\nand offered no objection whatever to my making an investigation\nin any way I liked. Peter was at home and he and his mother\nshowed me the room and told me their story about what had taken\nplace in it.\nAt 8 p.m. I returned and found Mr. Chadwick already in the\n.haunted room sitting on the bed. In a few minutes we were joined\nby William and a Mr. John Corless, and one or two others. The\nstreet lamp made the room very far from dark. We sat on the\nbed in front of the newly plastered wall for about an hour, but as\nnothing occurred all my companions, except Mr. Corless, went down\nstairs and he and I went into the back room and sat at the door 1\ntill 11 o'clock. During this time some other people came and went,\n.partly to see me, I suppose, but they came at once into the back\n.room and no one attempted to approach the \"haunted\" wall.\nNothing occult was observed and I returned to Wigan.\nOn Saturday I went over to Upholland at 11 a.m. and met\nJohn Corless and John Winstanley (who is no relation of the\n,other people of that name) at Mr. Baxter's shop ; they dictated\ntheir statements to me. At 8 p.m. I again went to Mrs.\nWinstanley's and sat at the door of the back room till 11. I\nliad several visitors but no manifestations.\nOn Sunday I again returned and watched from 7.30 till 11 ;\nagain visitors, William, Peter, John Corless, Chadwick and others,\nbut no one attempted to approach the forbidden wall ; again no\noccult manifestation. I was, as I anticipated, too late to get any\npersonal experience in the matter. On Monday I returned to\nCheltenham, after being promised three other statements and an\nassurance that Sergt. Radcliffe of the police would send me his\nwhen he returned from his holiday in about ten days.\nFrom what I gathered in conversation during my visits to\nUpholland the history of the aifair seems to be that during the\nlast few days of July, knocks on the wall and bricked-up window\nwere heard, but that it was not till the night of Sunday, August\n1st, that they became so insistent as to cause alarm. On this night\n1 Colonel Taylor's plan of the house shows that the back room opens out\nof the front (\"haunted\") room, so that a full view of the latter can be\n\u2022obtained from the doorway of the former.\nA2\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905..\nnot only were knocks heard but the wall-paper was torn and pieces,\nof mortar, etc., thrown about the room.\nOn Monday Mrs. Winstanley secured Mr. Baxter's assistance and\ncalled in the ,police. For something over a fortnight the disturb\nances continued and every endeavour was made to trace the cause\nof the phenomena without avail, many people taking part in the\ninvestigation, aided in every way by the family. The agent, Mr.\nChadwick, was among the most energetic of the investigators, but\nwas so unfortunate that he did not witness anything which in his\nopinion excluded human agency. He told me that he was in the\nroom when two pieces of mortar fell at his feet ; he is not able\nto attribute this to the action of any one in the house, but\nsupposes the mortar to have been thrown in through the window\nof the back room. This explanation is inadequate, for although the\nground rises behind the house and thus makes such a thing more\npossible, the shape and size of the window in my opinion precludes\nit. He had the floor of the room taken up, a hole made in the\nchimney ; he examined the wall of Mrs. Peet's house next door, bub\ncould find no marks which might indicate operations from that\nside ; he placed pencil marks round the dilapidations to see when\npieces of mortar were newly carried away, and finally had the\nwindow newly walled up, the window-sill removed and the whole\nplastered over, making the wall good again. This was done on\nAugust 19th, since which time the boys have ceased to sleep\nin the room and the bed has been placed in its new position in\nthe room [i.e. further away from the window]. Since this date the\ndisturbances seem to have had a tendency gradually to diminish ;.\nno more knocks have been heard, or very few, and whereas at first\nthe phenomena recurred every night, now intervals of quiet were\ninterpolated, which have become more and more frequent. At the\ndate of my visit the last disturbance was noticed on the day before\nI arrived; still a considerable quantity of mortar and stone has\nbeen removed from the wall since the 19th September, also a new\nplace has been attacked.\nAt first members of the Winstanley [family] were naturally\nsuspected ; now the consensus of public opinion has completely\nacquitted them.\nI could detect no adequate motive on the part of any one ;.\nindeed, the Winstanleys are much exercised about a demand on\n[the] part of their landlord that they should make good the\ndamage.\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 127\nPopular superstition attributes the disturbance to the spirit of\na highwayman who was buried in the churchyard near the house\nabout a hundred years ago.\nFrequent attempts have been made to detect intelligence, with\nno result; but if the story of the piece of plaster having been\nbalanced on the knob of the bedstead is true, intelligence was\ncertainly present.\nI judge that the witnesses in this case were not familiar with, at\nleast, the details of seance room manifestations ; still on two\noccasions things were observed which correlate with these, and\nsimilar to phenomena reported to have been observed during other\nPoltergeist manifestations, namely :\nOnce when I was sitting just inside the door of the second room,\nwith the pieces of wood which had formerly constituted the sill of\nthe haunted window behind me against the wall, my two com\npanions at the time\u2014the schoolmaster and another\u2014declared that\nthey saw a light flitting about in the neighbourhood of the boards ;\nthey saw it two or three times, as they said, quite plainly ; we\nhad not been speaking of \"spirit lights\" or anything of the sort,\nour whole attention being directed towards the \"haunted window\"\nin the next room which we were watching.\nAt another time one of the witnesses told me that he considered\nthat the stones he saw come out from the wall travelled more\nslowly than they could have done if jerked or thrown out and he\nperceived what looked like a faint light behind them. My\ninformant seemed to lay no stress on this, as if he had no theory\nof their being removed by a \"spirit hand\" or anything of that sort.\nI attach the statements of the various witnesses from whom I\nwas able to get written evidence. My long delay in making this\nreport is due to the fact that two other men1 promised me state\nments, but though I have made several attempts to get them, I am\nunable; it must therefore be presumed that they are not attainable.\nMrs. Winstanley herself has given no statement, but corroborates,\nas far as she is concerned, what others informed me of.\nShe told me that on one occasion when she knew that no one\nwas in the house she was standing at the street door with one of\nher sons when they heard a noise in the room above ; it was just\ngetting dark in the evening. They went up to the room at once\n1 One of these was a Mr. Bibby, who is cited as one of the principal\nwitnesses in an illustrated article on \"The Haunted House at Upholland, \"\nwhich appeared in The Wide World Magazine for February, 1905.\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.\nand found one or more of the stones on the floor; she believed\nthey were in their places when she left the house.\nAgain, one of the brothers, who has not made a statement in\nwriting, said to me, \"Last Sunday week in the evening I was\nstanding outside with Mrs. Peet ; we heard what sounded like\nthe stones being thrown on the floor. My brother had just left\nthe house and was a little way down the street. When I heard the\nsound I called him back and asked him if the stones were in the\nwall when he left; he said yes. We all went up and found two of\nthe large stones and a third smaller one on the floor.\"\nThe last manifestations seem to have shifted their locality, for a\nhole (about the size of an orange when I saw it) had been made\nin the plaster of the wall opposite the haunted window and the\npaper round it much torn only a day or two before my arrival.\nI should have mentioned that William Winstanley, the eldest\nbrother, is lame, and a French polisher by trade, the other brothers\nare miners. G. L. LE M. TAYLOR.\nThe statements dictated by the various witnesses to\nColonel Taylor, and afterwards corrected and signed by them,\nwere as follows :\nFrom Mr Eichard Baxter, member of the District Council :\nSeptember 9th, 1904.\nOn Monday, August 1st, Mrs. Winstanley came to my shop and\ntold me that something very mysterious had been taking place in\nher house which had frightened her and her family. She had\ncalled in the policeman, who went into the room where the mys\nterious things were happening, but nothing took place in his presence.\nShe asked me if I would go over to her house to-night and help\nthem. I said I would do so, but asked what was the matter.\nShe told me that they had heard knocks on the wall that they\ncould not account for, and that the plaster had been torn off the\nwall and cast about in such a way that no human agency would\naccount for.\nI went over to Mrs. Winstanley's at about 11 p.m. that evening,\nand on going to the room where the disturbances were taking place\nfound the three boys, Henry, Peter, and Thomas, in bed together\n(their ages about 14, 17, and 24 respectively). I went over to the bed\nto examine the wall where the knocks had been heard and where the\nplaster had been torn away. Another man, Mr. John Glover, stood\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 129\nat the foot of the bed the while. It was not so dark but that I\ncould plainly see the young men in bed, though there was no lamp\nin the room. I heard a knocking which seemed to come from the\nwall where the ancient window had been walled up. The man who\nwas standing at the foot of the bed became afraid and left the\nroom ; but just at this time the policeman, who had been called in\nthe night before, entered.\nI could not understand the knockings, and of course suspected\nthat the young men in bed must have something to do with it, so\nI said to the policeman, \" This is very strange ; would it not be\nbetter if we were to slip into the next room and watch at the\ndoorway?\" We went and stood in the back room, looking in\nthrough the door. I said, \" You have your lamp ready.\"\nIn a few minutes we heard the knocking again, and the lamp\nwas at once flashed on the bed, by which we saw that the boys had\nnot seemingly moved. After a little a stone fell from the wall to\nthe floor ; again the lamp was flashed on* the place, but we detected\nno movement on [the] part of the boys. Now the sergeant of police\ncame up to us and went and stood near the bed, but the same sort\nof thing went on, knocks being heard and pieces of the wall, mostly\nplaster, came tumbling out, some of it not merely falling to the\nground, but seemed to be ejected from the wall into the room.\nAfter investigating in this way for a considerable time without\nbeing able to find out how the thing happened, we left for the night.\nThe next night I went again to the house. This time the young\nmen had not gone to bed, and I found Mr. John Winstanley wait\ning my arrival (this Mr. Winstanley is no relation to the people of\nthe same name living in the house).\nThree of us went upstairs to investigate. I went first, and was\nfollowed by John and Peter, who was carrying a lamp. As I came\nto the door of the room I heard some knocks and something fall.\nWhen we got inside the room Peter put out his lamp, and seated\nhimself in a chair in the back room close to the door. I stood\nleaning against the door-post, and John stood close behind me.\nSoon a piece of mortar flew from somewhere and fell at Peter's\nfeet. We lit the lamp to see where it could have come from, but\ncould only conjecture that it must have come from the walled-up\nwindow, as only there was there a \"raw\" place in the wall. At\nthis Peter got frightened and returned downstairs. John and I\nremained, and a piece or two of mortar again fell on the floor. We\nlighted up and found them.\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.\nOn Monday I attended the Local Board. One of the members,\nMr. , was much interested in what I told them I had seen at\nMrs. Winstanley's, and came with me the following night to\ninvestigate.\nThis time the boys were in bed as I had found them on Monday.\nWe had not been long in the room before bits of mortar and stone\ncame away from the wall. I was very keen to discover the boys\nplaying tricks, but could detect nothing.\nA hat-box was standing on a wooden board in the window. Sud\ndenly the hat-box flew out into the room over the bed. But before\nthis took place there was some loud knocking. I watched the boys,\nand am sure they did not do it. They were evidently much afraid.\nI picked up the stones which had come out of the wall and replaced\nthem. They had come from that part close under the board, and\nwere of considerable size, from 2x3x2 [ins.] to 10 x 6 x 2\u00a3 [ins.],\nor about that. I fixed the stones back in their places as securely as\nI could, but they were again taken out, and fell on the floor with\nmuch noise. The hat-box also was replaced and a stone put on top\nof it. These soon came away and fell on the floor. On a subse\nquent occasion, when the boys were in bed and I was standing at\nthe door of the back room, these stones were again detached from\nthe wall. I had the boys under observation, and they did not\nmove at the time.\nMr. Grimshaw of Tontine said he would like to see what was\ngoing on, so he went with me on Friday night, and with us were\ntwo others. Of the four one of us stood in the room about three\nfeet from the bed, and the rest at the door. We remained about\nan hour. The boys were in bed, but I was watching them closely.\nKnocks were heard on the wall in the usual way, and a sort of\nsound as if sand or shot were being poured on the floor, after which\na stone would come out and fall. Mr. Grimshaw thought that the\nknocks were intended as signals in the telegraphic code, and meant\nhis initials. I changed places with him, and when subsequent knocks\nwere heard he said they indicated mine. We also heard knocks on\nthe floor.\nMuch more of this sort of thing took place than I have related.\nFor example, on one occasion I placed the hat-box on a stone on\nthe wooden board. The stone was 5x8x2 [ins.], and in the box\nanother stone. They were all thrown into the room.\nAgain, I marked a piece of plaster and placed it in the corner of\nthe window. This was thrown out into the room.\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 131\nI have known stones and mortar fly from the wall more than 30\n-or 40 times and have never seen any indication of trickery, nor\n.have I heard [of] any one who has seen anything of this character.\n(Signed) RICHARD BAXTER.\n50 SCHOOL LANE, UPHOLLAND, NR. WIGAN.\nFrom Mr. John Corless :\nSeptember IQth [1904].\nI heard of these disturbances about 4 weeks ago, and went to\n\u2022examine them with Mr. Baxter. We went up to the room at 10.30\np.m. with a Mr. Richard Clayton ; the Winstanleys were downstairs.\nWe sat in the door of the back room and watched. After being\nthere for about 10 minutes a piece of plaster fell at my foot (we\nhad no light). After a little we heard the sound of tearing paper\nand other sounds, indicating the removal of plaster from the wall,\nand a piece came out and lit in the middle of the room. We\nwatched about 45 minutes, and I saw a dim light which moved\nabout thus twice. We now went into the room and sat against the\nwooden partition facing the walled-up window. We remained there\nfor about half-an hour, when \" it throwed,\" and a piece of plaster\nabout 2 x 1 x li [ins.] hit my foot, and I put it to my cheek and\nbrow to see if it was warm or cold. After this the boys came up\nand went to bed about 12.10, and we went into the back room\nand looked through the door. After about 15 minutes 3 knocks came,\nand then I heard a stone come out of the window. Then there\nwere twice three knocks, then three given slowly, then eight given\nvery quickly. Then another stone came out. After this the hat-box\ncame out (band-box), and also stones from under the wooden shelf.\nAfter this I went away.\nThe next time I went to see the thing was three weeks come\nTuesday. It was the day after they had filled up the recess of the\nwindow and plastered it over. About 8.10 p.m. I went into the\nroom and examined the new work and the wall near it. I then\nwent down to Mrs. Winstanley in the kitchen. We were the only\ntwo people in the house. We heard something fall in the room\nabove, and she said, \" Take the lamp and go and see what it is.\"\nI did so, and found that a piece of plaster had been torn from the\nwall on the front wall of the house close to the right of the new\nplaster work. It was 4x9 inches, and was on the floor about three\nfeet from the wall. I knew where it came from by seeing the new\ndefaced place in the wall, a defacement which was not there when\nI examined the wall at 8.10.\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905-\nI went down again, and at a quarter to nine the two boys, Peter\nand Thomas, came in. Again we heard something fall, and again we\n(Thomas and I) went up to look. A new piece of plaster had been'\nthrown across the room. We found it near the door, it was a\ncorner piece, and I was able to fit it into the place it had come\nfrom. Thomas and I went and examined the upper rooms.\nAgain I went to the house just a week ago, and while below we\nheard a stone come out. I went up to examine by myself. I found\nthe stone on the floor and some plaster. I examined the stone and\nthe wall for tool-marks, as I could not think that the thing could\nbe done without some instrument, but I found no marks.\nAgain last Sunday night I was up there. I was standing with\nMrs. Winstanley in the street in front of the house when she said\nshe heard a noise. I went up and found one of the stones on the\nfloor. Since then, one night at about 8.45, Peter and I were standing\nat the house door, when we heard the usual noise. We went up\ninto the room and found a piece of mortar balanced on one of the\nbrass knobs of the bedstead. It was about 5x3 [ins.], and also\na piece 12x6 [ins.] lying on the bed. We went back to the door,\nand in a little Peter went into the house ; but I followed him at\nonce. He was getting himself a drink of water in the kitchen. He\nsaid, \" Did you hear that ? \" On which we went upstairs again and\nfound a triangle of mortar 5 inches each way on the floor near the\ndoor. I am sure it was not there when I left the room ten minutes\nbefore, and no one was in the house.\nOn Wednesday I saw a light like a spark, about 9.45. Again on\nThursday last Mrs. W., Peter and I were in front of the house, and\nno one was inside. We heard the window of the \" Ghost \" room\nshake. Peter said, \"There must be something up.\" I went to the\nroom holding a lighted match, and found two pieces of mortar on\nthe stairs, and a piece on the knob of the bed 15x7 [ins.]. One\nof the pieces found on the stairs fitted a part of the new hole which\nhad, within the last few days, been made in the wall opposite the\nwalled-up window.\n(Signed) JOHN CORLESS.\n3 HIGHER LANE, UPHOLLAND, WIGAN, LANCASHIRE.\nFrom Mr. John Winstanley :\nSeptember 10th [1904].\nOn the third night of the disturbances I went with Mr. R. Baxter\nto the house about 10 p.m. No sooner had we got into the back\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 133\nroom and Peter, who followed me, had sat down by the door than\na piece of mortar dropped at his feet. He seemed frightened and\nwent downstairs and got a lamp. He returned with it and sat\ndown again. I put the lamp out, and at once \" it threw again,\" and\nPeter went away, being frightened. We remained for half-au-hour,\nand I heard the paper on the wall tearing. Then Thomas and\nPeter and Henry all came up and got into bed. Peter nearest the\nwall, then Henry, and outside Thomas. Three knocks came on\nthe plaster and three on the board, then a sound as of falling sand\nor gravel on the floor. Then the large stone under the board\ncame out and fell. (During the evening 6 or 8 stones came\nout which measured from 4x4 to 10x10, and about 2 or 2J\ninches thick). I got the lamp from the back room and we\nexamined the wall.\nI am sure the Winstanleys had nothing to do with it, and had\nno means of getting hold of these stones from the outside.\nWe replaced the stones, put out the light, and went back to the\ndoor of the back room. The knocks recommenced and out came the\nstones again. Again we got a light and examined.\nI have seen it by myself when no one was in the room. I have\nheard a bit of mortar fall, found it to be an angle piece, and fitted\nit back into its place in the wall.\nLast Sunday I was with Mrs. Winstanley in the kitchen, and we\nheard the noise. Mrs. W. went out of the house to see if she\ncould find one of her boys. I was left sitting in the rocking chair\nwhen \"it threw\" a second time. By ear I judged that a piece of\nmortar had been thrown -across the room, and I heard the tearing\nof the paper as it was detached from the wall. I went to the back\ndoor and called Mrs. Peet, who lives next door, who had wanted to\nsee something of it. She came in, and \"it again threw.\"\nMrs. W. now returned with Peter, and we went upstairs and\nfound several pieces of mortar on the floor, and much paper torn\noff the walls, and mortar gone from a new place.\nAfter this some other men came in and said they would stay,\nbut would not remain upstairs when the light was taken away. As\nthey went out a piece of plaster was thrown down the stairs on to\nthe fourth step.\n(Signed) JOHN WINSTANLKY.\n37 ALMA HILL, UPHOLLAND.\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.\nThe following is a copy of the Police report of the case :\nPOLICE STATION, UPHOLLAND, 7th October, 1904.\nFrom P. S. 1270 Ratcliffe at Upholland.\nTo Mr. Superintendent O'Hara at Wigan.\nEe ALLEGED UPHOLLAND GHOST.\nAbout 12 night on 8th August last, I was passing the house of\nMrs. Winstanley, a widow, in Church Street, Upholland, which was\nafterwards described [as] the Ghost House. There was then a\ncrowd of people in the street in front of the house ; on enquiry of\nthe cause I ascertained that a strange knocking had been heard in\none of the front bedrooms of the house, and could be heard in the\nstreet; I stayed in front of the house for some time when I heard\n3 distinct knocks, which appeared to be in the wall.\nAbout 11.30 p.m. 10th August, I was in front of the house again\nwhen Mrs. Winstanley came to me and asked if I would try and\nfind out what was causing the knocking on the bedroom wall, and\nmaking the stones and paper fly from the walls. There was a bed\nin the room which was about ^ a yard from the wall; when I\nentered the room 3 of the sons got into bed ; one of them named\nPeter needed some persuasion as he was on the wall side and\nseemed to be very much upset and frightened, and I had to\npromise him that I would stay in the room before he would get\nin the bed.\nThinking that Peter was responsible for the damage to the\nwall, I closed 2 doors that lead into the room, and turned the\nlamp out, and after being very quiet for about 15 minutes there\nwere 3 loud knocks in the wall, and immediately after there was a\ncrash on the room floor; I put on a light and found that 7\nstones, which would be from 1 Ib. to 4 Ibs., lying on the bedroom\nfloor which appeared to have slurred out of the wall. I put the\nstones back in the wall again and turned the room in darkness,\nand after being very quiet the knock came again as before, and the\nsame stones fell on the floor again. During the time of this\nprocess, I was stood with the bed between me and the wall where\nthe damage was being done, and with the room being very dark, I\nreached a stick across the 3 lads' bodies while they were laid in\nbed and kept it there till the stone fell out again ; ft was impos\nsible for them to knock on the wall, or remove the stones without\nme feeling them move.\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 135\nI put the stones back in the wall again and tried it a third\ntime ; this time I was stood about 1 yard from the wall, and after\nthe usual knocking the stones fell on the room floor again ; this\ntime I stood with a box of matches in my hand to make a light\nquick, and before the sound went away I had a light on the 3\nlads in bed and found they all had their hands under the bed\nclothes in bed.\nThe stones in the wall had come out of the wall previous to me\ngoing inside, as I found them all loose when I went in the room.\nAlmost every night between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. from the 10th\nto the 19th August, I frequently heard the knocking and stones\nfalling on the room floor when I was in the street.\nOn the 23d August the stones were set in mortar and cement.\nAbout 9.30 p.m. on the 27th August, Mrs. Winstanley again\nasked me to go and see the bedroom. I went in and saw that a\nstone about 7 Ibs. weight was lying on the room floor, and it appeared\nto have been forced through the mortar.\nThe mortar was hanging loose about 1 inch all round the hole\nwhere the stone had come out. There were no marks of any\ndescription about the hole in the wall, which I think there would\n-have been if it had been tampered with inside the room.\n(Signed) ROBERT RATCLIFFE,\nP. S. 1270.\nIn a letter addressed to Colonel Taylor on September 5th,\n1904, before his visit to Upholland, William Winstanley, the\neldest son, refers to the suspicion which he believed to be\nentertained by the Vicar, Mr. Wills, that the phenomena were\ndue to trickery on the part of some member of the house\nhold, but he says, \" I am positive that he is mistaken.\" He\nalso says, \" I shall be very pleased indeed if you can do\nanything at all to elucidate the mystery.\"\nThe following account was written by William Winstanley,\napparently during September, 1904:\nThe first night I heard the noises was on Sunday, August\n7th, 1904, shortly after midnight. The first thing that occurred\nwas 3 distinct knocks at intervals of a minute or two. (A) I went\nto the wall, knocked back and asked, \" Who is there 1 what is\nwanted? etc.,\" but got no answer. Then I asked, \"If you have\nany intelligence, knock as many knocks as I do.\" I gave 7 raps,\nbut got no answer. So I walked away. When about a yard from\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.\nthe wall, a number of stones were thrown from the wall on to the\nfloor. On the same night, as soon as I left my own bed in the\nnext bedroom, the first thing that caught my eye on entering\nthe room, where the noise proceeded from, was an old English\nHistory (which had formerly been in the recess) lying on the floor\nbehind the door at the other side of the room. On another\noccasion, (B) while talking to the police officers, with my head\nthrough the bedroom window, I was hit with a lump of plaster on\nthe right shoulder, which was on the opposite side of the room to\nwhere the plaster was thrown from. The same night I (c) was\nalso hit in the back with a lump, but the}' never hurt. On\nanother occasion I saw stones lying between my brothers' heads\nas they lay in bed, and their heads covered with plaster. I have\nalso seen pieces of plaster balanced on the bedstead post. Very\nfew nights pass without 2 or 3 pieces of stone or plaster being\nthrown into my bedroom. I have also seen pieces that have been\nthrown nearly to the bottom of the stairs. One night, (D) after\nevery one was in bed except myself, I went to examine the wall.\nAfter leaving it, and before I got out of the room, a piece of\nplaster flew past me, and it seemed to have a kind of lightning\nflash following behind it. (E) Before the wall was built up, I took\nspecial care to remove every particle of loose plaster, stone, etc.,,\nfrom the part that had not been disturbed, but before ten minutes\nhad passed another layer, consisting of three or four stones, that\nwere at first fast, had been removed. I have seen the stones,,\nplaster and books thrown to the floor many times.\nThis is a short sketch of my experience at 8 Church Street,\nUpholland. W. WINSTANLEY.\nThe following were questions addressed by Colonel Taylor\nto W. Winstanley, and the latter's answers, referring to points,\nmarked with the corresponding letters in the narrative just given :\n(A) Your brothers were in bed near the wall on this occasion 1\nYes ; they were all in bed.\n(B) Who was in the room with you, and where were they standing ?\nMy brothers were all in bed, and no one else was in the room,\n(c) Again, who was in the neighbourhood ?\nTwo of my brothers were in bed, and the third one was with\nme talking to the policeman. The two in bed were not in a\nposition to hit me on the right shoulder, as they were exactly to-\nthe left of me.\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 137\n(D) Who was in the room besides yourself? If your brothers\nwere in bed, what have you to urge iu support of the theory that\nno one of them threw it, except that they said they did not and\nyou don't think they did 1\nNo one was in the room except myself. My brothers were in\nthe next bedroom, and it was impossible for any of them to throw,\nas it seemed to come exactly from the wall behind me.\n(E) Who was present, and how far from the disturbed part of\nthe wall ? Was it light enough for you to see the stones moved ?\nMy brothers were in bed, about half a yard from the wall. It\n.happened at 2.40 a.m.\nLater, W. Winstanley wrote to Colonel Taylor as follows :\n8 CHURCH STREET, UPHOLLAND, September 17th, 1904.\nDEAR SIR,\nSince you left, Mr. Corless and others have seen both\nlights in the room and pieces thrown nearly every night. Last\nnight 2 pieces of stone were thrown before ten o'clock in the\npresence of two gentlemen from Platt Bridge, near Wigan. Another\n\u2022piece was thrown about 11.30, after every one was in bed. Sorry\nyou did not hear anything.\nYours respectfully,\nW. WINSTANLEY.\nOur readers will not fail to observe that the incidents\nhere described follow closely the usual type of \" Poltergeist \"\nphenomena in three important respects : (a) The particular\nfeatures which would afford the strongest evidence of super\nnormal agency were not observed, but merely inferred : the\nfragments were never seen coming out of the wall, but\nmerely found lying on the floor, or at most seen flying\nthrough the air, the starting point of the flight not having\nbeen noticed, (b) The phenomena most strongly attested seem\nto be but barely beyond what human agency, under the con\nditions as described, could have produced. (c) They ceased\nentirely in the presence of an experienced investigator, and\n\u2022only recommenced after his departure.\nII.\nIn the following case, the phenomena appear to be of an\n-even more dubious nature. This case also was widely reported\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.\nin the papers, and information was sent to us about it by the\nEev. A. C. Custance, of Binbrook Eectory, Market Basen,\nLincolnshire, who kindly gave much assistance in the enquiry.\nHe wrote to us as follows on January 28th, 1905:\n. . . The farm house is occupied by a foreman and his wife\nand two or three children ; some young men and a servant girl\nalso live in the house.\nLeading out of the \"big kitchen\" are two back kitchens, and\nit is in these that the various things have occurred, e.g. :\n(1) Some sausages hung on a string were twice found lying on\nthe ground [and] on being tied even more securely were found\non the floor and separate from the string.\n(2) A number of empty bottles stacked behind the door suddenly\nfell and smashed.\n(3) A dozen plates off the shelf were found in a milk pan\nwhich was full of milk.\n(4) A great can of cream with a stick in it was found topsy\nturvy and the stick laid on the top.\n(5) A large piece of bacon was suddenly seen to fall from where\nit was, and shortly after\n(6) Two large biscuit tins also fell.\n(7) One day, when they were all at dinner in the \" big kitchen,'^\nthe floor was deluged with dirty water; on going into one of\nthe back kitchens, a bucket of dirty water standing near the door\nhad been noiselessly upset.\n(8) On another occasion the foreman went into this very kitchen\nto wash his hands and noticed some pig-meat, of which he is,\nvery fond. He came to the other end to wipe his hands, and,\non turning to go out, saw the bucket was upset and the pig-meat\non the ground.\n(9) This act was repeated in the presence of another man.\n(10) A dead rabbit hanging on a nail in the second back place\nwas found thrown behind a beer barrel twice.\n(11) On the window-sill of kitchen were about a dozen geranium\nplants in pots. One morning they were found lying in a row on\nthe dresser. The wife showed me how they were, but said there\nwas more earth fallen from the one which she had laid down than\nfrom all [the others together] when she found them laid.\n(12) The last thing is the most tragic. On Saturday morning\nat 9 a.m., some of the children's clothes were hanging on the\nguard before a not very good or big fire. Three times some of\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 139'\nthem caught fire and the servant girl called to her mistress and\nthey were put out, but not before they were badly burned.\n(13) About 10 a.m. the foreman started for the village, but\nfound that he had forgotten something he wanted. He ran back\nto the house and found the girl near the door, sweeping the\nfloor. To his astonishment she herself was on fire behind, but\ndid not know it. He put out the flames as well as he could, but\nnot before she was badly burned behind. She is now in the\nhospital at Louth.\nI saw the girl almost daily ; she declared that she did not\nknow she was on fire or how she got on fire.\nI have no reason to think that the people are otherwise than\ntruthful, and I certainly cannot account for these phenomena unless\nit is possible that the girl herself or some one else in the house\nis an \"unconscious medium.\"\nThe people are very anxious that the matter should be sifted,\nand I advised them to wait till the girl returns from the hospital,\nto see if anything happens in her absence. One feature is that,\nwith the exception of the biscuit tins and the bottles, the various\nthings were done without any noise. . . .\nA. C. CUSTANCE.\nFrom a second letter of January 31st, 1905, we make the\nfollowing extracts :\nI am sorry to say that the people at the farm have called in\nthe aid of spiritualists who have already had a seance there, and,\nI believe, with some kind of result. ... I hear that nothing has\nhappened since the girl left. I wrote to the matron about the\nlatter and had a long letter from the doctor in charge of the\ncase ; he seemed to think that there was nothing uncommon about\nthe girl. ... As far as I know, all the phenomena occurred in\nabout a month's time. ... I am not sure that the people would\nlike any investigation other than that made by the spiritualists.\nThe servant will not be out of hospital for two or three months.\nMr. of Grimsby is the spiritualist who has been interesting\nhimself in the matter.\nColonel Taylor, who undertook to enquire into the case,\nreported as follows. His report includes a plan of the premises\n(not reproduced here) showing the large front kitchen with the\nscullery and small back kitchen, both opening out of it on\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.\nthe same side, and the dairy beyond the back kitchen and\nopening into it.\nMarch 8th, 1905.\nOu Monday, February 27th, 1905, I went to Great Grimsby,\nand on the day following drove over to White's Farm to enquire\ninto the matter of the Binbrook Poltergeist.\nTaking as a basis the 13 incidents mentioned by the Eev. A. C.\nCustance in his letter dated January 28th, I questioned Mrs. White\nabout the affair. I have no doubt that she is quite honest in her\nstatements, but she did not impress me as a very good witness.\nTaking the various happenings mentioned by Mr. Custance in\nthe order he gives them (which is, however, not quite the order\nin which they followed one another, as I understood from Mrs. White)\nI made the following notes :\n(1) Mrs. White showed me where these sausages were hung\nacross a string which stretched from side to side of the dairy. I\nmade out that it was the [servant girl M.] who found them on\nthe ground each time, and it was always quite possible for her to\nhave thrown them down herself and then either at once or after\na time pretend to have found them on the floor.\n(2) I make no other remark about this than that the place\nwhere the bottles were was occupied by some shelves which, when\nI saw them, had various things on them in such a way that I should\nnot think a smash improbable at any time.\n(3 and 4) In these cases M. was again the finder and reporter\nof the phenomenon, and it was as in No. 1 quite possible for the\ngirl, who was constantly about the kitchen, the two back rooms\nand the dairy, to have done the mischief and then discovered it.\n(5 and 6) It is not clear to me that the bacon was seen to fall,\nthough Mrs. White's mother was sitting in the kitchen at the\ntime and the girl was about. Mrs. White's mother is no longer\nat the farm, and Mrs. White herself was at the time in bed, not\nhaving yet completely recovered after giving birth to her 4th or\n5th child. As to the biscuit tins, they fell when Mrs. White's\nmother was upstairs and the girl alone below and supposed to be\nengaged in the scullery.\n(7) No one can say when this bucket was upset, and it is quite\npossible that the kitchen \" floor was [observed to be] deluged\nwith dirty water \" some appreciable time after the last person who\nleft the scullery was at table.\n\fOCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 141\n(8 and 9) I did not clearly make out where the girl was when\nthis took place, but I believe she was about her work in this\npart of the house. Mr. White had his back turned to the place\n\u2022when the bucket was first upset, and Gibson, the man Mr. White\n\u2022called in to look, also had his back .turned when the bucket was\n\u2022upset for the second time. (See letter from Mr. Custance appended.)\n(10) About this I heard nothing.\n(11) It was in the window of the front kitchen that these geraniums\n\u2022were ; no one knows when or by what means they were turned down.\n(12) Mrs. White assured me that there was very little fire in the range.\n(13) Mrs. White said she was in the kitchen with the girl, who\n\u2022was sweeping the floor, a few minutes before her husband discovered\nTher to be on fire. She was 6 feet from the fire at the time Mrs.\nWhite saw her last, and had only gone two yards further off when\nthe alarm was given. I was given to understand that the girl's dress\n\u2022caught fire at the waist behind and not below ; but it became clear\n\u2022\u2022to me, after having seen the doctor now in charge of the girl's case in\nhospital, that her petticoats caught fire in the usual way from below.\nMrs. White told me that the first thing which compelled attention\n\u2022was the milk pan being overturned on the last Friday in December,\n1904, and that the other things have happened at irregular intervals up\nto the time of the girl's departure, since which time they have ceased.\nThere was some mystery about the death of some fowls during\n-January\u2014(a) Fowls which were about the farm-yard during the day were\nsometimes found dead with their throats torn. I should account for\nthis by supposing a stoat, a weasel, or rat to have been the agent.\n(J) Fowls found dead or maimed in the fowl-house in the morning.\nMr. the spiritualist, who has interested himself in this case,\ntold me that when this sort of damage was done, the padlock in\nthe fowl-house door was always first removed. Three times was\nthis done, fresh padlocks having been provided : the third time the\npadlock was found near the fowl-house door and the other two\n-subsequently in the farm-yard pond close by.\nI see more human-like procedure in this than ghostly. I suppose\na Poltergeist could get into the fowl-house without the trouble of\nbreaking the lock, and I heard from Mr. Custance something\n.about a discharged farm hand as a possible agent in the matter.\nAbout Mr. White's boys I found out nothing ; I did not see them\nTior were they mentioned by any one I spoke to on the subject of\nthe disturbances ; neither did I see Mr. White, who was out shooting\nAt the time I called.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.\nAfter quitting the farm I called on Mr. distance, who confirmed\nby word of mouth all that he had stated in his letters, but I got\nnothing new from him except that there had been trouble about\nthe fowls and one of the men on the farm had been lately discharged.\nOn my return to Grimsby I saw Mr. who had taken a\n\" sensitive \" to the farm and was quite convinced of the abnormal\ncharacter of the disturbances on account of what his \" medium \" told\nhim, in addition to what he heard from the farm people.\nOn Wednesday morning I went to Louth and saw Dr. G , who\nis attending M. He told me that he had found hysterical symptoms\nin his patient, and that from the nature of the injury she had sustained\nhe agreed with me that the fire must have originated at the bottom\nof the dress and petticoats.\nFrom the Doctor's house I went to the hospital and saw the\ngirl herself; she was now nearly recovered. I do not think sh&\nalways told me the truth in answer to my questions, but [she]\nagreed that the fire began at the bottom of her dress and, as she\nsaid, \"a spark from the fire, I suppose,\" originated it.\nTo sum up. All the phenomena were noiseless, except in two\ninstances ; hence no one knew when they took place, and of the\ntwo exceptions one might easily have been an accident, and the other\noccurred just when M. had the best of opportunities of causing it.\nIn nearly all the cases the girl seems to have been the first to-\ndiscover them. This suggests a previous knowledge on her part.\nThe doctor reports the girl hysterical.\nI do not think we have any right to attribute these disturbances\nto other than human agency, but if there remains anything which\ncannot be thus accounted for, the evidence for it is so weak that\nI don't believe that the case will be of any value to the Society\nfor Psychical Research as an instance of abnormal manifestation.\nLE M. TAYLOR.\nThe following is an extract from the letter from Mr.\nCustance to Colonel Taylor, referred to in the latter's report :\nMarch Uh, 1905.\nI went up to White's Farm this afternoon. I saw both husband\nand wife. I was right as regards the bucket, but wrong as regards\nthe biscuit tins.\nThe latter only fell once, when Mrs. White was upstairs and\nthe girl M. in the back scullery. (Query, Did she move them?)\nThe bucket in that scullery turned over first when White was in\nthere. His wife put it right with the pig's meat in it, and refilled\nit with water, while White had gone to fetch a man named Gibson :\nwhile, however, the latter was in the scullery, and had turned to\ncome out, it went over again !\n\fNo. CCXXIIL\u2014VOL.

Clarke of Dumfries, who is no sooth\nsayer, but a cautious and accomplished physician, told me\nsome time ago of a curious dream that had been brought\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.\nunder his notice, and which he could not by rational analysis\nresolve into normal constituents. It was not a precognitive,\nbut what might be called a co-cognitive dream, in which\nwas represented a series of events occurring simultaneously,\nor almost simultaneously, at a considerable geographical dis\ntance. Knowing that what had created in Dr. Clarke a sense\nof mystery must be worthy of further consideration, I put him\nin communication with Sir William Crookes, and a correspond\nence ensued, Dr. Clarke's part of which is here submitted to\nthe members of the Psychical Research Society.\nCHARLOTTE STREET, DUMFRIES, N.B.\n2'2nd January, 1904.\nDEAR SIR WILLIAM CROOKES,\nI have received your note of 20th inst. about a dream or\nexperience of a mother regarding a fatal accident to her son,\u2014some\nseventy or eighty miles away,\u2014both undoubtedly occurring within\na few minutes of each other.\nThe people concerned are all so respectable, and so far removed\nfrom any suspicion of creating a sensation either about themselves\nor others that I don't think the facts can be questioned. Even the\nsmall discrepancies, such as the dream bridge being the railway-\nbridge visible from the parents' house, and not the one at Paisley\nStation where the accident occurred, the mother still insists upon. . . .\nI propose getting a statement from the mother and from all\nothers who can confirm her story at first hand, signed by each. I\nshall also ask the Hospital Authorities at Paisley to let me have\na full note of the time of admission to the hospital and nature of\nthe injuries of the patient. (He died the morning after admission,\nbut was conscious when found on the railway.) So soon as com\nplete, I shall forward you the statements, and I shall be most\ncareful to be as accurate as possible in every detail, and have inde\npendent confirmation where possible.\nThe dreamer is the least likely woman to have had such a strange\nexperience\u2014a solid, matter-of-fact, practical, hard-working woman\nof the smaller farmer class, who \" had had dreams like other people,\nbut never paid the smallest attention to them, and never once\nthought or believed all her life that they might come true.\"\nYours very truly,\nFRED. HUGH CLARKE.\n\fNov., 1905. Report of a Co-cognitive Dream 147\n3rd February, 1904.\nBefore replying to your letter of the 23rd ult. I waited till I\ncould get a personal interview with the \"dream\" woman. The\nfollowing is a clear statement got from her the other day. She is\nabsolutely trustworthy.\nMrs. Kerr, Gateside, Holywood, Dumfriesshire, one night in June\nten years ago, retired to bed at 10 o'clock. She fell asleep shortly\nafter, and dreamt that she saw one of her sons\u2014a fireman on a\npassenger train,\u2014hanging on to the tender of an engine. As the\nengine passed through a bridge her son's head struck the masonry\nand he fell, the wheels seeming to \" pass up along his body.\" She\nsaw that his right arm was seriously injured and his right leg\ncompletely severed below the knee, the boot being on the foot.\nHe raised his hand to the right side of his head, which she saw\nwas seriously injured.\nShe woke with a scream,\u2014the hour being ten minutes to 11\no'clock. She woke her husband and told him, who tried to assure\nher it was only a dream. (This the husband has confirmed to me.)\nUnable to rest, she got up, lighted the fire, and went to a neigh\nbour's house, Mrs. Dickson, now dead,\u2014to whom she told the\nstory. She also woke Mrs. Mundell, Holywood Kirkhouses, (still\nalive), and asked her to send her son, young Mundell, with a\nmessage to her own son who lived at a distance, begging him to\ncome to her, as an accident had happened to his brother. Before\nthe arrival of the two young men, a telegram arrived at Holywood\nStation at 2 a.m. summoning Mr. and Mrs. Kerr to Paisley Infir\nmary, as their son had met with a serious accident at Paisley\nStation the night before.\nBefore starting for Paisley in the morning Mrs. Kerr told M'Ardle,\nthe Station-Master at Holywood, (and still there), about her dream,\nasserting that her son's injuries were of such a nature that he must\neither be dead, or that he could not possibly recover.\nOn their arrival at Paisley the son was still alive, though uncon\nscious, and he died shortly after. His injuries were exactly as she\nhad seen in her dream. At the coffining the same night she noticed\nthe absence of the right leg, and on asking for it, it was produced\nwith the boot still on the foot.\nThe only discrepancy between the dream and the reality was that\nthe bridge where the accident occurred, (which she visited and saw\nhair and blood on the stonework), was outside Paisley Station, while\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.\nshe insists that the bridge of her dream was one in view of her\nDumfriesshire home.\nMrs. Kerr related to me two somewhat similar experiences. On\nDecember 27th, 1903, when walking along the road about 8 p.m.,\nnear her home, a light as if from a lantern shone in front of her\nfeet. There was neither light nor person near. Her pallor was so\nmarked when [s]he got home that her relatives asked what had\nhappened. She replied that she did not know, but that something\nhad happened to one of the family. Next morning she received a\nletter stating that an aunt had died at that time the night before.\nWhen 21 years of age, Mrs. Kerr had promised to sit up with a\nsick neighbour all night. When about to proceed to the house, the\nform of the sick woman appeared distinctly before her. Mrs. Kerr\nsaid to her friends that there was no need to go now, as the woman\nwas dead. It was found that the woman died at the very time the\napparition appeared.\nMrs. Kerr says she knows quite well when those experiences\nsignify more than mere dreams.\nFEED. HUGH CLARKE.\n25th May, 1904.\nEnclosed you will find\n(1) The official account of the accident to Kerr, supplied by\nthe Secy, of the Glasgow and South Western Railway Co.\n(2) The record in the Case-book of the Paisley Infirmary, where\nKerr was taken to.\n(3) The statement of M. M'Ardle, Station-master at Holywood.\n(4) A statement made to me and signed by Mrs. Mundell and\nher daughter about the events occurring on the morning\nof 15th July, 1894.\nMr. Kerr, the husband, has confirmed to me the statement of his\nwife that she woke him, and told him the dream before the arrival\nof the wire. He is at present living some 5 or 6 miles from Dumfries\nwith a son, so I did not get his signed statement to-day as I had\nhoped, but could procure it. The daughter also told me she knew\nall the details of the dream before her mother and brother left for\nPaisley.\nThe only discrepancy in the various statements is that the\nMundells are almost certain that Mrs. Kerr had received the\nmessage before she woke them. About all the details as already\ngiven of the dream they have no doubt, and told me the story\nexactly as Mrs. Kerr gave it to me.\n\fNov., 1905.

She was certainly told all details of the\ndream the same morning.\nThough very sceptical as to the whole affair at first, I have not\nthe slightest doubt now about the bona fides of the story, and any\nlittle discrepancies are without doubt due to defects of memory\nafter nearly ten years.\nShould you wish further confirmation I shall endeavour to pro\ncure it.\nFRED.

The\nwheels seemed to pass over him, and she saw that his right leg\nwas bleeding, and completely severed below the knee. He had\nalso received other injuries.\nBoth are of opinion that Mrs. Kerr had already received a\nmessage from Holywood Station to the effect that the son had met\nwith an accident before she woke them.\nFor some time after the event it was a subject of common talk\nin the village that Mrs. Kerr should have told them of a dream,.\n\fNov., 1905.

FEED. HUGH CLARKE.\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.\nCASTLEYARDS, TORTHORWALD, DUMFRIESSHIRE,\nOctober llth, 1905.\nThe statement made by me, and as given in the letter to Sir\nWilliam Crookes, of 3rd February, 1904, is true in every particular\nso far as I am aware.\n\"On Soul and Conscience.\" ELLEN KERR.\nCASTLEYARDS, TORTHORWALD, DUMFRIESSHIRE,\nOctober llth, 1905.\nI, the undersigned, James Kerr, certify \" On Soul and Conscience \"\nthat on the night my son met with his fatal accident, my wife woke\nme and told me particulars of the accident, and this before any\ntelegram arrived apprising us of it. JAMES KERR.\nWhen this dream was first mentioned to me by Dr.\nClarke, I was under the impression that it was of recent\noccurrence. The fact that ten years elapsed before the evi\ndence bearing on it was put in writing materially reduces\nthe value of that evidence ; for memory, honest memory, has\na trick not merely of rounding off corners and of creating\ngaps, but of filling up hiatuses and of making things fit in\ngenerally, and under the histrionic tendency in human nature\nthe marvellous is apt to become more and more marvellous\nafter each rehearsal. It is possible, therefore, that Mrs. Kerr's\nrecollection of her dream, and Mrs. and Miss Mundell's recol\nlection of the account she gave of it while it was still\nsimmering in her brain, are more circumstantial and conform\nable to fact than was the dream itself. The testimony of\nMrs. Dickson, to whom Mrs. Kerr first told her dream, and\nwho is unfortunately dead, would have been of great value\nin the exegetical examination of this strange passage. The\ndifficulty of attaining strict accuracy in such matters after an\ninterval of time is illustrated in the documents submitted.\nMrs. Kerr is under the belief that she narrated her dream\nto Mrs. and Miss Mundell before receiving the telegram\nannouncing the accident to her son, but Mrs. and Miss\nMundell believe that she was in possession of the telegram\nbefore she did so. Mrs. Kerr affirms that she told Mr.\nM'Cardle, the station-master at Holywood, about her dream,\nbut Mr. M'Cardle has no remembrance of that. Had she\ndone so, a fact of so startling a nature could scarcely have\n\fNov., 1905. Report of a Co-cognitive Dream. 153\nescaped his recollection in connection with the observation,\nwhich he does recall, that she looked forward with the\ngreatest concern to her son's condition, as without dream-\nwarning she naturally would do when summoned by telegram\nwith her husband to Paisley on a Sunday morning on account\nof \" a serious accident \" to her son. Dr. Clarke's narrative\ntaken down from Mrs. Kerr's lips states that the accident and\ndream occurred in June ; the fact being that they occurred in\nJuly. The letter of the Medical Superintendent of the Royal\nAlexandra Infirmary, Paisley, sets forth that Edward Kerr, a\nfireman, was admitted on the 14th July, 1894, suffering from\nfractured skull and compound fracture of the leg, the result of\na railway accident, and died on July 16th, within 48 hours\nof his admission, the facts being that he died on July 15th,\nwithin twelve hours of his admission.\nIt was natural that Mrs. Kerr, an affectionate mother,\nshould from time to time feel anxious about her son, follow\ning the somewhat dangerous occupation of a fireman on a\nlocomotive engine ; it was in the ordinary course of things\nthat her anxiety should from time to time take shape in\nvisions of the night, and the occurrence of such a vision on\nthe particular night on which an accident actually happened\nto him would have been a coincidence and nothing more had\nnot the nature of the vision been unique, and had not its\ndetails corresponded exactly with the details of the accident\nwhich was taking place contemporaneously with it.\nMrs. Kerr's dream was no common one ; it was not even\none of those rarer lurid dreams that startle, interrupt sleep,\nand set the heart beating for a little, but are recognised as\nmere dreams and discarded. It was a dream vivid to the\nverge of eye-sight, and leaving behind it a sense of the super\nnatural. Mrs. Kerr awoke with a scream, aroused her husband,\ntold him her dream, was uncomposed by his assurances, got\nup and lighted the fire. That much is clearly established.\nWhether it was before or after receiving the telegram\nannouncing the serious accident to her son, and summoning\nher and her husband to Paisley, that Mrs. Kerr visited her\nneighbours, Mrs. Dickson and Mrs. Mundell, communicated to\nthem her dream, and sent for her younger son living at a\ndistance, must remain in doubt. If she did all this before\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.\nreceiving the telegram, then she must have been profoundly\nimpressed by the ominous nature of her dreani ; if she did it\nafter receiving the telegram, her conduct was what might\nhave been expected, and magnification of the dream may have\ntaken place in the light of the terrible news brought to her.\nThat Mrs. Kerr is correct in maintaining that she communi\ncated her dream-born apprehensions to her neighbours before\nany telegraphic confirmation of them had reached her is made\nprobable by the statement of Mrs. and Miss Mundell that\nMrs. Kerr called them up \" after midnight,\" whereas Mr.\nM'Cardle, the station-master, states that the telegram from\nPaisley arrived at Holywood between 1 and 2 o'clock a.m.\nBut it is in the minutiae of Mrs. Kerr's dream, and in their\nexact correspondence with the details of the catastrophe that\nbefell her son, that its remarkable character is manifested.\nMrs. Kerr dreamt that her son fell from the tender of the\nengine.\nHe actually did so.\nShe dreamt that his head struck the masonry of a bridge.\nThat is what actually took place, and she afterwards saw\nhis hair and blood adhering to the stonework.\nShe dreamt that the wheels seemed \" to pass up along his\nbody.\"\nThe official report says he \" rebounded against the train.\"\nShe dreamt that his head was seriously injured on the\nright side.\nThe official report shows that the skull was fractured on\nthe right side.\nShe dreamt that his right arm was seriously injured, and\nhis right leg completely severed below the knee.\nThe official and medical reports set forth that the right arm\nwas seriously injured, and that there was a compound fracture\nof the right leg necessitating amputation at the knee.\nShe dreamt that the boot remained upon the foot of the\nsevered foot.\nWhen the amputated leg was produced to be placed in the\ncoffin it was seen that the boot was still on the foot.\nMrs. Kerr's dream ended by her clock at 10.50 p.m.\nThe accident, according to the official report, took place\n\"about 10.35.\" Allowing for possible inaccuracy in the clock\n\fNov., 1905. . Report of a Co-cognitive Dream. 155\nor in the noting and reporting of the time, the dream and the\naccident must have been nearly if not absolutely simultaneous.\nNow no theory of coincidence can cover the correspondence\nbetween the details of the dream and the facts in this case.\nThe chances are, I suppose, a million to one against such a\n\" concatenation accordingly \" happening by chance. The facts\nare undoubted ; the dream is well attested. Even the little\ndiscrepancies between the dream and the facts\u2014Mrs. Kerr's\nimpression that the accident took place at a bridge in view of\nher own house, instead of at a bridge at Paisley, and that\nthe leg was severed during the accident instead of subsequently\nby amputation\u2014are in favour of the fidelity of her narrative\nand opposed to any supposition of concoction.\nThe dreamer is, as Dr. Clarke says, \" a solid, matter-of-fact,\npractical, hard-working woman.\" She belongs to a class\u2014the\nsmaller farm class of Scotland\u2014sternly veracious, unimaginative\nin the larger sense, but not free from superstition. She had\nnever paid the smallest attention to dreams, or believed they\nmight come true, but she had once seen a death-warning light\nand once a wraith. It might therefore be held, on the one\nhand, that she was a woman constitutionally susceptible to\nsubtle and occult influences ; on the other, that she was prone\nto hallucination and self-deception. If the dream rested solely\non Mrs. Kerr's recollection of it, it might be set down to\nunconscious exaggeration, confusion of thought, embellishment,\nbut it is fully and directly corroborated in all particulars by\nthe husband and daughter arid by Mrs. and Miss Mundell,\nand is vaguely supported by many neighbours who remember\nthat immediately after the fatal accident to Edward Kerr, his\nmother's wonderful dream was the subject of general discussion\nin the parish. It is much to be regretted that it was not\nthen caught and thoroughly sifted by some competent inquisitor.\nI attempt here no explanation of the dream, but I think\nit is deserving of being placed on record. It is very similar\nin character to a dream experienced by Dr. Walter Bruce, of\nMicanopy, U.S.A., and reported in Human Personality (Vol. I.\npp. 413-15), and is of the class referred to by Sir Thomas\nBrowne in his Letter to a Friend upon occasion of the Death\nof this Friend. \" Although at this distance,\" he says, \" you\nhad no early account or particular of his death, yet your affec\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.\ntion may not cease to wonder that you had not some secret\nsense or intimation thereof by dreams, thoughtful whisperings,\nmercurisms, airy nuncios or sympathetical insinuations, which\nmany seem to have had at the death of their dearest friends.\"\nThe scientific study of dreams has yet to be undertaken. If\na number of persons who waste their time in keeping diaries,\nwearisome registers of humdrum existence and frivolous events,\nwould take to keeping noctuaries instead, and would faithfully\njot down their dreams each morning, and where practicable\nconnect these with their waking experiences before and after,\nwe should soon have some valuable material to work on. I\nfeel sure that dreams have sometimes a pathological significance\nthat is not sufficiently attended to.\nGASP; OF TEANCE WITH CONTINUOUS MEMORY.\nTHE following report of a case of spontaneous trance was sent\nto us by an Associate of the Society, the Rev. J. W. Hayes,\nVicar of West Thurrock, Grays, Essex. Mr. Hayes observes\nthat one sees in it \" the same apparently malicious propensities\nwhich usually accompany the appearance of the secondary or sub-\nconsciousness.\" An interesting feature in the case is that there\nseems to have been an inhibition of will-power, coupled with\nan underlying continuity of consciousness and memory, which\nwas only discovered by a careful subsequent cross-examination\nof the patient ; whereas in these cases a complete break in\nmemory or loss of memory generally occurs, or is alleged to\noccur. In this respect the case shows some analogies with\nthe instructive autobiographical account of some phenomena\nof \" pseudo-possession \" given by Mr. C. Hill Tout in the\nProceedings, Vol. XL pp. 309-316. We also find in hypnotic\ncases the same complete, though veiled, consciousness of all\nthe real surroundings of the subject or patient, together with\na frequent subsequent recollection of the events of the\nsecondary condition.\nOctober 3rd, 1905.\nOn Sunday, October 1st, 1905, about 8.45 p.m., on a dark even\ning, I, Joseph W. Hayes, Vicar of West Thurrock with Purfleet,\n\fNov., 1905. Case of Trance with Continuous Memory. 157\nGrays, Essex, was returning from Purfleet after divine service when\nI saw several persons around the vicarage door, and soon found that\nsome one lay stretched on the sofa in the dining room in a sort of\nfaint. Those present were trying to restore the patient to her normal\ncondition by slapping her with a wet cloth, application of smelling\nsalts, and rubbing, but no particular result followed. She lay in the\ntrance from 8.30 p.m. to about 12 p.m. I had hot jars put to her\nfeet and a rubber hot-water bottle applied to her hands, also tried\nto make her swallow hot coffee and spirits, but the teeth were firmly\nclenched, the face pallid, the extremities cold, the lips pale, and the\neyelids tremulous but closed. The patient had been engaged in\nsinging hymns at an outdoor meeting, and collapsed after gazing at\nthe bright lamp for a few moments, falling helpless to the ground,\nfrom whence she was carried to the sofa of the vicarage. She is a\nyoung married woman of about 26 or 30 years of age, the wife of\na bright young man, but with no family. For a long time past she\nhas been engaged in outdoor evangelistic work, and is religious, sincere,\nunpretending, and of excellent character. She is of the emotional\ntype, somewhat hysterical, with eyes somewhat larger than usual.\nShe was anxious about the salvation of her husband and much\ninterested in his spiritual welfare, stating that she is confident as\nto her own spiritual condition. Her name is Mrs. J. Parkhurst, of\n31 Darnley Road, Grays, Essex. She is of medium height, and\nrather darkish hair.\nI got some whisky and asked a Mr. B. Smith to rub one hand\nwhile I rubbed the other, but after nearly 20 minutes we grew\ntired, and yet the heat was very slow to return. It then struck\nme that it must be a case of hypnotic trance, or similar trance, with\nwhich I had been familiar years ago, and the fact of the respiration\nbeing so even convinced me that I was right. From that on I treated\nthe matter in a light trifling mood, and said to those around, \"There\nis no danger, it is but a case of trance, and she will come to herself\nlater on.\" I knew from that on that she heard all we said, although\nso motionless, and so I was cautious what I did say. Then after a\nwhile, about 10 o'clock, I sent for her husband and also for Dr.\nSteward, New Road, Grays, telling the messenger to say distinctly\nthat it was \" a case of hysterical trance \" (the way he would know\nwhat to bring). Then I stooped down and, with a spoon and the\nhandle of a tooth brush, tried to open her jaws ; at this she was\nconvulsed with suppressed laughter, but never opened her eyes.\nThen I said, \"Open your eyes, you are only humbugging us. If\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.\nyou do not waken I will get something cruel\u2014a hot iron or a\nbatterjr.\" But she made no movement. I then said to those present,\n\"She hears all we say, but cannot waken herself. It is 26 years\nago since I saw a case like it. Patients in this state are full of\ntricks and do most outlandish things ; they sometimes use very bad\nlanguage, for which they are scarcely responsible, and cannot be\naroused except by a shock, such as a cry of fire, a loud voice,\napplication of a battery or a hot iron.\"\nAbout 11 o'clock her husband came, and, stooping over her,\ncalled her name, but she moved not. Then he pinched her\nnostrils and held her breath, but with no better effect. During\na short portion of the time she sobbed and said, \" He won't be\nsaved, he won't be saved.\" I said, \"Who?\" and she said, \"Jack.\"\nShortly afterwards her husband and Mrs. Philbey and myself\ntook her home to Grays in a cab, still apparently unconscious,\ncarried her upstairs, and intended to place her in bed. While doing\nso I fell and the patient fell upon me, whereupon she again burst\nout laughing, with the teeth clenched and eyes closed. After a few\nminutes she relapsed into the same state of coma, but after I had\nleft the house about an hour, or less, I heard she awakened quietly,\nwhile her husband was in the room, but not near her. She felt better\nand expressed regret at the trouble she had caused, but distinctly\nremembered every incident from the hymn and address by Mr. Philbey\nto the moment I fell in the bedroom.\nOn Monday, October [2nd], I went to see her at one o'clock\nand enquire particulars. She met me at the door quite cheer}',\nand looking well. Having asked her to relate the incidents of\nthe previous night, she said, \"After I sang I listened to Mr.\nPhilbey's address, and one or two of the things he said seemed\nto come home to me and suit my husband's case. The lamp\nthen attracted me, and as I gazed at it I felt drawn to it, and\nthen, feeling queer, fell. Then they carried me into the vicarage and\nI knew they were getting frightened because I did not revive. They\nwere getting more frightened until you came, and you seemed to\nunderstand the case, and I felt that they became less alarmed. I\nnever lost consciousness any part of the time, but heard all they\nsaid and knew what they were doing, but I seemed not to have the\npower to use my will. I heard you say, ' There is no danger at\nall, it is simply a case of hysterical or hypnotic trance. Was she\ngazing at a light ? ' You then said, ' Get the hot-water bottle and\nrub her hands well, we must get the blood back from the heart to\n\fNov., 1905. Case of Trance with Continuous Memory. 159\nthe extremities.' Then when I was a little warmer you pinched my\nears and said, 'Get me some hot coffee and get me a spoon and a\ntoothbrush.' The spoon holding the coffee was hot and burned my\nlips, so I turned my head quickly aside. You then tried to pull\nmy eyes open, and slapped them with a wet cloth. When you tried\nto open my mouth with the spoon I laughed, because I thought it\ngreat fun that you could not open my jaws. It afforded me much\namusement, and I felt that I was purposely keeping my teeth closed,\nbut why I should do it I don't know. Then I heard you say,\n'Wake up and don't be humbugging us.' I remember opening my\neyes for a moment and seeing three ladies around me, one with a\nblack hat, also Mr. Philbey and Mr. Smith. It amused me to see\nyou all trying to waken me. I heard you say, 'Get the book and\nread out the directions to recover a fainting person,' and then I heard\nsome one reading it. I could not see with my eyes closed. I felt\nI was doing it on purpose, and quite enjoyed the fuss you were all\nmaking, but still I had not the will to stop it. Of course after I\nreally wakened, about a quarter to twelve, I was sorry to have\ncaused such a commotion, but I was not a bit sorry at the time.\nI recollect coming home in the cab and also your fall upstairs. That\nwas so funny I had to laugh. I was very near wakening twice,\nfirst when Mr. Smith pressed my hands too long on the hot-water\njar, and I felt them burning, and more so when I heard you say,\n'The only thing to rouse her is a hot iron.' I thought to myself,\n' This won't do, I must waken before the hot iron comes,' but as it did\nnot arrive I did not waken. I felt that although it was I who was\ndoing all this, and doing it purposely, yet I could not use my will\nagainst it. Further than this I cannot explain, as I do not under\nstand faints. I had this sort of faint once before, but not for so\nlong a time, nor was I gazing at any light on the former occasion.\nIt came on suddenly. In that case Dr. Ward held my nose tightly\nand I awoke. Thank you very much for your kindness and the\nothers also.\"\nSigned as an accurate account,\nJOSEPH W. HAYES,\nVicar of West Thurrock, Essex.\nNote.\u2014Mr. M. S. W.

DEC., 1905.\nPRIVATE MEETING- FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.\nTHE 13th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only\nwas held in the Large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London,\nW., on Friday, October 27th, 1905, at 4 p.m.; Sir Oliver\nLodge in the chair.\nTHE HON. EVERARD FEILDING, after stating that he proposed\nto change the subject of the paper which he had been announced\nto read, spoke to the following effect :\nI have no paper, and if the remarks which I am about to\nmake required a title, I would suggest that of \" The Haunted\nSolicitor, an Unfinished Comedy.\" The case of this gentleman\nfirst came before me about Christmas last, when I received\na letter from an Honorary Associate of the Society, Dr. S.,\nin which he stated that a \" Poltergeist \" had broken out in\nhis town, and that long and careful observations of the pheno\nmena had forced him to the conclusion that they were of a\nsupernormal character, a conclusion in which he felt all the\nmore confidence in that he had been assisted in his researches\nby a professional conjuror who had confessed himself unable\nto account, by means of any trickery known to him, for a\nlarge number of the occurrences. I accordingly, at the end\nof my summer holiday, repaired to the town of N. to join Dr. S.\nin his observations. There I learnt that in 1900 a certain\nDr. Q. had been found guilty of a fraud of so complicated\nand at the same time motiveless a character that he was\nremitted for observation to a lunatic asylum, and was sub\nsequently declared irresponsible for his actions. I mention this\nincident only because of its possible psychological bearing on\nwhat followed.\nIn 1904 Dr. Q., now apparently cured, became a solicitor,\nand set up in business with an office boy, the premises being\nshared with a lodger, an engineer of a superior class. To\nwards the end of the year, according to Dr. Q.'s story, he\nfound that small articles began to be thrown about in his\noffice without visible cause\u2014sealing wax, pens, matches, cushions,\netc. These manifestations increased to such an extent that\nhe ultimately invited Dr. S., who was known to be interested\nin psychic phenomena, to come and investigate the matter.\n\fDEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 163\nDr. S. accordingly entered upon a long series of careful obser\nvations, spending some 20 days and 40 nights at the office,\nduring which period he sometimes witnessed as many as 50\nor more \" phenomena \" at a sitting. Many, if not most, of the\nthrows were within the competence of the mediums, i.e. Dr. Q.\nhimself, the boy, the engineer, and later a clerk, who took\nthe place of the original boy. But there was a considerable\nbalance which he considered entirely beyond the possibility of\nfraudulent accomplishment. According to his observations,\nobjects were frequently thrown in orbits impossible to them,\ni.e. from a corner of the room where no one was, towards\nthe mediums. Sometimes objects, which Dr. S. had placed\nin an adjoining room immediately before, were thrown in\nthe stance room ; and very frequently, when all the persons\npresent had left the room, Dr. S. coming last, objects were\nthrown at him from behind, or could be seen, on his turning\nsuddenly round on the threshold, to be following him out.\nHe called in the assistance of Mr. M., a well-known conjuror.\nMr. M., who, having shown up Miss Fay and Prau Abend\nsome years before, naturally rather fancied himself as an\nexposer of mediums, arrived in a completely sceptical state\nof mind, but in the course of some seven stances became\nconvinced of the impossibility of their accomplishment by any\ntrickery known to him, and retired baffled declaring himself\nconvinced that some agency other than mere trickery was\nconcerned. The matter ultimately reached the newspapers, and\nbecame the talk of the town. Persons visiting the offices had\nbeen the victims of the \" poltergeist.\" A piece of sealing wax\nwould fly at the nose of one, a candle would drop mysteriously\ninto the hat of another. Clients fell away. \" Either,\" they\nargued, \" our solicitor is a knave or a fool, which is bad ;\nor he has a devil, which is worse. And in either case he\nis not a fit person to whom to entrust our business, and\nwe will not employ him.\" So they didn't, and Dr. Q.\nlanguished, and his financial affairs reached a state of crisis.\nNow, it will be recognised that this was therefore a polter\ngeist with very respectable credentials. It had, at the time\nof my arrival, continued under close observation for some ten\nmonths. It had been vouched for by a man of science, Dr. S.,\nand by a professor of legerdemain. It had ruined its chief\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1905.\nmedium. During the endless stances it had come hopelessly\nto bore the rest. Motive, if it was fraudulent, seemed absent.\nThe engineer, who had till then generally attended its per\nformances, had all to lose professionally by his connection with\nit. If the phenomena were fraudulent, it was evident on\nanalysis that all four mediums, Dr. Q., the engineer, the boy,\nand the new clerk, must individually each be implicated. Thus,\nthough the previous mental disturbance of Dr. Q. might over\ncome the difficulty caused by the apparent absence of motive\nso far as he was concerned, there was no reasonable explana\ntion for the conduct of the others. No money had passed,\nexcept that Dr. S. had given Dr. Q. \u00a33 towards the rent of\nhis rooms and paid a small fee to the boy for his attend\nances. A practical joke at Dr. S.'s expense would be worn\nrather thin after 60 stances, lasting frequently from 9 p.m.\ntill 1 or 2 in the morning. And yet it went on.\nDr. S. stated that he noticed that the phenomena were\nnot constant. For some time they would be very active, and\nthen a period of comparative quiescence would supervene. It\nappeared unhappily that my arrival took place at a \" mini\nmum period.\" Dr. Q. declared that he had lost so much\nthrough the goings on , of his poltergeist that he could only\nconsent for the future to exhibit it against a fee of 10s.\nnightly, and 5s. for the clerk. Foolishly, I consented to pay\nthis amount, and the seances began. A number of small\nobjects were placed about the room for the poltergeist to play\nwith, and a map was made of their whereabouts. When the\nmediums were closely watched nothing whatever occurred, and\nexceedingly little when they were not. By way of experi\nment opportunities were frequently given them to do their\nworst, yet the phenomena lagged distressingly. During the first\neight seances there were under twenty throws. All of them\nwere well within the competence of the mediums, i.e. Dr. Q.\nand his new clerk, and even then almost always took place when\nour backs were turned, and never when both mediums were\nunder close observation. A screw would fall in the corner, or\na small firework bomb would explode upon the floor just\nwhen my attention was diverted. An ash tray would fall at\nmy feet just when I was playing a stroke at billiards. A\nstone would fly against the wall when I was looking in\n\fDEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 165\nanother direction, and when it was picked up would be found\nto be warm. When, as was occasionally done, the medium's\nhands were tied, even these modest phenomena ceased altogether.\nThe proceedings were inconceivably ridiculous. The stances\ntook place in a room, generally in Dr. S.'s house, brilliantly\nlit with gas. Dr. Q. would occasionally count \" 1, 2, 3 ! \" in\nthe expectation that something would jump. It never did.\nOr we would be told to rush furiously from the room in the\nexpectation, based on earlier experiences, that something would\nfollow after us, swept up as it were in a kind of psychic vortex.\nBut the expectation was always disappointed. A pear would be\nplaced in a plate. \" Now, see this jump ! \" said Dr. Q. Every\none turned his back. \"1, 2, 3 ! \" Every one turned quickly\nround again ; the pear remained peaceably seated in the plate.\nAt the end of eight seances I declined to continue, and\nexpressed a decided opinion, which was not favourable to the\nevidence for the intervention of a competent poltergeist. Dr. Q.\nwas moved almost to tears. Dr. S. was exasperated. \" I\nadmit,\" he said, \" that all you have seen is merely suspicious.\nBut this is, as I have said, a ' minimum period.' The\nphenomena we now get cannot be controlled, unless by a lucky\nchance, and their present character and rarity is doubtless as\nvexing to the mediums as to yourself, and it is not on things\nof this kind that I and the conjuror have formed our opinion.\"\nAn argument of this kind was of course unanswerable.\nAfter all, what was a poltergeist ? A geist which poltered.\nThis unquestionably poltered. Therefore, it might be a polter\ngeist. I accordingly agreed to remain one night longer to see\nwhat would happen when the mediums were reinforced by the\nengineer, who had hitherto declined to attend except once, and\nwho promised to be present. Much happened. But instead\nof the objects in the room being thrown, other objects\u2014a lump\nof sugar, a key, coins, buttons, etc.\u2014which had not been there\nbefore, made their appearance, and two large fireworks went\noff with a great smell and clatter. The poltergeist had at length\nbeen goaded into activity, and brought off a fine effort, but,\nunhappily, as usual just when no one was looking. Dr. Q.\nwas triumphant. \" Are you convinced ? \" he asked. \" Quite,\"\nI answered. \" 1 shall leave to-morrow, but I think you might\nhave made a better show.\"\n\f166 . Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEO., 1905.\nNext day I received a visit from Dr. Q., who appeared\ndistressed at the effect produced by his poltergeist, whose\ngenuineness he still vigorously proclaimed. His reputation as\na solicitor, he said, would suffer, even worse than it had done\nalready, by my contrary conclusion. I sympathised deeply\nwith his grief, but disclaimed responsibility for this conse\nquence. If the poltergeist chose to conduct itself precisely in\nsuch a way as to cover itself and its mediums with derision,\nthat was not my fault. I pointed out, however, that its late\nperformances at all events rendered control more possible.\nWhile it had confined its attention to a number of small\nobjects inside a room in which the mediums were allowed to\nwalk about, and always threw them when. I was not looking,\nit could only be said that its ineptitude was paralleled by its\ntimidity. But now that it had taken to introducing external\nobjects, the situation had changed. It had itself suggested a\nmethod of proving its own existence. Steps could at least be\ntaken to meet it on its new ground. If the mediums would\nconsent to be adequately searched before the seance, and the\npoltergeist nevertheless continued its activities, it would at least\nbegin to merit a certain measure of respect. I added that I\nwas not prepared to go on paying for the pleasure of seeing\nit try, but that if it succeeded under the conditions of search\nwhich we should impose, I would pay him \u00a310. \"Done,\" said\nDr. Q. The poltergeist was at all events a sportsman.\nAnd as my summer holiday was not yet finished, and N. was\na pleasant place, I decided to be no less. I cancelled my\ntickets, and sat down to await events.\nMy narrative till now has been long, though the time to\nwhich it relates was short. The reverse must now be the\ncase, and I hurry over the final scenes. The conditions of\nthe stances became severe. The mediums were stripped naked\nand elaborately searched, given new clothes, and brought into\nthe stance room, which had previously been carefully examined.\nOn three occasions \" apports \" nevertheless made their appear\nance, i.e. (1) 6 small firework bombs about the size of the\nend joint of a little finger and a stone of rather larger\ndimensions ; (2) 5 stones, of which the largest was about an\ninch in diameter, and the others not much smaller ; (3) 6 more\nbombs.\n\fDEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 167\nBetween these occasions there were long blanks. Night\nsucceeded night, and nothing happened. The objects in the\nroom were immovable. The mediums consented to any and\n\u2022every condition. Their frankness and cheerfulness were enough\nto disarm an ironclad. The clerk was especially most winning.\nHe made half-confidences, admitted having thrown things when\nin the office in order to 6pater Dr. Q., and stated that the boy\nand the engineer had done the same. He said that at first\nhe had believed the whole thing to be attributable to this\nform of jest, but had gradually become convinced it contained\na further element, and he denied ever having \" assisted \" the\nphenomena during the stances with Dr. S. or with me. The\nboy, whom I twice saw, made a statement to precisely the\nsame effect. He, too, had often imitated the poltergeist in\norder to take a rise out of Dr. Q., but never during the formal\nstances. He supposed the thing was a joke somehow, though\nhe didn't know how the joke was done, or who had done it.\nBut it must be a joke for all that, for he didn't believe in\nghosts, and things couldn't move of themselves\u2014a simple\nphilosophy, but apparently honest. Its soundness was strongly\ndisputed by Mr. M., the conjuror, who then appeared on the\nscene. He too disbelieved in ghosts, or had done. But he\nknew something about trickery, and the things he had seen\nwere not within its range. Objects had been thrown at him\nwhile alone in the brilliantly-lighted room, and from a direction\nopposite to the door of the adjoining room in which were the\nmediums. Objects which he had himself just marked and put\non a table were immediately afterwards thrown at him from\nbehind, when the mediums were within view and in front of\nhim. Objects which he had noticed in a particular place, and\nthe movement of which he felt would be evidential if it only\noccurred, were, within a second, thrown accordingly, the mediums\nbeing again within view and at a distance. Finally, there were\nthe long and careful observations of Dr. S., the notes of which,\nmade contemporaneously, I went through with his assistance,\nand which, if accurate, seemed clearly beyond explanation by\nnormal means.\nThe effect of all this on my own mind was singular. I\nappeared to lose touch with actualities. Once admit the pos\nsibility of such things\u2014and the mere fact of investigating them\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEO., 1905.\nimplied such an admission\u2014where could one stop ? I wrote at\nthe time that I began gradually to feel that if a man seriously\ntold me that the statue of the Albert Memorial had called in\nto tea, I should have to admit that the question to be solved\nwould not be the sanity of the narrator, but the evidence for\nthe fact ! Slowly, my sense of the probability of things began\nto decay. When \" phenomena \" happened, it is true, my mind\nsuffered a violent reaction : I felt I had been \" done \" in some\nunascertainable way. But when they didn't, as was generally\nthe case, I took to reflecting \" what honest mediums ! \" For\nthough our watchfulness as to \" apports \" was undiminished, we\nleft them a free hand as to ordinary \" throws.\" Yet no-\n\" throws \" took place, while \" apports \" did.\nThe end was dramatic. Partly by luck, partly by obser\nvation, and partly by a consequent statement wrung from the^\nclerk, we discovered the secret. The method employed was.\nthe more ingenious in that our minds had fixed upon it early\nin the proceedings, and its possibility was discussed and\neventually dismissed, after apparently adequate means had been\ntaken to guard against it. It was, alas, physiological rather\nthan psychical, and involved the use of a tubular instrument,\nabout 7 inches in length and an inch in diameter, pointed at\nboth ends. The method is not unknown to native workmen at\nDe Beers, but its employment by a sober solicitor was certainly\nsurprising. The size and character of the so-called \" apports \"\nhad seemed to make its adoption impossible, but the use of the\ninstrument, a refinement upon native practice added by Dr. Q.,.\nhad facilitated it. Our imaginations had indeed been fairly\nactive, but had failed to soar to that. Dr. Q., who, to do him\njustice, had shown considerable heroism in the cause of his\npoltergeist, admitted that he had been at last found out, and\nsupplied interesting details of his modus operandi.\nI shall be asked, why then do I call the comedy \" unfinished \" ?\nWell, the confession is still incomplete. Dr. Q. admits the\nfraudulent character of the \" apports,\" but denies that he had\nany part in producing the earlier phenomena. In this he is.\nsupported by the clerk, whose own statement had enabled us\nto bring home the ultimate fraud, in which he certainly had\nno part, and of which, had it not been for Dr. Q.'s recklessness,\nhe might have had no knowledge ; also, on a subsequent cross\n\fDEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 1 6J>\nexamination, by the engineer and the boy. I have, of course,,\nno temptation to pay the slightest heed to statements proceed\ning from such tainted sources, for the clerk's belated statement\nwas only made under fear of immediate discovery. But I am\nconfronted with the observations of my predecessors, who are\ndisinclined to modify their views as to .their accuracy, notwith\nstanding the subsequent catastrophe. It is a dilemma of which\neither horn seems equally uncomfortable. If, then, this polter\ngeist desires to pass into history as a well attested hobgoblin,,\nit can at least produce as its credentials the evidence of a man\nof science and of a professor of legerdemain. Though of course\nhe agrees that the phenomena during my stay, even when not\nproved to be fraudulent, were uniformly suspicious, the former is-\ninclined to say, \" This was at one time a perfectly respectable\nghost, or other supernormal form of agency, and you with\nyour money and your scepticism have debauched it.\" Well,\u2014\nperhaps. If poltergeists are, this was possibly one once. But\nmy own observations, at least, are certainly not encouraging to\na belief in it.1\nAfter some discussion of this case and an adjournment for\ntea, SIR WILLIAM CROOKES took the chair and SIR OLIVER\nLODGE gave a brief account of some sittings he had lately\nhad in the company of Dr. Maxwell at Bordeaux, the medium\nbeing a person well known to Dr. Maxwell and with whom\nsome of the phenomena described in his recent book Les\nPMnombnes Psychiques had been obtained.\nIn these sittings, raps occurred, but chiefly of a non-\nevidential character, viz. with contact ; sometimes they were\nobtained by means of a pencil held point downwards on the\ntable by the medium, the point touching the table continu\nously, and small shocks coming down the pencil ; they were such\nas might possibly be due to some unconscious muscular action\n1 Dr. S., to whom the above has been submitted, writes that he cannot recede\nfrom his original opinion on the following grounds :\n(1) That the original \" evidential \" throws had taken place at a time when he-\nfully believed Dr. Q. to be fraudulent.\n(2) That the first exposure had regard to apports only, which had nothing\nwhatever to do with the \" evidential \" throws.\n(3) That the exposure threw no light on the way in which the \" evidential \"'\nthrows could have been done by any method of fraud.\n(4) That the confession of fraud is limited entirely to the apports.\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1905.\non the part of the medium, but they showed subconscious\nintelligence, and appeared perfectly honest. Only occasionally\nhad they got raps without contact, and on one occasion he had\nseen in a good light a table move slightly without apparent\ncontact ; instead of rapping, the table gave intelligent jerks or\nlittle sudden movements, but how they were caused he was not\nprepared to say. These also, however, he considered honest.\nAs to lights, those seen while he was there were of a dim\nand faint description, little better than a dim glow, and were\nseen moving about near the medium. Once or twice they saw\nsparks rapidly moving like glow-worms and luminous patches\nthrown on the wall behind the medium. The movement of\nthese lights sometimes indicated intelligence.\nOn one occasion when they were sitting for lights, and not\ngetting them, in a small room which had a high window with\nborrowed light, the control \" Chappe \" said by raps through the\npencil, \" It is not quite dark.\" \" Yes, it is.\" \" No, it is not,\nlight is coming through the window.\" Then they observed\nthat some outer covering over the window had slipped a little,\nand a faint gleam was the result. Chappe wished the medium\nto go out and readjust it. The medium and Dr. Maxwell\naccordingly went out, he himself remaining in the dark, and\non their returning he noticed that the medium was glowing\nwith light, all over\u2014on skin of face and neck and clothes.\nDr. Maxwell could see nothing, having been out in the light.\nAfter this he tried to discover the cause of the luminosity\nof the medium after exposure to light. It was not of the\nnature of that due to phosphorus, but was a case of stored\nluminosity akin to that of sulphide of calcium. He tested the\nmedium's clothing, hair-brushes, etc., and found them all\nluminous, and the fact that the oldest garments were the most\nluminous, and were examined without forewarning the medium,\ntended in the direction of genuineness, a possible explanation\nbeing that the medium secreted a luminous perspiration, pro\nbably containing calcium sulphide. At any rate the effect can\nbe imitated by the artificial use of calcic sulphide ; and the\nperspiration is being analysed. He was not sure whether this\nwas a novel experience or not, but Professor Eichet, when\nconsulted about it, said it was new to him. He tested the\nphenomenon carefully, thoroughly cleaning the neck of the medium\n\fDEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 171\nby chemical means, and examining the skin in the dark, after\nwhich Dr. Maxwell wrapped him up, and made him exercise\nhimself under strict supervision until he perspired again,\nthen exposed him to sunshine, and finally brought him in\nto be examined by the observer, who remained in the dark\nfor that purpose. The skin was then found to be lumin\nous under crucial conditions ; so that what had appeared as\na suspicious circumstance turned out to be a natural\nphysiological phenomenon, which may possibly be of occult\ninterest, since it may account for the chemical basis of some\nof the lights produced at sittings. It may also explain the\nalleged luminosity of certain mediaeval saints. He saw no clear\nreason at present for regarding it as a mediumistic pheno\nmenon. The medium was taking at the time a tonic contain\ning a phosphate of lime, and he also ate six eggs a day, which\n\u2022contain sulphur, so that after all it may be possibly a simple\nphysiological or rather a pathological phenomenon. But it\nmust be further investigated, and must be tried with other\npersons. These experiments are going on.\nIt may be worth while to add that \"Chappe\" claimed responsi\nbility for introducing the phenomenon to notice, by having sent\nthe medium out into the light ; and, when catechised about\nit, replied first that it would be interessant & analyser, and\nlater gave, also by means of raps, the following sentence\nregarding it : Les phosphorescences se voient qu'avec un vdtement\nleger et it travers celui-ci toutes les fois qu'un sujet sensible absorbe\n\u2022des preparations phosphorus il elimine par la peau le phosphore.\nSir Oliver Lodge then proceeded to give a brief preliminary\nnotice, calling attention to Professor's Eichet's recent experi\nments in materialisations at the house of a leading private\nfamily in Algiers, which would be shortly described by Prof.\nEichet in the Annals of Psychical Science. The experi\nments, according to Professor Eichet's account, were con\nducted in a room with a corner curtained off, behind which\ntwo young persons were sitting, the medium (a young\nlady of 18 or 19) with sometimes one servant, sometimes\nanother. Then a figure materialised, the curtains were thrown\nback, and the phantom appeared. The light used was a\ndull red light, but sufficient for enabling them to see\nthe whereabouts of the two people in the corner, and to see\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1905.\nthe figure more easily because it stood forward near the\ncurtain and sometimes came out into the room. A number\nof cameras were directed upon it, and then a magnesium\nflash was used, and it was photographed. It appeared to be\na man's figure, heavily draped, with only the face visible, a,\nkind of helmet on the head, and a chin-cloth draped to hide\nchin and ears. It stood near the curtain and held the drapery\nin such a way as to hide the face of the medium by screen\ning her from the magnesium light, though her dress was\nvisible as if she were still sitting on her chair as usual. The\nface of the figure did not look so solid and substantial as\nthe face of the other person behind the screen. The weak\npoint was that the actual body of the medium was not\nvisible, but only her clothes. The outlines of her knees,\nappeared to be visible through the skirt, and the upper part\nof her body seemed to be in the dress, but the sleeve of the\noutstretched arm looked rather empty. The medium, however,,\nwas thin, and it was possible to arrange a lady's thin arm\nand sleeve so as to give the same appearance. It was diffi\ncult to imagine that the medium was not where she appeared\nto be, and the room had been searched and no drapery was.\nfound ; also there was no trap-door to introduce confederates..\nThe same figure had also been seen by the same family and\nother observers very many times for some years, with another\nmedium altogether.\nThe phantom moved out into the room, and spoke in a.\nhollow voice. If an ordinary person breathes through lime\nwater, a precipitate of chalk is formed, and Professor Eichet\nwas anxious to test the phantom's power in this direction. It\nconsented only after some persuasion. At the next sitting\nthe phantom could be heard blowing, but not effectively down\nthe tube into the lime or baryta water. After some failures,\nit succeeded in doing this, and a white precipitate was then\nproduced.\nSIR WILLIAM CROOKES, in reference to Sir Oliver Lodge's,\nremarks as to the resemblance of the luminosity of the\nmedium's skin to that of sulphide of calcium, observed that\nit would of course be very easy to apply sulphide of calcium\nto the skin or clothes, but that it quickly decomposed in\nthe presence of moisture, producing sulphuretted hydrogen,\n\fDEC., 1905.

He\nasked if Sir Oliver Lodge had ever noticed this smell in the\n\u2022course of the experiments.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE replied that he had moistened the clothes\nfor this very purpose, and had sometimes detected a faint\nsmell of sulphuretted hydrogen.\nCASE.\nL. 1149. Reciprocal.\nThe following account was received from Miss I. M. Pagan,\nof 24 Newbattle Terrace, Edinburgh.\nMay 8th, 1905.\nOn the night of Wednesday, 17th of March, 1904 (as nearly as I\n\u2022can remember the date), I was sleeping in my own room at the top\nof this house, my sister Elizabeth being in the room next mine. In\nthe middle of the night\u2014at what hour I do not know\u2014I was\nawakened by a curious sensation of pressure from above, as of a\nweight resting gently but firmly on me, and looking up saw my\nsister Elizabeth suspended in some way above me in the air. She\nwas lying with her eyes shut, covered with a quilt as if in bed, and\nlooked very pale and ill. I felt no surprise but only concern for\nher evident suffering, and a strong impulse to get up and minister\nto her. (She is subject to occasional attacks of severe pain, and I\nhave nursed her through them very frequently.) However, as soon\nas I tried to rise I found myself too heavy with sleep to do so.\nMy eyes would not open, and my shoulders seemed as if held down\nby their own weight. Yet I had felt quite wide awake and fully\nconscious of where I was, of the furniture in the room, etc. It seemed\nas if I gave up the attempt to rise, partly because she made me\nunderstand that she did not need my help, but only wanted to be\nnear me. So I put out my arm\u2014half sitting up, and without effort\n\u2014and guided her to a place beside me on the bed, falling asleep\nagain as soon as she was comfortably settled. She seemed to float\nthrough the air much as a child's india-rubber balloon would do, and\nwas quite easily moved when I touched her. After a while I woke\nagain with a start and a feeling of distress at my own laziness, and\nagain made an effort to rise, thinking remorsefully that she had been\nin pain and I ought to have got up and made a poultice, but had\ndone nothing for her. There was again a difficulty in rousing myself,\nand then came the recollection that she was beside me, so that I\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DKO., 1905.\ndidn't need to rise. I sat up (once more with ease) and asked, \"Are\nyou all right now\"? I heard her answer, \"Yes, I am all right,\nthank you,\" and went to sleep again.\"\nIn the morning I was wakened by my youngest sister Hilda, who\ncame into the room saying, \"Betty sent me to tell you that you\ncame to her in your astral body last night.\" \" No I didn't ! \" I\nexclaimed, \"she came to me. Was she in pain?\" \"Yes.\"\nI went to my sister's room and found she had been suffering during\nthe night, had thought of calling me, but decided she wasn't ill\nenough to need any treatment. After lying awake for about half-\nan-hour she fell asleep, and was awakened by my voice asking \"are\nyou all right now?\" and looking up saw me near the door of her\nroom\u2014rather a shadowy figure enveloped in bed-clothes, even the\nhead being partially covered. She answered, \" Yes, I am all right,\nthank you,\" and went to sleep again with the impression that I had\nsomehow ministered to her.\nAs a matter of fact I was lying much muffled up, as I had felt\ncold and drawn the clothes well up over my ears. I am perfectly\ncertain I did not get out of bed all night, and I have never done\nanything in the sleep-walking line. This is my only \"psychic\nexperience \" worth recording. I once previously had the same strong\nimpression of a friend having come to me in the night, but have no\ncorroborative evidence. . . . My attention was not directed to these\nsubjects at the time, and I dismissed the incident as a curiously\nvivid dream ; but though I dream a good deal, these two experiences-\nstand out from other dreams as different. I feel that whatever the\nstate of consciousness may have been, I was awake and alive to my\nphysical surroundings in a way quite unusual in ordinary dreams.\nA cousin (Mrs. Young) came to live with us on the 15th March,\nand recalls that it was after she arrived that the incident took place.\nI left home on the 22nd, so the \" vision \" came to me between these\ntwo dates, I believe on the 17th.

Case. 175\nnote my sister's very momentary impression of my presence and how\nit faded away, and also the fact that it never for an instant\noccurred to her that it could be myself. Now the room she slept\nin is very small, 18 ft. 6x10 ft., and the bed was quite near the\ndoor\u2014within 6 ft., and her hearing is exceptionally quick and her\nsight good (except that she wears glasses for reading). If I had\nreally been there she would have heard me. On one or two-\noccasions when I have felt poorly I have gone to her room to boil\nsome water on her gas fire, and she always heard me the moment\nI entered and asked, \" What is it ? \" I have never walked in my\nsleep nor have I heard of any grown-up member of our huge\nconnection doing so. Various little children among dozens of cousins\nand nieces have got out of bed occasionally and wandered into\ntheir mother's room, or crossed the floor to the nurse's bed, etc., etc.\nOne of my own sisters did so twice or thrice when she was about\nfive. ... Of course there may have been cases of older sleep\nwalking in the family ; for my mother had 100 first cousins on one\nside of the house alone, and we have relatives by the score whom\nwe scarcely know ; but on the whole we are a healthy and normal\nset, and if there had been anything striking in that line I should\nprobably have heard of it. I see in my sister's account she says\nshe felt ill on going to bed. None of us had any idea of that. It\nnever even struck me she looked poorly.\nMiss Elizabeth Pagan writes :\n24 NEWBATTLE TERRACE, EDINBURGH, June 20th, 1905.\nMy sister, Isabelle Pagan, tells me you wish to have a statement\nfrom me relating to the curious sort of dream she and I seemed to\nexperience in common some months ago. My recollection of the\nincident is that while retiring for the night I felt far from well,\nbut I did not mention the fact to any one lest one of my sisters\nshould think of sitting up with me or at least staying awake on\nthe chance of being wanted. Isabelle's room is next to mine and\nI knew I could summon her if necessary by knocking on the wall.\nAfter two or three somewhat painful hours I fell asleep ; and\ntowards morning, though .the room was still very dark, I woke, as\nif from a dream, hearing myself say, \"I am all right now, thanks,\nBelle.\" At the same time I seemed to see a shadowy form which\nI somehow knew to be Belle, though she was unrecognisably muffled\nup in white drapery. The whole vision vanished literally in the\nwinking of an eye, for, as I winked myself awake to look again at\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1905.\nthe puzzling apparition, it was gone. When my sister Hilda\nentered my room before breakfast, the first thing I said to her was,\n\u2022\" How is Belle ? Please ask her why she paid me a visit in her\nastral body last night.\" Belle's answer to this message was, \" Indeed\nI didn't ! Tell her she came in her astral body to me I\"\nThen Hilda heard details of the two dreams ; and we all felt\n\u2022convinced that Belle had, by some sort of telepathy, been conscious\nthat I was in pain and been able to make me aware of her\nsympathy.\nNeither of us has ever been known to sleep-walk and as we have\ngenerally shared a room with a sister\u2014often in fact roomed with\none another\u2014it is hardly possible we could have done so without\nits being known. The doors were not locked, but we both believe\nthem to have remained shut all night. There was no one near\n\u2022enough to have heard if we did move about.\nIsabelle and I have very frequently dreamt like dreams ; that is\nto say, we have both dreamt of the same scene or the same people\non the same night ; but this is the only case of any sort of\n\u2022communication being recollected by us both on waking. The re\nport already sent you of this incident was written by my sister\nIsabelle and signed by her as well as by Hilda and myself. . . .\nELIZABETH H. C. PAGAN, (M.A. Edin.).\nMiss Hilda Pagan wrote as follows :\n24 NEWBATTLE TERRACE, EDINBURGH, July 10th, 1905.\nOne morning in March 1904 my sister Elizabeth told me when\nI went to her room before breakfast, that she had been ill in the\nnight and had dreamt our sister Isabelle had been in the room,\nstanding near the door, and had asked, \" Are you all right now ? \" On\nthe invalid saying \" Yes,\" Isabelle had disappeared, and indeed she\nhad hardly been really recognisable according to outward appearance ;\nElizabeth had rather recognised her intuitively, and spoke to me\nof the dream as probably an \"astral experience,\" an explanation I\nreadily believed. I went to waken our sister in the next room and\nsaid, \"Betty says you visited her in your astral body last night.\"\n\" Oh no, I didn't, she visited me,\" Isabelle answered. \" I was\nwakened by her on my bed ; she was ill, and I tried to sit up and\nmake her comfortable, but I slept, and only woke once, when I\nasked, 'Are you all right now?' and she answered 'Yes.'\"\nG.

F. Barrett\nin the chair.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE, who had been announced to read a paper\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1906.\n\" On the Scientific Attitude to Marvels \" was prevented by\nindisposition from being present, and his paper was read by the\nHON. EVERARD FEILDING. The following is an abstract of it :\nThe reason why the subject studied by us has not yet\nattained to scientific recognition seems to be because its facts\nare of an intermediate character ; they are not like the facts\nof inorganic nature, which can be studied apart from the\ninterfering and confusing human element, nor are they like\nthe facts of human history ; they are a mixture of the two.\nAt no period, however, has the outlook been more hopeful\nfor its ultimate admission within the scope of an enlarged\nscience. The efforts of our Society have been directed (1)\ntowards the accumulation of trustworthy evidence, (2) towards\nimproving the attitude of the educated public to metapsychical\nphenomena. In both these enterprises it has partially succeeded,\nbut it has never tried to have a collective belief of its own\nconcerning them, nor has it sought to influence human belief\none way or the other. That is a matter not for a Society,\nnor for argument, but for facts themselves to achieve, so long\nas they are not resolutely shut out from consideration.\nAfter referring to the profound or fundamental kind of\nuniversal scepticism which occasionally manifested itself among\nphilosophers and men of letters, but seldom took any root\namong men of science, Sir Oliver Lodge went on to say that\nthe average man probably considers a sceptical attitude to\neverything puzzling or ill-understood as scientific, and perhaps\nencourages wholesale disbelief for that reason, but in fact it\nis just as possible to be negatively as positively unscientific.\nTo accept facts without evidence is manifestly injudicious, but\nto reject facts with evidence is equally, though not so blatantly\nand injuriously and dangerously, unwise. Wisdom and science\nlie in the detection and acceptance of the truth, not in the\nrejection of it, and it is possible to err from the truth both in\nexcess and in defect.\nIt is possible that that great genius and most thoughtful experi\nmenter, Michael Faraday, was not wholly wise in his attitude\nto the subject fifty years ago ; for though much of what he\nthen said seems likely to stand the test of time, a few portions\nare perceived to be unsound in the light of subsequent\nexperience.\n\fJAN., 1906. General Meeting. 181\nThe hostile influence of Faraday's great name has undoubtedly\nrendered more difficult the scientific examination of ultra-\nnormal physical phenomena generally, and has retarded the\nprosecution of our researches in that direction, so that the\nfounders of the Society wisely directed their attack in the first\ninstance to facts of a more purely psychological character ; and\nour veteran explorer, Sir William Crookes, has himself stated\nthat had he his time over again, he too would have endeavoured\nto approach the subject from that side rather than risk his\nreputation in a heroic attempt to enter it from the fortressed\nboundary of physical science. This side was so strongly\nheld, and so enveloped in wire-entanglements of prejudice, as\nto be practically impregnable ; and so it was found that although\ninvited by Faraday and others to the attack\u2014with express\nrewards held out to the successful\u2014no actual assistance was\naccorded to the storming party, and their reception by the\ngarrison was of a very repellent character, so that the most\ndefinite and convincing experiments were unable to make the\nleast impression. The effect of this rebuff has lasted to our\nown day, and practically our own success has all been attained\non the side of ultra-normal psychology. But now the time\nhas come for a renewed examination of the subject on its physical\nside ; and the evidence, which probably has never wholly ceased\nto exist, shows signs of becoming more easily and plentifully\navailable. That is my impression, but predictions are proverbially\ndangerous, and I may be wrong. I hold, however, that if it\nshould turn out that strong and controllable manifestations of\nphysico-metapsychic phenomena once more make their appear\nance, in quantity and quality sufficient for investigation, it will\nbe the duty of our Society not to turn its back upon them, but\nto make the most of the opportunity of scrutinising phenomena\nwhich, like solar eclipses or transits of Venus, are not matters\nof every-day occurrence nor things that can be controlled and\nproduced at pleasure nor observed without distinct preparation\nand effort.\nAn argument, or prejudice rather, which is too often raised\nagainst our investigations and phenomena, is that they deal\nwith trivialities ; e.g. that the objects moved are homely, that\nthe intelligence operating is rudimentary, that the messages\nconveyed are only of domestic and seldom of national or inter\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psycfiicai Research. JAN., 1906,\nnational importance. This familiar rubbish is but seldom\ntackled and answered as it deserves ; it is usually only treated\nwith silent contempt. It can be met in three ways :\n(1) By pointing out that if a fact leads to the perception\nof what is true and hitherto unknown, its apparent\ntriviality is of no consequence whatever.\n(2) That, in certain cases, trivial occurrences constitute\nsubject-matter for evidence better than more publicly\ninteresting and important events, concerning which\nchannels of information and inference are likely to be\nmore open.\n(3) That communications and anticipations of a prseternormal\ncharacter are in fact not always concerned with the\nsort of events that can be properly called trivial ;\nthough nevertheless it is perfectly true that no in\nfallibility or absolute trustworthiness can be attributed\nto any class of phenomena whatever.\nAs a matter of fact, Sir Oliver hinted that in his opinion\nour investigations would ultimately have consequences of immense\nimportance ; but he went on to say that to attend to the con\nsequences which may ultimately flow from our investigations\u2014\nthough certainly a subject of great interest\u2014is not our function\nas a scientific Society. Our attitude to phenomena concerns\nonly their investigation, classification, and elucidation ; our\nbusiness is the ascertainment and recording of truth, let the\nconsequences be what they may.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT said he quite agreed with the author\nof the paper that at no time has there seemed to be a more\nhopeful outlook than at present for the wider recognition by\nthe general body of scientific men of those phenomena which\nour Society was founded to investigate. Whilst the growth\nof knowledge is, like that of a tree, ever ramifying in\nall directions, the insignificant bud of to-day becoming a\nmassive branch hereafter, scientific opinion has its alternating\nfashions, and the particular fashion of the day largely\ndetermines the direction of scientific thought and enquiry.\nIt is only necessary to open the early volumes of the\nTransactions of the Royal Society to become aware how\nforeign to the present tendency of thought was that of\nenlightened and learned men 250 years ago. Take, for\n\fJAN., 1906. General Meeting. 183\nexample, some of the queries put by the Hon. Eobert Boyle,\none of the founders of the Eoyal Society and of modern\nexperimental science. He gravely asks if those who have\nvisited the lead mines of the Mendips can inform him\nwhether they have met with any demons in the mines, and,\nif so, what were they like ? Some months later the reply\ncomes from the well-known Glanvil (author of Saducismus\nTriumpJiatus) saying he had often visited the mines, but had\nnever come across any demons other than men ; and so this\nonce widely held belief was gradually dispelled.\nBut what we note and admire in Boyle and his co-workers\nis the spirit of fearless enquiry and the frank acceptance of\nadequate evidence, even if it overthrew their prepossessions.\nWe need more of this spirit to-day. The many applications\nof scientific discovery to objects of practical utility which\nwe have witnessed during the last half century created a\npsychological climate in the latter half of the 19th century\nvery unfavourable to the reception of any phenomena which\nhad no utilitarian nor commercial aspect. Happily the\nmaterialistic view of all things thus engendered is passing\naway, and scientific men are beginning to recognize with Sir\nJohn Herschel that \" the natural philosopher should hope all\nthings not impossible, believe all things not improbable.\"\nSir Oliver Lodge had referred to Faraday's lecture on\n\" Mental Education \" delivered at the Eoyal Institution fifty\nyears ago. The speaker happened to be well acquainted\nwith that lecture, for he was indebted to Mr. Faraday for\na copy of the little volume in which it appears. The main\npurpose of that lecture was to show the value of science in\ncultivating the judgment, and how errors of judgment could\nbe avoided by forming clear and precise ideas. It was in\nconnection with this that Faraday makes the assertion that\n\" before we consider any question involving psychological\ntruths we should set out with clear ideas of the naturally\npossible and impossible,\" and he gives as an example of\nwhat is clearly impossible the movement of a table without\nany known expenditure of power. But we should need to\nbe omniscient to know what is possible or impossible. For\naught we know the table may be moved by unknown sources\nof power, just as radio-activity is a source of power\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1906.\nunknown a few years ago. What Faraday probably meant\nwas clear ideas whether any particular phenomenon does or\ndoes not contradict well-established knowledge, and even so\nthe contradiction may turn out only to be in our hasty\ninference. It is amusing to note that Faraday quotes as\nan illustration of \" subjects which unite more or less the\ncertainties of science with imaginary and unprofitable specu\nlations the following in different degrees : the heat engine,\nelectric light, the sympathetic compass, mesmerism, homoeopathy,\nodylism, the magneto-electric engine, and perpetual motion.\"\nA curious collocation, when we now have heat engines, the\nelectric light and dynamos,\u2014very profitable speculations to some,\nthanks to the genius of Faraday for the last two.\nProfessor Barrett proceeded to give, as an example of what\neven distinguished scientific men once thought to be \" naturally\nimpossible,\" the case of the telephone and of the phonograph.\nHe said that he happened to be staying with the late\nProfessor Tate at Edinburgh when the discovery of the\ntelephone appeared in the newspapers. Professor Tate ridiculed\nit, and said to him that the effect noticed must be due to\nthe conduction of sound through the wire, as it was clearly\nimpossible for any electric transmission to occur. Likewise,\nwhen the phonograph was described by the Abb6 Moigno at\nthe Paris Academy, the Abb\u00a3 himself told him that a learned\nAcademician proved to the satisfaction of the Aqademy that\nsuch an invention was quite impossible, as no rigid iron disc\ncould be made to record and reproduce the infinitely subtle\nvibrations created by the human voice and its varied inflec\ntions. Even when he exhibited the phonograph, the opinion\nthat he had been imposed upon and that a ventriloquist was\nhidden beneath the table was only dispelled with difficulty.\nCASE.\nP. 277. Auditory.\nTHE following account was received through the Eev. A. T.\nFryer, who is personally acquainted with the witnesses. Their\nnames have been given to us in confidence. Mrs. X. writes :\nNovember IQth, 1905.\nI have been requested to write down a vision which I had on the\n\fJAN., 1906. Case. 185\nnight of February 19th, 1893, just before I had a serious illness.\nMy husband . . . had been reading his sermon to me by my bed\nside ; it was his custom to read his sermons to me before he preached\nthem (1) and the subject of this one was that of Abraham offering\nup Isaac (2).\nIn the night, some time, I heard a voice calling me, saying,\n\"M G \" (3). I could not see any one, but I knew it was\nGod. I answered\u2014\" Yes, God.\" Then God came and said, \" Are\nyon ready to die 1\" I answered, \" No ; I am not.\" \" But you\nmust die,\" said God. \"Really, God, I cannot die; it is impossible,\"\nI said. Then God said, \" But you must die and be willing to give\nup all.\" Then I answered again, \"It is quite impossible; what\nwould my husband and my little baby do if I died 1 They could\nnot get on without me ; there would be no one to take care of and\nlook after them \" (my babe was then 5 or 6 days old) (4). God\nanswered, \" Yes, you must leave them ; I can take care of them\nwithout you ; My care is sufficient for them ; you must say, ' Thy\nwill be done,' and die.\"\nThen followed a long silence and a long fight with myself to\nconquer myself and reconcile myself to give up all and die.\nDuring this struggle many scenes of my life passed before me\nin which I saw how slack I had been in my life many times, and\nin my duties, and then I felt that in spite of these failures God had\nstill taken care of me and my relatives without my help. All this\ntime God was waiting near for an answer, and I had a feeling of\nsurrender. I felt it must be and I said, \" Yes, God, I will say\n'Thy will be done,' and die.\" I said, \"Thy will be done,\" and\nlay still. God said, \"That is right; as you have said that, you shall\nnot die, but you must be very ill; but you shall not die,\" and so\nit was.\nIn the morning I told my husband the vision (5), and I shall\nnever forget it. After that I was very ill indeed ; all thought I\nwas dying. But no thought of death troubled me, because I had\nheard God say, \"You shall not die\" (6). It happened 13 years\nago, but it is still fresh in my memory.\n(Signed)\nIn my presence, A. T. FRYER.\nNotes by Mr. Fryer.\n(1) On this occasion the husband says that the sermon was read to\nM.

G .\n* * *\nRead and signed in my presence, A. T. FRYER.\nMr. Fryer adds :\nNovember 20th, 1905.\nI have known the writer of this case and her husband for several\nyears and have stayed with them both at their present residence,\nthe rectory of L. L., and their former, where the incident occurred.\nI have no doubt as to the truth of the story, but although there\nhave been many occasions when it might have been related to me\nprevious to November, 1905, I had heard nothing of it, and probably\nshould not have been told it at this time had I not expressed my\ngreat anxiety to obtain more cases for the S.P.R.\nThree children have been born to this family since 1893, but\nno similar experience to the above has occurred. I have the original\naccount and attestations in my possession, but the names are with\nheld from this printed account at the desire of the narrator. The\noriginals will be eventually lodged at the office.\nI have verified the date of the sermon by reference to the preacher's\nbook at the rectory where Mrs. X. was living at the time of the\nvision (the change to the present living took place in 1901). It was\npreached on February 19th, 1893, at 11 a.m. There were two more\nsermons on the same day, preached from different texts. The present\nrector of X.'s former parish has referred to the Baptismal Register,\n\fJA.\\., 1906. Case. 187\nand finds that the baptism took place on April 16th, 1893. The\ndate of birth is also entered as February 13th, 1893.\nBy an analysis of the elements in this and similar cases I have\ncome to the conclusion that the sub-conscious mind is aware of such\na thing as an injury, or the settlement of a poison-germ within the\nbody, long before the initial events are seen or known to the\nworking consciousness, or by others in the results. What probably\nhappened in this case was (1) the lodgment of the poisonous\ngerms; (2) the knowledge of their entrance by the sub-conscious self;\n(3) reasoning upon the probable result, in this case severe illness,\nbut not death ; and (4) the impressing upon the active conscious\nness of the necessity for calm and quietude, if the poison was to\nbe overcome.\nThe subject in this case was a religious person, not morbidly\nreligious, and her sub-conscious self would know by training that\n\"surrender,\" or the dismissal of anxiety, was a necessary factor in\nthe fight for life. If the physical organism was to do its work\nproperly, the mind must be at rest,\u2014stand by, so to speak, as a\nspectator and watch the fight with no doubt as to the issue. The\nform the colloquy took was just what we might expect from a\nperson carefully trained in religion. If my reasoning is correct, the\nsub-conscious self is the real seat of human intelligence, and its\nintimations are, as it were, directions to subordinates, to wit, the\nworking consciousness and the physical constituents of our personality.\nHad M. G. in her waking consciousness not accepted the dictates\nof her intelligent and trained sub-conscious self, the probability is\nthat she would have died. But her acquiescence in the necessity for\nabsolute calm gave the physical organism its chance of working\nwithout irritating interference, and she survived.\nALFRED T. FRYER.\nIt will be observed that the explanation here suggested by\nMr. Fryer of a hypertesthetic or possibly supernormal know\nledge on the part of the subliminal self of the actual present\ncondition of the organism, and the efficacy of self-suggestion\nin bringing about the fulfilment of a prediction which may\nhave been an inference from that knowledge, is the theory\nmaintained by Mrs. Sidgwick in her treatment of similar\ncases in her paper on \" The Evidence for Premonitions \" in\nProceedings, Vol. V. (see especially pp. 291-3), and by Mr.\nMyers in his paper on \" Precognition \" in Proceedings, Vol. XI.\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1906.\n(see especially pp. 426-32). See also a case recorded in the\nJournal for November, 1901 (Vol. X., p. 136), where a young\nman sees the apparition of an unrecognised form, which gives\nhim the impression that \" something terrible is going to\nhappen,\" a few hours before the oncoming of an attack of\nappendicitis which ends fatally.\nOLFACTOEY HALLUCINATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH\nSUBCONSCIOUS VISUAL PEECEPTIONS.\nTHE account of this case was sent to us by an Associate of\nthe Society, Miss F. I. Childers, having been given to her\nsister by the percipient, Miss Goddard, who wrote :\nSeptember 11th, 1905.\nThe following is the account of the two curious experiences I\nmentioned to you as having happened to me.\nThe first, which occurred some years ago, was at a visit I paid\nwith several friends to a picture gallery in Bond Street. Among\nthe paintings, which, I think, were all by French artists, was one\nrepresenting a pyramid of human heads in various and advanced\nstages of decomposition. I walked towards it, looking at something\nwhich had taken my attention in my catalogue, when I became\nconscious of a most horrible and overpowering stench, such as\nwould probably have been caused by remains of the kind in reality.\nI did not know anything about the picture, its subject, or its\nposition in the gallery, and it was not until I was close to it that\nI perceived what it was at all. Sight had, therefore, nothing to\ndo with suggesting the odour to the sense of smell. I mentioned\nthe fact to the friends who were with me, but they only laughed\nand said there was nothing of the kind, that it was merely\nimagination worked upon by the horrid subject of the painting.\nThis experience was brought back to me rather vividly by another\nand similar one, which occurred at the Academy, either of last year\nor the year before, I forget for the moment which. I became\nsuddenly aware of a delightful scent of wallflowers, stocks, etc., etc.,\nsuch as one would expect in a lovely old-fashioned garden.\nPeople do not generally use a scent of that kind (wallflower), and\nI was wondering where it came from, when, on looking up, I saw\na painting representing just such an old garden, and which I think\nI should have passed without seeing if the scent had not made\nme look round. This was not all. Before leaving the Academy,\n\fJAN., 1906. Olfactory Hallucinations. 189\nI usually go once through the galleries just as they are closing\nfor one look round when the crowd has gone. I did so on this\noccasion, and, on passing the picture, the same thing happened\nagain. I did not know I was near it until the scent of flowers\nmade me look up. Without this, I should certainly have missed\nseeing it the second time, as I had quite forgotten in which gallery\nit was hanging. . . .\nMiss Goddard came to call on Miss Johnson at the S.P.R.\nBooms on October 13th, and described her experiences fully\nto her. She said that on the first occasion it seemed\nimpossible that it should have been a real smell, as her com\npanions who were close by, walking a little in front of her,\nand who turned back when she exclaimed, denied absolutely\nthat they could smell anything. On the second occasion, at\nthe Academy, she was alone, and the room was almost empty\nthe second time she came to the picture, which made it\npractically certain that the smell was not due to any scent\nworn by a person in the room.\nThere can be little doubt that the hallucinations were due\nto Miss Goddard's having already seen the pictures sublimin-\nally, since in talking to Miss Johnson she said she was quite\ncertain that she had not in either case seen them consciously\nbefore becoming aware of the smell. The case has some\nanalogy with the \" synsesthesiae \" of certain persons, in whom\nevery sensation of certain types is accompanied by a sensation\nof another type, as, for instance, a special sound may be accom\npanied by a special sensation of colour or light. For instances,\nsee Human Personality, Vol. I., pp. 565-567, and the \"number-\nforms,\"\u2014a kind of diagrammatic mental pictures which accom\npany the conception of a progression of numbers\u2014described\nin Mr. Galton's Inquiries into Human Faculty. In Human\nPersonality, Vol. II., pp. 110-111, two cases are given in\nwhich visual hallucinations seem to have been produced by\nsubconscious tactile sensations, though this is only a conjectural\nexplanation. The special interest of Miss Goddard's case lies\nin the connection of the two sensations, visual and olfactory,\nhaving been so clearly made out. Cases of subliminal sensa\ntions or perceptions giving rise to involuntary and unconscious\nmovements are common and well known\u2014e.g. in experiences\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1906.\nwith the divining rod, or in table tilting, or automatic writing,\nand the continuity between these and cases of the sensory\ntype is clearly expounded in the chapter on \" Motor Auto\nmatism \" in Human Personality.\nHallucination of the sense of smell, it may be observed,\nseems to be much rarer than that of the other senses. Some\ndiscussion of olfactory hallucinations, with accounts of two\ncases (one when the hallucination was evoked by a vivid\nrecollection of the circumstances in which the actual smell\nhad been experienced, and the other a mere \" memory-image \"\nof smells recalled by association of ideas), is to be found on\npp. 379-381 of an article by Dr. Th. Bibot, entitled\n\" Recherches sur la M^moire Affective,\" in the Revue Philo-\nsophique, Vol. XXXVIII. (1894).\nNEWSPAPER FABRICATIONS.\nGHOST stories have now become so frequent a topic in the\ndaily press that it may be worth while to warn our readers\noccasionally against trusting too implicitly even in circum\nstantial accounts apparently guaranteed by the names and\naddresses of witnesses.\n(1) For instance, the Daily Graphic, which had been\npublishing a series of \" Coincidences \" in the early autumn,\ngave a case on October 7th, 1905, signed \" G. J. Mickelburg,\n30 Sheen Grove, Barnsbury, N.,\" stating that while he was\nhearing High Mass at a certain church two days earlier, he\nheard the voice of his daughter cry out, \" Pray for me, father,\nI am drowning.\" He was so much impressed that he went\nearly the same afternoon to Bedford, walked thence 2J miles\nto the farm where his daughter was staying, and found her\nin bed. She had gone out in a boat on the river in the\nmorning and been nearly drowned, but was rescued just in\ntime. She stated that just before losing consciousness she had\nhad a -vision of her father in church sitting between the two\nfriends who were actually with him at the time. The account,\nwhich is briefly summarised here, appeared to be written with\ngreat care, accuracy, and sobriety, and we wrote to Mr.\nMickelburg asking for his confirmation of it. He replied by\nreturn of post, \" I know nothing whatever about the letter\n\fJAN., 1906. Newspaper Fabrications. 191\nwhich appears in the Daily Graphic of to-day under my\nname.\" Further correspondence made it still clearer that the\naccount was an invention from beginning to end ; and also\nelicited the fact that Mr. Mickelburg was an ardent Pro\ntestant, and that the story had probably been invented as a\npractical joke by some one who was aware of his special\nsentiments in this respect. It should be added that a brief\ncontradiction of it was published by the Daily Graphic on\nOctober 24th.\n(2) Towards the end of October, 1905, reports appeared in\nthe Daily Mail arid other papers as to a woman named Mary\nAnn Hardy, who it was stated had been in a trance for three\nweeks, was admitted in that condition into the Braintree\nUnion Infirmary, and only woke from the trance the day after\nentering. The Eev. J. W. Hayes, an Associate of the Society,\nwrote to the chaplain of the infirmary, and received from him\nthe following reply :\nBRAINTREE, November 9th, 1905.\nIt gives me great pleasure to reply to your letter re the case of\nMary Ann Hardy. The report is an absolute hoax. I have known\nHardy for about two years. When she first came into the Braintree\nUnion Infirmary, i.e. about two years ago, as a patient, she was\nmuch depressed\u2014suffering, I should say, from melancholia.\nAfter a while she gained strength both of body and mind, and\nbecame a cheerful and useful inmate. About three or four months\nago she left the workhouse, and went to reside with her sister in\nthis town. After a while a situation was found for her at Great\nBaling. But she seems to have worried herself, fearing lest she\nshould not give satisfaction to her employer, and again signs of\nmental weakness showed themselves. Her mistress, having her busi\nness to attend to, could not take charge of Hardy, so it was\narranged that she should come into the workhouse. On the very\nday on which she was reported as having been brought to the\nworkhouse \"in a trance,\" she sat up in an open cart and walked\ninto the ward. I saw her a few hours after, went up to her bed,\nand spoke to her. She recognised me at once, and answered my\nenquiries in a feeble voice. She is now gradually recovering\nstrength.\nI don't know who is responsible for the report which reached\nthe papers. I can only add that so long as she lias been in the\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1906.\nBraintree Infirmary, she has not been under anything approaching\nto a trance.\nHENRY J. SHILDRICK, Chaplain.\nThe newspaper reports having been stated to have been made\non the authority of the workhouse master, Mr. Barlow, Mr.\nHayes wrote also to him, and obtained a reply, giving substanti\nally the same account of the case as that given by the chaplain.\n(3) The South Wales Echo, Cardiff, September 2nd, 1905,\ngives an account by Mrs. Heron Maxwell, quoted from the\nDaily Graphic, of a \"haunted house\" \"looking down from Ancre\nHill to the river and the town of Monmouth,\" in which she\nstayed for three weeks, experiencing every night an unaccount\nable feeling of intense terror, which she associated with a\ncertain cupboard-door in her bedroom. Several months later\nit was discovered that this cupboard had a sliding panel,\nopening on to a spiral staircase which led to a secret passage\nout into the garden. It was stated that many years ago a\n\" clandestine visitor \" had been murdered in the house, carried\ndown the spiral staircase and buried in the garden.\nOn enquiring into this story, Mr. A. T. Fryer heard from a\nfriend of his that the house was in the possession of Mr.\nVizard, a Monmouth solicitor, who had written to the Mon\nmouthshire Beacon to deny the report given in the Daily\nGraphic. Mr. Vizard himself wrote in reply to Mr. Fryer's\nenquiries as follows :\nTHE AXCRE HILL, MONMOUTH, November 5th, 1905.\nThe house to which you refer is described by Mrs. Heron\nMaxwell, I believe, as \"looking down from the Ancre Hill to\nthe River Monnow,\" and the only one answering to the description\nshe gives is the one I am now living in, and where I have resided\nfor twenty years.\nI wrote to Mrs. Heron Maxwell to enquire whether this is the\nhouse she referred to, and who were the people living here at the\ntime she made her visit, but she had not the courtesy to take any\nnotice of my letter. ... I may say that there is a bedroom in this\nhouse with a cupboard door in it, but that this is the first time\nfor twenty years that we have heard of any \"ghost\" connected\nwith it, nor have we ever heard of any secret staircase leading\ninto the garden from it.

Eeciprocal.\nTHE report of the following case was obtained for us by\n.a Member of the Society, Mr. A. W. Orr, of 15 Moorland\nRoad, Didsbury, Manchester, who has collected all the evidence\navailable. It will be observed that the case was reported to\nus within a few weeks of its occurrence. Mr. Orr writes :\nJuly 2Gfh, 1905.\nI enclose an account of a hallucination experienced by Mrs. Ellen\n<jrreen of Manchester during a recent visit to Cardiff, and of\nanother in connection therewith experienced by a Captain Ward,\na retired master mariner, which I have got the various persons\n\u2022concerned to sign as being correct.\nMrs. Green is a trance-speaker on spiritualistic platforms and is a\nuatural clairvoyante, but not by any means a credulous person. . . .\nThe account enclosed was as follows :\nI had been staying at the house of Mr. Ward, a retired Master in\nthe Mercantile Marine, who resides at Northwood House, Llanishen,\nnear Cardiff, and on Tuesday, June 20th [1905], he drove me over\nto Whitchurch (about two miles from Llanishen) where I was to\nspend a couple of days with friends, Mr. and Mrs. Berwick. He\nleft me there at about eleven o'clock in the forenoon and returned\nto his home. On the following afternoon at about half-past three\nI was sitting alone in the drawing-room, Mrs. Berwick being in her\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.\nown room, and, on happening to look up, I saw Mr. Ward standing\nat the bay window and looking in at me as though he desired to-\nspeak to me. He was in his usual dress and is not a man to be\neasily mistaken for any one else. Thinking he had brought some\nletters for me, I rose hastily and went towards the window calling\nto him and waving my hand to him, partly in greeting and partly\nas a sign for him to go to the hall door, but when I reached the\nwindow I was surprised not to see him. I concluded, however,\nthat he must have gone to the door without my noticing and so I\nhurried to the door to let him in. I was exceedingly surprised and\nalarmed when I opened the hall-door to see nobody there, nor any\nwhere about the house. Later when Mrs. Berwick came down I\ntold her\u2014and also Mr. Berwick\u2014of my experience, and like myself\nthey felt extremely anxious lest some harm had happened to Mr-\nWard, for whom we all felt a strong regard.\nNext morning, however, soon after eleven o'clock Mr. Ward\narrived in his trap according to arrangement to take me to the\nrailway station to join the train for Manchester. He was in a.\nvery weak state and suffering from severe injuries to his ankle,\nneck, and shoulders, and he remarked to us, \" It is a wonder I have\nbeen able to come to you in the body.\" It seemed that whilst\ndriving home on Tuesday the horse, which was a very nervous-\nanimal, upset the trap and caused him to be thrown out and badly\nbruised and shaken. The next afternoon, whilst lying on a couch\nin his sitting-room, he was wondering what Mrs. Green would think\nif she knew of the occurrence, when he suddenly heard her voice\noutside the house. There being only an elderly woman in the\nhouse he managed with great difficulty to get to the hall-door to-\nadmit Mrs. Green, and was greatly amazed not to see her. The\ntime was between three o'clock and four, just about the time when,\nMrs. Green saw his form at Whitchurch.\nWe certify that this account of the hallucinations seen and heard\nby Mrs. Green and Captain Ward is correct.\nELLEN GREEN.\nFREDERICK WARD.\nJOHN BERWICK.\nFANNY A. BERWICK.\nIn reply to enquiries about this case, Mr. Orr wrote :\nJuly 28th, 1905.\nIn reply to your questions re Mrs. Green's experience in South\nWales, I may say that when she told me the circumstances I asked\n\fFEB., 1906. Cases 195\nher to repeat the account, and I took a shorthand note of it which\nI transcribed and sent to her to get the signatures of the other\npeople affixed to it, so that I could send it then to you. For some\nreason Mr. Green re-wrote the narrative (copied, I believe, from my\nnote) and his copy was sent [to] and signed by Mr. and Mrs.\nBerwick and Captain Ward ; Mrs. Green handed it to me and I\nposted it to you.\nI have written to the other persons asking them to let me have\ntheir individual statements, ... I know nothing of them personally.\nMrs. Green is a trance speaker and is engaged for Sunday\nservices all over the country ... I have known her for some\nyears an'd have the fullest confidence in her integrity . . . She has\nhad many very remarkable experiences during her life, but, as is\nso frequently the case, no note was made of them at the time,\nand so they are lost for all practical purposes. . . .\nMr. Orr obtained later the following statements from the\nother witnesses in the case.\n(1.)\nFrom Mr. J. Berwick.\n10 WINDSOR TERRACE, PENARTH,\n4th August, 1905.\n... I am quite willing to do what is reasonably possible to\nconfirm the statement made by Mrs. Green, but you have evidently\noverlooked the fact that the original document is an attested one\nand was signed while the incident was fresh in our memories; but\nto sit down now and write an accurate account of what was said\nand done last June is an impossible task for a very busy man. I\nreally do not remember the details sufficiently clearly to make a\nstatement which [could] be used for comparison with one made two\nmonths ago, but you are quite at liberty to use our names in so\nfar as they relate to the statement already in your possession. I\nam sorry I cannot do more.\nJOHN BERWICK.\n(2.)\nFrom Captain Ward.\nNORTHWOOD, BlRCHGROVE, CARDIFF,\n2nd August, 1905.\nI have pleasure in reply to your letter to give you here the\nfacts of the incident as it actually happened. On the 20th June last\nI drove Mrs. Green in my pony trap to Mr. Berwick's house in\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.\nWhitchurch, Cardiff, and on returning home to above address, met\nwith an accident, being thrown out of my trap backwards, hurting\nmy neck and ankle. On the following day the 21st inst. I was un\nable to leave the house, and lay on the sofa in my dining room,\nwhen between the hours of 3 and 4 p.m. I distinctly heard Mrs.\nGreen's voice outside the front door calling me. I managed to rise\nfrom the couch and look out through the window to call her in, but\nfound no person there ; the time would exactly agree with that\nwhen Mrs. Green saw my form at Whitchurch.\nThis I found out on speaking to Mrs. Green on Thursday the 22nd\ninst. I had not seen her between the 20th and 22nd. The above\nare the facts of the case.\nFREDERICK WARD.\nL. 1151. Collective Auditory.\nInformation of the next case was kindly sent to us by\nMr. E. E. Pease, who wrote to Mr. Podmore of it as follows :\nNovember 1st, 1905.\n... A working woman was dying of cancer and was visited\ndaily by Mrs. Eix of Headland Cottage, Limpsfield. She died at\n5.20 a.m. on Tuesday [really Monday] last, Oct. 30th. At the\nsame hour both Mr. and Mrs. Eix heard a knocking at their door\nwhich awakened them. Mrs. Rix went down to see what was\nthere and found nothing. It is stated that the servant also\nheard the knocking, but this may be inaccurate. It is stated that\nthe night was windy, but even on the windiest of nights, one does\nnot get up at 5.20 to go to the front door. At any rate I never\ndid. ...\nWe wrote to Mr. Eix (formerly Secretary to the Eoyal\nSociety) asking for a first-hand account of the incident from\nhim and his wife, and he replied as follows :\nHEADLAND COTTAGE, LIMPSFIELD,\nSURREY, November IQth, 1905.\nI was lying awake in bed on the morning of October 30th when\nI heard a distinct knocking which I took to be at the outside door\nof the cottage. We knew that the woman in whom we were\ninterested (a Mrs. C., who lives about \u00a3 mile from us) was in\na dying state, and I immediately assumed that one of her children\nhad come to fetch my wife. I therefore touched my wife to rouse\n\fFEB., 1906. Cases. 197\nher, and told her that I thought the C.'s had come to fetch her.\nI do not remember whether anything was said to show that my\nwife was awake or asleep at the time. She went down immediately,\nbut came back and said that nobody was there. The knocks were\nnot less than 5 and not more than 7 : I think there were five in\nrapid succession, as of some one knocking sharply at the door. Our\nbedroom is on the first floor, and the knocking sounded to be\ndownstairs,\u2014was certainly not in our room. It did not occur to\nus to attach any particular significance to the sound at the time.\nThe above is all that I can state at first-hand, but the following\nat second-hand may be interesting. The servant, who sleeps in the\nadjoining room, and who says that she also heard the knocking,\nlooked at her clock and found it to be 20 past 5 (her clock was\nknown to be a few minutes fast). At breakfast-time some neighbours\ncame down to tell us that Mrs. C. had died at \\ past 5 that\nmorning. After breakfast my wife went to see the C.'s and they\ntold her that Mrs. C. had died at \\ past 5.\nHERBERT Eix, B.A.\nMrs. Eix added :\nI, the wife of Herbert Rix, also heard the knocking,\u20145 or 6\nsharp raps, I should think. My impression is that it waked me,\nbut as my husband thinks I did not rouse till he touched me, it\nis possible that I heard the knocking in my sleep, just before the\nmoment of waking.\nI did not look at my watch at the time, but comparing it\nbefore breakfast with our servant's clock, found that it (the watch)\nwas 8 minutes slower, and more accurate.\nALICE Rix.\nSITTINGS WITH ME. CHAMBEES.\nEEPORTS appeared in Light in the early part of 1905 of a\n\" materialising \" medium, Mr. Christopher Chambers, who had\nbeen giving sittings in Huddersfield and other northern towns.\nLater in the year his performances became notorious through\npress reports in several of the Newcastle papers ; among these\nreports was one of an exposure which took place on October 14th,\n1905, as reported in the Newcastle Daily Chronicle of October\n17th. According to a statement which we obtained from\nMr. Arthur T. Neale of Newcastle, who played the principal\npart in this exposure, Mr. Neale, whose suspicions had been\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.\naroused at a previous stance, went to the sitting with two\nelectric lamps, which could be turned up at any moment, and\nwhen one of the forms came out he turned the light suddenly\non to it, and revealed Mr. Chambers dressed \"in a sheet, wearing\na false moustache and a paper turban in the character of an\nOriental. He drew back the curtain of the cabinet, and found\non the chair the trousers, socks, and boots of the medium.\nMr. Easthope, who had arranged for the sitting, returned the\nmoney to the sitters, and wrote to the Newcastle Daily Chronicle\nthat Mr. Chambers had been \" caught red-handed at my meeting\non Saturday, October 14, by one of the sitters, the medium being\nfound dressed up as a spirit form, much to the horror and disgust\nof the sitters present.\"\nAfter this, some of the spiritualists at Newcastle arranged for\na series of test sittings with Mr. Chambers, in the hope that\nsome evidence might be given of genuine phenomena. Their\nreport, however, was that the proceedings were quite incon\nclusive, since, the medium having been adequately fastened inside\nthe cabinet, no forms emerged from it. Mr. W. H. Robinson,\nwho had arranged for these sittings, confirmed in a letter to us\nthe report of their unsatisfactory nature, adding \" I found him\n[Mr. Chambers] worthless as a medium and duly informed the\nspiritual press, but no notice was taken.\"\nAt this period a photograph was circulated, representing\nMr. Chambers with an alleged \" spirit form \" in the background,\nthis form representing his supposed control, \" Lottie.\" Not only\ndoes an examination of the photograph show obviously suspicious\nfeatures, but the photographer, Mr. James Wallace of Newcastle,\nafterwards sent a letter to the Newcastle Daily Chronicle of\nNovember 30th, 1905, through his solicitors, confessing that he\nhad prepared the plate by getting a young lady to pose as a\nghost, and had subsequently taken the photograph of Mr.\nChambers on the same plate. This has since been confirmed to\nus in a letter from Mrs. Wallace, who states that the whole thing\nhad been intended by her husband merely as a joke at Mr.\nChambers' expense.\nMr. Chambers, professing himself anxious after this to re\nestablish his reputation, arranged through a gentleman in the\nnorth of England, who was known to us and had previously\ngiven us a favourable report of him, to give a few sittings to\n\fFEB., 1906. Sittings with Mr. Chambers. 199\nthe Society for Psychical Research, on condition that nothing\nshould be paid to him, either for the sittings or for his expenses,\nunless, in the judgment of the officials of the Society, conclusive\n\u2022evidence was afforded of supernormal agency : also that should\nmaterialised forms appear, he would consent to his own per-\n.son being reasonably examined by the sitters, in order to\nverify that he and the apparition were separate existences ;\nprovided that neither the apparition nor the medium should\nbe suddenly clutched while the phenomena were going on.\nOn this agreement, which he signed before coming, Mr.\n-Chambers travelled to London, and four sittings were held in\nthe Eooms of the Society for Psychical Eesearch on December\n12th, 13th, 15th, and 16th, being arranged for by Mr.\nFeilding, Mr. Baggally, Colonel Taylor and Miss Johnson,\n\u2022who were generally present ; the other sitters being invited\n\u2022by them, and being mostly members of the Society, except\nthat Mr. Chambers brought a friend with him, though un-\n.authorised to do so, on three occasions.\nAt the first sitting the medium went into a cabinet, and\npurported to become entranced, when he spoke in a voice\nslightly different from his ordinary one, but not suggesting\nAny more alteration than could easily have been produced at\nwill. Two or three forms appeared, one a man with a short\nblack beard (Mr. Chambers himself wearing only a moustache),\nwho stepped out of the Cabinet and bowed several times,\n.holding out his left arm at full length. Mr. Baggally, who\nsat next to the cabinet, could see that only the front\npart of the form was draped, while on its back was visible\nthe back of the medium's waistcoat, he having apparently\ntaken off his coat. Later, a short form, supposed to be that\n\u2022of a child, was seen in the opening just within the curtains ;\nthis appeared merely as a vague white shape with no dis\ntinct arms or head. The light in the room was provided by\na single electric lamp closely shrouded in red paper, so as to\ngive extremely little light. There was no feature in the\nphenomena to suggest anything but deliberate personation of\n\" spirit forms \" by the medium.\nThe second sitting on December 13th was practically a\nrepetition of the first, the \" forms \" being, if anything, rather\nless distinct, owing to the medium insisting on still less light.\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.\nContrary to the stipulation in the agreement, no opportunity\nwas afforded for examining the medium during the appearance\nof the \" spirit forms.\"\nAt the third sitting, on December 15th, Mr. Chambers\nwas accompanied by Mr. John Lobb, a gentleman who is well\nknown for his interest in spiritualistic phenomena. On this\noccasion, at the medium's own suggestion, he was tied in a\nwicker arm-chair with some objects disposed on the floor near\nhim, and he stated that these or perhaps himself in his chair\nmight possibly be levitated over the heads of the sitters.\nThe tying was performed by Mr. Baggally and another gentle\nman, both expert in such matters, and at Mr. Chambers's request\nthe room was made completely dark. Nothing at all happened\nexcept that during the sitting Mr. Chambers, on whose back\na small luminous patch had (without his knowledge) been\naffixed, so that his whereabouts could be ascertained, was-\nobserved gradually to work himself along into close proximity\nto the objects disposed upon the floor. Possibly because when\nhe got there he found that on account of the security with\nwhich he was tied he could do nothing with them, he\nworked himself partly back again.\nThe fourth sitting, on December 16th, was again one for\n\" materialisations.\" The electric lamp, shaded with red paper,\nwas again used, and gave a slightly better light than before.\nThe sitters were arranged in the usual horse-shoe in front of\nthe cabinet, Mr. Feilding and Mr. Baggally being seated\nrespectively at the ends of the horse-shoe nearest the cabinet^\nAfter some conversation and a speech by the supposed control,\n\" Lottie,\" the medium went into the cabinet, and some time\nlater some vague white forms were seen, one appearing like a\nwhite figure materialising from below, the drapery rising\ngradually from the floor between the division in the curtains,,\ntill the form appeared fully draped. It having been over and\nover again pointed out to the medium that, while the com\nmittee had no intention of violating their agreement not to\nseize the \"spirit form,\" the mere appearance of such a form\ncould not be regarded as evidential unless opportunity was\nafforded of ascertaining that while the form was outside the\ncabinet the medium himself was inside, Mr. Chambers, after\nthe return of the form into the cabinet, withdrew part of\n\fFEB., 1906. Sittings with Mr. Chambers. 201\nthe curtain and revealed himself sitting in the chair and\nmoving about to prove that it was really himself, and\na white form to his right. He probably miscalculated the\nquantity of light, for it was perfectly clear to those seated\nnear the cabinet that the form was merely a piece of white\ndrapery held in his right hand and waved about in a very\nfar from realistic manner. Later, an attempt was made to\nsimulate the gradual materialisation upwards of a spirit form\nby slowly raising a piece of white muslin gauze between\nthe division of the curtains, which had now been drawn\ntogether, the action being again perfectly obvious to those\nseated near the cabinet.\nAfterwards a completely draped form, the mouth of which\nwas also covered with drapery (Mr. Chambers wearing a\nmoustache), came out of the cabinet into the room. On being\nasked by the sitters to shake hands, it offered its left hand\nto each of them, and would not allow the right hand to be\nseen or touched, Mr. Chambers having lost three of the\nfingers of his right hand. On being asked whether it was\nthe deceased wife of one of the sitters, the form bowed\nassent. As it advanced into the room Mr. Baggally and Mr.\nFeilding saw the black trousers of the medium behind it,\nthe drapery only covering the front part. After this form\nhad retired a man with a black beard was seen, but no\nfurther opportunity for reasonable examination was permitted.\nAt the end of the sitting Mr. Feilding and Mr. Baggally\ninformed the medium of what they had seen, and that they\nhad no doubt that drapery and a false beard were concealed\nabout him. He denied absolutely that this was so, or that\nhe had taken any part in producing the phenomena. They\nthen asked him to allow himself to be searched in the\nadjoining room, but he declined. Mr. Lobb admitted the\nreasonableness of their request, and did his utmost to per\nsuade the medium to accede to it, stating that if it was\nfrom motives of modesty that Mr. Chambers objected, he\nhimself would consent to a similar operation in order to\nput him entirely at his ease. Mr. Chambers, however, per\nsisted in his refusal, and presently took his leave. While he\ndid not in terms confess to any fraud, he promised that he\nwould give no more sittings, but would in future seek his\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

It is understood, how-\n\u2022ever, that he has since resumed his operations in the north of\nEngland, where doubtless an enthusiastic band of earnest\nbelievers will, as usual, in the face of all evidence, continue\nto support his stances.\n(Signed) W. W. BAGGALLY.\nALICE JOHNSON.\nEVERARD FEILDING\n(present at last three sittings).\nLE M. TAYLOR\n(present at first two sittings).\nJOHN LOBB\n(present at last two sittings).\nMr. Lobb adds :\nI endorse the account of the proceedings in so far as it relates\nto the sittings at which I was present. JOHN LOBB.\nWe conceive the above experiments to be of interest, as\nshowing how readily a certain class of persons will without\n\u2022enquiry, test, or control of any kind, accept as evidence of so\ntranscendent a phenomenon as materialisation the childish\nperformances of Mr. Chambers and certain other mediums now\nbefore the public. It is impossible to understand how, without\na long experience of the almost inconceivable credulity of such\npersons, Mr. Chambers ever can have supposed that he could\nby these artless tricks re-establish his reputation as a medium\nfor genuine phenomena. While it is true that the proof of\nfraud on many occasions does not necessarily preclude the\npossibility of genuineness on others, it is equally true that the\nevidence from a thousand stances conducted without any control\nand in the spirit of complete trust and confidence, with eyes\nshut and mouths open,\u2014apparently recommended by Dr.\nTheobald in a recent issue of Light, and since then vehemently\nprotested against by other and no less earnest and sincere\nspiritualists,\u2014cannot advance us one step towards the proof of\nsuch genuineness.\nNot only must such a system be valueless as a means of\nattaining reliable evidence, but it must itself in the long run be\nabsolutely destructive of the very phenomena which it is\nintended to foster. It is a common and wholly justifiable\nanswer by spiritualists when challenged to submit their\n\fPER, 1906. Sittings with Mr. Chambers. 203\nphenomena for inspection that they cannot be produced to\norder. Yet the mere existence of a class of professional physical\nmediums implies that there are a certain number of persons\nwho claim that they can so produce them. And when they\nfind themselves assisted by the all too charitable spirit of\nobservers like Dr. Theobald, what wonder is it that, tempted\nby the opportunities for trickery constantly presented to them,\nthey take refuge in the simple method of deceit, thus gradually\nkilling out any germ of genuine mediumistic faculty they may\noriginally have possessed ?\nIt is not the interest of our Society to expose fraud, but\nrather to seek patiently for evidence of genuine supernormal\nphenomena. If, however, the spiritualist Press in the cause\nof the pursuit of truth should wish to reproduce the above\nreport, together with these comments, they are at liberty to\ndo so.\nSince our report was written, a letter has appeared in\nLight of February 3rd, 1906, from Mr. John Wilson, of\nNewcastle, giving some further details of the exposure of Mr.\nChambers as described by Mr. Easthope, with the following\nstatement :\nI have a copy of the Medium and Daybreak of September 10th,\n1880, p. 578, in which a report appears that Mr. Chambers, who\nwas then giving a seance at Gateshead, told the sitters that it was\ndifficult to materialise whiskers and moustaches, so the \" guide \"\nhad made a false moustache, and it was left as a souvenir !\nTHE EXPLOSION OF A MYTH.\nWE reprint the following correspondence from Light, not from\nany desire to give a wider publicity to our admitted refutation\nof some charges brought against a Member of our Council,\nbut by way of illustrating the kind of criticism which is not\ninfrequently brought against our manner of conducting in\nvestigations and of treating mediums. Misrepresentation so\ncategorical, so circumstantial, and consequently so easily refuted,\nas in this case is rare. Less rare, however, are those mis\nrepresentations made up of more or less vague insinuations,\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.\nwhich are as incapable of disproof as of proof. We hope\nthat this correspondence may serve to prevent an uncritical\nacceptance by our members of accusations that may come to-\ntheir ears of tactless and unsympathetic behaviour on our\npart in the conduct of investigations.\nIn Light of January 6th, 1906, appeared a letter headed\n\" A Caution to Sensitives,\" as follows :\nSIR,\u2014Will you allow me, through your columns, to give a warning\nto all sensitives not to sit at the Psychical Research Society's rooms\nat Hanover-square, at any rate while the present council hold\noffice?\nI am a life member of the Psychical Research Society and much\nregret having to write this, but it is absolutely necessary.\nA friend of mine, who is a fine sensitive, was asked some time\nago to give a reading, which she good-naturedly did, charging\nnothing for her time and trouble. There was a person present who-\nwas smoking a cigar. For a man to fill a room with smoke in the\npresence of a lady to whom he is a perfect stranger, a good deal\nof effrontery is required ; but when the object of the meeting is to-\ntest the phenomena of visualisation his conduct becomes a down\nright outrage. It also implies, either that the offender is entirely\nignorant of the conditions required to obtain psychical phenomena,\nor that he wishes to render the sitting abortive.\nIn this case there is no doubt that this person did know th&\nconditions which clairvoyants demand for the successful exercise of\ntheir gift, and the only conclusion to come to is that his object\nwas to embarrass the lady, and spoil the exhibition of her powers.\nFortunately, there was a gentleman present who (according to\nmy friend's description) must, I think, be a powerful personality\nand mediumistic, for his sympathy and tact dissipated the annoy\nance felt by the sensitive, and saved the situation. She has, how\never, declined to sit again in rooms where she may meet with the\nsame antagonistic elements.\nAbout six or seven weeks after this, and after she had declined\nto sit again, she received a postal order, which just covered her\ntravelling expenses to Hanover-square and back. If the president\nor any vice-president of our Society wish to know the name of the\noffending member, I shall be glad to give it to them.\n8, Western Parade, W. USBORNB MOORE.\nSouthsea. Rear Admiral.\n\fFEB., 1906. The Explosion of a Myth. 205\nThe following reply to this letter appeared in Light of\nJanuary 27th, 1906:\n20, HANOVER SQUARE, LONDON, W.\nJanuary 18th, 1906.\nSIR,\u2014In your issue of January 6th, under the heading of \" A\n\u2022Caution to Sensitives,\" there appeared a letter from Rear-Admiral\nW. Usborne Moore, in which he made the following statements :\n(1) That some time ago a sensitive of his acquaintance gave a\nsitting at the Rooms of the Society for Psychical Research, for\nwhich she made no charge.\n(2) That there was a man present who was smoking a cigar.\n(3) That this man's object (so Admiral Moore was forced to con\nclude) was to embarrass the sensitive and spoil the exhibition of\nher powers.\n(4) That, besides the man who smoked there was a gentleman\npresent who, so Admiral Moore thinks, \"must be a powerful\npersonality and mediumistic, for his sympathy and tact dissipated\nthe annoyance felt by the sensitive, and saved the situation.\"\n(5) That the sensitive declined to sit again at the S.P.R. Rooms\nin consequence of the treatment she received there.\n(6) That six or seven weeks after the sitting she received a\npostal order which just covered her travelling expenses to Hanover\nSquare and back.\nI should have sent you an earlier reply to the charges and\ninsinuations contained in this letter but that it has taken me some\ntime to discover to what incident Admiral Moore's letter referred.\nI applied twice to him for the name of the supposed culprit, but he\nrefused to give it to me, explaining that he did not wish to disclose\nit to \"any one of lesser influence than a Vice-President of the\n\u2022Society.\" Sir William Crookes was good enough to act as inter\nmediary, and I now quote from a letter addressed to him by\nAdmiral Moore on January 16th: \"Unless there are two people of\nthe name of Podmore, who both belong to the Post Office, and are\nmembers of the Psychical Research Society, the person who insulted\nMrs. [i.e. the sensitive] by smoking before and after she entered\nthe room was Mr. Frank Podmore, member of Council.\" The in\ncidental mention of the sensitive's name has enabled me to identify\nthe occasion, for the lady in question has given one sitting, and\none only, at the S.P.R. Rooms. To the coarser senses of Miss\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.\nJohnson and myself, who alone were present1 with her at this\nsitting, the presence in the body of Mr. Frank Podmore, with or\nwithout a cigar, was not perceptible, and there is no other member\nof our Society bearing the name of Podmore.\nWhen the sitting was over it was agreed that the sensitive should\nwrite and let us know when she would come again. She wrote the\nnext day and gave us a choice of five dates, concluding her letter\nwith the words, \" With thanks for your courtesy to me.\" We\naccepted two of the dates proposed, but the sensitive wrote later\nto us that she was unfortunately prevented from coming by the\nsudden death of a friend.\nOn December 12th we learnt for the first time the amount due\nto Mrs. for travelling expenses. On December 13th, that\nbeing exactly three weeks (not six or seven, as Admiral Moore\nstates) after the date of the sitting, a cheque (not a postal order,\nas the Admiral states) for the amount was sent to her. I can\nnot see any object in Admiral Moore's reference to this payment,\nunless, as I suppose, he wishes to insinuate that our treatment of\nher was niggardly. It may therefore be well to explain that we\nunderstood, not only from the member who introduced the sensitive\nto us, but from the lady herself, that she did not accept payment\nfor her sittings.\nIt appears, then, that out of the six statements into which I\nhave split up Admiral Moore's letter, the first alone is true; but all\nthe rest, namely, those on which his charges are based, are untrue.\nThere was an animus shown in Admiral Moore's letter which\npuzzled me until I learnt that the imaginary culprit was that\n\" bogey man \" of spiritualists, Mr. Frank Podmore.\nMiss Johnson and I, who, as I have already said, were alone\npresent during the sitting, desire to state that there was no smoking\neither while the sensitive was here or during the earlier part of the\nday. Miss Johnson appends her signature to this letter by way of\nendorsement.\nThus the affair ends, where it began, in smoke ; except in so far\nas it has furnished an instructive example of the mythopoeie\ntendency.\nJ. Gr. PlDDINGTON.\nALICE JOHNSON.\n'Miss Johnson and I are still jealously, not to say acrimoniously, disputing\nwhich of us has the better claim to be identified with the powerful and\nmediumistic personality whose sympathy and tact saved the situation.\n\fFEB., 1906. The Explosion of a Myth. 207\nAdmiral Moore was then good enough to send ua the following\ncopy of a letter which he informed us he was addressing to Light :\nSIR,\u2014Mr. Piddington and Miss Alice Johnson have stated in your\ncolumns, and at the Annual General Meeting of the Psychical\nResearch Society last Friday that only three people, including the\nsensitive, were present at the seance in the S.P.R. room, and that\nno smoking occurred during the day.\nFortunately there is no doubt about the occasion, as my friend\nhas only once been in the rooms of the S.P.R. Moreover, some\nof her statements to me agree with the notes of the seance.\nI have seen the lady twice during the last few days, and find\nthat in all essentials she adheres to her story, more particularly\nas to the smoking and the number of people in the room, which\nshe declares to have been eight.\nThe person described to me as smoking was reported to have\nsaid, with reference to his \" reading \" :\n\" Of course you know I belong to the Post Office,\" and the\nsensitive alleged that his name was \" Frank Rodmore or Podmore.\"\nThere is only one person to whom this description could apply.\nAs a matter of fact I find that no allusion was made to the Post\nOffice during the stance : certainly Mr. Podmore was not in the room.\nI am quite satisfied that the sensitive is suffering from a hallucina\ntion. If the circumstances she related to me, and which she now\nconfirms in conversation and by letter, ever occurred at all, it was\nnot in the S.P.R. rooms.\nAt painful cost I have now learnt that mediums of great sensi\nbility are liable to impressions of the most varied kind from\nincarnate as well as discarnate spirits. Their organisms are like\nthe wax barrel of a phonograph, and they are specially prone to\nbecome the subjects of hallucinations. They are never normal, and,\nI expect, the more sensitive the medium the greater is the danger.\nI beg to unreservedly withdraw my accusation against the conduct\nof a seance at the S.P.R. rooms on the ground of smoking, and\nto express my belief that the sensitive was treated with all consider\nation. I am sure that no attempt was made to obscure the\noperation of her gift, and I wish to express my regret for any\nannoyance which I may have, inadvertently, caused to the lady\nand gentleman who were present.\u2014I am, Sir, yours faithfully,\n8 Western Parade, W. USBORNE MOORE,\nSouthsea, 3lst January, 1906. Rear Admiral.\nTo the Editor of Light.\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.\nWe should like to express our appreciation of Admiral\nMoore's honourable and straightforward conduct in withdraw\ning unreservedly charges which he was led to make through\nzeal on behalf of a lady whom he believed to have been\nill-treated. We hope, however, that in future any members\nwho may have complaints to make as to our treatment or\nalleged treatment of mediums will bring them direct to the\nresponsible officials of the Society, who, if any indiscreet action\nhas been committed, will be, we think, no less ready than\nAdmiral Moore to acknowledge it.\nNOTE ON A CASE OF AMNESIA.\nTHE case of loss of memory mentioned a short time ago in the\nnewspapers, when a lady had left her home and wandered\nabout for four months till she was taken up by the police\nin a state of destitution, and kept till she could be restored\nto her friends, recalls especially in one particular similar cases\nrecorded in our Proceedings. The real name of the lady was\nGrace Bowyer. Her linen was marked \" G. B,\" and, \" after\nmuch persuasion,\" she gave her name, in reply to the police,\nas \" G. Berill,\" and in reply to a further question \" solemnly\nremarked that ' G. stood for g ' \" (Daily Chronicle, October,\nHth, 1905). In the same way Ansel Bourne in his secondary\ncondition called himself by a fictitious name, which corre\nsponded to his real initials, viz., A. J. Brown, expanded into\nAlbert John Brown under cross-examination during hypnosis\n(see Proceedings, Vol. VII., p. 233) ; and Dr. Wilson's patient,\n\" Mary Barnes,\" called herself \" Mlarian Bearnet \" (Proceedings,\nVol. XVIII., p. 396).\nIn the case of Miss Bowyer, the invented name may, of\ncourse, have been merely suggested by the sight of the initials\non her linen, and not by a faint partial recollection of the\nreal name, which may have been as completely forgotten as\napparently the rest of her previous life was.\n\fNo. CCXXVIL\u2014VOL.

The names and addresses of the newly-\nelected candidates are given above.\nThe monthly accounts for December were presented.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nTHE 127th General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nlarge Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Friday,\nJanuary 26th, 1906, at 4 p.m., when a paper was read by\nProfessor W. F. Barrett on \" Some Objects and Methods of\nWork in Psychical Eesearch.\" The chair was taken by Mrs.\nSidgwick.\nMRS. SIDGWICK, before calling on Professor Barrett to read\nhis paper, announced to the meeting that Mr. G. W.\nBalfour had been elected President for the current year, and\nreferred briefly to the irreparable loss suffered by the Society\nthrough the sudden death of Dr. Richard Hodgson towards\nthe end of the previous month, saying also that memorial\narticles about him would be, it was hoped, included in the\nnext Part of Proceedings.\nPROFESSOR W. F. BARRETT, F.R.S., after expressing the\npleasure which he thought would be universally felt by\nmembers of the Society at Mr. Balfour's acceptance of the\nPresidency, spoke to the following effect :\nIn the sudden death of Dr. Hodgson we have lost one of\nour ablest and most courageous of fellow-workers, and the\nloss to the American Branch of our Society is almost'\nirreparable. It is now many years ago since Dr. Hodgson\njoined our ranks and decided to devote his life, as far as\npossible, to the problems of psychical research. In 1884, as\n\u2022one of the Committee appointed by the Council to investigate\nphenomena connected with the Theosophical Society, he went\nto India to study these alleged phenomena on the spot. We\nA 2\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1906.\nall know the conclusive and pitiless exposure of Madam\nBlavatzky's claims to supernormal power which resulted.\nAfter his appointment as Secretary to the American Society\nfor Psychical Eesearch in 1887, much of his time was spent\nin the investigation of Mrs. Piper, and whether or not his\nfinal conclusions in this case be accepted, we must all\nacknowledge that he has placed the evidence on behalf of the\nexistence of discarnate intelligence, and the continuance of\nhuman life beyond the present, and within the veil, on more\nstringent experimental grounds than it possessed before.\nBut all of us have not the gifts of Dr. Hodgson nor the\nopportunity to investigate so excellent a medium as Mrs.\nPiper, and yet there are very many members of the Society\nanxious to aid in its work if they only knew how. It is for\nthe purpose of trying to show a few ways in which the co\noperation of our members is possible, and will be most helpful\nto the Society, that I propose to speak this afternoon on\n\" Some Objects and Methods of Psychical Research,\" open to\nus all. After all, these objects are only those which led to the\nfoundation of the Society, and the methods are those which\nhave guided us from our earliest experiments. I may give you\nan illustration of what can be done by some of our members\nin the way of experiments in thought-transference.\nOne of our members, whose name I am permitted to mention,\nMiss Miles, is possessed of remarkable powers as a dowser\nor water-finder. In testing her faculty I was led to try some\nexperiments on how she detected underground water, and the\nevidence pointed clearly to something analogous to clairvoyance\non her part. She found twice right out of three times a coin\nI had hidden when she was not present, and the position of\nwhich she could not have found by ordinary sense cognition.\nRecently, at the suggestion of one of her friends, she agreed\nto make a series of experiments in thought-transference at a\n'distance. [A full account of these is printed below, see\np. 223.]\nI hope the experiments will be continued, reversing the\nr61e of agent and percipient, and, further, with the following\nprecautions, which perhaps some present will note if they\nintend to carry on similar experiments :\n(1) The subject thought of should be something that has.\n\fMABOH, 1906. General Meeting. 215\nstrongly, though it may be casually, impressed itself on the\nagent's mind during the day.\n(2) When selected it should be noted and the note or an\nexact copy of it should be at once posted to the Secretary\nS. P. E., or some third person.\n(3) The percipient should likewise write down his impression\nat once and send the note or an exact copy of it to the same\nthird person. Post-cards or letter-cards may advantageously be\nused for these notes, as the post-marks would then afford\nattestation of the dates.\nBut the essence of the experiment is not to try to guess.\nIf you do you will fail. For in that case reason will come\nin, and the impression will probably be what seems reasonable,\nbut may not be correct.\nWait quietly and see if anything floats into your mind.\nHow to excite the brain to some conscious act of speech or\nwriting must be a very difficult problem for the subliminal\nself to carry out. No doubt some automatic motion would\nmore easily express the inchoate impression made. Planchette,\nor automatic writing with a pencil loosely held, or a forked\ntwig (as I shall explain directly) are far more likely to lead\nto success. Even emotional disturbances, such as grief, joy,\npain, pallor or blushing, would probably interpret the sub\nconscious impression more easily if we could arrange a code.\nThen further, note that whilst the impression is doubtless\ntransmitted instantly, the manifestation of the impression on\nthe part of the recipient may remain latent for a time or\ndevelop gradually.\nProfessor Barrett then drew attention to the use of the forked\ndowsing rod as an autoscope, or means whereby the subliminal\nself can express itself, and showed the method of its use.\nMRS. SIDGWICK said she thought it desirable for experiments\nto be tried as widely as possible, and hoped that many mem\nbers of the. Society would follow the advice and suggestions\nthat had just been made by Professor Barrett. Even if the\nexperiments were not successful, they might often throw side\nlights on the topics dealt with, and prove instructive in unex\npected ways. We had reason to think that thought-transference\nwas most likely to be effected through some subconscious process,\nsuch as automatic writing, and members who wished to know\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1906.\nhow best to set about these experiments would find abundant\ninstruction in the articles in the Proceedings dealing with them,\nor might apply to the Secretaries of the Society for advice.\nMR. J. G. PIDDINGTON said that no one could endorse Pro\nfessor Barrett's appeal to members to undertake experiments\nmore heartily than himself. He would, however, like to warn\nintending experimenters against experimenting too often or too\nlong a time at one stretch. Too frequent or too lengthy\nexperimentation was sure to produce boredom, and boredom\nwould lead to failure, or might even lead, as Professor\nBarrett suggested had happened in one instance in the\nCreery case, to graver results than mere failure. Cards and\nnumbers,\u2014though convenient subjects for experiments in\nthought - transference, because the chances of merely\naccidental success could be easily calculated,\u2014were open to the\nobjection that they soon became monotonous and created\nthat sense of boredom which he thought inimical to success.\nProfessor Barrett had suggested as suitable subjects for trans\nference, incidents or thoughts which might have casually struck\nthe agent during the day. He thought this suggestion a good\none, provided that care was taken not to fix on some matter\nof obvious general interest (such as, for instance, the General\nElection would have been during the preceding week) which,\nin the event of the percipient's impression proving correct, could\nbe too easily attributed to mere guessing.\nAt the close of the meeting Professor Barrett exhibited to\nthe audience a number of dowsing rods of different kinds,\nwhich had kindly been sent for the purpose by three well-\nknown dowsers, Messrs. H. W. Mullins, W. Stone, and J. F.\nYoung, and demonstrated the manner in which they were held\nand the movements produced in them by the subconscious and\ninvoluntary muscular action of the dowsers,\u2014movements\nwhich, as he explained, it is by no means easy exactly to\nreproduce by voluntary conscious effort.\n[Professor Barrett writes that he desires to add the following\nnote to the report of the meeting :]\nMay I add a word, parenthetically, here, to say that at the\nmoment I misunderstood Mr. Piddington's remark in reference to\nsome of the early experiments on thought-transference, and I am\nafraid my curt interruption may have led some of the audience\n\fMARCH, 1906. General Meeting. 217\nto think Mr. Piddington was making an attack, either upon\nme, or on the validity of the evidence I had adduced. This,\nof course, was not his intention, and I am anxious to take\nthis opportunity of correcting such an erroneous impression,\nif it exists.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1905.\nIT is satisfactory to note that the total increase in member\nship has been larger than usual this year. During the\nyear 22 new Members were elected, and two Associates\nbecame Members; also 105 new Associates were elected and\nnine Members became Associates. On the other hand, the\ntotal loss in number from various causes was 28 Members\nand 65 Associates, leaving a net increase of 45, whereas for\nthe two previous years the net increase had been 40 per\nannum. The total membership of the Society has now reached\n902, the numbers being distributed as follows : Members 249\n(including 3 1 Honorary and Corresponding Members) ; Asso\nciates 653 (including 12 Honorary Associates). The American\nBranch has also increased from 569 to 604 Members and\nAssociates.\nMiss V. Larminie, who had been Assistant Secretary since\nOctober, 1903, resigned her post on account of ill-health at\nthe end of June. A temporary appointment was made for the\nnext three months, after which Miss I. Newton, who had\nworked in the office since November, 1903, as Junior\nAssistant, was promoted to be Assistant Secretary, and Miss\nC. Bourne was appointed Junior Assistant.\nThe Library Catalogue, which had long been in preparation,\nhas been completed, printed, and issued this year, and Members\nwho use the Library have found it of great help in referring\nto and especially in selecting books.\nThree General Meetings and three Private Meetings of the\nSociety (for Members and Associates only) were held during\nthe year. The dates and the papers were as follows :\n*February 6th. \" Presidential Address,\" by Professor Charles\nRichet.\nMarch 27th. \" Some Normal Extensions and Intensifications\nof Conscious Perception,\" by Mr. Sydney Olivier.\n* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Everard Feilding, and \" A\nBrief Statement concerning Eecent Experiences in\nFrance,\" by Sir Oliver Lodge.\n*December llth. \"On the Scientific Attitude to Marvels,\"\nby Sir Oliver Lodge.\nAmong the investigations and experiments carried on during\nthe year we may mention :\n(1) Mr. Fryer's prolonged and systematic enquiry into\nvarious phenomena of psychical or psychological interest\nconnected with the Welsh Eevival of 1904-5. This was\nconducted mainly by correspondence with many different\npersons in the various districts of Wales into which the\nEevival spread,\u2014supplemented, whenever possible, by a personal\nexamination of the witnesses of or participants in the\nphenomena. The results of the enquiry have been published\nin Part LI. of the Proceedings.\n(2) In the Easter vacation, Mr. . Feilding visited a number\nof mediums, private and professional, in the north of England.\nThe results obtained with one of them, who produced move\nments and levitations of a table, were sufficiently encouraging\nin Mr. Feilding's judgment to warrant further enquiry, and\nMr. Baggally, who had a sitting with the same medium in\nJune, was also favourably impressed. The conditions were so\nimperfect and observation was so difficult that the movements\nproduced could by no means be considered conclusive of\nsupernormal agency, but they were certainly suggestive of it ;\nand it is hoped that further investigations may shortly be\nmade.\n(3) During the summer vacation, Mr. Feilding attended over\ntwenty sittings in a Continental town in hopes of witnessing\ncertain remarkable manifestations on which a report had been\nreceived from an Hon. Associate of the Society. The most\nimportant part of this investigation formed the subject of his\n* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.\n\fMARCH, 1906. Report of the Council. 219\npaper to the Society on October 27th, and a summary of it\nwas printed in the Journal for December.\n(4) Early in the year a number of \" apports \" alleged to\nhave been supernormally produced at the sittings of the\nAustralian medium, Mr. C. Bailey, were sent over to us by\nDr. MacCarthy of Sydney, who had been in charge of the\nsittings. They consisted of coins and clay tablets, which we\nwere requested to submit to experts in England for an\nopinion as to whether they were what the medium stated\nthem to be, viz. genuine ancient Egyptian, Hindoo, and other\ncoins, and Babylonian or Assyrian tablets. The experts at\nthe British Museum reported that the coins were genuine,\nbut not of any value or rarity, and the tablets all forgeries,\n\u2022of types well known to them. The report, together with a\nfull account of the circumstances under which the \" apports \"\nwere produced, was printed in the Journal for May ; a report\nof other sittings with the same medium by one of our\nAustralian members, Mr. A. W. Dobbie, appeared in the\nJournal for July.\n(5) A series of seven sittings was held at the Rooms\nwith the medium Mr. A. V. Peters, of whom we had\nreceived favourable reports from several members of the\nSociety. There were seven different sitters, all belonging to\nthe Society, each of whom came to one sitting, all arrange\nments being made by the Secretary, who took full notes of\nwhat happened. The results were unfortunately inconclusive,\nthe correct statements made by the medium not being\nsufficiently definite or sufficiently numerous to point clearly\nto any agency beyond conscious or unconscious guessing or\nchance coincidence. The Council desire, however, to express\nto Mr. Peters their appreciation of the trouble he took in\ncoming and of his readiness to submit to any test or\nsuggestion that was made.\n(6) A large number of sittings and experiments with\nmembers of the Society and others were also held at the\nRooms in the course of the year, with results too inconclusive\nto be worth reporting in detail. Some of these were hypnotic\nexperiments by Mr. Feilding, designed to test the power of\nresistance to suggestion possessed by susceptible hypnotic\nsubjects. He hopes to carry these experiments further. We\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1906.\nwere also afforded by personal friends several opportunities of\nassisting at some very instructive experiments in self-induced\ntrance, in which \" controls \" of a pseudo-spiritistic character\nappeared. We use the word \" pseudo-spiritistic,\" because,\nthough the manifestations presented a complete analogy to\nthe \" controls \" which are often assumed to be due to spirit\npossession,\u2014the personifications being of a highly realistic and\ndramatic, or indeed melodramatic kind,\u2014there was nothing in\nthe trance utterances that afforded any ground for supposing\nthat they originated elsewhere than in the subliminal con\nsciousness of the mediums ; nor indeed did the mediums\nthemselves regard them as having any other origin.\n(7) In the middle of December, four sittings were held\nwith the \" materialising \" medium Mr. Chambers. At the\nfirst two sittings \" forms \" appeared at the opening of, or just\noutside, the cabinet, which, inasmuch as they declined to-\npermit any examination either of themselves or of the medium,,\nthere was no reason to suppose were other than Mr.\nChambers himself, draped or holding up a piece of white\ndrapery. At the third sitting, the medium at his own\nsuggestion was tied into an armchair and objects were placed\nnear him, which he alleged would probably float in the air\nuntouched by any one. No movements of the objects took\nplace. At the fourth sitting, the medium again went into-\nthe cabinet and \" forms \" were seen. Some of these were\nseen through an opening in the curtain, when withdrawn by\nthe medium, to be produced by Mr. Chambers sitting in his\nchair and holding up a piece of drapery on one arm. In\nthe case of one form, purporting to be that of a woman,\nwhich came out into the room, the trousers of the medium\nwere seen in the hinder part of the form. At the end of\"\nthe sitting Mr. Chambers was informed of what had been\nobserved, and, on his denying that he had taken any part\nin producing the phenomena, was asked to allow himself to\nbe searched in order to prove that the drapery, false beard,\netc., which had been seen, were not concealed on his person.\nHe refused to allow any search whatever to be made. [A\nfuller report of these sittings has appeared in the February\nJournal]\n(8) It gives us special pleasure to be able to report, after\n\fMARCH, 1906. Report of the Council. 221\na long dearth of successful experiments in telepathy, that\nsome members of the Society have turned their attention to\nthis important subject, with encouraging results. We have\nrecently received reports from two of our members, Miss\nMiles and Miss Eamsden, of some successful experiments of\ntheir own in thought-transference. The experimenters were\nliving at a distance of about twenty miles from one another,\nand each of them recorded at the time, before hearing from\nthe other, the idea to be conveyed or the impression received.\nThe full account is printed in the present Journal. An\nAmerican member also has sent us an admirably recorded\nseries of experiments of the same kind, which\u2014though incon\nclusive at present\u2014appear to us decidedly promising.\nThe general progress of interest in the subject of psychical\nresearch which has marked the last few years seems to con\ntinue unabated. This year a local Society has been started\nat Oxford, from which much may be hoped. On March llth\na drawing-room meeting was held there with a view to\ntesting the feeling of residents. A Committee was afterwards\nformed to collect information and stimulate interest, and this\nCommittee arranged for a public meeting in the Hall of\nHertford College on November 13th. Sir Oliver Lodge then\ndelivered an address to a large audience, the pressure for\nentrance being so great that numbers failed to gain admission.\nWe mentioned in our report last year that Mr. Myers's\nHuman Personality (Vol. L, Chaps. 1-4) had been included\namong the books recommended on the subject of Metaphysics\nin the Fellowship Course of Trinity College, Dublin, for\n1905. This year we have been informed that the University\nof Madras had already adopted Human Personality as a text\nbook to be read for the M.A. two years' course in Psychology,\nand an examination paper set on the book in the M.A.\nDegree Examination of January, 1905, was sent to us.\nIt is highly appropriate that the subject should be introduced\nfirst into the most advanced University courses for older\nstudents only, for it has certainly not yet reached a stage\nin which much of it can be formulated in a manner suffi\nciently definite and dogmatic to be profitably taught to the\njunior members of a University.\nThe knowledge attained so far is of a purely empirical\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1906.\nkind ; we can only observe and investigate the facts or\nphenomena that we are fortunate enough to meet with ; we\ncannot yet produce them to order, and consequently cannot\nundertake to demonstrate them experimentally. We can only\nkeep on the look-out for them, and neglect no opportunity\nof observing, recording, and as far as possible investigating,\nany case that comes under our notice.\nMembers of the Society often express a desire to take\npart in experiments or investigations, or enquire what they\n\u2022can do to help on the work. A leaflet issued by the Council\nthree years ago, and still in constant use, indicates various\nlines of enquiry, with brief suggestions for following each,\nviz.: automatic phenomena, experimental telepathy, spontaneous\ntelepathy, communications from the dead, and the so-called\n\" physical phenomena \" of spiritualism. More detailed sug\ngestions,\u2014especially in relation to the first two topics, which\nare obviously those to which our efforts should be first\n\u2022directed,\u2014will be given in Professor Barrett's address to-day\n{an abstract of which appears in the present Journal].\nWe would suggest to our members that those who have\n\u2022opportunities should form small groups among their own friends\nfor trying experiments together. They will probably find one\nor two who exhibit the simpler automatic phenomena ; it will\nbe desirable to note how far these follow the ordinary types\n\u2022(as described in articles in our Proceedings, and especially in\nMr. Myers's Human Personality*), or whether in any respect\nthey depart from them. Any indications of telepathy or\nsupernormal acquisition of knowledge should be noted, and\nthe conditions scrupulously recorded at the time of occurrence.\nThough careful records should always be kept, these need not\nbe in great detail, except in the case of significant incidents.\nIt is desirable for the experimenters to begin by gaining\nsome practical experience of the simpler and more usual\ntypes, and meanwhile to make themselves acquainted with\nwhat has been already done by expert investigators. The\nofficials of the Society would be very glad to receive reports\nfrom any group of workers or to advise them in the conduct\nof their experiments. The work of such groups would offer\nus the best chance of discovering individuals possessed of\nunusual psychic faculties, through whose co-operation alone\n\fMARCH, 1906. Report of the Council. 223\nwill it ever be possible to advance our knowledge of the\nsubject.\nWe cannot close this brief chronicle of the year's events\nwithout referring to the grievous loss and sudden blow which\nfell upon the Society by the death of Dr. Richard Hodgson\non December 20th; but the services which he rendered to\nPsychical Research cannot be summed up in a few brief\nparagraphs, and a fitting tribute to his life and work must\nbe reserved for the pages of the Proceedings.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nWE have often urged on our members the desirability of\ntrying experiments in thought-transference with any of their\nfriends who may show indications of the telepathic faculty,\nso that further evidence may be obtained iii confirmation of\nthe large number of successful results published by the Society,\nespecially during the first ten years of its existence ; but\nthese appeals have not latterly met with much response.\nWe are therefore very glad to be able to print now a series\nof experiments between two of our members, Miss Hermione\nRamsden and Miss Clarisse Miles, which we hope may\nencourage others to try for themselves. Miss Ramsden having\nmet with a certain amount of success with two other friends\n\u2022of hers, asked Miss Miles to try a systematic series with her.\nIt was arranged that Miss Miles, living at 59 Egerton Gardens,\nLondon, S.W., should play the part of agent, while Miss\nRamsden, at her home Bulstrode, Gerrard's Cross, Bucking\nham (about 20 miles from London), acted as percipient, the\ntimes of the experiments being fixed by pre-arrangement.\nMiss Miles noted at the time of each experiment, in a\nbook kept for the purpose, the idea or image which she wished\nto convey, while Miss Ramsden wrote down each day the\nimpressions that had come into her mind, and sent the record\nto Miss Miles before knowing what she had attempted on\nher side. Miss Miles then pasted this record into her book\nopposite her own notes, and in some cases added a further\nnote explanatory of her circumstances at the time, to which\nit will be seen that Miss Ramsden's impressions often corre\nsponded. Whenever it was possible, Miss Miles obtained\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Then the\ntwo seemed to belong together, and I thought of windmill. A\nwindmill on a hill where it was dark and windy and there were\ndark clouds. Then it became the Crucifixion, and I saw the three\ncrosses on the left side of the hill, and the face on the cross looked\nto the right, and it was dark. Wind and storm.\nSurely this is right. It is the most vivid impression I have\never had. I scarcely visualized at all, it was just the faintest indica\ntion possible, but the suggestion was most vivid.\n(c) I was painting Mr. Macnab, and there was a beautiful sunset\nover the Oratory. Mr. Macnab, who was so seated that he could\nwatch it better than I could, walked to the window and drew my\nattention to it. His face became illuminated with the rays of the sun.\nIt was a very windy, stormy evening, with weird orange lights in\nthe sky. The sun sets to the left of the Oratory. From my window\nI see the central figure, and two sorts of uprights which look like\nfigures in the dim twilight. These three objects show out dark\nagainst ihe sky to the left of the dome, on which there is a gold\ncross. All this I visualized the whole evening for Miss Ramsden\nto see. At first I could not account for the windmill. I discovered\na weathercock in the distance, on the top of a building.\n[A photograph of the Brompton Oratory, taken by Miss Miles\nfrom the window of her studio, is reproduced here.]\n(d) There was a most lovely sunset all over the Oratory, and to\nwhich I drew Miss Miles's attention.\nJ.

In this capacity,\ntogether with Professor William James and Professor Bowditch,\nhe acted in America as a representative of the parent Society,\nand consented at the same time to form, with Professor\nJames, an Advisory Committee, under which the work of the\nSecretary and Treasurer of the Branch was conducted.

X.'S GREEK SCEIPT.\nI.\nBY THE REV. M. A. BAYFIELD.\nTHE purpose of this note is to draw attention to certain\ncharacteristics of Mme. X.'s script which seem to me to make\nvery strongly for the genuineness of the phenomenon, whatever\nbe the explanation of it. The conclusions to which I have\nbeen led are based on a protracted examination (with the aid\nof a magnifying glass) of the original writings of all the pieces\npublished in the last issue of the Proceedings, i.e. of the whole\nof the script, except Nos. i to vii, which appear not to have\nreached this country. Their absence, however, can hardly\naffect the argument.\n(1) Ex hypothesi fraudis, Mme. X. must have learned the\nGreek alphabet, i.e. the sound-values of the various symbols,\nsince it is altogether incredible that she could have learned\nwhat she wrote as a mere sequence of pictures. On the other\nhand, if she knew the sounds of the letters, it would be no\ngreat feat to commit to memory, from time to time, so much\nas she wished to write out in Prof. Richet's presence. She\nwould also, I think, give herself at least some little practice\nin Greek writing. This latter assumption, however, may be\nwaived, if any one objects to it, and we will say that the\nfirst time Mme. X. wrote Greek was on Nov. 7, 1899.\nNow, the thing which, upon examination of the script,\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research APKIL, 1906.\nabsolutely saute aux yeux is that it seems to the very last to\nbe the writing of a beginner. This was of course noticed\nby Mrs. Verrall, who remarks on the significance of the fact\n\u2022(Proceedings, Part LI., p. 227). Not only can I confirm what\nMrs. Verrall writes, but I can go further. The magnifying\nglass shows that almost every individual letter from beginning\nto end of the script (and not excepting viii D) has the\nappearance of having been written by one who is tracing Greek\ncharacters for the first time. Perhaps the x for K, and some\nof the x's are the only exceptions. There is continued un\ncertainty of touch, and there is no development of a personal\nscript. But any one who sets himself for the first time to\ncopy Greek type will unconsciously begin to develop a hand\nwriting of his own before he has written half a dozen lines.\nMrs. Verrall detected this in the 19 words written for Sir\nOliver Lodge by Mr. Briscoe (Proceedings, Part LI., p. 223).\nTwo ladies, ignorant of the Greek alphabet, have copied for me\nthe opening lines of the Phoenissae from Valcknaer's edn., 1802,\nthe type of which is very like that of Byzantios' Lexicon.\nOne copied 14 lines, the other 20. Of course I gave them\nno hint of the phenomenon I expected their script to exhibit,\nbut each at once began to develop a characteristic script,\nsuggestive of her ordinary handwriting. What seemed to be\nthe essential characteristics of the letters were rapidly recognised,\nand the copyists were satisfied if they reproduced these, while\nneglecting what appeared to be mere ornamentations or trim\nmings\u2014the differentiae of the type, y is made without taking\nthe pen off; \/ has no curl at the bottom, or very little ; v\nis made like a sharp-bottomed v, with both lines straight or\nelse curving outwards. The text gives two kinds of p, one\nwith a straight, and one with a curled tail ; both copyists\nmake the former like a p, the straight stroke projecting above\nthe loop. In the T of the text the upright stroke has a distinct\nknob on its right side at the bottom (the lexicon tau has,\nI believe, a tiny curl), and the cross-stroke curves downwards\non the left. Both copyists make the upright quite plain,\nand only one attempts to reproduce the curve of the cross-\nstroke, ta is boldly made throughout like a w, save that, on\nthe first appearance of the letter, one lady makes an honest\nattempt to copy the type, curling both horns well in, as Mme. X.\n\fAPWL, 1906. Discussion of Mme. X.'s Greek Script. 235\nalways does. Both write throughout with a firm hand, even when\nmaking the letters badly. Similar inevitable characteristics of a\nconsciously written script will, I have no sort of doubt, be found in\nevery case in which the experiment is made.\nNow let us compare Mme. X.'s script. There is, as has been\nalready said, no advance in the formation of a personal handwrit\ning. Her latest script is as lacking in individuality and distinction\nas her earliest. Her touch is never firm, but always uncertain.\nEven viii D is no exception ; the script is smaller and more\nregular, but the letters, as seen under the magnifying glass, are as\nplainly wanting in the characteristics of a consciously written\nscript as are the other pieces. Mme. X. reproduces three different\nkinds of Greek type ; but in copying each she is apparently\nas careful to reproduce the differentiae as the essentials. Her\nlatest production, Nos. 1 to 12, is not written, but drawn, as by\none copying conscientiously the features of an ornamental design.\nIndeed, in these last pieces so much attention has been paid\nto the accidental, and so little to the .essential features of the\nletters T and t, that we have a most remarkable result. Out\nof 49 iotas some 17\u2014more than one third\u2014are almost upsilons,\nwhile nearly all are curled up too much ; and out of 42\ntaus all but 3 are simply an English J reversed. The three\nexceptions are made with a straight downstroke and a practically\nplain cross-stroke, and it is worthy of remark that they all occur\nin No. 1, the first piece of the set. It would seem that at\nfirst the curl at the bottom of the downstroke had not been\nobserved ; but when once it has been noticed, it becomes liable\nto exaggeration, as had been the case in Nos. ix to xv. In\nNos. viii A-D this exaggeration of the curl of the T is rare.\nThus we see that here again Mine. X. acts in a way diamet\nrically opposite to that of the conscious copyist; she ex\naggerates, and exaggerates increasingly, just that merely orna\nmental feature of the letter which the conscious copyist would\ntend to curtail, or more probably would not reproduce at all.\nIt may be objected that this careful imitation of the printed\ntype was intentional, Mme. X. hoping thereby to convey a\nstronger impression of unfamiliarity with Greek. But the script\npurported from the very beginning (Nov. 1899) to be controlled\nby Antoine Eenouard, who might surely be supposed to have\na script of his own. Moreover, the last stupidity of which\nA 2\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.\na fraudulent Mme. X. would be guilty is the suggestion that\nshe was copying from a printed book. While planning her\nfraud, she searches high and low for a convenient book, and\nas she does so, cannot help discovering that there is a variety\nof Greek types. She finally settles on the Lexicon of Byzantios,\nbut has no means of knowing whether the book is common\nor not, or that Prof. Eichet does not actually possess a copy.\nShe then takes pains to conform her writing as far as possible\nto the two different kinds of type found in the lexicon.1 She\nknows that she will be suspected of copying from a book,\nand she takes this step in order to make detection more difficult!\n0 sancta simplicitas !\n(2) My next point is that, if fraudulent, Mme. X. could\nnot have made the following blunders, not to mention others.\nShe knew the Greek alphabet, and after repeated perusals,\nhad learnt the words by their sounds. The blunders I cite\nare o-ToXtoTiaoV (crToAwyuoi\/y), Sfj.i\\ovs (6\/ouXow), irrj\\oir\\cKpiKrjs\n(\u2022Tn\/XoTrXacrTocjJc), airopdSrjv\u2014as I think was intended to be\nwritten (eriropa&rjv)\u2014IdoTrtSos (ia<ririSo<i), TOU a-rroxpiK^av (rov\ncnroKpv(pov), Mot\/erenow (Mot\/cre\/ou), all in ix B ; irapoSc\nin x ; V\/MV (V\/LUV), iroi\/j-trui (iroDjcria), and TrtcrTeviav\nin 2. As is clearly shown by the accents on consonants and\nthe ^ for \/ in Mov<re\u00a3oi\/, and by iroiftcria, these are visual errors,\nand yet they are made after Mme. X. had, as we must suppose,\nread the words over many times.\n(3) My third point is that Nos. viii A-D, all written by\nMme. X. in private, show many evidences of having been\nwritten by one who does not see what she is writing, and\nare in this respect of a piece with the rest of the script. Of\nthe conditions of the production of ix-xv Prof. Eichet says:\n\" dans un ttat de demi-conscience, elle prit un stylographe,\net, devant moi, debout sur le balcon, elle ecrivit,\" etc. . . .\n\" Mme. X. semblait regarder dans le vide et copier quelque\nchose qu'elle voyait devant elle.\" All this writing is, in con\nsequence, exceptionally unsteady. Nos. 1-12, Prof. Eichet says,\nwere written \" dans un e\"tat de demi-transe . . . devant moi.\"\nAs to the \" demi-conscience \" and \" demi-transe,\" we may surely\n'Mrs. Verrall observes (Proceeding*, S.P.R., Part LI., p. 244) that the type\nused in the Dedication of the Lexicon corresponds with that of Mme X.'s.\nscript, viii B.\n\fAPRIL, 1906.

X. was not copying from\na concealed paper, and of course to attempt this was as un\nnecessary as it would have been unwise.\nThe defects one would expect to find in Greek writing done\nby a person who does not see his work are, I suppose, these:\u2014\n(1) faulty alignment; (2) faulty spacing of letters, words, and\ncommas ; (3) faulty joining of portions of letters made by\nseparate strokes of the pen ; (4) misplacement of accents and\nbreathings, and the occasional putting of a dot for an accent ;\n(5) the coarsening or deforming of a letter by writing over it,\nfrom a doubt whether it has been completed ; (6) uncompleted\nletters; (7) inequality in the size of letters.1 All these defects\nappear in viii A-D, as in the rest of the script.

On the other hand, she could\nnot have imagined that she would have gained anything by\nmaking them intentionally, else why are the breathings and\naccents in viii D so extraordinarily correct ?

There, however, it is more difficult\nto detect, owing to the smallness of the writing as a whole.\nIt may be suggested that Mme. X. purposely wrote viii\nwith her eyes shut, in order to counterfeit trance-writing.\nBut if so, why did she write one piece so much better than\nthe rest ? Moreover, it is highly improbable that any one,\nwriting consciously and with closed eyes, could produce Greek\nscript as good as that of viii D.\nI hazard no conjecture as to the origin of the remarkable\nphenomenon presented by the script. If, however, I were\nasked to account for the differences of style shown in the\nfour pieces of viii, I should suggest that they may well be\ndue to differences in the writer's psychical condition. The\nfour pieces have this in common, that none of them shows\nthat control of the pen which is possessed by a person writing\nconsciously ; and even D, which is the neatest in form,\ngives abundant proof that it was written by a trembling\nhand.\nII.\nBY H. ARTHUR SMITH.\nA PERUSAL in Part LI. of our Proceedings of our late President's\naddress on Xenoglossy, and of the comments based thereon\nby Sir 0. Lodge, Mrs. Verrall, and the Hon. E. Feilding\nand our Secretary, has so greatly interested me that I am\ntempted to devote a spare hour to a record of the impressions\nwhich the argument has made on my mind, impressions\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APBIL, 1906.\nmainly arising from the reply presented by M. Eichet to the\nlast of the criticisms.\nThe force of M. Bichet's objection to these criticisms\nobviously depends to a large extent upon the soundness of\nhis repeated insistence on the fact that a production of the\nGreek writings in question by an effort of memory dependent\non visualisation is so extremely improbable that it may reason\nably be dismissed from consideration in any attempt to explain\nthe phenomena before us. Now I would ask in the first\nplace whether it is to be implicitly accepted that the feat of\nmemory alleged depends on visualisation alone. We are\ninformed that the medium wrote Greek ; we are not informed\nwhether she ever attempted to pronounce it. Let us assume\nthat her ignorance of Greek was such that she could not\nhave vocalised it intelligibly. It does not follow that the\npower of visualisation could have received no assistance from\nan auditory imagination of the sounds suggested. The letters\nof the Greek alphabet have such a general resemblance to our\nown that though a person ignorant of Greek may and will\npronounce them wrongly, nevertheless he may well associate\nwith them some sounds which may serve as an assistance to\nmemory quite as well as the true sounds. Let me illustrate.\nI well remember when a child I once took up my father's\nGreek Testament, which was opened at the second gospel.\nI read the title aloud thus : \" Kata Mapkon.\" It would\nconvey nothing in sense to a Greek or to myself, but as an\nassistance to reproducing the words from memory, it would\nserve as well as the true pronunciation. It may be replied\nthat this experience relates only to capital letters, and that\nthe cursive letters are less suggestive of our own. This is\nto some extent true, but it is not prohibitive. Many of the\nsmall letters are quite close enough to our own to suggest\nsounds, though not always accurate sounds, e.g. a, \/3, y, S, e,\ni, K, v, o, <r, y, T, v, x, a>. Another experience of my own\nmay illustrate my point as applicable to cursive letters. Soon\nafter I began to learn Greek, I came across the word veaw'ay\nin an easy exercise. Not yet being quite versed in the alphabet\nI pronounced it Feairias. It was unintelligible Greek, but\nequally helpful to me as an aid to memory if I was asked\nto reproduce the word.\n\fAPRIL, 1906. Discussion of Mme. X.'s Greek Script. 241\nPerhaps an illustration from another language may be still\nmore to the point. Some time ago, during a tour in Wales,\nI was much struck by the name of a little village in Anglesea.\nThe village is insignificant enough, but it is surely as well\ndescribed as the most ambitious place could desire. The name\nruns :\n\"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.\"\nI thought such an imposing verbal procession as this deserved\nto be remembered, and in a short time I committed it to\nmemory so effectively that though some fifteen years have\npassed I now reproduce it with perfect confidence that its\naccuracy is quite on a par with the Greek quotations in\nquestion. It is of course a descriptive name, but I had not\nat the time the remotest, and have now but a very slight,\nidea as to what it all means, so my memory has not been in\nthe least assisted by knowledge of its translation. But my\nmemory has been assisted\u2014more than that, if I rightly\njudge, has mainly been preserved\u2014by an imaginary interpreta\ntion of the letters into sounds. I say \" imaginary \" because\nI should be sorry to do so much as attempt to pronounce\nit as I once heard a Welsh lady cough it out. I may here\nsay that though my memory for facts is perhaps as good\nas the average, my verbal memory is very imperfect ; so\nmuch so that the feat of learning Virgil's poems by heart,\nwhich Dr. Leaf tells us was accomplished by Mr. Myers,\nis far more incomprehensible to me than the feat of playing\ntwelve games of chess simultaneously blindfold.\nNow these examples seem to me, to take all point from\nthe challenge which M. Richet addresses to Mr. Feilding\nand Miss Johnson. The script of the oriental languages is so\nremote from ours that whether written or printed, whether\nArabic or Sanscrit, Hindustani or Chinese, they convey no\nsort of conception of sound to the uninstructed occidental\nmind. To commit their forms to memory would therefore be\na pure effort of visualisation, and may, for aught I know, be\nas impossible as M. Richet supposes.\nBut further, and in conclusion (for my comments are running\nto excessive length), does not M. Richet underrate the capacity\nof memory, especially memory trained with the assistance of\nwiemoria technica under such systems as those of Stokes,\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.\nLoisette, and others, the astonishing results of which have\noften been exhibited ? Take, for example, the case of Dr.\nRichter, who conducts all the works of Wagner and Beethoven\nand many others without a score, and never misses a point\nof the orchestration. Or to descend to a humbler class of\nartists, take the case of our operatic chorus singers, who\nwill sustain their parts in a great number of operas in\nItalian, German and French, and many of whom, if I mistake\nnot, are quite incapable of understanding the words they\nsing. Be this as it may, I well know a young lady who\nwill sit down and sing for an hour from memory in German,.\nItalian and Latin without being in the least able to construe\nthe words she sings. If such feats, if not quite ordinary, are\nby no means very rare, is it not hasty to lay down the limits\nof a visualising memory with, or even without, such helps\nas my earlier remarks suggest ? Inasmuch as on the doctrine\nof parsimony it is admitted that in our researches we are\nbound to exhaust the possibilities of the normal before resorting\nto hypotheses of the supernormal, I trust that these comments\nwill not be deemed wholly irrelevant to the discussion\nreferred to.\nEXPOSURE OF MR. ELDRED.\nTHOSE of our readers who have followed the accounts of sittings\nwith Mr. Eldred which have appeared in the spiritualist\npapers for about a year past will probably not feel much sur\nprise at hearing of the sensational exposure which took place\non March 5th, as described in Light for March 10th, when\nthe back of the chair that he was using in the cabinet was\nfound to contain a concealed space, in which when opened\nwere discovered many yards of black and white drapery,\na neat pink mask, a variety of highly effective beards and\nwigs, and an electric lamp to make spirit lights.\nMany suspicious features in the performance were noted in\nalmost all accounts of the sittings, notwithstanding the fact\nthat most of the accounts were given by persons convinced\nof the genuineness of the phenomena, who apparently drew no\ninferences from what they observed. Thus, in the course of\neach sitting it generally happened that the supposed \" spirit\nform \" and medium were visible at the same time.

Exposure of Mr. Eldred. 243\nfollowing is a typical description of the appearance presented\nby the medium under these circumstances, taken from a report\nof a sitting at Clowne, near Chesterfield (where Mr. Eldred\nwas then living), on July 30th, 1905, as given in Light, Vol.\nXXV. (1905), p. 416:\nHe had shrunk up like a mummy ; his head seemed to have\nsunk in between his shoulders, and his legs seemed to have become\nshorter. When he had sat down at the beginning of the sitting we\nhad seen his feet reach out under the curtains ; now they scarcely\ntouched the floor. He seemed all shrivelled up, but on his cheeks\nthere was a feverish red spot.\nAnother sitter describing the same phenomenon at what he\nreports as \" A satisfactory stance with Mr. Eldred,\" writes\n(Light, January 27th, 1906, p. 40):\nWords cannot express my astonishment at what I saw ; all I can\nsay is that the medium was shrivelled to half his normal size ;.\nloose baggy skin hung in folds which the spirit handled freely. All\nthis took place in view of all the sitters, the materialised form being\nin full view, walking and talking for about twenty minutes.\nAnother gentleman writes (Light, February 3rd, 1906, p.\n51):\nIt was Mr. Eldred unquestionably, but shrunk and rigid ; his\nhands had nearly disappeared up the sleeves of his coat. The sight\nwas not pleasant, and I advise no one to insist upon seeing a medium\nin this condition.\nThose, indeed, who have seen the photograph (referred to-\nbejow) of the extremely repulsive-looking dummy concocted\nfrom the materials left after the famous sitting of March 5th\nlast, will be able to form some judgment of the nerve that\nmust have been required to face the object itself in the semi-\ndarkness of an actual sitting. Again, a lady reports (Light,\nFebruary 10th, 1906):\nThe medium . . . looked indeed a pitiable object as he sat in\nhis chair. I knelt in front of him and thus perceived that his\nbody was all contracted as well as being about half its normal size.\nThere was also no perceptible movement in the shrunken form ; the\nwhiteness of the face showed in strong relief against the dark back\nground, and there was a set look on the fixed features that one\nassociates with death.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APBIL, 1906.\nSimilar descriptions from believers are to be found in Light\nof the present year, pp. 79 and 80. The same phenomenon\nis described by sceptics in curiously similar terms ; see, e.g.,\na careful and detailed account of a sitting given by Dr.\nAbraham Wallace in Light of Jan. 27th, 1906, pp. 40-41;\nand in another account of the same sitting, signed \" Truth-\nSeeker,\" p. 70, as follows:\nI found the supposed body of the medium to be a dummy.\nThe head of the dummy was, I should say, an inflated bladder.\nIt had rather the appearance of a carnival mask, such a mask as\none often sees worn on November 5th. The body of the dummy\nwas dressed in Mr. Eldred's clothes, the cuffs empty in the most\napproved style, according to the legend which represents Mr.\nEldred as shrunk up to almost nothing, while the materialised form\nis manifesting.\nAnother suspicious point which came out in many of the\naccounts was the mask-like appearance of many of the \" spirit\nforms\"; thus in Light, Vol. XXV. (1905), p. 255, \"Mr. Y.\nsays that . . . her eyes were most indistinct, more like gimlet\nholes than eyes, void of expression.\" Also in Light, Vol. XXV.,\np. 451, \" M. Garsault told us ... the face appeared familiar\nto him, but it had no eyes, only holes in their place, and\nthis had hindered him from identifying the spirit.\"\nThe following is an account contained in a letter from\nMr. Feilding of a sitting at Clowne which he attended on\nApril 23rd, 1905: -\nApril 26th, 1905.\nEldred is a man of about 30, pleasant, and frauk spoken. He\nholds sittings every Sunday, which are attended by working-class\naudiences more or less. He charges no fee, and takes none. He\nhas rigged up a special little seance room, curtained off with a cabinet\ncontaining a big arm chair, a linoleum floor and bare walls, except\nfor a small baize curtain nailed to the wall loose for a background.\nHe asked me to search himself, the chair (which he pointed out\nwas very thick and might contain apparatus) and the cabinet. I\ndid neither. An audience of about ten or twelve sat in two rows,\nthe back row raised as in a theatre, at the opposite end of the\nroom to the cabinet. An unshaded gas-light burned over our\nheads, controlled from the cabinet by the spirits.\nHe promises good conditions, and gives them; so good in fact\nthat his fraud is perfectly obvious. That is the odd thing about the\n\fAPRIL, 1906. Exposure of Mr. Eld\/red. 245\nwhole affair. It is as though having told you that a spirit would\nappear in full daylight from the next room, I presently were\nto emerge thence dressed in a white sheet and a mask, and\nsay I was your grandfather. He was the most daring medium\nI ever heard of. Some dozen or more spirits turned up ; some\ntimes the light was very poor and the faces so shrouded in drapery\nthat nothing could be seen. Sometimes the light was excellent, when\nhe wore an extremely obvious mask, painted and stiff.\nOne of his promises was to show the medium while the spirit\nwas out. This he fulfilled. I was invited up by a spirit to\nwithin 3 or 4 feet of the cabinet, the curtains of which were\ndrawn back, and the light was quite sufficiently good for me to\nsee a mannikin figure surmounted by a large white mask-like face,\nno more resembling the medium than a turnip. I asked if I might\ntouch it, but was not allowed (for fear, as he told me afterwards,\nof cross-magnetism).\nA spirit with a female face came and bowed to me. I was told\nto get up and examine it. I went within a foot of it and saw a\nclear painted mask wearing eyeglasses without rims. I suggested\nvarious real names of the departed, but the spirit shook her head.\nThen I said enthusiastically, \" Are you, are you Miss Elliman ? \"\nThe spirit bowed frantically. \" What ! Mary Elliman ? \" I said.\nGreat bows. \" Mary Elliman that I met that time at the hotel at\nCintra in Portugal?\" Cordial assent. (I have never been to Portu\ngal, nor heard of Mary Elliman.) Another spirit, a man with a\nyellowish moustache, more shrouded, and I think with no mask,\nbut with eyeglasses as before, also beckoned me forth. \"What,\" I\nexclaimed, \" Sidney Parry ! \" (It was really quite like him, but\nSidney Parry isn't dead.) Great emotion and assent. A few other\nwords from me, ending with \" But, my dear fellow, when did you\npass over?\" The spirit, feeling that it had made a, faux pas, then\nimmediately ceased to be Sidney Parry, shook its head vigorously\nand retired behind the curtain.\nA man next to me was summoned by a spirit. Now, I saw that\nspirit as well as he did. It had its face so shrouded that one could\nsee nothing. But he asked if it was his wife, and it agreed that it\nwas, and kissed him and whispered in his ear, and he returned to\nhis seat shaken with sobs.\nSpirits dematerialized visibly, and very obviously, upwards and\ndownwards, by pulling up a black cloth or by sinking gradually on to\nthe floor, and eventually Sir Hector Macdonald, in excellent light,\nand wearing a huge and very plastery mask, with an enormous\nburlesque moustache, turned up. Also a child, which wouldn't come\nfar out from the cabinet up to us, as the others all did (except\nSir Hector), because,\u2014as it was explained by a habitu6, \u2014the sitters\nmight be tempted to pick it up on to their knees. I asked it to\nturn round so that I might see if it was stooping, but it wouldn't.\nI cannot conceive how any one can be taken in. Mr. Phillips'\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.\naccount in the Two Worlds1 is quite accurate, and Mr. Phillips agrees\nthat it looks like fraud. I should rather think it did. The medium\nis not secured in any way, and the only thing that puzzles me is\nwhere he concealed the drapery, which is solid and very voluminous,\nand the masks. I did not search him, because I felt that since he\nasked me to do so, it would be of no use, and I thought that if\nthe affair bore the slightest resemblance to anything genuine I would\nask for a test seance later on. So clear was the fraud that I in\ntended to go and talk it out with Eldred quite frankly and find\nout the man's psychology; and I went again to Clowne in the\nmorning, but found he had gone for a holiday by an early train.\nWith regard to the statement made to Mr. Feilding that\nno fees were charged for the sittings,\u2014whether or not this\nwas the rule at that time,\u2014we learn from an account of a\nsitting at Clowne, dated May 24th, 1905, that \" 5s. each is\nthe charge to strangers, and a nice little income \" (states the\nwriter) \" must result to folk in their position, who I should\nimagine not to have more than 40s. to 60s. a week. He\n[Mr. Eldred] is manager to a grocery store.\" The fees charged\nafter Mr. Eldred had set up in business as a medium at\nNottingham were considerably higher.\nDr. Wallace observed (see Light of January 27th, 1906)\nthe close resemblance between one of the \" spirit forms \" and\nthe medium, whereas the only resemblance between the form\npurporting to be Mr. Everitt and Mr. Everitt himself lay in\nthe size of the beard (a portrait of the late Mr. Everitt having\nrecently appeared in a memorial notice of him in Light).\nOne of the smaller forms was observed by Dr. Wallace to\nbe about the height of an adult on his knees, and to advance\na short distance from the cabinet in a somewhat undulatory\nmanner, as a person on his knees would do.\nStill more definite evidence of fraud was found at a sitting\nwith Mr. Eldred by the Nottingham Spiritual Evidence Society,\na report of which appears in Light of Feb. 3rd, 1906,\npp. 52-3. The report is signed by Mr. J. Fraser Hewes,\nPresident, and Messrs. W. J. Leeder, Robert Birtle, Alfred E.\nStevens, Thomas L. Eees, and T. Squires. On this occasion\nthe medium was tied in the cabinet in the only manner in\nwhich his manager, Mr. Ellis, would permit, permission being\nrefused to the sitters to fasten him in any way which they\n1 In this account, stress is laid on the extraordinarily artificial and mask*\nlike appearance of many of the \" spirit \"-faces.\n\fAPRIL, 1906. Exposure of Mr. Eldred. 247\nconsidered satisfactory. The fastenings were made into a knot\nand nailed down to the floor, and the heads of the nails\nsealed with sealing wax. A form came out from the cabinet\nsome little distance into the room. Afterwards, while singing\nwas going on, \"a momentary reflection of yellowish light\nwas observed on the ceiling above the cabinet, and at least\nfive of the sitters smelt the peculiar odour of burning sealing\nwax ; the intermittent bright light inside the cabinet was also\nseen again close to the position of the seals.\" When these\nwere examined after the sitting Mr. Hewes found that both\nthe original seals were gone, and that one of the fastenings\nhad been re-waxed with three little pats of fresh wax, but\nthere was no seal. The other fastening had not been re-waxed,\nbut the seal was gone, and the top of the nail left bare. The\nnails were loose in the floor and came out quite easily.\nA later letter from Mr. Hewes, published in Light of\nFeb. 17th, 1906, p. 80, states that the spirit light which\nfigured at so many of the sittings \" has turned out to be\ntwo watch glasses, back to back, with phosphorescent paint\ndaubed on the inside.\" One of these lights was broken in\nthe course of one sitting, and some pieces of it were kept\nby two of the sitters and afterwards examined. Mr. Hewes\nsays that the light could still be seen in the dark on looking\nat the fragment a month later. What appears to be the same\nform of \" spirit light \" figures in accounts of some of the earlier\nsittings, see Light, Vol. XXV. (1905), pp. 415 and 520; also\nin a letter following that of Mr. Hewes's just referred to, by a\nsitter believing in the phenomenon, who remarks that it \" very\nmuch resembled a large piece of opal, only full of light.\"\nA further interesting detail is given by Mr. Hewes as to\nthe method of so-called \" dematerialising \" (see Light of Feb.\n17th, 1906, p. 80), \"Mrs. Eichardson also states that when\none of the forms was dematerialising, she could see a dark\nobject being drawn upwards, thus covering the white drapery.\nIn the case of a diminutive form she saw the knees sticking\nout in front.\" This latter sentence seems to confirm Dr.\nWallace's opinion as to the short form which he saw, while the\n\" dark object \" was probably one of the pieces of fine black\ncloth found on the occasion of the exposure on March 5th,\nthe report of which we now proceed to quote from Light of\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.\nMarch 10th, 1906, as given by Dr. Wallace and Mr. John\nLobb. Dr. Wallace writes :\n... At a meeting held on the evening of Monday last, the 5th\ninst., at the house of Mr. Ronald Brailey, in Bayswater, the nefarious\ntrickery of Mr. Eldred and his manager, Mr. Ellis, was completely\nexposed. The week previously some interesting phenomena were said\nto have taken place which astonished most of the sitters, but among\nthese was a friend of Mr. Brailey's, whom I know to be a gentleman\npossessing a well-balanced judgment and keen critical powers. . . .\nThis gentleman expressed to Mr. Brailey his suspicions, and after the\nstance, learning that the cabinet and chair used by Mr. Eldred had\nbeen sent from Nottingham, and were left for further meetings, he\nsuggested to Mr. Brailey that he ought to try his psychometric\npowers on the chair. . . . The chair had been carefully packed away\nwith the cabinet, but at the instigation of his friend these were un\npacked by Mr. Brailey, and, placing his hand upon the chair, he\nsaid, pointing to the back of it : ' There is a secret compartment here ! '\nThis statement was proved to be true by subsequent examination,\nand in the back a small keyhole was found deeply embedded and well\ncovered up by the plushette material. Mr. Brailey communicated his\ndiscovery to Mr. Lobb, who had been one of the circle, and he,\nknowing my interest in the case, telephoned to me. A key was\nmade which opened the lock, and a photograph was taken showing the\nsecret compartment, which measures fifteen inches by two inches.\nWe determined after this discovery to put a stop, at the next\nmeeting, to any further fraud. I was asked by Mr. Lobb (who\nhad to go out of town) to arrange a method of trapping the\nculprits. Several of the sitters at the approaching sitting on Monday\nwere informed of the discovery. I asked one or two good Spiritualists\nto be present, and I knew of a good clairvoyant who arranged to\nassist. The stance having been opened in the usual manner, a\nsearch of the medium was made and the chair was particularly\nnoted. It was found that the stuffing at the back of the chair\nwas more pronounced, and the sensitive referred to, Mr. Drew, on\npsychometrising it, assured those present that it contained some\nvery suspicious articles which must have been placed there just\nbefore the stance. The key was used and the upholstered panel\nin the back of the chair fell forward, the space being completely\npacked with articles necessary for faking 'spirit forms.'\nIt was then found that the secret recess contained a collapsible\ndummy head, made of pink stockinet, with flesh-coloured mask\n(with pieces of stockinet gummed over the eye holes) ; the loose\nstockinet was doubtless used to represent the shrunken skin at\nthe neck ; six pieces of fine white China silk containing in all\nthirteen yards ; two pieces of fine black cloth (doubtless used in\nthe so-called dematerialisations) ; three beards of various shades ;\ntwo wigs, one white and one grey ; an extending metal coat-\nhanger for suspending drapery to represent the second form, with\nan iron hook on which to hang the form ; a small flash electric\n\fAPBIL, 1906. Exposure of Mr. Eldred, 249\nlamp with four yards of wire with switch, which could be used\nwhen the medium was away from the cabinet to produce so-called\nspirit lights within ; a bottle of scent, pins, etc. . . .\nOn being challenged with the fraud, Mr. Eldred confessed his\nguilt and handed over the key of the secret compartment. Instead\nof charging the two individuals we tempered with mercy our sense\nof horror, disgust, and indignation at such infamous proceedings. I\nrequested the return of the money taken, which I must say was\npromptly done, and I confiscated the dummy articles, which are\nnow in the office of Light for inspection. . . .\nMr. Lobb's account was as follows :\u2014\nMarch 6th, 1906.\nIt is with much pain I have to inform your readers that Spiritualism\nis to-day face to face with a disgraceful fraud in the person of Mr.\nCharles Eldred, of Nottingham. We are indebted to the spirit\nworld, through Mr. Ronald Brailey, the clairvoyant, for the dis\ncovery of the method by which the cleverly-arranged, wicked fraud\nhas been perpetrated. On February 22nd, Mrs. Lobb and myself\nwere invited to a se'ance at Mr. Brailey's house for materialisation,\nMr. Eldred being the medium. A few days after the stance Mr.\nBrailey was impressed to examine the chair which had been used\nand left there by Mr. Eldred, and his clairvoyant powers enabled\nhim to discover a space in the high back, large enough to contain\na suit of clothes, that could be hidden away under the plush. A\nlocksmith was sent for, and the enclosure opened; a key was made,\nand the chair carefully put back for the second stance, which was\nto be held on Monday night last, March 5th. After a consultation\nwe resolved to photograph the chair and its open space, and await\nresults. I communicated with Dr. Abraham Wallace, of Harley\nStreet, W., and arranged for some strong men to be present in an\nadjoining room with the doctor. Accordingly, on Monday evening\nlast, after the medium had been stripped and examined, we took\nhold of the said plush chair, and demanded the key; failing to\nobtain it, we opened the space in the chair with the key we had\nhad made, and there, exposed to the view of all, were the\ndraperies, masks, false hair, etc., which had been employed by Mr.\nEldred in his impersonations of different spirits. Mr. Eldred at once\nowned up. No language is too strong to express our pain and\ndisgust. ... JOHN LOBB.\nThe stage properties, as stated above, are now at the office\nof Light. The collapsible dummy head or mask, which may\nhave been used either as a mask or to represent the dummy\nof Mr. Eldred, could be drawn completely over the head,\nand is partially stiffened by a piece of coarse canvas gummed\non the inner surface of the face. By means of the metal\ncoat-hanger for suspending drapery, the second form could be\nmade to appear either in contact with the first or at a little\n[Continued on page 252.\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

All these objects could be concealed in the\ncompartment in the back of the chair, being of such a nature\nas to be easily folded into a very small space. They could\nalso be concealed without much difficulty inside a man's\nclothes, and it is not improbable that this was the method\nused during some at least of the earlier sittings, since it\nappears that it is only comparatively recently that Mr.\nEldred has allowed himself to be searched after the sitting.\nIn an account given by Admiral Moore in Light of Feb.\n3rd, 1906, it is stated that at a sitting held at Nottingham\non Jan. 16th, 1906, the \"control\" said that \"for once\" the\nmedium should be thoroughly searched after he came out of\ntrance, and Mr. Halstead (whose letter about the same sitting\nappears in Light of Feb. 24th) has informed us that they\nwere told by the entranced medium on this occasion that they\nshould have a privilege that had never been granted before\nand never would be again, viz. that of being allowed to search\nthe medium after the sitting.\nThe chair is an innocent-looking folding chair, with wooden\narms, the seat and middle part of the back being covered\nwith thick plushette. The middle part of the back projects\nforward a little, as if thickly stuffed ; but if one sits in the\nchair and leans back, even though devoid of any special\npsychometric discernment, one is impressed at once with the\nsensation of a hard instead of a yielding surface. This is\nproduced by a piece of wood inside the plushette, which\nforms the front of the secret compartment, the back of it\nbeing formed of another piece of plushette. Two photographs\nof the chair and other accessories have been taken by Messrs.\nMartin & Sallnow (416 Strand, London, W.C.). One of these,\nwhich is reproduced in Light of March 17th, shows the secret\ncompartment, a \" spirit form \" composed of some of the drapery\nand the mask, the \" spirit light \" with its electric switch, the\nwigs, beards, etc. The other shows a dummy seated in the\nchair, its head formed of the mask, and exhibiting the features\nso frequently described by sitters.\nWe propose in our next number to give an account of the\nrecent exposure of Mr. Craddoek.\n\fNo. CCXXIX.\u2014VOL.

W., on Friday, March 30th, 1906, at 2.30\np.m.; the President, the Right Hon. G. W. Balfour, in the\nChair. There were also present: Mr. W. W.

Meeting of the Council. 257\nOn the proposal of the President, Mr. Piddington, who\nhad expressed his willingness to go to Boston for the purpose,\nwas given full powers to act on behalf of the Council in all\nmatters relating to the American Branch.\nThe Council authorised two Officers of the Society to affix\nthe Society's seal to a power of attorney or other such\ndocument as they may be advised to be required to enable\nMr. Piddington to deal with and arrange the affairs of the\nBranch.\nPRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND\nASSOCIATES.\nTHE 14th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only\nwas held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.,\non Friday, March 30th, 1906, at 4 p.m., the President, the\nRight Hon. G. W. Balfour, in the Chair.\nTHE HON. EVERAED FEILDING read a paper on \" Some\nObservations and Experiences reported by Mr. W. G. Grotten-\ndieck.\" The first part of the paper consisted of a preliminary\nreport of some experiments in motor automatism carried out\nby Mr. Grottendieck with a friend of his, Mr. B. Mr. B.,\nwhile remaining in his normal condition of consciousness,\nexecuted a number of involuntary movements, sometimes spon\ntaneously and sometimes in response to the suggestions of Mr.\nGrottendieck. These suggestions, however, were as a rule only\nefficacious when addressed to a supposed \" control,\" not when\naddressed to Mr. B. himself. One of the \" controls \" sometimes\nmanifested an extraordinary degree of hypersesthesia of hearing ;\nbeing able to respond to suggestions made in a low whisper\nby Mr. Grottendieck standing outside the closed door of the\nroom in which the medium, with his ears stopped with cotton\nwool, was sitting, while the latter, if addressed directly in\na loud voice, appeared unable to hear anything at all. The\n\" controls \" were also able to produce in Mr. B. automatic\nmovements in opposition to his conscious will and desire, and\nto use his muscles with considerably greater force than he\ncould voluntarily exert. In all these respects the phenomena\nwere analogous to those often met with in hypnotic experi\nments, the \" control \" playing the part of the suggestible\n\f258 Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1906.\nhypnotic personality, but manifesting itself simultaneously with\nthe normal personality. It tried but failed to exhibit any\nindication of supernormal powers either psychical or physical.\nAfter an interval for tea, Mr. Feilding read the account of\nthe case of \" Poltergeist \" phenomena witnessed by Mr.\nGrottendieck, which is printed below, and a discussion\nfollowed.\nMR. F. PODMORE pointed out that it must have been\ndifficult or impossible for Mr. Grottendieck to watch the boy\nlying on the floor at the same time that he was seeing the\nstones come through or from the ceiling. He remarked that\nthe abnormal slowness of motion of the stones was a pheno\nmenon frequently described in Poltergeist cases, and that this,\ncombined with Mr. Grottendieck's impression that the move\nments of the boy were extraordinarily slow, suggested that\nhe was at the time in a slightly abnormal condition, during\nwhich he might have been liable to illusions.\nSIR LAWRENCE JONES remarked that considering the length\nof time that the phenomena appeared to have been going on,\nit was curious that not more than about twenty stones were\nfinally picked up.\nMRS. SIDGWICK said that, as Mr. Grottendieck himself had\nsuggested, it seemed possible that part of the phenomenon\nwas hallucinatory. If so, some of the stones he imagined\nhimself to have seen falling might have been hallucinatory\nstones.\n. PROPOSED MEMORIAL TO MR. MYERS AT\nCHELTENHAM COLLEGE.\nWE think that all members of the Society will be interested\nin hearing of the proposal to erect a memorial to Mr. Myers\nat his old school, and we therefore gladly print a circular\ndescribing the scheme which has been sent to us by Mr.\nF. J. Cade, of Cheltenham College.\nThere is a general feeling that the time has come when some\nmonument to the memory of Frederic W. H. Myers should be\nplaced within the precincts of his old school as a tribute to his\nbrilliant genius and indefatigable energy, and as a token to those\nwho follow hereafter.\n\fMAY, 1906. Proposed Memorial to Mr. Myers. 259\nIt is thought that not only Old Cheltonians, but men of letters in\nboth hemispheres, and the many colleagues of his research into the\nmysteries of human personality, might wish to contribute to such a\nmemorial of the passing hence of a spirit that, monument or no\nmonument, will live in the minds of men.\nHis gifts were so manifold and various that it is not easy to\nthink of any adequate mode of commemorating them. A poet from\nhis childhood, an Inspector of Schools during the best years of his\nlife, and in his leisure hours one of the first organizers of higher\neducation for women, he nevertheless found time to be a brilliant\nwriter of prose on literary and philosophic subjects, a strenuous\nvindicator of the immortality ot the soul, and the author of what\nmay yet prove to be the greatest book of the twentieth century.\nIt is thought that his latest and most passionate endeavour to pierce\nthe veil of the unseen world and enlighten the minds of his fellow-\nmen, lends itself best to symbolic treatment and is most suitable for\na prominent place in the Chapel of Cheltenham College, where it\nis proposed to place the Memorial.\nIn six bays of the Chapel, below the windows and above the\nstalls, the lunettes under the arches are to be filled in memory of\nOld Cheltonians, with paintings illustrative of the principal instances\nrecorded in Scripture of the contact of the Spirit world with this\n'world by the Service of Angels. On the North side are scenes from\nthe Old Testament, on the South scenes from the New Testament ;\nover the South door, as the crowning point of the whole, expressing\nthe triumph of immortality, is to be painted the announcement by\nthe Angel of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is proposed that\nthis picture should be the Memorial of Frederic Myers, and the\nwhole bay is to symbolize that confident hope of immortality of\nwhich, with infinite labour and patience, he sought to assure his\nfellow-men.\nBeside and over the entrance by the South door, is to be a tree,\ncarved in pear-wood, symbolizing the Tree of Life. A rose-tree\nhas been chosen in remembrance of the words in Myers' autobio\ngraphy, where he speaks of the garden in the old home at Keswick.1\n\"The thought of Paradise is interwoven for me with that garden's\nglory ; with the fresh brightness of a great clump and tangle of\nblush roses, which hung above my head like a fairy forest and\nmade magical with their fragrance the sunny inlets of the lawn.\"\n,Singing birds, bees and other insects, in the branches will show the\n1 Fragments of Prose and Poetry, published by Longmans, Green & Co.\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY, 1906.\njoy of life, and its continuance after death is symbolized by the\ncaterpillars and butterflies carved in the border of foliage above the\nstalls. A tablet beneath the tree will bear a memorial inscription ;\nhere we shall have, in wood and metal, the teaching of his own\nfavourite poet Virgil, in a passage which \"those lesser lives\" in\nspired, and which Myers has so exquisitely translated :\n\"To God again the enfranchised soul must tend,\nHe is her home, her Author is her End ;\nNo death is hers ; when earthly eyes grow dim\nStarlike she soars and Godlike melts in Him.\"\nDesigns have been made by Mr. H. A. Prothero, the Architect\nof the Chapel, and himself a friend and school-fellow of Myers, and\nthe carving will be in the hands of a firm to whom has lately been\nentrusted the repair of one of Grinling Gibbons' finest works, the\ncarving once in Winchester College Chapel.\nThe cost of the memorial is calculated to be about three\nhundred pounds.\nSubscriptions will be received in\nLONDON : by Sir WILLIAM CROOKES, F.R.S., 7 Kensington\nPark Gardens, W.,\nSir ROBERT COLLINS, K.C.B., Broom Hill,\nEsher, and\nMajor C.

Grotten-\ndieck, of Dordrecht, Holland, and discussed at the meeting of\nthe Society on March 30th, 1906, as reported above. The\naccount was accompanied by a number of drawings, not repro\nduced here. These show the construction of the house as\ndescribed in Mr. Grottendieck's letters. All the rooms were\non one floor, raised above the ground by wooden piles, which\npassed vertically up through the floor and supported the sloping\n\fMAY, 1906. A Poltergeist Case. 261\nroof. The partitions between the rooms were wooden frame\nworks, consisting of vertical and horizontal beams, the spaces\nbetween which were covered with \" kadjang \" leaves. The rooms\nwere unceiled and the partitions between them did not reach\nup to the roof. Mr. Grottendieck's native servant slept in the\nroom next to him, there being a wooden door in the partition\nbetween the two rooms. The point in the roof from which\nthe stones fell was approximately over this partition. Mr.\nGrottendieck writes : l\nDORDRECHT, January 27th, 1906.\n... It was in September, 1903, that the following abnormal fact\noccurred to me. Every detail of it has been examined by me very\ncarefully. I had been on a long journey through the jungle of\nPalembang and Djambi (Sumatra) with a gang of 50 Javanese\ncoolies for exploring purposes. Coming back from the long trip, I\nfound that my home had been occupied by somebody else and I\nhad to put up my bed in another house that was not yet ready,\nand had just been erected from wooden poles and lalang or kadjang.\nThe roof was formed of great dry leaves of a kind called \" kadjang \"\nin Palembang. These great leaves are arranged one overlapping\nthe other. In this way it is very easy to form a roof if it is only\nfor a temporary house. This house was situated pretty far away\nfrom the bore-places belonging to the oil company, in whose service\nI was working.\nI put my bullsack and mosquito curtain on the wooden floor and\nsoon fell asleep. At about one o'clock at night I half awoke hearing\nsomething fall near my head outside the mosquito curtain on the\nfloor. After a couple of minutes I completely awoke and turned\nmy head around to see what was falling down on the floor. They\nwere black stones from \u00a3 to f of an inch long. I got out of\nthe curtain and turned up the kerosene lamp, that was standing\non the floor at the foot of my bed. I saw then that the stones\nwere falling through the roof in a parabolic line. They fell on the\nfloor close to my head-pillow. I went out and awoke the boy (a\nMalay-Palembang coolie) who was sleeping on the floor in the next\nroom. I told him to go outside and to examine the jungle up to\na certain distance. He did so whilst I lighted up the jungle a little\nby means of a small \" ever-ready \" electric lantern. At the same\n1 At his request we have made a few verbal alterations in those parts of\nthe narrative where the English was slightly incorrect or not idiomatic.\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1906-\ntime that my boy was outside the stones did not stop falling. My\nboy came in again, and I told him to search the kitchen to see if\nanybody could be there. He went to the kitchen and I went\ninside the room again to watch the stones falling down. I knelt\ndown near [the head of my bed] and tried to catch the stones\nwhile they were falling through the air towards me, but I could\nnever catch them ; it seemed to me that they changed their direction in\nthe air as soon as I tried to get hold of them. I could not catch any\nof them before they fell on the floor. Then I climbed up [the\npartition wall between my room and the boy's] and examined [the\nroof just above it from which] the stones were flying. They came\nright through the \"kadjang,\" but there were no holes in the kad-\njang. When I tried to catch them there at the very spot of\ncoming out, I also failed.\nWhen I came down, my boy had returned from the kitchen and\ntold me there was nobody. But I still thought that somebody might\nbe playing a practical joke, so I took my Mauser rifle and fired\n5 sharp cartridges into the jungle from [the window of the boy's\nroom]. But the stones, far from stopping, fell even more abundantly\nafter my shots than before.\nAfter this shooting the boy became fully awake (it seemed to me\nthat he had been dozing all the time before), and he looked inside\nthe room. When he saw the stones fall down, he told me it was\n\" Satan \" who did that, and he was so greatly scared that he ran\naway in the pitch-dark night. After he had run away the stones\nceased to fall, and I never saw the boy back again. I did not\nnotice anything particular about the stones except that they were\n-warmer than they would have been under ordinary circumstances.\nThe next day, when awake again, I found the stones on the\nfloor and everything as I had left it in the night. I examined the\nroof again, but nothing was to be found, not a single crack or hole\nin the kadjang. I also found the 5 empty cartridges on the floor\nnear the window. Altogether there had been thrown about 18 or\n22 stones. I kept some of them in my pocket for a long while,\nbut lost them during my later voyages.\nThe worst part of this strange fact was that my boy was gone,\nso that I had to take care of my breakfast myself, and did not get\n.a cup of coffee nor toast !\nAt first I thought they might have been meteor-stones because\nthey were so warm, but then again I could not explain how they\n\u2022could get through the roof without making holes !\n\fMAY, 1906. A Poltergeist Case. 263\nIn answer to our questions, Mr. Grottendieck gave further\nparticulars in later letters as follows :\nFebruary 1st, 1906.\nIn the Dutch East Indies this phenomenon seems to happen\npretty often ; at least every now and then it is reported in the\nnewspaper, generally concerning a house in the city. But I never\ngave myself the trouble to examine one of these cases, for the\nsimple reason that it is an impossibility to control at the same\nmoment all the people that are living around. . . .\nJust because the house where I was sleeping was situated all\nalone, far away from other houses, I thought that this case might\nbe of more interest than other similar cases. Let me repeat the\nfollowing particulars of it.\n(1) All around the house was jungle, in front, behind, to the\nleft and to the right.\n(2) There was no other soul in the house and kitchen than\nmyself and the boy.\n(3) The boy certainly did not do it, because at the same time\nthat I bent over him, while he was sleeping on the floor, to awake\nhim, there fell a couple of stones. I not only saw them fall on\nthe floor in the room, but I also heard them fall, the door being\nat that moment half open.\n(4) While the boy was standing in front of me and I shot my\ncartridges, at that same moment I heard them fall behind me.\n(5) I climbed up the poles of the roof and I saw quite distinctly\nthat they came right through the \" kadjang.\"\nThis kadjang is of such a kind that it cannot be penetrated\n(not even with a needle) without making a hole. Each \" kadjang \"\nis one single flat leaf of about 2 by 3 feet in size. It is a\nspeciality of the neighbourhood of Palembang. It is very tough\nand offers a strong resistance to penetration.\n(6) The stones (though not all of them) were hotter than could\nbe explained by their having been kept in the hand or pocket for\nsome time.\n(7) All the stones without exception fell down within a certain\nradius of not more than 3 feet; they all came through the same\nkadjang-leaf (that is to say, all the ones I saw) and they all fell\ndown within the same radius on the floor.\n(8) They fell rather slowly. Now, supposing that somebody\nmight by trickery have forced them through the roof, or supposing\nthey had not come through it at all,\u2014even then there would\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1906.\nremain something mysterious about it, because it seemed to me\nthat they were havering through the air ; they described a parabolic\nline and then came down with a bang on the floor.\n(9) The sound they made in falling down on the floor was also\nabnormal, because considering their slow motion the bang was\nmuch too loud.\nThe same thing had happened to me about a week before; but\non that occasion I was standing outside in the open air near a tree\nin the jungle, and as it was impossible to control it that time (it\nmight have been a monkey that did it), I did not pay much\nattention to it. ...\nFebruary 13th, 1906.\nThe construction of the house is very different from that of\nEuropean houses. It is all open, as all houses in the East Indies\nare. There was no ceiling in the house.\nThe walls forming the rooms did not extend as far up a\u00bb\nthe roof, so that there was an open space between the walls and\nthe roof. This last circumstance was the reason why I examined\nthe phenomenon so closely and climbed up along the vertical poles\nof the wall up to the roof, to assure myself that the stones were\nnot thrown over the wall through the open space.\nThe partition between the place where I was sleeping and\nthe place where the boy was sleeping was continuous all around\nthe four sides of the room, there being a closed door between us\ntwo. This partition was a wooden framework, with kadjang nailed\non it, forming that way a solid wall, which did not however\nextend up to the roof (as just described).\nThe only wooden floor was formed of 2 inch boards, nailed\ntogether, there being no holes in the floor.\nI am sure of the date, 1903, because in June, 1903, my\nsister died, and after this strange phenomenon occurred to me, I\nbegan to ponder whether there might possibly be any connection\nbetween my sister's death and the falling stones. After the\nphenomenon had taken place, I bought a book about spiritism, to\ntry to find an explanation. Before the phenomenon occurred to me\nI had read nothing about spiritism, but I had often thought about\nit. I am not at all convinced that there was any connection be\ntween the falling stones and my sister's death. At the moment\nthat the phenomenon occurred to me, I did not think about\nspiritism.\nAs I said before, one of my impressions was that the stones\n\fMAY, 1906. A Poltergeist Case. 265\nmight have been meteor-stones, on account of their being hot. I\nput them in my pocket and carried them about with me for a long\ntime, as there was a geological Professor coming to visit us and\nto inspect our work. I intended to have the stones inspected by\nhim, but before he came the stones had been lost.\nI hope that my plan is plain enough to give you an idea of\nthe way in which I watched the stones coming through the roof.\nI was inside the room, climbed up along the framework to the top\nof the wall, held on with one hand to the framework and tried to\ncatch the stones with the other hand, at the same time seeing the\nboy lying down sleeping outside (in the other room) on the floor\nbehind the door, the space being lit up by means of a lamp in his\nroom. The construction of the house was such that it was im\npossible to throw the stones through the open space from outside.\nI wrote before that it seemed to me that the boy had been\ndozing all the time after I awoke him. I got that impression\nbecause his movements seemed to me abnormally slow ; his rising\nup, his walking around, and everything seemed extraordinarily slow.\nThese movements gave me the same strange impression as the\nslowly falling stones.\nWhen I think over this last fact (for I remember very well the\nstrange impression the slowly moving boy made on me) I feel now\ninclined to suggest the hypothesis that there might have been\nsomething abnormal in my own condition at the time. For,\nhaving read in the Proceedings about hallucinations, I dare not\nstate any more that the stones in reality moved slowly ; it might\nhave been on account of some condition of my own sensory organs\nthat it seemed to me that they did, though at that time I was not\nin the least interested in the question of hallucinations or of\nspiritism. I am afraid that the whole thing will ever remain a\npuzzle to me.\nThe criticisms on the case made at the meeting of the\nSociety on March 30th having been communicated to Mr.\nGrottendieck, he wrote again on April 3rd, reiterating in\nfurther detail his reasons for thinking it impossible that the\nboy could have thrown the stones without being detected by\nhim ; viz., that three stones came through the roof while he\nwas touching it with his left hand and looking over the top\nof the partition at the boy ; again, while he was leaning\nover the boy to awaken him and facing towards the open\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1906.\ndoor leading into his own room, he both saw and heard\ntwo stones falling there : also, while he was shooting into\nthe jungle, the boy standing a little in front of him and\nto his right, so that he could see if he moved, he heard\nstones falling on the floor behind him. He was entirely\nalone in the house, but for the boy. The coolies had brought\nhis instruments and tools there and then gone on to the bore-\nplace, about four kilometres from the house, to which the boy\nalso went when he ran away. On the first occasion referred\nto when he witnessed some stones falling and thought they\nmight possibly have been thrown by a monkey, another\nservant was with him\u2014a Soendanese native\u2014whereas on the\nsecond occasion the boy was a Malay Palembang coolie.\nEXPOSUKES OF MR. CRADDOCK.\nTHE following account of the most recent exposure of Mr.\nCraddock, referred to in our last number, was given by Colonel\nMayhew and published in Light of March 24th, 1906.\nBeing anxious to witness the phenomenon of materialisation, my\nwife and I were taken by some friends of ours to Mr. Craddock's\nhouse at Pinner to take part in a seance. We went in perfect\nconfidence, and without a shadow of suspicion, but by the time the\nseance was over, we were forced to the conclusion that the whole\nthing was unadulterated fraud. The room in front of us was pitch\ndark, and, behind the circle, it was slightly illumined by a red\nphotographic lantern. After an address by the medium in supposed\ntrance, voices of an unquestionably \" ventriloquial \" character com\nmenced. They could easily be recognised as the medium's voice\ndisguised. After somewhat lengthy intervals, forms, purporting to\nbe relations of sitters, came round the circle, illumining their faces\nwith luminous screens. Most of these bore a striking resemblance\nto one another, and were \"fakes\" of a most obvious character\u2014the\nfalse beard, moustache, etc., being badly stuck on\u2014and would have\ndone poor credit to a fourth-rate marionette show. One or two\nforms, pretending to be relations I had never had, came to me,\nand a little child called to my wife, calling her \"mother\"\u2014.we\nhave never lost a child ! My wife and I were forced to agree that\nthe performance was a fraud.\nWe went again the week after, and the same characters were\nimpersonated, i.e., Dr. Graem, Dr. Arnold, Sister Amy, La belle\nCerise, and Joey Grimaldi. Again the same miserable farce took\nplace, which could only find its parallel in the gullibility of some\nof the sitters, one lady remarking to her husband, as a form came\n\fMAY, 1906. Exposures of Mr. Craddock. 267\nto them, \" Why, it's your father ! \" and he, the husband, answered,\n\" Why, so it is\u2014no, it isn't, it's mother ! \"\n\" Joey \" informed me that one of the spirits present was my\nmother, who, I am glad to say, is alive, and, for her, very well.\nI therefore determined to expose what I was convinced was\nfraudulent, and having obtained an invitation for my wife, self,\nand my friend, the Hon. Dudley Carleton (late 9th Lancers), we\nattended last Sunday afternoon at Pinner, paying thirty shillings.\nThe usual impersonations were made. \" Joey \" announced that\nMr. Carleton's mother was present\u2014Lady Dorchester being alive\nand well ! A small piece of mirror was handed round and we\nwere asked to believe it was a spirit-light. An old person, with a\nstuck-on white beard, went to one or two, and then there came\nto me a form with a turned-up white moustache, evidently stage\nproperty. He came quite close and I immediately seized him by\nthe arms. He struggled violently, and, unable to get away, threw\nhimself backwards into the cabinet, pulling me with him. I called\nfor light from Mr. Carleton, who carried a small electric lantern,\nand I found the person I had seized was Mr. Craddock\/ Some\nconfusion followed and the medium was recognised by the light.\nA Mr. Rodd who was present saw him remove the false moustache\nand place it in his pocket. I then released him, and his wife\nconcealed him behind the curtain. He then pretended to go under\ncontrol of Dr. Graem, who expressed disapproval of the proceedings.\nRear-Admiral Moore, who was \" in charge,\" now assumed command,\nwith the approval of all, and appointed a search committee to search\nthe medium and his wife. The door was locked and the key given\nto Admiral Moore. The lamp was lighted and I found a small\nelectric torch, evidently used for \"spirit\" lights, in a drawer in the\ncabinet, which, when examined by several before the seance, had\nbeen empty. The medium, however, refused to be searched, and ordered\nus out. Mrs. Craddock attacked Admiral Moore with the fire shovel\nin her attempts to get the key from him. Admiral Moore again\ndemanded a search from Craddock, who placed himself in a fighting\nattitude and threatened to \"set about\" any one who touched him.\nEverything possible was done for some time to get the medium\nto submit to a search, but although the Admiral begged him for\nthe sake of his wife and child and his reputation, he resolutely\nrefused. The Admiral then told him we could only conclude that\nhe was a fraud, to which he said : \" Call me what you like, you shall\nnot search me now.\" The medium offered a test seance at a future\ndate.\nMr. Carleton, Mr. Rodd, and my wife give me full leave to state\nthat they concur in every way in my denunciation of Craddock as\na fraud and a trickster. He may have been, may be now, a medium,\nbut I say without doubt that on this occasion he was caught red-\nhanded impersonating spirits.\nI would add that I am perfectly convinced of the main features\nof the faith held by Spiritualists, and this experience in no way\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

It occurs,\non the contrary, (as M. Sage has pointed out to us) in a\nbook entitled There is no Death, by Florence Marryat [Mrs.\nBoss-Church] (pp. 142-3). In regard to the passage in the\nAnnales, Sir William Crookes writes to us :\n\" As far as I am concerned there is not a word of truth\nin it. Nothing of the sort ever happened in my presence, in\nmy house or elsewhere.\"\nIt seems particularly unfortunate that in a journal where\nthe name of Sir William Crookes appears on the cover, and\nin an article consisting of animadversions on the alleged in\naccuracies and unscientific spirit of an opponent, the writer\nshould have been betrayed into this unlucky confusion between\ntestimony offered by Sir William Crookes and that offered by\nMiss Florence Marryat.\n\fNo. CCXXX.\u2014VOL.

M. A. BAYFIELD read a paper on Mme. X.'s Greek\nscript, facsimiles of most of which had appeared in the Journal\nfor April. He reiterated the arguments he had there brought\nforward in favour of the genuineness of the script, illustrating\nhis remarks by reference to the characteristics of individual\nletters. He maintained that the script showed many indica\ntions of having been written by one who did not see what\nshe was writing, in accordance with the description given by\nProfessor Eichet of one occasion, when Mme. X. appeared to\nbe looking into vacancy and to be copying something that\nshe saw before her. He gave a careful and minute analysis\nof the kinds of defects that appeared in the writing and\nwhich, he alleged, one would expect to find if the writer\nwere not looking at his work. The chief of these were : faulty\nalignment ; faulty spacing of letters and words ; faulty joining\nof portions of letters ; misplacements of accents and breathings;\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.\nthe coarsening or deforming of letters by writing over them\nagain ; incompleted letters ; inequality in the size of letters.1\nSIR WILLIAM CROOKES said that after hearing Mr. Bayfield's\nvery clear exposition of the problems connected with this Greek\nwriting, it seemed to him probable that many of those pre\nsent would agree with the views put forward. He was inclined\nto think, however, that if, for instance, a piece of his own\nordinary writing had been submitted to the same searching\nscrutiny, the alignment, spacing and formation of the letters\nwould have been pronounced so bad that the conclusion might\nhave been warranted that the writer knew nothing about the\nEnglish language. It was necessary, therefore, to consider\nwhether the features to which Mr. Bayfield had drawn atten\ntion were really characteristic of automatic as distinguished\nfrom ordinary writing.2\nAs an illustration of the mental processes involved in the\nact of automatic writing, he might mention a case that had\noccurred in his own presence, when a medium dictated with\ngreat rapidity a number of letters, which when written down\nappeared completely unintelligible, but were found, when read\nbackwards, to form coherent sentences. The medium was not\nin trance ; but she said she saw the letters as in a vision before\nher, and dictated them rapidly with apparently no idea of their\nmeaning. He thought it probable that Madame X. might\nsimilarly have seen the Greek letters in a visionary manner,\nand might have copied them from their visionary prototype.\nMR. F. C. CONSTABLE said that in examining this case, one\nwas reminded of the old maxim that \" it was better to hang\n19 innocent men than to let one guilty one escape,\" and\nhe thought that from the point of view of establishing a new\nscientific fact, it was better to reject 19 genuine cases than\nto accept one fraudulent one. Our object in investigating this\nscript was not to hold a brief for it, but to examine the\n1 See Journal for April, 1906, p. 237.\n2 Mr. F. C. Constable points out that in a letter written to him by the\nEditor many of the defects mentioned by Mr. Bayfield occur, which might\nsuggest that the writer did not see what she was writing; e.g. the dots some\ntimes occur over the i's and sometimes over letters subsequent to them, and\nthe alignment, spacing and joining of letters are often faulty : also the same\nletters, e.g., d and g, are made in several different ways, from which it might\nbe argued that the writer had not developed a \" personal script.\"\n\fJDNE, 1906. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 273\nfacts, and the fact of the writing having been given could\nnot reasonably be separated from the fact that it was given\nin Greek, with the apparent object of convincing Professor\nEichet that it was due to the agency of his great-grandfather.\nIt was difficult therefore 'to find any tertium quid; on the face\nof it, it was either a case of deliberate fraud, or Madame X.\nwas the instrument of Professor Eichet's great-grandfather for\nthe production of the script. We had then to consider what\nsigns it showed of ordinary human agency and intelligent\nadaptation of means to ends. It appears to him that distinct\nhuman intelligence was shown in the pieces VIII. A, B, C,\nand D, in adapting the length of the passages and the size of the\nscript to the size of the paper. It would be seen that A covers\nthe whole of one side, and D half the other ; that the paper\nwas then turned round and B and C were written to fill the\nrest of the page. In the Dictionary, A can be seen to be a\nshorter passage than D ; it seems therefore that D was deli\nberately written in very small writing, and with a fine pen,\nso that it might be got into the page and leave room for\nsomething else. In making marginal notes, or in any case\nwhere space is cramped and hand-writing has consequently to\nbe smaller than us.ual, it is invariably found that it is more\ncarefully done. This general principle fits in with the fact\npointed out by Mrs. Verrall that D is considerably more\ncorrect than the other pieces. He thought human intelligence\nwas again indicated in changing the source of the script after\nMadame X. had been informed that Professor Eichet had\ndiscovered the phrases in the Byzantios Dictionary\u2014and also\nperhaps in parading the first source by signing \" Byzantios\u2014\nA. A. B.\" With regard to the substitution of Gallia for Hellas\nin VIII. B, it could be seen in the script that an English\ncapital H had been written first, and then changed to the Greek\ncapital G, the upstroke of the G being made of the left upstroke\nof the H, and the rest of the H being half obliterated by the a\nwritten over it. If this word had been seen clairvoyantly, or\nin a vision produced by a \" control \" who knew Greek, it seems\nhardly possible to suppose that there would have been this\nconfusion between the English H and the Greek G, which on\nthe other hand is easily accounted for by attributing it to a\nhuman intelligence with the knowledge of the Greek alphabet.\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

CRADDOCK.\n[Continued from the May Journal, p. 268.]\nAdmiral Moore writes in Light of March 24th, 1906, in\nconfirmation of Colonel Mayhew's account :\nMarch 19th, 1906.\nI regret to have to inform you that Mr. Craddock was detected\nlast night, at a seance held in his own house at Pinner, in helping\nout his manifestations.\nWhile the face of a man was being exhibited by illuminated slate\nto Colonel Mayhew, the form was seized by him, a light was turned\non, and Mr. Craddock was found on the floor in his arms. When\nthe medium had scrambled into his seat a voice (not his natural one,\nbut that which we usually recognise as the voice of the control\n' Giaem ') talked volubly of the iniquity of \" breaking conditions.\"\nMrs. Craddock rushed in and there was much confusion, not, how\never, sufficient to prevent one of the sitters observing that the\nmedium took something from his face and put it in his pocket.\nThe door was locked and the key given to me.\nSo far I hoped that this would prove nothing more than a case\nof \" transfiguration,\" but when Mr. Craddock had come out of trance,\nwhich he did in about eight or ten minutes, he refused to be\nsearched, and violently demanded that the door should be unlocked.\nIn the meantime Mr. Carleton found an \" Ever-ready \" electric light\napparatus in the drawer of a table in the cabinet which, previous\nto the seance, had been found to be empty.\nI now carefully, and I hope not unkindly, explained to Mr. and\nMrs. Craddock that the problem of \" transfiguration \" was known to\nus all, and the medium would probably be acquitted of conscious\nfraud if he would allow his person and room to be searched. This\nthey vociferously refused, Mr. Craddock saying he would give a\ntest stance at the rooms of the Alliance. Three times it was put\nbefore the pair that a search was the only way to clear the\ncharacter of the medium, but without success.\n\fJUNE, 1906. Exposures of Mr. Craddock. 275\nI now consulted Colonel Mayhew, Mr. Carleton, and two other\ngentlemen. We agreed that the repeated refusal of Mr. and Mrs.\nCraddock to allow themselves and the room to be searched, together\nwith the discovery of the \" Ever-ready,\" was sufficient evidence of\ntrickery ; and to end a painful scene, of which four ladies were\nunhappy witnesses, I allowed the door to be unlocked and Mr.\nCraddock to go out.\nI know Mr. Craddock to be a medium, for I have seen and heard\nmanifestations when he has been in trance (four or five phenomena\nsimultaneously) which are inexplicable by any theory of jugglery\nknown to man; but last night he undoubtedly attempted to amplify\nhis natural powers by fraudulent means. . . .\nW. USBORNE MOORE (Rear-Admiral).\nIn Light for March 31st, 1906, appeared a letter from\na Member of our Council, Mr. W. M'Dougall, stating that\nabout six years ago at a sitting with Mr. Craddock he had\nseized a \" materialised \" form which claimed to be that of an\nIndian, Abdullah by name, and had found it to be the medium.\nHe had published an account of the exposure at the time\nin The Two Worlds for July 28th, 1899, but the editor,\nwho had witnessed the exposure, refused to insert the name\nof the medium. This account was as follows :\nA professional medium, who claims to have enjoyed a large and\nlucrative practice upon the credulity of the good people of many\ncities and large towns, recently arranged to give two \"sittings,\"\nor \"stances,\" at a private house near Manchester, for a fee of \u00a35\na sitting, his usual charge. The \" medium \" proposed to \" materialise \"\nvarious spirits, and to make them visible and audible to us his\nclients . . . The \" medium \" arrived with his business manager or\nagent, and later some half-dozen acquaintances also came, who were\nsaid to be useful in the establishing of \"sympathetic conditions.\"\n[Here follows a description of a stance of the type with\nwhich those who have sat with Mr. Craddock are familiar.]\nAlmost the same group of sitters assembled again [next night], and\nthe meeting proceeded with similar solemn fooleries as on the previous\nevening, including a progressive lowering of the lights and increasing\nfervour in the singing of hymns. Thus was the \"medium\" encouraged\nto issue from his curtained retreat in the form of the materialised\nspirit of an Indian, his face darkened by a mask, and his head\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.\ncovered with a simple white turban. This awe-inspiring vision\nbegan to make the tour of our semi-circle, showing to each in turn\nthe face dimly lit by the phosphorescent pasteboard. When my\nturn came I rose and seized the head in my arms and dragged it,\ntogether with the violently resisting body of the \"medium,\" into\nthe gaslight of the next room. There was a scene of some confusion\nwhile the \" medium \" and his agent received corporal chastisement.\nThe \"medium\" was sullen, and would not speak except under com\npulsion. The agent was made to take an oath to the effect that\nhe would never again aid in similar proceedings, and the meeting\ndispersed. The mask of thin india-rubber sheeting was picked up\nfrom the floor of the dark room, and a knotted handkerchief, which\nhad probably served as the turban, was in the \" medium's\" pocket.\nIn his bag, when unlocked, we found, beside other small \" properties \"\nuseful in \"making up,\" an interesting pocket book in which are\nthe names of a number of people, including our own and those of\nseveral well-known and titled persons, and appended to each were\nslight notes of their family affairs and relations. Several of these\nnames we know to be those of persons who have attended \" seances \"\ngiven by the \"medium.\"\nThe above account is published here in the hope that readers of\nthe Two Worlds will be deterred by it from taking part in any\nsuch \"sittings\" conducted in the dark by professional mediums who\nwork for pay. The whole proceedings were, to my mind, of a\ndegrading and reprehensible character. . . . Yet this \" medium \" has\nsucceeded in finding many respectable and sincere persons who were\nprepared to pay him as much as \u00a35 per sitting. The name of this\nperson is known to the editor of Two Wmids, who can vouch for the\nessential accuracy of the above account, and who will forward any\nletter of inquiry on this subject to me.\nM.A., M.B., Cantab.\nThe india-rubber mask taken from the \" materialised form \"\nby Mr. M'Dougall on this occasion is now in our possession.\nIt is adapted to cover the forehead only and is painted a ground\ncolour of dark pink, with two black crescent-shaped bands\nto represent the eye-brows. In a sufficiently dim light the\ncrude colouring tones down into a very realistic representation,\nof a brownish skin, while the lower edge of the mask is\ncompletely invisible, appearing to be continuous with the face\nabove which it is placed. The effect of a similar mask seen\nin a good light is well shown in a flash-light photograph of\n\f\fPHOTOGRAPH OF MR. CRADDOCK AS ABDULLAH.\nTo face p. 277.\n\fJUNK, 1906.

Smith, who writes concerning it :\nTHE LABORATORY, ROMAN CRESCENT, SOUTHWICK,\nBRIGHTON, December 19th, 1905.\n. . . You will see many suspicious points in this picture. The\nmedium no doubt was astonished when he saw the prints next day,\nfor he made a hasty departure and could never be induced to con\ntinue the experiments. I think it was a revelation to him what\ncould be done with modern photographic weapons in qualified\nhands. You will notice especially the false beard, the obvious\nfalse forehead fitting over the nose, the creased drapery, whilst one\ncorner of this latter showing in the photograph confirms the firm\nconviction I entertained at the time that the effect was obtained by\nthe use of a strip of material\u2014not a whole garment\u2014by this means\nsaving bulk. Some of the other pictures betray other evidence of\ntrickery\u2014for instance one shows clearly his watch chain and shirt\nfront through the drapery. I never had prints from these negatives.\n[The gentleman who took the photographs] is an expert photo\ngrapher, and executes commissions for the illustrated press. I was\ninvited to attend as an independent photographic expert who would\nbe able to testify that there was no humbug in that quarter. [The\nphotographer] was a spiritualist, and expected to convince sceptics\nby the experiment. He admitted the meaning of the results, how\never, and hoped to get Craddock again for a more complete\nexposure. But as I have said, he, Craddock, saw the prints and\nevidently took fright. 1 don't suppose he will allow flash-light and\nmodern lenses to play upon his performance so readily again. We\ntook two flash-light shots, using three cameras each time\u2014six pictures\nin all.\nMr. Smith's original notes of this sitting have unfortunately\nbeen mislaid, but he tells us that he thinks it took place\nin the year 1899. We reproduce the photograph here. It\nwill be noted that the mask or false forehead is marked with\na broad white arrow, probably of luminous paint, while the\narrangement of the false beard would make the face appear\nmuch shorter and broader than it really is, since the part of\nthe chin that is seen below it in the photograph would\nprobably be invisible in a very dim light, such as is used\nat these sittings.\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nMR. GROTTENDIECK'S POLTERGEIST.\nI.\nTHE case of Poltergeist described by Mr. Grottendieck (Journal,\nMay 1906) appears to me good. Probably the percipient's only\ncompanion, \" the boy,\" was not a boy. Girls and boys are always\nsuspected ; but Mr. Grottendieck uses the word \" boy,\" I presume,\nin the colonial sense, meaning a male native servant.\nAgain, Mr. Grottendieck had not, at the time of the incident,\nlearned, from a perusal of the Society's Proceedings, that if one sees\nobjects moving slowly, with a \" hovering \" and wavering flight, the\nexplanation is that one is in a condition \" something abnormal.\"\nWith great candour Mr. Grottendieck (p. 265) is now ready to suppose\nthat the stones moved slowly \" on account of some condition of his\nown sensory organs.\"\nI am unaware that there exists any proof of a condition of the\nsensory organs which causes people, presumably \" excited,\" to see\nthings moving, as, in fact, they are not moving, but rather in the\nwavering, swerving, and hovering manner which Mr. Bosanquet com\nmunicates to his slow bowling. As Mr. Podmore observed at the\ndiscussion of March 30, in Poltergeist cases, \"the abnormal slowness\nof motion of the stones \" (and other objects) \" is a phenomenon\nfrequently described.\" Certainly it is, but that the appearance is\nhallucinatory, or the result of an abnormal condition of the sensory\norgans, is the merest conjecture, devoid of experimental proof. Mr.\nPodmore \"is disposed to explain the appearance of moving slowly\nor flying as a sensory illusion, conditioned by the excited state of the\npercipient \" (Studies in Psychical Research, pp. 157, 158). Mr. Podmore's\ndisposition to explain that excitement\u2014with remarkable uniformity\nin all parts of the world\u2014causes excited persons either to see\nthings moving slowly when they are moving normally,\u2014or flying\nwhen they are not flying\u2014is a disposition which I do not share.\nI have elsewhere remarked (The Making of Religion, 1900) that\nit is odd if \"in states of excitement the same peculiar form of\nhallucination develops itself uniformly in America, France, Germany,\nEngland, Russia,\" and South Uist ! To these local centres of identical\nhallucinations we may now, thanks to Mr. Grottendieck, add Sumatra.\nMeanwhile must we accept Mr. Podmore's disposition to explain,\nwith his hypothesis based on that disposition, as warrant for a law\n\fJUNE, 1906. Correspondence. 279\nof nature 1 The servant also moved slowly. But he did not move\nabove the level of the soil in mid air, like the stones, and his slowness\nMr. Grottendieck (before reading Mr. Podmore's law) attributed to\nthe fact that the \" boy \" (like the Fat Boy) was \" dozing all the time.\"\nThis is a natural explanation. When he awoke (p. 262) and saw\nthe stones falling, he did not move slowly any longer ; he bolted.\nWas it Mr. Grottendieck who awoke ? for, after the native fled, the\nstones ceased to fall.\n\" Mr. Podmore pointed out that it must have been difficult or\nimpossible for Mr. Grottendieck to watch the boy lying on the\nfloor at the same time that he was seeing the stones come through\nor from the ceiling\" (p. 258).\nMr. Grottendieck, however, does not say that while he \" bent\nover the boy,\" he saw stones \"come through or from the ceiling.\"\nHe says that he saw, and heard, the stones \"fall on the floor.\"\nExperiment proves that, in the attitude indicated, this can be done.\n\"Through or from the ceiling\" are unconscious additions to the\nphenomena made by Mr. Podmore, as his remarks are reported.\nWhen bending over a boy, or other object, you certainly cannot\nsee the ceiling, but you can see the fall of an object, at least\nI can.\nIt is perfectly clear that, however the stones were set in motion,\nthey were not set in motion by the \" boy.\" Without believing in\na poltergeist, I can more easily believe in that, than in the explanation\nof excitement affecting with such uniformity the sensory organs of\npercipients from Sumatra to South Uist. The South Uist case\nwas very picturesque, but the percipient who reported it, a clergy\nman, is dead. ANDREW LANG.\nII.\nHaving had the advantage of long conversations with my friend,\nMr. Grottendieck, I have a wish to take up the cudgels in defence\nof his Poltergeist, the doings of which were recorded in the last\nJournal.\nI cannot indeed yet go the length of expressing a fixed opinion\nthat it was a Poltergeist,\u2014that would be going further than Mr.\nGrottendieck himself,\u2014but I do express the opinion that the\nparticular explanations suggested by Mr. Podmore in the discussion\non March 30th are clearly inadmissible.\nFrom my acquaintance with Mr. Grottendieck, I say most posi\ntively that it is unthinkable to me that the events which have so\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.\nmuch perplexed him could possibly have had their origin in any\nso simple a cause as his boy, whether with or without a catapult,\nas was suggested at the meeting by another critic. In the first\nplace, if you throw, or still more, catapult a stone against a kadjang\nroof, you make a noise. Now, I understand from Mr. Grotten-\ndieck that no noise attended the appearance of the stones throuah\nthe roof, but only on their reaching the floor, when they made\nmore noise than they ought to have done. In the second place,\nto pitch a series of say 20 stones, at precisely the same point of\na slanting roof so that they should rebound over a partition and\nfall to the floor within a radius of 3 feet, sometimes from within\nthe house, and sometimes from outside, and for a good part of\nthe time under close observation, is a feat of which I hesitate to\nbelieve even a Malay boy with a catapult capable. Thirdly, some\nof the stones were hot,\u2014not so hot, as I understand, as actually\nto burn, but hot enough to cause Mr. Grottendieck to put them\ndown rather hastily. Fourthly, they appeared to fall slowly, and\nto evade attempts to catch them, either at the moment of their\nappearance through the roof when Mr. Grottendieck's hand was\nactually touching it, or of their approaching the floor.\nNow, from these premises, it seems clear that neither of Mr.\nPodmore's hypotheses (a) that the boy did it; (b) that Mr.\nGrottendieck was in an abnormal or hallucinatory condition, will\ndo by itself. They must be combined. Not only must the boy\nhave been possessed of a mastery over the flight of stones, in\nitself almost amounting to a \" phenomenon,\" but he must have had\nthe cunning to select the precise moment to play an exceedingly\nsilly trick on his master just when the latter had gone into such\nan \"abnormal condition\" as to predispose him to be taken in by\nit. This is too much. Mr. Podmore must really try again. Eightly\nconsidered, his hypotheses are mutually destructive. If Mr. Grotten\ndieck was in an abnormal condition, why lug in the boy ? And\nif he was not, how account for his observations 1 The mere record\nof his behaviour in climbing up a post to the roof and firing oflf\nfive cartridges of itself disposes of any notion of abnormality of condi\ntion, a notion only suggested to Mr. Grottendieck by a study of\nthe Proceedings. Would that these volumes were always perused\nwith the same reverence and attention ! It may be that my\nown unhappy experiences with another Poltergeist, recently described,\nhave made me unusually tender towards this one, but I do submit\nthat Mr. Podmore has not adequately applied his ingenuity to the\n\fJUNE, woe. Correspondence. 281\nproblem before us, and that a more plausible line of criticism is\ndue from him. EVERARD FEILDING.\nIII.\nI have just re-read Mr. Grottendieek's account of his Poltergeist\nexperience. I have also read, with a growing sense of shame and\nconfusion, the report of my own remarks, together with Mr Lang's\nand Mr. Feilding's comments ; for really, when set side by side in\nprint, the suggestion I made seems ludicrously inadequate to explain\nthe wonderful phenomena described by Mr. Grottendieck. In one\nrespect, indeed, the briefness of the report has led Mr. Lang to do\nme an injustice. When I said that it must have been difficult for\nMr. Grottendieck to watch the boy at the same time that he was\nwatching the stones, I was^ referring not, as Mr. Lang, assumes, to\nthe occasion when Mr. Grottendieck bent over the sleeping boy, but\nto the occasion when he climbed the partition and tried to watch\nthe stones at the same time that he was seeing the boy asleep on\nthe floor (pp. 262 and 265). To perform that feat, Mr. Grottendieck\nwould have needed a reptilian eye in the top of his head. But\nanyway Mr. Grottendieck says that the stones fell whilst the boy\nwas outside in the jungle, and fell also whilst the boy was standing\nin front of him, and whilst he was bending over the boy still asleep.\nAnd if Mr. Grottendieck is describing what really happened, the\nboy can scarcely be supposed to have thrown them on all these\noccasions.\nMr. Lang is inclined to believe that Mr. Grottendieck is describ\ning what really happened. Mr. Grottendieck will pardon me if I\npresume to express my doubts. There are two main general grounds\non which the accuracy of any narrator must be held open to\ndoubt. (1) His memory may be at fault. I notice that the account\nwas not written down until some time after the event. The account\nin the Journal is dated January 1906, and from a paragraph on\np. 264, \"I am sure of the date,\" etc., it may be inferred that\nthere is no earlier account. Many of the details are, however,\nrepeated more than once in the various letters dealing with the\nsubject, so that we have what amounts to two or more accounts\nwritten by the same person at different times. Now, in these\naccounts there is at least one important discrepancy, bearing on the\nvery point in dispute between Mr. Lang and myself. From the\nletter dated January 27th, 1906 (p. 261), it appears that the order\nof events was as follows :\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.\n(1) Mr. Grottendieck is awakened by a noise of something falling,\nlooks round and sees black stones falling on the floor, gets up and\nturns up his lamp, and sees that the stones are falling through the\nroof.\n(2) He goes into the next room, finds the boy asleep, wakes him\nup and tells him to go out and examine the jungle. The boy goes\nout. Meanwhile the stones continue to fall.\n(3) The boy returns and is told to search the kitchen. He goes\ninto the kitchen. While he is there, the following events take place :\n(4) Mr. Grottendieck having returned to his own room kneels\ndown on the floor and tries in vain to catch the stones as they\nfall. He then climbs up the partition wall between his room and\nthe boy's to examine the part of the roof from which the stones\nare falling ; they appear to him to come through it, but without\nleaving any perceptible holes ; he again tries in vain to catch them\nas they fall.\n(5) When he came down the boy \" had returned from the kitchen,\"\nhaving presumably re-entered the room while Mr. Grottendieck was\nstill on the wall. He then fires his rifle into the jungle. The stones\ncontinue to fall. The boy now becomes completely awake, having been\napparently half asleep before ; he sees the stones fall, is greatly\nterrified, and runs away. The stones then cease to fall.\nThough the details are not described in the same order in the\nletter of February 1st, there is nothing necessarily implying that\nthey occurred in a different order. Turning, however, to the letter\nof February 13th (p. 265), we find Mr. Grottendieck says that,\nwhen he climbed up the wall to see the stones coming through the\nroof, the boy was at the same time lying down asleep in his own\nroom on the other side of the wall. Now this is quite inconsistent\nwith (4) above, according to which the boy had been awakened\nand had carried out several orders before Mr. Grottendieck climbed\nup the wall.\nOne of these two accou-nts then\u2014we cannot tell which\u2014must be\ninaccurate in regard to the important detail of the boy's position\nat the time. If one is inaccurate, both may be. Further, if it\nis only by the accident of there being two accounts that this\ninaccuracy has become manifest, we are entitled to infer that there\nare probably other inaccuracies which happen not to have been\nmanifested.\nTo misplace events in recollection is of course a very common\nerror of memory\u2014so much so that even Mr. Lang would probably\nnot be surprised to find it occurring at once in America, France,\nGermany, England, Russia, and South Uist. It is perhaps almost\nas common as the unfortunate habit of the narrators of \" very\npicturesque\" incidents to be dead, as in the case mentioned in Mr.\nLang's last sentence.\nBut it is just this form of inaccuracy of recollection which\u2014as\nall students of conjuring phenomena know\u2014makes it often impos\nsible to discover from the description of an uninitiated witness how\na trick has been performed.\n\fJUNE, 1906. Cwrespondence. 283\nMr. Grottendieck is obviously a careful and level-headed witness,\nand not given to sensational statements, and probably the long\ninterval of 2J years has affected his memory less than would be\nthe case with the great majority of our Poltergeist observers. Yet\neven with him we find this serious discrepancy in accounts with\nan interval between them of only seventeen days ! I submit, then,\nthat it is impossible to place so much weight on the details of\nthe narrative as Mr. Lang and Mr. Feilding are disposed to do.\nWe can with reasonable confidence infer nothing more than that 2J\nyears ago Mr. Grottendieck did see things which he could not\nexplain, and which we cannot explain from his description.\nWe have, then, no right to assume that Mr. Grottendieck now\nremembers accurately what he really thought at the time he saw.\nAnd this brings us to the second source of error. If he remem\nbers accurately, we have no right to assume that he really saw\nwhat he thought he saw. My answer to Mr. Lang is, that it is lie\nwho is making the unwarrantable assumption, and not I. These\nabnormal movements of objects are like the black stones which Mr.\nGrottendieck kept in his pocket. They are never forthcoming when\nthe expert is there to examine them. But hallucinations are always\nwith us. The very process of perception is itself, as Taine has said,\na kind of hallucination. Many persons experience definite sensory\nhallucinations when they see a conjuring trick\u2014it is part of the\nconjurer's art to induce them.1\nMr. Lang must, I think, have been writing in haste when he\nsays : \"I am unaware that there exists any proof of a condition of\nthe sensory organs which causes people to see things moving, as in\nfact they are not moving, but \" with abnormal slowness ; and again,\nthat this hypothetical explanation of part of Mr. Grottendieck's\nexperience \"is the merest conjecture, devoid of experimental proof.\"\nApart from the common experience in dreams, when hours or even\nyears may seem to be lived through in the course of a few minutes\nor seconds, which can sometimes be demonstrated in the case of\ndreams initiated by some objective noise ; the disturbance of the\nsense of time is one of the most familiar features of all deviations\nfrom normal consciousness, e.g. in trances, spontaneous or hypnotic,\nor as the effect of various drugs. A graphic description of this\u2014the\nresult of an experiment in the effect of Indian Hemp, tried by Mr.\nErnest Dunbar\u2014has lately been given in our Proceedings, Part L.\np. 69, where Mr. Dunbar says that a train journey of 20 minutes\nseemed extended into hours, and when he walked down the platform\nafter it \" there seemed quite an interval of time between the placing\nof my foot on the ground and the realisation of having done so.\"\nMr. Dunbar quotes from Dr. Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine\na description by Dr. Marshall of a similar experience of his with\nthe same drug : \"... I was continually taking out my watch,\nthinking that hours must have passed, whereas only a few minutes\nhad elapsed. ...\" He analyses the psychological effect and states\n'See Jastrow's Fact and Fable in Psychology, p. 117.\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.\nthat the sense of time is also disturbed under ether, chloroform\nand nitrous oxide.\nThere is then a tendency for mental disturbances to take certain\nforms when they are caused by, or occur under, certain circumstances.\nAnd if some of the doings of Poltergeists are to be explained as\nthe result of hallucination, is it really more odd that people all\nover the world should be liable to the same mental affections than\nthat they should be liable to believe the same myths, and invent\nthe same fairy stories 1 FRANK PODMORE.\nDISSOLUTION OF THE AMERICAN BRANCH.\nAFTER full and anxious consideration it has been decided to\ndissolve the American Branch of the Society for Psychical\nResearch at the end of the current year.\nIt is hoped that a scheme, upon which Professor Hyslop\nhas been for some time past engaged, may result in the for\nmation of an independent organization which will carry on\nthe work of psychical research in America.\nThe records of sporadic phenomena now accumulated at the\noffices of the Branch will be carefully gone through, and a\nselection from them will be published in the Journal.\nThe Piper records, and all documents appertaining thereto,\nwill remain in the charge of the Council of the Society ; and\nas promptly as the labour involved in the study of their\nvoluminous and complicated contents will allow, a full report\non the later developments of the Piper case up to the date\nof Dr. Hodgson's death will be issued in the Proceedings.\nAfter publication the Council of the Society will allow\nqualified and serious students access to the records ; but only\non terms which will ensure that all private and intimate\nmatter contained in them shall be handled with proper dis\ncretion and reserve, and that all confidences shall be respected.\nSigned on behalf of the American Branch,\nWILLIAM JAMES \\\nJAMES H.

Balfour, in the\nchair. There were also present : Mr. W. W. Baggally, Pro\nfessor W. F. Barrett, Mr. E. N. Bennett, Mr. G. Lowes\nDickinson, the Hon. Everard Feilding, Mr. J. G. Piddington,\nMr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr. Frank Podmore, Mr. S. C. Scott,\nMrs. H. Sidgwick, Lieut.-Colonel Le M. Taylor, Dr. C. L.\nTuckey, and Miss Alice Johnson, Secretary.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as\ncorrect.\nTwo new Members and six new Associates were elected.\nThe election of four new Associates of the American Branch\nwas recorded. The names and addresses are given above.\nThe monthly account for May was presented.\nMr. Piddington reported that during his visit to Boston\nit had been decided to dissolve the American Branch at the\nend of the present year, and that a circular to this effect\nhad been issued to the members of the Branch, signed by\nProfessor James, Professor Hyslop, Mr. Dorr and himself.\nThis circular had been printed in the June Journal. He\nstated that the Piper records with other material from the\nBranch office were now in the hands of the Society and that\nColonel Taylor had kindly undertaken to make a preliminary\nexamination of the cases of sporadic phenomena collected in\nAmerica.\nHe proposed certain regulations for the transference of\nmembers from the Branch to the Parent Society. The Council\nagreed to these and directed that they should be printed in\nthe Journal.\nThe Council desired to put on record their deep sense of\nobligation to Mr. G. B. Dorr for the invaluable assistance\nwhich he had rendered since Dr. Hodgson's death in the\ndirection of the affairs of the American Branch, and passed\na hearty vote of thanks to him.\nPE1VATE MEETING FOE MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.\nThe 16th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only\nwas held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.,\n\fJULY, 1906. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 287\non Wednesday, July 4th, 1906, at 4 p.m., Mrs. H. Sidgwick\nin the chair.\nMR. J. G. PIDDINGTON read a short paper on \" Richard\nHodgson,\" which it is proposed to publish in Part LIT. of the\nProceedings.\nMK. G. LOWES DICKINSON then read a paper on \" A Case\nillustrating some Phases of Hypnotic Personality,\" describing\ncertain experiments in hypnotisation conducted by Dr. G. The\nsubject hypnotised, Miss C., who is not a professional medium,\ndescribes herself in her trance as leaving her body and going\n\" up \" into other \" planes \" of existence, of which the one most\nconstantly visited is described as the \" Blue.\" These terms,\n\" up,\" \" planes,\" \" blue,\" are, however, said to be metaphors,\nthe real experience being one where there is no time, space,\nor colour, but everything is thoughts. In this world is to be\nfound, it is said, not only everything that has ever happened, or\nwill happen, but all thoughts, dreams, and imaginations. In\none of these planes Miss C. purported to meet a certain lady,\nBlanche Poynings, who lived in the time of Eichard the\nSecond. This lady was described as a friend of the Earl and\nCountess of Salisbury, and a great many details were given\nabout these and other personages of the time, and about the\nmanners and customs of that age. The personages referred\nto, the details given in connection with them, and especially\nthe genealogical data, were found on examination to be correct,\nthough many of them were such as apparently it would not\nhave been easy to ascertain without considerable historical\nresearch. Miss C. had not studied the period, and could not\nrecall reading any book bearing upon it other than a novel\ncalled John Standish, which has been examined and found\nnot to contain the information she had given. Ultimately,\nhowever, the source on which she had unconsciously drawn\nwas discovered through planchette. Miss C., writing with\nplanchette, received communications purporting to come from\nBlanche Poynings, which finally, by a very circuitous route,\nand after much evasion, gave the name of a book by E. Holt\nentitled The Countess Maud, as being the book in which she,\nBlanche, and the other people referred to, would be found.\nMiss C. then remembered that there was such a book, and\nthat it had been read to her, but she could not remember that\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.\nit had anything to do with Blanche Poynings, or with the\nother characters as to whom she had given information. On\nexamination, however, the book proved to contain the whole\nof the personages and facts she had given.\nThe chief interest of this case appears to be that it illustrates\na revival by the subconscious self of memories completely lost\nto the ordinary conscious self. The novel in question had\nbeen read to Miss C. by her aunt in the spring of 1892,\nwhen she was a child of about 11 years old; but both ladies\nhad now so completely forgotten its contents that they could\nnot even recall the period with which it dealt. It is notice\nable also that the facts were reproduced in a quite new\nsetting, as they purported to be given in conversation by the\ndead Blanche Poynings, who is only a subordinate character\nin the novel. Also, they are connected with an elaborate\ncosraological scheme of planes, etc., in a world without space\nor time, the origin of which, in Miss C.'s mind, it is not\neasy to trace.\nMr. V. J. WOOLLEY said that as he had been present at\nall the sittings with which Mr. Dickinson's paper was concerned,\nand as the lady was well known to him, he would like in\nthe first place to assure the Society of his personal conviction\nthat her good faith was quite beyond dispute, and with\nreference to this he wished further to emphasize the point\nthat the experimenters' knowledge of the existence of the\nbook was derived solely from her own automatic writing.\nTo show how completely the book had faded from her\nconscious memory, it was of interest to note that, after the\nname of the book had been given by the planchette, she did\nrecall that such a book had been read to her years before,\nbut had only a vague impression that it dealt with the 17th\ncentury.\nAs regards the phenomena of her trance, her states of\nconsciousness might be grouped into two main divisions, one\nwhich she calls the \" blue plane,\" and others which are said\nto be nearer to the physical world. In connection with this\nconception of \" planes,\" it is to be noted that Miss C. is\nto some extent acquainted with Theosophical theories, as her\nbrothers are interested in them, and she has heard them\ndiscussed.\n\fJOLY, 1906. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 289\nWhen in the \" blue plane,\" she lies back quite passively,\nalways with the left arm in a certain position ; her face is\nquite composed and quiet and she very seldom makes any\nmovement with her hands. In this plane she sees nothing\nhappening. When, however, she has rested in this way for\na certain time, suddenly her face lights up and she exclaims :\n\" Now I'm going to see things,\" meaning that it is her\nintention to do so. She thereupon voluntarily descends\nfrom the \" blue plane \" into some one of the many regions\nwhich are supposed to lie between it arid her waking con\nsciousness, and describes what she meets. Her descriptions\nare dramatically given, sometimes with gestures, and with a\nfull appreciation of the humour of many of the incidents she\ndescribes. On some occasions when she has been asked if\nshe can see the room in which she is lying, she has said\nthat she can see it a long way off, as though through the\nwrong end of a telescope, and she points with her hand in\nthe direction in which she sees this vision ; the direction\nappears to be downwards and slightly in front. There is\nno reason to suppose that the distant picture of the room\nwhich she sees corresponds at all to the actual room or its\ncontents.\nThe speaker had never before found any connection between\nher hypnotic experiences and her automatic writings, which\nare generally exceedingly foolish, but there had been in the\npast some details in common between the latter and her\ncrystal visions, which are quite fantastic and unreal, and\nnever at all veridical, as far as he had heard.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT said that a good many cases more or\nless similar to this were recorded in the old mesmeric journal,\nThe Zoist, and an interesting modern case had recently been\nbrought under his own notice, that of a young engine driver,\nwho had dreamt, or imagined he dreamt, that he had been\npresent at the Battle of Hastings, and gave very detailed and\ncoherent accounts of it, far more detailed than would be found\nin ordinary historical text-books, but afterwards discovered to-\nbe accurate.\nMR. FEILDING remarked that he thought the case described\nby Mr. Dickinson the most interesting that had been brought\nbefore the Society for a long time. It showed many analogies\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.\nwith the case (reported by Professor Flournoy) of Helene\nSmith, who in trance exhibited a number of striking drama\ntisations of personality, with occasional instances of remarkable\nrevivals of memory. In addition to the dramatisations of the\nsubliminal consciousness, and the revival of memories lost\nto the supraliminal self, he thought an important and interesting\npoint in Miss C.'s case was that much of the information\nabout Blanche Poynings had been found to come from the\nAppendix. Dull as was the book itself from all accounts,\nthe Appendix was still more dull, and it was improbable either\nthat a child should have read it willingly herself or even\nthat her aunt should have inflicted it upon her. It would\nseem therefore that a good deal of information must have been\nleft in her mind while she was simply turning over the leaves\nin the process, which she now remembers, of colouring some\nof the illustrations.\nCASE.\nG. 279. Apparition.\nTHE following case was described by Mrs. Verrall at the last\nmeeting of the Society. Her original account here printed\nwas written four days after the incident occurred. The names\nof all the persons and places concerned were given to us in\nconfidence. Mrs. Verrall writes :\nOn Friday [date named] I arrived at A. on a visit to my friends,\nMr. and Mrs. Z., whom I had not visited since they came to\nreside in A. On the following Sunday [date named] I went to\nchurch with Mrs. Z. Just before the service began, i.e. about\n10.55 a.m., as I was taking my seat I suddenly felt a curious\nsensation that something was going to happen, and this sensation\nwas somehow connected with the chancel or east end of the church,\nwhich I faced from my seat. The sensation passed, and the service\nbesjan. Very shortly afterwards, I had a strong impression of the\npresence of a figure standing close to the south-east angle of the\nchancel. This impression persisted throughout the greater part of\nthe service, but the figure had disappeared before the conclusion\nof the sermon. I use the phrase 'impression of a figure' advisedly,\nas I never for a moment took it for an actual person; in fact, my\nvisual impression persisted when I shut my eyes. The details\nwere extremely distinct, and I observed and noted as much as I\n\fJULY, 1906. Case. 291\ncould, with a view to subsequent identification, if possible. The\nfigure was stationary. It did not disappear, but on one occasion,\nwhen I looked for it, so to speak, as I did from time to time, it\nwas not there, and no effort on my part could bring it back.\nOn my return from church I related my impression to Mr. and\nMrs. Z., and my husband. The note made by Mr. Z. from my\ndescription is appended. That description reminded him of a portrait\nof one of two brothers, Mr. C. D. and Mr. E. D., closely connected\nwith the parish, and buried in the churchyard. The D. family\nwas wholly unknown to me, but on the following day, Monday, I\nwas shown engravings of both brothers, and at once identified in\nthe younger brother, Mr. E. D., the original of the figure which\nI had seen in the church. The impression of that figure was\nso vivid that I had felt from the first confident that I should\nrecognise the person if I saw him or his likeness. The age which\nthe figure appeared to be was 40-45, and the age of Mr. E. D. at\nthe time of the engraving was 37. I subsequently saw two paintings,\nrepresenting Mr. E. D. at different periods, and these confirmed\nthe identification, though the ruddy colouring of the face of the\nyounger portrait was unlike the sallow skin of the figure seen by\nme. The latest portrait, however, represented the effect, noted by\nme, of a skin darker than the hair, and in all three pictures the\ncut of hair and beard, as well as the general cast of the features\nand the expression, were well represented. None of the portraits\nrepresented more than the head and shoulders, so that nothing\ncould be learnt from them as to the habitual attitude of Mr. E. D.,\nand in none of them was he shown as wearing the frock coat in\nwhich the figure appeared to me.\nThe result of subsequent enquiries as to the appearance of Mr.\nE. D. is stated in the commentary on my first description kindly\nadded to this account by Mr. Z.\nI need only add that I have never experienced any similar\nimpression. MARGARET DE G. VERRALL.\nMr. Z. writes :\nMrs. Verrall came to us at A. for a short visit on Friday [date\ngiven] in the present year. It was her first visit to this place. On\nthe following Sunday morning, immediately after we returned from\nchurch, she gave to Mrs. Z., Dr. Verrall, and myself the description\ngiven below of a phantom figure which she had seen while in\nchurch. The following notes of her description were taken down\nby me immediately, and no suggestion as to the identity of the\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.\nphantom was made by any of us until the description was com\npleted.\nDescription of phantom figure seen by Mrs. Verrall.\n\" Soon after entering the church felt a strong impression that\nsomething was going to happen. First appearance of visionary\n6gure was shortly after the, service began. The figure was that of\na tall, aristocratic-looking man,\u2014not a soldier or clergyman\u2014-seen\nthree-quarter face, from the left. It was standing near the vestry\ndoor, looking down the church. Had a feeling that it was appro\npriate that he should be where he was ; he seemed to be associated\nwith the locality, not with any person.\n\"The shoulders seemed not to be quite wide enough for the height.\nFace longish, with nothing very distinctive about it : nose longisb,\nskin of face darkish and sallow. Age 40 to 45. Face suggested\nthat of Mr. Q., but was better looking. Wore moustache, beard, and\nwhiskers. Moustache not large ; whiskers short ; beard not long,\nnor very thick, but squarish, and following lines of face. Colour of\nbeard, brown. Hair brown, smooth on head, but standing loose\nround face : might be thick, curly hair, cut rather short.\n\"Figure wore black frock-coat with long skirts, grey trousers, grey\ntie, of silk material, hanging full and loose, plainly visible below\nshort beard. The general appearance was that of a well-groomed\nman. A pince-nez of gold, with curved spring, hung by a cord on\nright side of body.\n\"Eight arm hung loose, ungloved. Left arm was bent at elbow\nacross breast, and held stiffly : the hand was gloved, and held in a\nline with the arm. The impression of this hand and arm was the\nstrongest received.\n\"Had an impression of something red in connexion with him,\u2014\nsomething small. This was not visualised, nor located on the\nperson. The form of the thing was not recognised. Felt that it\nmight be an order which the man was not then wearing.\"\nHere Mrs. Verrall's description ends.\nBefore giving this description, Mrs. Verrall asked whether C. D.,\na person (now deceased) known to her by name as intimately con\nnected with the place, held his left arm in any peculiar fashion.\nI replied that he did not : and she then went on to relate what she\nhad seen. After hearing her description of the figure, I suggested\nthat it might be E. D., a brother of C. D., and also deceased, and\nwhom I have never seen alive. I made the suggestion because the\ndescription recalled, in several particulars, the head and face of an.\n\fJULY, 1906. . Case. 293,\nengraved portrait of E. D. which I had seen in this neighbourhood.\nI may add that Mrs. Verrall had had no opportunity of seeing this\nor any other portrait of E. D. I have none.\nOn the following day I took Mrs. Verrall to see the engraved\nportraits of C. D. and E. D. She at once confidently recognised in\nE. D. the face which she had seen. The portrait was brought into\nmy house, and Mrs. Z., Dr. Verrall, and myself all agreed that the\ndescription of the figure seen might well have been a description of\nthe portrait. Dr. Verrall and myself, who know Mr. Q., saw that it\nwas natural that the face seen by Mrs. Verrall should remind her\nof Mr. Q.\nWithin the next few days I found from inquiries made by Mrs.\nZ. and myself from three persons interviewed at different times,\nand who had often seen E. D. during his lifetime, that it was his.\nhabit to carry his left arm bent at the elbow across the breast. I\nalso discovered that he was a tall, thick-set man, and that h&\nlimped with the left leg, having (as it was believed) broken it\ntwice. I believe that it is common with people who limp with one\nleg to carry the corresponding arm across the body in a position\nsimilar to that seen in the phantom figure.\nI was with Mrs. Verrall when she saw the two portraits in oil,\nand agreed with her that they confirmed the evidence for identifica\ntion.\nE. D. was a civilian and Member of Parliament who died about\n20 years ago, and he must accordingly have sometimes worn a dress-\nof the kind described.\nI am not aware of any reason for connecting the day of his\nappearance\u2014for it seems hardly possible to resist the evidence for\nidentifying him with the figure seen\u2014with any day in which he\nwould have been likely to have a special interest : it was not the\ndate of his birth or death.\nWith regard to the impression of red in connection with the\nfigure, I may perhaps mention that red is conspicuous on the coat\nof arms of the D. family. There is a coloured representation of the\narms in the church, but it is not visible from the seat in which\nMrs. Verrall sat, nor could she have seen it in passing to her seat.\nMrs. Z. and Dr. Verrall sign this statement in corroboration of\nsuch parts of it as concern them.\nX. Y. Z.\nW. V. Z.\n. April, 1906. A- W- VEHKALU\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.\nAdditional note by Mr. Z. on the apparition seen by Mrs. Verrall.\nSince writing the previous note, I have had a talk with the\nwidow of C. D. (She is referred to below as L. D.)\nL. D. of course knew E. D. well. She said he had his left leg\nnearly two inches shorter than the other, and consequently limped ;\nthe injury was at the hip. He had nothing the matter with his\nleft arm, and she had never noticed him carrying it as seen by\nMrs. Verrall ; he habitually walked with his hands in his jacket\npockets. L. D. had never seen E. D. in a frock coat : he wore in\nLondon a cut-away or morning coat : doubtless he had a frock for\nstate occasions,\u2014going to Windsor and the like. He tied his tie in\na bow, except when deer-stalking and shooting generally, when he\ntied it in a sailor's knot, in order that the ends might not blow\nabout. E. D. was slightly bald behind the forelock. (This fact is\nonly just apparent upon a careful examination of the later oil portrait\nseen by us.)\nMrs. Verrall stated to us, but has not recorded the fact in her\nwritten statement, that before she saw the epitaph on E. D.'s grave\n{which was a day or two after she saw the apparition), she had the\nimpression that he was not a believer. This impression, as I gathered\nfrom L. D., appears to be correct. Such an inference might well be\ndrawn from the epitaph.\nP.S. (July, 1906).\u2014Since the statement above was written, I have\nobtained further independent confirmation of the fact that E. D.\ncarried his left arm in the position seen by Mrs. Verrall.\nCOERESPONDENCE.\nMR. GROTTENDIECK'S POLTERGEIST.\nIn regard to the discussion in the last number of the\nJournal, Dr. J. W. Pickering writes :\nMr. Andrew Lang states on p. 278 of the June Journal: \"I\nam unaware that there exists any proof of a condition of the\nsensory organs which causes people, presumably excited, to see\nthings moving as in fact they are not moving, but rather in the\nwavering, swerving, and hovering manner which Mr. Bosanquet\ncommunicates to his slow bowling.\" Mr. F. Podmore, on p. 283,\nstates that the disturbance of the sense of time is one of the most\nfamiliar features of all deviations from normal consciousness and\ncites trances, spontaneous and hypnotic, as well as the action of\nvarious drugs. In each of these instances the psychical condition\n\fJDLY, 1906. Correspondence. 295\nof the percipient is abnormal, and in order to apply this criticism\nto poltergeist phenomena it must be assumed that a similar abnormal\npsychical condition occurs whenever such phenomena are observed.\nIt therefore becomes of interest to consider whether in normal\nconditions of consciousness illusions of movement occur.\nSully,1 writing on the limits of sensibility, states: \"The most\nfamiliar example of such slight errors is that of movement. When\nlooking at objects our ocular muscles are apt to execute slight\nmovements which escape our notice. Hence we tend, under certain\ncircumstances, to carry over the retinal result of the movement, that\nis to say, the impression produced by a shifting of the parts of the\nretinal image to new nervous elements, to the object itself, and\nso to transform a 'subjective' into an 'objective' movement.\"\nProf. S. P. Thompson,2 writing on optical illusions of motion,\nstates : \" These illusions involve the co-operation of some preconception\nor expectation. For example, the apparent movement of a train\nwhen we are watching it and expecting it to move involves both\nthe element of sense impression and of imagination.\"\nIt is possible that the peculiar hovering movement described in\npoltergeist phenomena may be explained by the movements of the\nmuscles of accommodation of the eye. The close watching of the objects\nin transit may tire these muscles with the consequence that their movements\nare accentuated. The result would be the shifting of the retinal\nimage to new nervous elements, and if this occurred to a considerable\nextent, the percipient would describe the motion of the objects as\nhovering and wavering.\nWhilst I am of opinion that these physiological factors should\nnot be lost sight of, I do not wish to urge them as the correct\nexplanation of the observations. It could, however, be a subject for\nexperimentation. JOHN W. PICKERING.\nMr. Grottendieck sends us the following details in answer\nto some enquiries from Mr. E. Westlake as to the geological\ncharacter of the stones, etc., with some comments on Mr.\nPodmore's criticisms of the case, printed in the last Journal.\nHe tells us also that the \" boy \" was about 16 or 17\nyears old.\nThe stones were black and polished and about -| to f inch in size.\nThe biggest one was certainly not more than 1 inch. They were\nnot smooth like pebbles. They were not like volcanic cinders ; not\n1 Sully, Wnzions, p. 50. 2 la Brain, Oct. 1880.\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.\ncrystalline. They were slaty, arranged in layers and looked very\nmuch like anthracite, but the edges were not quite so sharp as pieces\nof anthracite. They were not so heavy as meteoric iron, but more\nlight like anthracite is.\nOn the evening the phenomena occurred, I noticed that they all\nfell down within a certain radius of about 3 feet. Next morning I\nfound them where I had left them myself the night before, and did\nnot find any other stones in the house.\nThe sound of falling on the floor was decidedly much too loud.\nI do not remember with absolute certainty that I threw them\nupwards, although I am inclined to think that I did. But I remember\nthat the sound with which they came down on the floor was also\nslightly different from the ordinary noise. The sound was more\n\" hollow \" (or explosive).\nThe hut was not specially my home, but I knew very well the\nsurrounding jungle. The house (or hut) was situated near a river\n(Meranti-river). In this river there is an immense lot of \" braun-\nkohle,\" so called \" junges pliocan.\" You can just walk over the\nbraunkohle banks, just as in the Kapass-river, but there is decidedly\nno anthracite. As far as I know there is no anthracite on the whole\nisland of Sumatra, but au immense lot of braunkohle. But the stones\nwere not braunkohle. They were much too black and polished for\nthat.\nAs to Mr. Podmore's criticisms, my comments will be put in the\nform of questions and answers :\n(1) Where was the boy when I was climbing up the partition?\nAnswer. I do not know, because I was not clairvoyant and could\nnot look right through a kadjang partition.\n(2) Where was the boy when I had reached the top of the partition ?\nAnswer. He was lying down on the floor, apparently asleep.\nI saw him there directly when I looked over the partition and\nduring the time that I saw the stones coming through the roof.\n(3) What conclusion do I now draw 1\nAnswer. That the boy must have returned from the kitchen\nduring the time that I was climbing up the partition, and that he\nmust have put himself down on the floor again to continue his sleep.\n(4) Would this be probable ]\nAnswer. Certainly it would, because, when you awake a native-\nboy at night, then he will put himself down on the floor again to\ncontinue his sleep, just as soon as he does not see his master any\nmore. \u2022\n\fJULY, 1906. Correspondence. 297\nThere is still another detail which I now remember and which\nshows me also that I could not see him at the moment that I\nclimbed up. It is this : At the moment that I looked over the\npartition and saw the servant, I kept myself up with my right hand\nand searched the roof with my left hand. When you take now into\nconsideration that the stones appeared through the roof somewhere\nabove the door, then there follows as an absolute necessity that I\nmust have climbed up at the right-hand side of the door, which\nmeans behind the open door. So of course I could not see him\ncoming back. (A rough plan of the rooms shows this.)\nThe servant was certainly not fully awake before I shot my five\ncartridges, but I really do not know whether he was \" in trance \"\nor not, because I do not know much about trance. The only thing\nI have ever seen of it is with Mr. B., and he behaves \" like a fool.\"\nThe boy never behaved in that way on that night, but he moved\nabnormally slowly, just as the stones also did. But my own move\nment did not give me the impression of. being slow.\nSo you see that, notwithstanding I have communicated everything\nI remember, I can only come to this conclusion ; and I think the\nfact that I could not of course remember a thing that I could not\nhave seen explains what seemed to be a discrepancy.\nW. G. GROTTENDIECK.\nTHE AMERICAN BRANCH AND THE AMERICAN\nINSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.\nShortly after the announcement of the impending dissolution\nof the American Branch, a circular, of which the opening\nparagraphs are given below, was addressed to its Members and\nAssociates :\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.\nSECTION B.\u2014PSYCHIC RESEARCH.\nTHE members of the American Branch of the Society for Psychical\nResearch understand the irreparable loss which it has suffered in the\ndeath of Dr. Richard Hodgson, and it will not require here any\nother statement to secure appreciation of the fact. It is most\nimportant that his work should be taken up with the hope that\nit may be continued. It will, therefore, be the object of this\ncircular to explain the plan which has been devised to carry out\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOLY, 1906.\nthat purpose. The plan was conceived before his death and it was\nconfidently expected that he would share in its execution. This\nwas fully understood and agreed to by Dr. Hodgson and the parties\norganising the American Institute for Scientific Research. It was\nnot possible to make this public until the funds had been secured\nto assure the plans of the Institute. The death of Dr. Hodgson\ninterrupted the execution of the plan.\nImmediately following Dr. Hodgson's death a conference of some\nof the officers and members of the Society for Psychical Eesearch\nresolved to postpone final action until the whole subject could be\ngone over. It was at last decided as advisable by the Council of\nthe London Society to dissolve the American Branch in deference\nto the plans of the American Institute and to encourage the\norganization of an independent Society in the United States. This\ndoes not preclude some form of harmonious co-operation which it\nis hoped can be effected after the organization of the American\nSociety. To make the whole matter clear it will be necessary to\nexplain the nature and aims of the American Institute for Scientific\nEesearch.\nThe American Institute for Scientific Research has been granted\na perpetual charter by the State of New York. Its primary aim\nis to organize and subsidize investigations in Psychical Research and\nAbnormal Psychology or Psychopathology. The Institute proper\nwill consist merely of a Board of Trustees, who shall act as\ncustodians and disbursers of the endowment funds. They will not\ndirectly supervise investigations of any kind. They will only see\nto it that individual men or bodies of men shall be qualified to\nreceive such aid as the Institute shall see fit to grant in behalf\nof work under its protection. The American Society for Psychical\nResearch, which will be a section of the Institute, will be organized\nas an independent body, with a separate Council, which will have\npower to direct its affairs. The reason for the independent organi\nzation of the Society in this manner is that it is most desirable to\nhave the work of psychic research and psychopathology conducted\nwholly apart from each other, as the fields are more or less distinct.\nThe Institute is merely to protect both fields.\nThe Board of Trustees of the Institute has not been completed,\nand will not be until an endowment is secured. Its present\nmembers are Dr. James J. Putnam, Harvard University ; Dr. Minot\nJ. Savage, New York ; Dr. R. Heber Newton, Easthampton, N. Y. ;\nMr. C. Griswold Bourne, New York ; Mr. Charles N.

HYSLOP, Secretary.\nOn receipt of this circular, Mr. Piddington wrote to Professor\nHyslop the following letter, which we print here in order\nto forestall some possible misapprehensions :\n18 COMMONWEALTH AVENUE,\nBOSTON, June 2nd, 1906.\nDEAR PROFESSOR HYSLOP,\nI am much obliged to you for sending me a copy of\nyour circular. It contains, however, two sentences, in the second\nparagraph, to which I must take exception, for they seem to me to\nconvey a wrong impression of the actual facts.\nIt is not in any sense correct to say that the Council decided to\ndissolve the Branch \" in deference to the plans of the American\nInstitute and to encourage the organization of an independent\nSociety in the United States.\" In the first place the Council\ndecided nothing\u2014 the decision was left to me ; and I thought it\nadvisable to dissolve the Branch for the two following reasons\nonly: (1) because no suitable successor to Dr. Hodgson was in sight,\n(2) because it is desirable to lighten as far as possible the routine\nwork in England. What is true is that the knowledge that the\ndissolution of the Branch would not, in view of your scheme,\nnecessarily involve the abandonment of Psychical Research in\nAmerica, removed the one great objection to the policy of dissolution.\nThe word \" encourage \" in its immediate context is likewise mis\nleading. With all my heart I wish your scheme every success, and\nso, I am sure, do all my colleagues ; but I should have preferred to\ndescribe our attitude toward your Institute as one of benevolent\nneutrality, and the distinction between this benevolent neutrality\nand the pfficial endorsement of your scheme which the use of the\nword \" encourage \" suggests, if it does not imply, should not be\noverlooked.\nIf, as your Circular states, the Council dissolved the Branch in\ndeference to the plans of the American Institute, the members and\nassociates of the Branch would have a just cause of complaint, for\nthey might well ask why we should abandon an organization, which,\nthough perhaps not over-energetic, had at least managed to keep on\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JULY, 1906.\nits legs for a good many years, simply in order to leave the field\nclear for the development of a new organization still in embryo,\nhowever vigorous its antenatal promise might be.\nI propose, accordingly, with your permission, to insert your circular,\nand in any case this letter or the substance of it, in the S.P.R.\nJournal.\u2014Yours sincerely, J. G. PIDDINGTON.\nNOTICE TO MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN BRANCH,\nMEMBERS and Associates of the American Branch who desire\nto become Members or Associates of the English Society after\nthe dissolution of the Branch, must send in applications to\nthat effect to Miss Edmunds, Acting Secretary of the Branch,\n5 Boylston Place, Boston, Mass., by December 1st, 1906.\nThese applications will not be entertained unless all subscrip\ntions due to the Branch up to the end of 1906 have been\npaid ; neither will they be entertained if sent direct to the\nSecretary of the Society for Psychical Research, 20 Hanover\nSquare, London, W.

Simultaneous.\nIN the following case, four persons, all in different places,\nexperience independently in the course of about twelve hours\nvarious impressions relating to a certain deceased person. Her\nsister, Mrs. A., sees an apparition of her on the afternoon\nof March 25th, 1906 ; Mrs. F., her mother, has a vivid\nimpression of her presence on the same evening ; a friend,\nMr. M., has a realistic dream of her during the night, March\n2 5th-2 6th; and her aunt, Miss P., sees an apparition of her\nearly in the morning of March 26th.\nIt is obvious that no one of these impressions by itself\ncould be regarded as evidential of the agency of the deceased\nperson, but the fact of their all occurring together within so\nshort a period is certainly noteworthy. We have few, if any,\ncases parallel to this in our records. Mr. Myers gives a few\ncases of apparitions of dead persons seen collectively by two or\nmore percipients at once in Human Personality, Vol. II., pp. 62\nand 375, and also one case, that of Baron von Driesen (op. dt.,\np. 40), where the apparition is seen on the same night by two\npersons in different places, and a second, that of Mrs. Grans\n(op. tit, p. 374), where one percipient has a vision corre\nsponding to a dream of the other's.\nOne of the percipients in the present case, Mr. M., who is a\nMember of the Society and well known to the Editor, brought\nhis account to her on April 23rd and discussed it fully in\nconversation. Mrs. F. also called on her on May 15th, and\nkindly gave all possible information in answer to questions.\nFrom both these interviews the Editor gathered that the inci\ndents related were of a unique character in the experience of\nthe percipients, and more impressive than might perhaps be\nsupposed from their written statements. In connection with\nthe question whether the dream and apparitions might not have\nbeen due to telepathy from one percipient to the other, rather\nthan to' the agency of the deceased person, the vision of\nMiss P. on March 19th is of interest, as there seems reason\nfor connecting it with the unexpressed desire of Mr. M. that\nshe should have such a vision.\nThe witnesses, whose names and addresses are in our\n\fOCT., 1906. Cases. 303\npossession, wish initials only to be printed. We give\nfirst an account by Mr. M. written within a few days of the\noccurrence : A ., , . , \u201e\u201e.,\nApnl 1st, 1906.\nI write the following and appended statement of my dream,\nbecause of an apparent coincidence concerning it and what has\nbeen mentioned to me by Mrs. F. since my telling it to her on\nlast Monday (March 26th).\nMrs. F. told me on 30th ult. that (a) her daughter, Mrs. A.,\nhad recently, while reclining on a sofa, seen her sister L., who\npassed away in November last, and that (b) she herself (Mrs. F.) had\nfelt L. was with her on March 25th about 8.30 p.m. She also\nmentioned that (c) her sister, Miss P., had seen L. in a kind of\nvision when travelling. This would be on March 19th. Mrs. F.\ntold me of (a), (b), (c) for the first time on 30th ult., and said\nthat she had been impressed by the coincidences. I have asked\nher to obtain statements from Mrs. A. and Miss P., and to write\na statement herself.\nIn reference to Miss P. seeing the vision, it is to be noted I\nhave not heard clear details of this, and that I have experienced\nwhile in the train a remarkable vision of my friend L. Mrs. F.\nand I were on March 19th seeing Miss P. off to Scotland, and a\nlittle later I was hoping she would have a pleasant journey and\nthat L. would be able to give her the experience I got, or that she\nmight have it even as a corroboration of telepathy from (e.g.) me.\nStatement about Dream.\nAbout a week or 10 days ago [Mem. April 23\/06.\u2014I have every\nreason to believe that the night of my dream referred to was that of\nSunday, March 25\/06] I dreamt that I was in a sort of cellar with\nother people, Mrs. F. being near me on my right. At my right\nfront was somewhat like the corner of a brick wall. There were\nbricks in the structure of the cellar. This wall ran directly into\nthe background, but on the right there was space communicating\nwith where I was. I seemed to be at a spiritualist seance. A\nform appeared in front of me\u2014I was facing to the background\u2014\nbut slightly to my right. As it became definite I said, \"Why,\nit's L. !\" She replied in a joyous lively way, \"Of course it is.\"\nShe seemed absolutely natural, and the picture of health. The\ncomplexion was of the pink of health. I made an exclamation\nand my voice partly woke [me up, and I knew that I was in bed.\nThen I made some remark asking her to show herself to her mother.\n\f\u2022304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1906.\n(I think I said, \"Tell your mother.\") Then I thought her mother\nmust see. (As I write now I believe L. said to this request, \"No,\nyou,\" but I am not certain.) I think there was pink about her\ndress. I noticed\u2014or remember\u2014the right shoulder specially : the\ndress was loose.\nThe following report by the Editor of her interview with\nMr. M. was sent to him for revision and endorsement, and is\nprinted here as amended by him.\nApril 26th, 1906.\nMr. M. called on me on April 23rd and gave me verbally a some\nwhat fuller account of the incidents described above. The young\nlady of whom he dreamt, and whom he calls here \"L.,\" had died\nlast November, at the age of about 18; she and all her family were\nvery intimate friends of his. Not long after her death, while\ntravelling and dozing with his eyes shut in the railway carriage, he\nsaw her face in a sort of mind's-eye vision. It appeared perfectly\ndistinct and life-like, and seemed to smile and look at him. The\nsight startled him into complete wakefulness, and the vision im\npressed him a good deal, because it seemed to him quite unique\nin his experience.1 He is normally not at all a good visualiser of\nfaces ; but has had many vivid dreams at different times\u2014sometimes\nas vivid as reality.\nHe mentioned this incident to Mrs. F., L.'s mother, but he\nbelieved that the rest of the family did not know of it. On March\n19th last, he and Mrs. F. were at the station, seeing her sister,\nMiss P., off for Scotland, and, remembering his own experience, he\nhoped that a similar one might occur to her on the journey. This\nwish was, of course, only expressed mentally ; he said nothing about\nit either to Miss P. or to Mrs. F., and did not hear till some time\nlater from Mrs. F. that it had been fulfilled.\nIt was on the night of Sunday, March 25th, 1906, that his\ndream took place. He himself has no doubt that this was the date,\nthough, from a desire to be scrupulously accurate in his statement,\nhe wrote on April 1st that it happened \" about a week or ten days\nago.\" He went the next day, Monday, to call on Mrs. F., and told\nher on that day of his dream. Mrs. F. states that on the following\nmorning (Tuesday), she heard from her sister of her experience on\nJNote by Mr. M.\u2014After my at first becoming wakeful, I at once closed my\neyes, and saw the presentment several times, gradually at last more and more\nfaintly, and when I finally woke up I was quite dazed. It is as though it\nhad been from a very, very deep sleep.\n\fOCT., 1906. Cases. 305\nthe Monday morning (March 26th) between 2 and 3 a.m. and on\nthe same evening (Tuesday) heard from her daughter that she had\nseen L. on the Sunday afternoon. She also states that she herself\nhad felt L.'s presence on the Sunday evening. It thus appears that,\nbesides the less definite impression of Mrs. F., three persons had\nhad a vision or dream of L. within twelve hours of one another,\neach having recorded or told it before knowing of the experience of\nthe others.\nIn Mr. M.'s dream he appeared to be in a sort of cellar or\nunderground room with a number of other persons, of whom Mrs. F.\nwas one, at a se'ance. (He is accustomed to attend seances, but is\nnot a spiritualist.) At his right front there was something like a\ncorner of two walls J at right angles to each other, the direction of\none of them being straight away into the background, and the\nother away towards the right. It was immediately in front of\nhim that the form of L. appeared. The form was extremely vivid\nand life-like. He spoke to it, and the sound of his voice woke\nhim up sufficiently to realise that he was sitting up in bod. He\nlay back, however, and at once succeeded in going to sleep again\nand continuing the dream. He saw L. again and again she seemed\nperfectly real and life-like. She smiled, and he heard her speak.\nShe moved her hands about as if to indicate something\u2014he did\nnot know what; but after hearing of the experiences of his friends\nhe interpreted this movement to mean that she was trying to draw\nhis attention to her dress\u2014a topic on which he is habitually in\nobservant\u2014as a further mark of identity.\nMr. M. was at the time, before hearing of any coincidence with\nthis dream, strongly impressed with its exceptional character. It\nseemed to carry with it, as to L., a clear sense of reality, involving\nthe absolute conviction that it was L. herself that he saw.\nALICE JOHNSON.\nMrs. F. writes :\nApril 20th, 1906.\nI enclose [three] different statements which, I think, are very re\nmarkable, as they all seemed to occur more or less about the same\ndate and all in different places. First of all, on the Monday after\nhe said it occurred, Mr. M. told me of his vision. Next morning I\nheard from my sister, and same evening I received a letter from\nmy daughter describing her feelings when she thought she had seen\n1 Note by Mr. M.\u2014I did not see these walls clearly\u2014only inferred them.\nThe corner I did see.\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I myself felt her presence, but did not see anything, on\nthe Sunday evening as per my appended note.\nThe following were the statements enclosed :\n(1) From Mrs. F.\nOn Sunday evening, March 25th, about 8.30, I was sitting alone.\nI saw my daughter's photograph (who passed away in November).\nI felt her presence but did not see anything.\nI wrote the above on April 8th, 1906.\n(2) From Miss P.\nOn Monday morning, 26th March, between one and two o'clock,\nI saw L. in her grey dress trimmed scarlet. She smiled and was\ngone. The first time was going home, March 19th. Some time in\nthe afternoon, before getting to Leeds, I was sitting with closed\neyes. She was in navy dress ; she gave one of her laughs ; I was\nstartled, opened my [eyes] and she was gone. You remember I was\nalone, the day Mr. M. and you left me at St. Pancras; I had the\ncarriage alone till I got to Hawick.\n[Mrs. F. adds:]\nThis letter was received by me from my sister on April 5th in\nresponse to a request by me that she would make a written state\nment of her dream.\n(3) From Mrs. A.\nApril 18th, 1906.\nI was lying on the sofa resting one Sunday afternoon, March\n25th, when I seemed to see L. come into the room. She put her\nhead between the curtains with such a roguish smile on her face,\nand then came striding in and sat down on a chair with her hands\non her knees in quite her old natural way. I was quite wide\nawake, which made it seem all the more forcible, and really I felt\nher presence so much that I sat up to speak to her. Immediately\nafterwards I went to my bedroom and she was with me. Often\nwhen I am alone she seems to be with me.\nIn reply to our enquiries, further statements were received\nfrom Mrs. F., Miss P., and Mrs. A. as follows :\n(1) From Mrs. F.\nApril 28th, 1906.\nI am sorry to say I have not kept the letters [from my sister and\ndaughter] referred to. It was on Monday afternoon, March 26th,\nMr. M. told me of his dream. I remember so well he said, \"last\n\fOCT., 1906. Cases. 307\nnight I saw L. and she seemed so happy,\" etc. Yes, Mr. M. told\nme of his vision he had while in a train. I never mentioned it\nto any one. It was after I told him of my sister's vision while\nin the train that he told me, when he said good-bye to her, that\nhe hoped she would have a similar one. No, my sister could not\nhave heard of his. . . .\n(2) From Miss P., written on May 13th, 1906.\nOn March 19th I was travelling to Scotland. I was alone in the\ncarriage some time between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.\nI closed my eyes for some time. While doing so L. appeared to\nme. She wore her navy blue and looked just as she used to do.\nShe laughed, looked bright, and disappeared. A week later, on\nMarch 26th, between one and two in the morning, I saw her again.\nShe was in grey with scarlet. She just looked at me in her old\nway. I was awake but lying on my bed. I did not know [Mrs. A.]\nand Mr. M. had also visions of her.\n(3) From Mrs. A.\nMay 8th, 1906.\nI will answer your questions just as you have asked them :\n1. I was not asleep when I saw L. and my eyes were open.\n2. The figure looked just like a real person\u2014just the image of\nL. in health, laughing and happy, with such a bright look in the\neyes.\n3. When I sat up to sort of look, or rather speak, she simply\nwent.\n4. She was, as far as I remember, in navy blue.\n5. When I went to my room I only meant that I felt a continued\nsense of her presence.\nIt is strange that Auntie, you, and I should have had the same\nexperience at the same time. It made a great impression on me\nat the time. . . .\nL. 1152. Visions.\nTHE following cases were obtained from Mrs. D. by Mr. J. G.\nPiddington, who saw the original letters referred to and him\nself copied them and talked over the incidents with Mrs. D.\nThe full names and addresses of all the persons concerned\nwere given to us with the request to print only initials.\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research OCT., 1906.\nVerbatim copy by J. G. P. of note written by Mrs. D. on\nSaturday, January 11th, 1900.\n\"Saturday, January 27th, 1900. This afternoon while I was\nsitting near the fire talking to L., I was holding a small\nphoto, of Mrs. H. and describing her. 'Where is she now?' asked\nL. ' In Rome,' I answered, ' settled for the winter.' And as 1\nspoke, suddenly I felt conscious of what she might be doing at the\ntime. 'Do you know,' I went on, 'I think she must be just\ncoming out of her room on to a high terrace such as we have\nhere, only that there is green over it.' L. did not say 'non\nsense,' but just asked quietly: 'What is she wearing?' 'A black\nskirt,' I answered, 'and a mauve blouse\u2014she is looking out over\nmany roofs and spires\u2014and now she has gone back into the room\nand a maid is closing the shutters.' 'Can you see her room?'\nasked L. 'I think it is small;' I said, 'there is a cottage-piano\nand a writing-table near it. I think the large head of Hermes\nstands on it and something silver.' And then I felt nothing more\nand added, 'What nonsense I have been talking.' L. thinks\nthere may be some truth in the impression and wants me to write\nand ask Mrs. H. what she remembers of this afternoon. It\nwas about six o'clock.\n\"I cannot say I saw anything; somehow I seemed to feel her sur\nroundings were just so. I have never been to Rome, nor has she\ntold me anything of where she lives beyond the address.\"\nCopy of extracts, selected by J. G. P. from a letter addressed by\nMrs. H. to Mrs. D. Postmark of envelope: \"6 2 00 Roma.\"\nFebruary 5th, 1900.\n\" Two days ago, as I was dressing in the morning, I was\nthinking of you. You had been so much in my thoughts for some\ndays that I had really worried, wondering if you were still ill,\nor E. again. That morning as I awoke, thoughts of you came,\nand I determined to write you as soon as I had had my coffee.\nImagine my surprise and delight, therefore, to receive your letter,\na letter so full of interest to me, that I have had no rest since\nits arrival, in my great desire to answer it. I have really had no\nmoment to call my own. The two days since it came seem like\ntwo weeks to me, for when one desires to do anything very much,\nthe time seems long, doesn't it ? [The writer then explains at\nlength why she had been prevented from writing for two days.] . . .\n\" You have certainly, however, filled much of my thoughts these\nday[s],\u2014and I have felt you in an extraordinary manner. You\n\fOCT., 1906. Cases. 309\ncertainly have a power to visit your friends, and to see them, and\nto make them feel you. Your letter is absolutely startling and\nmysterious. And now I can answer it detail for detail, and item\nfor item. [The writer then avows her belief in telepathy and\nclairvoyance.] . . . That you have peeped at me in my small\nRoman house is certainly a fact. As you state the facts, every\nsmall detail is not altogether exact, but the facts as a whole are\ntrue and exact and perfect, as you shall see. Your vision (if I\nmay call it so) is so true and marvellous that on Sunday last, the\n4th, about 3 p.m. (that was yesterday) as I was looking from my\nwindow in the salon with Mr. S., watching a great funeral of\none of Rome's best-loved Cardinals, I related your glimpse into\nmy house, and I could not help exclaiming : ' perhaps Madame\nD. sees us now ... as we are standing here in our window.'\n\"Let me begin by answering bit by bit all you say. I have a\ndear little vine-covered terrace, looking out into the Piazza di\nSpagna, and looking also right up to the spires or rather towers\nof S. Trinita dei Monti, with the great obelisk in front. The after\nnoon of Jan. 27th I returned to my home, after a walk and [after]\nmaking a few purchases, at 5 p.m. I took off my fur jacquette,\nand went at once into my dining-room to see about the dinner-table,\nas three friends came [or, 'come'] at 7 p.m. to dine. I busied\nmyself about the table for some time, then stepped on to the\nterrace (which is so pretty, but opens, unfortunately, from the\nkitchen). I went into the terrace at that time to see about our\ndessert for dinner, which I had put there to become cool. Then I\nwent back into the dining-room, and as the hanging-lamp had just\nbeen lighted, I ordered the maid to drop the outside curtains. She\ndid so. I remember that I looked just then at the clock, and it\nwas 5.35 p.m. \u2022! had on a black skirt, a black silk blouse, and a\nmauve tie, which twisted about my neck and hung in two ends to\nmy waist. It looked to you like a mauve blouse. Then I went\ninto our small salon and took something from the table. I remem\nber it distinctly. Our salon is very small ; there is an upright\npiano and a writing-table, on which are photos and books too, and a\nlot of little silver things. Hermes (your photo to me) stands very\nnear, on another little table, quite near in fact. It is all quite\nmysterious. I believe you have really peeped into my house.\" . . .\n[The letter concludes with a detailed description of how the writer\nspends her day ; the description being given in response to a request\nfrom Mrs. D. In the course of it occur the following phrases] :\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I had never counted it, and yet you\nare perfectly right, it was just five days, and made up of bits of\ntime together and a few conversations.

They had spent only 6 days\ntogether at an hotel, and had since corresponded. Mrs. D. knew\nMrs. H. was a widow. When she had last seen her, Mrs. H. was\nin 'slight mourning,' white and black, Mrs. D. thinks. She does\nnot remember to have seen her wearing mauve and black, or mauve\nat all.

I after[wards] forgot all about it, but when I heard\nyou had had labour pains on that identical night, I am sure every\nthing happened just as I saw it, and that when I went to sleep,\nso did you. Is it so ? Tell me exactly what you did : if you were\nup, and if you sat on a rocking-chair and lay on the sofa, and if\nyou slept at intervals. Lately, too, I have been very very nervous,\nand that may account for it, but see you I did as distinctly as\npossible.\n. . . I hope we shall soon have news about you, as I am very\nanxious to hear particulars. . . .\"\n[On May 1, 1905, Mrs. D. told J. G. P. her sister knew of her\napproaching confinement.

In all respects Mrs. C.'s hallucination\ncorresponded with the real facts.]\nMr. Piddington adds :\nMrs. D. is a quite first-class witness ; a sensible, clear-headed woman,\nand most careful not to overstate things. She has \"clear\" dreams\nlike those described by Dr. van Eeden,1 of which she has for many\nyears kept a careful record, made in nearly every, if not in every,\ninstance the day after the dream. These records I have read, and\nthey give one the same favourable impression of her sincerity and\nhonesty and exactness as does her conversation. The dreams are\nremarkable rather for their lifelike character, in which they are\nquite distinct from her ordinary dreams, than for their veridicality,\nbut some are veridical, though not evidentially strong. In these\ndreams she has long and perfectly rational conversations with dead\nfriends and relations, whom in her dream she knows to be dead.\n'See Proceedings S.P.K., Vol. xvii., pp. 86 and 112.\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Dream.\nTHE following case of a premonitory dream recorded 19 days\nafter its occurrence was obtained from Mr. E. J. Bowring,\nof Westcroft, Lovelace Road, Ditton Hill, Surrey. Mr. Piddington\ncalled on Mr. and Mrs. Bowring on February llth, 1906,\nand wrote the accounts, which were to a great extent given\nindependently, from their dictation, the accounts being after\nwards signed by them.\nMr. Bowring states :\nFebruary llth, 1906.\nIn the night of 23-24 January, 1906, I dreamt a vivid dream\nthat my wife's goldfinch lay stretched on the water with the wings\noutspread. I was in the act of opening the door of the aviary in\nthe hope of saving it, and I had just got hold of it when I awoke.\nI related the circumstance to my wife the same morning before\ngetting up.\nThis dream differed from others which I frequently have, inasmuch\nas it was not connected with any other incident. It was a single\nincident standing out by itself.\nEDWD. J. BOWRING.\nMrs. Bowring states :\nFebruary llth, 1906.\nOn the morning of January 24, my husband said to me on\nwaking \" I have had a very vivid dream about your goldfinch.\nI saw him lying dead in the pond with the wings out.\" On\ngoing downstairs into the conservatory, as usual, I naturally looked\nanxiously at the pond, and was agreeably surprised to find that all\nwas well.\nAlthough relieved, I did not feel reassured ; and so the next\nmorning was not at all surprised, on going into the conservatory,\nto see the bird lying dead. The bird was lying dead in the little\npond with his wings outstretched. Other birds of mine which have\n\fOCT., 1906. Cases. 313\ndied have died with the wings closed ; though others have fallen\ndead near the pond.\nI have ten or eleven in my aviary, but only one goldfinch. The\ngoldfinch was a special favourite. There had been no conversation\nnor incident which, so far as I can trace, could have suggested the\ndream. To the best of my belief the bird was in good health.\nHe had made a complete recovery from his autumn moulting.\nFLORINE BOWRING.\nTHE CUEE OF WAETS BY SUGGESTION.\nFKOM time to time we have printed in the Journal cases of\nthe apparent curing of warts by suggestion,1 and we would\nremind our readers that this is a subject on which some of\nthem may have opportunities of experimenting, or of getting\nexperiments tried under proper supervision. We give here\ntwo cases of recent occurrence. A member of the Society,\nMr. L. C. Powles, writes as follows :\nFebruary 26th, [1905].\n... A friend of mine (Mrs. Barry) tells me that she succeeded\nin charming away the warts from the hand of the lady superintendent\nof an asylum, the latter having for years been unavailingly operated\nupon by the doctors there.\nIt seems a good case, as neither of them had any faith in the\ncure, though Mrs. Barry had once seen a successful instance of it,\nand merely followed the formula of that case\u2014I think it was to\nbury a needle secretly and the warts were to disappear in six\nweeks. It seems they began to die away at once, and in eight\nweeks were permanently cured. It occurred 1-^ years ago.\nMrs. Barry has written out her statement, and says she has no\ndoubt the lady superintendent will give full corroboration.\nThe two letters written at the time of cure by the latter have\nbeen kept, but are at present stored. L. C. POWLES.\nIn reply to our request for further evidence, Mr. Powles\nkindly obtained for us statements from the two ladies con\ncerned, which were enclosed in a letter from himself dated\nMarch 27th, 1905. Mrs. Barry wrote:\nIn the summer of 1903 I was staying in a country house in\nBerkshire. Amongst the guests was a Miss B., the lady super-\n1 See especially Journal, Vol. viii. pp. 7 and 226 ; Vol. ix. pp. 100 and 22.) ;\nand Vol. xi. p. 273.\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1906.\nintendent of a home for high-class patients in connection with a\nlarge private asylum. I noticed that her hands were covered with\nwarts, and one day she told me that they were a great worry to\nher, and had been for two years. All the doctors at the asylum,\nshe said, had tried one after the other to cure them, and she had\ntried many remedies, and been through a good deal of suffering,\nbut in vain ; the warts were immoveable.\nI had previously been telling my hostess a curious case I had\nlately heard of some warts being \" charmed \" away, and she was\nso much impressed that she begged me to try myself, and see if\nI could not \" charm \" her guest's warts. At first I only laughed\nat the idea, and said it was most unlikely I possessed any such\npower, and treated it all as a joke ; but the day on which Miss\nB. was to end her visit, my hostess once more begged me at all\nevents to try.\nJust to put an end to the matter, and more in fun than anything\nelse, I gave Miss B. a needle in a piece of paper, repeating\nthe formula that I had heard when I was told of the cure that\nhad aroused my hostess's interest. I said\u2014\" Take this needle, and\nkeep it safely ; do not break it, do not lose it ; do not mention it\nto any one.\" She put it away in her purse, saying, \"How long\ndo you give me before they go 1 \" \" Six weeks,\" I said\u2014just because\nI had to mention some time ; not that I had any idea that the\nwarts would disappear at all.\nI had forgotten all about the matter, when two months after\nwards Miss B. wrote to me, saying she did not know how to\nthank me enough for having cured her. She had waited until\nthe complete disappearance of the warts before writing, so as to\nbe able to tell me that they were entirely gone. They had begun\nto die away soon after she saw me.\nI told a young doctor about this surprising letter, and he said\nhe thought I ought not to claim the cure until I knew what other\ninfluences might have been at work, and furnished me with a list\nof searching questions : Had there been any fresh water supply to\nher house 1 Had she been away for change of air, and become\nstrengthened ? Had she used a different kind of soap ? Had she\ntaken any medicines or tried any remedies after seeing me ; and\nso on. She wrote back a very full reply in answer to all these\nquestions, and the answer to each one was absolutely satisfactory ;\nno circumstances had arisen to point to any other possible source\nof cure.\n\fOCT., 1906.

ELLEN MONTAGUE BARRY.\nMiss Barrett's statement was as follows :\nMarch llth, 1905.\nI have heard from Mrs. Barry that you would like my account\nof the wonderful way in which my warts have disappeared.\nIn the spring of 1901 I had one wart on the back of my left\nhand which I tried to burn off with many different acids, all to\nno purpose; instead of the one being cured they came thick over\nthe backs of both hands and were a source of great annoyance.\nI tried all manner of things for about 12 months, all warranted\nabsolute cures, with no result except that they seemed to get bigger.\nThen I gave up in despair and left them absolutely alone.\nIn the summer of 1903 I met Mrs. Barry and she offered to\ncharm them away, saying she had never done such a thing before,\nbut had heard of it (or seen it done, I forget which). I think we\nboth took the whole thing as a joke. However, she performed\nthe charm, and within two months there was not a wart on either\nhand, nor have I had one since. She did not touch them in any\nway, but one of the conditions was not to tell any one what she\nhad said or done.\nI cannot get you any statement from the medical officers of the\ninstitution, as the one then in attendance on the staff has left and\ngone abroad.\nOn account of Mrs. Barry's being abroad, she was unable\nto procure for us Miss Barrett's letters, written to her at the\ntime of the cure ; and the lady in whose house the experiment\nwas made declined to give us any statement about it. No\nfurther evidence therefore has been obtainable.\nThe second case came from an Honorary Associate of the\nSociety, Mr. J. F. Young of Llanelly, who wrote :\nBRYNTESOG VILLA, NEW ROAD, LLANELLY,\nAugust Hth, 1904.\nI have an interesting case of the \" charming away \" of warts, of\nwhich I will send you a full report if you think it will be of\nsufficient interest to your Society.\nIn short it is this. At a certain establishment in this town where\nseveral young ladies are employed, most of whom are troubled with\nwarts, I suggested that I should take the worst case and charm\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I called\nagain in a fortnight, and to my surprise they had all vanished. . .\nFurther information was given in later letters from Mr.\nYoung, as follows:\nAugust, 29th, 1904.\nMrs. Mary Jane Roberts, of Pottery Street, Llanelly, has a daughter\nabout 14 years of age, employed by the \"Domestic Bazaar Co.,\nLlanelly.\" Her hands were covered with warts of various sizes,\nsome in groups. She has suffered from them this last 12 months,\nand various remedies have been tried without success.\nKnowing the young lady, and after reading the case of \"wart\ncharming\" in the July number of Journal of the S.P.E., I re\nquested her to let me charm them away, to which she willingly\nconsented, with the result already made known to you. She had\n41 on both hands. There is no sign up to date of any reappearance.\nJ. F. YOUNG.\nSeptember Uth [1904].\nRe warts. I now reply to your several queries.\nThe suggestion was first made to me that I should charm them,\nand carried out, on July 29th. I told her then that they would\ndisappear in 11 days. I called on August 13th, and found they\nwere entirely gone.\nAs to method of charming, I looked at warts intently, both hands\nbeing spread out, willing all the time that they should go away,\nand 11 days came to my mind.\nHaving practised mesmerism and hypnotism for 45 years, the\nfaculty of willing has been educated, and I thought its use in this\ncase would be the most effective.

Apparition.\nTHE following account was received by Mrs. Sidgwick from a\nlady who has been intimately known to her all her life.\nFictitious initials are substituted for the real names, all of\nwhich are in our possession. The account was enclosed in a\nletter to Mrs. Sidgwick, dated March 7th, 1905. The per\ncipient, Miss K., was in London at the time of her vision, the\nperson whose apparition was seen being in a remote country\ndistrict on an estate belonging to Miss E.'s brother.\nMarch 7th, 1905.\nOn the night of Saturday, March 4th, or rather, early morning\nof March 5th [1905] I awoke and sat up to reach for something on\nthe table beside my bed. The room was not dark, as the curtains\nwere drawn back, and the blinds were up, and there are some strong\nlights in the street outside. As I sat up all seemed dark except\nthat I saw a face for a second, and the same face a little further to\nthe right and a little lower down, also for a second. I am not sure\nwhether I saw the two faces (which were exactly the same) at the\nsame moment or one just after the other, but I think the sight\nof them overlapped. The faces were of Mrs. J. W., who lives at the\nvillage at home. I only saw her head, all else being swallowed in\ndarkness. I noticed her black cap, without any white, which she\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.\nalways wears. Her face was not strongly illuminated, and wore\nher usual expression. There was no appearance of life or action\nabout it.\nI was sufficiently struck by this to say to myself that I would\nwrite to you next morning about it, so that if there was any\ncoincidence about it you would have evidence beforehand. I alsa\nturned over to the other side of my bed, took up the watch standing\nthere and noticed the time by it was 4.19 a.m. As this watch was\n5 minutes fast by \"Big Ben,\" the real time must have been just\n4.14 a.m. Unluckily when I woke next morning the whole thing\nwent clean out of my recollection, and I never thought of it again\ntill this morning (March 7th), when I received a letter from Mrs. N.\n[wife of the clergyman at Miss R.'s country home], dated March\n6th, who among other things wrote as follows :\n\"Poor old J. W. at the village died yesterday morning early.\nHe has been ill for a long time.\" (She then goes on to speak of a\nnurse having been sent to him.)\nWhen I got Mrs. N.'s letter this morning (7th), I could not\nremember whether the face I had seen was on the night of Saturday\n4th (morning of 5th) or on the night of Sunday 5th (morning of\nMonday 6th). I am, however, now pretty confident it was the\nformer, for this reason.\nOn Friday evening 3rd, I had a committee here, and they said\nmy clocks were all wrong. I replied that I had never ' heard Big\nBen strike all the time I had been ill, so did not know the time\nwhen I set the clocks going again. Next night I did hear Big Ben,\nand noticed this because of the conversation the night before.\nWhen I heard it I looked at the watch beside my bed and noticed\nthat it was 5 minutes fast.\nJ. W. had been ill some time before I left home (I left on\nFebruary 8th), but for some time before I left he had been much\nbetter, and was I believe out of bed every day. I had heard nothing\nof the W.'s since leaving home, and had no idea that he had been\nill again. The only moment that I am aware of when the W.'s\nwere in my mind was several days ago, when I was putting away\nmy 1904 bills and noticed Mrs. W.'s bill for sweets for the school\nchildren among them.\nMrs. N.'s letter containing the sentence quoted above was\nenclosed with this account. Miss R. in replying to it sent\nMrs. N. on March 9th, 1905, the following questions, without\ntelling her till afterwards why she asked them.\n\fNov., 1906. Cases. 319\n(1) What was the exact hour and minute at which J. W. died?\n(2) Did either J. W. or Mrs. W. say anything during the few\nhours, just before or just after his death, which showed that they\nwere thinking of me, or of themselves in relation to me 1\n(3) If so, what was said, and by whom 1\n(4) At what time was it said?\n(5) Does Mrs. W. recollect thinking of me during those hours, or\nwas I at all in her thoughts ?\n(6) If yes, what were her thoughts in regard to me ?\n(7) At what time was she thinking of me ?\nThe following is Mrs. N.'s reply.\nMarch 2lst, 1905.\n... I have asked Mrs. D. W.,1 who is a great deal with\nMrs. W., to try to get the answers to your questions, as Dr.\nN. and I both thought that would be better than our doing\nit. Mrs. W. is rather easily confused and might have been\nfussed and put out by us, whereas I think Maggie will be more\nable to get clear answers from her.\nJ. died at 2.50 a.m. on Sunday, 5th March. I understand\nthat he never spoke after midnight, and that previously he was\nwandering a good deal and often what he said could not be under\nstood. Maggie was there all that night and as far as she could\ntell he said nothing about you. Mrs. W. had often spoken of\nyour great kindness to them and she had said, Maggie thinks on\nthat Sunday morning, that if she was spared to see you she would\nlike to ask you to accept her corner cupboard. That is all that I\nhave so far found out. . . .\nMrs. N. wrote later:\nMarch 2\u00b1th, 1905.\nI went to see Mrs. J. W. yesterday, but Mrs. H. was with\nher so I could ask her no questions. In the evening Mrs. D. W.\ncame to see me and she told me that when quite alone with her\nmother-in-law she asked her your questions. Apparently nothing\ncould be remembered that J. had said, but on the Sunday morning\nafter his death, after D. had left, Mrs. W. and Maggie and B. were\nsitting together (between 4 and 5 a.m.) and Mrs. J. W. spoke a\ngood deal about you, spoke of the corner cupboard as I told you\nbefore, spoke of your great kindness to them. ... At that time\nalso Mrs. W. had recalled a conversation she had had with J. in\n1 Mr. J. W.'s daughter-in-law\u2014 called Maggie below.\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.\nthe autumn about your kindness, and they also spoke of your last\nvisit and of your speaking to J. and saying that you hoped he\nwould be better when you returned. That is all Maggie could\nfind out. She thinks that perhaps B. might be able to recall\nother things said, but what I have written seems to be the\nsubstance of the conversation.\nMrs. Sidgwick, who saw Miss E. soon after receiving the\naccount and discussed the case fully with her, writes :\nNEWNHAM COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.\nOn March 8th, 1905, I received from [Miss R] a letter dated\nMarch 7th, 1905, enclosing an account, also dated March 7th, 1905,\nof her experience of seeing the face of Mrs. J. W., and a sketch\nof a face as seen.1 J. W. was an old man who had long been a\nploughman on the home farm at . He had had to retire on\naccount of failing health, and the small shop and post office of the\nparish, with house attached (which, with the school and the black\nsmith's and two other houses forms the whole of what is called\n\"the village,\") becoming vacant, Mr. R let the W.'s have it rent\nfree, and Mrs. W. ran the little shop, where sweets and needles\nand thread and postage stamps could be bought.\n[Miss R] told me that whereas the room was certainly not\ndark when she saw the face, and whereas all seemed dark except\nthe face, it has occurred to her that her eyes may have been\nshut; but she has no other evidence of this.\nIt will be noticed that though [Miss R] unfortunately made no\nwritten note of what she had seen before she heard of the death,\nthe evidence that the. vision occurred between 4 and 5 a.m., and\nthat the conversation about [her] also occurred between 4 and 5\na.m. is quite independent.\nMiss E. adds :\nMarch 24th, 1905.\nIn regard to the appearance of the face of Mrs. J. W. to me in\nthe night of March 4th, at 4.14 a.m., I wish to say that to the\nbest of my belief I have never seen an appearance of any similar\nkind before.\nIt will be observed that this case differs from the ordinary\ntype of veridical hallucinations coinciding with deaths in that\n1 This sketch of two faces was sent to us with the account, but is not\nreproduced here, as it was only intended to indicate the relative positions of\nthe two faces when seen.\u2014ED.\n\fNov., 1906. Cases. 321\nthe person whose apparition was seen was not the one who\nwas dying at the time. Four cases of this type were included\nin the Census of Hallucinations (see pp. 259-263 of the\n\" Report on the Census of Hallucinations,\" in Proceedings,\nVol. X.). One of these was published in Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. I., p. 357. Here the percipient sees in the\nnight an apparition of a friend who tells her that his mother\nis dead, and she hears next morning that the death had\ntaken place that night in the son's presence. In another\ncase {Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 260) the apparition of a man who\nwas actually at his mother's death-bed was seen in a church,\nduring the morning service. In a third case, that of Miss\nHawkins-Dempster (Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 261) the apparition\nof a man was seen in her drawing room in the evening at\nthe time of his mother's death, of which he could not have\nknown by any normal means, as he was then in South\nAmerica.\nThese cases are of considerable theoretical interest from\nseveral points of view. They tell strongly against the primi\ntive materialistic view that in persons in some abnormal\nconditions, such as trance or coma, there is a sort of\ndissociation or looseness of connection between soul and body,\nso that the soul \" projects \" itself in a visible form\u2014the\n\" astral form \" of Theosophists\u2014as in that case, the apparition,\nif recognisable at all, must obviously represent the dying\nperson. On the other hand, as pointed out in the discussion\nof them in the \" Eeport on the Census of Hallucinations,\"\n(op. cit., p. 260),\nSuch cases need present no difficulty on the telepathic theory.\nIndeed it may be rather said that the absence of any cases of\nthe kind would render the theory improbable. They raise the\nquestion, however, who the \"agent\"\u2014the person, that is, from\nwhom the telepathic communication comes\u2014is, in hallucinations\ncoinciding with a death. Usually it seems natural to assume that\nit is the dying person, and in some cases\u2014as we have seen in\nChapter xii.\u2014this view is supported by evidence that the dying\nperson's thoughts were specially directed to the percipient. The\nmere fact, however, that the apparition represents a particular\nperson does not prove that that person was the agent. It is\npossible for an agent to transfer to a percipient an image of some\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1906.\nthird person, and it is possible for a percipient to embody an\nimpression telepathically received in a form suggested by his own\nmind and not by the agent's. As an instance where it seems\nimprobable that the person whose figure was seen was the agent,\nsee Mrs. M'Alpine's vision of her baby nephew at the time of\nits death (printed at p. 281). It seems more likely in this case\nthat the agent was some one with the child, than the child itself,\naged six months. In one of the death coincidences quoted in\nChapter xii. (p. 223), there is some reason for thinking that the\nagent was the sister who telegraphed the news rather than the\ndecedent; because (1 the hallucination nearly coincided in time\nwith the despatch of the telegram, while it occurred some hours\nafter the death, and (2) it foretold the arrival of the telegram.\nIn regard to the case of Miss Hawkins-Dempster referred\nto above, the \" Report \" observes that\nthe fact that the person whose figure was seen can hardly by any\nnormal means have known of his mother's death at the time of\nthe hallucination makes it difficult to suppose that he was the\nagent, without a telepathic hypothesis so complicated as to be\nextremely improbable. , . . The apparition followed the death by\nsome hours; so that, if Mrs. H. [the mother] was the agent, the\ntelepathic impression must either have remained latent for some\ntime, or have been produced by the agent after death.\nIt will be observed that in the case of Miss E. the\napparition was seen rather more than an hour after the\ndeath,' and, as in the first two Census cases referred to above,\nthe person seen had been present at the death, and had also\nbeen talking of Miss K. afterwards, so that it would be easy\nto regard her as the \" agent.\"\nL. 1154. Collective Apparition.1\nTHE following is a striking case of an apparition at the time\nof death seen by three different persons, but in different places\nand independently of one another. Collective cases of this\ntype are considerably rarer than those in which the percipients\n1 This case was published in the English Mechanic and World of Science for\nJuly 20th, 1906, and quoted thence in an article by M. Camille Flammarion\nin the Annals of Psychical Science for October, 1906.

Cases. 323\nhave been all together in the same place (for some instances\nof the former, see Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., pp. 173\ntt seq.). Mr. Gurney in his discussion of collective hallucina\ntions in that book, Chap, xviii., points out (op. cit., p. 172)\nthat in such cases one may suppose that each hallucination\nis due to a telepathic impulse from the distant agent, rather\nthan derived by the percipients telepathically from each other,\nas may be supposed when they are all in company together.\nThese cases also, like that of Miss R. given above, tend against\nthe \" projection \" theory (according to which the apparition\nhas some relation to space) and in favour of the telepathic\ntheory (according to which the mind of the percipient alone\nis affected).\nThe first account comes from the Eev. Charles L. Tweedale,\n.S., who writes :\nWESTON VICARAGE, NB. OTLEY,\nYORKSHIRE, July 2\u00abA, 1906.\nOn the night of January 10th, 1879, I had retired early to rest.\nI awoke out of my first sleep to find the moon shining into my\nroom. As I awoke my eyes were directed towards the panels of a\n\u2022cupboard, or wardrobe, built into the east wall of my room, and\nsituated in the north-east corner. I watched the moonlight on the\npanels. As I gazed I suddenly saw a face form on the panels of\nthe cupboard or wardrobe. Indistinct at first, it gradually became\n\u2022clearer until it was perfectly distinct as in life, when I saw the face\nof my grandmother. What particularly struck me at the moment\nand burnt itself into my recollection was the fact that the face wore\nan old-fashioned frilled or goffered cap. I gazed at it for a few\n\u2022\u2022seconds, during which it was as plain as the living face, when it\nfaded gradually into the moonlight and was gone. I was not\nalarmed, but, thinking that I had been deceived by the moonlight\nand that it was an illusion, I turned over and went off to sleep\nagain. In the morning when at breakfast I began telling the experi\nence of the night to my parents. I had got well into my story,\nwhen, to my surprise, my father suddenly sprang up from his seat\nat the table and leaving his food almost untouched hurriedly left\nthe room. As he walked towards the door I gazed after him in\namazement, saying to mother, \"Whatever is the matter with father?\"\nShe raised her hand to enjoin silence. When the door had closed\nI again repeated my question. She replied, \" Well, Charles, it is\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.\nthe strangest thing I ever heard of, but when I awoke this morning\nyour father informed me that he was awakened in the night and\nsaw his mother standing by his bedside, and that when he raised\nhimself to speak to her she glided away.\" This scene and conver\nsation took place at about 8.30 a.m. on the morning of January\nllth. Before noon we received a telegram announcing the death of\nmy father's mother during the night.\nWe found that the matter did not end here, for my father was\nafterwards informed by his sister that she also had seen the appari\ntion of her mother standing at the foot of her bed.\nThus, this remarkable apparition wa,s manifested to three persons\nindependently. My apartment, in which I saw the vision, was at the\nother side of the house to that occupied by my parents, and was\nentirely separate and apart from their room, while my father's sister\nwas nearly 20 miles away at Heckmondwike.\nMy father noted the time as 2 a.m. but I did not take note of\nthe time, but have since been able to ascertain it closely in the\nfollowing way. The house at Crawshawbooth, in which we lived at\nthe time, faces due south and the window of the apartment faces\nalso due south. On the night of January 10-11, 1879, the moon\nwas on the meridian at 14 hours 19 minutes Greenwich Mean Time,\ni.e. 2 hours 19 minutes, a.m., on January llth. When on the\nmeridian the moon illuminates the back and the east and west walls\nof the apartment. I am certain that the east wall of the room was\nilluminated (for there I saw the face in the moonlight) and also the\nback of the room, or north wall. The moon was therefore approxi\nmately on the meridian and the time close on 2 a.m., thus confirming\nmy father's observation in a remarkable and unexpected manner.\nThe death of my grandmother took place at 12.15 a.m., and it is\ncertain from the above considerations that the apparition to myself\nand my father occurred nearly two hours after death.\nMy father died, in 1885, but my mother is living and well\nremembers all the details. Her confirmatory letter [is given below].\nIn the case of the apparition to my aunt, this did not take place\nuntil upwards of eighteen hours after the death, but this is best told\nin the words of my uncle, whose confirmatory letter, together with\nthat of my mother, accompanies this account [and is also given\nbelow].\nIn the apparition to me, what particularly struck me and burnt\nitself into my memory was the gofiered cap around the face. I made\nno attempt to verify this at the time, but specially mentioned it to\n\fNov., 1906. Cases. 325\nmy parents. Some weeks ago, when I set to work to verify these\ndetails, I wrote to my uncle sending him a sketch of what I saw.\nHis reply [to this point is included in the letter quoted below].\nI may say that I have never previously communicated with my\nuncle upon this subject and I had not seen my grandmother for\nsome years previous to her appearance to me.\nIt is absolutely certain that the apparition occurred to each of the\nthree independent witnesses after the death and that this case is\ntherefore an unmistakeable instance of apparitions of the dead and\nproof that the personality survives. I am prepared at any time to\nmake this statement on oath.\n(Signed) CHARLES L. TWEEDALE, F.R.A.S., etc.,\nVicar of Weston.\nIn a letter dated May 14th, 1906, in which Mr. Tweedale\ngave us a preliminary account of this experience, he says that\nhe was at the time a boy of about 15 years of age, living at\nhome with his parents, \" a healthy boy, given up to a lad's\nusual pursuits, and thinking of nothing so little as the super\nnatural.\" In regard to the hour of his experience, as deduced\nfrom his recollection of the position of the moon at the time,\nhe sends us a postcard from the Eoyal Astronomical Society,\nBurlington House, London, W., dated June 23rd, 1906, con\nfirming his statement given above that on the night of January\n10th- llth, 1879, the moon was on the meridian at 14 hours\n19 minutes, Greenwich mean time, that is, 2.19 a.m. on\nJanuary llth, Civil time.\nIn a letter dated October 26th, 1906, Mr. Tweedale sends\nus a funeral card stating that \" Sarah Ann (widow of the\nlate Benjamin Tweedale, of Uppermill, Saddleworth) . . .\ndied on the llth January, 1879, aged 72 years, and was this\nday interred at Saddleworth Church. 15th January, 1879.\"\nHe also says, in answer to our questions, that his father knew\nof his grandmother's illness ;\nBut as far as I remember, he was not under the impression\nthat the illness was serious ; certainly none of us thought of a\nfatal ending. I was at that age when one does not think seriously\nabout these things. I am afraid the matter did not trouble me at\nall, for I had only seen Grandmother two or three times in my\nwhole life ... I had heard my parents say [she] was ill, that\nwas all. . . .\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.\nNow, as to the cap. I believe it was the fashion with old ladies\nsome thirty years ago to wear caps. I may have seen Grandmother\nTweedale in a cap, but have no recollection (definite) of this. I\nliad not seen Grandmother for some years (2\u20143) at the time of\nthe apparition. . . .\nThe following are the letters from Mr. Tweedale's mother\nuncle which were enclosed with his own account :\nVICTOR PLACE, CRAWSHAWBOOTH, NR. RAWTENSTALL,\nLANCASHIRE, June 22nd, 1906.\nI have carefully read my son's account of the strange appearance\nto him and my late husband, Dr. Tweedale. I perfectly well\nremember the matter, my son telling us of what he had seen and\nmy husband telling me of the apparition to him, also the telegram\ninforming us of the death during the night.\nI distinctly remember my husband also being informed by his\n.sister of the appearance to her.\n(Signed) MARY TWEEDALE.\n56 PARSONAGE CRESCENT, WALKLY,\nSHEFFIELD, June 16th, 1906.\nDEAR NEPHEW,\nWith reference to the matters connected with the death\nof Grandma Tweedale, I have great pleasure in giving you the\nfollowing particulars.\nI can vouch for the truth of these details, as she died at my\nhouse in Heckmondwike on Saturday morning, January llth, 1879,\nat 12.15 a.m. She was dying all day on Friday, January 10th,\nand passed away soon after midnight as above stated according to\nthe entry in my diary made at the time.\nBetween my wife and her mother a very close affection existed\nand by a strange fate they both were confined to bed at the same\ntime, the daughter daily expecting the birth of her child and\nthe mother sick with what proved to be her last illness. The\nsituation was a very pathetic one, as my wife only saw her mother\n\u2022once when I carried her helpless in my arms to her mother's bed-\n.side. When Grandma died, by the doctor's orders the news of her\ndeath was carefully kept from my wife, as it was feared that the\n\u2022consequences might be serious in her critical condition. She was\ntherefore, at the time when the apparition passed her vision,\nabsolutely ignorant of the fact that her mother had already passed\naway.\n\fNov., 1906. Cases. 327\nOn Saturday night she was left alone for a short time and\nduring the time the nurse and doctor were out of the room, the\napparition appeared to her, when she saw her mother standing at\nthe foot of the bed. The figure beholding her distress spoke to\nher and simply said \"don't fret\" and then immediately vanished.\nThis would be upwards of eighteen hours after Grandma had\npassed away, my wife being then in total ignorance of her mother's\ndeath. Afterwards my wife said that she was not afraid, but on\nthe other hand she was greatly comforted. I and my daughter\n\u2022well remember her relating this experience to us in after life.\nYou ask me if the sketch you sent of the frilled cap seen by\nyou is correct. Yes, remarkably so, and reproduces exactly the cap\nworn by your Grandmother Tweedale all the time she was ill in bed,\nand in which she died, so that your description of what you saw\n\u2022of her fully represents her appearance at the time she passed away.\nThe above is a plain statement of the whole matter, and I can\nvouch for the truth of every particular, and shall be ready if\nrequired to affirm the same on oath.\n(Signed) JOSHUA HODGSON.\n56 PARSONAGE CRESCENT, WALKLY, SHEFFIELD.\nDEAR NEPHEW,\nYou will be surprised when I inform you that I also\nsaw the same apparition some 20 years after it appeared to you.\nI made a note of it at the time. The incident was so startling\nthat the whole scene at this moment is vividly engraven on my\n-memory.\nOn the evening of Friday, July 29th, 1898, my wife was very\nbusy with her household affairs, when I sat up with her smoking\nand reading until I fell asleep. I remained in this condition until\nlong after midnight. When I awoke and opened my eyes, I was\nastonished to see two figures before me, my wife in her chair asleep,\nand another figure in white above her. I instinctively raised my\n\u00abyes to the face of the top figure and behold ! it was the face of\nher mother ; in an instant it had vanished leaving my wife still\nAsleep in her chair quite unaware of the vision I had just witnessed.\nI thought it prudent not to mention the matter to her at the\nmoment for fear of upsetting her, and did not inform her of\nthis remarkable incident for several months after, but I must\nconfess that during that time I had an uneasy foreboding that it\nwas prognostic of future trouble. My wife died on March 18th,\n\f' 328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.\n1900, a little more than eighteen months after I had seen her\nmother's form standing over her. A few days before she passed\naway she told us that she could see her mother and her favourite\nson (who had passed away about seventeen months before) waiting\nand beckoning for her. After this she could say no more and was\nunconscious to the end.\nAlthough I alone saw the vision in this instance, it certainly\nhelps to confirm the very remarkable previous appearance to the\nthree of you. . . .\nI am writing a separate account of this, so as to keep it distinct\nfrom the other. (Signed) JOSHUA HODGSON.\nMr. Tweedale also sent us an interesting account published\nin the English Mechanic and World of Science for September\n1st, 1905, of a premonitory dream of the discovery of the\ncomet Barnard-Hartwig (1886). He awoke one morning about\n4 a.m. from a very vivid dream of a comet in the morning\nsky, i.e. in the east, rising before the sun. He was so much\nimpressed that he at once dressed and went out to a small\nplatform upon which he used his SJ in. reflector. He put\nthis into position and prepared to sweep for the comet, nothing\nbeing visible to the naked eye. He set the instrument at\nrandom, at an altitude of about 30\u00b0, and slowly swept it across\nthe sky, using a low-power eye-piece, and during the first\nsweep the comet came into the field of view. He intended\nto despatch a telegram announcing his discovery as soon as\nthe post-office opened, but by the first post received a paper\nin which was published the information that the comet had\nalready been discovered by Barnard and the night afterwards\nby Harbwig. The dream may therefore be explained as tele\npathic rather than premonitory in the strict sense of the word.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nMR. GROTTENDIECK'S POLTERGEIST.\nI.\nRACKETTS, HYTHE, HANTS.,\nJuly 30th, 1906.\n... If it is not too late to offer further comments on the case\nrecorded in the Journal under the heading \"Mr. Grottendieck's.\nPoltergeist,\" I should like to call attention again to it as an\n\fNov., 1906. Correspondence. 329\nadmirable illustration of a principle which is very generally ignored\nboth by psychical researchers and by scientific psychologists. The\nthings we see are not images on the retina. They are only things\nwhich we infer to \" be there,\" in consequence, in most cases (but\nnot in all1), of sensations transmitted to consciousness from the\nretina. These sensations may be sufficiently numerous and detailed\nto justify the inference completely, or at any rate sufficiently, for\nthe purpose in hand. But more often even a cursory examination\nreveals the fact that the actual data upon which our visual\nimpressions are based are very scanty, and the impressions them\nselves are filled in by imagination, which is the result of\nexperience.\nFor example, Mr. Grottendieck says (Journal, May, 1906, p. 263)\n\" I saw quite distinctly that they came right through the ' kadjang.' \"\nI remember a similar statement in an account of a spiritualistic\nstance, a witness stating that he heard a bell come through the\nwall from the next room, ringing all the time !\nA moment's thought would have convinced Mr. Grottendieck\nthat no retinal image or succession of retinal images could have\nrecorded the passage of stones through the kadjang ; he can only\nhave (unconsciously) inferred that the stones passed through from\nthe fact that he was not aware of any retinal image representing\nthem coming up to the ceiling from the boy's hand (or wherever\nthey did come from). But I do not wish to imply that Mr.\nGrottendieck made an erroneous inference from the evidence of\nhis senses. He doubtless did \" see distinctly \" what he describes\u2014\nthe act of seeing was itself the unconscious inference. So also the\nwitness at the spiritualistic stance was doubtless quite correct in\nsaying that he heard (i.e. had an auditory sense-perception of) the\nbell coming through the wall. The sense perception included all\nthat, though the auditory sensation was not sufficient logically to\njustify it\u2014any more than some point de repere in a crystal justifies\na crystal vision.\nWhat I have said about sense perceptions in general is capable\nof most striking illustration in the case of perceptions of motion.\nIt is a mistake to which psychologists are liable to attempt to\nalways explain visual illusions of motion by unconscious ocular\nmovements. There is for example no reason to suppose that Mr.\n1In dreams we \"see things\" in a way which in consciousness at the\ntime cannot always be distinguished from normal vision. But these sense\nperceptions are not (presumably) due to retinal images at all.\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.\nGrottendieck's eyes quivered because the stones appeared to him\nto hover in the air. It is only necessary to suppose a temporary\naberration in his estimate of time, such as frequently occurs in\nfever, etc. Moreover, it is easy to produce experimentally illusions-\nof motion which cannot possibly be due to ocular movements.\nPerhaps the most conclusive experiment is to watch a revolving\ndisc on which a spiral line has been traced, from the centre out\nwards. If the speed is about right, the appearance will be that of\na number of expanding rings which begin at the centre of the\ndisc and move out to the circumference, where they vanish. If\nnow the rotation of the disc is suddenly arrested, for a few seconds\nthe impression will be produced of a series of contracting rings,\nshrinking in from the circumference to the centre. It is obvious\nthat there cannot be any corresponding motion of the points of\nthe retina upon which the image of the spiral line, now at rest,\nobjectively falls.\nThe moral to the psychical researcher is not to doubt the\nveracity of witnesses to supernormal phenomena of the class we\nare considering, but to remember that the automatic mechanism\nof sense perception provides us as a rule with ready-made objective\ninferences\u2014and not with pure evidence. In normal life the dis\ntinction is immaterial, but when we come to the \"supernormal,\"\nit is of the very essence of the question. For example, in Mr.\nGrottendieck's case it, to my mind, leaves nothing further to be\nsaid, and no further explanation to be desired.\nEDWARD T. DIXON.\nII.\n[A MEMBER of the Society residing at Singapore sends us the\nfollowing tentative explanation of Mr. Grottendieck's Poltergeist,\nwhich we print in the hope that some botanist familiar with the\nflora of that region may give us an opinion on its plausibility. It\nwill be remembered that in the Journal for July, p. 295, Mr.\nGrottendieck gave a description of the \" stones \" in question.\nEDITOR.]\nThe Poltergeist phenomenon described by Mr. Grottendieck (Journal,\nMay, 1906), may, it seems to me, have a simple explanation which,\nhowever, I diffidently suggest. The stones which fell in the night\nwere lost, I understand, and never satisfactorily examined by a\nnaturalist. Were they stones 1 or were they the hard seeds of some\nfruit ? In houses little occupied, it is very common for the small\n\fNov., 1906. Correspondence. 331\nfruit-bats to come at night to eat fruit gathered from a tree near\nthe house. The bats bite off the fruit, fly noiselessly into the house,\nand hanging from the roof nibble off the flesh of the fruit and drop\nthe seed on the floor. I have slept in a house in Malacca where\nthis rain of seeds of a Elaeocarpus tree went on the whole night. The\nbats flew in noiselessly and kept dropping these seeds, which fell with a\nloud noise on the floor, quite in the style of Mr. Grottendieck's stones.\nThe bats always fly to the same place to hang up, so the seeds all\nfall from the same spot. They might be slightly warm from the\nbat's holding them in its wings, but I certainly never noticed any\nthing like this about seed carried by bats. The curve in the fall\ncan hardly be accounted for in this way, as the bats drop seeds\nquite straight. Firing a rifle into the jungle would have little effect\non the bats, but might startle some which were eating their fruit\nthen in the house and make them drop it quickly. The cessation,\nof the fall might be due in this case to the fact that the bats had\nfinished the fruit of the tree, or had had enough. Many of the\nhard seeds of fruits might be mistaken for black stones if not carefully\nexamined by a naturalist. It is very unfortunate that the objects-\nwere not preserved.\nThe Poltergeist is not absolutely unknown to Malays. I have\nheard a description of an occurrence of this nature from a Malay.\nIt was said to have happened in Singapore town some years ago.\nA room in one of the streets was bombarded by stones, similar\nto ordinary road metal, which flew through the windows in broad\ndaylight. No one could be seen to throw them, though this\nwas watched for. As it was considered to be due to the pranks of\na demon in the house, a pious Imam came to read the Koran to it\nto exorcise it, but directly he began in the presence of a number\nof other people, the book was kicked from his hands by an unseen\npower, and its leaves went fluttering about the room. Undismayed,\nhe picked up the book again and went on reading, and shortly after\nthe disturbance ceased. This is the story as told to me by a Malay,,\nand though one cannot place much faith in a story of an incident\nwhich had happened some years before when told by a native, it\nserves to show that the phenomenon is known in the Malay Peninsula.\nThe house where this occurred has long been pulled down, and I\ncould get no more information about it.\nHENRY N. RIDLEY.\nSingapore.\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.\nTHE CASE OF LYON v. HOME.\nMr. E. T. Bennett points out to me that in an article of mine\n\u2022dealing with the physical phenomena of spiritualism and published\nin The Daily Express for June 25th, 1906, a reference is made to\nthe above case which is not technically accurate, and I am glad to\ntake this opportunity of correcting it. The statement I made was\nthat D. D. Home \" was convicted of obtaining large sums of money\nfrom a certain Mrs. Lyon by means of alleged communications from\nher deceased husband, urging her to adopt Home as her son and\ngive him \u00a3700 a year.\" Mr. Bennett observes that the use of the\nword \" convicted \" in this sentence is objectionable, since the action\nbrought against Home was in a Court of Equity; he was not tried\nfor a criminal offence ; and the judgment of the Court was not a\nverdict of \"guilty\" against a prisoner, but an order to refund certain\nmoney, which as a matter of fact was done.\nBy the term \" convicted,\" I intended merely to convey the fact\nthat a lawsuit in which Home was the defendant was decided\nagainst him, as I was using the word in its ordinary everyday\nsense, without thinking of its technical legal sense. This was no\ndoubt an oversight which might tend to mislead readers. The\nquestion whether in any given case a person has or has not been\nunduly influenced to benefit another must always admit of differences\nof opinion, and must in Courts of Law be decided on a balance of\nprobabilities. Readers who are interested in this particular case\nshould refer to a careful summary of its legal aspects by Mr. H.\nArthur Smith, printed in the Journal, Vol. IV., pp. 117-119, from\nwhich I quote the following sentences :\n\" The Court held the law to be that such transactions as those\nin question cannot be upheld 'unless the Court is quite satisfied that\nthey are acts of pure volition uninfluenced.' The burden of proof\nof sustaining what is primd facie utterly unreasonable is on those\nwho seek to benefit thereby. This proof of the voluntariness of\nMrs. Lyon's gifts was certainly not forthcoming.\"\nALICE JOHNSON.\nDR.

PHILLIPS.\nIN a paper in Les Annales des Sciences Psychiques (1904, p.\n243) which also appeared in the Revue de I'Hypnotisme (Feb.\n1905), Dr. P. Joire describes an instrument called the\nsthenometer ; it consists of a light straw pointer suspended\non a vertical needle-point and protected by a glass shade.\nWhen a hand is brought near the instrument at right angles\n\f336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEO., 1906.\nto the pointer and with the finger-tips opposite to the end,\nthe pointer is attracted towards the hand by varying amounts.\nHaving observed a connection between the magnitude of this\nmotion for the two hands and the nervous condition of the\nindividual, Dr. Joire claims to have discovered a nervous force\nemanating from the body and causing this motion.\nIn order to test these statements of Dr. Joire we have\ncarried out a number of experiments with a sthenometer kindly\nlent us by Mr. F. W. H. Hutchinson, of Cambridge, and we\nhave come to the conclusion that the whole of the results\nmay be very well explained as due to heat radiated from the\nhand. This idea was first strongly suggested by the marked\nlag between the placing of the hand in position and the com\nmencement of the motion of the pointer. Tt was further\nsupported by the following observations :\n(1) If the hand was placed in direct contact with the glass,\nso that the glass was heated much nflore rapidly and to a\nhigher temperature, the lag was very much smaller and the\nmotion of the pointer more rapid and through a larger angle.\nIn fact with the hand touching the glass and moved continually\nso as to always keep the finger-tips in position opposite the end\nof the pointer, the latter moved through over 90\u00b0 in a minute.\n(2) If a hot object, such as a heated poker, a spirit stove,\na lighted match, or an electric lamp, was brought up, a large\nand rapid motion of the pointer towards the hot object was\nproduced.\nThese results led us to repeat the experiments by which\nDr. Joire claimed to have eliminated heat as a possible\nexplanation of the motion produced. The deflection caused\nby a hand was observed first with and then without a thick\nscreen of non-conducting material interposed, the position of\nthe hand being the same in both cases. We used for our\nscreen three or four thicknesses of an eiderdown quilt. The\nfollowing were the results obtained :\nDEFLECTION TOWARDS THE HAND IN FIVE MINUTES.\nWith screen.

Some Experiments with the Sthenometer. 337\nThe deflections obtained in the presence of the screen were\non the whole such as might be expected if the heat from\nthe hand slowly filtered through ; no great importance can be\nattached to them, as such slight deflections are often caused\nby vibrations or air-draughts, to which the instrument is very\nsensitive. At any rate the screen almost entirely cut off the\neffect on the pointer, and this seems to show that the deflection\nobtained by Dr. Joire under similar conditions was spurious\nand to be explained by accidental causes.\nTo make the heat test more definite, experiments were tried\nwith a six-inch Leslie's cube filled with water heated to\n40\u00b0 C. The vertical sides of the cube were (1) polished,\n(2) painted white, (3) painted a deep cream, (4) painted black.\nWhen it was placed in somewhat the same position as\nthe hand, the following deflections were obtained, each in five\nminutes :\n(1) polished side, 3\u00b0.\n(2) white side, 6\u00a3\u00b0.\n(3) deep-cream side, 13i\u00b0.\n(4) black side, 41?0.\nThus the deflections increased largely with the amount of\nheat radiated from the side of the cube ; 40\u00b0 C. is slightly\nabove the temperature of the blood, and it is interesting that\nthe effect produced by the deep-cream side is of the same\norder as that produced by the hand. This same side, when\nthe cube was filled with a mixture of ice and water, repelled the\npointer through 6\u00b0, and we may mention here that among\nthe many hands tested by us, only one showed any sign of\nrepulsion, and then only through \u00a3\u00b0.\nFinally to establish the connection between the motion of\nthe pointer produced by the hand and the heat radiated from\nit, the following deflections were observed :\n(1) In the Sthenometer when the hand was placed at a\nfixed distance from it.\n(2) Immediately afterwards in a galvanometer connected\nwith a thermopile when the hand was placed at a fixed\ndistance from the latter.\n: The following results were obtained with five different\nhands :\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1906.\nDeflexion in Sthenometer. Deflexion in Galvanometer.\n10|\u00b0 2-4 cms.\n12\u00b0 3\n13\u00b0 3-9 \u201e\n4-7 \u201e\n5-5 \u201e\nThis shows that the deflection in the sthenometer increases with\nthe amount of heat radiated from the hand and the correlation\nbetween the two sets of figures is as close as could be\nreasonably expected if heat is assumed to be the sole cause\nof the motion. We may suppose that the glass becomes\nheated and so sets up air convection currents setting the\npointer in motion towards the heated spot.\nTo test this suggestion the pointer was suspended in a\nbell-jar which could be exhausted of air. At atmospheric\npressure a hand brought near in the ordinary way gave a\ndeflection of 14\u00b0. When the pressure was reduced to I'l cms.\nof mercury the same hand placed in the same position gave\na deflection of certainly not more than ^\u00b0. This is conclusively\nin favour of the above suggestion.\nThere may of course be a relation between the heat\nradiated from the two hands and the nervous condition of\nthe individual, and Dr. Joire's criterion of the meaning of the\nresults given by the sthenometer may still be of value. But\n\u2022our own experiments with twenty-one different individuals\nwould not lead us to support his views. Quite a large pro\nportion of apparently healthy undergraduates showed signs of\nhysteria, neurasthenia or nervous depression, according to Dr.\nJoire's criterion, and one individual, apparently in normal good\nhealth all the time, in the course of twelve days ran through\nthe whole series of nervous troubles indicated in Dr. Joire's\nsecond paper. It has seemed to us that the effect produced\nby the two hands depended far more on the changes in the\ntemperature of the hands induced by exercise or other causes\nthan on variations in the general nervous state. In any case\na thermopile would be a more reliable and sensitive instrument\nfor testing this point than a sthenometer. And it might be\nwell worth while for any one with facilities for studying\nneurasthenic patients to test Dr. Joire's criterion with both\ninstruments.\n\fDEO., 1906. Some Experiments with the Sthenometer. 339\n|p It might also be of interest to perform carefully some\n\u00abxperiments on bodies of different material held for a time\nin the hand and then placed by the sthenometer. Dr. Joire\nin his latest paper1 gives an account of some such experi\nments, but does not give sufficient details to substantiate\nhis claim that the results could not be due to heat. He\ntook no precautions to measure the amount of heat which\nwould be radiated from the bodies after being held in the\nhand. This would depend on a good many circumstances, which\nare insufficiently or not at all dealt with, such as the nature\nof the surface, the material, the thickness, and the temperature,\netc., of the body used. Dr. Joire's results as described do\nnot seem in any way inconsistent with our hypothesis.\nWe have tried a few rough experiments on the same lines,\nwithout anything occurring which could not be well explained\nby the radiation of heat stored up in a body while it was\nheld in the hand. But the point might be worthy of a more\n,detailed and quantitative study than we have so far been able\nto give to it.\nIn conclusion, reference may here perhaps be usefully given\nto a paper by Sir William Crookes,2 in which he gives an\naccount of some careful researches into the rotation of a\ndelicately suspended cylinder of ivory. He reached the con\nclusion that the motion was produced by molecular pressure\ncaused by radiation and not by air-currents. The sthenometer,\nhowever, appears to belong rather to the class of instruments\ndiscussed in a note by Dr. Abraham Wallace and Mr. St.\nGeorge Lane Fox in this Journal (Vol. VIII., p. 249, June,\n1898). They showed the air currents, which produced the\nmotion of a delicately suspended body under a bell-jar, by\nmeans of clouds of smoke. We can but support their claim\nthat no instrument can contribute to our knowledge of \" psychic\nforce \" which does not eliminate or duly account for the presence\n\u2022of the various forces well known to the physicist, and we\nsubmit that the sthenometer has failed to satisfy this test.\n1 \" The Storage of the Exteriorised Nervous Force in Various Bodies,\" Annals\n\u2022of Psychical Science, July, 1906.\n2 \" On the supposed 'New Force' of M.

Dream.\nThis case was kindly obtained for us by Mr. Andrew Lang,,\nthe witnesses being friends of his own, whose names were\ngiven us in confidence. The first account was contained in\na letter to him, which he forwarded to us on April 21st,.\n1906, and is as follows:\nJ. had a very curious dream about [Mr. C.] about ten days\nago, shortly after his illness began. I woke, hearing her call out\nvery loud in her sleep. She was sound asleep, but wailing, and\nsaying over and over : \" Oh ! Thursday, at four o'clock. Thursday,,\nat four o'clock.\" I asked her in the morning if she had been\ndreaming, and she said she had had a horrid dream about Mr. C.\u2014\nthat he would die on Thursday at four o'clock. The first Thursday\ncame and went, but he died yesterday (Thursday) at four o'clock.\nA strange and eerie coincidence.\nIn answer to our request for independent statements from\nMr. and Mrs. L. we received the following :\nFrom Mr. L.\nApril 30th, 1906.\nThe facts about which you inquire are as follows : A great\nfriend of ours was taken ill on Sunday [date stated] of this year.\nThe illness developed into pneumonia, and naturally gave us much\nanxiety, but the complaint attacked only one lung, and there was\nalways hope of recovery.\nIn the early morning of Tuesday [nine days later], just at grey\ndawn, I was wakened by hearing my wife wailing and moaning,\nand I started up, fearing that something was wrong. She was\napparently sound asleep, but was calling out, very clearly and\ndistinctly, \" 0-oh, on Thursday, at four o'clock. On Thursday, at\nfour o'clock.\" In the morning I said to her, \"What was the matter\nlast night ? Were you dreaming a terrible dream 1 You were\nmoaning and calling out about 'Thursday, at four o'clock.'\" She\nthen told me the dream, which I enclose with this letter, and she\nsaid that she had dreamt that the doctor had told her that our\nfriend (Mr. C.) would die on Thursday at four o'clock.\nThursday came, but Mr. C. was then easier, and in a few days\nwas almost out of danger. On the following Thursday, however,\nhe suddenly collapsed, and died at four o'clock.\n\fDEO., 1906. Cases. 341\n\u2022\nThere can be no doubt as to the time, for my wife (to my\nknowledge) left our own house a little (perhaps 20 minutes) before\nthat hour, and went with some of Mr. C.'s children direct to their\nhome, which is not more than five minutes' walk from the house in\nwhich we live. In about a quarter of an hour after they entered\nthe house Mr. C. died.\nI cannot very well ask any of the relatives to verify the hour\nof death, nor do I care to ask the doctor to do so (he is a cousin\nof Mrs. C.), but from my knowledge of the time at which my wife\nleft our house I can be certain within a very few minutes, and\nmy wife is absolutely sure of the hour.\nFrom Mrs. L.\nApril 30th, 1906.\nOn Tuesday [date stated], an illness by which Mr. , a very\ngreat friend of my husband and myself, had been atttacked was\npronounced to be pneumonia. During the days that followed I was\nvery much with his wife, and as the illness was from the first a\nserious one, I was very anxious.\nDuring the night of Monday [of the following week]\u2014early in\nthe morning, I fancy\u2014I dreamed that his doctor came to me and\nsaid, looking very pale and grave, \" will die at 4 on Thursday.\"\nIn my dream I sobbed \"At jour on Thursday?\" and half awoke\nmyself, moaning. In the morning my husband asked me, \" What\nwere you moaning and wailing about ' Thursday at 4 o'clock ' 1 \" and\nI told him my dream.\nWhen Thursday came I felt very uneasy, but on Thursday after\nnoon ' Mr. rallied, and the improvement was so steadily\nmaintained until Wednesday [of the following week] that his speedy\nrecovery was looked for.\nOn Wednesday morning he had a heart collapse, but again rallied,\nand on Thursday morning seemed considerably stronger. I was\nat his house most of the morning, and left about one o'clock. The\ndoctor was still hopeful, and I had forgotten about my dream.\nAbout 20 minutes to four I returned, and found that Mr.\nhad had another collapse, and was dying.\nA few minutes after four o'clock his eldest son came downstairs\nand told me that his father had just then died.\nWe asked if the dream had been mentioned to any\none before Mr. C.'s death, and if so, whether there was\n\f342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1906.\nany possibility that he could have heard of it, and Mr. L.\nreplied :\u2014\nMay 5th, 1906.\nIt is impossible that Mr. C. could ever have heard of my wife's\ndream. It was not mentioned to anybody until I told Mr. Lang\nafter Mr. C.'s death.\nL. 1155. Collective Hallucination.\nTHE following case of a collective hallucination of a light seen\nin connection with the Welsh Revival services was sent to\nMr. A. T. Fryer by the Eev. D. Mardy Davies, pastor of the\nCalvinistic Methodist Chapel at Pontycymmer, Glamorgan, where\nthe light was seen. Mr. Davies writes to Mr. Fryer :\nPONTYCYMMER, Dec. 1st, 1905.\nA circle of fire was seen at Bethel last Friday evening, and was seen\nby many. It appeared before the pulpit and above the big seat. It\nwas about 3 feet in diameter, and moved upwards as high as the gallery,\nand then disappeared. I cannot say how many saw it. I can refer\nyou to two young men who are candidates for the Ministry. Both\nsaw it distinctly, and it has made a lasting impression on their minds.\n[One was] Mr. ,T. C. Jones, c\/o Mr. Griffith Jones, Builder. The\nother one is T. M. Jones, who lives near to the former.\nD. MARDY DAVIES.\nOn receiving this account, Mr. Fryer wrote to make enquiries\non the following points :\n(1) Time and duration of the light?\n(2) Number of persons by whom seen ?\n(3) Whether connected with any particular part of the service or\npoint of a sermon ?\n(4) Have the witnesses attended Mrs. Jones' (of Egryn) services\nat any time?\n(5) Whether this was the first occasion or not of such a vision\nto the percipients ?\n(6) Whether the percipients have ever had any experiences in the\nway of dreams that have come true, or visions, or telepathic\ninfluence ?\n(7) The names of the occupants of the big seat over whose heads\nthe light appeared, and whether at the moment they were praying\nor reading ?\n(8) Exact description of the light, apparent size, colour, etc.?\n\fDEO., 1906. Cases. 343\nMr. J. C. Jones replied as follows :\n3 HILL VIEW, PONTYCYMMER, Dec. 25th, 1905.\nYour letter of the 2nd inst. to hand. I had overlooked your\nfirst letter, owing to my waiting for a correct description of points\nyou ask for in the enclosed. But up to now I have failed to get all\nyou ask for. But I shall try to give you as much information as\nI can, as follows :\n(i) About 2 seconds.\n(ii) I have only found that it is only Mr. T. M. Jones and\nmyself up to now.\n(iii) When singing a popular old Welsh song.\n(iv) No.\n(v) Yes.\n(vi) I myself have seen three bars of light before at Bethel just\n\u2022after I had finished my sermon in last August.\n(vii) I cannot remember all their names. The light appeared\nwhile they were praising God in reciting verses, hymns and singing.\n(viii) The circle would be about 3 feet in diameter. It was of\nsunny colour, a part yellow and a part red.\nI may say that this is the only description I myself can give.\nI asked Mr. T. M. J. for his, and he says he has had no letter\nfrom you. He lives at Ogmore House, Hill View, Pontycymmer.\nJ. C. JONES.\nMr. T. M. Jones wrote later to Mr. Fryer as follows :\nOGMORE HOUSE, HILLVIEW, PONTYCYMMER, Dec. 29\/A, 1905.\nI am in receipt of yours of 27th inst. I am sorry that I cannot\nhelp you in this matter, as what I saw is entirely beyond description.\nT. M. JONES.\nMr. Fryer tried in vain to obtain further details of what\n\u2022was seen, his later letters remaining unanswered.\nKAPPING MAGPIES.\nTHE following account was sent to us by a Member of the\nSociety, Mrs. E. Home, who obtained it from her friend, Miss\nMoney, the narrator. It was written towards the end of\nOctober, 1905, and the signatures which follow Miss Money's\nare those of her mother, Mrs. Close, Miss Close, a niece of\nMrs. Close's, and their maid.\n\f344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1906.\nAbout the end of June this year, 1905, my mother took a cottage\non the edge of Dartmoor for five weeks ; it was of recent date,\nhaving been built about a year.\nThe first night of our residence we were aroused from our\nslumbers by our maid who slept downstairs on the ground floor;\nshe burst into our room in a panic of terror, declaring some one was\ngetting into her window, and she had seen something white in the\nroom. We were considerably alarmed, but on looking at the clock,\nand being very sleepy, I took the hour for 8.30 a.m., and said,\n\" How silly you are ! it is the milk woman ! \" and we all became\nvery bold, with the exception of the maid, and went downstairs and\nsearched the cottage and the garden. We found nothing and heard\nnothing, and returned to our rooms to find that sleep had so\ndimmed our eyes as to deceive us in the hour, for we discovered\nthat instead of 8.30 it was 4 a.m. We had no sooner settled down\nthan the noise began again, and we again went down to find nothing.\nThe milk woman and postman laughed at the maid and scorned\nthe idea of the cottage being \" haunted \" ; but the noise recurred the\nsame time every night, and we came to the conclusion that it must\nbe the maid herself hammering on her iron bed to make us come\ndown, or that it had something to do with the pipes connected\nwith the bath.\nHowever, we did not like it at all, and one morning at that early\nhour it continued for an hour and a-half and was so loud that we\ncould not sleep. At the. end of four weeks we had not discovered\nwhat it was, and one morning I leaned out of the window looking\nat the sunrise, and the rabbits and birds beginning to wake up,\nwhen I discovered that the maid was right, and the noise was on\nher window and sounded as if some one had cut a stick from the\nhedge and hit the window hard with it ; and this did really frighten\nme, and on looking at the window after breakfast I saw that it was\ncovered with little specks of mud, as it might be from a stick.\nOur disturbances were commonly known in the village, and on\nbringing the condition of the window to the notice of our friends,\nit was suggested that some one should come and sleep in a tent in\nthe garden and shoot at whatever it was.\nFinally we agreed to leave the door of the room next to the\nmaid's room open, so that we could see outside on coming down\nstairs, and at the first sound my mother went down very softly, and\nshe said she saw an enormous bird, she thought a heron, fly over\nthe gate ; when it came again, I went down and saw a pair of\n\fDEC., 1906. Rapping Magpies. 345\nmagpies fly over the gate, after which we were able to persuade\nthe maid to get up and look. As soon as she moved all was quiet ;\nshe moved the curtain and watched, and in ten minutes a pair of\nmagpies appeared ; one flew at the window, whilst the other walked\nup and down the lawn.\nSo the mystery was solved. We could never have believed it was\na bird who came so punctually, had we not seen it; and we were\nafterwards told in the village that the people who had lived in the\ncottage before were also much disturbed and frightened by the\nsame noise. The little dog who slept in the sitting room never\nbarked or moved.\nINA MONEY.\nM. C. CLOSE.\nA. CLOSE.\nLILY PENGILLEY.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nON EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nEvery one reading the accounts of experiments in thought-trans\nference published by the S.P.R. cannot fail to be struck by the fact\nthat although many and valuable results may have been obtained,\nthere has been practically no variation in the principle of the methods\nemployed. It appears to me that much might be gained by trying\nfresh methods, in order to find if possible some readier and more\nreliable means of inducing telepathy than those generally used.\nPossibly some of the recorded cases of telepathy in which the\ncondition of the agent is more or less known might help us, to\nsome extent, in devising them.\nPhantasms near the time of death appear to occur, at any rate\nsometimes, while the agent is unconscious. In other (not death)\ninstances, e.g. in cases of stunning, the agent is again unconscious,\nor if conscious at all, his primary consciousness is probably practically\nin abeyance. In the case of S.H.B. his phantasm was seen while\nhe himself was asleep. In all these cases we may fairly assume the\nprimary consciousness to have been to all intents and purposes in\na state of suspension.\nCan we in any way produce experimentally this state of temporary\nabeyance of the primary consciousness, or anything approaching to\nit 1 Might we not take a hint from the methods of the Christian\nScientists as to this point ?\n\f346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEO., 1906.\nTheir method of cure, in many cases at any rate, is, roughly,\nfirst to determine what result they wish to produce in the patient\n(e.g. the removal of a headache), and then to put the patient and\nhis complaint completely out of mind, and concentrate their atten\ntion on some Divine attribute, such as the love of God, and\nattempt to realise it, the cure being said to be effected at the\nmoment when the realisation is sufficiently perfect.\nThe Christian Scientists believe that at that moment they become\na channel through which the power of God can act to effect the\ncure. If however they really can produce results\u2014a point on which\nI have not sufficient knowledge to dogmatise\u2014may it not be that\nthey have hit upon a method of inducing a condition similar in its-\neffect to the abeyance of the primary consciousness, and so helping\nto produce telepathic results t\nIt seems possible that the mental concentration on a highly\nabstract idea may, so to speak, use up the primary consciousness,,\nand prevent it from interfering by further suggestions with the\nsecondary consciousness, which is thus left free and undisturbed to-\ncarry out the telepathic act.\nIt is clearly easy to apply this principle to experiments on\nthought-transference, so far as the agent is concerned.\nIt is difficult to find any condition common to the percipients in-\nthe spontaneous telepathic cases. Possibly the condition of .the\nagent may be the chief determining cause. It may however be\nworth noting that in these cases the percipient is not expecting any\ntelepathic impression, and is not looking for it when it comes,\u2014\nwhich tends to show that trials made without the knowledge of\nthe percipient may be worth more attention; and since in many\ncases the impression may apparently remain latent for some con\nsiderable time, this also should be taken into account when possible.\nUnfortunately I have no opportunity of carrying out researches\nmyself, but I do feel very strongly that it is not merely by repeating\nthe same experiments that the solution of telepathy will, if ever,\nbe reached ; but only by constantly varying their conditions until\nthe best method is found.\nOther variations, and probably better ones, will doubtless suggest\nthemselves to many members of the S.P.R.\nI do not write as a perfectly convinced believer in telepathy,\nbut in the hope that if it really does exist, some fortunate experi\nmenter, by trying any likely methods that may strike him, may\ndiscover some means of producing its phenomena with reasonable\n\fDEC., 1906. Correspondence. 347\ncertainty, and without the many failures at present attending such\nattempts ; and also that from the nature of such a method, if found,\nwe may be able to approach more nearly to the explanation of\ntelepathy itself. HUGH WINGFIELD.\n[We gladly endorse Dr. Wingfield's suggestion for trying\nexperiments in telepathy under a variety of conditions, but\nwould only point out to experimenters that, considering the\ncomparative rarity of successes under any conditions in these\nexperiments, a very long series would be necessary to establish\neven the presumption of certain conditions being more favour\nable than others.\u2014EDITOR.]\nNOTES.\nAN abridged edition of Mr. Myers's Human Personality, which\nhas been prepared by his son, Mr. L. H. Myers, is shortly\nto be published by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. In the\nabridgment, the text of the original chapters is very little\ncurtailed, though a selection only of the illustrative cases is\ngiven. The Appendices, in which a great mass of detailed\nevidence was originally included, have on the other hand\nbeen considerably abridged. The argument may thus be\nfollowed without interruption, while, for fuller evidence in\nsupport of the author's theories, the serious student will be\nable to consult the original edition by the help of the complete\nseries of references which are given in the abridgment.\nThe book will be in a single 8vo volume of about 450\npages.\nThe reports on the \" materialisations \" at the Villa Carmen,\nAlgiers, which have been published in The Annals of Psychical\nScience from October, 1905, onwards, are probably familiar to\nmost of our readers.
