Language:  French.  Publisher: Bureaux d\u2019Etudes Psychiques.  Editor: Rene d'Hery.\r\n 1\/1, January 1907.  32 pp., 8 francs a year.\n\n This is a pure example of the audacious form of magical New Thought that was dominant in the United States at the time -- the journal recommended one of W.W. Atkinson\u2019s works.  It seems to have been intended as a forum for the Bureaux d'Etudes Psychiques and its courses on Psychology, Hypnotism and Personal Magnetism.  The articles revealed the wonders of personal magnetism, concentration, self-confidence, mental powers, hypnotism, thought transference, and the journal also included longer, didactic articles on the Kabbala (replete with vague hints of its sexual elements) and phrenology, and short New thought novels.  Contributions by Hery, C.-R. Sadler, Georges Lange, Alexis Noel, Eug\u00e8ne Defrance, Theodule Branche, and others outside the mainstream of French occultism and spiritism.  The Mercure de France, in reviewing Hery\u2019s and Sadler\u2019s book on L'Education de la Pensee notes the influence on them of the hypnotists and magnetizers and of occultists like Prentice Mulford.
