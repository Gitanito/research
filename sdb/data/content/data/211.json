He was fluent in several languages, a leading scholar of classical studies, and president of the Hellenic Society and the Classical Association. Together with Andrew Lang and Ernest Myers (brother of FWH Myers), he made a much-praised English translation of Homer\u2019s Iliad.\n\nIn 1891, he was appointed a director of the Westminster Bank and became its chairman in 1918. He was the president of the Institute of Bankers and the International Chamber of Commerce.  Psychical Research\n\nLeaf joined the the Society for Psychical Research in 1884 and served on the council from 1889 to 1902. He played an active part with Oliver Lodge and FWH Myers in studying the Boston medium Leonora Piper on her first visit to England in 1889-90, organizing sittings in Cambridge and London and contributing commentary to the subsequent report.   Views\n\nLeaf rejected the view, favoured by Myers, Lodge and some others, that Piper was communicating with deceased \u2018spirits\u2019, concluding that her control personality \u2018Phinuit\u2019 was a secondary personality. However, he stated that he was convinced of a supernormal process, since \u2018Phinuit\u2019 possessed a \u2018quite exceptional power of reading the contents of the minds of sitters\u2019.1\n\nRegarding the question of post-mortem survival, Leaf took the view that&nbsp;the evidence presented by Myers in his&nbsp;Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death (1903) tended to weaken the concept of personality as an integrated whole, and he therefore doubted that it survived death in its familiar existing form. However, he also considered that 'something of us' does seem to survive death, at least temporarily, namely, 'a more or less coherent complex of memories' to which mediums may gain access.2. But he thought of this in a positive sense, writing:  \n\n&nbsp;It is a hope and not a fear that the dissolution of the body may mean the dissolution of this spiritual crust as well; that one day the infinite which is within us all may have freer play, and mingle in unconstrained communion with other spiritual elements equally purged of earthly dross, through channels infinitely clearer and more translucent than the imperfect and unsatisfying organs of the mortal frame.3   Works (Selected)  Book Translation\n\nA Modern Priestess of Isis by Vsevolod Sergeyevich Solovyov (1895).
