Cramer and supplemented by Angel Messengers), and advertisements for the likes of Prof. C. Braganza, \"the celebrated Hindu seer, astrologer, psychic poet and life reader.\"  It touted Robinson\u2019s series of lessons for \"students of Spirit Mediumship\" and published messages from the spirits of readers\u2019 deceased relatives as well as from Robert G. Ingersoll, Henry George, Henry W. Longfellow, Chester A. Arthur, Benjamin F. Butler, Henry Ward Beecher, et al, and Robinson\u2019s accounts of her \"Spiritual Visit to Planet Mars\" and \"Astral Travel toward the Sun,\" and the like.  The Astrological Department was conducted by C.P. Christensen, one-time publisher of the Spiritualist of New York\u2014of which an A.M. Robinson was listed as an owner.
