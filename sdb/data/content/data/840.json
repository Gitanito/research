Publisher: Common Sense Publishing Company.  Editor: J.L. Schaffer.\r\n 1\/1, August 1906-(?)  20 pp., 5 1\/3 x 6.\n\n The journal's policy, announced in its first issue, was \"to keep within the limits of common sense in every department\"-a claim perhaps cast in doubt by its emphasis on astrology and by an article by Alexander J. McIvor-Tyndall on \"Prophecy and Prediction.\"  The journal advocated a pure strain of New Thought: \"If we are true to Nature and her principles, there can and will be no limit to our Health,\" and published a series of Common Sense Rules to enable the reader to be true to Nature: \"To eat pure food in moderation; to be clean in living; to drink pure water in abundance, with regular bathing; and to have confidence, without fear, anger, malice, revenge, dishonesty, jealousy or strife, will bring about Health, Happiness and Prosperity.\"  Poems by Grace M. Brown.  As a premium, the journal offered its reprint of The Higher Socialism, book and a year's subscription for $1.00.
