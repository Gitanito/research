He began doing psi research under Thelma Moss at UCLA in 1969 where he remained until 1978, founding the university\u2019s first parapsychology laboratory. Taff claims to have investigated around 4,500 cases of ghosts, hauntings, and poltergeists over a period of four decades, while also conducting research in telepathy and precognition.1\n\nTaff has described his research on numerous TV and radio programmes.  Entity Case\n\nIn the summer of 1974, Doris Bither, a mother of four, began experiencing seemingly supernatural phenomena, including the feeling of assault by an unseen presence. Kerry Gaynor, a parapsychologist, interviewed her that year, uncovering a history of abuse that was likely rooted in her troubled childhood. Tensions existed within her family, affecting her relationship with her four sons. Bither claimed attacks by both a primary entity and three male spirits. During subsequent investigations Taff documented numerous light anomalies, some of which appeared to respond to Gaynor\u2019s commands.\n\nTaff also photographed orbs and light phenomena around Bither, which decreased in frequency and intensity over the years (she died in 1995).2  Aliens Above, Ghosts Below\n\nAliens Above, Ghosts Below (2011) describes ghostly apparitions reported by families across Los Angeles, along with stories of UFO sightings, alien encounters, and abductee experiences. It features accounts of the \u2018San Pedro haunting\u2019 and the \u2018Entity\u2019 case that inspired a 1982 movie of the same name. It also includes scientific studies on telepathy and macro-psychokinesis, and lesser-known phenomena such as Kirlian Photography (claimed by some to capture the human aura or energy field). After examining the evidence, Taff explores explanatory models, from holographic brains to time travel and modern theoretical physics.3  Website\n\nhttps:\/\/barrytaff.net\/\n\nMichael Duggan  Literature\n\nMoss, T.,&nbsp;Eveloff, H.H., Chang, A.F.
