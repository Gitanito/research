He was educated in Vienna, where he studied engineering, but was obliged by lack of funds to leave before graduating. In 1926 he travelled to Jerusalem and worked as a journalist for the German newspaper group Ullstein-Verlag. He was later posted in Paris and then Berlin.\n\nKoestler joined the German Communist Party in 1931 believing that it was the only way to resist the rise of Nazism, but became disillusioned and resigned in 1938. He was imprisoned in Spain while working as a correspondent during the civil war; sentenced to death, he was released through the intervention of the British government.\n\nHe was interned in Paris as an \u2018undesirable alien\u2019 at the outbreak of World War II, and then again in the UK until 1941. His novel Darkness at Noon was published in English in that year. &nbsp;In 1942 he secured a job in the Ministry of Information and later travelled to &nbsp;Palestine as a correspondent for The Times.\n\nMade financially secure by his writings, Koestler was able after the war to purchase properties in France and the US, before settling in Montpelier Square, London. He continued to travel and write extensively about political issues. In November 1960 he was elected to a Fellowship of The Royal Society of Literature.\n\nIn April 1968 he was awarded the Sonning Prize for his outstanding contribution to European culture. He received an honorary doctorate from Queen's University, Kingston, Canada. In 1972 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\n\nIn 1976 he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease and in 1980 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Around this time he founded the KIB Society together with Brian Inglis and Tony Bloomfield (the name is based on their initials), to promote research outside of conventional science; this later became the Koestler Foundation.\n\nKoestler, a vice-president of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, wrote a pamphlet on suicide.1 He and his wife Cynthia killed themselves on 1 March 1983 with an overdose of the barbiturate Tuinal taken with alcohol.  Psychical Research\n\nKoestler became interested in the paranormal after experiencing psychical phenomena at an early age.  \n\nA solitary, rather frustrated child, he was reading alone in a room of a Viennese pension, when a tin of baked beans suddenly exploded and hit him on the head, after which some of his fellow boarders sought him out for \u2018table-turning sessions\u2019. As a grown man he was fascinated by a recurrent sense of an 'invisible writing', an elusive hidden meaning in what looked like coincidence. Already at 26 years old he was advertising in four daily papers for verifiable \u2018reports on ... telepathy, clairvoyance, levitation etc.\u2019 and though he received no more than 35 not very satisfactory replies, he experienced two incidents of the kind himself.2\n\nKoestler recognized the importance of scientific methods of investigation and was \u2018irritated by the blind eye turned to its results in this connection by so many academics\u2019.3 He carried out informal experiments in levitation in his basement4 but otherwise did little actual research.\n\nKoestler describes this interest in his 1972 book The Roots of Coincidence (1972), which examines the idea that coincidences experienced as meaningful may not always happen by pure chance. &nbsp;He writes:  \n\nHalf of my friends accuse me of an excess of scientific pedantry; the other half of unscientific leanings towards preposterous subjects such as extra-sensory perception (ESP), which they include in the domain of the supernatural. However, it is comforting to know that the same accusations are levelled at an \u00e9lite of scientists, who make excellent company in the dock.5\n\nHe recounts the \u2018ascent of parapsychology towards scientific respectability\u2019, describing his visit to the Rhine Lab at Duke University and citing advances in the study of ESP.&nbsp; In a chapter titled \u2018The Perversity of Physics\u2019 he attempts to clarify Heisenberg\u2019s indeterminacy principle, comparing neutrinos with ghosts, not necessarily as a metaphor. Another chapter considers Paul Kammerer\u2019s Lamarckian beliefs in the \u2018inheritance of acquired characteristics\u2019,6 citing the predisposition of both Kammerer and Carl Jung to experience meaningful coincidences. Koestler also draws attention to Wolfgang Pauli\u2019s \u2018belief in non-causal, non-physical factors operating in nature\u2019 \u2013 namely \u2018seriality and synchronicity\u2019.7  Koestler Foundation\n\nIn 1980, Koestler created the KIB Society together with Brian Inglis (a journalist who had written extensively on paranormal research) and Tony Bloomfield. It was renamed the Koestler Foundation following his death in 1983 and oversaw the disbursement of around \u00a31 million, the bulk of his estate, which he directed should be used to fund parapsychological research. This eventually led to the creation of the Koestler Parapsychology Unit at Edinburgh University\u2019s psychology department, a research organization with its own chair, where many British parapsychologists gained their PhDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Works (selected)  Fiction\n\nThe Gladiators (1939).
