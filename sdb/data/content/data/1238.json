If the line of life runs fair and\nuninterrupted, the perfon will enjoy good health ;\nand according to its length towards the outfide\nof the forefinger, you can judge if the perfon\nwill live long, as the longer the line, the longer\nthe life.\nIf the line of death is fhortr, and runs even,\nwithout being broken or divided, it ihews that\n^ the perfon will enjoy a good length of days, and\nnot be\u00ab fubjefted to many maladies; but if,it is\ninterrupted, it evidently ihews that the perfon\nwill be endangered by illnefs, but by the care of\nprovidence will recover.
