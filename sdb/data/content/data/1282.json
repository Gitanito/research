It drew much of its material from New Thought (Chicago) and other books and series published by Sydney B. Flower's Psychical Research Company, including articles by a who's-who of New Thought\/occult authors of the period: Sydney Flower, Helen Van Anderson, William Walker Atkinson, A. Victor Segno, Elizabeth Towne, Kate A. Boehme, Fanny M. Harley, Eleanor Kirk, Paul Tyner, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Nancy McKay Gordon, Harry Gaze, Henry Harrison Brown, Hugh O. Pentecost, Helen Wilmans, Uriel Buchanan, C.W. Leadbeater, \"Adiramled\" (Delmar DeForest Bryan), \"Mabel Sifford\" (a typographical error for Mabel Gifford Shine), Evelyn Arthur \"Lee\" (a typological error for See), et al. -- most of whom advocated sexual energy (in whatever terms it was guised) as the driving force behind spiritual and psychic development.  Psychologischer Verlag (or sometimes Psychologischer Verlag Van Tuyl Daniels) also published its FlowersKollektion of New Thought books, articles and lessons, including several by Atkinson, and sold crystal balls, the \"Somnoskop\" (\"hypnosis by mechanical means\"  -- a wind-up revolving mirror), and ouija boards.  Daniels had been Flower's partner in Suggestive Therapeutics and fled Chicago (some say with the firm's money) when that journal ceased after the Post Office denied it access to bulk postage rates.  Flower and Daniels were said to have exchanged heated accusations of criminality and chicanery when they split up but they must have come to some accommodation to allow this journal and the other books of Psychologischer Verlag to be published.  The press continued until at least 1920.
