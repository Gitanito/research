His unpublished articles and extensive correspondence can be found in the SPR archives housed at Cambridge University Library. These include files devoted to the Trevor Hall court case in 1966; the mediums Annie Eva Fay, George Valiantine, William Eglinton and Rosina Mary Showers; and correspondence with James Randi, Arthur Koestler, ER Dodds and Eric Dingwall.\n\nGilbert wrote and collected articles on spiritualism in Brazil, ESP in the American airforce, precognition, and the \u2018Seaside Palmists\u2019.2\n\nGilbert also helped his friend and fellow SPR council member Eric Dingwall in the preparation of his book The Critic's Dilemma.3  Archive Work\n\nGilbert edited the SPR archives index, supervised by Mollie Goldney and ER Dodds,4 although this work had not been completed when he resigned from the SPR in 1973.\n\nHe also catalogued the collection of the Britten Memorial Library in Manchester, which was later transferred to the Spiritualists\u2019 National Union headquarters in Stansted, Essex.
