Five years later he returned to England to attend a school in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1948 he served in the police force in Palestine. He read English at King\u2019s College, Cambridge and took a master\u2019s degree at Birmingham University. After two years of private tutoring and then a further twelve years as a copywriter for an advertising agency he became a freelance writer. He married in 1956.\n\nEvans was an avid collector of photographs and illustrations of unusual phenomena. In 1964, jointly with his wife, he co-founded the Mary Evans Picture Library to house their joint collection of historical printed images.  Psychical Research\n\nEvans joined the Society for Psychical Research in the late 1960s, became a council member and served on the publications committee. Finding its ambit somewhat restricted, in 1981 he co-founded the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP), a research and educational foundation which extends its interests to anomalies such as UFOs and Fortean phenomena.1 He was also a member of the British UFO Research Association and the Folklore Society.\n\nEvans wrote extensively about ufology and the possibility of alien visitations, developing what he called a psycho-social hypothesis. This placed the witness, instead of some \u2018unknowable alien entity', at the centre of the experience, and viewed it in psychological and cultural terms,2 making it amenable to further study. He compared historical claimed encounters with fairies, demons, spirits and the like with more recent claimed accounts of encounters with extra-terrestrials.3 He also investigated subjects as diverse as the psychology of mass hysteria4 and claims that street-lights might be affected by a human presence.5\n\nHilary\u2019s willingness to give credence to paranormal claims brought criticism from sceptics such as Philip Klass6 and Christopher Scott.7 &nbsp;Other investigators, such as the author and UFO authority Clas Svahn, were impressed with his wealth of knowledge and scholarship.8  Archive\n\nEvans donated his huge book collection to the Archives for the Unexplained (AFU) in Sweden, whose focus is \u2018on the paranormal, occultism, spiritualism, religion, mythology, folklore and behavioural sciences\u2019.9  Works  Selected Books\n\nBeyond the Gaslight: Science in Popular Fiction, 1895-1905 (1976).
