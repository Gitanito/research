This was an extraordinary combination, and speaks well\nfor the comprehensive character of Professor Richet\u2019s activities. For\nobserve that a physiologist is wholly concerned with the material\nmechanism of the body, with its secretions, the effect of drugs upon\nit, with its nervous reactions, and with the working of its different\norgans. No explanation of its behaviour except in terms of this pro-\ncedure can be contemplated or even tolerated. Professor Richet is\nspeaking quite orthodox language when he says : \u201cI cannot believe\nthat memory can exist without the anatomical and physiological\nintegrity of the brain. Whenever there is no more oxygen, whenever\nthe temperature is either too low or too high, when there are a few\ndrops of atropine or morphine or chloroform introduced into the\nblood, whenever the course of cerebral irrigation is stopped\u2014memory\nalters and disappears.\u201d\nSooner than contemplate an explanation in psychic terms. Pro-\nfessor Richet, speaking for all or practically all physiologists, would\nprefer to have no hypothesis at all, and simply say that many of the\nfacts which we adduce in support of our views are merely evidence of\nwhat he calls \u201c cryptaesthesia,\u201d which \u201c can reveal to us fragments of\nthe real\u2014fragments which seem to have no connexion with space and\ntime.\u201d\nAnd further on he says :\n\u201c When I speak of cryptaesthesia I indi-\ncate a fact\u2014the perception of reality by extra-sensorial channels. I\ndo not seek to go beyond that, and as yet science has no right to go\nbeyond that.\u201d\n\f2 Oliver Lodge [part\nNevertheless he admits some extraordinary phenomena, extra-\nordinary facts, he says, that is to say Precognitions ;\n\u201c I by no means\ndeny the reality of certain premonitions ;\nI have quoted remarkable\nexamples of them which have happened to me personally : and in the\nannals of our science there are astonishing examples. ... It is an\nundeniable fact ;\nand it proves to us the sheer impossibility, as yet,\nof finding any explanation for metapsychic phenomena.\u201d\nThe quotations are from Vol. XXXIV of Proceedings, from a short\npaper by Professor Richet against the possibility of survival, wherein\nhe maintains \u201c that the most reasonable hypothesis is the unknown\nhypothesis X, which it will be for the future to develop\u201d.\nFor a review of Professor Richet\u2019s beliefs I wish to cite this whole\nvolume as giving incidentally evidence both for and against survival.\nIn it I review his great \u201c Traite de Metapsychique \u201d, which he hoped\nwould be used some day by any University course upon the subject\nand I concluded by a somewhat playful sequel as to the points on\nwhich we differed.\nHe has now presumably entered on that future existence estab-\nlished by our own investigations, and disbelieved in by him : and he\nwill perhaps try to communicate sooner or later, and will find himself\nup against those difficulties of establishing his identity which I there\nsummarise. (See vol. xxxiv. pages 100 to 104.)\nRichet not only admitted the truth of what he called \u201c subjective\nmetapsychics \u201d including the incomprehensible character of precog-\nnitions, he was ready to admit some of the phenomena of objective\nmetapsychics, and thoroughly accepted those which are commonly\nexplained in terms of ectoplasm, including telekinesis and material-\nisations, always however assuming that a materiahsation did not\nrepresent anything surviving but must be taken as representation of\nsomething which has existed but which no longer exists ;\nfor example,\na construction of the body or parts of the body of a deceased person.\nHe C|uite perceived that this is wholly contrary to the scientific know-\nledge of the time. He says that to admit it is to enter a world\nabsolutely unknown, and if some day we have to admit it we shall be\nplunged into an abyss of deeper and deeper mysteries. At present in\nhis opinion \u201c we have understood nothing, absolutely nothing, of all\nthese phenomena \u201d. And in that ignorance he is content to remain,\nthough he accepts the evidence for both the subjective and objective\nmetapsychics, as bare facts ;\nthat is to say for the psychical as well\nas the physical phenomena.\nIn accepting the facts without any explanation he shows a remark-\nable openness of mind superior to that of most of his colleagues.\nYet in refusing to contemplate a spiritistic hypothesis and retaining\n\f144]\n3\nIn Memory of Charles Richet\nthe agnostic position he puts himself in harmony with them and with\northodox science as at present imderstood. There is no doubt that\nthe views of orthodox science will some day have to change. It will\nhave to admit that it has been wholly wrong in limiting its attention\nto the material aspect of things, and as soon as the spiritual is gener-\nally accepted it will have revolutionised its procedure, and entered\non a path to which we can affix no limits and of which it is not easy\nto forecast the end.\nAnd now a few words concerning Richet the man. He was a\nspecially accomphshed man of science, and an orator whom it was a\nprivilege to hear ;\nhe was a brilliant conversationahst as well as a\nrenowned physiologist, and one who did not scruple to pursue truth\ninto regions which his colleagues, and indeed he himself, regarded as\nunpopular and absurd. As a man of letters and an appreciator of\ngood literature, he could hold his own, and many were the verses\nstored in his memory which he could pour forth at any opportunity.\nThrough F. W. H. Myers I made his acquaintance, and I had many\nopportunities of meeting him in the \u2019eighties and \u2019nineties of last\ncentury, when he came over to pay a visit to his great friends, Myers\nand his wife, at Leckhampton House, Cambridge. So it happened\nthat when Richet invited Myers to come and pay him a visit at the\nHe Riband, in the Mediterranean, off Hyffies, one summer in\nAugust when he was entertaining the physical medium, Eusapia\nPalladino, I was included in the invitation and travelled to the South\nof France in the company of Myers. There I had my first opportunity\nof seeing some of the physical phenomena of Spiritualism, well dis-\nplayed under exceptionally good circumstances. The main room of\nthe house on the island was converted into a seance room and kept\nfor the purpose. There we sat each evening for a couple of hours, and\nthe phenomena occurred just as if some confederate had been intro-\nduced into the room and was free to walk about, clutch at the people\npresent, and move things ;\nbut no confederate was present or was\npossible under the circumstances, and I became gradually convinced\nthat certain phenomena had occurred, of which I have given some\naccount in the book Past Years, as part of my autobiography. My\nrecord was sent home, and was ultimately printed in the Journal of\nthe S.P.R., vol. vi, pp. 306-360.\nDuring the day, and at meals, I had the opportunity of hearing a\ntorrent of brilfiant conversation between Myers and Richet, Myers\nthoroughly convinced of survival, and Richet, as is well known, not\naccepting that view, even as explanatory of the mental phenomena.\nTo the end, Richet in public remained an agnostic and a disbeliever\n\f4 Oliver Lodge [part 144\nin the spiritual explanation. In private, he has confessed to me that\nhe was sometimes nearly bowled over by the evidence ;\nbut, on the\nwhole, he adhered to his lifelong conviction of the materialistic aspect\nof the universe. His scientific reputation was thereby saved, and his\nexperience was all the more valuable because it testified only to the\nbare facts, which, although admittedly incredible from the scientific\npoint of view, were not employed to bolster up any spiritualistic\nhypothesis. On those terms we agreed to differ, and yet remained\nclose friends. He lost a favourite son in the war, but held no com-\nmunication with him, though at times sorely tempted to do so.\nIn telling me of his latest book in July 1932 he wrote :\n\u201c IlE RiBAUD\u2014GtIENS\nPar Hyeres (Var).\nMon CHER Oliver,\nMerci de votre lettre. Bien entendu tout ce qui touche le\nS.P.R. me va au cmur.\nJe vais publier un hvre intitule La Grande Esperance. Et, sans\netre resolument spirite dans le sens de Conan Doyle et Allan Kardec,\nje me rapproche insensiblement de vos idees. Vous dirai-je\u2014ce qui\nest rigoureusement vrai\u2014que votre profonde et scientifique convic-\ntion a eu grande influence, tres grande influence.\nToutes mes amities fideles a vous et a vos chers enfants.\nCharles Richet.\u201d\nThis is an indication and a justiflcation of what I mean when I say\nthat he felt drawn towards the hypothesis of survival more than he\npermitted himself to express in face of his life-long study of physio-\nlogy and the material view of the nature of man.\nIn his physiology he studied chiefly the ordinary processes of\nnutrition in health and disease: he was joint discoverer of the serum\ntreatment; and he received a Nobel prize for his investigation of the\ndetailed effect of drugs which is known as \u201c anaphylaxis \u201d. At a\ntime when the great physiologist Sir Michael Foster was President of\nthe British Association at Dover, Richet was invited to come over to\ngive one of the two evening discourses in French ;\nand brilliantly he\ndid it, keeping his whole audience spellbound by the beauty of the\nlanguage and its delivery.\nAssisted by Madame Richet, he lived a complete family life ;\nit was very interesting to drop in on a Sunday afternoon and find him\nsurrounded by a large family, sons and daughters-in-law. As to\nmyself I can truly say that his attitude to me was like that of a\nbrother.\n\fIN MEMORY OF EVERARD FEILDING\nBy E. N. Beknett\nI FIRST met Everard Feilding in Oxford nearly 40 years ago, when\nI was in residence as a Fellow of Hertford. He was at that time\ndeeply interested in the movement to encourage young Cathohcs to\nenter the University and in this connexion visited the city from\ntime to time. On these occasions he frequently dined with me, and\nhis bright and interesting conversation made him always a welcome\nvisitor to our Senior Common Room.\nA year or two before, I had, through conversations with Frederic\nMyers, become deeply interested in the work of the Psychical Re-\nsearch Society, and Everard and I found ourselves on common\nground from the start. He was always ready and willing to share in\nany investigations and in addition to various visits to alleged\n\u201c haunted houses \u201d (including Brockley Court) we held sittings with\nMrs Corner, (nee Florence Cook) and a number of physical mediums.\nThese special researches of ours were full of interest and on one or\ntwo occasions produced phenomena which we found it difficult to\nexplain ;\nbut in general they proved futile or, at best, inconclusive.\nFeilding had, however, like myself, been taught by Myers\u2019 example\nand precept that it was worth while to explore any really well\nattested phenomena on the off chance of finding some grains of gold\namong the dross.\nThere ran indeed throughout the whole of Feilding\u2019s work in\nPsychical Research a note of cheerful optimism, so characteristic of\nhis free and forceful personality. Whenever I shared in his vigils in\nhaunted houses, or sat with him to test the alleged phenomena of\na materiahsation seance, the tedium and generally disappointing\nresults of such experiences were almost forgotten in such company as\nhis. He was always ready to disregard the waste of time and money,\nto laugh at the exposure of trickery, and to suggest by way of con-\nsolation that after all we had gained some further knowledge of\nmediumistic psychology. Some critics might suggest, perhaps, that\nthis characteristic of Feilding\u2019s indicated a rather frivolous approach\nto a serious subject but I feel on reflection, that such an attitude may\nreally in the case of certain types of mind act as a saving grace. On\none occasion in excusing himself from approaching the investigation\nof EusapiaPalladino\u2019s phenomena \u201c in alight\u2014shall I sayeven flippant\n\f6 E. W. Bennett [part 144\nspirit,\u201d lie added, \u201c I sometimes think that in this way alone one can\npreserve one\u2019s mental balance in dealing with this kind of subject.\u201d\nNevertheless, under this superficial impression of occasional flip-\npancy, Feilding concealed a very deep and serious enthusiasm. In\n1908 he took a leading part in the Palladino experiments at Naples\nand produced a report in common with Messrs Carrington and Bag-\ngally of profound interest and value. He became convinced at some\nof the Eusapia sittings of \u201c the reality of the phenomena and the exist-\nence of some force not generally recognised, which was able to\nimpress itself upon, or create the appearance of matter.\u201d\nEverard shared to the full that absorbing motive which inspired\nthe life work of Frederic Myers\u2014an ardent desire to secure a scien-\ntific proof of man\u2019s survival after death. In an admirable paper con-\ntributed to the Dublin Eeview in 1925, he summed up the case as\nfollows :\n\u201c It is only by the patient accumulation of facts, disregard-\ning sources of error which experience gradually indicates, that ulti-\nmately a probability can be built up which in the end becomes so\nprobable as to exclude any other reasonable conclusion.\u201d He sat\nnext to me at our Jubilee Dinner and told me how deeply he felt the\nimportance of Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s wonderful message.\nOn one occasion I managed to get Everard to go with me to a\nremote island in the Lofoden Group which I leased for sport. He\nshot and fished more, I think, to please me than himself, and on one\noccasion when some fish had been pilfered from our boat, Feilding\njoined some farmers at a seance to discover the culprit\u2019s name. Dur-\ning this visit I realised once more Feilding\u2019s extraordinary gift for\nlanguages. Within ten days he had learnt enough Norwegian to talk\nto the islanders with some facility, and what is more, to understand a\ngood deal of their Lofoden patois. Feilding loved his sojourn in this\ndelectable island, and after our long hours in the open we sat in my\nwooden house beside the peat fires talking of many things.\nifjLvqodrjv S\u2019 ooaaKLs dixcjiOTepoi\n'pXiov iv Aeuyp KocTeSvaccjjiev\nbut always returning sooner or later to our great mutual interest.\nPsychical Research.\nWhen I last saw my old friend, exactly a fortnight before his death,\nhis nund seemed as cheerful and as vigorous as ever.

N. M. Tyrrell\nMr Whately Carington\u2019s able work, in carrying the quantitative\nmethod of research into the investigation of trance-personalities,\nraises a very fundamental question, viz., \u201c What do we mean by in-\ndividuality ?\n\u201d Do word-associations, reaction-times or psycho-\ngalvanic reflexes characterise that in the personality which is essen-\ntially the \u201c I \u201d ? Or do they characterise those subconscious levels\nof the self, which in psychical research we call the \u201c Subliminal \u201d ?\nOr do they characterise only the physiological and nervous mech-\nanism of the organism ? Or do they characterise a synthetic unit,\nwhich comprises all three of these ?\nIn my ignorance of the technique of this method of research as\nused in normal psychology, I am assuming that they are supposed\nto characterise the latter ;\nthat is to say, what in common language\nwe call the \u201c person.\u201d How definitely and consistently does a set of\nreaction-times characterise such a person ? Here, again, I do not\nknow : but the Gatty experiment would seem to indicate that it\ncannot characterise such a total, synthetic personality with anything\nhke the same definiteness with which the thumb-print characterises\nthe body ;\nfor reaction-times can be changed by a mere act of\nvolition.\nThat is one point. Another is that, assuming survival of death,\nthere must, at death, be some disintegration or at least re-synthesis\nof the elements of the personal complex. Somewhere this complex\nmust be severed and its surviving elements presumably readjusted.\nTo our bodily senses it appears that the physical part only is sundered\nfrom the rest and left behind ; but we do not know how much more\nmay be happening, which our senses tell us nothing about. We do\nnot know, for instance, how much of what we call the \u201c Subliminal\n\u201d\nor the \u201c Unconscious \u201d may enter into a new combination and survive\nwith the ego : or whether only the individual self or pure ego sur-\nvives. It may be that much of the self below the threshold of con-\nsciousness survives, with its habits, dispositions and complexes, as\nSpirituahsts seem to believe. Or it may be that none of it, or but\nhttle, does. On the answers to these questions depends the signifi-\ncance we must attach to reaction-time tests and similar quantitative\n7\n\f8 G. N. M. Tyrrell [part\nexperiments. I do not mean to say that the validity of Mr Caring-\nton\u2019s work depends on the answers to these questions. He has\nmerely found out what significant differences in reaction-times, etc.\nexist ;\nand this we need to know in any case. But, when it comes to\ninterpreting these differences, we must be profoundly influenced by\nthe ideas we hold on the nature of personality and individuality.\nHence an intensive discussion of this subject seems very desirable ;\nand I should like to see it undertaken by those who are more com-\npetent to do it than myself.\nWhat is Individuality or the \u201c I-ness \u201d of the self ;\nand on what\ndoes it depend ? First of all, has our individuality anything to do\nwith the fact that we five in independent bodies, which are spatially\nseparated from one another ? Common sense (which has an amazing\npower of persuading us that a thing is as clear as daylight when it is\nreally as obscure as night) certainly suggests to us that people are\nindividuals, at least partly, because they are spatial units and five in\nspatially separated bodies. In fact, it goes further, and bestows a\nkind of pseudo-individuahty on inanimate objects themselves,\nsimply because they are spatially separated from one another. A\nchair, for instance, we usually sj^eak of as being the possessor of such\nand such qualities and characteristics, thereby according it that kind\nof individuality which constitutes it a possessing subject ;\nwhereas a\nblock of water ideally outlined in the sea is just \u201c stuff.\u201d The\nsequence of ideas seems to be ; (1) We are conscious individuals.\n(2) We live in separate bodies. (3) We should not be individuals if\nwe were not separated from one another. (4) Chairs, stones, etc. are\nvisibly separated from one another. (5) Therefore they must possess\nsome sort of individuality.\nBut, why should we regard inorganic objects as separate subjects\nat all ? We are surrounded by a continuous, though not homo-\ngeneous, environment of matter ;\nand the surfaces of things, which\nmark them off from one another to the senses, are merely sense-\nindications of a qualitative difference in the substance of this con-\ntinuum. Why is the inorganic universe to be regarded as a many\nrather than as a one % It is difficult to see any reason, except that of\npractical convenience, why we should not S|)eak of it as one subject-\npossessor of many quahties ? Spatial separateness alone cannot\nconfer any sort of individuality.\nBut, if that be granted, may we not maintain that the conscious\nindividuality of human beings depends, not on spatial separateness,\nbut on separateness of another kind ? May we not say that it\ndepends on a numerical separateness arising out of the fact that the\nthoughts, mental content and, in general, all the experiences belong-\n\f144]\nIndividuality\ning to each individual are private to that individual and inaccessible\nto any other ;\nand that this constitutes a conscious being a numerical\nunit and hence an individual ?\nIt is at this point that the work of psychical research looks as if it\nmight have something to say on the subject. At first sight, tele-\npathy seems to challenge this alleged privacy of individual experience\nby making it seem probable that an experience of the agent\u2019s is\nactually shared by the percipient. But Dr Broad, who has dealt with\nthis interesting question in his Presidential Address, has shown that\nit is possible to explain telepathy without having recourse to any\nbreach of what he refers to as the principle of \u201c Unique Ownership of\nExperiences.\u201d There might be a process of Interaction between the\nagent and the percipient, which induced in the latter an experience\nsimilar to, but not identical with, that of the agent. In this way the\npercipient would not actually share or directly enjoy the identical\nexperience which the agent enjoyed. He would have an experience\nof his own, similar to the agent\u2019s, but yet remaining his unique and\nprivate possession ;\nwhile the agent\u2019s experience would be similarly\nprivate to, and uniquely owned by, himself. In the present state of\nour ignorance of the modus ojjerandi of telepathy, we have no way of\ndeciding this point experimentally.\nThere is a sort of half-way house in the matter, which Dr Broad\nalso explains in his Address. It is possible, in some cases, that what\nappears at first sight to be the direct prehension by two minds of the\nsame experience may be in reality the direct prehension by two minds\nof the same immediate object of experience. But I find it difficult to\nsee how this explanation can be applied to cases in which the tele-\npathic experience of the percipient is that of feeling within himself\nthe whole mood and emotional tone of the agent, such as frequently\noccurs in practice.\nBut, when we come to cases of dual or multiple personality (not to\nmention the problems raised in trance-communications) the question\nof whether there is or is not a breach of the principle of the Unique\nOwnership of Experiences presents itself in a more acute form.\nSuppose, in a case of dual personality, that A is a secondary person-\nality, co-conscious with the primary personahty B, but remaining in\nthe background. A gives evidence of knowing B\u2019s thoughts and of\nsharing B\u2019s experiences. Can we plausibly explain the relation be-\ntween A and B on the theory of Interactional Telepathy ? We\nhave here two individualities, and on the theory we are considering,\nthe individuahty of each depends on the numerical separateness of\nits content of experience. There cannot, on this theory, be such a\nthing as an experience which is common to two minds. Well, here\n\f10 G. N. M. Tyrrell [part\nagain, our ignorance prevents us from dogmatising ;\nall we can say\nis that it looks uncommonly as if there were a sharing of experience.\nAnd what has the interactional theory to say about the cure of such\na case, when the two individualities seem to become one ? Can this\nhappen without involving the process which Dr Broad calls \u201c Inter-\nmental Confluence \u201d ?\nAssuming for the sake of argument that intermental confluence\ncan take place, in what way would it influence our ideas of indivi-\nduality ? Take A and B, two individuals, at first numerically\nseparated from one another by the privacy of their experiences, but\nafterwards (perhaps in a disembodied state) sharing all their experi-\nences in common : so that each directly shares all the experiences of\nthe other as well as his own. What effect will this abolition of the\nunique privacy of the experience of each have on the individualities\nof A and B ? Will the fact that all the experience of one is identified\nwith all the experience of the other result in the obhteration of either\nor both as individualities, by removing any criterion for distin-\nguishing A from B ? It may be said that there is now no means of\nidentifying two centres of consciousness, and therefore that A has\nbeen annihilated and only B remains ;\nor else vice versa. Or, it may\nbe said, that both A and B have been annihilated and that a third\nindividuality C, enjoying all the experiences of both, has taken their\nplace. In general, this view would seem to indicate that if n indi-\nvidualities share all their experiences in common, this must result in\nthe extinction of at least n- \\ of them.\nThese suggestions strike me as being quite unplausible and absurd.\nIf A\u2019s experience is enriched by the addition of B\u2019s, it seems mon-\nstrous to assert that this will have the effect of annihilating A.\nAnother suggestion which might be made is that, with the pooling\nof the experiences of a number of individuals, all the individualities\nconcerned will disappear, merging into a kind of vaguely conceived\n\u201c psychic continuum.\u201d But, this is surely going from bad to worse.\nIt has the air of capitulation before a difficulty. This is a reversion\nto a purely mechanical mode of thought. The mind, brought up on\nthe data of its senses, oscillates between the two conceptions of\natomic plurality on the one hand and a continuum on the other.\nBut both these ideas seem ultimately to be derived from the experi-\nence or conception of space, the idea of atomism being derived from\nthe mutually exclusive aspect of space and the idea of a continuum\nfrom its prehensive aspect.\nWhat all this points to, surely, is that we are on the wrong track\nin assuming that numerical separateness hes at the root of indivi-\nduality. As a theory it leads to conclusions which do not square with\n\f144]\nIndividuality 11\nthe experience of being an individual. If we suppose that indivi-\nduality does not depend on numerical separateness, we might define\nit as just the irreducible character of conscious being, without at-\ntempting to define the latter further. Why should not consciousness\nbe as irreducible a characteristic of one kind, or phase, of being as\nextendedness is of another ? Then the sharing of experience by two\nindividualities, originally numerically separate, although it removes\nthe ground for drawing a numerical distinction between them, does\nnot impair their qualitative individuality or the \u201c I-ness \u201d of their\nconsciousness. It would seem that we must be wrong in speaking of\nindividuality in the plural ;\nand equally wrong in spealing of it in the\nsingular. Individuality would be something not subject to the cate-\ngory of number. It is true that one cannot form any intellectual\nconception of such a thing ;\nbut why should one exjrect to be able\nto ? Why should we assume that nature will obligingly fit into the\nconceptual framework which she has provided for us for purposes\nquite other than the attainment of ultimate truth 1 It may be that\non these lines we shall best make a beginning in the realisation that\nthe universe is not ultimately pluralistic.\nThe numerical, as well as spatial, separateness possessed by\nembodied human beings, with which we are so famihar, would then\nhave to be regarded, not as constituting the basis of individuality,\nbut as having been bestowed on the total personality by its non-\nconscious and less essential elements.\nIt is sometimes stated that individuahty is dependent on memory\n\u2014not on a complete and continuous chain of memory\u2014but it is said\nthat, if a person were to lose his memory entirely, he would cease to\nbe the same individual. But here, again, we come up against diffi-\nculties. This seems to be another attempt to base individuality on a\nnumerically separate possession. Suppose that an individual A, at a\nparticular moment in time, were to lose all memory of his experiences\nup to that moment. On the view that individuality is dependent on\nmemory, A would cease to exist as an individual from this moment,\nand would be replaced by a new individual B, who would inhabit the\nbody formerly occupied by A. B\u2019s experiences and memories would\nstart from the moment in time when A\u2019s ceased. But now, suppose\nthat, at a later moment, all the memories which A had lost returned\nto B. (Partial returns of memory of this kind are not uncommon.)\nB would now become A without ceasing to be B ;\nand this sounds to\nme quite absurd. Changes in the self occur during sleejj and apparent\ncessations of the self occur during periods of unconsciousness ;\nbut\nthese do not in any way impair our belief in the identity of our\nindividuality. It is very hard to believe that individuality is\n\f12 G. N. M. Tyrrell [part 144\ndependent on the continuity of memory. It is not even easy to\nregard individuality as enduring in time or as being dependent on\ntemporal continuity. It may be that temporal endurance and\ntemporal change are less fundamental than the nature of indivi-\nduality, being partly a mode of appearance, which arises out of a\nrelational nexus into which that very individuality enters as subject.\nIt may be that, when we think we are witnessing the fleeting and un-\nstable nature of conscious individuality, we are in reality witnessing\nthe unstable synthesis of a personality composed of widely differing\nand all but incompatible elements. It is always through such a per-\nsonality that the individuality of others manifests itself to us ;\nand\nit is always on such a personality that the nature of our own subjec-\ntive experience depends.\nIf we are seeking a test for individuality, how do we know that\nsuch tests as associations and reaction-times are valid for the pur-\npose ? For if these happen to characterise, as their use in ordinary\nlife imphes, not the individuality, but the synthetic personality,\n(what we call in common life the \u201c person \u201d) it seems hkely enough\nthat an individuality manifesting in its own body in life would give\ndifferent reaction-times from those it would give in its natural state\nafter death, (if the test could then be applied) and different again\nfrom those it would give if manifesting through a medium.\n\fREVIEW\nThrough a Strangers Hmids. New Evidence of Survival, compiled by\nNea Walker. Foreword by Sir Oliver Lodge. Hutchinson,\npp. 432. 16s. net.\nIn a well-known theological work lately published on the future\nlife the authority gives a paragraph to psychical research. He has\nstudied the records, he informs his readers, and they may be assured\nsuch are negligible. He makes the usual remark that all the material\nis on the face of it of such a trivial nature that it may safely be\ndismissed. Here we are faced with the common obstacle which\nspeciahsation has put in the path of science progress\u2014few men in\none science know of the latest advance in another. When they\nwould review the whole front, outside their speciality, they fall back\non work which has been superseded. This latest compilation of Miss\nWalker is an advance. Those who read The Bridge, whether they\nwere disconcerted or concerted by it, realised here was material\nwhich would complicate our view of the universe and consciousness.\nIt is worth noting in passing that sometimes we forget, when we are\ndiscounting (as we should) the will to beheve, that there is a comple-\nmentary discount to be made against the will to disbelieve, a wdll\nprompted by the strong wish to have a simple world to deal with, to\nobserve the Law of Parsimony. Mechanism is the simplest world\npicture man has ever had. Hence a longing to preserve it. Against\nThe Bridge could then be brought (with reUef by the simplists : with\nreservation of judgment by the rest) the fact that telepathic leakage\nwas certainly possible. No psychical researcher needs to be told that\ntelepathy can never be ruled out as a possible explanation of all\npara-normal knowledge. The point at issue is at what point does the\ntelepathy become so complicated that (this time on the other side)\nthe Law of Parsimony turns up and Occam\u2019s razor begins to cut in\nthe opposite direction. Miss Walker\u2019s technique was simple but\neffective in complicating the telepathic hypothesis. She received\nabout a specific dead person, personally unknown to her, only such few\ndistinctive facts as would permit her to recognise it was about them\nthe medium was speaking, should the medium refer to them at all.\nThese facts she wrote out in letter form, read out when she was by\nherself, then posted the letter so read out, to Mrs Sidgwick to file as\n13\n\f14 Review [part\nevidence. After that she travelled to have a sitting with Mrs Leonard,\nwho of course knew nothing of the particular reason for this sitting.\nThen, like a good naturalist. Miss Walker sat waiting for any reply.\nThe replies are here. Quite apart from the fact that this is a new\ntechnique which makes the telepathic hypothesis much more com-\nplicated and also confirms the bona fides of the whole procedure, the\nmaterial itself is probably as remarkable as any that has been avail-\nable to public inspection. The three sittings at which information\npurported to come from a doctor who committed suicide : the\nsittings at which a child killed in the burning of the Georges Philippar\nis claimed to be communicating : such records, quite apart from the\nstringent conditions under which they were received, make it quite\nimpossible for such records to be dismissed, because on the face of it\nthey are trivial and lacking in character. What conclusions then are\npossible 1\nThe first will, for most researchers, be telepathic. It will, however,\nhave to be owned that the old and popular idea of telepathy\u2014one\nmind transmitting directly to another\u2014is shown by these records to be\nas mistaken as the President\u2019s address demonstrated it to be. When\nthere is given evidence which is neither known to sitter nor medium\nand those possessed of it do not know the sitting is taking place and\nmay be far distant, the telepathic hypothesis becomes richly com-\nplex. When to that richness is added the consistent character of the\ncommunicator, often rejecting suggestions which are \u201c out of char-\nacter \u201d and showing pecuharities of personality, we have, instead of\na simple skein of memories somehow hanging together and so hauled\nup by medium and sitter, something much more exactly to be\ndescribed as an individual communicator. That naturally persuades\nmany investigators to adopt the second possible conclusion \u201c con-\nventional survival \u201d. On this side, however, we must put the con-\nfusions, vaguenesses and inaccuracies. They exist as well as the\nevidential material. They may be due to the medium\u2019s mind con-\nfusing transmission, on the other hand they may be due to no clear\npersonality being present. A third provisional conclusion is then\npossible.\nIt grows increasingly probable that if consciousness survives the\nbody it must do so under conditions largely incommunicable to us\nstill incarnate. Further, when a mind which is so surviving would\nmake contact with us it would have to \u201c recondense \u201d, recondition\nitself. Existing say in some state analagous to the diffused state\nwater can take on when it becomes steam, it would have to turn\nitself back into the definiteness of a hailstone. Such an effort would\nbe difficult and the \u201c frozen \u201d state precarious for a droplet which\n\f144] Revieiv 15\nlacked a normal condensation-point or nucleus. Certainly, reading\nthese records, there is the feeling of a focus sharpening and fading as\nthough it could only be retained for a few moments with any\ndistinctness.\nAll conclusions, however, are obviously premature. Two things\ncan be said : one is that Psychical Research is advancing, is enlarg-\ning our conception of what consciousness is : the other is that no one\nshould venture to talk about survival, pro or con, till this book has\nbeen studied. Apart from all else Mr Richmond\u2019s sparse classifica-\ntory comments give these collections a peculiar value.\nGerald Heard.\nMRS HENRY SIDGWICK\nAn Obituary of Mrs Henry Sidgwick by Miss Alice Johnson is in\npreparation and will be published shortly in Proceedings.\n31346?\n\f\u00bb7\n-y i V\n.. *\ni' 'i'i\n' \u2022\u2022\nV-' .^\u2022\u2022^\n\u2022' 'V\u00a3iiu\u00bb\nt\n,\n'\n- \/ *\u2022\n*f\n'\n.\n\/f, ,\ni\ni\n*.. 1\n4\n'\ni\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 145\nPRELIMINARY STUDIES OF THE RECORDED LEONARD\nMATERIAL\nBy Kenneth Richmond\nI\nNotes on the Psychological Formation of Leonard Communicators\nIn approaching the problem of communicator-personality as it\nappears in Mrs Leonard\u2019s recorded trance-material, I have adopted\ncertain fluid hyjiotheses which should be put down to start with.\nFirst, I adopt, provisionally, a view which is supported in part by\nMr fVhately Carington\u2019s quantitative investigations, that we are\ndealing with two chief psychological mechanisms : one an organised\nand habitual secondary personality, which is usually (I do not say\nalways) the vehicle for the Feda control ;\nand the other a dramatis-\ning function of the primary trance-mind, which adapts itself to\nbecome the vehicle for the different communicators. In saying\n\u201c vehicle \u201d, I free myself from any suspicion of thinking that\n\u201c secondary personality \u201d, or \u201c dramatic pose \u201d (to adopt Mr\nCarington\u2019s useful phrase), can explain or characterise the impulses\nthat operate through these mechanisms.^\nBut these concepts can suggest an explanation, at once, for a\ncuriously dual and fluctuating technique of the trance-mind,\nthrough which the impulse of communication for the most part\noperates. Sometimes Feda seems to be speaking, sometimes the\ncommunicator, sometimes you cannot be grammatically sure which,\nthough in the context the question is not often in doubt. But Feda\nis regularly found speaking on behalf of the communicator. Why ?\nSimply because the habitually organised mechanism works the\n^ \u201c For every mental event the question must be raised as to the origin of\nthe efiective energies.\u201d K. Lewin, Psychol. Forsch. 7, p. 313.\nB 17\n\f18 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nmore easily ? I think that this is one reason, hut that there is\nanother. A secondary personahty appears\u2014and the appearance is\nconfirmed by Mr Carington\u2019s results\u2014to have paths of association\nopen for use which in the primary personality are impeded by\nsystems of resistance and inhibition. (Mrs Leonard in the normal\nwaking state obviously would not run on as Feda does, and the\nFeda mind seems in many ways to run along different tracks.)\nThe impulse of communication, wherever it comes from, thus has\ntwo alternative systems of free association through which it can\noperate, and the systems are \u201c countersimilar \u201d, to borrow Mr\nCarington\u2019s term : one is complementary to the other. An idea or\nphrase that will not come to expression through one system, may be\nswitched over to the other set of tracks and so reach its destination.\nI am taking it as a working hypothesis that this continually happens\nin Leonard material. This is not to reject the possibility that a\nfugitive and scrappy form of utterance may be part of a defence-\nmechanism. It does, in poor sittings, provide a way of slipping out\nof difficulties. But equally, in good sittings, it seems to provide a\nway of slipping into a train of association that leads to an evidential\nremark.\nWhen a communicator appears to assume \u201c direct control \u201d, the\ntendency of the thought-stream to be switched to and fro largely\ndisappears. The utterance may be scrappy in many instances, but\nthe scraps hang together in natural sequence. Impressions of\ncharacter and specific personality, which are recognised by the\nsitter or subsequent verifier, become more frequent ;\nbut on the\nother hand, when evidential detail is attempted, \u201c forgetting \u201d and\nother mental blank patches shown by the communicator become\nmore frequent also. I am not yet sure how this situation is affected\nas the \u201c direct control \u201d improves in apparent quality, when it\nbecomes more strongly organised with time and practice ;\nbut it\nseems to me that the improvement consists more in steering round\nthe limitations of the vehicle than in removing them. The ease\nwith which evidence of paranormal faculty is produced seems to be\ndefinitely and permanently decreased in the case of \u201c direct con-\ntrol \u201d, as though flexibility in switching on to the necessary associa-\ntions of idea and phrase had partly disappeared. The hypothesis\nseems to be of use that in this case one-half only of a two-way\nsystem of association is operating, the \u201c dramatisation \u201d half,\nequipped with those association-tracks only which are open to the\nprimary trance-^aersonality, while the secondary trance-personality,\nthe vehicle for Feda, is in abeyance.\nThis theory of a two-way system through which the impulse of\n\f145] the Recorded Leonard Material 19\ncommunication can work may be of psychological interest, if\nfurther examination of facts does not show it to be fallaciously\nsimple. It is a matter of common experience in psychology that\ndefinite boundaries between this and that process turn out to mark\nconvenient divisions in the psychologist\u2019s system of ideas, rather\nthan distinct areas in his field of observation. But Mr Carington\u2019s\nvaluable and objective demonstration of countersunilarity between\nthe Feda-vehicle (if he will let me use this phrase) and the ordinary\nsystem of association-tracks in the Leonard mind gives us the clear\nfact that the machinery exists. My conjecture about the way it\nworks may or may not turn into a useful instrument for qualitative\nanalysis. An interesting question for further study Avill be whether\nthe striking ability for precise clairvoyant description of objects,\nwhich is characteristic of Feda at her best, seems to be expressed\nthrough the \u201c Feda-vehicle \u201d alone. It will complicate the theory\nif Feda seems at times to use both vehicles, as is quite probable.\nPsychological formations have a way of straying outside the dia-\ngrams marked out for them on paper. And it is difficult to say\nwhen Feda is really to be taken as operating alone. In most good\ncases of the clairvoyance of objects, a communicator-personaUty is\nsaid to be co-operating closely in the process of getting the descrip-\ntion through.^\nSo far I have touched on hypotheses about the mental mechanisms\nthrough which expression is given to the hnpulse to communicate.\nI am not specially concerned with the impulse to convey informa-\ntion of paranormal origin. It is my business, in this paper, to give\nmaximum weight to hypotheses of extra-sensory perception, where\nthere is evidence for these, in order to be as clear as possible on the\npoint whether anything beyond extra-sensory perception needs to\nbe assumed. But we shall be neglecting evidence if we fail to take\nnotice of one curious fact about the impulse to transmit extra-\nsensory perceptions. When these phenomena are being investigated\nfor their own sake, and isolated from what I will call the communi-\ncator-impulse, the range of success both in quantity and quality\nseems to be definitely limited, in comparison with the successes\nobserved when communicator-impulse is present. The history of\nexperimental telepathy had produced a strong impression that this\nhmitation existed, and recent quantitative work such as Professor\nRhine\u2019s\u2014confirmed by that of Mr Tyrrell with a more discriminating\ntechnique but a sunilar method of assessment\u2014shows a pecuhar\n^ e.g. the incident of the Adeline Genee statuette, Proc., vol. xxxi, Part\n81, p. 386 et seq. Good examples of clairvoyance by Feda when apparently\noperating alone seem to be all in unpubhshed material.\nb2\n\f20 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\ntendency of successes to hover aliout an average of 10% above\nchance, ^^dly there should be a threshold at al:)Out 30%, when\nchance-ex])ectation is 20%, tloes not appear ;\nbut the nature of the\nlimitation may be provisionally explained (with some backing from\nthe behaviour of Mr Carington\u2019s figures) as a difficulty of the mind\nin admitting extra-sensory perceptions into what might well be a\nconfusing competition with normal perceptions. It is a possible\nconjecture that 10% is about the proportion of elementary \u201c intui-\ntional \u201d judgments which the mind is organised to admit into its\neveryday workings. (I refer to the quite ordinary and unspecialised\n\u201c intuitional \u201d acts of the mind which seem, as a grouping, to shade\noff into instinctive acts and are often roughly descriljed as instinc-\ntive.) E.S.P. expeiiments with young children and people from\nprimitive races might show interesting variations.\nIn the study of phenomena where communicator-impulse is\npresent, the 2:>icture appears to change completely. Numerical\nassessment is hitherto lacking of extra-sensory successes that occur\nin the course of communications ;\nbut there seems to be no question\nthat in striking and detailed accuracy, and in the number of correct\nresults that can be produced in one context and at one time, the\nparanormal material presented as evidence for communication is in\na much higher class than that elicited by E.S.P. experiments. This\nfact suggests that there is a special \u201c virtue \u201d in the communicator-\nimpulse. It need not by itself suggest that communicators are real\npersons. It may suggest that extra-sensory perceptions which the\nmind finds it difficult to admit on the same terms as normal per-\nceptions, may gain admission very much more readily as elements\nin an acceptable myth. It is another question whether it is probable\nthat a myth without basis in reality would obtain regular and con-\nsistent support from the intuitional functions of the mind. This is\nnot found to be the case in the ordinary course of psychological\nresearch, though psychologists differ widely in the kind of reality\nthat they discern Irehind the operations of imagery and symbolism.\nThis brings me to the difficult question, difficult, that is, to discuss\nin small compass, of a hypothesis about the nature of the com-\nmunicator-impulse. This, of course, involves a hypothesis about\nthe nature of \u201c the communicator \u201d, but I should like to emphasise\nthe importance of a step which we are apt to leave out in the dis-\ncussion, after we have considered the mental mechanisms through\nwhich mediumistic utterance may work. An understanding of\nmachinery, even when it is complete, may leave a good deal un-\nexplained. An understanding of the machinery of a car may explain\nwhy it goes, but not why it goes to Tavistock Square. The hypothesis\n\f145]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 21\nthat there is a human driver, so highly probable in the case of the\ncar, may supply a misleading analogy if we transfer it to all mechan-\nisms that work in an observed direction. But a hy])othesis is neces-\nsary to account for the direction as well as the mechanism\u2014and in\nthe case of commimications, for the following of a complicated\nchoice of paths by a process that looks very hke steering. The\nimpulse to follow a given track must be analysed, or we are in\ndanger of jumping to one of two conclusions\u2014either that there\n\u201c must \u201d be a spirit working the mechanism, or that the mechanism\nis working itself.\nWhat is it necessary to assume about the impulse that produces\ncommunications ? First, that if it proceeds from the trance-mind\nalone, that mind has powers not only of obtaming, selecting and\narranging paranormal information, but of effective dramatisation\nwithout a model (as would be specially the case in proxy sittings) ;\nand for the existence of these powers we have nothing that can be\ncalled evidence. Second, that if it proceeds from other incarnate\nminds, these minds, to produce the observed phenomena, must be\nable to collaborate telepathically to form an integrated system of\nmemories and characteristics, not only conveying this as a whole to\nthe medium, but convejdng, also by telepathy, a characteristic\npersonal drive and manner of self-expression. Again, there is insuf-\nficient evidence for paranormal powers of this order. Third, that if\na generahsed concept such as \u201c telepathy \u201d, or a reservoir of\nmemories, is thought of as an effective cause, we have to endow\nthese things with dynamic fimctions so much resembling personality\nthat it becomes useless to think of them as impersonal. (I have\nnot, so far, foimd it very useful to entertain the idea that more or\nless disintegrated wisps of memory and motive can somehow persist\nin vacuo, and influence phenomena.)\nThe types of assumption, in fact, which follow upon the three\nkinds of hypothesis which I have suggested, appear to be too wide\nand carefree for scientific use. I am not throwing the hypotheses\naside as falsities, but trying to put them in their place as myths that\nmay or may not prove to have some truth behind them. I have a\ngood deal of respect for myths, and indeed, I propose to adopt one\nas containing the working hypothesis that seems hkely to work\nbest. This is the myth provided by mediumistic utterance itself,\nthat the communicator-impulse proceeds from disembodied spirits.\nIt is a dehberate method of approach, not an ingenious but un-\nnecessary comphcation, to treat the hypothesis as something that\nhas to be disentangled from a myth. The real comphcation becomes\nvisible if we accept, as a working hypothesis, the bulk of what we\n\f22 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nare told at sittings about communicators, and then see what assump-\ntions we are obliged to make. Broadly, these are a body of spurious\nassumptions, many of them only half-conscious and so outside\nrational control, which centre in the suggested belief that the com-\nmunicator of the seance-room \u201c is \u201d the deceased person who is\nbeing represented. If we substitute \u201c is partly \u201d for \u201c is \u201d, we are\nmaking assumptions about the nature and behaviour of personality-\nelements which are very likely to be misleading. It is here that we\ncan keep closer to justifiable assumptions by thinking in terms of\ncommunicator-impulse rather than of communicator-personality.\nI think we can argue, with a minimum of fantasy, the existence of\nan impulse to dramatise on the part of the medium (\na natural and\nrespectable impulse when the mediumship is of a high grade), com-\nbined in greater or less degree with an impulse to co-operate with\nand assist the dramatisation on the part of a discarnate person.\nEssentially, we are in touch, at a sitting, with a subliminal actor in\nthe medium (there is plenty of evidence to be gathered from hyp-\nnotic experiments for the existence of a subliminal actor in the\nhuman mind), who in turn is in more or less close telepathic touch\nwith the original of the role. But we are not dealing, at any rate in\nthe case of a reliable medium, with an actor depending on a\nmemorised part ;\nthe actor is extemporising, and we are assuming\na telepathic collaborator to account for the extemporisation effec-\ntively reproducing a verifiable character unknown to the medium.\nA possible faint analogue to the process is the power some musicians\nhave of extemporising duets together, without previously agreeing\nupon a theme. The subliminal actor, apparently, \u201c gags \u201d when\ntelepatliic impulse fails to assist the extemporising impulse, and\nprobal)ly is not at all sure which is which. This is certainly the case\nwith automatists who obtain script with fairly clear consciousness\nof what comes to expression.\n^^'e may note that the sitter, on this hypothesis, is behaving with\ncomplete scientific correctness in also collaborating in the dramatic\nprocess, whether telepathically, which cannot be helped if and when\nit ha])])cns, or l)y treating the dramatised personality as entirely\nwhat it professes to be. A good dramatic critic is not a person who\nrefuses to admit full dramatic illusion into his mind, though he has\nbecome, by practice, fully aware at the same time of dramatic\ntechnique.\nThe jmint of this hypothesis about the communicator-impulse\nthat it is a s])ecialised subhminal form of the dramatic impulse\ncommon to humanity, combined with more or less of a telepathic\nimpulse from a discarnate person\u2014is that it imports from what I\n\f145] the Recorded Leonard Material 23\nam respectfully calling the communicator-myth the minimum\nassumption that I think will account for the observed phenomena.\nIt leaves untouched the deeper problems of personahty-structure\nwhich are dealt with in Lord Balfour\u2019s impressive paper on the\nWillett medimnship.^ But scientifically, to accept the idea of dis-\ncarnate influence is a very large assumption of the unknown, based\non an assertion which is part of the phenomena, and on a human\nintuition which is suspect of representing a desire rather than a per-\nception. However, with the best will in the world I cannot relate\nthe observed impulse and its outcome in evidential statement to\nany known factor that provides for the co-ordination of the impulse.\nThere is no reason to suppose that extra-sensory impacts are so\nthoughtful as to select and integrate themselves into an illusory\nbut etfective representation of a communicator ; I cannot imagine\nthem selected and integrated, without a model, by the undirected\ntrance-mind of the medium ;\nwhile the hypothesis of telepathy from\nthe living as a sufficient cause of communications requires para-\nnormal abilities, added to a genius for telepathic conspiracy, with\nwhich we have as yet no excuse for crediting ourselves.\nTurning from hypotheses to what may safely be described as\npsychological facts, I think it is of some importance to consider\nthe fact of organisation in a communicator-personality. The\nterm organisation is used in psychology to indicate the way in\nwhich a set of dispositions becomes mtegrated. A control-\npersonality becomes pretty strongly organised ;\na communicator-\npersonality, as a rule, less so. Feda is able to withstand the quite\nconsiderable psychological impacts entailed by a word-association\ntest without noticeable change of personality (whether it is the\nwhole of \u201c Feda \u201d, mcluding the paranormal functions, that has\nbeen tested, or only a comparatively mechanical \u201c Feda-vehicle \u201d,\nwe cannot know). The communicator whom j\\Ir Drayton Thomas\nallows to be known, for brevity, as John, and other communicators\nwhose \u201c vehicles \u201d (in my hypothesis, dramatic) have had years m\nwhich to become firmly organised, are similarly able\u2014and, fortu-\nnately, for us, willing\u2014to undergo wcrd-association tests, with the\nresults that Mr Carington has investigated and described.^ Again,\nit is difficult to guess whether the fugitive elements of paranormal\nfaculty, and by hypothesis of discarnate influence, may be present\nin the psychological formation at the time when it is being tested.\n(We are not sure, in any case, whether the phrase \u201c at the time\n\u201d\nhas any particular meaning in this context.) We may l)e observing\n* Proc.

The results are not the less interesting and significant if\nthis is the case, but the possibility may affect the expectations that\nwe form of results from other and less habitually organised com-\nmunicator-formations.\nFor an example, the Compton communicator in one of Miss Nea\nWalker\u2019s proxy cases with Mrs Leonard ^ appears to have particu-\nlaiiy good organisation, beginning from the first sitting ;\nand the\ncharacter is that of a medical man, scientifically interested in the\nprocess of communication. It would be interesting to discover\nwhether this personality, after the quieting-down of certain emo-\ntional elements, would and could respond consistently to word-\nassociation tests ;\nbut I think it woiild be in no way surprising if\nthe psychological formation ]>roved unable to hold together under\nthe conditions. And in general, I think we are apt to leave out of\nconsideration the probable strength, or depth, of organisation, in\nmany forms of psychical research, when we propose either to vary\nthe conditions of experiment, or to apply to a new case conditions\nwhich have proved satisfactory with an old-established one. Con-\nsiderations of this kind may also suggest a reason for Mrs Leonard\u2019s\nrecent practice of giving sittings to none but old-established sitters.\nThis suggestion leads on to the point that organisation, whether of\na paranormal kind or not, must obviously subsist between medium\nand sitter\u2014a fact of which the implications are often much better\nrecognised by the investigator who relies on common sense than by\nthe enthusiast for some particular theory. It is very much more\ndifficult in psychical than in psychological research to vary the\nconditions of experiment with any approach to an idea of what\nchanges are in fact being made in the organisations involved.\nThe facts of organisation may account for one curious pheno-\nmenon in communicator-psychology : that it is new communi-\ncators (such as \u201c I)r Compton \u201d) and old established communi-\ncators (such as \u201c John \u201d) who seem to show the most effective\norganisation, though they may differ in stability. In between the\nphases of novelty and of further development tlaere seems often to\nbe a flat period. This may be analogous to the insphation of the\nyoung artist, conqjaratively unstable and easily upset, which appears\nto go underground when the technique of the art is first studied\nsystematically, but reajipears\u2014if it survives\u2014in maturer, more\n1 Thromjh a Stmeger's Hands (Hutchinson).

But while it is most desirable to\nbrmg psychical experiments into a jjosition like that of physical\nexjieriments, where they can be repeated or varied at will, we have\nto recognise a wide difference between repeating the ajiparent con-\nditions of a psychic phenomenon and reproducing the actual and\nprobably obscure organisation which enabled it to hapjjen. AVhen\nthe psychic phenomenon to be tested is reduced to the simplest type,\nsuch as extra-sensory awareness of an electric bulb being lit in one\nof five closed boxes (in Mr Tyrrell\u2019s recent experiments), the organisa-\ntion involved is found to be none too simple or easy to understand ;\nwhen we come to the very complicated structure of the Leonard\norganisations it is most difficult to experiment with any knowledge\nof what we are about. What is useless is to form judgments of this\ntype :\n\u201c If he (a given communicator) can do this, he should be\nable to do that \u201d. \u201c He \u201d is likely to involve an assumption that\nthe communicator \u201c is \u201d the deceased person, not a complex repre-\nsentation ;\nand \u201c should \u201d assumes that we know how the repre-\nsentation can and cannot operate, when in fact we know very little\nabout it. The best method of varying the conditions of experiment\nseems to be to observe what variations occur spontaneously, and\nto select those which seem to be most fruitful and to conform most\nexactly to test conditions. A series of such selections can, in prac-\ntice, result in a very large variation from previous conditions ;\nbut\nthe process is gradual, and may arouse impatience in those who\nwant immediately to try out some new experiment, which may have\nevery chance of upsetting the organisation involved.\nThere is involution as well as evolution of organised psychic\ntrends, producing stereotyped modes of thought and action. These\ncan be useful, as in the usefulness of habit and routine, and in the\nestablishment of junctions, as it were, in the mind, which form\nhabitual points of reference for systems of ideas ;\nor vicious, as in\nbad habits, thinking by formula, and fixations of ideas (popularly\ncalled \u201c complexes \u201d, though often mistakenly). I approached the\nLeonard records with a strong impression that they would show a\ntendency to the use of stock formulae, on the hit-or-miss principle :\nnot in any reprehensible way, but from a tendency which I thought\n\f20 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nwould be natural in a professional medium, and thought I had\nobserved in my own sittings in the past, to fall into a habit of using\nthe tracks that usually lead somewhere with the average sitter, and\nthe words and phrases that oftenest produce a response. When I\ncame to an examination of Miss Nea Walker\u2019s records of proxy\nsittings, with her admirable groupings, under individual heads, of\npoints which have special critical interest, I was not surprised to\nsee that one of the headings she had employed was \u201c Cliches\nBut I was surprised to see that this heading had perforce been\nabandoned, after points had been extracted from a number of\nsittings, because the pages on which the heading had been typed\ncontained hardly anything. Organised routes for leading up to a\nfavourite type of subject are certainly present, such as one can\nobserve in the conversational hal)its of one\u2019s friends (these are easier\nto observe than one\u2019s own habits) ;\nbut I find on careful examination\nthat these stock openings have a remarkable way of leading each\nto a different track of association which is appropriate to the given\ncommunicator. I have tried to interpret this as a process in which\nthe motivation arises in the trance-mind alone, and the deflection\ntowards evidential fact is due to telepathic impacts from the living ;\nbut the difficulty of accounting for selection among such impacts is\nvery great, especially at a proxy sitting, unless we assume that only\nselected impacts arrive, which lands us again in assuming the trans-\nmission of impulse and organisation by some fiction-factory in the\nminds of bereaved people at a distance.\nTo take an instance which occurs in Miss Nea Walker\u2019s published\nmaterial, as well as in several unpublished records, there is a curious\nLeonard-tendency to make use of the word \u201c mount \u201d, apparently\nas a feeler towards place-names containing it. This occurs several\ntimes in Through a Stranger s Hands and elsewhere, and is the\nnearest thing to a true cliche that I have so far observed in the\nLeonard material. It is a likely conjecture that almost any anno-\ntator could associate something more or less relevant with the word\n\u201c mount \u201d. These allusions I should class as evidentially worthless\nin themselves, and I rather dishke giving any weight to them at all ;\nbut when they are dro})ped into contexts which appear to be far\nfrom fortuitous, the element of \u201c fishing \u201d seems to involve a fairly\ngood idea where the individual trout is. At the end of Through a\nStranger s Hands, on the last page of the van Tricht Case, references\ncan be found to an episode in which \u201c the -mount \u201d has been associ-\nated with the name Diemont, not because this very fortuitous-\nsounding association struck Dr van Tricht as in itself compelling,\nbut because it was so placed as to fit a given context like a piece in\n\f145 ]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 27\na jigsaw puzzle. (I am not here assuming any characteristic in\npieces of jigsaw puzzles except that they fit, and make part of a\npattern.)\nCorresponding to certain possible cliche words, there are what\nmay be regarded as cliche ideas or suggestions. These, again, are\nfew : the most frequent one that I have observed will j^robably l^e\nrecognised by a number of Leonard sitters. This is a suggestion\nthat a visit has been paid, or has to be paid, to some vaguely indi-\ncated locality which has sad or painful associations. The conjecture\nis pretty obvious that this could be described as a visit-to-the-grave\nformula, which has become organised because it is a very likely\nshot. The formula, however, has often led on into association-\ntracks which are individually appropriate. In one proxy case (un-\npublished : records are in the S.P.R. rooms) details concerning a\ngrave were given which happened to be known to Miss Walker\nthrough correspondence following a previous sitting ;\nand on the\nfollowing day these were apparently supplemented by further allu-\nsions, recognised only by the annotator in America, in the spon-\ntaneous script of an automatist who, as I can personally bear\nwitness, knew nothing of the case, but was instructed in her script\nto send the script to Miss Walker for verification. The implication\nthat effective communicator-impulse was at work does not seem to\nbe affected by the fact that a customary formula had first introduced\nthe subject, which was then elaborated at the Leonard sitting and\nelsewhere. And it has to be remembered that the subject itself is\na common feature in cases of bereavement.\nI have thought it of use to pursue a rather dull investigation, of\nwhich the foregoing are surface sam])les, into this question of\norganised trends in the trance-mind, because it is of fundamental\nimportance to make sure that we are not mistaking trends of the\nprocess, in trance-communication, for evidence of intention on the\npart of communicators. Isolated examples of evidence for intention\ncan be very strong (as, for example, in \u201c The Problem of the Pipes \u201d,\nan episode in Mr Drayton Thomas\u2019s proxy case of Bobby Newlove,\nProc., Vol. XLIII, Part 143, p. 481), but I am speaking more of the\ngeneral evidence of intention that is to be inferred from veridical\ncommunications as a whole. Given a wish on the part of the\nmedium to produce evidence of survival, and long experience in\ntrance, with a multitude of sitters, of the lines of suggestion\nwhich are most likely to produce vivid personal associations, it is\nvery possible for systems of safe guesses to be automatically\norganised, which become endowed with a great appearance of\nauthenticity and individual quality when they are enriched by\n\f28 Kenneih Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nstriking annotations. The intentions manifested at a sitting might\nlie types of intention in the trance-mind alone which have been\nfound to Ije readily supplemented by the associations of sitters and\nannotators. I think this machinery certainly exists, though much\nless pervasively than I imagined when I started the investigation ;\nluit I think the most interesting thing about it is the regularity with\nwhich it defeats its apparent object. In the best sittings, it is the\nallusions which the communicator-impulse appears to have forced\naway from the expected rut, that arrive at something specific in\nthe mind of the annotator. But it is advisable to plough through a\nnumber of the worst sittings, where \u201c stock \u201d suggestions and feelers\nare chiefly to be found, in order to see how completely the most\nwilling annotator is left groping for any trace of individual signifi-\ncance in what is said. I have tried deliberately to distort some of\nthese passages into any semblance of an evidential meaning for\nmyself, not at a glance but carefully putting down on paper every-\nthing favourable that I could think of, and I found it hard and un-\nproductive work. Now and then an accidental association seemed\nto be working out brilliantly, with a little spurious encouragement,\nbut it would regularly be put out of court by something quite\nincompatible in the context.\nI have found in fact that the search for evidence of effective\nintention\u2014effective, that is, to produce the observed results\u2014in the\norganisations that seem to occur in the mind of the medium alone,\nis a search that appears to lead away from its objective. I think\nthat any attentive reading of Leonard material must lead to a feel-\ning that the element of intention in the trance-mind itself is a\nvaguely grojung thing, continually deflected into this or that dis-\ntinctive channel by intention of quite a different type ;\nbut it\nseemed worth while to test this feeling as thoroughly as possible for\nillusions due to the coincidence of mediumistic gropings, having only\na vaguely organised intention, with potent associations contributed\nby the sitter or annotator, the whole being made the more impres-\nsive by evidence of paranormal acquaintance with facts. The point\nis an elementary one, and there are specific episodes which it fails\nto cover, but it might account for a good deal of apparent com-\nmunicator-impulse. In my opinion the explanation appears to be\nspecious, in the great majority of cases, on any close examination\nof the way the current of thought and speech actually flows. The\nvague forms of organised intention that seem attributable to the\ntrance-mind alone, with its past experience, appear as being quite\ndistinctly manipulated, deflected and sometimes negatived by\nanother form of intention. This interplay and partial opjiosition of\n\f145]\nthe Becorded Leonard Material 29\nintentions can of course be dramatised, and on my present hypo-\nthesis are dramatised ;\nbut, once again, extempore dramatic impulse\ndoes not seem to accoimt for the observed content of communicator-\nimpulse, and we have seen the difficulties of attributing a function\nof guidance either to \u201c telepathy \u201d as an abstraction or to the\nincarnate minds from whose miconscious collaboration it might be\nassmned to proceed.\nOne of Mrs Leonard\u2019s phenomena appears to represent communi-\ncator-impulse in a particularly concentrated form. This is the\nwhispered, or sotto-voce remark, sometimes preceding a more\nelaborated version, out loud, of the statement (often a less evidential\nversion), and sometimes interjected into, and interrupting or cor-\nrecting, the more usual flow of speech. It is necessary to have heard\nthese sotto-voce remarks to appreciate the curious impression of\nrapid, fugitive certainty of touch that they convey ; but although\nI am speaking of something that cannot be put on literal record for\nexamination, I had better note that I find it difficult to classify this,\nand certain other impressions of utterance in specially close touch\nwith a motivation apart from the medimn, as superlatively clever\ndramatic effects arranged by the subliminal actress. Not that un-\nconscious motivation cannot produce brilhant dramatic effects\nsome of the hysterias have staged astonishingly convinced and con-\nvincing dramatic work ;\nthe point is one of quahty, and of acquired\npsychological instinct on the part of the observer for which I claim\nnothing except that it exists, and asserts rightly or wrongly that\nthese particular Leonard phenomena are not much like dramatic\nconstructs. I am prepared to find my dramatisation-hypothesis\nwearing pretty thin in certain important places, though I think\ndramatisation may still best describe the medium\u2019s unconscious\ncontribution to the blend that usually occurs.\nThe moments and periods in a sitting which especially impress the\nhearer\u2019s mind with the feeling that something outside ordinary\nexperience is happening, include manifestations of character and\npersonahty which are extremely difficult to deal with scientifically.\nIt is thoroughly bad psychology to leave out of consideration things\nthat produce strong emotional or intuitional impressions upon the\nobserver, whatever hypotheses they appear to support ;\nand it is\nthoroughly bad method to give weight to these impressions (whether\nas evidence of survival or as evidence of creduhty) without any\nmeans of knowing what kind of weight it is. To revert to the\nCompton Case, in Through a Strangers Hands, the general reader,\nhaving no previous acquahitance with Leonard phenomena, receives\na certain distinct feeling of impressiveness about the personahty of\n\f30 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nthe Compton communicator. I, having had Leonard sittings and\ninvestigated a good deal of Leonard material, receive a heightened\nimpression through knowing the type of intuitional atmosphere,\nand being aware also that this personality is not only impressive\nluit distinctive among a great number of other impressive com-\nmunicators. Miss Nea Walker, being present at the sitting, and in\nthis case having known Dr Compton slightly, receives a more direct\nimpression, which can be gathered from her notes on the case,\nthough she has correctly kept it in the background. The annotators,\nDr \u201c Davison \u201d and a brother-in-law, receive a further impression\nwhich, though derived from cold typescript and unfortified by\nexperience of Leonard sittings, is heightened in another direction\nby a fairly intimate knowledge of Compton characteristics.\nNow, I find myself possessed of the opinion that if the Compton-\nNea Walker-Leonard sittings could by some means be reproduced\nexactly as they occurred, with another person as auditor who both\nhad long and critical experience of Leonard sittings, and also had\nknown Dr Compton in his lifetime exceedingly well, that person\nwould receive a still more definite and vivid impression that the\npersonality of Dr Compton was in some way a participant in the\nIpeing of the Comjpton communicator. I am not advancing this\n0])inion as an argument, but trying to account for its existence as a\npsychological fact. First, it is based on a certain amount of reason-\nable analogy. On other occasions communicators have made their\nap])earance, and the evidence for their authenticity has risen in\nimpressiveness and evidential value, the more it has been weighed\nby ])eople having the requisite personal knowledge and critical\nexperience. Second, I find that I am undoubtedly influenced by\nthis consideration : that the Comjpton communicator has not only\n\u201c come to life \u201d in my own mind, as a being of whom independent\nand characteristic reactions are to be expected (this could be said\nof any really well-drawn character in fiction), but that this character\nappears to be recognised in three different ways by three different\npeople who knew the original. If I were a judge who had to decide\na case at law, in which A was accusing B, a novelist, of having\nborrowed A\u2019s personality to make a fictional character, I should\n(I hope) study the character in the book carefully to gain an impres-\nsion of the personality that was portrayed : and I should then be\ninfluenced in opinion\u2014and so would the jury, however I directed\nthem in law\u2014by testimony from A\u2019s friends that they had recog-\nnised the portrait at sight, apart from facts in A\u2019s life which the\nnovel might have reproduced more or less as they occurred. The\ninfluence of evidence which was quite unweighable objectively, ex-\n\f145]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 31\ncept in terms of the number of witnesses^^saying snnilar things,\nmight be regrettable in strict law ;\nbut a moment could in fact\narrive where I should know pretty positively that further witnesses\nwould only increase the impression that the character in B\u2019s book\nwas really based on A.\nThe pouit is not that such a moment ought to arrive in judging\nthe credibihty of a communicator, but that it does arrive, and by a\nprocess that cannot really be reduced to logical terms. It is possible\nto have logical evidence of character, as well as evidence of intention,\nby amassing details of mental and verbal behaviour, and character-\nistic operations of memory, which are recognised as closely resembl-\ning those of an actual person. These can be put into order on some-\nthing hke an evidential basis. It seems possible that hlr Carington\u2019s\ntreatment of word-association material may estabhsh characteristics\nbelonging to a given communicator and not belonging to either of\ntwo independent medimns who present that communicator. This\nwould at least demonstrate the probability of psychological \u201c traces\n\u201d\nhaving a common origin outside either medium\u2019s mind, and would\nbe in the same held of inquiry as evidence of character. But I think\nit is necessary to face the fact that objective and more or less cal-\nculable evidence, in this held, cannot help being subordinate in our\nminds to opinion founded on personal and subjective impressions\nor the lack of them. It is a truism that opinion is much less hkely\nto bias our view of evidence if we admit and allow for it, rather than\npretend that we are mca]3able of bias. And I have tried to suggest\nhow this kind of opinion, based on mental processes more appropriate\nto the law-court than to the laboratory, can be formed on an\nentirely respectable basis.\nThis factor of opinion cannot help being of very considerable\nimportance when we come to the study of a long-established com-\nmunicator-personahty such as that of \u201c John \u201d. In this case the\norganisation of communicator-impulse has had the advantage of\nMr Drayton Thomas\u2019s firmly consolidated opinion, the growth of\nnearly twenty years, that the operative personahty is that of his\nfather, John Drayton Thomas. It would be an error of false analogy\nfrom physical science to regard this as a factor to be discounted. In\ndeahng with msensible things and forces, the experimenter\u2019s behef\nin his working hypothesis does not affect his results except as it\naffects his own behaviom\u2019. In psychological and psychical research,\nthe experimenter\u2019s behef is part of the active organisation that\noccurs. Its absence may constitute a negative suggestion which\nacts U23011 phenomena hke a low temperature upon a chemical\nreaction. What I may call the equable temperatme of Mr Drayton\n\f32 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nThomas\u2019s opinion is a condition in which given results occur. It is\ncorrect to examine the results with the coolest scientific scepticism,\nbut not to complain that they occurred in whatever conditions were\npsychologically necessary. It may be a difficulty of the sceptic\u2014\nhave traced this in myself\u2014that he unconsciously resents pheno-\nmena that decline to occur in his own presence.\nOn the other hand, it is advisable to ask at the outset what results\ncan be attributed to Mr Drayton Thomas\u2019s state of opinion, which\nentails a state of expectation. Expectation is always a difficult\nsubject to handle, because the naive assumption that \u201c this could\nnot have come from my own mind, as I was not thinking of it, and\nit smprised me \u201d, is often misleading. Experiment in telepathy\nsuggests that the things not consciously thought of may be the\neasiest to convey. It becomes necessary to allow for a large, and\neven for an apparently hnprobable, field of expectation in the mind\nof a sitter awaiting communications from a known personality.\nA striking and consistent characteristic of John is a tendency to\nrelate paranormal evidence of many kinds to some definite associa-\ntion with his own typical activities in the past, or to family associa-\ntions with given persons or places. To take a random instance from\npubhshed material,^ the first group of newspaper tests attempted\nby this communicator included a mention of soap as among the\nthings to be fomid on a forthcoming page of The Times. This was\nmarked as a failure, until at the next sitting, \u201c some name suggest-\ning soap \u201d (itahcs mine) was suggested for the allusion. The name\nwas clearly identified in the part of the page that had been indicated\nbefore the issue of The Times was out, but so far (m this instance)\nthe emendation could be put down to normal observation by the\nmedium after the paper was available. However, there were definite\nassociations, dating from twenty years before, between the soap-\nmaker\u2019s family and the Drayton Thomas family, and there had been\nan engagement between members of the two families, so that a piece\nof paranormal evidence (in this instance, containing an evidential\nflaw, if one chooses to think the \u201c soap \u201d clue a chance shot) was\nsupported by the aptness of the given allusion to the communi-\ncator\u2019s family mterests.\nIn this and very many similar mstances, in the course of the\nDrayton Thomas sittings, is it arguable that Mr Drayton Thomas\u2019s\nlatent memories could have supphed what must be called an active\nblit imconscious expectation that these characteristic allusions\nwould be made ? There are certain cases where there appears not\nto have been any latent memory, but when the sitter possesses\n^ Some New Evidence, far Human Survival (Collins, 1922), p. 216 et seq.\n\f145] the Recorded Leonard Material 33\ntlie requisite memories the evidence for telepathy l^etweeii the\nliving certainly suggests that a number of associations suitable\nfor the communicator could have filtered through in some form,\nthough not so large a nmnber as are found in the records, nor in so\npurposive a form. It is the assumption of purposive and construc-\ntive action, either in Mr Drayton Thomas\u2019s unconscious mind con-\ntrary to his conscious intention (the mind does not work well in\nstates of conflict), or applied by the trance-mind of Mrs Leonard to\nhis latent memories, for which I can find no evidential justification\nwhatever. Chance would be a very much more credible explanation\nfor such mstances of the connection of these elements of memory\nwith paranormal data, if there were not so many of them. It seems\nto me extremely difficult to explain the characteristic behaviour of\nthe \u201c John \u201d mentality, as the producer of a typical range of evidence\nthrough a typical mode of purposive activity, on any basis that\nidentifies this mentality with a part of Mr Drayton Thomas\u2019s mind.\nThe amount of speculative assumption that would have to be\nadmitted only grows larger, the more closely such a hypothesis is\nfollowed up through the detail of the records.\nIt seems to be a matter of commonsense to keep evidence of\ncharacter upon a dynamic as well as a factual basis. It is not diffi-\ncult to be misled l^y a striking chance resemblance at a given moment,\nor at a small number of separate given moments, between what is\npresented in a communication and what would be characteristic of\na particular person. What is more impressive in the long run,\nthough it may provide less high-hghts, is the persistent combination\nof evidence of intention with evidence of character. In reading a\nconsiderable number of records from the same communicator, day\nafter day, I have noticed that the mind tends to become insensitive\nto the element of characteristic intention\u2014one begins to take it for\ngranted\u2014until some new episode arouses the mental comment,\n\u201c How hke him !\n\u201d and the critical sense immediately chimes in\nwith an accusation of begging the question. If I were asked to say\nwhat, precisely, gives me the impression of characteristic intention\nthroughout the \u201c John \u201d records that I have so far studied, I should\nfind it difficult to give a more pertinent reply than that the whole\ntype of intention ap^jears to change as soon as I turn to the records\nof another communicator. I merely make note of the fact, that the\nunpression of characteristic intention does increase with |)rolonged\nstudy of the material, and does develop a continuity which does not\nseem to be my own contribution.\nIndeed, continuity in maintaining the hypothesis of discarnate\ncommunication, and in giving it consistent fair play, is under a\n\f34 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nhandicap while one is continually and critically questioning every\nindividual eleinent that can support the hypothesis. \u201c Can I think\nof this as not being in character ?\n\u201d \u201c Could that be regarded as\naccident ami not intention, or as someone else\u2019s intention ?\n\u201d Such a\nprocess of cross-questioning is extremely destructive, and I have been\nsnr])rised at its not having a disintegrating effect upon the material\nas an evidential whole. I have been especially interested in the\n\u201c\n2\n)ipes \u201d episode already referrerl to (p. 27 of this paper), because it\nshowed evidence of intention\u2014not to say pertinacity\u2014which could\nbe carefully examined and then taken for granted, as a single aim\nat one ])articular objective, persisting through several sittings and\na considerable period of time. The case, as Mr. Drayton Thomas\nhas himself jnesented it in Proceedings, can speak for itself ;\nwhat\n1 am concerned with here is the effect of having this one factor of\nintention stalulised, as it were, in the mind while one is reviewing\nthe tract of material in which it is concerned. The faculty of\ncritical attention is very much more free for giving balanced con-\nsideration to other evidential factors ;\nand the study of this material\nhas led me to realise to what an extent the mind is operating a\ncomplicated sliding-scale process, with every value shifting in un-\nknown ratio to the others, when it attempts the task of scientific\ndiscrimination among diverse hypotheses at the same time.\nI am inclined to think, upon a not as yet extensive experience of\napplying 2\n)sychological criticism to the Leonard material, that a\nnearer ajqnoach to exact method will probably be found by taking\nthe hypothesis of discarnate communication\u2014or any other hypo-\nthesis that promises continuously to account for the facts\u2014as the\nmain line for theoretical development, and not subjecting the\nhypothesis to an unceasing barrage of reservations and alternatives.\nIf the hyjjothesis, carefully followed uj), produces a spurious psycho-\nlogical structure, this should be capable of demolition. And I have\na strong suspicion that, in following closely and without distraction\nupon the trail of a communicator regarded as a human being, we\nshall discover a good many hitherto unnoticed facts about the pro-\ncesses of communication, which will be of use in understanding the\nnecessary conditions of experiment or of further research into the\nmost complex of all our probleins.\n\f145] the Recorded Leonard Material 35\nII\nAn Example of Evidence of Intention in Book-test Material ^\n(The \u201c La Vita Nuova \u201d Case)\nEarly in my study of the Drayton Thomas sittings I came upon\nthe long series of book-tests, of which a number have been pub-\nlished m Some New Evidence for Eiuman Survival ;\nand I noticed\nrepeated statements at the sittings that book-tests had some general\ntrend which would be discovered, and that a good deal was to be\nfound out by comparing one book-test with another\u2014something\napparently of the nature of evidence through cross-correspondence.\nHitherto, book-tests seem to have been examined chiefly for their\nevidential value as units, though as the technique of this form of\ncommunication developed, from 1918 to 1921, the units tended to\nbecome groups of tests given at one time, and having some inter-\nrelation with one another.\nIn Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s \u201c An Examination of Book-Tests \u201d (Proc.,\nVol. XXXI, Part Ixxxi) the ordinary technique of a book-test is\nthus exemphfied ;\n\u201c Feda might tell the sitter that the communicator wants him to\ngo to the book-case between the fireplace and the window in his\nstudy, and in the third shelf from the bottom to take the seventh\nbook from the left and open it at the 48th page, where about one-\nthird of the way down he will find a passage which may be regarded\nas an appropriate message from the communicator to him.\u201d\nI think most careful investigators of book-tests, at this time, were\ntrying to narrow down the issue to the distinctly important question\nwhether what teas actually said at the sitting had a really close cor-\nrespondence with what was found in the passage in the book which\nhad been so elaborately and selectively indicated. It was often\nsaid, I remember, that if only the exact wmrds of the book could be\ngiven at the sitting, this would be conclusive. It would in fact be\ncogent evidence only of extra-sensory perception ;\nand Mrs Sidg-\nwdek, with her unvarying sureness of touch in matters of evidence,\nconcludes only from her examination of book-tests that evidence of\nclairvoyance appears to be estabhshed. She does not put evidence\nof communication out of court, but the method of inquiry is one\nthat puts the problem of intention second to a proper treatment of\nthe question whether these cases really are, as they seem, para-\nnormal.\n* Containing the substance of a lecture delivered to the Society on 2U Mav,\n1935.\n\f36 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nIt is obvious that the more nearly we coniine ourselves to evidence\nthat the communicator \u201c knows \u201d what is in the book, the less likely\nwe are to follow up any intention with which that knowledge may\nbe used, except the simj^le intention to display it. However, there\nemerges spontaneously, for what this is worth, a manifest intention\nto refer, in the book-tests, to interests and reminiscences which the\ncommunicator and the sitter have in common. Such statements as,\n\u201c This refers to something that was important in your life ten years\nago \u201d, have a good deal of evidential interest when they are sub-\nstantiated.\nBut we are not fully testing evidence of intention by simply de-\nciding what to expect from what is said at the sitting, and then look-\ning in the book to see if it is there. More satisfactory evidence of\nintention is something relevant that we should not have expected\nor, still better, could not have expected. Further, the appearance\nof a common aim, unsuspected by the sitters, in book-tests given to\ndifferent people, would at once raise questions beyond that of a\ndisplay of paranormal faculty.\nLady Troubridge and Miss Badclyffe Hail, who made a careful\nand thorough compilation for the Society of book-tests given at\ntheir own Leonard sittings, have noted that the subject of \u201c psy-\nchical research \u201d is very often the content of the book-passages\nreferred to. If this is the fact, it looks significant, when we remember\nthat the books selected by the mediumistic process are on all kinds\nof subjects, and that the chances of hitting on a passage that will\nbear this interj^retation are few and far between. References by\nimplication to \u201c psychical research \u201d could be roughly estimated,\nbut the phrase does not provide a clear enough dividing line for\npurposes of classification, so after some consideration I elected to\nclassify all the satisfactorily identified book-passages, in the different\ncollections of Leonard book-tests then before me, according to\nwhether they did or did not refer appositely to death and the con-\ndition of the dead, or to some relation between the dead and the\nliving. This as a criterion of judgment is still not very exact, but\nit seemed in practice to be quite sufficiently so for the purpose.\nThere were few borderline instances, and these I placed on the\n\u201c No \u201d side. It may be noted that I avoided tabulating results as\nI went along (since visible competition between growing columns\nmight be a distraction) and had a general imjjression, before count-\niiig up the totals, that there was no more than a significant minority\nof positive results. Actually they turned out to be just over 60%,\nin a total count of 91 l)ook-tests. Where two or more book-passages\nwere indicated in one test, I have counted one or more positive\n\f145]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 37\nresults as one, neglecting negative results in the same test. It will\nbe remembered that the remaining 40% of tests represent the com-\npetition of many other subjects, such as memories shared between\nthe communicator and the sitter. A general control and selection\nof book-tests has, at various sittings, been claimed to be exercised\nby certam skilled communicators, who were said to advise and help\nothers in the use of this technique. The further claim that they\nwere selecting book-passages that would prove to have some unified\nand discernible trend gains possible support from the figures.\nAs a check-experiment covering part of the ground, I made a\nrandom collection of 500 whole-page examples (for the passages\nindicated in book-tests, the \u201c target \u201d is usually half a page or less)\nfrom books in the S.P.K. Library, grouping my selections artificially\nso as to make a proportional correspondence with l^ook-tests con-\ntaining more than one reference. I found that a similar estimation\nof these pages as containing any allusion to death and the condition\nof the dead, or to some relation between the dead and the living,\ngave under 20% of positive results. Professor E. K. Dodds has\nlured me into a check of the check-experiment by suggesting that\nthe choice of S.P.E. hbrary-books might not, as I had supposed,\nweight the scales in favour of the chance finding of such allusions,\nsince the S.P.K. has many theoretical books not specially concerned\nwith the question of survival. Actually, I had avoided technical\ntreatises ;\nbut I followed up the suggestion that a collection of\nnovels might have better results,^ and included with these some\ndefinitely spirituahstic books in the proportion of one in five, to\ncover the probabilities of Leonard sitters having such books on\ntheir shelves. The result was a positive count of under 12%, again\ntaking whole pages, and maldng full use of any imaginative inter-\npretations that I could think of. I have been surprised, in taking\nrandom selections from Sir Oliver Lodge\u2019s Raymond, or Life and\nDeath, to find how very often one hits on a passage that no ingenuity\ncan twist into an allusion of the type sought for. A great deal of\nevery book is necessarily devoted to talking around its subject, and\neven in pages of the printed record of sittings there is a remarkably\nsmall amount, in actual bulk, of wording that fits the required\nclassification.\nTurning to more mdividual points of intention which may appear\nas common to the records of more than one sitter, I should have\n1 Here Professor Dodds removed one weight from my scales : for I think\nthe average of words to a page, in novels, is less than in S. P.R. library-books.\nBut the results, in any case, should be interpreted as \u201c of the order of\u201d the\nthe given percentages ;\nhence my large precaution of takhig whole pages.\n\f38 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nbeen greatly prolonging my digression into book-test material if I\nhad made a parallel study of all the different book-tests that are on\nrecord, as they were given week by week to different sitters. On\nthe hypothesis of communicators\u2019 intention, it seems doubtful\nwhetiier an extensive collating of results by different sitters would\nhave been anticipated by the communicators. But it seemed a\nreasonable enterprise to look carefully through some records in\nwhich one presumably skilled communicator was specially said to\nhave taken part in book-test material given to sitters not related\nto him, and in such circumstances that all the sitters concerned were\nin a favourable jjosition to compare notes. I can refer without\nembarrassment to the fact that certain excellent sitters failed to do\nso, or to observe what was at least a notable coincidence, because it\nis pretty clear that they were misled for once by the psychical\nresearcher\u2019s excellent acquired instinct agamst any comparing of\nnotes that may lead to the spoiling of evidence.\nLady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall made a number of experi-\nments, with interesting results, in the use for book-tests of foreign\nbooks, including Italian, since they had a possible communicator\nwho had been an Italian scholar. It was said at sittings, however,\nthat Dr A. W. Verrall (Mrs Salter\u2019s deceased father) would co-operate\nuistead in these experiments with Italian books, since skill in the\ntechnique of book-tests was necessary as well as familiarity with the\nlanguage. Dr Verrall was a keen student of Dante. (It has been\nclaimed by Feda that the language in which a book is printed need\nnot matter, because the meaning of a passage can be \u201c sensed \u201d,\nbut I think there is nothing in evidence by which we can test this\nstatement.) The claim that Dr Verrall was participating in the\nexperiments was, so far as I can judge, in no way contradicted by\nthe character or hterary quality of the results.\nIn April, 1918, the experimental group of Italian books appears\nto have been partially disjpersed, and there was no special arrange-\nment of books in Miss Radclyffe Hall\u2019s flat in London. As in all\nbook-test records that I have studied, there is in this case no likeli-\nhood of Mrs Leonard (then at Datchet) having had access to the\nbooks at any time. Mrs Salter was then in touch with Lady Trou-\nbridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall over the question of makmg proper\nrecord of the book-test episodes\u2014we owe to them some of the best-\nkept and best-annotated records on the S.P.R. flies\u2014and an oppor-\ntunity was, it would appear, rather specially available for Mrs\nSalter to be referred naturally, at a sitting, to books in this flat.\nOn April 23, 1918, Mrs Salter had a sitting alone with Mrs Leonard,\nat which these books were mentioned and a group of book-tests\n\f145] the Recorded Leonard Material 39\nwere given. Mrs Sidgmck quotes one of these tests wliich does not\nconcern us here, and uses the words \u201c the row of liooks meant hav-\ning been clearly indicated \u201d {Proc., Vol. XXXI, p. 277), so I need\nhardly take up space by quotations to show the process by which a\nparticular shelf was satisfactorily identified, especially as a second\nidentification of it will be found later in these pages. Feda says\nthat half-way down page 13 in the fourth book going from left to\nright on this shelf, is something that \u201c would refer to a part of your\n\u201d\n(Mrs Salter\u2019s) \u201c life, when you were about twenty, as near as he can\nget . . . certain changes that happened about that age . . .\nyou went\nthrough a transition. It bore fruit later, what you were going through\nwhen you were about twenty.^\n\u201d\nAt this age Mrs Salter\u2019s experiments in automatism changed over\nfrom table-tilting to automatic writing, and the passage indicated\nin the book definitely reminded her of the period and set her look-\ning up old records. The book was the Italian story of a wooden\npuppet that came to life, Avventure di Pinocchio {\u201c Adventures of\nPinocchio \u201d ;\nextracts from an Enghsh translation were broadcast\nto children a few years ago by the B.B.C.). The passage that\nattracted Mrs Salter\u2019s attention ends two lines above a half-way divi-\nsion of the letterpress on page 13, and reads as follows (translated) :\n\u201c The piece of wood gave a great shake, and slipping violently\nfrom his hands, went and banged with force against the meagre\nshins of poor Gepetto.\u201d\n\u201c The remainder of the page \u201d (Lady Troabridge notes when\ntranslating) \u201c consists of an argument as to the author or cause of\nthe movement of the wood \u201d.\nThe incident of which Mrs Salter was reminded by this passage\ncould be clearly placed by extant records. Her notes following this\n1923 sitting contain the following :\n\u201c The experimenters on this occasion were my mother \u201d (Mrs\nVerrall) \u201c and myself and the date was September 1, 1903, I being\nthen twenty years old. After some \u2018\nMessages \u2019\nhad been tilted, my\nmother notes that \u2018\nthe communicating intelhgence showed an in-\nchnation to move the table and after some rocking which was tiring\nand useless we asked if it could move some object in the room. It\nsaid yes, and we asked what. Answer :\n\u201c Pencil \u201d. The pencil was\nlying on the brass table near (not the table which was being tilted)\nand I moved my foot away so that I might not accidentally shake\nthe table and make the pencil move. After some time it (the table\nused for tilting) suddenly made a dash at me, hit my foot so that I\nThis and aU citations that foUow are from the original records and notes\nof sittings in the Society\u2019s\u2019possession.\n\f40 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nmoved quickly, touched the brass table and set the pencil rolhng.\nThis it claimed as a success ! and said in answer to questions that\nit was humbug and this was what was intended. Neither Helen\nnor I had the least expectation that it would do this sort of thing.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201c I quote this record \u201d (Mrs Salter\u2019s note continues) \u201c because it\nseems to afford an oddly close parallel to the description nearly\nhalf-way down page thirteen of the test-book of a piece of wood\nwhich gets out of control and hits someone in the legs. But the\nfact which seems to me of chief interest in connexion with this book-\ntest is that in the spring of 1903, when I was within a few months\nof being twenty, I did my first experiments in automatic writing.\nNow the change from table-tilting (which I had done before) to\nautomatic writing, might be described as a transition which bore\nfruit later, for nearly all my subsequent and more interesting experi-\nments in automatism took the form of writing.\u201d\nFor those who do not know the Pinocchio story, it is worth noting\nthat the piece of wood which displays mysterious vitality is the\nbeginning of the existence of Pinocchio the puppet, with its queer,\nsemi-human, marionette-hke behaviour. It does not seem a great\nstretch of the imagination to compare this with the faculty of auto-\nmatism as seen from a communicator\u2019s point of view ;\nand the\nwhole humour and pathos of puppets, which have a place of their\nown in Italian tradition and literature, may easily be thought to\nsupply an intended context to an allusion connecting puppetry with\nautomatism. Dr Verrall was an Italian scholar, and it seems that\nthe whole idea would be in character. I am quite aware that I am\nhere letting imagmation continue beyond the bounds of evidence,\nand I consider that this is a correct experimental use of the imagina-\ntion. One can, equally, try to imagine a probable context of thought\nin a given case and find, very instructively, that the imagination\nis on the wrong track.\nThe \u201c Pinocchio \u201d book-test leads on to the indication of another\nbook at Mrs Salter\u2019s Leonard sitting. The \u201c Pinocchio \u201d book, it\nhas been seen, is clearly marked down at the sitting by its position\non the shelf, and is subsequently estabhshed as a book that could be\npointed out with intention by the communicator. Feda proceeds\nto put the sitter on the track of a second book, this time without\nprecise identification by place :\n\u201c Within a span of the test-book is a book whose title gives the\neffect, no, not quite effect {sotto voce\u2014wait a minute) \u2019tisn\u2019t quite\nright. What would you call it ? It gives the idea of something that\nhappened to your character or personality about the time your lady\npassed over, in a way through her passing over.\u201d\n\f145] fhe Recorded Leonard Material 4]\nTlie contemporary annotation reads :\n\u201c Tlie seventh book to tlie right of the test Imok appeared to be\nthe only book whose title could be considered as applying in any\nway to Feda\u2019s words. This book was entitled La Vita Nuova and\ncame well within the span.\u201d Mrs Salter\u2019s associations with this\ntitle, written down soon after the sitting in 1918, were as follows :\n\u201c My mother died on July 2, 1916, and I was married just about\nnine months before, on Sept. 28, 1915. La Vita Niiova is associated\nin my mind with my wedding because an old friend of my parents.\nDr Butler of Trinity, gave me a beautifully bound copy of it for a\nwedding present with good wishes for my own \u2018\nNew Life \u2019\n. The phrase\nis also associated in my mind with my mother\u2019s death. Several\nfriends writing to her in reply to a letter informing them of the fatal\ncharacter of her illness, referred to my recent marriage, saying that\nmy mother must be glad to think that I should not be left alone,\nbut had now a home of my own ;\nand one friend, writing to me\nimmediately after my mother\u2019s death, said she felt it had been a\ngreat pleasure to my mother to think of the \u2018\nNew Life \u2019\nthat had\nbegun for me. She used these words in quotation marks. It cannot\nof course be said that my new life in the sense of my marriage hap-\npened through my mother\u2019s death, since it preceded it by nine\nmonths, but it should be observed that (a) the word \u2018\neffect \u2019\nwhich\nFeda first uses is rejected as not expressing what the communicator\ndesires to convey, and the word \u2018\nthrough \u2019\nis modified by \u2018\nin a\nway \u2019\n; (6) the break with my old life which was begun by my mar-\nriage was made complete and final by my mother\u2019s death. During\nthe nine months after my marriage when my mother was still alive,\nI spent more than half my tune with her at Cambridge. It was not\nuntil after my mother\u2019s death that my husband and I settled down\ntogether in the house which we now occupy. When we first married\nwe were temporarily in rooms.\u201d\nThere is, clearly, a striking evidential content in these associations,\nwith its mo.st objective point in the existence of a special copy of\nthe book itself as a wedding present ;\nthe only evidential weakness,\nso far (where this case leaves off in the records), is the factor of\nchance in even a highly relevant book-title being \u201c within a span\n\u201d\nof a specified book. One might make very many random selections\nof about fourteen books in a group without finding, in any such\ngroup, one title having such clear relevance to one\u2019s personal\nassociations, and Feda\u2019s indications of time and circumstance cer-\ntainly narrow down the field ;\nbut the thing is not outside coinci-\ndence. On the hypothesis that Dr Verrall inspired the communica-\ntion, and was aware of the form in which it was conveyed, he might\n\f42 KeyinetJi Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nwish to do something further to put his intention beyond reasonable\ndoul)t ;\nor he might have planned this allusion to Dante\u2019s La Vita\nNuova as only one among other converging allusions\u2014a technique\nwhich is suggested by other records as characteristic of this com-\nmunicator. It is towards some such hypothesis that I have been\ndrawn by what followed.\nOn the day following Mrs Salter\u2019s sitting, Aj^ril 24th, 1918, and\nbefore Mrs Salter had verified her book-tests of the 23rd or com-\nmunicated with Lady Troubridge and Miss Eadclyffe Hall, Miss\nRadclytfe Hall was due for a sitting with Mrs Leonard, which she\nattended alone. At the very Ireginning the sitter mentions, for\nexperimental reasons, a change which is being made with regard to\nsome books not in London, and not concerned in the present case.\nFeda acknowledges the information, and quickly changes the sub-\nject, as follows :\n\u201c Yes, that\u2019s all right. She and Mr Arthur \u201d (i.e. Miss Eadclyffe\nHall\u2019s communicator and Dr Verrall) \u201c were doing a test from\nthe London books, they was giving it to Mrs Nellie \u201d (Mrs\nSalter) \u201c yesterday, but they\u2019d got it before yesterday.\u201d (This\nseems to imply previous preparation.) \u201c It was Mr Arthur, not\nherself.\u201d\nTills clearly directs attention to the previous day\u2019s sitting, and a\nsotto-voce remark a little later, \u201c Wait a minute\u2014she told you Mr\nArthur got one \u201d, seems to show anxiety that the point should have\nbeen got through. Feda mentions that \u201c Mr Arthur \u201d had told Mrs\nSalter that the bookshelf was \u201c about four feet from the ground\n\u201d\n(this had l)een an addition to the indications given for identifying\nthe shelf, which was found to lie four feet and three-quarters of an\ninch from the floor).\nThe eighth book from the left is then mentioned, and its 98th\npage, \u201c about half way down \u201d. It is clear enough to the reader\nthat this should lie on the same shelf that was indicated in Mrs\nSalter\u2019s sitting, but Miss Eadclyffe Hall, not knowing about this\nsitting, except from Feda, and being busy with her notes, naturally\nasks, \u201cBut where is the book ?\n\u201d Feda replies :\n\u201c In London where the line of books is. There are two places\nwhere books are. This is the long line of books.\u201d Feda adds that\nthere are curtains in the room of \u201c a dull, dark green \u201d, which is\ncorrect for the room with the long bookshelf ;\nand Miss Eadclyffe\nHall feels assured of knowing exactly where to look. (If she had\nnot been so careful, liut had relied on the reference to Mrs Salter\u2019s\nsitting, they might have been led to compare their findings and to\ndiscover the point which we shall come upon later.)\n\f145]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 43\nThe content of the required book-passage is given in these words :\n\u201c The message is not personal : it\u2019s merely something that she thinks\ncould be applied to the war and its effect upon conditions.\u201d The\npassage is described as \u201c this quite short sentence \u201d, and as being\n\u201c not exactly half way down, a little bit lower \u201d. It is also said\nthat \u201c page 98 appeared to her to fall on the right-hand side of the\nbook It is, I believe, almost invariable that page 1 in a book is\na right-hand page, so that all right-hand pages have odd, not even\nnumbers ;\nand in this instance the relevant passage was found at\nthe fifth line below the middle of the right-hand page 99, facing\npage 98. It is an odd fact that among errors in book-tests, a dis-\nproportion that seems well above chance consists in significant\npassages which are found in the right position on a page, but on the\npage facing the one of which the number has been given\u2014the\npassage found being thus in actual contact with the place indicated\nwhen the book is closed, as it 2\n)resumably is when any \u201c reading\n\u201d\nor \u201c sensing \u201d of its contents occurs for purjjoses of book-tests. The\noccurrence can almost be classed as an evidential error, though it\nmust properly be regarded as halving the odds against a chance\nresult. These odds, however, are enormously high in respect of the\nplacing of a passage among a grouj) of books, supposing the relevance\nof the passage, when placed, to be satisfactory.\nThe eighth book from the left proved to be a Spanish translation\nof The Scarlet Pimpernel, unread by the ex^oerimenters who had\nincluded it in the row, and the passage identified (and translated)\nrefers to :\n\u201c . . . the thought of the brave man who, unknown to fame, had\nrescued hundreds of lives from a terrible, often an unmerciful fate.\u201d\nThe terrors of the war, and what would be the spiritual outcome\nof the ordeal, had been a subject often referred to by Miss Radclyffe\nHall\u2019s communicator. In view of Feda\u2019s description. Miss Radclyffe\nHall picks out the word \u201c terrible \u201d (Spanish horrendo) as having\nchief significance, but I think equal emphasis should be laid on the\nideas of courage and of good service to others, in view of what\nfollows.\nDirectly after the indication quoted above, Feda says :\n\u201c Now wait a minute, within a span of the test-book\u2014Ladye ^\nlikes \u2018\nwithin a span \u2019, it \u2019mooses her !\n\u2014there\u2019s a book whose title\ngives in quite exact terms what the spirit world knows will come out\nof these terrible conditions, it\u2019s exactly right, it wouldn\u2019t have to be\naltered in one letter, it\u2019s what they\u2019s all working for, and what they\nknows will come out of the IVar.\u201d\n' Nickname for the communicator.\n\f44 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nThe only title found relevant was that of a book two places to the\nright of the test-book : Brava Gente (\u201c Good People \u201d). There may\nbe some point in the insistence of the communicator upon the literal\naptness of thisd The association of \u201c brave man \u201d, a natural\nenough translation of the Spanish \u201c valoroso jJCfsonaje \u201d, with the\nItalian \u201c brava \u201d, which does not directly mean \u201c brave \u201d, is acci-\ndental ;\nbut where I think the word \u201c brava \u201d, not changing a letter,\nis of interest, is in the fact that it admirably represents a transition\nfrom the idea of valour to the idea of a courageous tyjre of virtue,\nwhich could well be regarded as a hoped-for outcome of the war.\nIt will be noticed that in this sitting we again have one book\nclearly marked down by position, and another book near to it which\nthe sitter is led to identify with what appears to be sufficient cause.\nAfter this second indication, Feda went on :\n\u201c And close to that last-mentioned book, so close that she would\nalmost dare to say it was the next one \u201d (the experienced Leonard\nsitter will suspect that this may be a Feda-dihition of a positive\nassertion) \u201c is a book whose title also gives correctly what she knows\nwill be given to the world through your work and hers \u201d (com-\nmunicator\u2019s), \u201c that is to say that all you and she and Mrs Una \u201d\n(Lady Troubridge) \u201c and Feda is working for, will result in exactly\nwhat the title of this book says.\u201d\nThe next book on the right to Brava Gente\u2014as will have been\nrealised by those who habitually keep figures in their heads\u2014was\nLa Vita Nuova, the book with the wedding-present and other\nassociations to which Mrs Salter had apparently been directed in her\nbook-test of the previous day ;\nthis test not yet having been\nverified, and Mrs Salter being still in complete ignorance of what\nbooks would be indicated by it.\nIf an entirely different trail was, in fact and intentionally, laid\nto conduct Miss Iladclyffe Hall to the same book that would be\nfound by Mrs Salter, it would have occurred to any experienced\ncommunicator, knowing his S.P.R., that the hypothesis of chance-\ncoincidence had still not been cpiite satisfactorily eliminated. There\nare several other considerations to suggest the advisability of\n}dacing a third shot on the same mark ;\nfor one, glancing shots\nmay be either very skilful or quite accidental, and it would help the\ncase if it were shown that a direct hit could also be made.\nContinuing with Miss liadclylfe Hall\u2019s sitting, we have a few\nremarks about the titles of books, apparently without significance,\nunless to work in a reminder that Dr Verrall is to be taken as co-\noperating in the tests. \u201c You may have to dislodge some of them\n\u201d\n\u2018 Cf. Ail' Salter\u2019s comment on a somewhat similar point, p. 49.\n\f146]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 45\n(the books) \u201c in order to see the title. Mr Arthur remarked that\ntoo, she says.\u201d However, I call attention not only to the re-intro-\nduction of Dr Verrall, but also to the slightly odd use of the word\n\u201c dislodge \u201d. With or without exterior intention, it appears to\ndivert the flow of speech into this channel :\n\u201c Lodge, Lodge, Haymond, that\u2019s their name (sotto voce, Feda\u2019s\nremark about Haymond was velly applopliate) \u2019cos in the eleventh\nbook going from left to right {sotto voce, Well, what page please ?)\nthere is on page three foiu:, thirty-four, there is near the lower 2)art\nof the page, a message for Raymond\u2019s mother which she\u2019ll under-\nstand as it was touched upon in the sitting of Monday. . . . She\u2019ll\nunderstand it and be glad you sent it, the message isn\u2019t from Ray-\nmond, she\u2019ll understand if you say that. . . .\n\u201cYou know, Ladye says it\u2019s so extraordinary, but she has to act\nupon Feda sometimes in a way Feda don\u2019t understand when she\u2019s\nin the medium, and she was aflaid Feda wouldn\u2019t take up the refer-\nence to Raymond, so she had to worry to get a word that would\nsuggest Raymond to Feda ;\nshe says she\u2019s done that often and she\u2019s\nwondered if you had guessed she was doing that, and how carefully\nshe has to lead Feda to a new idea. Feda knows that, \u2019cos when\nFeda\u2019s in the medium she\u2019s only got hke half of Feda\u2019s own sense,\nshe\u2019s not half so clever as when she\u2019s out of the medium !\n\u201d\nThe eleventh book from the left was La Vita Nuova itself. The\nverification of an appropriate passage contains the same evidential\nflaw which we noticed in the case of the book in Spanish. The\npassage recognised as relevant to Lady Lodge, when the test was\nreferred to her, occiu's \u201c near the lower part of the page \u201d (actually\nwithin the last eight lures), not of page 34, but of the opposite page\n35. Translated, it runs as follows :\n\u201c He could not do to you being dead that which, living, he would\nnever have done to you ;\nhe hes under another sky than yours,\nnor must you hope ever to see him, until that day when all your\nfellow citizens will be visible to you, and you will be able to see\ntheir faults examined and punished by a Just Judge.\n\u201c Therefore if hatreds, angers and unfriendlinesses cease with\ndeath in whosoever dies, as is beheved ...\u201d\nLady Lodge\u2019s statement reads :\n\u201c The message is understood by M.F.A.L.\u201d (Lady Lodge) \u201c who\nknows from whom it comes.\n\u201c She has reason to think that a certain friend has been trying\nfor a long time to set her mind at rest. He has since said through\nanother and mdependent channel that he feels he has accomphshed\nthat, and is happier in consequence.\u201d\n\f46 Kenneth Richmo'nd : Preliminary Studies of [part\nThe verification shows relevance rather than points of evidence\nthat can be put down in black and white ;\nFeda\u2019s reference to\n\u201c the sitting of Monday \u201d is, unfortunately, not mentioned ;\nbut\nthis selection of the book for the third time can be held to show\nthat a direct hit could be made, so as to settle any question of real\nintention to pick out La Vita Nuova. It will be remembered that\nthe medium\u2019s mind could not, as we can, calculate in either of the\ntwo previous instances that the eleventh book from the left was\nbeing indicated, because in both cases the indirect indications\nincluded the undetermined distance \u201c within a span \u201d, which had\nto be made definite by something observed by the sitter to be\nuniquely appropriate in the titles within that distance. Clear\nobjective directions, given in all three cases, would have been less\nevidential. The third selection of La Vita Nuova is not, however,\nsupported only by the direct method of indicating the book ;\naccepting the occurrence of an intended passage in the right part\nof the page opposite to the page indicated (which I think justified\nby the evidence in many parallel cases), the passage quoted is very\ndefinitely on the relation between the dead and the living, and is\nrecognised as appropriate to the annotator to whom it is definitely\nreferred. Lady Lodge, proving also not to be a \u201c Raymond \u201d\nmessage, in agreement with the Feda statement that it is not.\nIf we look at these three converging references to La Vita Nuova,\nput together, and examine the whole subject-matter that is raised\nby them to see whether, as a whole, it contains any evidence of\ndesign, we come upon the quite interesting fact that a general con-\ncept, \u201c The New Life \u201d, is linked by the material with three suc-\ncessive views of human progress through time. First, in the material\ngiven and elicited by Mrs Salter\u2019s book-test, a retrospective picture\nis formed of the new life that begins with marriage and the severance\nof family ties ;\nand there is presented with this the picture of\nanother actual change, towards a more free and expressive tech-\nnique of automatism, and the \u201c new life \u201d of that curious puppet in\nthe subliminal which most automatists will recognise as having its\nstrings (and occasionally its leg) pulled by various agencies.\nSecond, in the book-test given to Miss Radclyffe Hall, the picture\nextends from what were present-time conditions in the spring of\n1918\u2014war, and terror overcome by courage\u2014to a prospective hope\nof \u201c a new life \u201d on this earth for hrava gente ;\nand this is closely\nlinked with the thought of new work on the problem of communica-\ntion as l:)ringing \u201c new life \u201d in a further sense.\nIt will be noticed that the direction of thought to reminiscence\n\f145]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 47\nin the first sitting, and to present and prospective terrestrial life in\nthe second, could in itself come from the medium\u2019s mind normally,\nthough without the confirmation and context that are supplied\nthrough book-passages and titles unknown to the medium. In\nthese episodes it is part of the evidence that pointers should be\ngiven, at the sittings, to past and to present time. But in the third\ncase, the book-test given to Lady Lodge, no indication is or need be\ngiven at the sitting to locate, as it were, the subject of reference,\nand we discover that the book-passage actually found (accepting\nthe method of finding) constructively extends the sequence leading\nfrom the past to the terrestrial present and future, into the concep-\ntion of a discarnate future in which thoughts of judgment and\nexpiation pass into the thought of hatreds, angers and unfriendli-\nnesses ceasing with death.\nI should not for one moment say that this constructive appear-\nance of the total product proves design ;\nthe construction might be\npartly that of coincidence and partly my own. What I am pointing\nout is that it is consistent with design. If a series of three complex\nprocesses, which seem to carry intention throughout and to be dir-\nected to a common end, resulted in an end-product to which no\nfurther element of design and meaning could be attributed, there\nwould be the less reason to give weight to the whole hypothesis of\nintention.\nThe better I may have succeeded in my attempt to set out this\ncase clearly, the odder it may have seemed to the reader that\npractised investigators such as those concerned at the time did not\nobserve the triple reference to La Vita Nuova and follow up the\nclue. Having the records before me as they were ultimately and\nmethodically arranged for filing, I myself blundered considerably\nthrough failure to keep clear all the different elements of movement,\ntime and place that were involved, before I had distinct in my mind\nsuch questions as who went where, did w^hat, and noted it down\nwhen. The actual process of collecting and properly compiling\nbook-test material requires a concentration on accuracy in detail\nduring which it is very difficult to step back from a case and look\nat it as a whole ;\nand at the time of these sittings, and later of Mrs\nSidgwick\u2019s Examination of Book-Tests (by which time the elements\nof this La Vita Nuova case were in separate files), the whole focus of\nattention was upon the success or failure of individual tests, though\nthe Examination takes note of several apparent cross-correspond-\nences. And, as I have remarked, the investigators were using the\ncorrect amoimt of caution against collaborating too much and so\nvitiating future evidence.\n\f48 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nAnotlier very natural question is whetlier, if there were design in\nthis case, there would not be some hint of suljsequent effort by the\ndesigner, after realising that a carefully prepared structure of\nevidence had passed unnoticed. To take things in the order in\nwhich they were observed, but not interpreted, by the investigators,\nthis is what happened next. Mrs Salter\u2019s sitting was on the 23rd,\nand Miss Radclj^e Hall\u2019s on the 24th, of April 1918. On the 26th\n(a date which will be significant later). Lady Troubridge, Mrs Salter\nand Miss Radclyffe Hall met in London and went to Miss Radclyffe\nHall\u2019s flat for the purpose of verifying the book-tests. We must\nnow jump forward to the next occasion on which Dr Verrall pur-\nported to communicate at a Leonard sitting. This was on May 15th,\n1918, Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall being the sitters.\nA book-test was given of which the record opens thus :\n\u201c Feda\ndon\u2019t know what Mr Arthur\u2019s come for today. . . . He\u2019s pleased to\ncome, but he has a funny feehng that someone asked him to come,\nor suggested his coming. ...\u201d\nIt is possible, on our communicator-hypothesis, that the last\nwords have to do with some committee-work behind Dr Verrall\u2019s\nco-operation, the \u201c funny feeling \u201d representing a vagueness of\nFeda\u2019s. At all events, it is clear that Dr Verrall is supposed to be\nsomewhat unexpectedly present.\nIn the ensuing book-test, in which Dr Verrall is specifically said\nto be takmg part, though, as usual, the communicator \u201c Ladye \u201d is\nsaid to be giving the instructions to Feda, the bookshelf is given as\n\u201c in your room in London \u201d (Miss Radclyffe Hall\u2019s) \u201c not the books\nin one row, the books in several rows \u201d. The rest of the instructions,\nfor the book which is of mterest in our present case, are sufficiently\nrecapitulated in the following notes by Lady Troubridge on the\nverification.\n\u201c She \u201d (Feda) \u201c tells us that upon the shelf beneath the highest\nshelf of the book-case, a book has been selected by Dr Verrall. This\nbook is said to be at the end of the row nearly, on the left hand side.\nIt is said to be a book whose title should be taken as a watchword\nby M.R.H., U.V.T., and Mrs Salter. In Dr Verrall\u2019s opinion it is\nan excellent watchword, it is something for them all to keep in\nfront of them, and to know that \u2018\nin very truth \u2019\nit will be their\nwatchword. Dr Verrall says through Feda that they will under-\nstand why this will be their watchword, and that it is all linked up\nwith the work which they are doing.\n\u201c On the extreme left hand side of that shelf, being in fact the\nthird book from the left, was a book entitled Nova SolymaN\nIt is explained that Nova Solyma\u2014New Jerusalem\u2014together with\n\f145]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 49\nthe content and meaning of the book, conveys an idea of lieautiful\norder which tlie annotators find relevant as a \u201c watchword \u201d for\ntheir work in psychical research. It may occur to us, with our\npresent knowledge, that there is a reiterated attem])t to draw atten-\ntion to the words. The phrases summarised by Lady Troubridge\ninclude :\n\u201c What\u2019s a watchword ? Keeping time ? No it isn\u2019t, he\nsays \u201d ;\nand later the actual phrasing is \u201c in very truth it will Ire\nyour watchword, he says you\u2019ll understand why ;\nit\u2019s all linked up\nwith the work that you\u2019re doing I suggest only that this may\nbe an attempt to get the verifiers and Mrs Salter to associate from\nNova Solyma back to La Vita Nuova, and to ask themselves where\nand how La Vita Nuova had occurred in their work. If so, the\nattempt nearly had its effect, for Lady Troubridge has a later note\nin the records coimectmg Nova Solyma wdth the occurrence of La\nVita Nuova in Miss Radclyffe Hall\u2019s sitting. But Mrs Salter\u2019s\nrecord about La Vita Nuova was in her own safe keeping, and the\nthird case sent to Lady Lodge was not remembered.\nAfter this present paper was in typescript Mr W. H. Salter saw it,\nand raised a point which was unknown to me, about the very special\ninterest taken by Dr Verrall, as a scholar, in the truth of words to\ntheir etymological meanings. Dr Verrall had made it clear\u2019^ that in\nthe Greek dramatists a word or name is given significance as being\nimpressively \u201c true \u201d to a given context or situation because of a\ndouble meaning which it bears by derivation. What in modern\nEnglish would seem a mere play upon words, and in Shakespeare\nsupphes a type of punning which to us appears strained and labori-\nous, was to the Greek mind a part of the magic of words, so that\ncoincidences of derived nieanhig could make the application of a\nword especially \u201c true \u201d (eVapo?). In this connexion, Mr Salter points\nto the use by the Verrall communicator of the words \u201c in very truth\n\u201d\nand their application to the book\u2019s title. (The reader may have\nshared my own feeling that the use of this phrase was curious, and\ncalled for some explanation.) Mr Salter remarks that if this par-\nticular idea of \u201c truth \u201d in derived meaning was intended by\nLeonard-Verrall, \u201c the point is the etymological significance of\nSolyma = Salem = Peace. Very possibly Mrs Leonard knew that\nequation. By clairvoyance, if that faculty is to be admitted, she\nmight be able to give the location of a book with that title, but she\ncould not possibly know the special significance of the words \u201c in\nvery truth \u201d for her communicator, excejrt as the result of some\nfurther faculty of supernormal cognition.\u201d\n* Notably, as Mr Salter points out, in a long appendix on the use of ^ru\/xos\nand eT-qTVfxoi, which occurs in Dr Verrall\u2019s edition of The Seven Against Thebes.\n\f50 Kenneth Richmond : Preliminary Studies of [part\nIt seems to me that this characteristic point about Dr Verrall\u2019s\nsensitivity to words adds to the ajjpropriateness of Nova Solyrna in\nthe whole context in which La Vita Nuova was given at Miss Kad-\nclyffe Hall\u2019s sitting of May 24th, 1918, with its transition from war to\nan outcome in terms of human and spiritual values ;\nand in com-\nmenting upon that sitting I have referred (without knowing when\nI wrote of Dr. Verrall\u2019s special attitude towards derivative mean-\nings) to the possibihty of a derivative interpretation of the title\nBrava Gente 44), considering the insistence at the sitting upon\n\u201c quite exact terms It struck me that a philological point was\ninvolved, and I had in mind (and introduced into my phrasing) the\nparallel association of virtus, valour, with virtue. It can be worth\nwhile to explore these rather fine-spun contexts, when the process\nconsists in making sure that a broad structure of evidence does not\nshow poverty when it is followed up into its finer details.\nFollowing upon the \u201c in very truth \u201d passage in the sitting, we\nhave this :\n\u201c (sotto voce. You know that in forming a bridge . . . the bridge\nbuilders)\u2014no, you haven\u2019t got it right, it\u2019s that he thinks of you as\nthe bridge builders. . . . He says bridges can\u2019t be builted from one\nside only. ...\u201d\nThis passage led on to a book-test which caused the verifiers to\nnote a number of references to Kij)ling (whose story called \u201c The\nBridge-Builders \u201d will be remembered), and to discover from Mrs\nSalter that an interest in Kijding\u2019s work was characteristic of Dr\nVerrall. The book-test was evidential, and was taken from Captains\nCourageous, which somewhat echoes the theme of bravery, but its\ndetails would take us somewhat far afield. It served the function\nof emphasising \u201c bridge-1 )uilding \u201d in an evidential association with\nDr Verrall, with a possible intention which we shall observe in a\nmoment.\nIt will l)e recalled that in the sitting with which we are now deal-\ning (May 15, 1918), the first l)ook-test opened with the introduction\nof Dr Verrall and the question of his reason for coming. The way\nin which this was put puzzled the investigators, and Lady Trou-\nbridge notes that in another part of the sitting Feda said :\n\u201c Do you know if Mrs Nellie\u2019s been anywhere 1 \u201d (This means\nMrs Salter.) And again, \u201c Feda feels it\u2019s something to do with Mrs\nNellie, and that\u2019s perhaps what Ijrought Mr Arthur here as well as\nthe book-test.\u201d\nLady Troubridge\u2019s notes (slightly paraphrased) record the next\nprocedure :\n\u201c On Friday May 24th, 1918, Miss Radclyffe Hall wrote to Mrs\n\f145]\nthe Recorded Leonard Material 51\nSalter, enclosing the notes of the sitting and asking her if she could\nthrow any hght on that part of the test concerning her. On May\n27th, 1918, Miss Radclyffe Hall and I called on Mrs Salter at the\nS.P.R., when Mrs Salter handed us her answer to the letter, which\nI\nshe had not yet posted. The chief interest hes in the fact that on\nApril 27th, 1918, Mrs Salter herself had produced a piece of automa-\ntic script. It was the only piece of script produced by her between\nFebruary 15th, 1918, and May 23rd, 1918, and that script opens\nwith these words :\nThe bridge and the river . . . Misericordiam Domini.\u201d\nNow !Mrs Salter had the impulse to write this script on April 27th,\nthe day after she had met Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall\nand they had failed to associate the three separate references to La\n; TTYa Mwora with one another. I am inclined to think that' the sense\nof Misericordiam Domini \u201d might appropriately be brought out\nby an exclamation mark.\nThe \u201c bridge \u201d references led Mrs Salter to look up a much older\nscript of hers (Feb. 24th, 1916), containing the words \u201c An arch and\na bridge over a river . . . not the bridge of sighs, but it is a real\nbridge ... a triple arch \u201d.\nThis was written in other circumstances, but the fact that i\\Ir3\nSalter, an automatist, found herself associating it with the more\nrecent script may have relevance. \u201c Triple arch \u201d certainly aroused\nassociations in Lady Troubridge\u2019s mind with a curious point about\nI\nthe sitting at which, apparently by Dr Verrall\u2019s instigation, all this\nhad arisen. I quote again from her notes :\n\u201c Note the words, \u2018\nA triple arch \u2019, as having a possible bearing\non this book-test of May 15th, 1918. Three figures rather conspicu-\nously in a part of the test. M.V.B.\u201d (\u201c Ladye \u201d in Feda\u2019s nomen-\nclature) \u201c and Dr VerraU make reference to three of Kipling\u2019s works.\nDr VerraU selects three people as his bridge-builders, namely Mrs\nSalter, M.R.H., and U.V.T. In Kiphng\u2019s story, \u2018\nThe Bridge-\nBuUders \u2019, there are three, and only three, principal characters,\n'\nnamely the chief engineer, his young assistant, and their faithful\nnative foreman. ...\u201d\nIt woidd perhaps have been less interesting if the three references\nto La Vita Nuova had been observed and put together before these\nwords were written. The recurrent threes in the material, if they\nhad been noticed after the fact of the triple reference to La Vita\n'\nNuova, might have suggested coincidence-hunting. But when this\nfact of the recurrent threes is noticed as a curious and insistent\nphenomenon in a VerraU communication, and left practically un-\nexplained, because the fact to which this insistence could be a\n\f52 Kenneth Richmond [part 145]\npointer has remained hidden, we seem to have intention observed,\nso to speak, in the air, the observer liaving no point of attachment\nfor it but still emphatically feeling it to l^e significant.\nIt may be noted that eleven years later, Aug. 2nd, 1929, the Rev.\nAh S. Irving was given a group of l)ook-tests from books in Mr\nSalter\u2019s house at Newport, Dr Verrall being said to co-operate with\nthe late Mrs Irving in producing the tests. Among the indications\nat Mr Irving\u2019s sitting with Mrs Leonard (of which an excellent\nverbatim record is on file) was a reference to christening and babies,\nrelated to a Ijook which Mr Salter identified in his shelves as another\ncopy of La Vita Ntiova\u2014Messrs. Kegan Paul\u2019s small edition (1903)\nentitled The New Life, with Itahan text and English translation on\nalternate pages. The editor and translator was Dr Luigi Ricci, and\nthe fly-leaf of this copy bears an inscription with Dr Ricci\u2019s signature\njiaying homage to Dr Verrall as a cidtore of Italian literature. The\nallusion was without significance for Mr Irving, but could well be\ntaken as a personal touch introduced for the benefit of Mr and Mrs\nSalter, who were then awaiting the birth of their second child.\nThey had had previous evidential references to the coming birth of\nboth their children through Mrs Leonard, ])urporting to be given\nby Dr. Verrall. This \u201c new life \u201d reference was not stringently\nevidential, and was more in the nature of an appropriate by-product\nof the Irving material ;\nbut again, it would have lessened the whole\ncase for intention in connexion with Dr Verrall and La Vita Nnova\nif the allusion had l)een quite out of context with the material given\neleven years before. As it is, Mrs Salter is first referred to \u201c new\nlife \u201d in connexion with her marriage, and then again in connexion\nwith the birth of a child, the construction of a book-test for an\nindependent sitter providing the 0]\n)port unity to give some evidential\nvalue to the latter reference.\nHere, so far as I have observed in the records, the evidence in\nthe \u201c La Vita Nuova \u201d case ends. If I were to give further rein to\nspeculation, I should wonder whether it was thought after the \u201c Nova\nSolyma \u201d attenqit that further efforts would be unavailing to bring\nits separated components, now rapidly liecoming overlaid with\nnew material of interest, together again ;\nor whether perhaps it was\nforeseen, in the fuller prescience which we are told is possessed by\nthe discarnate, tliat the records would in diie time l)e assembled,\nand that later still their connexion would be observed by some in-\nvestigator undistracted by the rush and pressure of ever-fresh cases\nto be noted, annotated, and put in order for the service of research.\n\f\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety tor Psychical Research\nPART 146\nMRS HENRY SIDGWICK\u2019S WORK IN PSYCHICAL\nRESEARCH\nBy Alice Johnson\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick was tlie daughter of James Maitland\nBalfour, of Whittingehame, Prestonkirk, East Lothian, and Lady\nBlanche Balfour, daughter of the second Marquis of Salisbury. She\nwas born in 1845, the eldest of a family of three daughters and five\nsons. From an early age she showed a special aptitude for mathe-\nmatics, which she studied first under the village schoolmaster at\nWhittingehame, and later with the help of her brother-in-law. Lord\nRayleigh. While he was Professor of Experimental Physics at\nCambridge, 1879-1884, he was pursuing his researches on Electrical\nMeasurements, in which work he had the assistance of Mrs Sidgwick,\nand with her carried out his classical measurements on the Silver\nVoltameter and the Latimer Clark Cell, thus establishing definitely\nthe units of resistance, current and electromotive force. They pub-\nhshed three papers jointly in the Philosophical Transactions of the\nRoyal Society.\nLord Rayleigh, like other great English physicists of that period,\nhabitually employed the simplest form of apparatus, making use of\nwhatever came nearest to hand, and yet obtaining results of sur-\nprising accuracy, which were only further substantiated by more\nelaborate research.\nMrs Sidgwick had the same preference for the simplest kind of\napparatus for whatever work^ she was engaged in ;\nalthough inter-\nested in all mechanical devices, she was never tempted to become\nso far interested in perfecting them as to lose sight of the ends they\nwere intended to serve.\n^ This was also characteristic of her brother, F. M. Balfour, in his biological\nwork.\no 53\n\f54 Alice Jolmson : Airs Henry Sidgundc\u2019 [part\nLike other nienil)ers of lier family, she took a keen interest in\nscience generally. But she once remarked to me that mathematics\nes})ecially a])2\n)ealcd to her in early youtli because she thought a\nfuture life would be much more worth living if it included intellectual\n])ursuits, and I imagine tlie abstract nature of pure mathematics\nseemed to her specially adapted to a disembodied existence.\nThe last important paper contributed by Mrs Sidgwick to the\nProceedings (written at the age of eighty-seven) was the History of\nthe S.P.K., compiled for the Society\u2019s Jubilee in 1932, and published\nin voh xli. This article must, I think, have seemed to older mem-\nbers not unlike the tragedy of Hamlet with the Prince of Denmark\nleft out, for there is hardly anything in it about her own share in the\nhistory, beyond the general statement that she was cognisant from\nthe beginning of what was in the minds of the founders of the Society\nand was herself in the inner circle of workers.\nThe present paj^er attempts to redress the balance. Yet it is\nini])ossible to draw the line between work done by Mrs Sidgwick\nalone and that done in co-operation with others\u2014especially, of\ncourse, with her husband. Though their capacities and tempera-\nments were in many respects dissimilar, the comradeship between\nthem was so profound and far-reaching that I venture to quote\nbelow some passages from his writings\u2014for he was always readier of\nex])ression than she\u2014to throw light on her attitude and her doings.\nHenry Sidgwick, her elder by seven years, had naturally been\ninterested in the subject the earlier of the two. In his first Presi-\ndential Address in 1882 he says that his interest dated back for\nnearly twenty years i.e. to the time when he was a young man of\naljout twenty-four, already engrossed in the problems of rehgion and\n])hilosophy which dominated his life, and already perceiving the\nintimate bearing of psychical research on them.\nPhysical Phenomena of Spiritualism\nSome ten years later, the experiments of Crookes with D. D.\nHome, though generally ignored by men of science, roused keen\ninterest in a few who were sufficiently open-minded to recognise in\nthem a primafacie case for investigation ;\nand Sidgwick with several\nof his friends had sittings with mediums who were reported to\npossess telekinetic powers. The then popular estimate of the subject\nis shown in a letter he wrote to Myers after some experiments at\nNewcastle in which Hensleigh Wedgwood (cousin and brother-in-law\nof Charles Darwin) took part \u201c Wedgwood is sincerely concerned\nabout our proposed seances at Cambridge. He thinks the Master\n\f140]\nWork in Psychical Pesearcli 55\n[of Trinity] would be sustained by public opinion if he dismissed\nme ! So there is yet a chance of one\u2019s |)Osing as Galileo.\u201d\nSittings were also held in Loudon, in the houses of Sidgwick\u2019s\nfriend and former pupil A. J. Balfour, and of Lord Bayleigh. Miss\nBalfour (who married Henry Sidgwick in 1876) was then keeping\nhouse for her brother, and so came to join the circle in 1874, and\nshowed at once her aptitude for the investigation. She brought to\nit the indefatigable patience and perseverance that such work\nrequires ;\nshe was a keen observer and ingenious in devising simjile\nand effective tests. She learnt much about conjuring, and was an\nadept in detecting tricks and codes. (When in later life she read\ndetective stories, she lost interest in them at an early stage, because\nshe generally guessed the solution of the mystery at the first hints\ngiven.)\nIn her paj^er, written in 1886, on \u201c The Physical Phenomena of\nSpiritualism \u201d {Proc., vol. iv, pp. 46 ff.) she says that she well re-\nmembers her first sitting in 1874, \u201c on account of the interest excited\nby the idea that, notwithstanding the very inconclusive character\nof the phenomena that occurred, we might possibly be communicat-\ning with beings belonging to another world.\u201d The possibilities of\nfraud, illusion and mal-observation are discussed ;\nbut in spite of\nmuch definite proof of trickery and little evidence for anything\ngenuine having been obtained, she ends characteristically :\n\u201cIt is not because I disbelieve in the physical phenomena of\nspiritualism, but because I at present think it more probable than\nnot that such things occasionally occur that I am interested in\nestimating the evidence for them. I feel bound, however, to admit\nthat by far the larger part of the testimony put forward as affording\nsolid ground for a belief in them which I have been able to examine\nis of such a nature as to justify the contempt with which scientific\nmen generally regard it. . . . If what I have written should contri-\nbute, in however small a degree, to the improvement of the evidence\non this subject in the future, I shall feel that it has not been written\nin vain.\u201d\nThe open-mindedness of this conclusion did not save the paper\nfrom vehement attacks in the spiritualistic papers, and there was\nmuch discussion, in which both the Sidgwicks took part, in vols. ii\nand iii of the Journal.\nAt about this time the classical researches of Hodgson and Davey\ninto the possibilities of mal-observation and laj)se of memory were\nbeing carried on. In particular they showed that continuous obser-\nvation was a practical impossibility, so that evidence which de-\npended solely on watching the medium was always unreliable.\n\f66 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry SirlgwicFs [part\nDavey was an amateur conjurer of extraordinary skill in imitating\nso-called \u201c sjuritistic \u201d ])licnomena, such as \u201c slate-writing,\u201d sup-\nposed to be ])i'oduced on the inner surfaces of two slates fastened\ntogether. Unfortunately, he died of typhoid fever at the age of\ntwenty-seven, in Decemlier 1890. Mrs Sidgwick was thoroughly\nconversant with all this work (for which see Proc., vols. iv and viii),\nand often referred to it in her writings.\nThe Question of Fraudulent Mediums\nOne question in dis])ute with the spiritualists was whether further\nexperiments should l^e tried witli mediums who had been convicted\nof fraud. On this jjoint Henry Sidgwick took a strong line. He\n.says {Proc., vol. iv, p. 101) :\n\u201cIf it had occurred to me when I addressed the Society four\nyears ago that we should be seriously urged to investigate the\nperformances of \u2018\nmediums \u2019\nwhose trickery was proved and\nadmitted, I should certainly have repudiated the suggestion with\nall the emphasis that I could command. But I then believed\u2014\nand ventured to say\u2014that spiritualists had been impressed by the\n\u2018\nevidence accumulated in recent years to show that at least a\ngreat ])art of the extraordinary ]:>henoniena referred to spiritual\nagency in England and America are really due to trickery and\nfraud of some land.\u2019 I hoped, therefore, that educated spiritual-\nists would generally agree with me in condemning what I called\n\u2018\nthe obstinacy with which mediums against whom fraud has been\nproved have been afterwards defended,\u2019 and in regretting that\nsuch persons should, as I said, \u2018\nhave been able to go on with their\ntrade after exposure no less than before.\u2019 I never thought that\nwe should be called upon to give direct encouragement to this\ntrade by undertaking a formal investigation of the \u2018 jdienomena\n\u2019\nexhibited by such persons.\u201d\n[Op. cit., p. 105) :\n\u201c I should certainly not [put forward results obtained under satis-\nfactory conditions] as evidence if I knew the supjjosed medium to\nbe a detected impostor. Nor should I seek evidence from such\ntainted sources\u2014not because I hold that evidence involving trick-\nsters cannot be raised to a pitch that would exclude explanation\nby trickery, except on the supposition of the investigator\u2019s\nidiocy ;\nbut because an extended experience has led me to regard\nthe chance of its being so raised as too shght to counterbalance\nthe palpable evil of encouraging an unmoral trade.\u201d\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 57\nSidgwick\u2019s arguments on this point convinced his colleagues, and\nthe Council agreed that the money of the Society should not be spent\neither on investigations of mediums who had once been clearly\ndetected in fraud, or in printing reports of such investigations. This\nprinciple was adhered to throughout Sidgwick\u2019s life-time, and was\nadopted by Myers in selecting his material for Human Personality.\nI lay stress on the point, because I think the attitude ofthe Sidgwicks\non it has often been mismulerstood. They never maintained that\nbecause a medium had cheated once, none of his j)erforniances could\nbe genuine. But they condemned the tacit encouragement given by\nthe majority of spirituahsts at that time to fraudulent mediums,\nwho knew that no exposure would prevent their continuing to drive\na prohtable trade ;\nand the consequent discouragement of honest\namateurs, who might object to be classed in the same category with\nthe disreputable professional.\nFoundation of the Society\nTo resume the chronological sequence : their repeated failures to\nobtain positive results from \u201c physical \u201d mediums had somewhat\ndiscouraged the investigators, when their hopes were revived by the\nsuccessful experiments in thought-transference carried out by\nBarrett, with the help of Gurney, Myers and others, in 1881 and\n1882, which led to the foundation of the S.P.R. in 1882. This was\nan event of the greatest interest to the Sidgwicks and they did\ntheir utmost for the success of the new venture. Not only did\nthey contribute generously to its funds at different periods, both\nfor special and for general purposes ;\nthe time and labour they\ngave to it were unstinted. Henry Sidgwick was elected the first\nPresident ;\nevery attempt was made to enlist siqoporters of all\nshades of opinion, and there were several leading spiritualists on the\nfirst Council e.g. C. C. Massey, Stainton Moses, Dawson Rogers\nand Hensleigh M^edgwood. Though these members dropped off\none by one, on account of the stringency of evidence demanded by\nthe majority of their colleagues, Massey and Wedgwood, who were\npersonal friends of the Sidgwicks, remained on terms of intimacy\nwith them.\nThe study of Telepathy now became the principal, though by no\nmeans the sole, work of the Society, and we loiow that it is in this\nfield\u2014using the word Telepathy in its widest connotation\u2014that our\nmost important positive results have been obtained.\n\f58 Alice Johnson : Mi's Henry Sidgwich\u2019s [part\nPhantasms of the Living\nTliis book embodied the results of the first few years\u2019 work ;\nbegun\nin 1883, it was published in two bulky volumes in 1886 under the\nnames of Myers, Gurney and Podmore. Both the Sidgwicks took a\nlarge share in the work ;\nthey corresponded with informants, inter-\nviewed witnesses, and were consulted at every stage by the authors.\nMrs Sidgwick also sj)ent much time and labour over the proof-\nreading.\nThe book deals exhaustively with the subject of Hallucination,\ndistinguishing between the subjective type, which originates in the\nmind of the percipient, and the veridical type, containing an element\ndue to that influence from without, operating otherwise than through\nthe known sense channels, for which Myers had coined the word\nTelepathy. A Veridical Hallucination is deceptive in that it suggests\nthe presence of a material object where it is not, but truth-telhng in\nbeing coincident with a real event connected with the appearance,\nsuch as an apparition seen at the time of death of the person repre-\nsented.\nFor the first time canons of evidence were formulated, applicable\nto a miscellaneous field of unusual phenomena, hitherto the haj^py\nhunting ground of cranks. The writers set forth the principles on\nwhich reports should be accepted or rejected. Included is an inter-\nesting \u201c Note on Witchcraft \u201d by Gurney, which forms a complete\ntreatise on the subject, showing that some narratives are based on\nmere hearsay and others on substantial evidence, the latter being\ngenerally exjjficable by known causes, such as hysteria or suggestion.\nPhantasms of the Dead\nThe first important paper in the Proceedings pubhshed under Mrs\nSidgwick\u2019s own name was in vol. iii (1885) on \u201c Phantasms of the\nHead.\u201d These are defined as \u201c all kinds of imj>ressions on human\nminds which there seems any reason to refer to the action, in some\nway or other, of deceased jjersous.\u201d The material consisted of about\n37U narratives\u2014chosen out of a much larger number\u2014mostly of\napparitions, but excluding apparitions seen at the moment of death,\nor a tew hours after, since these were classed with \u201c Phantasms of\nthe Living,\u201d as possibly due to tclepatliy, instantaneous or deferred,\nfrom a living person.\nMrs Sidgwick gives reasons for holding that most of the cases\nafforded little or no evidence for the action of the dead. Enquirers\nare probably more aware now than they were then of what consti-\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 59\ntutes good evidence ;\nyet mucli of the criticism then j^ut forward\nmight still be found useful. The rest of the cases, though they did\nnot suggest any satisfactory theory about communication with the\ndead and were far from proving its possibility, yet seemed to merit\nserious consideration. She observes that no single case, however\nremarkable, could prove conclusively the agency of the dead ;\nonly\nthe cumulative effect of much good evidence could justify behef\nin it.\nReport on Theosophy\nIn the same vol. (iii, pp. 382 ff.) is the \u201c Report of the Committee\non Theosophical Phenomena,\u201d of which Mrs Sidgwick was a member.\nThe Theosophical Society was founded in New York in 1875 by\nColonel Olcott and Mme Blavatsky. Mine Blavatsky came to\nCambridge in 1884, was present at a meeting of the Cambridge\nBranch of the S.P.R. and produced a favourable impression on the\nleading members. She maintained the existence in Thibet of a\nBrotherhood with occult powers, of whom she herself was a Chela\nor disciple. These Brothers (Adepts or Mahatmas) were alleged to\nbe able to cause \u201c astral forms \u201d of themselves to appear at a dis-\ntance and to transport material objects, especially letters, super-\nnormally wherever they chose. Hodgson was sent out to the head-\nquarters of the Society in India in November 1884 to collect and\ninvestigate evidence for its claims, and returned in April 1885. The\nRepqrt of the Committee w\u2019as based to a large extent, but not ex-\nclusively, on his investigations, which resulted in the exposure of\nMme Blavatsky.\nSome of the evidence for fraud was furnished by Mme Coulomb, a\nformer confederate of Mme Blavatsky\u2019s, who turned informer ;\nbut\nher statements were checked and a large number of other witnesses\nwere examined by Hodgson. He investigated the \u201c Occult Room \u201d\nwhere \u201c phenomena \u201d occurred, and found there confirmatory signs\nof the apparatus that had been described to him, and which had been\ndismantled and destroyed before his visit. It consisted of a \u201c Shrine\u201d\nplaced against a wall, on the other side of which was Mme Blavatsky\u2019s\nbedroom. The shrine had a sliding panel at the back, opening into\na recess in the wall, which communicated with the bedroom through\nanother opening, and presumably the objects found in the shrine\nwere passed through this channel.\nIt also appeared that the handwriting of the occult letters had a\nstriking resemblance to the undoubted handwriting of Mme Blavat-\nsky. Mrs Sidgwick made a minute analysis of the resemblances, and\na handwriting expert to whom the documents were submitted agreed\n\f60 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry Sidgiviclc\u2019s [part\nwith her opinion that Mine Blavatsky had forged the letters. The\nresemblances are shown in facsimiles given in the Report.\n\u201c Spiritualism \u201d in the EncyclopcBclia Britannica\nAt about this time (1885-86) Mrs Sidgwick wrote a concise but\ncomprehensive history of Spiritualism for the Ninth Edition (1875-\n1889) of the EncydopcBdia Britannica, the volume containing her\narticle being published in 1887. The article deals with what is called\n\u201c Modern Spiritualism,\u201d the movement which started in America in\n1848 with the \u201c spirit rappings \u201d of the Fox family by which com-\nmunications from the dead were suj^jiosed to be received. The\nmovement spread from America over many European countries ;\nMrs Hayden brought \u201c Table-turning \u201d from Boston in 1852 and\nD. 1). Home came in 1855. Trance-speaking, both in private and\npublic, became very common, and sometimes information unknown\nto the medium was given, which might be due to the action of other\nminds on his. But as the trance-sjieakers were supposed to be in-\nspired to utter rehgious truths, spirituahsm became a religious move-\nment. This development became marked first at Keighley in York-\nshire in 1855, being especially prevalent among miners in the north.\nBy 1885 there were two weekly newspapers. Light and The Medium\nand Daybreak, which advertised weekly meetings.\nThe phenomena were of two classes : (a) the physical, such as\nraps, movements of objects without contact, fights, materialisations,\n\u201c direct \u201d writing, and spirit photography ;\nand (6) the much com-\nmoner automatic type, such as trance-speaking or writing admitted\nto be performed by the medium\u2019s own organism, but alleged to be\ndue to spirits controlling the organism.\nIn the first class fraud was frec|uently discovered ;\nthus, it was\nfound that the Fox sisters produced raps with their knee and other\njoints ;\nand the phenomena rarely occurred under conditions even\nintended to prevent fraud, while in experiments carried out appar-\nently in a scientific spirit, the records are hardly ever precise enough\nto show that fraud could not have been present.\nReference is made to the striking parallelism between the pro-\nceedings of modern seances and those connected with the later G-reek\noracles, as described by Myers in his Essays : Classical in 1883.\nThe article gives a very full bibliography of the whole subject, but\nthe S.P.R. is mentioned only once, in a footnote.\n\f14G] Work in Psychical Research 61\nPremonitions\nMrs Sidgwick\u2019s paper on \u201c Premonitions \u201d in vol. v (1888) was\nbased on cases received up to that date. Though mainly negative in\nits conclusions it was useful in showing what explanations had to be\nehminated before behef in a premonitory faculty could be accepted,\nthus paving the way for future work.\nSidgwick commented on it in his journal (June 1, 1888) :\n^\n\u201c S.P.R. meeting and Nora\u2019s paper on Premonitions. PajJer dilfi-\ncult to write because she does not beheve in them, and yet we fear\nthat too negative an attitude would prevent our getting the full\nsujjply of fresh stories which we want to complete our telepathic\nevidence, the simple minds of oim audience not distinguishing be-\ntween telepathy and premonitions. I thought she succeeded toler-\nably well, but Gurney thought she erred on the side of too great\nindulgence to weak evidence.\u201d\nHenry Sidywick\u2019s attitude as a Philosopher to Psychical\nResearch\nI insert here some jjassages illustrating Sidgwick\u2019s general attitude,\nas a philosopher, to the work :\n(Written in 1886) ;\n- \u201c I think [the S.P.R. ]\nhas done good work,\nas I do not doubt that thought-transference is genuine and hoj^e\nit will soon be established beyond cavil ;\nbut I see no prospect of\nmaking way in the far more interesting investigation of spiritual-\nism. I fear our experience shows that evidence available for\nscientific purposes is not hkely to be forthcoming ;\nstill, having\nput our hands to plough this bog, it would be feeble to look back\nso soon.\u201d\n(Written in 1887) ;\n^ \u201c I have been facing the fact that I am\ndrifting slowly to the conclusion . . . that we have not, and are\nnever lilrely to have, empirical evidence of the existence of the\nindividual after death. Soon therefore it will probably be my duty\nas a reasonable being\u2014and especially as a professional philoso-\npher\u2014to consider on what basis the human individual ought to\nconstruct his life under these circumstances. Some fifteen years\nago, when I was writing my book on Ethics, I was inclined to hold\nwith Kant that we must postulate the continued existence of the\n1 Memoir of Henry Sidgwick, p. 489.\n\u201c Memoir, p. 435.\n^ Op. cit., pp. 4GG-4()7.\n\f62 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry SidgwicUs [part\nsoul, in order to effect that harmony of Duty with Happiness\nwhich seemed to me indispensable to rational moral life. At any\nrate, I thought I might provisionally postulate it, while setting\nout on the serious search for empirical evidence. If I decide that\nthis search is a failure, shall I finally and decisively make this\npostulate ? Can 1 consistently with my whole view of truth and\nthe method of its attainment ? And, if I answer \u2018\nno \u2019\nto each of\nthese questions, have I any ethical system at all ? And if not,\ncan I continue to be Professor and absorb myself in the mere\nerudition of the subject ? . . . I have mixed up the personal and\ngeneral questions because every speculation of this kind ends, with\nme, in a practical problem :\n\u2018\nWhat is to be done here and now ?\n\u2019\nThat is a question which I must answer ;\nwhereas as to the riddle\nof the Universe\u2014I never had the presumption to hope that its\nsolution was reserved for me, though I had to try.\u201d\nA little later {op. cit., p. 468) he speaks of\n\u201c my final despair of obtaining\u2014I mean my obtaining, for I do\nnot yet despair as regards the human race\u2014any adequate rational\nground for beheving in the immortality of the soul.\u201d\nHe discusses the question more at length, and concludes {op. cit.,\np. 473)\n\u201c It is premature to despair, and I am quite content to go on\nseeking while life lasts ;\nthat is not the perplexing problem ;\nthe\ncjuestion is whether to profess Ethics without a basis.\u201d\nMrs Sidywick\u2019s Editorship\nNot long after these words were written, the sudden death of\nGurney, the colleague with whom the Sidgwicks had most in common,\nlaid fresh burdens on the survivors who had valued his work so\nhighly and wi,shed to make up as fiir as possible to the Society for\nhis loss.\nAmong otlier departments, tliis affected the editing. No regular\nEditor was appointed when the Society was founded, the necessary\nwork being done by the Literary Committee. The Journal (privately\nprinted for circulation among Meml)ers and Associates) was started\nat the beginning of 1884 and Barrett was elected its Editor. After\na year, he gave up the work and Sidgwick consented to take it. In\nthe following year (1886) Gurney took it over. When Gurney died\nin 1888, Sidgwick was made Editor of both Proceedings and Journal.\nThis meant that Mrs Sidgwick did practically all the work of editing,\n\u2014of course in consultation with him\u2014while articles in the Proceed-\nings w'ere, before publication, submitted to the Committee of Refer-\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 63\nence. From about 1890, when I became lier secretary, I acted as her\nassistant till July 1897, when Hodgson was made Editor. In June\n1899 he resigned and I was appointed in his place, with the great\nadvantage of having been trained by Mrs Sidgwick in the work.\nShe was scrupulous in her treatment of documents printed in the\nJournal, however unimportant, showing precisely how far they were\nprinted verbatim and where editorial modifications were introduced.\nConnecting sentences, if written on the MS., would be erased after-\nwards, and the papers put together and docketted. The collation\nof proofs with originals was gone through thoroughly at least once,\nand often twice ;\nand the proofs were generally read at least three\ntimes. She also had to select matter for printing in the Journal and\narrange what varieties of tyjje should be used, and made herself\nresponsible for the proof-reading of the Proceedings.\nThe Brighton Experiments\nMrs Sidgwick\u2019s next important piece of work was the series of\nexperiments in Thought-transference carried out during the four\nmonths July-October 1889 at Brighton with four different percipients\nin the hypnotic state, Mr G. A. Smith, the hypnotist, being the agent.\nG. A. Smith was a young man with a great natural skill in hyp-\nnotism, who used to give public entertainments at Brighton, of a\nkind common in those days, showing the effects of verbal suggestion.\nGurney having witnessed these secured his help for his own experi-\nments. He gradually became Gurney\u2019s assistant and secretary in\npsychical work and made himself very useful and efficient. He\nfound the subjects for experiment ;\nbut though the Sidgwicks\nbelieved him to be quite trustworthy, they exercised the same vigil-\nance that they would have done in any case, since it is of course\nunconscious indications, either given or received, that must es]3eci-\nally be guarded against in such experiments. The report of them\nwas published in Proceedings, vol. vi, pp. 128 ff. It describes in\ndetail the precautions taken to guard against many possible sources\nof error and shows that the success obtained was considerably\nbeyond chance.\nA second series of these experiments was carried out at Brighton\nfrom January 1890-July 1891, and the report published in Pro-\nceedings, vol. viii, pp. 536 if. They included the thought-transfer-\nence of numbers and of mental pictures and the production of local\nanaesthesia by mental suggestion, a kind of experiment that had\nbeen initiated by Gurney. As her assistant in this series, I was\nimpressed by her imwearying patience through a long sequence of\n\fG4 Alice Johnson : Airs Henry Sidgwick\u2019s [part\ntedious experiments ;\nshe never seemed to relax her efforts, and\nnever seemed bored. She treated all the persons concerned with the\nutmost consideration\u2014one might almost say respect\u2014as if they\nwere human beings, not mere sul)jects for experiment, and they all\nbecame much attached to her and liked to talk to her in the intervals\nabout their own affairs. I remarked how different was the atmos-\nphere on a few occasions when one or other of her helpers was in\ncharge. Though the subjects knew that careful precautions were\nbeing taken against fraud, I believe that none of them ever resented\nit.\nClairvoyance\nIn 1891 (vol. vii) appeared a paper on \u201c The Evidence for Clair-\nvoyance,\u201d defined as \u201c a faculty of acquiring supernormally, but\nnot by reading the minds of persons present, a knowledge of facts\nsuch as we normally acquire by the use of our senses.\u201d The term\nis not limited \u201c to a knowledge of present facts. A similar knowledge\nof past and, if necessary, future facts may be included.\u201d \u201c The\nsubject . . . divides itself into two main parts\u2014clairvoyant know-\nledge of facts which are known to some one somewhere . . . and\nclairvoyant knowledge of facts which are unknown to any one in\nthe world, such as a number drawn at random from a bag and not\nlooked at.\u201d\nThe paper deals only with cases of the first type, which it is of\ncourse difficult to distinguish from telepathy, and indeed it is sug-\ngested that clairvoyance may be facilitated if it is led up to by tele-\npathy, and that actually it may not be possible to draw the line\nbetween it and telepathy. Of the second type of cases, there was\nthen little or no good evidence (though successful dowsing might\nprobably be explained as due to clairvoyance, in so far as it cannot\nbe attributed to the influence of the dowser\u2019s subliminal perception\nof surface indications of underground water on the movements of\nthe rod).\nSpirit Photography\nA paper on \u201d Spirit Photography : a Reply to Mr A. R. Wallace\n\u201d\nappeared in vol. vii, pp. 268 ff. Much of the material used in it had\nbeen collected by Mrs tSidgwick in 1885-1886, for her article on\n\u201c Spirituahsm \u201d in the Encydo'peedia Britannica, though it had not\nbeen used in that article. She had not brought it before the Society\nearher, because her conclusions were chiefly negative. But in 1891\nWallace had pul)hshed a paper on \u201c Objective Apparitions,\u201d main-\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 65\ntaining tliat Spirit jihotographs afforded the most complete and\ncrucial test as to the subjectivity or objectivity of apparitions and\nthat the S.P.R. had completely ignored the evidence for it, which he\nthought superior to any that they had collected for any supernormal\nphenomena. In reply to this challenge, Mrs Sidgwick published her\nexamination of the evidence dealing with the most famous spirit\nphotographers of the period, most of them being professionals, who\nmade money out of it, such as Mumler in America, Hudson and\nParkes in London, and Buguet in Paris. Of these, Munder, Hudson\nand Buguet had been clearly convicted of fraud. Parkes produced\nphotographs of very suspicious appearance, but gave investigators\nlittle opportunity of examining the methods by which he produced\nthem, so that there was no evidence of their genuineness. She points\nout that the mere fact that trickery has not been discovered is not\nenough to establish genuineness ;\nalso that the evidence of recog-\nnition, on which spiritualists chiefly relied, is very dubious. She\nquotes from Stainton Moses, himself a convinced spiritualist {op.\ncit., p. 277) :\n\u201c Some people would recognise anything. A broom\nand a sheet are quite sufiicient to make up a grandmother for some\nwild enthusiasts. ... I have had pictures that might be anything\nin tliis or any other world sent to me and gravely claimed as recog-\nnised portraits ;\npalpable old women authenticated as \u2018\nmy spirit\nbrother dead seventeen years, as he would have been if he had,\u2019 etc.\u201d\n(From my own experience, I should say that this is no exaggeration.)\nVarious methods of fake photography are described, and tricks of\nsubstituting one plate for another.\nPrincipalship of Newnham College\nIn 1892, on the death of Miss Clough, the first Principal of Newn-\nham College, Mrs Sidgwick was urgently invited to succeed her. She\nhad been for many years on the Council and on a number of Com-\nmittees and was also Treasurer from 1876 to 1919. She remained\nfor the rest of her life a member of the Council, and never slackened\nin her devotion to the College. For two years, 1880-1882, she had\nbeen Vice-Principal, when she and her husband had lived in limited\nquarters in Newnham and now again they consented to give up their\nown home for the sake of the College, which owed its existence\nmainly to Henry Sidgwick.\nThe reasons which led to their consent are best given in his words\n{Memoir, p. 514) :\n\u201c We have been engaged in anxiously deliberating whether to\ndo what the Newnham College Council unanimously wish and\n\f66 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry Sirlgivich\u2019s [part\nagree that Nora shall take the office of Princi])al of Newnham\nCollege. The die is cast and she has written to accept. ... It\nwas dillicult to refuse ;\nand if I am\u2014as 1 still am\u2014doubtful\nwhether she has done right in accepting, it is almost solely on\naccount of the S.P.E. . . . We could not resist the unanimous\nwish of the Council, and of course it is a great pleasure to us (while\nat the same time it increases the sense of responsibility and diffi-\ncult duty of \u2018\ncoming up to the mark \u2019) to find that the staff and\nthe students are pleased. What we feel most strongly is that\nafter Miss Clough\u2019s death it is the duty of all who have given their\nminds to Newnham to \u2018\nclose ranks \u2019\nand take the ])lace that others,\nmoved by the same interest, assign to one. We hope it will be\nfor the good of the College.\u201d\n{op. cit., p. 522) :\n\u201c (May 2, 1892) On Saturday Nora was made Principal of\nNewnham, and to-day she is dining for the first time as Principal\nat the Hall called by her name. I am doubtful whether she did\nright in accejfilng, but only for a reason wliich does not occur to\nany of the friends and relations who write about it. I fear that\nshe may not find time for the work of the S.P.R., for which I think\nher uniquely fit\u2014much more fit than I am. If it turns out that\nshe must sacrifice some of this work, I shall have to take her place ;\nbut my intellect will be an inferior substitute for this work, and\nI shall give up with reluctance the plans of literary work for which\nI am better fitted. Still, if it must be so, I shall give them up\nwithout hesitation, ju.st as I should give them up to fight for my\ncountry if it was invaded.\u201d\nI may add that when at this juncture I expressed to Mrs Sidgwick,\nin sinte of my own affection for Newnham, my fear that the extra\nadministrative work involved must interfere with her work for the\nS.P.R., she listened attentively to all I had to say, and at last\nmerely replied, \u201c Well, if you ever find me getting slack about the\nS.P.R., you must pull me up.\u201d She was actually then in the middle\nof one of the heaviest tasks she had ever undertaken for the S.P.R.,\nviz. the Census of Hallucinations, which, begun in 1889, was pub-\nlished in 1894. Her remarkable powers of concentration helped her\nto carry on these two departments of work\u2014for the College and for\nthe S.P.R. concurrently. Very few ol those associated with her in\neither had any adeo[uate realisation\u2014many, I think, were entirely\nignorant ol her interest in the other. This was partly due to her\nconstant tendency to talk to people about their affairs, not her own ;\n\f67\n146] Worlc in Psychical Besearch\nand lier habit of ap])earing\u2019 at liberty to attend to airvthiny lirought\nbefore her.\nCensus of Ualhicinations\nThe object of the Census of Hallucinations was to discover the\nfrequency of hallucinations ex])erienced by sane and healthy per-\nsons in a waking state, and the j^roportion of them occairring at a\ntime when some marked event was happening to the person repre-\nsented, e.g. an apparition seen, or a voice heard, at the time of death,\nwith a view to finding whether such coincidences occurred more\noften than they might have done by chance. Thus it was attempted\nto apply to s])ontaneous telepathic cases the same principle as had\nbeen applied to experiments in telepathy.\nThe method employed was to ask as many people as possible\nwhether they had ever had a hallucination, getting details from those\nwho answered in the affirmative, and to tabulate the results. Gurney\nhad already attempted such an enquiry, but had only got answers\nfrom about 5,700 persons, which he thought too small a number for\nthe purpose.\nIn 1889 a committee was appointed by the Council of the S.P.R.\nto start a fresh enquiry on a larger scale. The undertaking was\napproved by the International Congress of Experimental Psychology\nheld in Paris, which entrusted the enquiry to Sidgwick\u2019s direction.\nThe interest taken in it by the Congress led the committee to enlarge\nits scope, so as to include not only the points of special interest to\nthe S.P.R. ,\nviz. the further testing of the hypothesis of telepathy,\nbut also points of interest to ])sychologists generally, who might be\nstudying the phenomena of hallucination. (The great value for\npsychological study of the material in the Report on the Census was\nemphasised in a paper by Mr Piddington, published about twelve\nyears later, in Proceedings, vol. xix, pp. 267 ff.)\nThe committee consisted of six persons, the Sidgwicks, F. W. H.\nand Dr A. T. Myers, Podmore and myself. The Report, which\noccupies almost the whole of Proceedings, vol. x, was written chiefly\nby Mrs Sidgwick, who also worked out the statistical calculations,\nwhile Sidgwick acted as Chairman of the Committee. There were\nfrequent meetings of the whole committee, and the other members\nworked at collecting information and enquiring into the cases\nreceived, both through correspondence and interviewing witnesses.\nAnswers were received from 17,000 persons, and many iirteresting\nand well-authenticated cases of coincidental hallucinations were\nreported.\nThe calculation as to whether these coincidences were due to\n\f08 Alice. Johnson : Mrs Henry Sidgiviclc's [part\nchance was based on the average annual death-rate for England and\nWales for the ten years 1881-1890, which was 19-15 per thousand.\nThis gives the probability that any one ])erson taken at random will\ndie on a given day\u2014for this purpose taken as the day on which his\napparition is seen and recognised\u2014as about 1 in 19,000. We should\nthen expect that out of 19,000 apparitions of living persons, one\nwould occur on the day of death of the person seen.\nNow, in order to make sure that we are not exaggerating the case\nagainst explanation by chance, it is necessary to weight it in favour\nof chance : viz. by making as much as possible of the total number\nof apjiaritions and as little as possible of the coincidental ones. In\nparticular, we have to allow for a large number of the apparitions\nseen having been forgotten and therefore not reported, and for the\ncoincidences having been exaggerated.\nIt was calculated, then, that the number of apparitions reported\nshould be multiplied by 4, :naking them 1,300, and that only the\nbest-authenticated cases of death coincidences should be reckoned,\nwhich reduced them to thirty. This gives thirty coincidences out\nof 1,300 cases, or about 1 in 43, as compared with the 1 in 19,000 that\nmight have been produced by chance, and 1 in 43 is equivalent to\nabout 440 in 19,000 or 440 times the most probable number.\nThis is, of course, a very brief summary of the argument, which is\ngiven at length with detailed reasoning as to all steps of it in the\nKeport, of which I quote the final jDaragraph (vol. x, p. 394) :\n\u201c Between deaths and apparitions of the dying person a connexion\nexists which is not diie to chance alone. This we hold as a proved\nfact. The discussion of its full imphcations cannot be attempted in\nthis paper ; \u2014nor, perhaps, exhausted in this age.\u201d\nEusaj)ia Paladino\nThe next important investigation\u2014that of the celebrated Nea-\n])olitan medium, Eusapia Paladino\u2014was less satisfactory in its\nu])shot. It was alleged {Proceedi)igs, vol. ix, p. 219) that Ensapia\nhad never been detected in fraud, and therefore ajjpeared a suitable\nsubject for investigation. Later it transpired that at least highly\nsuspicious circumstances had been noted by several observers.\nIn July 1894 sittings had been held in the south of France by\nBichet, who, with various other eminent scientists, both French and\nEnghsh, including Sir Ohver Lodge and Myers, had been convinced\nof Eusapia\u2019s powers. About a month later, the Sidgwicks attended\na further series of six sittings and were impressed, though not con-\nvinced, by what they saw. Mrs Sidgwick said {Journal, vol. vi,\n\f146] Work in Psychical Research 69\np. 339) :\n\u201c As far as they go, my experiences with Eusapia Paladino\nentirely confirm Professor Lodge, though they do not go so far\u2014for\nthe phenomena I witnessed were never, I think, such as could not\nhave been produced by normal means had her hands alone been\nfree. . . . The evidence, so far as my own experiences go, entirely\ndepends upon whether her hands were efficiently held.\u201d Sidgwick\nconcurred in this view.\nThe report (by Sir 0. Lodge and others) of these sittings was\nseverely criticised by Hodgson (Journal, vol. vii, pp. 36 ft.) on the\nground that the control, as described, was insufficient to guard against\nfraud. Though the sitters were no doubt familiar theoretically with\nmost of the tricks described by Hodgson, prol^ably no member of the\nSociety approached him in both theoretical and practical knowledge\nof conjuring and mediumistic frauds, nor do I think that aziy have\nrivalled him since. Every educated person assumes the fallibility\nof human observation and human memory ;\nbut it is not easy to\nmake full allowance for it till one has discovered by practical ex-\nperience how far one\u2019s own fallibility goes in both respects.\nHodgson\u2019s criticisms confirmed the Sidgwicks in their view that\nfurther experiments were necessary before coming to a conclusion.\nThey therefore arranged with Myers a series of sittings at Cambridge\nin August and Sejztember 1895. This series began with high hopes.\nEusapia stayed for seven weeks at Myers\u2019s house, being treated there\nwith the utmost kindness and hospitality, which she exploited to the\nfull. As few of their neighbours could speak Italian, the Sidgwicks\nwent constantly to the house to help in entertaining her.\nEfforts were made to induce her to submit to some form of\nmechanical control more satisfactory than the mere holding of her\nhands, but she refused all such suggestions. I well remember her\nrage when it was proposed that she should sit before the open\ndoorway of a room with a net curtain stretched over the doorway,\nand the objects to be moved put on a table on the other side of the\ncurtain. She would also be constantly calling for \u201c less light \u201d as\nthe sitting proceeded.\nAltogether twenty sittings were held. At the first few phenomena\noccurred which the sitters were unable to explain, but suspicious\ncircumstances began very early to appear, suggesting that Eusapia\nwas getting one hand free by a method that Richet had in fact\nalready guessed. Nevertheless the attempt was continued to get\ngenuine phenomena imder unimpeachable conditions rather than to\ndiscover fraud.\nAmong other sitters, the celebrated conjurer Maskelyne was in-\nvited, and though he was not, I think, convinced that anything\n\f70 Alice Johvson : Mrs Henry SidgtvicHs [part\nsujjernornial was occurring, lie was not alile to make any new\nsuggestion as to how the phenomena were jiroduced. Later Hodgson\ncame from America to assist, and liis experience proved conclusively\nwhat we had already suspected as to the method by which Eusapia\ngot one hand free by making the other do duty for two, so that the\nsitters on each side of her were both holding the same hand. She had\ngreat muscular strength, which enabled her to force the sitters\u2019\nhands into the position most suitable for the substitution. This\nmuscular strength often struck me, and I saw her more than once,\noutside the sittings, lift great weights with no apparent effort.\nIn the end Mr and Mrs Myers, the Sidgwicks, Hodgson and myself\nunanimously came to the conclusion that nothing but deliberate\ntrickery had been at work in the Cambridge series of sittings.\nM'hile Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge, unlike the Sidgwicks, retained\ntheir belief in the earlier series, it was agreed that the records of these\nshould not be treated as part of the evidence put forward by the\nSociety in favour of the genuineness of physical phenomena. The\nrecords were therefore ])rinted in the Journal only, and not published\nin the Proceedings.\nReplies to Criticisms\nNext year (1896) an attack was made on the validity of the\nBrighton experiments by two Danish ])sychologists, Lehmann and\nHansen, who, on the strength of some experiments of their own,\nmaintained that the successes at Brighton could be explained by\n\u201c involuntary whispering \u201d on the part of the agent, cond^ined with\nhyperaesthesia in the jjercipient.\nPlaying in turn the j^art of agent and pcrcijnent in 500 experiments\nin the transmission of num1)ers, they found that each was able to\nguess many of tlie numbers through hearing the other\u2019s (so-called)\n\u201c involuntary \u201d whis])ering. This might have been expected, but\nthe point was that when they guessed wrong, they found that the\nsame \u201c substitutions \u201d\n\u2014guesses of one number for another\u2014occurred\nas had occurred at Brighton.\nIn the first Brighton report {Proceedings, vol. vi, p. 164) the\npossibilities of unconscious whispering and hyperaesthesia had been\ndiscussed and the mistakes had been analysed from the point of\nview of finding whether they could be due to mishearing\u2014the mis-\ntaking of one number for another similar to it in sound, such as five\nfor nine. It had been found that mistakes of that kind were not\nmore jtrevalent than any other mistakes.\nLehmann and Hansen, however, in whose experiments the agent\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 71\nand percipient were mucli nearer to one another than was customary\nat Brighton, found that numbers could be transmitted by faint\nwhispering with closed lips, in such a way that a by-stander, in a\nshghtly less favourable position for hearing than the percipient,\nmight neither hear a sound nor see any sign of movement of the\nspeech-organs of the agent.\nIt was the custom at Brighton for one of the investigators to watch\nthe agent, and another the percipient, in order to guard against\nsignals being given or received\u2014either consciously or unconsciously.\nThe Sidgwicks now made a large number of experiments with G. A.\nSmith, Mrs Verrall and myself, to see what results could be got by\nthe methods of Lehmann and Hansen.\nIt was found that faint whispering\u2014more or less audible to the\npercipient\u2014could be produced with no visible movement of the lips,\nbut not without discernible movements of the neck and throat.\nNevertheless, the results confirmed what had always been assumed\n\u2014that if the case for telepathy rested solely on experiments with\nagent and percipient in the same room, it could not be considered\nconclusive.\nThe Danish psychologists, however, maintained that comparison\nof their wrong guesses with the Brighton ones provided strong posi-\ntive evidence that the same mode of transmission was operative in\nboth cases.\nNow, among the Brighton experiments there was a series with\nagent and percipient either in different buildings or separated from\none another by at least two closed doors and a passage. In this\nseries the successes were not beyond chance, so that they must be\nregarded as mere guesses. Yet the \u201c substitutions \u201d in this series\ncorresponded with those in the successful telepathic experiments, at\nleast as much as the latter corresponded with the Danish series.\nAnd since in the series of pure guesses there was no transmission at\nall, the cause of the correspondence in \u201c substitutions \u201d could not be,\nas had been maintained by the critics, that the same mode of trans-\nmission was operative in both cases.\nThe report of the Sidgwicks\u2019 joint examination of the subject was\nread by Sidgwick at the International Congress of Psychology at\nMunich in August 1896, and published for simphcity under his name\nalone in Proceedings, vol. xii. Actually the greater part of the paper,\nand in particular the calculations involved, were the work of Mrs\nSidgwick.\n\f72 Alice Johiison : Mrs Henry SidgioicHs [part\nCriiicism of ihe Census of Halluci)iations\nAnother notable exain])le of Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s method of dealing\nwith criticism is her defence of the Report on the Census of Halluci-\nnations against the strictures of a German ]3sychologist, Edmund\nParish, whose ])am]')hlet, Zur Kritik des TelepatJiisehen Beweis\nMateriels, was read before the Psychological Society of Munich in\n1897.\nParish argued that many reported cases probably did not occur\nat all, but were due to illusions of memory ;\nthat, if they did occur,\nthe recognition of the figure seen was ])robably imported into the\nnarrative afterwards by memory adaptation ;\nthat the reason why\nthe coincidences of apparition with death appear to be beyond\nchance is that the coincidence causes dreams to be remembered as\nwaking hallucinations ;\nfinally that the content of a hallucination\nmay be due solely to association of ideas, not to telepathy.\nMrs Sidgwick in her review of the book in Proceedings, vol. xiii,\npp. 589 ff. points out that all these possible defects of memory had\nbeen considered in the Rej^ort, and allowance made for them ;\nand\nthat the questions of recognition and of whether the percipient was\nawake or asleep had been carefully examined. She remarks that\nI\u2019arish does not seem to gras]:i the juirely subjective character of the\nhallucinatory process : that it is self-suggestion, rather than pseudo-\nmemory, that determines many of the details, making hallucinatory\nfigures or objects look as real ones would in similar circumstances.\nIt was constantly urged throughout the Report that the percipient\u2019s\nideas affected the form of the hallucination\u2014indeed in the very\ncases which Parish cites as proof of the influence of association of\nideas. Even when the fundamental idea\u2014the idea of the person\nseen\u2014was to be attributed to telepathy, such details as dress,\nattitude and ])osition in space, were, according to the Report,\ndetermined by self-suggestion or association of ideas.\nBut, whatever influence this may have on the form of the hallu-\ncination, it has no bearing on the question whether the coincidences\nare due to chance or not. For the known existence of one cause of\nan event cannot exclude the operation of another, unless the first\ncan be shown to be absolutely necessary and sufficient under all\nconditions.\nFurthermore, Parish maintains that, since there cannot be a causal\nconnexion between the death and the hallucination, we must turn\nthe statistical argument round. The Report found that thirty death\ncoincidences occurred among 17,000 informants, while 1 in 19,000\nliallucinations is the number that chance would produce. So the\n\f146]\nWorh in Psychical Research 73\nreal number of apparitions seen must have been 30 x 19,000, or\n570,000. It would follow from this, according to the figures given\nin the Report, that the informants must have forgotten or ignored\nmore than 98 per cent, of the hallucinations that had occurred to\nthem a fortnight or less before they were asked if they had ever\nexperienced one.\nMrs Sidgwick concludes : \u201cIf Herr Parish finds himself able to\nadopt so extravagant a conclusion, there is no more to be said.\u201d\nEarly Piper Sittings\nThe chief single subject investigated in the last few years of last\ncentury was the trance phenomena of Mrs Piper. She had first been\nintroduced to the S.P.R. by Wilham James, and had come to Eng-\nland in 1889-1890. She had visited Cambridge, and stayed for some\ntime in the houses of Mr and Mrs Myers and Mr and Mrs Sitlgwick ;\nand had also visited Sir Ohver Lodge at Liverpool and had sittings\nwith Walter Leaf and others in London. It was a moment of special\ninterest, as the first occasion on which a considerable number of\nsuccessful sittings had been held vuth a medium who appeared\nbeyond suspicion and who, as a matter of fact, has never been con-\nvicted of dehberate fraud.\nMany of the Piper Reports which appeared in vols. xiii and xiv of\nthe Proceedings were written in consultation with Mrs Sidgwick ;\nshe studied the details, both published and unpublished, with ex-\ntreme care, and herself attended a number of sittings.\nAn illunfinating \u201c Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs\nPiper \u201d was written by her in 1899, and pubhshed in Proceedings,\nvol. XV, pp. 16 ff. She accepted the conclusions arrived at by the\nmajority of sitters with Mrs Piper that the supernormal knowledge\ndisplayed m her trance was not acquired by fraudulent means, and\nthat it could not as a whole be drawn from the mind of the sitter.\nHodgson, who had been the principal investigator, was convinced\nthat communication from the dead through Mrs Piper was practically\nproved. Mrs Sidgwick thought this too tremendous a conclusion to\nbe based on the study\u2014however prolonged\u2014of a single medium.\nBut she considered the evidence for it sufficient to allow her to adopt\nit as a working hypothesis. And, granting commmfication from the\ndead, she proceeded to argue for Tele2)athy versus Possession\nwhich was Hodgson\u2019s theory\u2014as the mode of communication.\nIt has often been assumed that if telej^athy be true, it would be\nalmost impossible to get evidence for communication with the dead.\nOn the other hand, it is the discovery of telepathy that affords the\n\f74 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry SidgrviclJs [part\nstrongest presumption for the possibility. For if telepathy is a\nspiritual process\u2014a communication between mind and mind in\nwhich the physical world is not concerned\u2014it would tend to estab-\nlish the existence of mind apart from body, with the further prob-\nabilities that the mind may continue to exist after the death of the\nbody and continue to be able to communicate with minds in the\nbody ;\nand, indeed, that it is by telepathy that disembodied spirits\ncommunicate with one another. Mrs Sidgwick, then, uses the word\nTelepathy in the sense of any communication between mind and\nmind otherwise than through the recognised channels of sense,\nwhether the communicating minds be in the body or not. She main-\ntains that the intelligence actually communicating with the sitter\nby voice or writing is Mrs Piper herself in some condition of dis-\nsociation of consciousness, in communication of a supernormal, but\npartial and uncertain kind, with other minds\u2014of the living and of\nthe dead\u2014and conveying by voice and writing the information thus\nobtained, mixed up with much that has been acquired or imagined\nin a normal way.\nIt is noteworthy that the \u201c controls \u201d exhibit themselves very\nrealistically in bad as well as in good sittmgs, which would naturally\nbe the case if they were part of Mrs Piper herself. And this hypo-\nthesis would account for the frequent failures, absurdities and false\nstatements that are difficult to reconcile with the supposition that\nthe \u201c control \u201d is actually the deceased person that he purports\nto be.\nSome people, as is well known, are \u201c good \u201d sitters, in the sense\nthat they get good results from a medium, and others are \u201c bad\n\u201d\nsitters. Mrs Sidgwick remarks that this fact suggests that the sitter\nis an important factor in the case ;\nthat if Mrs Piper got all her in-\nformation telepathically from him, her failures might be due simply\nto his being a bad agent, as we find in thought-transference experi-\nments that many people seem to be bad agents. But a good sitter\nseems in some way to make the process of transmission easier, even\nwhen it is difficult to suppose that the information comes from his\nmind. Hodgson attributed the failure of sitters to such causes as\nwant of attention, or of desire to succeed ;\nand he thought that the\nattitude of mind of some persons might be actually repellent to the\nefforts of their deceased friends to communicate. On this Mrs Sidg-\nwick remarks : \u201cI speak as one who has uniformly failed, whether as\nagent or percipient in thought-transference experiments, or as sitter\nwith Mrs Piper and other mediums, and I am sure that the cause is\nnot want of sympathy or desire to succeed, or belief that success is\npossible. After years of failure the inevitable absence of hoije may\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 75\nhave a damping effect, but this will not account for failure when hope\nis fresh. I think it is certain that the sitter does not serve only as an\nattraction to his deceased friends, but that . . . there are subliminal\nqualities in the sitters which [affect the results]. Now this is not,\nI think, consistent with the hypothesis that the communicator . . .\nuses Mrs Piper\u2019s organism directly [i.e. the hypothesis of Possession]\nfor if so, why should it be more difficult for him to speak or write for\nA than for B ? We require a hypothesis which allows for all three\nminds\u2014the minds of the deceased friend, of Mrs Piper and of the\nsitter\u2014being subliminally concerned in the result.\u201d\nThere is positive evidence that Mrs Piper sometimes draws ideas\ntelepathically from the sitter\u2019s mind, e.g. when mistaken ideas of\nthe sitters are reproduced. There is also some evidence of telepathic\ncommunication between dead and living persons in a normal state\u2014\nthough at that date not nearly so strong as the evidence for tele-\npathy between living j^ersons. And it is probable that many tele-\npathic communications do not rise above the subliminal conscious-\nness of the percipient.\nIt is possible then that Mrs Piper may be in telepathic communi-\ncation vdth the sitter, and that the sitter may, without knowing it,\nbe in telepathic relation with his dead friend, and that his function\nis to be a channel of communication between his friend and Mrs\nPiper. The latter, on this hypothesis, plays the part of a bad mirror,\nreflecting very hnperfectly the contents of the sitter\u2019s subliminal con-\nsciousness, coloured and distorted by the contents of her own. Some-\ntimes there would be no evidence of any connnunication from the\ndead, only the sitter\u2019s own ideas being reflected. Also it would not\nbe impossible that Mrs Piper herself, as well as the sitter, should\nsometimes receive communications direct from the dead. Also her\ntrance personahty might, in the course of a number of sittings,\ngradually acquire, as part of its own stock of ideas, a definite con-\nception of the deceased person, and as this happened the interming-\nling of ideas from all three sources might become more and more\nindistinguishable.\nMemoir of Henry Sidgwick\nThe next year (1900) brought the great tragedy of Henry Sidg-\nwick\u2019s illness and death. Mrs Sidgwick, with the courage that never\nforsook her, carried on meanwhile to the utmost of her power all the\nresponsibihties that she had iniflertaken, till she was persuaded by\nher friends at the end of the year to go al )road for a few months\u2019 rest.\nOn her return, in addition to her work at Newiiham, she devoted\n\f7G Alice Johnaoii : Airs Henry Sidgwicli\u2019s [part\nherself to completing as far as possible her husband\u2019s literary-\nschemes. She brought out new editions of three of his philosophical\nworks, with four volumes of unpublished material left by him. Also,\nin conjunction with his brother, she wTote a Memoir of him and\nbrought out a volume of Aliscellaneous Essays. For the philosophical\nwork she had the help of specialists, but she read all the proofs\nherself, and this took up so much time that she was not able to write\nmuch for the S.P.R. till after the appearance of the Memoir early in\n1906. After her husband\u2019s death, she was for the first time elected a\nMember of the Council, and remained on it for the rest of her life.\nAiitomatic Scripts\nMrs Sidgwick took a keen interest in the new developments that\noccurred almost immediately after the death of Myers in 1901.\nHitherto prolonged systematic investigations had been carried on\nexclusively with professional or semi-professional mediums. But\nnow a band of automatic writers, of whom Mrs Verrall was the first,\nbegan themselves to ex])eriment. They were educated and intelli-\ngent women, sometimes as able as the investigators to criticise the\nresults obtained, and in any case willing and anxious to have their\nwork rigidly scrutinised and tested, and giving all the help they\ncould to this end.\nTo those who had been accustomed to deal with professional |\nmediums, who resented criticism and rec[uired to be humoured like I\nchildren, the complete change of atmosphere was an untold relief.\nOne could talk to these automatists with frankness, as man to man,\nand discuss freely without fear of giving offence any question that i\nturned up, for they were not concerned with their own fame, but i\nsimply with the pursuit of scientific truth. |\nAs time went on, \u201c Cross-correspondences \u201d between the scripts i\nof the various automatists began to appear. In a typical Cross-\ncorrespondence, there is no exact reproduction in the script of one\nautomatist of a phrase in the other, or even a different expression\nof the same idea, which inight be attributed to telepathy between\nthem. There is a fragmentary utterance in one, which seems to have\nno particular point or meaning, and another fragmentary and appar-\nently pointless utterance in the other. But when the two are put\ntogether, or when a link between them appears in the script of a\nthird automatist, it is seen that they supplement one another and\nform one coherent idea underlying all the scripts, though only\npartially expressed in each. This suggests that the idea originates\nin an intelligence external to the minds of the automatists, which\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 77\ninspires them to utter the fragments. Thus it seemed that the Cross-\ncorrespondences furnished the best evidence so far obtained for\ncommunication from the dead ;\nbut the supposed scheme was not\nobvious at first, and only through much accumulation of material\nand prolonged study did it appear. Nor is the evidence of a kind\nthat can be easily summarised, depending as it does on a multitude\nof details interlocking with one another. Naturally, any single\nCross-correspondence can be explained away as due merely to\nchance ;\nbut in course of time the evidence steadily increased and\nimproved, and the case for the theory rests on its cumulative force.\nIn this work, it was always Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s opinion of the value\nof the evidence that was most eagerly awaited by the investigators.\nAll felt that they had scored a point if they could satisfy her.\nMeanwhile work with Mrs Pijier was going on, and a number of\nimportant cases of nndtijfie personality were published, which\nafforded further material for the study of automatism.\nObituary of Hodgson\nAt the end of 19U5, the Society suffered another great loss in the\ndeath of Richard Hodgson. Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s obituary notice of him\nin Proceedings, vol. xix, p. 356, describes his immense zeal, energy\nand enthusiasm. Hodgson was emphatically a man who had les\ndefauts de ses qualites, and while this gave piquancy to his character,\nit hardly detracted, as she shows, from the value of his work. He\nhad devoted his life whole-heartedly to psychical research. His\npowers were often apphed to necessary but destructive work in\nexposing trickery. But his experimental investigation in conjunc-\ntion with S. J. Davey into the j^ossibilities of mal-observation and\nlapse of memory, mentioned above, has a constructive side, estab-\nlishing psychological data of great importance for the estimation of\nevidence, and is of lasting value. Through his study of Mrs Piper,\nwhich almost entirely absorbed the last eighteen years of his life, he\nadded largely to the positive evidence for supernormal phenomena.\nHe collected an immense quantity of material about it and pubhshed\nimportant reports, but unfortunately died, leaving a large mass\nunpublished.\nReply to Morselli on Eusapia\nIn vol. xxi (pp. 516 ff.) appears an instructive discussion of Prof.\nMorselh\u2019s Psicologia e Epiritismo : Impressioni e note critiche sui\nfenonieni medianici di Eusapia Paladino. Morselli was specially\n\f78 Alice Johyison : Mrs Henry SidgivicFs [part\ninterested in demonstrating that the spiritualistic hypothesis in this\ncase was absurd ;\nbut while admitting occasional trickery, he main-\ntained that some unknown supernormal force was present. Mrs\nSidgwick replied that it is difficult to see how any serious student\ncould suppose that the spiritualistic hypothesis would render the\nphenomena more intelligible ;\nbut that the more important point\nis to prove the absence of trickery, not the absence of spiritual\nagency. She thought that Morselli had not sufficiently attended to\nthis, or allowed enough margin beyond what is normally possible to\njustify the assumption of supernormality.\nIllustrating the case by her own experiences in the Cambridge\nsittings, she shows point by point the inadequacy of the precautions\ndescribed by Morselli to guard against fraud, explaining how this\nwas only gradually discovered at Cambridge. She remarks that\nMorselh seems to think that when fraud has not been discovered by\nsensible persons resjjonsible for watching the medium, the presump-\ntion is that it has not occurred : in fact, that the onus prohandi is\nwith those who doubt the genuineness of the phenomena. She says :\n\u201c I have not the same confidence that he has in my own or any one\nelse\u2019s powers of continuous observation, especially in darkness or\nsemi-darkness ;\nand when it has been shown that a medium sys-\ntematically practises trickery, the presumption, I think, is that on\nany particular occasion when an unexplained phenomenon takes\n])lace, an opportunity for trickery unobserved by the investigator\nhas been found.\u201d\nHon. Secretary and President\nIn 1907 Mrs Sidgwick undertook the office of Hon. Secretary of\nthe S.P.K. which she retained till 1932. During some of these years\nanother member of the Council shared the work, till Mr Salter, her\nlatest colleague, took sole charge of it.\nFor the two years 1908 and 1909 she was President. She could\nonly be persuaded to give one Presidential Address, w'hich is pub-\nlished in Proceedings, vol. xxii, for her forte lay rather in the detailed\nexamination and digestion of a mass of material than in a general\nsurvey of a wide miscellaneous held. Put whenever she attempted\nthe latter, she had a gift for picking out salient points and treating\nthem with independence, if not with originality.\nIn this Address she sketches briefly the. departments of work\nenvisaged in the original syllabus of the Society and the progress\nmade in each. Of one, clairvoyance, she says [cf. above, j). 64) that\nsuccessful dowsing seems to afford the only evidence so far obtained\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 79\nfor pure clairvoyance or telsestliesia as distiuguislied from telepathy,\nthe difference between the two faculties being of great theoretic\nimportance.\nShe goes on to discuss automatism, as the external expression of\nsubliminal mentation, and the great advances made in the under-\nstanding of it through the work of Myers and the hypnotic researches\nof Gurney, in addition to those of medical men at home and abroad,\nmany of whom were actively interested in the S.P.R. In regard to\ntelepathy, she urges the constant need for fresh evidence both to\nconfirm what we already have, and to help in discovering, if possible,\nthe laws that govern it.\nShe remarks that there is one department in which no real progress\nhas been made\u2014the physical phenomena of spiritualism, or tele-\nkinesis. This seems to stand where it did twenty-six years ago,\nwhen the Society was founded. The phenomena are still swamped\nin fraud, and still occur for the most part in the presence of profes-\nsional medimns who are sooner or later detected in trickery. On the\nother hand, impressive evidence is still occasionally forthcoming.\nThe work in this field, however, has not been entirely barren, for\nwe have a much more definite experimental knowledge of the possi-\nbilities of mal-observation than we had. And our greatly extended\nknowledge of motor automatism has shown that the possibihty of\ncomphcated subconscious muscular action has to be reckoned with\neven more than was thought.\nShe urges strongly that in order to further the investigation, fraud\nshould be more seriously discouraged. If telekinesis is genuine, we\nshould probably know more about it if it had not been mixed up\nwith fraud. The reason for fraud is that it pays so well, for the\nmedium generally runs no risk, even of loss of credit, through dis-\ncovery : he is as much in demand after exposure as before. If such\na person were at once dropped or ignored, the trade would cease to\nbe profitable, and the ground for investigation\u2014if there are genuine\nphenomena to be investigated\u2014^vmuld be considerably cleared. It\nis also to be noted that while, in other branches of the subject, the\nhope of the founders of the Society that private medimns would\ncome forward and give their help in investigation has been fulfilled\nand progress has been largely due to this fact,\u2014hi the case of tele-\nkinesis no disinterested persons have come forward apparently\npossessing this power, and taking enough scientific interest in it to\ncarry them through the tedium of careful experiment.\nMrs Sidgwick next mentions the importance of the study of\nhallucination in relation to its possible bearing on om evidence and\nquotes a case which had excited much interest among scientific men\n\f80 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry SidgwicHs [part\na few years earlier. A French physicist of repute, while investi-\ngating Rontgen rays, thought he had discovered a new kind, which\nhe named N-rays, whose presence was shown by an increase in\nluminosity of feeble sources of light. Physicists all over the world\ntried to repeat these experiments, but though a few could see the\neffects described, most could not. Finally an American physicist.\nProfessor Wood, visited the laboratory of one of the successful seers\nto test his results. It was said that a hand interposed in the path\nof the rays intercepted them, but Professor Wood found by a large\nnumber of experiments that the effects observed varied, not accord-\ning to what was really happening, but according to what the observer\nthought was happening. The difference in sensation was, in fact, a\nhallucination produced by expectation.\nMrs Sidgwick thought that the possibility of hallucinations,\ncaused by suggestion, at sittings for physical phenomena was greater\nthan is generally reahsed. We know that hallucinations can be\ninduced in many persons by crystal-gazing, or by hypnotic sugges-\ntion, and the N-ray experiments showed that riidimentary hallu-\ncinations could occur in a darkened room to persons in a normal state.\nShe passes on to the most encouraging branch of our investigations,\n\u2014Telepathy, and reiterates the necessity for getting constantly\nfresh and better evidence for it. She remarks that any evidence we\ncan obtain of survival after bodily death is likely to throw light on\nthe nature of telepathy and vice versa.\nLastly, she refers to the recent advance made through the scripts\nof Mrs Verrall, Mrs Holland and others ;\nsaying that at least we\nhave in them material for extending our knowledge of telepathy,\nwhile the form and matter of the cross-correspondences between the\nscripts of automatists at a distance from one another afford consider-\nable ground for su^jposing the intervention behind the automatists\nof another mind indejDendent of them. If this be the mind of a\nj)erson who has survived death, it would mean that intelligent co-\noperation between disembodied minds and our own, in experiments\nof a new kind intended to prove continued existence, has become\npossible,\u2014a new and very important stage of the Society\u2019s work.\nFurther Piper Sittings\nMrs Sidgwick had meanwhile been taking part in this new work\nas a member of the committee for ex^ieriments with ]\\'L\u2019s Riper, who\nhad been lu'ought to England after Hodgson\u2019s death, and gave\nseventy-folu- sittings, at nmeteen of which Mrs Sidgwick was in\ncharge, from November 1906 to June 1907.\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 81\nThe committee decided that their main ol)jects should be, [a] to\nencourage the develojiment of certain \u201c controls \u201d who had already\nbeen manifesting in her trance, purporting to be Sidgwick, Myers\nand Hodgson, and (6) to try to bring about cross-correspondences\nwith the other automatists. The controls continiied, but only\nMyers showed a marked advance in dramatisation and in the\nvraisemblance of the personation. A number of striking cross-\ncorrespondences occurred between the scripts of Mrs Piper and those\nof Mrs and Miss Verrall and Mrs Holland. A full report, drawn up\nby Mr Piddington, occujiies almost the whole of Proceedings, vol.\nxxii, with a short sejmrate article by Mrs Sidgwick at the end.\nIn the next two volumes occur further studies of the Hodgson\ncontrol in the English Pi2\noer sittings, and of the cross-corresjDondence\nexperiments carried on in the Sf)ring of 1908 between Mrs Piper in\nAmerica, under the charge of G. P. Dorr, and the automatists in\nEngland. The rejDorts of these, by Mrs Sidgwick, Mr Piddington\nand Mrs Verrall, include a number of successful and instructive\ncases, which must be read in detail to be a2\n)i)reciated.\nObituary of Podniore\nIn her obituary notice of Frank Podmore in vol. xxv, Mrs Sidgwick\nemj^hasises the great value to the Society of the critical work with\nwhich his name had chiefly come to be associated, although he had\ncontributed much to the collection of evidence for telejmthy. She\nobserves :\n\u201c Ignorant criticism we can get plenty of, but when not\nharmful it is usually quite useless. What it is not easy to find is a\nman with imflagging energy in keejjing his knowledge up to date,\nunflagging belief in the iin|3ortance of the investigation, who yet\ncan jDut himself outside it and view it from an im2\n:)artial, imj^ersonal\nand mainly critical standpoint. . . . The Society will be fortunate\nindeed if it finds another critic equally friendly, learned, j)ainstaking\nand accurate, to take Mr Podmore\u2019s jilace, and 2\n^ut the brake on\nwhen there are signs of running too fast.\u201d\nReply to Dr Tanner s \u201c Studies in Spiritism \u201d\nIn striking contrast to Podmore\u2019s methods was a book by two\nAmerican psychologists. Studies in Sjyiritism, by Dr Amy Tanner,\nwith an Introduction by Professor Stanley Hall, reviewed by Mrs\nSidgwick in vol. xxv, })p. 102 ft. On the strength of six sittings with\nMrs Piper, carried out in a different spirit from that of the S.P.R.,\nthe writers attempted to discredit all the results obtained by the\n\f82 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry Sidgioick\u2019s [part\nlatter. They tried dehberately to mislead the controls, so as to\nconfuse their statements\u2014telling them, in fact, what the Hodgson\ncontrol justly described as \u201c awful whoppers.\u201d They also subjected\nMrs Piper, without her consent, to a number of disagreeable and\npainfid experiments to test the degree of anaesthesia in trance, the\neffects of which lasted after waking and were greatly resented by her.\nMrs Sidgwick was not often moved to anger, but this behaviour,\nso completely at variance with her own straightforward and con-\nsiderate treatment of mediums, excited her indignation. She\nlimited herself, nevertheless, in her review to a disjjassionate dis-\nsection of the misrepresentations and inaccuracies of the account\nof the Enghsh sittings given in the book ;\nfinally observing that it\nmay impress persons who derive their knowledge of the evidence\ndiscussed from it alone, but that a very different view would be\nformed by any one who would check Dr Tanner\u2019s version by reference\nto the original sources.\nReply to Dr Maxwell on Cross-Correspondences\nThe next article to be mentioned deals with a critic of another\nstani]). Dr Joseph Maxwell (author of Les Phenomenes Psycliiques),\nwhose j^aper on \u201c Les Correspondances Croisees et la Methode Ex-\nperimentale \u201d had been pubhshed in Proceedings, vol. xxvi, pp. 57 ff.\nMrs Sidgwick rejJies to it in tlie same vok, ]>p. 375 ff. That Dr\nMaxwell had studied the reports with care is shown by his animad-\nversions on a number of detailed cases which he quotes, and such\ndiscussions must always be instructive. Mrs Sidgwick admits the\njustice of some of his criticisms, e.g. that it would be easier to judge\nof scripts if they were printed entire, instead of only partially. But\nshe takes exception to some of his views on methods. He thinks that\ntoo much dependence is jjlaced on the automatists\u2019 good faith and\nthat automatists should not be co-investigators. He imagines that\nboth investigators and automatists start with the desire to prove\nsome jjarticular thesis, and frequently misunderstands what the\nreports are actually trying to prove. Thus, when they try to find\nthe source of some literary allusion or quotation, he imagines that\nthey give it as evidence of the automatists\u2019 supernormal knowledge,\nwhereas it is of course generally evidence of their normal knowledge\nand the chief object of finding the literary source is to see whether\nit strengthens or weakens the cross-correspondence.\nTo the ordinary educated Englishman, his propensity to find in\nthe spirituahst paper Light the sources of such phrases as \u201c Crossing\nthe Bar,\u201d \u201c seven times seven \u201d or \u201c Pharaoh\u2019s daughter \u201d must\n\f146]\nWorlc in Psychical Research 83\napjjear simply grotesque. But, whatever their source, a careful\nreader can hardly overlook the extent to which both cryptomnesia,\non which Dr Maxwell lays such stress, and a margin for subliminal\naction of all kinds on the part of the automatists has been allowed\nfor by the investigators.\nAs a general disquisition on cross-corresjrondences and what they\npoint to, this paper of Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s is particularly valuable. She\nremarks :\n\u201c Regarded merely as proof of telepathy, their importance\ncan hardly be over-rated, and much more may ultimately be proved\nby them. ... I myself think the evidence is pointing towards the\nconclusion that our former fellow-workers are still working with us.\u201d\nPsychology of the Piper Trance\nMrs Sidgvdck\u2019s \u201c Contribution to the Study of the Psychology of\nMrs Piper\u2019s Trance Phenomena,\u201d which occupies the whole (67G pjr.)\nof vol. xxviii (1915) ^ is one of the most important studies of the\nrelation of psychology to psychical research since the publication of\nMyers\u2019s Human Personality. It excludes the evidence for Mrs\nPiper\u2019s supernormal powers, of which so much had already been\npubhshed ;\nbut simply attempts to throw light on the trance con-\nsciousness, and the question whether the intelligence that speaks or\nwrites in the trance, and sometimes exhibits supernormal powers, is\nother than a phase, or centre of consciousness, of Mrs Piper herself.\nThe question had already been discussed by Mrs Sidgwick in the\npaper in vol. xv, referred to above. Here it is examined afresh in a\nbroad survey of the whole ground, with a wealth of illustrative\ndetail.\nHodgson had, in a number of sittings, tried to get from the com-\nmunicators their own theory of the phenomena, and their descrip-\ntion of the conditions under which they were working and of the\nlife they hve. He had intended to write an account of this, but\nunfortunately died without even leaving any notes to indicate what\nhis treatment would have been. There is no doubt, however, that\nhe tended to take the statements of the communicators far more at\ntheir face value than did Mrs Sidgwick.\nIf we are ever to approach an understanding of communication\nbetween the living and the dead, it must obviously be through a\nmedium who provides good and abundant evidence at least of\ntelepathic power. Mrs Piper was chosen because we have fuller\nrecords of her phenomena than of any other medium, and it is more\n^ Tlie synopsis of contents at the beginning of the volnine will be found a\ngreat help to readers.\n\f84 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry Sidgwick's [part\nenlightening to compare statements made at different times by the\nsame medium than to range over the whole field, jiicking out points\nfrom a number of different automatists.\nMrs Sidgwick begins her discussion with a useful definition of the\ntwo words \u201c Control \u201d and \u201c Communicator \u201d which had hitherto\nbeen treated as synonymous. She defines \u201c Control \u201d (a word of\ncourse common in spirituahstic parlance) as the intelligence which\nis or professes to be in direct communication with the sitter by voice\nor writing ;\nand \u201c Communicator \u201d as the intelhgence for which the\ncontrol professes to act as amanuensis or interpreter, or whose re-\nmarks the control repeats to the sitter. The roles of control and\ncommunicator may lie interchangeable ;\nbut the main idea under-\nlying the conception is that Mrs Piper's spirit is supposed to be\ntemporarily absent, and her body meanwhile occupied by the control.\nIt is asserted that successful working with the medium\u2019s organism\nneeds special skill and practice ;\nhence the necessity for a control\nintervening between communicator and sitter.\nThe controls tend to be more or less eminent historical characters,\nsuch as J. S. Bach, Mrs Siddons, Sir Walter Scott and Moses (known\nas \u201c Moses of old \u201d to distinguish him from Stainton Moses). They\nfail, however, to produce evidence of their identity. The most\nimportant group are the \u201c spirit guides \u201d of Stainton Moses. They\nuse the pseudonyms\u2014Imperator, Rector, etc.\u2014wliicli he gave them\nto conceal their exalted or semi-sacred character, but they never\nsucceeded in revealing their real names. Nevertheless, in some way\nfor which it is difficult to account, they seem to help the phenomena\nto emerge, and it was often found convenient to allow them osten-\nsibly to take charge of the proceedings. Of course, this may have\nbeen simjdy due to Mrs Piper\u2019s belief in their existence.\nThere are also controls who control for their own dead friends,\nsuch as \u201c G. P.\u201d (George Pelham) or Hodgson, and these persistently\nmaintain the reality of the others. It was \u201c G. P.\u2019s \u201d statement that\nconvinced Hodgson of this in his life-time, and the Hodgson control\ncarried on tlie behef. Mrs Sidgwick observes that if the consistency\neither of \u201c G. P.\u2019s \u201d ])ersonation, or of the personation of the spirits\nhe guarantees, breaks down, we are left practically without support\nfor the hypothesis that the controls are independent spirits. But\nthis would not tend to show that there was no real \u201c G. P.\u201d in the\nl)ackground, helping to inspire the personation of him.\nMuch space is devoted to showing the resemblances between Mrs\nPiper\u2019s trance and the hypnotic state as regards changes and\ndissociations of consciousness. But what psychical processes are\ninvolved in these changes we do not Icnow. We may represent it as\n\f146] Work in Psychical Research 85\nsome sort of shuffling or re-arrangement of centres of consciousness,\ninterconnected but to some extent independent, with one of them\ndominant enough to keep order, as it were, and secure the kind of\nstabihty that is exhibited in the trance.\nMrs Piper\u2019s trance seems to be a sort of self-induced hypnosis, in\nwhich her hypnotic self personates different characters, either con-\nsciously or unconsciously, beheving herself to be the person she\nrepresents, and sometimes probably in a state of consciousness\nbetween the two. In the trance state, as often in hypnosis, her\nnormal powers are superior in some respects to those of her ordinary\nwaking state. And further she can obtain, imperfectly and frag-\nmentarily, telepathic impressions. Or it may be more correct to say\nthat such impressions are not only received by her telepathically,\nbut rise partially or completely into the consciousness of the trance\nstate and so are recognised.\nIn so elusive a subject, it would be rash to try to come to a con-\nclusion on this case alone. Much more study is wanted of hypnotic\nand other dissociated states, and of cases of automatic writins,\nespecially of course where there is evidence of supernormal powers\nlike Mrs Piper\u2019s.\nI may add that Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s hope of a similar psychological\nstudy of the non-evidential matter in the trance utterances of an\nautomatist through whom excellent evidence has been forthcoming\nwas fulfilled some years later in Lord Balfour\u2019s \u201c Study of the\nPsychological Aspects of Mrs Willett\u2019s Mediumship,\u201d in vol. xhii.\nThis was the result of many years\u2019 observation of the case, with\nwhich Mrs Sidgwick also was well acquainted, as Lord Balfour was\nwith the case of Mrs Piper ;\nso that the two reports are in a sense\nsupplementary to one another and form together a most interesting\ndisquisition on what Lord Balfour calls \u201c jDrocess,\u201d\u2014the constitution\nof the Ego and the relationship to one another of different centres\nof consciousness in the same individual. The two reports together\nare all the more instructive because of the contrast between the two\nmedimns,\u2014Mrs AVillett being a highly intelligent and well-read\nwoman, with a wide experience of life, probably incapable of\nharbouring in any stratum of consciousness the kind of illiterate\nnonsense that was not infrequent in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance.\nA similar but less comprehensive stndy of the trance phenomena\nof Mrs Osborne Leonard was made by Mr Drayton Thomas in Pro-\nceedings, vol. xxxviii.\n\f86 Alice Johnson : Airs Henry Sidgivick\u2019s [part\nAbridged Edition of \u201c Phantasms \u201d\nIn 1918 Mrs Sidgwick brought out a revised and abridged edition\nof Phantasms of the Living, which had long been out of print. The\ntwo bulky volumes were now reduced to one. The abridged version\nomitted the important \u201c Note on Witchcraft \u201d by Gurney, mentioned\nabove, a long \u201c Note on a Suggested Mode of Psychical Interaction\n\u201d\nby Myers, the substance of which was later embodied in Human\nPersonality, and the Supplement, containing the less well-evidenced\ncases. Otherwise the book was substantially as the authors had left\nit, no new cases or new discussions being added.\nThe original book must always rank as a classic of psychical\nresearch, but the general reader may find it convenient to have an\nabridgment of it, selected by so expert a researcher.\n\u201c Book-Tests \u201d\nAn important new line of research, the so-called \u201c Book-Tests,\u201d\nwas the next subject taken up by Mrs Sidgwick. These were ob-\ntained through the mediumship of Mrs Osborne Leonard, which was\nfirst brought to the notice of the Society by Miss Radclyffe-Hall and\nLady Troubridge in 1918, and which stimulated the interest of many\nmembers who had not hitherto taken an active part in the work.\nA full report of their sittings by Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady\nTroubridge was published in 1919 [Proceedings, vol. xxx, pp. 339 ff.).\nLater Mrs Leonard\u2019s control \u201c Feda \u201d gave to these ladies and other\nS.P.R. sitters correct statements relating to passages in books\nunseen by the medium ;\nand \u201c An Examination of Book-Tests\nobtained in sittings with Mrs Leonard \u201d by Mrs Sidgwick was\npublished in 1921 in vol. xxxi, pp. 242 ff.\nTwo typical instances may be cited in brief\n[a) The sitter, Mrs Salter, was alone with the medium, and her\nfather. Dr. Verrall, purported to communicate. \u201c Feda \u201d indicated\na certain row of books in Miss Radclyffe-Hall\u2019s flat, where Mrs\nLeonard had never been, and said that in the second book from the\nleft, on the first i^age, there was a kind of play on Miss Radclyffe-\nHall\u2019s surname ;\nthat the first j)age was not a full page, but only\npart.\nThere was nothing relevant in the second book on the shelf ;\nbut\nif \u201c second book \u201d is taken to mean second from the one previously\nmentioned by \u201c Feda \u201d\u2014which there is some reason to beheve was\nthe communicator\u2019s method of counting\u2014this was found to be II\nSuloito della Contessa Alaffei. Only half the first page is covered with\n\f146] Work in Psychical Research 87\nprint and the word Salotto occurs in it six times. The Italian\ndictionary consulted gives it under Sola, thus :\n\u201c Sola, dim ; salotto,\netc., a hall or saloon.\u201d Mrs Salter had never been in the flat and\nknew nothing about the books there.\n(6) Sitters, Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. \u201c Feda\n\u201d\nindicated a certain shelf and the fifth book from the left, and said\nthat on p. 14 something gave her a feeling of heat about halfway\ndown the page ;\nit might be heat like a hot fire, or it might be great\nanger spoken of as heat. The book indicated had not been read or\nopened by the sitters. Its pages have thirty-three fines. On 1. 16 of\np. 14 occur the words \u201c ardent patriot,\u201d expressing heat in the\nmetaphorical sense ;\non 1. 15 of p. 15 occurs the word \u201c bonfire,\u201d\ngiving heat in the literal sense. Pp. 14 and 15 face each other, and\nwhen the book is closed, the words \u201c ardent \u201d and \u201c bonfire\n\u201d\nalmost touch.\nIt is clear that correct statements of this kind cannot be explained\nby telepathy from the sitter, since the facts are not within his know-\nledge. It looks more like pure clairvoyance\u2014knowledge of physical\nappearances outside the range of any one\u2019s senses\u2014but if so, is it\n\u201c Feda \u2019\u2019who has this power, or some disembodied spirit who com-\nmimicates it to her ?\nIMrs Sidgwick analysed about 532 cases, obtained from thirty-four\nsitters, and concluded that 92 could be classified as successes, and\n100 approximately so, in all about 36 per cent. But she remarks\nthat any classification is difficult and uncertain, and that the degree\nof success beyond chance must vary enormously in different cases,\nso that any calculation of probabilities\u2014such as can be applied to\nsimple experiments in telepathy\u2014is out of the question.\nSometimes details about the surroundings of the book were given,\nwhich might be explained by telepathy from the sitter ;\nbut cases\nwhere the sitter knew\" nothing of the surroundings were sometimes\nequally successful. Another question might be whether the know-\nledge was possessed by any living person who might be siq^posed in\ntouch with the sitter or wuth the medium. Again, was the knowledge\nshown within the possession of the communicator before his death ?\nIf so, it would be evidence of his surviving memory.\nIt is only after exhausting these possibilities that we are driven to\nassume pure clairvoyance. \u201c Feda \u201d ascribes it to clairvoyance\nexercised by the communicator. There may be three sources of\nFeda\u2019s \u201d supernormal knowledge\u2014the sitter, other living persons\nand the memory of the communicator\u2014all working together, or any\ntwo of them may work and fortify one another.\nSome of the most interesting cases are cited in full and carefully\n\f88 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry Sidgwich\u2019s [part\nanalysed. Clairvoyance is a matter which is at present disconnected\nwith all our established knowledge, and is therefore hard to beheve.\nAnd it is very hard to estimate whether the successes of the Book-\nTests are more than we can suppose chance to have produced. On\nthe whole, however, Mrs Sidgwick thought that they afforded a\nprima facie case for clairvoyance. They also suggest a close con-\nnexion between telepathy and clairvoyance,\u2014not a new theory, but\none which might lend itself to practical experimentation. E.g. if\ntelepathy operates in the finding of the book and the perception of\nits surroundings, it might facilitate the clairvoyant perception of the\ninside of the book which sometimes follows.\nThe paper includes a \u201c Note on Chance in Book-Tests,\u201d giving the\nresults of an experiment by Mrs Sidgwick to see whether, in specified\nplaces in twelve books taken at random, a passage would occur\ncorresponding to a \u201c Test \u201d given by \u201c Feda \u201d. Only one of the\ntwelve was found to have any relevance to it. These experiments,\nthough too few to be conclusive, tend to show that chance is not an\neasy explanation of \u201c Feda\u2019s \u201d successes.\nImitation Book-Tests\nIn a later volume (xxxiii, jjp. 606 ff.) Mrs Sidgwick reports on a\nseries of experiments, in which sixty members of the Society took\npart, to test chance in book-tests. They were asked to choose ten\nbooks at random, and after doing so, were given three \u201c tests \u201d and\nasked to search for each of the three in a specified part of each book.\nE.g. is there a passage which is particularly relevant to your father\nin the top quarter of p. 60 in each book ? In all, therefore, 1,800\npassages were examined, 600 for each \u201c test.\u201d\nThe experimenters recorded the results in detail, stating whether or\nnot they considered the \u201c tests \u201d successful, i.e. whether the passages\nwere relevant or not. But naturally different people had different\nstandards of what shoidd count as a success. So another member of\nthe Society, Colonel C. E. Baddeley, undertook to analyse all the\nresults and draw up percentages of success or failure. In order to\ncompare these chance results with the successful Book-Tests ob-\ntained through Mrs Leonard, as calculated by Mrs Sidgwick, it was\nnecessary to know how her standard of \u201c success \u201d compared with\nColonel Baddeley\u2019s. So she also studied all the \u201c sham \u201d ones in the\nsame way. She agreed with him on the whole, but thought he\ntended to allow things to count too much as success. This, however,\nwoidd be a fault on the right side in an experiment of this kmd,\nsince, in relation to real Book Tests, it would allow chance to\naccount for more than it proI)ably did.\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 89\nAs mentioned above, Mrs Sidgwick calculated that about 36 per\ncent, of the Leonard Book-Tests were successful. By as nearly\nas possible the same standard the success of the sham tests was\n4-7 per cent. Thus, as far as can be estimated from these experi-\nments, the Leonard results are considerably above what chance\nwould be likely to produce.\nNew Collection of Phantasms of the Living\nIn 1922 Mrs Sidgwick made a collection of cases of telepathy\nwhich had been printed in the Journal only and were therefore not\navailable for the general reader. It is contained in a paper of about\n400 pp. in vol. xxxiii, entitled \u201c Phantasms of the Living : An\nExamination and Analysis of Cases of Telepathy between Living\nPersons printed in the Journal of the Society since the publication\nof the book Phantasms of the Living in 1886.\u201d\nThe period covered is from June 1886 to the end of 1920, and the\ncollection is made from seventeen volumes of the Journal, omitting\nall cases in which the interval between the experience and its record\nexceeds five years, and those in which the evidence seemed too weak\nto be worth publishing. A Table of Contents at the end explains\nthe classification adopted and makes it easy to look up any type of\ncase wanted.\nIt forms a complete treatise on Telepathy, being a continuation to\ndate of the original Phantasms of the Living in the light of the\nresearch that had been going on since the publication of that book.\nIt appeals once more for the continued collection of new first-hand\nmaterial, of which there can never be too much, if it is well-evidenced.\nHindrances to Telepathy\nA paper by Mrs Sidgwick on \u201c Hindrances and Complications in\nTelepathic Communication \u201d was published in 1923 (vol. xxxiv, pp.\n28 ff.). She points out that the confusion so often apparent in\n\u201c messages \u201d from the dead is not by itself a reason for doubting their\nvalidity, since communication from the dead is presumably of the\nsame nature as telepathic communication between the living, which\nfrequently exhibits similar confusion. Cases of telepathy between\nthe hving are here examined from the point of view of imperfection\nof transmission, in order to discover, if jjossible, what causes the\nimperfection.\nWe have no evidence of obstruction outside the two communi-\ncating minds, such as we should have if the transmission were\n\f90 Alice Joli7ison : Mrs He^iry Sidgioick\u2019s [part\nphysical, like the passage of light. The difficulties, then, must be\nsought for in the mental processes of the two individuals.\nOne important difficulty seems to lie in the passage of the idea\nfrom one stratum of the mind to another. We get glimpses of double\nmentation at work in dreams, in automatic writing, in sensory\nhallucinations, such as crystal visions, in hypnotism, etc. In\nemerging from a subliminal stratum, an idea or intention may be\ncurtailed or distorted. This can be seen clearly in cases where there\nis no question of telepathy ;\ne.g. when a hypnotised subject is given\na verbal order to do or experience something on waking, such as to\nsee a specified vision in a crystal. Sometimes the vision may be seen\nbut not recognised. For in.stance, Myers told a hypnotised subject\n(P.) the story of Robinson Crusoe finding the footprint and fearing\nsavages, and said he would see it in a glass of water. Awakened and\nset before the glass, P. at once exclaimed, \u201c Why, there\u2019s Buffalo\nBill ! He\u2019s dressed in feathers and skins round him ;\nalmost like a\nsavage. He\u2019s walking about in a waste place. I can see something\nelse coming from another part\u2014it\u2019s a blackie. Look at them now,\nhow they\u2019re arguing ! Buffalo Bill and his black man.\u201d\nP. failed to see the foot-mark, on which Myers had chiefly dwelt.\nHe had read Robinson Crusoe, but was more familiar with Buffalo\nBill, who was at the time touring the country with his show of the\nWild West of America.\nHere the vision seemed clear as far as it went, with the important\nomission of the foot-mark, but the message which reached the supra-\nliminal was misinterpreted by it. It would appear that an idea\nsuccessfully impressed upon one stratum of consciousness is liable\nto get distorted before it emerges in another. Possibly all telepathic\ncommunications first reach the subhminal and have to run the gaunt-\nlet of j^assage from one stratum to another before they can emerge.\nEven with normal transmissions there may be a want of under-\nstanding between two parts of our mind, as in misspellings of\nfamiliar words and inabihty to remember familiar names.\nIn telepathy between the living, we have of course the advantage\nof being able to get information about the working of both minds,\nwhile in the case of \u201c messages \u201d from the dead, we have no means\nof knowing what passes on the supposed agent\u2019s side, but can only\nsurmise from the contents of the message as received. Even in\nmessages from the living we can rarely discover anything of the\nmental working of the agent, except in experimental cases ;\nand of\nthese the most instructive for the present purpose will be the\npartially successful ones ;\nfor if the idea gets through promptly and\ncompletely, no light will have been thrown on the obstacles that may\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 91\nhave been overcome. On the other hand total failures cannot reveal\nwhat the obstacle is.\nVoluntary effort on the part of the agent to transmit some par-\nticular idea is not always necessary : the percipient may have im-\npressions corresponding unmistakably to his thoughts, and here the\nactivity seems on the percipient\u2019s side. In Mr and Mrs Newnham\u2019s\nexperiments, he asked mental questions and her automatic writing\nmade appropriate responses, indicating that she had apprehended\nthe question subhniinally. But if the question related to something\nthat only he knew, her answer was only slight and fragmentary ;\nthough generally appropriate, it was not correct, but pure invention.\nThis suggested that the subliminal was unwilhng to confess its\nignorance and tried to invent something plausible, as mediums often\ndo. That this attempt at deception was not the work of some\noutside spirit seems clear from the facts that the writing intelligence\nalways asserted that it was Mrs Newnham herself, and that no true\ninformation rmknown to both of them was ever given.\nSometimes when a picture is to be mentally transferred, the per-\ncipient may see some items and misinterpret them. Thus, in the\nBrighton experiments, a sailing boat on the sea appeared as cliffs\nseen above the boat, then joining the boat, and at last identified as\nits sails. Again, a snake with its tongue out was seen as something\nhke a snake and a snake charmer playing with it,\u2014an added detail\nclearly due to association of ideas in the percipient. Since associa-\ntion of ideas plays a large part in normal perception and in the\ninterpretation of perceptions, we might expect the same to occur in\nsupernormal perception.\nIn fact we often find that telepathic messages, when received, are\nincomplete ;\nthey may be received piecemeal and the percipient may\nfail to grasp the total idea It is to be supposed that the same kind\nof failure may occur with messages from the dead.\nAnalysis of Professor Murray's Experiments\nMrs Sidgwick\u2019s examination of telepathy was continued in 1924\nin a \u201c Report on further Experiments in Thought Transference\ncarried out by Professor Gilbert Murray \u201d in Proceedings, vol. xxxiv,\npp. 212 ff. She remarks that these are perhaps the most important\nexperiments ever brought to the notice of the Society, both on\naccount of their frequently brilliant success and on account of the\neminence of the experimenter.\nThey were carried out with Professor Murray\u2019s own family, some-\ntimes joined by friends ;\nProfessor Mirrrav himself was generally\n\f92 Alice Johnson : Mrs Henry Sidgwick\u2019s [part\nthe percipient, and one of his daughters the agent. Though he spoke\nof his attempts to reproduce the agent\u2019s ideas as guesses, no mere\nguessing could have produced the amount of success obtained.\nTelepathy or some other agency must have been at work. Professor\nMurray distingmshes between three things\u2014the impressions that\nseem to come to him from without, his inferences from these im-\npressions, and his guesses to sup})lement them. The impressions,\nwhich are probably telepathic, differ in intensity and clearness, and\nthe one which is strong and clear and comes promptly is usually, but\nnot always, right. Sometimes a faint and dim and slowly developing\nimpression may be equally correct.\nProbably the impression generally comes in a mixed way, partly\nas an idea not of a sensory kind, and partly as a visual or auditory\nimage. The different avenues used are not always distinguishable\nby the percipient, and their use ju'obably depends on the make-up\nof his own mind, whether he is a good visualiser and so forth. Grant-\ning that the subliminal mind plays an important part, we see that\nerror may come in at four stages : \u2014the impression may get into the\nsubliminal in any degree of incompleteness ;\nit may there be further\ndistorted by false associations and inferences ;\nloss may occur again\nin emerging into the supraliminal, through inhibition or otherwise ;\nfinally, the supraliminal may reject some images and misinterpret\nothers.\nIf telepathic impressions come through the subliminal, one im-\nportant quality in a good telepathic percipient may be the power of\ndrawing easily on the contents of his own subliminal.\nThese experiments are instructive for comparison with the auto-\nmatic scripts containing cross-correspondences, because the experi-\nmenters, like our automatists, are persons of wide reading and\nstrongly marked literary tastes, so that quotations and literary\nassociations tend to crop up abundantly in their minds.\nIn 1932, the year of the Society\u2019s Jubilee, when Sir Oliver Lodge\nwas President, Mrs Sidgwick was elected by the Council President\nof Honour. It was then that she wrote the History of the S.P.R.,\nreferred to above, and its concluding sentence, that, upon the\nevidence before her, she herself was \u201c a firm believer both in survival\nand in the reahty of communication l^etween the living and the\ndead,\u201d must be fresh in the memory of all of us.\nAs long as her strength permitted, she went up to London for\nS.P.R. meetings and wrote occasional book-reviews and minor\narticles. She read zealously all the Society\u2019s publications, as well as\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 93\nany important new books on psychical subjects. As a member of\nthe Committee of Reference, she studied carefully the proofs of\narticles for the Proceedings and was in constant consultation with\nthe Society\u2019s officers and other leading workers.\nHer continued openness to new conceptions was remarkable.\n\u201c If this is so, we may have to revise our ideas,\u201d she used to say, and\nclearly there was no opinion that she would not have revised, if the\nfreshly alleged facts had satisfied her critical mind. There are, one\nhopes, many people of whom one could say the same, but not, I\nthink, many who, like her, are always looking out eagerly for new\nfacts\u2014whatever they may lead to\u2014whose intellectual curiosity\nremains insatiable up to the end of so long a fife. She died on\nRebruary 10, 1936, within about a month of her ninety-fixst birthday.\nYet it must not be supposed that the essence of her nature was\npure intellect. She valued human beings far more than ideas, or\neven than the causes for which she would spend herself. Her own\nstandard seemed above the reach of ordinary mortals, but she had\nan infinite tolerance and charity for other people\u2019s weaknesses, and\na most generous appreciation of their capacities and achievements.\nHer Life might perhaps be srmimed up in the words :\n\u201c Mercy and truth are met together ;\nrighteousness and peace have kissed each other.\u201d\n\f94 W. H. Salter : Mrs Heiiry Sidgwich\u2019s [PART*^\nSUPPLEMENT\n[As an Officer of the Society who had been associated with Mrs\nSidgwick in its most recent work, Mr Salter undertook to supplement\nMiss Alice Johnson\u2019s paper ;\nand Mr Besterman begged the Editor\nto include in the Memorial Part a tribute \u201c from the youngest\ngeneration.\u201d]\nI\nBy W. H. Salter\nA WORD should be said about the very great services Mrs Sidgwick\nrendered to the Society as Hon. Secretary during the difficult period\nwhich followed the War. Several of her most important contri-\nbutions to Proceedings were made during this time, but I shall\nconfine myself to the administrative side of her work.\nThe emotional after-effects of the War brought into the Society\na large number of new members with no knowledge of its past\nhistory and traditions, and, in many cases, no deep-seated or en-\nduring desire for research on scientific lines. At the same time new\ntypes of phenomena were requiring investigation. It was therefore\nessential that the direction of the Society\u2019s affairs, so far as they\ndepended on any one individual, should be in the hands of one who\nhad the fullest possible knowledge of past events in the Society,\nand a very firm grip of the essential principles of psychical research,\ncombined with the will and the abihty to apply these principles to\nthe new problems that were arising. In the possession of the required\nqualifications Mrs Sidgwick stood, of course, without a rival, but the\nresignation by Miss Alice Johnson of the post of Research Officer\nduring the War, and shortly afterwards the resignation by Mr\nFeilding of the post of joint Hon. Secretary considerably increased\nthe burden of administrative work thrown upon her. If in the\ncircumstances existing she were to continue to hold the post, she\nwould necessarily be immersed in a mass of petty administrative\ndetail, from which any one of her age, with her record of service, and\nwith the pressure of the research work she was doing, might reason-\nably have claimed to be excused. With characteristic willingness,\nhowever, and disregard of her own convenience, she consented to\nremain in an office which she held and the duties of which she carried\n\f95\n146]\nWork in Psychical Research\nout with the greatest thoroughness imtil within a few years of her\ndeath.\nMiss Newton, who as Secretary was brought into the closest\npossible touch with Mrs Sidgwick, has emphasised in conversation\nwith me how difficult were the years that immediately followed the\nWar, and has expressed her opinion that nobody except Mrs Sidg-\nwick could have carried the Society through them with success. This\nI can readily accept, as it tallies with my own experience as a col-\nleague of Mrs Sidgwick from early m 1921, when I became Hon.\nTreasurer. It was an immense support to me in my inexperience\nthen, and later when I became joint Hon. Secretary, to be able to\nrely in any difficulty that might arise on her experience and advice.\nHowever small the matter on which she was consulted, her advice\nwas invariably prompt, clear, supported by cogent arguments and\npatently the product of much careful thought. Whatever storms\narose (and for many years after the War the Society encountered\nrough weather) she steered us through them with imperturbable\ncheerfulness and confidence.\nPerhaps in those years none of Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s quahties was of\nmore service to the Society than her absolute candour. She regarded\nevery piece of work objectively ;\nwhoever did it, if she had to give\nher opinion on it, she gave it, kindly of course, but so as to leave no\ndoubt whether she thought the work well or badly done. The\nimpersonality of her judgments was quite compatible, and in fact\nassociated in a high degree, with sympathetic understanding of\npeople whose opinions and outlook differed widely from her own.\nSince the War a new generation of researchers has grown up in\nour Society. There is not, I suppose, one of them who would not\nreadily acknowledge that his warmest encouragement, his soundest\nadvice had come from Mrs Sidgwick, and that she had been a\nconstant inspiration to good work, not only by her long record of\nachievement, but by her eagerness to collaborate actively in any\nnew and promising research. If any of them ever felt unpatience\nat the caution of her methods, they soon reahsed that the \u201c guides\u2019\npace \u201d she set was a measure of the height of her aims and of her\nresolve to attain them.\nIn the beginning of 1932, the Society\u2019s Jubilee year, increasing\nphysical infirmity caused her to resign office as Hon. Secretary, but\nshe became President of Honour jointly with Sir Ohver Lodge for\nthat year. Her Jubilee paper was the last of a series of contributions\nto Proceedings, in which the whole history of our Society may be\ntraced. She still remained an active member of the Committee of\nReference, and only a few weeks before her death, when the Council\u2019s\n\f96 Th. Besterman : Mrs Henry Sidgwich\u2019s [part\ndraft Annual Report for 1935 was read to her, she took great interest\nin it and said she thought it very satisfactory and encouraging.\nIt is the greatest gratification to us all to know that she, in whose\nlife the Society had played so large a part, should have been able to\nretain to the last her confidence in its future.\nII\nBy Th. Besterman\nI FIRST met Mrs Sidgwfick in the autumn or winter of the year 1926.\nShe had already entered her ninth decade, and I looked at this great\nlady of whom I had read and heard so much across the chasm of\nnearly sixty years. It was a Committee Meeting at which somewhat\nuninteresting technical details were being discussed. Mrs Sidgwick\nsaid little, but she was very attentive and her gently, but accurately\nobservant eyes studied the speaker. It was clear that she was\nconsidering not only the merits of the case, but also the motives\nand intentions of the proposer. At the end of the meeting Mrs\nSidgwick, having said less but thought more than anyone else,\nquietly put forward a motion which met the situation to everyone\u2019s\nsatisfaction.\nIn the following years this experience was often repeated and this\nfirst impression was as often confirmed. Mrs Sidgwick put her faith\nmore in reflection than in superfluous discussion, and character was\nat least as important to her as ability. This feehng was in a sense\na projection of her own personality, for Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s greatness\nwas in fact due to the union in her of brilliant ability and outstand-\ning character. These things were so perfectly blended in her that\none was often at a loss whether to admire more the accuracy or the\njustice of her judgment.\nThe accident of birth and the process of time added to Mrs\nSidgwick\u2019s mental and moral quahties what was almost as valuable,\nan exceptional range and dejith of experience. Thus it is not sur-\nprising that those who had the privilege of knowing her quality took\nMrs Sidgwick as their touchstone. Certainly during the years in\nwhich I was an official of the Society, I avoided many a hasty\ndecision, many an unwise step, by testing it against what I knew of\nMrs Sidgwick\u2019s opinions. And when I did act in a manner of which\nI knew she would not approve, that knowledge was the obstacle\nmost difficult to overcome. This was true, I think, of every one who\nwas capable of appreciating her singular fineness, a quality, in my\nexperience, peculiar to her, and one which seemed unaffected by the\npassage of time.\n\f146]\nWork in Psychical Research 97\nHistory will no doubt record some, at least, of the perceptible\ninfluence exercised by Mrs Sidgwick on psychical research. Greater\neven than this was her personal influence on those practitioners of\npsychical research who have most usefully contributed to this\nnascent science. If part of the subject matter of psychical research\never attains to the dignity of general recognition, this result will\nbe due to no one individual anywhere so much as to the calm\nenthusiasm, the steady persistence, the bold but sober judgment,\nand the intellectual quality and charm of Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\f- r\\\niliw\ni 'h'-i\n^\" ~\n5.U.

Tyrrell\nIntroduction\nSince the inquiry into modes of perception other than those recog-\nnised as \u201c normal \u201d began to develop an experimental side, the\ntendency has been for it to become more and more a quantitative\nresearch. This appears to be due to the necessity for so framing\nexperiments that statements made by the subjects can be easily\nverified and an estimate made of the probability that such state-\nments, when true, are attributable to chance. Such a method of\nexperiment entails the use of events which are quite trivial, easily\ncontrollable and amenable to calculation ;\nand, since an ordinary\npack of cards provides such a series of events, playing-cards have\nbeen used by several investigators in this field.\nThe history of the piece of research, which is to be described here,\nbegan with some experiments with cards, which were made in the\nyear 1921. In that year the writer had already met Miss G. M.\nJohnson, who was then a girl, taking no particular interest in scienti-\nfic research or even in psychic matters, although she possessed in a\nhalf unconscious way very remarkable psychic gifts. The experi-\nments resulted from a long stay, which Miss Johnson made with the\nwriter and his family in the country, and an account of them is to be\nfound in the Report which appeared in the Journal S.P.R. for June,\n1922, under the title The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. This Report\nwas published anonymously because at the time. Miss Johnson did\nnot wish, for personal reasons, to disclose her identity. The part\nwhich is especially relevant to the present issue is the account given\n\f(t. N 71\/. Tyrrell : Fnriher Research [part\noil |)|). .\u201851 8-1)27 of seven experiments witli cards, wliicli jirovide\nstroiiff evidencic for clairvoyance ;\nwfdle three of tliem have the\na.ppi'a, ranee of being precognitive. Tliese experiments were re-\nmarkable because of the many signs which accompanied them,\nshowing till' subject\u2019s departure from tlie normal state of conscious-\nness, and the ])eculiar and characteristic subjective side of tliem\nwhich showed a, state as far removed as could bo from mere guessing.\n'I\u2019hese card exjieriments form an early, though brief, attempt to\napply the (piantitative method to hlxtra,-Sensory Perception, and\nthe figures show that the results cannot possibly have been due to\nchaiice.\nd\u2019o summarise these exjieriments roughly. Miss Johnson on seven\noccasions gave the denominations, but not the suits, of from five to\neight consecutive cards in a jiack of ordinary jilaying-cards. In the\nfour clairvoyant cases, I had shuffled the jiack very carefully, unseen\nby mysidf or by anyone else, just before she gave them. In the three\njirecognitive caaes, I shuffled the jiack in the same way, but after\nthe. cards had beim given. On being turned iiji, the cards jiroved to\nbe nearly a.II right, excejit for some minor ei'rors. Details will be\nfound in tlu' Itejiort.\nTak'ing all these' seven ('xjieriments together, the jiroba.bility that\nthey are due to chance is of the order tluit is to say, the odds\nagainst their being chance is about a billion, billion, billion to one;\nand the exjihination that Miss Johnson did them by a sujierlative feat\nof conjuring (which sei'ins the only alternative to genuine. Extra-\niSensory Percejition) will jirobably not a.jijiea.l to many, and is quite\nout of the (piestion for myself, jiartly because I know that Miss\nJohnson cannot conjure in the very simjilest way and would not if\nsh(' could, and jiartly because I had my eyes fixed on the cards every\nmonu'nt after the shuffling had been done.\nIh'fore leaving these early exj eriments, I should like to call atten-\nlion fo a, curious point about the last one (ji. 324). If we a.cccjit\nMiss .lolmson\u2019s word about this ('xjieriment, a. seipiencc of ciglit\ncards, jm'viously given, turned uji in the shuffled jia.ck, not merely\none(', but twice on two consecutive da.ys.

She can j^roduce automatic\nwriting easily at will but no very striking material has ever emerged\nfrom it. She can also enter states of trance which tend to maintain\ntheir own independence and are largely resistant to suggestion and\nimpervious to attem])ts at communication by the operator. She has\nno \u201c control.\u201d She possesses also a general faculty which may be\ncalled \u201c paragnostic,\u201d \u201c intuitive,\u201d \u201c extra-sensory-perceptual \u201d or\nwhatever the reader chooses, but which is certainly a \u201c normal\n\u201d\nfactor in her psychological constitution in the sense that it is con-\nstantly present and ]>lays what is, for her, an indispensable role in\nthe affairs of daily life. This facidty j)rovides her with a kind of\nhalf-realised \u201c knowledge \u201d of things and events which, though\nseldom clearly present in the field of normal consciousness, is never-\ntheless powerful enough to determine many of her actions, which it\nseems to direct from a seat somewhere on the fringe of consciousness.\nIt is of the greatest practical utility and everything seems to lie\nwithin its scope, from the making of an important decision to the\nfinding of some trifling object.\nIt would be useless here to give exam])les of the ])ractical working\nof this faculty, interesting thougli such examples are, for they occur\nspontaneously and cannot as a rule t)e clearly attested by iiule{)en-\ndent witnesses or clearly proved to l>e beyond the range of chance.\nTheir power to convince de])cnds upon their cumulative effect when\nseen at close range, and still moj'e upon tlieir ])ractical utility.\nThe pragmatic test is probably the most convincing to common sense,\nbut not to the critic who stands aloof. A demonstration of the\nwide-spread success of a faculty in matters of daily life is apt to\ncall forth the criticism that the detailed items of it are not logically\nperfect as evidence : while the production of a logically perfect case\ncalls forth the opposite criticism that no single case can be convincing\nunless it is shown to belong to a wide-sjtread genus. And so the\npendulum swings backwards and forwards between two different\nconceptions of evidence.\nThus, it will probably be more useful to describe here the sub jective\naspect of Miss Johnson\u2019s facidty, since, if her experiences are reliable,\ntheir coincidence with events which seem to be j)aranormal on other\ngrounds constitutes in itself evidence of a different kind ;\nand Miss\nJohnson, being an unemotional subject, may lie taken to bo reliahle\nin the account which she gives of her feelings, ddie following extracts\nfrom a paper which she read to the 8.T.li. on :^9th January, Id-'h),\nwill serve to illustrate this subjective aspect. \u201c The supernormal,\u201d\n\f102 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nshe says, \u201c is stamped with a feeling which is like nothing else. This\nstamp or feeling is all-important. I invariably trust to it in the\naffairs of daily life and have never known it to fail ;\nbut it is practi-\ncally impossible to describe it. All I can say is that it has a settled\nfeeling of finality ai)out it. It impels you and simply does not let\nyou doubt it. If one ever tries to go against it the feeling is strongly\nunsatisfactory ;\nl)ut if one does as it impels, there is a very satis-\nfactory feeling of accomplishment and rightness.\u201d And, with re-\ngard to the experience she has of feeling a certain quality about the\n])eople she meets :\n\u201c When you are in a very sensitive state, this is\nlike being exposed to the weather and being, in a sense, bare to the\ntelepathic climate. While it is true that the presence of certain\npeople puts you in the psychic sunshine, it is also true that the\npresence of other peojjle puts you in the psychic East wind. It is\nextremely difficult to explain these feelings in words. There are\nsome people who seem to raise me up to a height. As soon as I am\nin their presence, I have a feeling of enthusiasm and happiness and\neverything feels what I can only describe as \u2018\nlight.\u2019 There is a\nfeeling of rightness about it too\u2014a satisfactory feeling of things being\nas they should be. And there is more even than that. There is a\nfeeling of being brought into touch with reality ;\nand this \u2018\nreality-\nfeeling,\u2019 if I may call it so, is the hall-mark of this kind of person ;\nand also of all knowledge which comes in a genuinely supernormal\nway. There is even something of this feeling of being in touch with\nreality in the trivial act of opening the right box in the machine\nwhen the success is not due to chance. But nothing which comes to\none in the normal way has this \u2018\nreality-feeling \u2019\nabout it.\n\u201c And this feeling has its opposite. There is an atmosphere which\nlacks all \u2018\nlightness,\u2019 from which joy and enthusiasm seem to ebb\naway and all seems heavy and difficult. One\u2019s supernormal faculty\nwill not come into play under these conditions ;\nit retires into its\nshell. And so one of the most important conditions, if one wishes\nto get experimental results, is to encourage the former atmosphere\nand to avoid the latter.\u201d\ni\\Iy experience amply bears this out. The condition which Miss\nJohnson here describes as \u201c light \u201d is the key to success in experi-\nmental work. It is this which really matters more than anything\nelse ;\nand the investigator who is genuinely searching for truth\ncannot afford to ignore it. It may be that there are some people\nwho regard such subjective conditions as mere personal \u201c fancies,\u201d\nimj)roper and inimical to the impersonal dignity of scientific re-\nsearch. If so, I am certain that such people will find that they have\nsacrificed relevant facts of primary importance to conventional ideas\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 103\nof decorum. To ignore such, facts is not only to court failure in\npractice, but also to run the risk of making oneself ridiculous ;\nfor\nit is an attempt to dictate to nature and to force the facts of\npsychical research to conform to ideas of what they ought to be,\ninstead of admitting them to be what they are. We cannot pick\nand choose among the material which nature offers us. If we do,\nwe may find ourselves exemplifying the saying, \u201c Nature abhors a\nmugwump.\u201d\nThe reference to opening the right box alludes to the experiments\nwhich are to be described below. Miss Johnson says that in doing\nthese experiments she can, as a rule, distinguish between those suc-\ncesses which are due to the exercise of her own faculty and those\nwhich are due to chance,.\nIt was not until the summer of 1934 that events made it possible\nfor Miss Johnson to rejoin me in starting again on the experimental\nwork which we had begun in 1921 ;\nand this time we were fortunate\nin being able to start in London.\nDuring the intervening years, a good deal of work on quantitative\nlines had been done elsewhere, one of the most notable examples\nbeing the experiments carried out by Dr J. B. Rhine at the Duke\nUniversity in North Carolina and published by him in America in\n1934. He had used several subjects and had obtained what seemed,\nin view of the previous experience of others, astonishingly high rates\nof success. He had differentiated clairvoyance, as Miss Johnson and\nI had also done, from a combination of clairvoyance with telepathy.\nIt is from Dr Rhine that I have adopted the term \u201c Extra-\nSensory Perception,\u201d using it to cover all modes of cognition which\nare paranormal ;\nand for brevity I shall in future refer to it by its\ninitials, E.S.P.\nIn October 1934 I was particularly struck by a feature in Miss\nJohnson\u2019s faculty, viz. the extreme satisfaction\u2014one might almost\nsay the excitement of satisfaction\u2014which accompanied the finding\nof any lost object. If one could create such an excitement, even in a\nmild way, and make the condition of its satisfaction the performance\nof some experiment on a measurable basis, it seemed that it might\nbe possible to harness it in the work of demonstrating E.iS.P. It was\nthis which led me to construct, in the Autumn of 1934, an apparatus\nin which a pointer, representing the hidden object, was thrust into\none of five small boxes from behind, while the subject raised the lid\nof one of the boxes from in front, trying to find in which box the\npointer was hidden. It was easy with this arrangement to observe\nsuccesses and failures, while the \u201c finding interest \u201d was sustained\nthrough series of trials which were carried out with great rapidity.\n\f104 0. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nA description of these experiments and their resnlts was puldished\nin the Journal S.P.R. for April, 1935.\nThe experiments now to be described were carried on from the\npoint where this Report comes to an end. They include the exten-\nsion of Miss Johnson\u2019s work to trials with other agents or operators ;\nthe tests of other subjects besifles herself ;\nsome experiments with\ncards, and the construction and employment of a more elaborately\ndeveloped machine arising out of the simple box-apparatus worked\nwith the pointer. These experiments are given in the historical\norder in which they occurred, and the reader must understand that\nthe progress of events rvas more in the nature of an unplanned ad-\nventure than of a previously thought out experiment. The new\napparatus was partly improvised as events moved on, and this,\ncombined with the constantly fluctuating rate of scoring, makes it\nvery rlilficult to present the resrdts in a clear and logical way. I can\nonly hope that the development of events will Ije sufficiently in-\ntelligible in the account that follows.\nThe Quantitative Method of Experiment\nThis method received a great impetus when Miss Ina Jephson\npublished her Report on the Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-\nGuessing in Proceedings S.P.R. 109. She has earned the gratitude\nof all workers in this field by the alile way in which she showed that\nthe question of chance can only be dealt with by the systematic\nuse of the theory of probability : and in doing so she strengthened\nthis research at its weakest point, for an unknown chance-factor has,\nin the past, rendered many results in psychical research nebulous,\nand has given the scientific mind an excuse for ignoring the subject.\nThe quantitative principle may be applied to the field of Extra-\nSensory Perception in two ways : either by using (1) the Collective\nmethod of exjierinient or (2) the Individual method.\nThe Collective method aims at flinging a net as widely as possible\nover all and sundry ;\nin pooling the information thus caught and in\nsifting it for significance by mathematical analysis. The Individual\nmethod, on the other hand, aims at making a close-range study of\none, or at most of two or three, specially selected subjects. Both\nmethods, no doubt, have their uses and may be distinguished as\nbelonging to their respective fields.\n(1) The Collective Method. This appears to be applicable to two\npurposes ; (a) as a means for testing the theory that E.S.P. may be\na facidty .spread widely and evenly amongst mankind, but present\nin each individual only in a small degree. Then a large number of\n\f105\n147] in Extra-Sensory Perception\ntrials will be needed to reveal tlie faculty and these will best be\nobtained by pooling the results from a number of subjects. (6) As a\nmeans for testing how the faculty is distributed among mankind, if\nit should prove not to be equally possessed by all.\n(1) (a) An important point to notice is that, if the theory of the\neven spread of the faculty is not true and if there should be a few\nindividuals here and there who possess it in fairly marked degree,\nwhile there are hundreds who do not possess it at all, then the Col-\nlective method will merely mask the fact of its existence by swamping\nthe scores of those who possess it with the merely chance scores of the\nmajority who do not.\nIf any individual subject scores well above chance expectation\nwhen tested alone, there is no reason whatever for including such a\nsubject in a group. To include a subject, who scores well alone, in a\ngroup, may easily lead to an absurdity : for if the group is large\nenough, and entirely composed of non-scorers except for the one\ngood subject, it may easily happen that the latter\u2019s score is not\ngreater than could be accounted for by chance within the large,\ncollective total. The verdict of the collective experiment would\nthen be \u201c probably chance \u201d ;\nbut the verdict of the individual\nexperiment would be \u201c certainly not chance.\u201d It is clear that the\ncollective verdict in such a case would have to be rejected, for it\nwould be absurd to claim that an experimental fact could be altered\nby merely placing it in association with a number of other dis-\nconnected facts. By including the subject in a number of different\narbitrary groups, the verdict could be made to go, now one way and\nnow the other, and the results of an experiment would become\nfluid instead of fixed. The probability that a George Washington\nwill speak the truth is not affected by thinking of him in connection\nwith any number of liars. Therefore it is not wise to include a sub-\nject who scores alone in any kind of mass-experiment.\n(1) (b) The use of the Collective method for discovering the\ndistribution of the faculty of E.S.P. amongst mankind raises two\ndifficulties :\n(i) Suppose that a group of subjects show collective\nsignificance and only slight individual significances. It will be said\nthat there will be a danger in accepting the latter as genuine unless\nthey are much greater than can reasonably be referred to chance\nwitiiin a block of results of that size. But, if it is illegitimate to\npick out the best scorers from among the group as the possessors of\nE.S.P. faculty, how can the Collective method help to tell us any-\nthing about the distribution of the faculty ? Apparently, the highest\nscorers would have to be abstracted from the grouj) and retested\nindividually with much larger numbers of trials. In this way, also.\n\flOf) G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\ngood siil)jects miglit l>e discovered ;\nl)ut it would l)e a laborious\nway of doing it, and not nearly so practical, one would tliirdc, as\n2\n>ersonal inquiry based on conunon sense, (ii) The distribution of\nE.S.P. involves the cpiestion :\n\u201c What percentage of the population\npossesses the faculty ?\n\u201d Is this question capable of receiving a\ndefinite answer ? Put in this form, it makes the assumption that the\nfaculty is one which has an objective fixity, like being over six feet\nhigh or weighing over twelve stone. But experience points to the\nfaculty as being something dependent on variable mental and physio-\nlogical conditions in the subject. Although it is no doubt true to\nsay that, on the whole, some jjeople possess the faculty in a more\nmarked degree than others, yet there is no reason to expect that its\ndistribution could lie expressed in any satisfactory way as a per-\ncentage : and it is difficult to see why importance should be at-\ntached to discovering such a figure. AVhat we are concerned to know\nis the existence of the faculty and something about its nature ;\nand\nwhether 10% of the population possess it in workable degree or 90%\ndoes not seem to be of first inqrortance.\n(2) The Individual Method. This, on the other hand, possesses\ngreat advantages over the Collective. In the first place, the in-\nvestigator, being in touch with the subject, is able to foster the\nfaculty he wishes to observe and is not obhged merely to accept the\nmaterial that chance throws in his way. With the Collective method,\nhe must take what comes to him and make the best of it, and unless\nhe is extremely fortunate, his material will probably consist of\n\u201c low-grade ore.\u201d Indeed, the very usefulness of the Collective\ninethod depends on there being a widespread mass of low-grade ore\nto deal with. But this means that j^ositive results, if there are any,\nwill lie near the level of significance ;\nand there is a, danger in relying\non small deviations from chance-expected values unless one is very\ncertain that the conditions assumed in the experiments hold with\ngreat exactness. The experimenter is, indeed, likely to be right\nal)out the conditions in the main ;\nbut it is very difficult to be sure\nthat nothing has been overlooked which might make a small differ-\nence to the probability of success. For this reason, in the j^resent\nexperiments, no stress has been laid on any results unless the figure\nfor the anti-chance probability is a long way above the commonly\naccepted significant value.\nAgain, the Individual method allows of the use of apparatus by\nmeans of which each subject can be put through a very large number\nof trials. But the Collective method cannot make use of any but\nthe simplest apparatus and hence cannot test its subjects under the\nbest conditions.\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 107\nOn general grounds the Individual method seems a more ])ractical\nway of going to work than the Collective, for, if there is one thing\nthat experience reveals, it is the paramount importance for the in-\nvestigator to keep in close, personal touch with his subject. Nature\nhas rivetted human attention on the channels of normal perce]>tion\nand has placed subconscious barriers against the flow of paranor-\nmally acquired knowledge into the consciousness : and, as a result,\nthe main task of the experimenter is to find a way of surmounting\nthese subconscious barriers by discovering and allaying resistances\nand inhibitions and by preventing their growth. The essential\navenue of approach to psychical research is that of the psychologist\nand not that of the statistician ;\nand the main use of mathematics\nin this subject should lie for the evaluation of chance in any particular\nexperiment.\nTests with a Number of Sub.jects\nIn March 1935, I was asked by the Council of the S.P.K. to experi-\nment with a number of subjects in order to test whether the results\nobtained with Miss Johnson could be repeated with others ;\nand also\nto find out whether a repetition of experiments on the lines followed\nby Dr Rhine, and published in his book Extra-Sensory Perception,\nwould show a percentage of successful subjects at all comparable\nwith his. Accordingly, between the 3rd April and 4th November,\n1935, 30 subjects were tested with the Pointer Apparatus and 21 out\nof the same group with \u201c Zener \u201d cards of the kind which Dr Rhine\nhad used in his experiments. Miss Johnson entered into these\nexperiments on an equal footing (at least as regards external condi-\ntions) with the other subjects, working in all cases with an agent\nother than myself, since all the other subjects were working with a\nstranger.\nThese experiments were carried out at the Rooms of the S.P.R.\nI regarded this use of the Pointer Apparatus as a ])reliminary test\nfrom which to select subjects for further tests with the Electrical\nApparatus afterwards ;\nalthough there would be this additional\npoint of interest, to find out what percentage of a group of subjects\ngathered ad hoc would be successful. It was considered unnecessary\nto have witnesses at these trials, since there was no way in which the\nsubject could score by misusing the machine without it being\nobserved by the operator. Also, they were preliminary, and it would\nbe sulhcient to call witnesses for the final trials. The argument\nthat there should always be a witness, not as a check on the accuracy\nof the record, but as a guarantee of the good faith of the experi-\n\f108 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [pakt\nmenters, seems logically to lead to the necessity for a second witness\nto guarantee the good faith of the first, and so on ad infinitum.\nThus, witnessing from this point of view becomes something of an\nabsurdity. In these experiments, the operator has also been the\nrecorder, unless otherwise stated.\nWith this apparatus, subjects have the oj^portunity of seeing the\npointer in the box, when the right one is opened, and so of knowing\neach time they score a success : but, unless the subject is sitting\nforward and the light is good, it is not always easy to see the pointer\nin the fraction of a second during which the box is open. Many\nsubjects say that they only see the pointer occasionally, and one\nsubject said that she never even looked for it.\nIn some experiments, the signal for the subject to open a box was\ngiven by the operator saying the word \u201c In \u201d ;\nin others by his tap-\nping on the floor with his foot. This is indicated in the Table by\nthe words \u201c In \u201d and \u201c Tap \u201d respectively.\nAbbreviatio7is\nIn giving exjjerimental results, the following abbreviations will\nbe made use of ;\nNo. = the serial number of the result.\nT = the number of Trials.\nN = the number of Successes.\nd = the deviation from Chance Exjjectation (above or below).\n% = the Successes as a percentage of the total number of Trials.\nX= the Deviation divided by the Standard Error.\nP = the Probability that the result is due to Chance.\nThose taking part are indicated by their initials as follows :\nG.J.

Mr Tyrrell.\nThe method of carrying out the experiments and of recording\nthem is the same as that described in the Journal S.P.R. 511 for\nApril 1935 on p. 56, from which the following paragraph is quoted.\n\u201c The apparatus was placed with a strong light on the percipient\u2019s\nside. The operator thrust the pointer into one hole at a time at\nrandom, saying the word \u2018\nIn \u2019\neach time. On hearing the word\n\f147] in Extra-Sensory Perception 109\n\u2018\nIn,\u2019 the percipient opened one of the box-lids. The oj)erator,\nnoticing which box the light came through, scored the result on\nsquared paper, making a tick for a success and a dot for a failure.\u201d\nThe percipient was separated from the operator by a large wooden\nscreen and the sound of the pointer was rendered negligible by care-\nful padding of the boxes.\n(For readers who are not conversant with mathematical symbols,\nit may be as well to add that a probalhlity is always expressed in\nthe form of a fraction. Thus, the statement that the probability of\nsuccess is 1\/5 means, in common language, that the odds against\nsuccess are 4 to 1. If the probability that a result is due to chance is\nless than 0-01, it is arl)itrarily taken to be significant.\nA probalhlity of 0-01 or 1 \/lOO is equivalent to odds of 99 to 1\nagainst. A probability of 0-001 or 1\/1000 or 10~\u00ae is equivalent to\nodds of 999 to 1 against, or approximately of 1000 to 1 against, and\nso on.\nThe figures for P in the probability column are only approximate.\nBy the time we reach figures sufficiently low to be rehable, their\naccuracy has ceased to matter : the order is sufficient. They are\ntaken from a curve plotted from tables of the Probability Integral\ngiven in Dr R. A. Fisher\u2019s book.

They are\ntests of individual subjects, and each test is independent of all the\nothers. The result shows that four of the 30 subjects have scored\nsignificantly, while the rest have not. Nothing but confusion would\nresult from considering these four successful sul)jects in connection\nwith a group. The significant results are Nos. 2, 12, 21 and 22 ;\nand\nthe two outstanding ones are Nos. 12 and 21, obtained by Mrs\nHemingway and Miss Johnson resj^ectively. Miss Johnson\u2019s results\nwere oljtained with four different operators.\nIt may be as well to insert here the com]>lete figures of Miss John-\nson\u2019s scores with o])erators other than G.N.M.T. There were six of\nthese ;\nbut two of them experimented with her when acting as\nwitnesses in her previously reported experiments, and so have not\nbeen included in the above Table. When they are included, the\ntotals with all operators other than G.N.M.T. are as follows :\nTable 11\nPointer Apparatus\nG.J. ivith various Operators\nNo. ( )j)crator T S d 0\/\n\/o A' P\n.3.5 Il.F.S. - 400 121 + 41 30-2 5-1 10-7\n30 (bH. - 600 169 + 49 28-1 5-0 10-\u2019\n37 C.V.C.H. 2000 494 + 94 24-7 5-2 10-7\n38 C.H. - 400 89 + 9 22-2 M 0-13\n39 H. de G.S. - 1300 351 + 91 27-0 6-3 10-9\n40 G.W.F. -\n3800 902 + 142 24-0 5-7 10-8\n41 'fotals - 8500 2126 + 426 25-0 11-5 10-29\nThis Talile shows clearly that Miss Johnson\u2019s scoring is not the\noutcome of some condition which is dependent on one particular\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Percej)tion 111\noperator. She has scored a long way above chance with five out of\nthese six operators, and the total with all operators is colossally\nabove chance.\nThe largest number of trials was done with Mr Fisk. He says, with\nreference to his detailed scores, which are omitted here for lack of\nspace, \u201c If the figures are examined it will be noticed that Miss\nJohnson\u2019s scoring deteriorated somewhat after the first two weeks\nof the experiment. This is probably due to the fact that I deliber-\nately tried to make it difficult for Miss J. to score. After the first\ncouple of sittings I realised that there was no particular object in\ncontinuing the experiment merely to confirm the work Mr Tyrrell\nhad already done in over 30,000 trials. She could obviously score\nwell above chance with me as operator in place of Mr Tyrrell. So I\nceased to give Miss Johnson what might be termed a fair deal. I\nwatched her guesses very carefully to see if I could detect any\nnumerical habits and then did my best to thwart her. Occasionally\nI purposely neglected one or two of the Ijoxes for a whole series of\ntrials. She however kept on scoring well above chance. I was most\nsuccessful in my opposition of 28th August when I used pre-selected\nnumbers that slowed down the operation very considerably. I had\nalso tried chaffing her a little before the trials and for this or other\nreasons her score dropped to chance expectation only for that day.\nOn the previous day (23rd August) I had used pre-selected numbers\n(but without any previous attemj^t to ruffle Miss J.\u2019s feelings) and\nafter guessing two series at a chance score (20, 20) she managed a\n27 and 34. Her lowest score was 14 on 24th Sept. . . . From the\nresult I do not see how one can escape from the conclusion that some\nfactor other than chance is involved.\u201d Further, he says ;\n\u201c The\none important consideration is the question of the validity of\nthe assumption that chance-expectation of success in every trial\nis 1\/5. Is this assumption undermined by the possibility that any\nparticular operator may have \u2018\nnumber-habits \u2019\nand does the per-\ncipient learn these habits, consciously or unconsciously, and so\nbegin to score above chance expectation ? If so, the fact that\nMiss J. has made high scores at once with new operators would seem\nto show that if number habits exist we all of us have precisely\nthe same habits. AVere that so we should surely be aide to detect\nthem. But analysis of successive numbers chosen by different\noperators has failed to show any favourite seqiiences. The fact\nthat Miss J. also scores with pre-selected numbers (chosen by dice\nor other mechanical means) is evidence against any numl)er-haldt\nexplanation.\u201d\nThree different operators used lunnbers which had been selected\n\f[part\n112 G.

(2) That there is a markedly\nhigher rate of success in No. 44 than in Nos. 42 and 43. This is\nevidently due to the difference between working under the \u201c Home \u201d\ncondition with a familiar ojierator and working under the \u201c Out\n\u201d\ncondition with a conqiarative stranger.\nEjfect of Signal for opening Boxes\nIn the case of three of the best scorers, the Tapping signal was used,\nviz. with Mrs Hemingway, Mr Miller and Mrs Bramley-Moore. With\nsome sulijects, both methods were tried alternately, and two scored\nat a slightly higher rate with the Tapping than with the In signal ;\nand one slightly higher with the In than with the Tapping. A fourth\nscored almost at the same rate with lioth ;\nso that there is no evi-\ndence that it made any difference in which way the signal was given.\nThe Question of Help from the Auditory Sense\nA note may be interposed here with regard to the suggestion that\nthe sound of the ])ointer may give some guide to the percipient.\nIn March 1936 an experiment was carried out with a makeshift\n])ointer consisting of a pencil with a piece of flannel wrapped round\nit, and used in bare-wooden lioxes. There were slight, audible\nsounds ;\nbut the percipient could not locate them or make any use\nof them. Tlierefore with the carefully padded Ijoxes in this apjjaratus\nall help from supjiosed sounds must lie out of the question.\nThe Prohalrility of Success with the Pointer Apparatus\n4die system of allowing the operator to choose his lioxes, as ofiposed\nto the metliod of using jire-selected numbers, does admittedly make\n^ See also footnote on p. 151.\n\f113\n147] in Extra-Sensory PercejSion\nit impossible to say exactly what the distrilmtion of the choice of\nboxes has been. And it may be argued that, as there is a departure\nhere from the random selection of pure chance, there will be a ten-\ndency to raise the probability of success. This question of what\nfactors affect the probability of success will be gone into presently\nin greater detail when the Electrical Apparatus is dealt with : but\nit may be pointed out here that the scores of the 26 subjects who\nhave shown no sign that they are getting anything but chance results\nare, in fact, clustered very closely about the value 20%. Thus, if\nthey are chance scorers, the probability of success when the operator\nis choosing his boxes, must be very close indeed to 1\/5. I am aw'are\nthat this argument may be attacked on logical grounds, since the\nfour good scorers have first been removed from the group ;\nbut,\nsince the great majority scored at the same rate and this rate was\n20%, it seems in accordance with common sense to conclude that\nthis confirms the assumption that the probability of success is\nalmost exactly 1\/5.\nMr FisFs Metliod of Scoring\nAnother question which will have to be raised is whether it is\npossible to score with the Pointer Apparatus according to the methotl\ndiscovered by Mr Fisk. M'hat this method is will be explained\nlater d but the opinions of some operators who have used the ap-\nparatus in practice as to the likelihood of scores being obtained (a) by\nthe operator following the habits of the subject, or (6) by the subject s\nusing the Fisk method, are appended here.\nThese operators were asked :\n(1) Do you consider that the scores obtained when you operated\nwith the Pointer Apparatus might have been obtained liy your\nchoosing the boxes in the same order in which you had observed the\nsubject to be choosing them ?\n(2) Do you think it possible that the subject could have scored\nby continuing to open one box at a time until a success was obtained ;\ngoing on to another box and continuing to open that until a success\nwas obtained and so on, without your observing this and avoiding\nthe box which was being repeatedly opened ?\nThe answers were :\nC.V.C.H. (1) Possible, but unlikely. (2) No.\n1 A full explanation of this will be given below in the section entitled A\nNew System of Scoring \u201d (p. 153) ;\nbut it may be said here that it consisted\nessentially in the repeated opening of the same box by the percipient until a\nsuccess was obtained.\n\f114 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nH. de G.S. (1)1 never consciously observed the percipient to have\na preference for any particular order and it seems to me most un-\nlikely that I observed anything of this kind unconsciously. I have\nnot the records of the experiments by me, but so far as I remember,\nthere was no marked improvement in the later experiments such as\none might expect if I was observing the j^ercipient\u2019s number habits\nand acting on them.\n(2) I am pretty certain that if the percipient had done aything of\nthe kind I should have noticed it. It was immediately apparent to\nme when the perci];>ient opened the same box twice running (which\nshe did from time to time). I did notice that she very rarely, if ever,\nin my experiments opened the same box three times running.\nG.W.F. (1) No. No preferences were observed although I was\ncontinually on the watch for them. Had I observed any preference\nit would have told against the percipient\u2019s score as I should have been\nable to \u201c dodge \u201d her more successfully.\n(2) Quite impossil)le. During my experiments the percipient rarely\nopened the same Ijox twice in succession and never, to the best of\nmy remembrance, thrice.\nResults with Cards\nA pack of \u201c Zener \u201d cards was used for these experiments of a kind\nsimilar to those used by Dr Rhine and described in his book Extra-\nSensory Perception. These cards contain five diagrams, a Cross, a\nRectangle, a Circle, a Star, and Wavy Lines. There are five cards\nwith each diagram, making 25 cards in the pack.\nThe method adopted in the experiments was as follows : the\nsubject and operator sat in the same positions as for the Pointer\nexjieriments, that is, one on each side of a narrow table divided by a\nwooden screen measuring 26\" by 26\". The operator shuffled the\n])ack of cards behind the screen before each experiment and placed\nit face downwards on the table in front of him. He then said the\nword \u201c Ready \u201d or \u201c Now \u201d to the percipient, and turned the cards\nup one by one, placing each in turn rather noisily face upwards on\nthe talde and looking at it as he did so. On hearing the card put\ndown on the table, the percipient called and the operator entered\nthe call and the actual card side by side in parallel columns. The\nagent did not speak at all during the experiment, and the percipient\ndid not see or toucli the cards. The jirobability of success was\nassumed to be 1\/5.\nThe number of trials done liy each subject varied according to the\ntime and opportunity which each was able to provide.\n\f115\n147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception\nTable IV\nCards\nDale, April 3 to November 4, 1935.

Mrs Varvill\u2019s and Miss Johnson\u2019s scores\nalone reach to just about the point of significance ;\nbut neither is\nhigh enough to support any positive conclusion. Treated collectively,\nthe group shows very exactly the chance rate of scoring.\nWhereas I was the operator in all cases except one, Mr Fisk was\nthe operator in Miss Johnson\u2019s case. He says :\n\u201c From 27th June\n1935 to January 1936 I conducted a series of Card Guessing te.sts with\nMiss Johnson, using Zener cards. Conditions were varied from time\nto time. Thus, the percipient was sometimes screened from a view\nof the cards ;\nsometimes she was allowed to see the card turned up\nafter her guess ;\nsome tests were for pure clairvoyance, others for\nclairvoyance and telepathy mixed, etc., the object being to discover,\nif possible, whether Miss J. would be able, in any variation of the\n\fIIG G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nmethod used, to obtain a significant score. After over 1000 mixed\ntrials results were a little promising ;\nsuccesses were significantly\nabove chance expectation (A = 2-66, P= 0-004) and we were en-\ncouraged to continue, but she did not seem to show any marked\npreference for any particular set of conditions\u2014she scored impartially\na little above chance with them all.\n\u201c But at this juncture Mr Tyrrell and I discovered that it is possible\nto obtain apparently significant scores with Zener cards under\ncertain conditions by using systematised guessing.\u201d (This system\nwill be described later.)\nMr Fisk goes on to say :\n\u201c AVe adopted the following method.\nG. W.F. shufiles and cuts the jjack of 25 cards and holds the pack face\ndownwards in the left hand. Sitting behind a screen with G.N.M.T.\nhe takes the first card, turns it over, places it face upwards on the\ntable and says \u2018\nNow.\u2019 Miss d. \u2014the other side of the screen and\nunable to see the operation\u2014names a card. G.N.M.T. records her\nguess. The same procedure is followed right through the pack\nexcej)t that after the first card no word is spoken as Miss J. is able\nto hear the card being placed on the table (put down purposely with\na bang). After 25 trials G.W.F. picks up the upturned pack\ntaking care to preserve the order of the cards\u2014reverses it and calls\nout each card for G.N.M.T. to record against Miss J.\u2019s guesses.\nSuccesses are then counted. The j)ack is run through as rapidly as\nG.W.F. can turn the cards.\u201d\n(The results obtained by this method are No. 57 in Table IV.)\nMr Fisk continues : \u201cAs operator I was impressed by the way\nthat occasionally Miss J. would score nothing at all for quite a con-\nsiderable number of trials and then, suddenly, begin to score at a\nhigh and consistent rate. She seems either to be very bad or very\ngood at it. There was also confirmation of what Mr Tyrrell has\njireviously noted, viz. her difiiculty in expressing any paranormal\nfeeling in words. There were several instances when from behind\nthe screen I could hear her begin to say, for example, \u2018\ns-s-st\n\u2019\n(an evident attempt to pronounce the word \u2018\nstar \u2019) and then, as\nthough giving it up, changing to \u2018\ncross \u2019\nor \u2018\noblong,\u2019 etc. In, I\nthink, every case her first attempt would have been correct. Some-\ntimes, too, she would correct a call with \u2018\nI really meant to say so\nand so \u2019\nand here again she was generally, though not always,\ncorrect. Needless to say corrections were not counted in the score.\u201d\nThe fact that we have in G.J. a sul)ject who scores well beyond the\nsignificance point with the Pointer and is one of the only two who\napproach this point with the Cards suggests that there is something\nmore difficult about the card method than about the pointer method.\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 117\nIn fact, it suggests that we may have been testing the card sub] ects\nunder conditions which were just too difficult. If the card method is\ninherently more difficult than the pointer method, it is also true that\nit has not been given the advantage of \u201c Home \u201d conditions. Miss\nJohnson never concentrated on them with myself as operator ; the\nsubjects met by appointment, doing a few trials once or twice a\nweek. There is evidently a great difference between what may be\ncalled \u201c Home \u201d and \u201c Out \u201d conditions, as can be shown liy re-\nverting for a moment to the figures supphed by Miss J. with the\nPointer Apparatus.\nT.A.BLE V\nNo. Conditions Rate of Scoring %\n68 G.N.M.T. operator under \u201c Home \u201d\nconditions ----- 31-2\n69 Two witnesses of experiments (G.H. and\nH.F.S.) act casually as operators under\n\u201c Home \u201d conditions - - - 29-0\n70 Three strangers (C.V.C.H., C.H. and\nH. de G.S.) act as operators under\n\u201c Out \u201d conditions - - - - 25-2\nAnd the same thing is shown by the differences between No. 44\nand Nos. 42 and 43 in Table III.\nIf the subjects in the Card experiments had had the opportunity\nof working for some time in their home surroundings with an ex-\nperimenter with whom they were quite famihar, would some of them\nhave scored 1 It seems not improbable. If Miss J. had worked on\nthe cards for some time at home, she would very likely have scored\nin the end.\nThis raises a point which has a bearing on a possible criticism\nwhich might be made of these experiments, viz. that they should\nhave been carried out on a larger scale ;\nand that with more exten-\nsive results they would have made a more valuable comparison with\nthose of Dr Rhine. The figures just quoted show, however, that the\nconditions possible with a single subject are not possible with a\nnumber ;\nand, in fact, that it is just the difference between what has\nbeen called \u201c Home \u201d conditions and what has been called \u201c Out\n\u201d\nconditions that shows itself in the score. This difference may be a\nsubtle one and not easy to put down in black and white ;\nbut it is\nthere. And the question which raises itself is whether the conditions\nof Dr Rhine\u2019s experiments were more comparable with those in\nwhich Miss J. scored 31% or with those in which she scored 25%.\n\fUS G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nOne cannot assess an intangilile thing like a mental atmosphere.\nOne cannot even bring its existence home to some people ;\nyet it\nmakes all the difference to the results. But there is, I think even an\ninsensitive person might admit, a difference between coming once or\ntwice a week to a dull room to go through an experiment with a\nstranger, and doing an experiment in a university as an under-\ngraduate \"with other undergraduates. The latter may be nearer to\nthe \u201c Home \u201d than to the \u201c Out \u201d condition. Hence, one must ask\nwhether, if these experiments had l)een very much extended, they\nwould still have come anywhere near to being a duplication of Dr\nKhine\u2019s ? And whether any figures about the \u201c distrihution \u201d of\nthe faculty of Extra-Sensory Perception could safely be based on the\nnumber of subjects who happened to score above chance. It cer-\ntainly seemed to me better to take the two or three subjects who\nshowed 2)i\u2019omise and to concentrate attention on them.\nThere is another consideration affecting the use of cards in general\nwhich these results suggest, when taken in conjunction with the\nsuccess with the Pointer Apparatus. It seems possible that all the\ncard experiments so far made have begun too high up in the scale\nof complexity. No doid)t, people first l)egan to use playing-cards\nfor telepathic experiments because they were easy to obtain : but,\nwith their two colours, four suits, with court cards separate from the\nothers and no striking differences between the arrangements of the\npips, they are obviously unsuitable for work in E.S.P. The Zener\ncards are a great im])rovement on playing-cards ;\nbut even they are\nfar from presenting the simplest possible kind of event for a percep-\ntual faculty to take hold of. It is true, of course, that we do not know\nwhether clairvoyance is at all analogous in its processes with visual\nor any kind of normal perception ;\nbut we know at least that para-\nnormal knowledge, however acquired, must emerge ;\nand in its emer-\ngence it usually takes sensuous forms. So that we have some ground\nfor supposing that the simpler the event presented for clairvoyant\ncognition, the better chance it will have of getting through. Now,\nthe simplest event one can present would seem to be a bare contrast,\nsuch as that l)etween black and white or light and dark, etc. ;\nand\nthis is what the Pointer Apparatus does and also the Electrical\nMachine, to be described later. The Pointer Apparatus presents the\ncontrast between a white box empty and a white box with a dark\n])ointer in it. And the Electrical Apparatus presents the contrast\nbetween a lamp which is alight and a lain}) which is out. But the\nZener cards demand the recognition of a diagram, and, although\nthe diagram may be a sinijile one, it makes a much greater demand\non any ])erce})tual faculty than does a sim])lo contrast. Su]j})ose, for\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 119\ninstance, that one were asked to look at something exposed to view\nfor only a brief fraction of a second in order to say what it was,\nwould it be easier to say whether it was just something light or dark\nor whether it was a cross or a circle ? Of course, it is possible that\nclairvoyance may work in such a way that it does not make any\ndifference what the event is that is open for its percej^tion ;\nbut it\nwould be on the safe side to assume that it does.\nA simple contrast could be arranged with cards, no doul)t. The\nsubject might be asked to distinguish between a card with a white\nface and a card with a black one, or between a blank card and a card\nwith a black disc on it : but the process of working through cards\nlike this would be much slower and more tedious than working\nwith a machine and would yield a smaller number of trials, so that it\ndoes not seem to be worth while, if one has the easier method to\nwork with.\nThe Electrical Apparatus\nGeneral Description\nThe Pointer Apparatus was an experiment, obviously capable of\nimprovement in many respects. Some arrangement was needed\nwhich would differentiate between Telepathy and Clairvoyance and\nwould select the order of events mechanically. An electric signal,\nfor opening the boxes, which would give an invariable sound, was\nalso needed ;\nand an automatic recorder which would work at any\nreasonable speed and be fraud-proof at the same time, was badly\nneeded. A high speed of working was required, both to meet the\nobvious psychological demand for it and also to avoid tedium, which\ncertainly militates against success, by inculcating a dislike which is\nalways the father of a resistance. The more automatic the machine\nbecomes the more both operator and subject are freed from the\nnecessity of giving attention to the purely routine part of the experi-\nments ;\nand, in point of fact, the speed and ease of working through\n100 trials with this electrical apparatus in a few seconds is a revelation\nof how simple an exjieriment in E.S.P. can be. Also, with the mach-\nine, hundreds of trials can be accumulated rapidly and easily ;\nand\nthe importance of this will be appreciated when it is realised how\nslow is the process by which a new condition is accepted Ijy the\nsublhninal of the subject. The tedium of going through all this with\na pack of cards might well postpone acceptance of the new condition\nindefinitely.\nThe Pointer Apparatus had embodied at least four improvements\nover the method of using cards, viz. speed, rhythm, the ])resentation\nof the event as a simple contrast instead of in the comjdicated form\n\f120 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nof a diagram, and the externalisatioii of the paranormal knowledge\nby motor action instead of Ijy speech.\nThe new apparatus, now to be described, embodied these further\nfeatures : (1) An automatic Recorder marking successes and failures,\nbut not recording each lamp lit and each box opened. (2) Electric\nlamps as the events inside the boxes, with provision for changing\nthese for other pieces of apparatus if desirable. (3) An electric signal\nfrom operator to percipient. (4) A mechanical Selector for selecting\nthe lani])-circuits in a purely chance order. (5) An alternative\narrangement of five silent Keys by which the operator can himself\nselect the lamp-circuits. (6) A Commutator which could transpose\nthe connexions between the Keys and the Lamps in various orders,\nwhich can be either known or unknown to the operator. (7) A\nDelay-action Relay, for selecting the lamp to be lit beforehand, but\npost2\n)oning the actual lighting until a box is opened. (8) Arrange-\nments of switches by means of which any desired condition can be\ninstantly brought into play. These features were not all embodied\nin the aj)])aratus as it was at first constructed ;\nsome of them were\nadded from time to time as ex2\nrerience suggested them.\nTechnical DescpvTption of Electrical Apparatus\n(Tlie references are to Diagram A)\nPercvjhent\u2019 s Table. This measures 30\" by 17\" and sujijiorts the\nBox Unit and Screen. It is divided longitiulinally underneath by a\nscreen of Essex board reaching from the underneath of the top to\nthe floor and coming round on either side so that the percipient\u2019s\nlegs are in a sort of bay.\nThe Box Unit. The five boxes are of mahogany and measure 1^\"\nin width with spacings of |\" between them. The lids slope down-\nwards towards the jiercipient and overhang the boxes in front so\nthat they can be raised by lifting with a jiadded stick. They are\nheld down by springs of rubber bands, one on either side, passing\nover jjrojections in the sides of the lids, which form cranks. The\nj)ressure is therefore strongest when the lids are closed and weakens\nas they are ojiened. The lids are rabetted and faced with fine velvet\nwhere they make contact with the box, and an undercut flange\n])rojects into a space under the hinge, thus rendering the lid light-\ntight.\nArranged on a shelf above and behind the boxes is a double row of\nelectric contacts (Cl-ClO) so adjusted as to be opened by an arm\njirojecting backwards from the side of the lid when the latter is\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 121\nclosed. Wlieii the front of the lid is raised as much as these\ncontacts automatically close. One of them for each box brings in the\nTrial Recorder (TR) which registers the trial by making a short dash\non a moving strip of paper tape, while the other causes a relay to\nclose, which renders possible the recording of a success if the right\nlid has been raised, l)Tit not otherwise. The five boxes are open at the\nback to allow of the introduction of small carriages which contain\nthe electric lamps. Each is secured in position by the turning of a\nbutton, and when each is pushed home the lamp is automatically\nbrought into circuit.\nThe Screen. A screen of 3-ply wood 30\" square fits into grooves in\nthe sides of the apparatus and comes down to the table on either side\nand so divides the entire table longitudinally into two halves. The\ntop of the screen is then 5 feet above the floor and the percipient\ncan see nothing of what is going on on the other side of the table.\nAnd, as has been said, the screen is continued under the table to the\nfloor and is also brought round to the sides. The percipient\u2019s table\nis connected to the operator\u2019s table by flexible wires 23 feet long, and\ncan thus be moved about the room.\nThe Operator s Table. This contains most of the apparatus.\nThe Relay Switches (Rl-RlO). There are ten of these relays of the\n1000 ohm P.O. type operating on a current of from 5 nia. upwards,\nand the object of them is to enable successes to record themselves\nautomatically. Five of these are connected, one each, in circuit\nwith the box-lid contacts ;\nand five are connected, one each, in\ncircuit with the lamps in the boxes. The contacts of these relays\nare connected in pairs in series, one box-lid relay and one lain})\nrelay from the same box, making a pair. This gives the arrangement\nthat when a pair are closed together, the Success Recorder (SR)\nis brought into action, and a second dash is made on the tape parallel\nwith the dash recording the trial. A double dash thus indicates a\nsuccess. The arrangement will be understood at once by reference\nto Diagram A.\nSince one relay is in circuit with each lam}), it is necessary that\nthere should be no distinctive sounds from them which might betray\nto the percipient which lamp is alight. The relays are carefully\nsilenced with rubber and are placed in a stout oak case faced with\nvelvet where it is pressed against the table.\nThe Multiple Cut-out (MC). This is a device to render it impossible\nfor the percipient to score a success by raising more than one box-lid\nat a time. The possibihty of opening one box for a preliminary peep\nis secured against by the early closing of the Trial Recorder circuit\nwhich records the trial before the })erci})ient can see into the box.\n\f122 C). N. M. TyrreM : Fmiker Research [part\nl>ut, unless sonie (h'vice were j)i'ovi(l(\u2018(l to jtrevent it, it would he\npossible to secure a success hy ojjening some or all of the boxes\ntogether. The Multijtlc Cut-out consists of a relay with five wind-\nings on one core, and it is jROvided with a break instead of a make\ncontact. One of these windings is included in circuit with each of\nthe percipient\u2019s relays, and the tensions are so adjusted that the\ncurrent passing through one winding is insufficient to work the relay,\nwhile the current ])assijig through two or more windings is sufficient\nto work it. Thus, if two or more box-lids are opened, the relay works\nand breaks the circuit of the Success Recorder, thus rendering the\nrecording of a success impossible. The Trial Recorder works as\nusual and records a failure.\nThe Recorders. \u2019These are made l.)y aflapting a machine known\nin the Post Office as a \u201c Morse Iid<er.\u201d This machine drives by\nclockwork a stri)) of ])aper wide and there is an electro-magnet,\nwhich, when energised, Itrings an ink-wheel into contact with the\n]>a])er and marks a dash on it. This machine has been adpated to\ncomprise two iidc-wheels side by side marking on the same strip\nof paj)er, each o])erated by its own inde])endent electro-magnet.\nOne of these is the \u2019Ihial Recorder, which makes a mark each time\nany box-lid is lifted ;\nthe other is the Success Recorder, which makes\na second mark ]jarallel to the trial mark each time any box is opened\nwhich has a lamp alight inside it.\nThe Keys. Five Keys are arranged in a row so that the pressing of\nany key lights a lamj) in one of the boxes. Each key makes contact\nwith a globule of mercury contained in a lu'ass cup, which renders it\nsilent.\nThe Covmintaior. The wires from the keys do not jjass directly\nto the lamps but ])ass first through a Cojinnutator. This is, in effect,\na rotary switch ca]>able of transporting or mixing up the five con-\nnexions in various ways. The five wires from the keys can, by its\nmeans, be joined to the five lamps in ten different ways, seven of\nwhich transpose the connexions in various orders, while the re-\nmaining three join them to the lamps in a straightforward order of\none to one, two to two and so on. This Commutator switch is driven\nby an electi'ic ratchet mechanism. It is iii fact a \u201c Rntary Line\n\u201d\nswitch as used by the Post Office in automatic tele])hone exchanges,\nand the ]>rcssing of a button causes it to rotate and come to rest in one\nof the ten ])Ositions. The switch is enclosed in a box, which has a\ndoor fac.ing the o])crator, so that when the door is shut and the button\nis pressed, the switch comes to rest in a position which is unknown,\nto the oj)erator. After that, the operator, as he presses each key,\ndocs not know which lamp he is lighting. As the switch rotates\n\f147 ] in ExiraSensnry Perceplinii i2;{\nnipidly ;uid ilu* huM-nii is usually ]uvss(m 1 or Four Fiiiics Mu'i'o\nis uo ])ossil)ility of the opera-tor\u2019s j^iiessiiip; where', il, ma,y c.ouue to I'est.\nThe tieledor. lii addition to the live keys then', is a inecluudeal\nSelector, consistitig of a rotating switch of the sanie kind a,s that iise'd\nfor the Commutator ;\nbut in this only a single arm opera, tes a,nd\nselects one out of the five laitip circuits.

VV'hen one arm has sw(;pt\nover the semi-circle of contacts the dianietrically opposite arm\ntakes over and follows it. The arm is driv(',n by a,ti e.lectro-magmd-ic,\nand ratchet device and the 25 contacts are grouped in 5 groups of 5\neach. In each grouj) the wires from the five lamps arc conneeb'd to\nthe contacts in a different order, the (;orres[)onding numbers of\neach group are then connected together. Hence, the Selecdor, whe-n\nworked, stops with one of the five la,mp-circuits selectc.d and c,on-\nnected U]>, the choice l)eing purely a random one. The k(!y working\nthe Selector is so arranged that when it is pressed, the breaking of\nthe back contact stoj)s the Selector and thereby selects a circuit,\nand then the making of the front contact of the la^y completes tlui\ncommon part of the lamp-circuits. Thus no current passes through\nthe Selector while it is moving.\nThe Selector is rendered silent by (uicaseinent in thre(! boxes filled\nwith wra])pings of various sound-cleadening matc'rials, and is [)la,C('d\nin a gallery at the far end of the room, 20 fe.et from the opera,tor\u2019s\ntable.

Since working is done at high speed,\nit is essential that the operator should have some method of keeping-\nin ste]) with the percipient. He must be able to know that he is\n]\u00bbressing his key at the same time that a box-lid is open, otherwise\nno successes can be recorded. A small lamp is therefore placed in\nfront of the oj^erator, and is lit up by the Trial Recorder each time\na box-lid is opened. The operator has only to watch the synchron-\nising lamp and press his key when it is alight.\nSounder (S) and Counter (C). As he presses the key with his right\nhand, the operator raises a small lever witli his left, which performs\ntwo actions sinndtaneously, (a) it closes the circuit which causes\nthe Sounder to give a click under the percipient\u2019s table, and (h) it\nmoves on a Counter on which it records each trial and tells the operator\nwhen he has reached 100. This also avoids the necessity for having\nto count the total numl)er of trials on the tape.\nOperators Screen. The operator\u2019s table is situated in the corner\nof the room, so that one wall is behind him and another on his right\nhand, where the end of his table shuts against the wall. The back of\nthe table and its outer end are surrounded by a wooden screen,\nreaching to the floor and standing 5 feet above it. There is only a\nspace 30\" wide left for the operator to get in and out of the corner in\nwhich he works. Thus, nothing whatever can be seen of the operator\nor his table or any of his apparatus from any part of the room where\nthe percipient\u2019s table is placed. And, in addition, there is the screen\nalready described on the percipient\u2019s table itself.\nReliability of the Apparatus. One question which naturally\n])resents itself is this. Could the failure of any j)art of the machine\nto act properly give a falsely high score ? The most hkely thing to\nhappen is for the operator to get out of step with the percipient\nwhen the experiment goes fast. The effect of this will be to shorten\nthe time during which a key is f)ressed and a Ijox is opened simul-\ntaneously. This shortens the length of the dash indicating a success.\nIf there is no common time at all during which a key is j>ressed and a\nbox opened together, a success becomes impossible, and only the\ndash of the Trial Recorder appears. Thus successes may be lost by\ngetting out of time, but they cannot be gained.\nFailure of the box-lid contacts to open when the hds are closed\nresults in a continuous line being drawn on the ta])e, giving no separa-\ntion of trials and therefore no series of experiments. Their failure to\nclose when the lids are opened gives blank spaces on the tape, so that\nit simply results in no trials at all being recorded.\n\f147]\nin Extra-Sensory Percej)tion 125\nThe only way in which nnearned successes could be recorded would\nbe if the Relays stuck in the closed position, faihng to release when\nthe current was off. This, as a matter of fact, has never happened,\nbut a simple and rapid test can always be applied to show whether\nthey are working properly. This test is frequently carried out and is\nalways applied after any strikingly good result has been obtained.\nIt has been found that any fault shows itself immediately on the tape\nrecord.\nTypes of Experiment which are Possible with\nTHE Apparatus\n(1) The Selector. This renders it possible to do experiments in\nwhich the events on one side are certainly distributed according to a\npurely chance arrangement. Since the wires from the Selector to\nthe lamps pass through the Commutator, they are further re-\narranged there, but this makes no difference.\n(2) The Keys. These may lie used to give several different\nconditions.\n(i) They may be connected to the lamps in a straight one to one\norder. This arrangement divides into three sub-sections : (a) where\nthe arrangement is known to the subject and to the operator ;\n(6) where it is known to the operator only ;\n(c) where it is known\nneither to operator or subject.\n(ii) Key connexions transposed by the Commutator. This can\nalso be subdivided into (a), (6) and (c). And, in addition, it is possible\nfor all these to apply either to the case in which the mere fact that\nthere is a transposition is known ;\nor to the case in which the actual\norder of the transposition is known also.\n(in) It is possible, with the keys, for the operator either to select\neach trial at random or to take the trials from a list of mechanically\nselected numbers taken beforehand.\nAny case in which the operator knows the order in which the keys\nare connected to the lamps allows of the possibility of telepathy as\nwell as of clairvoyance. Any case in which he does not know this\nrules out the possibility of telepathy, and leaves only that of clair-\nvoyance, or possibly of precognition.\n(iv) It is also possible to use any of the above arrangements in\nconjunction with the Delay-action Relay.\n(v) It is possible to test for precognition by getting the percipient\nto open the box at each trial before the lamji-circuit has been selected\nby the operator when keys are being used, or by the mechanical\nSelector.\n\f126 G. N. M. Tyrrell: Further Research [part\nSome Possible Criticisms of the Apparatus\nThe more obvious points of criticism are dealt with here :\nKnowledge by Normal Means\n(i) Visual. Until 16th November 1935, the keys were on the\npercipient\u2019s table behind the screen. Nothing could be seen of them\nunless the percipient got up and peeped round the edge of the screen,\nwhich she could not do from her seat ;\nand this would stop the experi-\nment in a very olivious way. Even this would be no help when the\nCommutator was in use. It must be remembered that the opening\nof each box is accompanied by the click of the Recorder and that even\na slight hesitation in this rhythmical sound is noticeable.\nThe Recorder is on the operator\u2019s table, and even if it were visible,\nwould give no help to the percipient. Actually, the record is made\nunder a roller and no trial is visible until it has emerged over the\nroller about two trials later.\nWhen the keys were removed to the ojierator\u2019s table, the latter\nwas surrounded by a high screen.\nThere is a board of resistance-lamps for working the apparatus off\nthe mains, and the hght of these lamps fluctuates each time a key\nis pressed. The fluctuation is exactly the same so far as can be\ndetected whatever key is used, but, on the advice of Professor\nAdrian, a metal screen was placed over this board in the beginning\nof January 1936.\n(ii) Auditory. The sound of the relays in the operator\u2019s circuits,\nif the percipient could hear them and could distinguish the sound of\neach, would give an indication of which lamp was alight. The\nCommutator would not help to do away with this, as each of these\nrelays has to be connected to its own particular lamp. These relays,\nas has been said, were carefully silenced so as to be practically\ninaudible with the cover removed and with the ear close to them,\nand absolutely silent with the cover on. The percipient would have\nto hear them when seated at a separate talile from three to nine feet\naway, with the thick case over the relays and screen between as\nwell. But what is even more important is that nearly all work with\nthis apparatus is done at high speed, that is to say from 60 to 80\ntrials a minute, when it is impossible to avoid working in a rhythm.\nThis means, that whether it is intentional or not, one finds that one\nis jiressing the key in synchronism with the raising of the Sounder-\nlever and the percipient also opens the box synchronously with the\nclick of the Sounder. The result is that the action of the operator\u2019s\nrelays occurs simultaneously wdth loud sound of the Recorder, and\neven if they made a slight sound, this would be drowned by the\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 127\nTrial Recorder. In none of those cases in which the key has been\ndeliberately pressed some time before the opening of the box has\nthere been any increase in the rate of scoring, which should have\nbeen the case if the sound of the operator\u2019s relays, whether perceived\nhyperaesthetically or normally, had been the cause of scoring.\nThere is also the important effect of the Delay-action Relay, which\nentirely prevents any possibility of this sort and to which I shall\nrefer presently.\nThe sound of the keys themselves has been eliminated by j)ro-\nviding them with mercury contacts. It has been suggested that the\nvery small spark which takes place on the mercury surface might be\nheard by the percipient ;\nbut, from the percipient\u2019s table this is\ncertainly impossible. And these again, in normal working, are\ndrowned by the noise of the Recorder. Also there is not the slightest\nreason to suppose that the sound of the sparks differ from one\nanother, or that if they do, the difference is constant. And in any\ncase, the Commutator would do away with any possible hel|) these\nmight be imagined to give.\nUnconscious whispering. This would have to be very loud to\novercome the noise of the Recorder and extremely rapid, and ob-\nservers cmdd scarcely fail to have noticed it. Also the Commutator\nagain would render it useless.\n(hi) Tactual. Until the keys were moved to the operator\u2019s table,\noperator and percipient shared the same table, sitting one on each\nside of the screen. Their legs might therefore come into contact\nand a critic might say that information could be conveyed by touch,\nthough this could scarcely be unconscious. Therefore on 1st Sep-\ntember 1935 a complete screen was provided as above described.\nHyperaesthesia\nThe foregoing arguments which apply to the acquisition of know-\nledge by normal sight and hearing apply also to hyperaesthesic\nsight and hearing. Hyperaesthesia does not help to distinguish a\nfaint sound which is covered by a louder one. The only sense which\nmight be alleged to be helped by hyperaesthesia is the visual one.\nIf there were any escape of light past the lids of the boxes, this would\nof course be a guide to the percipient. Or it might be said that the\nlamp which was alight made the box shghtly warmer, and that the\ntemperature-sense was a guide. But, as has been said, the opening\nof the box and the lighting of the lamp are practically simultaneous.\nIn any case, the lamp is alight only for a fraction of a second, and it\nmay be mentioned that the lamps are not lit to their full brightness.\nSuppose that the heat of the lamp were to pass through the bulb and\n\f128 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nbegin to warm the lid of the box, it would probably not have its\neffect until the trial was over and the next lamp was alight, since it\ntakes time for anything to get warm ;\nand then it would simply be\nmisleading.\nIt might be suggested that some unknown form of radiation from\nthe lamp passes through the wood of the box and alfects some un-\nknown sense-organ of the percipient in some unknown way. It is\nof interest in this connexion to observe that highly significant scores\nhave been obtained when the boxes were opened well in advance of\nthe lighting of the lamps (see No. 134, Table XXIV).\nBut in any case the Delay-action Relay sweeps away these objec-\ntions at one blow\u2019. As liefore stated, this device delays the lighting\nof the lain]), after it has been selected, until after the box-lid has been\nopened, so that w\u2019hen the ])ercipient selects the box, the lamp is not\nyet alight. It is, in fact, the percipient\u2019s own action which lights it.\nYet, so far as the percipient can see, there is no difference whether\nthe delay-action is in operation or not.\nTo return now for a moment to the possibility of help from the\nsounds of the operator\u2019s relays dealt with above, the delay-action\nalso does away with this objection, since these relays are actuated\nw'hen the lamps are lit, viz. after the box-lid is opened. The results\nin Table XXII show about equal success wdth the delay-action and\nwithout it ;\nso that all these criticisms are swept away together.\nTo sum up. The Commutator and the Delay-action Relay to-\ngether eliminate the following possible criticisms. All sensory aid\nfrom parts of the apparatus, whether hyperaesthesia be present or\nnot. All sensory indications wdiicli could be given by the operator,\nsuch as unconscious w\u2019hispering, etc.\nFraud\nThe percipient has no opportunity to score by any fraudulent\nmeans. The operator is surrounded in front and on one side by a\nscreen 5 feet high and by the walls of the room on the other two\nsides, except for a narrow space about 30\" wide by the wall. This\nscreen entirely intervenes between the twm tables. In order to see\nanything of the operator or the contents of his table the percipient\nwould have to get up and leave her table and ])cer over the screen\nwithout causing a hitch in trials going at the rate of 70 a minute.\nThis source of fraud is therefore absurd. And further, even if the\n])ercipient could see the operator\u2019s table, she would as a rule get no\nuseful information from it.\nThe percipient cannot peep into the boxes beforehand because as\nsoon as the lid of a box is raised even a small fraction of an inch\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 129\na trial has been recorded. Nor can she score successes by raising\nmore than one box-lid at a time for this cuts out the Success Recorder\nand registers a failure. If any box fails to close completely, the\nTrial Recorder remains in action and draws a continuous line on the\ntape and thus automatically wipes out the experiments. The per-\ncipient is therefore powerless to do anything except carry out the\nexperiment in the legitimate way.\nChance in Connexion with the Apparatus\nThe next question to be considered is how chance affects the a]!-\nparatus which I am now describing\u2014whether there is anything in\nthe course of the experiments which is likely to alter the assumed\nprobability of success and, if so, in what way and to what degree.\nIn the Electrical Apparatus, with which we are now deahng, there\nare ten events ;\nfive of which are the lighting of lamps by the operator,\nand five the opening of boxes by the percipient. Let the lamps and\nthe boxes be numbered from left to right, as seen by the percipient,\nfrom 1 to 5. Then let p.^, Ps be the respective probabilities\nof the lamps being lit, and 5'^, q^, q^, q^, q^ be the respective probabili-\nties of the boxes being opened in any particular trial, the sum of the\np\u2019s being unity and the sum of the q\u2019s being unity.\nAVe are not concerned with the different ways in which these\nevents can distribute themselves in any block of trials, but only\nwith the coincidences between lit lamps and ojiened boxes. The\nprobability of there being a coincidence between a lit lamp and an\nopened box is the product of the separate probabilities of each event\noccurring. For instance, the probability that No. 1 box will be\nopened while No. 1 lamp is alight is pyq^, and so on with the other\nlamps and boxes. But what we are particularly interested in for\nour purpose is the probability of there being a coincidence some-\nwhere along the line between a lit lamp and an opened box in any\nparticular trial. This probability is given liy the sum of the proba-\nbilities of the particular coincidences. It is the Probability of\nSuccess. Let us call it p.\nThen, p = {\np^q-,\n+ mq.^ +pyq^ + p,q ^ + p.\nq .),\nwhich is true generally, whatever values the p\u2019s and q\u2019s may have.\nLet us first suppose that the lighting of the lam^is and the opening\nof the boxes is so distributed that there is no favouritism on either\nside, so that any lamp is equally likely to 1 ie lit and any Ijox is\nequally likely to be opened at any particular trial. That will mean\nthat the probability that any lamp will be lit and that any box will\n\f130 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nbe opened is 1\/5 ;\nand the probahility that any lamp will fail to be\nlit or any l)ox fail to be opened is 4\/5. But this raises a curious point\nwhich has some practical importance. What is meant by saying\nthat any one of five events is \u201c equally likely to happen \u201d ? It is\ncertainly a point open to discussion ;\nand it may be that there are\ntwo distinct meanings to the phrase, one of which is relative to\nknowledge while the other refers to objective fact. At any rate, the\nlatter meaning is the one we are now concerned with. That any one\nof five events is equally likely to happen means, in this sense, that if\nthe trials are continued, the tendency is indefinitely towards the\noccurrence of each of the five events an equal number of times, that\nis, one-fifth of the total, in the long run. It is these words, \u201c in the\nlong run \u201d which are important, and we shall have to return to the\n])oint later.\nThe condition of \u201c ecpial likelihood \u201d on both sides, which we have\nassumed, means that,\nIh =]h=Ih=]h=Ih = R = fh = % = <h = To\n= 1\n\/\n5 ,\nso that the probability of a success in any one particular box is 1\/25.\nAnd the Probability of Success,\n^j = (l\/5)2 + (1\/5)2 + (1\/5)2+ (1\/5)2 + (1\/5)2 = 5\/25 = 1\/5.\nThe first thing to be noted about this formula is that, so long as\neach of the five events is equally likely to ha])pen on one side, it does\nnot make any difference to the probability of success what the dis-\ntribution of events is on the other side ;\nthe probability ofisuccess still\nremains 1 \/5. Tins could be proved generally, but it will be sufficient\nto illustrate it by taking an extreme example. Suppose that on one\nside the events are distributed in a chance order (say the lighting of\nthe lamps), while on the other one box (say No. 1) is opened every\ntime, while the others are neglected.\nThen, each of the ps = 1\/5 ;\n= 1 ; T=T= (]i = T = ih\np = (l\/5+l + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = l\/5.\nEven in this extreme case the 2\n)robability of success is not altered.\nIn order that it shall be altered, both sides must depart from the\nchance distribution of events. Even then, it does not follow that the\nprobability of success will be raised ; in fact, it is more likely that it\nwill be lowered.\nIf we know what frequency preferences there are in the operator\u2019s\nand ])ercipient\u2019s habits, l)y checking each box opened and each key\njiresscd, we can calculate froin the above formula what effect these\nwill have on the prol)al)ility of success. In an actual case in which\nthis has been done, the following is the result. Graph III, Nos. I\n\f147 ] in Extra-Sensory Perception 131\nand II, sliows a record of 100 trials in which G.N.M.T. was the\noperator, using the keys, and L.H. was the percipient. This block\nof trials was checked completely from both the operator\u2019s and the\npercipient\u2019s ends, and No. 1 shows by the dots each key which was\npressed in turn and No. 2 shows by the dots each box which was\nopened in turn. The successful trials are shown by rings round the\ndots. The frequencies are shown by the total figures at the bottom\nof each table ;\nand they indicate a slight tendency to favour the\nmiddle number (No. 3) on the part of both the operator and the\npercipient. Inserting these frequencies in the above formula will\nshow what effect this favouritism has on the prolmbility of success.\nE-\n17 20 25 20 18\n100\nCO\nII\nO\n^^'\u2018\u201c100\n15 18 24 22 21\n'^^\u201c100 '^^\u201cloo ^\u201c\u201c100 '^^\u201c100\n_ ^255 360 600 440 378\nP~ \\ Ta4 + 2^Q4 + p)4 + ](04 + 1 ni\n10^\n2033\n~l\u00a5'\n101\n:0-2033.\nThis is a departure from the assumed value of 0-2 or 1\/5 which is\nquite unimportant.\nGraph III, No. IV shows a case in which G.J. was the percipient.\nIt does not pair with No. Ill, which is a record taken independently\nfrom the mechanical selector, Imt with another talde in which\nG.N.M.T. was the ojierator which is not shown in the graph, but in\nwhich the frequency totals were 23, 23, 23, 18, 13. The probability\nof success, when worked out by the same formula, comes to 0T995,\nshowing, instead of a rise owing to the human departure from random\nchoice, a slight Init quite insignificant fall. Such frequency pre-\nferences as actually occur are such as to cause only quite negligilde\ndeviations from the assumed 1\/5 value for the probability of success.\nIndeed, frequency preferences in order to make an important differ-\nence would have to be glaringly obvious. If both the operator and\nthe percipient chose one number fifty times out of a hundred, the\nodds are four to one against their choosing the same number. If\nthey chose different numbers, distributing their choices as evenly as\npossible over the other four, the result would l)e actually to reduce\nthe probability of success from 0-2 to 0-1719. Only if they chose the\nsame number would the prol)ability of success be raised. It would\nbe raised to 0-3126 ;\nand it is interesting to note that this would be\nH\n\f132 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\njust about the value it would have to have in order to account for\nthe successes with the Pointer Apparatus by frequency preferences.\nAnd no one who has used the apparatus could suggest that this kind\nof preference on both sides could pass unnoticed.\nNumber Sequence-Habits. There might be no particular frequency\npreferences on either side and yet there might be sequence number-\nhabits. Both sides, for instance, might constantly use the order\n3, 2, 1, 4 or some such order of sequence.\nHere again, such a habit would make no difference if it were only\non one side ;\nand again, also, it would make no difference on both\nsides unless the sequences coincided. It could only be effective on\nthose occasions on which there was a success with a 3. Again, to\nthink of an exaggerated case as an illustration, suppose both sides\nwent continually from one end of the row to the other, they could\neasily miss each other altogether by being out of step. Only if they\ncoincided when going in the same direction would they score 100%\nsuccesses. With any sequence-habits, in order to alter the prob-\nability of success, (1) operator and subject must have identical\nhabits, and (2) the sequences of both must start together from a\nsuccess. So that it will be realised how easy it is to exaggerate the\nimportance of number-habits by talking about them loosely.\nAnother important point about sequence habits is that the Com-\nmutator would break them up. If we take, for instance, the straight\nsequence 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, this would be transformed by the Com-\nmutator into 3, 5, 2, 1, 4 ; 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, and so on in seven ways, so\nthat, if the percipient did manage to coincide with a habit of the\noperator\u2019s, the Commutator would render this habit worse than\nuseless ;\nand if sequence number-habits had been the cause of\nscoring, the Commutator should have brought the scores down to\nchance values. Hence, neither frequency nor sequence number-\nhabits will account for the rates of scoring actually attained.\nThose who have been good enough to give me valued criticism\nand advice have urged that the recorfling mechanism of the apparatus\nought to have been constructed so as to record each box opened and\neach lamp lit. With this criticism I am in agreement up to a point.\nThat is to say, I agree that it is necessary to have a representative\nselection of blocks of trials recorded in this way, Imt I do not think\nthat it would be either necessary or convenient to have all experi-\nments so recorded. The wealth of detail woidd be cumbersome as\nthe records ran into hundreds. And if only a few are required they\ncan be ol)tained by getting two recorders to check by hand. But un-\ndoubtedly automatic checking is better, and the ideal arrangement\nwould be to have both kinds of recorder and to use either at will.\n\f147] in Extra-Sensory Perception 133\nThe reason why a complete recorder of this kind was not provided\nfrom the beginning is that the electrical apparatus, like, 1 suppose,\nmost pioneer apphances, was a patchwork growth rather than a\ncomplete plan. And in the beginning, a mechanism for registering\nevery trial would have been more elaborate and expensive than the\ndual recorder actually used, and more difficult to install. There were\ntoo many mechanical problems to be dealt with at first for more to\nseem desirable. And later, when the need for the complete recorder\nbecame clearer, it seemed an unwise policy to ask the percipients to\nstand aside while the apparatus was dismantled for the considerable\ntime which would have been necessary to get a new piece of apparatus\nto work satisfactorily.\nChance in Connexion with the Experiments\nIn the kind of experimental work which is here being dealt with,\nthe estimation of the probability that any result is due to chance is\nfraught with special difficulties, and it is no easy matter to present\nthese probabilities in any satisfactorily clear and logical fashion.\nBut there is on the other hand a compensating fact, for the anti-\nchance figures in most cases turn out to be so large as to render the\ntheoretical difficulties formal rather than practical, and to leave an\ninvestigator who is in touch with the phenomena in no doubt as to\nthe verdict. As an example of the kind of difficulty which arises, we\nmay consider how to deal with the results of an experiment which has\nbeen done on one particular day. It may be that these results show\nsignificance when dealt with alone ;\nbut the difficulty is that if we\ndeal with this day\u2019s results alone they may be regarded as a selection\ntaken from a series which ought to have included the results ob-\ntained on other days as well. The only fair way to deal with these\nresults, according to this argument, would be to take the chance-\nprobability figure for the results of all the days together. Then, if\nthe results on the other days had been blank or poor, it might quite\npossibly be found that the day which showed significant results\nwhen considered alone, would have to be regarded as a freak of\nchance which could occur in the larger total, showing in itself no\nsignificance on the whole. In the same way, a man who, while on his\nway to visit a friend, stepped into the very \u2019bus in which that friend\nwas travelhng, might think at first that some special influence had\ncaused the meeting ;\nbut when he considered the large number of\noccasions on which such a coincidence might have happened Imt\ndid not, he would see that it could well be accounted for by\nchance.\n\f134 6r. N. J\\I. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nThere is tliiis in the estimation of chance the principle which makes\nit necessary to deal with the relevant whole : but the difficult\nquestion in practice is to decide what the relevant whole is. If the\nmethod of estimation deals with too narrow a basis, it runs the risk of\ntaking results to be significant which are really due to chance : but\nif it deals with too wide a basis, it runs the risk of confusing the issue\nwith figures which are meaningless.\nIt is necessary to divide the experiments into groups, each group\nconsisting of results obtained under the same conditions, and to\ncalculate the chance-probability figure for each group. But it is\nobvious that the different grouj)S must be kept apart and not in-\ncluded together in the same total, otherwise the chance-probability\nfigure will have no intelligible meaning. For example, one group of\nexjieriinents may have been done under condition A while another\ngroup has been done under condition B ;\nand it may be that A was a\ncondition which permitted the phenomenon to occur, while B was a\ncondition which prevented it from occurring. Clearly a probability\nfigure for A and B combined will not l)e illuminating. The difficulty\nwhich occurs in practice is that of being sure that, in dealing with\nwhat a]\u2018)pears to Ijc a grouj), we are not in reality dealing with a\ncomposite group containing more than one set of conditions. There\nis a difficulty in this subject which does not occur in physics, for the\nrelevant conditions are not only physical and external ;\nthey are also\npsychological and internal to the subject ;\nand, of the two sets of\nconditions, the psychological ones are ])robably the most important.\nBut as these lie to a great extent beyond the operator\u2019s control, they\nmust perforce l)e ignored for the purpose of probability calculations.\nThat conditions exist within the subject which profoundly influence\nthe results, is shown by the fluctuations in the rate of scoring which\noccur when the external conditions are kept the same. And even\nwhen dealing with the external conditions alone there are apt to be\nminor sub-divisions which have to be discounted to avoid undue\ncomplication.\nThe ])rinciple which is hero adopted is to regard as a group all\nexperiments which have been done under the same general external\nconditions and to take the temporal limits of such groups as coin-\nciding with the period under review. (See Table XXV.)\nThese considerations lead to the conclusion that chance-prob-\nal)ility figures should only l>e used to indicate the odds against the\nresults of certain groups of experiments being due to chance in a way\nwhich may l)e called \u201c by and large.\u201d It is, moreover, dangerous to\njuoceed to induction and to correlate the anti-chance figures with\nthe experimental conditions in such a way. as to infer causal relation-\n\f147 ]\nin Extm-Sensory Perception 135\nships ;\nand it is dangerous to lay stress on anti-chance figures which\nare near the point of significance. It is necessary to use coniinon\nsense, and above all to take into account the guiding indications\nwhich arise from contact with the subject.\nBut it is not a case of dealing merely with the chance-probabilities\nof group totals ;\nfor a striking feature of these experiments is not\nthe totals themselves only, but also the manner in which the totals\narise. To illustrate this, tables have been given showing the com-\nparative rates of scoring belonging to two different sets of experi-\nmental conditions carried on simultaneously, but not extending to\nthe full temporal scope of the groups. The comparisons are made,\nas a rule, by giving not the chance-probability figures, but the\npercentage rates of scoring ;\nbut sometimes, when they seemed to be\nof interest, probability figures have been given for series of experi-\nments which are less than an entire group (as in Table XV). The\nreader, if he distrusts these, may compare them with the figures for\nthe grouj)-totals in Table XXV.\nExperimental Results with the Electrical Apparatus\nAs soon as this apparatus was sufficiently complete, experiments\nwere begun with it, a mechanical Selector being used instead of\nthe method by which the operator selected the events by his own\nchoice. The Selector first tried was impartial as amongst the five\nlamp circuits, but it was noisy and unrehable in its working and had\nthe effect of putting the subject off to such an extent that she soon\nfelt a strong dishke for it. She also said that it felt \u201c mechanical\n\u201d\nand had not the \u201c human feeling \u201d which the Pointer Apparatus had.\nThe subject\u2019s table, also, was some 12 feet from the operator\u2019s and this\ngave her a strange and lonely feeling. These things, perhaps, sound\nchildish ;\nbut the fact is that the state in which the scoring is done is\neasily influenced by feelings ofthis kind and they have to be recognised.\nA set of experiments was carried out with this early form of\nSelector between 13th May and 1st June 1935, but without any\npositive results. As an additional drawback, the subject suffered\nfrom an influenza cold for ten days of this period. The results were\nas follow :\nTable VI\nSubject G.J. Operator G.N.M.T.

Tyrrell.\nIntroduction of Keys\nSince the Selector had so far been a failure, it was decided to\nre-introduce the human element by providing the operator with five\nKeys for lighting the lamps in the boxes, so as to return as nearly\nas might l)e to the conditions of the Pointer Apparatus. The only\ndifference now from the latter would be that the operator pressed a\nkey which he chose at random instead of putting a pointer into a\nbox ;\nand the ])erci])ient would see the lamp alight inside the box\ninstead of seeing the pointer. The Keys, as has already been said,\nhad been rendered silent by the provision of mercury contacts.\nThe subject\u2019s table was l)rought near the operator\u2019s to help to\nrestore the feeling of \u201c human confidence,\u201d which the subliminal\nseemed to demand, being so placed that the screen on it, 30 inches\nsquare, hid the operator and his table completely from the per-\ncipient. The screening was c[uite satisfactory, but it should be noted\nthat it was afterwards marie doubly effective by providing a screen\nround the operator\u2019s table as w^ell. At this time, before the seconrl\nscreen was added, the op])ortunity (if opportunity it can be called)\nof getting normal information from the operator\u2019s table was at its\nbest, but all the results were failures.\nTable VII\n3rd to 1th June, 1935\nNo. T S d % Conditions\n72 1305 276 -fl5 21d Keys and Lamps.\nThis is entirely a chance result, yet the conditions differ from those\nwith the Pointer oidy in the fact that the operator does not know\nwhat boxes the percipient is opening. It might be said that this\nsuj)])orts the hypothesis that, with the Pointer Apj)aratus, the\nojierator had Ireen watching the ])ercipient\u2019s habits of oj)ening boxes\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 137\nand had fallen in with them, either consciously or unconsciously.\nBut the sequel negatives this.\nReversion to the Pointer\nAs the Keys and Lamps had failed, I resolved to go back to the\nbeginning again and use the Pointer. The original Pointer Apparatus\nnot being available, as it was being used elsewhere, I took the lamps\nout of the boxes and muffled a pencil by wrapping a piece of flannel\nround it, and used it as a pointer. It was not quite so silent as the\noriginal pointer as the boxes were not padded, but it was moderately so.\nThe subject, after a brief holiday, came back and realised this as\nthe old Pointer Apparatus again and sat down to it with the \u201c don\u2019t\ncare \u201d feeling, which was bred of the confidence of past successes ;\nand success returned.\nTable VIII\nl(k\/i June, 1935\nNo. T S d 0\/\n\/O Conditions\n73 100 35 + 15 35 Pointer inside Boxes.\n74 100 45 + 25 45 )) 55\n75 100 23 + 3 23 ,, outside ,,\n76 100 21 + 1 21 ,, inside ,,\n77 100 21 + 1 21 ,, outside ,,\n78 20 11 + 6 55-0 ,,\ninside ,,\n79 80 31 + 15 58-7 ,, outside ,,\nNow, when the pointer was thrust into the boxes the conditions\nwere exactly the same as with the original Pointer Apparatus,\nexcept that it was not quite so silent.\nWhen the pointer was put outside the box the padded end was\nmerely rested on the shelf behind the box and opposite the opening.\nThe percipient could not see it here because of the depth of the box,\nand, in fact, never saw anything.\nThe return to the old conditions partly restored the scoring, and\nthe first criticism would be that this was due to the sound of the\npointer entering the box, for Nos. 73 and 74 show success when it is\nput in and No. 75 shows failure when it is put outside. But No. 76\nshows failure when it is put inside again ;\nand Nos. 78 and 79 which\nare a split run of 100 show a high rate of success both with the pointer\ninside and outside the box.\nIt is instructive to notice here how success and failure do not range\nthemselves with changes in the external conditions of the exjjeri-\nments but cut right across them. Thus, if the subject were scoring\n\f138 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nl^y the sound of the pointer No. 76 should go up and No. 79 sliould go\ndown. But if success comes at all, it seems to be oblivious of ex-\nternal conditions.\nReturn to Lawqjs and Keys\nSince scoring had again appeared, I went back to the Lamps and\nKeys, but again they proved a failure.\nTable IX\nlOdi June, 1935\nNo. T S d % Conditions\n80 406 93 +12 22-8 Lamps and Keys.\nWhat the subject said about them was that, when she came back\nto the Lamps and Keys, the \u201c don\u2019t care \u201d feeling she had with the\nPointer left her, and she felt concerned about the result. So failure\nagain supervened. We therefore went back to the beginning again\nand used the Pointer.\nTable X\n1 Ith June, 1935\nNo. T S d % Conditions\n81 100 23 23 Pointer inside Boxes.\n82 100 39 + 19 39 5? )>\n83 20 9 + 5 45 ) 5 ) J ) 5\n84 80 31 + 15 38-7 ,, outside ,,\nThe pointer again restored the scoring and again it did not matter\nwhether it entered the boxes or not. Hence, scoring cannot have\nbeen due to the sound of the pointer when it did enter. If any\nnormal means of scoring was being used, the difference between the\nscores in Nos. 81 and 82 remains unexplained, and the sudden drop\nafter Nos. 73 and 74 in Table VIII. A score of 39 in 100 cannot be\ndue to chance.\nAnother return to the Lamps and Keys was then tried.\nTable XI\nUth June, 1935\nNo. T s d 0\/\n\/o Conditions\n85 100 13 -7 13 Lanpjs and Keys\n86 100 26 + 6 26\n87 100 16 -4 16\n88 100 26 + 6 26\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 139\nHere was again failure when I went to the Lamj)S and Keys. Of\ncourse, to do this, I went liack to the operator\u2019s talde to work the\nKeys, whereas I worked the Pointer from the back of the per-\ncipient\u2019s own table. G.J. (or her subliminal) did not like the new\ncondition of my being further away ;\nso I removed the Keys to the\nback of her table, where they were, if anything, more effectively\nscreened than on my own table.\nHowever, I did not at first use the Keys but went back to the\nPointer again, removing the Lamps from the boxes. But, in order\nto take a step in the direction of accustoming the subject to the\n\u201c mechanical feeling \u201d of the new apparatus, I connected it so that\nthe automatic Eecorder would work even with the Lamps removed.\nThis Eecorder makes an audible click at every trial. But for this, the\nconditions were exactly the same as those with the Pointer experi-\nments.\nTable XII\nJune, 1935\nNo. T 8 d % Conditions\n89 100 40 -f-20 40 Pointer inside Boxes.\nThe Pointer had immediately restored success, and I went straight\non to replace the Lamps in the Boxes, and stopped using the\nPointer : and then, at last, after 3100 trials, success had began to\ncarry over from the Pointer to the Lamps.\nTable XIII\nNo. T 8 d 0\/\n\/O Conditions\n90 94 16 -2-8 17-0 Keys on Percij)ient\u2019s Table\nand Lamps.\n91 94 43 + 24-2 45-7 J3 53 33 33\n92 120 52 + 28-0 43-3 3333 33 33\nA special test was given to the apparatus after these trials and it\nwas found to be working perfectly.\nThis is very instructive, for the condition with the Lamps and\nKeys, which has now begun to give success, is exactly the same as\nthat which had given persistent failure for so long. The process is\nillustrated graphically in Graph I, which shows the condition with\nLamps failing at first alongside the successes with the Pointer, and\ngradually rising to parity with it. It shows the gradual yielding of\nthe subhminal and its slow accej^tance of the new conditions, and\nchallenges an explanation in terms of anything but the faculty of\nExtra-Sensory Perception. It also provides a lesson on the danger\n\f140 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nof forming hasty conclusions in this inquiry. At first everything\nbegins to look as if the Pointer must have afforded some loophole\nwhich has been stopped by the stricter conditions of the new method\nwith the Lamps. And if the machine did not provide a means of\ngoing on through a large number of trials, a critic might well go\naway with the impression that this was so. But perseverance shows\nthat it is nothing of the kind. It is merely an internal resistance to\nchange.\nBut it has been mentioned that there was one change in the ex-\nternal conditions which was made before scoring began with the\nlamps. The Keys had been moved from the operator\u2019s to the per-\ncipient\u2019s table ;\nand there might be some lingering doubt as to\nwhether this had given some hints by sound. But the next table\nshows a return to failure with the Lamps and Keys in this position.\nTable XIV\nY2th June, 1935\nNo. T S (1\n% Conditions\n93 331 64 -2-2 19-4 Keys on Percqhent\u2019s Table\nand Lamps.\nAny normal assistance to scoring would be a constant factor and\nwould not be likely to oscillate as the actual results do.\nThe next block of trials shows the condition of the Lamps\naccepted and very high rates of scoring attained with them, although\nthere is still the usual sporadic rise and fall.\nTable XV\n13dnl4Vi June, 1935\nNo. T S d 0\n0 A' P Conditions\n94 97 37 + 19-4 31-8 Keys and Lamps\n95 100 26 + 6-0 26-0 ?? 55\n96 76 26 -hIO-8 34-2 55 55 55\n97 100 42 -r 22-0 42-0 55 55 55\n98 100 20 0 20-0 55 55 55\n99 59 17 + 5-2 28-8 55 55 55\n100 100 30 + 10-0 30-0 55 55 55\n101 632 198 -t-71-6 31-3 7d 10-\u201c (Totals.)\nIn spite of the oscillation between chance and high values, the\ntotals of this block of results show clearly that it is just as possible\nfor G.J. to score with the Electrical Machine as with the Pointer\n\f141\n147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception\nApparatus, once it has l)een accepted : and scoring with it is main-\ntained in future.\nHealth of the Subject. Notes taken at this period show that the\nSpring of 1935 was wet and cold, and the sul)ject seems to have had\na succession of colds throughout May and the first half of June,\nwhich no doubt acted generally as a delaying factor.\nCommutator\nFrom 15th June, 1935, a Commutator was introduced as an integral\npart of the apparatus. This instrument has been described in the\ntechnical account of the apparatus and it will be sufficient here to\nstate its function. Up to this point, the wires from the operator's\nfive Keys had led directly to the five Lamps in the boxes, being con-\nnected to them in a straightforward, one to one order. Hence the\noperator knew, when he pressed any key, which lamp he was\nlighting. This made telepathy possible between operator and sub-\nject and caused all results to be \u201c undifferentiated \u201d as between\ntelepathy and clairvoyance. It also left open the criticism (however\nhighly improbable) that the operator might convey information\nunconsciously to the subject by \u201c unconscious whispering \u201d etc.\nThe Commutator is an electrically operated switch, enclosed in a\nbox, which transposes the connections between the Keys and the\nLamps in ways that may be known or unknown to the operator at\nwill. If unknown, there can be no telepathy, since he does not know'\nw'hat lamps he is lighting.\nE.xperiments with Keys wdll be divided into Known (K) and\nUnknown (U) classes. Exj^eriments with the mechanical Selector\nwill be denoted by (Sel). It is possible that either (K) or (U) may\nbe \u201c Mixed \u201d or \u201c Straight.\u201d\nTable XVI shows the effect of introducing the Commutator.\nTable XVI\n\\bth June, 1935\nNo. T 8 d 0\/\no Conditions\n102 84 17 + 0-2 20-2 (K) \u201c Straight\n\u201d\n103 92 44 -\nI\n- 25-6 47-7 (K) \u201c Straight\n\u201d\n104 100 41 + 21-0 41-0 (K) \u201c Straight\n\u201d\n105 100 14 - 6-0 14-0 (K) \u201c Mixed\n\u201d\n106 100 45 + 25-0 45-0 (K) \u201c Straight\n\u201d\n107 100 26 + 6-0 26-0 (K) \u201c Mixed\n\u201d\nThe condition so long rejected by the subject\u2019s subliminal of\nscoring with the Lamps still goes on here attaining high rates of\n\f142 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Fusilier Research [part\nsuccess. The new condition now is the mixing of the connexions\nby the Commutator, and Table XVI shows that it is not favoured\nwitli high scores.\nI must apologise here for rather stupidly introducing an un-\nnecessary comphcation by looking into the Commutator-box each\ntime to see whether it had stopped on a \u201c Straight \u201d or a \u201c Mixed\n\u201d\ncontact. This means that with logical strictness, the telepathic\nelement is not removed from the \u201c Mixed \u201d cases. I did not con-\nsciously remember the various mixed connexions, which were noted\nin a book ;\nbut I had known them, so that it could be argued that\ntelepathy was possible in these cases as well as in the \u201c Straight\n\u201d\nones. Strictly speaking, the important difference is between the\nKnown and the Unknown cases, and Straight and Mixed arrange-\nments, when equally Unknown, may be classed as the same. In\nTable XVI the subject knew which arrangement was being used,\nwhich might account for the differentiation between them.\nThe difficulty of comparing the Known with the Unknown\nconditions hes in the continual variations in scoring that one gets\nwith the same condition. Therefore in the next table I tried quickly\nchanging from one condition to the other in the middle of a run\nwithout letting the subject know which half was which, although I\ncould not prevent her knowing that a change was being made on\naccount of the slight, necessary pause.\nTable XVII\n\\btli June, 1935\nNo. T S d % Conditions\n108 50 3 -7 6 (K) Straight\n50 7 -3 14 (K) Mixed\n109 100 24 + 4 24 (K) Mixed\nMO 50 22 + 12 44 (K) Straight\n50 13 + 3 26 (K) Mixed\nMl 100 17 -3 17 (K) Mixed\n112 100 53 + 33 53 (K) Straight\n(Totals : or Tables XVI and XVII)\n113 1076 326 + 110-8 30-3 II 00\nP = 10-16\nThese results are extraordinary. The subj ect seems to have known\ntelepathically or guessed which were the Straight conditions and to\nhave done everything possible to avoid scoring with the Mixed\n\fin Extra-Sensory Perception 143\nconditions. No. 108 is the lowest score she has ever obtained and\nappears to be deliberately subnormal. It almost looks as if the\nsubhminal was not sure which half embodied the new, Mixed con-\ndition, and resolved to score as low as possible with both in order to\nbe on the safe side. In No. 109 there is a chance to score with the\nMixed condition. In No. 110 the Straight condition seems to have\nbeen picked out and the score goes up, while the Mixed condition is\ngiven a chance score. Then the Mixed condition, tried alone for\nthe second time, is again met with a chance score. Finally the\nStraight condition, offered alone, is seized on for the highest score\non record (No. 112). That the subliminal had been very active\nduring this trial was shown by the fact that the subject had to he\ndown afterwards, feehng the nervous strain. This may have been\npartly due to the subj ect\u2019s state of health, for a contemporary note\nsays, \u201c G.J. still with heavy cold, continually sneezing.

Mixed condition as an indication that it is about to be accepted.\nOn 19th June, 675 further trials showed the same tendency to score\nwith the Straight and not with the Mixed arrangement.\nElectric Sounder\nOn 19th Jrme an Electric Sounder was installed for giving the signal\nfor opening the boxes instead of saying the word \u201c In.\u201d It was\nfortunately accepted almost at once and was always used after this\ndate.\nA break in the experiments then occurred until August 1935.\nThen the subject came back after a holiday and tried with the Com-\nmutator in a Mixed, and this time also Unknown, position and scored\nimmediately.\nTable XVllI\n22\u00abfZ August, 1935\n^ 5' d % Cionditions\n123 90 35 ^17 .38-9 (U) Mixed\nThe probabihty of this being a chance result is about 5 in a\nmilhon.

And on this particular occasion the con-\nnexions were not only Mixed but also Unknown.\nDuring the remainder of August the scoring was poor, Ijoth with\nthe Straight and IMixed arrangements.\n\f144 [part\nG.

It was worked by raising a small lever beside the\no])erator\u2019s Keys, which, at the same time, worked a counter to register\nthe trials. Henceforward, this Sounder was always used, and the\no])erator spoke no word except in the case of Precognitive trials.\n(3) A screen, reaching from the table top to the floor was in-\nserted, so that the legs and feet of the operator could not touch\nthose of the perci])ient.\n(4) A Delay-action Relay was installed, the purj)ose of which has\nalready been referred to and will also be described later.\nTliese a])pliances, together with the Commutator, were designed\nto rule out every possibility of normal sources of leakage and also\nevery chance of leakage through visual or auditory hyperaesthesia.\nG.J. came back well on 14th September, 1935, but most unfor-\ntunately, through an accident, caught a cold on 1 5th September, which\nlasted till 11th October.

Here is\na repetition of the same process which for so long a time refused to\nscore with the Lamps instead of the Pointer, but finally accepted\nthem. There is a strong confirmation in all this that the subject\nhas not been scoring by any normal means ;\nfor, if there had been\nany source of leakage, such as unconscious whispering or the hke,\nor any number-habit raising the probability of success, which must\nhave been cut out by the use of the Commutator, then the score\nwould have fallen to chance whenever the Commutator was used.\nSuch a normal explanation would not account for the gradual rise\nin scoring with the Unknown condition until it rose to parity with\nthe Known condition. Each time that a new external condition is\nintroduced it is met with failure at first and success later. There\nis, therefore, some condition which is gradually changing ;\nand\nthis is clearly not an external condition ;\ntherefore it must be an\ninternal condition. The whole process is shown grajjhically in\nGraph II, where the dotted fine represents the Unknown condition\nand is far below the full line at first, but rises together with it at\nthe end.\nThe Delay-action Relay\nThe same results have to be examined from the point of view of\nthe delay-action. The Delay-action Relay operates as follows.\nWhen the operator depresses one of the Keys, a circuit passing\nthrough one of the lamps is selected : but the lamp is not lit because\nthere is a break in the common return-wire of the lamp circuits.\nW hen the box-hd is opened, this energises a relay, which closes this\ngap in the lamp-circuits and the pre-selected lamp is lit. Thus, the\nselected lamp is actually lit by the percipient\u2019s own action in opening\nthe box-lid. (See DAR on the diagram of comiexions. A.) The\neffect of this is three-fold : (1) It removes the ostensible event which\nis exposed for the clairvoyant faculty, viz. the lamp lit in the box\nbeforehand ;\nso that, when the Commutator is used as well, the\nknowledge required for telepathy from the operator is not there ;\nand also the ostensible event presented for clairvoyance is not there\neither. (2) It removes all possibility of knowledge being gained\nthrough the percipient\u2019s normal senses, whether hyperaesthetic or\nnot. There is first the auditory sense. It will be remembered that it\nwas said when the apparatus was being described that the five\nrelays in the lamp-circuits are each connected in circuit with its\n\f146 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nlamp, and tliat it was necessary to silence tliese relays very carefully,\nbecause, if the sound of each could be heard and was distinctive\nand recognisable, it would give a clue to the lamp which was being\nlit. With the delay-action device, these relays, like the Lamps\ntliemselves, are brought into action by the percipient\u2019s own action\nin raising the box-lid. Therefore, if it be supposed that these relays\nare hyperaesthetically audible, they could now give no help in\nscoring. (3) The question of the leakage of light past the box-lids is\nsolved by this device, since there can be no leakage of light before\nthe lamp is lit. And the same applies to any supposed radiation of\nwhatever kind which might be supposed to pass from the lamps\nthrough the wood of the boxes to the percipient, there to affect\nsome unknown sense-organ in some unknown way. Or to any guide\ngiven by a supposed rise of tem])erature of the box-lid when the\nlamp is alight inside, even were this not ruled out by the speed of\nworking. All possible help from sense-stimidi of any sort is rendered\nimpossible by the use of the Delay-action Relay.\nIt is interesting to specidate as to what differentiation is left for\nthe percipient\u2019s faculty to work on when the delay-action is used.\nW'hen the key is closed by the operator, although no current flows,\nthe wires connected to the Keys are charged up as far as the break in\nthe circuit at the relay ;\nand it seems at first sight as if the lamp that\nis going to })e ht will be raised to a higher potential than the others\nand that there might l)e this differentiation for the faculty to work\non. But an examination of the connexion shows that this is not the\ncase. There is a common wire connecting all the Lamps together,\nso that, when any key is pressed, all the lamps are charged up simul-\ntaneously. The only differentiation is the closing of the gap in the\nkey pressed ;\nand in order to know by clairvoyant perception which\nlamj) will be lit, it is necessary to know what are the connexions\ninside the Commutator.\nSince this gronj) of results is fairly balanced as between the\nKnowm and Unknown classes, it may be used as one group for com-\nparison between Delay-action and Non-delay-action classes.\nTable XXI\n18d; tSepteniber to 12th October, 1935\nNo. T d ()\n\/o A' P CoiuUtions\n128 2150 620 -1 130 25-3 6-56 10-10 Non-delay action\n129 3750 856 + 106 22'8 4 -33 10 Delay-action\n\fin Extra-Sensory Perception 147\nThe figure with the delay-action is not as good as that witliout it,\nbut it is ainjjly significant. Only the loosest reliance can be placed\non a comparison of external conditions based on a comparison of such\nfigures, since there is no guarantee that conditions other than the\none which the experimenter has deliberately altered have remained\nconstant. Probably the nearest approach which can be made to-\nwards comparing external conditions in this kind of work is attained\nby altering the condition in the middle of a block of 100 trials.\nThis was done in order to compare the delay-action and non-delay-\naction conditions, as the change from one condition to the other can\nbe made by merely moving a small switch which does not interrupt\nthe experiment. Sometimes the delay-action was introduced into\nthe first 50 trials and sometimes into the last, the percipient being\nalways in ignorance of which was which.\nTable XXII\nTrials between V2th October, 1935 and 2bth January, 1936\nNo. T S d 0^\n\/o X F Conditions\n130 1090 306 + 88 28-0 6-7 10-10 Non-delay-action\n131 1105 302 + 81 27'3 6-1 10-9 Delay-action\nThese figures give about the best comparison that can be made\nbetween the two external conditions, and the result shows that,\nalthough both conditions give highly significant results, there is\npractically no difference between them. However the scoring is\ndone, therefore, it cannot be by normal sense-perception or by hyper-\naesthesia.\nIt is interesting to note that, although with the delay-action, a\nthird new factor has been introduced, there seems to have been no\nprotest against it as there was at first against the Lamps and against\nthe Commutator. It is accepted from the outset, or rather ignored,\nwhich is remarkable, as one would have thought that it would make\nmore difference to the operation of any faculty in the least like sense-\nperception than the mere substituting of a lamp for a pointer. The\nresistances ajipear to be rather against a condition giving the feeling\nof strangeness than against what we should consider to be solid\ndifficulties placed in the way of Extra-Sensory Perception itself.\nhnprovements to the Apparatus\nOn 16th November, 1935, the Keys, Synchronising Lamji and\nCounter were removed from the percipient\u2019s table and put back on\nthe operator s table. A screen 5 feet high from the floor was fitted\n\f148 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further lieseareh [part\nrouiul the two sides of the operator\u2019s tal)le wliich were outwards\ntowards the room, the table being situated in tlie corner so that the\no])erator sits back to the wall. The wires connecting the two tables\nwere lengthened so that the taldes could be placed as much as 8 or\n9 feet apart.\nDuring the early j)art of January the contacts of the box-lids\nwere renewed, more efficient ones being substituted for those pro-\nvided by the maker. The resistance-board of lamps was covered\nwith a metal screen ;\nand early in Feliruary, all the circuits of the\napparatus were made independent of one another so as to increase\nits reliability.\nEx2)osure of the Event for Claimoyance\nAt the usual rate of working with G.J., lUO trials occupy from\nGO to 70 seconds ;\nand, at this speed, operator and subject cannot\nhelp working in a steady rhythm, which is no doubt helpful to the\nphenomena, but which soon results in the 1)0X being opened at the\nsame instant that the key is 2\n)ressed, without any interval during\nwhich the lamp is alight before the box is opened. It therefore\nseemed desirable to test whether any difference could be perceived\nlietween trials in which the lamp was alight well before the box was\no])ened (when the clairvoyant faculty has a well-marked event to\nwork on) and in trials in which the lamp was not alight until just\nafter the box was opened. Accordingly, some blocks of trials were\ndone slowly, the key being pressed from 3\/4 to 1\/2 second before the\nsignal was given to open the box. In the middle of the run, i.e. after\n50 trials, the switch was thrown over which brought the delay-action\ninto operation, and prevented, without interrupting the series, the\nlamp from being lit until the box was opened. Sometimes the\ndelay-action was in the first half of the series and sometimes in the\nsecond, the subject never knowing in which half it was. Telepathy\non the part of the operator was in all cases ruled out by the use of\nthe Commutator. This gave the following result\nTable XXIII\n\\2th October to 25rd January, 1936\nNo. T A d % A P Conditions\n132 845 242 + 73 28-6 6-3 10-9 Lamp exposed be-\nfore I)Ox opens\n133 855 224 + 53 26-2 4-5 10-9 to\n10 fi\nNo lamp till after\nbox opens\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 149\nThe results wlien the lamp was \u201c exposed \u201d are a little better than\nthose in which it was cut out ;\nbut there is no evidence that the\nlamp alight in the box beforehand is essential to success. Both re-\nsults are far above chance. This tells us that success is possible when\nthere can be no telepathy and when there is no ostensible object for\nclairvoyant perception until afterwards. It has the appearance of\nj^recognition ;\nbut a sufficiently elaborate theory of combined\nclairvoyance and telepathy might be jmt forward instead.\n\u201c Precogniiive \u201d Results\nCertain blocks of trials were done in the following way. The box\nwas opened each time by the percipient about half a second liefore\nthe key was pressed. The Commutator was used on every occasion\nto eliminate telepathy ;\nand the tape record shows in the case of\nevery success that the box was in fact opened before the key was\npressed by the amount that the trial line overlaps the success line\n(sample of taj^e).^ These trials are called \u201c Precognitive \u201d because\nthey appear to be so ;\nthey may be and, I think, probably are ;\nl)ut\nit is not stated that there is no possible alternative explanation.\nThe results were :\nTable XXIV\n13f\/i October to I3th February, 1936\nNo. T S d % X P Conditions\n134 2255 539 -t-88 23-9 4-6 10~\u00ae to 10^\u00ae \u201cPrecognitive\u201d\nSince these cannot be due to chance, it is of interest to ask by what\nother means, if not by precognition, they could have been obtained.\nThere can have been no telepathy because the Commutator was used\non all occasions. If there were contemporary instead of j^recognitive\nclairvoyance, it would have had to be the 02:>erator who exercised it,\nand not the subject. The operator must have known, perhaps by\ntelepathy, which box the subject had opened. After that, the\noperator would have to resort to clairvoyance to penetrate into the\nrecesses of the enclosed Commutator, there to discover the cross-\nconnexions linking the Lani2\n)s to the Keys. Having sorted out the\nright connexions, the operator must then have pressed the key cor-\nresponding with the box which the subject had opened.\nThe great difficulty in this explanation is that the writer was in\nmost cases himself the operator and cannot believe himself to be\nendowed with the jJsychic powers which this exj^lanation demands.\nThese powers are entirely absent when he occu])ies the ])ercijhcnt\u2019s\n1\n\fG.

Table XXV\ncontains all the results obtained under the conditions specified\nunder each heading lietween 13th May, 1935 and 30th March, 1936,\nwhich is the period dealt with in the present report. But these\ngroups entail a certain amount of cross-classification, since it is\nimpossible to form groups which do not contain some element in\ncommon, and this robs the figures of complete clarity. For example,\nalthough No. 139 contains no results which appear in Nos. 137 and\n138, it does consist of cases in some of which the connexions to the\nlamps were known and in others unknown. It therefore cuts across\nNos. 137 and 138 and at the same time it withholds results which\nwould have l)oen included in these latter, but for the S])ecial, addi-\ntional feature of the delay-action. There are also important con-\nditions, such as changes in the emotional tone or health of the sub-\nject, which undoubtedly influence the result and which would cut\nright across the above classification ;\nand these have been omitted.\nHence it comes about that any attempt at a causal analysis of the\nresidts by dividing them into groups and attributing success to the\nvarious groTips in projjortion to the rate of scoring is defeated by the\nconfusion introduced by the inevitable cross-grouping. Except\nunder very favourable circumstances, and then oidy very roughly,\ngroup-conditions must not be correlated with rates of scoring.\n\f147] in Extra-Sensory Perception 151\nThere is a danger in ])ublishing such tables as the al)ove that the\nreader may extract more information from them than they con-\ntain. The most favourable case for comjjarison is between Nos. 138\nand 139, for there the condition was in some cases c[uickly changed\nin the middle of the groups of trials without the sulij ect\u2019s knowledge,\nand the indication is that the difference in the conditions, though\nprofound, made no appreciable difference to the rate of scoring.\nLittle more can safely be inferred from Table XXV than that\nsome factor other than chance has manifested itself in all cases other\nthan that in which the mechanical Selector was used. It looks at\nfirst sight as if the mechanical Selector must have imposed some\ncondition which rendered scoring with it impossible. But one\nlearns to be wary in judging from first appearances. The reader is\nreferred to the remarks about the Selector experiments which were\nmade on p. 135. Also the results given in No. 136, which were made,\nnot with the Selector itself, but with numbers taken from the\nSelector and transmitted through the Keys, have attained signifi-\ncance. These experiments, although covering the period under re-\nview, were in fact all made between 4th and 30th March, 1936, which\nwas a period of low scoring all round, and it would be imsafe to\nregard them as representative.^ Again, results with mechanically\nselected numbers were obtained when earlier experiments were\nbeing made with the Pointer Apparatus in 1935, but which do not\ncome under the present period of review and these showed the much\nhigher rate of scoring of 28-5%. On the whole it would be safer to\nsuspend judgment for the present on the negative result of No. 135\nand the barely significant result of No. 136 in Table XXV.\nNo. 141, which is the final total of all the previous groups in\nTable XXV, includes the whole of the results dealt with in this\nreport. It must not be taken as indicating more than that the anti-\nchance figures shown in the separate groups are not in themselves\nchance fluctuations within the whole. This, indeed, is sufficiently\nobvious in any case. Since many different conditions are pooled\ntogether, the average rate of scoring in this table camiot be taken\nto mean anything in particular.\nSubsequently to the period covered by the report, further results were\nobtained iir this class. About the middle of May, 1936, the inhibitory\ninfluence of the Fisk shock began to disappear and iVIiss Johnson showed\nsigns of returning to her normal rates of scoring. Thus, between 4th March,\n1936 and 2nd July, 1936, the scores for the condition in No. 136 were : Trials\n7809 ;\nSuccesses 1841 ;\nAverage rate of scoring 23-53'o ;\n^ ;\nP lO^^^.\nAlso, since 18th June, 1936, positive scoring has begun with the mechanical\nSelector itself. These results are of course impossible -with the Fisk method\nof scoring.\n\f152 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nGrouping of Successes\nA ])oint of considerable interest sliows itself on the tape records.\nWhere series of trials have been successful, the successes are dis-\ntributed very unevenly, tending to bunch together in certain places ;\nand it has also been noticed that these batches of consecutive suc-\ncesses correspond with times when the subject has the experience of\nlosing herself in the experiment. It should, in j:>rinciple, be possible\nto determine whether this groujoing of successes is greater than could\nbe accounted for by chance, but this jtroblem has not yet been gone\ninto. On the surface, it looks as if the above chance scores of the\nsuccessful series of trials were due to these short periods of excep-\ntionally high rates of scoring super-imposed upon the more evenly\ndistributed successes due to chance.\nIndication of the Beep Level of Extra-Sensory Prehension\nThe way in which the results have emerged, lieginning with series\nof failures and leading up to later successes, show that there is a\nreluctance to acce2\n)t new conditions, but that this is not due to any\ninherent difficidty of the percej^tual act itself but rather to hind-\nrances or resistances in the ]:)ath of emergence. The indication is that\nthe variations in performance are due to variations in the conditions\non the lines of communication and not to conditions at the source of\nthe percejDtual process itself. Such a process must therefore take\nplace deep down in the personality of the subject and there is no\nindication as yet that any condition has been discovered which\nmaterially affects it.\nOther Percipients\nBesides Mi.ss Johnson, the three other percipients who scored\nabove chance with the Pointer Apparatus were Mrs Hemingway,\nMrs Bramley-Moore and Mr Miller. Mrs Hemingway\u2019s results will\nbe dealt with below. Mrs Bramley-Moore did 1400 trials on the\nelectrical apparatus, but only attained a chance score. Mr Miller\nhas only quite recently begun experiments on the Electrical Ap-\nparatus and it is too early to say what the result will be.\nRelation of Health to Scoring\nIt is extremely difficult to determine any clear relation between\nIMiss Johnson\u2019s health and the rate of scoring with the apparatus,\nbecause her health often seems to 1)e not of the best but in an\nundehnable way. The following table, however, taken from\ncontemporary notes, shows how continually colds interfere with\nresults.\n\f147 ]\ni)i Extra-Sensory Perception 153\nDate Remarks\n13th May, 1935 - Began work with Electrical Apparatus.\n20th May, 1935 - G.J. with headache.\n23rd-26th May, 1935 G.J. in bed with bad cold and cough.\n27th May, 1935 - G.J. up Init not well.\n3rd June, 1935 G.J. lying on sofa with headache.

This shows why work has been so\nslow.\nA New System op Scoring\nI now come to an interesting and rather extraordinary discovery\nwhich is due to Mr G. W. Fisk, who has kindly devoted a good deal\nof time and trouble to taking part in this investigation. Mr Fisk\nhad acted as one of the 30 subjects tested with the Pointer Apparatus,\nbut had been unsuccessful in scoring. Afterwards he acted as one of\nthe agents with this apparatus when Miss Johnson was the per-\ncipient ;\nand also as the agent with her in the experiments with\nZener cards. The results of all these have been dealt with above.\nIt was when trying the card experiments with Miss Johnson that\nit occurred to him to try again as percipient, but this time with the\nElectrical Machine. He had evidently been thinking things over\nand the results he produced astonished us all.\n\f154 G. N. M.

I then, without\nsaying anytliing, switclicd on the Selector, and he continued to\nscore with this at approximately the same average rate, viz. 29-0%.\nThe odds against tins latter score being due to chance are about ten\nthousand to six.\nMr Fisk\u2019s own ex})la,nation of liis success was tlie system by which\nhe was scoring. lie selected one box and kept on opening it until\na light appeared. Then he, immediately went on to another box,\nwhich he chose at random, and continued to open that until a light\nappeared there also. He then went on to another, and repeated the\noperation through the series. I shall call this method the Fisk\nFlexilde System. It was not at all easy to see why it should account\nfoi' the high rate of scoring, and 1 was scejdical. Mr Fisk\u2019s theory\nwas that, after a success had I)een obtained in one box, there was a\nslightly greater chance of ol)taining one at another box than at the\nsame again. Hut it was not at all clear why this should be so, since\nthe operator would jjrobably repeat a key about as often as the\nmechanical selector would rejjeat it. In fact, I felt sure that this was\nso in my own case as 1 had compared my own repetitions with those\nin the tests of the Selector and was conscious of making them about\nas often.\nHut the fact of the high scoring was jdain ;\nso on 2nd Dec., 1935,\nfour methods of scoring were compared, Mr Fisk being the per-\ncipient. (1) The Fisk Flexible Method. (2) The same method,\nexce])t that the ]>assing on to the next box was done in a rigid and\n])redetermined order, thus excluding all sco])e for guessing. I shall\ncall this the Fisk Higid System. (3) doing from box to box in a\njiredetermined ordei' without ever rejieating a box. These three\n\f147] in Extra-Sensory Perception 155\nwith myself as o])era,tor, using the Keys. (4) Method (1) witli tlie\nMechanical Selector.

It showed that the Selector causes the system\nto fail. And it showed that a rigid system which does not wait for\nthe light to ajjpear in a box before going on, fails to score above\nchance. The scoring therefore depends upon waiting for the light.\nThese conclusions were confirmed by further experiments.\nMr Fisk and I then did two sets of experiments, using his Rigid\nSystem, in which we changed places :\nTable XXVIII\nNo. T N 0\/\n\/o V Operator Percijjient C'ondition.s\n151\n152\n2000\n1400\n607\n431\n30-3\n30-8\n0-303\n0-308\nG.N.M.T.\nG.W.F.\nG.W.F.\nG.N.M.T.\nFi.sk Rigid System\n55 5) JJ\nIn this table p stands for the Probability of Success ;\nthat is, the\nnumber of Successes divided by the number of Trials.\nIt is very remarkable that these come out almost exactly the\nsame, the inference being that Mr Fisk and I must space our selec-\ntions of keys in just the same way ;\nand it is j)ossible that every\noperator would do the same, and that there may be a constant\ndifference in this respect between a human operator and a mechani-\ncal one.\nFurther experiments were made, which are not here recorded,\nrepeating these results, and they bring out clearly one very striking\ndifference between scoring which is done by assuming a false prob-\nability of success and scoring that is done by an E.S.P. faculty.\nThe former is perfectly reliable and occurs every time an experiment\nis made. The latter is most unreliable and is continually varying.\nIt was puzzling to know in what way the human selector differed\nfrom the mechanical one, and four blocks of 100 trials, in which I\n\f156 G.

Nor do the graphed records show\nany signs of sequence number-habits.\nHaving graphed records both from the human ojierator and from\nthe mechanical Selector, it is easy to go through them according\nto the Fisk Rigid System on paper without actually trying them in\njiractice.

(See Graph 111, Nos. I ami III.) In Gra])h 111 the line\nwhich runs through each table represents the mode of scoring with\nthe Fisk Rigid Method according to the fixed order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nBeginning wdth Box 1 the fine represents the repeated opening of the\nsame box until a success is attained and then the removal to the\nnext box which is shown by the line going on to the next column,\nand so on.\nExamination shows that the difference between the two is not that\nthe human operator selects one number more often than the Selector\ndoes, or has any sequence number-habits, but that he distributes\nhis choice more evenly amongst the five numbers than jjure chance\nwould do. The result is that, if the percipient continues to open the\nsame box until a light appears, he will not run the risk of having to\nwait so long with the human operator as he will with the mechanical\nselector. It is not that the operator falls into preferences ;\nit is that\nhe is too impartial ! Until Mr Fisk thought of it, I have never heard\nany critic make this \u2018suggestion. If the human operator behaved\nas the mechanical operator does in fact behave, he would feel that\nhe was favouring some numbers at the expense of others. So he is\nmore impartial than the Selector in the short run of 100 trials ;\nbut\nthe selector evens things out and is impartial in the long run. If\nGraph III be exammed, it will be found that in I there is no space\nin any column longer than 8 trials : in III there is a space of 21\ntrials and one of 13. It is tins difference in the spacing which\nallows the Fisk system to score.\nThe reader may be reminded that when deahng with Chance,\nthe meaning of the words \u201c equally hkely \u201d was considered. It\nwas said, \u201c That any one of five events is equally likely to hapj^en\nmeans, in this sense, that if the trials are continued, the tendency\nis indefinitely towards the occurrence of each of the five events an\nequal number of times, that is one-fifth of the total, in the long run.\u201d\nBut \u201c equally likely \u201d events will not be equally distributed in a\nshort number of trials.\nMrs Hemingway\nThe subject who had scored next best after Miss Johnson with the\nPointer Apparatus was Mrs Hemingway, Her average rate of\nscoring with this had been 25-2% over 2000 trials, and the chance-\nprobability between 10\u201c\u00ae and 10\u201c\u00ae.\nWhen tried with the Electrical Apparatus, her rate of scoring was\nlow, though the total result after 4400 trials was just significant\n(P=0-00G). I wished to increase her rate of scoring l>y giving a\n\f158 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nsuggestion wiiicli might help the sul)]iminal ;\nso 1 suggested to lier,\nafter Mr Fisk\u2019s success with his method, that- for one occasion only\nshe should adopt the Fisk method of scoring and I told her that it\nwoidd automatically bring u]) the result, but that this would not be\ndue to her own faculty but to a change in the jmobability of success.\nThis may have been rash ;\nbut I did not then believe in the Fisk\nmethod and merely used it to give colour to the suggestion that her\nscore would go up. It did go up, of course, although at the time I\nIjelieved it was owing to the suggestion. After that I told her not to\nuse the Fisk method again, but I am afraid, without success. The\nscores obtained were as follows :\nTable XXXI\n28d\/ November, 1935. Mrs Henmigway and the Fisk Method\nNo. T 8 d 0\n\/ 0 A' P Conditions\n165 500 123 + 23 24-6 2-57 0-005 With Fisk Method\nSuggestetl.

The scores in No. 166 must therefore be\nregarded with suspicion as probably due to the use of the Fisk\nmethod. Mrs Hemingw'ay must. have been scoring without it to get\nher results on the Pointer Apparatus, with wdiicli the Fisk method\ncannot be used, and seems to have l)een scoring positively at a low\nrate wdth tlie Electrical A2\n)paratus before the 28th November ;\nl)ut the large increases in scores after that date are almost certainly\ndue to the Fisk method and must be discounted.\nMiss Johnson and the Fisk Method\nTo what extent does the discovery of the Fisk method of scoring\naffect Miss Johnson\u2019s results ? I may as well admit that it would\nhave been better had I obtained some results which were checked\nthrough in detail earlier in the investigation. But I think t hat the\n\f147 ]\nin Extra-Sensory Perception 159\narguments against Miss Johnson having used the Fisk method are\nvery strong. They are :\n(1) Miss Johnson herself asserts that she never used it before it\nwas explained to her. When, after that, she tried it, it simply put\nher off and reduced her score. She said that the rule of keeping\nto one box till a light came merely confused her because she had a\nfeeling all the time that a lamp was alight elsewhere.\n(2) The gradual acceptance of new conditions, when she simul-\ntaneously scored with an old condition and failed to score with a new\none, until finally she scored with both, are very hard to reconcile\nwith the Fisk mode of scoring.\n(3) The extreme uncertainty and varial)ility of her scoring do not\npoint to the Fisk method.\n(4) Operators who have used the Pointer A2\n)paratus are agreed\nthat the Fisk method cannot be used with it.\n(5) The results which Miss Johnson obtained with mechanically\nselected numbers could not possibly have been scored on the Fisk\nsystem. (See. Table III and footnote on p. 151.)\n(6) In the checked block of 100 trials shown in Graph III, No. IV,\nthere is no trace of the Fisk method. (Compare with Mrs Heming-\nway\u2019s result in Graph III, No. II.)\nWhile the Fisk system was being discussed and tested {i.e. after\n28th October, 1935) Miss Johnson did get into the way of mixing it\nwith her ordinary mode of scoring : and it had the effect of sending\nher rate of scoring down instead of tip. With Mrs Hemingway it had\nthe opposite effect. This fact is shown very clearly in Table XXXII,\nin which the scores for 2000 trials before and after the Fisk discovery\nare compared (a) for Miss Johnson and {h) for Mrs Hemingway.\nTable XXXII\nMiss Johnson\nNo. T S d % Z P Conditions\n168 2000 501 + 101 25-6 5-6 fO-io Before Fisk discovery.\n169 2000 440 + 40 22-0 2-2 0-01 After Fisk discovery.\nMrs Hemirtgway\n170 2000 445 + 45 22-2 2-5 0-01 Before Fisk discovery.\n171 2000 607 + 207 30-3 11-5 10-29 After Fisk discovery.\nIt may be said, therefore, that while Mrs Hemingway\u2019s results\nwith the Electrical Apparatus must be discredited on account of the\n\f160 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\n])robal)le large admixture of Fisk metliod, there is no reason to\ndiscredit Miss Johnson\u2019s.\nCoincidence between Fisk Method rate of scoriny and Miss Johnson'\u2019s\nIt is remarkable that the rate of scoring with the Fisk Rigid\nMethod and Miss Jolinson\u2019s average rate of scoring when at her best\nare both close to 30%. This, at first sight, looks a very susiricious\nfact, the more so since Miss Johnson\u2019s rate of scoring fell oif very\nmuch after the Fisk method was discovered. But it must be just\none of those coincidences which seem to be set like traps for the hasty\nand unwary. The figures of Table III and at the foot of p. 151 are\nalone enough to disprove it. The most plausible line for the critic\nto take would Ijc to allege that there had been a mixture of the Fisk\nmethod with guessing ;\nbut personally I do not l)elieve that there\never was before the Fisk method was suggested to Miss Johnson.\nThe system merely balks the genuine faculty with her.\nThe Fisk method is quite easily prevented (a) by the use of the\nSelector or of mechanically selected numbers, or (6) by arranging that\nthe percipient does not know when a success has been scored. In\nthe latter case, there is no reason to suppose that the human operator\nis not exactly on a par with the mechanical Selector.\nPsychological Effect of the Fisk Discovery\nThe effect of the Fisk discovery on Miss Johnson\u2019s scoring was\nmost unfortunate. In fact, from one point of view, the most im-\nportant result of this discovery has been its psychological effect as a\ndeterrent and inhibitory influence on the subliminal. The suggestion\nwas made suddenly that there was some method by which scores of\nthe same order as those which Miss Johnson had been getting by\nmeans of her faculty could be got by a quite normal and, as it were,\n\u201c trick \u201d method. The exact explanation of the method and the\nbearing it would have on the work of the past six months was not yet\nclear. No better exani])le could be staged of the kind of thing which\nit is the j^aramount duty of the experimenter to guard against or of\nanything more likely to create a subconscious resistance against the\nexperiments as a whole. In point of fact, Miss Johnson\u2019s power of\nscoring dropped at once and from that date (28th October, 1935) to\nthe present time has never recovered. And it is interesting to note\nthat the falling off is not with regard to one condition only, but to all\nalike. On J3th February, 1936, the rate of scoring showed signs of\npicking up again, but illness sent it down soon after ;\nand at the\npresent time (March, 1936) Miss Johnson can scarcely get more than\n\f147 ] in Extra-Sensory PercejMon 1(51\nchance scores with any condition, as a result of the dejwessive in-\nfluence of the Fisk shock or of bad health or of l)oth.\nThe Fisk Method and Zener Cards\nIt is possible with the Fisk method to score witli Zener cards\nunder the same conditions as with the human operator in the aj)-\nparatus. The simplest way to test this is to lay the shutfled pack out\nin line face upwards on the table and, having decided the rigid order\nto be used, go through the pack counting the successes. Different\norders can then be used with the same lay-out. Very high \u201c anti-\nchance probabilities \u201d are obtained if the probability of success is\ntaken to be 1\/5.\nThis was tested by both Mr Fisk and myself and Mr Herbert\nkindly made some systematic tests which confirmed them.\nUsing an ordinary pack of 25 Zener cards Mr Herbert obtained\nthe following results ;\n(1) Using the Fisk Rigid System and going through the pack in\n10 different orders. }) assumed = 1\/5.\nTable XXXIII\nNo. T 8 d % X P\n172 2500 620 +120 24-8 6-0 10-\u00ab to 10-\u00ab\nor, put in a form giving the actual probability of success,\nS\/T=jj=0-2i8.\n(2) When the orders were mixed by changing them within the\n25 trials, the scoring on the whole sank to something like chance\nvalues.\nTable XXXIV\nNo. T 8 d % X P\n173 2500 527 +29 21-2 1-45 0-07\n(3) Putting four packs of Zener cards together to make one pack\nof 100, and going through with the sequences as in (1) gave the\nfollowing result\nTable XXXV\nNo. T 8 d % A' P\n174 2500 519 +19 20-7 0-95 0-17\nThis is a chance result and indicates that a pack of 100 cards is\nlarge enough to give something near enough to random shuffling for\npractical purposes, although a pack of 25 is not.\n\f162 G. N. M. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\n(4) Finally, j)acks of 25 cards were drawn at random from a\nwell-slmffled pool of 100 cards and the same process of sequences\ngone through again. Results :\nTable XXXVI\nNo. T S d % X P\n175 3000 611 +11 20-4 0-5 0-3\nThis again gives a chance result.\nTo sum up these results, it is possible by using the Fisk method\nconsistently to obtain highly significant scores with a pack of\n25 Zener cards, but if a pack of 100 Zener cards is used, or more, the\neffect of the Fisk method is practically wiped out. Or, alternatively,\nif packs of 25 Zener cards are drawn from a well-shuffled pool of\n100 cards or over the same applies. Changing the rigid order in the\ncourse of an ex]ierinient, waters down the Fisk effect.\nThe reason of this Fisk effect with Zener cards has, of course,\nnothing to do with the thoroughness of the shuffling to which the\npack is subjected. It is the result of the fact that it is impossible\nto arrange the pack in a truly random order because the condition\nis im])osed that five cards of each kind must be included in a pack of\n25. In a truly random arrangement, this will very rarely be satis-\nfied ;\nand the Fisk method scores because a shorter average space\nexists between any diagram and a repetition of that diagram than\nwould be the case if the cards were arranged in a truly random order.\nThe Fisk Method and Dr Rhine's Results\nThe question arises how far the discovery of the Fisk method\naffects Dr Rhine\u2019s results. As has been said, the possibility of using\nthe method is easily annulled, whether by using a pack of 100 or\nmore cards, or by arranging that the percipient does not know when\nhe scores a success. But, in any case, as each call is entered as the\n])ercipient makes it, it would be quite easy for Dr Rhine to know\nwhether any percipient had been using the method or not : and as it\nwould be very obvious and he does not mention it, presumably his\n2\n)ercipients did not use it. It would be very unnatural to use it\nunless it had been suggested. It would, however, be advisable in\nany future exjjcriments that all investigators should rule out the\npossibility of the Fisk method being used.\nConclusion\nOne surprising fact which has come into prominence in the course\nof this investigation is the absence of any general disposition among\n\f147] in Extra-Sensory Perception 163\ninvestigators to regard the search for unknown modes of perception\nas fundamentally a problem in psychology. One would have thought\nthat stress laid on this point of view, or emphasis given to the pri-\nmary importance of psychological conditions in an inquiry into a\ncognitive faculty, would have been in the nature of a platitude : but\nit seems, on the contrary, that no truth is more in need of emphasis.\nIf it is alleged that success in E.S.P. depends upon a delicate balance\nof psychological forces vdthin the subject ;\nor if insistence is laid on\nthe necessity for guarding the subject against adverse suggestions,\nor on the necessity for fostering favourable emotional conditions :\nor even if a departure is made from the bare numerical totals to show\nhow the paranormal factor emerges in the curious way in which the\nexperiments have developed, the attitude of a common form of\ncriticism is to regard all this askance as the excuse of a prej udiced\nadvocate, who is trying to cover repeated failures. Kepeated failures\ndo not need to be excused : they are merely a fact which investigation\ndiscloses. The point is that the boot is on the other leg, for this kind\nof critical attitude is in itself no centrally poised, scientific position,\nfor it is not even ready to accept on an equal footing every kind of\ncondition which experience shows to be necessary for success. In its\nbias against the psychological and its over-emphasis of the physical,\nit is, in effect, making the demand that a psychical phenomenon, in\norder to prove its reality, must show itself to be a physical pheno-\nmenon. It is an attitude which would seem to be based, not on\nscientific principle (for that, in its essence, is pure empiricism), nor\non any particular specidative or philosophical position, but simply\non an ingrained conviction, taken from practical life, that the world\nof normal sense-perception supplies the criterion of what is probable\nthroughout the universe. Perhaps it goes even further, and suggests\nthat the sensuous world, because it is so familiar, must of necessity\nbe all-inclusive. In any case, the next step is that, non-physical\ncauses being unlikely, non-physical conditions are unimportant.\nIt is a standpoint based on a suggestion rather than on an argument,\nfor its underlying idea is not exphcit but exists as an unformulated\npostulate secreted in the background. No suggestion could be more\ninimical to pioneer work in psychical research than this, for it de-\nstroys at the root the mental freedom which allows itself to be in-\nfluenced equally by all kinds of experience.\nProbably no one can be in touch with facts such as those dealt with\nin Extra-Sensory Perce^^tion without reaching convictions based on\ngrounds which cannot be logically formulated ;\nand the writer\nfeels that he would be faihng to give a comj^lete account of the\nphenomena of E.S.P., as they have fallen within his experience, if\nK\n\f164 G. N. 31. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nhe did not stress the conviction whicli he has of being in touch with\nsomething very real. Tlie demand for logical proof, based on experi-\nment, in such a matter as this, is, of course, an obvious necessity ;\nbut it is doubtful whether, in the last resort, people are as much\nimpressed by logic as they are by sul)tle differences in the character-\nistics of things with which they have grown familiar. There hovers,\nsomewhere behind the normal consciousness, a wide potentiality for\nknowing, which, in moments when tlu' subject is raised a little above\nthe humdrum level of common life, and the frequently jarring ele-\nments of the self unite in a more couconlant synthesis, can reveal\nitself uncertainly in outward s])eech or action ;\nand this state of self-\ntogetherness is marked by a feeling of internal harmony. It is a\nstate which one gets to know more certainly from personal contact\nthan from any numerical ]>roof ; and it is this, together with the\nother psj^chological factors which have been detailed above, which\nform the background of the subject. The writer\u2019s conviction is that\nfuture success in this field is likely to depend largely upon the extent\nto which investigators and critics are both willing to accord these\nconditions adequate recognition. Without this, the state of affairs\nis not very hopeful ; for the conditions which make it possible for\nthese ])henomena to occur are being disregarded, while tlie conditions\nwhich would render them evidentially valid if they did occur are\njealously maintained.\nThe account of the experiments which has been given above\nslimdd be regarded as an interim rej)ort on an investigation which\nis still in progress, and not as a summary of one which is complete.\nSo regarded, these experiments, in the opinion of the writer, warrant\nthe following conclusions : (1) That Extra-Sensory Percej^tion is an\nunquestionable fact. No other ex])lanation will reasonably cover\nthe whole of the evidence. (2) Tliat E.S.P. takes ]>lace when the\npossibility of tele])athy, as ordinarily defined, is excluded. (3) That\nthere is evidence ])ointing strongly in the direction of Precognition.\n(4) That the faculty appears to be able to externalise its material\nin the form of motor action, without a necessary conscious accompani-\nment ;\nand that consequently it is doubtful whether the faculty\nfalls conqdetely within the definition of a cognitive mode. (5) That\nthe records, as well as the subject\u2019s experience, point to the cause of\nabove-chance scoring as being the existence of short periods of\nmental dissociation iii which the rate of scoring successes greatly\nexceeds chance and often apjuoaches 100%. Experience shows that\nthe occurrence of these brief periods of dissociation depends upon a\npsychological background which is largely unknown ;\nbut that it is\ninfluenced by (i) ideas or suggestions which have been accepted by\n\f147] in Extra-Sensory Perception 165\nthe subject\u2019s subliminal and have taken root in it. These may be\nof the most trivial nature, quite without rational foundation and\nmay be simultaneously disbelieved by the subject\u2019s normal con-\nsciousness. (ii) By a general emotional state including interest,\nenthusiasm and happiness on the one hand or disappointment, de-\npression and boredom on the other, (iii) By the subject\u2019s state of\nhealth, which must be good if the right 23sychological state is to\nsupervene. (6) That the external conditions of the exjjeriments\nshould include : (i) The possibility of working at a high rate of\nspeed for two reasons, (a) to allow the paranormal im2:>ulse to run\nthe gauntlet of conscious associations without having time to become\nentangled with them, (6) to avoid tedium, (ii) The possibility of\ndealing rapidly with large numbers of trials in a way which makes\nthe minimum demand on the conscious attention of the subject,\n(hi) The jmssibility of changing the conditions instantly, if jjossible\nwithout the knowledge of the subject, and also without a j^ause, in\nthe middle of a series of trials. (7) That it is necessary for the in-\nvestigator to deal with every subject individually and not to attempt\nto treat subjects en masse. (8) Rhythm in working through a series\nof trials is desirable. (9) The only method which adequately fulfils\nthese demands is a mechanical instrument.\nExtension of the Research\nThe writer\u2019s experience suggests the advisability of deahng with\neach subject separately. But then, it may be asked, if this is done,\nhow is the extra-sensory faculty to be shown to be a human possession\nin the sense of arising out of the normal structure of human per-\nsonality at large, and not to ije a jjathological freak. The Collective\nmethod of research may, on occasion, prove to be a useful auxiliary ;\nbut, in the main, it seems that the method must consist in the estab-\nlishment of a number of centres in each of which an investigator\nmakes an intensive study of two or three selected subjects. In this\nway the various lines of research could be specialised.\nSince E.S.P. constitutes a psychological 2)robleni, it is important\nthat the co-operation of psychologists should be secured in the\nattempt to solve it. What is needed 2\n)erha2\n)s more than anything\nelse at the present time is for the psychologist to devise a technique\nfor the effective control of tliose levels of the self below the conscious\nthreshold, which are concerned in the externalisation of extra-\nsensory material. Such increased control would probably lead to\ngreatly enhanced results with the sensitive type of subject and\nmight even lead to the yielding of results by ordinary, \u201c uiqjsychic\n\u201d\npersons. \\\\ e have above an interesting examj^le in the case of Mr\n\f166 G. N. 31. Tyrrell : Further Research [part\nFisk (see Table XXVI, Nos. 145, 146), who ap])ears to have been\nexalted, in a moment of emotional enthusiasm, based on a rational\nbelief, to the pitch of scoring with a genuine faculty. If this has not\nhappened, there must have been here a remarkable freak of chance.\nWe need to know how to do artificially what occurs spontaneously\nat rare moments such as this ;\nand the incident is one to bear in\nmind as it gives the valuable suggestion that the extra-sensory\nfaculty may not be at all rare as a faculty of perception, but may,\non the contrary, be universal and inherent in the make-up of every\nhuman being. The rare feature may be only its intrusion into con-\nscious life, that is its externalisation. On this view the sensitive\nwould not be a person who owns a rare faculty of perception, but\nonly one in whom the ])ath of emergence is not completely blocked.\nWill not psychologists help us to work out a technique which will\nshorten the tedious ju\u2019ocess l>y which the above results were ob-\ntained ? Will they not give us some readier means of controlling\nthe self l)eneath the threshold ? It is a work well worth the attention\nof orthodox science, since it promises not oidy to light up the recesses\nof the human mind, but also to widen the perceptual channels on\nwhich all knowledge of the outer world depends. We should like\nto know whether the \u201c dissociated \u201d states of sensitives are not, per-\nhaps, many ;\nand if there may not be one of these which in particular\nis necessary for the production of extra-sensory material. We\nshould like to know how to establish the particular state we want.\nWe should like to have, in general, a comjjarison of the make-up\nof the sensitive with that of the non-sensitive, and some sort of map,\nhowever rough, of the country we are trying to explore. If the\nfashion which regards extra-sensory perception as scientifically\ndisreputable would become out of date, a field would be ojjened to\npsychology of the greatest interest and imj^ortance to mankind.\nFinally, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the President\nas well as to the Council of the Society for the kind and generous\nhelp which they have given me, and to various members for their\nencouragement : to Mr Saltmarsh for his constant co-operation and\nadvice and for assisting with his handiwork in the construction of\nthe a])paratus ; to Mr Fisk for his assistance and for his valuable\ndiscovery : to I)r G. C. Poole of New College, Oxford, and to Dr\nR. A. Fisher for mathematical advice ;\nand to Mrs Hemingway as\nwell as to all who have so kindly given their time in acting as\nsubjects.\n\fGh I\nGr:, II\nt\n\u2022\n'\n\u2018\ni\nt\n>\n\u2018\n\u2018\n(4\nU\n<\nj\nI\n!f\n;\nj\ni\nj\n}\n|TFiTITT!TiT;^yi\ni\n[\n\f\f147] in Extra-Sensory Perception 167\nGraph IQ\nI.

Cecil Maby, B.Sc., A.R.C.S., F.R.xl.S.\nFour points in Professor C. D. Broad\u2019s recent presidential address\n(vide Proc. S.P.R., Part 142, vol. XLIII) stimulate me to put for-\nward certain considerations in connection with, extra-sensory per-\nception, resulting from a series of experiments and observations of a\nquahtative kind that I have made during the past few years ^ in a\npersonal attempt to satisfy myself, first, of the genuineness of such\nphenomena and, second, of their psycho-physical modus operandi.\nSpecial attention has been paid to the possible connection between\nsuch cryptopsychic processes as telepathy and clairvoyance and\ncommon-place sensorial perception. Recent observations and\nspeculations by Prof. Hans Driesch, Prof. Broad, Dr Rhuie and others\nhave, in fact, strengthened my own findings and ideas ;\nbut I feel\nthat the time is, as yet, premature for their full discussion. It may,\nhowever, not be amiss for me to advance one or two personal obser-\nvations and ideas in relation to Prof. Broad\u2019s paper without treating\nthe matter upon a statistical basis, despite the present mathematical\nvogue.\n(1) ... Prof. Broad questions whether it would be possible, say,\nfor an Enghshman, ignorant of the French language, to induce\ntelepathically in a Frenchman, who knows no English, \u201c a cognition\nof a fact which the Enghshman knows or a proposition which he\n^ As yet unpublished, except in two recent lectures to the Oxford University\nPsychical Research Association. These experiments were commenced some\nyears ago, before the \\vriter had seen the results of Dr J. B. Rhine\u2019s and Mr\nG. N. M. Tyrrell\u2019s recent experiments.\n169\nL\n\f170 J . Cecil Maby : Some Observations [part\ncognises\". He further recommends experimental investigation of\nsucli a case, as did Mr Saltmarsh also in las report on the Warren\nElliott case, (Froc. S.P.R. vol. XXXIX, p. 128).\nM'ithout having made experiments in this particular direction, it\noccurs to me that, as most of us tend mentally to visuahse our ideas\nquite as commonly as we verbahse them, such an agent\u2019s conception\nmight happen to be translated in visual terms, or even directly, as\npure meaning-content, perhaps, without any recourse to verbal\nsymbologv. Moreover, after its primary (subliminal ?) reception,\nthe percipient might, conceivably, interpret the initial recept in\nterms of his own sensory and\/or verbal symbology ;\ne.g., the French\nlanguage. Such a process would, admittedly, be somewhat romid-\naboxit, but it should not, for that reason, be either impossible or\nimprobable, judging by the various forms that veridical hallucina-\ntions are found to take\u2014especially in spontaneous cases, but also in\n*tlie seance room and even in the laboratory. As Mr Saltmarsh has\nprivatelv ]>ointed out to me. however, there are some \u201c meanings\n\u2019\u2019\nof a generalised nature (he cites emotional moods, tastes, smells, etc.)\nthat might not be translatable into visual symbology. But in\nanswer to that I would ask ; Can emotional moods be supposed\never to exist in a non-specific sense, abstracted from concrete\nsensations and ideas ? Personally, I do not think so. Moreover, it\nis begging the whole question to assume that meanings, as such,\ncannot l)e transmitted directly without translation into sensory\n.'-ymbols. Indeed, evidence is not lacking to indicate that such may\nbe the case, in some instances at least.\n(2) Prof. Broad very justly stresses several seemingly insuperable\ndifficulties in the way of any purely physical explanation of the\nfacts of clairvoyance\u2014which category may, I believe, be fairly ex-\ntended to cover many of tlie phenomena of dowsing, divination and\n\" psychometry\".\nAs one who has not only carried out a fair number of experiments\nin tele])athy, clairvoyance, dowsing and what Dr Rhine conveniently\nterms undifferentiated extra-sensory perception, (in many of which\nwe were fortunate to score a good and significant proportion of suc-\ncesses), but also acted as percipient in the majority of those experi-\nments. I should like to take this opportunity generally to confirm\nProf. Broad\u2019s statement as well as the findings of Dr Rhine, as\nrecently given in his excellent treatise on E.S.P. Perhaps, too, it is\nnot amiss to add the following qualitative observations, in the hope\nthat they may stimulate others either to confirm or to disprove\ncertain speculations that my own experiments and records have\nsugge.sted to me.\n\f148]\non Extra-Sensory Perception 171\nIn our tests, we variously endeavoured to \u201c get \u201d a given object\neither by pure clairvoyance, as with shuffled drawings or with pic-\ntures in an unknown and unopened book ;\nby undifferentiated e.s.p.,\nas with pictures, drawings, or words actually held and observed by\na supposed telepathic agent ;\nand third, by pure telepathy, as when\nthe agent only concentrated his attention on a given mental idea\nor image, not sensorially upon a physical object. In all instances\nwhere the selected object or image was a visual and pictorial one,\nthe extra-sensory perception (if successful) was also a visual one,\nseen against the greyish blank of the vacant mind\u2014much as was\nlately described by Mrs Upton Sinclair, and as in visions of successful\nscryers, etc. When, however, the agent\u2019s \u201c message \u201d was a verbal\none, the percipient\u2019s resultant \u201c hallucination \u201d (\n= e.s.p.) was almost\ninvariably an auditory one, or else a somewhat vague idea of the\ncontent of the \u201c message \u201d, expressing itself in verbal rather than\nvisual symbology. This was particularly noticeable in spontaneous\ninstances of telepathy of a simple kind. But it was also found in\nexperiments in which one of the keys of a piano or else one volume\nout of a case of books of various colours had been mentally pre-\nselected by one or more agents, that an extra-sensory percipient\ntended to decide correctly upon the identical key or book, if the\nagent(s) selected an object visually and specifically ;\nbut that he\nwas often misled into deciding upon any one of the keys of a given\nname, or upon any one book of a given colour, when the agent(s)\nthought was in verbal rather than visual terms.^ That is to say,\ncertain agents tended to transmit generalised and abstract, as con-\ncontrasted with particular and specific ideas ;\ncorresponding to\ntheir individual tendency to think in words and verbal symbols\nrather than in \u201c objective \u201d sensory images.\nIt should be added that the foregoing observations have not\nbeen repeated a sufficient number of times or with enough subjects\nto be deemed conclusive or worthy of statistical analysis ;\nbut our\nqualitative observations, so far as they go, would appear to be both\npositive and significant. In any case, the connection (if any) be-\ntween the initial form of a given object or \u201c message \u201d of e.s.p. and\nthe ultimate form taken by the e.s.p. itself\u2014or else the sensory\nhallucination, should the e.s. stimulus happen to be especially intense\n\u2014is, I think, worthy of careful study. For it would, surely, be a\nfact of the first importance, that there should exist a positive and\nautomatic inter-relationship between the object of extra-sensory\nperception (whether existing physically and objectively, as in cases\n1 This confusion may, of course, have been due to corresponding indecision\nin the agents\u2019 minds, though they themselves denied such indecision.\n\f172 J. Cecil Maby : Some Observations [part\nof clairvoyance, or else psychically and subjectively, as in cases of\ntelepathy) and the derivative e.s.p. itself. The present note, how-\never, is intended merely to draw attention to such an eventuality ;\nfor it may well be that, in the qualitative and somewhat limited\ninvestigation in question, we have voluntarily predisposed ourselves\ntowards forms of sensory \u201c hallucination \u201d {via e.s.p.) corresponding\nin kind to the prime aspects of the original phenomena by virtue of\nexpectation and the selected aims and conditions of the tests. I\ncannot quite believe, however, that the story ends there ;\nfor it is\nnoticeable, in accounts of spontaneous veridical cases of telepathy\nand \u201c travelling clairvoyance\u201d, that there is a remarkable tendency\ntowards such a co-relationship as I have cited. Moreover, I have\nbeen able to trace such a relationship in the maj ority of spontaneous\ninstances of my own collection. It would be a labour well repaid,\ntherefore, for one of our members to re-examine, in the light of the\nforegoing hypothesis, all the veridical cases of extra-sensory per-\nception collected by the S.P.R., as well, perhaps, as some other major\ncollections, such as that of the late M. Camille Flammarion. This\nenquiry I would gladly undertake myself, were it not for pressure of\nmuch other work of an unavoidable kind.\nAs examples of striking agreement between the nature of the\noriginal object or phenomenon and its e.s.p., the following first-hand\nexamples may be of interest, stated as briefly as possible.\n(\u00ab) Visual e.s.p.\nOn a certain occasion I held in my hands, in complete darkness, a\nlarge illustrated book, withoiit opening it or having any normal\nknowledge whatever of its contents ;\nnor was the particular book\nwith its illustrations and the experiment conceivably foreconscious\nin the mind of any other living person at the chosen time, since I\nhad drawn it at random and in the dark from a book-case containing\nvolumes previously unknown to me, and that, too, without the\nnormal cognisance of any other living person.^ Despite the strict-\nness of these conditions, I succeeded in visualising (though but\ndimly, and without the clarity of normal perception or even that of\na vivid dream or hypnagogic illusion,) and describing correctly in\nwriting, before opening the volume, some 33% of the ninety illus-\ntrations it contained. Several of these were, admittedly, repetitive\nin general type {e.g., pictures of mosques and pagodas) ;\nsubsequent\nexamination of the other twenty-three illustrated volumes of the\n^ Actually Vol. 12 of the 14th edn. Encyclopaedia Britannica, of twenty-four\nillustrated volumes, that had freshly arrived and not been previously opened\nby me or others in the house.\n\f148]\non Extra-Sensory Perception 173\ncase, however, showed that my clairvoyant perceptions could only\nhave been said to agree\u2014and then merely in a general and less\nparticular way\u2014with from 1% to 15% of the illustrations in the\nseveral volumes. Such a result was, therefore, highly significant.\nNote that a score of 33% successes is about equal to Miss Johnson\u2019s\naverage score in Mr T}\u2019xreirs experiments in undifferentiated e.s.p. ;\nthough the chances of success by normal guesswork were very much\nlower in the present instance, I believe, in view of the detailed\nnature of the perceptions involved. I should perhaps add that I\ntend about equally to visualise and to verbalise my thoughts and\nimaginations in everyday thinking. Some of these pictures were,\nmoreover, of a sufficiently peculiar kind to be immediately and\nspecifically recognisable on opening the volume for normal visual\nmspection ;\nfor instance, plates opposite pp. 96 and 558, which were\nvery remarkably described as \u201c a kind of stained glass window, con-\ntaimng several mediaeval figures in colour \u201d and \u201c a number of\nvery curious shapes that I cannot quite understand, including a\nlarge X, a row of little ovals, like miniature frames, with squares\nbelow, and what looks like a close view of the human eye\u201d. Eefer-\nence to the volume in question will at once show how dramatically\ncorrect these dim perceptions were. They were, in fact, at once\nand indubitably recognised upon opening and examining the book.\nNote, moreover, that the pictures were seen (a) as if \u201c in a glass,\ndarkly\u201d, (6) of approximately their proper dimensions, (c) normally\norientated, though some were actually face downwards as the book\nwas held ^\n;\nand (d) that, no effort having been made to discern any\nof the verbal matter, no such matter was perceived extra-sensorially,\neven in a blurred and undifferentiated way :\n\u2014which confirms the\nobservations of Dr Ehine and others, namely, that e.s. attention\ncan be directed at will to any one particular object concealed\namong many others opaque to the light and of a mutually conflicting\nkind. 2\n1 In other experiments re the perception of drawings by undifferentiated\ne.s.p., however, the objects were somethnes perceived incorrectly orientated\nor even in fragmentary form. In fact, ordinary spatial relationships were\ncommonly discounted in the e.s.p. (Cf. also similar observations by Richet,\nUpton Sinclair and other previous investigators.)\n- It would apjjear that the skilled diviner or dowser effects the same selection\nunconsciously when he carries a specific sample of the object of enquiry, or\nelse consciously when he simply concentrates mentally on a single objective\nor substance. But I have purposely omitted any consideration of such (highly\nrelevant) phenomena from the present paper, since they appear to call for a\nseparate and more detailed study, dealing with the employment of a rod or\npendidum for the purpose of recording delicate muscular automatisms in\ntelepathic and clairvoyant experiments.\n\f174 J. Cecil Maby : Some Observations [part\nNote, finally, that in another set of tests, the percentage of\nsuccesses was nearer sixty, or nearly doubled, when isolated illus-\ntrations (as judged by the different textures of the leaves of the,\nthen opened, book) were considered individually by e.s.p. This\nobservation\u2014which, of course, also requires repetition on a quanti-\ntative basis\u2014suggests that e.s.p. may be (o) aided by some sort of\ndirection sign, and {b) dependent upon spatio-material factors after\nall ;\nthough tactile hyperaesthesia was not the cause, as I avoided\nany contact with the sheets except at margins.\nThe following example of successful undifferentiated e.s.p. is also\nvery instructive ;\nthough I might equally well have chosen others\nfor their special informativeness :\nMy assistant, completely concealed from me, though in the same\nroom, secretly thought of and drew a conventional heart on a piece\nof paper. As, however, one half was slightly misdrawn, he re-drew\nit in a deeper outline than the other side. He also, of course, con-\ncerned himself mentally more with that half than with the other.\nBy e.s.p. I correctly visualised and drew the darker half of thefigure\nonly. I represented it both correctly oriented and upside down.\nNote that, as this was an undifferentiated case, it is impossible\nto be sure whether clairvoyance or telepathy was responsible for the\nresult. I may say, however, that, in other similar experiments on\nthe transference of drawings by undifferentiated e.s.p., the results\nas a whole pointed to more or less perfect clairvoyance as modus\noperandi. But there were also instances\u2014especially with certain\nagents, whose cerebral processes are known to be relatively fecund\nand intensive\u2014wherein evident telepathy occurred ;\nfor an alter-\nnative object, that the agent had also thought of, but not actually\ndrawn, was successfully registered by the percipient instead of that\ndrawn on the agent\u2019s sheet. So too, if the psycho-galvanic reflex\nis used to detect which object, letter or numeral out of a series has\nbeen mentally pre-selected by a subject, & first choice will generally\nbe more readily detected than a second one, should the subject\nhappen to change his or her mind during the test.\n(6) Auditory E.S.P.\nOne quiet Sunday morning my wife and I were lying in bed awake,\nbut not talking, at about 8 a.m. Our bedroom door and that of our\nsmall boy, R, then aged three, were both ajar to a common landing.\nWe could hear R humming and talking to himself in his cot. Sud-\ndenly it occurred to me to endeavour mentally to \u201c project \u201d myself\nto his room ;\nwhich I did forthwith, without word to my wife or\nany accompanying sounds. In fact, I intently and suddenly imag-\n\f148] on Extra-Sensory Perception 175\niued myself at R\u2019s bedroom door, rapping on it loudly. In instant\nresponse there came a call from his room ;\n\u201c Who\u2019s dat 1 \u201d and\nthen \u201c Daddy 1 \u201d, in an enquiring and startled tone. I explained\nto my wife what had happened on my side, then went in to R, and\nasked him what was the matter. He said ;\n\u201c Someone knocked on\nthe door. You knocked, daddy !\n\u201d\nIt only remains to add that I did not normally knock thus on the\nchild\u2019s door, and that his immediate response and comments were\nequally unusual and dramatically convincing. Note, moreover, the\nexcellent agreement between the determination to knock loudly and\nsuddenly on the door and the resultant e.s.p. I had, in fact, concen-\ntrated on the imaginary act itself and not on transmitting any mere\nidea to R. My wife, incidentally, neither heard nor suspected any-\nthing.\nSeveral equally successful examples of auditory e.s.p. between\nR, my wife and myself have been recorded, but the foregoing will\nsuffice.\n(c) Tactile E.S.P.\nOne evening when he was in the (normally) deepest period of\nsleep, I went very quietly into the same child\u2019s (R\u2019s) bedroom, which\nwas dimly lit by a light shining in from a summer evening sky. I\nfirst stood silently in the room for some three minutes to make sure\nthat R was sleeping soundly and undisturbed by my presence.\nThen, without any actual movement or disturbance, I suddenly\nimagined myself to be laying a cool hand on his forehead. After\ntwo or three seconds, the child sighed, stirred in his sleep, turned\nhis head once or twice from side to side\u2014as one would be inclined\nto do in the circumstances, if real\u2014and finally turned over on to\nhis other side. At the same time, in imagination, I withdrew my\nhand : he then continued to sleep peacefully and I left him.\nThis and several similar experiments made with this child and\nothers possess, I believe, an additional significance in that telepathic\ntransference was successfully achieved during the period of profound\nand apparently dreamless slumber, between one and three hours\nafter the subject had fallen asleep ;\nsuggesting very strongly that\nthe psychic organisation remains accessible throughout the deepest\nphysiological repose. The short delay between the application of\nthe psychic stimulus and the resultant physiological response (also\nobserved on other occasions in two human subjects and a dog)\nmight very well be attributed to physiological rather than psycho-\nlogical sluggishness ;\nit taking, let us suppose, some moments\ndepending upon the depth of bodily slumber\u2014for the psychic will\n\f176 J. Cecil Maby : Some Observations [part\nto bestir the organism and sufficiently to lower synaptic resistances\nwithin the nervous system in order to permit of impulse passage and\nneuro-muscular control.\n[d) Umlifferentiated E.S.P.\nA Miss W., an undergraduate of Celtic race and temperament,\nknown to possess a fair degree of sympathetic \u201c psychic \u201d faculty,\nwas staying in our house. One Sunday evening she was studymg\nalone np in her bed-sittingroom while my wife and I were down-\nstairs in our drawing-room. Miss W., be it noted, was not in the habit\nof coming down to our room, except very occasionally, on some\nparticular errand, nor had we any reason to expect her at the time\nin question. Now it happened that, unknown to Miss W., my wife\nand I had been discussing telepathic phenomena, and we decided,\nthere and then, to see if we could will our guest to come to the\ndrawing-room. Accordingly we both concentrated our thoughts on\nour subject, fancying her in the room upstairs and wishing her to\ncome down to see us. In less than a minute Miss W. knocked at\nour door, and entered. I said :\n\u201c Hullo, M., do you want some-\nthing ?\n\u201d She was, however, very hazy as to her reason for coming\ndown, and excused herself, saymg that she had \u201c wanted to ask us\nsomething, but really didn\u2019t know what it was \u201d ;\nand she thereafter\nseemed to search vainly in her mind for an explanation, looking\nconfused and nonplussed. We then explained what we had done.\niMiss W. agreed that our wishes had undoubtedly been the cause of\nher coming, but could recollect no special sensation or hallucination\nother than a sudden urge, of a vague and non-specific sort, \u201c to\ncome down and see us or ask about something\u201d.\nSubsequently, the experiment was twice repeated successfully and\ntwice failed\u2014probably owing to mental preoccupation of the sub-\nject. On each occasion the motor impulse emerged in the subject\u2019s\nsupraliminal mind as some trifling excuse of her own imagining,\nand there would appear to be little doubt that the extra-sensory\nimpnlse was itself received subliminally ;\nany subsequent or con-\ncomitant sensory-motor act being seemingly analogous to the auto-\nsuggested acts and hallucinations that have been so frequently\nrecorded of suitable subjects during hypnotic and post-hypnotic\nstates.\n(3) The foregoing experiments with Miss W. (and others) also\nremind me that Prof. Broad referred, in his address, to the lack of\nintrospective evidence of any primary awareness in e.s.p. i.e.\nfeelings equivalent to those experienced in connection with the use\nand nwdus operandi of the normal sensory channels\u2014on the part\n\f148] on Extra-Sensory Perception 177\nof clairvoyants, say. Such a statement might be extended to cover\nmany cases of both spontaneous and experimental e.s.p., in which\nactual sensory hallucinations do not occur, but merely generalised\n(usually rather vague or else simple) \u201c feelings \u201d and ideas ;\nalso\nautomatic script, other than that of the \u201c telephone conversation\n\u201d\nvariety, tiptology, divining by rod or pendulum, and other motor\nautomatisms. But it should be borne in mind that we have no\nright, and it is, in fact, begging the question, to term \u201c clairvoyance \u201d\nthat form of metagnomy, common to trance mediums, psycho-\nmetrists, dowsers and diviners, in which the visual sense is not\nstirred into activity. Indeed, the experiences of certain exception-\nally sensitive dowsers, as well as the utterances of mediums such as\nMrs 0. Leonard, and many instances of spontaneous telepathy all\npoint the same moral ;\nnamely, that e.s.p. is primarily a subliminal\nand unconscious affair, which subsequently and quite secondarily, by\nauto-suggestion and bestirring of the imaginative facility, tends to\ncreate a variety of sensory haUucinations, of which visual and\nauditory forms are most common\u2014presumably by reason of our\nhabitual chief usage of those senses.\nNow, if extra-sensory perception is, indeed, always primarily sub-\nhminal and unperceived, as such, then Dr Rhine\u2019s convenient\nexpression (e.s.p.) is seen to be unjustified and undesirable in the\nsame way that \u201c clairvoyance \u201d and \u201c psychometry\u201d as generally\nused, are undesirable. Had we not, then, better restrict ourselves\nto one of the well estabhshed and more general terms, such as\nparagnosis, metagnomy or cryptopsychy ? Of the three, Crypto-\nPSYCHY is, I would suggest, to be strongly recommended on account\nof its non-committal nature.\n(4) Prof. Broad ridicules the idea that there can exist such a\npsychic state as one of \u201c unconscious thought \u201d (vide bottom of\np. 433 to top of p. 434 of his address, loc. cit.) : this with reference,\nI take it, to the supposed mind-reading of his given passive \u201c agent\n\u201d\n(M) by an active \u201c percipient \u201d (N). Thus he says with reference to\ndiscursive cognition : \u201cIn most cases it seems certain that the\nperson from whom the cognition was telepathically derived was not\n1 It would be interesting, in this connection, to find out whether\u2014as one\nsupposes\u2014the pictorial artist and strong visuahser would be prone to clair-\nvoyance as a form of e.s.p. ;\nwhereas the musician, the poet and the literary\ndramatist, say, tended to clairaudience as a general rule. Blind and deaf\n(acquired not bom) persons might also be worth consideration. In Beethoven,\nfor instance, the imaginative power of the \u201c inner ear \u201d remained unimpaired\u2014\npossibly it was enhanced\u2014by the decay of the peripheral organs of hearing : a\ncondition analagous to that of the maimed soldier, who feels pains in a limb\nthat no longer exists.\n\f178 J.

And of\nthe idea of unconscious, or sublimmal, thought on the part of the\n\u201c agent \u201d he remarks :\n\u201c This, however, would be a wholly gratui-\ntous assumption for which there is no independent evidence, and I\nshall ignore it.\u201d\nBy denying the existence of miconscious activity. Prof. Broad\nwould appear to deny those multifarious activities of the dreaming,\nsubliminal,^ hypnotic and entranced mind and of sub-personalities,\netc., that have been so prolifically recorded by students of Psycho-\nlogy and Psychic Science. Of those copious phenomena Prof. Broad\nhimself is, naturally, well aware ;\nand to anyone who has witnessed\nthem their reality is beyond all manner of doubt. Yet Prof. Broad\nwould appear to maintain the belief that psychic acts are invariably\nand solely supraliminal ;\nalthough I understand that he is prepared\nto accept the existence and \u201c potential energy \u201d of subliminal\nmemories in a latent and quiescent state\u2014as memory traces, not\nas active thoughts, ideas and sensations, that is to say. Critical\nanalysis, however, shows, as J. Buys, in his work on the functions\nof the brain, argued many years ago, that every single rmit\u2014or\nmoment-content, as Sidis termed it.\u2014of conscious thought is so\ncomplexly conditioned by and dependent upon a co-existent multi-\nplex system of other mental (and\/or cerebral) units that it cannot\npossibly be considered as an isolated or momentary phenomenon.\nNow suppose that a moment-content of (fore)consciousness be\nlikened to one out of a succession of notes forming a tune as played\nby an automatic pianola ;\nthen the pianola keyboard, strings, etc.\nmay be taken to represent the animal\u2019s entire central nervous\nsystem, the electric motor or other source of power to represent its\nvital energy, and the perforated roll to be equivalent to the whole\nsubliminal, but coexistent ideational content of the mind, that\nconditions and precisely determines each individual note of the\nmelody or thought-train. But most significant of all, the initial\ncomposer of the music will find his counterpart in the individual\nWill or Central Psyche of the animal personality in question, whose\njjurposeful and, in some unknown manner, energetic guidance and\ncontrol first determine the melody, and then utilising the mechanical\nenergy, precipitate, as it were, into space and rnatter (as bodily\n1 In fully developed automatism\u2014as I have satisfied myself by means of an\nautomatic recorder connected to a specially arranged tiptological device\nthe foreconscious mind, or primary personality, if you will, can occupy itself\nconversationally, say, while the other component involuntarily spells out\ncoherent \u201c messages \u201d, and supplies, may be, cryptopsychic information into\nthe bargain.

But it is important to note that ideas and mental\nunits must, surely, first possess some real energy of their own before\nthey find supraliminal expression in consciousness and physical\naction, no matter whether such energy be termed potential or\nactual\nFrom this analogy\u2014in the general correctness of which I, per-\nsonally, place my faith, despite such crudities and imperfections as\nit may entail\u2014we see that there is every reason to assume the co-\nexistence of vast ideational complexes or thought trains in what may\nconveniently be termed, with Myers, the subliminal mind. More-\nover such psychic entities should not even be thought of as serial\nstructures\u2014except for the artificial jiurposes of psychoanalysis.\nThey are, rather, integrated and unified in the sense that a natural\npanorama is, in fact, integrated and unified ;\nand they only appear\nto possess a serialism or \u201c grain \u201d (like the pictures of a cinema film\nor the perforations of a pianola roll) when spatio-materialised and\nanalysed in the form of speech and writing or other pantomime.\nContinuity, however, may be re-constituted when these symbols\nhave been somehow absorbed and translated back into thought in\nthe mind of another animal of the same race and species ;\nthough\nseldom in perfect agreement with the original, unfortunately.\nThe sum of the foregoing argument is this : that there is every\nreason, logically speaking, to suppose that the spot-light of what\nwe term attention or awareness only illuminates a very small and\ntrifling patch of the whole vast content of the otherwise sensorially\nsubhminal mind ;\nmuch as the policeman\u2019s bull\u2019s-eye throws light\nupon but a trifling fragment of some great city, of the rest of the\nmachinations of which he is, at that instant, blissfully ignorant.\nNow, for the policeman to state that the rest of the world was non-\nexistent or inactive, simply because he had no perception of it,\nwould clearly be unpardonable. In like manner, I suggest, that it is\nunpardonable to speak of the subhminal mind as being necessarily\naltogether quiescent or latent\u2014much less non-existent\u2014simply be-\ncause the moving beam of foreconsciousness happens to illuminate\nit only point by point. Indeed, had not our primary psychic intelli-\ngence a very much wider grasp of the mental structures under its\ncontrol than we imagine it to have, when we deny the existence of\nunconscious thought, etc., coherent and logical reasoning would be\nimpossible ;\nstill more so the \u201c inspirations \u201d of genius.\nI gather that Professor Broad, while admitting the existence of\nthe subliminal mind, with its memories, as a sort of reservoir or\nmore or less materialistic filing cabinet, would differ from the view\n\f180 J. Cecil Maby : Some Observations [part\nhere sponsored, in that he would deny actual activity to the sub-\nliminal mind, and prefer to regard it as a potential state of knowing,\nor \u201c disposition \u201d to know, certain facts i.e., memories and\nexperiences.\nEveryone is familiar with the experience of havmg had some\nargument or idea all ready worked out in the back of his mind for\nexposition, and then accidentally lost the tag or clue to the whole\naffair, while knowing full well that it was still there and active, in\nthe sense of being \u201c on the tip of the tongue \u201d ;\nthough temporarily\n\u201c potential \u201d and somehow inhibited from emerging into full fore-\nconsciousness :\n\u2014then we may safely affirm that subconscious ideas\nand aggregates can and do exist in a subliminal phase, latent and\n\u201c unconscious \u201d ^ if you will, but none the less real and \u201c vibrant\u201d.\nTheir dynamism, however, happens either to be below the energy\nlevel at which they cause nerve impulses to overflow at the synapses,\nthus setting in action various neuro-muscular mechanisms, and\nexpressing themselves objectively and consciously, or else they\nsimply happen to lie, temporarily, out of the immediate focus of\ninterested attention.\nIf, then the entire mind, with all its memory and ideational con-\ntent be termed the subliminal, \u201c subconscious\u201d, or \u201c unconscious\n\u201d\nmind ;\nthe supraliminal or foreconscious region may be said to\nconsist merely of a relatively minute and peak-like portion, which\nhas, through force of subjective or objective circumstances, momen-\ntarily risen to such an energy level\u2014to use a physical expression\nas to surge up and \u201c spill over \u201d or, \u201c precipitate itself \u201d in the form\nof neuro-muscular and sensory activity.

We cannot, however, usually quite deflne or grasp\nthis great residuum ;\nthough we can, with a little introspection, sense\nthat it gradually and in many diverse directions links up with and\nroots deep iirto the rest of our potential, latent or subliminal mind.\nWe also know that the pattern and content of each association\nplexus is subject to subliminal modiflcation and that fresh associa-\ntions are ljuilt up without any conscious and voluntary attention\non our part, as primary personality or \u201c observer number one\u201d.\n1 Naturally I jJrefer the term subliminal to either subconscious or uncon-\nscious, as it appears more truly to tit both psychological and physiological facts.\n\f148]\non Extra-Sensory Perception 181\nThe entire mind, therefore, may be supposed\u2014and, indeed,\ndirectly \u201c felt\n\u201d\u2014to exist at an infinite number of energy levels, of\nsome sort, proportionate to the relative intensity of what we call\nconsciousness.

Reasoning thus, it is conceivable that a crypto-\npsychic percipient should successfully \u201c tap \u201d and cognise the\ncontents of a given \u201c passive \u201d agent\u2019s mind, provided that such\ncontents possessed a fair positive energy value, even though they\nwere below the limen of consciousness of their proper owner at the\ngiven time. In that case, \u201c mind reading \u201d might be accepted as a\nvery fair term to describe the process.\nFinally, it seems hkely to me, all things considered, (1) that\nconsciousness 7nay very well be concomitant with the passage of nervous\nimpulses across a synapse : \u2014no overflow, no consciousness or aware-\nness ;\nand (2) that the relative intensity of consciousness may be\nrepresented as a joint function of the relative resistivity of the active\nsynapses and of their applied nervous potentialsd\nConsciousness, thus regarded, is equivalent to a physiological\nprocess : the precipitation, so to say, of something out of mind and\ntime into matter and space, or the materialisation of an idea. In\nthese circumstances also, when a sensory impulse across the synapses,\ndue to the stimulation of the peripheral nerve endings, occurs, the\nreverse thing will happen : consciousness will again arise in the\norganism\u2019s body-bram system, and a memory thereof be stored in\nthe immaterial and temporal psychic organisation. In what manner\nsuch translations may occur I do not, of course, pretend to know ;\nand I freely admit the dfificulties of comprehension that he in the\nway of any such hypothesis as that ably put forward by the two\nBousfields in their provocative work \u201c The Mind and its Mechanism\u201d.\nSimilar difficulties, however, exist in modern physics in regard to\nthe problems of material radiation and absorption of energy. So\nthat we need not be imduly disheartened by any mere difficulty of\ncomprehension, especially since there appear to be good reasons\nfor the purely mechanistic of physical memory traces to fall into\ndisrepute, as McDougall and others have already pointed out.\nBut besides auto-consciousness, thus considered as a semi-mechan-\nical affair, there is also, undeniably, a second factor, namely attention,\n1 The magnitude of the resultant nerve current might be roughly equivalent\nto the intensity of sensation, and a law similar to Ohm\u2019s law for electrical\nconduction might be found to express the whole situation, speaking from the\nphysiologist\u2019s point of view.\n\f182 J. Cecil Maby [part 148]\nwhich is clearly controllable by the Will. And this is true to such an\nextent that either (a) elements that would otherwise remain un-\nconscious, or but dimly so, can be voluntarily stimulated into action\nby proper searching and focusing with the spot-light of attention,\nor {b) strongly auto- and sensorially stimulated elements can be\nmore or less disregarded in favour of weaker ones, by a voluntary\ndiversion of attention. I mention this aspect of consciousness, in\npassing, lest it should be thought that I favour a purely mechanistic\nand materialistic view of the nature of Mind and Will\u2014which is\nfar from being so. I do believe, however, that one cannot safely\nafford to neglect the nervous mechanism\u2014memory traces or no\nmemory traces\u2014and the various formations, limitations and reper-\ncussions that it patently impresses upon the mind and spirit of its\nown metaphysical possessor and, one may perhaps believe, original\ncreative architect, the individual Ego or central psyche. In other\nwords, the central psyche may be supposed to represent not only\nthe initiator and foundation stone of the living organism, considered\nboth mentally and bodily, but also the final recipient and beneficiary\nof the psychophysical experiences of that organism during its\nincarnate existence.\n\fSOME COMMENTS ON MR TYRRELL\u2019S PAPER ON\nINDIVIDUALITY\nBy H. F. Saltmarsh\nIn his most interesting and suggestive article on Individuality\npublished in Proceedings XLIV, Mr Tyrrell discusses a problem\nwhich is fundamental both for psychical research and philosophy.\nAs a full and free discussion of this matter may possibly result in\nsome hght being thrown upon its obscurities I venture to make a\nfew comments on his arguments and to put forward a few sugges-\ntions. Though I should succeed in accomplishing nothing towards\na solution of the many difficulties, it may be that, if the ball be\nkept rolling, others far better qualified than myself will be tempted\nto take a hand in the game even if only for the satisfaction to be\nderived from exposing the errors of other people.\nMr Tyrrell\u2019s first question, \u201c What is it that is characterised by\nword association tests ?\n\u201d contains, as questions frequently do,\nseveral tacit assumptions. He assumes, for example, that some form\nof dualism as regards body and mind hold good. If one adopted a\nmonistic theory the answer to his question is obvious. As there is\nonly one element in personality it must be that which is characterised\nby the word association tests, assuming, as I suppose we do, that\nthey actually characterise something.\nHowever it seems pretty clear that whatever type of theory be\nadopted, whether, that is to say, one is a monist, a dualist or a\npluralist, whether one accepts emergence or not, the physical, if\nthere be such, must play some part in the word association tests,\nthe psychogalvanic reflex and all the rest ;\nfor the response to these\ntests is given by means of the physical organism just as the tests\nthemselves are received through it. Even if one be a subjective\nidealist of the purest water and deny altogether the reality of matter\nthere is always that inconvenient illusion of matter which will mix\nitself up in all our doings ;\nand even an illusion, especially one which\nis so good an imitation of reality, can produce its effect. Further,\nMr Tyrrell assumes the stratification hypothesis, i.e. that hypo-\nthesis which postulates levels and thresholds in the mind. I do not\ndoubt that his question could be framed to make it applicable to the\nmonadic hypothesis equally as well.\nHis second question, which deals with survival, contains several\nother assumptions besides those mentioned above.\n183\n\f184 H. F. Saltniarsh : Some Comments on [part\nIf the stratification hypothesis be adopted we cannot assume\nwithout examination that the division between supra- and subliminal\npersists after death. It may quite well be that this is imposed on\nthe mind solely as the result of its incarnation and that it is not an\nintrinsic feature of mental structure. On the monadic hypothesis\nit may be the whole hierarchy of monads which survives, or the\ndominant and some of the subordinates, the dominant alone or else\nsome supra-dominant monad, if such there be\u2014what Myers called\nthe transcendental self. I suppose that it is theoretically possible\nthat the only survivor might be one or a group of the subordinate\nmonads, though it is doubtful in such case whether that would be\ncalled a survival of the personality. There are other possibilities\nwhich I will not mention lest I become too tedious.\nFurther Mr Tyrrell assumes that the separation between mind and\nbody is complete at death. Doubtless the gross physical body is\ndestroyed but I do not think that Sir Oliver Lodge\u2019s suggestion of\nan etheric body can be summarily dismissed. I do not know of any\npositive evidence for its existence but it is at least a possibility. And,\nif I may make an even more fantastic suggestion, it is theoretically\npossible that some very small part of the physical body escapes at\ndeath and remains attached to the mind. Until incredibly accurate\nand apparently impossible experiments in weighing, etc., just before\nand just after death have been performed this cannot be entirely\nruled out. I admit that the suggestion is perhaps absurd and not to\nbe taken seriously, all I claim is that it is not impossible.\nMy object in mentioning these alternatives is to show that the\nwhole matter is so complex, that what little knowledge we have is\nso vague and unreliable, that speculation is, to say the least, pre-\nmature ;\nbesides we are by no means sure that there is survival at all.\nMr Tyrrell then asks, \u201c What is individuality ?\n\u201d\nNow it seems to me that Individuality is a relative term. What\nmay properly be termed an individual from one point of view a,nd\nfor one purpose of discourse, is equally properly termed a plurality\nfrom another point of view and for another purpose. A chair is\nundoubtedly individual if I want to sit on it, but to the cabinet\nmaker who is making it each leg is an individual. Mr Tyrrell says\nthat a block of water is \u201c just stuff \u201d, but some blocks of water, such\nas, for example, waves on the sea, may be highly individual and\nmust, in certain circumstances, be treated with the respect due to an\nindividual, as those who are accustomed to sailing in small boats\nknow only too well. If they are not so treated they may make their\nindividuality felt in unpleasant fashion by breaking aboard and\nfilling you up. The lines of demarcation by which we divide up\n\f148]\nMr TyrrelVs Paper on Individuality 185\nthe external world into individuals are purely arbitrary and this\napphes to some extent to human beings as well as to inanimate\nobjects. We may legitimately speak of Parliament as an individual,\nor of the various subdivisions thereof, such as the Cabinet or the\nOpposition, as individuals, yet they are all made up of individual\nmembers.\nBut as regards the self I think that the position is somewhat\ndifferent. In spite of all the facts which seem on the face of them to\npoint to the opposite conclusion, I have an inescapable conviction\nthat I am, somehow or other, fundamentally one and only one person.\nBehind the phenomena of dissociation, multiple personality, sub-\nconscious mentation etc. there looms the unitary I.\nIt may be that this instinctive conviction of unity is nothing more\nthan an illusion, or perhaps an a priori form of thought. If the\ncategory of number be imposed on reality by the mind in the same\nway as Kant taught that time and space are imposed, then the real\npersonality is neither one nor many. However, as we cannot help\nthinking in these terms it seems that we are ultimately forced back\nto unity if we carry our analysis far enough, for the simple reason\nthat, having arrived at unity, we can go no further. The unity at\nwhich we arrive may not, of course, be a personality. Atomistic\ntheories of consciousness are rather discredited nowadays, but\nthere are others more respectable which take this standpoint, e.g.\nProfessor Broad\u2019s theory wherein the self is held to be made up of a\nphysical body and a psychic factor, neither of which, if capable of a\nseparate existence, would be a self. Further, it may be that the\nunity of the self is an unity of form or structure rather than an unity\nof substance, just as the unity of the physical body persists in spite\nof the change which goes on in the cells which compose it, or as\nParliament remains an unity though some members may resign or\ndie and be replaced by others. But then the question arises. Is not,\nin the last resort, everything which exists only form and is pure\nsubstance anything more than a metaphysical abstraction ?\nMacTaggart defined substance as that which possesses qualities\nand stands in relation yet is not itself a quality or a relation. If\nthis be a correct definition it seems that individuality can only\nattach to substance in virtue of the qualities which it possesses,\nthat is to say in virtue of its form.\nHowever if Bergson be right, form is continually changing, so we\ncannot base individuality on the persistence of form. All that is\nleft for us is some sort of continuity of history. I do not profess to\nbe competent to form an opinion on the validity of BergsonA doc-\ntrine, but, whether it be universally true or not, I think that it is\n\f186 H. F. SaUmarsh : Some Comments on [part\nol)vious that most of the individuals with whom we are acquainted\nare forms in a state of flux and that the usual criterion which we\napply is the presence or absence of continuity of history. It is true\nthat we do not always demand unbroken continuity when applying\nthis criterion but are willing to overlook some gaps. I think that\nthis would give the answer to Mr Tyrrell\u2019s question about the man\nwho lost and then recovered his memory.\nAfter all, as I have said above, individuality is relative to the point\nof view and this may be well exemplifled by the hypothetical case\nwhich he cites. Whatever view a psychologist might take as to the\npersistence of individnality in such a case, there is no doubt that a\nlawyer would hold that loss of memory would not entail loss of\nindividuality, that rights, such as ownership of property, and duties,\nsuch as liability for debts, would remain nnaltered.\nThe psychologist, however, wonld very probably not accept the\nlegal standpoint, unless he happened to be one of the man\u2019s creditors,\nand it would then depend on what criterion he employed in judging\nindividuality and how strictly he applied that criterion. If contin-\nuity of memory be adopted, he must be prepared to decide whether\nthe gap is or is not sufficiently large to constitute change in individ-\nuality, for gaps of some size he must in any case overlook. But he\nmight take continuity of moral and intellectual character as his\ncriterion, he might say for example that the man remains morally\nand intellectually the same individual, subject, of course, to the\neffect of the shock of loss of memory. But as his character is always\nchanging under the influence of events which happen to the man,\nthis shock, though exceptionally far-reaching and sudden in its\neffects, can be considered as essentially the same in kind as any other\nof the events which are continually causing change.\nThat there are difficulties in the matter of individuality no one\nwill deny. Consider the case of the amoeba which propagates by\nsimple fission. Is the parent cell identical with both or either of the\ntwo daughter cells or not ? From one point of view it is clearly not\nidentical, yet Weisemann founded his doctrine of the potential\nimmortality of the cell on this phenomenon.\nThe phenomena of multiple personality are even more puzzling,\nin particular those cases where two of the secondaries have been\nfused into one by treatment. We might perhaps sidestep this diffi-\nculty by holding that where two apparently separate secondary\npersonalities are thus fusible, the separateness is only illusory and\nthey are really different phases of the same personality. So far as\nmy recollection of the cases goes, successful fusion has always been\nbetween secondaries which were more or less complementary to one\n\f148]\nMr Tyrrell\u2019s Paper on Individuality 187\nanother : I doubt whether any attempt at fusion would be made by\nthe physician were this not so.\nBut I think that it may be said that these and other equally well-\nestablished facts do, at the least, show that the ordinary common-\nsense view of personality as an indivisible entity cannot be accepted.\nWhat they do not show is the alternative which should be accepted\nas correct ; hence all the array of different theories.\nI have mentioned so far only the monistic and the dualist types,\nthere are, however, theories which postulate more than two different\nkinds of element.\nIt seems to me that there is much to be said for a theory somewhat\non the lines of the old-fashioned orthodoxy of body, soul and spirit.\nSuch a theory is to be found in a highly elaborated form in the\nVedanta. There the Atman, or real spiritual self, is what I suppose\nmust be called supra-individual, it transcends all categories when\nfreed by eidightenment from the bonds of illusion. It is that which\ngives unity to the individual when conjoined to and informing the\ncombination of the other factors, viz. body and life. The theory, as\npresented in the Vedantic books is extremely complex and difficult\nto understand, perhaps impossible for most Western minds, but the\ngeneral idea is clear and might form a basis for a less elaborate\nhypothesis which would possibly be acceptable.\nMyers speaks of a transcendental self and if one takes this to\nbelong to an order of nature totally different from the physical and\npsychic factors we have the materials for a pluralistic hypothesis.\nWe should then have the physical body and the psychic factor,\nwhether in the form of a stratified consciousness or a hierarchy of\nmonads, forming a living organism ;\nthis would be informed by the\ntranscendental self, which, though in its essential nature supra-\nindividual, would contribute to the whole that unity of which, I\nimagine, we all have an inescapable conviction. The relation be-\ntween the transcendental self and the living organism might be\nthought of as an unilateral relation of coconsciousness, that is to say,\nthe transcendental self is coconscious to the fullest extent with the\nmonads or stratified muid, but they are not coconscious with it.\nAs a rough illustration of what I mean one could imagine an actor\nwho threw himself so thoroughly into his parts that while he was\nactually acting he almost became for the time being the imaginary\npersonahty whom he was portraying. Suppose that it was Irving\nplaying Hamlet, then Hamlet-Irving would represent the \u201c me as I\nknow myself \u201d but would know nothing of the real Irving ;\nthe real\nIrving, however, would know all about Hamlet-Irving.\nI refrain from elaborating this idea any further, but 1 imagine\n\f188 Some Comments on Individuality [part 148]\nthat Mr Tyrrell must have had something of this sort in his mind\nwhen he wrote, on page 11,\n\u201c It would seem that we must be wrong\nin speaking of individuality in the plural and equally wro7ig in speak-\ning of it m the singular. Individuality would be something not\nsubject to the category of number\u201d.\nOn such an hypothesis one could imagine that the relations be-\ntween the monads or strata, whichever they may be, which consti-\ntute the second factor, would be telepathic, as has been suggested\nby Lord Balfour, and I suggest further that such telepathy would be\nInteractional Telepathy. As regards the relations between the\ntranscendental self and the psychic factor I would suggest that these\nalso are of the nature of telepathy, but in this case they would be of\nthe kind which Professor Broad calls Intermental Confluence ;\nit\nwould, however, be non-reciprocal, a sort of one-way traffic.\nThis brings me to the last point in Mr Tyrrell\u2019s paper on which I\nbeg leave to make some comment. On page 9 he speaks of \u201c sharing\nan experience \u201d and \u201c direct prehension by two minds of the same\nexperience \u201d ;\non page 10 he says \u201c it looks uncommonly like as if\nthere were a sharing of experience\u201d.\nMay I venture to suggest that he has overlooked an important\nconsideration I Any experience whatsoever is not a simple, clear-\ncut mental event with sharp edges and clearly defined bormdaries,\nrather it is an inseparable part of an organic whole which, if forcibly\ntaken out of that whole, becomes something different. Every mental\nevent occurs against a background and is to some extent coloured\nby that background. The background is made up of elements from\nthe entire past history of the individual experiencing the event.\nMoreover, an event, to be in consciousness at all, must be recognised\nas such and such however vague such recognition may be and this\nrecognition is determined largely by past experience.\nI suggest therefore that every mental event contains within itself\nelements derived from the whole past history of the individual. I\nhate to use the word \u201c impossible\u201d, it smacks too much of omni-\nscience, so I will content myself with saying that it is highly improb-\nable that any two numerically distinct individuals should have\nidentical histories and, in consequence, exactly identical backgrounds\nagainst which their experiences occur.\nOf course all this is simply a restatement of the fundamental\nprinciple of \u201c The Unique Ownership of Experience \u201d as laid down\nby Professor Broad.\nIn view of these considerations I cannot see how two persons can\nshare an exactly identical experience and, if this be so, it seems\nneedless to discuss hypotheses based upon such a sharing.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 149\nTHE QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF TRANCE\nPERSONALITIES\nBy Whately Carington, M.xT., M.Sc.\nIll\nIntroductory'\n1\nGeneral : Towards the end of my last paper on this sidjject [Q.S.T.P.,\nII, Proc. S.P.R. Part 141) I briefly described a preliminary attempt\nto investigate the autonomy of the two communicating controls\nknown as \u201c John \u201d and \u201c Etta This depended on obtaining re-\nactions (times and reproductions) to word association tests given to\nthe ]3ersonalities concerned when manifesting through two different\nmediums, iMrs Leonard and Mrs Sharplin. I attempted to eliminate\nthe effects due to the nrediums themselves by the method of partial\ncorrelation \u201d, and I obtained positive results which indicated that\nsome extraneous cause was at work other than any similarity which\nmight exist between the mediums themselves.\nFortunately, I guarded myself fairly thoroughly against possible\nimperfections of the method used, for Professor Fisher has kindly\npointed out that it is not to l)e relied upon in the context. The\nreason, as I understand it, is broadly speaking this : that wherever\nthe eliminated variables (in tliis case the data obtained from the\ntwo mediums in their normal states) are themselves lial)le to error,\nthe resultant partial correlation coefficients are always likely to be\ntoo large ;\nprecise results are obtainable only when the values of\nthe eliminated variables are known -with exactitude {e.g. dates).\nThe figures in question must accordingly be discarded, but the work\n189\nM\n\f190 Whately Caringfon, 21. A., 21.Sc. [rART\nhas at any rate served a nsefiil purpose in encouraging the experi-\nment discussed below which has led to extremely promising results.\nThe main material used consists of the data obtained by Mr\nDrayton Thomas in five special sittings with Mrs Leonard and five\nwith Mrs Sharplin held on various dates in Sej^teniber, October and\nNovember 1935. I have also, as will be seen, made certain com-\njrarisons of importance between this material and that obtained from\nMrs Leonard and Feda, and from John and Etta, in 1933 and from\nthe two first in the Irving experiment of 1934.\nThe list of words used in the Leonard-Sharplin tests was the same\nas that for the last-mentioned experiment ;\nthat is to say, it was\nderived from the words of the original (1933) list by substituting for\neach a word more or less closely associated with it. (Cf. Q.S.T.P.,\nII, p. 349.)\nIt may be said at once that, to superficial inspection, the Sharplin\ndata were singularly unpromising. Mr Drayton Thomas, from a\nstudy of the responses, reported to the effect that he could find\nnothing at all suggestive of either John or Etta, while I myself, after\na preliminary examination of the figures, regarded a negative out-\ncome as a foregone conclusion to be worked out and recorded only\nfor the sake of formal completeness. That results so well-marked\nas those actually obtained should ultimately have emerged consti-\ntutes a remarkable testimonial, so to speak, to the jmwer and sensi-\ntivity of the method ultimately employed, for which I am more\nindebted than I can easily express to Mr W. L. Stevens of the Galton\nLaboratory. I must also record here my gratitude to Mr L. H. C.\nTippett (Author of The 21ethods of Statistics) for timely help at a\ncritical moment.\nI do not propose to overburden this 2\n)aper (which in any event is\nbound to be almost unreadable) by describing in detail how, desjjite\nprolonged residence abroad, I maintained the old English charac-\nteristic (according to my Continental friends) and \u201c tried all the\nwrong ways first \u201d ;\nbut I think the final stages will be more com-\n])rehensible if I first deal with certain \u201c routine \u201d evaluations and\ncomparisons. This will at least show the liopelessness of applying\nordinary methods to the main ^Ji'oblem involved ;\nmoreover some\nof the results are of very considerable intrinsic interest, and ajjpear\nto illuminate to an aj^jmeciable if incomjfiete extent the nature of the\n2\n)sychological mechanisms with which we are dealing.\n2\nNotation, abbreviations, etc. : In what follows, ET stands for\nEeaction Time(s), RPN for Reproduction(s), or for tests on these\n\f149]\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 191\nobservables.

This implies the not-unimportant con-\nclusion that they are derived from, or based upon, much more stable\nstrata of the total personality or \u201c psyche \u201d than those which deter-\nmine the reactions of the normal consciousness. We shall fin d\nfurther confirmation of this, in the case of L and F, when we come\nto consider the Intra-group comparisons.\nThe communicators in the Leonard-Sharphn Experiment come\nbetween the mediums and controls, the comparable figures being\nJ & E - -21870 ;\nJ' & E' - -25435\nwhile for the First Thomas Experiment the comparable figure is\nJ & E - - - - -9490\nwhich is less than the value for either L or F. There is accordingly\nhere a suggestion that, in this respect, communicators resemble\nnormal mediums more than they do controls ;\nbut the difference is\neasily shown to be insignificant (though it may, of course, be real\ndespite this), while the Irving communicator \u201c Dora \u201d (D) is, faintly,\nanomalous. Poohng all data and taking means all round, we have\nMediums -2295. Communicators -2667. Controls -3743.\nThe communicators (which here include D) clearly favour the\nnormal mediums, though only to a shght extent ;\nthe fact may,\nperhaps, be taken to suggest that communicators are more like\nnormal people than they are like secondary personahties, such as\nI consider Feda and Silver to be. But it would be unwise to attach\nappreciable weight to this.\nApart from the rather poor showing of Leonard on RPN and\nSharplin on RT, there is nothing more here that is worth noting,\nunless it be that Silver\u2019s figure of 52-7 per cent, for RT is the highest\nconsistency yet recorded.\n^ In the above S.E. is the Standard Error of the difference concerned. We\nmay also here conveniently note the following errata in Q.S.T.P., II, Table II\nIn RN 42, for -2378 read -2738 ;\nin RN 43, for -4642 read -4588.\n\f194 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nB. Intra-Group Comparisons\n5\nThe relationships of similarity and difference between the person-\nalities forming the Leonard and Sharphn groups, within those\ngroups, are shown in Table II. I have added the figures for percen-\ntage similarities, obtained by the method already indicated, but I\nhave not thought it worth while to work the covariances, such as\nwere given in Q.S.T.P., II. These are laborious to evaluate and, as\na rule, of very little interest. At the foot of the Table I have added\na number of percentage similarities from earlier experiments for\npurposes of comparison. The symbols, etc., have their usual mean-\nings, but I have halved the probabilities for similarity, as indicated\n(P\/2), so as to show the chance of a value of the observed magnitude\nand in the observed sense (similar or countersimilar) being obtained\naccidentally. . .\nI have restricted the work to the more evidently important types\nof comparison. We are naturally interested in the relationships of\ncontrols and communicators to theic mediums and of the communi-\ncators to each other ;\nbut the relationships between controls and\ncommunicators seem of little importance at the present time, and\nnothing is to be gained by overburdening the work with irrelevant\nfigures merely for the sake of achieving a formal completeness.\n6\nThe first point to be noted is that, on RT, Feda is again counter-\nsimilar to her medium; thus clinching if need be, the point made in\nQ.S.T.P., II, regarding her status as a secondary personality.\nSilver, it will be noted, is not countersimilar to normal Sharphn,\nbut his similarity is so altogether trifling, that it seems more reason-\nable to ascribe it to chance errors than to maintain that he is of a\ndifferent psychological type from Feda and to create a new category\nfor him.\nActually, Feda is slightly similar, in this case, to J and E (the\nfigures are not given in the Table) ;\nso that, taking all known com-\nparisons within the Leonard manifold into account, including those\nwith \u201c prepared \u201d Leonard and those of the Second Thomas Experi-\nment, we have\n-1- ve - ve Total\nFeda Comparisons - - 4 9 13\nOther \u201e - 13 2 15\nTotal - - 17 11 28\n\f195\n149]\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Persocialities\nwhich gives, using \u201c Yate\u2019s adjustment \u201d for small numbers,\n^2 \u2014 0.\n93_ P less than -01 3090\nas the chance of the effect being accidental.\n7\nWe may next consider the LL and FF comparisons (RN 3017 & 8,\n3027 & 8). These are between the normal Leonard and Feda data\nrespectively for this (Leonard-Sharphn experiment), and the Irving\nExperiment of 1934, in which, as already stated, the same hst of\nwords was used.\nNote first the negligible similarity and highly significant difference\nbetween the two sets of L reaction times, and contrast with these\nthe very high similarity and neghgible difference of the correspond-\ning figures for F. Just as Feda was much more consistent than\nLeonard over the short period covering this experiment, so she\nshows herself enormously more stable over the (approximately) nine\nmonths interval separating the two experiments. The difference is\nsignificant, for we have :\nDifference in z\u2019s = -3822. S.E. = -14213. P = -01 3091\nPerverting the poet, we might almost say of Feda \u201c Time can-\nnot wither, nor custom stale, her infinite consistency \u201d. She is\nevidently derived from strata far less susceptible to the influence\nof current events than those which we recognise as \u201c normal\nLeonard \u201d.\nThe effect is not nearly so marked in the case of RPN. This is in\naccordance with the view, which I have always maintained, that\nthe reproduction test penetrates to deeper levels than does that for\nreaction times. It thus strikes more permanent elements in Leonard\nthan RT does ;\nbut this circumstance is irrelevant in the case of\nFeda, because, when she is tested, whether on RPN or RT, the deep\nlayers from which she is derived are already uppermost, so that the\nsuperior penetration of RPN has no scope.\n8\nConnected also with the foregoing is, presmnably, the markedly\ngreater differences which the controls F & S' show from their\nmediums, in respect of RT, compared with those shown, on the\nwhole, ,by communicators. The latter are somewhat \u201c freer \u201d, as\njudged by this criterion of difference, at the RPN than at the RT\n\f196 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

The reverse is the case with communicators, but I doubt\nwhether we are entitled to take the significance of the value -3162\nas assurance that this reversal is real. There is, however, a pretty\nstrong suggestion to the effect that at the deeper level reached by\nRPN controls converge while communicators diverge with respect to\ntheir medium, the former becoming more and the latter less hke her.\nSo far as it goes, this affords fairly strong evidence of the autonomy\nof commumcators and the fundamental unity with the medium of\ncontrols ;\nbut the figures are not coercive, while the Irving experi-\nment is definitely anomalous. Pending confirmation, or an ex-\nplanation of the anomaly, the indication must not be taken too\nseriously.\n9\nWhen we turn to the relations between communicators and\nmediums from the more ordinary point of view, we find that,\nwhereas (on RT) J & E are sharply differentiated from L, J' & E'\nare quite indistinguishable from S. Mrs Sharplin\u2019s \u201c controlled\n\u201d\nstate (Silver) is particularly well defined, but it is clear that when,\nso to say, she abandons this for the \u201c communicator \u201d condition she\nreverts, at the RT level at any rate, to her normal condition, which\nis but little affected by J' and E'. The value of -4314 for S and E'\nis, indeed, the highest reaction time similarity ever recorded.\nLeonard shows the same tendency, though to a much less extent,\nfor we have, taking the means for this and the First Thomas experi-\nment together :\nSimilarity Difference\nLF - - - - -11795 -3150\nLJ & LE - - -0962 -1383\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 197\nAccording to the point of view we ultimately adopt, we may\nattribute the difference between Leonard and Sharplin here either\nto the lack of practice which the communicators have had with the\nlatter medium, or to the short time that has been available for\nbuilding up the \u201c histrionic poses \u201d of the alternative hypothesis.\nLeonard has shown an appreciable, though barely significant, im-\nprovement in this respect, since the first experiment ;\nfor we have,\nfor the LJ and LE means :\nSimilarity Difference\nFirst Experiment - -1937 -0297\nThis \u201e - --0013 -2469\nDifference - - -1950 -2172\nThe differences have standard errors -1086 and -0875 respectively ;\nso that, for their significances, we have :\nFor similarity : P = -07 3093-1\nFor difference P = -02 3093-2\nwhile if we take the two together, which is probably legitimate, we\nfind\nMean of differences = -2061. S.E. of mean = -0697. P<-01 ...3093-3\nPoints such as these are, however, of comparatively minor interest\nat the present stage of our investigation, though they may perhaps\nbe useful straws to indicate the direction of the wind.\nC. Inter-Group Comparisons\n10\nMuch more interesting and of potentially greater importance for\nour present investigation are the inter-group comparisons given in\nTable III. I have again confined myself to the more obviously\ninteresting comparisons, for I see httle to be gained at present by\ncomparing, say, J with S' or E' with F. I have, however, included\nthe \u201c cross-comparisons \u201d JE' and EJ', because of the known close\nsimilarity, from Q.S.T.P., II and Table II of this paper, between\nJ & E and J' & E'. If these are autonomous entities and very like\neach other, we might reasonably expect the cross-comparison as\nwell as the direct similarities to be high. As before, I give percen-\ntages for similarity and halve the probabilities, \u201c for sense \u201d, in the\ncase of this quantity.\n\f198 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nProbably tbe most striking feature of the Table is the extra-\nordinary resemblance between Feda and Silver in respect of RT.\nThis is repeated, though to a much less extent, by the reproductions\nalso, and is only rendered the more remarkable by the significant\ndifferences also found in each case. Leonard and Sharphn them-\nselves show no kind of resemblance to each other\u2014they are, indeed,\ninsignificantly countersimilar\u2014as regards RT, where their difference\nis highly significant ;\nwhile their similarity and difference are alike\nnegligible in the case of RPN.\nIt is tempting to rush to the conclusion that there is a specific\n\u201c control state \u201d common to all mediums ;\nbut this, I think, would\nbe a far too hasty generalisation. More probably it is only some\nmore or less coincidental likeness of character and experience that\nhas caused L and S to sj^lit off such highly similar secondaries. None\nthe less, so striking a resemblance between a yoimg Hindu girl and\nan erstwhile American brave (as they are alleged to be) is, to my\nmind, quite incredible ;\nthe similarity in question accordingly\ngreatly weakens, in my opinion, whatever claims either might have\nto be accepted at his or her face value.\nI may say here that among the data collected by Mr Drayton\nThomas from Mrs Sharplin were three sets of reactions from a\npersonality purporting to be Feda manifesting through her, as well\nas a number of observations on \u201c Jinnie \u201d who is a kind of secondary\ncontrol. I have not yet made any study of these data, thinking it\nbetter to concentrate on John and Etta for the time being ;\nbut I\nhope to examine them in due course, when I attempt a more thorough\nstudy of controls generally than I have yet been able to undertake.\n11\nIt will be noticed that, on RT, the communicators \u201c follow their\nmediums \u201d in the sense that both JJ' and EE' similarities are\nfeebly negative, like LS ;\nbut I doubt whether any weight should\nbe attached to this circumstance which is probably quite accidental.\nThe cross-similarities are about equally feeble in a positive sense.\nIt is evident that little support for the hypothesis that J and E are\nautonomous is to be expected from a study of RT ;\nthese data, at\nany rate, give none at all.\nOn RPN, on the other hand, the position is somewhat more pro-\nmising, for JJ' & EE' similarities are both appreciably higher than\nthat for LS. The Difference, however, is not significant, for taking\nmeans, we have\n\f149 ]\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 199\nMediums . .\nMean\n- -11.52\nCommunicators - - - - -2848\nDifference - - - - -1696\nS.E. - - - - -1231\nwhence Diff.\/S.E. is 1-378 and P\/2 is -085 3094-1\nEven if we count in the cross-comparisons, we have\nMean\nMediums ----- -1152\nCommunicators - - - - -26825\nDifference 15305\nS.E. ------ -1123\nwhence Diff.\/S.E. is 1-363 and P\/2 is -09 3094-2\nI give these values, which are of no intrinsic significance, mainly\nfor the sake of emphasising that, even if they were highly significant,\nwe should not be entitled to draw any positive conclusions from\nthem regarding the autonomy of John and Etta. We have just\nreceived an unmistakeable warning, in the shape of the remarkable\nresemblance between Feda and Silver, to the effect that, however\ndifferent two mediums may be in their normal state they are quite\ncapable of achieving a striking similarity when in trance. Thus,\nbroadly speaking, no\n\u201c\nstraight \u201d resemblance between J & J' or\nE & E', however strong and however much greater than that be-\ntween L & S would justify us in doing more than conclude that there\nis a stronger likeness between the \u201c communicator \u201d states of the\ntwo medimns than between those we know as normal.\nStill, we may reasonably conclude, despite the foregoing and the\nfeebleness of the indications, that if there is any good evidence for\nthe autonomy of John and Etta to be found anywhere we are more\nlikely to find it among reproductions than among reaction times.\nD. Inter-List Comparisons\n12\nIt wiU be remembered that in the course of Q.S.T.P, II {q.v. p. 350)\nI compared the reactions given by the same personalities (N, P, & F)\nin response to the two different fists of words used in the First\nThomas and Irving experiments. That is to say, I compared the\nreactions given by normal Leonard when tested with List A with\nthose given by her when tested with List B, and similarly for pre-\npared Leonard and Feda.\n\f200 WJiately Caringkm, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nAs already explained, the words of List B were derived from those\nof List A by substituting for each a word more or less obviously\nassociated with it, and I rather expected that there would be some\nreasonable degree of similarity shown when the reactions to the two\nlists by the same personality were compared. In this I was, in the\nfirst instance, disappointed ;\nbut I have since made a considerable\nnumber of comparisons of this kind, of which the more important\nare given in Table IV. I should perhaps explain that in recom-\nputing the results of the original comparisons I have incorporated\ncorrections for practice and fatigue, which I had previously ignored\nand, in the case of Feda, I have rejected the reproductions of the\nfirst sitting in which, evidently, she did not reahse what was reqmred\nof her, and gave only one correct reproduction in seventy-five ;\nthis\nlast accounts for the considerable difference between RN 3051\nand 2134.\n13\nAs was perhaps to be expected, most of the similarities found are\nsomewhat slight, particularly as regards RT. Here, indeed, the only\nreally striking result is RN 3058, which shows Feda as again signi-\nficantly similar to Silver, despite the change, so to say, of fist. It is\ndistinctly curious that she should be, as it were, more faithful to\nhim than to herself (3052) though this is reversed for RPN. Some-\nthing odd is evidently involved here, though frankly I do not under-\nstand just what it is.\nIt is perhaps just worth noticing in passing that the RT values\nfor JJ' and EE' (3055 & 6) are both positive and, as such, better than\nthe straight intra-list values (3039, 3040) of Table III ;\nbut the\nfigures are too small to be significant.\nOn RPN they are negligibly inferior to the straight comparisons\n(3045 & 6) ;\nEE' is significant as it stands and JJ' not far off it\nwhile if we take the mean, we have\nMean=-2389. S.E. = -0822. P\/2 = -0017 3095\nwhich is very definitely significant. It is tempting to find here a\nfurther and stronger indication of autonomy, for it is difficult at first\nsight to understand just how likeness between the two mediums can\nproduce the effect when two different fist of words are involved.\nBut the general considerations of section 11 above still hold and it\nmay well be that by forcing the comparison to a deeper level, as the\nuse of inter-fist data imdoubtedly does, we have merely shifted to\na region where the mediums are more alike than they are super-\nficially.\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 201\nThe fact remains, however, that comparison of J' & E' with their\nprototypes of the 1933 hst gives results just about as good, on the\nwhole, as comparison with the Leonard versions tested with the\n1935 hst. It was this discovery that led me to use the 1933 material\nin the analysis of Part II of this paper, with results, as will be seen,\nof considerable interest.\n14\nThe whole question of interpreting these intricate and somewhat\nvarying results is, I find, extremely difficult ;\nyet I am confident\nthat they contain important clues to the proper understanding of\nthe psychology of trance mediumship, particularly as regards the\nstatus and nature of controls.\nI have said above that the use of inter-hst data \u201c forces the com-\nparison to a deeper level \u201d and it is possible that some amplification\nof this remark may help us to envisage more clearly the kind of\nproblem with which we are concerned.\nI am speaking, of course, of what I may call \u201c associated \u201d hsts,\nsuch as these, in which each word of the one is hnked with the corre-\nsponding word of the other by some not too remote association.\nThus the first word \u201c Head \u201d of the 1933 hst is evidently connected\nwith the first word \u201c Hair \u201d of the 1935 hst ;\nthe second words\n\u201c Green \u201d and \u201c Grey \u201d respectively are both colours (colloquially\nspeaking at any rate), and have the additional hnk of both beginning\nwith Gr . . . . The last mentioned element might tend to produce\nsome hkeness of response on the most superficial level without the\nmeanings of the words being at all apprehended by the subject ;\nbut\nin general this is not the case, so that likeness of reaction will only\nbe brought about the evocation of associated memories, concepts or\nwhat-not common to the two words. It is in this sense that I use\nthe term \u201c deeper level \u201d in this context ;\nbut there seems no a\n'priori reason for supposing that it is \u201c deeper \u201d in the same kind of\nway as the level at which RPN operates is \u201c deeper \u201d than that\nreached by RT. In fact, it fairly evidently is not ;\notherwise, I\nthink, we should find Feda inter-list RT similarities (3051 & 2) of\nthe same high order as those for RPN (3061 & 2) ;\nand, again, if the\ntwo \u201c deepnesses \u201d were of the same kind, we should expect F to\nbe significantly similar to S' on inter-fist RPN (3068) if she is so on\nRT (3058). And why in the name of all that\u2019s perplexing should\nshe be significantly similar to S' on inter-fist RT, but not to herself ?\nI can only propound the conundrum and hope that some more\npenetrating psychologist than myself will produce the answer.\n\f202 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nPart II\nElimination of Effects due to Mediums\nfrom J, J' and E, E' Data\nA. Explanation of Method\n16\nI have already pointed out that no \u201c straight \u201d comparison of the\ndata obtained from the communicators purporting to manifest\nthrough two different mediums can possibly lead to valid conclusions\nregarding their autonomy, because any likeness found can always be\nattributed to likeness of the relevant trance states as such. I must\nnow add that it is equally hopeless to attempt to overcome this\ndifficulty (as I did in Part VI of Q.S.T.P., II) by introducing data\nobtained from the normal mediums into the calculations, for the\n\u201c communicator \u201d state of trance may be very different from the\nnormal, just as the \u201c control \u201d state has been shown to be above.\nWe must accordingly work only with the data obtained from the\nostensible communicators and devise means for eliminating any\neffects of likeness, howsoever arising, due to the trance states in or\nthrough which they are functioning.\nThe right way of doing this (for which, as aheady stated, I am\ndeeply indebted to Mr W. L. Stevens of the Galton Laboratory) is\nnot particularly easy to understand, but I will do my best to make\nit clear with the aid of simple illustrations, and I think the best plan\nwill be to build up a set of imaginary readings for, say, a group of\nfive words and then analyse these. The process, if not completely\nilluminating, should serve to show the kind of way in which the\nmethod operates.\n16\nBy way of preliminary, we must note the following points. If we\nare presented with a set of, say, reaction times from the Leonard-\nSharphn experiment of 1935, we find that it consists of 400 entries,\nnamely 100 from the Leonard version of John (J), 100 from the\nLeonard version of Etta (E), 100 from the Sharphn version of John\n(J') and 100 from the Sharplin version of Etta (E'). To each of\nthese entries three factors (apart from fortuitous error) have contri-\nbuted and to the operation of these three factors, plus error, all\ndifferences between them are due.\nThe first factor is the Medium, hereinafter denoted by M. By\nthis is meant, of course, the medium in the relevant trance state\n\f203\n149]\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nnot the medium in the \u201c normal \u201d state or in that produced by\nhashish or a new hat. Thus the commimicator state as such, and\nregardless of which communicator is functioning, might be respon-\nsible for a generally longer reaction time on the part of Leonard than\non the part of Sharphn, or vice versa, and this fact would contribute\nto the variabihty of the data taken as a whole.\nThe second factor is the Communicator, hereinafter denoted by\nC. This may refer either (on the spiritistic hypothesis) to an actual\nextraneous entity with attributes of its own exerting an influence\non the average length of reaction time, just as M does, or (on the\npurely psychological) to the \u201c rendering \u201d by the medium of the\ncharacter of John or Etta as the case may be. It makes no difference\nto the analysis ;\non either hypothesis, C may make just the same\nkind of contribution to the total variabihty of the data as M.\nThe third factor, of course, is the Word, hereinafter denoted by W.\nThe different words of the hst will, in general, produce differing\neffects which may be common to the two mediums as such, to the\ntwo communicators as such, or to all four personahties.\nThe last remark, which may perhaps sound a trifle obscure, leads\nto the consideration that we must not in our analysis deal with these\nthree main factors alone, but also with what is usually termed their\n\u201c interaction \u201d with each other. Thus the contribution of C to the\ntotal variability of the data may differ as between the two mediums\n\u2014or, if you prefer it (since there is nothing mathematically speaking\nto distinguish between the data from mediums and communicators)\nthe contribution of M may vary as between the two communicators.\nWe will denote this interaction by MC, and will similarly use the\nletters MW and CW to refer respectively to the contributions made\nto the total variability of the data by the variation of the mediums\nas such, taken together, with respect to the words, and to the corre-\nsponding variation of the communicators as such, taken together.\nThus the total variability of the data is made up six definite (and\ncalculable) contributions, viz. M, C, W, MC, MW, CW, together with\nan indefinite amount of error. Our business is to And how much of\nthe total observed variabihty can be ascribed to each of these six\ncomponents and to see whether those that interest us (in this case\nonly CW) are significantly greater than the residuum (error). This\nwill, I hope, become clearer when we have constructed a set of\nimaginary data ab initio.\n17\nWe will try the effect of building up a set of imaginary reaction\ntimes for the four personahties J, E, J' and E' for five words, a, b, c,\nd and e, using arbitrary units.\n\f204 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nWe will start by supposing that one of the mediums (L, say) has a\n\u201c basic rate \u201d of reaction time of, say, one unit, while the other\nhas a basic rate of 2. Then our first schedule of contributions to the\nfinal times will be :\nWOBD J E\no 1 1\nh 1 1\nc 1 1\nd 1 1\ne 1 1\nJ' E' Total\n2 2 6\n2 2 6\n2 2 6\n2 2 6\n2 2 6\nTotal 5 5 10 10 30\nNow the \u201c total variability \u201d, otherwise known as the Variance,\nis simply the sum of the squares of the differences of the quantities\nconcerned from their mean. Here we have 20 entries with sum 30 and\nmean T5 ;\nsince 10 of them are 1 and the other 10 are 2, it is easy\nto see that the total variabihty, or variance, will be 20 x -5^, or 5-0.\nThe rule for finding the contribution made to the total variance\nfrom any source may be stated as follows : Take the sum of the\nsquares of the totals of the entries contributed by the two or more\nfactors concerned ;\ndivide this sum of squares by the number of\nentries which go to make up each total thus squared ;\nsubtract the\nproduct of the Grand Total and the General Mean ;\nthe remainder\nis the contribution required. I cannot give here the theoretical proof\nof this rule ;\nbut those who are acquainted with statistical methods\nwill probably recognise an old friend, even if somewhat disguised.\nNow at this stage we have only one source of variation involved,\nnamely M alias the differing \u201c basic rate \u201d, as we have called it,\nof the two mediums. Leonard, we have supposed, has contributed\nthe 10 entries under J & E, which have a total of 10 ;\nSharphn the\n10 entries under J' and E' with a total of 20. The sum of the squares\nof these totals is 100 + 400 = 500 ;\neach of the totals which has been\nsquared is made up of 10 entries, and dividing by this number gives\n50 ;\nthe grand total is 30 and the general mean is 1-5 with a product\nof 45 ;\nsubtracting this from 50, leaves 5-0. This, as we have just\nseen, is the total variance ;\nso that at this stage the total variabihty\nis found to be composed exclusively\u2014as it should be, because we\nhave arranged it so\u2014of the variations due to the difference in the\n\u201c basic rates \u201d of the mediums\u2014that is to say, to M.\n18\nNow let us suppose that \u201c John \u201d\u2014whether because he is an\nautonomous extraneous entity so constituted, or because the\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 205\n\u201c renderings \u201d of his character given by the two mediums agree in\nthis respect\u2014has similarly a \u201c basic rate \u201d of 2 and \u201c Etta \u201d, subject\nto the same remarks, of 3. Adding these to what we have for the\nmedimns, our schedule becomes :\nWord J E J' E' Total\na 3 4 4 5 16\nb 3 4 4 5 16\nc 3 4 4 5 16\nd 3 4 4 5 16\ne 3 4 4 5 16\nTotal 15 20 20 25 80\nWe may as well find the variance now by the regular method\ninstead of by inspection ;\nwe have, where x refers to any entry,\nS(a:)-80; S(a;2) = 330; x = 4-0; *S(ic)=:320; S(a:-f)2= 10-0\nthe last-named quantity (10-0) being the variance, obtained by\nsubtracting x S(a:) from S(a;2).\n[N.B.

As\n\f206 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nit happens, the simple figures chosen make the two contributions\nequal ;\nbut there is no reason, in general, why they should be so,\nand they are equally well dealt with by the same process whether\nthey are or not.\n19\nWe will not trouble to introduce an element of \u201c interaction\n\u201d\nbetween mediums and coimnunicators, and I fear I am not clever\nenough to build up a complete set of life-like data without at\none stage or another upsetting the arrangements I have, so to\nspeak, already made. It will be sufficient, I hope, to construct a\nreasonably plausible set and then to show how it is in practice\nanalysed.\nLet us suppose that the words a, b, c, d, e are such that they re-\nspectively produce increments of time 7, 3, 1, 5 and 4 units, \/or all\npersonalities ;\nthen to the existing figures in each colunm of our\nschedule we shall add 7, 3, 5, 1, 4 in that order from top to bottom.\nOn the assumption that John and Etta really are extraneous entities\nof some kind, let the words further be such that they produce\nrespectively increments of 3, 1, 0, 2, 1 in the case of both versions\nof John, and of 1, 4, 1, 5, 2 in the case of both versions of Etta.\nFinally let the mediums have their own idiosyncrasies such that the\nwords give, similarly, increments of 6, 1, 3, 1, 1 in both tests of\nLeonard, and of 1, 4, 4, 2, 6 in both tests of Sharplin.\nWe have now catered for all possibilities\u2014namely, for variations\nin the average times of mediums and communicators over all words\n(by the \u201c basic rates \u201d dealt with in the previous sections) ;\nfor\ndifferences between the words common to all personahties i.e.,\neffects common to both mediums\u2014for those affecting each com-\nmunicator individually ;\nand for those affecting each medium indi-\nvidually. We will refer to these last three quantities involving the\nwords as W, CW, and MW respectively ;\nbut it is only CW that\nreally interests us. If there is \u201c nothing there \u201d the two versions of\neach communicator can have nothing in common except what\nchance will give, and the value of CW will not significantly exceed\nerror ;\nbut if there really are communicators behind the scenes, then\ntheir personal variation with respect to words will tend to leave a\nsignificant value for CW, after we have allowed for any seeming\nsimilarity due to variations of the mediums individually or varia-\ntions common to all personalities.\nReverting, we need not trouble to put down in detail just how the\ndata for each personality are built up, but will content ourselves\nwith the single example of J (the Leonard version of John).\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 207\nThese data will now be made up as follows :\nWord B W J\na 3 7 3\n& 3 3 1\nc 3 1 0\nd 3 5 2\ne 3 4 1\nL\n6\n1\n3\n1\n1\nTotal\n19\n8\n7\n11\n9\nThe attentive reader will doubtless recognise the figures under B\nas the \u201c basic rates \u201d already discussed ;\nthose under W as the con-\ntributions from the words common to all personalities ;\nand those\nunder J and L as the increments postulated as characteristic of John\nand Leonard respectively.\nRepeating this process with the other three personahties, we\nobtain as our final set of data for analysis :\nWord J E J' E' Total\nCT 19 18 15 14 66\nh 8 12 12 16 48\nc 7 9 9 11 36\nd 11 15 13 17 56\ne 9 11 15 17 52\nTotal 54 65 64 75 258\nIt should be borne in mind that, in composing this set of data,\nwe have assumed that there is no error {i.e., we have not introduced\nany casual irregularities but only quantities having a definite raison\nd\u2019etre. Thus, when we have removed all the variability (variance)\ndue to M, C, W, MC, MW and CW, we ought to find nothing left.\n20\nWe start by determining the total variance to be analysed. The\nGrand Total is 258, the General Mean 258\/20=12-9, and their\nproduct 3328-2.\nThe sum of squares of all 20 entries is 3566 ;\nsubtracting the\nabove product leaves 237-8 ;\nthis is the variance.\nThe contribution made by the mediums, conmiunicators and\ntheir interaction (M, C and MC) is deterimned as follows. First we\nsquare and sum the four personality (column) totals, obtaining the\nfigure 16,862 ;\nbut since each item squared contains five entries, we\nmust divide by five (obtaining 3,372-4) before subtracting the\nproduct (3,328-2) which leaves 44-2. This quantity, however, con-\ntains aU the variance that can be due to mediums, communicators\nand their interaction ;\nso that to obtain MC we must calculate M\nand C separately and subtract from 44-2. Repeating the ritual\n\f208 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nalready exemplified in previous sections we obtain the values of\n24-2 for M amd 20-0 for C. We then have :\nM 24-2\nC 20-0\nMC 0\nTotal - - - 44-2\nWe find to our surprise that there is no interaction between M and C,\nbut soon reahse that this is because we omitted to introduce any.\nTo find the contribution made by the differences between Words\nas such, i.e., the differences common to all personalities, we square\nand sum the Word (row) totals, obtaining 13,796. We divide this\nby four, because each total squared contains four items before sub-\ntracting the product from the quotient (3,449). The remainder\namounts to 120-8 and is W.\nFor the contribution made by the differences between the words as\nshown by the mediums we take, say, Leonard first, add the two\nentries for J and E in the case of each word (obtaining 37, 20, 16,\netc.), square and sum these totals, obtaining 3,101, and repeat the\nprocess for Sharplin, which yields 3,949. We add these to get the\ntotal effect, divide by two, because each item squared was made up\nof two entries, and subtract the product. This leaves 196-8, which is\nthe total contribution to the variance made by the mediums, the\nwords and their interaction. To obtain MW we must subtract M\nand W from this and we accordingly have :\nM - 24-2\nW 120-8\nMW 51-8\nTotal - - - 196-8\nIn the case of CW, we proceed precisely similarly, except that\ninstead of adding and squaring the pairs of entries belonging to the\nsame medium, we add and square the pairs belonging to the same\ncommunicator. The sums are 2,964 and 4,016 for John and Etta\nrespectively ;\nadding these, dividing by two and subtracting the\nproduct, we have the figure 161 -8 which, analogously to the case of\nthe mediums and words, contains the contributions made by C and\nW as well as CW. So in this case we have :\nC 20-0\nW 120-8\nCW 21-0\nTotal - - - 161-8\n\f209\n149 ]\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nWe may now tabulate the contributions as follows :\nM - - - - 24-2\nC - - - - 20-0\nW - - - - 120-8\nMC - _ _ _ _ 0-0\nMW- - - - 51-8\nCW - - - - 21-0\nMCW - - 0-0\nTotal - _ - 237 8\nIt will be seen that the total variance is precisely made up, as it\nshould be, by the contributions thus determined, so that nothing is\nleft for MOW, which would be error for our purpose.\nIn practice, of course, this is far from being the case, and the\nquestion arises as to whether the quantity CW is significantly\ngreater than the residual MOW. If it is not, then the effect is attri-\nbutable to chance ;\nif it is, then the operation of some extraneous\nfactor not ascribable to the likeness between the relevant trance states of\nthe mediums, or to chance, may be regarded as estabhshed. We have\nextracted and set in its proper place, as W, the effect due to whatever\nthe words have in common for all personahties ;\nand we have done\nthe same (MW) for whatever is common to the two (presumably\nclosely similar but not necessarily identical) states of each of the\ntwo mediums ;\nif there are no communicators, then chance alone\ncan give us whatever we find for CW, and it is only a matter of\nroutine statistical technique to ascertain the probability of this\nhaving occurred.\n21\nThe way this is done is by means of the ordinary \u201c z test \u201d, which\nI have already explained to some extent in Q.S.T.P., I, Appendix II,\np. 214. We obtain the mean squares of CW and MCW by dividing\neach by the appropriate number of degrees of freedom and take z\nas half the difference of the natural logarithms of these quotients.\nDividing this 2 by its standard error and consulting a table of normal\ndeviates gives us the probability required.\nThis needs a good deal more amplification than I can give here.\nIt must be sufficient to say that the number of degrees of freedom\nassociated with any of the elementary factors M, C and W is one less\nthan the number of entities, so to speak, classified under the heading\nin question. Thus, in the example just worked, we have two\nmediums and two communicators, so that M and C have only one\n\f210 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\ndegree of freedom eacli ;\nbut we have five words, so tliat W has four\ndegrees. For \u201c compounds \u201d such as MW and CW the number of\ndegrees is the continued product of the numbers for the constituents ;\nthus MC would have 1x1 = 1 degree, CW has 1x4=4, and MOW\nhas 1 X 1 X 4 = 4 degrees. So long, in fact, as we are deahng only\nwith two mediums and two communicators the number of degrees\nfor CW and for MCW will always be equal. This saves a certain\namount of trouble in practice, for we do not need to work out mean\nsquares but merely divide CW by MCW (or vice versa, if MCW\nhappens to be the greater) and find the logarithm of this quotient.\nIn practice also it reduces the likelihood of error not to halve the\nlogarithm but to use double the standard error instead when deter-\nmining the probability. When the degrees of freedom are equal, as\nin these cases, the standard error is the square root of the reciprocal\nof the number of degrees.\n22\nI greatly regret that I have not been able to produce a more\nelegant example than that given above. I should have liked to have\nbeen able to compose a set of data such that the analysis would show\nus taking out (as in practice it does enable us to do) precisely the\nsame amounts of variance, under the different headings, as we had\npreviously put in. But it is one thing to understand a method well\nenough to use it, and to follow fairly clearly the manner of its\noperation ;\nbut quite another, as I have found to my cost, to be able\nto work it backwards well enough to construct an example of such a\nkind. As it is, I can only hope that the example I have given,\nimperfect as it is, may enable the reader to form some appreciation\nof the way in which the method breaks up the total variabihty of\nthe data into all possible constituent parts and assesses each with\nprecision, leaving nothing to chance except that which chance has\nintroduced.\nIt is interesting to note that, if we had only a single communi-\ncator, even though manifesting through two mediums, we could\nnever get to grips, on these lines, with the question of autonomy at\nall, because any sunilarity at all between the (now only two) sets of\ndata would be taken out under W. It is only the possibility of\napplying a kind of differential method as between John and Etta on\nthe one hand and Leonard and Sharphn on the other that gives us\nthe possibility of disentanghng whatever effects may really be due\nto outside influence from those due to the mediums and their trance\nconditions.\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 211\nB. Application of the Method\n23\nSo soon as the method just discussed was brought to my notice\nI hastened to apply it to the observations of the Leonard-Sharphn\nexperiment. In the first instance I used the \u201c bulked \u201d data,\nthat is to say, the sums of the (scaled) reaction times, or failures\nin reproduction, for all five occasions on which the personalities\nwere tested, and I analysed the whole fist of 100 items in a single\ncalculation.\nThe results, which need not be discussed in detail here, were\nsingularly unpromising. Much the same applied when I broke the\ndata up into the \u201c blocks \u201d of 25 words^ in which they are actually\ndivided, for convenience of recording, during the tests. I also\nwasted a great deal of time trying all manner of combinations and\npermutations of analysis, such as testing the reactions times obtained\nfrom one medium against the reproductions obtained from the other ;\nor either or both against a third quantity\u2014-Variety of Response (V)\n\u2014which I have lately been studying in a prehminary sort of way.\n(In passing, it looks as if this is going to be a valuable indicator,\nbut a great deal of work will have to be done on it before it is ready\nto make its debut.) I even embarked, with more heroism than\nprudence, on the full analysis of the five-dimensional manifold\nMCWOT (where 0 stands for Occasion and T for Test i.e., RT,\nRPN and V) having 5,999 degrees of freedom.\nBut it was only when, abandoning these rash projects, I labori-\nously took the whole outfit to little bits, so to speak, and apphed the\nMOW analysis to each group of 4 x 25 data, block by block and\noccasion by occasion, that light began to dawn.\n24\nThe results obtained by this procedure were very much more\npromising, at least as regards RPN ;\nthe RT results were unin-\nspiring, as was to be expected from the preliminary survey.\nEncouraged by this and by the rather surprisingly high simi-\nlarities of the inter-list comparisons, I decided to add to my stock\nof results by comparing the Leonard data of 1933 with the Sharp] in\ndata of 1935. For reasons given in Q.S.T.P., 1, p. 191, the material\n^ In what follows, Block A refers to words 1-25, Block B to words 26-60,\nand so on. The contents of the blocks are always the same, but the order of\nthe words is varied within the block from occasion to occasion. The occasions\n(sittings) are numbered from I to V.\n\fWhately Carington, M.A., M.Sc.\n212 [part\nof 1933 is limited to 75 words instead of 100, so that only blocks A,\nB and C could be analysed here.\nIt further occurred to me that the method described knows noth-\ning and cares less, so to speak, of the label attached to the data, so\nthat the observations obtained from Sharplin might just as well be\nobtained from Leonard so far as the mathematics is concerned. If\nthe method can ehminate effects due to similarities between Leonard\nand Sharphn, it can equally well eliminate effects due to the simi-\nlarity between Leonard on one set of occasions (1933) and Leonard\non another set of occasions (1935). I accordingly have analysed\nthese data also for both RT and RPN.\nEach such analysis follows precisely the ritual given in the\nexample of sections 16 to 21 above, except that there are 25 words\ninstead of only five.\nUsing a convenient notation in which the figures stand for the\nyears and a dash (') indicates Sharphn, I thus obtained 20 RT and\n20 RPN values of z from the 35-35' material, 15 of each from the\n33-35' and 15 of each again from the 33-35, making a total of 100\nin all.\n25\nThese 100 values of z (actually of 2z, vide supra) are displayed in\nTable V, and the all-important point to remember is that, if there\nwere no extraneous influence at work, so that the values of CW from\nwhich they are derived were wholly chance determined, these 100\nvalues would be randomly distributed about zero with variance 4\/24\nor -16667.^\nLittle more than a glance at the Table is necessary to make us\nsuspect that this condition is far from being fulfilled. It is true that,\nif we pool all the results, the general mean is not far from zero nor\nthe variance from what it should be, but if we look at the arrange-\nment of the quantities and the signs of structure, so to speak, which\nthey display, we are tempted to declare roundly that the random\ndistribution is definitely not realised. We must, however, be\nextremely cautious here, for it is remarkable how, in a mass of\ndata of this kind, chance alone will throw up effects which look\nvery striking but can be shown by exact tests to be not at all\nunlikely to occur.\n* The original true z\u2019s have variance 1\/24 and S.E. equal the square root of\nthis ;\nthe fact that we simply do not halve these quantities cannot alter their\nsignificance ;\ntherefore the S.E. of the double z\u2019s must be double that of the\nsingle z\u2019s, and their variance four times as great, since the variance is the\nsquare of the S.E.\n\f213\n149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nActually we have\nGeneral mean = \u202203451. S.E. = -040825. P = -40 3096'1\nwhich is neghgible, and for the variance (using the \u201c 2-test \u201d)\nSum of squares of all entries\n_ 16-33202\nExpected value 16-66667\n\u2019\nwhence 2 is - -0203. S.E. = -1000. P = -84 3096-2\nwhich is even worse.\nIt should be noted here that, although the variance taken over\nthe whole 100 entries differs neghgibly from its expected value, it\nvaries considerably from one group of data to another, though never\nto a significant extent. This also is to be expected. In what\nfollows, I use the theoretical variance throughout ;\nthis is techni-\ncally correct, because we know the variance of the \u201c population \u201d to\nwhich the data belong, whereas to use the observed variance\nwhich might appear to be keeping closer to the facts\u2014would\nbe merely to estimate what we want from data themselves under\ntest.\nReverting : On the other hand, at least one of the groups (35-35'\nRPN) has a mean which differs significantly from zero, while some\nof the others are not altogether neghgible and we have to consider\nthe hkelihood of these arising by chance in a random sample of six\nsuch groups. We shall return to this in a moment.\n26\nBut the two most striking features by far are, first, the preponder-\nance of negative results in the 33-35 (Leonard-Leonard) material,\nand, second, the tendency for whatever is going on to become\nstronger in the course of the sitting. That is to say, if the group as\na whole shows a positive result, then there is a tendency for the\npositivity to increase from block A to block C or D. Compare for\nexample RPN 35-35' ;\nthe Total for block A is only -0749, but\nthere is a fairly steady increase through B and C till for D it reaches\nthe high value of 2-5901.\nThis \u201c practice \u201d effect is very striking and extremely difficult to\nreconcile with the idea of random distribution ;\nit must, however,\nbe tested for significance before being accepted as authentic.\n\f214 Whately Caringto?i, M.A., M.Sc. [part\n27\nWe will first consider the tendency on the part of the Leonard-\nLeonard analyses to give negative results.\nTaking RT and RPN together we find that she gives 20 negative\nitems out of 30. If chance alone were at work, we should expect\n15 ;\nthe difference is 5, whence\n3.333. p = .065 3097-1\nAlternatively, and preferably, we have\nPositive Negative Total\nLeonard-Sharplin Comparisons - 40 .30 70\nLeonard-Leonard ,,\n- 10 20 30\nTotal - - - 50 50 100\nwhence 4-762. P = -03 3097-2\nwhich leaves little or no doubt that something non-chance is going\non, which is all that we are interested in at the moment.\nAgain, the mean of all Leonard-Leonard data differs significantly\nfrom the mean of all Leonard-Sharplin data, for we have\nMean of all Leonard-Sharplin data -09729 with variance -00238\n,, ,, Leonard-Leonard ,,\n- -11196 ,, ,,\n-00556\nDifference of means -20925 ,, ,,\n-00794\nand S.E. -08911,\nwhence P<-02 3098\nStrictly speaking, I think that these two results (3097 & 3098) are\nindependent and thus in some sense cumulative, for there seems no\nreason why the mean should not differ to the extent they do and\nyet the L-L material be of the same predominant sign as the L-S ;\nbut I am not quite sure of this point, so will not claim it in the final\nassessment.\n28\nTo ascertain whether the six means themselves are likely to have\nbeen produced by chance in a random sample of six groups we must\nfirst calculate the probabihty of each individually being a chance\neffect, and then combine the probabilities by the \u201c negative log-\narithm \u201d method of Fisher {Statistical Methodsfor Research Workers,\n21-1, pp. 97-8, IVth Edn.).\n\f215\n149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nWe then have\nGroup Mean S.E.

P = -065 3104\nI must leave the question of how best to combine these various\nprobabilities to a later section, and must make a short digression\nto enquire into the possibihty of the effects observed being arti-\nfactual ;\nthat is to say, due to causes not eliminated by the methods\nemployed.\n31\nThe only possibility seems to be this : that for reasons too intri-\ncate to discuss here it is impracticable to apply corrections for\npractice and fatigue in the same way as is done when we are esti-\nmating the ordinary similarities and differences between person-\nalities. It might, accordingly, be suggested that similar rates of\nslowing of reaction time, for example, might produce illusory like-\nnesses between the L and S versions of J and E and thus raise the\nvalue of CW relative to MOW in the analyses (or reduce it if the\nrates of change were dissimilar). It is a little difficult to see just\nhow this would work out, for (unless I am mistaken) the first order\neffects common to the two mediums will be ehminated by the\nmethod, leaving only second order effects to operate ;\nbut it is\ncertainly not mathematically excluded from possibility. The only\nway to make perfectly sure of this point is to correct every individual\nreading to the value it would have if no practice or fatigue were\noperative, and then recalculate the whole outfit. There are 5,500\nrelevant observations at present and fife has hitherto proved too\nshort for so formidable an enterprise ;\nbut I propose to undertake\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Perso7ialities 217\nit almost immediately, wlien I receive the additional 2,000 observa-\ntions which Mr Drayton Thomas is collecting from Mrs Garrett at\nthe time of writing.\nMeanwhile, there are a number of considerations which com-\npletely assure me, humanly speaking, that the results are not due\nto anything of the kind ;\non the contrary, the random incidence of\npractice and fatigue effects is more hkely to have obscured than to\nhave generated the sort of thing we have been looking for.\n1. The relevant corrections are always negligible in the case of\nKPN ;\nbut the KPN results obtained above are more, rather than\nless, impressive than those for RT.\n2. In comparing the 1933 material with the 1935 I have used the\nsame five 1933 sittings (namely I & III to VI) as for the comparisons\nof Q.S.T.P., II iq.v.)- This means that the orders in which the\ncorresponding words were given were different (except in the case\nof the first sitting) in the two years ;\nso that the effects in question\nare practically eliminated here ;\nyet the 33-35' and 33-35 results are\nnot less impressive, on the whole, than the 35-35'.\n3. Although it is not practicable to apply corrections, it is not\ndifficult to find the amount of \u201c inflation \u201d to which CW would be\nsubjected as a result of the unremoved practice or fatigue effects.\nIf these effects are responsible for the results obtained, there should\nbe a significant correlation between the amount of the inflation and\nthe value of the corresponding z. I have tested this on RT 35-35',\nwhich, as unaffected by the considerations of 1, and 2, above, is the\nmost suspect group. The result is altogether neghgible, for the\ncoefficient of correlation is only \u2019126.\nI have also performed analogous calculations to see whether there\nis any tendency for the \u201c inflation \u201d to increase (or diminish) as\nbetween blocks A and D of RPN 35-35', and a number of other tests\nin addition. The results are quite neghgible in all cases.\nWe may accordingly conclude with assurance that the results\nobserved are not due to unehminated practice or fatigue effects.\n32\nThe problem of how probabilities obtained from different tests\nor experiments should be combined so as to give an over-all result\nis distinctly tricky, and I have yet to see any satisfactory account\nof it.\nOf course, if we are given two samples of qualitatively similar raw\nmaterial {e.g. measurements of the heights of Scots and Dutchmen),\nwe should simply pool the data and treat them statistically as a\nsingle sample. Or if we know the \u201c end-product probabilities \u201d, so\n\f218 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nto say, of a number of such (qualitatively similar) investigations,\nwe use the method employed in 28 and 29 above to determine the\nchance of such a batch of probabilities arising as a result of random\nsampling.\nBut it is not of such cases of these that I am thinhing ;\nthe\nquestion is rather one of combining the outcomes of tests or experi-\nments which are qualitatively dijferent, or independent. And by\n\u201c independent \u201d I mean such that it is impossible to infer the out-\ncome of the one from a knowledge of the outcome of the others with-\nout invoking the truth [or falsity) of the hypothesis under test.\nThus, if we wished to test the hypothesis that inter-planetary\nspace is filled with granulated cheese, we might approach the\nproblem either by a spectroscopic method or by analysing the\naccretions of meteorites ;\nand these two methods would be inde-\npendent in the above sense. If our technique was so imperfect that\nstatistical methods had to be employed to assess the results, we\nshould obtain (perhaps) two probabilities of -05 each in favour of\nthis intriguing hypothesis. It would not be correct, I think, to\ncombine these by the negative logarithm method and arrive at the\nover-all result of -2 as the final probability ;\nin fact, such a con-\nclusion would be absurd on the face of it.\nI submit that in the case of independent experiments, or their\nequivalent, provided we are sure of the independence, the proper pro-\ncedure is that of the \u201c witnesses \u201d formula for concurrent testimony\nas given in the text-books {e.g. Hall & Knight, Higher Algebra,\np. 396 IVth Edn.). The argument may be presented as follows :\nIn all cases of the kind we are considering, we are enquiring\nwhether there is a \u201c real \u201d non-chance cause or influence at work,\nor whether the effects observed can be ascribed to chance alone,\nand the probablility of the latter supposition being true is the value\nof P, which we obtain at the conclusion of any test on the subject.\nThen, since there is certainly either a non-chance cause or not,\nthe probability of there being one, plus the probability of there\nbeing none, must together equal unity ;\nbut the value of the second\nprobability is P, so that the value of the probabihty of there actually\nbeing a \u201c real \u201d cause is 1 - P.\nNow suppose that we perform two independent experiments and\nobtain two values and p.^ as the probabilities that their results are\ndue to chance alone. Then (l-^^) and {l-p.^ are the respective\nprobabilities of the results being due to something other than chance.\nEquivalently, and more conveniently, we may regard the out-\ncomes of the two experiments as two statements to the effect that\nchance alone is operative, with probabilities respectively of p^ and p^\nof being true and of (1 ~Pi) and (1 -^2)\nof being false.\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 219\nThen, if chance alone is operative, both statements are true, and\nthe chance of this occurring fortuitously is the product p^p 2 ;\nbut\nif a \u201c real \u201d influence is at work then both are false, and the chance\nof this occurring by accident is the product {l-pf){l-p 2 ). Thus,\nthe probabihty (so far as the evidence of these experiments goes) of\nthe results observed being due to chance alone is to the probability\nof their being due to a real influence as PiP2 is to (1 ~P2 )-\nWhence the over-all probabihty that chance alone is responsible is\nP1P2\nP1P2+ i^-Pi){^-P2)\nThe same reasoning shows that if we have a number of proba-\nbflities pi, P2 , Ps, \u2022\u2022Pn^ then the combined chance will be\nPlP2Pz---Pn\nP1P2P3 \u2014 (1 - -^>2 ) (1 -Pn)\nThe above argument appears sound, and it is easy to assure our-\nselves that what I may, by analogy, term the \u201c boundary con-\nditions \u201d of the problem are satisfled. For example, if every value\nof p were -5, the resultant P would also be -5, no matter how many\np\u2019s were involved ;\nand this is as it should be, for a value of -5 means\nthat chance is exactly as likely to be responsible as not, so that the\nexperiment throws no hght on the subject. Similarly, the value of\nany probability will be left unaltered by combining with it another\nof value -5, which is also as it should be. Again, if two experiments\nwere to yield probabilities of, say, -1 and -9, the combined proba-\nbihty would be -5 ;\nwhich is right, for each experiment precisely\ncontradicts the other, thus leaving us in our original state of a priori\nnescience.\nFinally, just as a succession of constituent p\u2019s less than -5 will\nprogressively diminish the combination P, so a succession of con-\nstituent p\u2019s greater than -5 will progressively increase it till in the\nhmit it becomes unity (which is precisely equivalent to the chance\nof the alternative hypothesis becoming zero) ;\nbut a succession of\nthe latter kind is just as unhkely to occur by chance as one of the\nformer, and a succession of random values of the constituent p\u2019s,\nsuch as the operation of chance would in fact give, would cause P to\napproximate increasingly closely to -5.\n33\nIn the present context we are concerned solely with the question\nof whether the values of 2z given irr Table V are or are not randomly\ndistributed around a mean of zero with variance 16667.\n\f220 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nFrom the point of view of the last section it would appear that\nthe RT and RPN results are \u201c independent \u201d in the relevant sense ;\nfor to use our previous knowledge that a failure in reproduction is\nusually associated with a prolongation of reaction time, or other like\ninformation, would be tantamount to invoking the (falsity of the)\nhypothesis we are testing, namely that there is no cause, other than\nchance, at work behind the scenes, i.e. no extraneous personality\npossessed of the characteristics concerned. But I shall not trouble\nto separate the two tests here, for the results are sufficiently coercive\nwithout doing so.\nTaking the two tests together we have the following items of\nevidence, P being the probability in each case that the effects are\ndue to chance alone on the hypothesis under test.\nProbability of the six means being due to\nrandom sampling - - . . -\nRN\n3100\nP\n\u202215\nProbability of the six \u201c slopes \u201d being due to\nrandom sampling . . . - . 3102 \u202205\nProbability of the observed association be-\ntween means and slopes being due to chance 3101 \u2022065\nProbability of the difference between the\nmeans of L - S and L - L results being due\nto chance - - 3098 \u202202\nApplying the formula of the preceding section, we have\n\u202215 X -05 X -065 X -02\n\u201c -15 X -05 X -065 X -02 + -85 x -95 x -935 x -98\n\u2022000009750\n\u201c\u2022739922500\n= 1-3x10-5 3105\nwhich is sufficiently significant to meet all requirements.\nEven if we were to adopt the ultra-conservative (and, as I hold,\nerroneous) course of treating these four items as if they were inde-\npendent \u201ctests of significance\u201d, instead of independent pieces of\nevidence bearing on the point at issue, we should still have\nNo. RN 2 Loogl\/P\n1 3100 3-7944\n2 3102 5-9914\n3 3104 5-4662\n4 3098 7-8240\nTotal - - - 23-0760 a with 8 D.P.\nP less than -01 .3106-1\n\f149] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 221\nand the same would be true if we followed on from KN 3103, adding\nmerely the last two items, for we should then have\n^\n2 = 51.4932 with 28 D. F., and P again less than -01 ...3106-2\nIt would appear, therefore, that the statistical significance of the\nresults is not in doubt and that the effects observed cannot reason-\nably be ascribed to chance.\nSummary and Conclusions\n34\nIn the first part of this paper, while considering various routine\ncomparisons, we have occasion to note the remarkable stability of\nthe controls \u201c Feda \u201d and \u201c Silver \u201d, particularly as regards KT, as\ncompared with the normal personalities of their mediums ;\nin the\ncase of Feda, this applies to long periods of months as well as to the\nshorter period covering a set of sittings. The implication is that the\ncontrols are derived from relatively \u201c deep \u201d and permanent strata\nof the total personality, of a nature not easily disturbed by the\n\u201c changes and chances of this mortal fife \u201d.\nSomewhat similarly, we find that the reproduction test appears\nto penetrate to deeper and more permanent levels than does the\nreaction time ;\nbut there are certain anomahes, and it would be\nunwise to suppose that the two sorts of \u201c depth \u201d thus indicated are\nof the same kind.\nVery remarkable is the striking resemblance of Feda to Silver,\nespecially on RT ;\nin the case of inter- fist tests Feda carries this to\nthe extent of being more hke Silver than she is like herself\u2014an\nanomaly which calls for explanation.\nIn the second part we have seen how it is possible to devise and\napply a method which will eliminate from the reactions of two\ncommunicators tested with different medimns all effects due to\nsimilarities between the communicator states of those mediums\nthemselves. VTien this is done on so detailed a scale that we can\ndeal with the statistics of the resultant statistics, we find that the\nresults are not attributable to chance, while there is no reason to\nsuppose, and ample reason to doubt, that they are artifactual.\nWhen Leonard material is tested against Leonard, instead of\nagainst Sharplin, negative results predominate ;\nthe reason for this\nis at present entirely obscure to me, but it should be noted that the\neffect is apparently not of the same kind as the countersimilarity\n\f222 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part 149]\npreviously noted in the case of controls. When we fully understand\nthe imphcations of this curious fact (which, frankly, I do not at the\nmoment) and can produce a plausible theory to account for it, we\nshall, I fancy, have made a considerable advance in our under-\nstanding of trance mediumship.\n35\nAs regards the main point at issue, namely whether there is or is\nnot adequate evidence for the operation of some extraneous influence\n(presumably\u2014though not, perhaps, inevitably\u2014something in the\nnature of what John and Etta claim to be), I can only adopt this\nposition\nIf nothing more important that a few million pounds or the fate\nof a couple of nations were involved, I should feel disposed to declare\nflatly that the operation of some such extraneous influence had been\nestabhshed, and to leave it at that. But since the admission of such\na conclusion, arrived at for the first time in history by the use of\nexact quantitative methods, would open up prospects beside which\nthe achievements of relativity theory woifld be of no more than\nparochial interest, I prefer to make precaution doubly cautious and\nnot to commit myself (if ever) till I have reworked the entire calcu-\nlation, with the additional refinements indicated and the additional\nmaterial now being collected.\nIf we then obtain the same results, or more so, we may reasonably\nconclude that there is \u201c something there \u201d, and apply ourselves to\nthe more dehcate task of deciding what it is.\n\fTable I\nIndividual Consistencies (\u201c I \u201d)\nPeeson-\nEN ALITY \u00ab p V\n\/o\nPeecextages from\nEarlier Experiments\nReaction Times\n3001 L \u20223342 10-4 32-2 Lj 26-7 ;\nL, 42-9\nFi 21 -\n0 ;\nF3\n41-3\n2 F \u20223831 10-6 36-5\n3 J \u20221944 \u202201 19-2 Ji 15-2\n4 E \u20221485 \u202206 14-7 El 10-2\n5 S \u20221024 \u202220 11-0\n6 S' \u20225861 10-9 52-7\n7 J' \u20221990 \u2022013 19-6\n3008 E' \u20222610 \u2022001 25-5\nReproductions\n3009 L \u20220857 \u202228 8-5 Li 26-6 ;\nLg 15-0\n10 F \u20223144 10-4 30-4 Fi 25-5 ;\nF3\n39-3\n1 J \u20222570 \u2022001 25-2 Ji 28-0\n= 2 E \u20222750 \u2022001 26-8 Ej 39-0\n3 S \u20222370 \u2022003 23-3 {N.B.

Thouless\nI. Introduction\nMy function in the present paper, as I understand it, is not primarily\nto express my own opinion as to the conclusions that may legiti-\nmately be drawn from Mr Whately Carington\u2019s investigation of\ntrance personahties.^ My more important task is to try to give\nsuch an account of his methods as may enable even those who are\nnot famihar with the mathematical devices which he employs to\nunderstand these methods sufficiently for them to judge the experi-\nments for themselves. The importance of the experiments is obvious.\nWhatever the answer may prove to be, it is a considerable achieve-\nment to have devised a method of submitting to quantitative and\nstatistical test, the problem of whether the alleged spirits which\ncommunicate through mediums are the autonomous personahties\nthey claim to be or whether they are merely organisations within\nthe medium\u2019s own personahty.\n^ This paper was read in an abbreviated form at a Private Meeting of the\nSociety on June 30, 1937.\n^ \u201c The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities,\u201d I, II and III, W.\nWhately Carington, Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, xlii,\npp. 173-240 ;\nxlui, pp. 319-361 ;\nand xliv, pp. 189-222. These are hereafter\nreferred to as TP 1 , TP 2 and TP 3 respectively.\nN 223\n\f224 Robert H. Thouless [part\nWe must all admire the industry with which the author has\nlaboured, the boldness and originality of his design, and the perse-\nverance with which he has overcome difficulties. I understand that\nhe knew little of statistical methods when he started and has had\nto acquire this knowledge in the course of his work. If he has made\nmistakes, as I think he has, this is less remarkable than the fact\nthat he has acquired mastery of a complicated mathematical\ntechnique which he required as a tool for his investigation.\nI think that such work deserves that we should examine and\ncriticise it with as much care as the author has put into the investi-\ngation. Probably many of us who would be willing to do this have\nfound the task rather a formidable one. Certainly I found it so\nmyself. The author has not made it easy for the reader to follow\nhim, and many readers probably feel themselves wholly debarred\nfrom following him by the fact that he uses statistical methods\nwhich make his pages fearful with formulae.\nUnfamiliarity with statistical methods is really no reason why\nany reader should not be able to form his own opinion as to the\nconclusions of the work. Statistics are only an intermediate step\nin drawing a conclusion as to fact. The final step is a logical one.\nIf we are told what relationships are mdicated by statistical methods,\nwe need not be mathematicians to see what conclusions can be drawn\nfrom these relationships. My purpose then is to demonstrate the\nstatistical methods used by W. W. C. so far as is necessary for\nimderstanding what sort of conclusions they point to, to say whether\nI think the statistical reasoning is sound, and finally to put my\nreaders into a position in which they can ask for themselves the final\nlogical question ;\n\u201c What does it all prove?\n\u201d\nII. Problems and Methods\nThe ultimate problem of Mr Whately Carington is whether the\ncontrols and the communicators in mediumistic seances are, as they\nclaim to be, autonomous jjersonalities, or whether they are secondary\npersonalities of the medium. A completely convincing answer to\nthat question may, of course, be remote, and the more immediate\naim of his research has been to develop a technique of experimenta-\ntion and of treating the raw data of his results, and to discover\nwhether there is reasonable hope that this kind of experiment will\nbe able ultimately to provide a complete or partial answer to this\nquestion. A secondary object of the research was that, if it did not\nprovide evidence for the existence of communicating spirits, it\nshould give information about the psychology of trance states.\n\f150] Revieiv of Carington^s Work on Trance Personalities 225\nThe first of these problems we may call (in W. W. C.\u2019s terminology)\nthe prol)lem of the \u201c antonomy of commnnicators There are\ntwo main alternatives to be tested (with certain intermediate\npossibilities). First, there is the spiritist explanation of communi-\ncators, that they are really different and autonomous personalities\nwho can communicate through one medium or through another.\nThe other possibility is that they are merely unconscious creations\nof the medium in the trance state, or at best secondary personalities\nof the medium.\nWhen we speak of the possibility that John and Etta are different\npersonalities, we mean primarily that they are different iii the same\nsort of way as any two hving persons are diiferent. The matter is\ncomplicated by the fact that, if we judge difference of personality\nby difference of character and interests, we all know that one and\nthe same person may differ considerably in these respects at different\ntimes. Also, of course, truly different personahties may appear\nmore or less similar in any characteristics that we can use to identify\nthem. The changes in a single human being may be so great that\nwe speak of \u201c double personality \u201d. This simply means that,\nwithin the l i mits of a single human body, there are differences of\npersonality as great as we commonly find between two bodies. In\nconsidering how great a difference must exist between communi-\ncators before they can be considered to be different personahties,\nit may be necessary to bear in mind the possibility (mentioned by\nW. W. C.) that the separateness between personalities may be less\ncomplete in the spirit world than in this world. J. and E., even\nthough both were autonomous communicating spirits, might have\nmore in common than J. and E. had in this life. This would not\nprevent W. W. C.\u2019s latest method (developed in TP 3) from identi-\nfying them as autonomous personalities provided that anything\nremained peculiar to J. and to E. respectively through whatever\nmedium they communicated. If, however, there were after death\na continuing existence in which all individuality was lost and all\npersonalities were fused in one world-soul, I see no possibility that\nevidence for such continuance could be oljtained in this way. Nor\nwould there then seem to be any sense in which we could speak of\nautonomous spirit personalities. The method can only reveal spirit\ncommunicators who, communicating through different mediums,\nretain some individual characteristics in which they differ from other\ncommunicators.\nMr Whately Carington began his enquiry by devising methods of\nmeasuring the amount of similarity or difference l^etween different\ntrance personahties by finding out how much they resembled each\n\f226 Robert H. Thouless [PABT\nother or differed from each other in their performance in the \u201c word-\nassociation test While the methods of using the data obtained\nwere changed a great deal in the course of the investigation, the use\nof the word-association test as the source of the data was retained\nthroughout.\nThis is a test well known in psychological laboratories, although\napphcation to this problem was altogether new when W. W. C.\nstarted his work.^ The method was used by Jung in order to in-\nvestigate the emotional complexes of his patients. A series of words\nwas called out to the subjects who were required to respond, as\nquickly as possible, with the first word that came into their minds.\nThe time taken for the response was noted by means of a stop-watch.\nThis is the \u201c reaction time \u201d (W. W. C.\u2019s RT). At the end of the\nexperiment the same fist was called out again and the subject was\nasked to try to respond with the same word as before. This is the\n\u201c reproduction test \u201d (W. W. C.\u2019s RPN). The fact that a word had\na hidden emotional significance was said to be shown by the fact\nthat it has an unusually long reaction time, and that there was a\nstrong tendency for a failure in reproduction, that is, for a different\nword to be given as response on the second reading of the list.\nAnother measure of the emotional significance of the word may be\nobtained by connecting the subject with a suitable system of\nelectrical apparatus and noting the change in his electrical resist-\nance when he responds to the word (the psycho-galvanic reflex\nor PGR). High emotional significance is shown by a large drop in\nresistance.\nAlthough W. W. C. used the PGR in his early experiments, he\ndid not find it a satisfactory tool for his purpose, and, in this survey,\nwe need not bother about it but confine our attention to reaction\ntimes and reproductions. I shall use the word \u201c response \u201d as a\ngeneral term to cover both RT and RPN. We must remember that\nunusually long reaction time indicates the same kind of thing as\nfailure of reproduction.\nI think the experimental psychologist would feel more happy about\nMr Whately Carington\u2019s work if somewhat fuller details could be\ngiven of the exact methods employed in applying the test, and if a\nsmall sample could be given of the actual raw results of the test.\nPerhaps both of these deficiencies may be remedied in a future\npubhcation.\nThe same test was apphed, at (I think always) the same sitting\nto the control and to different communicators who were communi-\ncating through the medium, and results were obtained generally\n^ Since then, the method has also been used by Mr Hereward Carrington.\n\f150]\nReview of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 227\non six different occasions. These six sets of readings for any\n\u201c personahty \u201d were treated together for the subsequent mathe-\nmatical working out of results.\nIII. The Course op the Investigation\u2014Kecantations\nAND CONCLUSIONS\nWith admirable open-mindedness, IVIr Whately Carington has\nbeen very ready to change his opinions between successive publica-\ntions. No one will blame him for this, but it does make it rather\ndifficult for the reader to get an idea of the investigation as a whole,\nsince in reading TP(r?-), he must bear in mind what part of it has\nbeen repudiated in TP(m + 1), and having read the last of the series\nhe may wonder how much of that will be repudiated in the still\nnnpubhshed next one. This source of difficulty could, of course,\nhave been avoided if the author had felt himself able to postpone\npublication until all criticisms by himself or others could have been\nconsidered, and it is to be hoped that when the investigation is\nbrought together in its final form it will be given the self-consistency\nof which circumstances have now deprived it.\nUntil then, we must try as well as we can to bring the parts into\nrelationship with each other, and I will try to give a brief account of\nthe conclusions which have been advanced, and which have been\nlater withdrawn. The author has very kindly indicated to me what\nparts of TP 3 will be repudiated in TP 4.\nFirst, in TP 1 we have a description of experimental and statistical\ntechniques, which, with a few modifications, were used throughout.\nMethods of calculating indices of \u201c similarity \u201d and \u201c difference\n\u201d\nare explained in an appendix. This paper is written wfith the as-\nsumption (that seemed to W. W. C. to be justified by his own earlier\nexperiments) that one and the same personality will always produce\nsets of reactions which are not significantly different.\nThe most important change of opinion in TP 2 is that this assump-\ntion is given up. Mr Gatty tested by Mr Besterman had shown that\nhe produced|significantly different sets of reactions by merely imagin-\ning himself in different life-situations. This makes W. W. C.\u2019s\nproblem much more difficult since it is no longer possible to conclude\nthe autonomy of a communicator merely from the fact that his\nreactions are significantly different from those of the medium, and\nmore complex methods of solving the problem must be sought.\nWe may indeed notice that, since Mr Gatty was not tested in really\ndifferent but only imagined different situations, and since he does\nnot appear to be a particularly unstable person, it may be doubted\n\f228 Robert H. Thouless [part\nwhether the range of \u201c differences \u201d between different phases of the\nsame person may not be much greater than is revealed by the\nBesterman-Gatty experiment.\nIn Part III of TP 2 an important argument is developed that\nthere is a relationship of \u201c countersimilarity \u201d between mediums\nand controls and that this is evidence that controls are secon-\ndary personahties of the medium. This argument is dealt with\nlater in the present paper. It is not modified in any way later by\nw. w. c.\nIn Part V of TP 2, the author tackles the autonomy of communi-\ncators tentatively by a new method. The same communicators\nare tested but with different mediums. The communicators turn\nout to be \u201c similar \u201d to themselves even when the mediums are\ndifferent. This cannot be taken directly as a measure of the real\nsimilarity of the communicators to themselves unless we can first\neliminate the effect of the \u201c similarity \u201d of the mediums. This\nW. W. C. here attempts to do by the method of partial correlation*\nHe puts forward his conclusions very tentatively with some doubt\nas to the legitimacy of the method.\nIn TP 3, he decides (as a result of Professor Fisher\u2019s criticism)\nthat the method of partial correlation cannot legitimately be used\nfor this data. This does not mean a complete abandonment of this\nkind of enquiry (the \u201c inter-medium method \u201d) but only of the\nparticular statistical method used in TP 2. Another method based\non analysis of variance is, used in TP 3 on the inter-medium data*\nAt the end of TP 3, the author suggested that evidence for the\nautonomy of communicators had become very strong although he\nwas not satisfied that it was sufficiently so for complete conviction.\nFurther criticism from Professor Fisher caused this claim also to be\nabandoned.^ Unfortunately, these conclusions were largely based\non \u201c reproduction \u201d material. A reproduction score must either be\n-fl or 0, so it cannot be distributed even approximately in the\n\u201c normal \u201d distribution assumed in the mathematical method of\n\u201c analysis of variance \u201d used by W. W. C. While relations of\ndifference and similarity may be indicated by the z for \u201c reproduc-\ntion \u201d data obtained hy the analysis of variance, neither the amount\nof this z nor its calculated standard error can be rehed on. This\nobjection does not apply to reaction times and, presumably,\nTP 4 will deal with the work that W. W. C. is now engaged on,\n^ I am here importing recantations and new work not yet published by\nW. W. C. which he lias kindly communicated to me by letter. I should like\nto take this opportunity of acknowledging the friendly help which has been\ngiven to me by the author in all my study of his work.\n\f150] Review of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 229\nof seeing how far the same results emerge from reaction time data\nalone.\nW. W. C. also considers that a mistake was made in this section\nin the inclusion of two sets of data from the same medium (Mrs\nLeonard). Since the object of TP 3 was to find out whether a com-\nmunicator, ostensibly the same individual communicating through\ndifferent mediums, gave evidence that he was really the same, the\ninclusion of two sets of data from the same medium was obviously\na mistake, because a positive result would have shown only that\n(John communicating through Mrs Leonard) at one time was the\nsame as Jj^ at another time, which would have been much less\nstrong evidence of the autonomous existence of John than would\ndemonstration of the identity of Jj^ with John as communicating\nthrough another medium.\nOne rather important recantation of the methods of TP 3 is of\nW. \\V. C.\u2019s unfortunate excursion into Hall and Knight\u2019s algebra\nin paras. 32 and 33 for a method of combining independent proba-\nbilities. This he now gives up altogether.\nTo sum up. The general method of experimenting remains the\nsame at the end as at the beginning. For different reasons, both the\n\u201c psychogalvanic \u201d responses, and the records of reproductions,\nhave been now discarded. This really matters very little ;\nW. W. C.\nneeded only one of the three kinds of response for his purpose, and\nhe has found out by experience that the reaction-time records best\nserve his needs. The general method of argument in TP 3 is retained\nalthough many of its details are now regarded by W. W. C. as\nmistaken. This method, simplified and amplified and apphed to\nreaction time data, will form the foundation of his next contribution\nThe conclusion in TP 3 is no longer defended on the evidence there\npresented. The conclusion that controls are countersimilar to\nmediums seems alone to have suffered no vicissitudes and remains\nnow as stated in TP 2.\nThere is one point al^out these recantations that I should like to\nmake clear. They might easily be represented by an unsympathetic\ncritic as merely a process by which Mr Whately Carington has\nblundered from one error into another. I think, on the contrary,\nthat they are a process by which his technique of enr^uiry has passed\nfrom a relatively poor one to a good one. The methods used in TP 3\nare enormously better than those in TP 1 although TP 3 happens\nto be disfigured in its later part by serious errors. Probably every\nscientific investigator improves his methods of working by a process\nof trial and error. It is only unfortunate that the \u201c error \u201d part of\nthis process has in W. W. C.\u2019s case been immortalised in print.\n\f230 Robert H. Thouless [PABT\nIV. The Measure op \u201c Similarity\n\u201d\nWe may remind ourselves of the nature of the results for any\none \u201c personahty For each of the six sittings there was a set\nof \u201c reaction times \u201d which were the times in seconds that he had\ntaken to respond to each word. Certain devices of scaling were used\n(clearly explained and adequately justified by the author in TP 2)\nin order to get rid of irregularities caused by abnormally long\nreaction times. The reaction times, so corrected, were the raw\nmaterial for what W. W. C. calls the RT data. The raw mate-\nrial for his RPN data were marks of 1 put opposite words that\nhad been correctly reproduced on the second reading of the list,\nand of 0 against those that were incorrectly reproduced or not at all.\nIt is clear that two lists of responses (for the sake of clearness\nlet us think of reaction times) obtained at any sitting from two\npersonahties, may either resemble or dilfer from each other to any\ndegree. Also it is clear that there is more than one respect in which\nthey may be said to be similar or to dilfer. Two sets of reaction\ntimes in which every word caused exactly the same time of response\nto botli personalities would obviously be exactly similar on any\nmethod of reckoning. Let us suppose, however, that one personality\nalways took exactly twice as long as the other in responding to each\nword. The two lists would then be dissimilar if we took the mean\ntime of response as our criterion of similarity, but would be exactly\nsimilar if we took as our criterion the general shape of the pattern\nof response time, that is, the proportion of each response time to\nthe average time for the personahty making it.\nIt is in the second sense that W. W. C. measures \u201c similarity \u201d.\nTwo fists are \u201c similar \u201d if a word wfiicfi causes in one personality\na response winch is long for liim, causes in the other personality a\nresponse which is similarly long for him, irrespective of whether\nthe absolute times are or are not the same. His reason for choosing\ntins criterion of similarity is, I think, that he finds in practice that\nit is a better indication of how much the personalities really resemble\neach other than would be, let us say, a comparison of their average\ntimes. Also I think that this might reasonably be expected and is\nthe most commonly used criterion of resemblance in everyday fife.\nWe say, for example, tfiat a small boy resembles his father because\nhis features, although they differ much in absolute size from those\nof his father, are related to each other in the same way as his father\u2019s ;\nhis nose is absolutely much shorter than his father\u2019s but, like his\nfather\u2019s, it is long in proportion to the other features of his face,\nand so on.\n\f160] Review of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 231\nThe detection of similarities of this kind is a common problem\nin apphed psychology. It is the measurement of a \u201c correlation\nIf three boys had marks in a Greek examination of 70%, 60% and\n50% respectively, and in a Latin examination of 85%, 80% and\n75%, we should say that these two sets of results were completely\ncorrelated. A boy who did well or badly in Greek would do corres-\npondingly well or badly in Latin. The conclusion we should be\nhkely to draw would be that the two examinations measured the\nsame mental capacity. If on the other hand, a boy who did well\nin Greek proved always to do correspondingly badly in Latin, we\nshould say that the two sets of results were completely negatively\ncorrelated. If there were no relationship either positive or negative\nbetween the two orders they would be uncorrelated.\nW. W. C.\u2019s method of measuring \u201c similarity \u201d is, in effect, the\nmeasurement of a correlation. The average size of response of one\npersonahty A to the first word of the word list, his average response\nto the second, to the third, and so on, form one series. The other\nseries is formed by the average responses to these same words given\nby a second personahty B. The amount of correlation between\nthese two series is a measure of the similarity of the two personalities\nin the sense in which W. W. C. is speaking of similarity. The\nresponses used for this measurement may be reaction times, repro-\nductions, or psychogalvanic reflexes, so for the same pair of per-\nsonahties there may be calculated an RT similarity, an RPN\nsimilarity and a PGR similarity.\nThe most famihar way of calculating a correlation is by the use\nof the \u201c Bravais-Pearson \u201d formula which gives a measurement (the\ncorrelation coefficient or r) which is -fl for complete positive\ncorrelation, - 1 for complete negative correlation, and 0 for no\ncorrelation, and, of course, some intermediate value between 0 and\n-fl for such degrees of similarity as are commonly met with in\npractice which faU short of perfect correlation in various amounts.\nW. W. C. does not, in fact, use the Bravais-Pearson formula but\nobtains a measurement of the amoxmt of correlation by the use of\nthe method of analysis of variance. This gives a quantity 2 which\nalso measures the degree of similarity of the mean responses of the\ntwo personahties concerned to the same words of the word list.\nThis quantity z can be derived from r by a simple arithmetical\ntransformation and differs from r in the fact that for perfect cor-\nrelation it would be infinite iustead of being unity. Those who are\nused to thinking of degrees of correlation in terms of the correlation\ncoefficient r may find it helpful to remember that, for small values,\nz is only slightly greater than r, the difference being less than 10%\n\fRobert H. Thouless\n232 [part\nwhen z is 0-5, so below this value we shall not be far wrong to think\nof z as equal to r.\nRealising that, to many of his readers, very little idea of the\ndegree of similarity is conveyed by the statement that z is, let us\nsay, 0-43, W. W. C. in his last paper transforms this into a percentage\nof similarity by converting it into the corresponding r and multi-\nplying by lOOd Thus the above similarity would be expressed as\na 40% similarity. The formula used [r = - l)\/(e^^ -t 1)] is strictly\nonly the correct one for deriving r from z when (as in \u201c similarity\n\u201d\nmeasurements) only two series are compared aiifl not, therefore, for\nthe measurement of \u201c individualities \u201d (see Section VII) for which\nit is also used. This, however, does not, I think, matter since\nW. W. C. is quite justified in defining what he means by \u201c percentage\nindividuahty \u201d as 100 x (e^^ - l)\/(e^* -fl), whether or not this is\nequivalent to 100 x r.\nThe occurrence of a positive measurement of similarity is, of\ncourse, a merely mathematical fact whose interest for us lies in its\nindication of the psychological fact that the two personalities\nresemble each other. Since confusion may arise by using the one\nword similarity for the mathematical indication of a fact and also\nfor the fact it indicates, I shall use inverted commas for \u201c similarity\n\u201d\n(or W. W. C.\u2019s symbol \u201c S \u201d) when what is meant is the mathematical\nfact that there is a positive value of z in the similarity measurements,\nreserving the word similarity without inverted commas for the fact\nof resemblance. As will be discussed in more detail later, \u201c similar-\nity \u201d must exceed a certain minimum value (the lowest value for\nsignificance) before it can be treated as evidence of similarity.\nIf we measured the \u201c similarity \u201d of human faces by the method\nsuggested as analogous to W. W. C.\u2019s measure of \u201c similarity \u201d in\nresponses to the word-association test i.e. by measuring the\ncorrelation between the measurements of the features of any two\nfaces\u2014we shoidd find that some faces, such as those of relatives,\nresembled each other closely while others resembled each other less\nbut that in no one was resemblance altogether .absent. Mr Whately\nCarington\u2019s face and my own are not very similar as human faces\ngo, but would be much more \u201c similar \u201d than would be either of\nour faces to that, let us say, of a chimpanzee. The common human\nform would itself give a certain degree of \u201c similarity \u201d. Thus if,\nfrom the \u201c similarity \u201d of a face seen at one time to that seen at\nanother time, we wanted to prove that they were one and the same\nface, we could not be content merely to infer this from the fact\nthat our measurements showed high \u201c similarity \u201d. It would be\n\u00bb TP 3, p. 192.\n\f150] Review of Carington\u2019s Worh on Trance Perso7ialities 233\nnecessary to show that this \u201c similarity \u201d was greater than that\nfound in a large range of comparisons between different people\u2019s\nfaces.\nThere is the same reason for expecting very generally some degree\nof \u201c similarity \u201d between different persons in their responses to a\nword hst. Most people, for example, may be expected to give longer\nreaction times to \u201c dead \u201d on W. W. C.\u2019s hst than to \u201c window \u201d\n(TP 1, p. 223). So far as they react to words of common human\ninterest, they will tend to be \u201c similar One man\u2019s individual\nhistory may, however, give strong emotional significance to \u201c shijj\n\u201d\nwhich does not exist for another. Such individual differences will\ntend to make their reactions differ. If, however, there are words\nto which all personalities tend alike to give prolonged responses,\nthere will be a general tendency for all personahties to show more\nor less positive \u201c similarity \u201d, tending, of course, to be greater if\nthe personalities really closely resemble each other. This general\ntendency to resemble each other is what W. W. C. calls the \u201c common\nhumanity \u201d factor.\nSince the resemblance due to common humanity may be present\nin any comparison between two personalities, we caimot, merely\nby measuring their similarity and finding it high, prove that a\npersonahty A communicating through one medium is really the\nsame as one claiming also to be A communicating through another\nmedium. This difficulty was fully reahsed by W. W. C. m the later\nstages of his research (in TP 3) when he adopted a method of\ndemonstrating identity less simple but entirely free from this ob-\njection. The seriousness of the difficulty was certainly not realised\nby him at the early stages of the research. In the first pages of TP 1,\nfor example, he compared the quantities obtained by the reaction\ntime test with the measurement of finger-prints for the identification\nof criminals. Unhappily the analogy is imperfect in its most\nimportant quantitive aspect. By comparing a small number of\npoints of coincidence between finger-prints, identity can be estab-\nhshed because the similarity is greater than could be found once in\na billion times between two different people. In a mental test on\nthe other hand, at best, the degree of resemblance between two\nperformances by the same person is no greater than can be found in\na not very large range of different people. This seems to be j^arti-\ncularly true of the word association test, as may be seen by the very\nlow measurements for self-consistency obtained by W. W. C. (TP 2,\ntable II). The attempt to identify personalities by their reaction\ntime responses is as different as it can well be from identifying them\nby their finger-prints.\n\f234 Robert H. Thouless [part\nWe have already said that \u201c similarity \u201d as measured in this way\nwill tend on the whole to be greater in those personalities which\nmost closely resemble each other. This, however, is a different\nthing from saying that the amount of a \u201c similarity \u201d measurement\nmeasures the degree of similarity between the two personahties.\nCorrelation coefficients are, in fact, often used as measures of degree\nof resemblance but this usage is generally agreed to be improper.\nIn truth, a measure of correlation depends 2\n)artly but not wholly\non the degree of similarity of the series compared. This means\nthat we cannot properly conclude that two personalities A and B\nresemble each other more than do C and D from the fact that A\nand B have a higher z for \u201c similarity \u201d than have C and D. It\nseems, therefore, that much of the discussion in TP 1, j^aras. 21\nonwards, of the amount by which different personalities in a mani-\nfold resemble each other, is based on mistaken j^remises and should\nbe discarded or attemjffed by other methods. A significant \u201c S\n\u201d\nmeasurement indicates that there is similarity between the personal-\nities compared, but the relative sizes of the z for different person-\nahties is a very uncertain indication of the degree of similarity\nbetween them.\nI do not think that the conception of \u201c counter-similarity\n\u201d\nshould offer any obstacle to understanding. This is the relationship\nmore commonly known as \u201c negative correlation \u201d. If we found\nthat those people who took the most medicine were on the whole\nin the worst health, this would be a \u201c negative correlation \u201d or\n\u201c counter-similarity \u201d between medicine-taking and good health.\nThis would be as definite evidence of a causal connection between\nmedicine-taking and health as would be a \u201c positive correlation\n\u201d\nor \u201c similarity \u201d, thus differing altogether in its indication from\nthe mere absence of correlation which suggests no causal connection.\nThe features of any two human faces are \u201c similar \u201d ;\na human\nface and a jjlaster mould of a face would be \u201c counter-similar\n\u201d\nwhereas the features of a human face and the roughnesses on the\nsurface of a seed j3otato would, I exjject, show zero similarity. In\nthese three cases we should find the z calculated for \u201c similarity\n\u201d\nto be positive, negative and zero respectively.\nV. The Measurement of \u201c Difference \u201d by Analysis\nOF Variance\nW. W. C. makes an estimate not only of the \u201c similarity \u201d of the\npersonalities investigated but also of their \u201c difference \u201d. The\nmethod of doing this is explained also in Appendix II of TP 1.\n\f150]\nReview of Carington's Work on Trance Personalities 235\nIt does not appear from such enquiries as I have made that many of\nhis readers have understood this part of his work. The matter is\ndifficult in itself, particularly to those who have no previous ac-\nquaintance with the mathematical methods used. Its difficulty\nhas not been reduced by the not infrequent obscurity of W. W. C.\u2019s\nexposition and the occurrence of too frequent misprints. I shall\ntry in this section to clarify the issues involved. It is possible that\nI may not succeed and then the criticisms I have directed against\nW. W. C.\u2019s obscurity must fall equally on my own head.\nOne of the most obvious difficulties which readers have met is\nthat of understanding what is meant by \u201c difference \u201d in W. W. C.\u2019s\nmeasurements. In ordinary speech, similarity and difference are\nopposites. If we say that two faces are similar, we mean the same\nas if we say that they are not different. More exactly (since simi-\nlarity and difference may exist in any degree) we should say that\nthe more similar are two faces, the less different they are, and vice\nversa. With these ordinarily accepted meanings of similarity and\ndifference in our minds, we may find ourselves puzzled by some of\nthe relationships indicated in W. W. C.\u2019s papers. That some pairs\nof personahties appear to be both similar and different is not a real\ndifficulty. Any two things that are not completely similar will be\nsimilar to some extent and different to some extent. What, however,\nare we to make of such observations as that of Mrs Leonard (normal)\nand Mrs Leonard (prepared) [TP 1, p. 200] who are stated to be\nneither similar nor different? Does \u201c difference \u201d here mean\n\u201c dissimilarity \u201d or does it mean something else?\nWe can only discover exactly what is meant by these terms by\nexamining how they are measured. I think it may save perplexity\nif I indicate here what seems to me to be the true answer to the\nabove question, which will be more fully justified later. W. W. C.\u2019s\n\u201c difference \u201d measurement is not a measnrement simply of difference\nbut of consistency of difference. We can put this m other words\nand say that it measures not simply dissimilarity but consistency\nof dissimilarity. The quantity z obtained in comparing any two\npersonalities for difference may be small because the reactions of\nthe two personalities do not much differ or because, although they\ndiffer, they do not show consistency in their differences on different\noccasions. If the D measurement is low only for the first of these\ntwo reasons, the S measurement is hkely to be correspondingly high,\nbut not if it is lack of consistency that makes the D measurements\nlow. Lack of self-consistency in either of the personahties compared\nwill also reduce the S measurement for that comparison. So it may\neasily happen that both S measurement and D measurement are\n\f236 Robert H. Thouless [part\nlow for tlie comparison l^etween any two personalities. This does\nnot mean that the personalities com])ared are neither similar nor\ndil'ferent, but that any similarity or difference that exist have been\nobscrrred by the lack of self-consistency in the measurements.\n\\V. W. C.\u2019s phrase on the page cited above :\n\u201c The two states\nmay be regarded as quite neutral, so to speak, with respect to each\nother \u201d seems to me, therefore, to be incorrect. The peculiarity\nrevealed is a peculiarity of the measurements and not of the states\nmeasured.\nIt is a perpetual source of discouragement to those who try to\nread modern investigations in experimental psychology (and in\nother biological sciences) that their pages are full of statistical\ncalculations. Except for those who have been endowed with a\njrerverse taste for mathematical puzzles, these are generally regarded\nas ])arts to skip. In great part, there is no reason why they should\nnot be skipped by most readers. They are merely (as has already\nbeen indicated) necessary prehminaries to a logical step and it is\nthis logical step in which we are primarily interested. Statistical\nmethods are used to discover whether a set of figures indicate\nanything, and, if they have been honestly and competently per-\nformed, we may take their results for granted and go on to ask\nwhat the figures do indicate. Sometimes, however, the statistics and\nthe logic of an argument are not sufficiently independent for it to be\npossible to know what conclusions are indicated unless we have some\nrough idea of the preceding statistical steps. That is, I think, the\ncase in this investigation. It is not necessary that a reader should\nunderstand the method of using the analysis of variance either in\nthe sense that he sees why successive steps are taken or even in the\nsense that he could use it competently himself. It is necessary, how-\never, if he is to form a reasonable opinion of the work, that he should\nsee the kind of thing the analysis of variance is getting at.\nNo very great mental effort is required for this. The basic problem\nto be solved by the analysis of variance is a simple one, and the\nmethod of solving it is also fundamentally simple. Although in\nanalysing a large table, the figures dealt with may be uncomfortably\nbig, the arithmetical operations themselves are only those of multipli-\ncation and addition which are familiar to the average child of ten.\nWe may illustrate the arithmetic of the method by an example\ndrawn from a more concrete field than that of W. W. C.\u2019s data.\nLet us suppose that a group of seven poultry-keepers differ as to\nwhose hens lay the most eggs. A sceptical onlooker says that none\nof them is a more successful jjoultry-keejrer than another, that\nsometimes one and sometimes another is lucky, and gets most eggs\n\f150] Review of Carington'\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 237\nin any particular period, but that on the average there is no differ-\nence between them. The dispute is referred to an impartial referee.\nIn order to keep this case as closely parallel as possible to\nW. W. C.\u2019s, we shall suppose that the referee is not required to\ndecide a dispute between the poultry-keepers as to which is the\nmost successful, but the dispute between all of them and the\nsceptical outsider as to whether there is any real difference between\nthem with respect to their success. In any case, this is the first\nquestion. Unless there is a real difference, there can be no question\nof which is best.\nThe referee l^egins by making a random selection of five rej^re-\nsentative hens from each yard and keeps them under his observation\nfor a fortnight, and records the number of eggs laid by each. He\ncan write these in a table (as Table I below), in which after the name\nof each poultry-keeper he writes the number of eggs laid by each\nof his five hens (columns 1-5).\nTable I\n(1) (i) (3) (B (5) (6)\nTotals\n(7)\nAverages\n(8)\nSums of\nsquares of\ndeviations\nfrom average\n(9)\nA dev. 2\/4\nBrown 8 8 8 6 5 35 7 8 2-0\nSmith 5 8 5 5 7 30 6 8 2-0\nJones 5 6 6 7 6 30 6 2 0-5\nScott 4 2 7 3 4 20 4 14 3-5\nBriggs 4 8 3 9 6 30 6 26 6-5\nWebb 7 11 11 7 4 40 8 36 9-0\nThomas 4 7 4 6 4 25 5 8 2-0\nAverage = 6 Total = 102 Mean = 3-64\nThese are his data. He must now perform the necessary calcula-\ntions to discover what (if any) conclusions he can draw from them.\nHis first step is the obvious one of findmg the average number of\neggs obtained from the five hens of Brown, from the five of Smith,\nand so on. These he writes under the word \u201c averages \u201d in the\nseventh column.\nThis column 7 is obviously the important one for the referee. If\nhe were sufficiently a simpleton, he might be content to notice that\nthese averages differed amongst themselves and conclude that this\nwas in itself sufficient evidence that there was a real difference\n\f238 Robert H. Thouless [part\nbetween the different owners with respect to the laying power of\ntheir hens, and so award the victory to them against the sceptical\noutsider. This would, however, obviously be fallacious since the\nreferee would have failed to take into account the fact that the\ndifferent hens of the same owner had laid different numbers of eggs,\nand that even if they had been seven sets of five hens drawn from\nthe same yard, their averages would not have been identical, for\nwe cannot expect identical averages from samples whose members\ndiffer amongst themselves. Even if there is no real difference\nbetween the samples, their averages will differ by an amount which\ndepends on how much tlie individual hens of the same owner differ\namongst themselves.\nThe task of the referee is, therefore, to decide whether these\ndifferences between the average number of eggs per hen obtained\nby the different poidtry-keepers are greater than the differences\nthat would result merely from the fact that each is an average from\na set of numbers differing amongst themselves. Unless they are,\nit is obvious that the results of the test provide no evidence whatever\nthat one poultry-keeper is better or more successful than another.\nIn order to establish whether or not this is the case, the referee\nmust have some way of measuring the \u201c scatter \u201d {i.e. the degree\nof difference) of a set of differing numbers, and also he must know\nhow much scatter will be caused amongst a set of averages by a\ngiven amount of scatter in the figures from which they have been\ncalculated.\nIn order to get a measure of the scatter of any set of figures, he\nfirst finds out how much each of the figures differs from the average\nof the set, he squares each of these amounts and adds all the squares\ntogether. He then divides by the number of \u201c degrees of freedom \u201d,\ni.e. the number of the figures which could be independently varied\nwhile keeping the same mean. This divisor is, therefore, one less\nthan the number of figures in the set.\nFor example, the set of averages given in column 7 of Table I have\na mean of 6. Their separate deviations from this mean are : -fl,\n0, 0, -2, 0, -f-2, -1. Squared, these become: -fl, 0, 0, -f4, 0,\n-f4, +U. The sum of these squares is 10, which divided by 6 (one\n* If the referee is using a calculating machine, however, he may prefer to\nfind the sum of the squares of deviations from the mean by summing the\nsquares of the figures themselves and subtracting from them the square of\ntheir mean multiplied by their number. This is frequently the actual operation\ncarried out by W. W. C. This, however, is merely an alternative way of\ngetting the sum of squares of deviations from the mean and involves no\ndifference in principle from the above operation. In the present case, this\nwould give us 262 - (7 x 36) = 10, which is, of course, the same result as above.\n\f150] Review of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 239\nless than their total number of 7) is 1-66. This then is a measure\nof the scatter of the averages of different owners. It would be zero\nif all of these averages were the same ;\nthe more they differ amongst\nthemselves, the bigger it becomes.\nThis quantity (when calculated from a distribution of figures for\nwhich it is an appropriate measure of scatter) is called the variance.\nVery commonly, the square root of this quantity is calculated and\nis called the standard deviation (or a). All that need be remembered\nis that the variance, the standard deviation, or any other measure\nof scatter, is simply a measure of how much a set of quantities\ndiffer amongst themselves.\nThe referee now knows the actual scatter of the average scores\nof the different poultry-keepers. He must now compare this actual\nscatter with the amount of scatter of the averages which would have\nresulted from the individual differences between the hens. That is,\nhe must know how much the averages for different owners would\nhave differed between themselves even if there had been no real\ndifference between the laying power of hens of different owners.\nIf, and only if, the observed variance of the averages (1-66) is\nsufficiently greater than this, he will be able to give an affirmative\nanswer to the question of whether there is a real difference between\nthe laying power of the hens of different owners.\nHe begins by measuring, in the same way, the scatter between\nthe scores of the five hens from any one poultry yard. He does\nthis separately for each separate jDOultry yard and takes an average\nof the seven variances he has obtained. Thus for Brown, the\ndeviations of the hens from the average (7) for this yard are : -tl,\n-fl, -tl, -1, -2. The snm of the squares of these deviations is\nl-fl-f-l-l-l-t4 = 8, which divided by 4 (one less than the number\nof hens in the yard) is 2, which is therefore written in the last column\nof table under the heading Z dev.^\/4 (in which Z is the sign for\nsummation). The variance for each of the other yards is written\nbelow this in the same column. This column is then added up and\ndivided by 7 and is found to give an average of 3-64. ^ Let us call\n^ The referee might also have got this quantity by a different inethod. If\nhe had added together the squares of all the scores for the 35 sejaarate hens,\nhe would have got 1,412. By subtracting the square of the general average\n(6) multiplied by the total number of 'hens in the experiment, he would have\ngot (1412 - 36 X 35) = 152. By further subtracting the sum of squares obtained\nearlier (from the averages of scores of different owners) multiplied by the\nnumber of hens in the experiment belonging to each owner, he gets\n(152 -(10x5) )\n= 102 which divided by 28 (i.e. by 7x(5-l) )\ngives 3-64 as\nabove.\nThat this must give the same result as the simpler procedure above may be\nshown by simple algebra. It may seem a laborious and roundabout way of\n\f240 Robert H. Thouless [part\nthis quantity the \u201c mean variance within poultry yards \u201d in order\nto distinguish it from the measure of scatter obtained earlier which\nwas the variance of the average scores of the different owners (the\nvariance between the averages for poultry yards).\nThe simple proposition that the referee uses is that if there were\nno real difference between the owners, then the mean variance\nwithin poultry yards would be about equal to the variance of the\naverage scores of the different owners multiplied by the number\nof hens for each owner from which this average score has been\ncalculated (in this case, five). The variance of the average scores\nof the different owners is, as we have seen above, T66. The quantity\nrequired will, therefore, be T66x5 = 8-33. We may call this the\n\u201c total variance between poultry yards \u201d or simply the \u201c variance\nbetween poultry yards \u201d. If these two quantities (the mean variance\nwithin poultry yards and the variance between poultry yards) were\nequal or nearly equal, we could conclude that the hens of different\nowners differed no more in their power of laying eggs than they\nwould if all had been drawn at random from the same poultry yard.\nTable II\nDegrees of\nfreedom\nSum of\nsquares\nMean square\n(i.e.\nvariance)\nI loge V\nBetween poultry yards 6 5x10 = 50 8-33 1-060\nWithin poultry yards 7 X 4 = 28 102 3-64 0-646\nTotal 34 152 4-47 s= -hO-414\nIf, however, we turn to the figures that we have actually obtained\n(see Table II), we find that this is by no means the case. The variance\nwithin poultry yards was only 3-64 while that between poultry\nyards was 8-33. Thus the scatter of the mean scores of different\nowners is more than twice as great as we should expect it to be if\nit were caused only by the differences between different hens. Can\nthe referee then return an affirmative answer to the question as to\nwhether there is any real difference between the success of different\npoultry-keepers ?\ngetting the result, but this is only because we are working with an artificially\nsimplified set of figures which can be easily worked out in our heads. With\nthe kind of data generally found in jmactice, and if results are obtained by\nthe use of a calculating machine, the second method is the easier and was,\nin fact, used by W. W. C.\n\f150]\nReview of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 241\nUnfortunately, not yet. There is a further possibility that he\nmust take into consideration. We said earlier that if there were no\nreal difference between the sldll of the jjoultry-keepers the variances\nbetween and within poultry yards would be equal or nearly equal.\nCertainly they are not equal, but are they sufficiently nearly equal\nfor it to be reasonable to attribute to chance the higher variances\nbetween poultry yards ? This is the next question the referee must\nask himself.\nIn order to answer it, he must calculate a quantity z which is\nhalf the difference between the Naperian logarithms of the two\nvariances. The required quantities are given in the last column of\nTable II under the heading \u201c logg V \u201d, and the required value of\nz is seen to be (1-060- -646) = -414.\nThe referee may or may not understand the reason for taking\nthis step. All that is necessary is that he should carry it out correctly\nand understand the use of the figure he has obtained at the end.\nHis reason for calculating z is not (as perhaps some of the competitors\nimagine) that he wants to go through a mathematical ritual which\nwill make his results incomprehensible to a layman. It is because he\nknows the danger that an apparent indication of the truth of the\nhypothesis that he is testing (that there is a real difference between\nthe success of different poultry-keepers) might occur as an effect\nof chance, and, like all others who have to make practical use of\nstatistics in research work, he has at his elbow a copy of Fisher\u2019s\nStatistical Methods for Research. Workers. His intention is to turn\nup the appropriate table in Fisher\u2019s book in order to discover what\nis the likelihood that a value of z as large as or larger than the one\nobserved might have been produced by chance if there had been\nno real difference between the poultry-keepers. When he looks up\nFisher\u2019s Table VI, he finds that there is a -05 probability that a z\nof -447 might have been produced by chance in these figures. Since\nthe observed value is rather less than this, and a probability of -05\nis the minimum criterion of significance the only reply the referee\ncan give is :\n\u201c I do not know whether there is any real difference\nbetween your skill as poultry-keepers.

Thouless [part\nl^reecls, and that, to allow for the possibility that some breeds might\nbe better layers than others, it was arranged that hen 1 of each\npoultry-keeper was, let us say, a Plymouth Kock ;\nNo. 2 a Brown\nLeghorn ;\nand so on.\nThe referee must, in this case, perform the additional operation\nof estimating the amount of scatter due to difference of breed.\nHe adds therefore, under Table I, the total number of eggs laid by\nhens of each breeds, and then works out the average for each breed.\nThe new lines are as follows :\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nTotals for each breed - 37 50 44 43 36\nAverages for each breed - 5-29 7-14 6-29 6-14 5-14\nHe then works out the sum of the squares of the deviations of\nthese means from their general average (of 6) exactly as he did for\ndetermining the variance between the averages of poultry yards.\nThe sum of squares is, therefore :\n(\n- -71)2 +(M4)2 + (-29)2 +(-14)2 +( - -86)2\nwhich equals 2-65.^ The number of degrees of freedom is four (one\nless than the number of different breeds), so the variance of the\naverages is 2-65\/4. This must be multiplied by 7 (since each average\nhas been calculated from the score of 7 owners), giving\n(7 x2-65)\/4= 18-55\/4 = 4-64\nfor the total variance between breeds. The referee can now write\ndown a new table of analysis of variance (Table HI) showing in the\nfirst line the variance between poultry yards, in the second that\nbetween lireeds, and in the third the variance from all remaining\nsources. This third line is obtained by subtracting the sum of\nsquares between breeds from that obtained earlier within poultry\nyards (Table II) and similarly subtracting the nizmber of degrees\nof freedom.\nThe z is then obtained as before by subtracting log^ of the residual\nvariance (in the third line) from log^ of the variance between poultry\nyards. The reason for going through this additional process is that\nany difference between the laying power of different breeds will\nnot affect the scatter between poultry yards (since its effect has\nbeen eliminated by taking one hen of each breed from each poultry\nyard). It will, however, increase the scatter within poultry yards,\n^ Alternatively, if we arc u.sing a calculating machine we may prefer to\nadd (5-29)^ -f (7-14)^, etc., and subtract (5x6-) at the end, or to add the\nsquares of the totals, (37)\u201c -f (50)^, etc., subtract (5x30\u201c), and divide by 49.\nBoth of these processes will give the same answer as before, i.e. 2-65.\n\f150]\nReview of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 243\nTable III\nDegrees\nof\nfreedom\nSum\nof\nsquares\nMean square\n(i.e.\nvariance)\n4 log\u00ab V\nBetween poultry yards 6 50 8-33 1-060\nBetween breeds 4 18-55 4-64\nKesidual variance (or error\nvariance) - . - 24 83-45 3-48 0-6235\nTotal - - - 34 152 4-47 2 = 0-4365\nand will, therefore, unless its effect is eliminated, lead us to over-\nestimate how much scatter between poultry yards might be due\nto chance causes. This might have led the referee, if he had ignored\nthis factor, to have missed a real difference between the different\npoultry yards. He is now comparing the scatter between poultry\nyards with what is, in effect, the scatter within poidtry yards after\nthe effects of difference of breed have been removed.\nIn this particular case, it does not make much difference. It is\ntrue that the 2 is now somewhat larger (-4365 instead of -414), but\nsince the number of degrees of freedom in the residual variance\nis less than it was before, the size of z with a -05 probability of chance\noccurrence is also greater, and is now -460. The 2 obtained is,\ntherefore, still too small to come up to the minimum criterion of\nsignificance and the referee can still only give the same answer as\nbefore\u2014that he thinks there is a real difference between the poultry\nyards but cannot be sure without a more extended investigation.\nThe reason why there is no appreciable increase in the significance\nof 2 in Table III is simply that, in constructing this example, I pur-\nposely made the difference between the breeds negligibly small\n(in order to keep it closely parallel to W. W. C.\u2019s data). If the\ndifference between breeds had been large, the significance of the 2\nobtained for the difference between poultry yards would have been\nmuch increased. Although he gets no positive advantage by\ncarrying out the more comphcated process of Table III, the referee\nwas midoubtedly right to do this, since he knows that there is a\npossible cause of scatter in his \u201c within yards \u201d variance that is\nnot present in his \u201c between yards \u201d variance, and he cannot know\nhow much it is affecting his results except by going through the\ncalculations necessary for its elirni nation.\nLet us now tmn from poultry yards to trance personahties. In\n\f244 Robert H. Thouless [part\nW. W. C.\u2019s data, the different words of the word-association test\ncorrespond to the different poultry yards, and the figures on which\nthe analysis is carried out are not the number of eggs laid by a\nparticular hen, but the difference between the response of the two\npersonalities compared. The different occasions on which the test\nis administered correspond to the different breeds in our example.\nTo show the parallelism between the two cases, we can make a\ntable like Table I, showing W. W. C.\u2019s data. Let us call the two\npersonalities compared A and B, and the successive words of the\nwords-association test, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Then can stand for, let\nus say, A\u2019s reaction time to word 1, for B\u2019s reaction time to word 1,\nA2\nfor A\u2019s reaction time to word 2 and so on. The table for working\nout W. W. C.\u2019s z for the measurement of what he calls \u201c Difference\n\u201d\nis as follows :\nOccasions I\nWords\nII III IV V VI\n1 (Ai-Bd (Ai -Bd (Ai-Bd (Ai-Bd (Ai-BJ (Ai-Bd\n2 (A,-B2) (A2 -Bd (A2-B2) (A2 \u2014 B2) (A2-B2) (A3-B2)\n3 (A3-B3) (A3 -B3) (A3-B3) and so on.\nEach of these entries is of course a number\u2014the difference\nbetween the reaction time of A and the reaction time of B to that\nword on that occasion. The scatter between the averages of the\nrows is obtained exactly as in our example, and all the remaining\nsteps are carried out as in the example, the effect of difference of\noccasion being eliminated in the same way as in the example we\neliminated the effect of the difference of breed. If a significant\nvalue of z is obtained at the end, this proves that there is a real\ntendency for the rows to differ. Now each row is a series of differences\nbetween the personality A and the personality B for a particular\nword. If A and B did not tend to react differently to different\nwords all the (A-B)\u2019s would be about the same and z would be\nabout zero. It would also be about zero if A and B did react differ-\nently to different words, but did not show any consistency in their\ndifferences on different days, if, for example, A reacted much more\nstrongly than B to word 1 on the first occasion but much less strongly\nthan B to the same word on the second occasion, and so on. Thus\nboth difference between the reactions of A and B and consistency\nbetween these differences are necessary for a significant value of z,\nand this measure would be more correctly described as one of\n\u201c consistency of difference \u201d than simply as one of \u201c difference\nI shall use for this measure W. W. C.\u2019s letter \u201c D \u201d, but we may\nbear in mind that D stands for \u201c consistency of difference \u201d and not\nmerely for \u201c difference\n\f160] Review of Carington'\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 245\nThere is another measure obtained by the analysis of variance of\nwhich little use is made, and which, I tlinik, offers no special diffi-\nculty to understanding. This is covariance which (as used by\nW. W. C.) means the extent to which the different occasions of\ntesting produce an effect of the same kind on the responses of the\npersonalities compared. The existence of positive covariance\nwould seem to indicate the same kind of thing as the \u201c similarity\n\u201d\nmeasurements, i.e. a relationship of resemblance between the two\npersonalities. On the other hand, absence of covariance may\nindicate nothing except that neither personality shows variation\nof response depending on occasion. \u201c Covariance \u201d was rarely\nfound, so it is of httle importance for our present purpose.\nVI. Tests of Significakce\nWe cannot infer the existence of either \u201c similarity \u201d or \u201c differ-\nence \u201d merely from the fact that we obtain a positive value of z in\nthe S and D measurements respectively ;\nit is also necessary to\nshow that the z which has been obtained is larger than might have\narisen by chance from figures which do not really indicate the\nrelationship) in question. The usual minimum criterion for regarding\nz as significant is that it shall be larger than a value which might\nhave arisen by chance once in 20 times. This may be expressed\nby saying that P (the probability that in a collection of figures not\nshowing the relation in question, the observed value of z might\nhave arisen by chance) is less than -05. This is a minimum criterion\nof significance. We shall feel more confidence in the result of any\nobservation if it satisfies a more severe criterion than this ;\nwe may\nprefer, for example, that P should be less than -01.\nW. W. C. generally makes the appropriate tests for the significance\nof his results and attaches to each of the measurements of S and D\nin his tables, the corresponding value of P. It is unfortunate that\nthe P generally printed by him is not the quantity generally meant\nby this letter but one half of it, i.e. it is the likelihood of a quantity\nof at least the observed value and of the observed sign arising by the\nchances of samphng from a population randomly distributed about\nzero. This is erroneous (as W. W. C. now agrees), since \u201c similarity\n\u201d\nmeasurements might vary significantly in either direction, that is,\neither a 4- ve or a -ve value might be significant of a real relationship).\nSince the requirement that P should not be greater than -05 is the\nminimum requirement for significance, it is necessary to remember\nthat this division has taken place, since otherwise in the \u201c simi-\nlarity \u201d measurements, we shall be accepting as evidence of\nrelationship, amounts which might have arisen by chance once in\n\f246 Robert H. Thoidess [part\nten times (instead of once in twenty times). This division by two\nwoidd, however, only have serious consequences when we were\nusing the minimum criterion of significance (of P<-05).\nIn the case of \u201c difference \u201d measurements, on the other hand,\nno meaning is to be attached to negative z\u2019s. These could only arise\nas random deviates, so in estimating the significance of a positive\nD, we shoidd be quite justified in asking what was the likelihood\nof a value of that sign, and, therefore in dividing by two the value\nof P found in a table of normal deviates. Unfortunately, when\nW. W. C. divides P by two for one set of measurements and not for\nthe other, it is for the \u201c similarity \u201d measurements that he divides\nby two while the \u201c difference \u201d measurements remain undivided.\nThe method by which W. W. C. estimates this quantity P is by\ncalculating the standard errors of his S and D measurements (by\nformulae given in TP 1, pp. 215 and 219 respectively), divkbng\nthe z by the standard error so obtained, and looking up the P for\nthe value so obtained in a table of normal deviates. If this ratio\ni.e. (measurement)\/(standard error), is 2 or over, in any normally\ndistributed quantity, the value of P is less than -05, so the z can be\ntaken to be significant. Thus in the comparison between Mrs\nLeonard (normal) and Feda in TP 2 (Table II, RN 72), the z\u2019s for\nS and I) are - -0400 and +-2073. Ry using the formulae as given\nby W. W. C., we find that the standard errors of these are -116 and\n\u2022092 respectively. The ratios we want are, therefore, -OdOO\/'llG^ -345\nfor the S measurement and \u20222073\/-092 = 2-25 for the D measurement.\nNow turning iqr a table of normal deviates we find that for a ratio\nof -345, P=: -73, and for a ratio of 2-25, P is -025. The \u201c difference\n\u201d\nmeasurement for these personalities is, therefore, significant since\nit woukl only occur once in forty times by chance if there were no\nreal \u201c difference \u201d, whereas the \u201c similarity \u201d measurement is of\na magnitude which woidd be more likely than not to occur by\nchance if the real value of z were zero, so we cannot infer from it\nthat there is any real similarity between Feda and Mrs Leonard.\nThe values of P given by W. W. C. are, of course, half those given\nabove, i.e. -37 and <-015.\nThere are few other points deserving notice in connection with\nthe use of P as a criterion of significance, since they arise in various\nparts of W. W. C.\u2019s work. First, although it is true that from such\na value of z as the S measurement for Feda and Mrs Leonard given\nabove, in which P is -73, we cannot conclude that there is any\nsimilarity (either positive of negative) between the two personalities\ncompared, it does not follow that no conclusion whatever can be\ndrawn from this figure. Since the standard error is -116, we can\n\f150] Review of Garington\u2019\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 247\nconclude that the true value of z for similarity lies somewhere be-\ntween the observed value plus twice the standard error and the\nobserved value minus twice the standard error. The value obtained,\ntherefore, for z is definitely inconsistent with the true value of z\nbeing a positive value greater than about -19 or a negative value\nbeyond about - -27. It frequently happens that what we want to\nknow is not merely whether an observed value is or is not consistent\nwith the hypothesis that the true value is zero, but also within\nwhat range the true value is likely to lie. For this reason, I think\nthe standard error is more informative to the reader than is the\nvalue of P, and that W. W. C.\u2019s tables would be clearer if standard\nerrors were included.\nSecondly, although we cannot conclude from the single S measure-\nment from Feda and Mrs Leonard discussed above that there is\nbetween them any relation of similarity, either positive or negative,\nwe might be able to draw such a conclusion for a series of such\nmeasurements even though in all of them the z was too small for\nsignificance. Let us suppose, for example, that this was one of a\nseries of ten measurements of similarity of the same two personali-\nties, all negative, all too small for significance, and all independent\nof one another (i.e. none are in any degree causally connected with\nany of the others). We could then obviously consider that if the\nvalues were randomly distributed about zero, the probability of all\nten being of the same sign by chance would be 2 x which is\n\u2022002, an amount which is undoubtedly significant. So long, therefore,\nas proper care is taken, perfectly valid conclusions can be drawn from\ncombinations of data themselves separately not significant.\nThirdly, we have sometimes to decide what is the significance\nof a figure which is itself significant if considered separately but\nwhich is actually the best one of a number of observations of the\nsame kind. Let us suppose, for example, that we had ten measure-\nments of \u201c similarity \u201d for a single pair of personahties and that\nthe best of these gave a P of -01. If it were legitimate to treat\nthis separately, we should say that the odds against it occurring\nby chance if there were no real similarity would be 100 to 1. This\nwould be to ignore, however, the actual conditions of the observa-\ntion. The probability of such a value occurring at least once in\nten trials is not -01 but -095.1 The odds against this occurring by\n^ Because if -01 is the likelihood of the value turning up by chance in one\ntrial, the likelihood of it not turning uj) by chance in one trial is -99, and the\nIdielihood of it tm-ning up at least once in ten trials is, therefore, 1 - (\u202299)^\u201c>(.=\n095. Generally, if P is the probability for single value, the likelihood of a\nvalue equal to this or greater turning up at least once in n trials is 1 - ( 1 - P)\u201d,\nwhich is approximately wP, if P is small.\n\f248 Robert H. Thouless [pakt\nchance are, therefore, only about 10 to 1, which is not enough for\nsignificance.\nBefore leaving the discussion of significance, it is perhaps worth\nwhile to consider what was wrong with W. W. C.\u2019s now discarded\nattempt in TP 3 to combine independent estimates of significance\nby a method which resulted in a fantastic overestimate of sig-\nnificance.\nThe beginnings of this mistake are to be found much earlier than\nTP 3. In para. 26, in TP 1, W. W. C. considers two observations\nwhich have P\u2019s of -005 and -01 respectively. He wants to discover\nthe value of P for the two observations taken together, i.e. to\nestimate how strong is the evidence of the combined fact of both\nobservations for the hypothesis under consideration. There is a\nrecognised and legitimate method of doing this (the negative\nlogarithm method used later by W. W. C. in TP 3). If we could\ntreat the two observations in question as independent, and if we\ncould ignore the fact that they are the selected best from a number\nof observed values, then the negative logarithm method would tell\nus that the likehhood of two values at least as great as these arising\nby the chances of samphng from a population randomly distributed\nabout zero is -0005(;t;^= 19-9 with four degrees of freedom).\nW. W. C., however, starts the argument by stating the meaning\nof P erroneously, and it is, I think, in this misstatement that the\norigin of the mistake lies. He says :\n\u201c The chances of these being\naccidental were about 1 in 200 and 1 in 100 respectively.\u201d He then\nworks out that the combined chance is about 1 in 19,000. There\nseems to be nothing wrong with this argument except the premiss.\nIf the two P\u2019s were the probabilities that the two values were\naccidental, then the probability of both being accidental would be\ntheir product (about 1 in 20,000). The combined P would thus be\n\u202200005 which is only one tenth of the value obtained by the proper\nmethod. Since a smaller P indicates a more certain result, this\nmistake in method leads to an overestimation of significance, which\nin other cases is greater and more serious than it is here.\nW. W. C. also sometimes states the meaning of P correctly. In\nTP 1, p. 214, for example, he says that P \u201c represents the chance\nof getting a z of this magnitude by accident \u201d. This is quite correct,\nbut it is a very different thing from saying that P is the probabihty\nthat the z in question has been produced by accident (which is what\nhe says in the passage quoted earlier) a misstatement which produces\nits most spectacular effects at the end of TP 3. I do not suppose\nthat W. W. C. is the first to be guilty of the misstatement ;\nit could\nprobably be paralleled in many accounts of statistical methods.\n\f160] Review of Carington^s WorTc on Trance Personalities 249\nIt is his misfortune that he has been clear-sighted enough to drive\nthe misstatement to its logical conclusion and to derive from it a\nmethod of combining P\u2019s from different observations which would\nbe a correct one if P were the likehhood of a given z having been\nproduced by chance.\nWhen we say that a particular value of z is significant because P\nis -02, we mean that if the real value of z {i.e. the mean we should\nget if we could take an infinite sample of such z\u2019s) were zero, then\nthe odds would be 60 to 1 against a value as large as the one ob-\nserved having arisen by chance. This gives us a reasonable convic-\ntion that the observed z did not arise in this way. Let us be clear\nthat this is not the same thing as saying that the odds are 50 to 1\nagainst the observed z having arisen by chance.\nWe may suppose that I am waiting on the outskirts of Cambridge\nfor a walker whom I have never seen before but who I know has\nslept the previous night at St. Ives (12 miles away). At 10 a.m.\nI see someone approaching along the road with a rucksack on his\nback. Taking into consideration the distance from St. Ives and\nthe probable time of starting, I do not, however, bother to ask\nthe man whether he is the one I am waiting for since I consider\nthat if he had started from St. Ives that morning the odds would\nbe (let us say) 100 to 1 against my expected friend having yet got\nso far. At 11.30, I see another man approaching on foot. It still\nseems rather unhkely that my friend would have got so far in such\na short time, but now I estimate that the odds are only 3 to 1\nagainst him having got so far {i.e. P = -25) so it seems reasonable\nto consider that it is sufficiently likely that the man is the one I am\nwaiting for, for it to be worth while to ask him.\nThe above P is exactly analogous to the P calculated in an estimate\nof significance. Here it is the probability that if my friend had\nstarted from St. Ives that morning he could have got at least as\nfar as this point by this time. In testing significance, P is the\nprobability that if the true value of the qi:antity observed were\nzero, a deviation at least as big as the observed value might have\noccurred by the chances of sampling. The only essential difference\nbetween the two situations is that in testing significance we are\ngenerally interested in trying to establish not that the observed\nwalker might have come from St. Ives but that there is no reasonable\nlikelihood that he did.\nThe erroneous use of P which I am here criticising would be\nparalleled in our illustration by supposing that the judgment that\nthere is a probability of -25 that if my friend had started from St.\nIves this morning he would have got as far as this, was equivalent\n\f250 Robert H. Thouless [part\nto the quite different judgment that there is a prol:>ability of -26\nthat tlie observed walker is my expected friend. Clearly this is a\ndifferent judgment and any opinion on this j^robability would have\nto be founded on quite different data. The observed walker might\nhave come from Huntingdon, from Godmanchester, from Fen\nStanton or from some intermediate village. Other things being\nequal it is clearly more likely that any particular walker came from\nsome less distant village than that he came from St. Ives. In fact\nwe could not even form an estimate of the likelihood that it was\nfrom St. Ives that he came without knowing a great deal more\nabout populations, relative distances, etc. We can only be sure\nthat it is likely to be a figure very different from the -25 calculated\nas the probability that, starting from St. Ives, he would have got\nat least as far as this.\nWe may take an even simpler illustration. A man is arrested\nand charged with murder. He pleads \u201c not guilty \u201d. The judge\nmay consider that if he were guilty the odds woidd be 50 to 1 that\nhe would say he was not guilty. This is plainly not the same as\nsupposing that the fact that he pleads \u201c not guilty \u201d shows that the\nodds are 50 to 1 that he is really guilty.\nI have dealt with this mistake at some length because it is an\ninsidious one, and because, if this line of reasoning were admitted,\nall kinds of erroneous conclusions could be drawn from these papers\nand from most other statistical studies. I certainly tlo not wish\nit to be imagined that this criticism undermines the whole of\nW. W. C.\u2019s work. It means simply that the arguments of TP 1,\npara. 20, of TP 2, p. 355, and of TP 3, paras. 32 and 33 must be\nrejectetl. None of these is of great importance, and the discarding\nof them leaves the remainder of the three pajjers intact.\nVII. The Measurement of Individuality or\nSelf-Consistency\nWe have already seen (in Section V) that W. W. C.\u2019s measure\nof I) is not sinqjly a measure of \u201c difference \u201d but of \u201c consistency\nof difference \u201d. Although the way in which consistency affects the\nS measurement is less obvious, I think it is equally true to say that\nthis too is not sinqily a measure of \u201c similarity \u201d but to some extent\nalso of \u201c consistency of similarity \u201d. Let us remind ourselves of\nwhat S is. It is a measure of the degree to which the average\nresponses to different words of two subjects were correlated {i.e. if\none subject showed to a particular word a response which was large\ncompared with his own average, the other subject also tended to\n\f150] Review of Carington's Work on Trance Personalities 251\nshow to the same word a large response compared with his average).\nI think it shoidd be clear that if any personality was inconsistent\non different occasions, showing a large response to one word on one\noccasion, but to quite different words on other occasions, there could\nbe little that was characteristic of him either in his responses on\nany one occasion or in the average, which will simply be a blurred\nresultant of many different patterns of response. Nor can we\nreasonably expect either any single set of resjwnses or the average\nof them to show close correlation with the pattern of response of\nany other personahty. This, I think, becomes obvious if we reflect\nthat if a second personality showed close \u201c similarity \u201d to any one\nset of the inconsistent personalities responses, he could not also to\nothers. We cannot, in fact, expect to And that a personality is\nmore \u201c similar \u201d to another personality than he is to himself.\nThis tendency of low self-consistency to produce low correlations\nis well known to educational psychologists who use the word\n\u201c attenuation \u201d to describe this effect.\nWe have the situation then that a low D measurement may mean\nsmall difference between the personalities compared or it may mean\nlow self-consistency in one or both ;\nsimilarly a low S measurement\nmay mean httle similarity or it may mean low self-consistency.\nActually, we are interested only in similarity and difference, and\nfrom the point of view of this enquiry, lack of self-consistency is\nsimply a factor whose importance for us lies in the fact that it may\nobscure real relationships of similarity and difference.\nWe cannot interpret low S and D measurements, then, unless\nwe have some way of determining the degree of self-consistency\nof the personalities compared. This is given to us in the measure-\nment called \u201c individuality \u201d or \u201c I \u201d by W. W. C. I should have\npreferred that this should have been called (as W. W. C. also suggests)\n\u201c self-consistency \u201d.\nThis is a quantity obtained in the same way as the \u201c difference\n\u201d\nmeasurement from a table in which the items are simply the re-\nsponses of one personality to the different words on different occa-\nsions. It may seem paradoxical that the method which was pre-\nviously used to measure a difference between personalities is here\nused to measure the resemblance of a personality to himself. This,\nhowever, is an obvious consequence of the nature of the numerical\nitems in the two cases. What was measured in the previous case\nwas the extent to which the difference between the responses of\ntwo personalities on different occasions was consistently greater\nfor some words and less for others ;\nwhat is measured in this case\nis the extent to which the responses of one personahty on different\n\f252 Robert H. Thouless [part\noccasions are consistently greater for some words than for others.\nWe said that the \u201c D \u201d measurement indicated the \u201c consistency\nof difference \u201d between two personalities ;\nin the same way, we\nmay say that the \u201cI\u201d measurement indicates the \u201c consistency of\nindividuality \u201d of one personality. It measures how far this indi-\nvidual (to quote W. W. C.) \u201c always gives a longer time to goat,\nsay, tlian to pig, and to pig than to cat, during the period covered\nby the tests \u201d.\nIt will be seen from what has been said earlier that it is of some\npractical importance to have a measure of self consistency and I\nthink that much more practical use might be made of it than W. W. C.\nhas made. Let us supjiose, for example, that we turn to the tables\nat the end of TP 2 in which a series of \u201c S \u201d and \u201c D \u201d measurements\nis given for different pairs of personalities in three experiments.\nIf we ask ourselves which personalities resemble each other and\nwhich differ from each other, we shall be bewildered. The same pair\nof personalities seem to be differently related in different applications\nof the test, and many seem to have the meaningless relationship\nof being neither similar nor different.\nIt is only when we begin to take into account the \u201c I \u201d measure-\nments that order begins to appear in the chaos. We can take, for\nexample, the comparisons between Mrs Garrett and Uvani (reaction\ntimes) in Table I. For three of these (RN 30, 32 and 34),\n\u201c I\n\u201d\nmeasurements are given (RN 9 and 12, 10 and 13 and 11 and 14\nrespectively). The \u201c similarity \u201d measurements present no diffi-\nculty. All three are insignificantly small, so we may conclude that\nthe test shows no appreciable resemblance between the two person-\nalities. The \u201c D \u201d measurements are more difficult. The first is\n\u202231 (fairly large and easily significant) the second is -05 (insignifi-\ncantly small) and the third is -48 (even larger than the first). Are\nwe to conclude that the two personahties do or do not differ? We\nshall jirobably all guess that they really do differ, but this is not a\nvery satisfactory conclusion unless we have some ground for re-\njecting the middle value other than the fact that it does not agree\nwith the other two. When we examine the \u201c I \u201d measurements\nfor Mrs Garrett and Uvani we find that they are satisfactorily large\nfor the first and third comparison (G = -25 and U= -30 for the first,\nand G = -55, U= -48 for the third). For the second comparisons,\nhowever, I is small for Mrs Garrett (-15) and practically zero for\nUvani ( - -07).\nWe may make a more general examination of how far this appear-\nance of personalities being neither \u201c similar \u201d nor \u201c different \u201d is\na result of low self-consistencies in the personahties compared. I\n\f150]\nReview of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 253\nhave divided the \u201c S \u201d and \u201c D \u201d measurements in Table II (TP2)\ninto two classes ;\nthose in which both of the personalities compared\nhave \u201c I \u201d measurements of -2 or over, and those in which one or\nboth \u201c I \u201d measurements fall below that value. The first class is\nthus composed of personalities with good self-consistency, the other\nhas one or both personalities with bad self-consistency. The com-\nparisons in both classes are then grouped as showing significant\nsimilarity and no difference (S -t-Do), significant difference and no\nsimilarity (SoD-f), and so on. The results for the whole of\nAV. AA\". C.\u2019s Table II are as follows :\n^\nTable IV\n(1)\nS+Do\n(2)\nSoD + or\nS-D +\n(3)\nSo Do\n(4)\nS+D +\nTotals\nComparisons between\npersonalities with\n\u201c good \u201d self-consis-\ntency - - - 3 17 0 4 24\nOther comparisons 11 9 13 1 34\nThere are two striking features of this table. First, the much\ngreater proportion of comparisons showing significant difference\nin those calculated from personalities with good self-consistency\n(21 out of 24 as against 10 out of 34), suggesting that a principal\neffect of lack of self-consistency is to obscure differences that really\nexist. Secondly, there is a complete disappearance in the compari-\nsons with good \u201c self-consistency \u201d of the anomalous indication\nthat two personalities are neither \u201c similar \u201d nor \u201c different \u201d.\nThis confirms the opinion previously suggested that these cases\ndo not indicate a relationship of \u201c neutrality \u201d between the person-\nahties who neither resemble each other nor differ from each other,\nbut simply that lack of self-consistency prevents us from measuring\nany real similarity that exists. Our \u201c S \u201d and \u201c D \u201d measurements\nare quite correct in their indications that the two personalities show\nneither \u201c consistent similarity \u201d nor \u201c consistent difference \u201d, and\nonly become misleading if we equate these with \u201c similarity \u201d and\n\u201c difference \u201d.\nThere may, at first sight, appear to be inconsistency in the indi-\ncations of column 4 where the same personalities appear to be both\n1 When this table was made, I did not realise that all W. W. C.\u2019s P\u2019s had been\ndivided by 2, so I took as my criterion of significance that P (W. W. C.\u2019s\nvalue) should be -05 or over.\n\f254 Robert H. Thouless [part\nsimilar and different. This, however, is altogether reasonable. If\ntwo personalities are not completely similar, they will be more or\nless different. So it is to be expected that a measure of similarity\ntogether with a measure of difference will be found in all comparisons,\nwith a tendency for the difference to be greater if the similarity is\nless and vice versa. It may generally happen that only \u201c S \u201d or\nonly \u201c D \u201d will be significant, but there is no reason why both\nshould not be.\nIt would be interesting also to enquire whether, if only data of\ngood self-consistency were used, inconsistency of indications between\ndifferent experiments would be reduced or disappear. This probably\nwould hapj)en, but there are not enough comparisons of the same\npair of personalities who have both been self-consistent in more\nthan one experiment for a test to be possible.\nThe suggestion I wish to make here, is that if we require \u201c S\n\u201d\nand \u201c D \u201d measurements as indications of the relationships of simi-\nlarity and difference between j^ersonalities, they should be calculated\nfrom test results which show a reasonably high self-consistency or\n\u201c I \u201d measurement, because only then will \u201c S \u201d and \u201c D \u201d indicate\nadequately similarity and difference respectively. I think the \u201c I\n\u201d\nmeasurements might also l:)e used to determine the satisfactoriness\nof different methods of scoring. Many of the results given in TP 1\nbecome very differeiit when rescored for TP 2. I have no doubt\nthat the later methods of scoring were better and that the results\nindicated by them are more reliable than the earlier ones. I suggest,\nhowever, that this superiority might best be shown by finding that\nthe improved methods of scoring gave increased \u201c I \u201d scores when\nthey were used.\nWhat has here been said is not meant as a criticism of the work\nof W. W. C. It is, on the contrary, a suggestion that his results\nare much more informative and internally consistent than they\nappear at first sight. There is another way in which it might be\npossible to deal with the difficulties I have here discussed. I have\nexplored only the way in which the results could be improved by\neliminating those calculated from personalities showing low \u201c I\n\u201d\nmeasurements. Such a procedure would involve sacrificing a lot\nof the data. It would be better, if possible, to calculate indices of\n\u201c S \u201d and \u201c D \u201d which, in some way removed the effect of low\nself-consistency. This would be equivalent to the practice in educa-\ntional psychology of \u201c correcting for attenuation \u201d. Whether this\ncould be done and how it could be done, I must leave to the statis-\nticians. If it were practicable, it would plainly be better than\njettisoning all the data calculated from personalities with low \u201c I \u201d,\n\f150] Revieiv oj Caringlon's Work on Trance Perso7ialities 255\nbut until it can be done, I think the sacrifice of even two-thirds\nof the data would be worth while, if it left (as it would) much more\nclear indications in what remained.\nVIII. Countersimilarity of Controls\nA secondary object of Mr Whately Carington\u2019s research was to\nthrow light on the psychology of the trance condition. Outstand-\ningly the most important of these is his study of the relationship\nof the controls to the medium and to other personalities in the same\nmanifold.\nIn measuring a correlation, as in W. W. C.\u2019s measurements, we\nmay find a positive correlation indicating similarity of the two\nthings measured, no correlation at all indicating absence of similarity,\nor a negative correlation indicating a relationship which W. W. C.\ncalls \u201c countersimilarity \u201d. Similarity is the relationship between\ntwo faces resembhng each other in shape ; countersimilarity may\nbe expressed as the relationship between a human face and a hollow\ncast of a face. Countersimilarity {i.e. what is indicated by a sig-\nnificant negative z) is, as W. W. C. truly points out (TP 2, p. 333),\nno less evidence of some causal connection between the reactions\nof the two personalities compared than is a positive similarity.\nIn TP 2, pp. 329 ff., an argument is developed that controls show\nthe relationship of countersimilarity to other personalities in the\npsychological manifold to which they belong whereas communi-\ncators do not. From this fact is drawn the important conclusion\nthat controls are parts of the medium\u2019s personality split off by\nrepression and not autonomous personalities.\nLet us begin by making a general survey of the evidence on which\nthis conclusion is based. First, that of Feda the control of Mrs\nLeonard. There is no clear evidence of countersimilarity in the\nFeda \u201c similarity \u201d measurements published in TP 1 (pp. 200 ff.).\nThese results are recomputed for TP 2 by a better method and\nexanfination of the more extensive observations published in\nTable II of TP 2, suggests at once that there is a tendency for\nFeda to show negative z\u2019s for similarity in the reaction time\nresults although not in those for reproduction. It is, in fact,\nentirelj' from the reaction time results that AV. W. C.\u2019s argument\nis drawn.\nThe fact that Feda\u2019s countersimilarity does not appear in the\nmaterial published in TP 1 need not bother us. The recomputation\nfor TP 2 was by a better method (not, of course, devised to demon-\nstrate countersimilarity, but for other reasons) and it may easily\n\f256 Robert H. Thouless [PAKT\nhappen that a genuine relationship is obscured by an inferior method\nof scoringd\nNor need we worry about the fact that the relationship does not\nappear in \u201c reproduction \u201d results. If a relationship is significantly\nshown by any one set of results, then that relationship really exists\nand the mere fact that other sets of results do not show it is not, in\nitself, reason for supposing that it does not exist. Actually there\nare two possible reasons for the failure of the reproduction results\nto show the countersimilarity shown by the reaction time results.\nFirst, it may be, as W. W. C. suggests elsewhere (TP 2, p. 345),\nthat the RPN results are measuring something different, and,\nsecondly, it might be due to the general untrustworthiness of the\nindications of RPN data (see Section III of this paper).\nFurther examination of Feda\u2019s negative similarities (in Table II,\nTP 2) shows that, with one exception (RN 116) they are insigni-\nficantly small. Although this means that we cannot draw any con-\nclusion as to the reality of countersimilarity from any one of these\ninsignificant values taken separately, it does not necessarily mean that\nwe cannot do so by taking them together. As has already been\npointed out (in Section VI), a number of independent indications\nseparately insignificant may, as a whole, give a significant indication.\nLet us now turn to W. W. C.\u2019s arguments in TP 2. Sections 12\nto 17 are more or less preliminary. It is in sections 18 If. that the\nimportant part of the demonstration is to be found. I think that\nW. W. C. in his use of statistical analysis in these sections lays\nhimself open to charges of over-optimism and of insufficient use of\nstatistical methods as a critical check on this tendency. These also\nseem to me to be the main faults in his use of statistics where he\nwent wrong at the end of TP 3. I think it is unfortunate here that\na tendency to over-state his case may obscure the fact that there\nis quite a strong case anyway.\nW. W. C. begins by pointing out (TP 2, p. 334) that in the reaction\ntime \u201c similarities \u201d, Feda gives negative values proportionately\nmore often than do other personalities. This certainly is the case\nas is seen in the following table from this page :\nIt is, nevertheless, rather awkward that Feda and Mrs Leonard (prepared)\nshow a significant positive similarity on p. 201 of TP 1 (z= -t- -2740, P = -018)\nwhich becomes insignificant in Table II of TP 2 (z= -I-T471, P = -20). It is\nless easy to understand how an inferior method of computation can make a\nreally insignificant indication of relationship into a significant one.\nPositive\n- 2\n- 11\nNegative\nFeda comparisons\nOther comparisons\n8\n1\n\f150] Review of Carington's Work on Trance Personalities 257\nIt is obvious that in this table, the Feda comparisons show the\ngreater proportion of negative \u201c similarities As always, we must\nask whether this indication is significant, i.e. whether the dispro-\nportion is so great as to render it unreasonable to suppose that it\nmight be due to chance. W. W. C. does this by the standard method\nof the text-books for this type of problem (in which a quantity\ncalled is calculated) and shows that it is unquestionably significant.\nUndoubtedly it is, but we must also ask ; what exactly does it\nsignify? Plainly it does not signify what is here required for the\nargument\u2014that Feda has a real tendency to be countersimilar to\nother personalities. Negative values of z might arise in two ways,\neither from a real countersimilarity of Feda to other personalities,\nor by the fact that she had zero real similarity to other personalities\nso that negative values were as likely as positive. In fact, Feda\u2019s\nS \u2019\nvalues do tend to be much lower than the others so the mere\nfact that she gives more negative values is consistent with the second\nhypothesis and does not necessitate any real countersimilarity.\nIt may be objected, however, that this is proved by the fact that\nFeda gives more negative than positive values. This certainly is\nan argument in favour of countersimilarity, but it is a different\nargument. The important question is not whether she shows more\nnegative values than the other personalities but whether she shows\nmore than are to be expected on the hypothesis that her z values\nare normally distributed about zero. The table should be :\n+ ve - ve\nObserved Feda comparisons - - - - 2 8\nExpected Feda comparisons on hypothesis of\nzero similarity ------5 5\nThe inequahty is not significant but this may be because the total\nnumber of F comparisons is small. Let us, therefore, add together\nthe Feda and the Uvani comparisons and treat in the same way.\nATe get\n+ ve -ve\nObserved comparisons involving controls - 3 12\nExpected observed comparisons involving con-\ntrols on hypothesis of zero similarity - - 71\nfor significance (with Yates's correction for\nsmall numbers), we find that is 4-26 which makes P between -02\nand -05. This is sufficient for significance.\nThis would be valid evidence for a real tendency to counter-\nsimilarity if we were justified in treating all the comparisons as\nindependent. I do not think we are. If they are not independent.\n\f258 Robert H. Thouless [part\nthe significance of the results will be much less than the above\ncalculation would lead us to suppose. Since questions of what items\nof evidence can be regarded as independent occur several times in\nthese papers, it may be worth while to consider shortly the problem\nof what constitutes independent evidence.\nLet us suppose that we toss a penny fifteen times and that tails\nturn up twelve times, the above calculation would tell us how\nunlikely it is that this event would happen by chance. Suppose,\nhowever, that (still wishing to discover whether the coin is biassed)\nwe recorded as separate events the fact that the figure of Britannia\nwas uppermost, that the trident was uppermost and that the date\nwas uppermost. In five tosses we found that each of these three\nevents happened four times and failed to happen once. If we added\nthese together and said that our hypothesis of bias had been con-\nfirmed twelve times out of fifteen, we should be guilty of an obvious\nfallacy. Actually only five tests have been made (not fifteen) and the\nresults have been four of one kind and one of the other (a dispro-\nportion which is not significant since it could very easily have\nhappened by chance). The fallacy woizld be that of treating as\nindependent, items of evidence that are not independent.\nIn such a case as this, where the interdependence of the events\ntested is complete, no one is likely to make a mistake. There is\nanother more difficult case where the occurrence of one event only\nmakes more probable the occurrence of another and does not make\nit certain. We may suppose that we are tossing several mutilated\npennies some of which have a date but no trident, others have a\ntrident and no date, while others have both trident and date. Then\nthe turning up of the trident makes the turning up of a date more\nprobable but not certain, and vice versa. We still should be in error\nif we treated the turning up of the trident and of the date as inde-\npendent events, for the turning up of the trident a large number of\ntimes by chance would make more likely the turning up of the date.\nThe significance of any observed concurrence of these events would\nbe greatly exaggerated if we treated them as independent. If,\nmoreover, we were in the position of not knowing how many of our\ncoins were mutilated (and, therefore, how intimately these events\nwere causally connected) we should be unable to estimate how much\nthe significance of the results had been overestimated by treating\nthem as independent.\nIt seems to me that the different \u201c S \u201d comparisons of the same\npersonality in any one series of experiments are not independent\nfor much the same reason that the turning up of the trident and the\ndate in the last example are not independent. It must be remembered\n\f150]\nReview of Carington\u2019\u2019s Work on Traiice Personalities 259\nthat all of these \u201c S \u201d comparisons are made with the same set of\nFeda measurements. It may happen by chance that in any single\nexperiment, Feda produced a set of reaction times countersimilar\nto some other personality. This set will then, to some extent, tend\nto be countersimilar to any third personality positively similar to\nthe first one (just as a hollow cast countersimilar to W. W. C.\u2019s face\nwill also tend to be countersimilar to mine). All the -ve Feda com-\nparisons in the first Thomas experiment are truly independent pieces\nof evidence that this particular set of Feda measurements shows a\ntendency to \u201c countersimilarity \u201d but not that Feda measurements\nin general show countersimilarity. For that proposition they are,\ntaken together, one piece of evidence. Another piece of evidence\nis provided by the results of the second Thomas experiment and\nanother by the Irving experiment. In exactly the same way these\nthree experiments are three independent pieces of evidence that\nFeda shows countersimilarity but are only one piece of evidence\nfor the proposition that controls in general show countersimilarity.\nNor do I think that it is justifiable to treat (as W. W. C. does)\nreaction time results and reproduction results as independent. In\ngeneral these are correlated (as W. W. C. has himself shown) and,\ntherefore, a countersimilarity that appears in one will tend also to\nappear as a dependent fact in the other.\nI do not, of course, know how much our previous estimate of\nsignificance would be alfected by taking into account these inter-\ndependences of the Feda comparisons. There was not a very large\nmargin of significance to begin with, and, since we know that the\nsignificance must have been overestimated to an unknown extent,\nit seems safer to reject altogether the evidence for the counter-\nsimilarity of Feda and Uvani got by combining the values separately\ninsignificant, and to enquire whether we can get satisfactory evidence\nfrom values which are large enough to be significant.\nFor Feda, there is only one such value, the \u201c similarity \u201d of Feda\nand Leonard (prepared) in the Irving experiment (No. 116 of Table\nII, TP 2). Here z is - -3310, with a standard error of T, so the\nvalue of P is less than -001. This value of z is unquestionably\nsignificant. It is very improbable that it arose as a chance deviation\nfrom zero. It is true that this is only one of many z\u2019s calculated\nfor Feda and the chance of such a value arising at least once in\nseveral tests is larger than that of it occurring in a single trial.\nEven, however, if we multiply by 10 to get the chance of such a\nvalue occurring at least once in the ten reaction time comparisons\nof Feda, P would still be less than -01 and would remain significant.\nWe may note also that the fact that we have treated as independent\n\f260 Robert H, Thouless [PABT\ncomparisons which really are not independent, will, in this case,\ncause us to underestimate the significance, so P must be considerably\nless than -01 and undoubtedly significant.\nWe must now consider how this indication fits in with other\nindications in the same table. We may probably disregard the fact\nthat the reproduction test on the same material makes Feda and\nMrs Leonard (prepared) significantly similar. If, of course, two\napparently rehable lines of evidence were to tell us, one that Feda\nand Leonard (prepared) are similar and the other that they are\ncountersimilar, it would be impossible to draw any conclusion on\nthis point ;\nwe could only conclude that there was something wrong\nwith the evidence. We have, however, seen earlier that there may\nwell be sufficient reason for accepting the testimony of the \u201c reaction\ntime \u201d date without expecting that of the \u201c reproduction \u201d date to\nbe consistent with it.\nThis, however, leaves the same difficulty at a different point.\nThe RT similarity between Feda and Leonard (prepared) is insigni-\nficant in both Thomas experiments, insignificantly +ve in one\n( 2 = -f -1471), and insignificantly -ve in the other (2=:-T478).\nThis does not merely mean that these experiments do not confirm\nthe conclusion of the Irving experiment on this matter ;\nthey are\ndefinitely inconsistent with it. As has already been pointed out,\nthe fact that a value of z is insignificantly small does not mean only\nthat we cannot conclude that there is any relationship between the\nitems compared ;\nit also means that this relationship, if it exists,\ncannot exceed a certain positive value. The testimony of the two\nThomas experiments is that the countersimilarity of Feda and\nLeonard (prepared), if it exists, cannot be of the size indicated by\nthe Irving experiment, no less definitely than the Irving experiment\nindicates that it cannot be zero. There is a clash of testimony\nwhich must leave us uncertain which to accept unless we can show\nreason why one line of evidence is of less value than the other.\nI think there is such a reason. If we look at the \u201c Individuahty\n\u201d\nor self-consistency measurements for Leonard (prepared) in the\nThomas experiments, we see that both are negative. It is obviously\nimprobable that we shall find any relationship with another set of\nfigures, from a set of figures which is a mean of results which are\nnegatively self-consistent with one another. A true counter-\nsimilarity between Feda and Leonard (prepared) might therefore\nhave been obscured by the negative self-consistency of Leonard\n(prepared) in these experiments. The Irving experiment, in this\nrespect, is in a somewhat (but not very much) better position. The\n\u201c I \u201d measurement for Leonard prepared is -f *0306. This is positive\n\f150] Review of Carington's Work on Trance Personalities 261\nbut very small. It is indeed surprising that such large measures\nof S and of D as are found in RN 116 could have been obtained from\ndata with so little self-consistency. Since, however, the low self-\nconsistency would have tended to make these both nearer to zero,\nit is no reason for rejecting their indications as it was in the twm\nThomas experiments.\nThere appears then to be sufficient evidence that in reaction time\nmeasurements, Feda and Mrs Leonard (prepared) are countersimilar.\nThe evidence here rests on one observation (that of the Irving\nexperiment) and depends on the vahdity of the reasons I have\nsuggested for rejecting opposing evidence from other experiments.\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the observation made in TP 3 that\nFeda is again countersimilar to Mrs Leonard (p. 19d and Table II).\nThe P here is -05 which taken by itself is significant but imimpressive,\nbut taken in conjunction with the results in TP 2 is very strong\nevidence of the reality of the relation of countersimilarity. In the\nreproduction results, Feda is again not countersimilar to Mrs\nLeonard as she was not in the Irving experiment of TP 2.\nThe evidence from Mrs Garrett and her control Uvani (Table I,\nTP 2), mostly calculated from Mr Hereward Carrington\u2019s data, is of\nthe same order and points in the same direction. There are five P.G.R.\nmeasurements of similarity between IVIrs Garrett (G) and Uvani (U)\nand five reaction time ones. Of these, three PGR and four RT\nsimilarities are - ve. One PGR negative \u201c S \u201d is significant (No. 19,\n2 = -\u20223079, P = -002), one RT is nearly significant (No. 31, z=\n-\u20223083, P = 06). No positive \u201cS\u201d measurements between G and\nU are significant. The evidence here seems to me to be at least as\ngood as that derived from Mrs Leonard and Feda.\nOn the whole, it seems reasonable to conclude that there is a\ngemfine relationship of countersimilarity between Feda and Mrs\nLeonard and between Uvani and Mrs Garrett. It is a pity that this\nimportant conclusion could not have been established in a more\nconvincing way from data freer from inconsistencies. Even as it\nstands, however, I think the evidence is good enough for reasonably\nstrong conviction. Also it seems reasonable to accept W. W. C.\u2019s\nexplanation of this fact that these controls are not independent\npersonalities but are dissociated parts of the medium\u2019s personahty\n(or secondary personalities of the medium).^\n1 There is also an argument in TP 3, p. 198, against the autonomy of con-\ntrols drawn from the fact that there is a very strong resemblance between\nthe controls Feda and Silver, which seems more likely to be explained by the\nfact that the two mediums have split off similar secondaries than to a real\nresemblance between a Hindu girl and a Red Indian warrior.\n\f262 Robert H. Thouless [part\nWhether or not this relationship holds generally for all mediums\nand their controls could not, of course, be decided without investi-\ngating a greater number. W. W. C. seems to treat this result as\nfollowing from the countersimilarity of medium and control in these\ntwo cases. The fact of two controls being countersimilar to the\nmediums cannot, however, be proof that all are. The fact that\nRudi Schneider and his control Olga showed, on the contrary, a\nstrong similarity (TP 1, pp. 187 If.) need not be considered an ex-\nception to the rule of countersimilarity since it is apparent that there\nwere other grounds for not regarding Olga as a control. There is,\nhowever, a real exception in Mrs Sharplin and her control Silver\n(TP 3, p. 194 and Table II RN 3023) who show no significant simi-\nlarity or countersimilarity. If, in the future, it is shown that\ncountersimilarity is a general rule amongst controls, a satisfactory\nexplanation of this exception may be found. So long, however, as\nthe generality of the countersimilarity of controls is in question.\nSilver must be treated as an exception weakening the evidence for\nthis conclusion. Whether or not the relationship of countersimilarity\nis a general characteristic of controls (or of controls of this type)\ncan only be decided by further research on larger numbers. In view\nof the interest of this question, it is to be hoped that this further\nresearch will be carried out.\nI do not think it is possible to admit any logical force to the\nargument on p. 348 of TP 2 that such communicators as John,\nEtta and Dora are not secondary personalities because they do\nnot show countersimilarity. Even if countersimilarity were estab-\nlished as a general property of controls, it would not therefore be\nshown to be a general property of all secondary personalities. We\ncannot argue that because two monkeys are found to have tails\n(or more precisely because two out of three animals claimed as\nmonkeys have tails) that therefore any animal without a tail cannot\nbe a monkey.\nThere is another unfortunate argument on this page. Against\nthe suggestion that communicators are histrionic poses, W. W. C.\nsays that they do not show the association of reaction time and\nreproduction which seems to be the hall mark of a single and\nundivided personality and is shown by the two Gatty poses.\nW. W. C. has failed to notice that in one of the Gatty poses (Gatty,\nOxford) on p. 344, the association between reaction time and\nreproduction is strongly negative. Even if the Gatty figures are a\nmisprint (as seems likely), the statement that communicators do\nnot show association between RT and RPN is based on two only\nout of three communicators (the third does show such association).\n\f150] Review of Carington's Work on Trance Personalities 263\nObviously the number is far too small to support the general con-\nclusion that communicators do not show association between RT\nand RPN. Moreover, the test of significance on p. 345 of TP 2 is\nerroneous because W. W. C. has treated separate tests of the same\ncommunicator as independent pieces of evidence, and also because\nhe has used a method of calculation which is generally agreed to be\ninvalid if the number of cases expected in any class is less than\nfive.\nThe conclusions that I think may safely be drawn are these :\nthere is evidence of sufficient but not of coercive strength that the\ncontrols Feda and Uvani are negatively correlated to the mediums\nand to other personalities of the same manifold ;\nthis may be most\neasily explained by supposing that they are dissociated parts of\nthe medium\u2019s personality (for which there is other evidence) ;\nwhether this relationship of countersimilarity is true for all controls\nis a problem for future research ;\nthere is no evidence of this rela-\ntionship of countersimilarity being found amongst any of the trance\npersonalities that are not controls.\nIX. Intermedium Work\nIn the last section we saw that a very strong presumption had\nbeen established in TP 2 as to certain of the controls. They appeared\nnot to be autonomous personalities but secondary personalities of\nthe medium. This, I think, is the most important positive conclusion\nfrom Mr Whately Carington\u2019s research. The problem of the status\nof communicators was, at this stage, not going on so well. If we\nlook at the relationships of similarity and difference listed in Table II\nof TP 2, we see an impressive array of figures but little indication\nof what relationships they are pointing to amongst the personalities\ncompared. It is certainly true that, once we admit the force of\nthe argument at the beginning of TP 2, we can no longer hope to\n.\nbe able to settle the problem of the autonomy of communicators\nby any mere examination of coefficients of \u201c similarity \u201d and\n\u201c difference \u201d. AVe might, I think, still have hoped that these\nwould give us strong indications of how the personalities in a mani-\nfold were related. It does not appear that they do. Even if they\nhad done so, it would be necessary, however, to look in a different\ndirection for final proof. It is with the devising and carrying out\nof better methods for investigating the problem of the autonomy\nof communicators that TP 2, pt. IV, and TP 3 are mainly concerned.\nThe first venture in this direction in TP 3 need not delay us since\nthe author discarded the method immediately afterwards. The\n\f264 Robert H. Thouless [PABT\nmethod here employed is to obtain readings for the word-association\nexperiment from the communicators John and Etta through\nanother medium (Mrs Sharplin) and to compare these with the\nreactions of the same communicators when communicating through\nMrs Leonard. If the communicators could be proved to be identical\nwith the same communicator communicating through another\nmedium, their autonomy would be proved. This intermedium\ncomparison of communicating personalities who are ostensibly the\nsame has remained the basic method of all the later part of W. W. C.\u2019s\nwork although the method of making the comparison has been\nmuch improved since the first crude attempts of TP 2.\nThe distinctive feature of the now discarded method of TP 2 is\nthat (realising that a simple similarity between, let us say, John\ncommunicating through Mrs Leonard and through Mrs Sharplin\nnnght be due to similarity of these two mediums) the attempt was\nmade to get rid of the effect of the similarity of the mediums by\nthe method of \u201c partial correlation \u201d, \u2022i.e. to get a measure of how\nmuch John (through Leonard) resembled John (through Sharphn)\nwhen the effect of the similarity of the mediums was eliminated.\nW. W. C. thought, at the time of publishing TP 2, that the indica-\ntions of autonomy of John and Etta were positive but he was wisely\nsuspicious of an indication obtained so easily and pubhshed the\nresults with reserve, suggesting that it might prove that there was a\nflaw in the argument.\nIn actual fact the final similarities shown on p. 355 of TP 2 are\nnot significant either separately or together. W. W. C. was only\nmisled into thinking they were significant by repeating the mistake\n(already discussed in Section VI) of multiplying together their\nseparate probabilities in order to get their combined probabilities,\na method which (as we have seen) enormously overestimates the\nsignificance. Here he gets a combined P of -0014 (instead of the\ntrue value of -1). The matter is not important since W. W. C. had\nrealised by the time TP 3 was published that the results would have\nproved nothing about the autonomy of communicators if they had\nbeen significant.\nThe method was rejected at the beginning of TP 3 as a result\nof Professor Fisher\u2019s criticism that the partial correlation method\nwas not to be relied on when the eliminated variable was itself (as\nhere) subject to error. I think that there is a more fundamental\nobjection than this to the method as used in TP 2. If the partial\ncorrelation method had been applicable to these data and if its results\nhad been significant they would have shown only that Jg resembled\nJl and that Eg resembled E^^ more than could be accounted for\n\f150] Review of Carmgton's Work on Trance Personalities 265\nby the resemblance of the mediums. But, as we have already seen,\nany two sets of responses to the word-association test may resemble\none another more or less whether or not they are produced by the\nsame personality, and this possible cause of similarity is not elimi-\nnated by the partial correlation method. It would be necessary\nalso to show that resembled Jg and that resembled Eg sig-\nnificantly more than resembled Eg and than Jg resembled E^.^\nUnless this were done, the partial correlation method could not have\nproved the autonomy of J and E ;\nif it were done, it seems to me\nthat the partial correlation method would be unnecessary since the\nsame pair of mediums would have been used in all four comparisons.\nThe next method devised by . W. C. is not open to this objection.\nIt is, in fact, a method very close to that suggested above but is\nneater since coefficients of \u201c similarity \u201d are not calculated but the\nrequired comparison is calculated by the method of analysis of\nvariance direct from the table of word-association responses. It\nis, I think, fundamentally sound, and its devising is a feat very\ncreditable to Mr Whately Carington. That much of the super-\nstructure of TP 3 is worthless does not alter the fact of the essential\nsoundness of the foundations.\nIf we agree that mere resemblance, hovrever great, cannot be\nproof of identity, I think there should be no difficulty in seeing\nwhat kind of evidence would prove identity. Perhaps we can state\nit most simply as follows : we must prove not merely that a given\ncommunicator is like himself but that he is more hke himself than\nhe would be if he were not himself. More exactly, we must be able\nto show whether or not (communicator X communicating\nthrough medium A) is more hke Xg than he would be if the two X s\nwere not the same personality in the two cases. W. M. C.\u2019s third\narticle is devoted to discovering whether or not this can be demon-\nstrated.\nIf the problem as above stated is borne in mind, the general\nnature of this part of the enquiry should be clear even though the\ndetails may remain obscure. Let us begin by considering an analo-\ngous case in which no spirits enter. Let us suppose that I received\ntwo years ago a letter from someone who knew me in the past and\nnow needs my help. Let us further suppose that he is an illiterate\nman who has not composed the letter himself, but has given a\nsecretary the general idea of what he wanted to wnite and has left\n^ Here and hereafter, I am rising Jg as a convenient contraction for John\ncommunicating through Mrs Sharplin, Jj^ for John communicating through\nMrs Leonard, and Eg and E^^ similarly for Etta communicating respectively\nthrough the same two mediums.\n\f266 Robert H. Thouless [part\nher the task of expressing it in her own words. Let us suppose\nfurther that I received yesterday a letter ostensibly from the same\nman but composed by a different secretary. I have some reason\nfor suspecting that the writer of the second letter is an impostor,\nand is not really the same person as the writer of two years ago.\nHow am I to establish whether or not the two letters have identical\noriginators ?\nNaturally, the two letters will not be identical ;\nthey may not\neven be closely similar. Each of them has many individual pecu-\nliarities which reflect the personality of the secretary and not of\nthe originator. On the other hand, they are not likely to be wholly\ndissimilar. Any two human beings in similar circumstances may\ngive somewhat similar instructions to the person who is writing\na letter for them, and any two secretaries writing letters under\nsimilar circumstances may be expected to compose somewhat\nsimilar letters. With this amount of data, indeed, the problem will\nbe insoluble. Even though I can measure how much the two letters\nresemble each other, I cannot draw any conclusion as to the identity\nor non-identity of the originators, since I do not know how much\nthe two letters might differ although the originator of both was\none and the same person, nor do I know how much the two letters\nmight be expected to resemble each other although the originators\nof them were different.\nIf, however, I were so fortunate as to have, written by the same\ntwo secretaries, two more letters written in similar circumstances\nbut not written by the alleged individual of whose self-identity\nI am in doubt, I should have the data for the solution of my problem.\nIn order that the problem may be as closely as possible analogous\nto that of W. W. C.\u2019s research, we may suppose that the second\nletter of each secretary was written at the same time as the first,\nand that I am as doubtful about the common authorship of this\npair of letters as I am about the common authorship of the other\npair.\nLet us call the two secretaries A and B, and the two alleged\nauthors (who may prove to be four), X and Y. I want to know\nwhether is the same individual as X3 and whether is the\nsame as Yg. Comparison of X^ with Yg and of Xg with Y^ will\ntell me both how much the style of the two secretaries has in common\nand how much two letters written by different individuals in the\nsame circumstances have in common. This knowledge will enable\nme to allow both for the factor of the resemblance of secretaries\nand for the common human factor. If now I find that the letter\nof X^ resembles that of Xg strikingly more than the pair of com-\n\f150]\nBevie^v of Caringtoii\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 267\nparisons I made previously, I may conclude that and are\none and the same person ;\nsimilarly for and Yg.\nI have so far supposed that the problem of the authorship of the\nletters was decided qualitatively, by my mere impression of the\ndegree of resemblance of the different pairs of letters. Such im-\npressions, however, are unreliable, and, as a scientist, I may prefer\nto get some quantitative measure of the characters of the letters.\nI might get this by counting some characteristic features, the number\nof unusual grammatical constructions, the proportion of compound\nto simple sentences, etc. I should then have a set of numbers to\ncompare and need rely no longer on my own impressions. Then I\nshould be driven to judge the question by a method which was\nequivalent to that used by W. W. C. or was identically the same.\nEssentially the method is quite general in its nature. The above\nexample shows that it could be applied to problems outside the\nspecial field of psychical research. It seems to me that it might\nbe used, for example, in a purely agricultural problem, to test, let\nus say, whether two bags of different kinds of artificial manure\nbought at one shop were identical in composition with two bags\nostensibly of the same kind as the first pair but bought at a different\nshop. It is an advantage of a cpiantitative statistical enquiry that\nthe method of proving the self-identity of bags of manure is the\nsame as that of proving the self-identity of spirits. The criteria\nof vahdity are independent of the emotional importance to the\nenquirer of the subject of research.\nThere is one obvious limi tation to the validity of this test. Let\nus suppose that in our analogy of the letter writers, one claimed to\nbe a man I had once employed as a gardener who was asking me\nfor a loan, while the other claimed to be a woman asking me for a\nsubscription for the R.S.P.C.A. There might well be a great deal\nof resemblance between X^ and Xg and between Y,^ and Yg that\ndid not exist between X^ and Yg or between Xg and Y^ even though\nneither the two X\u2019s nor the two Y\u2019s were really the same person.\nThey would be playing the same role and would therefore tend to\nresemble each other in superficial respects. Both X\u2019s might talk\nabout apple-trees and both Y\u2019s about homeless dogs. For that\nreason it would be necessary to make the test for self-identity on\nsome characteristics such as granmiatical constructions, complexity\nof sentences, which were not affected by the role.\nSimilarly, W. W. C.\u2019s test would not be valid if applied to similar\nsuperficial characteristics of responses which might be characteristic\nof any medium (or secondary personality of a medium) playing the\npart of a clergyman or of a young woman. The actual words used\n\f268 Robert H. Thouless [part\nas responses might, for examj^le, show theological interests when J\n(a clergyman) was communicating through two mediums, even if\nthere were no real J behind the communications. It is very unlikely\nthat any similar spurious indication of self-identity would vitiate\nthe test when reaction times are used because the medium (or trance\npersonality of the medium) would have no theory as to what would\nbe the characteristic reaction times of a clergyman or even indeed\nany knowledge of the fact that reaction times are affected by\ndominant emotional interests.\nIt is not particularly easy to explain simply the method employed\nin TP 3. Essentially it is a form of the analysis of variance which\nhas already been described in Section V. Each occasion is, however,\ntreated separately. The rows are, as before, formed of responses\neach to a particular word in the word association list. There are\nfour columns of the responses of John through Mrs Leonard, of\nEtta through Mrs Leonard, of John through Mrs Sharplin and of\nEtta through Mrs Sharplin. The table for the analysis of variance\nis, therefore, as below :\nJl\nWord 1 -\nWord 2 - a.\nWord 3 -\n\u00ab3\netc.\nEl 'Tg Eg\nh (^1 ^1\nb-2 02\nThe entries a^, bj, c^, etc., are the usual quantitative expressions\nof the word-association responses made by the personality entered\nat the head of the column to the particular word of that row (thus\nin the reaction time data they are the times in seconds that the\npersonality has taken to react). As before, the problem is to discover\nhow much of the scatter of these responses is contributed by different\nfactors. In this case, the factor we are interested in is the respect\nin which J responses differ from E responses. The actual arith-\nmetical operations are explained very clearly by W. W. C. in TP 3,\npp. 202-210. Those who wish to understand the method cannot do\nbetter than work out for themselves the examples he gives.\nWe can, I think, best express in words what each z is by saying\nthat it is a measure of similarity (as was the earlier S \u201d measure-\nment). Briefly, it measures the extent to which each ostensible\ncommunicator is more similar to himself (through another medium)\nthan to the other communicator. More exactly, it shows how far\nthe similarity between J^ and J^ and between E^ and Eg is greater\nthan that between Jj^ and Eg and between Jg and E^. If all four\ncomparisons : between J^ and Jg, between E^ and Eg, between\nJl and Eg, and between E^ and Jg showed differences which were\n\f150]\nReview of Carington's Work on Trance Personalities 269\nabout the same, z would be zero or only insignificantly different\nfrom zero. Nothing would appear to belong specifically to J or to\nE. If, however, the first two of these comparisons showed consist-\nently less difference than the last two, z would be positive, and this\nwould indicate that ostensibly the same communicator, even com-\nmunicating through two different mediums, showed a degree of\nresemblance that could only be explained if he really was the same\ncommunicator.\nA separate z is worked out for each occasion and for each block\nof twenty-five words. Thus in the comparison between the Leonard\nand Sharplin material of 1935, where there are five occasions and\nfour blocks of twenty-five words, there are twenty z\u2019s for the reaction\ntime data and twenty for the reproduction material. All the z\u2019s of\nall comparisons are given in Table V at the end of TP 3.\nThe procednre has, so far, been statistically correct, and, as an\nattempt to devise a satisfactory method of investigating the problem,\nit deserves high praise. Two defects of the data have already been\nmentioned in Section III. These are : the inclusion of two sets\nof observations from the same medium obtained at different times,\nand the use of \u201c reproduction \u201d material which may not be sufficient-\nly nearly normally distributed to give reliable results. These,\nhowever, are not defects of the method.\nThe result to be expected from this experiment, if John and Etta\ncommunicating through Mrs Leonard are identifiably the same\nJohn and Etta as communicate through Mrs Sharplin, is that the\nz\u2019s obtained at the end should be significantly positive. If responses\nostensibly from the same communicator through different mediums\nhave no more in common than have responses from different\ncommunicators, then the z\u2019s will be randomly distributed about\nzero. No reasonable meaning can, I think, be attached to negative\nz\u2019s. They would suggest that responses ostensibly from the same\ncommunicator through different mediums have less in common\nthan they would have if they were from different communicators.\nThis does not seem reasonable on any hypothesis.\nThe question of the autonomy of communicators is, therefore,\nto be decided by finding out whether the z\u2019s tend to be significantly\npositive or whether, on the other hand, they tend to be randomly\ndistributed about zero. If the first alternative is true, the autonomy\nof communicators is indicated ;\nif the second, then the experiment\nprovides no evidence for the autonomy of communicators.\nWhich of these two expectations is fulfilled is decisively shown\nin para. 25. The mean value of the z\u2019s is H--035 with standard error\nof -041. The likelihood of such a deviation from zero occurring\n\f270 Robert H. Thouless [part\nby chance in a set of values randomly distributed about zero is\n\u20224, that is, it is likely to happen nearly as often as not in a series of\ntests. There is no evidence here that there is any tendency of the\nz\u2019s to differ from zero.\nIt is true that AV. W. C. mentions that one of the sets of \u201c repro-\nduction \u201d z\u2019s has a mean which differs significantly from zero. This\nis the mean of the twenty z\u2019s obtained by the comparison of communi-\ncations through Mrs Leonard and those through Mrs Sharplin in\n1935. The mean value is -f-218 with standard error -091. If this\nwere taken as an isolated value, P wmuld be -017 making it easily\nsignificant. It is, actually, the selected best of six means, and the\nprobability of at least one value as high as this occurring as a\nrandom deviate from zero in six trials is about -1. This is not enough\nfor significance, but if there were no grounds for doubting the\nreliability of RPN results (as there were none when AV. AV. C.\npublished this paper), it would make us hesitate to accept the\notherwise clear negative indication of the results. Since, how^ever,\nthere is grave reason for doubting the rehability of RPN evidence\n(see Section III) and since the RT results for the corresponding\ncomparison are completely insignificant (\n- -003 with S.E. -091),\nthere seems no reason for trying to draw any conclusion from this\none unexpectedly high mean.\nIt says much for the honesty of the investigator that he presents\nso clearly such strong evidence against the hypothesis which, at\nthe time of writing, he believed that his investigation supported.\nUnfortunately, he did not stop at this point but went on to an\ningenious but mistaken attempt to wrest from the data a significance\nwhich they do not possess. I do not want to dwell too long on the\nerrors of TP 3 (sections 27 onw^ards) since these are now recognised\nby AV. AV. C. It is necessary, however, I think, to indicate them\nshortly to prevent others from being misled by them.\nAVe need not trouble much about the problem dealt with in\npara. 27 (the excess of - ve z\u2019s in the comparison between the two\nsets of data olitained from Mrs Leonard in different years), since it\nis not relevant to the hypothesis under consideration. Significantly\nnegative z\u2019s could (as we have seen) only mean that responses\nostensibly from the same communicator have less in common than\nthey would have if they were from different coinmunicators. This\nis an unintelligible result in any case, and is certainly no easier\nto explain on the hypothesis that the John and the Etta of 1933\nare the same personalities respectively as the John and the Etta\nof 1935, than on the hypothesis that they are not.\nIn para. 28, AV. AV. C. reconsiders the means of the z\u2019s obtained\n\f150] Review of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 271\nin his six sets of comparisons. These, certainly, are data relevant\nto the hypothesis under investigation, but they have already been\ntreated as a whole and appeared then to be randomly distributed.\nThey still remain random (with the possible exception dealt with\nabove) when spht up. W. W. C. obtains a combined P of T5,\nwhich he says is suggestive but not coercive. Actually the P is\nsomewhat overestimated by this method since it treats +ve and\n-ve deviations as equally providing support for the hypothesis\ntested, whereas, as we have seen, only +ve deviations are evi-\ndence for the autonomy of personalities. A P of -15 is not,\nhowever, even suggestive. A total irregularity that could occur\nonce in seven times by the chances of sampling is quite consistent\nwith the hypothesis that all the means are random deviates from\nzero.\nIn para. 29, W. W. C. calculates the \u201c slopes \u201d of the six sets of\nvalues, i.e. the rate of change of the mean for all occasions from\nblock to block. Some of these are fairly large and the total irre-\ngularity would appear to be just significant if we treated the\n\u201c reaction time \u201d and the \u201c reprodixction \u201d results as independent\n(which does not appear to be justifiable). Also in assessing the\nsignificance of these values, it must be borne in mind that they are\nonly one of many characteristics of the data that might have\nbeen calculated {e.g. the means of the blocks, the slopes showing\nthe rate of change with occasion, etc.) and the likelihood that at\nleast one of a set of characteristics will show a given deviation\nfrom expectation is considerably greater than would be its likehhood\nif it were the one appropriate characteristic to measure for the\ntesting of the hypothesis in question. If the slopes were significant,\nit does not seem that they would indicate the autonomy of John\nand Etta and I find it difficult to see what they would indicate.\nThis is also true of the correlation between slopes and means\nworked out in para. 30 which seems to indicate a tendency for\n\u201c whatever is going on to get more so as the sitting proceeds \u201d.\nThe correlation is -78 which nearly satisfies the criterion for signi-\nficance.^ If another experiment confirmed this correlation, it\nwould indicate something curious about the data. Again it is\ndifficult to say what, but there seems no reason for attributing it\nto the autonomy of communicators, particularly since the relation-\nship seems to hold for negative means (which contradict this hypo-\nthesis) as well as for positive ones (which are in its favour).\n1 At first sight, the correlation seems to be much less than this but that is\nbecause there is an obvious misprint in the list of means on p. 215. A minus\nsign has been omitted before the last mean.\nQ\n\f272 Robert H. Thouless [part\nIn paras. 32 and 33, a mistaken metliod of coml^ining the pro-\nbabilities from the above four lines of evidence is developed (giving\nfor the combined P\u2019s the startling value of -000013). This has\nalready been listed as one of W. W. C.\u2019s recantations and no more\nneed be said about it. He also, however, uses the orthodox \u201c nega-\ntive logarithm \u201d method (p. 220) and gets an overall probability\nof -01 in support of the thesis that communicators are autonomous.\nThis would be a perfectly correct procedure if all four pieces of\nevidence were independent (which they are not completely) and\nif they were all evidence for the hypothesis in question (which we\nhave seen they are not). Since these necessary conditions are not\nfulfilled, the conclusion here indicated must also be rejected.\nThis may seem to be somewhat destructive criticism. Any\ndiscussion of this part of TP 3 must be so. I do not, however,\nwish it to be concluded that nothing can be established from this\nwork. Having cleared away this unfortunate superstructure of\nfallacious argument, there remain the facts of paragraph 25 in\nwhich it is seen that the z\u2019s are randomly distributed as they would\nbe if there were nothing peculiar to the alleged same communicators\nwhen communicating through different mediums. In other words,\nthe results of the experiment are not merely that it fails to show\nthat the communicators are autonomous personalities, but that it\nconforms remarkably well to the hypothesis that they are not. It\ncannot, of course, prove that the alleged John and Etta communi-\ncating through one medium are not the same personalities as John\nand Etta communicating through a different medium but it does\nshow that if there is anything pecuhar to John and to Etta, the\nword-association test fails to reveal this fact.\nThe imperfections of the data mentioned above do not give a\nvalid reason, I think, for rejecting this negative conclusion although\nthey would provide reason for being suspicious of a positive one.\nThe inclusion of two sets of data from Mrs Leonard might have\nproduced (but, in fact, did not produce) spurious indications of\nautonomy, but they would not have masked genuine indications\nof autonomy from the other comparisons. The same is true of the\ninclusion of \u201c reproduction \u201d material. I do not know whether the\nunsuitability of this material for the mathematical treatment which\nwas used would have made the z\u2019s obtained from it too high or too\nlow. If they were too high, they might have produced spurious\nindications of autonomy, but if they were too low they would not\nhave masked genuine indications from the \u201c reaction time \u201d data.\nIt would certainly be a good thing to have confirmation of the result\nby more extensive material from which data of the kind criticised\n\f150] Review of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 273\nhas been excluded, but the evidence as it stands is good and its\nindications are unquestionably negative.\nThey are negative in the sense that they show that the experiment\ndoes not give evidence in favour of the autonomy of communicators.\nHow far can they be claimed as evidence that there are no autono-\nmous communicators? Obviously no failure to detect autonomous\ncommunicators could be final evidence that there were no autono-\nmous communicators to detect, but it might provide indications\nin that direction of greater or lesser evidential value. How great is\nthe evidential value of such indications must obviously depend\non how likely it is that the test would reveal the autonomy of\ncommunicators if they had been autonomous. This depends on\nwhether the word-association test (under the condition of com-\nmunication through a medium) obtains results that are really\ncharacteristic of the personality under investigation, and, if it does,\non how sensitive is the method of distinguishing personalities used\nin the inter-medium work.\nIt seems that the sensitivity of the method could be tested\nwithout much difficulty in some such way as that of carrying out\nthe same procedure with the undoubtedly separate personalities\nof living subjects, and discovering whether their separateness is\nshown by significantly positive z\u2019s. I understand that, in a future\npublication by W. W. C., some such test of sensitivity will be\nmade.\nEven, however, if the procedure is shown to give a sufficiently\nsensitive test of the autonomy of personalities tested directly by\nthe word-association test, it might be the case that the necessity\nfor communicators to respond through a medium prevented the\nresponses from adequately characterising the communicator. This\npossibility appears to be more difficult to investigate, and unless\nit can in some way be eliminated, it seems that W. W. C.\u2019s results\nmay provide no evidence for autonomous communicators but also\nno very strong evidence against autonomous communicators.\nAt the time of publication of TP 3, its author supposed that its\nevidence supported the hypothesis that communicators were\nautonomous personalities. His conclusion was that, on the question\nof an extraneous influence corresponding to John and Etta, \u201c If\nnothing more than a few million pounds or the fate of a couple of\nnations were involved, I should feel disposed to declare flatly that\nthe operation of some such extraneous influence had been estab-\nlished \u201d (WC 3, p. 222). But in view of the importance of the issue,\nhe preferred not to commit himself. Nevertheless, it seems a fair\ninference from these words, that he regarded the conclusion as\n\f274 Robert H. Thouless [part\nbeing jjretty well established (presumably he would not lightly\nsacrifice either a few million pounds or a couple of nations).\nThis conclusion, I understand, he is no longer prepared to defend.\nIf, however, the evidence of the later sections of TP 3 had been\n(as W. W. C. supposed it was) reliable, independent and relevant to\nthe hypothesis in question, the conclusion would have been the\none indicated by the evidence. Although W. W. C. was certainly\nwrong on this point, it does not mean that the enquiry was not\nworth while or that nothing has been achieved by it. The original\nquestion was worth asking, and the methods might have given a\npositive answer to it. In any case, negative conclusions are no\nless worth while to scientific progress than positive ones although\nthey are less satisfactory to those who have done the work for them.\nIt would have been more exciting for Mr Whately Carington (and\nfor us all) if he had made the first quantitative demonstration of\nthe reality of spirit communications through mediums. It is,\nhowever, no less creditable to him that he has devised a satisfactory\ntechnique for testing this problem although the result of the test\nappears so far to be entirely negative.\nX. Conclusions\nWe saw at the beginning that Mr Whately Carington set out to\nsolve three main problems. First, to devise a quantitative method\nof experimenting on trance personalities. Secondly, to use this\nmethod to find out whether it could provide evidence for or against\nthe autonomy of spirit communicators. Thirdly, to find out as\nmuch as possible about the psychology of the trance state.\nThe first aim has been achieved. In TP 3 and more satisfactorily\nin later work still unpublished, a method has been devised which is\npracticable and fundamentally sound. Its general principles could\nobviously be used with other material than the reactions obtained\nby the word-association test. It could, in fact, be used with any\ntest whose results could be expressed quantitatively and whose\nnumerical results were distributed approximately normally. The\nonly obvious limitation of its validity would then be that it must\nnot be used on material (such as the actual words given as responses\nin the word-association tests) in which similarities between the\nsame communicator through different mediums might be the results\nof the mediums\u2019 knowledge of salient features of the alleged com-\nmunicator\u2019s character and interests.\nThe second aim seems also to have been achieved. The results\nobtained are those which would lie expected if there were no real\n\f150] Review of Carington\u2019s Work on Trance Personalities 275\ncommunicating spirits who communicated sometimes through one\nmedium and sometimes through another. No negative conclusion\ncan be final, and it is reasonable for those who believe in the\nautonomy of communicators to try other tests by the same method.\nIf these are rigidly applied and rigidly evaluated and are found to\ngive positive results, the existence of autonomous communicators\nwill be proved. If these tests too give negative results, the conclu-\nsion that there are no autonomous communicators in seances will\nbecome a very probable one.\nFinally, there is the third object of throwing light on the psycho-\nlogy of trance states. There are many indications, of which I think\nthe most important is the countersimilarity of controls indicating\nthe possibility that these are secondary personalities produced by\nrepression. Most of the evidence on the psychology of trance states\nseems, however, to require reconsideration and amplification.\n\fNOTE ON PROFESSOR THOULESS\u2019 PAPER\nIt was Samuel Butler, I think, who observed that \u201c Life is like playing\nthe violin in public, and learning the mstrument as one goes on\nThis aphorism, which is only too true in so many contexts, I have\nfound acutely aj^plicable throughout the work discussed by Professor\nThouless. Certainly I have had to \u201c learn the instrument \u201d as I went\nalong, and it is evident from his most valuable and conscientious\ncriticism that I have made very many mistakes of all orders of magni-\ntude. Still, it is something to feel, as I think I am justified in doing,\nthat I have shown the instrument to be worth playing and even,\nperhaps, to have produced \u201c . . . something remotely resembling an\nair \u201d, however far short of my original hopes the ultimate results\nmay have fallen. In so far as I may unwittingly have misled many of\nmy readers, I can only express my deep regret, and plead with Dr\nJohnson \u201c Ignorance, Madam, sheer ignorance \u201d.\nBroadly speaking, I accejjt nearly aU of Professor Thouless\u2019 criti-\ncisms at their face value, my differences, if any, being on minor points\nof wording rather than essentials. There are, however, a few points\non which comment seems worth while :\n(1) The credit for devising the basic method used in TP 3 should,\nas there stated, be given to Mr W. L. Stevens, of the Galton Labora-\ntory, and not to me.\n(2) Whereas it is true that the reproduction data, being necessarily\n1 or 0, cannot legitimately be treated by analysis of variance, for the\nreasons given, this does not imjdy that they are valueless. They may\nbe dealt with by appropriate methods of the \u201c contmgency \u201d type\nand accordingly represent valuable data worth the collecting. I hope\nto study them anew whenever opportunity offers, although I greatly\ndoubt whether they wdll yield results appreciably different from those\ngiven by reaction times.\n(3) It is true that I used the \u201c finger print \u201d analogy in TP 1 and\nthat this suffers from the defect mentioned by Professor Thouless.\nBut this was not because I did not reahse the importance of the point\nin question, as is shown by my comparison with Bertillon measure-\nments which has not this defect. It was a concession, apjiarently\nmisguided, to the fact that hundreds of people have heard of finger\nprmts for one who is familiar with the earlier (Bertillon) technique.\n276\n\fPART 150] Note on Professor Thouless' Paper 277\n(4) As regards the important question of the counter-similarity of\ncontrols, there seems not much doubt\u2014even after Professor Thouless\nhas done his righteous worst\u2014that this is a genuine phenomenon, to\nbe interpreted as I have maintamed. I hope, however, to be able to\nre-examine this question with greater particularity, working the\nresults by separate occasions and applying corrections to blocks of\n25 words instead of to the sitting as a whole. The fact that the\nRPN data, though correlated with RT, do not in general indicate\ncountersimilarity, is jirobably due to their inajjpropriate treatment by\nanalysis of variance.\n(5) I venture to thhik that Professor Thouless is definitely in error\nwhen he says (p. 269) that \u201c no reasonable meaning can be attached\nto negative z\u2019s Actually, it is not difficult to show that a negative z\nis hkely to result if a certain proportion of J and E times are inter-\nchanged ;\nthat is to say, if, fairly often, we actually get an E time\nwhen we think we are getting a J, and vice versa.\nBut this is a topic to be discussed in a later communication, in which\nI hope to deal with an extension and revision of the inter-medium\nR.T. work. I may say at once, however, lest future hopes be aroused,\nthat at present there seems no prospect of reversing Professor Thouless\u2019\nconclusion, which must, I thinlc, be unequivocally accepted, so far as\nthe data at present available are concerned.\nIn conclusion, I must express my most sincere thanks to Professor\nThouless, not only for the great amount of trouble he has taken, but\nfor the singular combination of ruthlessness and sympathy he has\nbrought to bear on the work.\nThe above, I should like to emphasise, is no empty form of words ;\nfor, although I have yet to hear that fruit-trees enjoy the process of\npruning, all that matters is that their fruit should ultimately be sound.\nw. w. c.\n\f>, vn\n'll!\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 151\nSUPERNORMAL FACULTY\nAND THE STRUCTURE OF THE MIND\nBEING\nTHE FREDERIC W. H. MYERS LECTURE, 1937\n{delivered October 27, 1937)\nBy C. a. Mace, M.A.\nIt is a paradox that should dehght the Hegehan philosopher and the\nFreudian psychologist alike that the defences we erect within\nourselves against prejudice and superstition themselves tend so to\nencrust and petrify the mind that it becomes increasingly resistant\nto novel truths. No one has had better reason to be conscious of\nthis paradox than the student of psychical research in his efforts to\ninvoke co-operation from orthodox working scientists in relevant\nand allied fields of investigation.\nThe distinguished exceptions to this generalization are in large\nmeasure standing witnesses to the greatness of the achievements of\nFrederic Myers whose scholarly and balanced presentation of the\nfacts first impressed the more discerning and continues progressively\nto undermine the resistances in the body of working scientists as a\nwhole. So much progress has been made that now it is hardly\npossible for the working psychologist, at any rate, to proceed with\nhis proper task without taking serious cognisance of the evidence\nfor the supernormal aspects of the personahty of man.\nAccordingly, I propose to take this opportunity to jiay my\ntribute to the memory of Myers not by presuming to speak as one\nwho has himself graduated in the more specialized and technical\nfields of psychical research, but by speaking as one such ordinary\nworking psychologist who, though concerned in general with the\n279\nR\n\f280 Supernormal Faculty [part\nnormal functions of the normal mind, finds it necessary to adjust his\nconcepts to the facts which psychical research has brought to light.\nIt serves to raise important issues straight away if the question\nbe bluntly put : How far does the professional student of the normal\nmind accept the findings of psychical research? Does he believe\nthat telepathy occurs? Does he accept the evidence for clair-\nvoyance, for survival, for any of the alleged material phenomena?\nIf he does, why do none of these important matters find a j^lace in\nthe textbooks of his science? If not, where precisely do his objections\nand his dilficulties lie?\nSpeaking for myself, but trusting that my answer is not eccen-\ntric or unrepresentative, what I should begin by saying is this :\nStrictly, the attitude of belief is one that jfiays a very much smaller\npart in scientific thought than is apt to be supposed\u2014a fact which\noften makes the scientist appear more evasive and non-committal\nthan in fact he is. If we take any important current scientific\nhypothesis and ask the scientist whether he accepts or believes it, he\nwill almost certainly say that he does not. He will say ; From the\nnature of the case, from the fact that it is only an hypothesis, I do\nnot believe it. All I can say, as a scientist, is that I seriously entertain\nit. I am prepared to treat it with the respect due to any hypothesis\nput forward by a fellow scientist whose intellectual powers and whose\nintegrity I acknowledge, and I am prejrared to devote my time to\nconducting investigations which will contribute to its verification,\nits modification or rejection. This is the essential form in which a\nscientific hypothesis obtains recognition. And this, I take it, is the\nkind of recognition that Myers wished to see accorded to the hypo-\ntheses of the field in which he was a pioneer.\nTo say all this, however, is to give only a part of the answer to\nthe question I have raised. Let us consider in a little more detail\nthe problem of tele])athy which in this respect provides a represen-\ntative, relatively simple, but undoubtedly critical case. Is telepathy\nan established fact? The answer depends upon an analysis of the\nempirical and the hypothetical elements in the assertion that a\n])rocess of telepathic communication has occurred. Clearly, all that\nis observationally verified in the most direct way in any particular\ncase is a certain detailed parallehsm of events. Sujipose that to one\njjerson. A, a complex series of events occurs\u2014he is involved, for\nexam])le, in an unusual kind of accident. Simultaneously, or at\napproximately the same time, a detailed rej)resentation of this\nsequence of events is present to the mind of B, another person\nsituated at some considerable distance from A. Each event, or\ncomplex of events, may bo empirically verified. A himself, or a wit-\n\fand the Structure of the Mind 281\n151 ]\nness, can verify the details of the accident ;\nB can verify the presence\nof the representation to his own mind. In accordance with prin-\nciples of evidence which we find satisfactory in almost every other\nconnection each of us can know that this parallehsm of events has\noccurred. Admittedly there are difiicidties here but they are diffi-\nculties of an uninteresting kind. In principle, the evidence may be\nsuch that an \u201c incredible \u201d occurrence may have to be believed ;\nand anyone who refuses to accept this evidence, whether he be\nscientist or not, will thereby remove himself from court to enjoy the\nimenviable reputation for caution which we accord to those who\nchoose to question the historical existence of Napoleon.\nGranting the parallehsm of events, what more do we need?\nObviously something more. The assertion that the parallelism is\nthe parallelism of communication contains imphcations which can\nbe verified only in ways much more complicated than those by\nwhich we establish particular facts. At the very least the assertion\nembraces two negative propositions :\n(i) that the parallelism was\nnot a chance coincidence ;\n(ii) that it did not arise in consequence\nof any one of a certain set of causal processes which we might specify\nby enumeration.\nThese two assertions are connected. To deny coincidence is to\nassert causal connection. The two possibilities are alternative and\ndisjunctive. It cannot be both and it cannot be neither. If it is not\na coincidence the connection must be causal, there is no third\nalternative. The second assertion is of the kind that the formal\nlogician would describe as a compound negative proposition. The\nparallehsm does not arise from sight, hearing or smell, nor from\nmemory, nor from inference, nor from any other of the commonly\nrecognised processes through which ideas come to be present to a\nmind.\nHere, then, is an obvious source of some of the residual doubts\nwith which the accumulating evidence for telepathy continues to be\nreceived. To establish the contention that a parallelism of events\narises from a supernormal mode of communication we have to\nestablish a causal proposition ;\nand we have further to establish a\ncomplex combination of negations.\nIn principle, two lines of procedure are open. In the first we do\nnot formulate any specific theory concerning the nature or the\nmodus operandi of the causal factors involved, but try to prove\neach of the constituent negative propositions one by one. The\nalternative procedure is the logically more direct but practically\nno less prodigious undertaking of attempting to discover the positive\ncharacter of the process.\n\f282 Supernormal Faculty [part\nTo the former of these procedures belong the now highly techni-\ncal applications of statistical methods. In these we have an instru-\nment which enables us to prove that a parallelism must be in some\nway causal without knowing ivhat the causal connection is. It is\nnot in the least to disparage Avork along these lines to say that it is\nsubject to inherent limitations, and that it cannot in itself provide\nall the information Ave require. To say this is merely to repeat what\nstatisticians themselves have emphasised and what those who have\nused these methods AA\u2019ould readily endorse.\nThe progress of science, generally, depends upon the preservation\nof the appropriate balance betAveen empirical observation and theor-\netical construction. To tliis the science of the supernormal can be\nno exception. And here again our thoughts must turn to Myers in\nwhose monumental work Ave find a combination of factual record\nand cautious construction strikingly contrasted with pedestrian\nempiricism on the one hand and with undisciplined speculation on\nthe other.\nThat the case for telepathy is not more widely admitted is, I think,\nin some measure a consequence of the fact that in recent years the\nconstruction of hypotheses has not kept pace Avith the accumulation\nof facts. What avc need, I would suggest, is not so much quite new\nhypotheses but hypotheses Avhich are richer in detail, hypotheses\nAve can test, and refute, then modify and test again.\nIt is my hope that such hypotheses will be found (and here,\n{jerhaps, I must ask you to make alloAAmnces for the predilections\nof one whose experience is restricted in the main to the study of the\nnormal) not by starting ah initio with radically novel conceptions of\nthe human mind, but by the piece-meal and progressive modification\nof concejAts which have proved their utility in more familiar fields.\nA psychologist who is conscious of AAdiat he is about Avill always have\nit in the back of his mind that sooner or later revolutionary hypo-\ntheses may well be required, but these are not the hypotheses AAuth\nwhich to begin. For this reason, I propose in what follows to try\nto make more explicit some of the more ordinary concepts with\nAvhich the orthodox psychologist tries to interpret the facts which\ncome las Avay, so that Ave may proceed to ask AAFere more precisely\nnew formulations are likely to be required.\nPiecing together relevant data draAvn from many sources we are\nlefl to picture the constitution of man as an immensely complex\nmechanism the salient characteristic of Avhich is the capacity to\nrespond to stimulation. As such it is a mechanism consisting of\ntAvo broadly contrasted parts\u2014a mechanism of reception and a\nmechanism of response.\n\f151 ]\nand the Structure of the Mind 283\nAs a receptive apparatus man consists of a set of organs each of\nwhich is selectively sensitive to its own appropriate type of electro-\nmagnetic, chemical or grosser physical mode of stimulation ;\nand as\na responsive apparatus he consists of a set of organs used to produce\neffects upon things in his environment.\nIn the cycle of response to stimulation we have presented for\nanalysis a causal chain the main links in which can be broadly\nenumerated as follows :\n(i) First we have an initiating event\u2014the remote stimulus, such as\nthe vibrations in a bell or a change in the temperature of a filament,\n(ii) There is then an external transmissive process through which\ncorresponding changes\u2014sound, hght, heat, etc.\u2014are propagated\nthrough a more or less homogeneous medium. This constitutes the\nimmediate or proximate stimulus, (iii) Then occurs a change in the\nappropriate receptor organ of the body as the transmitted impulse\nimpinges upon it. (iv) There follows an internal transmissive\nreceptive process wherein another type of change is propagated\nthrough the more or less homogeneous conductive medium of the\nafferent nerves, (v) The receptive process, physiologically con-\nceived, is completed by a central process which can in part be\nlocated in certain definite areas of the sensory cortex to which the\nafferent paths proceed, (vi) There follows a further central change\nwhich initiates the second half of the process\u2014a central responsive\nprocess which, too, can in part be located in another definite area of\nthe brain, (vii) A second internal transmissive process ensues\u2014the\ninternal transmissive responsive process through the conductive\nmedium of the efferent nerves, (viii) Completing the organic\nsequence there occurs a set of changes in specialized effector organs\nwhich either directly produce effects upon the external environment\nor initiate further changes in the organism itself. In the former case\nwe can normally distinguish two final phases in the total cycle, viz.,\n(ix) A second external transmissive process through an appropriate\nconductive external medium, and (x) a terminal change in some\nremote object. This object may, of course, be another organism ;\nin which case the terminal phases of one cycle are the initiating\nphases in a second cycle of the same general type.\nThis is one of the simplest cases, but of course it is by no means the\nonly type of process exemplified in the normal interaction between\nthe individual and his environment.\nThe problems which arise in the attempt to elucidate in detail the\ncourse of events here summarily described are of extremely varied\nand extremely difficult kinds. The solutions of these problems\ndepend not only upon specialized physical, biochemical, physiological\n\f284 Supernormal Faculty [part\nand psychological research but also upon the clarification of funda-\nmental philosophical and logical issues. I shall restrict myself,\nhowever, in this discussion to those points which are most germane\nto the problem of supernormal faculty.\nTo begin with we may note the extraordinary lack of homogeneity\nin the concepts required even to describe this sequence of events.\nThree antitheses in particular call for scrutiny.\nFirst there is the antithesis between the strictly physical and the\nstrictly psychological concepts. It is a matter of pretty general\nagreement that the constitution of physical objects and the nature of\nphysical processes can be described in terms of a very fimited number\nof fundamental concepts, and it is further agreed that in terms of\nthese concepts we can not describe the states of consciousness or\nexperiences of individuals. My preliminary description of the pro-\ncess of response to stimulation has been given mainly in physical\nterms, or in terms which could in principle be reduced to the funda-\nmental concepts of physics. But it is clear that in any adequate\naccount of this cycle of events we should have to make statements\nconcerning the experiences of the individual who responds to stimu-\nlation, and such statements would introduce the distinctive con-\ncepts of psychology.\nNext, and not less important, is the antithesis between the con-\ncepts employed in a strictly physical description and those which\nenter into the plain language of everyday usage. It is, I think,\nimportant to stress the fact that this second distinction is funda-\nmental. It is not merely that scientific language is more precise, or\nthat it is \u201c technical \u201d ;\nthe difference is one of kind\u2014of a kind\nmost clearly illustrated in the difference between the common-sense\ndescription of fight and colour and the scientific description of the\n\u201c corresponding \u201d electro-magnetic waves. Traditionally, this\ndistinction has commonly been assimilated by philosophers either\nto the distinction between matter and mind, or to that between\nthe \u201cprimary\u201d and the \u201csecondary\u201d or higher order properties\nof material things. For the present I wish merely to note the anti-\nthesis without making any special assumption regarding its nature.\nThe third antithesis to which I would draw attention is that\nbetween the brute empirical, or observational, data incorporated\nin our account of response to stimulation and the non-empirical\nelements\u2014the hypotheses, constructions and methodological as-\nsumptions by the utilization of which the otherwise detached\nempirical data are assembled to yield the picture of a coherent causal\nchain. It would take more than the time available for this discussion\neven to state the many hypotheses relevant to the account given of\n\f161 ]\nand the Structure of the Mirul 285\neach phase of the process\u2014physical hypotheses concerning the\nnature of the stimulating object and the constitution of the external\nmedia, physiological hypotheses concerning the receptor processes\nand internal conduction, and psychological hypotheses concerning\nthe experiences of the individual who responds to stimulation.\nWhat in the present connection is of particular importance is the\ndistinction within the non-empirical elements between the special\nhypotheses of each of the relevant sciences and the more general\nassumptions\u2014of a methodological character\u2014concerning the nature\nof the causal nexus, as such, through which each phase of the process\nis linked to its neighbours. It is from such general presuppositions\nthat we are led to introduce for example the concepts of physical\nand mental \u201c dispositions\nIt is clear that we cannot account for the causal process simply in\nterms of a sequence of events or occurrences. We cannot account for\nthe connections either in terms solely of the actual occurrences\nobserved or solely in terms of these together with other actual\noccurrences hypothetically assumed. In addition to occurrences\nwe postulate causal factors of a persistent (as opposed to an occur-\nrent) nature.\nThe action of a stimulus or agent upon any material substance\nwould seem most commonly to produce two types of effect\u2014firstly\na more or less transient event, and secondly a more or less permanent\nchange of state. Subjecting a bar of tempered steel to heat, for\nexample, produces a change of temperature in the bar and it produces\na persistent change in its elasticity. Stroking a bar of iron with a\nmagnet produces transient events in that bar and at the same time\ninduces in it persistent magnetic properties. Similarly, the fact\nthat a burnt child dreads the fire suggests that the temporary\napphcation of a nocive stimulus induces, firstly, a temporary change\nin experience and behaviour\u2014the immediate \u201c response \u201d\u2014and,\nsecondly, a persistent disposition to behave in certain ways under\ncertain conditions.\nWe may picture to ourselves what happens in the case of the\nmagnetized bar of iron by saying that this bar really consists of a\nmultitude of smaller natural magnets in higgledy-piggledy order,\nand by supposing that stroking the bar caused first the occurrent\nmovements of these component magnets (which movements formed\npart of the immediate effect) and second it caused these component\nmagnets to assume and remain in a new kind of arrangement\u2014this\nbeing a standing arrangement which will persist until something\nelse happens to alter it again.\nSimilarly, we may be tempted to picture the dispositional change\n\f286 Supernormal Faculty [PABT\nin the burnt child by saying that the original stimulus, in addition to\nproducing such events as the movements and experiences which\nconstituted the immediate response, produced some new \u201c standing\narrangement \u201d in the elements of his nervous system. But here\nthe theory of dispositions is complicated by the antithesis between\nphysical and mental properties. An alternative account is provided\nby saying that the long period effect is to be explained by reference\nto a change in the \u201c standing arrangements \u201d of the child\u2019s mind.\nThis is a comphcation which will occupy us further in the\nsequel.\nNotwithstanding the obscurity and the hypothetical character of\nmuch that it contains, this account of the general constitution of\nman provides a convenient starting point for an inquiry into the\nnature of the supernormal faculties.\nWe may note one small promising feature straight away. The\nvaried forms of supernormal process for which the strongest claims\nhave been advanced fall quite naturally into two main classes cor-\nresponding with those into which normal powers have been divided\nthe receptive and the executive. Telepathy, clairvoyance, and pre-\ncognition exemplify supernormal reception ;\nlevitation, materializa-\ntion and allied phenomena suggest the operation of powers of\naction and response other than those that employ the mechanisms\nof the normal neuro-muscular and glandular systems. Of course, the\nantithesis must not be too sharply stressed. Telepathy, for example,\nmay be regarded either as an executive or as a receptive function\naccording as we suppose its distinctive feature to consist in a pecuhar\nsupernormal act of the agent initiating the communication or in a\npecuhar supernormal type of sensitivity in the recipient. In point\nof fact it is not improbable that telepathic communication depends\nupon two distinct supernormal faculties, corresponding to these two\ncases, each of which calls for separate investigation. In my present\ndiscussion, however, I shall be almost exclusively concerned with\ncases in which the element of supernormahty enters primarily into\nthe receptive process.\nThe question next to be raised is : In what way, and at what point\nprecisely, does supernormality intervene? Clearly, intervention\nmust be located somewhere in the mtermediate phases of the process.\nThe remote or initiating stimulus is not itself supernormal. In\nclairvoyance, telepathy or divination, for example, what is appre-\nhended and is the initiating cause of the act of apprehension is a\nnatural event, commonly something happening in the material world\nwhich from some vantage point can be presented through the normal\nchannels of sense perception. So, too, is the terminal phase of the\n\f151\n]\nand the Structure of the Mind 287\nprocess, in its intrinsic nature, an event of perfectly normal con-\nstitution\u2014a cognitive experience which can be described in the\nterminology accepted by psychologists of the normal. There is\nnothing in the nature of a perception or a thought as presented to\nintrospection which enables us to distinguish the normal from the\nsupernormal. The distinction lies in the circumstances under which\nthe perception or thought occurs.\nIn the case of conceptual, ideational, or generally nonper-\nceptual types of awareness, there is a further observation to be\nmade which also helps us to restrict the field in which the intrusion\nof the supernormal must be sought. When someone is conscious\nof an event not sensibly presented there are three things to be dis-\ntinguished ; (1) the bare presence of the idea of this occurrence to\nmind, (2) the belief in this occurrence, and (3) the further conditions\nwhich are satisfied when the occurrence of the event is not merely\nentertained, not only believed, but in addition is known. Now in\nthe case of supernormal consciousness of the non-perceptual type\nthere is, so far as I can see, nothing supernormal in the genesis of\nbehef, and there is nothing supernormal in the epistemology of the\ncase. Given that the idea is present to nfind, the fact that it is\naccepted as true can in principle be explained by general psychological\nprinciples, and when it is known to he true this wdll be because it\nsatisfies the conditions which the epistemologist formulates in the\nordinary way for the purpose of distinguishing knowledge from mere\nbelief.\nThese considerations all serve to simplify and restrict our problem.\nThey reinforce what has earlier been said to the effect that what is\ncritical and essential in the assertion that supernormal communica-\ntion has occurred is the causal implication of the statement. If I am\nnot over-simphfying the issue\u2014and even on this view it remains, in\nall conscience, sufficiently comphcated\u2014our inquiry resolves itself\ninto a study in causality. The supernormality of supernormal\ncognition resides in the supernormality of the causal process upon\nwhich cognition depends. Accordingly our next step will be to\nexamine in somewhat greater detail the precise nature of the causal\nnexus as it is exhibited in the normal process of reception.\nSo long as we try to formulate an account of the sequence of\nevents in terms acceptable to reflective common sense and not in\nterms of the more sophisticated special philosophical and scientific\ntheories, we postulate, to begin with, a number of particular sub-\nstances or things to which and in which these events happen. These\nevents are in general changes in the internal states of these things or\nchanges in their spatial or other relations to one another. Between\n\fSupernormal Faculty\n288 [part\nsuch changes we assume that the things in question persist in certain\nstates and relations.\nWe have observed that the characters of these things may be\ndivided into material characters and mental characters, and further\nthat we can distinguish primary and secondary properties. Accord-\ningly we are compelled to make certain assumptions concerning the\ndistribution of these properties. We should preserve the maximum\nfreedom in the construction of interpretative hypotheses by assuming\nthat all possible combinations of these properties could be exhibited\nin one and the same thing, and that anything might be deficient in\none or more of these types of property. In point of fact most theories\nare constructed on the assumption that the possible combinations\nare more limited than this. Partly on a priori grounds, and partly\non empirical grounds it is most generally assumed that some pairs of\nproperties are invariably disjoined and others invariably conjoined.\nIt has, for example, been very generally assumed, since the time\nof Descartes at any rate, that nothing combines material and mental\ncharacteristics, from which it follows that the cycle with which we\nare concerned is one which involves some purely material things\nand some purely mental things in causal, quasi-causal, pseudo-causal\nor some other more mysterious relation. Personally, I consider this\nto be extremely dubious, and am more favourably disposed toward\nsome of the recent theories according to which the things we are\nconcerned with may possess both or neither of the types of characters\nwhich are defined respectively as material and mental. But since I\nam concerned to formulate an account of the normal sequence of\nresponse to stimulation so far as may be in terms acceptable to\nreflective common sense and the most widely current opinions of the\nday\u2014and not in terms of special philosophical theories\u2014I provision-\nally lay down that we are concerned with a set of substances some\nof which are assumed to have material properties but not assumed to\nhave mental properties, and others of which are assumed to have\nmental properties but not assumed to have material properties. I\nneed not assume, however, that nothing has neither.\nRegarding the distinction between primary and secondary\nproperties^\u2014which I shall assume to be equivalent to the distinction\nbetween spatio-temporal and other relational properties on the one\nhand and qualities in the narrower sense of this term on the other\u2014\nI shall assume that for ordinary scientific pimposes we shall need to\nrefer only to the primary properties of material things, but that in\nthe analysis of the ])sychological phases of the process secondary\nproperties will enter into our descriptions.\nAccordingly, the structural basis of the response to stimulation\n\f151 ]\nand the Structure of the Mind 289\nwill be constituted by, firstly, a set of discrete material things\npossessing characteristic internal states and standing to one another\nin certain spatial relations and connected with one another by\ncertain media, which media may be conceived to be continuous (hke\na jelly) or made up of a compact mass of smaller particular discrete\nsubstances (hke a bag of lead shot), and, secondly, by a set of mental\nsubstances or individual minds. The latter, unlike the material\nsubstances, are not spatially adjoined, except indirectly or in a\nspecial sense through their relations to bodies, nor are they, on\nordinary views, connected by a mental medium picturable as a\njelly or as a bag of shot. There are, however, reasons for supposing\nthat what is commonly regarded as a single discrete individual\nmind either is itself, or is part of, a collection of minds, one member\nof which collection is the central conscious being we introspect, the\nothers constituting secondary or subconscious personalities, or, on\ncertain views, a set of subordinate \u201c monads \u201d. But whether we\nare concerned with the central conscious self or with any particular\nsubordinate personahty or monad, it is assumed that this self is\nhnked throughout life to a material body or some part of such body.\nCommonly the mode of hnkage is conceived to be something sui\ngeneris. It is unlike the mode of hnkage exhibited by the material\nparts of a material thing ;\nit is unhke the mode of linkage which\nholds between two properties of the same thing. That is to say, it is\nneither any sort of cohesion or spatial adjunction, nor any sort of\nco-characterization\nWithin certain hmits we can conceive the total system constituted\nby a set of material things, some of which are hnked with minds, as\nbeing at rest, i.e. as maintaining the same unchanging states\nthroughout a period of time. We can do this more easily for the\nmaterial part of the system. We can picture a potentially stimidat-\ning object remaining at a constant temperature and we can picture\nthe material media, through which a change of temperature might\nbe communicated, as xmdisturbed\u2014at least we can do this so long\nas we conceive the state of affairs in common-sense qualitative\nterms.\nBut even at the unsophisticated common-sense level we encounter\ndifficulties when we try similarly to picture the psychological part\nof the system as at rest. The difficulty of maintaining even for a\nmoment or two a hterally and strictly unchanging mental state\ndisposes common sense readily to accept such statements as that\n\u201c all consciousness is consciousness of change \u201d or that \u201c all con-\nsciousness is changes of consciousness \u201d. We can evade these\ndifficulties for the moment by thinking of a temporal cross section\n\f290 Supernormal Faculty [part\nof the state of affairs or of the state of affairs in the whole system at\na certain time. This yields us the picture of the structure of the\nsystem as a whole\u2014a picture of certain material things in certain\npositions and in certain states, of certain minds presented with\ncertain sensory data and images and further characterized by feehngs\nand desires, and with their bodies ready for the reception of further\nstimuli and prepared for the execution of a suitable response.\nLet us next consider certain general features of the causal process\nwhen the machinery begins to work. In the simplest case the cycle\nof events is initiated by a change in one object which operates on\nthe remote stimulus, say a change consisting in a specific type of\noscillation in the particles of this object\u2014an oscillation which is\nprecisely defined by specifying such variables as the amplitude and\nrate of movement. This change or some other more or less similar\nchange is then taken up by an adjacent member of the system, the\nsame or a similar change is taken up by another member adjacent\nto the second, and so a series of corresponding changes is propagated\nthrough the system as a whole.\nThe expression \u201c this change or some other more or less similar\nchange \u201d draws attention to a general character of the causal nexus\nwhich requires some discussion. The parallelism of events character-\nistic of communication, whether normal or supernormal, arises in\nvirtue of the fact that effects resemble their causes in certain\nrespects. Several historical controversies have been concerned with\nthe kind and degree of similarity which holds between cause and\neffect. The truth of the matter I believe to be that effects are both\nsimilar and different from their causes. They are similar in certain\nrespects and they differ in certain respects. Clarity requires that\nwe should endeavour to specify the respects in which they are\nsimilar and the respects in which they differ, and the circumstances\nunder which similarity and difference will themselves differ in degree\nand kind.\nThat some special kind of similarity holds between events causally\nconnected follows, I believe, from the definition of causality or from\nthe criteria by which we distinguish causal connection from coin-\ncidence. We assert causal connection with greatest assurance on\nthe basis of observing concomitant variations. But the vague\nphrase \u201c concomitant variations \u201d covers two things, first the spatio-\ntemporal or other type of adjunction between the events, and second\nsome similarity of form or parallehsm between two series of changes.\nThis similarity or parallehsm varies in degree. The limiting case\nof exact similarity in all respects is one to which a pair of occurrences\napproximate under certain special conditions. The closest approxi-\n\f151 ]\nand the Structure of the Mind 291\nmation is found when the substance in which the effect is produced\nis exactly similar in internal constitution and closely adjacent to\nthat in which the causal event occurs i.e. in the case of conduction\nthrough a homogeneous medium. Difference between cause and\neffect arises where there is spatial separation or difference in internal\nconstitution between the things to which the events happen.\nIn conduction through a homogeneous medium, where difference\nis only difference in spatial position, the effect will resemble the\ncause in proportion to the proximity of the \u201c patient \u201d to the\n\u201c agent \u201d, and the greater the distance between them the greater\nthe difference between the two events. Commonly the precise\ncharacter of both the differences and the similarities will be defined\nby a specific formula\u2014such as a law of inverse squares. WTien the\ncausal process consists in the transference of some change from an\nagent of one type of internal constitution to a \u201c patient \u201d of a\ndifferent type of constitution other differences will be superimposed.\nHere, too, in simple cases, the character of the transformation can\nbe precisely defined\u2014as when, for example, the character of the\neffect can be referred to the curvature of a mirror or lens, or to the\nrefractive index, the density or the elasticity of a transmitting\nmedium. Very small differences in internal constitution are suffi-\ncient to make the differences between cause and effect much more\nprominent than their similarities. But even in extreme cases some\nsimilarities may be found. In fact, it is by reason of their detection\nthat causal relations are discerned.\nA critical case is that in which, on traditional assumptions, the\nphysical and physiological cycle produces changes in the mind.\nElectromagnetic oscillations being followed by certain corresponding\nchanges in the cerebro-retinal apparatus of sight are in turn fol-\nlowed by the appearance to the percipient of a flash of coloured\nfight. On the traditional assumptions, within the framework of\nwhich we are endeavouring to conceive the process, the second\ntransition like the first is causal in nature. On any view this second\ntransition contains much that is peculiar and mysterious. I want\nto emphasize this point because the admitted mystery in normal\npsychology may turn out to be bound up with some of the mysteries\nof psychical research. For one thing, there is on any view some-\nthing peculiar about the spatio-temporal nexus. In the purely\nphysical phases of the process spatial continuity is finked with\ntemporal continuity, so that events proximate in time are proximate\nin space, and events relatively remote in the temporal order are also\nrelatively remote in the spatial order too. Now what leads us to\nassign the emergence of a visual sensory datum to a definite position\n\f292 Supernormal Faculty [part\nin the causal series is the fact that it can be given a fairly definite\nposition in the temporal series. We assign it to the moment at which\nthe physiological conductive-process has reached a certain place in\nthe cerebro-retinal apparatus. On the analogy with normal physical\ncausation the unsophisticated may accordingly be so misled as to\nlink spatial with temporal proximity by saying that the sensory\ndatum has its being inside one\u2019s head. The less unsophisticated,\nseeing the objections to this, are content to say that the datum is in\none\u2019s mind, or more guardedly still, in the presentational or pheno-\nmenal field. In addition to the spatio-temporal peculiarities affecting\nthis phase of the process there is a pecuharity with respect to what\nwe may call the substantival factors in the causal process. It is\nadmitted that variations in the character of the sensory datum are\nso finked with variations in the stimuli as to suggest causal connec-\ntion. Clearly, however, these variations are not explained by the\nstimuli alone, nor by the stimuli together with the pre-existent\nproperties and states of the body as physically defined. If, therefore,\nwe persist in the endeavour to adhere to the general principles of\ncausal explanation we have invoked elsewhere\u2014accounting for a\nchange by reference to an external occurrent factor operating upon\na substantial thing of a certain nature, referring to the latter all that\nis not accounted for by the former we are led to postulate some non-\nphysical substance upon which the stimulus acts and within which or to\nwhich the effect event occurs. That is to say, just as we account for\nthe fact that an electro-magnetic stimulus produces a chemical\nchange in the cerebro-retinal apparatus by reference to the con-\nstitution of that apparatus itself, so we account for the fact that the\nlatter chemical action in the nervous system produces a change of\nsensory experience by postulating something of substantival type,\nthe nature of which contributes to the effect to be explained.\nSometimes the substantival factor has been identified with the mind\nitself and a sensory experience regarded as one of its \u201c states \u201d. A\nvariant of this view is illustrated by the hypothesis of James Ward,\nwho distinguished this substantival factor from the \u201cself\u201d, regarding\nit as a \u201c psychoplasm \u201d analogous in some respects to the plastic\nmaterial of which bodies are composed, but possessing the distinc-\ntive properties required to account for the observed effects. Con-\ntemporary philosophers of many otherwise diverse schools are content\nto describe sensory data as neutral (as between matter and mind)\nand they try to avoid committing themselves to any assertion to the\neffect that sensations are states of any substance whatever. In fact,\nsuch an account would often be explicitly denied. In this they may\nbe right ;\nbut the point I wish here to press is that to make this\n\f151\n]\nand the Structure of the Mind 293\ndenial entails a consequential modification of our views as to the\nkind of causality implied when we speak of our sensory experiences\nas being caused by happenings in the brain. On any ordinary\nview of causafity what happens in the brain can be only a contribu-\ntory causal factor\u2014and some other factor must be postulated on any\nview which is not content to leave the matter wrapped in impene-\ntrable mystery.\nIn point of fact, the circumstances are essentially similar to those\nin consequence of which we postulate dispositions. It is rather\ncurious to observe that whilst factors of substantival type are freely\npostulated in all explanations of normal memory it has not been so\ncommonly or so exphcitly recognized that factors of the same type\nare required for any reasonably complete account of normal sen-\nsation. In neither case is the existence of such a factor to be as-\nserted on grounds of direct observation. In both cases the grounds\nreside in the adoption of certain causal postulates. It is also only\non accoimt of such postulates that we can assert that the contribu-\ntory factor in its intrinsic nature is mental or that it is physical.\nBut I cannot clearly see any well-estabhshed principle which would\njustify either of these assertions. In fact I beheve both views are open\nto serious objections. If this be so, that is, if we are led by general\nconsiderations to postulate such a factor, and further general con-\nsiderations prevent us from asserting it to be mental or physical, we\nare accordingly led to postulate something which is neither mental\nnor physical or which we can, if we are so disposed, picturesquely\ndescribe as belonging to a \u201c third realm of being \u201d. Philosophically\nsuch language is no doubt objectionable, but it has the practical\npsychological advantages of freeing our mind from misleading\nassociations and of conferring a certain plasticity upon the ideas we\nrequire in order to develop some of the much needed hypotheses of\npsychical research. Accordingly without more ado, and subject to\nall the qualifications which the philosophically minded can supply\nfor themselves I shall permit myself in what follows to speak of this\npossible third order of being\u2014referring to it noncommittally as the\nTertium Quid., to signalize the fact that we neither assert it to be\nmental nor assert it to be material\u2014as a factor which seems to be\nrequired both as a contributory cause in the genesis of sensation\nand as a vehicle of dispositions. If I am right, and if the factor is\nrequired at all, it is required for the explanation of normal experience.\nThe question then arises : Granting the existence of this cause factor\ncan it further assist in the construction of any intelligible theory\nconcerning supernormal modes of communication ?\nThe foregoing lines of thought have led us to a general conception\n\f294 Supernormal Faculty [part\nof the causal structure of the world within the framework of which\nwe must try to fit both normal and supernormal types of communica-\ntion. Causahty in general is a source of parallelism between series\nof events. Many examples of parallehsm are afforded in the process\nof reception and in the larger process of response to stimulation.\nThe events in the external transmitting medium parallel events in\nthe originating stimulus object. The events in the cerebral cortex\nare parallel with those in the receptor organs. There is that par-\nticularly interesting parallelism between events in the brain and\nevents in the mind which is assumed by the traditional doctrine of\npsycho-physical parallelism and in the doctrine of \u201c isomorphism\n\u201d\nof the Gestalt psychologists. In general there are as many special\nparallehsms as there are pairs of links in the causal chain involved\nin response to stimulation. Such parallelisms, however, are in\nvarying degrees imperfect. Imperfection in the parallehsm arises\nfrom the attenuation of effects with spatial and temporal distance,\nfrom the discontinuities which issue from the differences in intrinsic\nnature between the components in and to which the cause and\neffect events occur, and it arises in even greater measure in virtue\nof the considerations which inductive logicians have dealt with under\nthe heads of \u201c composition of causes \u201d and the \u201c intermixture of\neffects \u201d. But both the parallelism and the divergence from the\nparallelism are accounted for by three constituent types of mechanism\nin the system, (1) mechanisms whereby parallel similar effects are\nproduced at places different from those at which an agent operates,\n(ii) mechanisms whereby parallel similar effects are produced at\ntimes different from those in which the causal event occurs, and (iii)\nmechanism whereby parallel but dissimilar effects are produced at\nremote places or times. We may designate these mechanisms\nmechanisms of diffusion, mechanisms of retention and mechanisms\nof translation. The conduction of light, sound and electricity under\nsimple conditions illustrate the mechanisms of diffusion. The\npersistence of physical, physiological or mental dispositional\nproperties on all theories of traces and \u201c engrams \u201d illustrate the\nmechanisms of retention. The operation of a proximate stimulus\nupon a receptor and the production of sound by electrical impulses\nillustrate the mechanisms of translation.\nIn virtue of the fact that translation processes are sometimes\nreversible and sometimes cyclical, retranslation may occur, so that\nsimilar effects are produced at remote places and times in spite of\ndissimilarities in the intervening stages of the process. Such pro-\ncesses are illustrated in photography, in mechanical systems for\nreproducing sound, in broadcasting systems, and most notably in\n\f295\n151\n]\nand the Structure of the Mind\nthe normal mechanism whereby ideas in one mind are reproduced\nin another mind.\nAccordingly, we do not need to extend our survey beyond the\nrealm of the normal to realize that the constitution of our world is\nsuch that there is no reason, in principle, why a sequence of events\nat one place and time should not reflect itself in a parallel sequence\nat any other place or time. There is nothing, in principle, to prevent\na sequence of events occurring in Athens two thousand years ago\nbeing reflected in Tooting to-day, if a Tooting historian cares to\nreconstruct the Athenian events in his mind The normal psychology\nof cognition has the appropriate concepts of diffusion, retention and\ntranslation of effects to account for the fact. The parallelism of\nevents, however, is subject to restrictive conditions. Eestrictive\nconditions are imphed no less by supernormal than by normal modes\nof communication. The nature of these restrictive conditions, as\nthey are empirically ascertained, will provide our main sources of\nsuggestion in the construction of detailed hypotheses for psychical\nresearch.\nTelepathy and clairvoyance, both spontaneous and of the kind\nwhich is studied by Mr T}Trell and by Dr Rhine, the occurrence of\napparitions, post-cognitive experiences of the type recorded by Miss\nMoberley and Miss Jourdain, precognition and other modes of super-\nnormal intuition all fall within the scope of the general principles\nwhich govern the parallelism of events. Little as we know as yet\nconcerning any of these things there is ample empirical evidence\nthat they are not of a wholly random character, but are subject to\nrestrictive conditions. What is more interesting is the fact that\nwe can specify to some degree what the restrictive conditions\nare.\nIn telepathic communication of the typical sort\u2014I nearly said\n\u201c of the normal sort\n\u201d\n\u2014there appear to be no restrictive conditions\nwith regard to place. Agent and recipient of the communication\nmay be seated on the same settee, or they may be separated by the\ndiameter of the earth. Nor need one party to the transaction even\nknow where the other may chance to be. Whether there be any\nrestricting conditions of the temporal sort the evidence is not clear,\nbut in the most representative cases approximate simultaneity of\nthe parallel events is generally supposed to hold. The most definite\nevidence of restrictive conditions in these cases pertains to the\nalterable mental states of the agent and recipient and the emotional\nrelations between them. There is also some evidence of the existence\nof restrictive conditions affecting the subject matter of communica-\ntion ;\nbut in this connection there are important differences between\n\f296 Supernormal Faculty [part\nspontaneous and experimental telepathy. The most striking cases\nof the former are cases in which the communication concerns matters\nof emotional significance to one at least of the participants, whereas\nin the majority of experimental studies what is in general transmitted\nis information of no importance to either the participants or, for\nthat matter, to anybody else. Another matter calling for investiga-\ntion is the possibility of restrictive conditions with regard to volition.\nIn normal psychology there is reason for supposing that some powers\nare facilitated by voluntary effort and that others are inhibited by\neffort in accordance with a principle picturesquely formulated by\nCoue as \u201c the law of reversed effort \u201d. It would be of interest to\ninquire whether telepathic communication falls into the latter\ncategory. There are, in short, many specific questions of a psycho-\nlogical nature on which co-operative research on the part of students\nof the normal and students of the supernormal could hardly fail to\nbe to the advantage of both.\nIn the case of hauntings and supernormal cognition of the kind\nrecorded by Miss Moberley and Miss Jourdain, the restrictive\nconditions suggested by a first analysis are of a very different kind,\nand indicate in consequence the operation of an entirely different\nkind of causal mechanism. A survey of representative cases does\nnot encourage the behef that commumcation is restricted to indi-\nviduals of any particular mental type or to individuals in some\npeculiar mental condition, or that it occurs only between agents\nand recipients between whom there is any pre-estabhshed rapport.\nIn the typical \u201c ghost story \u201d emphasis is placed upon the fact that\nthe apparition is presented to normal, matter-of-fact, observers\nobservers very frequently having no acquaintance with or even\nknowledge about the person who is presumed to be manifest in the\nphenomenon. On the other hand, there are very severe restrictions\nof a spatial kind. It is a particular house that is haunted and com-\nmonly a very narrowly restricted region of the house. Spatial\nrestriction, in fact, is very frequently the most strongly emphasized\ncircumstantial detail. The kind of apparition that appears to walk\njust above or just below the level of the floor (in defiance of the\nstructural alterations which have affected the behaviour of normal\npedestrian residents) presents the sort of problem that the psy-\nchologist is only too ready to pass on to someone else. This is a kind\nof restrictive condition which, if it does not suggest any particular\ncausal hypothesis, at least indicates the field in which an hypothesis\nmiist be sought. Whereas telepathy and clairvoyance, and other\nphenomena of the class above distinguished, bristle with problems\nof a psychological nature one\u2019s feeling in these space-restricted\n\f151 ]\nand the Structure of the Mind 297\nphenomena is that they contain something very important with\nwhich the psychologist as such has httle competence to deal.\nPrecognition presents yet another type of problem. Whilst the\ncase is covered by the general description \u201c a parallehsm of events \u201d,\nthe parallehsm is one which does not admit of any plausible causal\nexplanation apart from rather drastic modification either of our\nconcepts of causahty or of our concept of time. No doubt there are\npurely psychological questions to be investigated here, questions\nsimilar to those raised concerning telepathy, but I do not think that\nthese are the central and crucial problems in studies of precognition.\nThe utihty of the normal psychologist to psychical research is\nenhanced in proportion to the degree to which he addresses himself\nto its problem with a full consciousness of the extent to which his\nown special competence is restricted. A good deal can be done in\nthe way of getting clear concerning what is specifically psychological\nin the situation and what must be referred to philosophy or to one\nof the other special sciences.\nReviewing them generally, however, and taking them at their\nface value, empirical observations of the kind with which we are\nconcerned do, I think, point to the probable necessity for the\ndevelopment of our provisional hypothesis of a residual substantival\nfactor which resembles the postulated vehicle of mental dispositions\nin its capacity to produce parallel events after a lapse of time, but\nwhich in its capacity to produce such parallels throughout periods\nof time which transcend the individual life has some, at least, of the\nproperties attributed to an \u201c immortal soul \u201d, and which further\nin its capacity to produce these parallel series in remote localities\nbeyond the range of normal personal influence is analogous to the\n\u201c ether \u201d of unsophisticated physics. It is for these reasons, pre-\nsumably, that untutored popular opinion in its first attempt to\nassimilate the facts of supernormal communication has produced\nthat pecuhar psycho-physical hybrid\u2014the notion of a kind of\n\u201c psychic ether \u201d, which can be vehicle of \u201c thought waves \u201d and\nretain the engrams of emotionally changed events, which later can\nbe ecphorized in ghostly apparitions.\nBefore we shout down this theory in scientific horror let us try\nto define a little more precisely where its error lies. To give it its due\nthis kind of theory has the virtue of concreteness, and I think it is\nan advantage in the earher stages of our science to try to work in\nconcrete, and so far as possible, picturable terms. It is better to be\ncrude than obscure. It is better to employ the pounds, shilhngs and\npence of everyday notions than to try to deal with the more refined\nconceptual currency of higher physics as this currency emerges fresh\n\f298 Supernormal Faculty [part\nfrom the mint. Even in physics common sense preceded Newton\nand Newton came before Einstein. In psychical research we await\nour Newton.\nThe chief defects of the theory of a \u201c psychic ether \u201d he, I think,\nless in its theory of diffusion and retention than in the theory of\ntranslation, and less in the account of how impressions are en-\ngraphically recorded than in its account of how they are later\necphorized ;\nand it is defective not in supposing these events to\noccur, but in providing no suggestion as to the conditions of their\noccurrences.\nPersonally I am of the opinion that we can, with a good scientific\nconscience, postulate the existence of a medium which records\nimpressions of all sorts of patterns of events, and which later or\nelsewhere may produce a corresponding pattern. We need not ask :\nwhat is the intrinsic constitution of this medium ;\nwe need not yet\nask how it does it. The postulated medium, in fact, needs only to\nbe endowed with the one virtue expected of all hypothetical entities\n\u2014the virtue of doing exactly what it is told. In order to be non-\ncommittal in respect of what is unimportant I have labelled our\nhypothetical medium the Tertium Quid, and I would if I could be\neven more non-committal still. But, however non-committal we\nmay choose to be we are bound to ask : Under what conditions do\nthese events occur? Under what conditions does this Tertium Quid\nreceive impressions and under what conditions will these impressions\nbe ecphorized or revived.\nLet us, then, construct hypotheses. Let us say, to begin with :\nNo special conditions are required. The medium is such that any\nsort of event will produce its appropriate impression. This hypo-\nthesis may recall to mind a well-known passage in which William\nJames tries to frighten us into good behaviour by an argument\nbased on a highly generalized theory of physiological dispositions.\n\u201c Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice \u201d, he writes, \u201c leaves its\nnever so little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson\u2019s\nplay, excuses himself for each fresh dereliction by saying \u2018\nI won\u2019t\ncount this time \u2019. Well! he may not count it, and a kind Heaven\nmay not count it ;\nbut it is being counted none the less. Down\namong his nerve cells and fibres the molecules are counting it,\nregistering it and storing it up to be used against him when the next\ntemptation comes. Nothing we ever do is, in strict scientific hteral-\nness, wiped out.\u201d\nLet us, then, for the moment throw caution to the winds and\ngo one better than James. Let us suppose that somewhere in our\nTertium Quid everything that happens anywhere or to anything is\n\f151] and the Structure of the Mind 299\nduly recorded. This is an extravagant hypothesis, but I suggest\nthat, while we are about it, we take all we want and more, and return\nlater what we cannot use.\nGiven, accordingly, that all that happens produces its own\nengrain, we ask next ; Under what condition will ecphory occur, i.e.\nunder what conditions will the engram reveal its existence in a\nseries of events parallel to those it records. Suppose we answer\nagain : No special conditions are required. An impression recorded\nat one place or time will express itself, without further conditions\nbeing fulfilled at all other places and all other times. But this, of\ncourse, is demonstrably nonsense. It is to say that, for example,\nany casual sneeze at one place and time will reflect its characteristic\npattern at every other place for all time. We know that it does not.\nOne hypothesis at any rate can be quickly disposed of. Suppose,\nnext, that we go to the other extreme of caution and assert that\nwhilst every event records its imirressions upon the Tertium Quid,\nthe conditions to be realized before ecphory can occur are probably\nso many and so complex that in practice the production of parallel\nevents will hardly ever, if ever, occur. Our caution has led us here\ninto the assertion of another kind of nonsense. What we have\nasserted in one breath we have denied in the next any possibility of\nverification. The existence of engrams is postulated only on the\ngrounds of their manifestation in ecphorized events. To deny the\npossibility of the latter is to deprive ourselves of our sole reason for\nasserting the former. It may be entertaining to think of Nature as\nengaged in writing a very long book not a single word of which will\never be read, but such a hypothesis, however entertaining, has no\nscientific function.\nAny sensible hypothesis must fall somewhere between these two\nextreme suggestions. In all theories concerning engrams, traces or\ndispositions, we have to begin with a choice between certain abstract\npossibilities. We can postulate universal engraphy\u2014within the\nrelevant field\u2014together with restricted or selective ecphory ;\nwe\ncan postulate selective engraphy with universal ecphory or we can\nassume the more complicated case of selective or restricted engraphy\nand selective or restricted ecphory. In the case of memory, for ex-\nample, this third alternative is assumed by common sense i.e. that\nsome, but not all, of the things we perceive produce memory traces,\nand some, but not all, of those traces later admit of revival or recall.\nAn important school of psychologists, on the other hand, favour the\nview of universal retention with selective or restricted revival. It is\nsuggested by these psychologists that every perceptual experience\nis in a sense retained, but that apart from some special technique\n\f300 Su2)ernormal Faculty [part\nof liyjAiosis or psycho-therapy only a restricted portion of these\nmemories can be revived. The third alternative cannot be dismissed\noffhand, viz. that we are restricted in respect of what the memory\ncan assimilate, but what it can assimilate it can in principle revive.\nBut whichever hypothesis we choose to adopt we begin to mean busi-\nness with this hy]iothesis when, and only when, we attempt to\nspecify the principles of restriction or selection. So, too, we shall\nIjegin to mean business with our hypothesis of the Tertium Quid\nwhen we commence to formidate the specific conditions by which the\nsupernormal parallelism of events is in some measure restricted.\nThe point I wish to stress is that between the two extreme and\nabsurd hypotheses to which I have referred there are already some\nfairly well-defined and generally accepted hypotheses of intermediate\nand restricted type designed to account for facts regarded as normal.\nTo modify these hypotheses to cover the supernormal does not\ninvolve any very fundamental question of principle. We can extend\nthe range of application of these hypotheses by removing specific\nrestrictions. This logically and methodologically is a matter of\ndetail ;\nand the removal of the restrictions can be carried out by a\npiecemeal, step by step, procedure.\nWe may start, for example, from some such formulation as we find\nin the hypotheses of Richard Semon, whose grotesqiie but useful\nterminology I have already drawn upon. This hypothesis is formu-\nlated in two principal laws. The law of Engraphy reads :\n\u201c All sim-\nultaneoTis excitements in an organism form a connected simultaneous\nexcitement complex, which, as such, works engraphically, i.e. leaves\nbehind a connected engrain complex which in so far forms a whole.\u201d\nThe Law of Ecphory reads ;\n\u201c The partial return of the energetic\nsituation which formerly worked engraphically operates ecphorically\non a simultaneous engrain complex.\u201d\nThis, as it stands, states the hypothesis in a form required for\nmnemic facts as described in ] physiological and biological terms. If\nwe wish to describe ^psychological processes the laws may be restated\nin terms which are a^pproximately equivalent to the traditional laws\nof association. But, in either case, the laws are restricted in their\napphcation to occurrences in one and the same individual organism or\nmind. If, however, we are impressed by the evidence which writers\nsuch as Jung adduce for supposing that ideas or impressions elabor-\nated in primitive minds may be reinstated in later generations, we\ncan formulate a doctrine of the \u201c collective unconscious \u201d in a form\nwhich makes this simply a modification of Semon\u2019s hypothesis. We\nremove the restriction to one individual and suppose that an en-\ngraphic record in one person may be ecphorized in a lineal descendant.\n\f151 ]\nand the Structure of the Mind 301\nWhat degrees of kinship are allowed would be, of course, a matter\nfor empirical research. I do not in the least wish to commit myself\nto any such hypothesis. My point is merely that it is open to no\nobjection in principle. It is one that could be established by certain\nkinds of empirical fact.\nContinuing step by step we could, if the facts supported us,\nprogressively relax our conditions, extending the range of kinship\nallowed. A more radical but still, in principle, legitimate extension\nof the hypothesis could be made so as to bring 'within its scope facts\nof the telepathic type. In Semon\u2019s hyjjothesis an engraphic record\nis ecphorized at a different time in the same person, or (in a sense) in\nthe same place. A more general principle might be suggested which\nwould allow also an engraphic record to be \u201c ecphorized \u201d at the\nsame time but in a different place. Such a principle would be very\nsimilar to certain principles which are in fact suggested in the\nformulae of Gestalt psychology. The general assertion that a change\nin one part of the ])henomenal field involves a reorganization of the\nfield as a whole opens the possibility of certain types of simultaneous\nparallelism in virtue of which we can say that the events in one\nplace may be reflected in a different place. Such laws are in\ngeneral expressed in purely phenomenological terms and they are,\nof course, restricted to \u201c places \u201d within the presentational field of\none and the same individual. But they might be restated in a form\nuivolving a specific reference to what I have called the \u201c substan-\ntival factor \u201d required in the complete theory of presentation, and\n5ve might here, as elsewhere, suppose this substantival factor to be\nidentical with that which serves as the vehicle of temporal dis-\npositions.\nFrom this point we could again proceed step by step to remove\nspecific restrictions. If we remove the restriction to the single\nindividual or organi.sm, we then have the hypothesis that an excite-\nment affecting the substantival factor in one individual may be\nsimultaneously ecphorized (in a generalized sense of \u201c ecphory \u201d) in\nanother individual. If we remove our restrictions gradually by\nreference to degrees of kinship then, quite in its early stages of its\nextension, our hypothesis would appear to cover the queer facts\nrecorded by Galton concerning the coincident thoughts of twins,\nand it would accord well with the facts which have been recorded\nconcerning the greater frequency of telepathic communication\nbetween close blood relations.\nAll hypotheses of this type amount to saying, in more concrete\npicturable terms, that whilst actual exjDeriences are private and\nrestricted to individual minds, what I have called the Tertium Quid\n\f302 Supernormal Faculty [part 151\nor the vehicle of dispositions is something that is individualized in\nother ways. Such dispositional factors on these hypotheses are in\nsome measure shared.\nI need hardly say that I attach no special importance to any of\nthe particular hypotheses to which I have referred. My aim rather\nhas been to suggest a certain general schema of possibilities within\nwhich such hypotheses will fall, and to suggest a general procedure\nwhereby hypotheses may be framed and modified. In every case,\nthe line of advance will be suggested by directing attention to restric-\ntive conditions. I have mentioned in passing some of the types of\nrestriction which the records seem to indicate, and it would be pos-\nsible to mention many more. Most of these can be empirically\ntested, and here I think is one well-defined field of co-operative\nresearch for psychologists of the normal and students of psychical\nresearch.\n\fFORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nPeofbssor Henry Sedgwick - 1882-84.\nProfessor Balfour Stewart,F.B.S. 1885-87\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick - 1888-92.\nThe Earl of Balfour, K.G., O.M. 1893.\nProfessor William James - - 1894-95.\nSm W'lLLiAM Crookes, O.M. , F.B.S. 1896-99.\nFrederic W.
