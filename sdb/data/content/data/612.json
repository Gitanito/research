He died\nin hospital on November 13th 1926, at the age of 20 in\nconsequence of an accident on the previous day, his motor\ncycle havmg collided with a motor car. I did not know him,\nbut as the value of the evidence largely depends on things\nof which I had no conscious knowledge said to me by Mrs.\nGarrett's control \" Uvani \" on November 8th 1927 and by\nMrs. Leonard's control \" Feda \" on January 7th 1928, at sitt-\nings when I was the only sitter, it is important that, before\ndescribing these sittings, I should make clear what my con-\nnexion with his family and my knowledge of facts concerning\nhim amounted to. To an important extent the evidence\nto which I wish to call attention centres round those two\nsittings and depends, hke much of that in The Bridge,'^ on\nthe fact that a number of true statements communicated\ncannot have been derived from the sitter's conscious mind.\nMy first introduction to Tony Burman's people came\nthrough a friend of theirs, a Mrs. X. living in Birmingham,\nwho wrote to me on September 7th 1926, saying that friends\nwere going to try to get a httle circle together to sit\nregularly on Sunday evenings, and asking whether I knew\nof anyone who could help. I had already, since 1925, been\nin occasional correspondence with Mrs. X. owing to the fact\nthat she was enquiring into psychic matters, and I thought\n1 Miss Nea Walker's book of that name. Ed.\n\f2 Nea Walker. [part\nthat the circle must be in her own family. But her next\nletter indicated that the circle was to be at Mrs. Burman's\nhouse. I did not know Mrs. Burnian at all, except by sight.\nI knew her by sight because I had seen her act (under her\ntheatrical name of \" Isabel Thornton,\") at the Repertory\nTheatre. Of her family I knew nothing at all, although I had\nonce, as long ago as 1918, seen her sister. Miss Mabel France,\non business quite unconnected with psychic matters. Mrs.\nX.'s third letter, written on September 27th 1926, written, it\nshould be observed, more than six weeks before Tony Burman\ndied, contained the following remarks on this subject :\nExtract from Mrs. X.'s letter.\nI have sat several times lately with the Circle I mentioned\n\u2014\nit consists of :\nMabel France,\nTony Burman (a boy of about 20),\nSometimes Mrs. Harry Burman {i.e. Isabel Thornton), and\nsometimes her husband.\nWe usually get short messages on the Ouija Board, and also\nthe table raps out messages.\nThe other night it demanded that \" Steve \" [Tony's brother]\nwho usually takes notes should come to the table, and we then\ngot messages regarding his football playing from a man who\nsaid he had been a football Blue at Cambridge.\nHe gave a name none of us recognised, and subsequently\nanother name of a school-fellow of Steve's who had been\nkilled a year or two ago in a motor accident but who was not\na great footballer : we felt it rather puzzling.\nA great many names were spelt out of people who wanted\nto send messages last night, but we could get no clue as to\nwho they were. . . . We did not get much in the way of a\n'\nmessage '\nlast night as someone, whom no one knows, called\n\"Geoff\" plagued us to sit holding hands and let him speak\nthrough a trumpet.\nWe sat and sat, and the trumpet waved wildly i\nand hit our\nheads, but we could only get a faint tapping inside it, no voice. . . .\n^ The trumpet did not, I learn, leave the table ; it was a gramophone\nloud speaker set up on the narrow end, hitting the sitters as it swayed,\nbut not leaving the table.\n\f112] Tlie Tony Burman Case. 3\nA further letter, October 13th 1926, indicated that the\ncircle was in difficulties, getting messages purporting to\nbe evidential which turned out incorrect upon enquiry.\nMrs. X. then said,\n\u2014\nThe Burmans asked me to ask you whether, as you have\nexperience, you would ever be willing to come to their house\nand \" sit \" one evening 1 We thought you might be able to\ngive lis some help.\nBeing interested in the account of the trumpet, which\nwas said to have moved independently and to have\nyielded taps although not voices,\u2014these I was amused to\nfind the circle expecting immediately,\u2014I was keen to see\nfor myself what happened ; so I replied that, though I\nwas not an expert on physical phenomena and did not\nwish them to think so, I should like to go presently\u2014at\nthe time I was just recovering from an illness.\nI next heard from Mrs. X. on Nov. 14th 1926 giving a\nshort report on an anonymous Leonard sitting which she\nhad had. In the course of the letter she said, in reference\nto a communicator :\nMy husband's brother ^ was very clearly described. He it\nwas who came first to the Burman's circle table -tilting. Their\nname was tried by Feda\u2014at least it seemed to us she meant\nthem. 2 But we have just had a great grief. Tony, the\nBurman's son, who had certainly very great psychic gifts, had\nan accident on his motor bicycle on Friday and died yesterday.\nWe were so fond of him, especially my husband. Such a dear\njolly boy. It seems, in a way, as if God had been tempering\nthe wind to them a bit by starting him and his Mother in this\ninterest in The Beyond. But we shall not be able to do much\nin the circle without him I think.\n' I learn that Mrs. X.'s brother-in-law, though dead many years, had,\nwhen alive, been a close friend of Mrs. Burman.\n^Mr. and Mrs. X.'s anonymous Leonard siiting. 11th Nov. 1926:\n\" He [apparently the brother referred to above] says there is a brud\n\u2014\npause\u2014he has used up the power. Name starting BR\u2014he is trying to\nmake a cross-correspondence. B, R, and 7 or 8 letters\u2014M. No, not\nenough power left\u2014you will hoar something which will make you\nunderstand. He is going to have an opportunity soon of speaking again,\nnot here, but under other conditions.\"\n\f4 Nea Walker. [part\nAnd so it happened that I never met Tony Burman\nwhen ahve here, nor did I ever join the Burman family\ncircle. I replied asking Mrs. X. to tell Mrs. Burman, that\nif she wanted my help it was at her service. My only\nother step was to write to the D.W. Group\n\u2014\ni.e. the group\nof supposed spirits communicating through my sister\nDamaris\u2014on November 15th 1926, and to ask for the help\nof one of them\u2014Bunny\u2014for Tony Burman, if he needed\nany ; I asked for Bunny's help as I knew that Bunny had\na link with people known to the Burmans which might, if\nsuch things mattered, make it easier.\nIn another letter on November 20th 1926, Mrs. X. wrote :\nMrs. Burman was at a seance at Mrs. Garrett's on the very\nday the boy had his smash, and the medium there said some-\nthing which now looks like foreknowledge. She [also] described\nmost accurately the friend who is said to have '\nlent his\npower '\nto operate the Ouija Board. [At the private sittings.]\nAfter this Mrs. X. went abroad for several months and\nI heard no more from her in connexion with the present\ncase. Details of this sitting of Mrs. Burman's with Mrs.\nGarrett I did not hear till much later. I heard them in\nconversation with Mrs. Burman, and afterwards, in a\nletter dated April 17th 1928, she wrote :\nAs you know I took no notes, but so far as I remember the\nexact words used by Uvani [Mrs. Garrett's control] were '\nI\nsee with you, Madame, your littlest son, there is some trouble\nbut he wants to say don't worry.' Stupidly, the word\n\"littlest\" put me of\u00a5, and I said I had no \"little son.\" But\nit might quite well have been Uvani's way of saying \" young-\nest.\" I said I could not place it at all, my sons were both\nwell, and in no trouble, so he [Uvani] said,\n\u2014' We will leave\nit then, Madame, but I think I am right.' . . . The sitting\nwas from 3.30 p.m. till about 4.45. Tony's accident took place\nat 2.30, and the message relating to him was given by Uvani\ntowards the end of the sitting. I did not get to the theatre\ntill about 8.30 i).m. when I found Steve's wire.\nThe coincidence was certainly a remarkable one. It is\nof course unfortunate that no notes were kept, but it may\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 5\nbe mentioned in corroboration (besides Mrs. X.'s letter\nquoted above) that Miss France remembers clearly tliat on\nreaching home in response to the telegram, Mrs. Burnian's\nfirst words were,\u2014 I've been told about this.\"\nThis striking success of Mrs. Garrett's was doubtless the\nreason of further experiments with her by Tony's family.\nThey had sittings on December 17th 1926, April 16th 1927,\nand November 17th 1927\u2014this last being after my own\nsitting. Miss Mabel France, Mrs. Burman's sister, was\npresent on all these occasions and she was accompanied\nby Mr. Stephen Burman on the first, by another sister on\nthe second, and by Mrs. Burman on the third. There\nwere some good points given at all three. I do not,\nhowever, propose to deal in this paper with the evidence\nthey afford, though I shall have to refer to them again\npresently. All the three sittings were held at The British\nCollege for Psychic Science, whereas my own was at The\nLondon Spiritualist Alliance rooms, and there seems no\nreason why Mrs. Garrett should have connected me (I sat\nanonymously) with any of Tony's friends or relatives.\nAs the Burman family were accustomed to having sit-\ntings at home in Tony's life-time, their first attempts to\nreach him were naturally made there, sometimes with a\ntable, sometimes with an Ouija Board. Careful records\nwere kept of these sittings, and I have now (May 1928)\nhad the opportunity of reading through the book. There\nis nothing evidential in the strict sense, but I was struck\nby the feehng one got that it was the same personality\nwhenever Tony Burman purported to communicate, and I\nhave placed in the full Report ^ of the Case a few ex-\ntracts. Whatever the value, or otherwise, of such domestic\nefforts at communication without strong mediums, they\nseem to me, in many cases I know of, to have the effect\nof making it comparatively easy for those left on earth\nto reach the minds of such as Tony Burman and to direct\nthem to come, for example, to some stranger like myself\nand to give evidence of survival, even through a medium\nstrange to the communicator. In the present case one\nshould probably also bear in mind the fact that the boy\n1 Filed with the S.P.R., but not pubhslied.\n\f6 Nea Walker. [PABT\nhimself had a i^sychic faculty when alive and had been\nkeenly interested in his own experiments then.\nOther attemj)ts to get into touch with Tonj^ were made\nthrough the automatic writing cf his aunt, Miss Mabel\nFrance. She had begun writing automatically after some\nconversation on the subject on September 29th 1926, that\nis, about six weeks before Tony's death, and continued it\nafterwards. I have recently (May 1928) been allowed to\nread her script from beginning to end.\nThere is a good deal of it, and perhaps nothing eviden-\ntial, though there were one of two small tests which\nproved correct. Once more the value seems to lie in the\nchannel which helped with the later sittings with professional\nmediums ; and also in creating in the minds of some of the\nsurviving relatives a sense of the boy's nearness.\nSo far as I could judge, the personality purporting to\nbe Tony Burman seemed very like the Tony B. which\ncommmiicated through the Burman Ouija and Table Circle.\nHe also seemed consistently like himself all through Miss\nFrance's attempts at automatic writing.\nA feature of the script was that each time I was taking\na sitting, the \" writing \" seemed to show a dim knowledge\nof the event. And, a few days before I sent this report\nto the Burmans to examine\u2014quite unexpectedly as far as\nthey were concerned\u2014Miss France says she had a long\ncommunication from Tony Burman, telling her it was\ncoming, and a good deal about it. Unfortunately she was\nfeeling disgusted with the quality of her faculty, and tore\nup these last scripts before my packet arrived.\nAs regards my own knowledge of the Burman family, it\nwill of course occur to the reader that I must have seen\naccounts of the accident and inquest in the newsjiapers.\nAs a matter of fact I do not think I did see them, but\nif I did, the one thing apart from the accident which I\nshould have learnt was Tony Burman's profession\u2014that of\na mechanical engineer. I certainly, however, had no con-\nscious knowledge of this when I sat with Mrs. Garrett or\nwith Mrs. Leonard.^\n1 I liavo collected some newspaper accounts and filed them with the\nfuller documents concerning the case whicli I shall lodge at the S.P.R.\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 7\nMy first direct communication with Mrs. Burman arose\nfrom her reading my book \" The Bridge \" pubhshed in\nSeptember 1927. She wrote congratulating me upon it,\nbut from her letter I need for the j^urpose of this paper\nonly quote the following :\nMy only slight introduction to you was through Mrs. X. of\nwhen you veiy kindly told me, through her, of Mrs.\nGarrett, the trance medium at the Psychic College m London.\nAnd now to the purpose of this letter. I have just finished\nreading your engrossing book \" The Bridge \"...\nShe then went on to enquire as to the identity of one\nof the members of the D.W. Group (my sister Damaris'\ngroup of communicators), \" Geoff,\" since at her table\nsittings she had had a communicator of that name. But,\nas \"GeofE\" of the D.W. Group in '\"The Bridge\" was a\npseudonym, that enquiry led nowhere.\nMeanwhile, her sister. Miss Mabel France, had written to\nme, on October 22nd 1927, also expressing interest in \" The\nBridge,\" and asking me if I could help her to get some\nmessage, through Miss Bazett, for the Burmans, in time\nfor the anniversary of Tony Burman's death, of which she\ngave me the date for Miss Bazett's use, together with his\nfull name. Miss Bazett kindly made three attempts with\nno sitter connected with Tony present, but the results\nwere not considered good, and I only mention them\nbecause, in commenting. Miss France wrote the letter from\nwhich I quote below, and the mention of Alpine Climbing\nin it gave me a point about Tony of which I was ignorant\nbefore.^\nExtract from a letter from Miss France.\nOn the whole, I am inclined to think that it was Tony who\nwas trying to get through, but I do not consider that the\nevidence is good. Perhaps I am expecting too much. The\nrooms, in ease any student cares to consult them. I shall give here all\nthe information I think really imijortant.\n1 While writing this report I have read the annotated records of these\nsittings again and do not think they gave me any other information.\nMrs. Sidgwick, who also read them, agrees in this.\n\f8 Nea Walker. [part\nonly real points that he got through were the hint of his\naccident, the question that he is always trying to get tests\nthrough, and his sympathy.\nThe reference to ice was most interesting.\nThe one thing that absorbed him was Alpine Climbing.\nHe talked and thought of little else, especially during the\nlast year of his life ; but Miss Bazett seems to make it clear\nthat this [reference] is only to give relative significance to\nsomething which I cannot trace.\nFinding that Miss France had not, throngh Miss Bazett,\nachieved anything which she thought likely to be helpful\nfor the anniversary, and having myself been offered a free\nanonymous sitting with Mrs. Garrett by the Council of the\nLondon Spiritualist Alliance I decided to use it for the\npurpose of trying to get something for Mrs. Burman. My\npersonal reason for choosing this case in preference to any\nother was that I had seen Mrs. Burman act soon after\nher boy was killed ;\nand, knowing her by sight, had\nobserved her going about with no outward signs of grief\nand depression, and had greatly admired her pluck. Also,\nhaving been indirectly interested in Tony Burman's own\npsychic experiments when he was alive here, I had an\ninterest in him. So I thought that all this would .\nprobably\ncount for something in achieving success, and perhaps\njustify an experiment rather difficult for a first sitting.\nBefore I go on to describe this sitting which took place\non November 8th 1927, I must explain that though before\nOctober 31st 1927 I had seen no records of the sittings\nwhich the Burman family had had with Mrs. Garrett nor\nheard any details about them, I had learnt from Miss\nFrance's correspondence with me d propos of Miss Bazett\nthat, on April 16tli 1927,\u2014their second sitting with Mrs.\nGarrett\u2014Tony had seemed to communicate ; and so I\nwrote a note to Miss France, on October 31st 1927, asking\nher just to tell me \" whether the boy [Tony] had come\nthrough Mrs. Garrett by name,'\" since I had been \" offered\na sitting with her, meant to try her when in London, and\nthought perhaps I might see what luck I had in trying\nto get anything about '\nTony.'\n\"\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 9\nI asked her to tell Tony, and said that I had tried to\ntell my folk \" over there.\" I also asked her not to give\nme information, but, if there were a name which might\nexplain Tony to the control, to tell me that. Unfor-\ntunately, instead of doing so, she sent me a copy of the\nsitting in question. The correct points were only indicated\nin the margin.^ I had no time to read it and take it in, I\nmerely glanced down the pages to see whether the name\nTony occurred, and found it. So I put the sitting away\nand did not study it until after April 1928. But this\ncomplicates my work in presenting the material consider-\nably, for I have to take that sitting into account, since I\ndo not know what information my subsconscious mind\nmanaged to acquire in skimming down the pages to see\nif the name occurred. I can only say, truly, that the\nglance which I gave the record was extremely hasty. I\nlooked for the name, found it, and left it at that. I do\nnot myself think that there is much in my sitting which\nis directly derived from a glance at Miss France's. The\nbest material certainly is not. But in the fuller account\nalready mentioned there is the report, as I saw it, and\nanyone disposed to read that can judge for himself.\nMiss France thus knew from October 31st that I was to\nhave the sitting and try the experiment. And she also\nknew that I was going away from home on November 3rd\nfor a week. She may therefore have guessed that the\nsitting would take place during that week though she did\nnot know the day. I had avoided letting other members\nof the family know about the experiment as I feared it\nmight prove a complete failure.\nA sitting with a fresh medium, unaccustomed to oneself\nand to one's communicators, is of course always rather\nconfusing, and everyone concerned is at a disadvantage.\nThis I think should be remembered in comparing the result\nof this sitting with that of the sitting which I took later\nwith Mrs. Leonard.\nThe sitting was anonymous as far as Mrs. Garrett\nwas concerned ; if I had previously had any doubts as\n^ The annotated record of tliis sitting was first sent to me on October 5th\n1928. N. W.\n\f10 Nea Walker. [part\nto whether she knew me, and in fact I had none,\u2014the\ninternal evidence of the sitting clearly shows that she\ndid not know me. I had never before seen Mrs. Garrett,\nthongh I had heard reports of her which were good on\nthe whole. Her manner is dignified, and she did not\ntalk to me either before or after the sitting. She sits\nin broad daylight or electric light. There is no fuss,\nand the \" trance \" comes on quickly and easily, taking,\nin this particular case, just five minutes. The control\nis supposed to be an Arabian, Uvani by name.\nReport of Sittings with Mrs. Garrett\nFor the convenience of readers I will here give a list of\nthe best points of evidence in this sitting :\nPAGE\n1.

I should\nlike to say here that I have had very considerable help\nfrom the Rurmans as annotators. If they will allow me\nto say so, I found them most kind, very sensible, and not\nat all anxious to find Tony when he was only doubtfully\npresent, although they put all the possibilities before me.\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 11\nAfter the above mentioned talk, which may have\nreferred to my people, Uvani went on to describe two\nother people in such a way as to suggest to Mrs. Burman\nwhen she saw my record, her uncle Edwin Jones and her\nfather. Having now discussed the details with her, I can\nsee that the recognition is legitimate. Now, in the\nBurman home circle, these two men, Uncle Edwin Jones,\nand Mrs. Burman's father, Henry Charles, belong more or\nless together. And they have each the same sort of\nrelation to Tony Burman. Both had communicated at\nhome, and Mrs. Burman's father had been well described\nthrough Mrs. Garrett to Miss France and another sister on\nApril 16th 1927.\nAgain, showing that this material perhaps related to the\nBurmans, were given the names, \" May and Marion, on\nthe maternal side.\" It is a fact that Mrs. Burman's name\nis Marion Isabel, commonly called May ; and that her\nmother's name is Marion. So that I feel that the Burmans\nwere reasonable in thinking that this material probably\nreferred to their communicators.\nMeanwhile, just before May and Marion were mentioned,\nbut not before the two men were described, I had asked,\nrather in despair, whether Uvani had \" ever had a boy\ncommunicator called Tony? Did he remember ?\n\" The\nreply was\u2014\" I don't remember. My people come and go.\nStrange I can get so little light\n\"\n\u2014I of course having been\nobliged to say that I could recognise none of these later\ndescriptions.\nThere was then some confusion and apparent return to\nmy own communicators, and then, quite suddenly, the\ncontrol said :\nThere is one over here near him [i.e. apparently near\nthe D.W. Geoff] Anton\u2014Antony. Then he would be\nTony ?\nI replied :\nIt sounds possible. Has Tony any messages for his\nmother ?\nThe supposed Tony at once referred to his mother's\nstate of health, and to worries (see jDp. 13 and 14) ; these\n\f12 Nea Walker. [part\nreferences were understood by the Biirmans, not by me,\nand referred to matters cropping up since the date of the\nlast sitting taken by the Burmans. Uvani then said that\nTony told him that his mother had actually spoken to him\nthrough \" this condition \" twice. Now, I did not then\nknow how many times Tony had communicated, nor to\nwhom. It turned out that Tony had communicated\nthrough Mrs. Garrett twice, but not to his mother ;\nonce\nto two aunts\u2014Ai^ril 1927, and once to the brother and\naunt together, December 1926. His mother and aunt are\nhowever much alike ; and this might link them up nor-\nmally in the mind of the medium.\nTony then referred to a \" Hilda \" and to his sister ; it\nalmost sounded as if Hilda ivere his sister. I learnt,\nafterwards, that Hilda was a favourite cousin, and a great\nfriend of his sister. This Hilda, I find, had been referred to\n(in connexion with a small evidential point) at the Garrett\nsitting attended by Tony's brother and his aunt\u2014namely\nthe one through which I had glanced, 'Mwannotated, to see\nif the name Tony would help the control if \/ used it.\nDiscounting references to the accident, which went no\nfurther than my knowledge, there were afterwards the\nfollowing items of value, i.e. which were unknown to me,\nand also not repetitions from previous Burman-Garrett\nsittings. I quote some of them verbatim with the anno-\ntations supplied later, as this is really the simplest method\nwhere the evidence is clear and not tangled up with\nmaterial belonging to other communicators.\nFuKTHER Extracts from Sitting with Mrs. GXrrett,\nNovember 8th 1927.\nThere was something to do Note by Stejyheyi Burman.\nwith a tablet or a memorial.

And Uvani added\n\u2014\" He tried to send her a\nwarning that all was not well.\" This of course I had\nheard of, see page 4.\nIt is curious that, among these remarks applicable to\nTony Burnian, Uvani refers to someone in the physical\nbody called Humphrey, connected with Tony\u2014just as a\npassing remark. Now I discovered, afte7- the sitting, that\nthree peojile whom I had sent anonymously to Mrs.\nGarrett had \" Tony \" as communicators. Two of these\nwere children ;\nand, one of these children had a living\nbrother, Humphrey. So that this looks rather like the\ncontrol's or medium's memory working. On the other\nhand, when I asked for a Tony, I did not reahse that\nthere were three to choose from who might be connected\nwith me in the medium's mind. How was it that Uvani\nproduced, except for this reference to Humphrey, only\nevidence of the Tony I wanted ?\nA little later in the sitting Tony Burman seems to\nbecome clear again, in a reference to wireless :\nHe tells you to tell her that Note by Stephen Burman.\nhe likes the Avireless in the Tony was very keen on\nhouse, and also the music wireless.\nAnd will you say that, in And, his mother always -works\nthe evening, when sitting in at raffia in a particular corner\nher own particular chair, busy of the sofa while listening to the\nas usual, he is always there, wireless.\nHe listens in with lier. He is\ninterested in long-distance com-\nmunications more than any-\nthing in the world, because he\nhas a theory that . . .\nThere followed some theoretical remarks on the analogy\nbetween wireless and psychic commimication, of no partic-\nular interest. Presently Tony announced that there was\n\" a portrait of him which they used to laugh at, taken\nwith a brother, somewhere in a bedroom now.\" This I\n\f16 [part\nwas told was .-cprrecti- iiac;ludi:ng* 'iikf.' laiigiiing. More details\nas to photographs* Avtem igiyeui: ^Q'-'-fair ; as I can learn,\ncorrect, but rather too much confused for this account.\nThen the communication seemed to improve again, and\nthe following is worth quoting :\nSomebody connected with Tony has an Uncle John,\nthe family, John, an Uncle\nJohn. She will understand\nwho he means.\nIs there an Edith, an Aunt, Note by N. W.\nor somebody in the physical I learnt, in conversation\nbody, Edith, he says\u2014She with Mrs. Burman, that there\nhasn't altered a scrap. is an Edith, not an aunt, but\nof auntdike age in regard to\nTony, who has sat with the\nBurmans.\nNote by Stephen Burman.\nTony had a sister to whom\nhe was devoted.\nWe cannot trace \" a trij)\nabroad.\"\nShe spent her summer holi-\ndays at the seaside.\nDuring this time a very\nexcellent snapshot was taken\nof her\n\u2014\nAt the end of August.\nThere's one sister to whom\nhe's very devoted. They were\ngreat friends. That sister was\nthinking of some trip abroad,\nor over water. I think she\ntook that trip\u2014no, I don't\nthink she went abroad. But\nthere was some thought of it.\nShe went near water. During\nthe time she was near this\nwater, she had a small portrait\ndone which he liked awfully.\nThe beginning of Sej)tember.\nHe had a friend who went\nout during hostilities.\nNote by Stephen Burman.\nNo. [But I am told that\nthe Geoff of the Burman\npsychic group, who thus \" made\nfriends \" with Tony, died so.\nN. W. 14th November 1927.]\nHis Mother is going to some\nkind of remembrance service.\nShe's to remember he will be\nNote by Stephen Btirman.\nQuite correct. For a week\nshe had considered going to\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 17\nthere too, although it's not a the Albert Hall Remembrance\nday for him. , Service on November 11th.\nAssure her he knows she's\nbeen talking about something\nto do with the service.\nAgain the. medium enlarged a little on the question of\n\" a grave or a garden of remembrance,\" and went wrong,\nfor Tony had no grave\u2014his body was cremated, I learn,\nand the ashes scattered. This part seems to be a thought\nroused by the previous references, and, as it did not apply,\nI suspect that the medium's own mind began to take\ncontrol, and that confused recollections of other sittings\nwere consequently introduced. I fancy that this must\noften occur.\nThen Tony Burman disappeared from the sitting almost\nas abruptly as he entered it.\nSubsequently, as already stated, Mrs. Burman and Miss\nFrance had a joint anonymous sitting with Mrs. Garrett,\non 17th November 1927, at the British College. This\nsitting contained only one point unknown to the sitters,\nbut was good as a sitting of the other type. For instance\nTony remarks, characteristically\n\u2014\" Tell the men of the\nfamily that the garden is awful at the moment.\" And\n\" ask Joan [his small sister] about Marjorie ; she's another\nsprat \"\u2014Tony's generic name for Joan and her small\nfriends. And again, referring to his motor cycle :\n\" there's\nnet even the ghastly remains.\"\nAnd also :\nMedium. He was jolly-looking, laughing, tall, full.\nMrs. B. Yes, he was fat.\nMedium. Tony says, '\nI didn't mention the stoutness, so I\nasked the control not to mention it. I was never\nfond of my girth. Thank heaven it's not there\nnow. I'm much more graceful\u2014round\u2014jolly\u2014it's\nmost imkind of you to refer to it.' Everyone\nforgave him his size because he was so jolly. He\nis laughing again.\nB\n\f18 Nea Walker. [part\nI quote the above two small items because they seem\nto me to make Tony \" live \" rather better than he can\nin the sort of evidence with which we are chiefly con-\ncerned.\nIt was in connexion with the annotations to my Garrett\nsitting that I met Mrs. Burman for the first time. She\nand her surviving son Stephen had annotated the sitting,\nbut she wanted to meet me and explain the annotations.\nSo we met, on November 14th 1927, for about three\nquarters of an hour at one of Kunzle's cafes in Birmingham.\nWe talked only of the sitting and of matters directly\nbearing on it, and I saw no other member of her family\nat that time, nor did I go to her home ; I knew where\nit was, but had never been inside.\nI met her again, at the same place, and for the same\nlength of time, about a vv^eek later\u2014after she and her\nsister had had their joint sitting with Mrs. Garrett on\n17th November 1927 (see above) ; for Mrs. Burman wished\nme to see the reference to my attempt through Mrs.\nGarrett on the 8th. In the course of their sitting Tony\nhad remarked that he had\ngot in one morning and been able to send messages, lady\ncommunicator ; didn't get much of her own, but I got\nthrough all right. And you said\n\u2014' I wonder if Tony will\nmention it.'\nThis evidently, I think, referred to my sitting, at the\nLondon Siiirituahst Alhance, on the 8th November\n1927.1\nMrs. Burman also read me the rest of the record of the\nsitting of the 17th November 1927 with comments. There is\nno evidence in it which affects anything I quote out of my\nsubsequent Leonard sitting. Some of tliis Garrett sitting\n1 I am kindly allowed both by the L.S.A. and by the British College to\nsend sitters, anonymously, to Mrs. Garrett at their rooms. I give a note\nsaying that the sitter is a bona fide enquirer ; the sitter presents that, and\nis asked no further questions by anyone.\nMrs. Garrett thus knows that I send sitters to her. But, she could not\nknow me by sight, and therefore could not, when I sat anonymously with\nher, have known that I was the individual who sometimes sent sitters to\nher at these institutions.\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 19\nwas almost a repetition of mine. The one point of real\nevidential value was the following short sentence :\nThere's Billy, a girl, ask Joan, Billy B.\nThis meant nothing to the two sitters until they con-\nsulted Tony's small sister, Joan, aged 10, and discovered\nthat a child whom the sitters knew as Louise Morgan\n(pseudonym) was called, by Joan, Billy. The \" B \" is\nperhaps an addition by the medium\u2014probably due to\nsome other association. Small as it is, this is a good httle\npoint of evidence. It is however open to the objection\nthat either the aunt or the mother may have heard the\nname used without consciously noting it, since they have\naccess to Joan. But their surprise, I think, indicates that\nthis really was not the case. They feel sure of it. At\nany rate they consider it one of the points in the sitting.\nLater in the same month, November 26th 1927, Miss\nFrance (Mrs. Burman's sister) spent a couple of hours in\nmy home as she wished to meet us. It was a first\nmeeting, except for the business appointment many years\nbefore, and the talk was a little on psychic matters\ngenerally, and on general social lines otherwise. No\ninformation about Tony Burman or his family was given\naway to me.\nAfter seeing the annotations on my Garrett sitting, I\nbegan to feel that Tony's efforts might lead to something\ngood which should be helpful to his people, some of whom,\nI learnt, were feehng very sceptical. So after this I\nrefused to see any more of either Mrs. Burman or IVIiss\nFrance, since I planned to try Tony Burman as communi-\ncator at my next Leonard sitting, the date of which I did\nnot tell his family. So far nothing had been given away\nto me, but I feared lest, as we got friendly and conver-\nsation consequently easy, I might learn a good deal.\nI therefore repeat that when I had my Garrett sitting\non November 8th 1927, I had met no one of the family,\nexcept for the brief meeting with Miss France years ago.\nAlso that, by the time I took the Leonard sitting for\nTony Burman, on January 7th 1928, I had had only the\n\f20 Nea Walker. [part\nabove-mentioned three talks with Mrs. Burman and Miss\nFrance.\nReport of a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard\nI now proceed to describe the result of my sitting with\nMrs. Leonard on January 7tli 1928, in the light of the\nannotations supplied by the Burman family. The full\nrecord is filed at the 8.P.R., and I will quote here only\nthe more evidential portions. Unless I state points as\nknown to me, readers can be quite certain that the\nmaterial had no meaning for me nor for the medium.\nBut before summarising, I have a few points to note.\nI had taken a Leonard sitting on December 2nd 1927\nby proxy for someone who was prevented going at the\nlast moment ; at the very end of the sitting I had asked\nthe D.W. Group whether they were \" in touch with a boy\ncalled Tony whom I knoAV, not a child.\" The answer\nwas that they were, and I then asked if they could bring\nhim to my next Leonard sitting. Nothing else was said.\nI specified \" not a child \" purposely, because I knew of\na child of that name and that in October he had\ncommunicated, through Mrs. Leonard, to his mother, and\ntherefore I rather feared confusion. Curiously, the Christian\nname Tony was never mentioned in the course of my\nLeonard sitting, although an attempt was made to give\nTony Burman's surname.\nOnce more the Burmans did not know the date or\ntime of my sitting. I could attach meaning to very\nhttle of what Feda told me ; where I can, I say so. It\nhas been suggested to me that a list of the best points\nmight be helpful to a reader inexperienced in what con-\nstitutes evidence. So I append one. But it must be\nremembered that, although the following points are perhaps\nthe best evidence, they are drawn from a continuous\nwhole, and that many of these points are best read and\nconsidered in their contexts.\nPAGE\n1.

Followed by an attempt at the communicator's\nsmname. This name was known to the sitter\n;\nbut it came in the correct context. And, the\nother name given (No. 3, Roy), was also a\nfamily name, and that too came in a correct\nconnexion and was unknown to the sitter - - 37\nThe sitting begins with the usual preliminary conver-\nsation, greetings, etc., and presently Feda (Mrs. Leonard's\ncontrol), after alluding to a previous communicator,\nspeaks as follows :\n\u2014\nBut there's someone here,\nnot a lady, a man. ... He's\nnot an old man, but like\nsomeone cutted off.\nN. W. Please ask him to\ncome forward and speak to\nme.\nI think he was one of those\nthat went unexpectedly\u2014it's\nas if it had been rather a\nshock to him and to other\npeople too.\nNote hij N. W.\nI knew this was true of\nTony Burman.\n\f22 Nea Walker. [part\nSome rather vague references to his activities just before\nthe accident and to his physical feehngs after it follow,\nand Feda continues :\nBut, Mrs. Nea, I don't think he could really have suffered\nat passing, he had gone unconscious quickly. He wanted me\nvery much to say that. '\nQuickly unconscious,' he keeps on\nsaying.\nOn this, Mr. Stejihen Burman, his brother, who was\nwith him immediately after the accident and until the\nambulance came to remove him to the hospital, comments:\nQuickly is a relative term. He was fully conscious and in\nconsiderable pain for an hour\u2014after which he was given\nmorphia.\nThe assertion therefore that he was quickly unconscious\nand suffered Uttle was not true ;\nbut, curiously enough, he\npersisted in it through all the channels he apparently used\nfor communication. I shall make some remarks on\npossible reasons for this in my final section.\nFeda then continues :\nAnd do you know if he Note by N. W. September 1928.\nwould have had his hand in a Based on information supplied\npeculiar position ?\nbtj the family.\nI have a feeling he would Tony was not unconscious all\nbe holding something, or try- the time in hospital, although\ning to keep hold of something, most of it, and this probably\nI want to keep hold of some- refers to his position lying\nthing, but it is as if my hand there after the accident,\nis in an awkward position. When his mother went on\nThere's something important the morning of the day of his\nabout this. His fingers was death, he spoke a word or\ngripping this, and his thumb two. And she noticed that\nsticking out a bit (indicating he had his right hand up above\nupwards and slightly outwards his head, grasping a jmlley, to\nfrom the angle of the wrist ease breathing. As he spoke,\nN. W.). And he was pressing, she saw him take his hand\ndown ; the nurse took hold of\nit and replaced it. No one is\n\f112] The Tony\nI feel as if he was rather\nworried when he first got over.\nHe was worried about other\npeople here, and he wouldn't\nbe quite happy at first. He\nwasn't, because he says there\nwere circumstances that were\nparticularly hard for people\nwho were left here.\nHe had what he would call\ntwo groups of people. It's as\nif there was a little lump of\npeople very much in one con-\ndition, and somebody else he\nwas interested in and loved\nrather difi:erently.\nHe thinks of two people,\nand of a lady.\nIt's the lady specially he's\nsending this message to. Had\nshe been away from him a\nlittle while before he passed ?\nI think so. Not quite togetlier\nfor a little while. But it\ncouldn't be helped, it wasn't\nanybody's fault, just like con-\nditions. I think that that\nwould be just before he passed\nover.\nI get a feeling that he had\nbeen thinking about water, of\n\\rman Case. 23\nsure they noticed the position\nof the thumb ;\nbut, if one\nholds on to a bar in that\nposition, the thumb goes out-\nwards automatically.\nNote by Stephen Burmin.\nExcejat for the circumstances\nof his death itself, there were\nonly two minor cases where\nhis passing was inconvenient.\n.One was that his mother was\nin London at the time ; the\nother was that he was taking\nan important part in some\namateur theatricals due for\nproduction in a few days. He\nparticularly mentioned the lat-\nter to me immediately after\nthe accident. S.F.B.\nNotes by 3Iiss France.\nHis mother.\nYes, in London.\nNote by N. W.\nI know that his mother\nwas in London when the\naccident occurred.\nNote by Stephen Burman.\nThe first remark Tony made\n\f24 Nea Walker. [part\ngoing somewhere where there\nwould liave been water. He\nhadn't been there ; but a httle\nbefore he passed he had been\nplanning about going somewhere\nwhere there was water. Not a\nriver, I think it looks too wide,\nmore like the sea.\nwhen I reached him at the\ntime of the accident was that\nhe would not now be able to\ngo to Ogwen at Xmas for\nclimbing, as plaimed. At Og-\nwen there is a large lake.\nAlmost immediately afterwards, and after giving a letter\nB connected with the communicator, Feda says\n:\nHad he to go up and down ladders ? I had better be\ncareful. I get a feeling of him sometimes going up\nsomething awfully steep, not ordinary stairs, but almost\nstraight uj). It was something he had been rather in the\nhabit of doing when he was here.\nThis made no sense to me at the time. It was later\nannotated as \"a reference to rock-climbing of which he\nwas very fond,\" and it may therefore have been suggested\nby the thought of the proposed visit to Ogwen. As I\nhave already stated, Miss France had mentioned to me\nhis keenness on \" Alpine CHmbing \"\n;\nbut, that conveyed\nS7101V to me !\nFeda presently mentions \" an older man, passed over\n\"\nwho was \" waiting for him and over-joyed to see him,\nalthough he hadn't expected him so soon.\" This might\nbe Tony's maternal grandfather who had apparently been\ndescribed by Mrs. Garrett both to the Burmans and to\nme. Immediately, though not actually stating that it\nbelongs to this \" older man,\" Feda makes attempts at a\nname\nEoy, Rory\u2014not very long, Ruddy. I haven't got it\nright.\nThis, I find, was pretty correct, a family name being\nRoy : Tony's great-grandfather was Wilham Roy, his\ngrandmother Marion Roy, and his aunt is called Mabel\nAgnes Roy France ; all these connexions are on the\nmother's side.\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 25\nThen begin references to someone yonng,\nA lie . . . that he's left. He's upsetted when he thinks\nof having left the young man\u2014that upset him as much as\nanything . . . All he's saying is in a way for The Young\nOne\u2014to help him to grapple with things. Because, in\nsome ways, it's been the end of the world for him.\nI guessed that these references must be to his brother,\nStephen Burman, although Tony was the younger of the\ntwo. I knew by this time that the death had been a great\nblow to him. The family annotate that \" there was only\n18 months between them, they were devoted.\"\nSo far, my mind might again be the source of the\nremarks ; but in this connexion\u2014and I think it is worth\nremarking upon the appositeness of .\nthe connexions in\nwhich the evidence quite outside my knowledge occurs all\nthrough this sitting\u2014the record continues :\nHe's got something of mine Note by Stephen Burman.\nthat he very carefully fastens,\nand buckles and unbucldes,\nsomething with a strap. He\nthreads it through a buckle-\nthing, and that he likes hav-\ning because it belonged to this\nspirit.\nA leather motoring coat,\nwith straps and buckle, which\nwas presented to me on my\n21st birthday by Tony. It is\nthe only thing I have which\nunfaihngly remmds me of him.\nIt was a most expensive pre-\nsent which at the time he\ncould ill afford.\nMrs. Nea, this isn't a boy I\nam talking to, a man, not a\nchild. This is a person what's\ngrowed.\nDon't forget about the strap\nbecause that's rather important.\nI think he wants\n\u2014\nFeda\u2014Oh dear !\nThis young one has been\nterribly upset, nor ordinarily\nupset, but he's been almost\nafraid for him, afraid that it\nNote by Stephen Burman.\nThese remarks are more or\nless true.\n\f26 Nea Walker. [part\nmight have an effect on his\nmind. He's sensible and clever,\nand all that, but he says\n\u2014\nIt's been such a blow. And,\nhe says\u2014You know I knoiv\nhim, and I knoiv how he feels\nthings. He doesn't always let\nother people know. But \/\nknow how he feels things.\nContemporary Note by N. W.\n[The next bit went straight\non, but it sounded to me as if\nTony himself was feeling he\ncouldn't stand saying any more\non this topic]\nIt is strange that what followed were references to a\nBank Book and a little special fund therein, which appear\nto have been entirely wrong. The communicator indicates\nthat there has been discussion as to doing something with\nit. The annotators say that Tony's bank book \" was\nsurrendered for Probate purposes, and was not the subject\nof any discussion.\" I understand that the only thing like\nthe bank book in colour and size, would be his passport,\nwhich should have been returned to the Foreign Office for\ncancellation, but which the family still have. It would be\ninteresting if one could trace the source of this error :\npossibly\u2014I only suggest this\u2014Tony saw the passport and\nheard some discussion about it, and mistook it for the\nsimilar bank book\u2014which made his mind turn to the idea\nof the \" fund.\" I have experience in other cases of\n\" their \" seeing and hearing things in a rather distorted or\nvague manner, and consequently drawing wrong conclu-\nsions.\nIn submitting all this material to the Burmans, so that\nthey might check my statements and criticise my points,\nI learn that :\nYes, there was a good deal of discussion as to whether it\n(passport) should be surrendered to the Foreign Office ; but\nnothing was done.\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 27\nRather a striking corroboration of my surmise, for, in\nannotating about the Bank Book, the Burmans had said\nnotliing about this discussion.\nHaving learnt this, I enquired abovit the \" httle special\nfund,\" and discovered that, at the time of his death, he\nhad a deposit account at his bank of \u00a313 odd\u2014money he\nwas saving up for another climbing hohday.^\nI quote what follows the Bank Book incident verbatim\nwith the annotations.\nWhat is it ? Wheels ? Wheels.\nI don't know if he would be\ninterested in wheels, but he's\ntrying to build up something,\nand I saw wheels. He was\npretending to, like run them\nalong.\nI think it was something\nlike that he was trying to\nshow me earlier in the sitting.\nI get machinery all mixed up\nwith it.\nMrs. Nea, did the wheels all\nget mixed up ? I get a feeling\nthat something had happened\nto the wheels.\nNotes by Stephen Burman.\nHe was engaged in the\nmotor cycle trade, and was\nintimately connected with\nmachinery.\nHe says\u2014It wasn't the ivheels\nthat mattered, it was the rest\nof it. He got so impatient !\nHe says\u2014Perhaps something\ndid happen to the wheels, but\nthat doesn't matter. But I\nfeel he wanted me to notice\n^ On reading proofs of this case and talking over points with her\nhusband, Mrs. Burman wrote to N. W., .June 10, 1929 :\n\u2014\n\" My husband now tells me he took Tony's Bank Book down to the\nWorks, and used it to jot down particulars as to what should be done\nwith the money due as Tony's life-insurance . . .

[part\nHe won't say he passed\nover like that (snappmg her\nfingers together), he didn't do\nthat, and it's because he didn't\ndo that, that he doesn't want\nthem to think that he was\nsuffering. It wasn't what he\ncalls 'stantaneous ; he says, he\ndidn't suffer so ; he would have\ndone if he had lived a little\nbit longer. But I became\nunconscious, and it saved me\nfrom feeling.\nI think there's something\nthere (head to shoulder again)\nthat he would have felt. He\nfelt a little cold feeling up\nhis back. The doctor would\nknow he would feel that. Not\na pain, but a numb, cold,\nfeeling going up his back. He\nwould feel this numbing more\nthan pain.\nThe car was a new acquisi-\ntion, and the fact that we had\nconsiderable trouble with the\ncar on the way back would\nhave remained in his memory.\nLater we went in the same\ncar to climb in Derbyshire,\nand had trouble again on the\nreturn journey.\nNotes by Stephen Burman.\nI think this is all an effort\nto save his family pain. There\nis not the slightest doubt that\nho was in great pain until he\nwas given morphia, which was\nnot until an hour after the\naccident.\nThese would have been his\nsensations exactly.\nAfter tliis Feda made an attempt to give the name\nBurman, and got as far as Borrowman (I spell phone-\ntically).\nA reference then seems to be made to the famous watch\nwhich had been mentioned via Mrs. Garrett (p. 14) and\nto its telling the time correctly !\n\f112] The Tony Burvian Case. 31\nIs the young one going to\nhave a watch of his ? Because,\nhe says\u2014He'll be pleased with\nthe watch. The works is all\nright, to the watch, it tells\nthe time all right ; but why\ndoes he want to alter the\nopening and shutting part to\nmake it perfect ? For the\nYoung One, that should be\nseen to. Tell him that, he\nviiM be interested.\nNote by N. W.\nHis mother had the 2\/9\nwatch that was never right,\nabout which there was a\nfamily joke (see p. 14).\nIn the Garrett sitting it\nseems to be realised as a joke,\nbut, though it may have been\nmeant as a joke here, there is\nno indication of it. I of\ncourse knew about the watch\nby this time, JVIrs. Burman\nhaving told me about it when\ndiscussing my sitting with Mi\"s.\nGarrett. I understand that\nthe sentence about the open-\ning and shutting part appears\nto have no meaning.\nNote by N. W.\nTony Burman was not inter-\nested in stamps, the annotators\nsay, though his brother (\" the\nyoung one \") had a large collec-\ntion, with which Tony some-\ntimes helped him.\nI, on first seeing the anno-\ntation, counted this as one of\nthe distinct errors to be noted.\nBut on looking at the record\nagain, there seems no reason\nwhy the \" he \" of the stamp\njiaragraph should not be the\nsame as the \" he \" of the\nprevious sentence. ^ In fact\nthat is perhaps the more\nnatural reading and only es-\ncaped us because in my record\n^ The interpretation of pronouns in passages in which the control,\ne.g. Feda, speaks for the communicator, sometimes quoting him and\nsometimes describing what ho says, is often rather doubtful.\nAnd, oh, the stamps. He\nhad a good many.\nHe says he had them in\ntwo places. He had some\nthat he put in a book where\nthey might ordinarily be kept,\nbut he had got a few more he\nhad forgotten about, and he\nput them in an envelope, he\nthinks. He's sru-e he did. So\nhe expects they will be found.\n\f32 Nea Walker. [part\nI had interpolated between\nthe two paragraphs a note\nconcerning my knowledge of\nthe 2\/9 watch.\nOn realising this I made\nmore enquiries, and learnt that\nwhen interesting stamps came\nto the Works, Tony, or his\nbrother, put them in an enve-\nlojDC and brought them home.\nAlso that odd stamps were\nkept in an envelope at the\nback of the stamp book. By\nthis time however, 9 months\nlater, there were none in the\nenvelope.\nAfter this there are general remarks about psychic power\nand about Tony's attempts to communicate. He empha-\nsises the fact that his small amount of practical experience\nwhile still on earth had been a great help to him.\nThere are then references to the family, and apparently,\nin that connexion, again to Mrs. Burman's father. All\nthis was more general and less striking than the passages\nI have selected for special comment. Presently, about the\nmiddle of the sitting, occurs a reference to another\naccident. Feda says :\nA big H. comes up awfully close.\nN. W. Yes ? [Thinking of a Hilda I had heard of\nbefore. See p. 12 N. W.]\nThat comes uj) very near him.\n(Feda\u2014Try and say it again.)\nQualms, qualms. Nothing had happened the time\nbefore. Nothing had happened the time before. I had\nbeen in a very dangerous position a little while before I\npassed over, which he had got over awfully easily. And\nit might have been an awful thing ! He got out of that\nawfully easily. Someone else didn't get out of it so lightly as\nI did, but mine was really a miracle. It hurt someone else\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 33\nto a certain extent, but it was really wonderful that it\nwasn't more serious.\n[Note. Greek to me. N. W.]\nNow, as I learnt only after the sittings referred to in\nthis paper were over, there was in a sealed envelope ^\nprepared by Tony's family in view of this sitting, a\nrequest that Tony would refer to a poisoned hand from\nwdiich he had suffered about a, year before his death. It\nwas a very serious matter and might liave cost him his\nhand and arm, and its occurrence was due to his own\ncarelessness in not wearing rubber gloves as warned to do\nby his father. The passage just quoted, and another\nconsiderably later in the sitting referring to gloves,^\nnaturally suggested to the Burman family that Tony was\ntrying to fulfil the request in the sealed envelope, in spite\nof his not actually mentioning the nature of the accident,\nand in spite of evident confusion in the pronouns. But\none thing seemed to them a definite error, for the poison-\ning of Tony's hand had hurt no one else. No one else\nwas involved. It occurred to me, however, on re-reading\nthe record after annotation by the family, that possibly\nthe thought of his own poisoned hand recalled to\nTony's mind some case known to him in which the\nconsequences of similar poisoning were much more serious\nthan in his own, and that a rather muddled reference to\nthis other case accounted for the apparent error. I was\ntherefore greatly interested when on reading this report\nfor the purposes of checking, the Burmans told me that\nTony did know of a similar case which had occurred at\nhis Works a year or two previously, in which a foreman\nlost his finger. This had not previously occurred to them\nas the explanation of Tony's remarks when they were\nholding him and his accident only in their minds in\n^ In replying (on Jan. 2nd 1928) to an enquiry from Miss France as to\nwhether I would take the sealed envelope with me to my sitting with\nMrs. Leonard, I had said no, and that I thought she could not \" do more\nfor Tonjf than tell him you want him to meet me at Mrs. Leonard's\nsome time soonish.\" The envelope is now filed, unopened, with the Full\nReport at the S.P.R. at the end of the Report of the Leonard sitting.\n^ It was a shame I didn't wear the gloves, wasn't it ? Ought to\nhave made more use of them.\nO\n\f34 Net Walker. [part\nannotating. So that my surmise, based purely on what\nseemed possible from a study of the record, has turned\nout to be correct. I leave it thus, as I feel it may be\nmore useful to see that the Burmans had not the poisoned\nhand and all its connexions as clearly in mind as the\ncommunicator himself ; while I knew nothing.\nI may here digress in order to mention what seem to\nbe cross-correspondences between Miss France's automatic\nscript and the Leonard sitting we are dealing with. In\nMiss France's script of Dec. 26th 1927, in which Tony\npurported to say what he would tell me at my Leonard\nsitting, occur the words \" I will speak of the day when\nI had my poisoned hand,\" a statement again referred to\nin the automatic script of Jan. 1st 1928, with the addition\nthat he would try to \" spring it \" on me early in the\nsitting. The above passages from Mrs. Leonard's sitting\nquoted as apparently referring to the poisoned hand did\nnot occur early in the sitting. But, quite early in the\nsitting (see above p. 22) and in connexion with his fatal\naccident, Tony had referred to an awkward position of\nhis hand. This made Miss France think not only of the\nposition of the hand in hospital, but of the poisoned hand\nwhich had to be held in an awkward position, upright\nand with thumb stretching out owing to bandages. It is\nof course possible that the two were associated in Tony's\nmind and that the desire to speak early in the sitting of\nthe poisoned hand, led to the reference to the position of\nthe hand in hospital.\nTowards the very end of my sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nI got my first opportunity of asking a question without\ninterrupting, and reminded Tony that I had heard his\npeople had put something in a sealed envelope to which\nthey wished him to refer. The reply was\n\u2014\" I have made\nan allusion to it.\" I asked \" Which is the allusion ?\n\"\nand Tony said \" Rather early in the sitting ... I can't\nget it now.\"\nIn Miss France's automatic script of Dec. 26th 1927, is\nalso stated \" I will tell her [N. W.] about my ice\n\"\n\u2014\nmeaning his hobby of climbing (cf p. 8 above.)\n\f112] The Tony B^i^'man Case. 35\nNone of this automatic script was seen by me till May\n1928, so tliat cross-correspondence between it and my\nLeonard sitting of January 7th 1928 were not due to my\nconscious knowledge.\nReturning to my account of my sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard on January 7th 1928, I will select only the most\noutstanding points in the rest of the sitting. The matter\nI omit at this stage was not irrelevant or incorrect, simply\nless striking than what I quote, which is strictly evi-\ndential.\nThe first quotation relates to the Saturday afternoon\nbefore Tony Burman's accident :\nSaturday afternoons, happy.\nHappy Saturdays.\nN. W. I hope this is one\ntoo, then.\nIt is. But it ivas when I\nwas here. But a pity I took\nmyself off sometimes. But\nhappy.

It introduces also the idea of an argument (about\nwearing a hat), and immediately precedes the reference to\nwearing \" gloves \" already quoted (page 33), about which\nthere had also been an argument, with the same person.\nThere had been an awiul Note by Miss France.\nargument, not long before [his His father had told him\ndeath] about what he was to that he must wear a hat (he\nwear on his head. often went without one) when\nDid he want a fiat hat ? travelling for the Firm.

He says [the D.W.\nGroup] has helped him. They helped him early, quickly,\nnot just for to-day, but when he first passed over, they\n1 He had told his aunt, in script, actually on the 7th January (time\nnot noted and not remembered), that he \" would tliank me ; and on\nanotlier occasion, he had said that he had asked my Group to help him.\n\f38 Nea WalJcer.

All this about the Group was\nknown to me. but it came in. very naturally at the end\nof the sitting and with no prompting from me.\nAs I have not quoted the whole report of this sitting,\nI had better before leaving it give here a list, based on\nthe full report, of the points which were either (a) appar-\nently definitely wrong, or (b) have not been traced.\nWrong Points.\n1. \" Press Cuttings in his None,\npocket.\"\n2. \" Good at running and Never any good at either,\njumping.\" He boxed.\nNot Traced.\n1. \" There was somewhere\nelse where he did it [motor-\ncycling or motoring] JJp and\nDown\u2014Oh , Up and Down.\nAnd there's again photographs\nof that too.\"\nThere are apparently no\npliotographs of this.

The\ntrack is, I understand, hilly.\nBut Tony was not there to\nrace, though he had a machine\nwith him, and rode.

Taking everything into consideration\u2014relation-\nships, etc., etc. \u2014I think it the best sitting I had ever\nhad up till that date.\nBefore seeing the annotations on the January Leonard\nsitting, or meeting any of the Burman family again, I\ntried once more, on the 3rd March 1928, through IVIi's.\nLeonard. But, as regards evidence from Tony Burman,\nthis sitting was practically a failure. In places Tony\napparently broke through ; and there seems to have been\na rather good reference to his grandfather and another older\nman, whom, from the apposite remarks about the kind of\nregard he had for Tony, and the period at which he had\nknown him, the Burmans recognised as the Uncle Edwin\nalready referred to, both at their own sittings and to me\nat Mi's. Garrett's. But there was nothing else of real\ninterest.\nPossible reasons for this failure may be that\n(a) I was very tired, and I believe that the sitter has\nsomething to contribute at a sitting.^\n(6) That perhaps some unrecognised communicator mono-\n^ Curiovisly, on the veiy day of the sitting (I do not know the hour,\nnor can I now learn it), I find that Tony purported to write through\n\f40 Nea Walker. FPART\npolised most of the sitting. My knowledge was too slight\nfor nie to be able to tell, at the time, whether Tony was\ncommunicating or not. It was only afterwards that I\nlearnt that his family felt that someone else had got in,\nand that they could only recognise bits here and there as\nclear references to Tony.\n(c) My third suggestion is that Tony himself may have\nbeen less eager about the second experiment after the very\nsuccessful first one.\nI will conclude my account of evidence for communi-\ncation from Tony Burman with an extract from a sitting\nof Miss France with Mrs. Dowden which explains itself.\nDate, mh March 1928. Saturday.\nThe appointment was made by Miss France herself, by\nletter, in lier own name.\nJohannes (Mrs. Dowden's control), after explaining that\nTony wished to send messages to \" Dad and Stephen\n\"\nreported by automatic writing, that Tony said,\nI want specially to send Steph a message.\nI was watching him the otlier day.\nHe was thinking of me the otlier day.\nHe took up that lihotograph, you know the one I mean.\n[There are two, one of them the one which also made the\nmetal figure : S.B. took that one, I learn.

Which day ?\nMonday I think, but I can't be sure.\nOn Miss France's return to Birmingham next day,\nSunday 11th March, she asked Stephen Burman if lie had\n\" done anything with Tony's photo recently,\" specially\nomitting to mention any day\u2014Stephen Burman corro-\nborates this omission. He replied that, on the previous\nMonday evening, 5th March, he had picked up \" the one\nthat always stands on the mantelpiece in the dining-room,\"\nMiss France, u propos of my sitting, the date of which might have been\nany time in February or March, as far as Miss France knew -:\n\" I sliall bo there when she wants me . . . but I hope she will go\nwhen fihe is quite fresh in her mind because I can help her much more\neasily.\"\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 41\nand carried it into the next house to show the inmates,\nthere having been a discussion about a psychic photo-\ngraph. He did not say he had felt Tony's presence.\nMiss France states that as far as she can remember, she\nhad not seen her nephew to speak to all that week ; and\nis quite sure she knew nothing normally of the episode\nin connexion with the photograph.\nA FEW NOTES OF PERHAPS GENERAL INTEREST, MADE AS A\nRESULT OF MY STUDY OF THE WHOLE MATERIAL, AND\nWHILST THAT IS STILL FRESH IN MY MIND.\nIt is of course unwise to draw many inferences from a\nsingle case. But if these notes are regarded as merely\nsuggestive, they may be useful when more material of a\nsimilar kind is available for comparison ; and they are\ncertainly best written, and possibly read, while the case\nis fresh. Moreover, this case does not stand alone, even\nin my experience, for we have the White Case, recorded\nin \" The Bridge,'\" with which to compare it. And I will\nmake that the starting point of these remarks, although\nI have no intention of making a detailed comparison.\nIn the present effort to get evidence unknown to the\nsitter, I should like to point to the fact that I was not\ndeahng with a i^air of lovers, as I was in the case of Mr.\nand Mrs. White. One might in that case j)oint to the\nstrongly emotional link ; and I suppose it would be one's\nduty to do so. In the case of Tony Burman, as far as\nI can judge, having now met the family, there is very\nhttle trace of the kind of emotional sentiment which was\nprominent between the Whites. Mrs. White was certainly\nexceptional, and had, I felt, a temperament which must\nhave played a considerable part in leading to success.\nIn the case of Tony Burman there is none of that kind\nof temperament, as far as I can tell. Family love there\nis in abundance ; but everyday life holds its own ; tliere\nis full interest in and occupation with the affairs of this\nworld. We are not deahng, on this side, with a solitary\nfigure bereft of all that made hfe here worth while. So\nthat that aspect, which to my mind was a point perhaps\n\f42 Nea Walker. [part\nto weigh against the evidence in the White Case, does not\nenter into this case.\nIn regard to the two ostensible communicators, there\nare two very obvious differences. Gwyther White was\nabout twenty years older than Tony Burman ;\nand, he\nhad not the same happy-go-lucky type of mind, which\nTony seems to show.\nThen there is the fact that I myself was full of other\nwork, and simj^ly took this little experiment \" in my\nstride,\" without devoting much thought or attention to it\nbeforehand. In consequence, I have felt pleased, and\nrather surprised, at the success ; for I think that the\nLeonard Sitting of 7th January 1928 is quite equal, from\nthe point of view of pure evidence, to anything in \" The\nBridge.\"\nProbably the confidence I have gained as a result of\nexperience of what was possible has helped. And jjerhaps\nthat balanced the fact that my feehngs of sympathy\nwere not being drawn upon to anything hke the same\nextent.\nAt any rate, we have had in this case, as far as we\nknow them, different conditions and relations all round\n\u2014\nin regard to the bereaved, in regard to the communicator,\nand in regard to the sitter. Most certainly a difference\nof type and degree of berea.vement\u2014and it was on the\nquestion of the degree that I felt anxious in i'esj)ect of\nthe White evidence.\nAfter studying the full record of my sitting with Mrs.\nGarrett on Nov. 8th 1927, with annotations, a point seems\nto me to emerge which is perhaps worth noting, and which\nmight not be evident, unless one were very familiar with\nall the details. I think that it is rather likely that the\nvarious communicators may have been carrying on simul-\ntaneous conversations, independently, and, possibly, unknown\nto each other ; the medium tapping now one communicator\nnow another, without realising the change. A good deal\nof confusion and error would natura,lly result. Moreover,\nin the course of my work in collecting the White records,\nI had also noticed that it seemed possible that something\nof this kind had occuri'ed on various occasions. So that\n\f112] The Tony Burman Case. 43\nI was interested to see somewhat the same effect at this\nsitting with Mrs. Garrett.\nSince meeting the Burman family, I have one or two\npoints to submit in regard to the communicator Tony.\nIt appears that he was an amateur comedian of very\nmarked abihty. During one sitting he seems to refer to\nhis exploits, and outsiders had commented Yery favourably\non his gifts in that direction. Now, in view of the\npictorial method in use at sittings, at times obviously,\nperhaps often, when the sitter does not reahse it\u2014has\nthis gift of Tony Burman's been an element in the\nsuccess achieved. In the course of the White Case, Feda\nremarked that Gwyther White made a good communicator\nbecause he was very clearheaded, knew v.'hat he meant to\nsay, and was not to be turned aside by doubts on the\npart of sitter or control. Here, we perhaps have another\nnatural faculty influencing results, although not remarked\nupon by the control. In each case that fact, if it be one,\nshould be an argument on the side of survival.\nAnother feature wliich may have contributed to Tony\nBurman's success, is his gift for and practical experience\nin psychic work while still alive here. This has been\nalread}^ referred to.\nAgain, a characteristic which Tony's mother mentioned\nto me, and which might have an adverse effect, was that\nTony was not a plodder : he would, I learnt, start things\nkeenly, but it was often his brother who finished them ofi\nand did all the detail work. Tony had not patience in\nthat way, and was apt, when ahve, to lose interest after\nthe first successful experiment. Whether this has a\nbearing on the failure at the second sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard, I cannot say, since there were other contributory\nfactors. But I mention the characteristic as perhaps\nof interest in that connexion.\nSo far as I have been able to learn, the above are the\ncharacteristics most likely to have had a bearing on the\nresults.\nIn reference to the beginning of the Leonard Sitting of\nJanuary 7th 1928 (pp. 22, 30), the supposed Tony Burman\nmakes a special point, wliich he persists in through all the\n\f44 Nea Walker. [PAKT\nchannels used\u2014namely that he was \" quickly unconscious\n\"\nand suffered little. This, as already shown, is not, from\nthe jioint of view of the brother who was with him, ti'ue.\nBut the constant repetition on Tony's part (if we assume\nthat his personality is at the back of the communications)\nhas its interesting aspect, although said to be inexact, and\nthus rather irritating to the brother, on whose mind the\nimpression of the suffering and the length of time before it\ncould be relieved, are vivid. I feel that these remarks may\nhave originated in one or two ways perhaps worth indi-\ncating, for the sake of other people troubled by the same\nkind of thing.\n(a) General mediumistic stock in trade to comfort\nrelatives.\n(b) The communicator's desire to relieve the agony in\nhis brother's mind about the period of suffering through\nwhich he passed while the two waited, longingly, for the\nambulance.\n(c) The fact that to Tony, now, the period may well\nseem relatively short. We all know the experience of\nforgetting pain as other experiences crowd out the memory.\nPersonally I do not feel that (a) explains Tony's per-\nsistent remarks. I fancy that the tendency to improve\naspects is rather on the side of the communicators than\non Feda's\u2014as far as my experience of Mrs. Leonard's\nmediumship goes. But I do feel that it is not an argu-\nment against the identity of Tony, rather one in its\nfavour, that either for reason (6) or (c)\u2014jjossibly partly\nfor both\u2014he should reiterate this same statement so\ncontinually. I knew nothing about it either way, at the\ntime, although I knew that he had died fairly soon after\nthe accident. And if the source of most of the material\nin this record be the mind of some member of the\nBurman family, then the constant insistence that Tony\ndid not suffer must surely have a different one.\nIn connexion with my references to the confusion\nbetween the Bank Book and the PassjDort (j). 26), a few\ngeneral remarks, based on experience of aj^parent mistakes\nthe sources of which I happen to have been able to trace,\nmay be suggestive. I fancy that often we seem to \"them\"\n\f112] The Tony Bumian Case. 45\nquite as hazy and far away as \" they \" do to those of us\nwho have the faculty of feehng and seeing \" them \" just\na httle. Granting the possibihty of survival and communi\ncation \" they \" have the advantage over us of having had\nour experiences, and can therefore probably interpret\nbetter what they see and hear than we can ; also \" they\n\"\napj)ear to have more easy access to us than we to\n'\n' them\n'\n\"\n.\nBut, on neither side is the contact complete, or constant,\nor always to the same degree. A friend of mine once\nsuggested a simile\u2014viz., that it was, for us at any rate,\nrather like looking at a stone at the bottom of a pool ;\nif one coiild reach it and handle it, it would be found to\nbe real and there ; but the shape, size, colour, surround-\nings, etc., would be found to have been considerably\naffected by the medium through which it was seen, and\nby the various elements acting on that medium.\nTo my mind, to allow for such errors, provided one does\nit cautiously and never dogmatises on that line, is not to\nbe uncritical but to be fair, and, as in the present in-\nstance, possibly to open the way for a sound explanation\nof some point. Tracing errors and their cause is com-\nphcated so often by the fact that one does not know\nwhat, in the mind of the medium, is impeding the\ncommunicator. I discovered that fact in working with my\nsister ;\nfor, in her case, I could often trace the reason why\nshe made certain mistakes, or \" neard \" certain words as\nsomething rather different. In working with a strange\nmedium, one cannot know those reasons. I feel sure that\nthe more we can study that side of communication, the\nmore we shall understand, and the less we shall be able\nto say bluntly \" a bad shot, quite off the mark.\" And\nso it came that I could not believe that the reference to\na bank book was a bit of communication without foun-\ndation and entirely erroneous, although it was at first\ncounted by the Burmans, and in consequence by me, as a\ndefinite error. We had not, I felt, the key to the form\nin which it had been given, that was all. For one thing\nit had not \" come through \"'\nin the groping manner in\nwhich, sometimes, material comes before the medium has\ngot on to the correct \" wave length,\" if one may call it\n\f46 Nea Walker. [part 112]\nso. It had come quite definitely and crisply. There were\none or two other points in the same category\n\u2014\ne.g. the\nStamps, the Poisoned Hand. And I reached the real\nexplanation of apparent incorrectness or confusion, in each\ncase, by trjdng to find out, from the context, and from\ntrying to imagine myself as communicator, how, if the\nmistake had been made by the communicator, it had come\nabout. I did this without in the least knowing whether\nit would clear matters up. But, as I have often found,\nit did. And I think that this could frequently be done\nif the investigator had patience, and, still more, if the\nannotaters were as kind and long-suffering over the\nresulting enquiries as I found the Burman family.\nJan. 17th 1929.\n\fREPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION OF SOME\nSITTINGS WITH MRS.

It would be a just cause for\ncomplaint if any should be induced to expend a consider-\nable amount of time and energy in considering the\ndiscussion of a series of sittings, only to find at the end\nthat they contained nothing of positive value, in their opinion,\nfor psychical research.\nThe experiments were as follows :\nCopies of the records of certain selected sittings were\nsent to persons totally unconnected with the real sitters.\nThese persons were asked to imagine that the sittings\nreferred to themselves, and to annotate accordingly. Any\ncoincidences which might occur would, therefore, be attri-\nbutable to chance alone.\nA system of scoring or marking was devised, and the\nchance sittings were scored in exactly the same way as\nthe real. It was argued that if the score for the real\nsittings was considerably in excess of that for chance,\nwhen taken over a fair number of cases, it might be\nclaimed that chance as a possible explanation was excluded.\nThe figure for the ratio by which real should exceed\nchance in order to afford comjjlete proof was fixed at\neight times.\nA more detailed account of the methods adopted and\nsome discussion on certain points arising will be found in\nthe body of the report.\nOne or two of these points must be briefly mentioned\nhere.\nNearly all those who have participated in these control\nexperiments have had some experience in psychical\nresearch, and it has been suggested that this would tend\nto make them critical in annotating and thus reduce the\nchance score.\nAlso, it is said that the chance annotator would not\nfeel the same interest in the sitting as the real sitter\nand would thus be liable to overlook coincidences.\nFurther, where the real sitters have been convinced of\nD\n\f50 H. F. Salimarsh. [part ^\nsurvival and of the identity of the ostensible communi- ]\ncator, as was the case in a good many of the sittings\nselected for this experiment, the real annotations would\ntend to be more favourable than the chance.\nThe personal factor comes in very largely in the whole\ninvestigation, some annotators exhibiting the \" will to\nbelieve \" rather markedly, while others display an equally\nstrong \" will to disbelieve.\"\nIt was to cover these and similar factors that the ratio\nof superiority necessary to exclude chance was fixed as\nhigh as eight times.\nThe choice was to some extent arbitrary, and it must\nbe left to the individual judgment of the reader whether\nit be reasonable or not.\nThe first experiment was as follows :\nThe sittings all related to one ostensible communicator.\nIt was a case in which a young flying officer, who had\nbeen killed in action, purported to communicate, and the\nchance annotators were all persons who had suffered a\nsimilar loss, that is to say, persons who had lost a son\nor brother of about the same age and in somewhat similar\ncircumstances. The idea was to try to find out how much\nof what was said of the ostensible communicator would\nbe true of other men of similar age and circumstances.\nThe figures are as follows :\nThere were six sets of chance annotations, comprising\nfifty-three sittings in all.\nTotal possible score. Real score. Chance score.\n5642 4107 = 72-8% 452 = 8%\nThe average score for real is thus nine times that for\nchance. Taken by itself this might seem sufficiently great\nto exclude chance, but there are two instances where the\nchance scores were more nearly comparable with the real\nthan is shown by the average. For one the total\npossible was 850, real score 533 = 64%, chance score\n141 = 17%, giving a ratio of superiority over chance of\n3- 8 ; in the other, total possible score 939, real score\n757 = 80%, chance score 163 = 17%, giving a superiorit}- of\n4- 6 times.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 51\nThe second experiment consisted of a number of sittings\nselected at random from those which had given good\nresults for real annotators.\nThere were fifteen sets, comprising eighty-five sittings in all.\nTotal possible score. Real score. Chance score.\n5554 3226 = 58-1% 487 = 8-75%\nThe average real score is thus 6-6 times greater than the\nchance score. Taken by itself this might seem a superi-\nority sufficiently large to give a very good case for the\nexclusion of chance, although it did not quite come up\nto the standard fixed. There are, however, three sets of\nfive sittings each which show scores much higher than the\naverage, and in one case approaching the real score.\nThese are :\nTotal possible. Real score. Chance score.\n(1) 374 195 = 52% 86 = 23%\n(2) 353 218 = 59% 101=28%\n(3) 404 185 = 46% 136 = 33%\nOut of these fifteen sittings two only gave no chance\nscore at all, in one case the chance score was slightly in\nexcess of the real, in five it was only slightly less.\nNow it might be said that these facts prove that it is\nquite possible that chance alone may account for the\najDparent veridicality of the statements, as in actua.1 fact\nit has done in a fair number of instances.\nOn the other hand it may be argued that while one\nknows antecedently that it is theoretically possible for\nchance to give some scores comparable with the real\nsittings, provided that a sufficient number of tests are\nmade, the real basis of comparison should be the average\nscore.\nIn a very large number of tests one would expect to\nfind a certain number of high scores by chance, scores,\nin fact, which might be much greater than the real : the\nquestion is whether the number of high real scores found\nin this experiment is so much in excess of that which\nmight be expected from chance that some other cause of\nthis excess must be sought. Whether this be so or not\nmust be left to the individual judgment of the reader.\n\f52 H. F. SaUmarsh. [part\nREPORT.\nIntroductory.\nThanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor, it was\npossible to arrange for a continued series of sittings with\na trance medium under conditions which permitted the\nhope that some advance in our Ivuowledge of the pheno-\nmena might be attained.\nThe Society was fortunate enough to persuade Mrs.\nWarren Elliott, the well-known medium, to agree to give\nthree sittings per week over a period of one year under\nthe conditions desired, and it is only fitting that this\nrejiort should commence with an expression of appreciation\nof the manner in which Mrs. Elliott has performed her\npart in the experiment.\nShe has been most assiduous to co-operate in every\nway possible to her, and has cheerfullj'^ submitted to\nconditions which, particularly in one class of sitting, must\nhave been extremely trying.\nAs to the nature and quality of her mediumistic gifts\nnothing need be said at this opening stage. The mean-\ning and interpretation of the results and the deductions\nto be drawn therefrom will be discussed later.\nThe gratitude of the Society and all others interested\nin the work of Psychical Research is due, therefore, in\nthe first place to the generous donor, who has made the\nexjieriment possible, and in the second place to Mrs.\nWarren Elliott, whose co-operation has enabled the Society\nto carry it out.\nThe primary object of the experiment was to attempt\nto throw some light on the psychological mechanism of\ntrance mediumship.\nAt the present stage of Psychical Research there is\navailable an immense amount of material, records of\nsittings, accounts of spontaneous phenomena, evidence of\nvarious kinds of supernormal knowledge, much of which\nis of unexceptionable quality ; there is also no lack of\nhypotheses put forward to exjilain the facts, but so far\nour knowledge of the psychological mechanism involved is\nsmall. It seems fairly oljvious that until this defect is\n\f112J Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 53\nremedied the progress of Psychical Research, as a science,\ncan hardly be other tlian slow and uncertain.\nThe accumulation of evidence is, of course, a matter\nof great importance ; it is impossible to have too much,\nbut an understanding of the psychological conditions is\nan indispensable pre-requisite to the fruitful employment\nof that evidence.\nThe sittings described in this pager are of two types\n:\nviz. the Sitter Present, known as S.P. sittings, and the\nAbsent Sitter, called A.S. sittings.\nS.P. Sittings.\nIn the first the sitter is present at the sitting with a\nshorthand writer supplied by the Society, who takes\ndown all that is said, both by the medium and by the\nsitter. Every care is taken to preserve the anonymity of\nthe sitter, and this, so far as can be ascertained, has\nbeen successful in nearly every case. There are only two\ninstances in which Mrs. Elliott has normally known the\nidentity of the sitter. 1st. A single sitting with Miss\nNewton, undertaken as a special ex^oeriment. 2nd. A\nseries of sittings with the Rev. W. S. Irving, who, having\npreviously had several private sittings with Mrs. Elliott,\nhad become known to her by name, though originally\nintroduced under a pseudonym.\nThe notetakers were, with one exception, also introduced\nunder pseudonyms, though, of course, Mrs. Elliott was aware\nthat they were connected with the Society. The one exception\nwas Dr. Woolley who took notes in a few instances.\nThe various notetakers have performed their laborious\ntask in a most praiseworthy fashion, the notes are\nextremely full and clear, care has been taken to record\neverything said, both by the medium and the sitter, and\nto note all relevant details.\nAs is customary with Mrs. Elliott, the sitter handed\nher a relic, that is to say some object associated with the\ndeceased person concerning whom it was hoped to obtain\ncommunications.\nIn a few cases this practice was varied in order to try\nspecial experiments : these will be referred to later.\n\f54 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\n_\nThe second type of sittmg, i.e. the Absent Sitter\nsittings, constitute a new departure in Psychical Research,\nand it is from these that the most valuable evidence is\nobtained.\nFor these sittings a number of persons were invited to\nsend to the Society relics associated with a deceased\nrelative or friend, and precautions were taken to prevent\nany normal knowledge from reaching anyone concerned in\nthe sitting, either the medium, the notetaker or anyone else.\nThe relics were sent to an officer of the Society. They were\nthen enclosed in separate envelopes, numbered, and the\nnumbers entered in a book against the name of the\nsender. The various packages were then placed in a\nlocked cupboard. On the morning of a sitting the note-\ntaker, who went alone to the medium, was allowed to\nselect at random a package from those in the cupboard.\nIn Miss Newton's own words, \"The majority of the\nrelics were sent to me open, and I did them up and\nsealed them, and handed them to Mr. Dingwall, who\nnumbered them and entered the number in a' book\nagainst the name of the sender, of which he was informed\nby me. . . . After the packets had been numbered they\nwere put into the locked cupboard, and neither Mr.\nDmgwall nor I saw them again until they had been\nused ;\nthe notetaker bringing back and handing to me\nthe used packet.\"\nA second relic was taken in reserve, to be used if the\nfirst failed to give any result.\nThus the senders of the relics had knowledge of the\nidentity of the person to whom they referred, but did not\nknow when they were being used. The Officer of the\nSociety who received them knew the name of the sender,\nand in some cases might have known or guessed the\nname of the person with whom the object was associated,\nbut did not know when any particular relic was being\nused. The notetaker would know the number of the\nrelic, but, not having had access to the book, would not\nknow to whom the number referred.\ni\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 55\nThe medium would, of course, possess no normal know-\nledge whatsoever.\nIn a good many cases the package contaming the relic\nwas not opened by the medium, and there is nothing in\nthe sittings to indicate that this factor had any deter-\nmining influence on the quality of the evidence given,\nthat is to say, evidence of as good a quality has been\ngiven in cases when the package has been unopened as\nin those where it has been opened.\nMrs. Elliott's Control, Topsy.\nIll all cases of S.P. sittings, and in the majority of the\nA.S., the medium went into trance, and the communica-\ntion was through her control, Topsy ; in some, however,\nof the A.S. sittings the medium has remained in her\nnormal state and has dictated the communications to the\nnotetaker. There are one or two instances where the\nrelic was left with the medium, who later on dictated her\nimpi'essions to her husband and handed the record to\nthe notetaker at the next sitting.\nNo difference in the quality of the communications\ngiven by these different methods can be detected.\nIn the trance sittings the characteristic child-like diction\nof Topsy is always employed. It nmst be admitted that\nthis is not altogether convincing ; a child who would\ntalk as Topsy does, and make the grammatical mistakes\nthat she makes, would hardly know the meaning of\nmany of the words she employs, e.g. \" trivialities,\"\n\"inspiration,\" \"over-enthusiastic,\" \"mental distance be-\ntween them.\"\nShe is, on the whole, consistent in her manner of\nspeaking, but some of the errors of pronunciation and\ngrammar appear hardly natural. This remark is not\nintended as a criticism, nor could it be reasonably taken\nas such, for Topsy, whatever she may be, cannot be\nconsidered as psychologically comparable to a normal\nchild. If, as assumed by spiritistic hypothesis, she is\nan independent entity who acts simply as a mouthpiece\nfor others, then it may be supposed that she would\noccasionally use words borrowed from the more mature\n\f56 H. F. SaUmarsh. [part\nintelligences whose messages she is transmitting. On the\nalternative hypothesis, i.e. that Topsy is a personifica-\ntion of some stratiim of the subconscious mind of the\nmedium, the difficulty does not lie in the employment of\nwords not natural to a child, hut in the assumption of\na childish personality. This, however, appears to be a\nquite usual phenomenon with trance mediums, and various\nreasons can be suggested for it, none of which need be\nhere discussed.\nWhatever Topsy's defects in grammar and pronuncia-\ntion may be, she certainly possesses the faculty of gra,phic\ndescription. She frequently sums up in a few words a\nsituation which would take perhaps two or three sentences\nin more orthodox grammatical style to elucidate. For\nexample, \" Gives feeling doesn't feel ill and yet him ill\nfor a long time,\" seems to describe accurately the con-\ndition of a man who had been confined to an invalid\nchair for some years owing to an accidental injury.\nHer descriptions of character are particularly good.\nSo far as can be judged from the records of the sittings\na large part of the material appears to come to both\nTopsy and Mrs. Elliott in her normal condition in the\nform of visual impressions, although there is a certain\namount of what apj^ears to be auditory. This point will\ncome in for full discussion later.\nMethod of dealing ivith reeords.\nThe methods adopted for dealing with the material\nwere as follows :\nAfter the records had been annotated by the sitter or\ncontributor of the relic, the various paragrajjhs or separate\nitems were numbered, each record being kej)t in a separate\nbig envelope on the front of which a complete list of\nthe separate items and their numbers is written. By\nthis system any reference can readily be found if its\nnumber is known.\nOn the backs of the envelopes are endorsed the various\nscores for the sitting, also any remarks or notes.\nWhen the records were being examined for the purpose of\ndoing this work it was noticed that certain topics tended\n\f112] Sittings with BIrs. Warren Elliott. 57\nto repeat themselves with what seemed to be abnormal\nfrequency. For example, a large number of ostensible\ncommunicators were said to have had an injury to the\nleg or foot ; a ring with black and an animal standing\nup on it was also mentioned several times. These topics\nare called cliches.\nA selection of about one hundred cliches was made,\nand the entire set of sittings was gone through and each\nmention entered in a card index.\nIn the same way all names and initials given were\nindexed.\nWhere a sitter or group of sitters has had more than\none sitting the records were collected into a sub -case,\nand this sub-case was treated separately. A complete\nindex of every statement or item of information given\nwas made for each sub-case : by this means all corres-\npondence between the sittings was noted.\nA separate preliminary report on each sub-case was\ndrawn up and kept for reference.\nSome of the sub-cases were, however, of so poor a\nnature from various causes that this detailed work was\nnot undertaken in connection with them.\nThe primary problem in all researches of this kind is\nto find some basis of comparison, some method of estimat-\ning the relative quality of the evidence. This is necessary\nfor many purposes, e.g. to determine whether trance or\nnormal sittings give better results, whether the envelope\ncontaining the relic remaining unopened by the medium\naffects the evidence, whether the nature of the relic has\nany effect on the communications, to compare the quality\nof the S.P. and the A.S. sittings, and, finally, to provide\na basis of comparison with the result of pure chance.\nThe methods adopted for this last and most important\ncomparison have been briefly referred to in the preface,\nand will be explained in more detail later.\nIt must he em-phasised that the scores arrived at are not to be\nconsidered as giving the absolute value of any sitting, they are for\npurposes of comparison only. This point is of the utmost\nimportance, and must constantly be borne in mind in order\nto avoid misapprehension. In almost all cases the scores\n\f58 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nallottetl show a far higher figure than could be considered as\nrepresenting the real evidential value. Thus, for example,\nthere are several S.P. sittings with scores of over 90% ; were\nthis taken to represent the absolute value we might reason-\nably suppose that they aii'orded almost conclusive proof of\nthe identity of the ostensible communicator, etc., but this\nis not the case ; the high score may be due almost entirely\nto a set of commonjilace or vague statements which would\nbe probably true of most sitters.\nThe problem of scoring is one of very great difficulty,\nthe statements made are generally vague and indefinite,\nit is as a rule impossible for the annotator to answer\nwith a plain \" Yes \" or \" No.\" The closest analogy\nseems to be the marking of examination paj^ers on some\nliterary subject where differences of opinion, individual\nidiosyncracy, nuances of meaning, all comjilicate the\nmatter. It is impossible to eliminate completely the\npersonal factor in both the amiotator and the scorer.\nThe ideal method would be to have each record scored\nindependently by several persons, who would be provided\nwith a set of rules for their guidance ; a discussion be-\ntween them of each disputed j^oint would in all probability\nthen result in some compromise, and the average of the\nfinal scores might be taken as a fairly reliable estimate.\nThis, however, would entail an enormous amount of\nlabour, and it has not been found possible to undertake\nit.\nThe scoring in this exj)eriment has been done by one\nperson, i.e. the writer of this report, and he has attempted\nto do the best possible in the circumstances by re-\nvision at various intervals of time and by striving to\npreserve the same mental attitude in all cases. The sole\ncriterion adopted in scoring an item as veridical is, \" Can\nthis be said to be veridical from the information given\nby the annotator ?\n\" As far as possible the critical\nfaculty has been suspended altogether, the only exception\nbeing the classification of the statements under the classes\nof \" vague,\" \" definite,\" or \" characteristic,\" and the\nsmall deductions made from the total score for \" all\nvague.\" (These terms will be explained presently.)\n\f112] Sittings ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 59\nThis attitude was adopted in order to reduce to the\nminimum the factor of individual judgment on the jjart\nof the scorer ; if he had attempted to assign to each\nitem its evidential value from the point of view of some\nparticular theory or hypothesis, the utility of the scores\nas a basis of comparison would be seriously vitiated, they\nwould have been tinctured with his personal predilections\nand idiosyncracies. The scorer has had the advantage of\nhaving had to annotate some sittings with articles contri-\nbuted by himself, and this made the difference in mental\nattitude very apparent.\nMethod of Scoring.\nThe method of scoring adopted was as follows. The\nvarious statements were classified under the three headings:\n1st. Vague or commonj)lace statements, that is to say,\nstatements which might be true of a very large number\nof people ;\ne.g. a communicator is described as fairly\ntall, blue or blue-grey eyes, and so on, lived in the\ncountry or near water, used to write a lot, sitter was\nbuying boots, was going for a holiday, ordinary names,\netc.\n2nd. Definite statements, i.e. statements which though\npossibly true of a good number of people are not of so\ncommonplace a nature as those of the first class ;\ne.g.\ncommunicator described as \" though very gentle, he was\nfrightfully daring,\" \" used to fly in the air,\" \" sitter\nsleeps in a bed too short for her,\" \" Sitter had a quarrel\nwith his father,\" etc.\n3rd. Characteristic statements, i.e. statements which are\nso characteristic that the probability of being true by\nchance is practically negligible. These are very scarce.\nNumber 1 or \" V \" statements are by far the most\nnum^erous ;\nthey count 1.\nNumber 2 or \" D \" statements occur as a rule about\nfive or six times in a good sitting ;\nthey count 5.\nNumber 3 or \" C \" statements count 20.\nThe total possible and the actual scores are computed\nby addition and the percentage worked out. When the\nnumber of D or C statements is very small a deduction\n\fGO H. F. SaUmarsh.\n\\H made from the iictiial scoix; based on an estimate of\nthe general character of the sitting ; this deduction is\nrarely more than about 10%, except where the total\npossible score is very small. In the figures given it\nwill he observed that there is a gross and a net score,\nthe net score is after the deduction, if any, has been\nmade.\nWhere a V statement is not only not true but definitely\nopposed to the truth, e.g. where a person is described as\ntall when, in fact, he was particularly short, a minus\nscore is given ; where a D statement is pa,rtially true, 2\nis allowed in actual score ; in the total jjossible score the full\namount, 5, is counted.\nAs above remarked, the total possible and the actual\nscores are computed by addition. This is, of course,\nnot strictly correct. An example will make this clear.\nIf out of 100 statements, 99 V and ID, 49 of the\nV statements and the D statement are found to be\nveridical, this would give a score of 54 out of a possible\n104, or 51-9%.\nBut if, out of these 50 veridical statements, 5 were\nD statements and 45 were V, this would give a score\nof 70 out of a possible 120, or 58-3%.\nIt is clear that the addition of four more definite\nstatements add far more to the real value than is indi-\ncated by the increase of G-4%.\nTo arrive at the correct absolute value by scoring would,\nassuming it to ])e possible, entail an enormous mass of calcu-\nlation. It is only with such phenomena as telepathic experi-\nments with cards, where the veridicalitj^ can be accurately\ngauged, that mathematically correct values can readily be\nobtained. However, a suggestion for a more accurate method\nwill be made in an appendix. This unavoidable error is to\nsome V ry small extent compensated for by the deductions\nmade for \" all vague \" sittings.\nHowever, as the scores are not intended to be a gauge\nof the absolute value, but are used for purposes of com-\nparison only, the point may be passed over : the essential\nthing is that the same methods should be used in all\ncases. The most important of these comparisons is that\n\f112] Sittings ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 61\nwith pure chance, and an account of some control exjierinients\ndesigned to assist this comparison has been given in the\npreface.\nA question arose in connection with the selection of the\nsittings to be used for the second of these control ex-\nperiments. There were two alternatives ojDen : 1st, to\nselect sittings entirely at random ;\n2nd, to select those\nwhich had proved to contain a fair amount of veridical\nmatter for the actual sitter.\nStrictly speaking, the first of these alternatives is the\ncorrect procedure, but to make the test a fair one a\nvery lai'ge number of records would have to be treated ;\nit was not found possible to obtain a sufficient number\nof records and pseudo-annotators, so the second alternative\nwas adopted. It is obvious that only A.S. sittings could\nbe used in this experiment as the conditions of an S.P.\nsitting, viz. the presence of the sitter and the interchange\nof remarks between the sitter and the medium, could\nnot be duplicated in a pseudo-sitting.\nScoring as applied to physical descriptions of communicators.\nOne of the most prominent features of all trance\nsittings is, of course, the physical descriptions of the\nostensible communicators. In very few cases are these\nsufficiently definite to possess any considerable evidential\nvalue, their chief use is to provide means of prima-facie\nrecognition ;\nhowever, it seemed possible that, in sjDite of\ntheir general vagueness, they might present some evidence\nof identity if it could be shown that their general veridi-\ncality was much in excess of chance. To test this a\nfurther experiment was devised.\nA rather more elaborate system of scoring was adopted.\nThe various items of the descriptions, which in Topsy's\ncase are more or less standardized, were classified under\nfive headings, viz. General Congruity, Partial Congruity,\nNot Inconsistent, Inconsistent, and Not Mentioned. All\nthe descriptions which were recognised by the annotator\nas probably appljang to one ostensible communicator were\ncollated and scored in this fashion and percentages worked\nout.\n\f62 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nA number of records were selected at random by draw-\ning the envelopes containing them from the pile, and the\ndescrijitions therein collated and scored in the same way.\nWhere there was more than one description of ostensible\ncommunicators in any sitting, that which corresponded\nmost nearly to those already collated was selected, thus\nfavouring the chance score to some extent.\nA comparison of the percentages thus obtained affords\na gauge of the value of physical descriptions.\nThe chance score for physical descriptions thus obtained,\nas compared with the actual score, is considerably higher\nthan in the other chance experiments with whole sittings.\nThis is only what might have been expected. In the\ncase of \"whole\" sittings the number of statements which\nwould be veridical for any sitter is undoubtedly large,\nbut the total possible number of such statements, both\nveridical and non-veridical, is practically unlimited : it\nincludes everything which could possibly be said about\nhuman affairs.\nOn the other hand, the total possible in physical des-\ncriptions is comparatively small. There are at most only\nabout eighteen or twenty items in a physical description,\nfor many of which there are only three or four possi-\nbilities, e.g. a man can be described as tall, fairly tall,\nmedium or short, which gives a three-to-one probability\nagainst being correct by pure chance. The maximum\nnumber for any item would not exceed fifteen or twenty\npossibilities. If the average be taken at ten, it would\nbe a fair estimate. Thus the average probability of any\nitem being correct by pure chance is one in ten, while\nfor the other statements in the whole sittings the j)roba-\nbility would be very small.\nIt must be borne in mind that these scores do not\npretend to be any gauge of absolute value. This has\nbeen said before, but it cannot be too strongly insisted\nupon. The totals are arrived at by addition, whereas to\nestimate the probability for any set of statements the\ntotal should be a function of the product of the separate\nchances. Averages of probability can be employed solely\nas a rough method of comparison.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 63\nAlthough physical descriptions, taken by themselves,\nhave little evidential value, except in those rare cases\nwhere some peculiar characteristic feature is mentioned,\nthey may possess some importance when combined with\nother veridical statements.\nFor example, a description of a young man as tall,\nfairly broad, fair complexion, oval face, blue eyes, well-\nmarked eyebrows, nose of medium length, fair hair and\nsmall moustache, is by itself, even if correct, of little\nvalue\u2014there are some millions of boys whom the descrip-\ntion would fit ; but if it be said that this young man\nwas the elder of two boys the field is narrowed some-\nwhat ; if it be further said that he was very fond of\nmusic it is further restricted, for out of the number of\nboys of this description who were the elder of two boys\nnot all would be fond of music ; if it goes on and further\ndescribes him as being as gentle as a girl yet wonderfully\ndaring, etc., etc., and also mentions incidents in his past\nand details of present happenings among his family ana\nfriends, then the probability of all this arising from pure\nchance is comparatively small.\nThe figures giving the results of these various control\nexperients are given elsewhere. Some further remarks\nwill be found on page 145 et seq.\nOther modes of classification.\nIn view of the various hypotheses which have been put\nforward from time to time to account for the apparently\nsupernormal knowledge in mediumistic communications,\nfurther kinds of statistics have been collated. In sittings\nwhich have been selected for the purpose the statements\nhave been classified under the headings of Ante-mortem\nor A.M., these being statements which purport to refer\nto events or conditions prior to the death of the ostensible\ncommunicator ; Post-mortem or P.M., i.e. statements\nreferring to events or conditions subsequent to his death.\nA further subdivision has been made, each class of\nstatement has been divided into what are called physical\nor P. events or conditions and non-physical or N.P. events\nor conditions. The criterion used in this classification was\n\f64 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nas follows :\n\" Had an observer arrived suddenly on the\nscene, could he have obtained knowledge of this fact ?\n\"\nIf he could have done so, it is classed as a physical\nevent ; if not, as a non-physical. The physical events\nor conditions are, therefore, mainly of a material nature,\novert actions and obvious conditions ; the non-physical\nare chiefly mental states, emotions, thoughts, feelings not\npatently expressed, relations between the actors other\nthan physical or family relations, and so on.\nFrom the indefinite and rather nebulous nature of the\nsubject-matter these classifications are, of necessity, some-\nwhat rough ; it is frequently very difficult to decide to\nwhich class an item should belong. However, as the\nnumber dealt with is comparatively large, and the results\nintended solely as approximate estimates, the unavoidable\nerrors are not such as to deprive the statistics of their\nusefulness. Mathematical accuracy is unobtainable and,\nas will appear from the subsequent discussion on the\nbearing of the figures on the question of theory, it is not\nindispensable.\nProper names, initials and physical descriptions are not\nincluded in these statistics.\nThere is one further classification. The non-physical\nstatements have been classified under the heading of those\nrelating to the ostensible communicator and those relating\nto the sitter.\nThe following is a glossary of the sjiecial terms and\nsigns used.\nGlossary of terms used.\nTrance slUinr\/.

The A Case.\nThe first case from which extracts will be quoted is\none in which there are in all thirteen S.P. and seven A.S.\nsittings of the ordinary type ; there are also six Intrusion\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 67\nsittings, i.e. sittings with a relic contributed by some one\nconnected with this group of sitters, in which the chief\ncommunicator of the group appears to intrude sufficiently\nto be recognised and to give veridical communications.\nThis communicator is here called A. He was born in\nAmerica on 2nd August, 1887, was taken to London\nwhen a child of fifteen months, and lived there until he\nwas eleven years of age. He was then on the Continent\nin various countries for a couple of years. In 1902 the\nfamily returned to London for a year, after which they\nwent back to America. They lived in a house which\nthey had built on the slope of Mount Tamalpais over-\nlooking the Bay of San Francisco. After the earthquake\nof 1908 the family returned to London, and A. never\nleft England again until he went to France as Second-\nLieutenant in the R.W. Surreys in November 1916.\nHe had been in the University O.T.C. whilst at Trinity\nCollege, Oxford.\nHe became a naturalised British subject in order that\nhe might join the British Army.\nHe was attached to the Flying Corps, and trained at\nvarious centres, receiving his Observer's Wing in November\n1916.\nAs above stated he went immediately to the French\nfront, and had six months' continuous service there. In\nJune 1917 he started his training as a pilot, and obtained\nhis wings in April 1918. In June of that year he went\nout to Italy with the 34th Squadron R.A.r. On 23rd\nJuly he was out on a reconnaissance with four other\naeroplanes. On the return journey his machine dropped\nbehind the rest ; it was thought that he probably did so\nto engage in a fight with an enemy aeroplane. He failed\nto return, and a note was subsequently received from the\nAustrians saying that his machine had been shot down\nand both occupants killed.\nHis body is buried in the British Cemetery at Tezze di\nPiave.\nThe principal sitters are his Mother and Father and a\nfriend of theirs, Miss H. ; his younger brother, J\u2014, had\none S.P. sitting.\n\f68 H.

[PABT\nMiss H.'s connection with the case requires explanation.\nShe has been a close friend of A.'s mother for some years,\nbut they were not acquainted until after his death.\nBefore the beginning of this experiment they had\nheld a number of private sittings with the Ouija board\namong themselves at which A. and Miss H.'s father\npurported to communicate.

A drawing of his mother exhibited at the\nPastel Society in the lifetime of the alleged communicator\nin 1912. Lately rehung after being in garret for three\nyears.\nS.P. 5. When you comes out of your gate Topsy sees\na road not like you sees road here. Topsy sees earth or\nsomething, sort of goes down hill. You goes a long way\ndown hill and then you get long stretch of flat and sort\nof green each side. And there's something little feeding\non right when you get to the flat. Not big cows, some-\nthing little. Going down that road when you get to the\nflat long way down there's a house with a red roof that\nshows so plain.\nNote. The road from our house in California leads\ndown hill about a mile to flat green marsh land.\n\f74 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nHim says Jiim gets lots of music and lots of water,\nand me thinks there's a joke about water, cos when he\nsays water him laughing ; is you afraid water ?\nNote.

Doesnt know what him means but he says\nhim awfully pleased happiness come to you, old chap.\nIts about something nice, something happy coming to\nyour life. . . . Looks like a lady connected with it.\nNote. This is so. Quite true. (The annotator had\nrecently become engaged.)\nThe last words him says is \" My word, you tooked on\nsome responsibility \" and then him laughing.\nNote. This obviously means the Editorship of the ,\na paper. A.'s mother thinks it is more likely a\nreference to the girl, \" an engagement.\"\n1 It is one of the peculiarities of Topsy's pronunciation that she some-\ntimes adds an initial '\nn '\nto words beginning with a vowel or aspirate.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 75\nS.P. 15. Him saj'S liim had. long trousers long before he\nshould have done and you remember how proud he was.\nNote.

It's something makeshift, him\nsays. Me thinks he must have been there when he was\nyounger. Takes Topsy back like few years, and very\nhappy.\nNote. A covered passage between the front and the\nback of the house, the boys used the roof of this\npassage as a means of getting into the back garden when\nthe gate of the passage was locked.\nYou used to be cross with him, something to do bad\nwriting. . . . No, not bad writing, no, not enough writ-\ning and you used to be cross with him and sort of\ncouldn't make him say what you wanted to know.\nNote. I often reproached him for not writing the par-\nticular things that I had asked him about in my own\nlines. He would not aclmowledge parcels or letters for\nweeks. This applies particularly to the time when he\nwas at different training centres in England. From\nFrance and from Italy he WTote often and regularly.\nHim sat on your lap and kisses you, and says still\nyou baby. Him says him used to do that sometimes\nwhen he wasn't shy.\nNote. Characteristic : has used the phrase when living.\nA.S. 31. Him shows me lots of wood, like tree cut\nup. . . . Shows three distinct blocks, him says.\nNote. When my parents and family were all together\nin 1920, my younger son and I spent a great part of\nour time cutting down and sawing up trees. In our\nLondon garden we cut down a tree and made three\nblocks of a part of the trunlv, which blocks we put on\nour hearth at different times to hold a kettle.\n\fH. F. Saltmarsh.

Not much of a cultivated\ngarden\u2014seems more like rough bushes and trees and so\non. I do not knovv^ whether it is a house he has been\nto, or a house his people are at now.\nNote. A photograph of the garden of his mother's\nhouse shows that this description is fairly correct.\nThis boy has a habit of scribbling on all sorts of pieces\nof paper and backs of letters.\nNote. True of A. when living.\nS.P. 26. Him says 3'ou had three pairs new shoes or\nboots, doesn't know which, since here la.st. Him says\nyou are extravagant, but him pleased.\nNote. Quite true. I had one pair on for the first\ntime at the sitting, the other pairs just bought and not\nyet worn at all.\nShows Topsy lots of peas and him laughing. . . . Me\nthinks it's a joke against him ; doesn't know what it is.\nShows lots of peas and laughing, something you and him.\nCan't understand it, can't get it.\nNote. Might this refer to a joke about shelling peas\nat a Convent at Bruges ? He went to school there every\nmorning when he was about six years old, and he was\ngiven the whole of the Convent's peas to shell, and never\ntold the family until afterwards. Later when he was\ngrown up he vised to refer to the Convent as \" where\nthey gave me peas to shell.\"\nDoes you know what him means, says that girl with\nhim got no name.\nNote.

Him says, you birdy still singing in family.\nDoes you understand this joke ? he is laughing. The\nbirdy is old now, but still same as young.\nNote. In May 1918, in lovely warm weather on A.'s\nlast leave he spoke of the \" damned little bird \" that\nwas singing Tirritee-tirritee-tirritee in the garden, \" singing\nas gaily as if there wasn't a war on.\" Ever since, all\nthe rest of the summer when we heard it singing we\nreferred to it as \" A.'s little bird,\" and we have done so\neverj spring since when v,-e have heard it singing.\nS.P. 27. Him laughing about you, you buries some-\nthing and then you digs it up ; it some joke. Looks\nlike you buries something, perhaps you buries flowers and\nthen you digs it up. . . . You got bird or animal been\nill, or you afraid of it being ill.\nNote. This might refer to the tortoise and the diffi-\nculty I had in getting a winter bed for it. It wasn't\nactually bm-ied, but covered over. I put a few dandelions\nnear it in case it hadn't gone to sleep. I thought the\ntortoise looked ill. (This incident had been mentioned in\na previous sitting. The sitter had been disturbed in her\nmind about a tortoise which she thought had no proper\nplace for hibernation.)\nS.P. 27. You had a lot of water in you house, or you\nbeen somewhere where there was a lot of water in house.\nNote. I didn't know this at the time of the sitting.\nOn reaching home I found rain had been coming through\nthe roof and had marked the ceiling.\nA.S. 55. Gets Bubber or Bubbers, Bubber.\nNote. A. saw a great deal of a girl called Bubbles at\none time.\nMe thinks hims mummy mislaid something wears round\nneck and there was such an upset and then it was in\nthe natural place.\nNote. I thought a valuable necklace had been stolen\nfrom my trunk on the way from Italy in the summer of\n\f78 H. F. Saltmarsh. [PABT\n1914. We turned all the luggage upside down and inside\nout, and then found the necklace quite safely tucked\naway.

You got hole in something on stairs. Tored\nor something ; its something a little dangerous. . . .\nDoesn't know, shows something like turned upside down. . . .\nDidn't you have something new on stairs ?\nNote. The bottom step of the steps leading from the\ndrawing-room into the garden had threatened to break\nfor some time before it finally cracked right through.\nBefore the carpenter came to make the necessary repairs\n(three new steps) the bottom step for some days was\nreplaced by a wooden box turned upside down. This\nwas months ago, I can't quite remember when.\nA.S. 89. I don't know, he suddenly laughed and said.\nMother has made a long stay this time. She had about\nsix moves when he was here. This lady probably lived\nin America, or was born in America or her ancestors were\nconnected with America ; I seem to be associated with\nAmerica with her.\nNote. Quite correct.\nS.P. 52.

That old lady\nseemed to be mentally very energetic, but I dont think\n\u2022\nshe could walk very well. I think she must have been\nvery old before she passed out.\n2. Extracts from the X. Case.\nThe ostensible communicator in this case was the\nfather of the sitter. He died on the 16th December,\n1927, at the age of eighty-one. For some years he had\nbeen a complete cripple, having lost the use of his legs\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 81\nowing to accidents in which both his hips were fractured.\nHe passed his life in bed or in an invalid chair. He\nwas sometimes taken out in a wheeled chair. Before his\naccident he had been a clever and successful professional\nman, and was referred to in a letter of condolence to his\nwidow as \" a kindly humorous Scotsman.\" Miss X., the sitter,\nwrites\n:\nAfter a most successful career he had a great amount\nof bad luck, and after this seemed to lose his nerve and\nself-confidence and never regained them. This quite\nruined his career, and he lost all his connection. This\nparticularly affected his son, who was in the same pro-\nfession and hoped to succeed him. . . . All this was before\nhe had his accidents and broke his hips.\nAs a result of his losses and sufferings he became\nmorose, irritable and difficult to live with, he brooded\non his misfortunes and lost his grip on life. This was\nthe cause of a great deal of unhappiness to his wife and\nfamily. In Topsy's words, which are said by the anno-\ntator to be quite true, \" He had funny moods,\" \" His\nmentality seemed queer and crochetty,\" \" Very often at\nyour happiest times he would suddenly say something\nand make you all unhappy and spoil your pleasure.\"\n\" Seems like he turned against everybody.\" He caused\nmany \" upsets.\"\nAs will be seen from the extracts the general tone of\nthe communications is one of remorse for his unkindness\nand a desire for forgiveness. He is described as a man\nof simple tastes and few wants. During the latter part\nof his life he never handled money. He was reserved\nand undemonstrative as a rule, but had rare moments\nwhen he showed his affection for his family.\nHe used to read a good deal, latterly mainly short\nstories and magazines. He was accustomed to sit hunched\nup in his chair, his chin almost on his chest, he hardly\never raided his head, so much so that some of his visitors\nremarked that they had rarely seen his face. He was\nnaturally a man of great physical strength and of fine\najDpearance, of great breadth of chest though rather short\nof stature.\n\fS2 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nHe died, not as a result of the injuries to his hips\nbut from a stroke; his last illness was of short\nduration.\n(a) Extracts concerning the ostensible communicator, Ids health\nconditions, etc.\nA.S. 47. Some one who couldn't do much, not only ill\nbut couldn't use arms perhaps or legs, Somehow ifeels\ndifficult to move.\nMe feels that gentleman was sort of ill and yet not ill\n\u2014could have done things with his head.\nA.S. 49. Him crossed over hke suddenly, him ill long\ntune but him crossed over suddenly-like only short time\n111 before him crossed. Him crossed over not like from\nwhat him had been ill with all the time. Him says\nhim glad to go really 'cause great trial to be tied like\nthat. Him says not being able to use his legs was much\nmore to him than pain. Him couldn't walk, couldn't do\nthings for himself for several years.\nS.P. 36. Feel him can't do anything very much, only\nto read and things like that and grumble.\nTopsy me doesn't feel ill, gives the feehng doesn't feel\nill and yet him ill for a long time.\nKeeps on hearing the Avord \"Stroke.\"\nMe doesnt think that gentleman ill so people expected\nhim to cross over. Him seems to have crossed sudden\nWot sudden in half an hour like that, but sort of dif-\nferent kind of illness him suffered from.\nA.S 76. Him still resting and you would think that\nhim didnt need rest after all the rest him was obliged\nto take. ^\nS P. 42. (Referring to his invalid chair.)

I seem to get conditions of an invalid, a\ncripple of some description. ... I don't seem ill and yet\nI feel helpless, as if I am wheeled and lifted about.\nI seem to feel that my life is spent either in bed or\nin a chair, and in each case I seem to be put there and\ntaken out.\n1 should say that he had a very good brain before\nthis accident or something which deprived him of the\nmovement of his lower limbs. If he has gone over it\nis not as a result connected \\\\'ith this disability that I\nhave been speaking of. Since that disability he had\nsome land of sudden illness, but whether he passed over\nin it I cannot say.\n;) Other extracts.\nA.S. 47. You had an upset in your house. . . .

You used to try to be\nfirm with him and yet you used to comfort him.

But him could not help himself, it was\na very bad life not to be out in the sunshine without\ndepending on someone.\nHim wants to give hims love to you's mummy and tell\nher how grateful him is for all she done for him and\nhim really was\u2014in hims better moments when him was\nhere\u2014grateful. Him very anxious that she be happy and\nenjoy life after such long years of strain.\nHim was not a rich man and him considers him was\nnot a lucky man. Every thing him had him had to\nwork very hard to get. Whatever him done, him seemed\nsort of to give nearly all hims life to, and then when\nhim could not do it any longer, him sort of lost. That\nsomething to do with the disturbances him made and\ncaused you lot of pain, and you got not quite to dislike\nhim but sort of to feel cross.\nThing him seems most anxious about is to know that\nhim loves you and always did love you and him wants\nyou to forgive him.

There is a portrait of my Uncle when much\nyounger holchng baby against his knee, and family grouped\nround.\nS.P. 46. And gets a word like Moon or Moons.\nNote. The sitter's name was Miss Moon (pseudonym\n\u2014\nthe correct name was actually given).\nShe brought you lots of those little lilies.\nIt means something, either yow very fond or she very\nfond of them. Its something particular.\nSitter. Well, can you tell me if when I smeJl these\nlilies round me, she has brought them ?\nYes, particularly one night when you was in front of\nglass somewhere, does you remember ?\nSiTTEE.. In front of glass.\nYou know, what you does your hair in front of.\nSitter. Yes, that's quite right.\nIt was very strong and you looked round.\nNote. This is very interesting, as sometimes I have a\nvery strong scent of lilies near me, and I have never\nbeen able to account for it.\n(Miss Newton's note.) This impressed Miss Moon very\nmuch. The fact of her getting impressions of a strong\nscent of lilies was known to several people before the\nsitting.\nS.P. 16. Something wrong with your shoes or with\nyour stockings, doesn't know, him laughs, and then him\nshows pile of things, something for feet.\nSiTTEE.

Yes.\nLittle while ago somebody did them for you.\nSitter. Yes, that's right.\nNot going to have such luck this time.\nNote. This seems very good to me. I hardly ever\ndarn my own stockings, but my usual darner was too\nbusy at the time, so a dreadful heap of vari-coloured\nstockings which I had tried in vain to tackle accumu-\nlated till I had suddenly no holeless pair left, and had\nto dash out and buy some new ones. I don't think this\nhas ever happened before. After washing the stockings\nand getting them all ready in a heap, workbox and all\ncomplete, I even failed to do them.\nS.P. 40. (Same sitter as above.) You had to go out\nnot long ago and had to buy stockings quickly, him says.\nNote. This is interesting, for another incident exactly\nsimilar to this one was described in my first sitting.\nI vowed I wouldn't let my undarned stockings accumulate\nagain. I felt really ashamed of myself, but had to hurry\nout and buy some more.

Those\ngiven are fairly representative of the whole.\nII.\nStatistics relatikg to the Whole Series of\nSittings.\nThe following are some statistics concerning the whole\nseries of sittings and the various classifications which\nhave been made with selected sub-cases.\nThere were in all 142 sittings ; of these 53 were Sitter\nPresent. These are classified as 46 successes, 5 failures,\n1 sitting rejected because the sitter gave away too much,\nand 1 special experimental sitting which yielded no result.\nThere were 89 Absent Sitter sittings\u201429 were ordinary\nsuccesses, 9 were intrusion sittings, 3 were special experi-\nmental sittings, 42 had to be counted as failures, 1 was\nrejected on account of the unsatisfactory nature of the\nannotations, and 5 were pseudo-intrusions, that is to say,\nthe communicator connected with the notetaker intruded.\nThese latter really count as Sitter Present sittings, and\nin the following figures their scores have been included\nin that category.\nOf the 42 failures in the A.S. type there was often\nsome small amount of matter which could, at a stretch,\nhave been considered as veridical ; in some the failure\nalmost certainly arose from the side of the annotator, in\nothers there is some suggestion of an intrusion, but not\nsufficiently definite to enable it to be classed as such.\nIt is also possible that some cases of intrusion have been\noverlooked.\n\f90 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nFor the whole series of sittings the scores for successful\nsittings are approximately as follows :\nTotal possible. Gross score. Net score.\nAbsent sitter - 2645 1247 1116 = 42-2%\nSitter present - 5782 4204 4002 = 69-2%\n8427 5451 5118 = 60-7%\nFrom what has just been said concerning the nature\nof the failures in the A.S. sittings it will be readily\nappreciated that it was not always possible to score these\nin the same way as the ordinary sittings. One can,\ntherefore, only form an estimate of what the percentage\nscore for absent sittings would be had all the failures\nbeen included. It is estimated that it would have\nbeen somewhere between 20% and 30%. If the failures\namong the S.P. sittings had been included in the per-\ncentage score it would have been reduced to about 65%.\nSometimes at an A.S. sitting two relics were used\nbelonging to different contributors : such a sitting should\nreally be counted as two separate sittings. Again, there\nis one case where a double intrusion occurs, and another\nwhere a sitting which starts as a complete failure\ndevelops at the very end into a particularly good pseudo-\nintrusion. All these peculiarities render it impossible to\ndo more than give approximate figures.\nEight separate sub-cases were selected as being suit-\nable for special treatment, as described on page 7 ; these\ncomprised 79 sittings in all, of which 39 were S.P. and\n40 A.S.\nThe following are figures showing the numbers of the\nvarious classes of statements as before described.\nAnte-mortem.

[part\nsittings is double or more than double that in A.S.\nThat the ante-mortem and jjost-mortem statements are\nabout equal in number, the veridicality of the latter\nbeing, if anything, slightly higher. That the physical\nstatements exceed in number the non-physical, but have\na lower percentage of veridicality. That the statements\nconcerning the communicator are more frequent in the\nante-mortem, and those concerning the sitter in the\npost-mortem.\nBeyond this we cannot go ;\nany deductions based on\nthe actual figures and depending on their accuracy would\nbe quite untrustworthy.\nIII.\nSome General Theoretical Considerations.\nAt an early stage of this case the writer drew up a\nkind of programme of points to be inquired into and\ntentative hypotheses, suggested by the evidence, so far as\nit had gone, to be tested by further investigation.\nFrom the point of view of theory the investigation is\ndivided into two parts : 1st, psychological ;\n2nd, psychical\nresearch proper. In the first part it is sought to throw\nsome light upon and suggest tentative hypotheses to\naccount for the psychological mechanism of trance medium-\nship, leaving out of the question the source of the informa-\ntion given ;\nthe second part deals with that source, and\nis approached in the form of a discussion of the various\nhypotheses which have from time to time been put\nforward.\nThe division is not, of course, absolute, the two parts\nhaving an intimate relation to each other and their\nrespective provinces overlapping to some extent. .,\nThe psychological side will be treated first.\nThe programme above referred to is quoted from, and\nthe tentative answers to the questions raised are given\nwith, supporting evidence from the sittings where possible.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 03\nA. Psychological.\nSection I.\nThe first point to be enquired into is how far there is\nevidence for the prevalence of the following :\n(a) Deliberate invention.\nIt is, of course, impossible to pronounce with certainty\non this matter, but it may be said that there is no\napparent evidence of deliberate invention on the part of\nthe medivim. The only thing that might suggest it\nis the occurrence in some sittings of certain rather\nhackneyed statements, that is to say, remarks of a kind\ncommon in trance-mediuniship and of such a nature\nas to be generally acceptable to any sitter. Some of these\nhave been classed as cliches, and this has been done\nwhen the type is of a definite and particular as dis-\ntinguished from a general nature. Instances of cliches\nwill be given and discussed later. There are also a\nnumber of remarks of a more general type, such as\nreferences to the alleged spirit helping the sitter, being\nwith the sitter at various times, to the sitter going over\nto \" the other side \" during sleep, to the sitter being\nworried, sad, tired, ill and so on. They are statements\nwhich either are not susceptible of verification or are of so\ncommonplace a nature that they stand a good chance of\nbeing a lucky shot if the medium were inventing.\nThere are also a number of statements which might be\nconsidered as obvious inferences from what has gone\nbefore, e.g. when the ostensible communicator is a young\nman it is fairly safe to say that he was fond of sport.\nNow it may be that those and similar statements are\ndeliberate inventions, and if the communications consisted\nsolely of them we should undoubtedly be justified in dis-\nmissing the case as valueless ; but when they are com-\nbined with evidential matter of a superior kind it seems\nscarcely reasonable to discount them altogether just\nbecause they are commonplace. It is not fair to condemn\nthe medium for giving these commonplace communica-\ntions, especially if they happen to be veridical, for, just\n\f94 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nbecause they are commonplace, they are veridical if\napplied to most people, and in consequence tend to be\nfrequently given.\nTo be perfectly just, the complete absence or relative\nscarcity of any such commonplace remarks from a sitting\nwould be more open to suspicion than the presence of a\nnormal amount, for then one might suspect the medium\nof deliberately selecting evidence which would sound\nimpressive.\nWhen so much that is commonplace is true of most of\nus it would be strange if a great deal of it did not turn\nup in the sittings.\nThe point is not of first importance, as the evidential\nvalue of the communications of this type is never very\nhigh, and their total disqualification would not greatly\naffect the result.\nIn view of the above, and in the absence of any\ndirect evidence of deliberate invention, it must be held\nnot to exist.\nIn this connection the following incident should be\nmentioned. Miss X.,i who had acted as notetaker at a\nnumber of sittings, had been introduced to the medium\nunder a pseudonym. She lives in the same neighbour-\nhood as the medium, or rather did do so\u2014the latter has\nsince moved. On one occasion they met at the Bank.\nMiss X.'s account of the matter is as follows :\nIt must be mentioned that about 5h months ago IMrs.\nElliott met me and my dog Billy in Barclays Bank, Wel-\nlington Road. It was only for about a minute, as I hastily\nsaid \" How do you do ?\n\" and beat a retreat, as I was sorry\nshe had met me and would know I lived in the neighbour-\nhood. She, of course, saw my dog, and I am practically\ncertain she heard me call him by name when I called him\nto go out with me. She might, therefore, easily have remem-\nbered his ai^pearance and his name, which gives a normal\nexplanation to her description here of my dog, though I\nmust say she could only have had a hasty glance at him in\nso short a time.\n1 See also p. 80, the X case.\n\f112] Sittings loith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 95\nThe sitting to which this note is attached was dated\n3rd June, 1927, so that the incident must have happened\nin January of the same year. The sitting in question\nwas an A.S. one, in which Miss X.'s communicator\nintruded ; much information was given about the dog.\nIt is, of course, possible that Mrs. Elliott seized the\nopportimity of making enquiries as to Miss X.'s identity,\nand acquired by normal means some information concern-\ning her family affairs.\nThere is, however, absolutely no evidence that this was\nthe case ;\nmoreover, some of the information given is such\nthat it could hardly have been acquired except by per-\nsistent enquiry from persons intimate with the family.\nHad such enquiries been made it could hardly have\nfailed to come to Miss X.'s knowledge.\nIn any case it would not apply to the A.S. sitting\ngiven with a relic supplied by Miss X., in which very\ngood results were obtained. There was, of course, nothing\nto lead the medium to connect this particular relic with\nher.\nEven if this somewhat unfortunate occurrence be held to\ndiscount the value of this particular set of sittings it cannot\nbe deemed to affect any other set ; and since the evi-\ndence given in this set is not different in character or\nquality from many of the other sittings one can say that\nthere is no evidence of any illegitimate methods having\nbeen used.\nThe incident had to be mentioned, but it is not thought\nthat any great importance attaches to it.\nIt may be as well to repeat that there is not the\nslightest suggestion of suspicion that Mi-s. Elliott has ever\nin any way diverged from the path of strictest rectitude.\n(6) Fishing.\nBy this term is meant any deliberate attempt on the\npart of the medium or control to obtain information from\nthe sitter by means of questions, suggestions, skilful\ntwisting of meanings, and so on.\nIn S.P. sittings, while it is possible that Topsy does\nsometimes resort to this practice, the occasions on which\n\f96 H. F. SaltmarsTi. [part\nit might be suspected are relatively few. On the whole,\nit may be said that Topsy does not fish, although she\ngropes, a term explained in the next sub-section. It often\nhappens that when some subject is being mentioned by\nher, and it seems to the reader of the record as though\na little judicious fishing would yield fruitful results, Topsy\nwill suddenly drop the matter and jump abruptly to\nanother topic.\nIn A.S. sittings fishing is obviously impossible, there\nbeing no one present from whom to fish.\n(c) Grojnncj.\nUndoubtedly there is a great deal of groping. It is\nquite obvious, and no attempt is made to conceal it.\nTopsy frequently admits that she does not understand\nwhat is \" being given,\" and she supplies alternative\ninterpretations. For example, \" Me doesnt know whether\nhim is first son or only son or only one left.\" There is\na wide difference between groping and fishing ; the first\nis what might naturally be expected where so much\nsymbolism is employed : the second implies a deliberate\nattempt to obtain results by illegitimate means.\nIt does not appear that Topsy always knows when she\nhas hit on the correct interpretation of a symbol apart\nfrom any information given her by the sitter in S.P.\nsittings ; it follows, therefore, that in many cases the\nstatements are left in the form of alternatives.\nThe question of groping is of importance as bearing on\nthe matter of symbolism, and will be referred to again\nwhen dealing with that point.\n[d] Name, number and similar habits.\nAn analysis of the names and initials mentioned in the\nsittings seems to indicate very clearly that some such\nhabits exist in the medium. Taken as a whole the names\nand initials have very little evidential value, though there\nare a few instances where this is not the case. If they\nare regarded as being of purely fortuitous origin, that is\nto say, fragments thrown up by the dream stratum, one\nwould expect to find that the relative frequency of the\ncommoner names corresponded with their actual frequency\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 97\nin real life. Even if the names were all veridical this\ncorrespondence should still hold good, for the number of\npersons mentioned, either as ostensible communicators or\nconnected with them, is sufficiently large to ensure an\naverage distribution of common names.\nNow the relative frequency of the common names given\ndoes not correspond with their normal frequency of occur-\nrence ; it appears, therefore, that there is some disturbing\nfactor at work. This factor seems most likely to be in\nthe nature of a habit ; the medium has an unconscious\npredilection for certain names and initials, which causes\nthem to be thrown up more frequently than they would\nbe by pure chance ;\nthis habit would be of the same\nkind as those habits which have been discovered in card\nguessing.\nIn order to arrive at an estimate of the relative fre-\nquency of common Christian names, a list was made of\nabout forty-five or so of the male names which occur in\nthe sittings, and the number of times which these names\nwere found among the pupils of a large public school\nover a period of thirty years was counted, being some\n3500 names in all.\nThe following is the result\nPublic Public\nSittings.

There are no\nAlfreds, Herberts, Ernests or Walters, all of which are\nvery common names. James is rather in excess, Maurice,\nMichael and Peter very much so ; while Roger gets 12\nmentions in the sittings, whereas he should have only -4.\nThe girls' names have not been analysed in the same\nway, but it is pretty clear from inspection that we should\nfind the same thing among them. Names commencing\nwith A. M. and R. seem to be her favourities ; these\nletters, together with J. and W., are the most common\namong the initials given in the sittings.\nThe medium has a curious tendency to give names\nbeginning with the sound Rod or Roj, e.g. Roger, Rodney,\nRoderam, Roddin, Rodville or Rodvalley, Roderick ; also\nRobinson, Rosalind, Robert and Rosamund, which have a\nsomewhat similar sound. Fifteen out of the twenty names\nbeginning with S. commence with St.\nThere are many extraordinary names given, e.g. Bwavo\nor Bravo as the name of a house, Borra Cue or Borrel\ncue, Capachon, Conweiller, Ebda, Geutlog, Jut, Mordicot,\nNarronger or Oronga, Orndewa, Orloch, Ormerod, Oup-\nlough, Oshon, Pongee, Pergelos, Roderam, Rodvalley,\nRuthleben. It will be observed that these oddities are\nconcentrated around the \" 0.\" No normal associations\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 99\ncan be found to account for these names, except perhaps\nRuthleben may mean Ruhleben and Roderam Rotterdam,\nthough there is nothing in the context to suggest associa-\ntion with these places. They look to be merely fantastic\nnonsense names thrown up by the dream consciousness.\nA parallel may be found in the nonsense words of children.\nThe fact that so many begin with \" 0 \" may arise from\nan infantile association in the mind of the medium with\nher own maiden surname, viz. Ortner.\n(e) Dream.\nWhile there are few instances of S.P. sittings being\ncomplete failures there are a good number of A.S. sittings\nwhere the contributor of the relic was unable to recognise\nanything as relevant. Some of these have proved to be\nintrusions, and one or two appear to consist largely of\nfragments of reminiscences from previous sittings. There\nis, however, a large amount of matter which cannot be\nassigned to either of these sources.\nA few experiments were tried by sending as relics\nabsolutely new articles which had no connection with\nanybody, except in so far as they were manufactured\narticles, sold at a shop, and handled and packed by the\ncontributor. In all these cases a considerable amount of\nmatter was given, none of which could be recognised as\nin any way relevant by the contributor of the pseudo-\nrelic. This matter was precisely similar in style and\ncharacter with that given in other sittings. In most\ncases Topsy recognised that the purporting communicator\nwas not connected with the relic.\nThe most probable explanation in these cases, and of\nthe unrecognisable matter in the ordinary sittings, is that\nit is a kind of dream stuff, a spontaneous production of\nsome stratum of the medium's sub-consciousness. In\nmany respects it is more analogous to hypnagogic visions\nthan to dream proper ; for example, it lacks the coherence\nand pseudo-logical sequence of the dream ; Topsy jumps\nabruptly from one subject to another with no discoverable\nassociative linkage. There is reason to think that a\nlarge part of the impressions are, for her, in the form of\n\f100 H. F. Saltmarsh. [PAET\nvisual hallucinations. In both these respects the analogy\nis closer to hypnagogic vision than to dream proper.\nIt seems, then, a plausible hypothesis that the sub-\nstratum of the trance material, the matrix in which we\noccasionally find embedded veridical communications, is a\nsequence of internally generated hallucinations analogous\nto hypnagogic visions. These are probably partly built\nup of fragmentary reminiscences of previous sittings and\npartly from the normal experiences of the medium.\n(\/) Reminiscence.\nAs already noted when discussing dream stuff there is a\nconsiderable amount of this. It is impossible to draw a\ndefinite line between reminiscence and intrusion, although\nin some cases, where fresh facts are given, reminiscence,\nproperly speaking, seems to be excluded.\nIt is not suggested that reminiscence is a conscious\nprocess : there is no ground whatsoever for supposing\nthat Mi's. Elliott or Topsy deliberately serves up a rehash\nof old matter ; it seems rather as though fragmentary\nmemories of past sittings lingered in some stratum of her\nsub-sconsciousness, and became interwoven with the dream\nstuff which constitutes the non-veridical portions of the\ncommunications.\nAs a general rule it has been possible to recognise\ndefinitely as reminiscences only those instances which refer\nto communicators of this series, but there is one case\nwhere Mrs. Elliott herself supplied the clue which led to\nthe recognition of the source in a lady who had had\nsittings several years previously, and with whom she had\nbeen on friendly terms. In this case, however, fresh\nmatter was given, and it should, therefore, be classed as\nan intrusion, though it is possible that some reminiscence\nis mingled with the new facts (S.P. 48).\nStill, the incident suggests strongly that reminiscences\nfrom sittings not of this series may form a considerable\npart of the non-veridical matter. It is, of course, impos-\nsible to determine how much is attributable to this cause,\nbut the question is not of great importance, seeing that\nit is of fragments of memories that dream stuff is largely\nmade up.\n\f112] Sittings tvith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 101\n(g) Deferred impression.\nThere is a further possibility which has to be taken\ninto account in cleahng with the non-veridical matter.\nIt may be that the medium receives impressions at a\nsitting which do not rise to the surface during that\nsitting, but remain latent in her subconsciousness until\nsome subsequent occasion. Where the matter is recog-\nnisable as referring to some known person, such as a\nprevious communicator, the explanation of deferred impres-\nsion as against that of intrusion rule, possible,\nand but for one fortunate incident it might have appeared\nto be more in consonance with scientific method to\nascribe all these cases to deferred impression. We know\nfrom other sources that deferred impressions do occur,\nand rather than postulate an entirely fresh type of pheno-\nmenon for which we have little or no independent evidence,\nthat is to say, intrusion, we should be bound to prefer\nthem as explanation.\nIt fortunately happens that an incident occurred in one\nsitting which prevents us from falling into this error, and\nalthough in the rest of the cases it may be impossible to\ndecide definitely between the two hypotheses, we are\nbound to admit intrusion as a vera causa.\nThe incident was as follows : A.S. 73 was a sitting\nheld with an article contributed by Sir Lawrence Jones ;\nthe record contained nothing that he could recognise.\nOne of the physical descriptions, however, suggested A.,\nthe communicator in the A case (see p. 66), and the\nrecord was sent to his mother for annotation. A con-\nsiderable amount of veridical matter was found.\nMany of the statements appear to refer to Miss H\n(see p. 68) : for example, the name S , which is her\nprofessional name, the initials H. and P., the first cor-\nresponding with her surname, the latter standing for a\nversion of her Christian name, by which she is commonly\nknown ; other references confirm this. The important\nstatement is as follows : \"That lady that him so fond\nof, she been very worried and then kind of cold came\nand made her ill. She been ill and been away. Gets a\nname like S .\"\n\f102 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nHis mother writes : \" P was worried, caught a\nchill and fainted in my drawing-room. This was before\nshe went to Paris, where she was on the day of the\nsitting. She was there for only a few days. S is\nher professional name.\" Enquiries were made from Miss\nH as to the approximate date of the fainting. She\nreplied : \"I think it would be two or three weeks before\nI left for Paris when I fainted in Mrs. F 's house.\n(April 4th, 1927, I left London for Paris.\") The date of\nthe sitting is 8th April, 1927.\nNow there had been no sitting with any member of\nthis group since IGth February, 1927 (S.P. 30). It would\nseem, therefore, that the reference is to an event which\nhappened after the date of the last sitting, in which case\nit cannot be ascribed either to reminiscence or to deferred\nimpression.\nIt may be objected that the evidence is slender, and\nto some extent the objection is well founded. There are,\nhowever, five separate items in the statement, all of which\nare veridical.\n1st. 'The lady hims so fond of.\" Now, although Miss\nH and A. had never met in the flesh, one of the\nmost striking features of this set of sittings is the growth\nof a posthumous friendship between the two. Whether\nthis is really what it purports to be, viz. a friendship\ngrown up between a living person and the surviving\nspirit of a deceased boy, or whether it is only a romance\nconceived in the brain of some living person, is not in\npoint here ; the fact remains that the sittings unmistak-\nably display the idea. If it be nothing else it is a\ncorrespondence with other sittings with the same and other\nmediums.\n2nd. The lady has been worried. This is in itself not\nat all convincing : it has been said before in connection\nwith Miss H several times.\n3rd. A cold came.\n4th. She had been ill.\n5th. She had been away.\nAll the last three are extremely commonplace, but when\ncombined with the rest have some evidential value.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 103\nHowever it is only by a very rare lucky chance that\nan incident of this kind can occur, and such as it is it\nshould be given its full weight. The balance between\nthe two hypotheses, deferred impression and intrusion,\nhangs evenly ; there is nothing, apart from the methodo-\nlogical considerations mentioned above, to tip the scale\non either side ; it follows, therefore, that any piece of\npositive evidence will serve to establish as provisionally\nacceptable that hypothesis which it favours.\nIt must be emphasised that all hypotheses suggested are\nonly tentative, the evidence in no case is sufficiently\nstrong to enable us to go any further.\nSection II. The Effect of Various Influences.\nThe next set of topics to which attention must now be\nturned is the following.\nWhat is the influence of the following factors ?\n(a) The sitter according to type.\nThere are certain well-defined tjrpes of sitter in this\ncase.\n1st. We have the emotionally bereaved, that is to say,\nthose who have recently experienced the loss, through\ndeath, of a dearly loved relative or friend, and whose\nconsciousness is largely occupied with the sorrowful\nemotions arising from that loss.\n2nd. The ordinarily bereaved. Those who, having\nsuffered such a loss, have either partially recovered from\nthe first poignancy of their grief by the passage of time,\nor who, from their temperament or the circumstances of\nthe case, have never had their consciousness comj)letely\nfilled with sorrowful emotion.\n3rd. The non-bereaved. Those who have suffered no\nrecent loss, or having lost a friend or relative have not\nsuffered intense grief.\n4th. The convinced. Those who already accept the\nhypothesis of survival of the personality and the possi-\nbility of communication.\n5th. The unconvinced. Those who preserve an open\nmind on the subject, not having been able, on the\n\f104 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nevidence which has come their way, to arrive at a definite\ndecision. This class would include many different grades,\nranging from the nearly convinced to those whose scepti-\ncism falls just short of categorical denial. The will to\nbelieve and the will to disbelieve are both liable to be\nvery strong in this matter.\nIt should be noted that, with the exception of the\nmost advanced sceptics, the attitude towards the survival\nand communication hypothesis has little to do with any\nbelief in a future life held on religious grounds.\n6th. To comj)lete the list, though it is doubtful whether\nthis series can exhibit an example of this type, the con-\nfirmed disbeliever must be included. This would be one\nwho definitely denies survival in any form, and, of course,\nas a necessary corollary, the possibility of communication.\n(Note.\u2014It is difficult to choose a name for the disbeliever\nwhich has not a kind of reproachful flavour due to the\ninfluence of religious thought over the popular mind. No\nsuch connotation is, of course, intended here. Disbelief\nis equally to be respected as belief : in fact, for the\nPsychical Researcher a certain amount of scepticism\nmight be regarded as desirable.)\nThese various classes of sitters, of which any of the\nfirst three may be combined with any of the last three,\ncan be classified again under three other headings.\n1st. Good sitters, i.e. those whose sittings as a rule yield\na good percentage of veridical matter. 2nd. Moderate\nsitters, those whose average results are moderate, either\nconsistently in every sitting or by the combination of\nsome good with some poor. 3rd. Bad sitters, i.e. those\nwhose sittings are all either complete failures or of poor\nquality.\nThe point to be determined is whether there is any\nrelation between the classes in the first classification and\nthose in the second.\nIt is obvious in the first place that the emotionally\nbereaved sitter will probably have a strong will to believe\nin survival, and hence will tend to come into the class 4,\ni.e. the convinced. This fact will almost certainly show\nits influence in the annotations. Those who are con-\n\f112] Sittings ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 105\nvinced, or are strongly desirous of being convinced, will\nmore readily see and seize u])on correspondences between\nstatements in the sittings and their own experience.\nThey will treat as an evidential point that which would\nbe passed over by the sceptic or disbeliever as a trivial\nchance-coincidence unworthy of notice. This tendency is\nplainly shown in the annotations. Some of the anno-\ntators who are known to belong to class 4, i.e. the con-\nvinced, exercise, quite unconsciously, very great ingenuity\nin the interpretation of the evidence, much of what they\nap23ear to consider as veridical would seem to the sceptic\nas farfetched and strained.\nOn the other hand, it is not unlikely that a similar\ndegree of ingenuity in evading the conclusion of veridi-\ncality may be exercised by the sceptic ;\nbut, seeing that,\nas a general rule, they either maintain silence or pass\nover the statement in question with a plain negative, it\nis impossible to obtain definite evidence on this point.\nThere is a further point in this connection. In S.P.\nsittings the convinced sitter is apt to give more encourage-\nment to Topsy than the sceptic, and there can be no\ndoubt that this factor influences the quality of the sitting\nto a large degree. Topsy is very susceptible to the\nattitude of the sitter, whether sympathetic or the reverse,\nshe is easily discouraged by repeated failure to recognise\nher statements as veridical. She sometimes says that\nshe cannot go on if the sitter does not recognise any\nof the persons she describes.\nIt is possible that this absence of encouragement which\nmust necessarily occur in A.S. sittings is responsible to\nsome extent for the consistently lower percentage of\nveridicality which is found in them as compared with the\nS.P., although it cannot be held to be the sole cause of\nthe phenomenon.\nAgain, a convinced sitter is more liable to give away\ninformation than is the sceptic ; an example of this may\nbe found in one S.P. sitting, which had to be rejected\nas entirely valueless owing to the fact that the sitter\nappeared to give away to Topsy more information than\nhe received from her.\n\f106 H. F. Salfmarsh. [part\nApart from these considerations there seems little ground\nfor thinking that the class of sitter has any relation to\nthe quality of the evidence. No doubt there are certain\ncharacteristics which constitute a good sitter, but they are\nnot those on which the present classification is founded.\nFrom the data available it has not been found possible\nto make any suggestions as to v\/hat these characteristics\nmay be.\nOut of seven good sitters, selected as having obtained\nthe most consistently high score, three are convinced,\nthree must be regarded as being more or less sceptical,\nand one is doubtful. Of the three convinced one is\nemotionally bereaved. Two of the best sitters are rather\nmarkedly of a critical frame of mind, having considerable\nknowledge of psychical research, and being thus able to\nestimate the value of the evidence as it is given. This\ncapability would tend to check any great emotional\nexcitement during the sitting, such as might be aroused\nin a sitter of less critical disposition.\nOut of six moderate sitters, two are convinced, one\nsceptical, three doubtful. Out of five poor sitters, one is\nconvinced and emotionally bereaved, two sceptical, two\ndoubtful.\nThus there seems to be no constant relation between\nthe quality of the sitter as good, moderate and poor and\nthe characteristics under which they have been classed,\nviz. convinced or sceptical, emotionally bereaved, and so\non.\nAmongst the sitters were seven who were known to\npossess some psychic faculties. Of these seven, two were\ndefinitely good, two were moderate but nearly good, one\nwas poor but nearly moderate, one was definitely poor,\nand one a complete failure. Here, again, there seems no\nconstant relation.\nThe next j^oint to be considered is the relation between\nthe quality of the A.S. sittings and the S.P. in regard\nto the sitter. Here, again, we can find no coijstant relation.\nThere is only one instance where the sitter is con-\nsistently good in both A.S. and S.P. sittings, but unfor-\ntunately the number of A.S. sittings was small. With\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 107\nthe good S.P. sitters we find fairly numerous instances\nof complete failure in A.S.\nIn no case can it be said that the A.S. sittings with\nany sitter (except that just mentioned where the number\nof A.S. sittings is too small to judge from) are consistently\ngood, though in some cases they are consistently bad.\nIt may be concluded then that the conditions which\ndetermine the success or otherwise of the A.S. sittings do\nnot relate to the characteristics of the contributor of the\nrelic, considered as an absent sitter.\n(6) The notetaker.\nThere were only four different notetakers employed in\nthis series of sittings ; it is, therefore, impossible to draw\nany definite conclusions as to any influence exerted by this\nfactor. There is, however, some slight suggestion that such\ninfluence does occur. The fact that Topsy fairly fre-\nquently refers to the affairs of the notetaker seems to\nshow that she is not entirely indifferent.\nIn the case of one notetaker Mrs. Elliott expressed the\nopinion that she was too \" positive \" in character to be\nideal for the purpose, and it is noteworthy that we find\nconsiderable evidence in some of the sittings at which\nshe took notes of the intrusion of her own ostensible\ncommunicator. She proved also to be one of the best\nsitters.\nThere are numerous instances of references made to\ncurrent events connected with the notetaker, and this\nseems to occur quite irrespective of whoever may be\nacting as such at the time. They look like examples of\nsporadic telepathy or clairvoyance (to use two indeter-\nminate names for a faculty for acquiring supernormal\nknowledge), and are probably analogous in character to\nthe numerous references to Miss Newton's recent thoughts\nor actions obtained through Mrs. Elliott and Mrs. Leonard.\n(Some of these have been published in Proc. S.P.B.\nVol. XXXVI., p. 190 ff.)\nOf the four notetakers the bulk of the work was done\nby two of them, the others acted on six and seven\noccasions respectively.\n\f108 H. F.

In one case, where the relic was a\ndog-collar, Topsy talks a great deal about dogs, but gives\nnothing which can be recognised as veridical. Before\ngoing into trance on this occasion Mrs. Elliott remarked\nthe object felt like a slave bangle.\nA large number of the objects used as relics are of\nsuch a nature that they give no indication of the type\nof person to whom they had belonged, even whether\nmale or female, e.g. such things as purses, eyeglasses,\nletters, pens, pencils, and so on. Some are definitely\nmasculine, such as cuff-links, ties, etc. ; some definitely\nfeminine, as pendants and bracelets. While there are\nmany instances where the sex of the ostensible communicator\ncorresponds with that of the original owner of the relic there\nare others where this is not the case, for example, in\nA.S. 40, where the article was a pair of gold cuff-links,\nand the communications purported to come from an\nelderly lady.\nIt may be concluded with a fair degree of certainty\nthat the nature of the relic has little if any bearing on\nthe matter given at the sitting. Mrs. Elliott has some\ndefinite objections to certain types of article, for example,\nshe does not like knives, though the reason for this is\nnot obvious. She also does not care for written matter,\nprobably because there might be a suggestion that she\nobtained normal information by surreptitiously reading it.\nIt may be remarked here that she is most scrupulous to\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 109\navoid any possibility of obtaining normal information.\nGood results have, however, been obtained from such\narticles as letters, but in no case is there any reason to\nthink that the statements made at the sitting bear any\nrelation to the contents of the letters. She also objects\nto any article which has been often washed or handled\nby a great number of people She probably holds what\nis called the psychometric theory, that is to say, the\ntheory that physical objects retain traces from which a\nsensitive can derive information concerning their past\nhistory, which would account for her prejudice in this\nrespect.\nIn some cases the package in which the relic was\nenclosed was not opened by the medium, and good\nresults have been obtained. It is not always possible to\nsay whether the nature of the article could have been\njudged by feel alone in these cases, but in one case at\nleast the article was such that the sense of touch could\nnot have given any definite knowledge of its nature.\nThe sitting in question, A.S. 16, gave a high percentage of\nveridicality, the relic being a knitted necktie. This is most\nprobably a masculine article, but it is hard to believe that\nthe mere feel of it through the packing would be sufficient\nto enable anyone to say more than that it was some\ncomparatively small soft article, possibly knitted. For\nexample, it might have been a necktie, which is masculine,\nor the waist-belt of a knitted silk jumper, which is\nfeminine.\nSometimes Topsy starts with the package unopened, and\nthen, finding that she does not get along very well,\nopens it. The instances in which this happens are not\nsufficiently numerous to enable it to be determined\nwhether the opening of the package makes any difference.\n(d) The use of the same article at two different sittings.\nThere were two instances where the same article was\nused twice at different sittings. It happens, unfortunately,\nthat in one of these, while the first use of the relic gave\na good amount of veridical matter, on the second occasion\nan intrusion occurred which occupied the entire sitting.\n\f110 H. F. Saltmarsh. [pari\nIn the other ease both sittings were entire failures,\nnothing being recognised by the contributor of the relic,\nnor with the exception of a possible reminiscence in the\nsecond sitting can any intrusion be detected.\nThe correspondence between the two sittings was very\nslight, in fact it may be considered as stretching a point\nto say that there was any correspondence at all.\nThe following are the only points in which there is the\nslightest resemblance :\nA.S. 32. A.S. 60.\nOld man (and old lady) Old man\nfairly tall just below average height\nvery broad, heavily built inchned to be stout\nface fairly Jong and broad fairly big face\nfairly big nose, little bulbous long nose\nblue or blue-grey eyes, blue eyes\n^\nsparkling\neyebrows fairly well marked well marked\nforehead high, not wide, lined forehead high\ngrey hair, bald on top grey hair, going little bald\nmentally very alert, very clear keen intellect\ndifficulty walking and getting lame\nabout, used stick\nWilliam W.\nThe above descriptions are very vague, and might apply\nto thousands of old men : they do not correspond in\nseveral details, such as height.\n{Note.\u2014Mrs. Elliott herself admits that she cannot\nalways judge heights ; this may be due to the fact that\nshe appears to derive the descriptions from some kind of\nvisual hallucinatory image, which varies in apparent\ndistance from her. Thus an image which aj^pears to\nbe some distance away might be judged to be of a\nshorter person than one which came close.)\nEven the more definite detail of lameness does not\nquite tally\u2014the man in A.S. 32 is said to have difficulty\nin walking, and used a stick, which may have been due\nto infirmity of age, whereas in A.S. 60 he is said definitely\nto have been lame.\n\fI\nt\n112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. Ill\n, None of the other details given or incidents referred to\nI in either sitting correspond in the slightest.\n'\nIt may be said that there was no real correspondence\nbetween the two sittings.\nIt may, however, be noticed that the relic, a gold chain\nbracelet, was obviously of a feminine nature, yet in both\nsittings the principal ostensible communicator was an old\nman. At the first sitting the package was not opened\nby the medium, in the second it was opened and she\nremarked that it obviously referred to a lady. Both\nsittings are normal. The evidence, then, on this point\nis far too slender for any opinion to be formed ;\nwhat\nlittle there is is mainly negative in character.\nj\n(e) T\/ie condition of the medium as regards health, external\nconditions, etc.\n{ As might be expected these factors appear to have\n]\nsome influence on the quality of the sitting, though the\namount of that influence is rather surprisingly small, in\nfact some of the best sittings have been given when the\nmedium has been tired and disturbed by noise.\nExternal circumstances such as noise may disturb her,\nbut there is no instance of the phenomena being entirely\ninhibited by such causes ;\nprobably the occurrence of\nnoise was not very frequent, so that opportunity of\njudging on this point is small.\nAs a matter mainly of guesswork, but based on faint\nindications in the available data, it seems likely that the\neffect of external disturbances is more marked at the\ncommencement of a sitting, for example, it might hinder\nor even prevent trance, but when the trance state is\nfairly established the effect is less.\nIn three cases where the medium is stated to have\nbeen depressed or nervous complete failures have resulted.\nTopsy sometimes makes passing remarks on the health\nconditions of the medium, speaking of her as of a third\nl^erson.\nProbably of greater importance than either of the above\nfactors is the attitude of the medium towards the sitter\nin S.P. sittings.\n\f112 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nMrs. Elliott is sensitive to psychological conditions, and\nreadily detects an unsympathetic atmosphere. If she likes\na sitter the chances of a good sitting are increased, and\nthe reverse holds true. Her liking of the sitter, however,\ndoes not guarantee a good sitting.\nAs before remarked, Topsy becomes discouraged if the\nsitter does not recognise anything she gives ; a little\njudicious praise spurs her to increased efforts, and she\nappears to appreciate any expression of friendship towards\nher. See the \" Stockings \" incident quoted on page 87.\nIt would be of great value if it could be determined\nwhether Topsy's moods bear any relation to those of the\nmedium, but\u2014unfortunately evidence is almost entirely\nlacking on this point. Topsy (speaking, without prejudice,\nof her as a separate person) is a cheerful, good-natured\nlittle person, very friendly and sympathetic, vivacious and\nintelligent though not possessing perhaps so much humour\nas Feda. She is remarkably equable in temperament,\nand exhibits little variation in mood ; she gets a bit\ndepressed by failure, and says so quite openly ; she is\nliable to resent any failure to greet her when she appears.\nShe sometimes admits that she is guessing : this is\nparalleled in normal sittings when Mrs. Elliott says she\nis romancing.\nAs a rule questioning her is of no use, she replies that\nshe can only say \"what they gives\"; sometimes, how-\never, she does make an attempt to answer a question.\nTaken on the whole there is nothing to show that\nTopsy is much affected by the physical or psychological\ncondition of the medium, although, as already stated, the\nevidence in the matter is extremely small.\nIt might prove a fruitful line of research in future\ncases if the medium could be induced to furnish informa-\ntion concerning her state.\n(\/) Trance or normal condition in .sittings.\nEqually good results have been obtained under either of\nthese two conditions. The decision which shall be employed\nat any sitting rests with Mrs. Elliott herself and, it would\nappear, is based on some subjective feeling. On one\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 113\noccasion (A.S. 7) she remarks to the notetaker, \" I am\nnot going to try a normal sitting again with you,\" her\nreason for this being, apparently, that she felt the influ-\nence of the notetaker disturbing, and possibly preventing\nher from receiving impressions connected with the relic.\nThe following are figures concerning this point :\nTrance sittings, 19 successes, average score 39%, 22 failures.\nNormal sittings, 19 ,, ,, ,, 47%, 20\nThese are for A.S. sittings, all S.P. are trance.)\nThere is clearly little to choose between trance and normal.\nSection III. Association of Topics.\nThe next point to be considered is the part played by\nnormal association. It is characteristic of Topsy that\nshe jumps from one topic to another with a somewhat\ndisconcerting abruptness. In very few cases has it been\nfound possible to detect any associative link which might\ndetermine the sequence of the topics. The same may be\nsaid, in perhaps a somewhat less degree, of Mrs. Elliott\nin her normal sittings.\nThe impression which one receives\u2014and it is doubtless\nthe impression which one is intended to receive\u2014in read-\ning the records is that Topsy (or Mrs. Elliott) is simply\nhanding on matter received by her from elsewhere, or\ndescribing what is to her an objective appearance. How\nfar this impression is probably correct will be discussed\nlater. The word \" probably \" is used advisedly\u2014in\npsychical research we cannot hope for certainties, whatever\nhopes we may cherish in other departments of knowledge.\nThe point of the absence of any apparent associative\nlinkage between the various topics is of imjDortance in any\npsj^chological hypothesis intended to cover the phenomena\nof origin and transmission of impressions by mediums.\nWere the linkage of the ordinary associative kind it\nseems hardly likely that no trace of it should be observ-\nable.\nAs an implement of research association might prove to\nbe of the greatest value could its presence be detected in\nany quantity.\nH\n\f114 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nAbout the most individual parts of the entire mental\nfurnishing of any person are his habitual associations,\nseeing that they arise from his unique experience. If it\ncould be shown that the associative links in a series of\nsittings with one medium and various sitters all belong to\nthe same set it would point to the mind of the medium\nas being the source of the impressions ; if , on the other\nhand, any corresj)ondence could be discovered with indi-\nvidual sitters not shared among them all it would point\nto an external origin.\nFurther, if it could be shown that the associations which\ngoverned the sequence of the toj^ics in any case were\nthe same as those known, from a knowledge of his\nhistory, to have been possessed by the ostensible com-\nmunicator, it would be evidence, not conclusive perhaps\nbut still good evidence, of the identity of that communi-\ncator and of his mind being the source of the information.\nUnfortunately, in this case no such associative linkage\nhas been discoverable ; whether this is always the case\nin all trance communications is a matter for research.\nThe matter is mentioned here solely as a suggestion for\nfuture use.\nThere are a few isolated cases where normal associations\nmay be detected, for example, in A.S. 35 the name\nJoseph is followed shortly by the name Mary. In A.S. 21\nwe get \" Something to do with Wilham. They'se con-\nquered something there.\" The association is obvious.\nSome other cases will be quoted when symbolism is\ndealt with. In the matter of symbolism association\nplays an important part.\nSection IV. Function of the Relic.\nThe function of the relic in A.S. sittings must now be\nconsidered, at least in so far as it bears on the purely\npsychological issue. For the larger part this question\ncomes under psychical research proper, but it is one of\nthe places where the two territories overlap. The facts are\nbriefly this : (1) The medium handles an inanimate object.\n(2) She makes a series of statements purporting to be\nderived from spirits, i.e. the surviving consciousnesses of\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 115\ndeceased human beings. (3) In a number of cases these\nstatements are true, or have a relevance for someone who\nis or has been in some way connected \\x\\t\\\\ the object.\nAs regards fact (2) we can leave the discussion of the\nauthenticity of the statements xmtil psychical research\nmatters are being dealt T\\-ith ; the question now to be\ndecided is : Is there any causal relation between fact (1)\nand fact (3) ? i.e. Does the handhng of the reUc enable\nthe medium to make these statements ? The precise maimer\nin which this effect is produced is not yet the point.\nIf there be no causal relation, then the relevance of the\nstatements must be accomited for in some way. The only\nexplanation, other than some imspecified causal nexus,\nseems to be chance.\nThe h\\T)othesis of chance has been dealt -nith elsewhere,\nand the reader must form his own conclusions on what\nhas been there said. If he is satisfied that chance alone\nis responsible for the phenomena, then there is nothing\nmore to be said : all the phenomena are normal and\nrec^uire no special psj^chological treatment. If, on the\nother hand, he decides that chance alone could not\nproduce these results, then he must allow that there is\nsome causal nexus between the two facts. Beyond this\nthe evidence does not enable us to go -nithout trespassing\non the territory of psychical research.\nFrom the point of view of psychology it is sufficient to\nsay that the handhng of an inanimate object sometimes\nenables the medium in some way to make statements\nrelevant to some person or persons who are or have been\nconnected T^dth that object, either directly or indirectly\nthrough the intervention of another person.\nSection V. Cause and Meaning of Intrusions.\nHere, again, the main interest faUs under psychical\nresearch. Evidence that intrusion proper does occur has\nbeen cited when discussing reminiscences [q.v.).\nFor the purposes of psychology it seems a matter of\nindifference whether the matter is veridical for a person\nconnected with the rehc or for an intruder, the psycho-\nlogical mechanism being probably the same in both cases ;\n\f116 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nfor psychical research it may, however, be of the highest\nimportance.\nAn intrusion sitting must be regarded as a complete\nfailure considered as an ordinary A.S. sitting, the causal\nnexus above referred to having failed to be estabhshed.\nIt may be that the intrusion itself spoils the sitting\nand, to use language which must be taken as figurative\nand not as implying any hypothesis, the intruder butts\nin and monopolises the medium, thus destroying any chance\nfor impressions from the relic coming through.\nThis is the view suggested by Topsy herself if we\naccept her words at their face value. She frequently\ncomplains of \" si:>irits \" refusing to go and taking all the\n\" power.\" Mrs. Elliott in one normal sitting remarks\nthat it must be someone who has \" strayed in.\"\nIt is frequently recognised by both Mrs. Elliott and\nTopsy that the purporting commiuiicator is not connected\nwith the relic. There is, apparently, a symbol for this,\nviz. the spirit, i.e. the hallucinatory appearance of the\npurporting communicator, makes the gesture of waving\nit away.\nAcceptance of this view would appear to entail accept-\nance of some form of spiritistic hypothesis for which many\nwill not be prepared ; the facts, however, can be des-\ncribed in such a way as to avoid any such implication.\nIt might be said, for example, that there is a conflict\nbetween impressions arising from various sources, and that\nthe success of one set in getting through prevents the rest\nfrom emerging.\nThe principal intruders are the communicators called A.\nand Mrs. Irving: the intrusions of Miss X.'s communicator\ntake place as a rule at sittings where she acts as note-\ntaker, and are therefore analogous to S.P. sittings : there\nis only one intrusion proper in her case. The other\ncases are one for Mr. S , and one for a former sitter\nof Mrs. Elliott's not connected with this experiment at\nall. It is from Mrs. Elliott herself that we derived the\nknowledge of this last intruder.\nIt is perhaps suggestive that the intruders are all\n\" good communicators.\" This may be interpreted as\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 117\nlending support to some form of si^iritistic theory, but\nagainst this it must be borne in mind that an intrusion\nby a communicator who was not \" good \" might very\nprobably not be recognised.\nBoth A. and Mrs. Irving are very persistent; the former\nis represented in a Leonard sitting as insisting on talking\nhimself, and not giving the other \" spirits \" present a\nchance to say much. He excuses himself for this on the\nground that he is the nearest to the sitter, so that\nthe sitting was really his sitting. Both he and Mrs.\nIrving are quite experienced communicators, the latter\nparticularly so.\nSection VI. Cause and Meaning of Cliches.\nThese phenomena are very obscure, and in the absence\nof any definite detailed information concerning the psycho-\nlogy, history and habits of thought of the medium it is\ndifficult to form any hypothesis to account for them.\nSeveral suggestions may be made, and it seems probable\nthat cliches are not all of one kind, but spring from a\nnumber of different causes. Some, for instance, look like\nsymbols of which the meaning is not clear ; as an example\nof this the numerous references to boots and shoes may\nbe cited, for in one case Mrs. Elliott says, \" He is wear-\ning heavy boots, perhaps it means that he Lived in the\ncountry.\" Others may be fragmentary reminiscences from\nother sittings, e.g. lameness and injury to the foot or leg,\none of the communicators having been a man who had\nlost a leg. Probably some arise from normal associations\nin the mind of the medium : of these \" rice \" is perhaps\nan instance, the apparent association being with India,\nand thence with any hot country. These would belong\nto the larger class of recurrent imagery in the dream\nstuff, or rather the hypnagogic stuff which, as has been\nsuggested, forms the background of the whole thing.\nIn the study of hypnagogic phenomena made by Mrs.\nLeaning, and published in Proceedings, May 1925, it is\nclear that some people tend to have a certain well-defined\ntype of image, as, for example, faces or geometrical\nfigures. It may be that this tendency extends beyond\n\f118 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nthe reproduction of a particular type, and in certain cases\nincludes individual images.\nOne hears many stories of recurrent dreams, and\npossibly some of these stories may be true ;\nanyhow\nit is not inconsistent with what is known of the origin\nand mechanism of dreaming to suppose that certain\ntopics will tend to be reproduced with greater frequency\nthan normal. It seems probable that if it had been\npracticable to submit the medium to a course of psycho-\nanalysis, in particular, to obtain a series of free associa-\ntion tests, some light might be thrown on the source of\nthese cliches.\nThere is one particular cliche which exhibits the type\nvery well. On five occasions Topsy (or Mrs. Elliott)\nmentions a ring with black and an animal standing up on\nit ; this is presumably a signet ring of some sort with a\ndark stone with a figure of some animal engraved thereon.\nIt is mentioned in connection with five different sitters,\nand is veridical for none. It may be a symbol\u2014if so\nits meaning has not been discovered, even by Topsy\nherseK ; but more likely it arises from a memory in the\nmind of the medium which has somehow or other acquired\na set of associations, possessing numerous finks with the\ntype of matter which is given in the sittings.\nThe following is a list of the more important of the\ntopics which were indexed for the discovery of cfiches.\nThe numbers are the number of the references in the\nwhole series.\nAnniversaries, 22. Broken or worn-out boots, 8.\nBreathlessness, 21. Carpet or cloth with hole in it, 6.\nChains, 17. Corn, 12.\nCough, 40. Old-fashioned dress, 6.\nMusic, 48. Desert country, 8.\nPictures, 59. Digging, 10.\nRings, 28. Graves, 8.\nShoes or boots, 29. Someone achieved something, 13.\nWriting, 26. Beads, 12.\nGoing to or across water, 32. Embroidery, 9.\nLeg or foot hurt, 47. Paralysed, 20.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 119\nSome of these, such as anniversaries and pictures, are\ncommonplace references which would naturally tend to\noccur with considerable frequency ;\nsome, as before remarked,\nare probably symbols ; for example, the references to corn\nare almost certainly symbolic either of a connection with\nthe country rather than town (Mrs. Elliott is essentially\na town-dweller) or of a season of the year.\nSection VII. General Conclusions.\nAn attempt must now be made to gather up the\nscattered threads and form some sort of provisional\ntheory of the mechanism of these phenomena. This will\nfall under three headings. 1st. The mode of reception of\nthe impressions. 2nd. The mode of internal transmission,\ni.e. the process which the impressions undergo between\ntheir reception and their delivery by Topsy or Mrs.\nElliott. 3rd. Some theory to account for the source and\nnature of the non-veridical matter.\nConcerning the first, if it be accepted that some part\nof the communications consist of veridical impressions\nhaving relevance to the sitter, the contributor of the\nrelic or deceased persons connected therewith, and that\nthe amount of this is beyond what could be attributed\nto pure chance, the matter given in the sittings must be\ndistinguished as being of two kinds, viz. internally\ngenerated and received from outside.\nIt is with the latter kind that we are now concerned.\nThe question of its source is the subject of psychical\nresearch, and will be dealt with in the second part of\nthis report\u2014for the present it may be ignored. The\npoint now under discussion is the bare fact that the\nmedium receives impressions from some external source,\nand we want to form some theory of the manner in which\nthis takes place.\nIt is pretty clear from the evidence contained in the\nrecords that Topsy and Mrs. Elhott obtain much of\ntheir information from a sort of visual hallucinations ; for\nexample, the physical descriptions are given as though\ntaken from a picture or actual figure, the movements of\nthe ostensible communicator, rooms, articles of furniture,\n\f120 H. F. Saltmarsh. [pakt\nand so on, described. There are also some impressions\nwhich are obviously auditory, such as names and initials,\nand, very occasionally, words which purport to be spoken\nby the ostensible communicator. There is a marked dif-\nference in this respect between Topsy and Feda. The\nlatter gives the impression that she is listening to some-\none talking to her, for she sometimes exchanges remarks\nwith an invisible person. Topsy, on the other hand, seems\nto be watching an invisible actor who is trying to convey\nhis message by pantomime. In neither case, of course,\nis this invariable : Feda does get information conveyed\npictorially and in symbols, and Topsy does hear sounds,\nthat is to say, they purport to do so.\nIt is probable, moreover, that some of the impressions\nare neither visual nor auditory, but rather, to use a word\nmuch employed by Feda, inspirational.\nThe first question, therefore, that arises is whether\nthese hallucinatory images, whether visual or auditory,\nare the external source from which the information is\nderived ? It would appear not, although it is clear that\nmediums in general hold the opposite opinion, an opinion\nwhich tends to favour the spiritistic hypothesis.\nThe hypothesis advocated in this paper is that the\nimpressions, other than those internally generated, are\nreceived by a stratum of the subconscious mind of the\nmedium, and exteriorised as visual or auditory hallu-\ncinations in a manner similar to that employed in the\ngeneration of phantasms. If this be accounted as pro-\nvisionally acceptable it implies the existence of some\nprocess of internal transmission, and any evidence for\nsuch a process which might be found would be\nevidence in favour of the hypothesis. This brings in\nthe second of the theoretical questions.\nThe fact bearing most nearly on this matter is the\nextensive employment of symbolism. The following are\nrepresentative examples :\nS.P. 26. \" Me doesn't think the second one related, or\nelse you didn't know him or something, him doesn't come\nnear you,\" (Symbol for relationship, etc., is \"coming near.\")\n\f112] Sittings ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 121\nS.P. 11. \" You nearly married and tlien not married.\nShows Topsy like wedding dress and then sort of drops\nit.\" (Symbol is obvious here.)\nS.P. 15. \" Shows Topsy like symbol like all black\nthere.\"\nA.S. 29. \" Points to him and waves his hand.\" (Symbol\nfor not being connected with the other \" spirit \" who is\nthere at the time.)\nA.S. 29. \" Shows Topsy like something being dug up.\"\n(Meaning unknown.)\nA.S. 29. Doesn't know whether that gentleman was\ngoing to water and didn't go. Points to water and\nshakes his head.\" (Symbol obvious.)\nS.P. 52. \" Well, Toj)sy me doesn't know what him\nmeans, him shows symbol like you coming out above it,\nit's going to drop away, that condition.\" (Refers to some\ntrouble the sitter had been having.)\nS.P. 17. \" Doesn't know why he keeps on giving Topsy\nsuch a lot of black. Doesn't know whether it's worry or\nsomebody crossed over.\" (Obvious.)\nThe following incidents show how the true impression\ngradually emerges from the symbols. In A.S. 90 there\nis a non-veridical reference to India or \" some hot place\nacross water where there's lots of dark people,\" then\ncomes some irrelevant matter, followed by the words,\n\" Remember palms.'\" Topsy then says, \" Doesn't know\nwhat palm looks like. And then him laughing and says,\nwhere bananas grow.\" More irrelevant matter is inter-\nposed. Then comes, \" Him showing Topsy lot of rice\nand him laughing. There must be joke about lot of\nrice ;\n'\nmore rice, never tired.'\n\"\nThe annotator says :\nHe was very fond of rice puddings and often said he\nwould willingly have one at both meals every day. He\nwould often say when we asked what pudding he would\nlike, \" You can give more rice, I never get tired of it,\"\nor words to that effect.\nThere would appear to be a connection in Mrs. ElHott's\n\f122 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nmind between rice and India. It is easy to trace the\ngradual emergence of the true impression concerning the\nrice pudding : first, the symbol calling up India, then, by\nassociation, Palms, Bananas, and finally Rice ;\neventually\nthe correct meaning, that is to say rice as a pudding and\nnot as connected with the tropical country where it is\ngrown.\nA somewhat similar incident occurs in S.P. 3 and\nS.P. 16, both being with the same sitter. In S.P. 3\nTopsy says, \" Somebody gone to hot country connected\nwith you,\" and \" Me thinks it's a lady,\" \" Him shows me\nlots of white, do you understand ?\n\" then \"Is it sister\nto you 1\n\" (this was correct), \" But doesn't know why it's\nhappy condition there, for me thinks she murmur sick,\nsome lady sick,\" \" She getting married ?\n\" Then a little\nlater, \" Me thinks she took lot of white things with her,\nthat is what it is.\" The last few words seem to give\nthe clue to the whole thing. The white things are a\nsymbol for a hot country or for getting married, and,\npossibly through association with the white uniform\nusually worn by nurses, with sickness.\nThis is confirmed by S.P. 16. Reference is made to a\nlady who had gone a long way away. Then \" She been\nill, or something to do with ill people.\" Then Topsy\nasks if it is the sitter's sister or sister-in-law. After\nsome irrelevant matter, she says, \" Does she always dress\nwhite ?\n\" \" Shows white,\" then :\nHim (referring to ostensible communicator from whom\nall this purports to come) been to India ? Well, what's\nhe say India for ? Him said India. Doesn't know\nwhether your sister been to wedding, or what it is, gives\nsomething mix up over wedding.\nThe only veridical impression behind all this is the\nfact of the sitter's sister having gone to a hot climate,\nviz. Kenya. The symbol seems to be the white clothes ;\nTopsy recognises this when she says, \" That is what it\nis.\"\nOne more instance will be given. It is interesting as\nshowing a mixture of veridical impressions. In S.P. 46\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 123\nsitter's mother is tlie ostensible communicator. Topsy\n.-ays :\nDoesn't know whether that lady got two boys or you\ngot two boys. Keeps speaking of two boys.\nSitter. There were two boys ; she had two boys.\nWell, they was related to you, must be.\nSitter. Yes.\nDid one cross over before her and one after ?\nSitter. No.\nSomebody crossed over just before her, a man.\nSitter. Yes.\nAnd then after, but not very soon after her.\nSitter. That's right.\nThe facts were that the sitter's mother had twin sons\nwho died in infancy, and a brother who died just before\nher, and a nephew who died after her. The confusion\nappears to be caused by the two impressions each con-\ncerning two male persons connected with the ostensible\ncommunicator who had died. It looks as though the\nimpression concerning the two infant sons who had died\ncalled up by similarity the tw^o other relatives whose\ndeaths were connected with her own by proximity in\ndate.\nIt will be observed that the symbols are all of a\ncertain type. They are what might be called natural\nsymbols, and are based on habitual analogies, either\nverbal, as for example when the hallucinatory figure\ncoming near to the sitter is taken to mean nearness of\nrelationship, or common forms of speech, as when all\nblack is used as a symbol for worry or sorrow ;\nor else they may be natural pantomime, as when the\ngesture of waving away is interpreted as meaning that\nthe ostensible communicator was not connected with the\nreUc.\nThis feature should be contrasted with the symboUsm\nemployed by Feda. In her case the evidence available\nis much more scanty ; if symbols are largely used by\nher the fact is not so apparent as with Topsy. This\nmay be due to the more developed condition of Mrs.\n\f124 H. F. Sdltmarsh. [part\nLeonard's mediumship, and a study of the records of her\nearlier sittings might reveal a larger utihsation of symbols\nthan shows at the present time.\nHowever this may be, the symbols in Feda's case, in\nso far as they can be discovered, appear to be of a dif-\nferent nature from Topsy's ;\nthey are purely arbitrary and\nartificial. For example relationship is sometimes symbohsed\nby a pink line between the appearances of the two persons ;\na circle of light means that the person in connection with\nwhom it appears is helping somebody.\nThat Feda does receive a good deal more of her in-\nformation by means of symbols than appears on the\nsurface may be suspected from an incident happening in\na sitting with Mr. Irving (not of this series) reported in\nProceedings, Vol. XXXVI.,\npage 218. Feda says \" the test\nis mackintoshes and umbrellas, test is.\" Sitter. \" Is\nwhat ?\n\" Feda. \" Means that. No she says water tight.\"\nThis looks like a case of a mistranslated symbol. Pro-\nbably a search would discover more instances. In this\nconnection Mr. Drayton Thomas's article in Proceedings,\nVol. XXXVIII. , is important.\nNow there are two alternatives : the impressions may\nbe received by the medium in a symbolic form, in which\ncase the process of symbohsation is an external one ; or\nelse the translation into symbols is effected internally in\nthe receptor stratum of the medium's consciousness, or\nat some jioint between that and Topsy (or, when there\nis no trance, Mrs. Elliott).\nIf the facts are taken at their face value the first of\nthese alternatives is suggested. Topsy always speaks as\nthough the communicator were using symbols ; thus she\nwill say, \" Doesn't know what him's giving but him's\nshowing Topsy so and so.\"\nThis view, if adopted, lends considerable weight to the\nspiritistic hypothesis, for if the process of symbohsation is\neffected externally to the medium, it appears as if there\nmust be an active, intelligent indejoendent source from\nwhich the information is derived. This, combined with\nthe memory necessary for the supply of the information,\nis a sufficiently good description of a consciousness of the\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 125\nsame type as the human, so that the source might well\nbe the surviving spirit of a deceased person. Personal\nidentity is, of course, not proved, but a long step in\nthat direction is taken.\nDoubtless it is some dim appreciation of this reasoning\nthat leads mediums to use language which suggests the\nview that symbohsm is of external origin. It is not\nsuggested, in Mrs. Elliott's case at any rate, that this is\nconsciously or deliberately done, but it seems reasonable\nto suppose that the personal convictions and mental\nattitude of the \" normal \" medium will be, in some\nmeasure, reflected in her trance utterances.\nBut the evidence, on closer scrutiny, seems to show\nthat the symbohsm is not of external origin. It is found\nas a fact that Topsy and Mrs. Elliott have one set of\nsymbols which are in use for all sitters and communi-\ncators. Feda has another different set, though she some-\ntimes uses the same sjmibol for relationship as employed by\nTopsy, viz. the figure of the ostensible communicator coming\nnear to the sitter. If the symbolism were externally generated\nwe should expect to find a communicator using the same\nsymbols with both Topsy and Feda ;\nmoreover, it is\nextremely unlikely that all communicators should hit upon\nthe same symbols in communicating their information\n\u2014\nindividual differences would be bound to occur. In the\ncase of Feda in particular it is highly improbable that\ndifferent commvinicators should all hit upon the same\narbitrary symbols.\nIn view of these considerations the more tenable hypo-\nthesis seems to be that the translation into symbols is\neffected by the medium herself, that is to say by some\nstratum of her subconscious mind. That analogous\nprocesses of synibohsation are of frequent occurrence the\nresearches of Freud and Jung have abundantly proved.\nWhatever attitude may be adopted towards their special\ntheories, there can be no question that they have shown\nthat synibohsation plays a large part in the providing\nthe material of dreams. We have already seen reason\nfor allying the phenomena of trance communications with\nthe normal dream, or rather with hypnagogic visions ; it\n\f126 H. F. Saltmarsli, [part\nis, therefore, only a natural corollary that symbolisation\nshould play its part in both.\nThat that stratum of the medium's consciousness\nwhich receives the impressions, called the receptor\nstratum, is not the same as that stratum which is per-\nsonified as Topsy, or, if Topsy is considered to be an\nindependent entity, is functioning when she is in control,\nis proved by the fact that symbols are frequently not\nunderstood. She sometimes says definitely that she\n\" does not understand the symbol he is giving.\" The\ngroping which has already been noticed takes place on\nthese occasions. Topsy frequently suggests alternative\nmeanings. Some instances of these were given on p. 50,\nparticularly the one quoted from S.P. 17, where the\nsymbol of black means either worry or the death of\nsomeone.\nIt is a common feature of trance communications that\nthere seems to be great difficulty in getting through\nproper names. This fact fits in with the theory here\nsuggested. Proper names are, as a rule, not amenable\nto symbolisation : they have denotation, but no connota-\ntion. It seems probable also that this feature renders\nthem difficult to transmit by telepathy. Judging from\nTopsy's attempts to give names, and the mistakes she\nmakes when doing so, there are two methods used to\nconvey them to her ; the more common is the auditory,\nbut she also sometimes appears to get the letters as a\nvisual appearance. In the former case she will make\nmistakes in pronunciation, e.g. in A.S. 40 she gives\nRubecca, then correctly Rebecca, or she will give alterna-\ntive letters having the same sound, such as B. and P.,\nand remark that she does not know which is right.\nIt seems that the readiest method of conveying impres-\nsions from the receptor stratum is by means of pictorial\nimagery, and this constitutes a good reason for the\nextensive employment of symbols. Where this method\nfails, or for some reason is not practicable, auditory\nimpressions may be used. The article already referred\nto in Proc. 8.P.R., Vol. XXXVIII., July 1928, by Mr.\nDrayton Thomas should be consulted on this point.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 127\nIn view of the above it is submitted that the following\nconclusions may be accepted as provisionally estabhshed.\n(1) The impressions are received by a stratum of the\nsubconscious mind of the medium other than that func-\ntioning as Topsy or with Topsy, i.e. the trance conscious-\nness.\n(2) They are transmitted from this receptor stratum\nlargely by means of symbohc visual imagery. A smaller\npart is transmitted as auditory impressions.\nThe question now arises whether the impressions are\nalready in the form of symbols when received by the\nreceptor stratum.\nIf this were the case there would have to be a trans-\nlation from the s^^mbols in which they were received into\ntheir meaning, and then retranslation into another set of\nsymbols.\nWhile it is not impossible that this double translation\nmay occur, it seems rather comphcated and round-about.\nIf a simpler hypothesis can be found it should be pre-\nferred.\nThe hypothesis here suggested is tha,t the impressions\nare received as \" meanings,\" that is to say, not expressed\nin words, pictures or any other form of symbols.\nA point in support of this theory is that the medium\nfrequently reproduces in herself the conditions of the\nostensible communicator ; for example, in S.P. 20, where\nthe communications purported to come from a man who\nhad died from a tumour on the bi'ain, she complained of\nsevere headache on waking up from the trance ; in many\ncases she speaks as though she actually felt the conditions\nshe describes. These conditions, or rather the impres-\nsions concerning them, would be of the type which is not\nhabitually symbohsed, nor is it easy to see how symbols\nof the sort usually used could be found. These instances\nlook like impressions received and transmitted direct.\nIn some of the experimental cases of telepathy there is\nreason to think that information is sometimes transmitted\ndirect, without translation into words or other symbols,\nfor example, the telepathic transfer of tastes, shght local\npains, etc. In so far as there is evidence for this it\n\f128 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nsupports the theory now under discussion. The matter,\nhowever, is as yet by no means definitely settled, and\nfurther research might advantageously be undertaken. It\nseems not impossible to devise experiments v\/hich should,\nif successful, provide crucial proof on this point. If\ntelepathic transfer of an idea not translatable into visual\nsymbols could be obtained between two persons who had\nno language in common, we should have to adopt a very\nstrained and round-about explanation to avoid the con-\nclusion that a \" meaning \" had been sent direct.\nWe may then add a third clause to our hypothesis,\nviz. That the impression received by the receptor stratum\nis received as a meaning, that is to say the process is a\npurely psychical one\u2014not expressed in language or other\nsensory impressions.\nIt may further be suggested\u2014though this may be\naccounted as a somewhat fanciful extension which goes\nbeyond the evidence\u2014that the receptor stratum of the\nmedium's consciousness lies below or beyond the point at\nwhich differentiation into the various senses occurs, that\nis to say a meaning would not be visual, auditory,\nolfactory, sapid or tactual, but just plain meaning. The\nmode of consciousness of this stratum would be analogous\nto that attached to the primitive unspecialised irritability\nof protoplasm, though it might be so far evolved as to\nbe definitely human.\nThat some such vestigial remains of earlier forms of\nconsciousness may be found in human minds seems not\nunhkely when one considers the analogy with the human\nbody in tliis respect. Also, it cannot be denied that we\ndo retain vestiges of instincts which have long ceased to\nhave any value to us. However, the matter is so specula-\ntive that further discussion would be out of place.\nThere is one further point in connection with the\nreception and transmission of externally generated impres-\nsions. One of the most striking features of communications\nreceived through trance mediums is their disjointedness.\nThis is particularly apparent with Topsy\u2014she jumps\nabruptly from one subject to another with no observable\nassociative links. Now if the information were received as\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 129\ndefinite messages from an external source one would expect\nto find more continuity in the communications, and to be\nable sometimes to detect the associative links which lead\nfrom one topic to another.\nSuggested Analogy with certain Physical Processes.\nTo account for this phenomenon the following concep-\ntion of the mode of transfer of the impressions to the\nreceptor stratum is suggested. The process is likened to\nthe physical phenomenon called osmosis. If a tube con-\ntaining\" a solution of sugar, having the end closed by a\nporous membrane, is immersed in water, it will be found\nthat the water will penetrate the membrane, causing a\nrise of pressure in the tube. This is called osmotic\npressure. The phenomenon occurs with a large number of\ndifferent liquids besides that named.\nIt is suggested that the mind from which the informa-\ntion is derived somehow gets into contact with that of\nthe medium, the place of contact in each case being a\nstratum of the subconscious mind. The precise nature,\nor to continue to use the spatial metaphor, the locahty\nof this stratum in the case of the medium has already\n(see pp. 126-128) been suggested. Some parts of the contents\nof the source mind passes by infiltration into the mmd of\nthe medium and there is an interminghng of contents ;\nthe process, however, so far as we know, takes place ni\none direction only.\nThere is probably some amount of selectivity exercised\nby the source mind which tends to cause certain parts\nof its contents to pass more readily, so that we find\noccasionally something that looks like a definite message,\nbut the bulk of the stuff which gets through appears to\nbe fortuitously determined. This process may be imagined\nas consisting in the endowment of certain ideas in the\nsource mind with a higher degree of conative energy,\nwhich gives them greater mobility than the rest, thus\ntending to bring them up against the dividing membrane\nmore frequently and with greater velocity, thereby increas-\ning their chances of getting through. This is, of course,\ngoing beyond the parallel of osmosis.\n\f130 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nIt is fully recognised that the language used in making\nthis suggestion has been unblushingly spatial and material,\nideas have been spoken of as independent things which\nmove about in space, and the two minds concerned as\nthough they were closed vessels. No doubt this would\nbe considered as scandalous by most psychologists, except\nperhaps the more ardent of the behaviourist school, but\nit is intended as a highly allegorical picture and not as\nan even partially exact description.\nMoreover, it is, after all, only an extreme instance of\nwhat inevitably is the case in psychology : our ideas of\npsychological processes are borrowed from the physical\nworld, and psj^chological hypotheses are no more than\nanalogies with those of physics.\nBearing this disclaimer in mind, and reserving the right\nto change the metaphor as often as seems desirable, we\nmay proceed.\nThe infiltration of ideas from the source mind into that\nof the medium causes a rise of pressure in the latter,\nanalogous to osmotic pressure. We may imagine the\nreceptor stratum of the medium's mind as a vessel in\nwhich there is surging about a crowd of ideas striving to\nfind a way out. Some of these are ideas belonging to\nthe medium and internal^ generated ; this would be the\ndream stuff or rather the hypnagogic stuff which, as has\nbeen suggested, forms the background of the whole thing ;\nmixed up with these is a certain amount of externally\ngenerated matter, i.e. ideas derived from the source mind\nwhich have entered by the process of psychical osmosis.\nSeeing that the membrane dividing the latter from the\nformer permits passage in only one direction, the only\nmeans of escape is therefore upwards towards the trance\nstratum, in this particular case towards Topsy.\nNow the channels leading in this direction are not free\nand unhindered. We have seen reason for thinking that\nimpressions of a certain type are most readily transmitted\nin the form of symbols, and it is suggested that the\ncondition necessary for their emergence from the receptor\nstratum is the availabihty of suitable symbols.\nAnother jjhysical phenomenon may be employed as an\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. . 131\nallegorical picture of what may be supposed to occur. It\nis possible to super-saturate the air in a closed vessel\nwith water vapour. This vapour remains in a state of\nsuspension provided there are no nuclei available for its\ncondensation. If nuclei are formed within the vessel, as,\nfor example, by ionisation by ultra-violet light or similar\nmeans, the water vapour will condense on them and fall\nas a shower of drops. We may imagine the receptor\nstratum of the medium's mind as being in a state of\npsychical super-saturation, the whole crowd of ideas and\nimpressions would remain in a state of suspension until\nsuitable nuclei for condensation were found ; such a\nnucleus would be an internally generated idea cajjable of\nacting as a symbol. When such appears, the externally\ngenerated impression is carried to the surface, externalised\nby Topsy, and retranslated from the symbols into her\nown words.\nOr the suggestion ma,\\ be put another way. The ideas\nin the receptor stratum are prevented from rising to the\ntrance stratum by the normally high synaptic resistance\nof the neural channels. Some of these channels, however,\nwill have a somewhat lower synaptic resistance than the\nrest, viz. those which have already been the path of\nnervous discharge.\nAny idea associated with that of which the original\ndischarge was the neural concomitant ^ will tend to pass\nalong these paths. If, therefore, any impression received\nfrom the outside is able to seize upon a suitable symbol\nwhich has available through association an already exist-\ning path of low synaptic resistance, it will stand a chance\nof escaping along that path to the trance stratum.\nThose impressions or ideas which are highly charged\nwith conative energy may occasionally be able, in virtue\nof that energy, to force their way up against the high\nresistance of the synapses. This would be the case\nwhere a direct message is successfully communicated.\nWith regard to the type of impression which appears\n1 This word is used \"without prejudice,\" and must not be taken to\nimply adherence to any form of psycho-physical theory, whether of the\nparallelist or interactionist type.\n\f132 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nto be capable of being internally transmitted without\nrecourse to symbols, it will be observed that they are\nmostly of a relatively simple and uncomplicated nature.\nIt is the complex physical events which require symbolism.\nThe mind is habituated to deal with the former ideas in\ntheir pure form ; it seems reasonable, therefore, to sup-\npose that they would be likely to find suitable paths of\nlow resistance available for them owing to the former\npassage of similar ideas, more likely, that is to say, than\nwould any idea of a complex physical event.\nPossible explanation of some of the phenomena observed.\nIt must be repeated that this is only a kind of alle-\ngorical picture of the way in which it may be imagined\nthat the impressions are received and transmitted. By\nmeans of it, however, we can suggest an explanation of\nmany of the phenomena observed.\n1st. The disjointedness and lack of continuity in the\ncommunications. If success in getting through from the\nreceptor stratum is dependent on the finding of a suitable\npath of low resistance we should expect to find this dis-\njointedness. There would be no logical order in the\nimpressions which came up, but a perfectly haphazard\nstream, as one here and one there succeeded in finding\nits path of escape.\n2nd. The \" spirits \" do not tell us what we should\nexpect from them. The salient facts of their history are\nfrequently omitted and trivial details given.\nIf the process of reception is analogous to osmosis, and\nthe receptor stratum receives its impressions from the\noutside by a kind of infiltration, then only a fraction of\nthe contents of the source mind would pass into that of\nthe medium, the salient facts might be left behind.\nMoreover, there is the further possibihty that they might\nbe unable to emerge from the receptor stratum even when\nthey had succeeded in getting there.\n3rd. The errors and mistatements which occur so fre-\nquently.\nIf the impressions which are received from the outside\nare carried up to the trance consciousness along with a\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 133\nstream of internally generated hypnogogic stuff, the\nresult is bound to be a mixture of false with the true.\nThe question of the source and nature of the non-\nveridical matter will be fully discussed presently.\n4th. Deferred impressions.\nThese can be simply explained as impressions received\nfrom the outside which have failed during the course of\nthe sitting to escape from the receptor stratum, and\nhave remained latent therein until a favourable oppor-\ntunity at a subsequent sitting has enabled them to arise\nto the trance stratum.\n5th. Reminiscence.\nIf it be true reminiscence, it has its origin above the\nlevel of the receptor stratum, but it is possible that an\nimpression in the receptor stratum may give rise to a\ncommunication on two different occasions. Here it\nbecomes apparent how misleading ma}^ be the parallels\ndrawn between physical and psychical phenomena. In\nwhat has gone before ideas or impressions were spoken of\nas individual things existing in their own skins, being in\none place at one time and capable of moving to another\nplace, in fact, as behaving as if they were particles of\nmatter.\nIt is sometimes difficult to bear in mind that this is\nnot really the case : an idea is not a thing, it is rather\na process, nor must the word process be here understood\nin the physical sense ; ideas and all psychical entities are\nentirely sui generis, and obey laws and are subject to\nconditions of their own.\nIt was probably tacitly assumed by all who have read\nthe foregoing allegorical description that an idea having\nescaped from the receptor stratum is no longer there.\nThis is not necessarily the case, it may have arisen to\nthe trance stratum in the sense that it has given rise\nto a veridical communication, and yet it may still remain\nin the receptor stratum in the sense that it may at a\nfuture time give rise to a further veridical statement.\nPerhaps the nearest analogy is to a flame ; the flame\nof a candle may give rise to an unlimited number of\nother flames and yet remain where it was, unaltered by\n\f134 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nhaving done so ;\nonly, in using this parallel, we must\nsupj)ose that the flame of the candle has its own peculiar\ncharacteristics, and that it communicates these charac-\nteristics to all the other flames to which it gives rise.\nOr the analogy of mirror images might be employed.\nAn object can give rise to any number of images if the\nmirrors are available.\nFrom this it may be seen that similar communications\nmay be made at different sittings arising from the same\nimpression in the receptor stratum ; these would be in-\ndistinguishable from true reminiscences, which are the\nreproduction by memory of communications already given.\n6th. Cliches.\nA theory of the origin of cliches may be founded on\nthis speculation. If we accept the principle of specific\nsubstances at the synapses as the causes of the specific\ncharacter of the neural discharge, we may suppose that\nsome of the patlis of low resistance leading from the\nreceptor stratum to the trance stratum pass through arcs,\nthe synapses of which have specific substances of such a\nnature that any discharge through these arcs gives rise\nin consciousness to a certain idea. As an example, take\nthe cliche cited before, viz. the black ring with an\nanimal standing up. We must suppose that there is a\nneural arc with synapses having the specific substance\nwhich gives rise to this idea, and that the resistance of\nthis arc being relatively low it forms an easy path for\nthe escape of ideas in the receptor stratum, and is there-\nfore likely to be frequently used by ideas having the\nrequisite similarity.\nIf the principle of specific synaptic substances be not\naccepted, or if tliis be considered an undue extension of\nthe principle, we can simply say that cliches arise from\npeculiarly strong associations in the mind of the medium\nsuch that they tend to be frequently excited, leaving the\nmodus operandi of the excitation ixnexplained.\nIn suggesting this hypothesis to account for the recep-\ntion and transmission of impressions from external sources\nthe writer is fully aware of its fanciful and speculative\nnature. It is crude and undigested. It must be left\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 135\nto the readers to judge whether it be provisionally\nacceptable or not ; if the former, further research is\nindicated as desirable in order that the hypothesis may\nbe modified, refined and rendered more definite ; its\ndetails will doubtless require much amendment, and\nprobably more suitable language and more apt parallels\nmay be found.\nIf it be rejected an alternative is still to seeK:.\nProbable origin of Non-veridical matter.\nThere now remains only to give some account of the\nprobable origin and nature of the non-veridical matter.\nIt arises from several sources, most of which have\nalready been discussed in connection with other matters,\nsuch as reminiscence, etc. It will suffice, therefore, if\nthey be simply enumerated in this place.\nFirst in order of magnitude must be placed Dream or\nHypnagogic vision. Probably the largest part of the non-\nveridical matter is of this nature. Of those which follow\nit is impossible to say which is of greater importance.\nThey are reminiscence, deferred impression when unrecog-\nnised, intrusion of unrecognisable communicators, mis-\ntranslation of symbols. Concerning this last it may be\nadvisable to say a few words.\nIt is not only that Topsy does not always know the\ncorrect interpretation to put upon a symbol, but symbols\nare sometimes mistaken for non-symbolic messages. This\nis probably the case, for example, with the frequent\nreferences to digging. The visual hallucination of the\nostensible communicator digging is almost certainly sym-\nbolic, but we do not know of what. As Topsy evidently\nshares our ignorance she simply gives it as a statement\nof fact.\nIt is, of course, all more or less a matter of surmise,\nas there is no certain indication of what is symbohc and\nwhat not. However, it seems probable that this consti-\ntutes an occasional cause of error in the communications.\nSometimes it is obvious that Topsy does not under-\nstand, in fact she says so herself ; this has been discussed\nunder \" Groping.\"\n\f136 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nIn addition to the above sources of error it may well\nbe that the receptor stratum of the medium's mind picks\nup stray impressions unconnected with the sitter or con-\ntributor of the relic ; that this does sometimes occur is\nshown by the fairly frequent references to the notetaker\nand her affairs ;\nprobably also the references to Miss\nNewton are of this nature, though here the matter is\ncomphcated by the distinction which must be drawn\nbetween information received telepathically and that\nobtained by clairvoyance. This, however, comes under\nthe heading of Psychical Research. Whether there is any\ntruth in the suggestion of broadcast telepathy this is\nnot the place for any attempt to determine, but should\nit be a vera causa, that is to say, should there be\nloose telepathic messages wandering about and liable to\nbe picked up by any suitably tuned receiver, this would\nconstitute a further cause of error, though were all tele-\npathy broadcast the confusion arising would probably be\nso great that the percentage of veridical matter in A.S.\nsittings would be lower than it is.\nIf the suggestion of the nature of the mode of reception\nof the impressions be correct, that is to say, the theory\ncalled psychical osmosis, it seems probable that a good\ndeal of error may arise from the mixture of the stuff\nin the receptor stratum. We might expect to get\ncomposite images, and as a fact these do sometimes appear\nto occur ; a symbol might serve for two or more impres-\nsion'^, items might be ascribed to the wrong communicator,\ngaps hi a description either of a place or person or\nevent might be filled up with material drawn from other\nsources, such as the hypnagogic stuff contained in the\nreceptor stratum, non-relevant externally generated impres-\nsions or Topsy's own exuberant fancy.\nAnd last but not least there are the errors arising\nfrom the personal idiosyncracy of the annotators. This\ncuts both ways. iSome annotators are so ingenious in\nfinding correspondences that their results require a heavy\ndiscount, others are so refractory that they will not see\nanything but the most direct hits.\nThis, of all sources of error, is the most difficult to\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 137\ndeal with, and it is a difficulty that constantly occurs in\nall forms of psychical research. It would seem that the\nonly possible method of eliminating this error is to\nmultiply the number of cases, sitters and annotators, to\nsuch a degree that the individual variations average out.\nIt is obvious that the number dealt with in this experi-\nment falls far short of that required. A certain amount\nof compensation can be applied by the judgment of the\nscorer, but this is, of necessity, very imperfect, and\nintroduces a further source of variation, viz. his own\npersonal idiosyncrasy.\nIt may be argued that the error introduced by the\npersonal factor in the annotation will tend rather to\nreduce the score than to increase it, and this indepen-\ndently of the proportion which the credulous annotators\nbear to the sceptical. The scorer is bound to criticise the\nhits, and in a good many cases to apply a severe dis-\ncount to the enthusiasm of the too ingenious annotator.\nAs a matter of fact, in this case quite a number of\nsittings have had to be rejected altogether or treated as\nvalueless becau^se the annotations appeared to be un-\ntrustworthy, far-fetched or fanciful ; in some of these\nsittings there was unquestionably some amount of\nveridical matter, but it was impossible from the data\navailable to determine how much.\nExcept in the case of a simple statement a plain\n\" Yes \" is not deemed sufficient. Where an incident is\nannotated as veridical some account of the actual event is\nrequired, and the scorer has to judge how far the annota-\ntion can be accepted. Any alteration is always a deduction.\nOn the other hand, with those annotators who err in\nthe opposite direction the data for the scorer by means\nof which he could criticise the annotations are entirely\nlacking. As a rule the annotator simply passes by with-\nout comment those statements which are rejected as\nnon-veridical, or is contented with the simple assertion\nof their irrelevance. To criticise this negative evidence\nthe scorer would require an intimate and highly detailed\nknowledge of the past history of the annotator, which,\nof course, he does not possess.\n\f138 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part 11\nIn a few cases it has happened that statements have oi\nbeen rejected in one sitting which, taken in the hght of a(\nthe facts given by the same annotator in another sitting,\nshould have been counted as veridical. ci\nIt also happens sometimes that the annotator, on thinking o\nover again the statements made by the medium, perceives q\nthe relevance of some which were previously rejected. We\nhave no guarantee that these second thoughts are always n\ngiven, or that in the event of their failure, third or t\nfourth thoughts might not succeed. What this amounts 1;\nto is that lapse of memory on the part of the annotator I\nis hable to act in the direction of reducing the score. t\nProbably false memory does sometimes operate in the i\nopposite direction, but the magnitude of this factor would\nbe less than that of plain forgetting.\nA suggestion is made in an appendix to this report of t\na possible means by which this and similar errors might\nbe to some extent counteracted. i\nBefore concluding this part of the report two interesting ]\nbut extremely puzzhng incidents must be mentioned, i\nThey illustrate very well the perplexities w^hich assail the\npsychical researcher, and the difficulty of finding hypo-\ntheses to cover all the facts.\nIn A.S. 90 Miss X.'s communicator intrudes. The\nphysical description is good in parts, but contains a fair\nnumber of inaccuracies : by itself it would be insufficient\nto estabhsh identity. His Christian name and that of\nhis daughter is correctly given ; the first is so common\na name that it has no evidential value ; the second,\nthough a usual name, is not what would be called\ncommon, it occurs only on two other occasions in the\nwhole series. A few commonplace veridical remarks are\nmade, then, after a good deal of irrelevant matter, there\ncomes the \" More rice, never tired \" incident. Some\nmore veridical statements are made, and a good deal\nof non-veridical matter concludes the sitting.\nThis may seem a slender basis on which to assume an\nintrusion, although two or three of the statements are of\nthe definite class. If it had stood alone it would have |\nbeen rejected, but seeing that there are other instances I\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 139\nof intrusion with this communicator it was provisionally\naccepted as such.\nThe following non-veridical correspondences, however,\nconfirm this conclusion, and it is the nature and cause\nof these that constitutes the puzzhng problem now in\nquestion.\nBefore the \" rice \" incident there was a non-veridical\nreference to India, etc. The communicator was then said\nto have been in the habit of reading in a \" funny\nlanguage, funny writing, looks Uke no letters at all.\"\nLater he is said to have been interested in the stars ;\nthe name Geraldine is then given in connection with\nmusic.\nAll these references are incorrect for this communicator.\nThe date of the sitting was June 17, 1927. The note-\ntaker was Miss H.\nOn November 17, 1927, Miss X. had an anonymous\nsitting with Mrs. Dowdall at Cardiff, at which her father\npurported to communicate. Some amount of evidential\nmatter was given, and then the medium said, \" Could\nyour father speak languages ?\n\" Sitter. \" No.\" Medium.\n\" What are those funny letters then ? I see him writing\nlike httle crooks, funny letters, twists and turns. Almost\nlike shorthand but it isn't that.\" In the same sitting\nit was also said that he was interested in the stars ; and\nat a previous sitting, held the day before, with the same\nmedium, the name Gerald was given in connection with\nmusic.\nThere is thus a good correspondence between the\nsittings, but the matter is all non-veridical.\nSo far as can be ascertained IVIiss X. had not seen the\nrecord of the first sitting when she attended the second\nset. This point is, unfortunately, not quite certain.\nIt is difficult to suggest any explanation for these\nfacts\u2014the chance that two independent mediums should\nboth have hit on the same set of fictitious statements is\npractically nil. The only hypotheses which can be put\nforward to explain the facts are all so compHcated, and\ninvolve such an amount of cross-references, that they are\npractically untenable. For example, we might suppose\n\f140 H. F. SaUmarsh. [part\nthat Miss H , the notetaker in the Elhott sitting,\nunconsciously transmits telepatliically the information to\nMiss X., although she was ignorant that the sitting\nhad any reference to her. Miss X. preserves this in-\nformation in her subconsciousness, it never having come\nto the surface, and Mrs. Dowdall draws her information\ntherefrom.\nWe can hardly put forward the explanation of mis-\ntranslation of symbols, because the two mediums are not\nlikely to have the same set of symbols, and the chance\nthat these particular ones should be mistranslated in both\ncases is very small. Moreover, the name Gerald or\nGeraldine would not be conveyed symbolically.\nThose who hold the spiritistic hypothesis can, of course,\nexplain it quite easily ;\nthey may say that the statements\nrefer to some companion of the dead man who is with\nhim on the spirit plane, the only mistake being in attri-\nbuting them to him, though why the mistake should\nhave been twice made is a little curious. Possibly other\nmore plausible modes of explanation might be given on\nthis hypothesis, but it must be remembered that the\nspiritistic hypothesis is so wide that it can be made to\ncover almost anything.\nThe second case is equally, if not more, puzzling.\nIn a series of sittings with a Mrs. T. as sitter, or\ncontributor of the relics, there occurs a complicated set\nof correspondences of a non-veridical nature.\nIn A.S. 14, 24, 53, 72, and S P 39, reference is made\nto a tumble-down or ruined building; in A.S. 11, 24,\nand 8. P. 39 to Egypt ; in A.S. 33 and 42 to a deserted\ncountry ; in A.S. 6G and 72 to Algeria ; in A.S. 42 and\n74 to mining operations ; in A.S. 24 and 42 to the Navy ;\nin A.S. 24 and 72 to an airman ; in A.S. 42 and 72 to\nan organ. The name Arthur occurs in A.S. 33 and 42,\nMichael in A.S. 11 and 83, and Mitchell in A.S. 72,\nRoger in A.S. 14 and 24.\nIn six out of the twelve sittings reference was made to\nMiss Newton.\nSome of these correspondences may be explained as\nbeing cliches ; all the names are fairly common through-\n\f112] Sittings tvith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 141\nout the whole series of sittings, references to \" deserted\ncountry \" are fairly common, to airmen quite common.\nBut the others are not so explicable. They may be\nmistranslated symbols, seeing all the sittings are with the\nsame medium, but the suggestion is not very satisfactory.\nThe wisest course seems to be to admit defeat and\nleave the matter as an unsolved puzzle.\nThe rather high number of references to Miss Newton\nis curious. With this sitter they occur in 50 per cent,\nof the sittings, in the entire series they occur in about\n20 per cent\nThere is a suggestion of a cause for this peculiarity in\nsome of the sittings which Mrs. T. had with Mrs. Leonard\n(not included in this case). The ostensible communicator,\nMr. T., states that he is working with Mr. Irving's com-\nmunicator to give good evidence, and also that he will\ntry to give it through the Society. In an early sitting,\nbefore Mrs. T. had joined the S.P.R., he purported to\nsay, \"Go to I. N., she will help.\" Neither the sitter nor\nFeda appeared to understand the reference.\nMany of the references to ]\\Iiss Newton are veridical,\nand show what seems to be supernormal knowledge of her\naffairs and incidents happening at the offices of the\nSociety ; there is also some correspondence with references\ngiven in a sitting which Mr. Irving had with Mrs. Leonard.\nThe following are some of the references\n:\nA.S.

Mrs. T. would have preserved a\nmemory of the suggestion, and this may have operated\nto direct the clairvoyant faculty of Mrs. Elhott or Topsy\ntowards Miss Newton.\nThe difference between the frequency of these references\nin this particular sub-case and the whole series is 5 to 2 ;\nthis is not so great as definitely to exclude chance, and\nit may be simply a coincidence that they are relatively\nmore numerous with this sitter than with others. How-\never, that it should be coupled with the suggestion that\nthis communicator should attempt this form of co-\noperation is at least curious.\nThis concludes the discussion on the psychological aspect\nof the case.\n\f112] Sitthigs with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 143\nB. Psychical Research.\nThe principal point at issue for psychical research is\nthat of the source of the communications ; at the back\nof all subsidiary questions lies that of survival.\nIt is not suggested that the evidence contained herein\nis in the smallest degree conclusive in this matter, in\nfact it must be admitted that, so far as evidence for the\ncontinuance of conscious existence after death is concerned,\nthe case is disappointing.\nAfter much consideration it was decided that the\nbest way to deal with this part of the subject was to\nenumerate the various hypotheses which have at any\ntime been put forward, and to discuss how they fit the\nfacts of the present case.\nBy this method it seemed possible to extract the fullest\nvalue from the material available ; it might prove that\nsome of the hypothesis might be almost eliminated, others\nrendered doubtful, and others partially confirmed.\nThe utmost that can be looked for is the arrangement\nof the current hypotheses in an order of probabihty.\nThe method adopted here is the apphcation of the\nfacts to the hypothesis, the alternative being the applica-\ntion of the hj^potheses to the facts.\nNow it may be taken for granted that all hypotheses\nwhich have seriously been suggested have some basis of\nfact behind them ; the object in view being to test their\nvaKdity, it seems more economical of effort to select\nfrom our heterogeneous mass of facts those which appear\nto confirm or refute, than to take the mass as it stands\nand attempt an hypothesis to cover it.\nIn one case we start with an orderly framework and\ntry to fit in the pieces, in the other we take a jumble\nof pieces and try to arrange them like a jigsaw puzzle.\nIf it should appear that this method of deahng with\nthe facts of this case is, even in a small degree, fruitful\nof results, it can be employed as a skeleton technique in\nother cases where the material is richer.\nThe hypotheses with which we have to deal may be\narranged into four groups, one of which, viz. the last,\n\f144 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\ncontains so many varieties, all of which are so extremely\nnebulous in character that it will be possible to do very\nlittle with theories which come under this heading.\nThe groups are (1) Normal.\n(2) Supernormal faculty.\n(3) Survivalist.\n(4) Mystical.\nUnder Group (1) come all explanations by chance, fraud,\nfishing, etc.\nUnder Group (2) come all hypotheses which rely on the\noperation of a supernormal faculty. It includes (a)\nTelepathy, {b) Clairvoyance, (c) Object reading (old term,\nPsychometry).\nIt also covers all such theories as Osty's. The writer\nof this report evolved independently a somewhat similar\ntheory. On reading Dr. Osty's book, La Connaissance\nSupranormale, he perceived the substantial identity of the\ntwo theories. It will be called, then, Osty's theory, and\nhis account of it will be quoted ;\npossible modifications\nand extensions may be suggested.\nGroup (3). Survivalist theories. [a) We have, first,\ntheories of the type suggested by Dr. Walter Leaf and\nDr. Broad ; these postulate a sort of partial survival or\npersistence of memory elements.\n{h) Survivalist theories proper. These are the spiritistic\ntheories of all degrees of refinement or crudity.\nGroup (4). Mystical theories. This class is the most\ntroublesome to deal with, the theories being\u2014as has been\nsaid\u2014nebulous and difficult to grasp. There is no guid-\ning principle by means of which they may be classified,\nso that there is no possibility of satisfying oneself that\nthe whole ground has been covered. Entirely fresh forms\nmay at any time be suggested. The only two which\nwill be even briefly mentioned here are the theories\nof Cosmic Consciousness and the Theosophic Theory of\nAkashic Records.\nCriticism of theories of this tyi)e is bound to be unsatis-\nfactory. The essence of mysticism is that it is mystical,\nwhich implies that it cannot be described in ordinary\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 145\nlanguage, but can only be apprehended by a special\nfaculty, the possession of which constitutes a person a\nmystic. Those who, like the writer, lay no claim to\npossessing this faculty in the very smallest degree cannot\nhope to understand these theories, and to criticise that\nwhich one does not understand, though not an altogether\nunknown procedure, is hardly one to commend itself to\nanyone who aspires to be scientific.\nThe theories will be discussed in the order given,\nalthough a certain amount of overlapping is unavoidable.\nGroup I. Normal.\nAs regards the first group, the most important of\nthese, viz. chance, has already been referred to in the\npreface. What has been there said need not be repeated,\nbut a few amplifying details of the experiments may be\ngiven\n.\nThere were nineteen A.S. sittings selected for the\nsecond experiment (see p. 51), all of which had given\nfairly good results with the original contributors or as\nintrusion sittings.\nThere was no instance of any one of these consistently\ngiving scores for chance.^ The highest average score was\n20%, being made up as follows : 0, 0, 41, 17, 41, real\nscore was 55% ; the next highest was 0, 14, 61, 0,\n12 = 17%, real score 71%. From this it may be argued\nthat the high chance scores were not due to any pecu-\nliarity in the matter of the sittings.\nIt is held by some that a fraudulent medium can pro-\nduce a spurious appearance of the possession of super-\nnormal faculty by the judicious selection of commonplace\nremarks, combined with an acute observation of the\nsitter and a quickness to seize upon and utilise hints and\nshght indications. This may well be true.\nThe particular series before us, however, being all Absent\nSitter sittings, observation of the sitter is ruled out, and it\nseems probable that the artificial nature of a sitting made\nup entirely of commonplaces would be apparent on the\nsurface.\n1 For system of scoring see p. 59.\nK\n\f146 H. F. SaltmarsJi. [part\nNot only is it the fact that these communications\nwere not composed entirely of commonplace remarks, but\nthe figures of this chance experiment show that no one\nparticular sitting was better adapted than the rest for\ngiving high chance scores. With the exception of one,\nwhich happened to be used once only for pseudo-anno-\ntation, there was no case of any of these nineteen\nsittings escaping one or more zero scores.\nThe following diagrams have been drawn to exhibit\ngraphically the results of this second chance experiment.\nThey are given in the form of the usual graph, although\nthe subject-matter is not strictly speaking susceptible to\nthat form of treatment. The graph properly shows the\nlocus of a point governed by two variables which are\nproportioned to the co-ordinates. In this case there is\nonly one variable, but for the purpose of showing the\nresults graphically the horizontal co-ordinate has been\nreplaced by a purely arbitrary arrangement of the sittings ;\nthey are, in fact, arranged in order of date, thus each\nhorizontal division represents a single sitting or set of\nsittings. The diagram should properly have been a\nseries of vertical lines only, but it was thought that a\ncurve would be more conspicuous and show the desired\ncomparison more clearly.\nThe diagrams marked A. are for each separate pseudo-\nannotator ; that marked B. is for all the annotators, but\nin this case each horizontal division stands for the set\nof sittings which he annotated, and the scores are the\naverage. The dotted line is for real scores, the black\nline for chance scores. There is a certain superficial\nappearance of parallelism between the real and chance\ncurves in certain of these diagrams, notably A. 5, 6, 7, 9,\n11 and 12, but a closer inspection shows that it is more\napparent than real. , It would be unsafe to draw any\nconclusions from it.\n\f\f\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliolt. 147\nThe following table shows the various chance and real\nscores for each sitting :\n^\nSitting.

[part\nIt will be observed that while the percentage of general\ncongruity is not very much different in the chance sit-\ntings, that of the inconsistent is considerably higher.\nHowever, it cannot be said that the superiority to chance\nis so overwhelming as to afford proof that chance alone\ncould not have been responsible for the phenomena.\nIt must be admitted, therefore, that the experiments\nundertaken to test the hypothesis of chance are not\nconclusive.\nBy this it must be clearly understood that although\nchance is not definitely excluded it is by no means\nproved that supernormal knowledge of some sort is\nabsent.\nApart from the objective proof which experiments such\nas these are capable of providing, one may attain sub-\njective certainty, or at any rate conviction of high\nprobabiUty, from a study of the details of the case.\nThe grounds on which this conviction is based are not,\nhowever, capable of being presented in a succinct and\neasily assimilable form ; the judgment is an individual\none, and is only attainable by those who have studied\nthe records of the sittings in detail.\nIt is only possible to put on record the fact that a\nprolonged study of the case has convinced the writer that\nchance alone is not responsible for the veridical state-\nments contained therein, and to indicate briefly the type\nof evidence on which he has formed his opinion.\n1st. The fact that the average scores of the S.P.\nsittings is more than double that of the A.S. The only\ncondition present in the former which is absent in the\nlatter is the actual presence of the sitter. It is, there-\nfore, a logical inference that that factor is responsible for\nthe increase in veridical matter.\nAfter making full allowance for normal causes, such as\ninformation obtained by the medium from direct observa-\ntion of the sitter, information given away by the sitter's\nremarks, fishing, groping, and so on, there remains a sub-\nstantial residuum which cannot be so accounted for. The\ninference is that it is of supernormal origin.\n2nd. A comparison of the quality of the evidence in\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 149\nreal sittings and pseudo-sittings. In the former, where\nwe have a number of sittings with the same sitter or\ngroup of sitters, there is a considerable amount of con-\ntinuity running through the series, the same ostensible\ncommunicator appears again and again, there is psycho-\nlogical consistency between the various sittings and\ncorrespondences between statements made in different\nsittings.\nTliis is notably absent from the pseudo-sittings. The\nchance coincidences are more scraj)py, we find different\nostensible communicators in different sittings or even in\nthe same sitting. The general impression derived from a\nstudy of the evidence is that it presents the peculiar\ncharacteristics of chance coincidence to a greater degree\nthan is apj)arent in the real sittings.\nIn scoring the pseudo-sittings one becomes aware of the\nnecessity of stretching coincidence to allow \" hits.\"\n3rd. In the real sittings we occasionally get statements\nconcerning events which are so accurate, and descriptions\nof the characteristics of ostensible communicators, which\nare so apt as practically to enforce the conviction that\nchance alone cannot account for them ; for example, see\nthe character-sketch of Miss X.'s father given in the\nextracts on page 81 et seq.\nWith nothing to guide her it seems impossible that the\nmedium should have been able by pure chance to des-\ncribe with such accuracy so unusual a character and\nstate of family relationships as is there portrayed.\nAn attempt has been made to arrive at a more accurate\nmethod of estimating the value of evidence.\nAcknowledgment must be made to Mr. S. G. Soal, and\nour thanks are due to him for the trouble he has taken\nin giving the benefit of his mathematical knowledge and\nalso of his great experience in psychical research. As,\nhowever, the formula which he has devised and the\nreasoning on which it is based are of rather a technical\nnature the matter will be dealt with separately.\nThe other normal sources of information, such as\ndehberate invention, fishing, etc., have already been\ndiscussed.\n\f150 H. F. Salfmarsh. [part\nCroup II. iSupernorbial Faculty.\nThe next set of hypotheses are those classed under the\nheading of Supernormal Faculties, and of these telepathy\nis the first to be discussed. It is assumed that telepathy\nwill be admitted as a vera causa ; there are still a few\ndie-hards who deny it, but the majority of those who\nhave given any attention to the evidence agree that even\nif it be not rigorously proved, the case for it is very\nstrong ; the opinion of those who have not studied the\nevidence is, of course, worthless.\nBy telepathy is meant the transmission of information\nor impressions from one mind to another by means other\nthan the normal senses. The nature of the process is\nobscure, but it would seem that two minds at least are\nrequisite, that is to say, the agent from whom the\ninformation is derived and the percipient who receives it.\nIt appears at first sight logical to divide the phenomena\ninto two classes : first, those where the agent is active\nand the percipient relatively passive\u2014this would be\ntelepathy proper ; the second, where the percipient is\nactive and the agent relatively passive\u2014this should,\nstrictly speaking, be called mind-reading. If, however,\nthere be any truth in the theory propounded earlier in\nthis report and called psychical osmosis, this classification\nmay be inapphcable ; both agent and percipient are\npassive, except in so far as one or other of them esta-\nblishes the necessary rapport.\nFrom the evidence derived from experiments in tele-\npathy there is, nevertheless, some ground for holding that\nintention to transmit a definite message has some efficacy\nin getting that message through. Whether this is never\nmore than the endowment of the idea with a higher\ndegree of conative energy and in consequence greater\nmobility, as was suggested in the osmosis theory, or\nwhether there is any definite act of sending a message,\nseems impossible to determine. It might be said, how-\never, in either case that the agent is in some way active.\nIt is possible that all mental activity depends on relative\nconative potential. At the present stage of our know-\nledge the safest position ajjpears to be to allow provision-\n\f112] Sittings tvith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 151\nally both types of activity to exist. The actual processes\nemployed in sending and receiving the messages un-\ndoubtedly belong to the subliminal part of the mind,\nand are thus not open to inspection. It is doubtful\nwhether our most powerful instruments of research, viz.\nhypnosis and psycho-analysis, can penetrate sufficiently\ndeeply to arrive at that stratum of consciousness which\nis the theatre of the telepathic process, but it would be\nextremely interesting if the attempt could be made.\nAs regards mind-reading we are on still more debatable\nground\u2014the number of those who are prepared to accept\nit as a vera causa is less than for telepathy. There is,\nto begin with, an extremely strong instinctive repugnance\nto the idea that the privacy of one's thoughts can be\ninvaded by an inquisitive intruder, and that one's memories,\nboth conscious and subconscious, can be ransacked.\nFrom the point of view of the value for psychical\nresearch of the evidence in communications purporting to\ncome from the surviving spirits of deceased human\nbeings, this question of the possibility and Mmitations of\nmind-reading is of the highest importance, and one\ncannot get very far without adopting a definite attitude\nof acceptance or rejection towards it.\nPushed to its logical conclusion, the faculty of mind-\nreading means that the contents of the minds and\nmemories, both conscious and subconscious, of all hving\nbeings are open to inspection by the possessor of that\nfaculty. This is little short of potential omniscience, and\nalthough there have been some who, after mature con-\nsideration, have accepted this position, in the opinion of\nthe writer almost any hypothesis should be preferred to\none which ascribes to the human mind powers so utterly\nout of parallel with anything else we know about it and\nhmitations so wide as to be almost non-existent.\nNot only must all other possible hypotheses be tested,\nbut even in the event of their failing to cover the pheno-\nmena, positive evidence of the clearest and strongest\ndescription would have to be produced before such an\nextension could be allowed to the normal powers of the\nmind.\n\f152 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nAn hypothesis such as this cannot be cstahUslied by\ndefault of the other candidates until we are certain that\nall possible alternatives have been eliminated, and to\nattain this certainty we should require to know a very\ngreat deal more than we do. In our present state of\nknowledge it is always possible that some new hypothesis\nmay be suggested.\nVery different from the unrestricted power of mind-\nreading, for which it is submitted there is no direct\nevidence, is the very hmited kind which is suggested by\nsome of the facts of the sittings. This power, if it\nexists at all, extends only to the reading of some\nparts of the contents of the mind of a person actually\npresent or with whom the percipient is somehow\nra.'P'port.\nIt is submitted here, however, that none of the facts\nwhich may be adduced as evidence for the jDossession of\nthis limited power of mind-reading are not equally well\nexplained by the hyj^othesis of psychical osmosis. The\nactivity of the percij)ient would then be hmited to the\nactual making of the contact between the two minds ;\nwhat then passed as a result of that contact is a matter\nwhich is not determined by any action on his or her\npart.\nThis view is held to be more in parallel with what we\nknow of the normal operations of the mind in acquiring\ninformation. The eye does not go out to seek that which\nit sees nor the ear the sounds it hears ; the most that\nthe percipient can do is so to adjust his organs of sense\nthat they may be in the best position for receiving the\nimpressions impinging on them from the outside. Of\ncourse, arguments from analogy and parallelism are not\nconclusive, these supernormal phenomena may be entirely\nsui generis, but, as has been j)ointed out, we can only\ndraft our psychological and psychical principles on hnes\nborrowed from the physical world ;\nif, then, analogy\nplays so large a part in normal psychology we may as\nwell be consistent and stick to it throughout the whole\npiece.\nThere is one further point which tells against the\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 153\ntlieory of unlimited mind-reading. For a l)eing endo\\\\cd\nwitli potential omniscience, and having at her disposal\nall the contents of the mind she is reading, the medium\nexhibits an extraordinary lack of intelhgence in selecting\nthe items of information which she retails. The ordinary\nperson would do far better : surely potential omniscience\nshould not fall behind our ordinary everyday intelligence.\nThe attitude, therefore, of this report towards mind-\nreading is that of denial of its existence, except in a\nvery limited and restricted form.\nWe may now see how the facts of this case are explic-\nable by the hypothesis of telepathy in the sense above\nindicated.\nThe first sahent fact is the marked superiority of the\nscores in the S.P. sittings over the A.S. This can only\nbe attributed to the presence of the sitter. It is gener-\nally assumed that proximity is favourable to telepathy,\nalthough the evidence for this assumption is not so clear\nas might be wished. It seems, however, fairly safe to\nconclude that telepathy between the sitter and the\nmedium plays a considerable part in S.P. sittings, and is\none of the causes\u2014and probably a large one\u2014of their\nsuperiority of score.\nWith very few exceptions the information given in the\nS.P. sittings was such that it might have been derived\nfrom the sitter's mind, and in the few cases where it\nwas demonstrably not so the facts were of such a nature\nas to be accessible to supernormal observation or clair-\nvoyance. For example, in S.P. 11, the medium referring\nto the rehc, a watch, states that there is some writing\ninside\u2014this was correct, though unknown to the sitter ;\nin S.P. 27 it is stated that water had come into the\nsitter's house\u2014also correct and unknown.\nA power of observation which could transcend the\nordinary hmitations of space could have acquired these\nfacts.\nThere is, so far as can be discovered, no single instance\nof facts unknown to the sitter being given which could\nhave been in the possession of no one but the ostensible\ncommunicator\n.\n\f154 H. F. SaUmarsJi. [part\nTaking the S.P. sittings by themselves it may be said\nthat the siijjcrncjrmal knowk'dge contained therein can be\ncomj^letely covered by the hypothesis of telepathy from\nthe sitter, together with a small amomit of supernormal\nobservation or clairvoyance.\nAs regards the A. 8. sittings the case is different.\nThough facts unknown to the contributor of the relic are\nno more in evidence than in S.P. sittings, the absence of\nany means of rapport (apart fi^om that furnished by the\nrehc) stands in the way of explanation by telepathy alone.\nIf we take as an analogy for telepathy proper calling up\nthe percipient on the telephone by the agent, it may be\nsaid that while the agent knows the percipient's number\nhe does not know the appropriate occasion on which to\nput through a call. An intrusion might be considered as\na call put through on an inappropriate occasion.\nThe fact that has to be accounted for is that so many\nof the A.S. sittings exhibit a relevance between the com-\nmunications and the owner or contributor of the rehc.\nIf it be taken for granted that in successful A.S. sittings\nthe medium becomes in some way aware of the identity\nof the contributor of the relic and gets into rapport with\nhim, then we might suppose that telepathic exchange of\ninformation miglit take place between them. If this is\nwhat we have called telepathy proper, that is to say an\nactivity on the j^art of the agent, then we must suppose\nthat in the first place the medium calls up, as it were,\nthe contributor, and informs him that the sitting is being\nheld, and he, in response, conveys to the medium the\nrequisite information.\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that none of this would\nbe in the normal suprahminal consciousness of either party.\nIf instead of telepathy proper some theory such as\nthat of psychical osmosis be accepted the position seems\neasier. Once the medium gets the necessary direction\nfrom the relic it only remains for her to get her mind\ninto contact with that of the contributor for the process\nof infiltration to commence.\nThe crux of the whole thing is, therefore, the part\nplayed by the relic. This matter must be dealt with\n\f112] Sittings ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 155\n])efore any further progress can be made, and as any\ndiscussion must bear on the hypothesis of object-reading,\nor psychometry, that hypothesis will be chscussed here\nalthough out of its proper place.\nThe conclusion arrived at in the discussion on the\nfunction of the rehc, in the psychological section of this\nreport, was that some causal nexus exists between the\nhandling of the relic by the medium and the statements\nwhich she makes at the sitting.\nWe have now to press the enquiry further, and endea-\nvour to determine the nature of the process which takes\nplace.\nThe hypothesis of object-reading is that the medium\nin some supernormal fashion obtains from the relic itself\ninformation relating to its past history, events in which\nit has taken a part or of which it has been, so to speak,\na spectator.\nWe must assume that every event leaves its trace on\nthe material objects present, and that from these traces a\nsuitably sensitive person can recover a history of the event.\nIt is extremely difficult to imagine, even in outline,\nwhat these traces may be, or how a material object can\npreserve them. It is true that we can sometimes obtain\nfrom traces left on a material object some knowledge of\nits past history, as, for example, when we see a stone\nbearing longitudinal scratches of a certain kind we say\nthat that stone has undergone glacial action. In these\ncases, however, the information is really arrived at by\ninference\u2014we need past experience from which to draw it.\nThe only kind of traces which by themselves could\nconvey the entire history of an event seems to be written\nwords or a j^ictorial record hke a cinematograph film : it\nis obvious that nothing analogous is the case here. How-\never, our inabihty to imagine how, for example, a gold\ncuff link can bear the record of a long series of events,\nboth physical and mental, in the history of its owner, is\nnot necessarily an insuperable obstacle to the hypothesis\nof object-reading, although it is a grave defect. We\ncannot eiect our incapacities into absolute impossibihties,\nnor arrogate for our limitations a cosmic status.\n\f156 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nFortunately in this case we have positive evidence\nwliich settles the question for us b}^ rendering the object-\nreading hypothesis untenable.\nA very large part of the veridical information given\nconcerns events in which the relic played no part what-\nsoever, for example, the events which have been classed\nas Post-mortem. Reference to the table on page 29\nshows that in some 39 A.S. sittings the Ante-mortem\nstatements number 237 veridical, 275 non-veridi^cal, while\nthe Post-mortem number 197 veridical and 127 non-\nveridical.\nIt is, of course, possible that in some of the post-\nmortem events the relic might have been actually present,\nbut there could have been few such cases ;\nmoreover,\nthere is no reason for thinking that it was present in\nall or indeed any of the Ante-mortem events. In fact,\nwhen the relic is such a thing as a letter written by the\nostensilale communicator, as was sometimes the case, it is\nclear that it could have been present in very few of the\nevents recorded. We should have to amplify the object-\nreading hypothesis and suppose that simple contact with\nan object impregnates it with a condensed history of the\nperson who handles it. This seems to be going beyond\nthe most fantastic limits of supposition.\nIt is submitted that this fact is sufficient to settle the\nmatter quite definitely.\nWe may say, then, that the hypothesis of object-\nreading, whatever its validity may be in other cases, will\nnot cover the facts here in question. This conclusion\nagrees with the result of Dr. Osty's investigation ; he\nlays it down that the relic does not exercise a \" fonction\nenregistrateur,\" but only a \" fonction directrice.\" His\ntheories will be discussed later.\nIt sec^ms, therefore, that an hypothesis of telepathy on\nthe fines of what has been here called psychical osmosis\nwill cover the facts, provided we can account for the\ndirective function of the relic in some way not inconsistent\nwith that hypothesis. When we come to discuss the last\nof the theories in this class we shall see how far this\ncondition can be comjDfied with.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 157\nThe next hypothesis to be discussed is that of Clair-\nvoyance.\nHere, again, it is necessary, as a prehminary, to lay\ndown some Kmitations to the meaning of the term. If\nby the word \" clair-voyance \" we mean the poAvcr to\nacquire knowledge of any fact, past, present or future,\nphysical or mental, by the simple exercise of a sujjer-\nnormal faculty, we can, of course, say that the hy^Dothesis\ncovers the facts ; it is, in fact, so wide that it will\ncover any conceivable instance of supernormal knowledge.\nBut unless we can give any details of the modus operandi\nof the process this is surely a most blatant example of\nexplaining ignotum per ignotins and obscurum jjer obscurius.\nIt cannot be held to be a satisfactory solution of a\nmystery to postulate a still more mysterious faculty as\nexplanation.\nClairvoyance such as this would be an even nearer\napproximation to omniscience than unlimited mind-reading.\nIt is necessary, therefore, to lay down some limitations\nto the meaning of the term before the hypothesis can be\nused for practical purposes. It is suggested here that\nthe supernormal factor in clairvoyance is the partial\ntranscendence of the limitations which ordinary spatial\nand temporal conditions impose on observation. Only\nthose events which could have been observed had the\nclairvoyant been present at the time and place of their\noccurrence are accessible to the faculty.\nIt still remains, no doubt, sufficiently mysterious, but\nat least it can be said that some colour is lent to it by\nmodern mathematical and physical theoiies of time and\nspace.\nThere is a considerable amount of evidence that some\nsuch faculty does actually exist, and there are a few\nincidents in the present experiment which seem best\nexphcable along these Knes Two have already been\ncited when discussing the hypothesis of telepathy, although\nin one of these particular cases the knowledge was almost\ncertainly in the mind of some other person and might\nhave been drawn therefrom The incidents referred to\nare those of the writing inside the watch and the water\n\f158 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\ncoming into the house. There are, however, two other\nincidents of a rather pecuHar nature, which present better\nevidence of the exercise of some sort of clairvoyant\nfaculty and also throw some light on its nature.\nThe first is as follows. In A.S. 39 Topsy says :\nDoesn't know whether its where that lady buried or whether\nconnected with that lady, but, you know, where they buries\npeople, something connected with her, she points to herself ;\nshe says, the whole row is now filled except one ; looks like\nwhole row of graves, does you understand ? There has been\nsome one buried quite recently, you know, quite soon and it\nwas in rain and j ust brightened up a little for actual service\nand then rain.\nThe note is :\nThis is very characteristic of her, she was much interested\nin the Golders Green Crematorium where her ashes are\ndeposited and frequently spoke of it Her urn is in a row\naccommodating eight, there is one vacant space.\nThe most recent date in the row was Sept. 1926. The\nsitting was dated Nov. 20, 1926. Further investigation\nrevealed the fact that although an inscription had been\nplaced on the tablet of the niche in question the niche\nitself was not filled ; the cremation took place in San\nFrancisco. No information concerning the weather at the\ntime of the cremation was obtainable.\nThe second case is from an extra A.S. sitting with\nMr. Irving. It was a normal sitting, i.e. the medium\nwas not in trance. The relevant passage is as follows.\nAfter referring to a church, the medium says :\nWoman in a shawl, buff with red check, wearing a hat very\nlike a man's tall hat, on the right side less than half way.\nAbout 3rd row and in corner seat.\nMr. Irving 's note is :\nI went on ahead with a missioner, counted the seats from\nthe front and sat down nearest the aisle in the 3rd seat.\nMy sister-in-law came in later, passed by me and sat next,\nnearest the wall. As no one else was in the seat slie put\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 159\nher mackintosh in the corner against the wall. I should\ndescribe my sister's coat as being buff in colour with a very\nfaint tinge of pink in the buff. It had a large check pattern\noutlined in red and, I think, also yellow in some lines. My\nsister's hat was black, something like a man's bowler, but\nrather taller and turned up a little way ^^ith pink in one\nplace.\nHis sister-in-law writes :\nI wore a buff-coloured coat, of a large check pattern, the\nline of the check being red. I had on a black hard hat\nvery like a man's bowler, but turned up with pink. Look-\ning from the chancel, I sat in the 3rd row from the front,\nright-hand side nearest the wall.\nNow the peculiarity common to both these cases is\nthat the medium makes a mistake. In the first she\nstates that the grave or niche had been filled, whereas it\nwas still empty though an inscription had been placed\non the tablet. In the second she misdescribes the\ngarment worn by the woman in the church as a shawl\ninstead of a coat. Both these errors are of the same\ncharacter, that is to say, the erroneous statements are\nsuch as might have been made by a person who had had\na fleeting superficial glance at the actual physical situation\nand jumped to the wrong conclusion.\nIn the first case anyone who observed an inscription\ngiving the name and date of death on the tablet of a niche\nin the crematorium would naturally conclude that the niche\nhad been used, and contained the ashes of the deceased.\nHad the information been derived from the mind of any\nperson connected with the actual occurrence such an\nincorrect inference could hardly have been made.\nIn the second case all the details of the scene are\ncorrectly given, such as the jjosition of the pew in which\nthe woman was seated, the shape of her hat, the colour\nand pattern of her clothes. The error lies in describing\nthe coat as a shawl. Now this error is one which the\nwearer of the garment would never have made, nor\nindeed anyone connected with her. The social status of\nthe family to which all the actors belonged was such\n\f160 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nthat the wearing of a phaid shawl for church-going would\nbe an almost inconceivable idea.\nIt is jDlausible to suggest, therefore, that the informa-\ntion in these cases was not derived from the mind of\nanother person, and the peculiar nature of the mistakes\nmade is consistent with the hypothesis that the source\nwas some sort of dim fleeting glance at the actual scene.\nIt may be suggested, therefore, tentative hypo-\nthesis, that clairvoyance consists of a temporary and\npartial removal or relaxation of the limitations imposed\non normal observation by the conditions of space and\ntime under which they ordinarily function.\nThere are many other incidents in the sittings whiqh\ncan be explained on this hypothesis, such as the descrip-\ntions of places, many of the veridical references to facts\noccurring at the offices of the S.P.R., references to Miss\nNewton and her affairs, and so on. However, in these\ninstances the hypothesis of telepathy is not definitely\nexcluded, and there is no ground on which to base a\nchoice between the two.\nThe conclusion arrived at, therefore, is that there is\nevidence of the existence and exercise of a clairvoyant\nfaculty as hereinbefore described. It remains to be\ndetermined whether the whole amount of the supernormal\nphenomena contained in the sittings can be ascribed to\nthis cause. If the relaxation of the spatial and temporal\nUmitations on normal observation impHes that the glance\nof the medium can travel back into the past and observe\nevents which happened long ago, then it may be said\nthat all the information contained in the statements\nwhich have been classified as Physical might have been\nobtained from this source ; but we can hardly make the\nexplanation cover the non-physical facts, that is to say,\nstatements concerning events or conditions which could\nnot have been observed by a person suddenly arriving on\nthe spot. To do so we should have to grant such an\nextension to clairvoyant faculty as to render it almost\nequivalent to omniscience. As in the case of unlimited\nmincl-reading, very definite and positive evidence of the\nexistence of such a faculty would be required before it\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 161\ncould be accepted as a legitimate hypothesis : to postulate\nit as an explanation of these very commonplace medium-\nistic phenomena is to invoke a greater mystery to solve\na less, and amounts, when all is said and done, to an\nacknowledgment of our complete ignorance.\nWe may, therefore, add to the conclusion above arrived\nat that this faculty of clairvoyance is not sufficient by\nitself to account for all the phenomena.\nThe next matter for discussion is the work of Dr. Osty\nas given in his book La Connaissance Supranormale. I\nquote from a translation by Mr. Stanley de Brath, Super-\nnormal Faculties in Man.\nAs regards the major part of the book it is not neces-\nsary to speak ; it will suffice to say that the conclusions\narrived at by Dr. Osty as regards many points, notably\nsymbolism, etc., are almost identical with the views taken\nin this report. (It should, perhaps, be said here that\nthese conclusions were reached entirely independently.)\nOn page 136 he says :\nThe first phase is the subconscious elaboration of the\nsupernormal cognitions.\nIn a second phase, these elaborated cognitions are manifest\nunder the form of mental images of different sensorial kinds,\nmore or less accurately representative, and often extending to\nhallucinatory objectification.\nFinally, the intellectual function called \" conscious \" comes\ninto play, interprets the images that have arisen from the\ndepths of thought and translates them into words.\nOn page 137 he says\n:\nDuring this phase the elaboration of the supernormal cogni-\ntions takes place : and in it the mental images most fitted\nto transfer cognition from the unconscious to the conscious\nare sought, found, organized and developed into representa-\ntions.\nAnd a little lower down on the same page :\nThe work of supernormal cognition is fully accomplished\noutside the consciousness of the percipient.\nL\n\f162 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nAnd, finally, on page 140, he says :\nIt is by using the stock of mental imagery\u2014concrete images,\nabstract images, symbols and allegories\u2014and by utilizing the\nwhole constructive power of imagination and all the resources\nof interior language, that the transcendental mode of thought\nconveys information to the mode that we call conscious.\nIt is in Part IV. of the book that the theories here to\nbe discussed are set forth. Dr. Osty approaches the\nmatter in the form of three questions, namely : What\nis the source of the supernormal information obtained\nby the \" sujet metagnome \" (Dr. Osty's terra for his\nmediums) concerning the states of life of a human\nbeing (1st) present at the sitting, (2nd) living, but distant\nin space, (3rd) distant in time ?\nThe answer to the first of these questions is given on\npage 183 as follows :\nWhen a metagnomic subject reveals the states of life in\na person placed in his presence, his paranormal knowledge\ncomes from that person.\nAs regards the second question, on page 192 he says :\nExperiment therefore leads us to consider the case of\nmetagnomy on a distant person as analogous to that when\nthat person is in presence. The two cases differ only by\ndistance in space.\nOn page 194 we find:\nAmong all the hypotheses v\/hich we can conceive and accept,\nthat of interpsychic communication at a distance is the only\none suggested by jsractical experiment, and the only one which\nwhen apphed to the genesis of the phenomena, makes them\ngenerally intelligible.\nAnd lower down :\nBeyond the human individualities that our senses detach\nfrom the continuity of Nature, we glimpse an immense mental\nworld subjacent to appearances in which particular identities\nseem to be linked in an inconceivable collective psychic life.\nIt is from this vast latent life of thoughts, of thought, that\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 163\nsensitives unconsciously draw the substance of their revela-\ntions, being endowed with a sense which enables them to\ndistinguish the evolving schemes of individual lives.\nAs regards the third question, that is to say, informa-\ntion concerning a person distant in time, the case of the\ngreatest importance is obviously where that person is\ndead.\nOn page 199 he says\n:\n\u2022 Accumulated experiment shows that sensitives deal with a\ndead personality in the same way as with a living one.\nOn page 203, after having discussed at some length a\ndefinition of the word personality and the bearing of\nsuch abnormalities as cleavages, multiple personalities and\nspirit guides, he says :\nThis human personality, so unstable that it is incessantly\nmodified, so little homogeneous that strong emotion, intoxica-\ntion or suggestion can dissociate it, so little constructed to\nendure that it may even die before the death of the body,\nso precarious and so obviously perishable, is not, as we have\nseen in the preceding pages, the informing centre whence\nmetagnomic subjects draw their knowledge when they work on\na life in progress. A fortiori it cannot be the informing\ncentre when death has extinguished it.\nHe goes on to suggest two alternative explanations of\nthe source from which a knowledge of the history of a\nparticular life is drawn.\nThis story, however, subsists somewhere, since metagnomic\nsubjects are able to reconstruct it ; and how can it be\nimagined to subsist if it is not in a thought or a memory ?\nIn what thought ? In what memory ? This is to be\nsought for.\nIs there behind individual seeming a collective consciousness,\na thought outside time and space, where every reality is\nrepresented, of which all phenomena known to us are reflected\nby our senses ; a mysterious well-spring whose knowledge\nflows through the particular psychisms within the limits that\npertain to each ?\n\f164 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nIs there behind the apparent human personaUty a real\npersonality, a transcendental individuality clothed in matter\nplaying a part in the life of the world, whose persistence\nwould be the memory containing a life story, from whom the\nmetagnomic subject draws after death that which he drew\nbefore death ?\nOr is the source of supernormal knowledge so unreachable\nby the very constitution of our intelligence that our actual\nconcepts must necessarily be foreign to it ?\nDr. Osty does not deny survival. In a footnote to\npage 133 he says :\n1 do not deny the survival of human personality. I\nneither deny nor assert it.\nBut it would seem from the passage quoted from page\n203 that the personality of which he is speaking is not the\nmanifest supraliminal personality, that which is subject to\ncleavages, modifications, etc., for he says of it, \" Quand\nla mort Va eteint.'' It is, presumably, a transcendental\nself, which is \" Affrayichie des cojistraintes intellectuelles du\ntemps et de Fespace.\"\nIt will be seen tliat one of the above suggestions\nshould, under our classification, be considered as mystical,\nthat is to say, where he suggests a collective conscious-\nness from which the information is drawn. The second\nsuggestion is a modified form of the survival hypothesis.\nAs regards the function of the relic he contents him-\nself with showing reason why this must be held to be a\nfonction directrice\" and not a \" fonction e7iregistrateur.\"\nThe exact nature of this function and the means whereby\nit is effected remain still \" d chercher.\"\nIn so far as what he says as regards symbolism and\nthe psychological mechanism of the transference of the\nimpressions is concerned his conclusions coincide with\nthose arrived at in this report, though some further steps\nin hypothesis have been herein taken, e.g. what has been\ncalled psychical osmosis.\nWhat he says of the function of the relic is also in\naccord with the view herein adopted, but on this point\nalso it may be possible to advance a little.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 165\nThere was an instructive incident which seemed to\nthrow some Hght on the matter. A contributor sent to\nthe Society six rehcs, one of which referred to his\ndeceased brother, the other five to members of his wife's\nfamily. The first A.S. sitting given with one of these\nrehcs appeared to contain information concerning his\nbrother, the Christian name, Arthur, and some veridical\nstatements concerning him and his widow's recent doings\nbeing given ; these latter were not within the knowledge\nof the contributor. The rehc used, however, turned out\nto be one of those which referred to the other side of\nthe family, and not the single one which referred to the\nbrother. With that relic a sitting was given in which\ninformation referring to the contributor's mother-in-law\nand her family was communicated. Now the brother\nwhen living had only a slight acquaintance with the\nother ostensible communicators. The only connecting\nlink between them was the contributor.\nIt seems reasonable to conclude from the above that\nthe directive function of the rehc is exercised, sometimes\nat any rate, in regard to the person who contributed it\nrather than to the original owner.\nThis is also illustrated in other cases : for example,\na relic referring to A. brings veridical communications\nconcerning an uncle of his ; a rehc of , Miss H 's\nfather, brings A. as ostensible communicator.\nIf one accepts the naive spiritistic hypothesis it can\nalways be said that the reasonable actions of the spirits\nare sufficient to account for these facts ; for example,\nA. after his death would meet his uncle, and they might\nvery Ukely arrange that the latter should do the com-\nmunicating on that particular occasion. Again, Miss\nH ^'s father and A. started their acquaintanceship on\nthe \"other side,\" having been brought together by the\nsittings of a private circle where both purported to come.\nThe fact that in the first case mentioned information was\ngiven concerning the deceased brother and his widow\nwhich was normally unknown to the contributor tends to\nconfirm this, but it must be admitted that this particular\npiece of evidence was not of the highest quahty.\n\f166 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nOn the other hand, if the spiritistic hypothesis be not\naccepted, we must suppose that the directive function of\nthe relic, sometimes at any rate, leads the mind of the\nmedium to that of the contributor, from whence informa-\ntion is derived or a further direction is obtained.\nIn view of the extreme rarity in this series of sittings\nof information normally ixnknown to the contributor being\ngiven, it seems that this direction to the contributor\ncovers almost all the phenomena, the few exceptions being\nperhaps susceptible of some other explanation such as\nclairvoyance. '\n;\nIt may be relevant to note that, with the exception of\nthe handhng by the various officers of the Society, which\nis the same for all relics, the fact of being selected,\npacked up and sent off for this particular purpose is the\nmost recent event in which the reUcs were concerned.\nThis 7nay be relevant, but the whole matter is so obscure\nthat it is impossible to say ;\nanyhow we have, in the\ncase of every relic, a recent incident in its history which,\nif known to the medium, would afford the required\ndirection to a source whence the information might be\ndrawn. The fact that in about 20% of the A.S. sittings\nthere are references to Miss Newton or the offices of the\nS.P.R. is suggestive in this connection.\nThere is a certain amount of negative evidence to\nweigh against this. In a few cases experiments were\ntried with entirely new articles, things bought at a shop\nand packed up straight away. For these, as for the\nordinary rehcs, the most recent event in their history\nwould give a direction to the sender, but in none of\nthese experimental cases did this occur.\nThe medium apparently recognised in every instance\nthat the ostensible communicator who appeared with these\npseudo-rehcs had no connection with them.\nThe sender would, of course, have in his mind when\ndespatching them the fact that the relics were false, and\nthis may have been sufficient to deflect the directive\nfunction. We could svippose that the mind of the\nmedium was in all these cases directed as usual to that\nof the sender, and that the first fact derived therefrom\n\f112] Sittings ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott. 167\nwas that of the falsity of the rehc. This might effectu-\nally put a stop to the transfer of any further impressions,\nand thus leave the mind of the medium open to an\nintrusion, or else to occupy itself with fantasy formation\nand the construction of purely imaginary incidents and\ncharacters.\nAnyhow, negative evidence based on so small a number\nof cases is of little value, and cannot weigh against any\npositive indications.\nThe salient feature of the A.S. sittings is the absence\nof any conscious Hnk between the medium and the person\nfrom whose mind the information is derived, whether that\nperson be the sender of the relic or the deceased owner.\nThe only connecting link is an inanimate object and, as\nwe have already seen, the hypothesis that this object\nbears on itself some record of the events described cannot\nbe considered tenable.\nWhat we require is some tentative explanation of the\nmanner in which the object can exercise its directive\nfunction. It acts as a finger-post pointing in a certain\ndirection, and we want to know how it does it.\nLet us consider first the case of an S.P. sitting. At\nfirst glance there appears no special difficulty in the fact\nof the medium's faculties, whatever they may be, being\ndirected to the sitter. However, when we consider that\nthese faculties are apparently in no way dependent on the\nnormal senses the phenomenon does not seem so simple.\nSo far as we can see, all the presence of the sitter\neffects, in so far as the transmission of supernormal\nknowledge is concerned, is to bring him into conscious\ncontact with the medium. All knowledge which the\nmedium's normal sensory observation of the sitter might\nafford must be ruled out. All that is left, therefore, is\nthe direction of the medium's mind towards the sitter.\nSome mediums require actual bodily contact, others do\nnot ; it is a case of individual habit, and probably has\nonly a purely subjective significance.\nDr. Osty writes on page 168 (Mr. de Brath's translation) :\nThe reader has learned that most metagnomic subjects, in\norder to set their paranormal faculty to woriv, are accustomed\n\f168 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nto touch the hand of the personaHty to be delineated ; i e. to\nput the two organisms\u2014the two nervous systems as it would\nseem\u2014into contact.\nAnd, again, on page 171 :\nA modality of energy of an unknown kind emanates from\nevery human being revealed by its power to set in motion\nthe special faculty of metagnomic subjects.\nNow this idea of an emanation has been current since\nthe days of Mesmer. It has recently been investigated,\nand received the support of the late Dr. Alriitz, but the\nexperiments of Professor Thouless and his associates,\nundertaken for the purpose of confirming his conclusions,\nhaving yielded nothing but negative results, tend to\ndiscredit the idea.\nNegative evidence cannot, of course, establish a positive\nconclusion ; but it seems reasonable, in the face of\nexperiments so carefully devised as those of Professor\nThouless, at any rate to suspend judgment, and to\nrequire unexceptionable positive evidence before admitting\nthe existence of any such entity as an emanation. The\nnature of the suggested emanation is not stated by those\nwho hold the theory, but it would seem as though it\nmust be a physical or pseudo-physical entity, for, if it\nbe purely psychical, what is there to distinguish it from\ntelejiathy, and what need is there to give it any other\nname ? On the principle of eniia non multiplicanda\npraeter necessitatem it seems better to hold provisionally\nthat the relation between the subject and the object is\npurely psychical.\nIf this be the case the fact of proximity between the\ntwo seems to have its importance reduced to that of\nindicating to the medium the source to which to apply\nfor her information. It may be, of course, that space as\nsuch has some effect on the psychical process, and the\nevidence of exj^erimental telepathy gives some support to\nthis view, but it seems as though the facts may be\nequally well explained on the hypothesis of \" direction\n\"\nonly.\nTo deal with the matter, let us consider the analogy\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 169\nwith normal recognition. The case of the person to be\nrecognised being in the presence of the subject is the\nsimplest, the senses of sight, hearing and touch all afford\nmeans of recognition, that is to say, they bring the\nsubject into conscious contact with the object, their lines\nof history intersect.\nWhere the object person is separated from the subject\nby a space sufficient to ehminate recognition by the\nordinary unaided senses, some indirect means may effect\nthe same thing ; the subject may know the name,\naddress or telephone number of the object person, which\nwill give the required \" direction \" and enable communica-\ntion to be made, provided the necessary physical means\nare available. Where the separation is both in space and\ntime no such physical means exists so far as we know,\nwith the exception of permanent material symbolic\ntraces, such as written words.\nNow the chief point of difference between the normal\nphenomena and the supernormal lies in the means of\ncommunication ; we must substitute for the physical\nprocesses of direct speech, writing, telephonic speech, etc.,\nthe psychical process of telepathy, whether in the form\nof what has here been called psychical osmosis or other-\nwise. Recognition is itseK a purely psychical pheno-\nmenon, whether it be effected by physical means or not.\nIn the case of recognition in the A.S. sittings, that is to\nsay, when it is effected by contact between the subject\nand an inanimate object, what we have to explain is\nhow the relation between the latter and the object\nperson can produce the same effect as direct contact.\nWe may say that at the moment when the medium\nhandles the relic their respective lines of history intersect,\nthe medium makes conscious contact with the relic.\nNormally she is able only to derive from sensory observa-\ntion a comparatively small amount of knowledge of the\nhistory of the rehc. As has been seen on page 109 the\nfact of the relic remaining wrapped up has no effect on\nthe quality of the information given ; it would seem,\ntherefore, that this normal knowledge may be neglected.\nSomehow or other the medium's consciousness is brought\n\f170 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\ninto relation with some person connected with the past\nhistory of the object.\nWe have seen reason for thinking that if a relation\ncould be established with the contributor of the relic the\nentire set of phenomena could be accounted for, given\nthe possibility of telepathy.\nNow the conscious contact between the medium and\nthe relic starts normally at the moment of handling it.\nIt may be called a point contact ; but if we suppose that\nthe normal conditions of time governing the medium's\nmind be relaxed this point contact might be extended\ninto a Kne contact, covering that part of the history of\nthe relic where it was selected, packed up and sent off\nto the Society. This would give the necessary \" direction.\"\nIt is very difficult to form any idea of a consciousness\ngoverned by different conditions of time or to imagine\nwhat it would be like, but a possible mode may conceivably\nbe based on the conception of the \" specious present.\"\nAs is well known, normal psychology teaches that the\npresent moment has a definite duration, it is not a\nmathematical line dividing the past from the future. The\nreasons for this need not be gone into here. All events\nwhich come into the same specious present are received\ntogether in consciousness.^\n^ Dr. C. D. Broad writes in a paper read before the Aristotelian\nSociety at Bristol in July 1928: \"The essential point in the doctrine\nof the specious present may, I think, be stated as follows. There is\na certain characteristic which an object may have at certain times.\nThis may be called the characteristic of '\nbeing sensuously pre.sented.'\nThis characteristic has various determinate forms which may be called\n'\ndegrees of vividness.'\n\"The facts about the finite duration of the specious present may now\nbe stated in the two following correlative propositions.\n\" (a) A momentary event, occurring at a time t, can bo sensuously\npresented throughout the whole course of an experience which begins\nat t and lasts for a time T. It is presented with steadily decreasing\nvividness in each successive later slice of this experience.\n\" (6) In a momentary experience, occurring at a time t, the whole\ncourse of an event wliich ends at t and began at t - T can be sensu-\nously presented. Each successive earlier slice of this event is presented\nwith less vividness in the momentary experience.\"\nReaders are also referred to Wm. James, Principles of Psychology,\npage 609, and C. S. Myers, Experimental Psychology, pages 308-9.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 171\nNow, if we suppose that the specious present of the\nmedium's subconsciousness be extended sufficiently in\nlength, the two events in the history of the relic, viz.\nthe selection and sending off by the contributor and its\nbeing handled by the medium, would be received together\nas in one moment. It would also cover the event of\nbeing received by the Officer of the Society. As a rule\nMiss Newton did this, and we may see a possible explana-\ntion of the numerous references to her in the A.S. sittings.\nWe have spoken of the normal conscious contact with\nthe rehc as a point contact ; in actual fact it is really a\nline contact, but the hne is very short, being the length\nof the specious present ; the suggestion is that the sub-\nconscious contact is also a line contact, but of greater\nlength. This theory possesses the advantage of enabling\nus to do without the untenable hypothesis of object-\nreading ; it also offers an explanation of the facts of this\ncase without the necessity of postulating communication\nwith the surviving consciousnesses of deceased human\nbeings. In other cases, if such there be, where the\ninformation given by the medium was not in the posses-\nsion of the contributor of the relic, it would not, of\ncourse, be sufficient by itself to cover the phenomena,\nbut it would still afford an explanation of the directive\nfunction of the relic.\nWhether the possibility of dispensing with the survival\nhypothesis be a recommendation for this theory or not\nmust be left to the judgment of the individual reader :\nit can only be said here that the phenomena of this\nparticular case do not, by themselves, warrant us in going\nbeyond it. While it is true that the survival and com-\nmunication hypothesis does undoubtedly cover the facts,\nwe cannot claim that it is established thereby if an\nalternative explanation can be found.\nSome measure of support for this theory may be\nderived from other sources. For example, in normal\nstates, such as fatigue, great excitement, intoxication, etc.,\nthe length of the specious present appears to fluctuate\nsomewhat. It is possible that experiments by means of\nhypnosis might throw some light on this matter.\n\f172 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nAs is well known Kant taught that time and space\nwere no more than a priori forms governing the pheno-\nmenal consciousness, and that the transcendental ego was\nnot subject to their conditions. It may be that the\nreceptor stratum belongs to the transcendental.\nMore recently the mathematical researches of Einstein\nand his co-workers have demonstrated that time is not\nan unidimensional stream common to all, but rather\nsubjective for each individual. The time of observer A.\nis not the same as that of observer B. if they are in\nmotion relatively to one another.\nThis is not the place in which to discuss the implica-\ntion of these discoveries : they are merely mentioned here\nto show that the notion of a modification of the time\ncondition, as usually conceived, is not entirely fantastic\nand without collateral support.\nThose who hold the spiritistic hypothesis can, as men-\ntioned above, claim to cover the facts, and their explana-\ntion of the directive function of the rehc would be\nperfectly simple and plausible. The \" spirits \" may be\nsupposed to be cognisant of events happening in this hfe,\nand would recognise the relic as having belonged to them\nwhen they were here. They would thus be led to com-\nmunicate through the medium. In other words, we must\nsuppose that they know all about this experiment, and\nhave attempted to co-operate in it. Until we know\nmore about the conditions of the \" other side \" we\ncannot say delinitely whether this explanation is possible\nor not.\nGroup III. Sitrvivalist.\nThe next set of theories for discussion are those termed\n\" survivalist.\" They are of two sorts : first those de-\nscribed by Dr. Walter Leaf and Dr. Broad, which postulate\nthe persistence of certain memory elements and not the\nsurvival of the entire personality ; the second are those\nwhich hold that the personality itself survives, and is\nthe source from which the information is derived. These\nlatter exist in all degrees of crudity and refinement.\nThe gist of Dr. Leaf's theory may be gathered from\n\f112] Sittmgs with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 173\nthe following quotations taken from Proc. S.P.B., Vol. XVIII.,\npage 53 ;\nThe evidence seems to me to show that after death of the\nbody there remains a more or less coherent complex of\nmemories which is accessible to the subliminal self of certain\nliving persons. What I do not as yet see is that this complex\nhas such coherence as can enable us to consider it a person-\nality. . . . The evidence seems to point rather to an alterna-\ntive which is at least consistent with analogy . . . that, as\nthe physical body only gradually dissolves into its elements\nafter death, so the spiritual retains for a time a certain\ncoherence which is no proof of life. ... It may be possible\nfor peculiarly gifted living spirits to behold the gradually\ndisintegrating spirit, and bring us word, with more or less\ncompleteness, of what the spiritual man was during life.\nAgain on page 59 of the same volume ;\nThe evidence proves, I think, that the memories of the\ndead survive and are under special conditions accessible to\nus. But I do not see that it proves the survival of what\nwe call the living sj^irit, the personality\u2014unit of consciousness,\nlimited and self-contained, a centre of will and vital force,\ncarrying on into another world the aspirations and affections\nof this.\nDr. Broad in his recent work, The Mind and its Place\nin Nattire, enunciates a very similar theory in a somewhat\nmore detailed form. He lays it down that before it can\nbe held that the personality as a unity survives death\nsome evidence must be forthcoming of the persistence of\nother forms of mental activity besides memory, for\nexample, conation.\nWhere the evidence consists of the communication\nthrough a medium of information known only to the\ndeceased Dr. Broad holds that to claim this as a proof\nof survival of the personality is to go beyond the evidence.\nAll that is proved is the persistence of some sort of\nmemory.\nThese theories are open to criticism on purely physco-\nloglcal grounds, for it might be argued that pure memory,\n\f174 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nthat is to say memory without any tincture of conation,\nis non-existent, it is a psychologist's abstraction, and ceased\nto be beheved in when the faculty psychology perished.\nIf this be so in life why should it be different in death ?\nThis, however, is not the place in which to elaborate\nany such arguments ; we must remain content to see\nhow far the facts of this case fit in with these theories.\nIf, as has been suggested, the source of the information\nis the subconscious mind of the sitter or contributor of\nthe rehc, then these theories are plainly inapplicable.\nHowever, while it is perhaps going beyond the evidence\nat present before us to postulate another source, yet\nthere is plenty of other evidence available which seems\nto give some support to such a postulate. We may,\ntherefore, without prejudice, consider how our facts would\nfit in with theories of which, in themselves, they are\ninsufficient to bear the weight.\nOne of the most obvious and striking features of these\ncommunications is the large percentage of statements\nreferring to events subsequent to the death of the osten-\nsible communicator. Many of these are of a non-physical\nnature, that is to say, such that an observer arriving\nsuddenly on the spot would not have been able to\nobtain the knowledge implied by the statement.\nIf the discussion on the theory of clairvoyance be\nreferred to it will be observed that it is just this class\nof fact which is not accessible to clairvoyance, so that,\nalthough we might possibly account for the physical\nPost-mortem statements by attributing them to clair-\nvoyant observation on the part of the medium, we cannot\nso explain the non-physical. In 66 sittings selected for\nthis particular analysis it was found that the number of\nPost-mortem statements was about equal to the Ante-\nmortem, and the percentage of veridicality is almost the\nsame in each class. Of these Post-mortem statements\nthe numbers of the physical considerably exceeds the\nnon physical, but the veridicality of the latter is higher.\nIt is unnecessary to say that the selection of the\nsittings was not made with a view to supporting any\nparticular hypothesis : they were chosen simply because\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 175\nthey were the only ones which seemed to warrant the\nexpenditure of labour required for extracting the facts.\nNow there is absolutely nothing in the records to\nsuggest that the source of the P.M. statements is any\ndifferent from that of the A.M. ;\nthey are all mixed up\ntogether, in fact in some cases so inextricably that it has\nbeen difficult to dissect them.\nIt seems to follow, therefore, that although persisting\nmemory elements might be the source of the A.M.\nstatements they cannot account for the P.M. Clair-\nvoyance might account for the physical P.M. statements\nbut not for the non-physical. The theory thus fails\nto cover all the facts, and seeing there is no ground for\nattributing different sources for the different classes of\nstatement, for the sake of simpKcity of hypothesis, at any\nrate, it would seem that if any other explanation, which\nis otherwise not more open to objection, can be put\nforward to cover all the facts it should be preferred.\nApart from these considerations, if we take the facts at\ntheir face value, that is to say, as emanating from some\nsurviving remnant of the deceased personaUty, there is\nconsiderable evidence of both conation and emotion. In the\nX. case in particular this is very evident, as will be seen\nif the extracts from that case given in an earlier section\nare referred to. One can there observe the emotion of\nremorse, watch its gradual alleviation as the deceased\nbecomes more assured that liis family has forgiven him\nfor his unkindness. The desire for forgiveness and the\npleas which he puts forward are all evidence of conation.\nIn the case of A. also the same phenomena are exhibited,\nas, for example, when he congratulates his brother on his\nengagement.\nIf this be accepted at its face value it supphes\nthe evidence which Dr. Broad requires for proof of the\nsurvival of a personahty ; if it be not so accepted the\nonly alternative seems to be to hold that the mind of\nthe sitter or contributor is the source of the information,\nand that the emotions and conations depicted are simply\nunconscious fantasy constructs of that mind, reflections of\na romance woven by the subhminal.\n\f176 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nIn that case no persisting memory elements are required,\nso that the theory either fails as a complete explanation\nor is unnecessary.\nThe other type of survivalist theory, that is to say\nthose which postulate the continuance of the personality\nafter its dissociation from the body by death, is that\nmost usually held by the mediums themselves and is\nassumed in almost all mediumistio communications. The\nspirits claim to be the source of the information, and\nmany details of the methods of communication are forth-\ncoming. (See Mr. Drayton Thomas's article in Proc,\nXXXVIII. While it is held by many in its crudest\nand most naive form, that is to say, that the personality\nwhich survives is the ordinary normal manifest person-\nality which was known during earth hfe, in some cases\nat least, as is shown by Mr. Drayton Thomas's extracts,\nthis is refined upon to the extent that the spirits claim\nthat after death the sub- and supra-liminal consciousnesses\nare unified.\nNow it must be frankly and fully admitted that some\nsuch theory as this completely covers the facts observed\nin this series of sittings.\nNot only can it account for all the phenomena, but\nthere is nothing which is definitely inconsistent with it.\nThere is much that is perhaps puzzling at first sight,\nsuch as, for example, the mistakes made, the gaps and\nomissions in the information given and, if one may say\nso without giving offence to those who hold that the\ncommunications actually do come from the surviving\nspirits of those dear to them, the surprising lack of\nintelligence in the selection of the matter chosen for com-\nmunication. It would seem, from our point of view, an\neasy matter to furnish evidence of identity far more con-\nvincing than the triviahties which are so plentiful in the\nsittings, and if a normally intelhgent person found him-\nself in the position of wishing to establish his identity\nunder approximately parallel circumstances, say by dictat-\ning messages to someone who was speaking through a\ntelephone to those who were expecting to hear from him,\nhe would not waste time in talking about the number of\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. ill\npairs of shoes they had recently bought or such trivial\ndetails of recent happenings.\nBut the spirits offer a plausible explanation for this\nwhen they say that they become confused, and suffer\nloss of memory when they enter the condition necessary\nfor communication. It may be so\u2014we have no iinow-\nledge of the conditions of discarnate existence, and so are\nnot in a position to contradict.\nMoreover, apart from this, if the hypothesis of psychical\nosmosis be accepted we have a full explanation of all\nthese and similar aberrations. We may suppose that\nrapport is established between the mind of the medium\nand the surviving mind, and that the passage of impres-\nsions from the latter to the former takes place in the\nfortuitous manner which was described when that hypo-\nthesis was formulated (see page 129).\nThat the survivalist hypothesis should adequately cover\nthe facts is not surprising, because, firstly, it is nearly\nthe widest hypothesis which we can make, and, secondly,\nit is assumed by the mediums themselves. Granted all\nthe saving clauses and means of explaining away errors,\nit would not be difficult for a medium to avoid making\nserious blunders.\nBut a hypothesis so wide as that of survival requires\na wide basis on which to rest, and it must be admitted\nthat the evidence afforded by this case is not, by itself,\nsufficient to support it. If from other sources similar\nor better evidence is forthcoming then this case will be\ncorroborative. This, in the judgment of the writer of\nthis report, is all that can be claimed in favovir of\nthe survivalist theory.\nThere are, however, one or two facts which, perhaps,\nbear a little more weight on the side of the survivalist\ntheory than on any alternative, thougli they are not by\nany means conclusive.\nWhat may be called the dramatic personification\nexhibited in some sittings is one such fact. It is a fairly\ncommon experience for the sitter to get a feeling of\nintimacy at a sitting. They feel it hard at the time not\nto beheve that the ostensible communicator is actually\nM\n\f178 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\npresent. With some this feeUng fades after the sitting,\nwith others, who are convinced of survival, it may persist.\nWe know nothing of Mrs. EUiott's or Topsy's dramatic\nability, but it would seem that even the most talented\nactress would be hard put to it to give, on the spur of\nthe moment and on the very meagre information available\nconcerning the character to be portrayed, so convincing a\nrepresentation as is sometimes shown. It is possible, of\ncourse, that the feeling of actual presence and intimacy\nis due to suggestion, and the fact of its subsequent\nfading in some cases rather points that way ;\nstill, so\nfar as it can be judged by one not actually experiencing\nit, there is in the sittings some real ground for it.\nTaken as a whole the dramatic personification is con-\nsistent for each individual ostensible communicator.\nAnother fact which may be interpreted as leaning\ntowards the survivalist theory is that of intrusion. In\nall these cases, as has been remarked, the intrusion is by\none who has shown himself elsewhere to be a good com-\nmunicator. A., the communicator with whom this pheno-\nmenon most often occurs is extremely persistent in\ncommunicating.\nThis may be explained by the fact that the medium,\nhaving had experience of a number of successful cases of\nrapport with the source-mind from which she has drawn\ninformation concerning this particular ostensible communi-\ncator, tends spontaneously to turn in that direction and\nto establish rapport without the connecting Hnk afforded\nby the rehc. On the other hand, we may take the facts\nat their face value and hold that the surviving spirit,\nbeing anxious to communicate, and having done so\nsuccessfully on previous occasions where a connecting link\nwas present, seizes any opportunity that presents itself to\nintrude.\nBefore passing on there is one point which must be\nbriefly touched upon. If, as Osty says, the transcendental\nself is free from the restraints of time and space, and\nphysical death is simply the severance of the tie between\nthe body and the self, then the question of survival can-\nnot arise. It is a question which is not unanswerable,\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 179\nbut unaskable because meaningless. For a timeless\nentity, such as the transcendental self has been held to\nbe, not only by Osty but also by Kant and his many\nfollowers, there can be no before and after. The word\nsurvival imphes the conception of before and after\ndeath.\nIt may be remarked that the more modest hypothesis\nsuggested herein, viz. an extension of the length of the\nspecious present only requires to be apphed \" with a\nheavy brush \" in order to bring about very much the\nsame result. For if the specious present be lengthened\nsufficiently we get a sort of timelessness sufficient for all\npractical purposes though not absolute. It is the same\ndifference as lies between the conceptions of a future life\nand immortality.\nNow, seeing that time and space are inextricably inter-\nwoven into all our mental machinery, our language,\nconcepts, etc., we cannot reason about or even speak\nintelhgibly concerning a timeless entity, but that, in itself,\nis no reason why such a hypothesis should be rejected.\nIt simply means that we have reached the boundary of\nthe intellectually knowable and pushed the matter into\nthe province of the intellectually unknowable. If we are\nto deal with it we must employ some mental faculty\nother than the intellect.\nSuch faculties there are, but from their very nature as\nnon-intellectual they are not amenable to the rules of\nlogic, and in consequence the whole subject is lifted out\nof the sphere of science.\nPsychical research, therefore, if it aspires to be scientific,\nmust content itself with abstractions from reality in\nexactly the same manner as do all other sciences, that is\nto say, it must be satisfied with relativities and leave the\nabsolute severely alone.\nDoubtless it can accomplish useful work within these\nlimits, and its efforts are the more Hkely to be successful\nif it recognises its limitations. It may be that the\nmanifold perplexities which beset the Psychical Researcher\nall arise from the attempt to apply spatial and temporal\nconcepts to that which is non-spatial and non-temporal.\n\f180 H. F. SaUmarsh. [part\nto measure the immeasurable, and to force the absolute\ninto the framework of the relative.\n'\nGroup IV. Mystical.\nThere now remains only the type of theory called\nMystical, of which two only will be mentioned. As\nalready indicated very little can usefully be said in\ncriticism concerning this type of theory.\nThe first of those selected for mention is the Cosmic\nConsciousness theory.\nThis postulates some sort of universal consciousness,\nwhich embraces all particular consciousnesses and includes\ntheir contents in its own.\nThe relation of the particular to the universal con-\nsciousness may be thought of as being analogous to a\nwave on the surface of the sea. The wave possesses its\nown individuahty, but at the same time is only a part\nof the sea. All that is in it is also in the sea.\nThe suggestion is that the source of the information\ngiven by the medium is this universal consciousness, in\nfact the mind of the medium and all other minds are in\nreality one mind, separated only by the temporary dif-\nferentiation which we call personality. All knowledge,\ntherefore, which is in any mind is also in this universal\nmind, and is accessible to anyone who can transcend the\ntemporary differentiation.\nThis theory is based on a conception which is sub-\nstantially the same as that of the Vedantic philosophy.\nIn the Upanishads we are told that when the self receives\nenlightenment it perceives that all that differentiates it\nfrom the Absolute (Brahman, neuter) is Maya, illusion.\nAs soon as this is grasped Maya vanishes and the self\nbecomes Brahman.\nThe idea may be found in many other philosophies and\nreligions, both Oriental and Western.\nNow from the nature of the hypothesis it seems impos-\nsible that any evidence bearing on it can be found. If\nthe survival hypothesis be wide it is also pretty definite.\nThis of cosmic consciousness is certainly as wide, but it\nis so indefinite as to be nebulous.\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott. 181\nUntil one can form some conception of what a cosmic\nconsciousness is like, and can give a clear description of\nwhat is meant by those words, it seems useless to discuss\nthe matter.\nThat any such clear statement should be forthcoming\nseems unlikely : we should have to imagine a thought\nwithout a thinker, and transcend the fundamental category\nof subject and object, self and not self.\nOwing to its width it can cover all the phenomena,\nowing to its nebulousity it cannot be broken. Criticism\npasses through it like an arrow through a cloud.\nIt has been put forward as an explanation by several\nthinkers, including Dr. Osty, who suggests it as an alter-\nnative, but does it get us anywhere ? Might we not\njust as well say that the source of the information is\na mystery as to postulate an entity which cannot be\nconceived ?\nThe last theory to be discussed is the Theosophical\ntheory of \" Akashic records.\" By this theory there is\nsupposed to be somewhere a permanent record of all the\nevents which have ever happened. If the mind of the\nmedium can obtain access to these records the required\nknowledge can be derived therefrom. It is not clear\nwhether theosophists would admit that the ordinary medium\ncould obtain this access, or whether such is available only\nto adepts and Mahatmas.\nThe theory is almost too fantastic to merit serious con-\nsideration, and the only thing to be said of it is that if\nthese records do exist in a material form there is abso-\nlutely no evidence of it, while if they be of a psychical\nnature there is little to distinguish the theory from that\nof Cosmic Consciousness.\nThis concludes what must be admitted to be a most\nunsatisfactory and incomplete discussion of mystical\ntheories.\nHowever, until those who hold these theories can formu-\nlate them in definite language so that they can be under-\nstood by the ordinary non-mystic, when, of course, they\nwould cease to be mystical, no satisfactory or complete\ndiscussion is possible.\n\f182 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part\nThe final conclusion, then, of this report may be stated\nas follows :\nTelepathy from the sitter in S.P. sittings is probably\nresponsible for a large part of the supernormal knowledge\nshown; in A.S. sittings telepathy from the contributor\nmay be held to be a possible explanation provided the\nnecessary rapport can be accounted for. The type of\ntelepathy employed is probably that called here psychical\nosmosis or something similar.\nClairvoyance as herein delimited is probably exercised\nby the medium to some extent.\nExplanation by \" object-reading \" is rejected.\nDr. Walter Leaf's and Dr. Broad's theories fail to\ncover all the phenomena.\nDr. Osty, though he leaves many points open, accounts\nfor the phenomena of supernormal knowledge of living\npersons on hnes substantially the same as those here\nsuggested under the heading of telepathy ; as regards\nknowledge of dead persons he suggests two alternatives,\none survivahst, the other mystical, viz. cosmic conscious-\nness. He suggests no theory to account for the power\nof the relic to establish rapport.\nA theory based on an extension of the specious present\nof the medium's subconsciousness has been suggested.\nThis, if taken in conjunction with telepathy of the\npsychical osmosis type, it is submitted, will cover all the\nphenomena of the sittings under discussion.\nIt must be noted, however, that the quality of the\nphenomena here dealt with is not very high. There may\nbe other cases where information given was not in the\npossession of any hving person. In such cases the theory\nabove stated would fail.\nThe survivalist theory covers all the facts if taken in\nconjunction with the osmosis theory, that is to say, if\nthe transfer of information from the surviving conscious-\nness is of the type described as psychical osmosis. It is\nnot, however, necessitated by the evidence here available.\nThe mystical theories are too nebulous for anyone not\na mystic to understand or discuss.\nThe final choice, then, lies between telepathy from the\n\f112] Sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliot. 183\nsitter or contributor, together with a small amount of\nclairvoyance, and communication from the surviving\nconsciousnesses of deceased human beings.\nThe evidence is not sufficiently definite to allow that\nchoice to be made with any degree of confidence.\nAPPENDIX.\nA suggestion for a technique to be employed in future\ncases is appended. The methods of collection and use of the\nrelics should be the same as in this experiment.\nThe notetakers should note the following :\n(1) Whether the relic was opened or not by the medium.\n(2) Where not opened, whether the relic was handled by\nthe medium as though she endeavoured to obtain knowledge\nof its nature by her sense of feeling.\n(3) Whether the wrapping was such that this knowledge\ncould have been thus obtained.\n(4) The state of the medium as regards (a) physical health,\n(6) mood, in so far as these can be ascertained.\n(5) Any differences in the apparent mood of the control.\nAfter the sittmg the records should immediately be sent to\nthe contributor for annotation. Only those persons who are\nable and willing to undertake to annotate records of sittings\nimmediately on receipt should be invited to contribute relics.\nA small committee of investigators should be formed.\nAnnotated copies of records should be sent immediately after\nreception from the annotators to each member of the com-\nmittee.\nThe committee should meet at short intervals, say once a\nweek or once a fortnight as foimd necessary, to consider the\nsittings recently given.\nEach item should be discussed separately and its value\nassigned as follows :\n(1) Probability of its being true by chance.\nThis must be stated in the form of a fraction.\nIf agreement cannot be reached after discussion, the mean\nof the various assessments to be taken. The probability,\nwhere not capable of exact estimation, may be stated in the\nform of a lower limit. Suppose, for example, it be a ques-\n\f184 H. F. Saltmarsh. [part 112]\ntion of a man having only one leg, one could start thus :\n\" Not one man in every hundred has lost one leg.\" Agreed.\n\" Not one in every two hundred,\" and so on until a limit is\nreached where the committee begin to feel uncertain. This\nwill constitute the minimum value for the statement. An\nupper limit could be fixed. Statements which were of so\nunusual a nature as practically to exclude chance would be\nconsidered of limit probability.\n(2) The committee would decide on the merits of the\nannotations, i.e. whether a statement should be considered\nveridical or not. Further information could be sought and\nquestions addressed to the annotator, if necessary the latter\nshould be interviewed by some member or members of the\ncommittee in order to clear up obscure points.\n(3) The committee should also mark the items for the\nvarious classifications adopted, such as A.M. and P.M., physical\nand non-physical, and so on.\n(4) The committee should note and discuss any instances of\nsymbolism, intrusion, etc.\nThe records thus scored can then be dealt with by a single\nperson, who will calculate the value of each sitting ^ making\nthe necessary indexes and note correspondences. He would\nrefer back to the committee any points of interest arising\nfrom his work.\nThe final stage will be when the combined results of the\nwhole series of sittings are laid before the committee, who\nwill then discuss them and di-aw up a report.\nThis technique would entail the expenditru-e of much time\nand labour, but it would eliminate to a large extent the\npersonal factor, and would also provide a keener scrutiny and\nmore searching criticism of the annotations than could be\nafforded by any single investigator.\nThe results, therefore, and the conclusions arrived at will\npossess a higher value than can be assigned to those of\nindividual effort.\n1 Discussion on the correct formula to be employed is still proceeding. It\nis hoped that an agreed result may be published shortly\n\fI. A EEPLY TO M. SUCRE'S ARTICLE, \" AN EXPERIMENT\nIN CARD GUESSING.\"\nBy Ina Jephson.\nIn the February number of Psychic Research M. Sudre has\nwritten an article, \" An Experiment in Card Guessing,\" the\nexperiment being that reported on by myself in Proc. S.P.R.\nPart 109, December, 1928, Vol. XXXVIII. As M. Sudre in his\narticle raises some important points in regard to different\nmethods of research into supernormal phenomena, I am glad\nof an opportunity to reply to his criticism, and to try and\nmake clear why his arguments, interesting as they are, have\nonly served to strengthen me in my adherence to the form\nof research chosen.\nTo be strengthened in one's opinions and preferences, is,\nI suppose, the normal effect of controversy, and M. Sudre\nand myself seem to be following the normal course very\nfaithfully. In February 1928, M. Sudre, spurred to action by\nmy appeal to collect data for my experiment, wrote in Psychic\nResearch begging investigators, including myseK, not to do\ncollective experiments based on a mathematical comparison\nwith chance. In my report on the experiment I replied\nshortly, giving my reasons for continuing in my obstinate\npath, and trying to persuade M. Sudre of the error of his\nviews. In February 1929 M. Sudre, horrified by the method\nand conclusions of my card-guessing experiment, writes again\n(digging himself more firmly into his trench), and amplifying\nand elaborating his criticisms. And now (crawling further into\nmy dug-out) I reply once more, using precisely the same\narguments that I used before, and feeling more warmly than\never the illogicality of M. Sudre's position, and the strength\nand good sense of mine.\nMy reply falls into two parts. First I would like to meet\nthose criticisms and theories which do not seem to me to be\n185\n\f186 Ina Jephson. [part\nvery good ones, and by these, of course, I mean those with\nwhich I disagree ; then I will discuss the criticism which\nstrikes me as helpful and worth discussion, and by that, of\ncourse, I mean one with which I am in agreement.\nOne of M. Sudre's main objections to the method used in\ncollective experiments based on mathematical calculations is\nthat the very method itself stands in the way of the demon-\nstration of the faculty under observation, for the existence of\nthe faculty may be so slight that it has no chance to appear\nin a relatively small number of trials, and that therefore the\nwhole experiment must inevitably be quite inconclusive. I\nadmit this may be a genuine drawback, but to abstain from\nundertaking an experiment for fear it may fail seems a curious,\nor I should say wicurious frame of mind, and to declare an\nexperiment valueless because not enough data have been\ncollected, is less helpful than to collect more. >\nAnother criticism made by M. Sudre is that where the\nmethod of experiment combines all results, the results which\nare successful due to supernormal faculty, may become\nmasked by those unsuccessful results from normal people.\nThis must be admitted, but until we try we cannot tell who\nmay have the faculty and who may not, and again, why.\nabandon an experiment because we are not absolutely sure\nit will succeed ? Even if the experiment is not, and cannot\nin its nature be conclusive, a suggestive experiment can be\nof great value, indicating a line of research which may\nfinally lead to definite conclusions.\nWith the next objection raised by M. Sudre I cannot agree\nin any way. He considers that only comijlete success should\nbe scored ; that is to say that no approximation to success\nshould be allowed to influence the sum of results. He will\nnot allow, for instance, that to guess or divine a nine of\nhearts for a ten of hearts, is any nearer to success than to\nsay nine of hearts for a black court card. This seems to me\nquite strangely arbitrary. It might be possible that a clair-\nvoyant divining cards should get colour right every time\nwithout exception, and yet, in M. Sudre's view, this must not\nbe counted, being disqualified as only a \" j)artial \" success.\nWe should be obliged to ignore, because of this self-imposed\nrule, what might be a most important and interesting charac-\n\f112] A Reply to M. Sudre's Article. 187\nteristic of lucidity. It is exactly as if M. Sudre, not content\nwith the difficulties already inherent in the quest, decided to\ninvent a few more barriers between the investigator and his\ngoal. One can only hope that M. Sudre's methods of research\nwill not spread to other scientific activities, or we shall find\nwhen we visit the oculist that we are considered totally blind\nif we fail to read quite all the letters on the test card ;\nand at the aurist deaf and dumb, because we can neither\nhear very clearly nor understand some of the more enterprising\nwords in the Welsh language.\nBut M. Sudre's postulate provokes an interesting train of\nthought, raising as it does the question of the mechanism of\nperception of recognition. It is arguable, I suppose, that it\nmay be an unwise analogy to compare clairvoyance with\nnormal sight, but on the other hand, if we insist on being\nso extremely cautious, with what else can we compare it ?\nAfter all, the object of the experiment is to find out whether\nsupernormal sight can furnish us with the same information\nthat we are accustomed to receiving from normal vision. It\nseems reasonable to assume, even if lucidity and normal\nsight are quite different in their nature, that the objective\nfacts perceived (by whichever means) are synthesised by the\nsame process. We recognise, for instance, that a four of\nhearts is a four of hearts, because we have learned by three\ndifferent acts of perception that the group of impressions,\nfour units, redness, and heart-shaped pips is called the four\nof hearts. If we subtract one of these perceptions, or if one\nof them fails to be translated into conscious expression, there\nis no reason why we should assume that the other two per-\nceptions were wrong or non-existent. The possibility that\nthe three acts of perception may not all, or may not simul-\ntaneously reach consciousness, cannot possibly be taken as\nproof that no one correct perception has taken place.\nDr. Fisher's method was devised on the perfectly natural\nassumption that complete success is the sjTithesis of several\npossible acts of perception, and that however arbitrary a\nsystem of scoring may be it must supply a direct measure of\nthe subject's power of scoring on that system. But I need\nnot defend Dr. Fisher's system, and he is writing a reply to\nM. Sudre in this article.\n\f188 Ina Jephson. [part\nIf M. Svidre's method of scoring only complete success would\ngive but a barren and unprofitable experiment, his desire to\nnarrow the experiment still further, and to concentrate on\nachieving one enormously above chance experiment, would\nreduce the interest of psychic research almost to zero point.\nM. Sudre's desire is to confront the scientific world with an\nexperiment so undeniably above chance that the most sceptical\nand antagonistic would pale unanimously at its unavoidable\nimplications. This I agree would be delightful, and it is one\nof the results of research to which I am looking forward.\nBut I do not think the result will be attained by M. Sudre's\nmethod.\nAs an example of an experiment which would be unani-\nmously considered as above chance, he gives a picturesque\nillustration, imagining the case of a monkey, playing on a\ntypewriter, reproducing his article in Psychic Research. But\nhowever undeniably above chance this event might be con-\nsidered, I am afraid that M. Sudre would be disappointed in\nits effect on scientific opinion. I feel certain that indifference\nwould remain till M. Sudre could exhibit his gifted monkey\nwriting articles regularly for Psychic Research, and could show\nat least some traces, among other monkey tribes, of an ability\nto contribute articles to magazines dealing with the super-\nnormal. Scientific conviction, after all, is only the name we\ngive to the effect of the prolonged persuasion due to re-\npeatedly observed facts or events.\nIn my report I used the phrase \" fatigue curve \" to des-\ncribe the diminution in success from the early guesses to the\nlater ones. M. Sudre objects that to call the curve a fatigue\ncurve assumes that the faculty is a continuous one, \" whereas\nwe may more rationally suppose that it is exercised in flashes\nimder a determinism of which we remain totally ignorant.\"\nThis is a perfectly just criticism, and I myself do not alto-\ngether like the use of the word fatigue, and agree it may be\nmisleading. Whether the faculty is continuous remains to be\nseen, but in any case I imagine the deterioration to which\nmy exj)eriments drew attention is due more to loss of spon-\ntaneity after the initial guess, than to fatigue, unless we use\nthat word in its very widest sense, meaning only the deteriora-\ntion of some quality or condition unknown.\n\f112] A Reply to M. Sudre's Article. 189\nI agree with M. Sudre in thinking that interference from\nobjective or subjective causes, rather than weariness, is more\nlikely to be responsible for the diminution of success. After\nthe initial guess or divination the normal mind is almost sure\nto interfere, giving suggestions that a card of a different\ncolour should be tried, or that it is most unlikely that a card\nwill be the same twice running ; a preference for red may\nbias the guessing, and a number will be suppressed for con-\nscious or unconscious reasons. The phrase \" censorship-curve\n\"\nhas been suggested, but perhaps it is assuming more than\nthe experiment warrants to do more than to note the de-\nterioration, and call the curve X.\nI have discovered one more point on which it is possible\nto agree with M. Sudre, which is, that in making experiments\nin clairvoyance it is best to try with people who have the\ngift. I agree. But even in discovering this amount of agree-\nment I must make a small protest. T have not neglected the\ngolden opportunity of studying the clairvoyant gifts of Mr.\nSaltmarsh. Mr. Saltmarsh very kindly was one of the first\nto make some trials, but has not, so far, divined five series\nof five cards in the way attributed to him by M. Sudre, and\nI can find no record of such a remarkable success in my report.\nI can only deduce, rather sadly, that my paper itself pro-\nduced a fatigue curve in M. Sudre, but I hope that, given\ntime, he will be sufficiently recovered to attack afresh any\nfurther experiments shoukl more of the same nature be devised.\nII. THE STATISTICAL METHOD IN PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nBy R. a. Fishee, Se.D., F.R.S.\nI HAVE been invited to make a few comments on M. Sudre's\ninteresting criticism of Miss Jephson's card-guessing experi-\nment, but after reading Miss Jephson's own reply, it is clear\nthat she is so well able to justify the experimental technique\nshe has adopted that there is very little for me to add on\nher behalf. The little that I should like to say is rather on\nbehalf of, and in explanation of, the statistical method in\ngeneral, in relation, not specially with psychical research, but\nwith all phenomena the experimental demonstration of which\nis not so simple that the facts are universally accepted.\n\f190 R. A. Fisher, Sc.D., F.R.S. 1\nM. Sudre goes to the heart of the matter with the para- ^\ndoxical statement that the report of a single case in which I\nfive cards in succession were cori'ectly guessed on five separate\noccasions \" would have been vastly more convincing to the ^\nincredulous \" than (presumably) the demonstration that a large '\nnumber of persons working independently should, while mak- '\ning many mistakes, consistently make better guesses than '\ncould be ascribed to chance. How paradoxical this statement\nis must be apparent to anyone who has watched the reactions\nof an audience to a good conjurer. All, with their own eyes,\nhave seen him produce a living rabbit from a hat which\nthey have also seen to have been empty ; most of them are\nconfessedly unaware of the \" normal \" means by which the\ntrick is performed. Yet they do not feel that their knowledge 1\nof the nature of things has been enlarged, or that new poten-\n'\ntialities in their environment have been revealed to them.\nThe unexplained phenomenon is discounted because it is only\nperformed by a special person, the conjurer, presumably after\nspecial but unknown preparations. If Mr. Saltmarsh had,\nreally performed the feat, which M. Sudre ascribes to him,\nbefore our eyes, his performance would still have carried little\nconviction to the incredulous, who would, however, be ration-\nally impressed if they were to discover a much slighter power\nof clairvoyance in repeated trials with ordinary people like\nthemselves.\nIt is important that the incredulous should react in this\nway, but it is more important that they are right so to\nreact. If any one of the conjurer's audience, after witnessing\nphenomena beyond his immediate comprehension, were to face\nthe problem whether they were produced by \" normal \" or by\n\" supernormal \" means, he would see at once that he had not\nobtained the data necessary for a decision. What is needed is\nfor him to frequent the company of amateur conjurers, and\nof learners in all stages of acquiring the art. The exhibition\nphenomena will then no longer be isolated and inexplicable ;\nthey will be brought into relation with special apparatus and\nspecial adroitness, which he can understand and accept, with-\nout necessarily being able to imitate it. In the opposite\npossibility that they were actually produced by the possession\nof powers hitherto unknown to science or common experience.\n\f112] The Statistical Method in Psychical Research. 191\nhe would receive, what the isolated performance could never\ngive him, adequate and convincing evidence of their reality.\nIn the investigation of living beings by biological methods\nstatistical tests of significance are essential. Their function is\nto prevent us being deceived by accidental occurrences, due\nnot to the causes we wish to study, or are trying to detect,\nbut to a combination of the many other circumstances which\nwe cannot control. An observation is judged significant, if it\nwould rarely have been produced, in the absence of a real\ncause of the kind we are seeking. It is a common practice\nto judge a result significant, if it is of such a magnitude that\nit would have been produced by chance not more frequently\nthan once in twenty trials. This is an arbitrary, but con-\nvenient, level of significance for the practical investigator, but\nit does not mean that he allows himself to be deceived once\nin every twenty experiments. The test of significance only\ntells him what to ignore, namely all exi^eriments in which\nsignificant results are not obtained. He should only claim\nthat a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when he\nknows how to design an experiment so that it will rarely fail\nto give a significant result. Consequently, isolated significant\nresults which he does not know how to reproduce are left in\nsuspense pending further investigation.\nIf I have rightly expressed the principles u^Don which\nscientific truth is established, it will be obvious why Miss\nJephson did not confine her attention to one subject, but\nrightly extended her enquiry to many. She was trying out\nan experimental method which might (and may) prove capable\nof raising clairvoyance to the level of a demonstrable scientific\nfact. I believe that few will doubt the importance of such a\nfact, if true, or the need, in a sceptical world, of giving it a\ncritically sound demonstration.\nThe value of such an experimental method depends on its\nchance of success if the phenomena is there to be revealed.\nIt depends, in fact, on being sensitive to whatever powers of\nclairvoyance, however slight, might happen to be possessed by\nher subjects. It is this that M. Sudre has overlooked in\nsuggesting that only complete success, an exact reproduction\nof the Suit and Value of the card drawn, should be taken\ninto account. A subject who could always perceive the colour\n\f192 R. A. Fisher, Sc.D., F.R.8. [part 112]\nof the card correctly, but could see no further, would possess\nvery remarkable clairvoyant powers. Such a subject would\nscore complete success only once in 26 trials, whereas one\nwith no clairvoyant powers whatever would score complete\nsuccess once in 52 trials, or just half as often. With M.\nSudre's system of scoring, even so remarkable a clairvoyant\ncould only count on scoring a significant result after several\nhundred trials ; and since data could not be collected on this\nscale, all such cases would be missed. On Miss Jephson's\nsystem the same subject would score an average of 4-01 above\nchance expectation, and after 25 trials, with a standard error\nof 2, this is significant ; the score, in fact, would serve to\ncall attention to the astonishing special powers possessed by\nthe subject.\nThis example, though conclusive in showing that Miss\nJephson's procedure, in taking account of all the chief points\nto be perceived by a clairvoyant, is much more sensitive than\nthe crude method of ignoring all but complete success, sug-\ngested by M. Sudre, does not really do full justice to her\nsystem of combining all powers of perception in one composite\ntest ; for the subject might well perceive, sometimes colour,\nand sometimes form the more clearly, and all tendencies to\nbe right rather than wrong are allowed to reinforce one\nanother in proportion to their power of excelling the results\nof random guessing. In this matter, as M. Sudre severely\nsays, I have done nothing more than translate into that\nlanguage of figures the instructions which I have been given ;\nI take, however, full responsibility for judging this to have\nbeen worth while, as a contribution to experimental science.\nIn testing significance, a lower standard should not be\ntaken than twice the standard deviation, and in M. Sudre's\nsentence :\n\" Hence the score of a series of 25 tests may be\nattributed to chance if it falls between 9-18 and 13-18,\" one\nshould read 7-18 and 15-18 as the more reasonable limits.\nM. Sudre's attempt to demonstrate by example the \" univeri-\nsimilitude \" of the scoring system therefore fails ; as indeed\nany attempt to show that significant results could frequently\nbe obtained without the action of a real cause, is necessarily\nforedoomed to failure, t\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\niety for Psychical Research\nPART 113\nLIBRARY CATALOGUE\n(SUPPLEMENT 1928-1929)\nCOMPILED BY\nTHEODORE BESTERMAN\nLIBRARIAN AND EDITOR\n\f\fPREFACE\nThe present second supplementary Library Catalogue covers\nthe additions made to the Library from July 1928 to\nSeptember 1929.

HOME.i\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nIt is not by any means the aim of tlie present paper to prove either\nthat the so-called physical phenomena of spiritualism do not exist\nat all or that D. D. Home had no genuine mediumistic power. Such\nan aim would be far too ambitious ; besides, such is not precisely\nmy view. My object is different. It has often been alleged that\nthere is no evidence that Home\u2014that bulwark, that alpha and\nomega of physical spiritualism with whom modern spiritualism must\nstand or fall, to use Sir. Podmore's words\u2014-was ever detected in\nfraud. I will attempt to show that this supposed immunity from\ndetection is a fiction and that evidence to the contrary undoubtedly\nexists ; I will also insist on some elements of weakness\u2014very serious\nelements\u2014inherent in my opinion in the Home evidence. My con-\nclusion had better be stated at the outset : the great bulk of D. D.\nHome's phenomena must be thrown overboard . A certain residuum,\nnot easily explicable, will remain. But though I have no ready\nexplanation to offer with regard to it, it seems to me, I confess,\nsomewhat vitiated by its association with so many other \" mani-\nfestations \" which can be accounted for with so little difficulty, and\nwhose explanation lies, as a matter of fact, on the surface.\nI will begin by referring the reader to my paper in the \/ournal for\nJuly 1912 (XV. 274-288) entitled :\n\" On the alleged Exposure of D.\nD. Home in France,\" in which I reproduced two letters by a Dr.\nBarthez, physician to Napoleon Ill's son\u2014the Prince Imperial\n\u2014\ndated respectively Biarritz, 5th September and 2.5th September, 1857,\nand printed in the Revue de Paris (1912, pp. 80-8i). Dr. Barthez's\n^ This paper was read at a Conversazione (for Members and Associates only)\non 6th November, 1929.\nA\n\f248 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nletters have since appeared in book form.^ In the second of these\ntwo letters the following passage occurs : \"It will amuse you to\nlearn that we have at last grasped one of the methods by which\nMr. Hume evokes spirits. As a result the Empress is reduced to\nsaying that the Himie of to-day is no longer the Hume that he was,\nthat he has lost his power, and that he tries to replace it by trickery.\nThe thing is very simple. Mr. Hume wears thin shoes, easy to take\noff and put on ; he also has, I believe, cut socks which leave the toes\nfree. At the appropriate moment he takes of? one of his shoes and\nwith his foot pulls a dress here, a dress there, rings a bell, knocks\none way and another, and, the thing done, quickly puts his shoe on\nagain. This has been seen by M. Morio,- who has made of it a fine\nrecord, written and signed, with all the details necessary to establish\nthe authenticity of his discovery. Hume saw that his secret had been\nguessed and I assure you that he cut a pitiful figure . . . The sittings\nfor the evocation of spirits at once ceased at the castle and we hope\nthat this undeserving character is put out of currency. Nevertheless\nHer Majesty is unable to accept the fact that anybody should have\nhad the impertinence to make a mockery to such a point, and during\na whole year, of herself and of the Emperor.\" ^\nIn Dr. Barthez's letter we had at last in a concrete and authentic\nform an extremely vivacious legend connected with D. D. Home's\nname which had hitherto obstinately refused to \" materialise,\"\nthough cropping up again and again. Hence the very great impor-\ntance of this document.\nIn my above-named paper I arrived inter alia at the following\nconclusions :\n\" (1) The famous legend as to the French exposure of Home has\nat last been '\nhunted down.' It resolves itself into a real incident\nwhich happened in the course of Home's sittings at Biarritz about\n20th September, 1857, and which, there is good reason to believe,\nconsisted of an attempt at trickery on Home's part. . .\n.\"\n\" (2) The sort of trickery used was precisely of a kind suggested\nto an attentive reader by a certain category of Home's perform-\nances. . . .\n\" On the whole, a fairly good instance, I thinly, of the partial truth\nof the saying :\n'\nII n'y a fas defumee sans feu.'\n\" *\nIt has been objected ^ a projMs of a few words I said about Home\n1 La famille Im.periale a St Cloud et a Biarritz (Paris, no date).\n^ Baron Morio de Flsle, \" Prefect of the Palace,\" whose name also appears\nin the same connection in Comte Fleiiry and L. Sonolet's La Societc du Second\nEmpire, 1851-1858, pp. 185-186. This coincidence is very significant since the\nlatter work has nothing to do with the Barthez letter.\n3 [The French text is printed in Journal, xv. 281, and in the Appendix to\nthe present paper. Hon. Ed.]\n* Journal, xv. 288. ^ Miss Dallas in Journal (January 1929), xxv. 17.\n\f114] Some Thoughts on D. D. Home. 249\nand the Biarritz exposure in the Journal for November 1928 (xxiv.\n370 n.) that according to a statement of the late Sir William Crookes's\nhe never detected any trickery or deceit whatever on Home's part,\n\" nor heard any first hand evidence of such from other persons.\" ^\nWell, the last few words would rather imply in my opinion that the\ngreat scientist probably was acquainted with second-hand evidence\nbearing on the subject ; at any rate, there is in the sentence quoted\nabsolutely nothing disproving such a supposition. And few will, I\nthink, be disposed to dispute, that cumulative second-hand evidence\nmay in the end become irresistible.\nI have also been reminded of Professor Charles Richet's words :\n\" Sometimes indeed, as in the case of Dunglas Home, it has had to be\nacknowledged that the accusation of fraud was unjustified.\" ^ I\nanswer : if M. Richet has in his possession evidence refuting Dr.\nBarthez's testimony, it is to be earnestly hoped that he will com-\nmunicate it to our Society at once. If he has not, such a sentence\nhas about it nothing decisive.\nAgain, the late Sir W. F. Barrett (and obviously F. W. H. Myers)\nfailed, I am told, to obtain adequate testimony as to the detection\nof Home. Now what does this prove ? How can such a circumstance\naffect the Barfchez evidence which obviously remained unknown to\nthese two gentleman ? It affects it just as little as the fact of A, B\nand C not having seen a certain act performed by E proves\u2014or may\nprove\u2014nothing against the evidence of D who did see it.\nIt has also been pointed out that the undoubted fact of D. D.\nHome having entertained relations with the Empress of the French\nseveral years after the exposure, gives us reason to think that the\nstory of the detection may have been a calumny. To all those who\nknow how easily\u2014especially in the domain of spiritualism\u2014persons\nanxious to believe are apt to forget such unpleasant incidents and\nindeed all evidence unpalatable to them, this circumstance proves\nlittle or nothing.\nThe following two letters bear on the opinion which the late\nEmpress Eugenie apparently entertained of the Biarritz episode at\nthe end of her life. Both are addressed to myself and are now\nprinted for the first time :\n\" Dear Sir, \" 9th March, 1929.\n\" I have only to-day had your letter of the 9th of February, which\nhas been following me. Here is the information you ask for : . . .\n\" This passage ^ was published by me in the Revue de France for\nJanuary 1924.

Morio described to me how his father had unmasked Home.\n\" (2) On the 7th of November, 1920, Prince Roland Bonaparte\ncame himself to the Societe de Geographic, of which he was Presi-\ndent, to confirm the authenticity of the Biarritz sitting, which had\nbeen several times described to him by the Empress Eugenie.\n\" The Prince is dead, but his daughter.

Home. 251\nsaid that, in her opinion, the stories of a gloved foot under the table\nwere false.\" I note the apparent discrepancy and pass on.\nHere is another testimony on the Biarritz incident. The writer\nis the late Professor Cyon of the Imperial Medical Academy in Saint\nPetersburg. The sitting (Home's) to which he refers at the begin-\nning, took place in the presence of some Russian savants (also of\nAksakov) and was a perfect blank :\n\" Immediately after the publication of my article on the sitting\nof 10th March, 1871, General Comte Fleury, one time Ambassador at\nPetersburg, communicated to me through Dr. Pelikan the details of\na sitting at Compiegne where he had succeeded in catching Home in\nthe act. At this sitting were present the Emperor, the Empress,\nPrincess Metternich, and a few other members of the Com't. Round\nthe table Home had on his left the Empress Eugenie, on whose left\nsat Napoleon HI. Count Fleury, seated facing Home, was struck by\nthe persistence with which the latter directed the conversation in\nsuch a way that the Empress was obliged to turn continually towards\nthe Emperor to put questions to him.\n\" Suspecting some conjuring trick. General Fleury asked per-\nmission to withdraw ; he left by the door at the right of the table,\nbut returned unobserved by another door behind Home. He then\nsaw the latter open the sole of his right shoe, leave his naked foot\nsome time on the marble floor, then suddenly with a rapid and\nextraordinarily agile movement, touch with his toes the hand of the\nEmpress, who started, crying, ' The hand of a dead child has touched\nme !\n'\nGeneral Fleury came forward and described what he had\nseen. The following day Home was embarked at Calais, conducted\nby two agents ; the order was to keep the incident secret.\" ^\nAgain, I do not by any means regard Professor Cyon as either\ninfallible or impartial. On the contrary. And the inaccuracies are\nnumerous and obvious. But the main facts are the same : (a) the\nsitting takes place at Napoleon Hi's Court ;\n(b) the process of the\nalleged fraud is more or less identical. That, writing in 1910 or 1909\nProfessor Cyon should have forgotten many details, written \" Com-\npiegne \" for \" Biarritz \" (both imperial residences), etc., the facts\nhaving been communicated to him at second-hand nearly forty years\nbefore, is surely only natural. To me, hov^^ever. Dr. Barthez's\nevidence suffices. I only wish to draw attention to the fact that it\nis confirmed from several other sources which are absolutely and\nentirely independent.\nWas it at first hand 1 We do not know. I incline at first to think\nnot, though his daughter, Mme. Pouquet says {Journal, xv. 282) :\n\" He had witnessed it himself.\" But let us here make what the\n1 Dr. E. Cyon, Dieu et Science (Paris 1910), p. 255. [The French text of this\nextract is printed in the Appendix. Hon. Ed.]\n\f252 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nGermans call a Seitensprung and reason somewhat as follows : X,\nlet us suppose, lias great luck at cards, and many people suspect\nhim of cheating. There is a rumour that he was once caught red-\nhanded ; this rumour varies so far as dates and places are concerned,\nbut it is a very persistent one. It does not. vary\u2014or varies little\u2014as\nto the method of cheating. Investigators try to find its origin but\nfail. Then suddenly a letter turns up, Avritten by a gentleman, Y,\nwho may or may not have been present himself at the detection,\nbut who certainly had every possibility of learning exactly what had\nhappened. The letter is written at the time of the exposure, in the\ntown where the incident took place, and the fraudulent method\ntherein mentioned is the one which had been rumoured about for so\nmany years. What are we to think ?\nThe answer is obvious. We may not regard the letter as absolute\nproof, but to deny that it justifies critics in declaring it very pro-\nbable that X was detected in cheating and in using precisely such\nand such a method, would, in my opinion, be absurd.\nThe more so, as\u2014I have often urged this point before\u2014the modus\noperandi alleged to have been used by D. D. Home in September\n1857 at Biarritz is over and over again suggested by accounts of his\nphenomena which we possess. To maintain that the action of D. D.\nHome's feet could explain every1;hing we read about him, would be\nabsiu\"d. But that it can account for a good deal is an imdoubted\nfact, a fact on which the Biarritz exposure throws an additional if\nsomewhat lurid light.\nLet the reader consider, for instance, the following passage from\none of Aksakov's works :\n\" Sometimes at Home's sittings (Home's\nhands being upon the table and a candle burning) I would hold\nunder the table some object ; a pencil, a bell or a handkerchief, and\nwould feel how something began to touch, to take and to pull it ;\nif I let it go, it would not fall down ; I once put my hand under the\ntable with a ring on one finger in order that it should be taken away,\nas I hoped thus to know the operating agency better ; all at once\ntender but firm fingers began to work, trying to take off the ring,\nin so doing they naturally and inevitably touched my hand and I\nwas fully convinced these were living, warm, thin, human fingers.\" ^\nProfessor Boutlerov, who witnessed similar incidents mentions, it is\ntrue, in his accoimt first published in the Moscow review Russhy\nVestnik, that Home's feet \" were dressed in boots, were controlled\nand did not move \" ; but we are not told whether this \" control\n\"\nwas uninterrupted, what it consisted of and whether the boots were\nnot of such a kind that they could be slipped off and put on again\nwith impunity and without difficulty. I may add that I once asked\nM. Aksakov, who, if I mistake not, was a relation of the second Mme.\n1 Pradvestniki Spiritisma [The Precursors of Spiritism], p. 485 n.\n\f114] Some Thoughts on D. D. Home. 253\nHome's\/ \" Did you control Home's feet ?\n\" To this he replied in\nthe affirmative, but at once added :\n\" And then you surely cannot\ntie a knot in a handkerchief with your toes.\" From which I concluded\nthat it was chiefly in the nature of the supposed phenomena, not in\nthe character of the control that M. Aksakov saw a guarantee of\nauthenticity. Now, that an experienced conjurer\u2014especially one\nwho has chosen to specialise in that way\u2014is able to tie a Imot thus,\nI have no doubt.\nTo turn to the chief scientific witness to Home's \" manifestations,\"\nSir W. Crookes describes {Proceedings, vi. 123) a case of \" direct\n\"\nwriting (also under the table) which he calls \" as striking a mani-\nfestation as I have ever seen.\" In this case again not a word is said\nabout the position of Home's feet : an omission which is certamly\nunfortunate and strange. Perhaps it will appear less strange to us\nwhen we reflect that Sir W. Crookes seems to have been much\nimpressed once by a sitting in which three mediums took part,\nHome being one of them and Herne and Williams the other two ;\nan episode which surely justifies us in assuming that his canons of\nevidence in the domain of the physical phenomena may not always\nhave been identical with those of the average psychical researcher\nof this year of grace 1929\u2014nay, of some years earlier.\nA propos of the letter, dated 12th April, 1871, mentioning the\nsitting in question, which will be foimd in Dr. Fournier d'Albe's Life of\nSir William Crookes (pp. 191-3),^ I may be permitted to recall very\nbriefly in passing : (a) that the greatest scientific attainments and\nachievements are no guarantee that an investigator will prove a\ncompetent observer in dealing with phenomena such as those of\nHome and other mediums ;\n(b) that in our researches the personality\nand individual capacities and qualifications of such investigators are\nof far more vital importance than the personality of the medium.\nFor against the latter's supposed attempts at cheating\u2014supposed\nor indeed very real\u2014we may, in theory at least, adopt precautions\nwhich will completely nullify such attempts. As for the investi-\ngator, if his name is one of scientific eminence, we are sometimes,\nin retrospect at least, almost at his mercy. I shall never forget\nAksakov's attitude towards the Crookes and Zollner investigations ;\nit irresistibly reminded me to some extent of a believing Christian's\n^ It should be noted by the way that nothing or hardly anything is said in\neither of her two books (D. D. Home, Ms Life and Mission and The Gift of\nD. D. Home) about the Biarritz scandal, a circumstance the more worthy of\nnotice as much space is devoted by her to recounting and ridiculing the many\noften grotesque and absurd rumours and racontars circulated about her\nhusband, the very grotesqueness or exaggerated character of which made\nrefutation the more easy. This omission seems, to me, to be of a certain\nweight in estimating the general character and value of the two books.\n^ The writer's comments on the letter are suggestive and, I think, justified.\n\f254 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nattitude towards the Gospel. No doubt our position now is more\nfavoiirable than that of the generation of fifty or sixty years ago ;\nyet there is still some room^for improvement.\nTo retm'n to D. D. Home : the Biarritz episode is not the only one\nin which he may be reasonably suspected to have used fraudulent\nmethods. In our Journal for May 1903 (xi. 76-80) a narrative is\nprinted by a Mr. Merrifield (if I mistake not, Mrs. Salter's grandfather)\nwhich is unfavourable to the genuineness of Home's \" spirit hands.\"\nAnd\u2014a very characteristic detail surely\u2014from a passage of this\nnarrative we are allowed to infer further that at a certain moment\nthe medium's hands were under the table and apparently free : a\ncircumstance which, coupled with not a few statements appearing\nin other accormts (I have in view particularly Lord Dunraven's very\ncandid and instructive Experiences in Spiritualism ^), throw an\nominous light on the conditions of control which seem to have\nprevailed often enough, very possibly as a general rule, at D. D.\nThese Experiences in particular prove to us quite conclusively, it\nseems to me, that it was virtually Home who controlled and directed\nthe sittings ; and that precautions against fraud were either practi-\ncally non-existeut or obviously inadequate. Omissions appear in\nthe accounts which prove that the observers had no idea of the\nconditions required to make an experiment even relatively con-\nvincing. Home was practically at liberty to act as he liked, moving\nfreely about the room and even leaving the room^. To absolutely\nnon-evidential (if not absurd ^) trance addresses the eye-witnesses\nobviously attached\u2014judging by the care with which they repro-\nduced these addresses almost verbatim\u2014the same importance as to\nconclusive phenomena. And in some few cases we may indeed infer\nquite legitimately that Home could have introduced a confederate\ninto the seance-xoom. without much difficulty. In saying this I have\nparticularly in view the sitting of 9th February, 1869 {Experiences,\np. 173) ; and surely it is significant that in Lord Adare's (Dun-\nraven's) account, whilst not a word is said as to how the supposed\nmaterialised form disappeared, we have plenty of details as to\nabsolutely non-evidential talks held at the sitting.\nIt may not unreasonably be asked whether the medium's elo-\nquence did not play here, so to say, the part of a smoke-screen to\ncover the materialised spirit's retreat.\nHere are a few extracts which enable us, I think, to form an\n^ My references are to the S.P.R. reprint in Proceedings (1925) xxxv.\n^ See in particular Experiences, p. 166 and p. 167, footnote, from which it\nfollows that on a certain occasion Home may have left the room twice in\nconnection with a single \" experiment \" !

In the account of the 62nd\nsitting of 12th March, 1869, we read {Experiences, pp. 221-222) :\n\" He [Home] got up, and acting under an uncontrollable impulse,\nwalked about the room, his hands and arms being strangely waved\nabout and agitated ; he made mesmeric passes over us all . . . He\nmade passes for some time over my father's forehead, the back of\nhis head, and behind his ears, occasionally going to the table at\nwhich we had previously been seated, and extending his fingers over\nit as though withdrawing some influence from it. While walking\nabout he suddenly stopped in the middle of a sentence with a violent\ngasp, and sinliing on his knees went into a trance. He got up,\nwalked about, apparently conversing with someone, and then, taking\neach of us in turn by the hand, led us to the other table, placed\nchairs for us, and signed to us to sit down. My father requested me\nto bring paper and a pencil ; but Home shook his head, and after-\nwards brought them himself. He then commenced arranging the\nfurniture in the most minute detail, consulting apparently all the\ntime with someone. He placed the small round table near us and\nbehind my father, and moved a chair up to it ; he altered the\nposition of several of the chairs in different parts of the room, placed\nthe miniature portrait of his wife on the small round table, and the\ncase containing little Daimie Cox's photograph on the largo table\nbehind me, then going to the bookcase he took out several books,\nlooked into them and replaced them ; at length he appeared to find\nwhat he wanted, for he took out a volume, folded his hands across\nit on his breast, and after standing for a few seconds in a most\nreverential attitude, sank down upon his knees and appeared to\npray earnestly ; then rising to his full height he held the book as\nhigh as he could above his head and placedlt upon our table.\"\nHere is an extract from the account of the 68th sitting, 10th April,\n1869 {Experiences, pp. 249-250) :\n\" Home got up, took a striped rug off the sofa, and covering his\nshoulders, head, and face with it, began walking about the room in\na stealthy mamier, hiding behind the furniture, and crawling about\nflat upon the ground, apparently lying in wait for some one.\nSuddenly he put his hand upon the candle, and left us in almost\ntotal darkness. I could just distinguish him gliding about the room,\nand crawling on the floor.\"\nImagine the results a conjurer could achieve when operating under\nsuch conditions ! Now it is needless to say that from the critical\nand scientific standpoint we are bound to regard D. D. Home as\nhaving very possibly been a tolerably good conjurer ; indeed we\nhave no right to regard him in a different light.\nThe following extract from Lord Adare's Experiences bears not\n\f256 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solorovo. [part\nso mucii on the conditions of control as on the degree of critical\nacumen displayed by the sitters. At the sitting of 6th March, 1869,\nalready mentioned {Experiences, p. 209) :\n\" He [Home] placed chairs for us all, drew over a little table, and\nsat down. It was pitch dark. Immediately a hand was laid on the\nback of my head. He said '\nThey will touch you with flowers.'\nBoth Mrs. Wynne and I felt them. He said to Mrs Wynne, '\nIt was\nJohn who touched you.' We heard at a little distance the sound of\nflowers being stirred and broken, and immediately some were placed\nin our hands. Mr. Home said, '\nTake Daniel's hands, dear Emily,\nwe want you to be able to tell others that you held his hands and\nfelt his feet.' While Mr. Home's hands and feet were thus in contact\nwith Mrs. Wynne's we all simultaneously felt flowers waved across\nour faces, heads, and hands.\"\nFrom which it seems to follow that the writer (Lord Adare's\nfather) was inclined to regard as supernormal phenomena occur-\nrences taking place in the dark and when the medium's hands were\nfree. Needless to say, the mere fact of the latter having been later\nin contact with Mrs. Wynne's hands aiiords us but an inadequate\nguarantee of genuineness.\nAt another moment in the same sitting, a flower pot with cycla-\nmens having been put under the table, and raps having been heard.\nLord Adare's father reports the phenomena thus : {Experiences,\npp. 207-208) :\n\" I said to [Major] Blackburn :\n'\nGet under the table\nand hold Mr Home's feet.' He did so, and we heard the raps dis-\ntinctly over his head. Mr. Home suddenly said '\nOh, look at the\nhand near me holding a flower !\n'\nTwice he said that he saw the\nhand. I, somehow instinctively, put my hand under the table, and\nimmediately felt a flower placed very gently in it. The following\nwas then given :\n'\nThe flower is from Augusta, with fond love.'\n\"\nNow surely the crux of the whole matter is, in the present instance,\nwhether Home's feet were held at the moment the flower was placed\nin the hand of Lord Adare's father. But as to this all-important\ncirciunstance we are told nothing. Let us however be fair and note\nthat there is some evidence of a critical attitude at times. Thus Lord\nDunraven teUs us in his account of Sitting No. 76, 25th June, 1869,\nthat having had the opportunity a few days before of seeing Miss\nC\u2014 E.\u2014 write \" under supposed spirit influence,\" he \" obtained\npermission to put a few questions. Among them I asked, '\nWhat do\nyou think of Mr. Home ?\n'\nMiss R\u2014 wrote instantly, '\nHe has a\ncertain degree of power, but a vast amount of trickery.' In answer\nto another question was written, '\nHe [Home] deceives people by\npretending that he can call up the spirits of their friends, etc'\nThese and other answers made me think that this was probably a\ndeceitful spirit \" {Experiences, p. 270).\n\f114] Some Thoughts on D. D. Home. 257\nSo Lord Dunraven did show some scepticism at times. But this\nscepticism appears to have been chiefly dii-ected against those who\ndoubted Home's powers, even when such suggestions of doubt came\nfrom what was to him the dark Beyond.\nThe following extract is, I think, particularly significant. At\nSitting No. 27 (no date, but clearly in October 1868) we are told,\n{Experiences, p. 128) :\n\" Home then fetched the lamp back. We heard a knocking at\nthe door, he opened it and appeared to invite some one to come in,\nbut did not succeed ; he shut the door, when the knocking re-\ncommenced he opened it again, but was unsuccessful ; this was\nrepeated three or fovir times, at last he went and gathering some\nferns and flowers from ofi the coffin opened the door and held them\nout ; still it was in vain, the knocking again occurred at the door,\nand this time he took little Ada and led her to the door, when he\nappeared to succeed in inducing the person to come in. He said,\n'\nIt is \u2014 '\n(a little servant girl who had died two days previously).\"\nWhy have I called this extract particularly significant ? Because\nit seems to show that, at times at least, Home would have been able\nto admit an accomplice into the room if he had chosen to do so.\nThe number of sittings where we have to suppose that such an\nintroduction must have taken place, if we want to explain the\nphenomena in a natural way, is indeed exceedingly small, but, as\nI have pointed out already, there are such sittings. In the account\nI have just quoted no particularly sensational incident occurs after\nHome's movements, openings of the door, etc. But it is, I think,\nan essential part of a fraudulent mediimi's equipment that his sitters\nshould get accustomed to view without suspicion certain gestures\nwhich may ultimately play an important part in producing the\nphenomena. In order to allay suspicions nothing of any importance\nwill follow such gestures or movements at first or indeed in most\ncases. It is therefore conceivable that the sitters will attach to them\nno significance and therefore will end by omitting them from their\naccounts ; and indeed this may have happened in connection with\nthe sitting of 9th February, 1869, though another explanation is also\npossible : that the accomplice may have been hidden in the room.\nNow there is every reason to suppose that the 78 Dunraven\nsittings 1 were not different in quality from Home's other sittings.\nWe may therefore legitimately infer that in the accoimts we possess\nof some of the latter (not excepting the Crookes evidence) there are\n^ Among them we have the famous sitting of 13th December, 1868 (Home\nbeing levitated out of one window of Ashley House, Victoria Street, and\ncarried into another). This occurrence, says the then Master of Lindsay,\nlater Earl of Cra'wford and Balcarres, one of the sitters, took place with the\nmoon \" shining fuU into the room.\" As a matter of fact the new moon could\nnot then light the room, however faintly {Experiences, p. 152, footnote).\n\f258 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\n.\n[part\nomissions, perhaps not unimportant ones, likely to afford us a\nnatural clue to episodes apparently inexplicable. In the numerous\ninvoltmtary indications Lord Dunraven's candid account gives us\nin this respect lies in my oi^inion the chief value of the Experiences\nin Spiritualism ivith D. D. Home.\nTo return to Sir William Crookes's experiences : when he pub-\nlished for the first time his accounts of investigations in the phen-\nomena of Spiritualism (I refer chiefly, but not exclusively, to his first\npapers in the Quarterly Journal of Science for 1871) the reader was\ncertainly entitled to conclude from his descriptions that these\ninvestigations were scientific experiments occurring in fairly good\nlight and under conditions reminding us more or less of those which\nprevail in a laboratory. This was, so to say, a first phase.\nBut in 1889 the \" Notes on seances with D. D. Home \" published\nin Proceedings presented us with a somewhat different picture. The\nsupposedly carefully planned experiments proved chiefly\u2014though\nperhaps not exclusively\u2014to have been incidents in spiritualistic\nsittings selected out of a more or less long series. From various\npassages it was obvious that these sittings were not very different\nin character\u2014except perhaps for the personality of some of the\nsitters and at times for the intensity of the phenomena\u2014from many\nordinary ones. This was, so to say, phase number two.\nAlready at this stage it was becoming obvious that in order to\nattach a decisive importance to observations occurring under such\nconditions psychical researchers must needs throw overboard a\ncanon of evidence imposed on them but a little time previously with\nmuch insistence and against not a little opposition. Indeed if\u2014as\nsome of our most eminent members were inclined to conclude from\nsuch experiments as those of S. J. Davey\u2014no paramount importance\ncan be attached to observations made in full light and under\napparently very simple conditions (I have in view Eglinton's slate-\nwriting) but conditions not excluding the necessity for \" continuous\nobservation,\" what were we to think of the evidential cogency of\nsupposedly supernormal occurrences sometimes of a rather compli-\ncated character taking place in poor light and often unexpectedly,\nsuch as Sir William Crookes briefly described ? The conditions for\ncontinuous observations seemed here still more imfavourable than\nat the Eglinton sittings.^\nIt seems to me that the Adare Experiences in Spiritualism bring\nus one step further. AVe seem to have entered on a third stage.\n^ Personally, it is true, I have never attached decisive importance to the\nnegative argument derived from continuous observation. Why ? Because\nto me it is the personality of the witness or observer which is the paramount\nfactor, all the rest being of subsidiary importance. But I am spealdng here\nfrom the standpoint of the psychical researcher of the Hodgsonian type\u2014in\nthe physical phenomena, not in the Piper sphere.\n\f114] Some Thoughts on D. D. Home. 259\nThey present us with regard to the Home sittings and to Home's\nbehaviour at these sittings with a picture to which Sir W. Crookes's\naccounts had not accustomed us. Various actions of the medium's\nare described as to which the great scientist's notes seem to be much\nmore reticent. What are we to conclude ? Seeing as I have already\nsaid that there is not the slightest reason to thmk that the Adare\nsittings were different in quality and in character from other Home\nsittings, we are justified in thinking that if Sir William Crookes's\nnotes had been as full as Lord Adare's we should have found in\nthem, now and then, indications suggesting a possible natural\nexplanation of occurrences which as described seem to exclude it.\nThis is only a hypothesis, but a hypothesis based, it seems to me, on\ndata not to be lightly set aside.\nHere is another negative testimony bearing on Home, and a\nparticularly significant one, because coming from Baron du Potet,\nthe celebrated French mesmerist. He writes (I quote from the Revue\nMeta\/psycMque of September-October 1927, p. 390) :\n\" There is something mysterious to investigate, and it is only with\ncircumspection that we must admit the avowed and advocated cause\nof all the strange phenomena produced by IVIr. Home. In any case\nour feeling is that there is a mixture, that all is not always inde-\npendent of the medium himself and that one day we shall be\nastonished to learn that the psychic force was not alone at the service\nof Mr. Home. But is it I who dare to-day write these words of\ndistrust, I who have praised and extolled this extraordinary medium,\nI the spiritualist ? Why not, if doubt has entered my mind ?\n\" ^\nDu Potet had therefore doubts\u2014very possibly very grave ones\n\u2014\nas to the genuineness of some of Home's performances. He expresses\nthem in somewhat Delphian language, and gives no details. How\nmany of the great medium's clients and friends, it may be asked,\nmay have felt the same suspicions and under strong pressure have\nbeen prevented from uttering them ? Chi la sa ?\nThese two instances\u2014IVIr Merrifield's and Baron du Potet's\n\u2014\nshow us that, even apart from the Barthez evidence, we have\ntestimony tending to disprove the legend as to Home's immunity\nfrom detection. In any case there are in his career several suspicious\nincidents. And there is besides this most sinister similarity between\nthe substance of the Biarritz detection and the character of a great\nmany phenomena which have been recorded of him.\nI pass on to another aspect of the subject, and I think, a very\nimportant one : the late Mr. Podmore has been accused in our\npublications\u2014and possibly elsewhere\u2014of making insinuations\nagainst the honesty of Stainton Moses and also of Home (Journal,\nxxi. 140). Against such accusations I feel bound to protest emphati-\n^ [The French text of this quotation is printed in the Appendix. Hon. Ed.]\n\f260 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\ncally. D. D. Home seems to tave led, on the whole, a very pleasant\nand attractive life, moving in the \" best \" society (not precisely a\nvery competent judge in such matters as psychical research as a\ngeneral rule, I am afraid) sitting to-day with Napoleon III of France,\nto-morrow with Alexander II of Russia,^ having the satisfaction of\nhis phenomena being endorsed by one of the first scientists of the\ncentury. He is supposed never to have been |)ciic^ in the proper sense\nof the word, but he most undoubtedly derived from his sittings and\nfrom the glamour emanating from them very substantial and useful\nmaterial advantages. As a general rule the conditions xmder which\nthese sittings took place were such that, judging at least by what\nLord Adare tells us, in nineteen cases out of twenty, it was a question\nnot of Home being prevented from cheating, but of his being un-\nwilling to deceive. The \" manifestations,\" if of no fraudulent origin,\nwere most obviously inexplicable by known natural laws. It does\nnot by any means follow necessarily from this circumstance alone\nthat they were of a spmious character ; and I for my part do not\npropose to reject any really well attested evidence in, I think, almost\nany domain on purely a priori grounds. But\u2014and this is with me a\ncrucial point\u2014so long as the authenticity of the alleged phenomena\nhas not been proved beyond doubt, we are perfectly and absolutely\njustified in regarding the good faith of the supposed medium or\nclairvoyant, or whatever else, as open to suspicion. This, quite\nindependently from the \" social position \" (a rather elusive con-\nception) of this clairvoyant or medium, and whether his name be\nD. D. Home, Rev. Stainton Moses, Chamberlain X, or any other.\nTo me this is, I confess, an axiom so self evident that I am almost\nformulating it with a certain gene.\nThis self-evident truth amply justifies us in casting a shadow\n\u2014\nthe shadow of a doubt\u2014upon Home's memory and career, without\ntaking much into account in what society he moved, whose friendship\nhe enjoyed and in what drawing-rooms he was lionised.\nTwo more remarks. Primo : we are often told that the physical\nphenomena of Spiritualism are produced, on the spirit hypothesis,\nby an inferior class of entities, to whom we cannot look either for\nhigh moral teaching or for proofs of identity But with Home, on\nthe contrary, the phenomena have a distinctly spiritualistic char-\nacter ;\nthey are originated by the \" spirits \" of the sitters' deceased\nrelations, if not invariably at least often ;\nidentity tests seem also\nto be given at times. Surely it is a significant fact that this deviation\n^ One of whose A.D.C. Generals was my maternal grandfather. He believed\nHome to have authentic power, but to cheat occasionally. Mrs. Salter has\nseen a translation of part of a letter received lately by me from my grand-\nfather's daughter and bearing on the subject.\n- 1 know of course that there are exceptions to this generalisation. But\nbroadly spealdng such a statement has become almost a truism.\n\f114] Some Thoughts on D. D. Home. 261\nfrom what we were entitled to consider a \" law \" occurred in the\ncase of a privileged medium, a rarissima avis\u2014who enjoyed an\nunique opportunity in having access to various sources of infor-\nmation concerning his clients' private affairs and family matters.\nFor it is obvious that may of these clients looked on Home as un\ndes leurs, as one of their number, and had every confidence in him.\nBy calling attention to this curious fact, I do not necessarily imply\nthat its explanation must be of a sinister character ; but if not so,\nit seems to be one more instance of that diversity of \" laws \"\u2014real\nor alleged\u2014in the domain of spiritualism, and in particular of\nphysical spiritualism, which we are well entitled to regard as some-\nwhat disconcerting.\nSecundo : Were I asked which of Home's phenomena seem to me\nnevertheless particularly unlikely to have been due to trickery and\ncheating, I would answer, I think, that some of his performances with\nburning coals, especially such a case as Mr. S. C. Hall's {Experiences,\npp. 280-282), would appear to me to exceed the limits of conjuring\n(but not of a peculiar form of suggestion perhaps) ; and in this\nconnection I would add that the most conclusive evidence collected\nby the S.P.R. as to physical phenomena is possibly that which deals\nwith alleged facts of a similar character (such as the Fire-walk). It\nis not inconceivable, some will think, that in this similarity there\nmay be something more than a mere chance coincidence.\nBefore finishing I wish to remark that, so far as I have ascertained,\nsome people are even now somewhat \" touchy \" when doubts are\nexpressed as to the moral character of D. D. Home. Such people\nwill permit me respectfully to remind them that the celebrated\nmedium belongs to history. And that to matters historical that\nLatin saying (a saying, it seems to me, of somewhat doubtful\nwisdom) : De m.ortuis nil nisi bene cannot, by any means apply.\nOtherwise there would be no history !\nI also wish to say in conclusion a few words explanatory of a\npassage of my paper which is likely perhaps to be misunderstood.\nI said above that if the investigator's \" name is one of scientific\neminence we are sometimes, in retrospect at least, almost at his\nmercy.\" This sentence must not be interpreted as implying hostility\ntowards savants on my part. Believing as I do Science to be the\ngreatest benefactress of mankind, how could I view those who\nrepresent it otherwise than with feelings of the greatest respect, and\noften of the greatest gratitude ? But from this to the infallibility\nof savants there is a long way. From this to asserting that a scientist\ncannot be, in the sphere with which we are here dealing, an inadequate\nobserver ^ there is also a long way.

Nor do I think a man of science, whatever name he bears,\nis justified in omitting to describe in detail what precautions he took\nagainst fraud in his researches ; and by the way, in so speaking I\nam merely repeating what Mrs. Sidgwick said in 1886 in a paper on\nthe physical phenomena of spiritualism in our Proceedings (iv. 65),\nspecially mentioning by name in this connection Sir William Crookes\nand Professor Zollner. I do not think it improbable that the\nexplanation of part of the halo which still surroimds D. D. Home's\nname in the domain of so-called scientific investigation of his\nphenomena is to be sought somewhere in this direction ; and\ncoupled with the undoubtedly suspicious incidents and circumstances\nspoken of above, the whole seems to me to detract a good deal from\nthe reputation of the greatest of known physical mediums. I do not\nfeel justified in asserting more ; but so much can, I think, be asserted\nsafely.\nNote which Sir Oliver Lodge wishes appended to the foregoing Paper,\nas an additional cavtion to new members :\nAlthough I had no first-hand experience of Home's phenomena,\nother evidence has convinced me that psycho-physical phenomena\nare possible, and I would remind readers that there is abundant\ntestimony in favour of the production of such phenomena by Home.\nCount Perovsky's Paper aims at being a fair presentation of the\ntestimony in a contrary direction. It does not claim to settle the\nmatter, as by a judicial decision.\nAPPENDIX.\nThe French Texts or Extracts Translated in the Foregoing\nPaper.\nExtract from Dr Barthez's letter dated 25th September, 1857.\n. . .

G. Soal and after a consider-\nable amount of discussion he evolved a formula. Mr. Soal felt that\nan authoritative confirmation of this formula was desirable, seeing\nthat, while a professional mathematician, he had not specialised in\nthe statistical branch. The problem was then submitted to Dr. R.\nA. Fisher, F.R.S., who most kindly gave the benefit of his wide\nknowledge of these matters. He suggested a slight modification of\nthe formula evolved by Mr. Soal and in view of his great authority,\nthis final formula may confidently be accepted as correct.^\nI. THE METHOD.\nBy H. F. Saltmarsh and S. G. Soal.\nThe problem is as follows. The medium makes a series of state-\nments, some of which are veridical and some not. The intrinsic\nprobability of each individual statement is taken as known. The\nmethod suggested for arriving at this knowledge has been discussed\nin the appendix to the report above referred to. It should be noted\nthat this method does not profess to give the exact value of the\nindividual probability but only an estimated maximum. The result\narrived at by the application of any formula will, therefore, be a\nminimum value for the sitting as compared with pure chance : the\nactual value will always be higher. This, from the nebulous and\nindefinite nature of the subject-matter, is all that can be obtained,\nbut from the point of view of psychical research, a minimum value\nis all that is needed. It cannot be denied that it would be an in-\n1 In this paper the mathematical details, subject to Dr. Fisher's emendation,\nare due to Mr. Soal, but Mr. Saltmarsh is responsible for the application of the\nformula and the estirnation of the probabilities of the various statements.\n266\n\fEstimating Content of Mediumistic Comrmmications. 267\nestimable benefit in the work if it could be said with some confidence\nthat the veridicality of the statements made in any particular case\nwas at least so many times in excess of chance. For the purposes of\nthe mathematical evaluation of a sitting, however, the maximum\nindividual probabilities are taken to be the real actual values.\nThere are three possible conditions which may govern a speaker\nwhen making a statement : (a) He may have knowledge and be\nspeaking the truth ; (6) He may have no knowledge and be guessing ;\n(c) He may have knowledge and be speaking untruth.\nIn the case of a sitting with a mediimi it is first of all necessary to\neliminate the possibility of normal knowledge, and this can only be\ndone by a consideration of the conditions of the sitting and the\nnature of the statements made. We will suppose that this has been\ndone and that all possibility of normal knowledge, fraud, etc., has\nbeen excluded or allowed for, also that other disturbing factors such\nas cliches have been eliminated. Condition {a) would then be when\nthe mediimi possessed supernormal knowledge of some sort and\nobtained the information given by means of telepathy, clairvoyance\nor some other supernormal faculty. Condition (6) would be where\nany such faculty was absent. Condition (c) would be where the\nsupernormal faculty was what may be called negative. It may be\ndoubted whether condition (c) ever actually occurs, but for the sake\nof logical completeness it must be envisaged as a possibility. If the\nevaluation of a sitting should yield an amount of veridicality far\nbelow that attributable to chance, that is, a negative score, we\nshould have to suppose, in the absence of normal causes, that some\nsort of negative supernormal faculty was in o|)eration and had\ninhibited successful guessing.\nIt must also be borne in mind that, even where conditions (a) and\n[c) are in operation, they will not always be successful ; thus, though\nthe medium may possess supernormal faculty, she will sometimes\nmake mis-statements. Many conditions may be suggested which\nwould bring this about, for example, vagueness of the supernormal\nknowledge, fluctuations of the faculty, confusions between sources\nof information and so on. Moreover all three conditions may be\nmixed up together in the same sitting.\nThe figure given as the result of the application of the formula\nto a sitting will be called the \" real score \" for that sitting ; a further\nfigure is calculated which represents the \" standard error \" ; the\nratio of the real score to the standard error is called the \" vahie\n\"\nof the sitting.\nThere is one further point which must be mentioned. The\nevidential value of a veridical statement depends entirely on itself\nand camiot be held to be altered in any way by any subsequent\nmistakes which the medium may make, except in the limiting case\n\f268 A Method of Estimating the Supernormal [part\nwhere tlie total amount of veridicality of the sitting comes within\nthe range of chance. If I score a couple of bull's eyes, the fact that\nI may then miss the target altogether a dozen times, does not alter\nthe fact that I have made two good shots.\nThe thesis is that when normal knowledge can be excluded and\nthe real score is positive and considerably exceeds the standard\nerror, condition (a) has governed the medium to some extent, that\nis to say, he possesses some sort of supernormal knowledge ; where\nit is negative and considerably exceeds the standard error, condition\n(c) is inferred.\nTo turn now to the formula itself, let the sitting consist of n\nstatements, of which n^^ have each an intrinsic probability of p-^,\nof these being correct or veridical and - r^^ incorrect, \"^ith a\nprobability p.2 and r^ correct, % with probability ^3 and fg correct\nand so on. The ji^'s, are fractions less than unity, so that if any\nstatement has a chance of being true say once in every four times,\nthen for this statement p = \\.\nMr. Soal argued as follows. If the production of the statements\nwas governed by chance alone, then such scores should be allocated\nto the individual statements as would make the resultant score equal\nto zero. Now with a group of N statements each of the same proba-\nbility p, the most likely number of correct statements due to chance\nwill be Npi and the most likely number of incorrect statements will\nbe N-N]:). It is natm-al to assume the score of a single correct\nstatement to be - log p, and on this assumption the score for the\nNp correct statements will he-Njj log p. Hence the score for the\nN - Np incorrect statements will be +Np log p, and it follows that\nthe score for a single incorrect statement is\nNp log p\/N - Np=p log 2)\/l - p-\nIn this way the total \" probable chance score \" of the group of N\nstatements is clearly zero.\nDr. Fisher makes a slight modification in this formula. He lays\nit down that the difference in value between the scores of a correct\nand an incorrect statement should be - log p. This makes the\nscore of a correct statement = -(l-j9)log^, and of an incorrect\n= +]) log 2^- As before it is evident that the resultant chance score\nof the Njj correct and N -Np incorrect statements is zero.\nHence on this system the resultant score for a series of statements\nof which have the probability p-^^ with r^ correct, \u00ab2 have the\nprobability with r^ correct and so on is\n~r^{l-p) log p^-r^ {I-P2) logpz-r^ (l-J^s) ^^gp^, etc.\n+ (^1 - ^1) Ih log Ih + (\u00ab2 - ^2) P2 log P2 + {^3 - rs) log pg, etc.\n= (Wi - h)\nlog Px + (\u00ab2 Ih - ^2) log P2 + >\netc.\nIt now remains to calculate the Standard Error of this expression.\n\f114] Content of Mediumistic Communications. 269\nIn the case of a group of N statements each of probability f the\ntotal score has been seen to be (Nf - r) log j), where r is the number\nof correct statements in the group and the standard error for this\nscore is, by Bernouilli's theorem, calculated to be\n- -jNp (1 -p) log p.\nHence by Gauss's law of squares the Standard Error of the whole\nseries of % + . . . = n statements will be\nV n^pi {l-pi) [log Pif+n2P2 {I-P2) [log Pzf+etG.\nIn accordance with the usual practice of statisticians we shall not\nconsider any series to be significant as regards the existence of\nconditions (a) or (c) unless the total score, positive or negative as\nthe case may be, is at least equal to twice this Standard Error in\nnumerical value. In the case of a positive score greater than\n2 X S.E. there will be grounds for suspecting the existence of (a) and\nof (c) in the case of a similar negative score. If the real score is\npositive or negative but less than twice the Standard Error we\ncannot assume either conditions (a) or (c) to have been present but we\ncannot definitely infer their absence, for it is clearly possible that a\ncombination of (a) and (c), that is for positive and negative super-\nnormal knowledge might produce a result that would simulate a.\nchance score.\nII. A SPECIMEN APPLICATION OF THE METHOD.\nBy H. F. Saltmarsh.\nAs an example I will apply the formula to an actual sitting taken\nfrom the Warren Elliott series. It is a particularly good Sitter\nPresent sitting, but was not chosen for that reason but rather for its\nshortness. For the sake of brevity I give here only a summary of\nthe statements.\n(1)\n\" You had an upset at home.\" Certainly not more than one\nperson out of every four has an upset at home at any given time.\nI estimate the maximimi probability at 1\/4.\n(2)\n\" You are not worried because it is a relief.\" Very few\n\" upsets \" are \" reliefs \"\n;\nsay jj = l\/10.\n(3)\n\" It was hard on your Mummy.\" This really contains two\nstatements, first that the sitter had a mother Hving, second that the\nupset was hard on her. The age of the sitter renders the first pretty\nprobable, say three to four, jj = 3\/4 ; the second is also inherently\nprobable, most upsets in a home are liable to be hard on the mother,\nsay again 3\/4, or combined say 1\/2.\n(4) The ostensible communicator \" Couldn't do much, not only\n\f270 A Method of Estimating the Supernormal [part\nill but couldn't use arms or perhaps legs.\" This again combines two\nstatements : first that the ostensible communicator was an invalid,\nsecond that he couldn't use arms or legs. It is about seven chances\nthat any communicator, that is to say a person who has passed\nover, had been an invalid in life, say p=lj2. That any invalid\nshould besides his illness not be able to use arms or legs, may be\nfairly estimated at one in three, combined p = l\/Q.\n(5)\n\" Upset made you jolly busy.\" About even chance, j\u00bb = 1\/2.\n(6)\n\" You got young girl in house, when trouble comes she\ncollapses.\" Two statements are again combined, viz. the presence\nof the young girl in the house and her alleged collapse. The modern\ngirl does not as a rule collapse under trouble, it therefore seems fair\nto put this pretty high, say one in ten, for the combined statements,\np = ljlO.\n(7)\n\" He appreciates Mummy's courage and all your courage.\nSays you miss responsibility more than him, cause him feels him\nwasn't much use to any of you.\" Most people are courageous under\ndifficulties, say three in four, p \u2014 i\/i. It is not every invalid who is\nnot much use to his family, say even chances, p = lj2. Combined\nsay p=l\/3.\n(8)\n\" Him quite happy.\" Unverifiable.\n(9)\n\" He was broad.\" There are roughly three possible descrip-\ntions, that is, broad, medium and slight, ;2;\n= l\/3.\n(10) \" He was not tall.\" There are four possible descriptions for\nheight with Mrs. Elliott, very tall, tall, medium and short : say 1\/4.\n(11) \" Him says hims passing was really lucky kind.\" The\ncommunicator actually passed as the result of a stroke and not\nfrom the paralysis from which he had suffered for many years. His\nfinal illness was a short one. I estimate the maximum probability\nof this statement about the passing being lucky, being true of any\nperson who has died at 1\/4.\n(12) \" He is glad you did not go to a lot of expense for things.\"\nPeople do not spend so much on mourning as they used. I estimate\nthis at p = lj3.\n(13) \" Sends his love to three people in youi' house.\" The\nsignificant part of this statement is the number three. What\nproportion of families consist of three persons ? I should say not\nmore than one in four, ^ = 1\/4.\n(14) \" He was sort of ill, yet not ill, could have done things with\nhis head.\" The communicator had for years been paralysed in both\nlegs as the result of accidental injury to his hips, otherwise he was\nwell. In the above statement Topsy describes his condition very\nwell in her own peculiar manner. Such circumstances are unusual\nand the statement would not be true of many invalids, certainly\nnot one in ten. Call ^^ = 1\/10.\n\f114] Content of Mediumistic Communications. 271\n(15) \" Used to read a lot.\" About even chance, j> = 1\/2.\n(16) \" Somebody closely connected witb. you.\" Probably true\nfor any communicator, say ;p = 3\/4.\nOf tbe above statements (8) is unverifiable and is therefore\nneglected. All the rest are correct with the exception of (6). We\nhave therefore :\n1 correct of the value of ^ = 3\/4\n3\n3\nI\n1\n2\nand 1 incorrect\nReal score then is\n(1-3\/4) log 3\/4-3 (1\n-4(1-1\/4) log 1\/4\n+ 1\/10 log 1\/10\n=5-59166\nThe Standard Error is\n(1\nP=l\/4:\np = llQ\np = l\/10\nJ9\n= l\/10\n1\/2) log 1\/2 -3 (1-1\/3) log 1\/3\n1\/6) log 1\/6 - 2 (1 - 1\/10) log 1\/10\n3\/4 (1-3\/4) [log 3\/4]2+3\/2 (1-1\/2) [log 1\/2]^\n+3\/3 (1-1\/3) [log 1\/3]--\n+ 4\/4 (1-1\/4) [log l\/4]2 + l\/6 (1-1\/6) [log 1\/6]^\n+ 3\/10 (1-1\/10) [log 1\/10J2\n= V^84861 = -9212.\n-TT IT 1 pn-,i- Real Score 5-59166\nHence Value of bittmg = rT^ t\n\u2014t\u2014r=,\n= ^\n* Standard Error -9212\n= 6-2 (approx).\nA reference to the Probability Integral tables shows that for\nnormal distributions positive deviations of magnitude equal to or\ngreater than the above (6-2 x S.D) would be expected to occur rather\nless than once in a thousand million trials. I submit that this result\nis such that the hypothesis that chance alone could have produced\nthis amoimt of veridicality is definitely excluded and that the margin\nis sufficiently large to allow a substantial modification in the\nestimation of the individual probabilities if it should be considered\nthat they have been put at unduly favourable figures.\n\f\f01' IIIE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 115\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.^\nBy Dr Walter Franklin Prince.\nOn other occasions of this character, the snhject of Psychical\nResearch has been approached from the standpoint of eminent men\nwho were primarily philosophers, psychologists or physicists. That\nrare combination, the poet and scientist, has been heard. There\nhas been the light but incisive touch of the litteratem-. The states-\nman, the physiologist, the logician, the theologian, the classicist, the\nphysician, and the astronomer have spoken, likewise others who\nhave attained convictions of greater or less scope through experi-\nmentation. I, the humble follower of this illustrious line, have one\nchief passion, the essaying the solution of puzzles, and one chief\nqualification, a lifetime of indefatigable practice.\nEvolution of a Psychical Researcher.\nI speak, then, from the viewpoint of one who likes to tackle\npuzzles, and has from earliest recollection. All sorts of puzzles in\nboyhood, mechanical, mathematical, verbal. Later puzzles as to\nliterary genuineness, the identity of handwriting, mooted points m\nhistory, etc. Then puzzles in psychology. And finally puzzles in\npsychical research.\nThe first piece of work of mine which furnished a slight addition\nto human knowledge was to correct the statement in books on\nAmerican history that the so-called Blue Laws of Colonial New\nEngland were forgeries by one Samuel Peters. I am one of those\nwho, in relation to psychical research, are suspected of a will-to-\nbelieve. Since the view I came to take on that historical question\n1 Delivered at a Private Meeting of the Society, 14 July 1930.\nC\n\f274 I)r Walter Franklin Prince [part\nwas as contrary to the prevailing one as any view regarding tele-\npathy, etc., is now to prevailing views, or prejudices of the scientific\nworld, and since it was held as passionately or dispassionately, I\nhave sometimes looked back on that early jjuzzle and asked if the\nwill-to-believe led the w^ay to its solution. Really that question is\nirrelevant to the actual issue, which was decided by the facts and\nthe argument and is so accepted. But it is exactly as relevant as\nit is to facts and arguments with which this Society is concerned.\nPerhaps a previous entire conscious acquiescence in the then opinion\nof historians that the \" Blue Laws \" were forgeries by Peters only\ncovered a subconscious opposition, but that opinion can be satis-\nfactory only to those psychoanalysts to whom advocacy and\nopposition argue the same inward disposition, either openly in\noperation or latent and masked by a defensive mechanism. Perhaps\nthe first and unsought discovery, embedded in the voluminous\nColonial records, of an actual statute whose existence had been\ndenied, was guided by a desire to find it, but that would seem to\nimply seership. Since the prevailing view in respect to the \" Blue\nLaws \" and Peters had never satisfactorily been shown valid, one\nmight think it would have been gratifying to amoKr-'propre to have\nbeen the first to demonstrate that this account was true. Further\ndiscoveries of obscure statutes substantially corresponding to Peters'\nabstracts, and also of customs of the courts\u2014the begiimings of an\nAmerican common law\u2014likewise in correspondence, and finally of\na much earlier compilation from v\/hich Peters directly derived the\nmost of his examples, would seem sufficiently to account for the\nconclusion finally arrived at and to make the supposition of an\ninward bent unnecessary.\nThis instance is analyzed because it presents an exact analogy to\nsubsequent studies of a dift'erent species. Puzzles in psychical\nresearch presented themselves ; some unusual and striking fact,\napparently an anomaly, appeared, awakening ciiriosity, and\ncuriosity was the stimulus to examination ; there was the same\ninitial doubt, the same willingness either to establish or destroy as\ndevelopments directed, and the same tipping of the scales more and\nmore wdth accumulating evidence and its inexorable logic. Such,\nin a nut shell, has been the story of my being drawn into psychical\nresearch, and that of the most of us has probably not been far\ndissimilar.\nTrue, certain investigators, including one of our Presidents, have\nconfessed, nay proclaimed, that a desire to ascertain if there might\nnot be found proofs of survival, lay at the root of their investigations.\nThis desire need not cripple the spirit of rigid analysis and the logical\nsense, and it emphatically did not in the case of Myers, whose\nappraisement of cases could hardly be improved upon. Another\n\f116] Presidential Address 275\nPresident intimated that a desire to receive messages from deceased\nfriends must miderlie favourable interest in this field. To this I\nemphatically demur.\nIn the first place there is earnest study of phenomena which do\nnot in the least seem to relate to the question of survival. But, it\nmay be urged, one feels that to. prove a wider extension of psychical\npowers and relations renders more likely a still wider extension,\nreaching even to communication with intelligences once embodied\non this earth. Then I fall back upon the assertion that it is quite\npossible, and a possibility realized by some, to be so dominated by\nintellectual curiosity as to the solution of puzzles that all other\nemotions and considerations become insignificant. Not that\ninterest in, and curiosity about the question of survival need or can\nbe quite extinguished, either in ourselves or those who have contempt\nfor psychical research. That would be mental atrophy. But in all\nthe years of my experimentation with mediums, I have never asked\nfor a message from a deceased relative or friend, not because of the\nadoption of any self-denying ordinance, but because not messages\nbut data from whatever purported source were the desideratum.\nFurnished with but scanty information regarding the real puzzles\nof psychical research, and no actual observation except of a few\nexamples of professional fakery, in the rash confidence of youth I\nused to deliver lectures, \"explaining \" them all along the familiar\nlines of hallucination, delusion, auto-suggestion, mass-suggestion,\nmal-observation, memory-aberration, chance coincidence, and the\nrest.\nLater, the fact that certain distinguished representatives of the\nsciences said to be in integral opposition to the validity of any of\nthese puzzles, in the presence of their contemptuous colleagues had\nannounced their conviction that some of them were, nevertheless,\nvalid, that is that they yielded only to what we provisionally call a\nsupernormal explanation, reduced me to a silence maintained for\nyears. If psychical research were indeed a rat-hole, it was a rat-\nhole, to quote Lincoln, worth looking into. In other words, the\npuzzles must be very hard, if such men could not find a solution on\nthe old familiar terms, and hard puzzles invite the puzzle-lover. It\nmight be that all the smoke hovering above alleged mental and\nphysical phenomena was merely smudge, but it began to look as if\nunder it all there might possibly be fire.\nYears later, in the interval between the avocation of solving\ncertain historical and other puzzles, and that of attacking puzzles\nof abnormal psychology, my curiosity was again attracted to those\nof psychical research, and I undertook a course of intensive reading\nof the literature most suited for the student, the Proceedings of the\nS.P.R. After making all deductions that mental self-respect would\n\f276 Dr Walter FranJdin Prince [part\nallow, there remained many focal points in the mass of evidence of\none kind and another, for which the only escape from perhaps more\nextreme theories of the supernormal was to adopt throughout the\nlogical technique of Podmore which itself involved a supernormal\ntheory stretched to the uttermost. Indeed, it seemed as if the lines\nbetween the evidence and his farthest telepathic assumptions were\nattenuated to invisibility.\nHere active interest again subsided with the coming into con-\nsideration of puzzles in abnormal psychology. Then, as late as\n1912, it was re-kindled permanently by an incident comparatively\ntrivial, but which acted, as personal experience often does, as a\nprecipitant.\nI had lately moved three thousand miles to California. No\nbiographical sketch had preceded or followed my advent in the little\ncity, no Who's Who or similar work was then available to give facts\nregarding my parentage, and to not a soul there had there been any\noccasion to allude to such. My wife and I were calling for the first\ntime, without previous notice, upon a young woman, wife of a. local\nbusiness man. I saw a planchette on the table and asked, \" Do\nyou operate that ? \" \" We have done so a few times,\" she replied.\n\" Get anything 1\n\" \" Mainly '\nyes '\nand '\nno '\nto questions. And\nonce we got '\nBill.' \" Laughingly I said, \" Suppose we try our\nluck,\" and she, who was but languidly interested, and I, put our\nhands upon the instrument. She did not cease talking with Mrs\nPrince, nor look at the planchette, nor was she, I think, aware\nthat it was moving until the following words were drawing to a\nclose: \"W.M. Prince. Your father, W. M. Prince.\" These, W.M.,\nwere my father's initials, and each of them might have been\u2014of\ncourse not all with equal chance\u2014any one of twenty-five other\nletters.\nMy hand was indeed on the board likewise, but I have never been\nable to produce a single automatic jiggle with planchette, ouija or\npencil, usually my added hand stops or impedes the process of\nanother, and it never has evidenced helping. And, after she became\nconsciously interested, the lady, with or without me, got nothing\nmore of interest.\nComparatively a slight thing, but a puzzle, nevertheless. Not\noffered as evidence for others, but to me, critically aware of all the\nsurrounding circumstances, it pointed the way for sustained inquiry.\nSince then I have experimented with a multitude of persons. All\nbut a comparatively few have yielded nothing beyond possible\nnormal explanation. But these few, separated by a wide gap from\nthe rest, have been capable of producing, not at all times nor\nwith all persons, complex groups of correlated statements,\ncorrect or approximately so, under conditions and to a degree\n\f115] Presidential Address 211\nnot admitting, in my judgment, of any of tlie usual sceptical\nexplanations.\nWilliam James, in his Presidential Address, said that Mrs Piper\nwas the white crow of his experience. Mrs Soule (\" Chenoweth \"),\nSra de Z., Mrs King and the singular happenings in my own resi-\ndence during many successive months, are the particular \" white\ncrows \" of my experience.\nMr Piddington gave his opinion, in a Presidential Address, that\nit is impossible for a person to be as much impressed by evidence\nin this field furnished by investigators who are, relatively to himself,\nforeigners, as by the evidence of compatriots. I go farther, and\nassert that it is impossible as yet for anyone to be so much impressed\nby evidence furnished by aAy other man as by evidence of similar\ncogency arising in the comse of his own experience. This emphasis\nupon personal experience may be entirely without, or it may have\nsome justification. \"With persons of untrained or uncritical men-\ntality, it may mean nothing more than a deeper tinge of feeling, but\na person of aptitude for and training and experience in critical\ninvestigation, no matter who he is, can never feel quite certain that\nanother of his own rank has not committed an inadvertence or\nneglected a minute precaution, as he is quite confident that in a\nparticular case, he himself has not done.\nTwo comparatively brief (and I select them because they are\nbrief) concrete groups of medmmistic affirmations, occurring in my\nown experimentation, would alone be enough to bring me to ap-\nproximate certainty that information may be acquired by other\nthan the means universally recognized. Upon no other critical\nperson could they exercise an equally compelling force, since no one\nelse could be as certain as I that there were not inadvertently omitted\nfrom the narrative circumstances which ought to have been taken\ninto account.\nI refer (1) to Mrs King's 34 testable statements while an unseen\nobject was held between her palms, 33 of which were correct and 1\nI partially so, (\"Studies in Psychometry,\" Proc. A.S.P.R. xviii. 204-18),\nand (2) Mrs Soule's \" Story of Stephen,\" resurrecting almost in its\nentirety and with wealth of detail, an incident of my boyhood\n{Leonard and Smile Experiments, B.S.P.R. pp. 334-52). These two\nincidents, united with the others contained in two reports alone of\nthe work of Mrs Soule and Mrs King, done under my eye, are such\nthat, being satisfied that no normal sources of information were\nopen, my mind revolts at the supposition that there could be con-\ntained such a quantity, a proportion and a quality of coincidence\nby chance.\nAnd backed by experimental results in other personal quarters,\nand by the ever-growing phalanx of results reported by other\n\f278 Dr Walter Franhlin Prince [part\ninvestigators whose astuteness and special experience are well-\nattested, I have slowly, very slowly, been forced to accept types of\nsupernormal mental plienomena, to the number, in their external\ndescription, of half a dozen. I will not say they are, to me, as\ncertain as that parallel lines cannot meet, as it appears that doubt\nhas been cast upon that proposition. But I will say, carefully\nmeasuring my words, that they are to me at least as well established\nas is the existence and career, in all its relations, of Socrates.\nMythical characters have been invented and believed in for cen-\nturies, as likewise long narratives of purportedly historical but really\nimaginary facts. Thus the hypothesis, wild though it be, is yet\nconceivable, that Plato and Xenophon conspired to invent Socrates,\nbiography, personal description, conversations, addresses and all,\nsheerly out of imagination, in order to play a huge practical joke\nupon the gullible centuries to come, and that later copyists of the\nclassics, say in the first centuries of our era, aware of the shaky\nfoundations of the Socrates story, but interested in occultism and\nhence in the \" voice,\" altered other classics in copying them, intro-\nducing the casual references to Socrates which we find, and\nobliterating denials. This would only be doing on a gigantic scale\nand with more extraordinary skill what was actually being done,\nlikewise with an ethical motive, as witness the forged Gospels and\nthe interpolations in Josephus. A hypothesis so preposterous as\nthis I nevertheless find it easier to entertain regarding those facts\nof which we have no original manuscript, than I do to apply any\nsuggested explanation or combination of explanations, and thus\ndeprive of their supernormal significance, certain complexes of facts\nof several of the types to which we have given so long and pains-\ntaking study.\nSome mechanical puzzles I can execute, and know just the\nmechanical principles on which the at first apparently impossible\nis really possible. But there are others which I have equally solved\nas facts, but I yet do not understand the mechanical principles\ninvolved, as a skilled mechanician might. We have an analogy to\nthis in psychical research, wherein we have established certain\ncategories of facts, concerning two or three of which we theorize\nwith more or less confidence, whereas we can as yet only vaguely\nconjecture regarding the others.\nThe Will-to-Believe.\nOn the American side of the ocean, at least, there has been much\nparroting of William James's expression, the will-to-believe, with\nthe intent of disjjaraging serious studies in psychical research whose\nfacts the critics knew not how to meet.\n\f115] Presidential Address 279\nThere should be made a distinction between the will-to-l)elieve\nand the will-to-prove. Of course so far as a man has arrived at\nany conchision he has the hitter and should have. For him it is\nimportant that the facts rather than the desire have produced the\nwill-to-prove, lest this be turbulent and unruly. But if it is not, if\nits current is proportional to the cogency of the facts, then it is\nquite irrelevant to the reader whether the author at any stage was\npossessed by the will-to-believe or not. If the original material is\nguaranteed (stenographically reported, et al.) then all the damage a\nwill-to-believe is capable of is in vitiating the interpretation of and\nargument from the facts, so far as these are ventured. But the\nbasic material being guaranteed, to the extent that its interpreta-\ntion and the argument thence emerging are valid, they are their\nown vindication. All peeping behind the scenes to discover a will-\nto-believe is silly.\nDarwin while for many years gathering and examining facts\ngradually saw his grand hypothesis rise and shape itself as the\nprocession of facts directed. More and more conviction grew in the\nessential validity of his hypothetical scheme. At length he had the\nwill-to-prove which found expression in The Origin of Species. But\nto the reader all that is important is whether his record of facts is\ntrue and, granting that, whether his interpretation of the facts and\nhis general syiithetic conclusion are convincing. Probably no\nreader in the seventy years since that book was issued ever troubled\nhimself with the question whether Darwin had the will-to-believe.\nOne sees in a moment, should the question be put, that it is irre-\nlevant and inane. Such an imputation is flung only at the authors\nof studies in psychical research, and it has the value solely of an\nepithet or a sneer.\nBut of course there is such a thing as a mischievous will-to-\nbelieve, which leads to careless credulity, as there is a fanatical\nwill-to-prove which leads to intellectual dishonesty. How shall one\nprotect himself from the taint of either 1 Every intellectual\noperation is accompanied by emotion, and if to be devoid of emotion\nis a prerequisite, no scientific work is possible. The only way by\nwhich the emotion may be made iimocuous, is by accustoming one-\nself not to associate it wdth the outcome of a process but with the\nprocess itself. It is the difference between a conscious or sub-\nconscious \" I ho2)e that this (or that) is coming out \" and \" I wonder\nwhat is coming out.\" Exactly as an assayist presumably tests a\nmineral specimen brought in by a cUent, or a chemist analyzes a\nblood stain in connection with a criminal trial. I do not declare\nthat anyone can perfectly achieve this detachment, but think that\nmany are so constituted that by practice they can approximate the\nmental habit of expending their emotion in the mere determination\n\f280 Dr Wcdter FranJdin Prince [part\nof the facts and tlieir relations, and of not caring before a particular\ncase is in the last stages of the process of investigation whether a\nparticular possible hypothesis will be confirmed or negatived.\nPsychical Research De'mands Intellechtal Rectitude.\nAll scientific investigation demands aloofness from every ex-\ntraneous consideration. But the psychical researcher above all\nothers needs aloofness, devotion to truth, and moral courage. He\nis subjected to temptations as no other type of investigator is to\nany such degree, to inner urges, to outer pushes and pulls. The\nchemist, the biologist, the physicist is subject to no appeal to regard\nhis subject matter emotionally, but there have been psychical\nresearchers who imdoubtedly have been influenced by liking, and\npossibly some by disliking, for the human subject. The desire to\nplease a clientele inevitably spells a greater or less scientific dam-\nnation. The psychical researcher must, in this relation, disregard\nmotives of fame, fortune, and favour, and put by his very hopes of\nHeaven, that his intellect may function undisturbed. Perhaps it is\nnot needful for all investigators to go quite so far, but there is need\nof those who can and will do it.\nWhen a particular field or class of phenomena is under investi-\ngation, and until its facts are independently determined, they should\nbe dealt with exclusively, and no considerations brought in from\nanother field of facts or claims which are themselves debatable\nor which show no immediate connection with the facts under\ninspection.\nThis is plainly seen when I refer to a religious sect in America\nwhich holds that the Bible teaches that all men at death are virtually\nannihilated until the Day of Resurrection. Viewed through the\nmedium of such a dogma no evidence of survival could make an\nimpression upon a man who holds it and will not for the time being\nlay it aside. Such has been the effect in past generations of making\nthe Bible a text-book of astronomy, geology, and biology. Every\nbook of a past period which has professed to discuss a science, and\ninstead of viewing it in the light of its own facts has done so through\nthe medirmi of extraneous dogmas or sacred texts perhaps egregi-\nously misinterpreted is amusing reading to-day, to most religious as\nwell as to secular minds.\nBut so must religion, ethics, every extraneous consideration, be\nleft aside, when one is engaged in an assay of current phenomena.\nThis sounds cold-blooded, and a religious person might think it a\ncounsel of evil. It is not ; whoever doubts that any and every field\nof phenomena, when viewed solely in the light of its own evidence,\nwill eventually yield truth in harmony with truths derived from\n\f115] Presidential Address 281\nother fields\u2014lie it is who is the infidel, who doubts the miity of the\nuniverse.\nThe vitiating effects of bias, of a desire to reach a foreseen end,\nis illustrated perhaps nowhere more clearly than in biographies.\nFormerly the most of them were panegyrics that were silent about\nCromwell's wart, and corrected Washington's occasional bad spell-\ning and too vigorous language. Of late may of them specialize in\nwarts and peccadilloes, and the last state is worse than the first.\nIt was your Boswell who first in the history of mankind, so far as\nI know, enunciated clearly the true norm of biography, and magni-\nficently illustrated it in his Life of Johnson. He told the truth about\nthe man he admired, the truth in all its parts and varieties and\nproportions. He was almost the discoverer of scientific biography,\nand for this he deserves honour more than his detractor Macaulay,\nfor all the splendour of that political poem, the History of England.\nAnd what was the result of Boswell's discovery that it was be.st to\ntell the truth throughout? That Johnson is one of the best known\nand best loved characters in English history, and that a whole group\nof figures grouped about Johnson stand out as in a spot light.\nIt seems elementary to say that it is always best to tell the truth.\nBut this is not always the sole goal even in scientific investigation.\nAs Jared Sparks, old-time president of Harvard^, thought it would\nnot do to let the public know how human Washington was (and so\nmade him an imloveable graven image), as some pious folk would\nbalk the freedom of investigation lest it injure religion, so some\ninvestigators pass by, cover up or cast on the ash heap the residual\nscraps which annoy them. It is said, as you know, that when a\ncertain European announced his beautifully roimded theory and\nwas told that some facts were adverse to it, he replied, \" So much the\nworse for the facts.\" But do you remember that following the\ndeath of a well-knov\/n psychical researcher, not of your land, one\nof his friends remarked in print, in substance, that he did not allow\nsuch a thing as a little contrary fact to disturb him 1 There were\nprinted an epochal report and discussion of a case of dissociation,\nbut certain facts which puzzled and nauseated the psychologist\nwhom we all honour were entirely omitted. Probably he thought\nhe was doing right, that printing these unpleasant facts would foster\nsuperstition. But it was not right nor was it truly scientific\u2014the\nfacts should be told though the heavens fall. Perhaps one of the\nkeys to the interpretation was thrown away. Perhaps something\nwhich harmonized with a factor of the Sanders Case, the Fancher\nCase, the Doris Case, and the Mary Barnes Case, or with a puzzling\nfactor in some other group of cases, has been lost, whereas such data\nare obtained all too rarely. No man of science any more than any\nbiographer, may rightfully quarrel with his facts or select certain\n\f282 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part\nclasses for exhibition and other classes for concealment, according\nto his taste.\nDr Sadler is deserving of honour when in his book The Mind at\nMischief, in the midst of his warnings relating to fraud, delusion,\nhallucination, illusion, etc., and his recital of cases which he found it\npossible to explain by the principle of psychology, we find him\nrepeatedly saying, \"But see Appendix.\" And we find that there\nhe reveals the fact that out of a hundred cases he has found one\nwhich he has long studied and which does not yield to such a\nsolution. I parenthetically remark that I doubt if, had I not\nexceptional opportunities for hearing of promising human subjects,\nmore than one in a hundred which I have met would have seemed\ncompellingly to demand some supernormal solution. But the point\nhere is that by telling the whole truth, Dr Sadler made his book a\nwell-balanced one ; not only did it warn against falling into the\none ditch of credulity, but it did not drive into the other of un-\nreasoning incredulity.\nPsychical Researches Ranked with the Historical Sciences.\nBy at least two Presidents you have been told that so far the\nmethods of psychical research are those of historical research plus\nthose of the courts, rather than those of physics and chemistry.\nAs one who has built two or three small bricks into the edifice of\nhistory, and is aware what painstaking and critical processes may\nbe applied to the task of determining historical facts, I am not sure\nthat this leaves psychical research in an entirely lamentable state.\nThe facts, for example, of Nelson's life were not of a nature to be\nestablished in a la,boratory, but that he was an admiral of the\nEnglish navy, that he was in command at the naval battle of\nTrafalgar, that he won the battle, that thus Napoleon's plans were\nshattered, that Nelson was killed in the battle, etc., are, I take it,\nas little subject to doubt as the facts of chemistry and physics.\nThere is bad history as there is bad science. For a long time it\nwas believed that the first criminal code of Virginia was an impor-\ntation by one of its governors of the code governing his army when\nhe was in the service of Holland. This was as erroneous as the\nhistory of phlogiston, which was likewise long believed. Science\nhad to wait until certain methods had been improved and certain\nintermediate discoveries made before the true nature of combustion\ncould be determined. History had to wait, perhaps, until certain\ncritical methods of approach had come to command before the\ntheory of the origin of the Virginia Code could be shown false. At\nlength the martial code of the English army in Holland was trans-\nlated and foTind utterly incongruous with the claim. Then there\n\f115] Presidential Address 283\nwas made a laborious examination of various proclamations posted\nin Jamestowi in consequence of emergencies which arose in the\ncommunity life of the colony, and time sequences and verbal\nidentities were so constant and consistent that there remained no\ndoubt how many articles of the code did in fact originate. Tech-\nnically the law of inverse squares may have a better standing, or\nvarious uniformities which exist in the phenomena of electricity\nand can be exhibited by experiment anew any day, but practically\na great range of historical as well as of scientific facts are certain.\nPerhaps mathematically one of the fixed stars is more inaccessible\nto our bodily presence than is the planet Mars, but we are entirely\nconvinced that we shall spend a vacation on neither.\nIn a very valid sense, too, we can repeat experiments in historical\ninvestigation. The original experiment was to apply the various\ncritical tests, say, to the original and validitated documents and by\nthat process to reach certain conclusions. The documents are\nmaterials as fully as are substances in a crucible or retort. And\nthereafter, any qualified person may go to those documents and\nrepeat the experiment and, if the first conclusion was correct, he\nwill probably reach the same conclusion.\nIt may be said that what I choose to call historical science as\ncontrasted with mere amateur scribbling about history, while it\ncan, where its materials are adequate, fix the outstanding or surface\nfacts, when it tries to trace their ultimate reasons which are to be\nfound in the souls and half-concealed machinations of men, becomes\nuncertain and utters conflicting opinions. But are not the natural\nsciences in a similar situationf Do any of their experts expect,\nany more than Newton expected, to reach the very bottom of the\nriddles of nature and in their ultimate speculations do they not also\nexpress opinions at variance with each other ? Of course, even\nwhen the extant materials have been abimdant, historical scholars\nhave erred even in their major conclusions. Then it is the business\nof other investigators to repeat the process by more careful methods\nand correct the mistake. Exactly this is a frequent episode in the\nhistory of the natu-ral sciences. Dr Bastian, for example, instituted\na series of experiments in heating certain infusions arid sealing them\nas he supposed from the air, and he annoimced that life had ap-\npeared and that he had demonstrated abiogenesis. Then Huxley\nrepeated the experiments, taking more pains to exclude the air, and\nno life appeared.\nBut more than this. Certain of the natural sciences escape in\npart or entirely from the laboratory, do not repeat their phenomena\nbefore a class, have to be studied by what may be called field work,\nin the spots where their exhibits happen to be found. This is true,\nparticularly of geology, which is what may be called an historical\n\f284 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part\nscience. There are in geology, and, for that matter, in anthro-\npology, all sorts of possibilities of getting temporarily astray in\nby-paths, and donbtless never can these sciences become as tech-\nnically exact as chemistry and physics, but does any intelligent and\ncultured man doubt that we are making solid progress in tracing\nthe history of the planet and of the human race 1\nBy this time the analogy to psychica,! research has become\nnoticeable. We also have to go to places, that is in human ex-\nperience, where the phenomena are found, and geologists and\nanthropologists have to argue from their discovered facts much as\nwe do from ours.\nOf course the exhibits of geology and anthropology, being\nmaterial, are visible, and many of them may be seen in museums,\nwhereas most psychical exhibits, being mental, are not tangible, and\ncontinue to exist only as records. This is a disadvantage, but taking\ninto consideration the centi;ries to come psychical research has its\nadvantage. The available exhibits or visible evidences of say\ngeology, although immense, are yet limited, whereas in the centuries\nto come the exhibits of psychical research, so far as they are genuine,\nwill repeat themselves in all their species indefinitely, here and there,\neven though we may never be able to tell in advance just when and\nwhere they may come, and the evidence will continue to pile up\nuntil the facts become as incontestable as the major facts of history.\nVolcanic eru]3tions are also generally temporary, and the evidence\nof volcanology is largely in the form of personal testimonies and\nrecords. And if volcanic eruptions can sometimes be foretold, this\nis not true of the fall of aerolites. Very few if any scientific men\nhave ever seen one fall, and the where and when of their falling\ncannot be controlled.\nDr Schiller remarked, in his Presidential Address, that the modern\nmind tends to hold that \"Historical evidence never suffices to\nestablish scientific truth.\" Very well, and two pages earlier he\ntruly told us that \"the visions of Jeanne d'Arc, for example,\ndecisively checked the English conquest of France, and force us\nto choose between a recognition of their supernormality and the\nalternative that '\ndelusions ' may be the really important and\ndynamic forces in human life.\" There is no lack of certainty that\nJeanne d'Arc did have these subjective experiences and that they\ndid influence Jeanne to certain acts whereby the tide of English\nconquest was turned back. This evidence is purely historical, it\nis not a part of established scientific truth, it is only truth, as well\nas established in the convictions of mankind as any truth of the\nlaboratory can possibly be. It should be added that Dr 8chiller :\nstated that he did not entirely agree with the dictum which he\nquoted.\n\f115] Presidential Address 285\nFacts and Hypotheses.\nA friend of mine and of psychical research remarked that the\nmere collection of facts is not science, although a preliminary step\nto it, and that science begins with the formation of a hypothesis.\nAnd he said that it would not be science to set down, \" Last night\nI saw the moon,\" and morning after morning to repeat the record,\n\" I saw the moon last night.\"\nWe can all agree that to go no further than that would not be\nscience. And practically that, with few exceptions, is all which had\nbeen done in relation to our field of phenomena, up to 1882. There\nhad been the telling of wonder-tales, little more. Examine any of\nthe periodicals devoted to psychical phenomena and issued prior to\nthe date specified, and see how many of the reports of incidents and\nexperiments carry with them any satisfactory guarantee of validity.\nBut the collection of facts coupled with testing of the facts, the\nevidence of their validity, the analysis of the facts, the classification\nof the facts, and the determination of the relations of the facts and\nthe conditions imder which the facts occiu\", are a very large and\nessential part of the scientific process, and that is what we have been\nchiefly engaged in for many years.\nWhat, is not the discovery of a new planet science ? Is not the\ndetermination that it is a planet and not a mere comet science ?\nWas not the marshalling of myriads of facts by Darwin to evidence\nhis theory a part of his scientific work not to be set apart from the\ntheory itself 1 Were not the laborious and ingenious analysis of\npitchblende by the Curies, the discovery of radiiim, the determina-\ntion of its properties and its relations to other elements science ?\nYet all these are facts, and the work done in bringing them to\nlight is analogous to that which we are doing in a very different\nfield.\nThere is a very great difference between the facts which still,\nafter nearly half a century of collecting, psychical research continues\nto collect and repeating over and over, \" Last night I saw a moon.\"\nNo one, scientist or yokel, denies or doubts that there is a moon.\nBut our facts are still doubted and still denied. Who will have\npatience to consider our hypotheses, so long as they discredit the\nfacts for which the hypotheses are framed 'i There is no way to\nconvince the scientific world of the facts except by multiplying them\nand increasing the cogency of the proof and the number of competent\nattestants.\nFurthermore we do not simply reiterate facts of precisely the\nsame description. From time to time we note in some new case of\nthe same kind as often reported before a peculiarity which we had\nnot before observed or which had not been so strikingly exhibited,\n\f286 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part\nsome indication which, taken with others previously noted, has its\nbearings upon the hypotheses which we are seeking.\nFor ages men said \" I saw the moon last night \" before they came\nto know anything valid regarding it. The time came with the in-\nvention of the telescope when they really began to see it. And\nseeing it then a dozen or a hundred times did not exhaust the\npossibilities of the extension of knowledge by seeing, for seeing it in\nvarious aspects, and the continued study of what was seen, with the\naid of wondrous scientific processes, still continued productive.\nWith better and better telescopes, more is seen ;\nby the aid of\nphotography still more fruitful is the seeing.\nThe sim has been seen by all men day after day from the dawn\nof time, but still astronomers travel thousands of miles to see it just\nbefore, during, and just after eclipse, and still they are unsatisfied,\nfor they continue to see and discover facts which are new or to\nstrengthen facts which were uncertain.\nSo it is in psychical research. From time to time there is recorded\nan instance of a type of phenomena, which is unusually suggestive\nof the process which lies behind so that, as in other species of inquiry,\nthere is always the zest of the unexpected addition of new light on\noften-repeated facts of the same species.\nI note a tendency on the part of some who have pursued psy-\nchical research and some in other fields of investigation to think it\nrequisite to form a \" working hypothesis,\" symmetrically outlined\nas a lay figure, very early in the process of the collection of facts.\nThe danger of that, as it seems to me, is that the investigator may get\nso attached to his hypothesis as, unconsciously, to cultivate a special\nmental vision which will colour the facts. An analogous case is that\nof Professor Berringer who, shown forged fossils differing but\nslightly from types with which he was familiar, did not take into\nconsideration any hypothesis except that the story of their being\ndug up in situ was correct and was thereafter led along by slow degrees\nto credit wider and wider departures rmtil it reached the shores of\nabsurdity.\nI have known of more than one stidden awakening from a hypo-\nthesis dream, like the rude awakening of Berringer, in the field of\npsychical research.\nEspecially where the facts are elusive, obscure, and problematical\nalmost beyond comparison, it appears to me better to put off for a\nlong time the confident espousal of any hypothesis, but to keep all\npossible hypotheses constantly in mind, and to pursue the ledger\nmethod of crediting and debiting to each as the facts seem to\nwarrant. Many items may have to be put down as equally favour-\ning two or more hypotheses at the same time.\nI by no means intimate that there is no category of facts in\n\f115] Presidential Address 287\npsychical research in relation to which it is not now expedient to\nframe and urge a hyi^othesis. I should say that the time had not\ncome for this in what is called psychometry, but that it is not too\nearly for the telepathic and spiritistic theories to be urged against\neach other in relation to mediumistic \" messages.\" The very fact\nthat there are these two opposing hypotheses, that psychical re-\nsearchers are not agreed in their theories of causation, has been\npointed to as a reproach.\nPsychology is hardly situated so as to rejDroach us with dignity.\nThe psychological concepts of a Bergson or a McDougall are in\nsharp conflict with those of a Watson, to whom psychology is little\nmore than dynamic physiology, a system of conditioned physical\nreflexes. And the methods run all the way from that which em-\nphasizes the value of analytical introspection to that which denies\nthat there is any value whatever to introspection. Physical science\nmight indeed cry \" A plague o' both your houses,\" but on second\nthoughts blush to do so, since its history contains many a chapter\nof conflict, and in some quarters the smoke of battle has hardly yet\nlifted.\nIt should remember that the two-fluid theory, the one-fluid theory,\nand other theories of electricity were fought over for a century and\na quarter, imtil Maxwell turned them all out of doors. It should\nremember that for ages \" the doctrine that nature abhors a vacuum \"\nwas a part of the scientific gospel, until the discovery with its\nmomentous consequence that the \" abhorrence \" ceases at a certain\nheight. It would do well not to forget its old theory of\n\" phlogiston \" which reigned from Becker in 1680 until Romford\nannounced his molecular theory of heat in 1798, and did not receive\nits final quietus xmvA Joule's researches forty years later. Even in\nrelation to evolution Dr Nabours has lately said :\n\" We are still in a\nmorass, it may as well be admitted, with regard to the ultimate\njjroblems.\" All we have is \" a rough path, a sort of crude track in\nthe jungle.\"\nWith or without this becoming example, psychical research can\nafford to be very modest. It is true that it has but obscurely\nbegun to trace some paths in the perplexing region which it is trying\nto explore, and that not all its searchers are agreed that these are\nthe right ones. What else could be expected, when another \" his-\ntorical \" science, after more years and the labours of a hundred times\nthe number of investigators, must speak with such restraint of its\nattainments.\nA Plea for Sweetness.\nWhere persons dift'er in regard to facts or interpretation of facts\nit is a pity that their exchange of views is not always carried on\n\f288 Dr Waller Franklin Prince [part\nwith the calmness and good temper which befits academic dis-\ncussion. I do not propose to give any instances nor do I propose\nto construct any diagrams of \" rows \" and \" friction \" between\nparticular persons, as was attempted b}^ one of my friends. In the\nfirst place, I do not think this a measure calculated to lessen the\nevil, and in the second place his effort would not encourage me to\nthink I could make an accurate survey of two continents. To my\nsurjjrise I found by his graphic chart that I was supposed to be in\nconflict with my friend himself and that I was also set down as being\nin a \" row \" relation to a man with whom I had never conversed or\ncorresponded, and of whom I never had made mention in any\nof my writings, in my life.\nBut it is a matter of history for the last eighty years, that investi-\ngators in this field, particularly those of a cautious and conservative\ntype, have been frequently assailed in most bitter fashion by a\ncriticism which professes to penetrate their very souls, and dis-\ncover therein various malignancies and moral delinquencies. Such\nwas the treatment of Agassiz sixty years ago, and how many other\ninstances coidd be given ! In fact, it would be hard to find cases\nof scientific men of standing who, having consented to take part in\na psychical investigation, and having failed to reach conviction,\nhave not been attacked with ridicule and personal imputation.\nThe impolicy of such a course should have been evident all along.\nWithout doubt, it is eminently desirable that such men should be\ninduced to pay attention to psychical facts, so far as their other\nduties permit, not for an hour or a week, but for years. But when\none is charged with moral obliquity and intellectual crime of which\nhe does not feel guilty, and held up as an object of scorn, is it any\nwonder if there is added to his initial doubts a personal distaste, so\nthat he can never again be induced to interest himself in the subject ?\nI doubt not that progress has been greatly deterred by such re-\nactions which, if they were not otherwise objectionable, would at\nleast be short-sighted and impolitic.\nI have always admired the degree to which the officers and\ninvestigators of the S.P.R. have kept discussion upon a calm,\njudicial, intellectual plane. Not only have all its Presidents, when\nthey had occasion to refer to species of phenomena which had not\nyielded to the Society's investigations very satisfactory results,\nurged that the investigation of these species should go on; not only,\nin reporting such a case, has there seldom been lacking great care\nto give due weight to all supernormal possibilities in connection\nwith doubtfxil phenomena ; but when representatives of the\nSociety have been fallen upon as though they constituted the\nGuy Fawkes gang of Psychical Research, caught plotting to blow\nup the whole edifice, they have still kept their tempers, controlled\n\f115] Presidential Address 289\ntheir pens, and replied in the terms of reasoning and not those\nof emotion.\nAnd since I deem it a duty to set forth my views as to the com-\nparative evidential status to-day of physical and mental phenomena,\nand some of the measures which seem to me desirable to adopt in\nthe future survey of both fields, I trust that all who hear or read\nwhat is to come will at least credit me with sincerity, and that if\nany discover errors of statement, they will convince me by the only\neffective means, logic and evidence. It ought to be quite possible\nfor one honest investigator, whichever side of a question he espouses,\nto listen to the differing views of another honest investigator,\nwith perfect equanimity.\nPhysical PJi enomena.\nIn view of the facts that (o) between persons generically known\nas psychical researchers difference of opinion exists on a wider scale\nin relation to physical than to mental phenomena, some going to the\nextreme of disbelieving that any genuine examples of any type of\nthe former exist, while at the other extreme some maintain that\nI there have been many genuine examples of several types; {h) this\ndisparity of opinion leads to unpleasant reflections, belief being\nexplained as due to insufficient experience of a special kind, sensory\ndeception, the beguilements of the art of magic, etc., and disbelief\nimputed to obstinate prejudice, the baleful effects upon the pheno-\nmena of inward opposition, etc. ;\n(c) although organized attention\nof one sort or another has been paid to physical phenomena for\nI\neighty years, and although some varieties of manifestation have\nalmost disappeared, others have arisen to take their places, and\nsettlement of the original question is as far off as ever ;\nand, most\nto be emphasized [d), the disgust engendered in the minds of a host\nof scientific and intelligent people by the numerous scandals of\nspurious physical phenomena, which have been frequent for eighty\nyears and continue to this day, illogically but naturally extends also\nto mental phenomena and goes largely to explain inattention to\nand inability to appreciate at its true value the evidence for the\nsupernormality of certain mental phenomena, therefore : (f ) It is\nsupremely desirable that there should be a speedy settlement of\nthe question whether there are genuine physical phenonena, and,\nif so, of what types and descriptions.\nIn view of the facts that, (\u00ab) in general, the phenomena referred\nto are concerned with tangible objects and their movements, either\nthe purported production of supernormal substances, variously\ncharacterized, and their supernormal movements, or the super-\nnorr^'^l movements of normal objects, and (6) these phenomena are\n\f290 Dr Walter Franldin Prince [part\ncapable of being repeated indefinitely, if not in all experiments, at\nleast in a large proportion of tliem :\n(2) theoretically the deter-\nmination whether a given type is genuine should be a matter of\ncomparative ease, not requiring a very long period of experimen-\ntation. There must be some factor in this which makes it differ\nfrom every other sort of physical experimentation.\nIn view of the facts that in other fields of physical investigation\nthe experimenter (a) has the full use of his hands, here not, [h) has\nthe benefit of the full use of his eyesight, is here wholly or partly\ndeprived of it, (c) has his sense of hearing unblocked, here frequently\nmore or less blocked, [d) the exceptions to the above rules being\nwholly subject to the will, not of the experimenter but of the subject\nor the subject's alleged spirit control, and (e) is free to employ all\nsuitable instruments and processes when and as seems best, but here\nis utterly denied them, limited in the scope of using them or dictated\nto as to the moment when they may be employed :\n(3) it is fair to\nconclude that the inability to make visible progress toward a\nrapprochonent where theoretically this should be easiest, is due\nto the senses being more or less blocked, and the means which science\nand common-sense suggest more or less denied, as is the case in no\nother department whatever of physical investigation, and to the\ndoubts inevitably arising relative to the possibilities of sensory\ndeception and the arts of conjuring. And it is well known that\nthese disabilities and inhibitions are imposed on the ground of a\nset of alleged psychic laws. It would be rash to deny, antecedently,\nthat any of these asserted laws is not a valid one.\nBut, in view of the facts that (\u00ab) to a marked degree in general\nand particular, the alleged psychic laws of physical phenomena\ncorrespond with the precautions which would be necessary to pro-\ntect imposition, (b) many of them were first promulgated in connec-\nnection with old-time mediums who afterwards became notorious\nthrough exposure, (c) certain once confidently asserted psychic laws\nhave been discarded (e.g. the one declared by Thomas R. Hazard of\nAmerica and adopted by Alfred R. Wallace and others in England,\naccording to which, when a spirit is grasped, the medium is drawn\n\" swift as lightning \" through bonds and bars, to \" coalesce \" with\nthe spirit, thus accounting for the medium's being found in the\nhands of the grabber) ;\n(d) the alleged laws show an occasional\nsingular mutability (as where in general the phenomena bear the\nhuman eye but not white light, whereas in certain cases the pheno-\nmena can bear white light but not the human eye) ;\n(e) some alleged\npsychic laws affront common-sense (as that a mysterious substance\ncapable of overturning furniture and administering blows to experi-\nmenters may not be touched, apart from warning and directions as\nto time, place, and manner, with the tip of an investigator's finger\n\f115] Presidential Address 291\nlest it sufier damage) ; (\/) yet some particular friend of tlie suliject\nmay violate a psychic law (as by turning on a light without per-\nmission) and. no disaster such as others are warned against follow;\n{g) although for eighty years obedience to the psychic laws has been\nenjoined on the ground that infractions would endanger the subject's\nI health or even life, there are records of hundreds of infractions, even\nto the extent of purported spirits being violently seized by suspicious\nSpiritualists and a fight ensuing, and not one case of death is\ni recorded, nor is there in any case of indubitable evidence of damage,\ngiven by a calm observer, amounting to more than a nose-bleed or\na bruise inflicted in a fray : (4) it is very doubtful if some of the\nalleged laws relating to physical phenomena are valid, and there is\nas yet no certainty that any of them are.\n(5) If there are genuine physical phenomena, ectoplasm,\n! materialization of full or partial human forms and the like, it is of\ncourse very much to be desired that they should be proved as\nphysical entities, to the satisfaction of the most cautious. But, it\nis to be feared, this cannot be until investigation is freed from its\nbondage to mere dogmatic assertions which give no proof of their\nvalidity. That freedom, if achieved, must be won by the efforts of\npersons already convinced, for to no others will the subjects give\nheed. Let me suggest, in no unkindly spirit, to advocates that\nchiding those unconvinced by physical phenomena or certain types\nthereof, and ascribing to them a malevolent disposition, have never\nyet coiivinced any of them, and that it were far better, if they have\nmissed the truth, to clear away some of the obstructions on the path\nto it. By way of examples, I further suggest:\n[a) That they undertake to test the alleged psychic laws, as is\ndone in every other department of physical inquiry, rather than to\ntake them for granted. For instance, it might Vv^ell be, as is often\nalleged, that psychic structures cannot, any more than photographic\nplates, bear white light. But the photographer will dero.onstrate\nthis to your satisfaction, so here the parallel breaks. And the law\nin the case of photography is consistent and unvarying, whereas the\nalleged law on physical phenomena apparently breaks down in^\npresence of the fact that photographs, when the word is given, may\nbe taken of alleged materializations and ectoplasmic structures by a\nblinding flashlight, without any resultant disaster. It is time to test\nwhether a gentle beam of light directed by the experimenter at\nmoments when it would be of most advantage,[would really do harm\nto anything besides imposition.\nStudy should be given to the question why'certain allegedjpsychic\nlaws do not act with any uniformity, as^a scientist would certainly\ngive if he foiuid that in certain places the magnet does not attract\niron, and that in the laboratory of chemist A hydrochloric acid shows\n\f292 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part\nno affinity for lime as it lias shown in the laboratories of chemists\nB, C, and D. In short the whole matter of psychic laws supposed\nto govern physical phenomena should be carefully studied, with a\nview of the retention of those only which are of demonstrated\nvalidity, that investigation in this field may haply be brought nearer\nto parity with the field of mental phenomena, wherein, with all our\nbest subjects, investigation is carried on absolutely untrammelled\nby alleged psychic laws.\n(6) Advocates should cease to lend their assent to the dogma that\ninward doubt, or even disbelief on the part of an amiable and\nacquiescent investigator, has the effect of preventing phenomena.\nThis is the mere remnant of an old dogma, now discarded, that\nsuspicion, although based on observed facts, actually summons bad\nspirits to bring along with them deceptive paraphernalia. The\nremnant of the superstitious doctrine should be repudiated, especi-\nally as it has been thoroughly disproved. Phenomena are not\ninhibited by the presence of doubters and disbelievers whose identity\nis not known or whose doubt or disbelief is not known ;\nonly where\nthey or their suspicions are known is there sometimes an inhibitive\neffect, quite susceptible of a normal explanation.\n(f) Advocates should insist that when, in a given case, a pheno-\nmenon, whether by happy discovery or inadvertence, occurs in a\nstate of improved conditions, as in the daylight experimentation for\nthat phenomenon, investigation should continue under these con-\nditions which promise to lead to a speedy determination, and not\nrevert to worse ones imder excuse of a psychic law already violated\nwith impunity. Exactly this sort of thing has often taken place,\nexperimenters smothering their intelligence and acquiescing.\n{d) When there exists some simpler but surer instrument or means\nof testing a physical phenomenon than that in use, and one which\nmanifestly lays no greater burden upon the subject, advocates\nshould not tolerate refusal to allow its use, simply on the statement\nthat the \" Control \" does not want it, or at least should not maintain\nsilence in regard to the sinister appearance of such refusal.\n(e) Advocates should frown upon the doctrine which has foimd\nadherents in their ranks, that it is rather to be expected that physical\nmediums should sometimes practise fraud. No such doctrine\nattaches to mental mediums on whose residts we lay weight, and,\nalthough we do not make their bona fides a part of our evidence,\nsuch a doctrine would seriously handicap the credit of our reports.\nIt should be impressed iipon the consciousness of physical mediums,\nmade to sink into their subconscious, and enjoined on their alleged\nspirit controls, that any such instances of imposition must inevitably\naffect the credit of valid instances, suggesting that in them the\nimposition has merely been successful.\n\f116] Presidential Address 293\n(\/) Advocates should discoinitenance the all Init imiversal prac-\ntice of excluding from investigating groups persons whose conduct\nhas been unexceptionable, save that they have given expression to\ndoubt as to the validity of the phenomena. What would be thought\nof a parallel course pursued by a physicist who claimed to have\ndiscovered a revolutionary process or to have invented an apparatus\nrevealing a hitherto unknown property of matter ! What a method\nof convincing an honestly unconvinced man ! Is truth afraid, and\nmust it shield itself from the most searching inquisition ?\n[g) Advocates should resist any further encroachments upon the\nliberty of thought, as by a rule that statements of facts made by an\nexperimenter and recorded at the moment of observation shall be\nsacred against after-revision. Imiumerable instances have demon-\nstrated that a sitter may honestly make a declaration of fact and\nafterwards discover that the fact was quite otherwise.\nI It is to advocates, that is persons already convinced of physical\nphenomena, whether now present or who shall hereafter read these\nwords, that I venture to make these respectful sample suggestions,\nsince known advocates are in the most favourable position to give\nthe suggestions, or the approved among them, effect. If some in-\nvestigators have reached the goal of revolutionary truths in this\nquarter, it is by following the lines of such suggestions that the\ntruths can best be brought home to their less fortunate fellows.\nI trust that no one will read into the above rather lengthy passage\non the thorny subject of physical phenomena, any spirit or temper\nwhich was not present in the writing of it. After a former address\nbefore this Society, reporting the unsatisfactory results of a series\nof experiments, a gentleman referred to what he called my \" sar-\ncasm.\" I was appalled, and protested that I had studied to employ\nthe terms consistent with the facts least calculated to give offence,\nhad never used the word \" fraud \" in relation to the persons with\nwhom I had had unfortunate results, had employed euphemisms like\n\" normal causation.\" Here he interrupted me and said, \" That is\nwhat made it so funny.\" But what is a poor man to do ? And so\nI hope that nothing I have said has seemed like sarcasm or covert\nattack, but that I shall be visualized as bearing a very large olive\nbranch, and heard as expressing very real difficulties which I would\nfain see removed. For, I repeat, it is useless to disguise the fact\nthat physical phenomena can never be established in the minds of\nthinking men generally, until the shackles are taken off from in-\nvestigation, and experimenters are permitted, without hostile\ncriticism for so doing, to pursue their inquiries untrammelled either\nby dicta laid down in advance of an experiment, or prohibitions\nenjoined in the course of it. It will be said that for the investigators\nto arrange conditions will prevent phenomena. Very well, ex-\n\f294 Dr Walter Franldioi Prince [part\nperieuce will soon teach tliem what the necessary conditions are,\nwhereas dogmas can onlj^ prolong doubt. I quote the true words of\nSir Oliver Lodge, in his Presidential Address of 1902 :\n\" Full control\nmust be allowed to the observers\u2014a thing which conjurors never\nreally allow. I have never seen a silent and genuinely-controlled\nconjuror ; and in so far as mediums find it necessary to insist on\ntheir own conditions, so far they must be content to be treated as\nconjurors.\" 1 regret to add that, whatever the experience of others,\nI have had the good fortune but once to be present when investi-\ngators of mediimiistic physical phenomena were untrammelled\nthroughout, and that in this instance the results were entirely\ndisastrous to the claims advanced.\nAlleged Phenomena of Nondescript Character.\nBy \" nondescript \" is meant that the alleged phenomena do not\neasily classify as either mental or physical. I refer to such as the\nfollowing :\n1. Astrology, a complicated set of assumptions come down from\nremote antiquity as to the relations between movements, and loca-\ntions at given moments, of the heavenly bodies, on the one hand,\nand the characteristics of a person and the events of his life, on the\nother. Utterly devoid as it seems to be of any rationale, yet\npsychical research would be obliged to accept it, if the facts proved\ncompulsive. I myself, at the risk of appearing ridicialous even to\nmy colleagues, have for fourteen years held my archives open for\nastrological evidence, and have collected many exhibits of what was\noffered as evidence by supposed experts. In 1895 Mr F. W. H.\nMyers remarked \"I do not know on what evidence this belief is\nbased.\" In 1930 your speaker knows of no evidence which is not\nthe resixlt either of a forced application of the rules to human careers\nalready known, or of a careful culling of \"hits \" from preponder-\nating nimibers of \" misses.\" I do not think that any psychical\nresearcher in forty-eight years has given attention to the claims of\nastrology and has not definitely cast the pretended science on the\ndust heap.\n2. Palmistry, another set of irrational assumptions rooted in the\nhoary past, to the effect that a relation exists between the lines,\nprotuberances, etc., of a person's hand, and the characteristics and\nexperiences of that person. Like astrology, these assumptions are\nmore or less accepted to-day by many thousands in many lands.\nMr Myers in 1895 also said, in relation thereto, \" 1 have seen no\nevidence of any value.\" Nor is there, I believe, an investigator of\nstanding in the forty- eight years of psychical research, who has been,\nlike myself, quixotically good-natured enough to solicit evidence for\n\f115] Presidential Address 295\nclaims so absurd, and who has been more successful than Mr Myers,\nor who has failed to assign palmistry to the ash-pile.\n3. Numerology, a modern and protean species of Cabala, which\nholds that the letters of which a person's name is composed exert\na profound influence over his character and his course of life. Like\nI\nastrology, this has a department devoted to it in a number of occult\nperiodicals, and is advertised in many Spiritualist ones, hence must\nbe credited by a large number of credulous people. I do not\nI\nremember that any psychical researcher of whatever grade has ever\nsaid a word in its favour, nor do I believe that there is one who\ncould not, in one hour of application of its pretended principles,\nblast its claims.\nA query is in order. If, as some insinuate, there is no real\nevidence for the validity of phenomena which have convinced a\ngreat many of our investigators, and that what seems such is trans-\nfigured by the will-to-believe, then why has none of them accepted\nastrology, palmistry, or numerology, also I\nAnd a remark. Possibly psychical research has not done its full\nduty toward an undiscriminating section of the public, by the way\nof showing not only that these and other occult beliefs lack rational\nbasis, but also by the exhibition of tests proving that they do not\nwork out in practice.\nMental Phenoniena.\nFor nearly a half a century this Society (to confine our attention\nto it for the moment) has been trying out claims to the acquisition\nof knowledge by supernormal means, i.e. apart from the recognized\nsenses, more generally though apparently not always when the\nhuman subject is in a more or less dissociated state of mentality\n(abstraction, trance, dream), and with or without physical instru-\nmentalities, as a writing implement, a scrying ball, an unknown\nobject held in the hands, or a dowsing rod. There were not wanting\nat any time investigators who were ready to smash these claims as\nthose of astrology or palmistry. It was no doubt confidently ex-\npected by many onlookers that when such minds as became enlisted\ngot to work upon these problems there would be a speedy smashing\nof them all. That none of the types of claims which I have in mind\nhas been smashed is in itself a momentous fact. It is profoundly\nimpressive considering that neither darkness nor any other em-\nbarrassing condition is demanded by these mental phenomena, and\ninquirers are at liberty to employ every means of investigation that\ncommon-sense and science suggest.\nMore than this, there have been no scandals in connection with\nany of the cases of this description which the Society has published\n\f296 Dr Walter Franldin Prince [part\nas evidence, or with, any of the persons upon whose work they were\nbuilt, unless possibly once or twice in the first stage of telepathic\nexperiment. Not one of the dozen or more chief psychics whose\nnames are best remembered from your reports has ever been \"ex-\nposed,\" and, so far as I know, not one has ever been assailed by any\nattempted evidence of intentional deception. The same can be\nsaid of every medium for mental phenomena in America whose\nwork Dr Hyslop or his successor presented as evidence.\nStill further, so far are Ave from explaining away those asserted\ntypes of phenomena that we have brought some of them far on the\nway to factual establishment. Probably all of our workers are and\nhave for years been convinced that telepathy is a fact, although\none only rarely capable of brilliant demonstration. Some of these\nworkers have not personally dealt with certain types, as for instance,\npsychometry, and might be hesitant in regard to them, while those\nwho have had much experience Avith the same are generally agreed\nthat they present unassailable evidence of the supernormal. We\nare not all agreed in theory as to mediumistic deliverances, some\nholding that in them is found sufficient evidence for communication\nfrom the dead, while others think it better to explain by a very\ncomprehensive and agile telepathy. But it is hard indeed to find\na person who has really given long and patient attention to the\nstudy of mediumistic work of the highest class and who thinks that\nthe facts can be explained by normal knowledge or chance coinci-\ndence. The claims that some coincidences of thinking between two\nor more persons, some mediumistic \" commimications,\" some\ndreams, some ajiparitions and other hallucinatory impressions, some\npsychometry, some previsions and predictions, and even some\npeculiar mental phenomena associated with particular houses, con-\nstitute supernormal facts or involve supernormal factors, are not\nafter nearly half a century of organized research put to confusion\nlike astrology, which takes its place with divination by entrails or\nthe flight of birds, and do Jiot remain evidentially just where they\nwere in the beginning, a matter of dispute, like most physical\nphenomena, but are to-day on a far more solid evidential basis than\nthey were found, by the well-nigh unanim^ous verdict of experienced\npsychical researchers, who have dealt at length with them.\nIt is also profoimdly interesting to note that at least some of the\ntypes jiist mentioned have never been met by any theory which can\nexplain them in normal terms. Storms have indeed assailed them,\nbut they have been windstorms. Cases such as those reported by\nthis Society have not been met squarely and discussed fairly. I\nhave declared this again and again in print and named many hostile\nwriters and shown their methods of ciuibbling and evasion in detail.\nIt would be cruelty even to name again the learned American lady\n\f115] Presidential Address 297\nwhose ambitious attempt the late Dr G. iStaiiley Hall hoped would\nbe \"the turning of the tide.\" 8he touched nothing that she did\nnot mangle, and seemed incapable of making a correct abstract of\nany incident as long as half a page. She was demolished by the\ndeadly parallels of Dr Hyslop, the calm reconstructions of the facts\nby Mrs Sidgwick, and the irony of Andrew Lang. A friend of mine,\na psychologist, was for years visible to the public standing with\ndrawn sword before the threatened \" laws of nature,\" which he\napparently thought were all finally identified and labelled, but the\nonly attention he paid to any report of actual facts was to dance\nscornfully on some of its disjecta membra. For years I vainly\nendeavoured to induce some learned sceptic to attempt the explana-\ntion of one of our real cases, in its entirety, even if by a reasoned\ntheory that the investigators had been conspirators and romancers.\nThe only open opponent to promise such an attempt was furnished\nwith all the documents of the not lengthy case, and offered all\nfacilities for cross-examination, but unfortunately \" has not had\ntime \" in the eight years which have followed. The wiser doubters\nhave held their peace rather than betray their insufficient in-\nformation or to sin against intellectual conscience by malpractice\non records.\nMr Podmore stands quite apart from the writers referred to, in\nthat while he opposed several possible supernormals, he did so by\nrecourse of another supernormal, telepathy, attempting to merge\nthem all in this. However some of us may think that he pushed\nhis argument far beyond the warrant of his data, and became highly\nspeculative at the end, he was intimately acquainted with the data,\nand did really reason. The time has not come when we can afford\nin our studies to leave out of account the theory that in telepathy\nwe have the solvent of all mental psychic phenomena ; Podmore\nhas presented it with the greatest labour and ingenuity, and we owe\nhim grateful recognition for so doing. Misrepresentation of the\nfacts, whether deliberate or blundering, sarcasm (of which even\nHuxley was guilty) and dogmatic generalization, can do no good,\nbut any writer who conscientiously studies the facts and in terms\nof logic attempts their appraisal, or works out to the uttermost a\ntheory of the process by which they came into being, no matter\nwhat his verdict or his theory, confers a benefit upon psychical\nresearch.\nSumming up, the species of organized investigation which began\nin 1882, and which has spread to various parts of the world, stands\nfar in advance of where it was at that date. If a part of the\narea it was called upon to sm'vey proved to be desert, even to\nlearn that is a gain. If wider areas are still subject to earnest\ndebate, yet still other areas are by nearly all our experienced ex-\n\f298 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part\nplorers therein pronounced fertile land. At least in one respect they\nhave advanced beyond the mere affirmation that certain classes of\nphenomena demand supernormal explanations. They have reached\nthe point of affirming that instances of inmiediate sequences of\nthought as between human minds have been observed in such\nnumber and of sucli quality and under such conditions as to demon-\nstrate that thoughts can pass from one mind to another. This is\nproved in the same sense that hypnotism was proved a number of\ndecades before the proof was acknowledged as valid by the scientific\nworld in general. Telepathy will ultimately duplicate the later\nchapter of the history of hypnosis, by which the latter was defini-\ntively recognized. Psychical researchers have done much to help\nbring about those discoveries regarding the inner relations and\nmechanisms of the mind which have transformed psychology within\nthe memory of the living. To show that a mind ca.n form outer\nrelations, reach out to other minds other than by the mediation of\nthe known senses, is to accomplish another revolution, and to open\nup to possibilities of still further external relations to which no one\nis yet entitled to fix a limit. Although it is possible to confront the\nspiritistic hypothesis in cases where evidential material is received\nregarding deceased persons, by the telepathic hypothesis, on the\nother hand to prove telepathy tends better to establish the mind as\nan entity in itself and strengthens the foundation for the hypothesis\nof telepathic reception from minds disembodied.\nWhatever we have ascertained, as Newton said, a great ocean of\nundiscovered truth lies yet before us. Ours is a task not for years\nbut for centuries. We do not know, for instance, by what process\ntelepathy is accomplished. For that matter we are no nearer than\nNewton in understanding the koio of gravity, unless Einstein has\nshowed it, and even then it is said that only about a dozen men can\nunderstand it. We do not in the least know the process by which\ncertain astounding feats of psychometry were accomplished. There\nare problems on every hand. But physics, a science centuries old,\ncan say the same thing ;\nmany of its solutions to-day are not what\nthey were yesterday, and some will doubtless be changed to-morrow.\nThe magic word \" cryptesthesia \" helps us not at all ; we might as\nwell employ the symbol X, or, it may be, x, y and z.\nA few persons, popularly called mediums, when their normal\nconsciousness is more or less in abeyance, are able at times, in the\nform of purported commimications from the dead to produce com-\nplexes of correct or approximately correct factual statement, imder\nconditions which prohibit normal knowledge of them, and to a\nnumber and of a quality which make preposterous the notion that\nthey are the result of guessing or mere chance. The only two\ntheories which scientific procedure can take into account by way of\n\f115] Presidential Address 299\nexplanation are the Spiritistic and Telepathic. The concept of a\nCosmic Reservoir of all human thought since time began has no\nscientific standing whatever since it attaches itself to no known fact.\nAs well might we hypothesize that the psychic repeats what God\ntells her, or that thoughts hang to the walls of the room and thence\nfly to her brain.\nCertainly the Spiristic theory has the simplicity of the Copernican\nsystem, while the Telepathic theory has the complexity of the\nPtolemaic system. The former does not require us to believe that\nthe subconscious of mediums always plays a false part and the same\npart, while, granting telepathy between the living and if the dead\ndo survive, mediumistic results might well be telepathic seepings\nfrom discarnate consciousnesses, at times almost unmixed, at others\nmore or less mixed and obliterated with and by the medium's sub-\nconscious thoughts. On the other hand, the telepathic theory would\naccomit for nearly all examples of mediumistic material\u2014for I\nstrongly think that there are a few exceptions\u2014but only by positing\nthat the medium can filch both from the conscious and latent\nthoughts of the sitter, resurrect long forgotten knowledge and reach\nout to distant persons then busy and imaware of the experiment in\nprogress, and bring back facts to fill out the story ; at the same time\npresenting the cxirious problem why the exercise of telepathy should\nalways suggest to the medium's consciousness relations with the\ndead, when it never does so in our experiments for thought-\ntransference between the living.\nAllow me for convenience to employ the term telepath, for human\nsubjects of experimentation for telepathy between the living, and\nmediums for the human subjects of experimentation who purport\nto transmit the thoughts of persons who once lived in the flesh.\nWe need facts, facts and yet m^ore facts from and relating to both.\nNot facts simply as such, but facts with a difference, facts marked\nby some peculiarity, facts carrying, so to speak, a co-efficient. We\nneed to know much more definitely than we now do whether and\nto what extent sex, age, health, temperament, etc., affect the liability\nto telepathic faculty, whether and to what extent such particulars\nin combination between agent and percipient, as also relationship,\nfriendship, and similarity of tastes tend to affect results. We need\nto study the internal characteristics of reactions of telepaths to\nexperiment. We need to vary the conditions of experiments and\nthe nature of what we attempt in them. There ought to be a re-\nvival of interest in telepathic research, and first of all, necessarily,\nan earnest search for favourable subjects. A similar course of\nobservational and analytical inquiry should be made in the case of\nmediums on a wider scale than ever before, and the results on both\nsides compared.\n\f300 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part\nIf the evidential \" message \" of a mediiim is based upon thoughts\ntelepathically received from spirits, I think the facts favour the\nopinion that the spirits are capable of a better control of the process\non their side, have at times a better understanding of what is really\ngoing on, however much they may be impeded by obstacles in the\nmedium's mind, than is the case with telepaths. If so, there might\nwell be differentiating indicia which if carefidly observed and studied\ncould help us to come to theoretical agreement. There seems to be\ngood evidence that thoughts upon which the agent is at the moment\nconcentrating, sometimes pass to another mind. There are striking\nindications in the Doris Case, for example, that thoughts not at the\nmoment in the agent's upper consciousness, but which he had dwelt\nupon a few hours previously may also pass over (if it be not merely\na case of later emergence in the upper consciousness of the per-\ncipient). Whether facts not at the time of experimenting in con-\nsciousness, and not thought of for a long time, can pass over to a\npercipient, we have as yet little knowledge, or, if so, what law\ngoverns their selection. If it should sometime appear that in such\ncase facts which in the past we had pondered deejDly and emotionally\nhave the right of way, that it is the precipitate of our own reactions\nin the past to an event, rather than our pale recollection of what were\nthe reactions of another person to that event, which can get or is\nlikely to get expression in telepathy from our mind, we might have\nat command a gauge of great value. For undoubtedly many\nevidential purported commimications from deceased persons do\nappear to bear the stamp of their point of view, their original\nfocussing of attention in the past, and their emotional reactions,\nrather than our own. As I have stated in the book, Leonard and\nSoule Experiments, after a great many true statements had come\nrelating to my wife's last days on earth, it quite suddenly struck me\nthat these to a large degree did not reflect my most vivid and\npoignant memories of that last period but rather seemed to reflect\nthose particulars which loomed large in a sick mind which was kept\nignorant of distressing major facts and exaggerated the importance\nof trifles. And after, as reported in the same book, the story of\nStephen with its host of correct particulars had been finished, it\nstruck me as peculiar, on the theory that the facts had been tele-\npathically filched from my mind, that there was so little regarding\nthat stage which at the time affected me most profoundly and has\nsince remained so vividly in my memory, and that there was such\ndwelling upon the earlier stage at which I was not present, concern-\ning which I had so little information, but which was certainly for\nmy father charged with emotion at the time and must have remained\nvividly in his memory. When we know more about the laws which\ngovern telepathy between the living we can better estimate whether\n\f115] Presidential Address 301\nsuch appearances in mediumistic deliverances are, or are not,\nsignificant.\nWhen I spoke of the need to collect facts with a difference\n\u2014\nmarked by some peculiarity, I had in mind such an incident as I\ndiscussed on pages 103-5 of the Proceedings of the A.S.P.R. for\n1923. Here is the appearance as of one intelligence persistently\ntrying to get through a word beginning with B (\" Bossy,\" a calf), of\nanother intelligence (the sul)liminal of the medium ?) persistently\nthinking that a rabbit is meant and trying to set down the word\n\"bunny\" and being checked, the conflict continuing until the first\nintelligence scatters the fixed idea of the second by a device precisely\nlike one I employ when over the telephone. Someone persistently\nunderstands the name I give him as Pierce, and at last I, in despera-\ntion, say \" No, no. Prince, son of a king, Prince !\n\" I think that one\nreading the incident in its entirety could hardly avoid the conviction\nthat it is an authentic subconscious exhibit, and one which does not\neasily classify with what we know of telepathy between the living.\nElsewhere than in experimental telepathy and in mediumism,\nincidents which present imcommon features should be studied with\nspecial care. One such is where a woman in broad daylight had a\nhallucination of seeing the face of an old schoohimte ivitli a bandage\naround it, as formerly had been the case when she suffered from a\ntoothache, and then the face changed to that of a certain Frank ,\nlikewise bandaged. Later her husband, a commercial traveller, re-\nturned from a trip, reported that he had been imexpectedly called\nto a certain town, and while there attended the funeral of Frank,\nand said \" I don't know what was the matter but his face was tied\nup in a cloth.\" Here was a mental mechanism eloquent with\nmeaning, even though it is yet uncertain what that meaning is.\nAnother incident is that of the man who at a moment of peril saw\nthe apparition of his father on the deck beside him, while his sister,\nfour thousand miles away, at about the same time, saw an appari-\ntion of him and likewise the ap-parition that he saw. Both incidents\ncontain unusual features, and it is such differentiating features\nwhich, when multiplied in number and variety, may prove very\nposts to guide our way.\nConcluding Reflections.\nWhether one is a great scientist or only, to employ the language\nof Professor Sidgwick, one who means to be as scientific as he can,\nhe is irresistibly urged to step across the line which separates\nscience from philosophy and choose between the opposing concepts\nas to what factors constitute the imiverse. Some persons naively\nsuppose that materialism is peculiarly scientific, whereas of course\n\f302 Dr Walter FranJdin Prince [part\nit is a philosophical theory, exactly as is idealism or vitalism. One\nmust choose, else his scientific thinking at last becomes confused.\nHaeckel chose materialism, and shaped his scientific theories accord-\ningly. Huxley and Tyndall, although I learn with surprise that\nmany regard them as very high-priests of materialism, were unable\nso to choose. Huxley said that either from the hardness of his head\nor his heart he could not identify mind with either matter or force,\nas science understands force. Tyndall speculated on the possibility\nthat all matter has a mental side. It seems a strange moment, now,\nwhen science is pursuing matter behind the curtain which is the aspect\nthat it presents to our senses, and finding its essence in the invisible,\nfor mind which has accomplished this feat to deny its own sovereign\nentity. The mind can direct the very forces of nature. No more\nwork need be performed by the brain in blowing up an ammunition\ndepot and destroying a thousand lives than in setting the match to\nthe task of lighting a cigarette. In every generation myriads of\nminds leap into fuller vigour and seek new adventures sheerly\nthrough thoughts that originated in the brain of a Plato, a Shake-\nspeare, a Darwin, or some other thinker who uttered them yesterday,\na century or a millennium ago. Surely the retina is indifferent to\nwhat characters lie on the printed x^age ;\nonly in the thoughts them-\nselves do we find the efficient cause. I do not wonder that Wundt\nin the ripened period of his life looked back upon that earlier one\nwhen he pronounced psychology a branch or department of phy-\nsiology, with a sort of shame, and called it the season when he\nsowed his wild oats. Probably the most of us here are impelled by\nthe sum-total of our studies to take a stand with Wundt and tluxley\nand Carpenter and Ladd.\nVery well, then : as physicists are studying a multitude of effects\nwhich are shaping their views on the nature of matter, from the\ncentre of the so-called atom to the farthest range of the visible stars,\nso psychical researchers are studying cert^ain effects to determine\nwhether or not they indicate that which is not set down in the text\nbooks regarding the inmost powers and the external relations of the\nmind of man.\nIt would not surprise me if science should some time be led to\nregard that instinct, so to speak, by which every race of man from\nthe lowest to the highest stage of development, entertains religioiis\nideas, the one imifying element in which is the apprehension of\ninvisible spiritual energy with which human beings are in some sort\nof contact, whether b)^ virtue of gods or God, devils or beneficent\ndaemons, or the spirits of deceased men, as a scientific datum, even\nas it does gravity now. Anthropologists, as they com^e better to\nknow the most primitive tribes, are gradually relinquishing the\nopinion that there is any quite withoiit it. Individuals or groups\n\f115] Presidential Address 303\nmay cultivate insensibility to this integral trend, but like circus\nperformers wlio learn to walk on tbeir bands, tbey perish and leave\nno dynastic successors. Science may not take into account the\ninterpretations which constitute the various religions, but it may\nhave to take into account the central fact out of which the inter-\npretations, so various, grow. But that time is not yet ; we are now\nscientifically limited to empirical observation of facts, and to attempt\nat their proper time to weave together the facts into a connected\nscheme.\nIn a recent magazine article, a blind deaf mute has told how she\nwas taught the sign language. Speaking of the beginning of the\nprocess she says :\n\" The doings of this teacher were certainly strange\nto me at this time, especially the way she kept wiggling her fingers\nin the palm of my hand. . . . The queer, meaningless way she\ninsisted on wiggling her fingers.\" If we are spiritual entities, it is\ncertainly within the range of theoretical possibility that there are\nother spiritual entities as viewless to our senses as our own real\nselves are, and existing in other relations than ours. And it may\nbe that many of the odd occurrences which occasionally take place,\nwhich we cannot classify with the mass of our experiences, and\nwhich we puzzle over, are, as it were, a wiggling of fingers in the\npalms of our hands, to make us beings of imperfect senses under-\nstand that external intelligence is trying to reach us.\nIf that view finally prevails and the fact of occasionally demon-\nstratable telepathy from another sphere of being comes to be\ngenerally accepted, I think it fortimate that this supreme result of\npsychical research is likely to be reached only by slow steps and the\ngradual accumulation of evidence.\nOtherwise I should fear another wave of indiscriminating credulity\nsuch as swept over parts of the United States in the latter half of\nthe nineteenth century, and carried thousands of bright men and\nwomen from their moorings of common-sense, followed by a re-\naction and the flats of incredulity in which most of their children\nand grandchildren live to-day. Electricity, one of the most useful\nservants of mankind, is terribly destructive when uncontrolled.\nPopular self-government is a good thing, but there are peoples which,\nif too suddenly it were achieved, would plunge into anarchy and\nmisery. There are truths which are dangerous if received too soon\nor too suddenly. So there is an ancient text which says : \"I have\nyet many things to say mito you, but ye cannot bear them now.\"\nIf by some accident the radio could have come into existence a\nthousand years ago, without the long course of discovery and\ninvention which prepared the way for it, it would have made the\nworld half mad. I think I see which way the finger is pointing in\npsychical research, but before any such general agreement as I have\n\f304 Dr Walter Franldin Prince [part us]\nmentioned, even in the ranks of this Society, mucli preparatory work\nis needed. All superstitions and every species of human imposition\nwhich has invaded our field must be banished, discrimination and\nmoderation of exj^ectation must be taught, it must become fully\nunderstood that if there are rifts in the separating curtain it does\nnot mean that the curtain is to be torn fully away, and that most\npeople will still have to take the facts on authority like the early\nChristians who did not themselves see the apparition of Jesus.\nSo thinking, 1 quote, quite calmly, the words of William James.\n\" The facts are evidently complicated in the extreme, and we have\nas yet hardly scratched the surface of them. . . . These earlier\nobservations of ours will surely be interpreted one day in the light\nof future discoveries which it may well take a century to make. . . .\nWhat we need is more and more observations.\"\nWhatever the final issue, I refuse to believe that facts, however\nsome of them may elude the conditions of the laboratory, but which\ndo nevertheless perennially repeat themselves and force themselves\nupon observation, will forever be denied recognition. I have too\nmuch respect for human intellect to credit that there exists any\ncategory of observable facts concerning which it will remain per-\npetually in doubt. Their actuality and something of their workings\nand their significance\u2014and in no department of inquiry can we say\nmore\u2014will at length be acknowledged.\n\f\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 116\nOCTOBER, 1930\nARTHUR JAIIES, EARL OF BALFOUR.\nLord Balfour was a ]\\Iem.ber and Vice-President of\nthe Society for forty-eight years, and President in\n1893.

H. Salter.\nThis report consists of a number of incidents from trance sittings\nwith Mrs Leonard which appear likely to be of interest to students\nof the modus operandi of such phenomena. One point upon which\nsome of these incidents have a bearing is as to the form in which\nthe knowledge shown by the entranced medium presents itself to\nher consciousness, whether the language of the sensory images\nwhich the control, Feda, habitually employs, is really appropriate.\nAnother point to consider is the way in which knowledge derived\nfrom various sources, of which direct thought-transference from the\nsitter may be one, but cannot be the only one, seems to be blended\ninto a consecution of ideas appropriate to the supposed commimi-\ncator. This phenomenon, which is not uncommon at good sittings,\nis obviously, and on any hypothesis, of psychological interest and\nimportance. Thirdly, there is the question whether the time at\nwhich some piece of supernormal knowledge was acquired can be\ndetermined. I have quoted two book tests in which it would seem\nthat the knowledge shown by Feda was obtained either during, or\nvery shortly before the sitting.\nSome of the incidents I am about to relate are taken from my own\nsittings with Mrs Leonard, of which I have now had a considerable\nnumber, and some from sittings taken by other Members of the\nSociety who have sent us their records.\nAs to my own sittings\u2014the purporting commimicators are my\nparents, Dr and IVIrs A. W. Verrall, and during a part of the sitting\nmy father, to whom in his character of communicator I shall refer\nby his initials, as A. W. V., frequently purports to control Mrs\nLeonard himself. My father died in 1912, my mother in 1916 ;\nmy\nfirst sitting was in January 1917, and I went to Mrs Leonard anony-\nmously. After my fourth sitting it became impossible to conceal\nmy identity, as the Society was carrying out a series of experimental\nA considerable part of this paper was read at a Private Meeting of the\nSociety on 9 January 1929.\n306\n\fIncidents Occurring at Sittings ivitli Mrs Leonard 307\nsittings with Mrs Leonard, for the organisation of which I was\nmainly responsible. I do not, however, in my own case attach\nmuch importance to this question of anonymity, because nearly all\nthe interesting matter I have received at these sittings has been of\nsuch a kind that knowledge of my identity would have availed Mrs\nLeonard hardly at all towards obtaining the required information\nfrom normal sources. It is noticeable that in all the sittings I have\nhad with her she has never once proffered the least scrap of informa-\ntion of the sort easily obtainable in my father's case from books of\nreference or in other obvious ways.\n1. Concerning knowledge apparently derived from sensory impressions.\nThe first point I propose to discuss is the form in which the\nvarious impressions registered at a sitting present themselves to\nwhatever entity is purporting to control Mrs Leonard at the time.\nAccording to Feda her perceptions are definitely sensory ; she uses\nsuch expressions as \"he's building up,\" \" he's showing me so-and-\nso\n'\"\n;\nor, addressing the commmiicator, \" say it again, Feda can't\nhear,\" and so forth. But careful observation of IVbs Leonard's\nphenomena has clearly shown that these statements are not always\nto be taken at their face value. Lady Troubridge has called atten-\ntion to this question in a paper on \" The Modus Operandi in Medium-\nistic Trance,\" published in Vol. xxxii of our Proceedings. She\nwrites (p. 369) :\n\" There are certain aspects of the Feda phenomena\nwhich leave me very doubtful as to whether these simple sensory\nterms convey any accurate analogy with the process really involved.\"\nShe goes on to report an occasion when Feda described \" to Miss\nRadclyfie-Hall with great accuracy and great detail a portrait of\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall.\" But Feda, who according to her own state-\nment \" sees this picture and is able to describe it at such length,\nnever apparently grasps the fact that the picture being described\nby her is a portrait, and a striking resemblance at that, of the very\nfamiliar sitter to whom she is speaking.\"\nThe same difficulty is dealt with by Mr Drayton Thomas, a\nregular and long-established sitter with Mrs Leonard, in his paper\nin our Proceedings (xxxviii. 49-100), and it has been clearly stated\nby his communicators on various occasions that Feda's own opinion\nas to how impressions reach her cannot always be taken as\naccurate. For instance (p. 54) :\n\" If I then project a thought of\nsome concrete object, Feda may remark, '\nI see so-and-so,' but\nthough she may seem to be seeing the object, it is really my thought\nof it that has reached her.\" And again (p. 56) :\n\" For example,\nshe will say '\nI hear the name Lily '\nwhen actually a lily has been\npictured to her, or the idea of a lily impressed on her mind. She\n\f308 Mrs W. H. Salter [PAET\nsays '\nhear '\nbecause she has given herself the suggestion of hearing\nand fails to realise that she has not actually heard it. Expecting to\nperceive ideas as soimd, she thinks they come that way, even when\nthey are coming by sight.\"\nI will now quote from my own sittings some passages which seem\nto show clearly that an impression represented by Feda as visual\nwas reaching her fragmentarily in some other way. At the first\nsitting I had with Mrs Leonard on 29 January 1917, after some quite\nappropriate talk which I interpreted as referring to my mother,.\nFeda said :\n\" There's a gentleman with her with a beard, not a\nvery big beard, shortish at the sides, longer in front. He wants to\nlet you know they're together. He's a nice-looking man, he's smil-\ning all over his face.\" Almost immediately after this the sitting\ncame to an end.\nThe important point to note here is that the man said to be with\nmy mother, afterwards identified with my father, is described as\nhaving a beard. My father did in fact v^ear a beard from early\nmanhood to the end of his life.\nAt my third sitting, on 29 May 1917, after remarks which again\nseemed to refer to my mother, Feda said :\n\" She's got a gentleman\nwith her, a bit thin, a bit of a cough. His nose comes out, it's bent\ndown a little, it's a bit thin at the sides. The bone shows a bit.\nHe's been good-looking. The eyebrows are brown, a little arched,\nthe hair brown, the temples bare, have a bony look.\" Then after\nsome quite appropriate remarks as to the man described having\nbeen in bad health for some time before he died \" not able to get\nabout,\" Feda gave the letter \" H or A \" and then the name\n\" Arthur,\" my father's first name.\nThe above description is, as far as it goes, quite a good description\nof my father as he was before his hair went gi'ey. Although there is\nno mention of a beard this time, nothing is said which is inconsistent\nwith his having had one. At my next sitting, on 15 November 1917,\nafter some further references to \"Mr Arthm-,\" I asked Feda if he\ncould \" build up.'' She said : He's altered a bit, got yoimger-\nlooking, more towards the middle of life, hardly that. He's got\ngood features. The nose shows the bridge. It's narrow above,\nround at the tip. It broadens a bit below. The mouth is a bit\nlarge, the lips are pink, not red. The chin is more roimded. The\nface is not quite oval. It's too broad to be oval, but it's not roimd.\nThe eyebrows are bro'wn, straight, going out a little at the corners.\nThe eyes are not prominent, the hair brovv^nish, shows the temples.\nThe forehead is good, a fine shape, an open, clever look. People\nwould say that was the finest part of the face. The bumps on the\ntemples stand out a little. There's a rather straight line between the\nnose and forehead. The hair is a bit longer on the top. He brushes\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings ivith Mrs Leonard 309\nit away from the face. There's a photograph, an old-fashioned one\nin a low collar, a bit of hair coming forward.\"\nNow this description, in which the communicator's face is ap-\nparently viewed sometimes from the front, sometimes in profile\n(see e.g. \" there's a rather straight line between the nose and fore-\nhead \"), is on the whole distinctly good, but it contains details\nwhich seem to imply that the man described is beardless, the size\nand colour of the mouth, the shape of the chin. It is impossible to\nsuppose that any one who was describing in detail a man visibly\npresent could be mistaken as to whether or no he had a beard.\nAgainst the interpretation that Feda is seeing my father as a quite\nyoimg man, clean-shaven, is first her own statement that he is\n\" towards the middle of life, hardly that,\" and secondly the fact\nthat at the sitting of 29 January 1917 the man afterwards identified\nwith my father is said to be bearded. My otvti interpretation of what\noccurred is that Feda was not really seeing \" anything, but that\non this, as on other occasions, she was receiving a series of mental\nimpressions which she translated into visual terms. Her statements\nthat my father had a rather large mouth and a face not roimded but\ntoo broad to be oval, are in fact correct, as early photographs show.\nTwo years later, on 8 November 1919, when A. W. V. was pur-\nporting to control Mrs Leonard himself without the intervention of\nFeda, what seems to be an allusion to this mistake of hers was made\nspontaneously :\n\" A mistake of Feda's, a great mistake. (Touches\nside of face, a little below the cheekbone.) I can\"t \"understand how\nshe managed to make such a mistake without correcting it after ;\nit's a most strange thing. It's a good thing I'm able to correct these\nlittle things myself. Yet it has a very good point in a way, it cer-\ntainly does not suggest that the medium has any Imowledge of me,\nbecause if the medium had any knowledge of me whatever, such a\nmistake would have been impossible.''\nIt is of course true that if Sirs Leonard had ever seen a photo-\ngraph of my father or had heard his appearance described, she\nwould have been most imlikely to describe him herself as beardless.\nThe incident is also an example, of which many others could be\nfound, of the powers of memory shown in these trance-phenomena.\nBetween the original statement and the correction of it, all but\ntwo years elapsed, during which Mrs Leonard had sat with a great\nnumber of other sitters and had presumably given some himdreds\nof descriptions of supposed communicators and their friends. One\nmight have thought that all recollection of the incident of\n15|November 1917 would have been obliterated from her mind. But\nsomething, or somebody, seems to have remembered that a descrip-\ntion had been given, which in one particular was wrong, and when\nopportunity occurred, to have made the necessary correction.\n\f310 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nBetween November 1917 and November 1919 I had had six sittings\nwith Mrs Leonard myself. A. W. V. took control himself for the\nfirst time on 24 October 1919, and again on 25 October 1919 ; on\nneither of these occasions did he make any reference to his own\npersonal appearance.\nI now quote from my first sitting with Mrs Leonard, 29 January\n1917, some statements made concerning a communicator sub-\nsequently said to be my mother. Many of these statements, as\nwill be seen from my notes, given below, are true ;\nthey contain,\nhowever, an admixture of such errors as could hardly have arisen\nhad Feda's knowledge been derived from any clearly apprehended\nimage or series of images. Her words, though for the most part\nthey jjurport to describe something seen, suggest to my mind a\nnumber of rather disjointed mental impressions, patched together\nand occasionally eked out by a little guesswork.\nExtract from sitting of\nFeda. There's an elderly lady\nwith you, medium height, lost\nher figure which made her look\nbroader, rounded cheeks but a\nlittle sunk, the chin a little\nfallen away, the mouth not full,\nthe lips not red, a little drawn\ndown, the nose rather straight,\nthe eyebrows brown, slightly\narched, the eyes blue grey. The\nhair has been brown, getting\ngrey, the hair is done close back,\ntwisted up.\nThis lady was not well before\nshe passed out ; she was not\nwell for two or three years, not\nan invalid. Feda thinks she had\nan internal weakness for some\nyears ; she didn\"t know, but it\ncaused her passing on. The\ndoctor would tell you she had it\nfor some time. About two years\nbefore she began to feel ill, but\nshe kept it to herself. At the\nend she got suddenly weak. To-\nwards the end she got tired of\nher physical body. . . .\n29 Janv.anj 1917.\nMy mother v^as fifty- eight\nwhen she died ; she was of\nmedium height, her figure a\nlittle broad in later life, but not\nat all stout. The description of\nher features is correct except\nthat her eyebrows were decidedly\narched (though so lightly marked\nas to be barely visible) and her\neyes were distinctly blue, a con-\nspicuous feature in her face.\nThe statements about the hair\nare true.\nAll the statements about my\nmother's last illness are true.\nShe died of abdominal cancer,\nwhich according to the doctor\nmust have begun some three or\nfour years before her death.\n\\\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings with Mrs Leonard 311\nShe was used to doing things\nherself, she didn't like not doing\nthem. She used to do things\nwith her fingers a good deal, it\nsoothed her. (Motion of sewing\nor knitting.)\nYou've got a photograph of\nher, it shows the top part, almost\nfull face. It's not very nice of\nher. She looked serious in it,\nthoughtful, but when she smiles\nshe looks quite different. Her\nface got a little haggard before\nshe passed on. She got so tired-\nlooking round the mouth. Her\ncheeks are more filled out now.\nHer hair was a pretty brown one\ntime, a warm brown. She looks\nmuch yomiger now. That photo\ndoesn't do her justice.

There's a\npiece of furniture at one side.\nOne arm is stuck out more than\nthe other, on the side of the fur-\nniture. She's got a dark dress\non, a black, Feda thinks. She\ndidn't like low necks. She's got\na band round the throat, a little\nwhite band at the top. She's\nf got a bodice, not a blouse, a\nmade bodice, fastened in front,\nwith little folds, pleats at the\nside. There are bands round the\nwrist. She's got an oval brooch\nMy mother did a good deal of\ncrochet-work during the last\nyear of her life.\nI have a photograph of my\nmother which is an enlargement\nfrom a snapshot I took myself\nabout two years before her\ndeath. References to enlarge-\nments of photographs are, how-\never, so common at sittings with\nMrs Leonard and other mediums\nthat little evidential value can\nbe attached to this point. The\nfollowing statements are correct\nin relation to this photograph\nof my mother : she is looking\nserious and thoii htful, the\nphotograph shows \" the top part,\nalmost full face,\" my mother is\nsitting slightly sideways, she has\na black dress on with a white\nband at the throat. It is not\ntrue that there is a piece of\nfm'niture at one side, that one\narm \" is stuck out more than\nthe other,\" that my mother is\nwearing \" a made bodice,\" \" not\na blouse,\" that \" there are bands\nround the wrist.\" My mother\nis wearing a black coat, not un-\nIQve a bodice but open in front,\nshowing a white silk shirt. There\nare no \" bands at the wrists,\"\nwhich are not visible at all in the\nphot^Q-raph, nor is there any\n\" oval brooch with a gold rim.\"\nMy mother possessed such a\nbrooch, but so, I imagine, did\nmost people of her generation.\nThe most distinctive feature of\nthe photograph, that my mother\nis reading a large book held\n\f312 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nwith a gold rim, not quite oval, open on her knees, is not noted\nrather old-fashioned. The out- at all.\nside is like a rim. There's some-\nthing different in the middle.\nThe general inference which I should draw from the above extract\nis that a certain amount of veridical information about my mother\nwas woven by Feda into an imaginary picture of an elderly widow,\nbased on preconceived ideas of the appearance such a picture might\nbe expected to present. The \" bands at the wrist are presumably\nwidow's bands, which my mother never wore. She was, in fact, a\nwidow at the time the photograph was taken.\nI now give a group of extracts from my sittings, showing various\nattempts, finally successful, to give my mother's maiden name,\nMerrifield.

There is\npossibly a reference to that here.\nThe first years of our married\nlife VN'ere passed in the foothills\nof the Rocky Mountains.

At that\ntime I always on the morning before a sitting made a point of never\nlooking at a newspaper, being desirous of concentrating all my\nattention on the coming sitting. ... Of course I may have suh-\nconsdously taken in the allusion, though I do not think so, as my\ntendency was rather to avoid even a glance in the direction of a\nnewspaper that might be in the room. I searched several news-\npapers on Oct. 7th (Simday) for a picture of anj^hing rocky that\nmight seem to fit in with the commmiication, but without success.\nI was exceedingly surprised to come upon a picture of the Rocky\nMountains in the Daily Express of Oct. 8th, having given up all\nexpectation of finding anything v\u00bb^hich might seem to coincide with\nthe communicator's remarks.''\nMrs Leonard informs me that the daily papers she was taking in\nOctober 1928 were the Daily Mail and the Daily Herald. There is\nno reason therefore to suppose that she had seen the annoimcement\nin the Daily Express at the time of Mr Graham's sitting. Nor, so\nfar as is ascertainable, had she any normal knowledge of his personal\nassociation with the Rocky Mountains.\nI will now quote a further extract from Mr Graham's sitting of\n6 October 1928 in which a scent-bottle was described which had\nbelonged to the commmiicator. There was another allusion to\nthe matter at a later sitting on 14 January 1929 (see below).\nConcernuag this scent-bottle Mr Graham writes :\n\" I was unable to\nidentify the object described at the time of either sitting. After the\nfirst sitting I asked my wife's two sisters if either had a scent-bottle\nof hers. One of them had none, the other a single bottle, which,\nhowever, had never contained scent, and did not in the least\ncorrespond to the article described, and finally I gave this latter\nup as unidentifiable.\n\" In J uly 1929 I was inspecting at a furniture storage some things of\nmine which I had not seen for three years, and there noticed a scent-\nbottle which struck me as being possibly the object referred to at the\nsittings. It was forwarded tome fromthestore in October 1929, and in\nsome important respects it seems to correspond with the description.\"\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings with Mrs Leonard 317\nExtract from sitting of 6 October 1928.\nFeda.

But\nyou still have something that There was about a quarter of\nwas strongly scented, and still an inch of scent remaining in it.\nhas the scent in it. It is about\nthe only thing that you have It is the only thing,\nthat is scented, aromatic.\nThe points as to which Feda shows a correct apprehension in\nthese two sittings are as follows :\n(1) It is true that the communicator had a scent-bottle which\nshe valued during her life and that this bottle is still in existence,\nbut not in use.\n(2) The metal top of this bottle is accurately described in con-\nsiderable detail.\nOn the other hand, at the sitting of 6 October 1928 no knowledge\nis shown of the fact that the body of the scent-bottle is of glass,\nand at both sittings the bottle is incorrectly described as very small.\n(Feda's words rather suggest a bottle of smelling-salts.) Feda does\nnot anywhere definitely state that she is seemg the bottle, but the\nwords \" when she undid one she seems to be doing something more\nto the top \" suggest a visual image of the commimicator holding the\nbottle. But when we take into account the complete misapprehen-\nsion as to the size of the bottle, it seems clear that we have again to\ndo with a series of disjointed impressions (some of them, e.g. the\nimpression of pattern on the metal top, perhaps visual) which Feda\npieces together and ekes out with some purely subjective additions.\n.\n3. Impressions derived from some person presefit at the sitting.\nVarious writers on Mrs Leonard's phenomena have called atten-\ntion to the fact that according to statements made by the com-\nmunicators a particular line of communication may be facilitated\nby the fact that a certain word, or a certain tram of thought, had\nbeen recently in the mind of some person present at the sitting. I\n\f320 3Irs W. H. Salter [part\nhave noticed several incidents in my own sittings which confirm\nthese statements, and I think that this tendency to draw upon the\nmind of the sitter or of the medium may occasionally lead to con-\nfusion or irrelevance, because it may be that Feda herself does not\nalways know the source of her impressions and ideas which have\nbeen accidentally gleaned from some living mind, ideas which are\n\" in the air,\" so to speak, may be wrongly associated with the com-\nmmiicator. I will give from my own sittings two examples of what\nI mean.\nAt a sitting on 8 November 1919, when A. W. V. was purporting\nto control the medium himself, after what I interpreted at the time\nas a reference to the fact of his having worn woollen cuffs in winter\nto keep his wrists warm, he went on : \"I don't think you'll xmder-\nstand what I am going to say now, but it isn't given to many men\nto wear two pairs of trousers (said with a laugh). Well, I did once,\nI think you'll remember. Your mother remembers it well, you\nknew about it too.\"\njSTow, although I cannot of course assert positively that my father\nnever at any time of his life wore two pairs of trousers, I can say\nthat I have no recollection of ever hearing such an incident reported.\nBut what interested me in the allusion was the fact that I had\nspent the evening before the sitting at the house of the friend who\nwas taking notes for me, and in her and my presence another friend\nhad related an incident in her own experience when a man had worn\nseveral pairs of trousers. I was at once reminded of this story by\nwhat A. W. V. said.\nAgain, at a sitting on 1 November 1921, just as Feda was relin-\nquishiug her hold upon the medium in order that A. \\V. V. might\nassume control, she ejaculated without any comment or explanation\nthe name Sylvester. Subsequently A. W. V. referred to the name\nhimself, thus :\nA. W. V. Do you remember Feda saying Sylvester ?\nH. S. Yes.\nA. W. V. She got that from me. I suddenly thought of Sylvester.\nIt's the name of some one I knew, some one not on the earth, over\nhere with me. I wonder if you know you've reminded me of this\nyourself, you've made it easy for me to say the name. Often I can\nsay a name if you've thought about it lately.\nNow, in this case as in the preceding one, Ifcannot assert that my\nfather never knew a man called Sylvester,^ but I am not myself\n1 Mrs Sidgwick and Dr C. D. Broad have both suggested to me that my\nfather is likely to have had some acquaintance with the well-known mathe-\nmatician Professor J. J. Sylvester (St. John's College, Cambridge). Sylvester\nwas associated in his work with Cayley, whom my father certainly knew ;\nhe died in 1897.\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings luith Mrs Leonard 321\naware of his having any close personal associations with that name.\nOn the other hand I can perfectly well understand the assertion\nthat I have made it easy for him to get the name by having it lately\nin my thoughts. My husband and I had recently sold our London\nhouse to an old acquaintance of my husband's family, Mrs Sylvester\nHorne, and I had received a letter concerning this sale only a short\ntime before the sitting.\n4. Three book-tests.\n(a)\nI propose now to quote, again from my own sittings, a book-test,\ntogether with the context in which it was given. The incident is of\ninterest for two reasons : (1) the time at which knowledge was\nprobably obtained of the book seems to be definable within narrow\nlimits ; (2) the book-test and the context on either side are closely\nlinked together by a consecution of ideas natural to the ostensible\ncommunicator, that is, my father. The sitting in question took\nplace on 4 October 1921, and I acted on this occasion as my own\nnotetaker.\nFeda. He says he's met an old friend lately.\nH. S. Yes?\nF. But he means a man, not a lady ; some one who's passed\nover recently, and he's quite an elderly man.\nStroke down and a piece on (draws P). It seems connected with\nhim, but as if this gentleman's interests, some important ones,\nwould be right away from here, from London and where you live\nnow. It's as if he had lived a good deal away from here. Now he's\ngiving a B connected with him, it's a place, a rather important\nplace coimected with him.\nH. S. I think I know who this is, Feda.\nF. He had been what J\\Ir Ajthur calls an active man, but he'd\nnot been well for a good while before he passed over. But Mr\nArthur says he doesn't think up to a very little while before he\npassed over that he was expecting to go just then. He said he\nseemed rather surprised to find himself on the other side, and also\nhe had started, not exactly started, but attached himself to some\nrather important work that he apparently intended seeing through.\nThis was not connected with his native place, or the place he actually\nlived in. [There followed an allusion to a hospital, in which the\nman in question was said to be interested.]\nAt home, IVIrs Nelly, you ought to have things that would connect\nhim with Mr Arthur. Get a feeling of^writing about him. You've\ngot a book with his name in.\nF\n\f322 3Irs W. H. Salter [part\nH. S. Yes ?\nF. Mr Arthur seems quite positive of that. One or two things\nyou should have that would connect him with Mr Arthur. Do you\nknow that they were spoken of together, linked up in a book ? Mr\nArthur's not sure if you see what he means by that at the minute ;\nbut as if this gentleman had done things that Mr Arthur would be\nlinked up with. He keeps saying a book which links them iip.\nYou've got the book.\nH. S. I'll look.\nF. He knows what the book looks like. It's so dark, the binding,\nit looks black to Feda. It's a pretty thick book, about that thick\n(indicates about 1| inches). And I should think it's a bigger book\naltogether than the books about dukes and earls she [Mrs Leonard]\nreads and thinks she'd like to write, a bigger book altogether. The\npaper is not very smooth shiny paper, rather good quality, a little\nbit rough. Is it letters in it, like printed letters ? No, extracts\nfrom what different people have said. There's some extracts in it\nof what different people had said. Like somebody writing a letter\nand then printing pieces of it. That seems to be in this book.\n[Then followed the book-test which will be discussed presently.]\nHe wants to say this friend of his and he will be doing some work\ntogether, and Mr. Arthur was very pleased to meet him. Do you\nknow a name J that should be linked up with him ?\nH. S. Yes.\nF. I keep getting a big J. What's that ? Page, not in a book, a\nname. Sounds like Page. He doesn't mean a page in a book, he\nmeans a name. He seems to think that talking about this spirit\nthat's passed over should remind you of Page.\nAnother name beginning with J, not the one he mentioned before,\nlike Joyce-lin, Joyce and N at the end. Some one Mr Arthur knew\nwell here and who's also on the other side. He would be a link up\nwith the one who's passed recently.\nThe \" old friend \" I identified at the sitting as Professor Henry\nJackson, who had died in the latter part of September. My father\nwas associated with Henry Jackson during the whole of his life at\nCambridge, a period of over forty years. Both men were classical\nscholars, both were Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, and for\nmany years members of the College staff. It is true of Jackson that\nhe was \" quite an elderly man \" (he was indeed an old man, over\neighty when he died). Although his health had been failing for\nsome years, he was at work until a short time before his death.\nOf the three letters given by Feda, J is the first letter of his own\nname ; P might well stand either for philosophy or for Plato\n(Jackson was for many years famoiis as a teacher of Greek philo-\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings with Mrs Leonard 323\nsophy, and Ms lectures on Plato and Aristotle were familiar to many\ngenerations of Cambridge scholars) ;\nB, \" a rather important place\nconnected with him,\"' I should suppose to be Bournemouth, where\nhis wife and family resided for many years and where Jackson\nhimself spent his vacations. But this habit of giving single letters\nwithout any clear indication of the matter to which they are in-\ntended to refer, I consider an imsatisfactory feature of mediumistic\nsittings ; it leaves too much to conjecture. As to the statement\nthat he had started or \" attached himself to some rather impor-\ntant work that he had apparently intended seeing through,\" \" not\nconnected with his native place or the place he actually lived in,\"\nit was stated in an obituary notice that he had been preparing a\ncollected edition of his papers, and it was hoped to bring this out\nafter his death. His papers would, of course, be connected with his\nwork at Cambridge, as distinct from his native place (somewhere in\nthe Midlands) and Bournemouth, his place of family residence. I\ndo not know of any special connection he had with any hospital.\nThere are several books in existence in which my father's name and\nJackson's are to some extent linked, and two of these are in my\npossession. One of the two, Fasciculus J. W. Clark dicatus, to which\nboth my father and Jackson contributed together with many others,\nseems to be ruled out by the fact that it is bound in a rather light\nshade of brownish j^ellow, whereas the book described by Feda is\nsaid to be so dark as to look almost black. But I have in my\npossession a book in which my father and Jackson are l^inked more\nclosely and immediately than in the Fasciculus. In 1895 my father\nbrought out the first volume of his essays on Euripides the Ration-\nalist. The dedication of the book rmis as follows :\n\" To Henry\nJackson, Litt.D., this book written in response to his suggestion is\nofiered as a small acknowledgement of many debts.\" The book is\nbound in a very dark green, which looks almost black in a poor light.\nFeda has rather overestimated its thiclvness (which is barely an\ninch), but in height and width it is distinctly larger than the average\nnovel (9 by 6 inches). It is printed on rather good, heav}' paper,\nbut the paper is not rough. There are no letters in the book, but\nmy father's own writing is frequently interrupted by extracts from\nother writers : e.g. there are one or two quotations from Paley,\nseveral from Browning's Balaustion's Adventure, and throughout\nthe whole book very numerous quotations from Way's translation\nof Euripides.\nIt was immediately after the reference to this book that Feda\ninterpolated the book-test (with which I shall presently deal). She\nthen returned to the subject of the \" old friend \" with the allusion\nto the letter J and to the name Page. \" He seems to think that\ntalking about this spirit that's passed over should remind you of\n\f324 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nPage.\" This is an interesting point. In the year 1873 my father\nwas bracketed second in the Classical Tri2)os with Dr T. E. Page,\nand in the following year he and Page and Henry Butcher were all\nbracketed together for the Chancellor's Medals. The name Page\nwould therefore be closely associated in my father's mind with his\nearly years at Trinity and consequently with Henry Jackson.\nAt my next sitting on 1 November 1921 Feda referred again to\nPage, and said this was the name of some one my father had known\nwho was \" still on the earth.\" This statement was correct. There\nhave been no other references to Page in my sittings before or\nsince. In the reference to another name beginning with J, \" Joyce\nand N at the end,\" I think there is some confusion and that this is\nan attempt at Jackson. I do not know of any name beginning\nwith J specially associated with Dr Jackson except his own.\nI now turn to the consideration of the book-test, and I must\nbegin by explaining that on my way to Mrs Leonard's house (she\nwas then living at Oakleigh Park) I bought at Broad Street Station\na copy of the Strand Magazine for October to read in the train.\nThe magazine v\/as bought at some time between 9.30 and 10 a.m.\nand the book-test was given shortly after 11 a.m. On my arrival\nat Mrs Leonard's house I laid the magazme closed on a chair. Mrs\nLeonard was never alone with it and made no attempt to examine\nit in my presence. After two or three minutes' conversation on\nindifferent subjects, she passed as usual into trance. I now quote\nagain from my record :\nFeda. Over on the chair, the book over on the chair. Your book\non the chair over there (indicates Strand Magazine).\nH. S. In this room ?\nF. Yes. Will you look about page foiu-teen ? Something there\nshould remind you of Mr Arthur's old haunts, old pursuits. He's\njust thought of that and was afraid of losing it.\nWhen I came to examine the Strand Magazine, I found, as was\nto be expected, that it is numbered consecutively from the begin-\nning of the year. It has, however, been clearly laid down that at any\nrate in the case of those book-tests for which my father is made\nresponsible the test is to be verified by comitmg the pages from the\nbeginning of the main reading matter of the book, irrespective of\nthe actual numbering of the pages. According to this reckoning\nthe fourteenth page of the October number of the Strand was^^the\npage numbered 302. I could not find on this page anything to\nsuggest my father's old hamits in the local sense of the word ;\nthe\nreference to his old pursuits is clear enough. Near the bottom of\nthe left-hand column (the Strand is printed in double columns) the\nfollowing passage occurred :\n\" It is all very well to excite pity and\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings with Mrs Leonard 325\nterror, as Aristotle recommends, but there are limits. In the ancient\nGreek tragedies it was an ironclad rule that all the real rough stufi\nshould take place off-stage, and I shall follow this admirable prin-\nciple.\" To my father's life-long preoccupation with Greek tragedy,\nhis many published works on Aeschylus and Euripides abundantly\ntestify, and it may be noted that this allusion is very aptly\ninterpolated in the midst of references to an old friend with whom\nmy father's classical interests were closely associated, the friend to\nwhom, as I have already mentioned, he dedicated the first of his\nthree volmnes of Euripidean studies, Euripides the Rationalist. The\nreference in the Strand to Aristotle constitutes a further link with\nHenry Jackson, whose lectures on Aristotle were a familiar\ninstitution at Cambridge for many years.\nAs to possible sources of the knowledge displayed, I had not\nmyself at the time of the sitting read the story in which the quoted\npassage occurs, but I caimot of course be certain that my eye had\nnot fallen on it in turning the pages. It seems, however, unlikely\nthat I should have made the mental calculation involved in refer-\nring to page 302 as the fourteenth page. Mrs Leonard, v\/hen I\nquestioned her after the sitting, without giving a reason for the\nquestion, said she had not read the October Strand, which on the\n4th of October had only been out a few days, and the argument in\nregard to calculating the page applies to Mrs Leonard as well as to\nmyself. She could, of course, have no motive for deliberately pre-\nparing the test beforehand, for she could not possibly know that I\nshould buy the Strand that day and bring it with me to the sitting.\nSo far as my recollection goes, I had never done such a thing before.\nI should like to add that throughout my acquaintance with Mrs\nLeonard, extending now nearly fourteen years, I have always foxmd\nher scrupulously honest in revealing any possible soiirce of normal\nknowledge concerning matters referred to at a sitting.\nI should like to point out that the whole consecution of ideas\nshown in these passages from my sitting of 4 October 1921, passing\nfrom allusions to Henry Jackson to the suddenly interpolated book-\ntest with its references to my father's connexion with Greek tragedy,\nand then back again to Henry Jackson and the name Page (very\npossibly helped to emerge by the immediately preceding allusions\nto the page of a book) is a consecution of ideas perfectly natural to\nthe supposed communicator. I think this whole question of associa-\ntion of ideas is interesting and important, because what we seem to\nget in these trance sittings is not a clear stream of commimication\nfrom any one source, but evidence of modifications and deflexions\nof Mrs Leonard's mind having their origin in the influence of other\nminds, possibly discarnate. Apart from all physical characteristics\na man's personality is chiefly expressed in the associations of ideas\n\f326 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nwhich constitute his memory, and his reaction to any new idea or\nimage presented to him will be founded on these pre-existing\nassociations. At the sitting of 4 October 1921 we are given what\npurport to be a particular commmiicator's reactions to two new\nideas, (1) the recent death of an old friend, (2) the passage from the\nStrand Magazine with its allusion to Greek tragedy, and these two\nideas are linked together and combined with other ideas in a way\nthat would be natural to a mind that was built upon that com-\nmunicator's memories.\n(b)\nAs another example of a book-test which affords evidence of an\nassociation of ideas more natural to the supposed communicator\nthan to Mrs Leonard, I will quote a passage from a sitting I had on\n21 November 1919. The books on this occasion were chosen not\nfrom my own house, but from the house of Lady Troubridge, who\nwas acting as recorder at the sitting. The books were said to be in\nsome shelves which, as Feda knew, had been specially reserved for\ntest purposes ; the position of these shelves in relation to the door\nof the room was correctly given, and the height of the test-book\nfrom the floor, as indicated by Feda, was found to correspond with\nthe uppermost shelf.\nThe first half of the test, which is confused and in part a failure,\nI omit. Feda continued as follows :\nFeda. Now he wants to go to the fourth book from the left, the\nfourth from the end of the shelf, page six, two, sixty-two, also near\nthe top of the page, about a quarter of the way down, suggests\nArcadia to him, that'll be nice ! And lower down on the same page\nhe got the idea of drinking, something you could drink, or the act\nof drinking.\nThe fourth book from the left in the shelf in question, as verified\nby Lady Troubridge and myself, was The Bomb by Frank Harris.\nI quote the first eight out of twenty-seven lines on the sixty-second\npage :\n\" Between the acts Elsie told me that she was enjoying it\ntoo, but she objected to Rosalind's dress. '\nIt wasn't decent,' she\nsaid, '\nno nice woman would wear it.' And she scoffed at the idea\nthat Orlando could take Rosalind for a boy, '\nUnless he was a\ngump ; no man would be so silly.' She did not lil^e Jacques par-\nticularly and the Court in the forest seemed to her ridiculous.\"\nIt is easy to understand how references to a performance of\nShakespeare's As You Like It, actually naming Rosalind, Orlando,\nJacques and the Court in the forest, might remind such a man as\nmy father of Arcadia. Arcadia, as witness amongst others Sir\nPhilip Sidney, is par excellence the literary name for the country of\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings loith Mrs Leonard 327\nsimple, sylvan life, as portrayed in As You Like It. Turning the\npages, for example, of Mr. J. B. Priestley's essay on the clown\nTouchstone in his English Comic Characters I came on the sentence':\n\" Romance, however, having enticed him [Touchstone] into her own\ngreen Arcadia. ...\"\nOn the other hand, the association of Arcadia with As You Like\nIt is not one which seems to me likely to arise in the mind of jVIrs\nLeonard. I questioned her as to her knowledge of the play, and she\ntold me that she had read it \" probably many times over \" as a\nsmall child, but had never read it since and had never seen it acted.\nShe does not now care for Shakespeare.\n(c)\nI will now give another example of a book-test in which there is\nsome evidence as to the time at which knowledge of the books was\nobtained. The sitter on this occasion was the Rev. W. S. Irving,\nand the sitting took place on Thursday, 20 September 1928, the\nnotetaker being Mr N. C. Fonnereau. Mr Irving informs me that\nthe sitting began at 2.25 p.m. and the book-tests were given in the\nearlier part of it, say, between 2.35 and 3.30 p.m. Two groups of\ntests were given on this occasion, the first from my own house,\nThe Crown House, Newport, Essex, the second from Mr Irving's\nhouse in Gloucestershire. It is with the first group that I am now\nconcerned, and it may conveniently be stated at this point that\nneither Mr Irving nor JMrs Leonard has ever visited my house, from\nwhich on one previous occasion a book-test presenting some features\nof interest had been obtained at a sitting taken by Mr Irving,\nAfter stating that the books were \" in Mrs Nelly's house \" (Feda\nalways refers to me as \"Mrs Nelly\"), she went on to give the\nfollowing indications for the identifying of the room :\n\" There are\nseveral things of Mrs Nelly's father in the room ; there is a picture\nof her father, a very good one. There's also a picture of another\nman wearing a garment that her father always referred to by a very\nhumorous name. . . . It's rather a fmmy mixtiire of things in this\nroom. . . . There's a very funny contrast of things, things very new\nand very old, close together ; and very serious things close to very\nunserious ones . . . things more like playthings ; there are play-\nthings. '\nI think these things must be recent additions,' she says.\"\nThe books were said to be \" the first lot of books to the left as you\ncome in at the door.\" There was also said to be \" a smaller book-\ncase \" in the room, and \"a set of shelves smaller.\"\nThe room at The Crown House from which these tests are taken\nmight at first sight be either the drawing-room or the study. On\nthe whole the indications fit the drawing-room best, especially the\nreference to the \" smaller bookcase.\" The three bookcases in the\n\f328 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nstudy are all rather large and all about the same size. In the drawing-\nroom the largest bookcase\u20144 feet square\u2014is to the left of the door\non entering ; there is a smaller case, 3| by 3 feet, opposite the door,\nand to the right a still smaller one, 3|- feet by 1 foot wide. I did,\nhowever, examine the books which would seem to be indicated on\nthe assumption that the test had been taken from the study, and\nfound nothing relevant. There are several things in the drawing-\nroom which belonged originally to my parents, e.g. a Persian carpet,\na Sheraton card-table, a clock, etc. There is not usually a portrait\nof my father in the drawing-room (nor in the study, except some\nphotographs put away in a cupboard). But on Thursday morning,\n20 September 1928, I was looking through some of the notes of my\nearly Leonard sittings with a view to the paper I had already begun\nto write, and I came on a description of my father which reminded\nme of a large framed \" portrait-photograph \" I have of him, which\nwas taken many years ago by Mrs Frederic Myers. It is considered\nby people who knew him one of the best portraits of my father in\nexistence. This photograph was stored at the moment in my\ndressing-room, and wishing to revive my recollection of it, I fetched\nit down and stood it beside me on the drawing-room sofa. As near\nas I can remember it was there from about 11 a.m. till a little before\n1 o'clock. After that it was moved into the study.\nThe reference to the picture of another man is not clear. The\nallusion to a garment my father called by a humorous name must,\nI think, refer to the fact that my father used in domestic circles to\nrefer to a very old smoking-coat he wore at home as his \" robe of\nstate.\" A reference to this was made spontaneously at one of my\nown Leonard sittings some years before, and was acknowledged by\nme at the time as a very good evidential point. But I cannot\nconnect an allusion to this with any \" picture of another man \"\neither in the drawing-room or the study. In the btireau drawer in\nthe drawing-room there was at the time of Mr Irving's sitting a\nsnapshot I took of my father in his garden, wearing just the sort of\nold coat he called a \" robe of state,\" but if allusion was intended to\nthis photograph, there is some confusion ; it is not a picture \" of\nanother man,\" but of the same man, namely, my father.\nThe allusion to \" a funny mixture of things \" in the room, \" things\nserious and miserious, playthings,\" is, I think, clear. Immediately\nnext to the case containing the test-books is a large oak \" bible-\nbox.\" This bible-box was never in my father's possession, but it\nhas been in the family for a long time, and came into my possession\nabout a year ago. It now contains some of my little girl's toys and\nbooks. Both the box and its contents are recent additions to the\nroom.\nI turn now to the test itself. The first book chosen was the\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings with Mrs Leonard 329\nsecond from the left in the lowest shelf, p. 95. On this page it was\nsaid \"there is a description of a place you and I [Mr and Mrs\nIrving] Imew, were in ; an old-fashioned place, old-wprld, a village.\nThere's something given in the description which will point it for\nyou, place it. There's some characteristic there that is a strong\ncharacteristic of a place we knew together. ... At the very begm-\nning of this book there were conditions referred to that would interest\n]\\Irs Nelly's father, conditions he was interested in, when on earth.\"\nOn p. 91 of the same book there is said to be something descriptive\nof jMrs Irving, a rather personal characteristic.\nThe second book from the left in the lowest shelf of the bookcase\nto the left of the door was a volume of Charles Kingsley's Poems\n(Macmillan, 1872) ; pp. 91 and 95 are part of the text of a play\ncalled \" A Saint's Tragedy,\" which deals with the story of Elizabeth\nof Bohemia. As the tests from this book were personal to Mr\nIrving I sent the book to him for verification. He writes :\n\" On the page numbered 95 I foimd,\nMonks ... we poor religious\nAre bound to obey God's ordinance and submit\nUnto the powers that be, who have forbidden\nAll men, alas ! to give you food and shelter. ...\nEliz. I'll go.\nThe above scene is described on p. 94 as '\nA street ... at the door of\na convent. Monks in the porch.'\n\" About the year 1902, my wife and I, being very interested ui\nmonastic life, and hearing that there was a monastery of secluded\nmonks at Broadway in Worcestershire, cycled there and asked to\nbe allowed to look over the place. A foreign-looking monk who\nopened the door could not speak English ; he tried to send us away.\nWe would not go, as we had come a long way to see the place, so\nat last he admitted us. Presently angry and threatening voices\nwere heard, and a red-faced Irish priest rushed in shoutmg, ' Get\nout, ladies are not allowed in the monastery.' He would not listen\nto our explanations, so we had to go. Broadway is an old-world\nvillage, an old-fashioned rural spot, as described. I still have a\nphotograph of the monastery chapel, obtained about the same time.\n\" On the page numbered 91, I found :\nYour smiles are worth gold pieces.\nMy wife's gay smile was one of her greatest attractions. In a letter\nwhich I still have, witten to me by a parishioner just after my\nwife's death, is the following :\n'\nHer happy face and bright smile\nalways seem to do one good to see.' \" ^\n1 1 have seen this letter.\u2014H. S.\n\f330 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nWith regard to tlie statement that right at the beginning of the\nbook there were conditions referred to that would interest my\nfather, I could not find anything that seemed altogether satisfactory.\nOn the title-page of the book appears the name \" Andromeda,\" the\ntitle of one of the principal poems, and the two parts of the \" Proem \"\nto \" A Saint's Tragedy,\" the first poem in the book, are called\nrespectively \" Epimetheus \" and \" Prometheus.\" All these names\nwould have associations interesting to a classical scholar, but the\nmere occurrence of the names hardly seems to fulfil the requirements\nof the test.\nI now turn again to the record of the sitting :\nFeda. She says, \" on the outside of a book close to this one [the\nKingsley Poems] is a name of her's, but she doesn't think it's Dora\n[Mrs Irving's Christian name], but another name. It's on the out-\nside. . . . Wait a minute ! She got a name like Watson, Watson,\nWatson, on the outside of a book close here.\" Then she says, \" It's\nan ordinary name, but I picked it up rather personally, because it\nfitted in, was a name of some one I knew rather well here on the\nearth. . . . Watson.\"\nThe book standing immediately next to the test-book and three\nother books in the same shelf were volumes of poetry by William\nWatson, and in each case the name Watson appeared on the back\nof the book. I am informed by Mr Irving that Watson was the\nname of a married sister of J\\lrs Irving's who died in the spring of\nthis year. The name has never been given at his sittings before.\nI did not make Mr Irving's acquaintance imtil some years after his\nwife's death, and I know nothing whatever of Mrs Irving's\nfamily connexions except the irrelevant fact that her maiden name\nwas Whitehead. It will be seen that the statements made in this\npart of the test seem to combine knowledge concerning the position\nand title of books at my house (possibly derivable from my mind)\nwith knowledge of a personal link existing between the name\nWatson and Mrs Irving, not derivable from me, nor, so far as can be\nascertained, normally possessed by the medium.\nUpon this point Mr Irving tells me that Mrs Watson had never\nvisited him at his present home, nor were he and Mrs Irving in the\nhabit of discussing family matters with parishioners, so that the\nname would not have been easily learnt by local enquiries. After\nthe allusion to Watson, the record of Mr Irving's sitting continues\nthus :\nFeda. \" Now,\" she says, \" go along this shelf, the seventh book\nfrom the left.\" When she touched this book she wanted to say\n'\nHow are the mighty fallen ! How are the mighty fallen !\n'\nThat's\n\f116] Incidents Occurring at Sittings with Mrs Leonard 331\nwhat she kept saying. ... She says that book gave her such a\nstrong feeling on it that she wants to repeat these words. On the\nbook something on the book. She says, '\nMrs Nelly will probably\nunderstand that, will, indeed, understand that before you do.\nIn the early part of this book, which proved to be The Thoughts\nof Marcus AureUus (The World's Classics), there were said to be\ngeocrraphical comparisons,\" \" plans and comparisons of distances,\nand on p. 53 a reference to \" rivers or streams, running water and\nalso to a special anniversary connected with Mr and Mrs Irvmg.\nThis part of the test is not satisfactory. The only point which\nseems worth noting here is that on p. 52, which touches p. 53 when\nthe book is closed, are the words \" all flow from the same fount.\nFeda frequently alleges the liability of communicators to confuse two\nadjacent pages. If we include the two pages adjacent to the test-\npage in our range, we thereby multiply by three the possibi ity of\nchance-coincidence, and a success of this kind has no evidential\nvalue unless, as in this case, there is a fairly close correspondence\nbetween the communicator- s statement and the printed matter.\nEven so, the point should in my opinion be reckoned doubtful.\nThe words \"How are the mighty fallen,\" which the communi-\ncator emphasises in connexion with this same book, might easily\noccur to the mind of a scholar or a student of the Roman Empire\nin allusion to the fact that the death of Marcus Aurelius closes an\nimportant and splendid epoch in the world's history ;\nhe was the\nlast of the great pagan philosophers and also the last of the great\nRoman emperors. I will give two quotations from Frederic Myers\nand Gibbon to illustrate my meaning: \"And, finally the most\nsubtle and attractive of living historians has closed his strange\nportrait gallery with this majestic figure [M. Aurelius] accounting\nthat the sun of Christianity was not fully risen till it had seen the\npaling of the old world's last and purest star.' ^ And, it is\nthe design of this, and of the two succeeding chapters, to describe the\nprosperous condition of their [the Roman] empire ;\nand afterwards\nfrom the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the most important\ncircumstances of its decline and fall.\"\n^\nIt is worth noting that throughout this group of tests my lather,\nto whom the circumstances of Marcus Aurelms's life and times\nwere a matter of familiar knowledge, appears to be associated with\nMrs Irving, and that in reference to this particular test it is said\nthat\n\"\nMrs Nelly will probably understand that, will indeed uiider-\nstand it before you do.\" The interpretation of the words How\nare the mighty fallen,\" which I have given above, did m fact occur\n1\nF.

But this point, again, is not a strong one ; it\nsuffers from the defect, all too common in book-tests, that the\nmeaning is not sufficiently obvious and on the surface ; too much\ninterpretation is needed.\nOmitting a reference to something on the outside of another\nbook in the same shelf, the interpretation of which is doubtful, I\nturn to the last test in the series, which is said to have been given\nby A. W. V. with Mrs Irving's assistance.\nFeda. He went on to the shelf above the one Dora was on ; ... he\ntook the third book from the right and he took page seven of that\nbook ; and on page seven was something very characteristic of the\nImage. [Feda then explains to Mr Irving that \" the Image \" is\nmy little girl and continues.] There's something on that page that's\nvery much to do with the Image, that refers to the Image, and he\nwanted it called the Image because of what's on that page.\nThe third book from the right in the shelf indicated was Gil-\nchrist's Life and Work of William Blake (1880), vol. i. Page 7 is\npart of a chapter concerning Blake's childhood and the word\n\" childhood \" appears as a chapter-heading at the top of the page.\nI will quote from the bottom of page 6 : ...\" and then unsophis-\nticate green field and hedge row opened on the [p. 7] child's\ndelighted eyes. A mile or two further through the large and pleasant\nvillage of Camberwell . . . the sweet hill and sylvan wilds of rural\nDulwich . . . the fertile verdant meads of Walton-upon-Thames ;\nmuch of the way by lane and footpath. The beauty of those scenes\nin his youth was a lifelong reminiscence with Blake, and stored his\nmind with lifelong pastoral images.\"\nMy daughter, just three years old,^ is called Imogen. At the\nfirst sitting I had with Mrs Leonard after her birth I was told by\nFeda that my father intended to refer to her as \" the Image,\" and\nshe has habitually been called by that name at my subsequent sit-\ntings. Whether Mrs Leonard has, or had at the time \" the Image \"\nwas first referred to, any normal knowledge of my daughter's name,\nI cannot say, nor is the question material here. I take the reference\nin the test to be to the country scenes and \" the child's delighted\neyes.'' We live in a comitry village with fields and woodland all\nabout us, and the love of flowers, which is characteristic of most\nsmall children, is very marked in Imogen. She usually notices any\nnew flower she sees on her walks and asks its name. It will be\nobserved that at the end of the paragraph from Gilchrist quoted\nabove the word \" images \" occurs, making a definite link with the\nchild's name. This I take to be the meaning of the words \" he\nwanted it called the Image, because of what's on that page.\"\n^ This section of the paper was written in January 1929.\n\fTHOUGHTS ON MR SALTMARSH'S REPORT ON A SERIES\nOF SITTINGS.\nBy the Rev. W. S. Irving.\nIn venturing to put down a few thoughts that have been suggested\nto me by J\\Ir Saltmarsh's comprehensive and stimulating \" Report\non the Investigation of Some Sittings with Mrs Warren Elliott\n\"\n{Proceedings, xxxix. 47 iJ.), I am emboldened to do so, not only\nbecause he has on several occasions referred to sittings taken by\nme, but also because it has been possible for me to compare his\nresults with a large number of my own sittings mainly taken with\nMrs Osborne Leonard.\nOn page 91 of his paper, Mr Saltniarsh says with regard to post-\nmortem statements concerning the commimicator, \" It is, of course,\nimpossible to say whether they are veridical or not.\" If, however,\nwe find that statements of a somewhat unusual nature are made by\ntwo or more Controls, through different mediums, to independent\nsitters, such statements may, I think, at least be said to be worthy\nof consideration, and to have some small amoimt of evidential\nvalue. And there would seem to be a correspondence of this kind\n(with material given to me at a Leonard sitting) on page 86, as\nfollows :\n\" Him says him getting used to him's mind once more as\nif him was young. It was something here in life that sort of robbed\nhim of something, and now him sort of learning . . . learning to use\nhim's mind . . . seemed as if him was child again and him couldn't\ndevelop\u2014growth ceased\u2014and now him got all that to make up.\"\nAt a sitting with Mrs Leonard on 30 April 1925, my communicator\nbrought with her to commimicate a man who claimed to have been\nsomeone I used to know. I was able to identify him quite definitely\nas a former Vicar of mine who had also been Chaplain to the Coimty\nLmatic Asylum. At another sitting on 31 July 1925, my com-\nmunicator referred to him again in Personal Control, and it is what\nshe said then that makes the correspondence with the extract from\nthe \" X Case \" : \"... He's working very hard. (What's he doing ?)\nV\/orking for the poor demented. . . . There aren't any on our side\n\u2014those still on your side. . . . People aren't demented on our side,\nbut there are people who canH use their minds because they've got to\n333\n\f334 The Rev. W. S. Irving [part\nlearn to iise them. People who've been, what you call. '\nout of their\nminds '\nfind difficulty at first in using them, but it comes all right\nin a little while.\"\nOn page 124 Mr Saltmarsh suggests that \" Feda does receive a\ngood deal more of her information by means of symbols than\nappears on the surface,\" and he illustrates this from an incident at\none of my sittings in which Feda says \" the test is mackintoshes\nand umbrellas test is.\"' To anyone reading the script I can see that\nthis may appear to be the interpretation of a symbol given by the\ncommunicator. This was not, however, how it appeared at the\nsitting. I took it to be simply a joke of Feda's\u2014promptly squashed\nby the communicator in the words, \"No . . . water-tight.\" And\non tiurning to my index of those sittings I find the incident classed\namong \" Humorous sayings of Feda.\" Of course, my interpretation\nmay not be the right one, but there is not much use of symbolism\nin my Leonard sittings, and when symbols are used care seems to\nbe taken by Feda to let us know. There was such an instance in a\nrecent sitting of mine with this medium, when it was desired to\ngive the name of a lady who had passed over, and it had not been\npossible to give it. Feda said, \" There's a name connected with\nthis lady I can only give symbolically. Very much connected with\nfixes and burning, like as if a gentleman were called Mr Cinder, do\nyou see ? . . . Dora thinJcs of this lady in connection with tea and\ncakes l\n\" By a process of elimination, I managed at last to identify\nthe person to my own satisfaction, as a JMrs Baker. It is seldom,\nhowever, that instances of this kind have occurred at my sittings.\nHumour by Feda is frequent, especially at good sittings, and tends\nto lighten the strain, and I think improve the material.\nOn page 126, Mr Saltmarsh mentions the \" great difficulty in\ngetting through proper names.\" Nevertheless, quite a number of\nnames have been given to me on occasion, through Feda, spontane-\nously, which I have been able to recognise, among them being\nJesson, Hadow [notetaker had Haddo], Sharp, Watson, and Miller.\nAnd Topsy once described a communicator, said to be Mr Charlie\n[Colonel Baddeley], as saying something about a Mrs Murbing.\n\" This gentleman says that he's met Mrs, like, Murbing, she's been\nvery good to him, and he likes her very mixch.\"\nWhen one remembers Topsy's way of putting M's or N's on to\nwords, it is not so bad an attempt at my wife's simiame. The above\nquotation is from a sitting on 4 February 1925 (Recorder : Dr\nWoolley), and was taken nearly a year before the date on which\nMrs Elliott learned my name normally.\nOn page 107, Mr Saltmarsh alludes to \" the numerous references\nto Miss Newton's recent thoughts or actions obtained \" by me,\nthrough Mrs Leonard, and published in Proceedings. These he\n\f116] Thoughts on Mr SaltmarsVs Report of Sittings 335\nseems inclined to put down to telepathy or clairvoyance, acting\nsporadically. It should be noticed, however, that it is by no naeans\nthe case that all these \" Impression \" tests were known to Miss\nNewton. Even in those taken from the S.P.R. Rooms, there are a\nnumber concerning things of which Miss Newton knew nothing.\nSome of the best of these have not, as yet, been published, but a\nfew have, and the \" cupid \" case on page 197 of volume xxxvi is a\ngood example of what I mean. In this case my communicator said,\nat a sitting with Mrs Leonard on 23 September 1924, that at the\n\" Psychical 'Searchers \" she got the \" word '\ncupid '\ncoming to her\nstrongly.\" She thought \" they must have that word written very\nlargely on something that has been discussed, or written there,\nlately.\" Miss Newton's note on the above was :\n\" Mrs Ham, the\nhousekeeper at 31 Tavistock Square, showed me to-day (September\n29, 1924) a white china cupid which had been given her by our\ntenant's housekeeper,' when leaving, some time during the first half\nof August. Neither Miss Horsell, Mr Dingwall, nor I knew anything\nabout this until Mrs Ham told me . . . when I enquired on September\n29. ...\"\nIn the same volume, some on pages 191-2, is a short series of\nthese tests that seem to have been found at the Rooms of the\nLondon Spiritualist Alliance, and on pages 242-5 a longer series\nfrom a house unknown to Miss Newton, and not well known to me.\nFurther tests of this nature, not yet published, come from a house\nthat is not known to me at all\u2014though in this last case I under-\nstand that the occupier has herself had sittings with Mrs Leonard.\nThese are from the house of the lady referred to in Proceedings,\nxxxix, on pages 141-2. The telepathy, therefore, if telepathy it be,\ncan hardly be of a simple nature, directly from mind to mind, nor\nwould any direct form of clairvoyance meet the whole of these cases.\nConcerning Apparent Discontintiity in Communications.\nOn page 132, Mr Saltmarsh speaks of the \" disjointedness and\nlack of continuity in the commimications. . . . The '\nspirits '\ndo\nnot tell us what we should expect from them. The salient facts of\ntheir history are frequently omitted, and trivial details given.\"\nThat this statement would be incorrect as regards Leonard sittings\nat least, I venture to submit. To begin with, the memory of the\ncommimicator, through Feda, is extraordinary. Dora, for instance,\nhas alluded (practically without repetition) to most of the important\nevents of her life. At my last sitting she went back about 32 years\nto find her subject for an interesting reminiscence. And there does\nnot seem to be overlapping in material given through different\nmediums concerning the past.\n\f336 The Rev. W. S. Irving [part\nBut perhaps Mr Saltmarsh is thinking of the apparently discon-\nnected way in which incidents are brought forward at single sittings.\nI mean incidents that seem to have no line of thought connecting\nthem with each other, but to have been given haphazard. As far\nback as 20 September 1921, my commmiicator referred to this,\nspontaneously, as follows :\n\" [Feda] . . . Sometimes when you're\ntracing a thing through your notes, do you find she speaks of one\nthing, goes on to another, and links up to earlier one ? She says,\n'\nI give Fact no. 1, Fact no. 2, Fact no. 3, and Fact no. 3 is a distinct\nlink up with Fact no. 1. I'm not always able to make Feda imder-\nstand that.' \" Bearing this in mind, I have from time to time been\nable to trace the line of thought imderlying Leonard material and\nto see the connexion that otherwise might have escaped notice.\nThis can be easily illustrated from recent sittings fresh in my\nmemory. On 23 April 1929, at a Leonard sitting, subject no. 2\nwas a reminiscence of an expedition taken many years ago, with\nmy wife, to look at some \" big lumps of stone\u2014very old,\" so that\nwe said, \" Strange how long these must have been here.\" Subject\nno. 3 had no connexion with the above. Subject no. 4 was a careful\ndescription of the design on a round or oval brass article belonging\nto my wife, which I still use but in a different way to the way in\nwhich she had used it. This I recognised as a good description of\nher brass afternoon tea-tray. At first sight there is no connection\nbetween the subject no. 2 and subject no. 4. Nevertheless, through\nthe giving of the latter, I was able to place beyond doubt the identity\nof the former. The brass tea-tray I gave to my wife when we went\nto live at Leckhanipton, and the lumps of stone represent \" The\nDevil's Chimney \" at Leckhamptou, though the visit referred to\nwas made, I thinli, many years before we went to live there.\nHere is another example, from a sitting with Mrs Leonard on\nThursday, 19 September 1929. This is an attempt to show know-\nledge of what I had just been doing on my holiday, and continued\ninterest therein. Subject no. 1 describes my looking in a shop\nwindow. Subject no. 3 is a description of a tea-shop to which my\nwife used to go in Richmond, Yorkshire, with its surroundings\ncarefully described. Subject no. 4 describes a present that I gave\nmy wife for her to use and enjoy, and the statement is made it will\nbe brought into a book-test. This point is not definite enough for\ncertainty, as it does not state what the present is. I take it to be\nanother reference to the brass tea-tray mentioned above. Subjects\nnos. 5-11 are not connected with the above. Subject no. 12 de-\nscribes a room in my sister's new house at Richmond, Yorkshire, in\ndetail, and \" something circular shape, in brass,\" is referred to.\nThese things seem disconnected\u2014they are not. In the room de-\nscribed in subject 12 1 decided to buy my sister a brass tea-tray like\n\f116] Thoughts on Mr Saltmarsh's Report of Sittings 337\nthe one I bought my wife long ago. Subject no. 1 describes my\nlooking in London for trays in shop windows. Subject no. 3 shows\nknowledge of where the place is where I have been staying\n\u2014\nRichmond\u2014and describes a shop, long since forgotten by me, where\nmy wife used to go for tea and cakes. This was identified by my\nsister. I should add that the shop's description is very unusual, up\n\" a narrow turning upstairs \" . . .\n\" old-fashioned place\n\"\n...\" steps inside dark,\" etc. That behind the scenes, as it were,\nthere is an acute intelligence, with considerable knowledge of the\npast lives of myself and my wife, with the power, also, to plan\nahead, and arrange beforehand, the programme for the next sitting,\nis, at least, a simple explanation of the phenomena. For an example\nof this latter point, the power to plan ahead, I next give another\nextract from my latest sittings of all.\nA few days before leaving home for my summer holiday, on\n2 September 1929, I had read in the paper by Mr Saltmarsh the\nWarren Elliott description, in an Absent Sitter sitting, of my sister\nin chuich, wearing a \" shawl, buff with red check,\" and a hat \" very\nlike a man's tall hat.\" I had thus been reminded of a plaid shawl.\nOn Monday, 16 September 1929, at a sitting with ]\\Iis Leonard,\nI noticed that she was wearing a lighter coloured shawl than the\none that she usually wears. In view of what was said at the sitting,\n1 I asked to be allowed to look at the shawl afterwards, and foimd\nthat, in certain respects, it was rather like the description of the\nsupposed shawl belonging to my sister. It was part plaid, grey and\nbuff, near the edge, though the greater part of the shawl was grey.\nThis is important as showing what my subconscious mind may have\ngrasped, though the light was none too good, and consciously, I\nnoticed nothing of this before the sitting. The effect on my com-\nmunicator is given below :\nExtract from Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 16 September 1929.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving, taking his awn notes, as the note-\ntaker left at the end of Feda's Control.\nD. G. I. ... Will ! I've got a shawl on.

Greyish, got something else on it, too, another shade\nor colour in it too, I think. One I used while here\u2014right towards\nthe end of my [life].

I'm\nlosing (Try and bring it in next.). . . . [Sitting ends with farewells.]\nMy wife had a beautiful Egyptian scarf or shawl, which she\nvalued greatly and used up to the time of her death. It was bought\nby her father, in 1911. After the sitting, I met one of my wife's\nsisters, Mrs Savy, and asked her to describe the shawl for me in\nwriting. This was on the following Wednesday. I also wrote to\nher mother, Mrs Whitehead, and asked her to tell me anything she\ncould remember about the shawl.\nThe following is the evidential part of Mrs Whitehead's reply\n(26 September 1929) :\n\" It is interesting to know that Dora has\nmentioned her Egyptian scarf. ... It was amongst the things you\nallowed me to bring away . . . after the funeral. ... I remember\nDickie [Mrs Savy] had this particular article. ... Mr W. brought\nsix from Egypt\u2014one each for the five girls and one for me. . . .\nThe colour of the scarf was cream bespangled with gold tinsel in an\nartistic design. [But see below.] Its width about 24 or 26 inches\nand length about 54 inches. ... It was given her on her father's\nreturn from Egypt in the month of April 1911 . . . given them\nunassociated with any anniversary of birthdays, etc.\nMrs Savy wrote (8 October 1929) :\n\" The following is a descrip-\ntion to the best of my recollection of the Egyptian scarf or shawl\nwhich belonged to my sister Dora and which was sent to me amongst\nother personal things of hers, shortly after her death. A shawl\nabout a yard and a half to two yards long, and about half a yard\nwide, made of net of a dull white, or more exactly greyish colour,\nthe net being interwoven with a design of silver-coloured tinsel.\"\nMy own recollection\u2014and I saw the shawl much more often than\nthe others did\u2014is that it was of pale mauve, or pale grey, heavily\nweighted with silver. I do not know of any amiiversary connected\nwith it, save that it marked Mr Whitehead's return after many\n\f116] Thoughts on Mr Saltmarsh's Report of Sittings 339\nmonths' absence. The following April, however, was a very impor-\ntant time for us.\nThree days later, i.e. on 19 September 1929, I had another sitting\nwith Mrs Leonard. It must be noted that I had not been home\nsince leaving there on 2 September 1929, nor had I heard from\nanyone at my Vicarage.\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard on 19 September 1929.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N. C. Fonnereau.\nFeda. Now she want to go home to some books. (Eight.) Mr\nBill ! She's going to an old place. (Good.) The shelves that she's\nbeen to before. What's that, Dora ? . . . Now, Mr Bill ! She's\ntaking one\u2014two. She's taking, IVIr Bill, the second shelf\u2014second.\nThat's right ! Second. And she's going to the third book from the\nleft, and she's looking at the page sixty-three, and on it you'll find\na reference to something she was talking about at the end of the\nlast sitting here. Do you remember what I was talking about at\nmy Personal Control right at the end 1 (Yes.) There's a reference\nto it there\u2014words that would describe it. Page sixty-three. (About\na shawl ?) Yes, she says, yes. And, on forty-one, forty-one, of the\nsame book, there's another reference connected with the same thing.\nDirectly I got home, I asked my housekeeper to go with me to\nmy drawing-room, and in her presence I counted the books and\nfound those from which the tests were taken, i.e. the third and fifth\nbooks from the left, second shelf up. The titles I wrote on a piece\nof paper, which I gave to my housekeeper to keeji until a friend\ncould come in and question her on the matter, and properly witness\nthe books. The third book from the left, second shelf up, was The\nReproach of Islam, by W. H. T. Gairdner (London 1910). On page 63\nI found, \" Whence came it ? . . . the Islam of Mohammed.\" These\nwords were the heading of the page, and on the second line, not\ncoimting the heading. On page 41 I found :\n\" Whence came it ?\n. . . the Ai'abian nation. ...\" Also, between pages 40 and 41 was a\nfull-page picture entitled \" Crossing the Desert.\" This picture\nshows some Arabs crossing the desert on foot, and these appear to\nbe men. There is also an Arab on a donkey, and two Arabian\nwomen riding on a camel. The last is particularly prominent in the\npicture. Behind the women, on the camel, is a large bmidle of rich\nmerchandise,\u2014it looks not milike a bimdle of shawls, or stuff of\nthat kind.\nIt should be noted that an attempt was made, apparently, to give,\nthrough Mrs Mason, a book-test from this book on 30 July 1929,\nso that this book was among some that I had recently handled.\nOn the other hand, the tests were then said to be on page 13 or 18,\ng2\n\f340 The Bev. W. S. Irving [PABT\nnot near the present test-pages, though I may have looked further.\nAnd, of course, the subject of shawls had not then become to me a\nsubject of special interest. I take it that my communicator is here\ntrying to tell us that feeling Mrs Leonard's new shawl on her\nshoulders, while controlling, reminded her : (1) Of her own Egyptian\nshawl ; (2) That this is not the first time that she has recently been\nreminded of it. I do not recall myself having thought of my wife's\nshawl for months\u2014if not years.\nAnd then, again, there is another thing that would seem to be\nevidence of continuity of thought : the occasional giving of addi-\ntional material said to have been forgotten at a former sitting.\nHere is an instance. At a Leonard sitting on 16 September 1929,\nmy communicator mentioned a number of minor trivial things that\nshe said she had recently seen or been reminded of, at home. On\n19 September she again gave, through Feda, a few more. Later, in\nthe Personal Control on that day, she said as follows.\nD. G. L ... Will ! Can you remember, were you thinking of any-\nthing in connection with coins and pieces of money ? I got such a\nstrong feeling of coins before the last sitting. I tvas going to mention\nit then, and forgot. In case you've forgotten, the coins should have\nreminded you of me. Coins I knew when I was here, and touched\n\u2014\nhandled. It's the only reason they're important. I didn't want\nyou to think I meant some ancient and valuable coins. When I\npassed over I loved them\u2014left them\u2014behind. . . .\nI may just say, in passing, that years ago I used to collect coins,\nold azad foreign. Shortly before leaving home for this holiday, I\ncame across, in a drawer, a chain bangle of my wife's to which she\nhad attached two coins annexed from my collection. They are not\nof any value, a Jubilee Victoria token, and a Swiss coin dated 1880.\nThe interesting point is, of course, that this little bit of evidence\nwould seem to have been part of the former sitting's programme\nthat was omitted through forgetfulness at the time. It will be\nnoted that I had not been home between the two sittings.\nTurning now to my Warren Elliott sittings, I find a similar state-\nment concerning the difficulty of getting things through in connected\norder, to the one quoted a,bove given through Feda. It was given\non 19 November 1926, and runs as follows :\nTopsY. She'm says that she'm always working hard. After one\ntalk she starts working very hard to collect her power, and lot of\nsort of test things, to be able to shoot out next talk. Gets quite a\ncollection, and then chooses power according to what she can get\nthrough. That's why things sometimes are so scattered, does you\nunderstand ? .\n-\n.\n,\n\f116] Thoughts on Mr Saltmarsh's Report of Sittings 341\nNevertheless, the evidence for this, through this particular\nmedium, would not, I think, be strong were it not supplemented by\nother things such as cross-correspondence with Leonard material.\nHere, however, are two instances, of varying types, both apparently\nconcerning the same people, Mr and Mrs Y., who at one time figured\nsomewhat largely in tests given to me through Mrs Leonard (see\nProceedings, xxxvi. 239 ff.).\nExtracts from a Sitting tvith Mrs Warren Elliott on 23 September\n1925.

She was brought to her father-in-law's\nhouse about two miles from my Vicarage, and died soon after,\naged 34. She left one child, a small boy.\n[13.] Mrs Y. was buried in my churchyard at Oxenhall. My\nChurch is on a hill, and the ground slopes down slightly from the\nmain door of the Church to the boundary wall. Mrs Y's grave is\nnearest the wall.\n[16.] Mrs Y's grave is next to that of my wife. She is the only\nyoung married woman, according to our Registers, that has been\nburied in this churchyard in very recent years. Unfortunately this\npoint is weakened in value because on 19 June 1926 a man who\nhad been killed by a bull, and his little boy, were buried together ;\nand on 2 March 1926 and 2 June 1926 a woman and her grand-\ndaughter were buried near together. They had, however, no strong\npersonal touch with me beyond the fact that they were parishioners\nwell known. The Y's are personal friends.\n[21.] On Easter day, 17 April 1927, only 17 days before this sitting,\nMr Y. attended at the 8.30 a.m. service at Oxenhall with a lady,\nand at 11.0 a.m., on the same day, he brought a small party,\nincluding his father, a lady, and, I think, his small boy, to my other\nChurch at Pauntley. As my own parishioners are mainly small\nfarmers and labourers, it is of interest when visitors from the big\nhouses in the neighbourhood come to owr chiirch.\n\fREVIEW.\nUpton Sinclair, Mental Radio : Does it Work, and How ? With\nan Introduction by Professor William McDougall. London :\nT. Werner Laurie, 1930. 8vo, pp. 207, 281 ill. Price 8s. 6d. net.\nThis book by the well-known American novelist and writer on\nsocial subjects, Mr Upton Sinclair, is an important one. By Mental\nRadio is meant telepathic communication between two minds, and\nwe have here a valuable addition to our evidence concerning experi-\nmental telepathy. It contains a careful accoimt of experiments\ncarried out in 1928-1929 in which Mrs Upton Sinclair was the\npercipient, and other persons, chiefly her husband, the agent.\nEarlier experiences of Mrs Sinclair, spontaneous and other, are\ndescribed, but the main object of the book is to describe and discuss\nexperiments in the transference of rough drawings looked at by\nthe agent and which, without seeing them, the percipient attempted\nto imitate, often with great success. The experiments resemble\nsome that have been described in the Proceedings of our Society\n(especially the earlier volumes) and in Phantasms of the Living.\nOut of 290 such experiments for which 38 drawings were supplied\nby Mr Sinclair's secretary and 252 by himself he coimts 23 per cent,\nas successful, 53 per cent, as partially successful, and 24 per cent, as\nfailures. No doubt individual opinions will differ somewhat as to\nwhere exactly the line should be drawn between successes, partial\nsuccesses and failures, but we are given in the book a large propor-\ntion of the drawings\u2014agent's and percipient's\u2014in the experiments\nclassed as successful, and a considerable proportion of those\nclassed as partially successful, so that readers can judge for them-\nselves of the author's standard ; and they will not, I think, after\nreading the book, or even the first two chapters, feel any doubt\nthat Mrs Sinclair's success is far beyond what chance could produce.\nTo the experiments in telepathy is added a chapter (Chapter IX)\non experiments in clairvoyance rather of the book-test order. These\nare interesting and will, it is to be hoped, be continued. But\nthey do not appear to have been carried out, or at least are not\ndescribed, with the same care and minuteness as the telepathic ones.\nMrs Sinclair's experiments were all done in full consciousness,\nwithout trance, and she is thus able to remember and give a careful\n343\n\f344 Review [part\nanalysis of the mental process, so far as she is aware of it, through\nwhich she obtains the telepathic impressions, and of the technique\nshe has found useful in getting into the right state of mind. This\nshe does in Chapter XXI. An account of this kind by a person so\nmuch interested, and so well able to express herself, greatly adds to\nthe value of the book, and will be useful to other experimenters.\nMrs Sinclair, however, would not maintain that there is only one\npossible method, or that the kind of deliberate concentration she\nfinds useful is always necessary. She herself sometimes receives\nwith no deliberate effort both waking and dreaming impressions,\nsome of which are described in the book, of the thoughts and feel-\nings and doings of others, especially of her husband. Moreover,\nwe cannot assume that the same technique would always be the best\nfor all percipients.\nMrs Sinclair does not in this chapter about her method tell us\nmuch about different individual impressions and the way they\ndeveloped in her mind, though she tells us something. Various\nthings may, however, be deduced from experiments illustrated and\ndiscussed in the book. It seems clear, for instance, that, as has\nbeen previously observed in similar series of experiments {e.g. Mr\nGuthrie's, Proceedings, vol. ii), that it is sometimes the form of the\nagent's drawing that influences the percipient and sometimes the\nidea behind it. V\/hen for a letter y in current writing the percipient\nproduced a capital Y as in print, it is clear that what was transmitted\nwas the idea or the name of that letter, not its shape (p. 79, no. 33).\nAnd again when Mr Sinclair draws (very roughly, for neither agents\nnor percipient are artists) a volcano with thick black smoke issuing\nfrom the crater, and Mrs Sinclair draws an absurdly similar picture,\nbut calls it a black beetle\u2014the black smoke representing the body\nof an insect and the sides of the mountain its antennae\u2014it is clearly\nthe form of the object, not its name, that is transferred (p. 70, no. 25).\nSometimes other telepathic ideas reinforcing memory associations\nseem to intrude themselves into the percipient's impression. Mr\nSinclair calls attention to a case of this sort on p. 42 (no. 15). He\ndrew a football \" neatly laced up.\" This was reproduced as a\n\" belly-band on calf.\" Except that the outline of the percipient's\ndrawing had a sort of projection at one point representing apparently\nthe calf's head, the two drawings are distinctly like each other.\nWhence the idea of the animal ? While Mrs Sinclair was trying to\nget the required impression it appears that her husband was reading\n\" a treatise on the feeding of cows,\" which may have telepathically\nbrought cows to the percipient's mind, and this with the draw-\ning of the football may have revived for her the idea of \" a calf\nsewed up like a football \" which, as it happened, had been one\nfamiliar to her as a child.\n\f116] Review 345\nIn the particular experiments I have mentioned agent and per-\ncipient were no further apart than adjoining rooms, but as Mr\nSinclair remarks (p. 11) telepathy \" works as well over forty miles\nas over thirty feet.\" Mrs Sinclair did five experiments with a\nbrother-in-law living forty miles off, as agent, which were all\nsuccesses or partial successes (Chapter VII). These experiments\nwere done on five different days at hours agreed on beforehand, the\ndrawings being compared later. They may be called single experi-\nments as distinguished from those in which Mr Sinclair was agent.\nIt is to be regretted that we have not more such single experiments,\nbut Mr Sinclair's usual plan was to prepare batches of six to twelve\n(on one occasion fourteen) drawings at a time, which were then\nplaced beside Mrs Sinclair, each enclosed in an envelope or otherwise\narranged so that she should not see them. She went through the\nwhole batch one by one, holding each successively in her hand and\ndrawing what she mentally saw.\" The order in which she took\nthem seems to have been haphazard and not known to Mr Sinclair.\nThis plan of working through batches just prepared by the agent\nis doubtless convenient, and a less severe tax on the agent's time\nthan single experiments. But it adds complications in some ways.\nThe agent presumably has the whole batch more or less in his mind\nwhile the percipient is trying to get impressions. She holds one of\nthe batch in her hand, saying to herself, \" I want the picture which\nis on this card, or paper, presented to my consciousness \"\n(p. 174).\nBut it sometimes happens that the impression received corresponds\nnot to the drawing she is holding, but to one later in the series.\nSeveral examples of such anticipations are given in Chapters XIV\nand XV. It seems unlikely that they are in any real sense pre-\nmonitions, for the agent, as aheady said, has the whole batch in his\nmind and any one might be transferred. A more difficult question\nis why when, under these circumstances, a correct impression is\nreceived, it is usually of the drawing held by the percipient ? Is\nthere clairvoyance supporting telepathy ? A very peculiar case of\nthis anticipation is no. 58, p. 101. Two drawings by a stranger to\nthe percipient had been inserted in a batch of drawings by Mr\nSinclair's secretary. The percipient failed to \" get \" the first of\nthese, \" seeing \" instead a grotesque figure which she described in\ndetail. The description corresponded quite remarkably well with\nthe stranger's second drawing, which came seven drawings further\non in the batch. What was the influence in Mrs Sinclair's mind\nconnecting the stranger's two drawings ?\nThe plan of working with batches of drawings has enabled Mrs\nSinclair to make an observation agreeing with what Miss Jephson\nfound in her experiments in clairvoyant card guessing. Her per-\ncipients, it will be remembered, \" guessed \" in batches of five, and\n\f346 Review [part 116]\nshe found a distinct tendency to greater success at the beginning than\nat the end of a batch [Proceedings, xxxviii. 230 ff.). Mrs Sinclair\nin her chapter on technique says (p. 185), \" I found that, in doing\na series of several drawings, the percentage of successes was higher\nin the first three attemjits. . . . This may have been due to the fact\nthat the memory-pictures of these first three experiments now con-\nstituted a difficulty. So much attention had to be given to inhibit-\ning these memory-pictures, and in deciding whether or not they were\nto be inhibited. Or it may be due to some other cause, such as\nfatigue or boredom.\"\nI have said enough, I think, to show that these experiments will\nrepay study, and I may add that Mr Sinclair is to be congratulated\non making a book on so dry a subject, not only useful to students,\nbut readable for the ordinary reader. For students I think the\naddition of a chronological list in tabular form of all the telepathic\nexperiments in which drawings were used, with their divisions into\nbatches, might be useful ; but we are given so large a selection of\nthem in full, and so much information about them, that it seems\nmigrateful to ask for more.\nI will end with heartily endorsing the final sentence of Professor\nMcDougall's interesting introduction. \" Mr Sinclair's book,\" he\nsays, \" will amply justify itself if it shall lead a few of his readers to\nundertake carefully and critically experiments similar to those\nwhich he has so vividly described.\" And that this effect should be\nproduced among the members of om Society is all the more to be\ndesired, because they have sent in so little work of this sort for so\nmany years. E. M. S.\n\fI. THE VISIT OF M. PASCAL FORTHUNY TO THE SOCIETY\nIN 1929.\nBy V. J. WOOLLEY.\nThe mediumsliip of M. Pascal Forthuny has been a subject of\ninterest to an increasing number of students of clairvoyance for some\nyears. Since, however, most of the accomits of his powers have\nappeared in French it may be of interest if I give a short summary\nof his development by way of preface to the description of our\nLondon experiments.\nOn a few isolated occasions prior to 1920 M. Forthuny had\nspontaneous supernormal experiences. One in particular has been\ndescribed by him : a vision of a coffin which caused him to return to\nParis from a long distance in time to see his mother before her\nunexpected death.\nIn June 1919, however, he was overwhelmed by grief at the tragic\ndeath of his son as the result of a flying accident, and about a year\nlater he began suddenly to produce automatic writing. These\nwritings purported to be in part messages from his son and in part\ncommunications from a spirit guide. None of them, however,\nshowed any knowledge of verifiable facts which were not known to\nM. Forthuny himself, and on Christmas Day, 1920, the writing\nabruptly ceased and has never since recurred. He claims, however,\nthat this gift of automatic writing was replaced by a gift of clair-\nvoyance, so that he is now able from time to time to discover facts\nrelating to persons in whose company he is, these facts consisting of\ndetails regarding their past history, present surroundings and even\ntheir future.\nThis clairvoyance is said to be to some extent subject to his\nconscious control so that he can direct it towards assigned individuals,\nbut it is most commonly demonstrated in large gatherings. Under\nthese conditions M. Forthuny says that he is aware of the direction\nof the individual with whom his impressions have to do, but does not\nknow whether he is one of those near him or further away. A\nnumber of descriptions of his successful demonstrations have\nappeared in the Revue Metapsychique and other French journals.\nMr Besterman has also described ^ a private sitting at M. Forthuny's\n^ Proceedings, xxxviii. 474.\nH\n\f348 Visit of M. Pascal Forthuny to the Society [part\nhouse, and Mrs Brackeulniry and I have had similar private sittings,\nand have also attended one of the pnblic demonstrations which were\nheld in a hall in Paris. In each case there seemed no doubt that M.\nForthuny had a knowledge of circimistances which he could not have\nacquired normally, and the Council invited him to visit the Society\nduring the course of 1929 in the hope that he would be equally\nsuccessful in London.\nDuring his visit we were able to arrange three meetings for those\nMembers and Associates who wished to be present, thus reproducing\nas far as we were able the conditions of the public demonstrations\nwhich M. Forthuny is accustomed to give in Paris. On the other\ndays of his visit he kindly agreed to give private sittings to those\nwhom we introduced to him for the purpose. As sitters we selected\nfor the most part those who had provided interesting material from\nvisits to other mediums, our aim being to compare these previous\nresults, of which we possessed the records, with whatever was\nproduced during the present series.\nFor purposes of classification it is perhaps convenient to divide\nthe records rather arbitrarily into three groups : A. The public\ngatherings ; B. The private sittings ; C. Psychometric experiments.\nA. The Public Gatherings.\nOur aim in these meetings was to follow as closely as possible the\nprocedure to which M. Forthuny was accustomed in Paris. This\nconsists in his facing the audience, with the light behind him, and\nrelating to the various persons concerned the impressions which he\nmay receive about them and their affairs. All that was said was\ntaken down by a notetaker engaged for the purpose, but we found\nan unexpected difficulty in securing the services of a French short-\nhand writer, and the detail and accuracy of the records suffered in\nconsequence. A further difficulty lay in the fact that it is not always\nquite certain who is the person about whom the impressions are\nreceived. M. Forthuny is only able to locate his direction, and this\nsometimes rather vaguely, so that he is rather dependent on his\nimpressions being claimed by the person whom they really concern.\nExperience shows that difl'erent people vary very greatly in the\nreadiness with which they will claim an impression as relating to\nthemselves, and there is reason to believe that some evidential\nmatter was not recognised owing to the unwillingness of those\nconcerned to claim it.^\nIt is not easy imder these conditions to form an estimate of the\n^ Thus, at one of the public meetings, M. Forthuny mentioned two Christian\nnames to a member of the audience who failed to recognise them, but I learnt\nafterwards that these names were the names of the father and uncle of two ladies\nsitting immediately in front of the person addressed, and that the father had\npur^Dorted to communicate at various sittings with other mediums.\n\f117] Visit of M. Pascal Forthuny to the Society 349\ndegree of success attained in the demonstration as a whole. The\nmethod suggested by Saltmarsh and Soal ^ for estimating the merit\nof mediumistic communications does not seem wholly applicable to a\ncase like this in which purported communications from the dead\nare hardly concerned.\nOn account of these difficulties it seems impossible to do more\nthan to give a few quotations from the records of the sittings,\ntogether with the comments thereon of the people to whom the\ncommimications were made, and I have deliberately chosen those\ncommunications which were admitted to be in part correct. I must\nleave it to the reader to decide how far these correct statements\nmay be due to chance and how far such an explanation is excluded\nby the detail involved.\nThe first meeting took place on 29 May 1929, and communications\nwere addressed to twelve different members of the audience. Some\nof these were only a few sentences and some were of a kind difficult\nto confirm or deny with precision, but I propose to quote in full\nthe commimications made to three people together with their\ncomments, which were added later to the written record.\n1.

Pascal Forthmiy to the Society 351\nIt will be seen that in each of the three communications I have\nquoted there is a considerable proportion of truth. That can only\nbe attributed to one or more of three possible sources : {a) Chance\ncoincidence ;\n(b) Conscious or unconscious knowledge obtained by\nnormal means ;\n(c) Some supernormal faculty. I think we may\nfairly argue that the proportion of accuracy in these three cases is\ntoo high to be due to chance coincidence, and I am reasonably sure\nthat M. Forthuny neither had nor ever had had any normal know-\nledge of the facts he detailed. It follows that we are driven to assume\nthat his knowledge comes from some supernormal faculty, and it\nseems reasonable to suppose that this faculty consists mainly in a\nsupernormal knowledge of what is in the minds of people present\nwith him, whether we call such knowledge telepathic or clairvoyant.\nThe other two public meetings took place on 4 and 12 June.\nThe results on the whole were inferior to those which I have already\nquoted, and I do not think that anything would be added to the\nevidence by giving the notes here.\nB. The Private Sittings.\nNine of these were held, the sitters being invited mainly from\nthose whose records of sittings with spiritualistic mediums were in our\npossession previously. In two cases the sitters took their own\nnotes, and in the others either we or the sitter provided a notetaker.\nThe French shorthand writer whom we engaged was unfortunately\nquite inexperienced in taking notes of sittings, and the records\nwhich were made by the sitters' friends were in fact more useful\nfor our purpose.\nAs regards evidence of a supernormal faculty these sittings are\nin no way different from the public meetings. There is a certain\namount of accurate material mingled with a good deal which is\nerroneous. Even in those sittings which showed apparently super-\nnormal knowledge there was curiously little in common with the\nrecorded results of sittings with other mediums. This is well\ninstanced by the record of the sitting with the two Misses X, one\nof whom was the Miss X who had successful sittings with Mrs Warren\nElliott in 1928.^ Besides having sittings with Mrs Warren Elliott\nthis lady had had sittings with several other mediums, and on each\noccasion had been given veridical details regarding the life and\ncharacter of her late father, though, as far as could be determined,\nshe had always gone as an anonymous sitter, and the mediums\nconcerned had no normal knowledge of her family affairs. In fact,\nin all these sittings, the most prominent feature of the record is the\npersonality of her father and his \" remorse for his unkindness and\na desire for forgiveness \".^\n^ Proceedi7igs, xxxix. 80. ^ Proceedings, xxxix. 81.\n\f352 Visit of M. Pascal Forthuny to the Society [part\nNow in this Forthuny sitting the only allusions that might apply\nto her father are of the vaguest sort and might equally apply to a\nnumber of other people. On the other hand there are a number of\nstatements which I propose to quote, with annotations, which show\nin my opinion a degree of accuracy which is collectively too great\nto attribute to chance. It is particularly noteworthy that the first\nremark, which opened the sitting, contained a statement of a fact\nwhich was unknown to either of the two sitters and was apparently\na prediction. I have noticed in several cases that M. Forthuny's\nopening remark is often the most striking \" hit \" of the sitting.\nThe sitting took place on June 5, and the notes were taken down\nin English by the other Miss X, no other notetaker being present.\nI must just tell you one small\nthing that comes to me in con-\nnection with you.\nThere is a lady whose occupa-\ntion is sewing or dressmaking,\nconnected with clothes and\ndresses, who has either made out\nto you an inexact account or\ntaken or kept back some stuff\nfrom you. It is in connection\nwith some business house. Yes,\na lady occupied with sewing.\nI think it is over now but you\nhave been deceived or cheated.\nIt is not important but I am\ngiving it to you. You have been\ncheated in some question of\ndressmaking.\nP, P, Paterson, Peterson ; is\nthere a street like that ? Any\nstreet in London like Peterson ?\n[Later in the sitting :]\nIs November or December a\nspecial month for either of you ?\nA person, very much attached\nto you, is coming from afar into\nyour house, and she will tell you\nworries about her health. I see\nher coming to you, and in her\nsecret thoughts she is more\nworried than she lets j)eople\nthink.\nWe were unaware at the time\nof the truth of this statement. I\nwas then having a ready-made\ndress from Peter Robinson's\naltered at that shop. Three days\nafter this sitting the dress came\nhome and I found that a pro-\nmised half yard of the material,\nleft over from the alteration, had\nnot been returned with the dress.\nI do not think I was wittingly\ncheated as the assistant told me\nafterwards it had been omitted\nthrough the packer's oversight.\nIs Peterson an attempt at\nPeter Robinson ?\nOur sister is expected from\nthe Argentine with her family in\nDecember. She has lately been\nworried about her health for the\nfirst time in her life. She would\nbe anxious, but it would be her\nnature to keep the worry to\nherself.\n\f117] Visit of M. Pascal Forthuny to the Society 353\nMa\u2014Ma\u2014Margery ? Mal-\nLINS ?\nShe is more anxious tlian she\ntells you, but perhaps you have\nguessed how anxious she is. She\nhas had an example from a friend\nwho had had this same illness or\nill-health. She had a bad acci-\ndent because of her illness : this\nhas frightened this person. She\nhas either brought flowers to you\nor brought them from the coun-\ntry.\nShe has been forbidden many\nkinds of food.\nHas she not had in her owm\nfamily some one who has had the\nsame trouble and this worries\nher ? She is much more worried\nabout this trouble than she\nallows people to think.\nNo.\nShe had several sharp attacks\nof gall-stones. Strange to say,\nmy mother, for the first time in\nher life had a very bad attack of\nthis same trouble. My mother\nwas so ill that a serious operation\nwas threatened, but mercifully\ndid not have to be performed.\nIt is quite possible my sister may\nfear the need of an operation in\nher own case if her trouble occurs\nagain.\nThis is quite true as she is on\nthe strictest diet.\nSee above.\nThe rest of the sitting consists of a fairly accurate character\ndelineation of the sitters and a number of statements, some of which\nconvey nothing while others are partly right and partly wrong.\nIn Mr Saltmarsh's report on the sittings with Mrs Warren Elliott\na good deal of veridical matter is noted in connection with what is\nthere called the A case.^\nOn June 8 A's father, mother, brother and sister-in-law had a\nprivate sitting with M. Forthimy in order that we might be able to\ncompare his results with the previous ones. No notetaker was\npresent and the notes were taken by A's mother, who has added\nher annotations. On the whole the results are less good than in the\nMisses X case that I have described, but, just as in that case, there\nis hardly any reference to A who came to the front so prominently\nin the sittings with other mediums. Apart from a reference to a\nyoung man whose photograph requires framing, whereas there was\nat the time a photograph of A in a frame which required glazing,\nthere is very little to suggest him in the whole sitting. There were,\nhowever, a certain number of accurate statements made regarding\npast events and family connections which could hardly have been\nknown normally to M. Forthimy. I quote below some examples\nfrom which it may be seen that they are of the same type and degree\n1 Proceedings, xxxix. 66.\nh3\n\f354 Visit of M. Pascal Forthuny to the Society [part\nof accuracy as those I have quoted in connection with the other\nsitters.\n1. There is a little dog who is dead. It had a little coloured\ncushion. A dog was hurt : there were two difierent dogs : Pitty\n. . . Petty ... A man of the church is standing near. You took\nit somewhere where there was \" une sorte de barriere \".\nNow on July 15, 1926, A's mother had a sitting with Mrs Warren\nElliott. The following is extracted from the notes :\nHim was fond of dog with long ears, does you know ?\n(Yes)\nISTot very tall, sort of long and not very tall, but long with long\nears . . . There was an accident to that dog, does you know ?\n(Yes)\nYou got white doggie or had white doggie when him here. Shows\nTopsy white doggie. Got a little brown on him somewhere. Does\nyou know it ?\n(Yes)\nFrom the sitter's annotations it appears that A's family had\nseveral different dogs in his lifetime. One was a dachshund called\nPattikin, in connection with which M. Forthuny's attempt at the\nname \" Pitty or Petty \" seems a fairly close approximation, while\ntwo other dogs were accidentally killed.\n2. There is a lady who limps, she walked with two sticks and is\ngetting out again for the first time. There has been some recon-\nstruction of her house lately. She is elderly, has a very good head\nand gives help to a great many people.\nThe sitter (A's mother as before) comments :\nI have a friend who broke her hip over a year ago. She is not\n\" out again for the first time \" but she is just beginning to walk\nagain without depending on a stick. She used two crutches for a\nlong time. Her house has been reconstructed lately, and a week\nor two before the sitting she had been showing me over it. She is\nan unusually gifted and clear-headed woman with a passion for\nhelping people less fortunate than herself. Her age is 65.\n3.

Pascal Fortliuny to the Society 355\nirises on the mantelpiece and on the piano a bowl of mauve and rose-\ncoloured sweet peas. When I put them there I remembered having\nhad the same flowers in the room the last afternoon A had been\nat home in 1918. Waterley meant nothing to me at the time, but\nafterwards I remembered that a Mrs Whatley had been here to tea\nthat same afternoon. This is written in my diary.\nThe remaining private sittings were of varying degrees of accuracy.\nThey all contained some \" hits \" as well as a good deal that was\nquite inaccurate or unverifiable, and I do not consider that anything\nis to be gained by quoting from them. The extracts already given\nwill serve as samples of the whole.\nC. Psychometric Experiments.\nThere remain only the experiments in what is generally called\nPsychometry and Object-reading. These were four in number.\nThe first was made at the second public meeting on 4 June, when\nM. Forthuny was handed by the Rev. J. W. Hayes a box containing\na small Egyptian figure. Unfortunately he took out of the box the\nsmall parcel containing the figure before saying much about it, and\nthus, although he did describe it as Egyptian and very old, it is\nimpossible to be certain that this is more than could be learnt by\nnormal means. He added rightly that the object had been given\nto Mr Hayes by a lady, but there was nothing accurate in what\nhe said about her.\nThe second experiment was made in private on 11 June. An\narticle in a closed packet was handed to him by Mrs Brackenbury,\nwho had no knowledge of the contents of the packet. No one else\nwas present. It is not worth while to quote what he said about it\nbecause hardly any of it has any relevance to the object. It is\nhowever of considerable interest to note that he concluded with\nthe statement, \" I get the name Kathleen \". No other names were\ngiven before this, and Kathleen is the name of the owner of the\narticle, a fact which was known to Mrs Brackenbury.\nThe third and fourth experiments were carried out at the third\npublic meeting on 12 June.\nThe first object consisted of an irregularly shaped piece of canvas\nmeasuring roughly about 10 x 5 cms. It was in fact a piece of the\nenvelope of the Zeppelin airship which was shot down at Cuffley\non 3 September 1916. It was sealed in an envelope in one side of\nwhich had been cut an oblong opening of about 3.5 x 2 cms. This\nallowed one side of the canvas to be seen and touched but not the\nother. The side which was thus visible showed a rough canvas\nsurface. The other side was covered with some waterproofing\ncomposition. When I examined it myself before the meeting I\nthought it was a piece of a bicycle tyre. .\n\f356 Visit of M. Pascal Forthuny to the Society [part\nOn handling this object M. Forthuny said :\n\" Je marche dans une route eblouissante de soleil : je suis conduit\n:\nje domine les choses au dessus du monde. J'entende les noms\n'\nMichael ' . . .\n'\nHardy '\n. . . un nom qui finit par '\nman '. Im-\npression d'un violent tonnerre, tournade epouvantable. Je ne peux\npas arriver a definir, je vais aller directement. Je vois un homme\ncombattant dans une bataille, tourmente. Le 17 Avril. Initiales\nA\u2014A.\"\nThe second object was a small irregularly shaped piece of alumin-\nium about 2.5 cms. long, contained in a sealed matchbox. In the\ntop of the matchbox was a roughly circular hole about 1 cm. in\ndiameter through which the object could be just touched and rather\nindistinctly seen. This piece of aluminium had formed part of\nanother Zeppelin which was shot down at a later date.\nM. Forthuny's impressions were as follows :\n\" Je vois quelqu'rm qui etoufie, qui arrache son col, qui defait\ndes boucles, qui se jette en avant et qui tombe. Theodore. C'est\nune impression tout-a-fait semblable a celle du premier paquet.\"\nThese experiments seem to me to be the most successful ones of\nM. Forthuny's visit, and the reports are worth considering in some\ndetail.\nBoth objects were provided by Mrs Brackenbury, who was present\nat the meeting and who of course knew their histories. In the case\nof the first one, the phrase \" je suis conduit, je domine les choses au\ndessus du monde \" is very applicable to a member of the Zeppelin's\ncrew. The names \" Michael \" and \" Hardy \" are the names of two\npeople who were closely connected with Mrs Brackenbury's life\nand with one another.\nThe \" impression d'lm violent tonnerre, tournade epouvantable\n\"\nis easily applicable to aerial fighting, as is the \" homme combattant\ndans une bataille \".\nThe accuracy of what is said about the second object is even more\nstriking, especially as there is nothing whatever to cause this\nfragment of aluminium to be associated with any fatality. As I\nmentioned above it formed part of a Zeppelin which was shot down\nnear London. Mrs Brackenbury was present in the course of her\nduties as an ambulance driver, and in walking over the field she\ndiscovered the body of one of the crew at some distance from the\nwreckage. His back was broken, but his body was not burnt or\notherwise injured, and it seems clear that he threw himself out\nbefore the airship came down.\nFinally, I should like to call attention to M. Forthuny's concluding\nremark that he received just the same impression from the second\nobject as from the first. It seems to me quite impossible to attribute\nthis to any normal observation. He had no knowledge even that\n\f117] Visit of M. Pascal Forthuny to the Society 357\nthey were contributed by the same person, and there was nothing\nwhatever to suggest a common origin for the two.\nCoNCLUSioisr.\nI have tried to put forward those cases in which there seem to\nme to be the best grounds for supposing the existence in M. Forthmiy\nof some supernormal faculty. That the evidence is not stronger\nand the cases more numerous is due in part to two causes. I have\nalready mentioned one, our difficulty in finding a competent French\nshorthand writer. The other cause lies, I think, in the difficulty\nwhich M. Forthuny felt in entering into the psychology of another\nnation. Nearly all the sitters, both in public and private, were quite\nunknown ground to him, and this brought about a very real though\nlargely unconscious inhibition of his powers. Besides this he also\nfelt a certain conscious restraint in a fear lest he might by accident\ntransgress some convention unknown to him.\nThe nature of that supernormal faculty remains obscure. In these\nLondon experiments very little was said by him which had not at\nsome time been known to someone present, and we must assume\nthat his information was derived in some way from that person's\nmind. What appears to me to be of interest is the fact that his\ncommunications are very little concerned with supposed messages\nfrom the dead, and in that way afford a marked contrast to the\ncommimications we are accustomed to receive from English mediums\nalthough the verifiable details are of much the same type in both.\nFinally, I must express to M. Forthuny the very warm thanks of\nthe Society and of myself for the willingness with which he lent\nhimself to our experiments and acceded to all our wishes.\n\f11. THE MARGERY MEDIUMSHIP, AND THE LONDON\nSITTINGS OF DECEMBER 1929.\nI. A Criticism of the Method of Control.\nBy V. J. WooLLEY AND E. Brackenbury.\nIn December 1929 Dr L. R. G. Crandon of Boston gave three\ndemonstrations in the Society's seance-room of some of the pheno-\nmena which he has described as occurring through the mediumship\nof Mrs Crandon [Margery). The procedure was understood to be\nthe same as that employed in the sittings which usually take place\nat Boston, and an examination of the method of limb control and\nthe phenomena occurring seems to be worth while in affording data\nfor an estimate of the mediumship as a whole.\nThe method consists in the attachment of the wrists and ankles\nof the medium to the arms and front legs of her chair by a number\nof turns of adhesive tape. The position of the tape is marked on the\nskin by lines drawn over tape and skin in pencil. We do not think\nit necessary to describe the method in any greater detail, since we\nare in full agreement with Dr Crandon that his method does secure\nthe wrists and ankles firmly to the chair so that no movement is\npermitted to the lower ends of the forearms beyond what is allowed\nthrough the skin moving for a short distance over the underlying\nmuscles and bones.\nIn addition to this attachment of the wrists and ankles a cord is\ntied at its centre to the back of the chair and the two ends are\nbrought over the shoulders and then under the arms, passed through\nthe back of the chair and tied behind. This arrangement limits the\nposition of the shoulders so that they cannot move forward more\nthan a short distance, and so limits to some extent the movements of\nthe head.\nThe table and chair used in the sittings were procured in London,\nthe table being specially made to the dimensions asked for by Dr\nCrandon, while the legs of the chair were cut short in such a way that\nthe knees of the medium were just able to pass under the top of the\ntable, part of the table frame being specially cut away to allow of\nthis. It follows that a very slight raising of the knees is enough to\nbring them in contact with the table and so to lift it off the floor,\n358\n\fPART 117] The Margery MecUumsMp and London Sittings 359\nand it is impossible, when such a low chair is used, to adjust the tapes\nround the ankles in such a way as to prevent this. We have\nmentioned above that the tapes round the wrists prevent movement\nof the lower ends of the forearms. It is however clear that the hands^\nwhich are not secured at all, have a very considerable latitude of\nmovement, depending on the degree of flexibility of the wrist joints.\nWe have made experiments under this method of control, and\nhave satisfied ourselves that it is by no means difficult to move the\ntable about and to handle and lift up any objects placed upon it.\nIn addition to being ineffective the method has the further\ndisadvantage of being exceedingly uncomfortable for the medium.\nIt makes difficult or impossible the small changes of posture which\nare essential for comfort, and the tightness of the tapes causes the\nskin between the turns to become swollen and painful. Also, the\nadhesive used is not water-soluble, and the tapes have to be dragged\noff the skin by force at the conclusion of the sitting, a process which\nis painful at the time and which tends to damage the skin if repeated\nat too short intervals.\nWe have mentioned already that our own experiments have\nsatisfied us that it is possible for a person fastened in this way with\nadhesive tapes to the chair used in the Crandon sittings to handle\nand lift up objects placed on the table, and that on that account\nwe consider the method of control to be ineffective, but it is of\nimportance, in judging the value of the sittings in question, to know\nif there is any definite evidence that the objects were in fact so\nhandled. It is the chief purpose of this paper to present what we\nbelieve to be such evidence.\nIn order to make intelligible what follows it may be worth while\nto describe the usual procedure at the Crandon sittings when the\npersonality known as Walter expresses his intention of making a\nfinger impression.\nTwo dishes are placed on the table in front of the medium, who\nis secured to her chair in the way we have described. The dish to\nher right is filled with water which is as hot as can just be endured\nfor a short time by the fingers. The dish to her left contains cold\nwater. These dishes are generally filled in red light. Lying on the\nbottom of the hot water dish with its ends projecting over the edges\nis a folded cloth or handkerchief. When directed by Walter, a\nsitter puts into the hot water and on the cloth a marked cake of\nKerr dental wax. The red light is then extinguished. When this\nwax is sufficiently softened by the hot water it is pulled out by means\nof the cloth and an impression is made on it. As soon as the impres-\nsion is made the wax is put into the cold water to harden. It is\nalleged that all these manipulations of the wax after it is put into\nthe hot water are carried out by a supernormal structure made by\n\f360 The Margery Mediumship and London Sittings [part\nWalter for the purpose of manipulating material objects, and known\nas his \" terminal \". The chief argument used to support this\ncontention is the allegation that the medium is so efiectually\nsecured in her chair that she cannot herself handle the objects on\nthe table.\nDuring the course of the sitting of 7 December 1929 a piece of\ndental wax (which we will call A) was, by Walter's direction, broken\nin two,^ and for clearness we may call these pieces Al and A2.\nOne of these two pieces, Al, was placed in hot water to receive the\nimpression of a digit from an alleged \" visiting lady,\" but owing\nto the water not being hot enough it showed finally only a small\nsurface depression with no skin-markings. This piece Al, which\nremained in our possession, is only of importance as helping to ascer-\ntain the weight of A2. The second half, A2, was then placed in hot\nwater, but this time the water was too hot ; the wax became\nadherent to the handkerchief and finally rolled up in it and no\nimpression was obtained. It is with the fate of this second half,\nA2, that we are mainly concerned. By Walter's direction it was\nleft as it was on the table, still rolled up in the handkerchief, until\nthe next sitting (on 8 December 1929) and at some time in the course\nof that sitting it was squeezed up in one of the pieces of wax which\nwere softened during that sitting to receive impressions. This is\ndefinitely proved by the weights of the cakes of wax used and of\nthe lump remaining at the end of the sitting of 8 December. To\ndecide this we weighed ten new cakes of Kerr wax, with the following\nresults :\n^ .\nWeight of lightest cake, 24.77 grams .\n,\n,\nWeight of heaviest cake, 29.70 grams ,\nr\nAverage weight of one cake, 27.00 grams. ;\nNow the weight of the first half piece of 7 December, which we call\nAl, is 16.58 grams, so that the weight of the other half piece A2 was\nalmost certauily between 8 and 13 grams and probably about 11\ngrams. The weight of the shapeless himp, which we believe to\nconsist of one whole cake and this half, is actually 38.96 grams, a\nfigure which fully confirms our belief. We think then that it may\nbe taken as certain, and we believe that Dr Crandon will agree with\nus in this, that this lump remaining at the end of the sitting of\n8 December 1929 was made by the joining together of the old half\npiece, A2, from the night before with one of the whole new pieces\nfirst softened during this sitting.\nAt the sitting of 8 December two new pieces of wax, one marked\nwith one notch, and hereafter called B, and one with two notches,\nhereafter called C, were used. At the beginning of the sitting the\nhalf-piece A2 was, as already stated, on the table.\n'^Psychic Eesearch (New York 1930), xxiv. 260. '\n: >\n\f117] The Margery Mediumship and London Sittings 361\nIf we now turn to Dr Crandon's dictated notes of the sitting of\n8 December we are met by the surprising fact that they contain\nno mention of the softening of the first piece of wax B, which is only\nreferred to indirectly in Walter's statement that \" the first piece was\nspoiled oiving to the ivater being too cold \".^ To rectify this omission,\nand to make the account of the sitting intelligible, we give below\nour own notes of what occurred.\nAfter \" Walter says '\nif we get a 'print, mind you, it may be a poor\none'\",^ our notes continue: \"Walter called for red light and\ndirected Lord Charles Hope to put some hot water in the basin and\nDr WooUey to put a marked piece of wax therein. Dr WooUey put\nin the hot water a new cake of Kerr, marked with one notch [that\nis, B], and the light was then extinguished. After a minute or two\nWalter announced that it was no good ; the water was too cold.\n\" Lord Charles Hope asked where the spoilt piece of wax was.\nWalter said that we could not have it now, or words to that effect.\n\" Then he asked for another piece [that is, C] to be produced and\ndirected Lord Charles Hope to pour more hot water into the dish\nwithout the red light being turned on.\" ^\nFrom this point Dr Crandon's notes continue as follows :\n\" Walter directs that later ivhen he so orders them, Dr Brown is to\nstand and put his right hand on the psychic's left hand and similarly\nwhen ordered, Dr WooUey is to stand and put his marked wax in afresh\ndish of hot water and keep his hand on the psychic's hand, thus keeping\npractical * control of both hands. . . .\n\" Under orders from Walter, Mrs Brackenbury takes Dr Crandon\nout of the room. As Mrs Brackenbury had to take Dr Crandon out of\nthe room, Lord Charles Hojk attended to the gramophone, when it got\nto the end of the record. He {Lord Charles) says, '\nI moved across,\nrestarted the gramophone and sat next to the notetaker, jmtting both my\nhands on her arm.'\n\" Dr WooUey dictates '\nAt Walter's direction, Dr Crandon and Mrs\nBrackenbury left the seance-room and Dr WooUey and Dr Brown ivere\ninstructed to stand one on each side of the medium, Dr ]Voolley holding\nthe medium's right hand with his left, and Dr Broivn holding the\nmedium's left hand with his right, and the tivo joining their unoccupied\nhands as far as possible awayfrom the medium.'\n\" Before doing this Dr WooUey had put a piece of wax into the dish.^\n^ Dr Crandon's notes are printed in italics throughout the present paper.\n^Psychic Research, xxiv. 261.\n^ This was the only occasion during the series on which the red light was not\nallowed while hot water was being poured into the dish.\n* In the notes as pruited in Psychic Research this word has been altered to\n\" tactual \".\n^ This piece of wax was marked with two notches.\n\f362 The Margery MediunisMp and London Sittings [part\n\" After the expiration of some time Dr Brown was instructed to lift\nup the iuax impression from the table by the side of the cold ivater dish .\nHe lifted first a lump of wax in a cloth which Walter said was the wrong\nim,pression. Dr Brown later found what ivas said to be the right im-\npression on the table and handed, it to Dr Woolley and both resumed their\nseats.\" 1\nWe then note that Mrs Brackenbury and Dr Crandon returned\nto the seance-room.\nDr Crandon's notes continue, \" Walter tells us that the first piece\nwas spoilt owing to the water being too cold, and that the piece which was\nhanded out as the p)roper result was the second jjiece of wax.\" ^\nOur notes continue : \"A few minutes after Mrs Brackenbury and\nDr Crandon returned Walter said, 'Here you are, Woolley', and\nwe heard a hard object fall on the floor.\" This object was picked\nup afterwards by one of us (E.B.) and foimd to be the spoilt wax\nalready described as consisting of one and a half cakes of Kerr\nsqueezed together into a shapeless lump. Now this squeezing\ntogether took place during the course of the sitting, and was com-\nj^leted before the medium was released from her bonds. We thought\ntherefore that this lump was deserving of a very careful examination\nfor finger impressions, since any found ought to have been produced\nby what is known as \" Walter's terminal \". We were only able to\ndiscover one impression on its surface, and this bore no resemblance\nto the well-known Walter impression. On comparing it however\nwith the impressions of the medium's fingers which she kindly\nallowed one of us (V. J. W.) to take while she was in London, we\nfound that it was quite certainly the impression of her right index\nfinger. Figs. 1 and 2 are enlarged photographs of this impression\non the squeezed lump and of the impression of the finger in question.\nThis seemed such an important fact that we communicated it to\nDr Crandon in a letter of 30 January, and on 17 February he replied\nas follows :\n\" The spoilt and squeezed piece of wax was handled by the\nmedium in the presence of everybody after the sitting because, with\nScotch thrift, she wanted to retrieve the handkerchief from it.\nThis handkerchief you remember was the one put in hot water by\nyou at Walter's request. The water was too hot and wax and\nhandkerchief got completely stuck together.\"\nIt is clear that the sitting to which Dr Crandon refers in this letter\n1 This \" right impression \" is an imprint of a thumb which Walter attri-\nbuted to an elderly lady and is referred to by Dr Crandon as the Old Lady\nimpression. The identity of this piece of wax, i.e. whether it was the first\npiece, B, or the second piece, C, forms the subject of Part 2 of this paper.\n^ Dr Crandon here adds the word \" divided \" which does not seem to us to\nmake sense, because neither of the two pieces softened on that evening was\ndivided. Each was a whole new cake.\n\f\f\f117] The Margery Mediumship and London Sittings 363\ntook place on 7 December 1929, (a) because the squeezed lump\nfound after the sitting of the 8th had no handkerchief attached :\nit was thrown on the floor as already described, (b) because on\n8 December Walter complained that the water was too cold and not\ntoo hot.i\nSome further correspondence ensued, and on 28 March Dr Crandon\nwrote \" December 7 Walter instructed us to leave everything on\nthe table as it was. Just before the sitting of December 8, Margery,\nimpulsively and casually, picked up one of the pieces of December 7\nwax which had been left on the table. You, Mrs Brackenbury and\nmyself all cried out to her not to touch it. If her finger mark is on\nit that is the way it happened.\"\nThis second suggestion of Dr Crandon's seems to us to be even\nless admissible than that put forward in his earlier letter. The\nimpression on the wax is in three dimensions, and it could only have\nbeen produced while the wax was hot and soft. It could not possibly\nhave been done on the 8th before the sitting began since there was\nnot at that time in the room any hot water or other means of\nsoftening the wax.\nThis was pointed out to Dr Crandon in the course of further\ncorrespondence and he has now published the first suggestion,^ as\nthe true explanation of the finger impression, and gives four reasons\nwhy its presence on this piece of wax is of no importance.\nThese are : (1) It was not a piece of wax which was a part of any\nexperiment. We submit that this piece A2 was a part of an experi-\nment on the 7th although no impression was obtained on it. It also\nbecame part of an experiment on the 8th because it was on the table\nwhen the sitting of 8 December began, left over from the previous day\nat Walter's request, and remained there throughout the sitting of 8\nDecember. Dr Crandon's contention seems to imply that only those\nobjects which show the desired result are to be taken into account,\nwhile those that indicate a normal causation of phenomena are to\nbe neglected because their evidence is accidental.\n(2) It was warm at the end of the sitting and would receive an\nimpression from anyone who touched it.\nWe have carried out some experiments on the time of cooling of\nthe wax used, and find that a whole cake of Kerr wax, heated in\nwater to the highest temperature which allows it to be manipulated\nat all, then removed and made into a ball (in order to cool as slowly\nas possible), is too cold to receive a recognisable imprint after 15\nminutes in a warm room.\nOn 7 December only half a cake (or less) was used : it was not\nsqueezed into a ball ; and we may safely assume that the cooling\ntime was not more than this.\n^ Psychic Research, xxiv. 262. ^ Psychic Research, xxiv. 260w.\n\f364 The Margery Mediumship and London Sittings [part\nNow the removal of the wax from the water is recorded in Dr\nCrandon's notes ^ in the words \" Something is heard coming out of\nthe water, and some wax as if it was hitting the table \". Unfor-\ntunately no times are recorded, but after this note there takes place\na good deal of talk from Walter, the gradual rousing of the medium,\nthe examination of the adhesive strapping and rope, the examination\nof the medium by Lady Barrett and the changing back of the\nmedium into her usual clothing. We are quite unable to believe that\nall this could have been compressed into 15 minutes, which is the\nlongest possible time for the wax to have remained soft.\n(3) The conditions of the sitting of 8 December (where WooUey\nand Brown held the lashed hands throughout the experiment)\nexclude the normal production of the prints.\nThis seems irrelevant to Dr Crandon's contention, since the hands\nwere in fact held only for a part of the experiment, namely from the\ntime that the second piece of wax was put in the hot water until the\nold half piece, that is, \"a lump of wax in a cloth \" as mentioned\nin Dr Crandon's notes, was picked up by Dr Brown. It is not clear\nwhat prints are referred to since only one print (the Old Lady) was\nproduced at this sitting.\n(4) Both of the \" Walter \" prints ^ and also the \" Old Lady \"\nprint show only the unique print desired.\nThis also seems irrelevant to the point vmder discussion, which is\nthe presence of the medium's finger impression on a quite different\npiece, namely, the \" squeezed lump.\" It would clearly be a great\nadvantage if we could establish with certainty from the wax itself\nwhether the impression is on the half piece A2 or the whole piece\n(B or C : for argument see Part II) which were welded into one on\n8 December. The appearances suggest that it is on the whole piece\nwhich we believe to have been wrapped round the half piece so as to\nenclose it more or less completely. It is not possible to be certain\non the point without softening the wax and we are unwilling to do\nthis at the present time. But even without this we consider that we\nhave sufficient evidence, from the wax and Dr Crandon's notes, to\nmake it reasonably certain that by some means or other an impression\nof the medium's right index finger was made on the wax at a time\nwhen she was secured to her chair with the adhesive tapes which\nDr Crandon habitually uses, and we consider therefore that that\nmethod of control is ineffective in preventing the medium from\nhandling objects on the table, and thus useless for its piirpose.\n^ Psychic Research, xxiv. 262. \u2022\n^ Both these Walter prints were made on 7 December. ;\n'\n\f117] The Margery MediumsMp and London Sittings 365\nII. The Production of the so-called \" Old Lady \"\nThumb Impression on 8 December.\nBy V. J. WOOLLEY.\nMy original intention was to publish no further comments on these\nsittings, which I regarded as exclusively Dr Crandon's investigation\nat which I was merely an onlooker. In his report however he has\ndescribed one particular experiment in which I was allowed to take\na leading part, and it seems possible that some of his readers may\nbe led to believe that I endorse the account there given.\nThe experiment in question consisted in the making by Walter\nof a thumb impression which was said to be that of a well-known\nlady who had died recently, but whose name was not given. At\nthe sitting Walter announced that the impression would be made\nwhile the medium's hands were held by Dr Brown and myself.\nThe account dictated by Dr Crandon at the time is so inadequate\nthat it even fails to mention, except quite indirectly, in reporting\nWalter, the fact that two pieces of wax, which in Part I of this paper\nwere distinguished as B and C, were used during the evening.\nIn Part I of this paper has been given our own account of the\nevents of the sitting, and I will later consider how this can be checked\nby reference to admitted facts. Before the sitting began I was asked\nby Dr Crandon to provide myself with several pieces of Kerr wax,\neach difierently marked. I marked three pieces by making deep\nnotches in the side. The three pieces were marked with one, two\nand three notches respectively, and the notches could easily be felt\nand coimted in the dark. I miderstood from Dr Crandon that I was\nto keep these markings secret and not show them to any other sitter.\nThe first important event was the placing by me in the hot water\nof the first piece of wax. I am quite confident that this was the\npiece marked with one notch and distinguished as B. The red light\nwas then turned out, and after an interval Walter said that the water\nwas too cold and this piece was spoiled. Lord Charles Hope was\nthen directed to put hot water into the dish and Dr Crandon and\nMrs Brackenbury left the seance-TOom. I took the medium's right\nhand, as described in the published notes, having first put into the\nhot water the second piece of wax marked with two notches, and\ndistinguished as C.\nAfter an interval Walter said that the impression was made and\ndirected Dr Brown to take the wax o& the table. Dr Brown first\npicked up the old half A2 from the previous sitting which had been\non the table throughout, and then the piece which Walter said was\nthe one on which the Old Lady had impressed her thumb.\nLater in the sitting a hard object fell on the floor, and when this was\n\f366 The Margery MecUumship and London Sittings [part\nexamined afterwards it was found to consist of one and a half cakes\nof Kerr wax squeezed together. It obviously consisted of one of tlie\ntwo cakes softened during this sitting, together with the old half\ncake from the night before. At the close of the sitting, when I\nwas able to examine in light the so-called Old Lady impression, I\nfound that it had only one notch, and therefore was the first piece of\nwax softened and not the second.\nThere were only two possible alternative explanations of the facts\nI had observed. The first was that I had made an inexcusable\nbkmder and had miscounted my own marks on the wax, putting\nthe double notched piece C into the water thinking it was the single\nnotched one B. The second was that Walter was in error in his\nassertions that the impression was made on the second piece of wax\nand that the first piece was spoiled. In the bustle and excitement\nof the sitting I saw no way to decide between these two alternatives,\nand in fact it was some time before the matter became clear. As the\nsequence of events is somewhat confusing I propose to give a brief\nstatement of that sequence in the form of numbered paragraphs.\n1 . At the beginning of the sitting there is on the table a half cake\nof wax, A2, which had been softened and squeezed together\non the previous day.\n2. The first piece B or C is put into the hot water.\n3. It is taken out of the hot water by Walter, who says the water\nis too cold. (It is impossible to suppose that it was left in\nthe hot water dish, which had to be refilled, and where it\nmight adhere to and interfere with the second piece.)\n4. The hot water dish is refilled : a second piece of wax, C or B, is\nput into it and the medium's hands are held by Dr Brown\nand myself.\n5. Dr Brown is directed to pick up the finished impression. He\npicks up the old half piece A2 which was on the table from\nthe previous day.\n6. He finds what is said to be the right impression and hands it\nto me.\n7. The medium's hands are let go by Dr Brown and me, and Mrs\nBrackenbury and Dr Crandon return to the seance-ioom.\n8. After some remarks from Walter he says \" Here you are,\nWooUey,\" and something is heard to fall on the floor. On\nbeing picked up after the sitting this is found to consist of\nthe old half piece A2 which Dr Brown had picked up fixst\nand a whole piece C, the two being squeezed firmly into one.\nNow if Walter is correct in saying that the impression was made\non the second piece of wax, it necessarily follows that the piece\nsqueezed up with the old half piece was the first piece which he said\n\f117] The Margery Mediumship and London Sittings 367\nwas spoiled. But this first piece was taken out of the water (which\nhe said was too cold to soften it properly) in paragraph 3 above.\nIt ought to have been cooling on the table, or in the cold water,\nthrough all the events detailed in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6, because up\nto this point the half piece (which was afterwards squeezed up with\nit) was still separate, and was picked up by Dr Brown. Actually\nthe combined one and a half pieces have been squeezed up when one\nof them at any rate was very soft, as can be seen from the complete\nobliteration of the original outlines. It would have been quite\nimpossible to squeeze so completely a piece of wax which had been\ncooling for so long.\nThese considerations seem to me to make it quite clear that the\nsecond alternative I mentioned was the correct one and that I had\nnot made any mistake in my marked pieces of wax.\nAt the time however I had neither the various data which have\naccumulated since nor the time to consider what data I had. All\nI could do was to dictate a very guarded note which I print below,\nand which, so far as it goes, bears out my present statement that I\nhad noticed the notch on the wax and was not inclined to agree with\nWalter's claim without further evidence :\n\" Dr Crandon was not in\nthe seance-room from the time that the second marked piece of wax\nwas put into the dish until the time of the picking up of the impressed\npiece by Dr Brown.\" As soon as I was satisfied as to the fate of the\ntwo pieces of wax I communicated my opinion to Dr Crandon by\nletter of 30 January, at the same time that I informed him of the\npresence on the spoilt wax of the medium's finger impression which\nforms the subject of Part I of this paper.\nI have given above a summary of the course of events during the\nsitting and have tried to show that their time relations are incon-\nsistent with the claim which Walter made. I have now to consider\nhow far that sequence is consistent with my view that the impression\nwas made on the first piece and not on the second.\nI suggest that the first piece B was softened in the usual way and\nwas impressed with the thumb mark which it now bears. It was\nthen left on the table between the cold water dish and the medium,\nthere being also present near the dish the old half piece of wax A2\nfrom the previous sitting. Walter then announced that the wax was\nspoiled and that the second piece C would be impressed by the Old\nLady while the medium's hands were held. The second piece was\naccordingly put in the hot water dish by me and remained there\nuntil after the first piece B, bearing the impression, had been picked up\nby Dr Brown and the medium's hands were released. At some point\nafter this the second piece C was taken out of the hot water and\nsqueezed up with the old half piece A2. From the fact that it now\nbears the impression of the medium's finger I deduce that Walter\n\f368 The Margery MediumsMp and London Sittings [part 117]\nused the medium's right hand to squeeze it up. It was then thrown\non the floor very soon after the return of Dr Crandon to the seance-\nroom.\nThese suggestions seem to me to be consistent both with the\nsequence of events and with the present condition of the pieces of\nwax. The claim that the \" Old Lady \" print was made on the\nsecond piece of wax seems consistent with neither.\nIn conclusion, it seems worth while to draw attention to one\ndetail in which the procedure at this sitting deviated from that\nusually followed by Dr Crandon. It is usual, I believe, for the hot\nwater dish to be filled in red light : this is obviously more convenient\nand safer. On this occasion complete darkness was maintained\nfrom the time that the first piece was put into the hot water until\nafter Dr Crandon's return to the room. If I am right in suggesting\nthat the finished Old Lady impression was lying on the table at the\ntime when the hot water dish was being refilled for the second cake\nof wax, there is sufficient reason for Walter's maintaining complete\ndarkness during that part of the experiment.\n\fEEVIEW.\nHenry Monnier, Etude medicate de quelques giierisons smvenues d\nLourdes. 8vo, pp. 67, 6 ill. Paris : Editions Medicales N.\nMaloine, 1930. Price M fr.\nThe above work is a \" these pour le doctorat \". Dr Monnier\n(of Neuilly-sur-Seine) defended it before tlie Paris Faculty of Medi-\ncine on 7 April 1930 with complete success (\" Mention tres honor-\nable \"). This fact is perhaps as interesting in a way as the cures\nthemselves. We are not sure that it was the first time a physician\nselected the Lourdes phenomena for his thesis ; but even granted\nthat Dr Monnier had predecessors in this respect, these must have\nbeen very few indeed.\nWe heartily congratulate the learned Faculty on the toleration\nand breadth of view manifested by it in admitting so unorthodox\na thesis ; in this we concur mutatis mutandis with a personality of\nno less exalted rank than Pope Pius XI, to whom the writer\u2014a most\ndevout Roman Catholic\u2014sent a copy of his work, and who, in thank-\ning Dr Monnier, expresses the opinion in a letter signed by his Car-\ndinal Secretary of State (which letter is reproduced in the volume\nin facsimile) that the aforesaid admission is a \" happy symptom \".\nDr Monnier's religious fervour is fm'ther attested by the fact of\nhis \" study \" being dedicated inter alia to Jesus \" Christ, Saviour\nand Master \", the Virgin Mary and the (Roman Catholic) Church.\nThis circumstance will possibly prejudice against him some of our\nmembers. Though I can miderstand their standpoint, I prefer\nwelcoming the author's frankness and sincerity. I will also avail\nmyself of this opportunity respectfully to remind those members\nthat in the present phase of its existence Dr Monnier's Church by\nno means views alleged contemporary \" miracles \" with undue\nfavour. It is true that the Lourdes phenomena seem to be privileged\nin this respect (though belief in them is not defide), but the attitude\nof that Church towards the Konnersreuth stigmatica, for instance,\nis a proof of its present circumspection, a circumspection which in\nsome other cases has been akin to hostility. It would be therefore\nunjust, I think, to regard the Roman Catholic fervour of Dr Monnier\nas detracting from the value of his observations and deductions.\nThese deal with three cases : that of Mme Augault, born at Craon\n369\n\f370 Review [part\n(Mayenne) in 1877, cured in August 1926 ; that of Charlotte\nRenauld, born in 1874, cured in 1892 (this case was investigated by\nthe writer's father, Dr Louis Monnier) ; and that of Mile Emilie\nCailleux, specially observed by Dr Pierre Goret, cured in August\n1921.\nIn the first case\u2014the only one, so far as I can see, which appears\nin print for the first time\u2014we have to do with a fibroma, whose\nexistence is attested by four physicians ; in Charlotte Renauld's\ncase with a shortening by three centimetres of her left leg (this\nshortening seems to have beg\\m, by the way, in the patient's\nfifteenth year : a circumstance which in the eyes of some may be\nan argument in favour of its \"hysterical\" character); in Mile\nCailleux's case with Pott's disease and Paraplegia (besides Dr Goret\nwho specially investigated this case we have attestations of other\nphysicians too). All the three patients were cured at Lourdes, the\ntwo first apparently instantaneously, the third more gradually, and\nthese cures appear to have been definitive.\nThere seems to be no reasonable doubt that viewed from the\nstandpoint of orthodox medicine they are \" absolutely extraordinary\n'\n'\n(Dr L. Monnier on the Charlotte Renauld case). Nature does not\nproduce such results even with time at its disposal, Dr Goret thinks\nd propos of some particulars of Mile Cailleux's case.\nSome readers will no doubt regret that only in the Augault case\nhas our author been to a certain extent (a very limited one) in\npersonal contact with the patient. (Mme Augault's ordinary\nphysician was Dr Faligant, who informed Dr Monnier in December\n1929 that since her return from Lourdes he had not to attend her\nat all). Whatever may be thought on that particular point, I for\nmy part do not hesitate to state that I am ready to accept these\nthree cures\u2014as well as several others of the same character\u2014on\ntheir face value. I am willing to believe the medical evidence\nadduced in this and some other cases adequate. I have almost no\ndoubt that the cures were effected by means of which we know little\n\u2014if anything\u2014and which seem to be entirely, or almost entirely,\nbeyond our control at present. But more than this it does not seem\nto me safe to assert.\nDr Monnier is no doubt right in showing (in the chapter entitled\n\" La cause de ces guerisons \") that suggestion, as he understands\nit, had nothing to do with the results. Mme Augault, for instance,\n\" if suggestion had the power attributed to it by some, would have\ndied at Lourdes \", in consequence of what Dr Faligant had cate-\ngorically stated to her. But of course only direct suggestion can be\nmeant here. Also more or less direct autosuggestion which the\nwriter also attempts to disprove (pp. 53-55). Emilie Cailleux, he\nsays, did not ask to be sent to Lourdes, she merely consented to go\n\f117] Review 371\nthere. It is true that she seems to have had complete confidence in\nthe Virgin Mary (\" Ces quelques lignes ne sont pour ainsi dire,\nqu'mie repetition du mot : confiance \"), but she had no initiative,\nand merely let \" events come \". As to Charlotte Renauld, \" psycho-\nlogical documents \" bearing on her case are missing, and so Dr\nMonnier \" abandons her to those who think that an act of her will\ncould have suddenly added the three missing centimetres to her\ninferior limb \"\n(p. 55).\nHere I cannot follow the author, I confess. And his line of\nreasoning does not convince me. Primo : How does he know that\nautosuggestion cannot produce in our organism profoimd modifica-\ntions stich as have never been provoked nor are likely to be induced,\nat least for a very long time to come if ever, by direct suggestion ?\nSecundo : Why identify autosuggestion with the patient's conscious\nwill, conscious convictions or conscious expectations ? These may\nhelp ; but why should they be indispensable ?\nOn the other hand : that stigmata a la Therese Neumann\u2014to\nreturn to her\u2014may be due not to a \" miracle \", that is to the\nintervention of a superhuman entity, but to recondite psychological\nand physiological processes will now be admitted even by many of\nDr Monnier's co-religionists. Out of some 300 stigmatised persons\nknown to history only a fraction have been canonised by the Roman\nCatholic Church, which proves that even Roman Catholics are by\nno means bound to regard stigmata -per se as of a supernatural\norigin. It is true that from them to some of the Lourdes \" miracles\n\"\nthere seems at times a very long way ; but may we not suspect that\nthe difference is not so much qualitative as quantitative ?\nThe more I think on these matters the more I am inclined tenta-\ntively to postulate as a working hypothesis that religious faith may\nbe one of the most powerful factors in human existence. I will\ncompare it in this respect to the sexual instinct. The latter, which\nis much more powerful, still creates life incessantly and everywhere.\nReligious faith on the other hand is apt, we may suppose, to affect\nliving tissues, to fathom the depths both of the human psyche and\nof the human physical organism, to produce in both radical changes\nin a way of which we have barely an idea. Why can it tap in this\nfashion the hidden energies of the ego ? We do not know. It is\none more mystery of Nature, but a mystery for whose reality there\nis, I think, some little evidence.\nOf course there must be limits to the power of religious feeling.\nIt will never cause a house or a mountain to move, any more than\nit will bring a dead man back to life. I also strongly suspect that\nif I have my right hand chopped off, no amount of faith will cause\nit to coalesce again with my arm. But, barring these extreme cases,\nI think that we should be very circumspect as to what faith, religious\n\f372 Review [part\nfeeling, can or cannot achieve in a diseased human body, especially\nin particularly appropriate surroundings (sucli as Lourdes), where\nwe may tentatively suppose there may have accumulated in the\ncourse of years something like a huge reservoir of mysterious\npsychical elements laden with latent potentialities. At times, in a\nway of which we know as yet nothing, some of these elements, in a\nmoment of high tension (induced by a religious procession carrying\nthe Blessed Sacrament, for instance) will possibly \" explode \" \u2014and\na sudden cure may be the resiilt. We have, of course, no evidence\nthat such a psychic reservoir exists, but I submit that its reality is\nnevertheless much more plausible than for instance that of a cosmic\nreservoir of memories in which some people are inclined to believe !\nIf we postulate such an hypothesis, faith direct and conscious\nneed not by any means be a sine qua non, though surely, as I said,\nit may contribute to the cures. So much for Dr Monnier's assertion\nthat the three cases he has analysed had the \" Christian Faith \" as\ntheir cause. Let us now turn to his conclusion (pp. 61-63).\nIn the first we are told that the malades in question, afflicted as\nthey were with various functional and organic troubles acknowledged\nby their physicians to be either inc\\irable or \" very slowly curable\nhave been suddenly cured. As to this I have practically no doubt.\nFrom which Dr Monnier draws two practical conclusions : (a) A\nphysician nmst not advise patients whose state can not be improved\nby his methods and those of his confreres, not to go to Lourdes ;\n(6) he is not to be blamed if he advised them to go there. Few of\nus\u2014and I least of all\u2014will be inclined to dispute this.\nOn the other hand, I cannot agree with Dr Monnier when he\ncontinues (conclusion 3, a) :\n\" If we call them (the cures) spon-\ntaneous, if we say that they have been caused by unknown natural\nforces, we shall merely veil our ignorance with words, but shall not\nexjDlain them.\"\nI do not think we shall deserve this reproach if we postulate\ntentatively, as I have done, that there is some evidence to show that\nby itself religious belief\u2014apart from its supposed \" truth \" ^\n\u2014is a\nvery potent factor not only of psychological but also of physiological\norder, to whose operation limits should not be too hastily assigned.\nIn conclusion 3, b, we read inter alia that the malades had not been\nsubmitted to any psychotherapeutic action which besides \" could\nnot have cured them owing to the nature of their disease \". If here\nsuggestion in some form or other is meant the writer is very probably\nright, but this is quite beside the point, as I have attempted to show.\nIn conclusion 4 Dr Monnier notes that the state of the three\n^ Into the very interesting question why this evidence apjjears to be much\nmore abundant m the Roman CathoUc confession than in others I purposely\ndo not enter here.\n\f117] Review 373\npatients had been either stationary or had grown worse oxxtside of\nLourdes ;\n\" loin de la cause presumee pas de guerison \" ; therefore\nthe \" Christian faith \" was the cause of the cures in question.\nThe last formula is\u2014involiuitarily\u2014far too vague, not to say too\ndiplomatic : for no intelligent agnostic\u2014other agnostics do not\ninterest me\u2014would, I think, refuse to subscribe to it, granting the\nfacts adduced to be real. It is obvious that, whatever the explana-\ntion finally adopted, the \" Christian \" {i.e. Roman Catholic) religion\nhas something to do with the cures. But from this it does not\nlogically at all follow that the latter prove that religion to be the\ntrue one. Now, though Dr Monnier does not say so expressis verbis,\nhe obviously had in mind something of the kind. His formula is\ntherefore inadequate from his standpoint.\nI am not sure that the argument that the malades had not re-\ncovered outside of Lourdes (\" Loin de Lourdes, ou d'un lieu equiva-\nlent, aucune de ces malades ne gu6rissait avant longtemps, si tant\nest que I'une d'elles eut gueri \", p. 59), is quite sound imder the pen\nof a convinced Roman Catholic : for surely Dr Monnier believes\nthat his Church can work cures everywhere\nIn conclusion 5 we read (p. 63) :\n\" If it be objected to us that we\nare here outside the domain of medicine, we shall answer that\nscience has no other limits than those of being : no truth is foreign\nto the physician.\"\nBravo ! Let therefore the Lourdes \" miracles \" be investigated\nin the same spirit in which all phenomena of Nature should be. Let\nthere be on one side due reverence, complete objectivity and\nreadiness to account any conclusion warranted by adequate obser-\nvation, even if such a conclusion were peculiarly unpalatable to the\nobservers ; on the other side let there be willingness to acquiesce in\nall reasonable conditions and to admit that the investigators have\nthe moral right to ask for criteria and tests of approximately the\nsame character as they would in any other sphere.\nConducted on such lines as these a scientific enquiry into the\nLourdes problem might be fruitful. Unfortunately I have my doubts\nas to the possibility of such an enquiry.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n\f\fREPORT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS IN CLAIR-\nVOYANCE CONDUCTED AT A DISTANCE UNDER\nAPPROXIMATELY FRAUD-PROOF CONDITIONS\nI.

INTRODUCTION, AND DESCRIPTION OF THE\nTECHNIQUE EMPLOYED\nBy Theodore Besterman '\nCards I tel you . . . they are parlous beasts.\n\u2014Hay any Worke for Cooper, f. iii v.\nIn December 1928 Miss Ina Jephson published [Proceedings, xxxviii.\n223-71) the results of a novel experiment in clairvoyance in the form\nof card-guessing. The conclusions which that experiment appeared\nto suggest were of considerable importance, but the percipients having\nbeen uncontrolled, various difficulties (described below by Mr Soal)\narose. It seemed important, therefore, to repeat the experiment,\nmaking use of a more evidential technique. Mr Soal's long-distance\nexperiments in telepathy coming to an end in February 1929, a\nvaluable opportunity presented itself to make use of his numerous\npercipients for the purpose of repeating Miss Jephson's experiment.\nSanction was obtained from the Council, and the investigation was\nundertaken by Miss Jephson, Mr Soal, and myself, jointly. The\nexperimental technique devised for the purpose of this experiment\nis described in the present part of our Report. In the next part\nMr Soal will deal with the scoring and with the statistical analysis of\nthe results. Finally, Miss Jephson will analyse the results theoretic-\nally and make suggestions for further experiments.\nIt must first be explained that the experiments reported on in the\npresent paper consist of five distinct series. The first, forming the\nmain part of the experiment, produced 6,361 guesses. The second\nconsisted of a small series, producing 200 guesses, which was con-\nducted with the eight percipients in the first series whose scores\npresented positive deviations greater than 2 x SD. The third series\nwas conducted with 95 members of the Boston S.P.R., producing\n2,031 guesses. The fourth series was conducted by Professor\nGardner Murphy at Columbia University with 157 percipients and\nproduced 784 guesses. The fifth series was carried out by Professor\nJ. C. Flugel with 24 students of University College, London, pro-\nducing 120 guesses. For the sake of convenience and uniformity\nthese five series will be referred to throughout this paper as the\nJoint, Supplementary, Boston, Murphy, and Flugel series, and Miss\nJephson's original experiment will be referred to by her name.\nThese particulars are tabidated in Table I.\n\f118] Introduction, Description of Technique Employed 311\nTable I\nName of Experiment.\nNo. of\nPercipients.\nNo. of\nGuesses.\nJoint . . . .\nSupplementary .\nBoston\nMurphy\nFlugel\nTotal .\n283\n8\n95\n157\n24\n6,361\n200\n2,031\n784\n120\n5671 9,496\nProceeding now to a description of the technique, it is necessary\nto emphasise again at the outset a point to which attention has\nalready been drawn in the title of this paper : that the technique\ndevised for these experiments does not purport to be strictly fraud-\nproof so far as the percipients are concerned ; nor do I believe that\nit would be possible to devise such a technique. What himian\ningenuity could devise, human ingenuity could circumvent. As in\nthe classic illustration of this fact, the unsinkable battleship always\ngoes to the bottom in the long run, and the irresistible gun is resisted.\nOur aim was not so much absolutely to prevent any possible fraud\non the part of the percipients, as to prevent the more or less innocent\nforms of fraud due to thoughtlessness and to vanity, or to a misplaced\nsense of humour. It was also intended to make fraud so difficult as\nto make it probable that cases of successful fraud, if any, would be\nso few as not to affect the cumulative result. And I may as well\nsay here, once and for all, that although we think we succeeded in\ndoing this, we have no reason whatever to suppose that any of our\npercipients either wished or attempted to deceive us.\nSo far as the percipients were concerned, therefore, we were per-\nforce content with conditions that were only approximately fraud-\nproof. But we introduced a novel feature into the experiments :\nwe devised means to make them to all intents and purposes fraud-\nproof so far as the experimenters themselves, and their colleagues,\nwere concerned. In ordinary scientific experiments the integrity\nof those conducting the investigation is assmned. Indeed, as\nProfessor Sidgwick pointed out in his fourth Presidential Address,-\nit is taken so very much as a matter of course that the assimiption\npasses unnoticed : it is nevertheless very real. A few cases are even\non record in recent years where this assimiption led to the acceptance\nof dishonest work.\n^ In this total the eight percipients who took part in the Supplementary\nseries of course appear twice.\n* Proceedings S.P.B. {1884:), a. 155.\n\f378 Theodore Besterman [part\nIn psychical researcli the position is different. The whole subject\nmatter of our researches is so doubtful and obscure, so widely\nquestioned, that where results have been published capable of a\nnormal explanation only by assuming the dishonesty of the investiga-\ntor, that assumption has been made as the lesser of the two evils.\nA good deal could be said as to the propriety of such an attitude,\nbut it is not my business to enter into that here. I have merely\nto explain that we thought it worth while to see whether it is possible\nto conduct such an investigation as the present one in such a way as\nto make it impossible for those conducting the experiment to fake\nthe results. This we undoubtedly succeeded in doing, as will be\nseen below, but only at the cost of so much unnecessary work and\nmisplaced ingenuity, that we should all be sorry to have to undergo\nthe experience again.\nAn important element in the technique employed was that of the\nmaterials used, a point to which a good deal of thought and research\nwere devoted. The main objective was to discover a comparatively\nfraud-proof and not too extravagantly costly method of sending\nplaying-cards through the post to a considerable number of per-\ncipients in such a way that literally nobody should know what cards\nwere being sent to the percipient.\nIt was assumed for the purpose of the experiment (since the\npossibility cannot be ruled out) that clairvoyance, if there is such a\nthing, obeys the laws of normal vision. The first thing to do,\ntherefore, was to avoid anything that might interfere with the clear\nvision of a playing-card enclosed in an envelope, supposing that\nwhat takes place is that the card is seen through the envelope. Now\na normal playing-card has a more or less elaborately coloured design\non the back, and this would clearly prove a difficulty, an important\nobject of these designs being in fact to prevent the cards being seen\nthrough while being played. A special supply of cards of strong\nquality and with blank backs was therefore obtained from the\nUniversal Playing Card Company Ltd., Crown Point Works, Leeds.\nThe next point to be considered was that of the envelopes in which\nthe cards were to be enclosed. It was necessary that it should not\nbe possible, on the one hand, to open and reclose the envelope\nwithout leaving distinct traces, and, on the other hand, to see\nnormally the playing-card while it was in the envelope. These two\nnecessities were met jointly thus : (1) An envelope was used of such\na size that the playing-card fitted into it exactly, giving it no free\nplay at all ; (2) the envelope was made of a strong but rather coarse\ntextured paper which offers a very good surface for adhesive pur-\nposes, and which cannot be rendered transparent by strong light,\nX-rays, water, alcohol, ether or the like ; (3) the envelopes used\nwere blue, so that the coloiir woidd not interfere with, or suggest,\n\fThe actual eolonr of tlie envelopes is rather darker and of the strip.\npaper rather lighter.\n\fKm;. 2\nThv actual coluur of the cmcldpcs ix i-atlicr darker and of (he strips of\npap<'i- i-a(her lighter.\n\f118] Introduction, Description of Technique Employed 379\nthe red and black of the playing cards ; (4) round the envelope was\nplaced by the manufacturers a strip of figured paper such as is used\nfor cheques, the printing ink on such paper being liable to run if\nsubmitted to excessive moisture ; this strip began on the closed\nflap of the envelope and ran all round the envelope, projecting about\nhalf-an-inch over the open flap of the envelope (see Fig. 1) so\nthat when closed the upper flap was pasted on to one end of the\nstrip and the projecting end also came down on the strip. The\ncolour of this strip was grey on white ; (5) when the envelope was\nclosed a piece of dark blue tissue paper was gummed on to the back\nof the envelope, entirely covering the opening. This tissue paper\nshows the slightest moisture and cannot be removed without leaving\ntraces ; (6) finally, the Society's relief stamp was impressed on the\nenvelope, marking both sides of it and consequently the card con-\ntained in it (see Fig. 2). These envelopes with the strips attached,\nready for closing, were manufactured for us by Messrs Alfred H.\nAtkins Ltd, Fetter Lane, London.\nI now turn to the preparation of the envelopes for despatch.\nThe empty envelopes having been delivered at the Rooms of the\nSociety, Miss Jephson and I, with Miss Newton, Miss Horsell, and\nMiss Carruthers, assembled in the Secretary's Room. A quantity\nof playing-cards was placed face downwards on the table and the\ncards were placed by us face downwards in the envelopes, having been\nsupplied already shuffled. The cards and envelopes were of course\nall alike and, to all intents and purposes, indistinguishable. When\na sufi&cient number of envelopes had been thus filled, they were sent\nto Mudie's Bookbinding Department, New Oxford Street, London,\nand were there closed down with a specially prepared paste of a\nparticularly adhesive quality. They were then returned to us. At\nthis point already there was nobody who knew what any particular\nenvelope contained, unless one or more of the five persons who placed\nthe cards in the envelopes had been able, in the presence of the others,\nto make a secret mark on one or more envelopes and now had the\nopportunity (none of us in fact had) to search these out from the\nparcels of closed envelopes returned to us by Mudie's. The envelopes\nhad been sent to Mudie's, and were returned by them, in no particular\norder. Even if the course described had been possible it would have\nbeen useless, as will be seen.\nThe next process was to stamp the envelopes with some identify-\ning mark to enable us to keep track of them. After much discussion\na combination of letters was decided on. Letters were preferred to\nnumbers so as to avoid any possibility of the percipient being influ-\nenced in his guess by the number on the envelope. For the same\nreason the letter A (suggesting Ace) was avoided. The identifying\nmarks thus were BB, BC . . . CB, and so on ; a number of three-\n\f380 Theodore Besterman '\n'\n'\n[paet\nletter marks were also used as the two-letter combinations were\nexhausted. Each of these combinations was stamped on five\nenvelopes, since a set of five guesses was to form the unit of the\nexperiment. In order to preserve the identity and sequence of the\nenvelopes in each set of five, they were distinguished by writing the\nletters v, w, x, y, z respectively, on the backs of the envelopes.\nAt the same time a scoring slip for each set was stamped with its\nidentification mark.\nAt this point the only person who may have known the contents\nof any of the envelopes was myself, for the whole of the stamping\nwas done by me. I was therefore the only one who had the oppor-\ntunity, while stamping the envelopes, to recognise marks which I\nmight previously have made on them while placing the cards in\nthem. This knowledge, however, would have been of no use to me\nunless I could now arrange for the marked envelopes or sets of enve-\nlopes to be sent to specific percipients with whom I should have\narranged a conspiracy and whom I would then inform what cards\nwere contained in the envelopes they were about to receive. (So\nfar as I am aware I have not met any of Mr Soal's percipients\nexcept in the most casual way.) All this was rendered impossible.\nThe appropriate scoring slip, instructions, and a stamped envelope\naddressed to the Society, were placed with each set of five cards\nand safeguarded with an elastic band. In the meanwhile, a set of\nouter envelopes, in which the sets of five were to be sent through\nthe post to the percipients, had been prepared by Miss Carruthers.\nThese outer envelopes and the sets of five were then handed to\nLieut.-Colonel Maxwell Dick, M.B., B.S., LL.B., who shuffled both\nthe sets and the envelopes as he pleased, and who put the sets into\nthe envelopes, in the presence of Miss Carruthers. At this stage,\ntherefore, not only did nobody know, but nobody could have known,\nwhat card was contained in any envelope (assuming, of course, that\nthere was no general conspiracy between the investigators, their\ncolleagues, and Cols. Dick and Hayward, for the latter of whom see\np. 384 below).\nThe instructions sent out with the first set were as follows (drafted,\nit will be realised, to interest the percipients) :\n\" It has long been believed that there is some connection between\nthe mental faculties of Telepathy and of Clairvoyance or second sight.\n\" As our experiments in Telepathy are now coming to an end,\nthe opportunity seems a favourable one for testing the theory that\ngood telepathists are also good clairvoyants.\n\" I am therefore asking for your kind help in a few simple experi-\nments that can be carried out in your own time at any moment\nwhen you are free. We hope to begin the experiments as soon as\npossible after the Easter holidays. ; .\n\f118] Introduction, Description of Technique Employed 381\n\" Briefly, the scheme is this : Five sealed envelopes, marked\nV.W.X.Y.Z. [this should have been v.w.x.y.z.] will be sent to you,\neach containing an ordinary playing card. You will be asked not\nto open the envelopes but to return them with seals unbroken,\ntogether with a record of your impressions of what each hidden card\nis, within, say, the course of a week.\n\" The experiment (which will not tie you down to any fixed times\nof concentration, as did the telepathy tests) will then be repeated\nwith 5 fresh envelopes during the following week, until three or four\nsuch sets of results have been obtained.\n\" Will you kindly let us know, when sending in your last set of\nTelepathy impressions, whether you are able to take part in this\nadditional experiment 1 We shall then send you detailed instruc-\ntions [these were not foimd necessary]. As it will he one of the most\nimportant of its hind ever attempted in Psychical Research, we shall\ngreatly appreciate your help.\"\nWith the second to the fifth sets the following form was sent :\n\" We are enclosing the [fourth] set of five envelopes for the\nClairvoyant Experiment, and would be glad if you would kindly\nreturn them with your scoring slip and nimiber as soon as possible.\"\nWhen the first sets had been returned, with the scoring-slips\ncompleted, in the addressed envelopes supplied to percipients.\nColonel Maxwell Dick opened the outer envelopes, took out each set\nof blue envelopes, examined it, and called out the identification\nmark to Miss Carruthers, together with the identification number\nof the percipient. Miss Carruthers then stuck the completed\nscoring-slips, which had been prepared with a gummed edge, on to\nthe record sheets prepared for each percipient. In this way the\noriginal record made of his own guesses by the percipient was pre-\nserved and formed the basis of the subsequent scoring (Fig. 3).\nThe sets of envelopes (except a few disqualified because of damage\nin the post) were then added to the remaining stock, from which the\nsecond week's set had in the meanwhile been sent out. The same\nprocedure was followed for the second, third, fourth and fifth sets of\nfive. WTien the great majority of the fifth set of five envelopes had\nbeen returned by the percipients the time came to open the blue\nenvelopes (the contents of which were of course still unknown) and\nto enter the actual card against the guesses made by the percipients\non their scoring-slips. The opening of the envelopes was conducted\nwith elaborate precautions. As Colonel Dick opened each envelope\nand called out the card contained in it he was watched and checked\nby one of the investigators (who took turn and turn about in this\nand the other duties I am describing). The entering of the cards so\ncalled out was done by Miss Carruthers, tmder similar supervision.\nIn this way, humanly speaking, no error can have been made.\n\f382 Theodore Besterman [part\nName\nAddress\n91\nDate Imp Rcmaiks. etc.\nNumber Cj \u00a7\nDate Sep Zj'f ICjUj^\nTime\nBtfon Guessing\nFirst Card .\nAA7 .\n1 IME\nAjter Guessing\nLast Card.\nNtimber Cj ^\nEL.\nCard Sccrz\nw\n^^^^\nX Id HtM&\ny\ns\nBe'iori GuJssing\nFirst Card\nAfter Guessing\nLest Card\nTime\nNumber O ^\nDate QiJ- b'^ ISi\n1\n(OSice uw onXj)\nNuttiber\nDaU :fuda^ ^ \/^tj\nSCORR\n( Office itae ofdy)\nTime\nAfter Guessing\nLast Card\nNu\u00abibc-r ^' f\nD.

There the envelopes and cards will\nremain until the publication of this report, after which they will be\npreserved in the Rooms of the Society.\nWhen the whole of the percipients' sheets had been completed so\nfar as possible, from them were prepared, with the same elaborate\nprecautions, duplicate sets, independently compiled and checked,\nof records showing the history of each set of five envelopes. A\nsection of these records is reproduced in Table II, in the third column\nof which are shown the percipients who received the sets ;\nthus, QO\nwas sent to percipient no. 519 the first week, to no. 120 the second\nweek, and so on.

Colonel Dick was obliged by\npressure of other duties to give up this extremely lengthy, tedious\nand laborious work, and was replaced by Lieut.-Colonel W. D.\nHayward, M.B. The Society's best thanks are due to these two\ngentlemen, who put in a vast amount of work of the dullest and most\n\f118] Introduction, Description of Technique Employed 385\nboring kind imaginable, with the utmost conscientiousness and with\nimrelaxing attention. The exhaustive reports prepared by Col.\nDick on his work are available for inspection in the Rooms of the\nSociety.\nThe conduct of the Murphy series can be easily gathered from the\nfollowing instructions, which were prepared by Professor Murphy :\n1. Each subject receives a pack of 5 blue envelopes, held together\nby an elastic.\n2. The subjects are informed that each envelope contains a card\nfrom an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards. Removing the\nelastic, each envelope is to be held for a moment by the subject,\nwho is told simply to make a random guess as to what card it\ncontains and to record the guess, immediately, on the front\nface of the envelope. The cards are to be guessed in the order\nin which they come ; and it is important that, when putting\non the elastic again, they make doubly sure that the envelopes\nare in the order in which they were received.\n3. If the subjects take more than 30 seconds to do the series of\nguesses, hurry them up, telling them \" not to go into a trance,\nbut to guess at random.'\"\n4. When the guesses are all recorded, each subject returns his pack\nof 5, in the right order with the elastic on it, to the instructor.\nTo this need only be added that the blue envelopes in this series\nwere separately obtained by Professor Murphy, and were not the\nsame as those used in the Joint, Supplementary, Boston, and Flugel\nseries.\nThe Flugel series was conducted in the same way as that of\nProfessor Murphy, except that our own blue envelopes were used.\nII. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n- \u2022\nBy S. a. SoAL\nWe must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us.\n\u2014Hamlet, V. i.\n1. Introduction. The Jephson experiment produced some inter-\nesting results. The deviations from the expected numbers in the\ncategories of Colour, Suit and Value were so great as to make it\ncertain that some factor other than chance had operated in favour\nof successful guessing. The following table gives a brief summary of\nthese important deviations.\n\f386 S. G. Soal [part\nTable IV\n[No. of guesses = Q, 000.]\nDeviation Deviation\nActual Number from Standard\nfjcTtectftf] Expoctcd T)ftvifl,tinn\nJL^ ^ V ^CU 11.. O Vailiyj-cLl. vJ.\nNumber.

We have\ntherefore either to postulate the existence of a widespread faculty\nof clairvoyance possessed by a large percentage of the human race\nand hitherto unnoticed by science or else to envisage alternative\nexplanations. These alternatives readily suggest themselves. The\nlarge majority of the persons who performed the Jephson experi-\nment did so in their own homes using their own cards and under no\nsupervision by the experimenter.\nWe may readily envisage one or more of the following possibilities\noperating in favour of successful results. We may suppose :\n(a) A considerable proportion of the percipients failed to carry\nout Miss Jephson's instructions. Instead of making and recording\nthe five guesses prescribed for each sitting these percipients per-\nformed many more than five, and either selected their best guesses\nor waited till a run of success appeared before recording their five\nguesses.\n(&) A considerable percentage of the percipients used cards\nwhose backs were worn or soiled, and of such a nature as to lead to\nunconscious associations of the face values with slight markings on\nthe backs.\n(c) Careless manipulation of the cards coupled with hyperaes-\nthesia of vision enabled certain percipients to glimpse and partially\nor wholly to read the faces of the cards.\n{d) Deliberate faking of results on the part of percipients.\nI do not for a moment suggest that {d) operated to any serious\nextent. I merely envisage it as a theoretical possibility. I would\n\f118] Statistical Analysis 387\nindeed be the last to take sucli a lamentable view of human nature\nand I think it far more probable that conditions (a), (6) and (c) pre-\nvailed in varying degrees. After reading Miss Jephson's paper I felt\nit urgent that her experiment should be repeated under conditions\nof control which would definitely exclude possibilities (a), (6) and (c),\nand render (d) at least difficult. As described by Mr Besterman,\nan opportunity to do this soon occurred and the present report is the\nresult.\n2. System of scoring. This system of scoring adopted throughout\nthe present series of experiments is based on the revised scheme\ngiven by Dr Fisher in an Appendix to Miss Jephson's first paper\n(Proceedings, xxxviii. 269-271) thus :\nTable V\nPlain Card Said.\nPicture Card Said.\n[King, Queen or Knave]\nCategory (Score Category \/Score\n00 \u202273 POO 1-70\nOK 3-78 FOR 16-45\noc 8-79 POC 8-67\nCR 11-84 PGR 23-42\nOS 16-85 POS 15-64\nSR 19-89 PSR 30-39\nON 30-54 PON 27-50\nNC 38-60 PNO 34-47\nNS 46-65 PNS 41-44\nThe individual scores are so adjusted that the theoretical Mean of\nn guesses is 11-18 and the Standard Deviation of the Mean of n\nguesses from 11-18 is\nThus the Standard Deviation of the Mean Score of 25 guesses\n= -^==2 and the theoretical distribution is approximately normal\nfor 25.\nWith a set of 25 guesses the Mean Score would by chance alone\nfall outside the limits (7-18-15-18) {i.e. 11-18 \u00b14) about once in\n20 sets.\n3. Method of Scoring. The 6,361 guesses in the Joint experiment\nwere scored by myself between August and October 1929. They\nwere independently scored under Miss Jephson's direction, and about\ntwo-thirds of the whole were also independently scored by\n\f388 S. Q. Soal [part\nBesterman. Each guess therefore has been scored independently\nat least twice. On 17 September, by which date about 6,168 guesses\nwere available, the Committee met to compare scores and totals.\nEach experimenter in turn read aloud the card categories, scores,\ntotals of 5 and complete totals from his set of the typewritten sheets\ndescribed by Mr Besterman (Table III), the two remaining experi-\nmenters following his reading from their own slips and stopping him\nat any discrepancy. In this way any mistakes that had been made\nwere corrected. Between 17 and 25 September a few more sets of\nenvelopes were returned and these were scored by all three experi-\nmenters at a Committee meeting held on 25 September. A few\nodd sets continued to arrive at intervals until 30 October, by which\ndate the whole of the 6,361 Joint guesses had been scored.\n4. Incomplete and Multiple Guesses. In the very rare cases in\nwhich a percipient gave two guesses for the same card the score was\nallocated to the first of the two guesses in order of recording, the\nsecond guess being ignored whether it was better than the first or\nnot.\nIn the case of a guess that was incomplete we made it a rule to\naward the lowest score that was consistent with the data at our\ndisposal\nThus the following examples are scored as shown :\nTable VI\nCard guessed.\nActual\nCard.\nClass. Score.\ndiamond lOh POC 8-67\nknave 3d POO 1-70\nace Kc 00 \u202273\nred ace . 3h CR 11-84\n44 such incomplete guesses occurred among the 6,361 Joint guesses.\nIt will be observed that in her analysis of card preferences Miss\nJephson quotes the total of the Joint guesses as 6,317. Since Miss\nJephson is only able to deal with complete guesses in her section of\nthe work, the difference between 6,361 and 6,317 is thus fully\naccounted for by the 44 incomplete guesses.\n5. The Scoring of the Boston Guesses. The scoring of the 2,031\nguesses produced by the Boston experiment was done under Miss\nJephson's direction.

These scores and totals have also been checked by Miss\nJephson herself.

Analysis of the Joint Experiment. 283 persons took part in\nthis experiment ; 276 of these were residents of the British Isles who\nduring the previous nine months had taken part in my mass experi-\nments in long-distance telepathy. The remaining seven were\nmembers of M. Rene WarcoUier's group in experimental telepathy\nand all of them had also acted as percipients in experiments with\nmy own group.\nA considerable percentage of the 276 British percipients had in\nSeptember 1928 written letters to the S.P.R. in which they claimed\nto have had spontaneous experiences in telepathy or clairvoyance\nor to have been successful in card-guessing. A small number of the\npercipients claimed to be automatic writers or spirit mediums.\nThe 283 sets of guesses sent in may be classified as follows :\nTable VII\n178 complete sets of 25 guesses each = 4450 guesses\n25 incomplete ,, \u201e 24 \u201e \u201e = 600\n6 \u201e 23 \u201e \u201e = 138\n1 \u201e 22 \u201e \u201e = 22\n3 \u201e 21 \u201e \u201e = 63\n35 \u201e 20 \u201e \u201e = 700\n6 \u201e 19 \u201e \u201e = 114\n5 \u201e 15 \u201e \u201e = 75\n3 \u201e U \u201e \u201e = 42\n1 \u201e 13 \u201e \u201e = 13\n8 \u201e 10 \u201e \u201e = 80\n1 \u201e 9 \u201e \u00bb = 9\n11 \u201e 5 \u201e \u201e = 55\n283 sets\nTotal number of guesses ;\nTotal score on Fisher's System =\nTheoretical Mean Score =\nActual Mean Score =\nDeviation =\nStandard Deviation from\n11-18 for 6361 guesses\n10\n6361 guesses\n: 6361\n: 70832-08\n: 11-18\n11-14\n-04\n\u202212\nHence Actual Deviation = one-third of Standard Deviation.\n\f390 S. G. Soal [part\nResult is therefore negative and there is no evidence of the\nexistence of any extra-chance factor.\n7. Analysis of Colour, Suit, Value and RanJc. We next proceed\nto inquire if there has been any general ability to detect the Colour,\nSuit, or Value of the card in the envelope or to recognise that the\ncard is a picture. The theoretical number of cases of Colour correct,\nSuit correct, Value correct, and Card absolutely correct will be\nobtained by multiplying the number of guesses (6,361) by 1\/2, 1\/4,\n1\/13 and 1\/52 respectively.\nNow, although complete packs of cards were used in filling the\nenvelopes it so happened that since certain percipients were more\npunctual than others in returning their envelopes some sets of 5\nwere sent out to percipients more often than others. Taking as our\nbasis for calculation the numbers of \" actual \" cards occurring, under\neach of the 13 values in Miss Jephson's Table ^ we find that there\nis a distinct excess of kings and a deficiency of queens. Each\n\" actual \" card ought theoretically to occur about 486 times with a\nstandard deviation from this mean of \u00b121. The numbers of all\nthe values except those of kifig and queen fall within the limits\n486 \u00b12x21. But the king occurs 569 times and the queen 441\ntimes.\nThe total number of actual cards of Red colour =3179.\nThe total number of actual cards of Black colour = 3182.\nThe difference between Red and Black is so small that we may\nsafely use the factor |> = 1 \/2 in estimating the expected number of\ncolour correct.\nAgain the expected number of each suit among the \" actual\n\"\ncards is about 1590 with a standard deviation = \u00b134.\nA glance at Miss Jephson's Table shows that the numbers for the\ndifferent suits all fall within the limits 1590 \u00b12 x 34. We may\ntherefore without serious error take j) = l\/4 in estimating the\nexpected number of cards with suit correct.\nThe expected number of cases in which the \" guess \" and \" actual\n\"\ncards are both picture cards would theoretically be found by mul-\ntiplying the total number of picture or P-guesses by the factor 3\/13\n= -2308.\nOwing to the fact that the number of actual picture cards is\nslightly in excess of the theoretical number I have thought it best\nnot to use this factor but to count the number of actual picture cards\nand find the ratio this number bears to the total number of actual\ncards.\n1 This Table is not printed in the present paper, but will be available at a\nlater date, when certain investigations connected with it are completed.\n\f118] Statistical .Analysis 391\nI find :\nNumber of \" actual \" picture cards =1524\nTheoretical number = 3 \/IB x 6361 = 1468\n1524\nI tberefore take as my factor 73 = -\u2014\u2014 = -2396\nD.3ol\nNow actual number of P-guesses\nrecorded by percipients =1487\nHence the expected number of cases in which both the \" guess card\n\"\nand the \" actual card \" are pictures = 1487 x -2396 = 356.\nThe Standard Deviation for each category is calculated from the\nformula\n8.-D.=JNp{l-p)\nwhere iV* =total number of guesses = 6361 and p = l\/2, 1\/4, 1\/13,\n1\/52, in the case of Colour, Suit, Value and \" Card Correct \" res-\npectively.\nTable VIII.

In fact the highest deviations do no more than\nbarely exceed their standard deviations. The results therefore are\ntotally negative as regards any supposed faculty of clairvoyance.\n8. Distribution of Scores of Complete Sets. Of the 178 complete\nsets of 25 guesses there were eight sets with mean scores exceeding\n*For the expected number of \"Pictxire Card detected\" guesses iV = total\nnumber of P - guesses = 1487.\nK\n\f392 S. G. Soal [PABT\n15-18, i.e. with positive deviations greater than 2 x S.D. Only two\ncomplete sets had mean scores of lower value than 7-18, i.e. negative\ndeviations exceeding 2 x S.D.\nThere are therefore 10 sets with mean scores whose deviations,\npositive or negative, exceed twice the standard deviation. But the\nexpected number of such sets = 178 x -0455 = 8. Hence the actual\nnumber of remarkable scores is only slightly in excess of the theore-\ntical number. The table which follows gives the details of these\nexceptional scores.\nTable IX\nIdentity number\nof Percipient.\nMean Score.

It may\nwell be therefore that the one deviation expected in the 370 sets has\n\f118] Statistical Analysis 393\nhappened to fall in the first 178 of these and the result cannot be\nconsidered in any way remarkable or significant.\nWe may note in passing that percipient no. 112 guessed colour\ncorrectly 22 times out of 25, suit correctly 15 times and value\ncorrectly only once. No card was absolutely correct. He clearly\nscored on colour and suit.\nPercipient no. 118 on the other hand obtained nothing remarkable\nas regards colour or even suit, which were guessed accurately 14\ntimes and 9 times respectively. But no. 118 guessed the value\ncorrectly 6 times out of 25 including 2 guesses .which were entirely\ncorrect (NS).\n9. Determination of the Observed Mean and Observed Standard\nDeviation for the Complete Sets. In addition to the 178 complete\nsets of 25 there were 25 \" nearly complete \" sets of 24 and 6 \" nearly\ncomplete \" sets of 23. An incomplete set of 24 often arose through\nthe percipient writing \" Joker \" as a guess and such a guess of course\ncould not be scored. In the work which follows I have affiliated\nthese \" nearly complete \" sets of 24 and 23 to the complete sets of\n25 thus obtaining 178 + 25 + 6 = 209 sets of which I analyse the\ndistribution of scores. I therefore assume for the theoretical\nstandard deviation of each set a \"weighted mean\" a = 2-01, which\nhas been computed on statistical principles.\nBy the usual methods of statistical analysis I find for the 209\nsets\nObserved Mean of a single set =11-12\nObserved Standard Deviation a'= 1-97\nHence we have Theoretical Mean =11-18\nObserved Mean =11-12\nTheoretical Mean - Observed Mean = -06\nStandard Deviation of the Mean = -^ where\nJN\niV^ = number of sets = 209 and a = theoretical standard\ndeviation of the mean of a set =2-01\n2-01\nHence S.D. of Mean = 4== -14\ns\/209\n,T Theoretical Mean - Observed Mean -06\nH-Cnce .\u2014;\n\u2014 \u2014\nStandard Deviation of Mean -14\n= 1 approximately.\nHence there is no significant difference between the Observed Mean\nand the Theoretical Mean.\nAgain we have Theoretical S.D. = (j = 2-01\nObserved S.D. = (!'= 1.97\n. Hence ci' - cj = - 0-04\n\f394 S. G. Soal [part\nAnd for a normal distribution in which the number of sets iV is\nlarge we have\nStandard Error of a Standard Deviation\n*^\nHence the Standard Deviation oi a =\nJ2N\n2-01\nJ2 X 209\n= -098\nHence ~ ( neSiirlvl\nStandard error in a -098\nHence there is no significant difference between the theoretical\nStandard Deviation and the value obtained by experiment.\nWe find in fact that the experimental distribution of mean scores\ncoincides very closely with the theoretical distribution based on\nchance expectation. To save unnecessary expense of printing the\ndetails of the above calculations have been omitted, but copies of\nthe tables connected with them will be lent to any person who wishes\nto study them.\n10. The Further Testing of Percipients with High Scores. Al-\nthough the number of complete sets with scores exceeding 15-18 did\nnot seriously differ from the chance expectation, it was clearly\nadvisable that all percipients with scores greater than 15-18 should\nbe asked to submit to an additional test of their powers. With one\nexception the first eight percipients mentioned in Table IX each\nperformed an extra set of 25 guesses. The same technique was used\nas in the main experiment. As before the experiment was spread\nover a period of 5 weeks, each percipient receiving five sealed\nenvelopes per week.\nPercipient no. 366 was not tested because the last set completing\nhis original 25 guesses did not arrive till the new experiment was well\nunder way. His total score in fact was discovered too late for him\nto be included with the others.\nTable X gives the mean scores of this new experiment and for\ncomparison the original high scores. It will be seen that not one\nof the seven percipients gets a score approaching even 14. We are\nthus confirmed in our view that these original high scores were merely\nthe extreme fluctuations of chance to be expected when a sufficiently\nlarge number of sets is examined.\n11. Additional Investigation. It has been suggested that if the\nfaculty of clairvoyance bore any analogy to an imperfect visualisa-\ntion of the pips of the cards then it might happen that, although the\npercipient was miable to obtain an exact impression of the number\nof pips, he yet might be able to distinguish vaguely between a card\nwith many pips and one with few pips. He might, for instance,\n\f118] Statistical Analysis 395\nmistake an ace for a two or a three, a four for a five, or an eight for\na ten. The ordinary scoring system would of course give no credit\nfor such approximate guesses. To test this hypothesis I have con-\nstructed four tables taking as my basis the 6168 joint guesses which\nwere available by 17 September 1929. These Tables show [a) the\nnumber of times each \" Actual Card \" occurs for each guess value,\n(6) the expected nimiber of times each actual card should occur for\neach guess value, (c) the standard deviations from expected numbers\nfor each \" actual card \" value and (tZ) the deviations for each actual\ncard value from the expected number. Each table contains 169\nentries.\nTable X\n[Supplementary Series.]\nIdentity No. of\nPercipient.\nOriginal Mean Score\nin Main Experiment.\nMean Score in New\nExperiment.\n98 1546 10-79\n112 17-01 11-95\n118 17-96 11-85\n221* 15-10 11-94\n233 15-46 12-73\n256 15-47 9-27\n319 16-02 13-03\n366 16-77 Not tested\n623 15-32 11-97\nA careful study of these tables warrants me in asserting that the\npresent series of experiments show no evidence of any systematic\ntendencies to mistake certain cards for certain other cards or to\napproximate to the number of pips on a card.\nThe actual tables and analysis are, to save expense, not\nprinted, but may be examined by any person interested in the\nquestion.\n12.

Analysis of Colour, Suit, Value and Rank.

The number of \" actual \" picture cards\nwas counted and found to be 478 as against 2031 x 3\/13 = 469, the\nexpected number. Now 478\/2031 = -2353 and as the number of\npicture guesses recorded by the percipients = 515 we see that the\nexpected nimiber of cases in which both the \" card said \" and the\n\"actual card\" are pictures = 515 x -2353 = 121.

Conclusion. The present series of experiments provide no\nconfirmation of the hypothesis that the faculty of clairvoyance is a\n\f402 8. G. Soal [part\nnormal faculty possessed in a slight degree by the majority of\ncivilised persons. Whether we should have arrived at different\nconclusions if we had worked with 500,000 percipients instead of\n559 it is of course impossible to say. So far as we have gone our\nresults are in agreement with those obtained by J. E. Coover ^ in\n1917. Coover experimented with 105 percipients of normal\nmentality working in conjmiction with 97 normal agents. Each\npercipient made 100 guesses at playing cards drawn at random by\nthe experimenter from a full pack. In 5,000 out of the 10,000\nguesses the card chosen was not seen by the agent or experimenter\nuntil the percipient had recorded his guess. These 5,000 guesses\ntherefore were experiments in clairvoyance and Coover found that\nthe results obtained entirely conformed to the expectation of chance.\nIt has been objected to Coover's experiments that the conditions\nwere very unfavourable to the percipients who were allowed only\ntwo minutes for each giiess with a minute's interval between suc-\ncessive guesses. It might, I think, be urged legitimately that it was\nasking too much to expect the delicate faculty of clairvoyance to\nfunction at a moment's notice without regard to the mood of the\npercipient or to his idiosyncrasies. Moreover the fact that the\npercipient knew that he was to end his period of concentration on\nthe tap of the experimenter's pencil might have injuriously affected\nthe operation of spontaneous clairvoyance.\nNow such objections will, I think, hardly be urged against our\nown experiments in which the percipient was given a whole week\nin which to record five guesses. He was able to choose both his\nown time and place.\nIt will probably be suggested that in om' own series the enclosure\nof the card in an envelope inhibited the facidty of clairvoyance.\nAgainst this, however, I would point out that almost the only serious\nexperimental evidence for the existence of this pov\/er is provided by\nthe gifts of M. Stefan Ossowiecki whose chief speciality is the divina-\ntion of writing enclosed often in several sealed envelopes. In the\ncase of M. Ossowiecki at least the envelope does not inhibit clair-\nvoyance.\nIt will perhaps be contended with more reason that playing cards\ndo not possess sufficient emotional appeal to stimulate the supposed\nlatent powers of clairvoyance. Moreover, to request a person to\nguess at a playing card will frequently have the effect of inducing\nin his mind the image of his favourite card or of his lucky suit. This\nimage may be so persistent and spontaneous as to interfere with the\nmental passivity which some claim is an essential condition for\nclairvoyance.\n^Experiments in Psychical Research (Stanford University, California),\npp. sojsr.\n\f118] Statistical Analysis 403\nThe absence of emotional significance in the subject-matter of\nexperiment might be remedied by using a small set of cards on each\nof which was inscribed a pictvire with a distinct and separate\nemotional appeal. By performing large numbers of experiments\nwith this limited set the statistical advantages inherent in the use\nof playing cards might be retained without the drawback of an\ninsipid subject matter. The possible inhibitory effect of mental\npreference on the exercise of the supposed clairvoyance would how-\never still remain.\nIn conclusion my special thanks are due to Dr E. S. Pearson of\nthe Statistical Department of University College, London, for his\nvery kind demonstration of a simple practical method of finding the\nobserved values of the mean and standard deviations.\nIII. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS, WITH SUGGESTIONS\nFOR FURTHER RESEARCH\nBy Ina Jephson\nIt don't come out altogether as plain as to please me, but it's on the cards.\n\u2014\nBleak House, iv\nWhen Mr Soal suggested that a further experiment should be made\nwith playing cards, using a more evidential technique than in the\nJephson experiments, I welcomed the suggestion for many reasons.\nFirst, because it was essential that a control experiment should be\nmade with which the results of mine might be compared ;\nsecondly,\nbecause the results achieved in past experiments with cards in\nopaque envelopes (a few in the Jephson series and an interesting\ncollection by Professor Richet i)\ngave plausible ground for hope that\na larger series might show some traces of the faculty in question.\nThat the results of the Joint experiment must be ascribed to\nchance I found very disappointing, but before discussing the various\ncauses which may possibly account for the remarkable difference m\nscoring in the free and the controlled experiments, there is one more\naspect of the results to be examined, and that is whether there is any\nconfirmation in the Joint series for the first or early guess success\nobserved in the Jephson collection, and whether there is any con-\nfirmation for the theory of fatigue put forward in my report.\n1 \" Further Experiments in Hypnotic Lucidity or Clairvoyance,\" Proceedings\n(1889), vi. 66j5f.\n\f404 Ina Jephson [part\nFor the reader's information I will recapitulate the conditions\nof the Jephson experiment ;\n^ 240 people took part, each guessed five\nsets of five cards taken at random from the pack. Only a small per-\ncentage of experiments were witnessed, and as none of my percipients\nknew what was expected I relied largely on the first or early guess\nsuccess as evidence of the unlaiown faculty and as evidence for true\nrecording. I was not sufficiently aware that I should be unable to\nmeet (except by a personal opinion) the criticisms made of this\nmethod. Dr Fisher was the first to make clear to me\u2014and it is a\nperfectly fair criticism\u2014that if my percipients waited to record their\nresults till chance gave them a success I should be given exactly the\neffect of clairvoyance in the early guesses. This criticism did not\ntake into account that good corroborative evidence had been given\nby the experiments made by Dr Estabrook in similar experiments\nin \" telepathy \" and also by other experimenters, where selection\nof results was not possible. Still, my own experiment was on a\nlarge enough scale to have to make its own case and to meet criti-\ncisms on its own merits. It is a legitimate demand that an investiga-\ntor must meet objections not by reiterating faith in the bona-fides\nof the experimenters but by the evidence of test experiments where\nthe sources of error have been excluded. The uncontrolled experi-\nments and the test experiments being exactly comparable in plan,\nthe analysis can be very simply stated, and the results compared,\nwith the view to discovering whether there is any confirmation for\nmy early observations.\nThe theory of fatigue put forward in my report was briefiy this.\nI attributed the diminution of success which occurred in the results of\na total of 6,000 card guesses in the Jephson experiment (the 1200 first\nguesses being definitely more successful than the 1200 fifth guesses),\nto a fatigue of the faculty of clairvoyance. I assumed the faculty\nto be a spontaneous one, and likely to be at its most successful in\nthe initial effort, before the conscious mind had time to interfere.\nI therefore studied the results with a view to testing this, two\nanalyses being made, one of the amount of success in each guess from\nthe first of the little series of five to the fifth, and in the other I\ncounted each little set of five as a whole to discover whether the\nearlier sets had higher average scores than the later sets.\nI will begin by showing the analysis of the five consecutive guesses\nin the Joint experiment and comparing it to the similar analysis\nof the Jephson series. The scale on the left gives the score, and on\nline A is recorded the average score for all 1st or A guesses, on line B\nthe average score for all second or B guesses and so on.\n^ The Jephson series has been re-scored according to Dr Fisher's latest\naystem so as to be exactly comparable with the present experiment.\n\f118] Theoretical Analysis, with Suggestions for Research 405\nTable XXI\nA B c D E\nNo. of\nguesses.\nJephson X\nJoint Y .\n13-65\n10-69\n12-76\n11-33\n12-73\n11-20\n12-81\n11-05\n13-23\n11-50\n6,000\n6,317\nIt will be seen that the curve in no way fulfils my hopes, in fact, it\nis reversed, the last guess being definitely the best, and the only one\nwhich even approaches the upper line of standard deviation.\nIf we examine the Boston and Murphy experiments on the same\nbasis, we find that in both there is deterioration in scoring from\nfirst to last guesses in a set of five. The following diagram gives the\nsuccess from first to last guess in the two American experiments.\nTable XXII\n(Average Score for Guesses)\nA or\n1st\nB or\n2nd\nCor\n3rd\nD or\n4th\nE or\n5th\nNo. of\ncard\nguesses.\nJephson X\nBoston Y\nMurphy Z\n13-65\n11-24\n11-14\n12-76\n10-94\n9-60\n12-73\n11-42\n10-40\n12-81\n11-56\n10-22\n13-23\n10-99\n10-63\n6,000\n2,031\n784\n\f\f118] Theoretical Analysis, ivith Suggestions for Research 407\n(The marked variations in the Murphy experiment can be accounted\nfor by the fact that only a small number of guesses were involved.\nWith a larger number the averages tend to steady down to nearer\n11-18.)\nThere remain the Supplementary and the Flugel experiments.\nIn the former a slight deterioration occurs from first guess to last,\nbut on this scale it is negligible, and most tmimpressive when com-\npared to the rise in scoring for the \" D \" guesses. In such a small\nexperiment again a very wide margin must be allowed for chance\nvariations.\nIn the same table below appear the results of the experiment done\nby Professor Flugel with his class at University College, 24 per-\ncipients.\nTable XXIII\nA B C D E No. of\nguesses.\nSupplementary . 10-78 10-60 12-33 14-63 10-38 197\nFlugel 6-42 11-09 11-61 10-52 14-17 120\nBoth results must be considered pure chance results, and as in a\ncertain number of experiments the iiuctuations must be beyond S.D.,\nthe below and above S.D. results in Professor Flugel's experiments\nare chance variations.\nTo sum up the results of the present experiments, so far as my\ntheory of deterioration from first guess to last is concerned, we get\nthe following results :\nTable XXIV\nExperi^nents in which deterioration occurs from first to last guesses\nBoston 2031 guesses 11-34 to 10-99\nMurphy 784 \u201e 11-14 to 10-63\nSupp.\nJ97 \u201e 10-78 to 10-38\n3012\nTable XXV\nExperiments where the effect is reversed\nJoint 6317 10-69 to 11-50\nFlugel 6-42 to 14-17\n6437\nSo though if we count by experiments I am given a majority for\ndeterioration on the actual number of guesses the larger Joint\nexperiment swamps the effect, and we get the total curve :\n\f408 Ina Jephson [part\nTable XXVI\nA B C D E\nNo. of\nguesses.\n(5 experiments\ncombined) 10-79 11-08 11-21 11-16 11-33 9449\nwhicli is definitely unsatisfactory from the point of view of my\ntheory.\nIf we now turn to the secondary analysis for deterioration to\ndiscover whether we get confirmation for the more prolonged\ndeterioration observed in the Jephson experiment, which occurred\nfrom the first set of five guesses to the last set of five guesses the\nfollowing is the result. It was not possible to make this analysis\nin all five experiments because in Professor Flugel's and in Pro-\nfessor Murphy's each percipient had only guessed one set of five,\nbut the following table gives the figures for the remaining three\nexperiments where the guessers had each tried five sets of five :\nTable XXVII * (Sets)\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th\nNo. of\nSets.\nJoint 11-09 11-08 10-97 11-17 10-74 845\nBoston 11-15 12-78 19-84 10-97 11-44 235\nSupplementary . 13-23 11-31 12-71 9-01 11-58 40\n1120\nOr for clearness we can re-arrange the table thus :\nTable XXVIII\nExperiments where deterioration in scoring occurs fromfirst to last sets.\nJoint 845 sets 11-09 to 10-74\nSupplementary 40 \u201e 13-23 to 11-58\nExperiment where there is no deterioration.\nBoston 235 sets 11-15 to 11-44\nHere we get a clear majority for a fatigue curve, and it is rather\ntempting to imagine that it is a real sign of the increasing inhibition,\nboredom or fatigue of the percipients.

S.D.\nFig. (j\n\f410 Ina Jephson [part\nIt is very doubtful whether, as in the present experiments all\nscores lie well within the realm of chance, any significance at all can\nbe attached to them. Chance alone in a variety of experiments is\nbound to give a certain number of like curves, and the result must\nbe considered quite inconclusive.\nA subsidiary enquiry which had interested me in the Jephson\nexperiment and which I investigated again here, was whether\nwomen had had more success than men, as that is what is convention-\nally expected where intuitive faculties are concerned. Seventy-\nfive per cent, of the women guessers were found to show fatigue\ncurves against forty-four per cent, of the men. Their scores were\nslightly higher. This tendency to better scoring is confirmed in the\nJoint experiment as the following table shows, thoiigh perhaps as\nthey are only superior by a decimal point it is hardly fair to call\nattention to it.\nTable XXX\nJoint Series\n101 men.\n113 women.\nAverage score per set.\n1st set of five 10-97\n2nd ,, \u201e ,,\n11-36\n3rd ,, ,, ,,\n11-16\n4th ,, ,, ,,\n10-92\n5th ,, ,, ,,\n10-62\n1st set of five 11-20\n2nd ,, \u201e \u201e 10-82\n3rd ,, ,, ,,\n10-80\n4th ,, ,, ,,\n11-39\n5th ,, ,, ,,\n10-85\nThe average total score for the five sets for men was 275-26, and for\nwomen 275-4-1.\nIf we turn to the Boston experiment and study there the figures\nfor deterioration from first set of five to last, we find the last set\ndefinitely the best, and in this case the men score considerably\nhigher than the women. The following table gives the result. I\nhave taken all those sets which were recorded as running consecutively,\nbut postal difficulties and in some cases unrecorded dates or doubtful\ndates made it difficult to be sure in what exact sequence the sets had\nbeen done. Therefore I have only taken those complete sets about\nwhich there was no doubt, and this reduced the number consider-\nably. A certain number of percipients only recorded four sets,\nwhich I do not record here.\n\f118] Theoretical Analysis, with Suggestions for Research 411\nTable XXXI\nBoston Series\n22 men.\nAverage score per set.\n1st set of five 11-86\n13-52\n10-42\n10-88\n10-94\n2nd \u201e\n3rd ,,\n4th \u201e\n5th \u201e\n26 women.\n1st set of five 11- 02\n12- 37\n9-19\n11- 16\n12- 56\n2nd \u201e\n3rd \u201e\n4th \u201e\n5th \u201e\nThe average total score for five sets for men was 252-73, and for\nwomen was 229-35.\nThe Supplementary experiment I had examined with extra\ninterest. On the assumption that the highest scores were due to a\nsupernormal faculty a fatigue curve might be encouraging, and I\nwas delighted to discover the hoped-for effect. However, a fatal\nindustry led me to examine the results of the above-standard-\ndeviation group analysed in part II above, and I found there was\nno drop from first to last guess but the reverse, and no deterioration\nfrom first to last set but an improvement. I do not mean that by\nthese facts we can possibly decide whether the above-standard-\ndeviation scores were supernormally acquired or not, but merely\nthat on the particular analysis chosen the balance of evidence in\nthis small experiment is adverse to my suggestion.\nFinally then, three experiments out of five give deterioration\nfrom first to last guess. Two experiments out of three give deteriora-\ntion from first to last sets.\nThis result is highly inconclusive, and when we also take into\nconsideration that the variations within the curve are more marked\nthan is the drop from first to last, it becomes more likely than ever\nthat we must ascribe the results to chance.\nThe main facts of the present experiments being now before the\nreader, some attempt must be made at a summary, but I cannot do\nso without discussing for a moment the criticisms on the Jephson\nexperiment. I am glad that everything which can be suspected of\nmy percipients can be suspected of myself in an even greater degree,\nas my results figure among those recorded, and had I wished to avail\nmyself of it I had every opportunity of excluding such results as did\nnot tend to confirm my hopes. All the charges brought against my\n\f412 Ina Jephson [part\ncollection are perfectly legitimate and Dr Fisher's objections are\nparticularly convincing. His explanation covers many of the facts\nobserved and explains the high scoring not by fraud but by the fact\nthat as I did not know exactly how many of my percipients had\nfailed to return their records, I could not meet the objection that\nthose who tried and were unsuccessful might have thought it not\nworth while to send me their results. This alone would ensure that\nthe collection would be better than unaided chance would achieve.\nIt would be, in reality, a chance collection with the poorer results\nweeded out of it. His second suggestion is that my unknown\nguessers may not have begun to record their guesses until chance\ngave them a success. As chance in the long run would tend not to\ngive two successes running, there woiild be a drop in score after the\nfirst card, and thus automatically the effect of clairvoyant vision of\nthe first card is given. This criticism makes it quite impossible for\nme to prove my theories on the experiment in question, but I still\ncannot forget that the experiments which I witnessed gave the same\ntype of result as the unwitnessed, and how are we to account for the\nfact that exactly the same effect of high scoring and early success\nappears in Dr Estabrook's experiment in telepathy where there was\nno scope for selection or for arranging the moment for beginning to\nscore ? All that the jury can decide is that selection and clair-\nvoyance give the same results, and though (as is obvious) common\nsense and scientific respectability depend on accepting the most\nnormal explanation, I intend to consider the question still open.\nFor the sake of the revolutionary possibilities involved I will gladly\ndefer any claim to scientific respectability till I have done some\nmore exploring.\nIt has been assumed throughout this research that the test\nexperiments and the uncontrolled experiment were exactly com-\nparable. But in what may be a most important divergence the\nconditions were totally difSerent. My suggestion is highly theoreti-\ncal and will reduce to despair those readers to whom the facts of\nsupernormal perception are delusion. But how can we be sure that\nin using absolutely new cards as we did in the present experiments,\nfor the sake of uniformity, we are not taking away from the\npercipients precisely the source of information whence they get their\nknowledge ? I cannot see what else we are to do at this stage of\nresearch than to accept at its face value the collected evidence of\nexperiences recorded by supposedly clairvoyant people. It is their\nassumption that an object can carry with it impressions relevant to\nit ; so that if they are in contact with an object they are also in some\nway linked with the human experience with which that object has\nbeen associated. The recent S.P.R. \" Absent-Sitter \" experiments\nwith Mrs Warren Elliot are the only experiments I know of under\n\f118] Theoretical Analysis, with Suggestions for Research 413\ncontrol conditions which sought to test the theory that objects carry\nsome emotional influence. One cannot ignore the accepted tradi-\ntion of many honest and intelligent sensitives, and the question\nraised here is so fundamental that one is tempted to think that it is\nthe first problem which research should tackle. If we could get\ninformation as to whether a clairvoyant gets an impression or\ninformation direct from a material and physical object, we might\ndecide in that case that the faculty was in some form a material\none that ultimately could be classified (the analogy of wireless at\nonce occurs to one) on some wave theory. If, on the other hand,\na clairvoyant is only in touch with and can only report on thoughts\nwhich have been associated with an object, the whole operation is\nshifted on to a psychical or mental sphere. It would be interesting\nto try experiments with mediumistic people, asking them to guess\nalternatively absolutely new cards with which no thoughts are\nassociated, and then to try much-played cards. What, I wonder,\nwould happen 1 If it is only thoughts with which clairvoyants are\nin touch the whole problem becomes definitely simplified. Under-\nneath all our theories of telepathy is the assumption that a thought\nsomehow ceases to be dynamic once its moment is over. In tele-\npathy we picture an active thought impressing the passive mind of\nthe percipient. If we give up this assumption and picture the\nthought as permanently dynamic (and here again we have normal\npsychology on our side) telepathy and clairvoyance merge as it were\nimperceptibly into each other and the same faculty is responsible for\nboth. In the case of telepathy the percipient gets the impression of\na thought simultaneously to the thought taking place in the mind\nof the thinker, and in clairvoyance the percipient gets an impression\nof a thought which may not be quite so recent.\nThe primitive and superstitious view which ascribes to relics a\nreal importance may have a grain of truth attached to it, apart from\nnormal associations. Any used card, such as those in the Jephson\nseries, we may consider, if we choose, as a relic, with its own appro-\npriate image attached, and it may have been these images with which\nthe percipients were able to get into touch and which gave them\ntheir information. As in the Joint experiment the cards were abso-\nlutely new from the printers, it is arguable that they therefore had\nno associative thoughts attached to them, so that in reality, when we\nhad sent out the envelopes containing the new cards, we had sent\nout, from the point of view of the clairvoyant, exactly nothing at all.\nWe might just as well have sent the empty envelopes.\nIt will be quite rightly considered entirely premature to suggest\nsuch wild and not even original speculations, and I am quite willing\nto agree that it may quite likely be a normal reaction to scoring so\nmany thousand cards from several different points of view. I am\n\f414 Ina Jephson [part 118]\ntempted to speculate also perhaps, on accoimt of the more promising\nnature of my new series where the experiments have been planned\nso as to give the percipient the maximum of spontaneity, and to\neliminate as much as possible the use of the conscious mind.\nWhilst I must acknowledge that on the analysis made the results\nof the Joint experiment are chance results, I claim that it is too early\nto consider the verdict of the experiment in any way final. We can,\nand need only say, that under the given conditions, the experiment\nwas negative.\nI cannot end without thanking on behalf of the three investigators\nthe chief people who helped in the prolonged work of the experi-\nments. Dr Fisher's help and advice were invaluable ; for at least,\nwhatever my theories, his scoring system and his supervision of the\nstatistics, enable the facts to be given without prejudice so that the\nreader is free to come to his own conclusions. Professor Murphy\nand Professor Flugel helped materially by contributing their most\nwelcome experiments, and the encouragement of their co-operation,\nand the collaboration of many members of the Boston S.P.R. was a\nmost valuable addition to the experiment. Miss Newton and Miss\nCarruthers were an ever-present help in times of toil, and Dr\nWooUey's help in connection with the envelopes is gratefully\nacknowledged.\n\fREVIEW.\nW. F. Prince, The Enchanted Boundary, being a Survey of Negative\nReactions to Claims of Psychic Phenomena, 1820-1830. 8vo,\npp. xi. 348. Boston Society for Psychic Research, 1930.\nThe difficulties encountered in psychical research are so many, the\nopposition met with by the investigator so strong and usually so\nuninformed, the criticism received even from those who are interested\nin the subject often so irrelevant, that the active worker not seldom\nfeels despondent about the position and possibilities of the whole\nsubject. In such a mood Dr Prince's new book can be safely pre-\nscribed as an effective tonic. Dr Prince is controversial, but in a\nsubject in which we are too inclined, from sheer weariness, to offer\nthe other cheek when buffeted on the one, it is highly suitable that we\nshould be able to return to our adversaries, though but vicariously,\none tremendous and irresistible blow. For, though Dr Prince's\npugilistic style is polished and though he imquestionably hits above\nthe belt, his very science makes his victory the more overwhelming.\nThe book opens with a reprint of Dr Prince's paper in The Casefor\nand Against Psychical Belief. Next follows an article he wrote some\nyears ago, enlarged to well over 100 pages. Dr Prince assumes the\npolite fiction that when otherwise able and learned men harry\npsychical research an enchantment falls on them which prevents them\nfrom seeing clearly. Hence the title of The Enchanted Boundary.\nIn this part of his book Dr Prince examines the criticisms of psychical\nresearch published by a number of distinguished men, from Faraday,\nTyndall, Huxley, and Macaulay, to such lesser luminaries as Pro-\nfessor Rine (an Adventist), the Rev. Charles Reynolds Brown (Dean\nof Yale Divinity School), Mr Morris H. Turk (a theological writer),\nand the Rev. 1. M. Haldeman (who has been described as \" the\ngreatest prophet of the Lord now standing in any pulpit \" in\nAmerica). It is impossible to question Dr Prince's claim that he has\nestablished that none of these men has squarely faced and fairly\ndiscussed the real evidence, that most of them are often guilty of\nelementary blunders, that some of them quote incorrectly, that many\nof them show ignorance of the literature, that they are guilty of\namazing solecisms in logic, that they exhibit \" impatience, ' loathing,'\nand other emotional aberrations,\" that they entrench themselves\n415\n\f416 Review [part\nbehind, the very scientific maxims which are in dispute, and that they\nmanifest a liking for what Dr Prince happily calls \" technical\nbillingsgate.\"\nUnder the title of \" Some Sample Explanations \" Dr Prince then\ndeals with the Lehmann and Hansen theory of unconscious whisper-\ning, with Mr Salter's review of The Road to Endor, and with the\nnotorious, but elusive, mediumistic Blue Book.\nThe next chapter is a very important one. In it Dr Prince dis-\ncusses the parallels and contrasts between the late Harry Houdini\nand Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Apart from the psychological interest\nof Dr Prince's demonstration of the similarity of the mental pro-\ncesses which led these two men to diametrically opposite conclusions,\nDr Prince's discussion should serve to give the final blow to two very\nmistaken notions. One is that the creation of Sherlock Holmes was\nevidence of superior detective ability in his creator ; those who are\ninclined to believe this will find it useful to read pp. 150-151 of\nDr Prince's book. The other notion demolished by Dr Prince is that\nskill in conjuring is sufficient qualification for investigating psychical\nresearch. This is far too often alleged as a self-evident fact, whereas\nit is one of those facts for which there is no evidence, however plaus-\nible they may seem at first sight. The best critical work in psychical\nresearch has been done by men with very little or no knowledge of\nconjuring, and some of the most expert conjurors have been notor-\niously tricked (as by Davey). It seems, indeed, that a conjuror's\nresistance to the marvellous is capable of being more easily and more\ncompletely broken down than that of the average person. It is\nusually the conjuror who gives no serious attention to the phenomena\nwho remains militantly sceptical.\nDr Prince's next tilt is against the anonymous Essay on Capacity\nand Genius of about 1820. In this work the usual sort of popular\naccount is given of the circumstances under which ghosts appear.\nDr Prince takes this account point by point and shows it to be almost\ncompletely erroneous, so far, at any rate, as the S.P.R. material goes.\nHe deals in a similar manner with an address by Professor Persifor\nFrazer delivered in 1875, and with Hibbert's Sketches of the Philo-\nsophy of Apparit ions (1824).\nThe next chapter is a summary of Mr Piddington's comparison of\nvisceral hallucinations with those studied by psychical research,^ in\nwhich Dr Prince refers very happily to Mr Piddington's \" meti-\nculosity \"\n(p. 203).\nThe whole of the remaining chapters are occupied by a discussion\nevoked by a questionnaire sent out by Dr Prince to, it would appear,\nall persons appearing in the American Who's Who. It is somewhat\nto be regretted that this questionnaire is not printed in the book\n^Proceedings (1905), xix., 267 flf.\n\f118] Review 417\nbefore us : it is often rather difficiilt to follow allusions to it. How-\never, Dr Prince prints (p. 209) the particular question with which he\nis most concerned, a selection of replies to it, and of his own answers\nto these replies. Here is another cause for regret. Dr Prince has\n\" improved \" his own letters for publication. Knowing what we do\nof Dr Prince's accuracy, we can feel quite sure that his alterations\nare only verbal and \" literary.\" Still, it is a pity to expose oneself\nto criticism in such a matter ;\nnobody expects literary polish in\ncontroversial correspondence of this kind.\nThe first chapter of this part of the book gives a number of specimen\nreplies to a request for a statement of the reactions of the persons\naddressed to a very strong (supposedly hypothetical) case of super-\nnormal knowledge. The evasions produced by this question are\nremarkable in their variety. Perhaps the most interesting is the\nanswer of a Professor of Bacteriology, who wrote amiably :\n\" You\nf\nwill find '\nPancrobilin Pills, Plain,' Reed and Carnrick, a splendid\n'\nantidote ' \"\n(p. 211). It is an interesting illustration of American\nstandards that the precise religious denomination of the writers is\ngiven in most cases ; these denominations range from Church of the\nBrethren to Roman Catholic.\n( The remaining chapters deal Avith replies alleging that belief in\npsychical events is the result of pathological states, arguing from\nnegatived \" premonitions,\" attributing the events to coincidence,\nand so on. Under all these heads Dr Prince replies to his corres-\npondents with a courtesy equalled only by his forcefulness, putting\nforth all the arguments of sweetness and reasonableness, though\nseemingly w^ith but little effect on the minds of those addressed.\nIt would appear, indeed, that Dr Prince's labours will not benefit\nthose to whom the questionnaire was sent, but rather students of\npsychical research, in the vivid light Dr Prince's discussion throws\non the psychology of the opposition to the subject by \" scientific\n\"\nand other \" distinguished men.\nA few points of special interest may be briefly referred to. In\nanswer to the question, \" Do psychical researchers all agree that any\ntypes of phenomena are supernormal ?\n\" Dr Prince cites four types\nwhich he thinks all students accept. These are telepathy, veridical\napparitions, mediumistic deliverances, and psychometry. As to\ntelepathy Dr Prince is clearly right, and also in regard to veridical\napparitions. Dr Prince's explanation of the latter (p. 15) shows that\nhe has phantasms of the dying in mind ; but he does not say whether\nin his view these demonstrate anything more than telepathy. The\nsame holds of mediumistic deliverances, which are hardly a type of\nphenomenon in themselves. As to psychometry there can be little\ndoubt that Dr Prince is too optimistic in supposing there to be general\nagreement about this phenomenon. I could name several psychical\n\f418 Review [part 118]\nresearchers who do not accept it at all. Apart from this, it would\nhave been interesting to have been told whether Dr Prince believes\nin any forms of psychometry beyond such as can be explained by\ntelepathy.\nDr Prince doubts (pp. 130-1) whether it will ever be possible to\nput telepathy to the pragmatic test. But Dr Schiller has been\nmaintaining for many years that only by this very means will\ntelepathy ever come to be generally accepted.\nIn the letters quoted at pp. 304 if. Dr Prince is at some pains to\nexplain what is meant by the word supernormal. His correspon-\ndents appear to think that the word is given a philosophical signi-\nficance. It cannot be too often stressed that in psychical research\nsupernormal is simply used to indicate that which is not accepted by\northodox science, psychical research itself being the study of super-\nnormal faculties in man.\nOur President, it will be obvious, has written a most valuable work,\none which will greatly stimulate all serious students of psychical\nresearch and which will provide them with controversial material\nfor a long time to come.\nTheodore Besterman.\nERRATA\nVol. xxxviii, pp. 409, 449, 450: for \"Rondon\" read \"Kordon.\"\nVol. xxxix, p. 273, footnote: for \"Private Meeting\" read\n\"General Meeting.\"\np. 283, line 38: for \"Huxley\" read \"Tyndall.\"\n\fFORMER PRESIDENTS OP THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCBICAL RF.SI^ARGH.\nPeofessor Henry Sidqwick, - 1882-84.\nPaoFESsoR Balfour Stewart,\nF.K.S., 1885-87.\nProfessor Henry Sidqwick, - 1888-92\nThe Earl of Balfour, K.G.\nO.M., F.E.S., .... 1893.\nProfessor William James, - - 1894.95.\nSir William Crookes,O.M.,F.R.S ,\n1896-99.\nFrederic W.
