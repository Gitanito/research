Private Meeting for Members and Associate*.\nat 8.30 p.m.; MRS. HENRY SIDGWK K in the chair. Mrs.\nSidgwick, in welcoming the reader of the paper, expressed\ngreat regret that Sir William Barrett, its joint author, was\nunfortunately unable to be present, on account of illness.\nTHE REV. E. SAVELL HICKS read a paper by Sir William\nBarrett and himself on\n\"\nRecent Experiments with the Ouija\nBoard.\"\nThe experiments he described were carried out by a small\ngroup of members of the Dublin Local Section, who met\nregularly for the purpose. They used an ordinary baize-\ntopped card-table, on which they distributed at random the\nletters of the alphabet, covering them with a sheet of plain\nglass, 22 inches square. The sitters were blindfolded, and\nvarious precautions were taken to prevent them from knowing\nthe position and arrangement of the letters, which were fre-\nquently changed. Nevertheless coherent sentences were spelt\nout and intelligent answers given to questions, notes being\nalways taken by one of the other persons present who were\nobserving what took place.\nMr. Hicks added to the interest of the paper by exhibiting\na table arranged with an alphabet and a sheet of glass, as\nused at the sittings. In the discussion that followed, many\nquestions regarding the experiments were asked, and Mrs.\nSidgwick expressed the hope that other members of the Society\nwould experiment on similar lines and report the results\nobtained.\nCASE.\nL. 1194. Apparition.\nTHE following case of an apparition, seen on the first day of\nwhat proved to be the fatal illness of the person represented\nby it, was recently communicated to Mrs. Sidgwick by a friend\nof hers, who was acquainted with the percipient, Mrs. Bolton,\nand Mrs. Bolton then kindly sent us an account of her experi-\nence. The first account was written by her husband and\nsigned by herself, and the corroborative statements of her\nservants, to whom she mentioned what she had seen at the\ntime, are embodied in it, as follows :\nDecember 1th, 1912.\nOct. 7, [1900] Sunday. When in church at the afternoon service,\nwhen the last hymn was being sung, I distinctly saw my step-son\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1913.\nstanding outside the pew looking in my face. I stopped singing,\nfeeling very upset, and sat down. On looking again I saw the face\nagain, but looking drawn and white.\nOn returning to the house I called the maid who always waited\nupon him, and I said,\n\"\nSarah, I feel Master Charles is ill ;\nhe will\ndie,\" and I burst into tears. The maid said,\n\" I think, madam, you\ncannot be well.\"\n(This statement as to what my mistress said to me is quite correct.\nSARAH WHYBROW.)\nI also spoke to E. Webb, the cook, and said,\n\"\nI saw Master Charles\nin church, and I saw his coffin by the chancel steps.\"\n(This statement is quite correct.\nELIZABETH WEBB.)\nOn this day Charles wrote his last letter to me.\nOct. 13. My husband heard from Charles that he was on the sick\nlist, and this day he was moved from the \" Benbow \"\nto hospital.\nOct. 17. Much against my wish, we went to Boscombe.\nOct. 19. My husband went up to Greenock.\nOct. 24. Decided to go myself to Greenock, notwithstanding my\nhusband's telegram that \"there was a decided improvement,\" and\ntelegraphing me not to come up.\nOct. 25. Doctor said there was no hope, but when [Charles] saw\nme his face brightened, and taking me by the hand he said, \"Oh,\nmother, mother.\"\nOct. 30. On this night I felt a strong pressure on my left arm,\nand I put out my hand, thinking some one was there, but I felt\nnothing ;\nbut I said,\n\"\nCharles, are you here ?\n\"\nNo answer came,\nbut I felt a further strong pressure.\nOct. 30. On this day he was brought home and placed in the\nchurch.\nAll the dates in this statement are correct, and agree with memo.'s\nmade in [Captain Bolton's] diary of 1900.\n(Signed) C. J. BOLTON.\nDec. 7th, 1912.\nThis is a true statement written by my husband for me.\nJULIA E. BOLTON.\nMrs. Sidgwick went to see Captain and Mrs. Bolton on\nDecember 7th, 1912, and gives the following account of her\ninterview :\nI saw Captain and Mrs. Bolton at their residence, Booking Hall,\nBraintree, yesterday. I heard from Mrs. Bolton about her experi-\nence, and received from them the account written out by Captain\nBolton for his wife and signed by her. She also read me an\naccount written by herself, which she has promised to copy and\nsend me. It contains important points which she also told me in\n\fJAN., i'.n:i. Case. 5\nconversation, namely, that the letter written on the Sunday stated\nthat her step-son, Lieutenant Bolton, K.N., had a cold, and that\non account of the alarm caused by her vision she telegraphed on\ntin- Monday to ask how he was, and received a telegram in reply\nstating that he had slight influenza. The letter and telegrams have\nbeen destroyed. This was the beginning of the illness of which he\ndied. Pneumonia supervened on the influenza, and then the heart\nfailed.\nI saw both the servants who sign statements in the account.\nIt will be noticed that one speaks of a coffin at the chancel steps.\nMrs. Bolton confirms this, but my impression is that, if she really\nsaw it at the same time as the figure, it must have been much\nless vivid. I gathered that it was the apparition and the drawn\nexpression of the face when she looked up and saw it again that\nalarmed her. The coffin actually stood in the church at the chancel\nsteps during the night before it was buried in the churchyard of a\nneighbouring parish. The house, it may be observed, is quite close\nto the church.\nELEANOR MILDRED SIDGWICK.\nIn reply to a request from Mrs. Sidgwick that Captain\nBolton would write his own recollection of what Mrs. Bolton\nhad told him at the time, he wrote to her :\nBOOKING HALL, BRAINTREE,\nESSEX, Dec. 10th, 1912.\nIn answer to your enquiries, I have no recollection of my\nwife saying anything to me regarding seeing the apparition in\nchurch, and I think this can be accounted for. Mr. ,\nwho\nwas in our pew that afternoon, came in to the house with us to\nhave tea, and remained all the afternoon, and of course she would\nnot say anything before him, and, again, she might have thought\nI should consider her fanciful and foolish. . . .\nI have a distinct remembrance of my wife's distress at that time,\nand her great anxiety, and that I postponed our visit to Boscombe\nfor a week at her persistent request, although we had the house\ntaken.\nYou must remember all this took place twelve years ago, and at\n84 (my age) memory is not quite at its best.\nC. J. BOLTON.\nMrs. Bolton afterwards wrote a more detailed account from\nwhich we- extract the following :\nBOOKING HALL, BRAINTREE,\nESSEX, Dec. 13th, 1912.\nOn October 7th, 1900, on Sunday afternoon, I was sitting in the\nBocking Hall pew, and during the last hymn I looked up and my\nstep-son, Lieutenant Bolton, appeared to be standing in front of me,\nand looking earnestly into my face. I stopped singing and sat down\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1913.\nfeeling very upset. I looked again and saw his expression had\nchanged and he looked drawn and white. After leaving the church\nI came into the house and went into the housemaid's room and\ncalled my housemaid, Sarah Whybrow (who always waited upon\nhim), and said,\n\"\nSarah, Master Charlie is ill. I have seen him\nand he is\ngoing to die.\" The maid answered, \"I think, madam,\nyou are ill.\" I felt so distressed I burst into uncontrollable tears.\nOn the next morning by the second post, Oct. 8th, I received a\nletter from my step-son saying \"he had a slight attack of influenza.\"\n(It was the last letter he wrote to me.)\nOn the same day, Oct. 8th, I telegraphed to him to know how\nhe was. The reply was, \"slight influenza.\"\nWe had previously taken a house in Boscombe for the following\nWednesday, 10th, but with difficulty I persuaded my husband to\nwait a few days here, feeling my son would want me. From the\n8th telegrams between my son and rne passed, but always he was\n\"getting on.\" We heard of nothing serious till\nSaturday, 13th,\nwhen we received a telegram to say \"Lieut. Bolton has been moved\nfrom the 'Benbow' to the hospital in Greenock.\"\nThe rest of the account describes the course of the illness,\nwhich terminated fatally on Sunday, October 28th, 1900.\nPSYCHICAL EESEAECHEES AND THE WILL TO\nDISBELIEVE.1\nBY F. C. CONSTABLE.\nIT may be that the will to believe vitiates all the results\nof psychical researchers. But, if so, it is possible at the same\ntime that the will to disbelieve as fully vitiates the criticism\nof Dr. Ivor Tuckett.\nDr. Tuckett at the outset compares the schools of thought\nof Sir Ray Lankester on the one hand and of Sir Oliver\nLodge and Sir William Barrett on the other. He says :\n\"\nThe\nformer demands evidence which is capable of verification and\nis based on experiments or observations that can be repeated\nunder definite and known conditions, while the latter is satisfied\nwith evidence that does not come up to this standard.\"\nDr. Tuckett evidently agrees with the former school and,\nas will be shown, such agreement prevents him from any\nunbiassed consideration of the evidence in favour of telepathy.\nSir Eay Lankester is reasonable: he denies the possibility of\n1\nA reply to \"\nPsychical Researchers and the will to Believe,\" by Dr. Ivor\nTuckett, Bedrock, July, 1912.\n\fJAN., I'.M;;\nPsychical Researcher* and the Will to Disbelieve. 7\nintercourse between human beings otherwise than through the\nnormal organs of sense and so does not take any interest in\npsychical research : he ignores telepathy, when he is not\nlaughing at it. Dr. Tuckett is in error, it seems, in thinking\nthat Sir Ray Lankester takes any intelligent interest in psychical\nresearch.\nTelepathy may be a fact or it may not. But, if a fact, it is\nof such a nature that it is incapable of laboratory observation,\nand its experiments and observations cannot be repeated under\ndefinite and known conditions. The laws to which telepathy\nis subject are at present unknown ;\nso the psychical researcher\nis confined to the observation of particular facts. This, by\nadmission, constitutes a necessary infirmity in the evidence\nforthcoming in support of telepathy, and leaves open a\n\"\nlegitimate\n\"\ndoor for the laughter of Sir Kay Lankester. He\nand others are as fully justified in laughter at psychical research\nas the four French men of science were at the phonograph, or\nthe scientific world at Galvani as\n\"\na dancing master of frogs,\"\nor the whole universe, twenty years ago, at the possibility of\nthe divisibility of the atom or the existence of matter which,\nwithout appreciable loss of energy, could constantly give forth\nheat. Before dealing with telepathy my main object reference\nmust be made to other subjects of psychical research considered\nby Dr. Tuckett ;\nfor his method of arguing would appear to\nshow he has misunderstood the principles of the Society for\nPsychical Research ; principles which are accepted by a great\nmajority of the many members.\nThe Society for Psychical Research is a society for research,\nnot for the promulgation or establishment of any particular\ntheory. Certain gentlemen in 1882 were of opinion that facts\nof human experience exist which cannot be accounted for if\nwe are confined to intercourse with one another through the\nordinary channels of sense. The S.P.R. was established to\ninvestigate what may be termed abnormal phenomena of\nhuman experience. So the investigations are not confined to\ncases of telepathy.\nInvestigations have been made, as pointed out by Dr. Tuckett,\ninto the\n\"\nphenomena\n\"\nalleged to be produced by Eusapia\nPalladino, Slade, and Bailey. Most of us reject all these\n\"\nphenomena\n\"\n: some of us accept some of them. But the\n\f8 -\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1913\nacceptance or rejection has nothing to do with the S.P.E. All the\nsociety is responsible for is the investigation. We may be fools\nor wise men and women for so investigating ; but, in either case,\nDr. Tuckett's attacks against the personal beliefs of members\nare wide of the mark. The disbelievers are as fully members\nof the S.P.E. as the believers. It is, however, perhaps interest-\ning to note that, for his proof of the trickery of Eusapia and\nSlade, Dr. Tuckett relies on the evidence of Mrs. Sidgwick and\nMr. S. J. Davey, both members of the S.P.R.\nBut let us now turn to telepathy, and see how the subject is\ntreated by Dr. Tuckett. He says that in order to solve the\n\"\ntelepathic puzzle\n\"\nit is essential that\n\"\nwe should put our-\nselves, if possible, in the position of convinced believers in\ntelepathy.\" Surely there is some error here ? Dr. Tuckett\nhimself is doubtless a convinced believer in the laws of nature\nso far as we know them, and therefore would receive, as facts,\nstatements made by trustworthy witnesses which were in accord-\nance with .the known laws of nature. But the very question\nthat he raises is whether the convinced believer in telepathy\nis right or wrong in accepting as facts from trustworthy wit-\nnesses statements not in accordance with known laws of nature.\nThe first thing rightly to be done is, assuming telepathy to\nexist, to try to find out what evidence is available in support\nof the fact, and, secondly, to examine the evidence which is\nadduced.\nNow, assuming telepathy to exist, there is not one single\n\"\nspontaneous\n\"\ncase which can be repeated, a fortiori, can be\nrepeated in the laboratory. Each spontaneous case is as much\na personal passing experience as eating a particular dinner or\nshooting a particular bird. It is, indeed, more definitely a\npersonal passing experience than eating a dinner or shooting a\nbird, for the form of eating or shooting may continue, but\nmost spontaneous cases are unique.\nThis infirmity of evidence is a necessary\n\"\ningredient\n\"\nin all\nspontaneous cases, and, as necessarily, opens the possibilities of\nself-deception or mal-observation. Fraud, of course, there may\nbe as there may be even in laboratory experiments touching,\nfor example, the transmutation of metals. But no fraudulent\nobservation or experiment can be held to vitiate observation or\nexperiment free from fraud.\n\fJAN., 1913. Psychical Researcher* and the Will to Disbelieve. 9\nThis infirmity of evidence appears also, in some degree, in\nexperimental cases. Any scientific laboratory experiment can\nbe repeated as often as it may be desired, under the same\ncircumstances. But this, in the nature of the case, is impos-\nsible in any experiment in psychical research.\nFrom what is above written it appears that when the school\nof Sir Eay Lankester and Dr. Tuckett demands for proof of\ntelepathy that there shall be experiments or observations capable\nof verification by repetition under definite and known condi-\ntions, they are making a demand which cannot be complied\nwith. Sir Eay Lankester starts with an assumption that com-\nmunication between human beings otherwise than through the\norgans of sense is impossible. He begs the question : he\ndemands proof of telepathy which, if telepathy does exist,\ncannot in the nature of the case be forthcoming.\nNow the S.P.E. makes no attempt to prove the existence of\ntelepathy :\nproof is impossible. All even the most exact man\nof science can do towards proof, even of gravity, is to adduce\nevidence of truth. All scientific truth is logical ;\nis based on\nassumption. The scientific theory of the indestructibility of the\natom was based on assumption, and the theory was useful in\nhelping to accumulate evidence of the truth. Now the assump-\ntion is surrendered.\nBut when, by admission, there is a natural infirmity in the\nevidence which can be adduced in favour of telepathy, the\nquestion arises whether the infirmity is of such a nature that\nit is useless to investigate the evidence. The S.P.E. holds that\nit is not useless ;\nDr. Tuckett would probably hold that it is.\nDr. Tuckett writes as to telepathy :\n\"\nI am quite prepared\nto believe in it directly there is any evidence as good as\nthat for the origin of meteorites or the existence of globular\nlightning ;\nbut I hold that quantity does not take the place of\nquality in the evidence either for the sea-serpent or for tele-\npathy. Sir W. F. Barrett's evidence is really only formidable\nand impressive in its length.\" And he then proceeds to argue\nthat the evidence adduced by Sir William may be subject to\nthe infirmities already referred to.\nLet us consider this question of \"quantity and quality,\"\nalways bearing in mind that if telepathy be a fact, the laws\nof nature, as now known to us, do not govern it.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1913.\nDr. Tuckett has probably never seen globular lightning, yet\nhe believes in it. Suppose only one man had seen globular\nlightning and recorded his observation : would Dr. Tuckett,\napart from laboratory experiments, believe in it ? Does he not\nbelieve in it because of the quantity of evidence ?\nNow consider the hundreds of recorded cases of telepathy,\nand, to clear the way, let us first neglect the infirmity of the\nevidence adduced in proof of them.\nSuppose there was one and one only recorded case, say, of\na man in England who had a dream or waking vision at a\nparticular time of the death of his brother in Australia, of\nwhich dream or vision there is a record. And suppose there\nis evidence also that the brother died at the time of the dream\nor vision. Such a personal experience would be ignored by\nall, would be referred to chance coincidence. But suppose five\nhundred different people had like dreams or visions with the\nsame coincidence with the death. Would not the quantity of\nevidence have effect on belief ? Would not the difficulties of\na critic, who desired to explain the coincidences as the result\nof chance, be largely increased ? The Ghurka soldier who had\nbeen to England was asked by his captain why he had not\ntold his fellows of the wonders he had seen across the black\nwater. He replied that he could not because he would have\nbeen condemned as a damned liar. But if fifty men had been\nto England and had come back with the same tale ?\nHe who has had experience of telepathy comes to us all\nwith a like tale of the wonders of telepathy, wonders unknown\nto us and subject to no known law of nature. He can only support\nhis story by help from others of like but not the same experience.\nThe quantity, not quality only, of evidence has weight.\nThe psychical experience in telepathy of any individual is,\nat present, a miracle : it is against the known laws of nature,\nhim illae lacrimae. So the psychical researcher does not\nrely on the strength of any chain of which each personal\nexperience is a link. The S.P.E. have offered proof of the\nfraud of Slade, Bailey, and Madame Blavatsky, and some of\ntheir reports were adverse to Eusapia. Even the last report,\nreferred to by Dr. Tuckett, has been neither accepted nor\nrejected, and the report itself called attention to the fact that\nEusapia had been previously detected in fraud.\n\fJAN., litiu.\nPsychical Researcher* and the Will to Disbelieve. 11\nNow there are hundreds of cases of telepathy recorded.\nThose few referred to by Dr. Tuckett are, as proved by the\nresearches of the S.P.I!, itself, all open to the charge of fraud.\nEven the hundreds are, by admission, authenticated by evidence\nwhich is in some measure infirin. But the infirmity is a\nnatural infirmity which cannot be got rid of.\nI think it may be admitted that the great majority of those\nrecording their telepathic experiences are honest, and if we\ngrant them only normal powers of observation in each veridical\ncase, as given, there is a coincidence. The cases are so many\nthat some of us hold the probability of chance coincidence\nto be very small, and believe they point to a power in man\nof communicating otherwise than through the normal organs\nof sense. Podmore, in spite of Dr. Tuckett's criticism, fully\nbelieved this.\nBut the infirmity of the evidence ? Even if deliberate fraud\nis absent, there may be exaggeration, addition of details or\nparticulars, even some form of self-deception. And yet, in spite\nof this, the central fact, the coincidence, on which the psychical\nresearcher relies, may remain untouched.\nDoubtless the whole of our personal experience during life\nmakes some permanent impression on us. But we can recall\nin memory only leading or remarkable facts. We all remember\nthe first woman we loved, the first time of smoking, the first\nbird or rabbit shot, the first fish hooked even if not landed ;\nit is the marked events and changes of our career in life that\nwe remember. In memory we may exaggerate or add details\nto the facts we remember. But the central fact of our\nexperience remains true in memory : the fact of the woman,\nthe smoking, the bird, rabbit or fish.\nIf, then, any one has had a telepathic experience, would he not,\nin scientific probability, remember the central fact correctly? The\nvery abnormality of the experience would sear it into his memory.\nThe writer, himself, dreams constantly and forgets ;\nbut how\ncould he forget one marked event, when some one dying at a\ndistance appeared to him in dream or waking vision at the\ntime of death and told him something known but to the person\ndead or dying ? The experience was unique, and the seven\nor eight hundred cases reported in Phantasms of the Living are\nnearly all defined by their writers as unique in impression.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1913.\nWhat is to be relied on is the central fact in memory : the\ndetails may be treated as imaginative embroidery, and yet the\nsubstance on which the psychical researcher relies will remain.\nConsider a well-known case which I deliberately weaken as I\nstate it. A lady in England during the Indian Mutiny suddenly\nsees an apparition of her husband who is in India, with details\nof dress and appearance which she is able to describe minutely.\nShe is so affected by the unique experience that she refuses all\ninvitations to entertainments till she is able to get news of her\nhusband. Later on news comes of a battle in which he was\nkilled. But the date given for the battle by the War Office is\nthe day after the vision. Later on again, the date is corrected :\nthe man died about the time he appeared to the wife. (See\nPhantasms of the Living, Vol. L, p. 420.)\nNow let us assume the wife's description of the details of\ncostume, etc., is mere imaginary embroidery. Is nothing left ?\nSomething is left. What is left is the unique coincidence\nbetween the vision and the death. It is on that the psychical\nresearcher relies ;\nin this particular case the correction of the\ndate is on record. The infirmity of evidence leaves the coin-\ncidence untouched in many other cases.\nAgain, it is objected that, when we bear in mind the hundreds\nof millions of human beings in existence, if telepathy were true\nwe should have a vast number of recorded cases. In fact, the\nstrangeness is in the largeness not the smallness of the recorded\ncases. It is confidently alleged that cases of telepathy are\ncommon, and, at once, a test can be offered to the reader. You\nwho read, have you or have you not had personal experienc'e\nof telepathy, or been told by some one of such experience ?\nA large majority of you will reply in the affirmative.\nBut if such experiences are so common, why are so few\nrecorded, so few made public ?\nVery much for the same reason that Galileo refrained, at\none period of his life, from continuing to record and make\npublic his theory as to the movement of the earth. Those\nexperiencing them are afraid of public opinion ; and, in the\nface of men like Huxley, who treat such experience as belonging\nonly to cranks, and of such men as Sir Eay Lankester, who\ntreat the whole matter as belonging to vulgar superstition,\ntheir conduct is natural and expedient. It is true that not\n\fJAN., HM:J.\nI*ychical Researcliers find tfte Will to Disbelieve. 13\na few distinguished men of science and philosophy have an\nopen mind, and that their number is increasing. But the\nmajority of scientific men still hold that telepathy is impossible,\nbecause contrary to the known laws of nature, and so they\nbrand psychical researchers as impostors, fools, or homunculi of\nsuperstition. Some of us have a natural objection to be so\nbranded.\nAgain, of those who have personal experience of telepathy,\nhow many make a record at the time, and trouble to record\ncorroborative evidence ?\nVery, very few.\nBut if, for the ordinary man, there is power of memory to\nretain the central facts of personal experience, and we, ordinarily,\naccept this form of memory as trustworthy, a fortiori, we\nshould trust to memory for the central facts of abnormal\npersonal experience. For the very abnormality strengthens\nthe probability of the central facts being retained correctly in\nmemory.\nDr. Tuckett has ignored all the leading cases of telepathy\non which psychical researchers rely. If we neglect both\n\"\nThe\nWill to Believe\" and \"The Will to Disbelieve,\" the conflict\nbetween the two schools can be clearly stated.\nThe school of Sir Kay Lankester demands for proof of\ntelepathy experimental cases which can be repeated, under\ndefinite and known conditions, in the laboratory. This begs\nthe question. For it cuts out all evidence arising from\nspontaneous cases, and is inapplicable even to experimental\ncases. This school is based on denial of the possibility of\ntelepathy : for telepathy, if true, being based mainly on the\npsychical, is not fully subject to the physical.\nThe opposing school, admitting the possibility of telepathy,\nadmits also necessarily that the proof demanded by Sir Ray\nLunkester's school cannot be forthcoming. What evidence is\nopen to it ? Coincidence.\nWhere there is coincidence there is always the possibility\nthat it is explicable by chance, though it must not be\nforgotten that chance is but a negative term : it is no more\nthan a convenient veneer for human ignorance. But whether\nor not a coincidence is explicable by chance is purely a\nquestion of degree. A man firing once at a target hits the\nbull's-eye. We may fairly refer this to chance. But should\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1913.\nhe hit the bull's-eye twenty times running, chance fails as an\nexplanation, we must introduce the factor of the skill of the\nmarksman. If a dream or waking vision hits the mark once,\nwe may refer it to chance ;\nbut if dreams or visions constantly\nhit the mark, a degree of success may, some time, be attained\nwhich makes us abandon chance, and forces on us a conclusion\nthat there is some positive reason for the success attained\nwhich cannot be explained by negative chance.\nThe psychical researcher rightly relies on the quantity of\nevidence, as Dr. Tuckett must rely for his belief in globular\nlightning on the quantity of evidence. The quality of the\nevidence necessarily depends in some measure on the trust-\nworthiness of personal statements. But the central fact, the\ncoincidence, is capable of proof by record. This quality, accepted,\ncan only be strengthened by the number, the quantity, of the\ncoincidences recorded.\nNOTES ON CASES FEINTED IN THE LAST JOURNAL.\nSEVERAL questions and comments having been addressed to us\nabout the cases printed in the last Journal (Dec., 1912), it\nmay be worth while to return to them here, as the same\nquestions may have arisen in the minds of other readers.\nMrs. Verrall (on p. 338) quoted only those phrases from\nMiss Yen-all's script of Oct. 22, 1912, to which \"Miss\nJones's\n\" l\ndream seemed to apply, namely,\n\"\nThe Lombard\npoplar the Florentine's fierce love.\" The rest of the script is\nsomewhat vague and may or may not be intended to refer to\nDante. There is no evidence that any one was \"\non the wrong\ntack,\" as stated or suggested in Miss Jones's dream ;\nbut there\nis the rather striking coincidence that Miss Jones dreamt of\nDante and Verona in connection with script apparently pro-\nduced by Miss Verrall or her mother. 18 days after Miss\nVerrall had actually produced a script which she supposed at\nthe time to refer to Dante, and which her mother seeing it on\nO\nNov. 2nd had suggested to her might refer to his stay at\nVerona.\nIn the published scripts of Mrs. and Miss Verrall, the only\n1\nThe real name of Miss Jones was, of course, communicated to the Editor\nthough not printed in the Journal.\n\fJAN.. i.M.-{. Notes on Caw* I'riuinl in the lant Journal. 1\">\nones which Miss Jones could have seen or known anything\nabout, references to Dante or to his works are rare ; they odcur,\nI think, in only two of Miss Verrall's and only four of Mrs.\nVerrall's, while there are many other topics which occur more\nfrequently. Thus, there seems no normal reason why Miss Jones\nshould have dreamt that he was mentioned in the script. Verona\nagain, was only one of the numerous cities visited by Dante\nduring his long exile. It may be noted that it is now in the\nprovince of Venetia, whereas in Dante's time it belonged to\nLombardy.\nAfter hearing of Miss Jones's dream, Mrs. Verrall compared\nthe script in detail with Rossetti's poem, Dante at Verona, of\nwhich it had already reminded her. In the poem are described\nhis devotion to his native city and his fierce resentment against\nthose Florentines who by false accusations had procured his\nbanishment :\nArriving only to depart,\nFrom court to court, from land to land,\nLike flame within the naked hand\nHis body bore his burning heart\nThat still on Florence strove to bring\nGod's fire for a burnt offering.\nThus, the brief phrases of the script seem to constitute a\njoint reference to Rossetti's poem and to the passage in the\nParadiso from which Rossetti selected one of the two mottoes\nto his poem.\nThe instances of apparent telepathy between Miss Jones and\nher sister, though slight and unfortunately not recorded at the\ntime, may, we hope, suggest to readers the desirability of\nobserving whether supernormal mental powers are occasionally\nassociated with abnormal physical conditions. It is sometimes\nsupposed that this is the case ;\nbut hitherto we have come\nacross little or no evidence of it. Our experience, on the other\nhand, would tend to show that illness or a condition of\ndepressed vitality is a distinctly unfavourable state for the\nmanifestation of telepathy. But it is of course conceivable\nthat brain changes which lead to dissociations of consciousness\nmay sometimes facilitate the reception or emergence of tele-\npathic impressions, and if so, it would be useful to have\nevidence of the fact.\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1913.\nOBITUAKY : A. W. BOBBIE.\nIT was with great regret that we received the news a few\nweeks ago of the death of one of our earliest members, Mr.\nA. W. Dobbie, of Adelaide, South Australia.\nMr. Dobbie was elected a member of the Society in 1885.\nBefore that time he had for several years studied and practised\nhypnotism, and among his numerous subjects he found several\nwith remarkable clairvoyant or telepathic powers. The experi-\nments he carried out with them were carefully made and\ncarefully recorded ;\nsome of the most interesting ones were\nprinted in early numbers of the Journal from November, 1888,\nonwards, and some of them also appeared in Mrs. Sidgwick's\npaper\n\"\nOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance\n\"\nin Proceedings,\nVol. VII., pp. 30 et seq., and in Mr. Myers's Human Personality.\nIt is greatly to be desired that experiments such as these\nshould be repeated and extended. Mr. Dobbie may have been\nunusually fortunate in his subjects, or he may have had an\nunusual power of stimulating their faculties, or at least their\ninterest in what he was attempting ;\nbut other operators working\non the same lines with the same zeal, perseverance, and hopeful-\nness that characterised him would perhaps be equally successful.\nThe whole subject of hypnotism was comparatively fresh in\nthose days, especially in Australia, and this may have helped\nMr. Dobbie to achieve success also in the alleviation of pain,\nwhich was one of his chief aims. Thus, in one case, he\nwas able by post-hypnotic suggestion to produce so deep a\ndegree of anaesthesia that it was possible for a dentist to\nextract several stumps of teeth at once the whole transaction\ntaking as much as a quarter of an hour without pain to the\npatient. Mr. Dobbie contributed later an excellent report of\nhis investigation of the Australian medium, C. Bailey, which\nwas printed in the Journal for July, 1905.\nDuring his last visit to England, in April, 1911, he informed\nus that he had a large quantity of matter relating to his early\nexperiments in hypnotism, of which he was preparing a selec-\ntion for publication. He was actively engaged on this work\nat the time of his death, and though unfortunately much of the\nconnecting and explanatory material could, we understand, only\nbe supplied by himself, it is hoped that some of it may ultimately\nbe available for purposes of study by members of the Society.\n\fNo. CCXCVL VOL.

During the year 13 new\nMembers were elected and 3 Associates became Members; 75\nnew Associates were elected and 9 Members became Associates.\nOn the other hand, the total loss in numbers from deaths,\nresignations, and other causes was 31 Members and 110\nAssociates. It has happened during the last two years that\nthe membership of the Society has been to an unusual degree\nreduced through the number of deaths.\nIn last year's report it was mentioned that the Council had\ndecided to sell the house property at Prescot, Lancashire, which\nformed part of Mr. H. A. Kay's bequest to the Society. This\nyear the sale has been actually completed, and, as will be seen\nfrom the annual account of receipts and expenditure appended\n\fFEB., 1913. Report of the Council for the Tear 1912. 21\nto this report, the amount realised was 2443 5s. This\nsum has been invested, and now forms part of the\n\"\nGeneral\nI-'iind.\"\nOne of the most important subjects studied by the\nSociety, that of Telepathy, is illustrated by Mrs. Yen-all's\npaper,\n\"\nA Month's Kecord of Automatisms,\" published in\nthe Proceedings (Part LXV.) in September, 1912. This gave\ninstances of apparently telepathic connections between her own\nand Miss Verrall's scripts, and also veridical statements made\nin the scripts, or occasionally through table-tilting, about circum-\nstances unknown to the writers. Though these cases are not,\nstrictly speaking, experimental, since no deliberate attempt to\nconvey ideas to the minds of the writers was made by any one,\nthey are experimental in so far that the automatists write with\na view to seeing what will happen, and whether or not the\ncontents of the script will show evidence of supernormality.\nAnd they have the great advantage that scripts are by the\nnature of the case self-recording, so that whatever evidence\nexists depends on contemporary documents, and not on the\nrecollections of the witnesses.\nIn regard to the important question of the possible part\nplayed by chance in producing connections between scripts,\nMiss Verrall last year made an examination of a series of\nquasi-automatic writings by several different people, in which\neach writing began with a quotation selected within limits\ndeliberately by the writer to serve as the starting-point of a\ntrain of ideas. Under these circumstances it was extremely\nimprobable that the writings should have been influenced by\nany telepathic action between the writers, so that any coin-\ncidences that occurred between them would be almost certainly\naccidental. A report of the slight coincidences that did actually\noccur was printed in the Journal.\nThis year a similar series of writings was planned in such a\nmanner that any cause beyond chance for the coincidences should\nbe still more completely excluded. In this case the writings\nconsisted entirely of quotations from books, the books and the\npassages from them being selected at random according to a pre-\narranged scheme, viz. in accordance with numbers drawn by\nMiss Verrall at random from sets of numbers in a bag. The\nproblem then was to find what coincidences or similarities\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1913.\noccurred between these numerous quotations, that is, what\ncoincidences had actually, in this particular series, been pro-\nduced by chance, and consequently how much allowance it\nwould in general be reasonable to make for the probable action\nof chance in producing coincidences of the same kind in genuine\nautomatic scripts. Miss Verrall's analysis of and report on\nthese experiments will shortly be printed in the Journal.\nSeveral series of experiments in thought-transference of the\nkind where one person deliberately attempts to convey definite\nimpressions to the mind of another have been carried on by\nmembers of the Society during the year, but the results have\nnot been sufficiently successful to be worth publishing. It\nwould be rash to generalise on the subject with our present\nknowledge; but it has undoubtedly happened that of late years\nexperiments involving some form of automatic action have as a\nrule produced better results than those in which automatism\nis dispensed with.\nSome very interesting experiments, involving the spelling out\nof words through a Oui-ja board, have recently been carried\nout by the Dublin Local Section, and a preliminary report of\nthese was given at a meeting of the Society in December. In\nthis case the sitters were blindfolded to prevent their readily\nseeing to what letters the Oui-ja board was pointing, and the\norder and arrangement of the letters were often varied. Yet\ncoherent words and sentences were spelt out. The experiments\nare being continued. In the meanwhile it would be well worth\nwhile for other persons to try whether they can obtain similar\nresults ;\nand also to try sometimes with the aid of sight and\nsometimes without, and to compare what happens under the\ntwo conditions.\nA few investigations of professional or public performances\nhave taken place. Thus, a report of a sitting showing the\ntrick methods used by a medium who practises under the\nname of\n\"\nZeno\n\"\nwas printed in the Journal for June, and\nMr. Baggally and Miss Newton recently attended a public\nperformance given by\n\"\nYoga Eama \"\n(formerly\n\"\nProfessor\nPickens\"), for the demonstration of his alleged telepathic\npowers, which they found to be easily explained by normal\nmeans. Distasteful as the work of detection must always be,\nthe discovery and exposure of fraud still remains and perhaps\n\fFEB., 1913. Report of the Council for tlie Year 1912. 23\nwill always remain one of the important functions of the\nSociety, and one of the duties which it owes to the public.\nIn the department of hypnotic research, the most important\nevent of the year has been the publication of the first Special\nMedical Part of Proceedings, the first-fruits of the work of the\nMedical Section of the Society, which was founded last year.\nThis included contributions from distinguished foreigners as\nwell as from medical experts more intimately connected with\nthe special work of the S.P.R A number of appreciative\ncomments on it have reached us, and the Part has already had\na considerable sale to outsiders. We hope that it will play a\npart in stimulating the scientific study of hypnotism and\nsuggestion by medical men and psychologists a study which\nin the past has owed so much to the S.P.R, in particular to\nthe labours of Mr. Gurney and Mr. Myers. Much advance has\nbeen made in this subject of recent years, and it is extremely\nimportant that the Society should keep in touch with all the\nnew work, much of which has a close bearing on the most\nobscure problems of psychical research.\nThe therapeutic side of hypnotism must for the most part\nbe left to the medical profession, and in this connection an\ninteresting sign of the times is the foundation of a hypnotic\nclinic under medical auspices at Liverpool for the treatment of\npoor patients. But even in work of this kind the layman\ncan occasionally co-operate, as was shown by a paper read by\nMr. Bayfield to a meeting of the Society, in which he reported\nsome cases of the removal of pain and induction of sleep by\nsuggestion. In the most serious case the sanction of the\npatient's doctor was obtained.\nAnother item allied with this topic is a series of interest-\ning and instructive experiments in self-suggestion which have\nbeen reported to us by one of our members, a careful and\nintelligent observer. These will probably form the subject of\na paper to be presented to the Society within the next few\nmonths.\nIn order to help the work of the Medical Section, efforts\nare made to keep the Library supplied with all the best books\ndealing with the psychological side of medicine, both English\nand foreign, as they appear. Of those already published, it\nalready possesses what is probably the best collection in Eng-\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1913.\nland. A separate catalogue of this section of the Library is\nbeing prepared for the use of medical men.\nA number of reports of spontaneous cases, such as appari-\ntions, dreams, telepathic impressions, premonitions, poltergeists,\n\"\nhaunted\n\"\nhouses, etc., have been received during the year,\nand all possible efforts have been made to obtain confirmatory\nevidence of the occurrences alleged, whenever from the nature\nof the case such evidence was obtainable. It was found, as\nusual, that cases obtained from newspaper sources were almost\nalways valueless, being generally either fabricated or so grossly\nmisstated that the facts, as they actually occurred, were not\neven suggestive of any supernormal origin. The cases obtained\nthrough private sources have been of much more value and\ninterest, and among these all that could be brought up to a\nfair evidential standard have been, or will shortly be, printed\nin the Journal, while in others the further evidence required\nis still being sought for.\nThe physical phenomena of Spiritualism always present\nspecial difficulties of investigation, for even where there is not\nconclusive evidence of fraud, it is very difficult to obtain con-\nclusive evidence of genuineness. But no reasonable oppor-\ntunities of investigation have been neglected. More than one\nmember of the Council have independently had sittings with\nMrs. Wriedt, who claims that supernormal phenomena, both\nphysical and psychical, occur at her sittings. But the investi-\ngators desire further evidence before reporting on them.\nIn the autumn Mr. Feilding paid a visit to Dr. Ochorowicz\nat Warsaw and had five sittings with Miss Tomczyk, who\nhas been reported by Dr. Ochorowicz *\nto possess remarkable\nmediumistic powers. At two of these sittings a few slight levita-\ntions occurred ;\nthe other three were blank. On his way home\nMr. Feilding was taken seriously ill, and this prevented his\ngoing on to another investigation which had been planned, viz.\nan examination of the so-called\n\"\nthinking horses\n\"\nof Herr\nKrall, at Elberfeld. These animals have been trained by their\nowner to spell out sentences and work complicated arithmetical\nproblems ; many foreign doctors and psychologists have visited\nthem and a great controversy has ensued as to whether any\nx\nln a series of papers appearing in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques,\n1909-1911.\n\fin.

In the latter\ncase it would seem that the signs are given unconsciously and\ninvoluntarily, and if so, an interesting analogy would appear\nwith experiments with human beings in what used to be called\n\"\nthought-reading,\" or more properly\n\"\nmuscle-reading,\" when\none person is consciously or unconsciously guided by indica-\ntions unconsciously given him by another. It is hoped that\nsome of our psychological members may later be able to make\nindependent experiments with these horses.\nOne of the objects of the Society is the collection and colla-\ntion of existing materials for the history of the subject.\nUnder this head may be placed Count Solovovo's enquiry into\nthe alleged exposure of D. D. Home in France in 1858, about\nwhich some facts hitherto unknown had lately been published.\nThese, with all the evidence on both sides that it was possible\nto collect, were put together in a paper that appeared in the\nJournal in July.\nAt about the same time the Society published a volume\ncontaining a collection of all the Presidential Addresses\ndelivered since its foundation in 1882 to the year 1911 in-\nclusive. These will be found especially useful for members\nwho have recently joined, and to outsiders, since they show\nthe aims and methods of the founders of the Society and give\ninformation about some of the work accomplished.\nThe Society has suffered a great loss this year by the death\nof one of its most brilliant and distinguished members, Mr.\nAndrew Lang, whose Presidential Address concludes the volume\njust referred to. A memorial article on his work in psychical\nresearch will appear in the next Part of Proceedings.\nAn event of special interest this year has been the founda-\ntion of a memorial to Eichard Hodgson at Harvard University.\nSome of his friends in America gave contributions, amounting\nin all to ten thousand dollars, to establish a fund, to be known\nas the Kichard Hodgson Memorial Fund, the object of which\nshould be to promote Psychical Eesearch. In offering the fund\nto the President and Fellows of Harvard College, the con-\ntributors expressed their hope that preference would be given\n,\nin the expenditure of income to the endowment of investiga-\ntion and research as distinguished from lectureships.

Case. 29\nCASE\nP. 285. Impression.\nTHE following account of a premonitory impression which\nresulted in the saving of several lives was sent to Sir Oliver\nLodge by Mr. John A. A. Williams, of Aberglaslyn Hall,\nBeddgelert, North Wales, in a letter dated October 31st,\n1912:\nI have often thought of writing to tell you the following facts.\nThe story got into some of the papers, and I saw an account of it\nin the Liverpool Courier which was not quite correct. Until last\nyear I was the principal proprietor of one of the largest slate\nquarries in . I used to go up there occasionally to look\nround with the Manager, who had the charge of them. On\nNov. 25th, 1910, I went up with my brother, and we both went\nround with the Manager. On our return in the motor, my brother\nwas telling me about a \"\nshoot\n\"\nhe had been to, and I was listen-\ning attentively, as it was about a mutual friend. In the middle of\nhis telling me, I had a sort of message, and seemed to see a certain\nportion of the quarry and the men in great danger. I interrupted\nmy brother and said, \"Excuse me interrupting you, but I have had\nthe most extraordinary message, that those eight men we saw\nworking are in danger.\" He said, \"But what do you know about\nit ? The men have worked in the quarry for many years, and they\nwould know if it were dangerous; also the Manager and sub-agents\nhave been there many years and know the ground well.\" I said,\n\"I don't care. I shall stop at Post Office (after dropping\nmy brother) and will wire to the Manager to stop them working\n\"\nMy brother said,\n\" He will think you have gone perfectly mad,\" and\nthat I had never interfered with the working, etc., etc. ; however, I\ndid stop and I sent the wire. The Manager went to the eight (or\nten) men and said to the men, \"It is an extraordinary thing, I\nhave received a wire, etc., from Mr. Williams. I cannot understand\nit, but you must stop working at once,\" and the men were equally\nsurprised and took up their tools and left the ground. About half\nan hour to three-quarters of an hour [later],\nthe whole of that ground\nfell to the bottom of the quarry, about 120 yards, and all the\ndebris from above fell on top; nothing could have saved them no\nwarning. In the morning I had several telegrams, one from the\nagent, saying, \"good thing you sent wire, as all the ground gave\nway shortly after the men left,\" and I had others to the same\neffect. When I received them I lay on the sofa for a long time in\na highly nervous state, quite overcome. When I went up to the\nquarry the next day to see the ground, one of the men came to\nme on behalf of the others, to thank me for saving their lives.\nJOHN A. A.

For a length of about 20 yards the ground where\nwe and the men stood had all slipped away, so that it is now not\npossible to walk the whole length of that side as we did yesterday.\nWe had to descend from close to the eating shed. Part of the wall\nhas also gone, exposing the piles : still there is no leakage of water\nfrom the lake. The men are clearing right well from both ends.\nWe can only hope that the water will keep away for a little while,\nuntil a temporary bit of dam can be made there. Somehow I feel\nmuch calmer to-day, seeing how near we were to a greater disaster\nthe killing of 7 to 10 men. We must still hope for the best.\n[P.$.] I have dropped further note to Mr. D. saying that a\nfurther lot fell last night.\n(2) From the Manager.\nNov. 26, 1910.\nI was very glad to have your wire last night, as I was so anxious\nabout the safety of the men. They also were all very glad to hear\nyour order not to work in the dark. And, no doubt, it was very\nfortunate that you did wire, because about an hour later the whole\nof the place where they were working upon went down.\nI wired you this morning to inform you that [a] great [deal] more\nof the rubbish as well as a part of the piles and a part of the big\nwall went down last night; fortunately the water still keeps back,\nthere are a few very small streams running down the clay side, it\nis impossible to say whether these come from the actual lake or not,\nwe are setting small troughs to carry it over the clay. . . .\n(3) From Mr. Williams's brother.\nMonday [Nov. 28, 1910].\nThis morning I drove to the quarry. The position now seems to\nme to be much more favourable than it was on Saturday. There\nare no cracks known to exist in the face of the rocks. The gravel\nwill keep dropping until a natural face is formed. I certainly feel\nto-night that, barring a big flood in the next fortnight, water will\nnot flood the quarry.

Case. 31\nglad to see you, and I am sure your mind would be as much\nrelieved as mine is this evening. It is well you sent that wire. I\nforgot to ask how much warning that part gave probably not much.\nIn reply to a question from Mr. Hill as to whether there\nwas any apparent danger of such an accident happening, Mr.\nWilliams wrote:\nJV 3, 1912.\nThere is always danger [in] working in those quarries where the\nsides are perpendicular for over 100 yards. There were no indica-\ntions of any unusual danger, as my brother could bear me out. I\nboth spoke to the agent that day and also to the sub-agent, that on\nno account was any risk to be run, if the place showed any indica-\ntions of danger, and they both said they would not run the risk,\nneither would the men. . . . The Manager and men knew the\nground well and they would not run any risk (unnecessary).\nYou will notice my Manager says in his letter, \"I was very glad\nto have your wire, as I was anxious about the safety of the men.\"\nWhy did he say that in his letter when he told us both that it was\nquite safe and when I told him not to run any risk? . . .\nThe discrepancy pointed out by Mr. Williams is perhaps to\nbe explained by supposing that the Manager, after the cata-\nstrophe, blamed himself for not foreseeing it and imagined that\nhe had felt an anxiety beforehand, for which there seems to\nhave been no adequate grounds. In situations of this kind,\nthere may often be subconscious anxiety in the minds of the\npersons concerned. It is conceivable that some such feeling\nin the Manager impressed Mr. Williams telepathically, and\ncaused him to send the telegram. It is also conceivable that\nMr. Williams subconsciously noticed some indications of danger\nwhen he visited the quarry, and that this gave rise later to\nhis sudden impulse to send the telegram.\nIn the letter just quoted, Mr. Williams gives two rough\ndrawings of a section through the quarry, showing the position\nof the ground before and after the accident. The height of\nthe gallery on which the men were working is given as 340 feet\nfrom the bottom of the quarry.\nWith a view to obtaining further evidence as to whether\nthere was any reasonable ground for expecting an accident,\nMr. Williams, who has taken a great deal of trouble to pro-\nvide us with all the information possible, wrote to his brother to\nask for his present recollections of the incident, and sent us\nhis reply, which seems to show that at least neither of the\nbrothers was at all anxious about the condition of the quarry.\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

F. BAEEETT ON SWEDENBOEG.\nThe lecture delivered by Sir William Barrett to the Sweden-\nborg Society in the spring of 1912 has just been published\nin book- form,\n1\nand gives a very interesting account of the life\nand work of the philosopher, and the general upshot of his\nteachings. Swedenborg was the son of a Swedish Professor of\nTheology, who afterwards became a Bishop, and the first two-\nthirds of his life were given to the pursuit of science. Like\nsome other men of genius who have similarly devoted themselves,\nhe was not only a master of the learning of his own age, but\nin many respects he anticipated the discoveries and theories of\nlater generations. Sir William Barrett shows that both his\ngeneral conception of matter and his views, e.g., of heat and\nmagnetism, were comparatively modern, while he also made\nvaluable contributions to the study of anatomy, physiology and\npsychology. He was besides a practised man of affairs, and\nespecially distinguished in the region of finance. After fifty\nyears spent in practical studies and affairs, Swedenborg gave\nup active scientific investigation, and devoted himself thence-\nforth to the study of mysticism and religion, his teachings on\nwhich were derived from what he believed to be actual con-\nverse with angels and departed spirits. An instructive and\ndiscriminating summary of his philosophy forms perhaps the\nmost interesting part of the book, the whole of which may\nbe cordially recommended as an introduction to the study of\nthe great mystic.\n1\nSwedenborg : the Savant and the Seer, by Sir W.

MAR., 1913.\nTHE ELEMENT OF CHANCE IN CROSS-CORRESPON-\nDENCES: A FURTHER EXPERIMENT.\nBY H. DE G. VERRALL.\nIN my report on the \"Element of Chance in Cross-Correspon-\ndences\" (Journal, S.P.R., December, 1911) I concluded with\nthe following words :\nI assumed here, for the sake of argument, the intervention of a\nsupernormal agency; setting aside this assumption, as we are bound\nto do according to the hypothesis upon which this whole experiment\nis founded, the conclusion to be drawn from this incident is that\npure chance will occasionally give us a fairly good\n\"\ncross-correspon-\ndence \"\nof a simple type. But after all necessary discount for this\npossibility has been made, the evidence for the intervention of some\nsupernormal agency in the production of automatic script remains\nbut little affected.\nIn a note appended to this report Miss Johnson says that\none of the writers concerned in the experiment, called in the\nreport C.,\nsince seeing the proofs, has told me of certain circumstances\nwhich suggest that some of the coincidences detected by Miss\nVerrall are not merely accidental, but due to telepathy.\nIn the Journal for July, 1912, Miss Johnson discusses this\nquestion further, and concludes that it seems to her very\ndoubtful\nwhether C.'s literary preoccupations had any telepathic influence\non the [pseudo-Jscripts ;\nthere is no suggestion in them of any con-\nnexion with her; .... On the whole it seems probable that the\ncorrespondence between her thoughts and the [pseudo-Jscripts in\nregard to the topic of the moon was only another coincidence, due\nto chance alone.\nNevertheless, since the question of a possible telepathic con-\nnexion between the pseudo-scripts had been raised, it seemed\ndesirable to arrange a further series of experiments in which\nthis possibility should be excluded.\nAs before, six people took part in the experiment, each pro-\nducing six pieces of pseudo-script, and to all I sent the\nfollowing\n\"\ninstructions.\"\n\fMM:. I:M:?. The Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 35\nSeveral people have suggested that it would be desirable to try\nsome further experiments in regard to the element of chance in\ncross-correspondences, analogous to those published in the Journal\n(Dec. 1911). The difficulty in drawing conclusions from the earlier\nexperiments was that although under the circumstances telepathy\nseemed very improbable, it was not absolutely excluded, and it was\npossible therefore to ascribe such connexions as were found between\nthe [pseudo-Jscripts to this cause.\nWe propose to try another series of experiments in which every\nagency but chance shall be completely excluded. The method to be\nadopted is that each [pseudo-Jscript shall consist of a series of\nquotations from books, the books and the passages for quotation\nbeing determined by chance.\nThe books used should cover a fairly wide range of subjects,\nbooks of a very technical character, dictionaries, etc., being excluded.\nThey should be divided into ten groups of ten, and so far as is\npossible the same books numbered in the same order should be used\nthroughout each series of scripts.\nThe passages for quotation should be selected by means of the\nnumbers enclosed.\nThe 1st no. in each set denotes the group.\nThe 2nd no. denotes the position of the book in the group (1.\nto r.).\nThe 3rd no. denotes the page of the book.\nThe 4th no. denotes the line on the page.\nSupposing that the page number is 97 and that the book denoted\nhas not that number of pages, ten or any multiple of ten may be\ndeducted, so as to bring the page number within the compass\nrequired, e.g. if the book had 81 pages, 20 would be deducted,\nreducing the page number to 77.\nIf the page denoted has not the requisite number of lines, the\nnearest preceding page which fulfils this condition may be taken\ninstead. If no page of the book selected has the requisite number\nof lines, the nearest preceding book which fulfils this condition may\nbe taken instead.\nEach passage should be about four lines in length (whether prose\nor verse) beginning with the line denoted by the line number.\nAY here the sense of the passage requires it the preceding line or\nlines should be quoted. Full references should be given for each quota-\ntion, and where characters are referred to by pronouns only their\nnames should be added in square brackets.\nEach [pseudo-Jscript should consist of six quotations.\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1913.\nTo these instructions was appended a list of figures, which\nI compiled myself by drawing numbers at random from a bag, and\nI also wrote to each experimenter suggesting that some volumes\nof standard poetry should be included amongst the selected books.\nIt will be seen that the instructions are so framed as to\nleave nothing to the choice of the individual writer except the\nselection of the hundred books from which the quotations are\nto be taken, that is to say he has some discretion as to the\nsource of the quotations but none as to the particular passage\nto be extracted or the topic with which it deals.\nPseudo-scripts compiled in this way may be expected to\ndiffer in one important respect from pseudo-scripts compiled\naccording to the method employed in the earlier experiment.\nWhen people are asked to set their minds adrift, as it were,\nand write down whatever thoughts first come to them, the\nideas most likely to arise are those which are familiar and\nfull of associations. And this did, in fact, occur. The most\nnoteworthy of the coincidences observed in the first experi-\nment centred round the idea\n\"\nmoonlight,\" another was con-\ncerned with \"\ndawn and sleep,\" and the pseudo-scripts were\nfull of well-known quotations. The probability of coincidences\nbetween them was thereby increased. But where the choice\nof quotations is determined by chance alone, this process of\nnatural selection will be wanting. It is far more probable\nthat we should obtain the quotation\n\"\nTo be or not to be,\nthat is the question,\" by asking a man to mention the first\nquotation from Shakespeare that came into his head than by\nasking him to open a copy of Shakespeare's plays at random\nand read the first line on the left-hand page.\nIt is therefore much less probable that we shall find coin-\ncidences between the topics, as distinct from the sources of the\nquotations in this second series of pseudo-scripts than in the\nfirst series, and it is also less probable, though in a minor\ndegree, that we shall find coincidences in this second series\nthan in\n\"\nreal\n\"\nautomatic scripts. These last, it is true, by\nno means confine themselves to commonplace ideas, and their\ningenious display of learning has sometimes taxed the resources\nof investigators to the utmost; nevertheless, they have, in the\nnormal associations of the various automatists, a considerable\ncommon stock upon which to draw.\n\f.MM; , !'.n:<. The, Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 37\nTo conclude, therefore, the pseudo-scripts now under con-\nsideration are, as compared with real scripts, less likely to\nshow coincidences of topic, because normal association of ideas\nhas played a very small part in their composition. How much\nallowance should be made for this difference cannot be exactly\ndetermined, because we cannot exactly determine, in the case\nof automatic scripts, to what extent the minds of the various\nautomatists are likely, for one reason or another, to move\nalong the same lines of thought. But whatever allowance is\nmade, it does not seem to me that the result of this experi-\nment is such as to detract from the evidence for a super-\nnormal agency in the production of cross-correspondences. The\ncoincidences which I have observed between these pseudo-\nscripts are not numerous, they do not seem to afford any\nappreciable evidence of purpose or design, and they are chiefly\ncoincidences in regard to the source of the quotations, which\nis what might be expected. It was likely that the various\nselections of books would have some books in common,\nespecially as the experimenters were all asked to include a\ncertain amount of standard poetry.\nI have made a careful comparison of these pseudo-scripts,\nand most of the coincidences I have observed in them seem\nto me far too slight to be worth reporting, e.g.\ntwo scripts\ncontain allusions to Charles Darwin, but I can find no other\nconnexion between them. I give in detail the two best\nexamples, i.e. those which most nearly resemble cross-corre-\nspondences, there being in each case more than one point of\ncoincidence.\nFor purposes of reference I shall speak of the writers of\nthe scripts as A., B., etc., and the scripts in each series were\nnumbered by their writers from 1 to 6. The date of their\nproduction is of course a negligible factor. In most cases I\nimagine all the scripts in each series were produced in the\ncourse of a few hours. But for purposes of analogy and\ncomparison, it was necessary to devise some means of arbitrarily\ngrouping together pseudo-scripts from different series, just as\nthe scripts of different automatists may fall into a natural\ngroup according to the date of their production. I decided,\ntherefore, before examining the pseudo-scripts, to regard as\ncontemporaneous those which had the same numerical position\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1913.\nin the several series, i.e. A. 1, B. 1, etc., and similarly A. 2,\nB. 2, etc.\nI.\nST. AUGUSTINE, BURKE AND CHARLES I.\nIn this coincidence (I do not think that by any stretch of\nliberality the name of\n\"\ncross-correspondence\n\"\ncan be attached\nto it) two writers are involved, A. and D. A. 5 includes a\nquotation from the Confessions of St. Augustine, thus :\nA. 5.\nYet suffer me to speak unto thy mercy, me, dust and ashes. Yet\nsuffer me to speak, since I speak to thy mercy and not to scornful\nmen. Thou too perhaps despisest me, yet wilt thou return and have\ncompassion on me.\nSt. Augustine is referred to on only one other occasion in\nthese pseudo-scripts, in D. 2 :\nD. 2.\nBut of the genuineness of the life in its entirety we have no right\nto doubt, contrary to the verdicts of the most distinguished scholars\nwhether Protestant or Catholic; and there is fair reason to suppose\nthat the document is that of which the great St. Augustine speaks.\n(From Kingsley's Hermits. St. Anthony.)\nD. 2 is linked with D. 4 by the fact that both of them\ncontain quotations from Burke's Speech on the Revolution in France,\nand D. 4 and A. 5 both contain allusions to Charles I., who is\nnot referred to elsewhere in the pseudo-scripts.\nBetween James and his son the difference was one as well of prin-\nciple as of temperament. Charles, entirely devoid as he was of any\ngeneral conception of the course of European politics, had no eyes\nfor anything except the results, etc.\n(From S. E\/.

I had forgotten\nYour education, trials, much temptation,\nSome weakness : there escaped a peevish word\nTis gone : I bless you at the last.\n(From II. Browning, Stratford.)\nThis quotation immediately precedes the quotation from The\nConfessions of St. Augustine already given, so that A. 5 is linked\nwith D. 2 by the reference to St. Augustine and with D. 4\nby the reference to Charles I., and D. 2 and D. 4 are linked\nwith each other because each contains a quotation from Burke's\nXI\nweek on the Revolution in France (not quoted elsewhere).\nBurke is also referred to in A. 5 and E. 3, but I cannot find\nany further coincidences between these pseudo-scripts and those\nquoted above.\nII\nRUSKIN AND THE ESSAYS OF ElIA, JOHNSON AND CARLYLE.\nIn this coincidence also two writers are concerned, D. and\nF. D. 6 and F. 6,\n\"\ncontemporaneous\n\"\npseudo-scripts, both\ncontain quotations from Euskin and from the Essays of Mia\nas follows :\nD.6. ........\nHe thinks only of the return of the same phenomenon at the same\nhour tomorrow.

The children's governess\ntakes upon her to correct her.\n(From Lamb, Last Essays of Elia. Poor Relations.)\nThe connexion here is solely in the source of the quotations.\nI have thought it worth mentioning because it contains three\nelements, the\n\"\ndate\n\"\nof the pseudo-scripts and the double\ncoincidence of authors. Moreover, D. 6 is also connected with\nF. 3 in a manner very slightly suggestive of design, such as I\nhave been able to find in no other case.\nIn F. 3 there is a quotation from Carlyle, immediately\nfollowed by a quotation from Boswell's Life of Johnson, thus :\nF.3.\nThe bulky Weissnichtwo Packet arrived here in perfect safety free\nof cost. The reader shall now fancy with what hot haste it was\nbroken up, with what breathless expectation glanced over.\n(From Carlyle, Sartor Resartus.)\nI beg therefore you will favour me with a letter tomorrow, that\nI may know what you can afford to allow him, that he may either\npart with it to you or find out (which I do not expect) some other\nway more to his satisfaction.\n(From Boswell, Life of Johnson.)\nIn D. 6 the quotation from the Essays of Elia given above\nis\nimmediately preceded by a quotation from Carlyle relating\nto Dr. Johnson.\nJ9.6.\nHad Johnson left nothing but his dictionary one might have traced\nthere a great intellect, a genuine man. Looking to its clearness of\ndefinition, its general solidity, honesty, insight and successful method,\nit may be called the best of all dictionaries.\n(From Carlyle, On Heroes.)\nHe thinks only of the return of the same phenomenon, etc.\nThere is a simulation of purpose in thus combining in one\n\f, 1913. The Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 41\nquotation the two authors who have been referred to in succes-\n>iv(\nquotations in an earlier pseudo-script, F. 3, and the coin-\ncidence is strengthened by the fact that D. 6, as noted above,\ncontains a double coincidence with F.'s contemporary pseudo-\nscript F. 6.\nIt is, as I have said, impossible to formulate any exact\nstandard of comparison between the pseudo-scripts and real\nscripts, and comparison is even more difficult in this experiment\nthan in the earlier one, because the material under consideration\nis even more unlike real script. But in so far as any comparison\ncan be made, the conclusion to be drawn seems to me much\nthe same as in the earlier experiment, that in estimating the\nevidential value of cross-correspondences a small allowance must\nbe made for coincidences due to chance alone, but that it is\nimpossible to suppose that the whole mass of them can be\nascribed to that agency.\nCASE.\nL. 1195. Dream.\nTHE following case of a veridical dream was reported to Sir\nOliver Lodge by the percipient, Mr. W. E. Perry, in a letter\ndated February 3rd, 1913. Mr. Perry's account is as follows:\n18 PALMERSTON ED., SPARKBROOK,\nFeb. 3rd, 1913.\nOn Thursday morning last at about 8.0 I was on the point\nof getting up when I suddenly dropped asleep again and dreamt\nthat my father (deceased 10 years) came to me and, immediately\nafter, I saw a telegram which contained the words \"\nCome Grannie.\"\nI at once seemed to look for the sender's name but could not make\nout the name.\nMy father seemed connected somehow with the message, and yet\nthe telegram was not in any one's hands but simply lay against the\nsurrounding dark.\nOn awaking I told my wife that her grandmother was worse and\nrelated the dream. I enclose the telegram [which fulfilled the dream].\nI had a similar experience at the death of my father, but then I\nheard my name distinctly called three times, and so distinctly the\nthird time that I was awake when I heard it.\nW. E. PERRY.\n\f913.\n42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1913.\nThe telegram, now in our possession, is worded Come\nGrannie sinking rapidly unconscious. It is stamped\n\"\nSpark-\nbrook, Birmingham, Jan. 30, '13,\" and is timed as having\nbeen handed in at Derby Ed., Longeaton, at 8.50 a.m., and\nreceived at Sparkbrook at 9.15 a.m.\nIn reply to an enquiry from Sir Oliver Lodge as to the\ntime when he told his wife of the dream, Mr. Perry writes :\n18 PALMERSTON RD., SPARKBROOK,\nBIRMINGHAM, Feb. 4th, 1913.\n.... The time at which I told her was between 8.30 and 8.40.\nI could not tell to a minute or two, as while I quite expected the\ndream to be fulfilled, I was not thinking of it as a case for the\nPsychical Research Society. It was only after I had seen my wife\noff at the station that I remembered some of the cases in your\n\" Survival of Man,\" and decided to communicate with you.\nW. E. PERRY.\nMrs. Perry corroborates as follows :\nFeb. 19 to, 1913.\nOn the morning of Jan. 30th my husband told me that he had\ndreamt that Grannie was worse and he had seen a telegram which\nasked for me to come. This was soon after 8.30 a.m., and the\ntelegram came about three-quarters of an hour later, while we were\nat breakfast. At the time he told me of the dream I attached no\nspecial importance to it, but thought the coincidence strange when\nthe telegram came.\nWINIFRED A.

I9th, 1913.\nI may say that we knew Grandmother was breaking up, her\nage being 87, and should not have been surprised to hear of her\ndeath, but we were not anticipating the end to be so near. Grand-\nmother had been able to get about well up till about a week prior\nto Jan. 30th, and both my wife and I thought that a few days in\nbed would enable her to recover strength as previously.

BARRETT, F.R.S.\nTHK following interesting letter addressed to me by Professor\nHoernle', M.A., who holds the Chair of Philosophy in the\nArmstrong College, confirms the theoretical conclusions to which\nI was led in my investigation of the nature of the dowsing faculty.\nAs will be seen by reference to the Proc. S.P.R. (Vol. XV.,\np. 314 (7) and also Appendix E, p. 359), I attribute the success\nof a good dowser to his possessing a subconscious supernormal\nperceptive power. Usually the clairvoyant faculty of the\ndowser if such it be, as I maintain does not rise to the\nlevel of conscious perception, but evokes an obscure emotion,\nor other nervous disturbance, which reveals itself in a\ntransitory malaise, or muscular spasm, and the latter causes\nthe twisting of the forked rod. In some cases, however, there\nis a conscious perception of the underground water, or other\nhidden object of which the dowser is in search. This\napparently occurs in the case of the young Dutch boy referred\nto in Professor Hoernl^'s letter.\nARMSTRONG COLLEGE,\nNEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, Dec. 22, 1912.\nAs an Associate of the S.P.R. and a reader of your Report on\nthe use of the Divining Rod in the Proceedings of the Society,\nmay I submit to you a remarkable case of water-finding by what\nappears to be clairvoyance, which was brought to my notice in\nSouth Africa\n1\n?\nIn October, 1911, about 2J months before I left S. Africa (Cape\nTown) for good, I received a letter (in Dutch) from a resident at\nPaarl, a small country town about 60 miles from Cape Town, in\nwhich he told me of a boy, aged about 11 (I think) who could find\nwater by \"seeing\" it. On my taking the letter to Mr. P. J. du\nToit, Professor of Dutch at the South African College, Cape Town,\nI learnt that the case was well known to the Professor, because the\nboy in question lives in the Orange Free State on a farm close to\none belonging to Prof, du Toit's brother.\nI summarise the facts as told me by Prof, du Toit. When the\nboy was about 5 years of age, his father, finding the three wells on\nhis farm inadequate, started digging for another without success.\nThe boy came running to his mother :\n\"\nWhy does father dig there ?\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1913.\nThere is no water there. He ought to dig here. There is water\nhere,\" and he pointed to a spot some yards away from where the\nfather was digging. At first no one paid attention, taking it for\nchildish prattle. But the boy insisted, and his curiously positive\nconviction finally impressed the parents so much, that they dug at\nthe spot indicated, where, in due course, they struck a plentiful\nsupply. At first they were upset, believing it as\n\" backveld\n\"\nBoers\nare quite likely to do a case of diabolical possession, but the\nminister of the Dutch Reformed Church had the good sense to\nreassure them. The story presently came to be bruited about the\ncountryside; other farmers, either from curiosity or because them-\nselves in need of fresh wells, asked the boy to visit their farms\nand indicate water. As a result, the parents soon lost their\nsuperstitious terror, and in fact ended by making a business of their\nson's\n\"\ngift,\" by now, no doubt, regarded as \" divine.\" At any rate,\nI was told that the fee payable to the father is <5 for three\nindications ; money returned in case of failure. Many farmers,\naccording to my informant, and also villages have successfully\navailed themselves of the boy's services. Of failures I could hear\nnothing only of an alleged failure. When that was reported to\nthe boy he insisted that they must have dug at the wrong spot,\nand revisiting the locality, he is said to have indicated as the\noriginal spot a spot about one yard away from the one where the\npeople had dug, and at this original spot water was duly found.\nThe boy employs no rod or any other instrument or device. He\nis said to\n\" see\n\"\nthe water simply as if there were no solid soil\nbetween him and it at all. He will point to the slope of a \"\nkopje\n\"\nand trace the line of a subterranean water-course, as if it were on\nthe surface. And he speaks of seeing the water \"\ngleam\n\"\nand\nsparkle as if it were in the sunlight. He estimates the volume at\nleast sufficiently to advise his employers whether it is worth their\nwhile to dig or not. I could not get certain evidence as to whether\nhe can tell accurately how deep down they have to dig before they\nstrike water. Also, I could not ascertain whether he is in a trance\nor in any other way in an abnormal condition when \"\nseeing\n\"\nwater.\nBut he was described as, apart from the gift, a perfectly normal\nand healthy child. Needless to say, he has no geological knowledge\nof any kind.\nE. F. ALFRED HOERNLE.\nAs Professor Hoernle asks for a similar case, I will quote\nthe following sent to me some time ago by the late Dr.\n\fI'.M:I.\nPsychical versus Physical Theory of Dowziny. 45\nHodgson from America. I had previously seen reports of\nthis case in the American newspapers and had asked Dr.\nHodgson if he could obtain further particulars for me.\nHOUSE OF KKIM:I-:SI-:NTATIVKS,\nAUSTIN, TEXAS, Feb. 8, 1901.\nDR. KICHARD HODGSON.\nDEAR SIR, In reference to the published newspaper account of\nthe wonderful and unexplained gift of Guy Fenley, who can see\nwater at any distance under the earth's surface, I have to say that\nmy experiments have convinced me that he possesses this power\nof sight. I know that he can see through any substance and locate\nwater beneath; also that he has located a number of good water\nsupplies in localities in West Texas where water is almost an\nunknown luxury. There are many responsible people of Uvalde,\nTexas, and other places in that section of the State who have seen\nthis wonderful sight displayed, and know that there is nothing\nmythical about it. I shall be glad to give you any detailed\ninformation concerning this boy and his wonderful gift, if you will\ninform me definitely as to what you desire on the subject.\nYours truly,\nJOHN N. GARNER\n(Member of House of Representatives).\nI was unable to obtain any further information about this\ncase beyond the reports in the local newspapers. Other cases\nof the dowser apparently seeing underground water are to be\nfound in the history of the so-called divining rod. Some of\nthese are quoted in my Keports, see especially Proc. S.P.R.,\nVol. XV., p. 363 et seq. In Appendix E to that Eeport, some\nsuccessful experiments are recorded wherein the clairvoyance\nof the dowser, Mr. J. F. Young, was specially tested. Further,\nas shown in Appendix F, the ancient Zahoris were persons who\napparently had this gift of clairvoyance.\nCount Carl von Klinckowstroem of Munich, who has had\nsome previous correspondence with me, has a paper on the\n\"\nDivining Eod in Germany\n\"\nin the December number of the\nJournal. Judging from information I received as to the interest\nexcited in various quarters in France, Germany, and Scandinavia,\nafter the publication of my Eeports, in 1897 and 1900, the\nCount is, I think, mistaken in supposing that\n\"\nthe attention\nof all Germany\" was first drawn to the dowsing rod in 1902\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAR., 1913.\nby the publication of an article in a German weekly journal\ncalled Prometheus. However that may be, there is no doubt\nconsiderable public interest was excited in Germany when\nHerr G. Franzius employed Herr v. Biilow-Bothkamp to locate\nthe site for a well in Kiel Dockyard. From the contemporary\nreport of the proceedings which I have seen, the experiments\nthen made hardly appear to justify Herr Franzius becoming,\nas Count v. Klinckowstroem says he is,\n\"\nan enthusiastic\nadherent of the dowsing rod.\" But from whatever cause his\nconviction arose, it is certainly very gratifying to find men in\nthe high position of Herr G. Franzius and others in Germany\ntaking so deep an interest in this subject. Our hearty thanks-\nare due to Count Carl v. Klinckowstroem for his successful\nefforts in forming a society in Munich for the investigation of\ndowsing; a society which, he tells us, now numbers over 350\nmembers of all nationalities.\nI am also very glad to hear what the Count says,\n\"\nthat\nwe in Germany have considerably advanced the problem of\nthe dowsing rod during the last few years,\" and it is to be\nhoped he will embody the results in a paper for our Proceedings*\nIn the explanation of the subject I venture to differ entirely\nfrom the view expressed by the Count, who remarks :\n\"\nWe\ndo not believe that the . . . solution of the problem lies in a\nsupernormal psychical gift of the dowser, but in the physical\ninfluence of the soil acting on him.\" I can find no evidence\nof any value to support this view. On the contrary, the\nevidence points to the fact that neither soil, nor water, nor\nmetals, etc., etc., have any specific physical influence on the\ndowser. Some stoutly maintain that electricity, and some\nthat radio-activity, is the true explanation ;\nbut these and\nother physical causes are found to be inoperative when proper\nprecautions are taken to avoid the influence of suggestion, and\nthe dowser is a very\n\"\nsuggestible\n\"\nperson. Moreover, at different\nperiods and in different places the dowser has been employed\nto discover all sorts of objects, from buried treasure to mineral\noil springs.\nThere is abundant trustworthy evidence, some of which I\nhave cited in my reports, and others subsequently in the\nJournal, to show that coins, and hidden objects of various\nkinds, can be located by a good dowser, far more often than\n\fr.n:*.\nPsychical versus Physical Theory of Dowsing. 47\nchance coincidence will account for. I would ask Count v.\nKlinckowstroem how he would explain by a \"physical influence of\nthe soil\n\"\nacting upon the dowser the experiments recorded in my\npaper\n\"\nOn the detection of hidden objects by Dowsers\" published\nin the Journal, S.P.R., for Jan. 1910, Vol. XIV., p. 183 et seq.\nHere I may cite an interesting case from an amateur lady\ndowser, a friend of mine, Miss F. M. Turner, who writes to\nme as follows :\nHOPTON COURT,\nnear WORCKSTER, April 11, 1911.\nA little while ago a valuable turquoise and diamond ring was lost,\non a hockey ground, by the daughter of the Vicar of Pershore, in\nWorcestershire. The ring had been given her to take care of while\nher friend was playing hockey, and the loser was naturally greatly\ndistressed. Long and repeated search was immediately made for the\nmissing ring, but it was without result, and all hope of ever seeing\nthe ring again was abandoned. The loser one day chanced to hear\nof my \"divining\" powers, and at once wrote to me, and I consented\nto go and see if I could help in such a minute search. The day\nwas a very stormy one, and I had only time to carefully walk back-\nward and forward by the pavilion and mark one place where my\nrod turned in my hand, when a very heavy storm of hail arid rain\ncame on, and when it was over the ground was so wet and muddy\nwe could not properly examine the spot I had marked also, I had\nto catch my train. Next day the lady and her sister went back to\nthe place with a garden fork, and the very first sod they moved\ncontained the ring ;\nit had been trodden into the ground half an\ninch, and was only three inches away from the spot marked by me\nthe day before. ... I must confess that I was as surprised as\neveryone else that such a small thing as a ring could be found by\nthe rod in such a large tract of ground as the hockey field.\nFLORENCE M. TURNER.\nI asked Miss Turner to obtain corroborative evidence, and\nshe forwarded to me the accompanying letter from the loser\nof the ring. The letter, it will be seen, was written to Miss\nTurner before her letter to ine, and immediately after the\ndiscovery of the ring.\nTHE VICARAGE, PERSHORE, March lltli, 1911.\nDEAR Miss TURNER, It seems almost too good to be true, but\nthe ring is found. My sister and I have just been down to the\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1013.\nfield and went straight to the place where you said there was some-\nthing. I gave the fork to my sister, while I felt some of the turf\nwe had already turned up with my fingers, and the first sod she\nturned up contained the ring ! It was about half an inch from the\nsurface, and only three inches away from where you had stood. I\ncan't tell you how delighted I am nor how very grateful I am to\nyou for being the means of my finding it. I am certain that but for\nyou it would never have been found, and I should always have had\nthis weight on my mind ;\nnow I feel so much lighter without it.\nI wish there were anything I could do to show you my gratitude.\nI can't express it in words. I am so glad to have the actual stick\nwhich you found it with, and I shall always keep it, as it did so\nmuch for me.\nBelieve me,\nYours sincerely,\nMARY LAWSON.\nIf chance coincidence be the explanation of such a case as\nthe foregoing much would depend upon the area of the ground\nover which the loser of the ring had walked before the loss\nwas discovered. Possibly it was not more than a few square\nyards, but, even so, prolonged search at the time under favour-\nable circumstances failed to discover the ring, whereas after\nsome time had elapsed and the ring had been trodden into\nthe ground, and under most unfavourable conditions of weather,\nMiss Turner located the exact position of the ring, although\nshe was a stranger and had not been present when the ring-\nwas lost.\nThis incident, if it stood alone, might nevertheless be attri-\nbuted to a lucky hit, but, taken in conjunction with the other\nevidence cited in the paper I have referred to in the Journal,\nit adds another stick to the large bundle of evidence on behalf\nof the reality, and also of the psychical theory, of dowsing.\n\fNo. CCXCVIIL VOL.

Dream.\nTHE following account of an apparently prophetic drearn has\nbeen sent to us by Miss \"\nAnn Jones.\" Two cases, apparently\nof telepathy, in which Miss Jones was concerned, were pub-\nlished in the Journal for December, 1912.\nThe names and addresses of all the persons concerned in\nthe present case are known to us, but pseudonyms or initials\nare used here. The dates of several of the events recorded\nbelow are determined by contemporary entries in Miss Jones's\ndiary, which she has kindly allowed us to see.\nMiss Jones writes :\nNovember 20\/\/t, 1912.\nOn Monday, July 1st of this year, I went to stay in Gloucestershire\nwith my friend Mrs. D. I was not at all well while I was there,\nsuffering from headache, a low temperature, and general fatigue.\nI left her on the following Saturday, July 6th, and went to stay in a\nfarmhouse in North Wales, in the mountains. For some days 1 was\nalone, and was then joined by my sister E. I took with me the\nMS. of a volume of poems by Mr. M., which on Thursday, July\nllth, I arranged and annotated, as it was a wet day and I was\nnot able to go out at all. I posted them to him the following\nday, July 12th, so that they would reach him on the afternoon of\nJuly 13th.\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1913.\nOn the night between Monday 15th and Tuesday 16th, I dreamed\nthat I was alone late at night in the hall of Mrs. D.'s house. The\nlights were low, it was nearly dark, but I knew that some one was\nexpected. After some time there arrived many people in a motor\nor motors, including Mrs. D. and her brother G. All these people\nwere in evening dress. With them, or after them, came Mr. M. in\nvery dusty tweeds. We all had supper together, and Mr. M. asked\nme if I would come away to some quiet room, as he had something\nto show me. When we got away he showed me a large folio of\nbrown-coloured paper with very heavily drawn brightly coloured\nillustrations, wood block prints, rather like the old chap-book colour\nillustrations. It was an illustrated edition of his poems.\nOn the following Saturday, July 20th, I received a letter from\nMr. M. telling me that a young artist, having seen one of the\npoems, had drawn a picture for it, and had asked to see the whole\ncollection. On Monday, July 22nd, I heard from Mrs. D. She\ntold me of a house party she had been entertaining since I had\nleft. On the night of Monday, the 15th, they had gone for a drive\nin two cars after dinner, and their chauffeurs had lost the way, so\nthat they did not return until after midnight.\nOn Saturday, July 27th, I came back to London, and on Monday,\nJuly 29th, Mr. M. shewed me a complete MS. illustrated edition\n[of his poems]\nl\nsuch as I saw in my dream, drawn by the young\nartist during the week between July 20th and 26th.\nI had not written to Mr. M. of my dream.\nI knew that Mrs. D. had a house-party.\n[Signed] ANN JONES.\nThe dream itself is not recorded in Miss Jones's diary, but\nshe distinctly remembers telling it to her sister during a\nparticular walk which they took together. The walk is re-\ncorded in the diary as having occurred on July 16, 1912.\nMiss E. Jones confirms the above statement as follows :\n[November, 191 2.\n2\n]\nOn July 16, 1912, during a walk we took together to T , my\nsister [Ann] told me of a dream she had had on the preceding\nnight.\n1 These were the poems which Miss Jones had arranged and annotated on\nJuly 11, 1912. (See above.)\n2\nThis statement was received by us on November 21, 1912, and had been\nwritten a week or two before.\n\fI'.n:;. Case. 53\nShe was staying at a friend's country house, at which, in the\nevening, Mr. M., together with a party of motorists, turned up. He\nwas carrying a very large brown paper parcel, and promised to show\nher afterwards what it contained. This proved to be a khaki-coloured\nbook of his own poems, with coloured illustrations to them.\n[Signed] E. JONES.\nSubsequently Miss Ann Jones, having made various enquiries,\nwrote the following statement :\nFebruary 13, 1913.\nSince writing the account of my dream, I have been to visit my\nfriend in Gloucestershire again, and verified from her Visitors' Book\nthe following dates. I have also met the artist who drew the illus-\ntrations, and have from his diary obtained the other verifications.\nI dreamed the dream in question on the night between July 15\nand 16 [1912]. In Mrs. D.'s book the midnight motor-party is\nnoted as taking place between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. on that night.\nHer letter to me relating the circumstance of this drive is dated the\nfollowing Sunday, July 21, 1912.\nMr. F., the artist, met Mr. M., the poet, for the first time on\nThursday, July 11, 1912 ^ on Thursday, July 18, 1912, Mr. M. went\nto his studio, and during that visit Mr. F. made his first sketch for\nthe poems. He did not see the complete MS. until Sunday, July 21,\n1912, when he visited Mr. M. and took the poems home, working\non the illustrations during the three following days. I saw them\nfor the first time on Monday, July 29, 1912.\nThe diary of events therefore runs :\nThursday, July 11, 1912. I arranged MS. of Mr. M.'s poems in\nWales. Mr. F. meets Mr. M. for the first time in London.\nSaturday, July 13, 1912. MS. reaches Mr. M. by post.\nMonday, July 15, 1912. Break-up of the house-party at Mrs. D.'s,\ncelebrated by midnight motor drive.\nI dream in Wales of the drive and of the illustrations [to Mr.\nM.'s poems].\nTuesday, July 16, 1912. I tell my sister of the dream.\nThursday, July 18, 1912. Mr. M. visits Mr. F.'s studio in London,\nand the first sketch for one poem is made in Mr. M.'s presence.\nSaturday, July 20, 1912. I receive a letter from Mr. M., telling\nme that an artist had drawn an illustration to one of his poems\niThe date of this, and of his subsequent meetings with Mr. M., are\nrecorded iu Mr. F.'s diary.\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1913.\nSunday, July 21, 1912. Mr. F. visits Mr. M. near London, and\nsees the whole MS. [of his poems] for the first time.\nMonday, July 22, 1912. I receive in Wales a letter from Mrs. D.\nand remark on my dream [to my sister].\nMonday, July 29, 1912. Mr. M. shows me in London the large\nbrown paper volume, which I recognise.\n[Signed] ANN JONES.\nMr. M. confirms Miss Jones's account as follows :\nFebruary 13, 1913.\nI confirm the correctness of the above statement, so far as it\nrelates to me.\n[Signed] W. M.\nMrs. D. also confirms the statement, as follows :\nFeb. 25, 1913.\nAll I can tell you about the night of July 15, 1912, is as follows:\nI was at my house in the country . . . and I had at the time\nmy brother, my niece, and three friends staying with me. The\nweather was very good just then; and as the evening of the 15th\nwas very clear and hot, at dinner we decided to drive to B ,\nwhich is about twenty-two miles away. We started at 9.30, and\nintended to get home about 11.30; but we missed our way, when\nwe started to come back, and, after many adventures, we reached\nC at 2 o'clock in the morning. A few lights had been left on,\nand one servant had waited up to let us in. I did not write and\ntell [Miss Jones] about our drive till the following Sunday. . . .\n[Signed] K. D.\nMrs. D. afterwards told us in reply to a question that the\ndate of the motor drive was noted in her diary.\nOn February 13, 1913, Mr. M. stated, in reply to questions,\nthat\n(a) until the suggestion was made to him by Mr. F. on\nJuly 11, 1912, no idea of having any illustrations to the\npoems which were about to be published had entered his mind ;\n(b) the first meeting between Mr. F. and himself on July\n11, 1912, was accidental, and nothing was said on this occa-\nsion about illustrating the poems. In fact, Mr. F. was not at\nthat time familiar with any of Mr. M.'s poetry;\n(c) it was not until July 21, 1912, that a definite sug-\ngestion was made as to an illustrated edition.\n\f1913. Case. 55\nMr. F. confirms the above statements as follows, having\nverified the dates in his diary :\nMarch 14, 1913.\nJuly 11, 1912. I meet W. M. for the first time. No reference\nmade to drawings or even to his poems.\nJuly 18. W. M. comes to my studio, and I draw a suggestion\nfor a frontispiece for him. Still no mention of illustration.\nJuly 21 (Sunday). Motor down to A. and call on M. Mention\nis then made of illustration, [I] having seen and appreciated the\nMS. of his poems.\nJuly 22. Start the illustrations.\nJuly 25. Finish illustrations by 10.30.\n[Signed] L. F.\nThe illustrations, one of which we have seen, are, as de-\nscribed by Miss Jones, brightly coloured with a dark outline.\nThey were mounted by Mr. F. on sheets of brown paper, bound\ntogether to form a book, corresponding in general appearance\nto the\n\"\nlarge folio of brown coloured paper\n\"\nwhich figured in\nMiss Jones's dream.\nIt will be seen from the above report that the dates of\nall the main incidents are determined by entries in the\ndiaries of one or other of the people concerned. The chrono-\nlogical sequence of events in this case is interesting. Miss\nJones's dream occurred on the night of July 15-16, 1912,\nand included a veridical impression concerning an almost, if\nnot quite, contemporaneous event, the return from the motor\ndrive at Mrs. D\/s house, which is recorded as having taken\nplace at about 2 a.m. on July 16, 1912. The rest of Miss\nJones's dream related to an event which did not actually occur\nuntil a fortnight afterwards, on July 29, 1912, and which it\ndoes not seem that any one had any normal reason to\nforesee at the time of the dream. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the first accidental meeting between Mr. M.\nand Mr. F. that is, the first recognisable link in the\nchain of events leading up to the fulfilment of the dream\noccurred on July 11, 1912, a few days before the dream,\nAt a time when Miss Jones's thoughts were occupied with\nMr. M.'s poems, which she arranged and annotated that day\n(see above).\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1913.\nThree possible explanations of these events suggest them-\nselves :\n(1) That they are due to chance coincidence. This explana-\ntion seems improbable, considering that the parallel between\nMiss Jones's dream and what actually happened is very close,\nand that the dream related to an incident which at the time\nof her dream Miss Jones had no normal reason to foresee.\nMr. M. has published several volumes of poetry, but never any\nwith illustrations, except a frontispiece.\n(2) That Miss Jones was able in her dream to foresee in\nsome supernormal way a future event.\n(3) That Miss Jones was able, also in some supernormal\nway, to influence the mind either of Mr. M. or of Mr. F. in\nsuch a way as to bring about the fulfilment of her dream,\nwhich would otherwise have remained unfulfilled. We should\nthen regard the case as one of telepathy, Miss Jones being the\nagent. But the telepathic hypothesis must be stretched very\nfar to cover such a case.\nMUSICAL PRODIGIES AND AUTOMATISM.\nTHE following account of the musical prodigy, Eric Korngold,\nis extracted, with the Editor's permission, from an article in\nThe Manchester Guardian of December 12th, 1912:\nLast summer I was staying at an Austrian villa overlooking the\nblue waters of the Giundelsee, not far from Ischl, the country seat\nof the Emperor Franz Josef. My host was something of a celebrity-\nhunter, and used to invite to his house as many as he could catch.\nAmongst others came Eric Korngold, the musical prodigy. Having\nheard much about him and his extraordinary genius, I was curious\nto see him and his parents, for I wondered whether he had inherited\nany of his great gifts from them. For some weeks I saw him every\nday, at meals, out of doors, by the lake, driving and walking; sa\nI had plenty of opportunities to study him. My first impression\nwas one of keen disappointment. [He was] a rotund and podgy\nboy of the \"awkward age,\" with a pale face, piercing black eyes\n(one with a distinct glide), and dark hair one lank lock falling^\nover his nose. He was dressed in Tyrolese costume a dark green\ncoat, a bright green waistcoat, and leather breeches. His linen shirt\nwas crumpled, his tie was knotted anyhow, his hair was unkempt.\n\fAi KM, i!M... Musical Prodigies and Automatism. 57\nWe were all seated at dinner when he arrived with his father\nand mother. Our hostess introduced them to us collectively and\ngave them seats opposite to me. The parents looked quiet, colour-\nless people. The mother was much the younger of the two. Heir\nKorngold is a well-known musical critic, writing for the Zeit and\nother German papers. Eric sat down at once and began to eat,\nwithout looking to right or left. His manner of eating fascinated\nme. He was entirely preoccupied with it. In less than a minute\nhis plate was empty and he held it up with a \"\nBitte, noch mehr !\n\"\nAs soon as it was replenished he dashed at it again, and after\nanother minute all was gone. When the sweets appeared, all of a\nsudden he paused, with a spoonful of meringue on its way to his\nmouth. He looked across the table and far away beyond me.\nThen he dropped his spoon and darted out of the room. Herr\nKorngold reassured us in guttural German. \"Do not be alarmed,\"\nhe said,\n\" the boy is always thus. An idea has struck him, and\nhe has gone away to try it on the piano. Listen !\n\"\nHe held\nup a hand for silence, and sure enough from the next room came\nsome strange and to me discordant noises, as it were from a\npiano in pain. The father's face lit up.\n\" So ! He composes \\\nGut !\n\"\nHe was right. Often and often in the middle of a meal the boy's\neyes would take on that curious\n\"\nunseeing\n\"\nexpression which the\neyes of clairvoyants have ;\nhe would begin unconsciously to thump\nout notes on the table with both hands, and then would rush off to\nthe piano and sit there for hours strumming and recording the ideas\nwhich flowed through him, until his food was long ago stone-cold\nand he had to be pulled away in a state of semi-collapse. When he\ncame to himself he would not know what day of the week it was,\nor whether it was morning or afternoon. For the time he had\ngone out of our world altogether. His father religiously gathered up\nall the scraps of paper which littered the piano and the floor ;\nafter-\nwards he would piece them together and copy them out for Eric to\nplay over, revise, and complete later. Once I came upon the father\non his knees on the carpet, his eyes devouring a soiled scrap of\npaper upon which were scrawled some spidery notes. \"Gott in?\nHimmel!\" he cried. \"How marvellous is this child!\" Musical\nideas seemed to come to young Korngold quite unconsciously or\nrather subconsciously. Sometimes if he were out walking and talk-\ning he would call impatiently\n\"\nPaper, paper !\" and feverishly search\nhis pockets for a stump of pencil ;\nif he could not find one, he-\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1913.\nwould turn and rush off home in a state of despair. It is clear\nfrom watching Korngold that musical ideas flow through his mind\nfar quicker than he can record them. The brain always lags behind\nthe elusive thought. Much that he writes is too difficult for him to\nplay ;\nindeed it would obviously be impossible for him to be capable\nof playing the intricate and infinitely varied orchestral work which\nhe has written since he was eleven years old. How did he get this\nknowledge 1 His musical education was received from an average\nViennese music-master. His father, although he has a deep theoreti-\ncal and a fine critical, knowledge, plays but little and cannot compose.\nEric's grandparents are ordinary bourgeois folk. No creative musical\ntalent has been known in the family. For an explanation one is\nalmost forced to fall back upon the hypothesis of reincarnation. Is it\npossible that this boy genius came into the world fully equipped as a\nfirst-class musician, and all that he had to do before starting upon\nhis new career was to run rapidly over the old lessons and regain\nwhat he had temporarily forgotten 1 This is the Platonic idea that\nall knowledge is reminiscence. In Germany people are actually\nasking, \"Has Eric Wolfgang Korngold lived before as Wolfgang\nAmadeus Mozart ?\n\"\nApart from his musical genius Korngold is not clever in any way.\nHe is just a happy, easy-going, and contented lad, fond of fun and\nlollipops. His idea of perfect bliss is to have to eat an unlimited\nquantity of cream Eclairs and wild strawberries (which abound in the\nwoods of Grundelsee). He is quite aware of his own fame, and\naffects to look down upon the old-fashioned composers. One after-\nnoon he had been playing his own sonatas for an hour or so, when\nsome one asked him to stop it and play Beethoven instead. \"Bee-\nthoven !\n\"\nhe said, superciliously ;\n\" that's melody, not music !\n\"\nHis\nearlier works, which contain so much pure melody for instance,\nthat lovely little wordless operette\n\" Schneemann \"\n(Snowman) he\ncalls \"Garments\" (rubbish). Brahms and Strauss he is always\npraising. Of \"Electra\" he said one day: \"That is music; but you\nwait I'll do something better than '\nElectra\n'\nbefore I've done !\n\"\nIt was quite painful to watch him when his own music was being\nplayed even when it was played really well. He would squirm on\nhis seat, his eyes would roll, and his face turn pale. The realisa-\ntion always came short of the conception. . . .\nWe were put into communication with the writer of this\narticle through the Editor of the paper, and in reply to our\nquestions, he wrote as follows :\n\f1913. Musical Prodigies and Automatism. 59\n10 NORFOLK STREET,\nMANCHESTER, Jan. 16, 1913.\n. . . The genesis of the article requires some explanation. A friend\nof mine stayed for some time with Korngold at an Austrian villa\nlast summer. Visiting us recently, I questioned her about K. (in\nwhom I have always been interested as one of the best examples\nof innate genius) ;\nthe result of our talks was this Manchester\nGuardian article. I wrote in the first person and appended my\nown initials instead of my friend's (at her request), because she did\nnot want her name to appear.\nAlthough\n\" written up\n\"\na little, the article is a record of fact, and\nmay be taken literally particularly in regard to the almost auto-\nmatic way in which K. composes. When the composing fit comes\non (so my friend informed me), the glide in K.'s eye becomes\naccentuated, nearly approaching a squint. His musical ideas seem\nto\n\"\nrush up\n\"\nfrom some subconscious area, and his chief difficulty\nis in recording them fast enough and clearly enough.\nEric Korngold was born on May 29th, 1897, and he is now fifteen.\nHe began to show signs of musical genius when he was three years\nold. In his fifth year this became so pronounced that he was called\n41\nthe little Mozart.\" He first composed when he was four. From\nthe age of six he composed regularly and industriously. At the age\nof eleven he wrote the beautiful \" wordless musical play,\"\n\" Der\nSchneemann\" (the Snowman), also his first piano sonata. When he\nwas fourteen he wrote his first orchestral work the overture to \"A\nWinter's Tale\n\"\nafter studying orchestration for only four months. I\nhave heard this work, and was simply astounded at the technical\ngrasp and marvellous facility of the orchestration. The full score\nwas written out at once, without any sketch-plan, and the conductor\nNikisch, at the first rehearsal, was particularly amazed by the cer-\ntainty and vigour of the scoring. Mr. Ernest Newman, the musical\ncritic, has written of this :\n\" It is evident that the gift for scoring,\nlike that for harmonic combination and modulation, is inborn in\nhim.\"\nWhat impresses one in K.'s music is its maturity ;\nit is a man's\nmusic, not a boy's ;\nit has the passion, the yearning, the sadness, the\nserious thought, of the man who has seen life in many phases. K.\nhas not attended more than ten orchestral concerts in his life ;\ncertainly he has not filched his musical ideas from other moderns ;\nas I have said, he will not listen to other people's music. To my\nmind this phenomenon can only be accounted for by (1) Myers's\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1913.\ntheory of genius as a subliminal uprush, or (2) the hypothesis of\nreincarnation.\nW. P. PRICE-HEYWOOD.\nIn the Journal for February, 1901 (Vol. X. p. 20) an account\nis given of another prodigy, Pepito Eodriguez Arriola, born on\nDec. 14, 1896, about whom Professor Eichet read a paper at\nthe International Congress of Psychology in Paris in 1900.\nThe paper was followed by a performance on the part of the\nchild, then three years and eight months old.\nWe heard again of this child in 1911 from a Member of\nthe Society, Mr. J. H. Gower (Mus. Doc. Oxon.), who wrote as\nfollows :\n23 STEELE BLOCK,\nDENVER, COLORADO, May 7th, 1911.\n. . . We have lately had a visit here from Pepito Arriola, the\nwonderful boy pianist. I say wonderful, because he is absolutely\nwonderful. Indeed I doubt if there has ever been anything quite\nlike him. ... A week ago I started him holding a pencil for automatic\nwriting, and at once, to his intense surprise and amusement, the\npencil began moving, and in less than an hour it was writing freely\nand rapidly much more rapidly than he could write ordinarily,\nand in a totally different handwriting. Both his mother and he were\nmuch astonished, and quite impressed. There was not the slightest\nhumbug about it. It was as genuine as possible.\nNext day he wrote quite a good bit, and we were all surprised\nto find the signatures\n\"\nJ. S. Bach\n\"\nand **\nBeethoven\n\"\nwritten several\ntimes, together with some things I know could not come from him\nconsciously. ... He is now in California, but returns to Denver\nsoon, and expects to stay here for the summer.\nHe has promised to write for me a little every day or so. His\npiano playing is so remarkable that a psychic explanation of some\nkind seems to me to be about necessary. . . .\nJOHN H. GOWER.\nDr. Gower wrote again on June 12, 1911, saying that he\nhad obtained some interesting automatic writing from Pepito,\nwhich struck him by its resemblance to some writing produced\ntwo or three years earlier by his own youngest daughter, of which\nhe believed that Pepito could have known nothing. He added :\n\"\nWith regard to his music, I am getting some compositions\nfrom him, and several of his musical themes bear a remarkable\n\fP.M.-5. Miixit'td Prodigies and Automatism. 61\nresemblance to compositions of mine that have not been\npublished and that I know he has neither seen nor heard.\"\nDr. Gower wrote later to tell us of another musical prodigy,\nBlanche Cobacker, a little girl of 10 or 11 years of age (in\n1911) whose genius for piano-playing was, he thought, quite\nas startling as Pepito's. \"She has been studying with me\n(he wrote) since last February, and I have been following a\nmethod of suggestion and encouragement with her, a method\nabsolutely different to any orthodox or conventional one. The\nresult has been really wonderful. [She] plays the most\nexacting and difficult compositions of the old and modern\ncomposers with all the fire and dash of a Busoni or\nPaderewski. Some of the things she does are quite uncanny.\"\nDr. Gower sent us a more detailed account of Blanche\nCobacker, as follows :\nDENVER, COLORADO, U.S.A., January 2Qth, 1912.\nThe early history of the child appears to be as follows : Born in\n'Chicago, Illinois, 12 years ago. Her father an invalid, since\ndeceased. He had no particular musical talent, though some\nmembers of his family play. Mrs. Cobacker, the mother, also,\nalthough very fond of music herself, has never developed her talent ;\nshe, however, comes of a musical family and is, in general, interested\nin art.\nLittle Blanche had no opportunity of studying music until she\nwas 8 years of age. At that time she was living with her aunt in\nDes Moines, Iowa, and therefore her talents were never recognized\nin infancy. Her mother, however, had noticed that her little fingers\nwould frequently be at work as if\ntrying to play, on the table or\non the arm of a chair. About three years ago the family came to\nDenver on account of Mr. Cobacker's health, and Blanche became\nthe pupil of Senor Aquabella of this city, under whose able instruc-\ntion she remained for about 18 months, I believe.\nIt was then suggested by a friend of Mrs. Cobacker's that I was\npossibly in a position to exploit the child's talents, and Blanche was\nplaced under my care just one year ago.\nShortly after her coming to me she became acquainted with that\nwonderful boy pianist, Pepito Arriola. Pepito was a frequent visitor\nto my studio during the summer months, and gave about ten piano-\nforte recitals in Colorado, nearly all of which Blanche Cobacker\nattended with me. This may have stimulated her into greater\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1913.\nactivity. However, at no time, within my knowledge of her, has\nthe child been urged to practise, nor has she shown any particular\ndiligence in her work. She is not of a very robust constitution, and\nduring the time she has been with me, she has lost a considerable\namount of work through sickness.\nNotwithstanding this, she has fairly mastered during the last year\nBeethoven's Concerto in C minor, Mendelssohn's Concerto in G minor,\nRubinstein's Concerto in E minor, several sonatas by Beethoven,\nseveral studies, valses, polonaises, nocturnes, etc., by Chopin, studies\nby Rubinstein, the same composer's Valse Caprice, two rhapsodies of\nLiszt (Nos. 6 and 12), to say nothing of several works by more\nmodern composers, and, perhaps more astonishing than all, some of\nthe most difficult of Bach's compositions.\nShe has no difficulty in committing music to memory, but seems\nto employ a method all her own in doing so. As far as technique\nis concerned, I have never yet seen a passage that has given her\nany trouble. Often when playing the most exacting pieces she will\nturn her head around to talk to me on subjects entirely irrelevant\nto what she may be then playing.\nLast September when playing from notes Mendelssohn's Concerto\nin G minor at a recital in Holly, Colorado, before I had any idea\nthat she had memorized the work, the lights of the town went out\nsuddenly and the hall was in total darkness, but Blanche continued\nto play with the greatest brilliancy and never faltered or missed a\nnote. It was five or six minutes before the lights went up again,\nand it was conceded that the child, by continuing to play, had\nprobably averted a panic.\nThe strength of her playing is phenomenal, and at the close of a\nrecital containing such works as Rubinstein's Concerto in E minor\nwith its four pages of octaves Rubinstein's Valse Caprice, Mendels-\nsohn's Concerto in G minor, Chopin's Etude in C minor, Polonaise\nin E flat, and Liszt's 6th Rhapsodic, she shows no sign of fatigue.\nWith regard to her powers of interpretation and the expressive-\nness of her playing, they are as wonderful as her technique.\nShe seems to be indifferent to the size of her audience, and played\nquite unconcernedly a few weeks ago to an audience numbering\nnearly 12,000 people.\nShe reads music at sight, even very difficult music, as well as\nmost professional pianists. I tested her a short time ago in trans-\nposing. The piece selected was from one of Bach's suites. It is\ntrue that I first played it for her in two or three different keys,\n\fAI KM, i in::. Musical Prodigies and Automatism. 63\nbut I was astounded to find that the contrapuntal devices of Bach\npresented no obstacles to her, even in transposing them from one\nkey to another. All musicians will concede that to transpose a\nvery complete knowledge of the theory of music is almost essential.\nAs Blanche is entirely without such knowledge, her immediate\nresponse to my suggestion is little short of marvellous. I further\ntested her in the \" trick\n\"\nof playing a simple piece in one key with\nthe right hand and in another key with the left hand, at sight.\nHere again she came out successfully.\nIn every respect, except piano playing, she is an ordinary little\ngirl of normal habits and tastes and of a sweet, gentle and unselfish\ndisposition.\nThe method employed in her instruction is very largely that of\nencouragement and suggestion. Her powers of imitation are also\ncalled upon, as the pieces she is studying are always played over\nto her at her lessons, as are also various passages in them, not only\nto show her how to execute them, but also to point out the desired\nexpression. The old restrictions and rules relating to fingering\nhave been practically abandoned. She is never allowed to regard\nany musical passage, however intricate, as difficult. She seldom\npractises more than two hours a day.\nJOHN H. GOWER, Mus. Doc. Oxon.\np.S. Blanche will have, say, such a work as Beethoven's Opus 57\ngiven her for the first time. I especially recall her action in this\nparticular piece. She although a remarkable reader of music\ntackles it first, as I always insist, slowly. Now, the work is full of\ndifficult passages, and she comes upon one of these, say, an arpeggio.\nAt first she acts as an ordinary clever student would act, but after\nplaying it a few times, slowly, her fingers will dash it off at full\nspeed, as if some latent memory had suddenly been awakened.\nI have had considerable experience as a teacher of music, so that\nmy astonishment at the genius of this child is a matter to which\nsome slight weight may be attached. I saw something of Josef\nHofmann when he was a boy, I have seen quite a bit of Pepito\nArriola, and now have charge of Blanche Cobacker. I have of\ncourse run across quite a number of clever children (pianists, I\nmean). My son Lewes is one he is really a sort of \"wonder\nchild\" but Hofmann, Arriola, and Cobacker are to me almost\ninsoluble enigmas.\nIn regard to the hypothesis of reincarnation as a possible\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1913.\nexplanation of these cases, it may be pointed out that if, say,\nEric Korngold's precocity is to be explained by his being a\nreincarnation of Mozart, this does not help us to explain\nMozart's precocity. Further, if precocity is to be explained\nby supposing that the child is a reincarnation of some already\nmature musician, we should expect the child to show maturity\nnot only in his musical faculty, but at the same time in all\nhis other mental powers, which is far from being the case with\nany of these children.\nOBITUARY.\nTHE EAEL OF CEAWFOED AND BALCAERES, K.T., F.RS.\nIT is with regret that we have to record the death of the Earl\nof Crawford and Balcarres, which took place at his house in\nCavelidish Square, on January 31st, 1913.\nLord Crawford became a member of the Society in 1890, and\nwas shortly afterwards elected a member of the Council, a\nposition which he continued to hold up to the time of his death.\nHis interest in psychical research dated, however, from a much\nearlier period, when, as the Master of Lindsay, he attended some\nof the sittings with the medium, D.

MAY, 1913.\nCASES.\nP. 287. Dreams.\nTHE following account of two dreams of an apparently pre-\nmonitory character was sent to us by a lady who has been an\nAssociate of the Society for several years. On account of the\nfamily circumstances involved, we are asked not to print names,\nso that pseudonyms have been substituted, but all the real\nnames have been given to us in confidence. The first narrative\nby the lady here called Miss Matheson was written on January\n1st, 1913, as follows:\nTwenty-three years ago last September I dreamed a very vivid dream,\nsimple as all my dreams are, but of so intensely vivid a character\nthat it impressed me very much. The dream was simply that a\ncousin of mine who was then in San Francisco, while I was in\nProvidence, U.S.A., had some terrible disaster hanging over her and\nshe was straining every nerve to get to me. This dream I had in\nslight variation for three nights. So deep was the impression they\nmade upon me that I wrote her describing the dreams. She replied\nthat she knew of nothing terrible awaiting her, unless it was an\nearthquake, but in six weeks the dream came literally true. She\nhad come on to Boston to settle her son at Harvard for his second\nyear and in the night after arrival a most awful affliction fell upon\nher and she left the hotel as soon as it was opened in the morning\nand walked the streets without breakfast until she could get a train\nto me. So great was the influence of this affliction that it entirely\nchanged my life and has not yet relaxed its grip.\nRemembering this dream and its enormous consequences, I wrote\ndown at once on awakening a dream I had in the Hans Crescent\nHotel in London on the night between the 12th and 13th of April,\n1912. I also told my maid of it when she came to me in the morning.\nThis is the dream. I thought I waked at midnight, just as the\nclock was striking 12, I found myself in a strange place, a\nsmall cottage room, such as I had never slept in in my life. I\nsuddenly felt that something was calling me downstairs. It was\nbright moonlight, which flooded the room, making artificial light\nunnecessary. I rose and went out into the passage, finding a short\nflight of extremely steep stairs leading down. They were almost\nperpendicular and very narrow, altogether unlike anything I ever\nsaw before, and scarcely as safe as a ladder. I went down these\nstairs and along a short passage into a very pleasant little cottage\n\fM.\\\\. mi:*. CWs. 69\nparlour with a large window at one end. Still it was bright moon-\nlight and I saw everything perfectly and knew I should know the\nroom again if I ever saw it. As I entered I heard a voice wailing\n\"Twenty-four, East Street, Twenty-four, East Street.\" The voice\nwas so insistent, so sad, so weird, that it frightened me. I went\nto the window, but could see nothing but the moonlight washing\neverything. I noticed there was a wide space in front of the little\nfence, which was close to the window, and beyond great trees. The\nvoice continued wailing out the words \"Twenty-four East Street\"\nuntil I could bear it no longer, but turned and fled. I can give\nyou no idea of the piercing nature of the voice, nor the sorrow and\ndistress in it, but yet on the whole the impression left upon my\nmind when I waked was one of happiness and well-being. I did\nnot dream the dream again, as I had before in the one I have related,\nso I gradually dismissed it from my mind. My maid said when I told\nher of the dream the next morning\n\"\nCan it be anything to do with\nMr. W,?\" naming a friend of mine in New York. I said, no, I did\nnot think so. I thought the idea came to her from the fact that\nshe knew the streets in New York were always East or West with\na number added. However, as I said, I had dismissed the entire\nmatter from my mind and concluded there was no meaning to the\ndream.\nShortly after this I suddenly made up my mind to take a house\nin the New Forest for the month of June. I took my maid and we\nmotored all through the Forest in search of such a house as I\nwished.\nThe only one I could find that had the seclusion I desired was a\ncottage belonging to a man who had been a butler in a good family\nand who owned his house, which had been added to and had grown\nsomewhat beyond its first primitive condition. This house was kept by\nhis two daughters and though it was not just what I wished, I took it\nfor a month from the 29th of May. I was tired with my quest and\ndid not notice the house much, simply taking it because I could\nfind nothing else, so I did not associate it with my dream at all\nuntil I went to take possession on the 29th of May. Then I re-\nmembered the staircase and the drawing room and I found that\nwhat I had taken for a hall was really a small room, which, in the\nmore unambitious days, had been the tiny parlour of the Cottage.\nMr. W., my friend in N.Y., died on the 29th of May, the day I\nwent to this cottage and I heard of it two days later in the cottage.\nMr. W.'s house in New York was 24 East 51st Street, around the\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1913.\ncorner from and connected with the house of Mr. Whitelaw Reid,\nthough he, Mr. W., was not living in it at the time of his death.\nMr. W. had not been well for several years, but I had no idea he\nwas in any danger, but I had known for nearly fifteen years\nthat he looked to me for a certain thing in case of his death. He\nnever said this in words, but I and others knew it was in his\nmind. . . .\nIn due time after my letters of condolence to the family, I wrote\nhis son and I quote from his reply which is before me :\n\" You ask if anything peculiar happened on the night between\nthe 12th and 13th of April. Nothing peculiar in its literal sense,\nbut that was the night father had a collapse, the one just previous\nto the fatal one ;\noutside this I know of nothing.\" When I recall\nthe intense agony of the voice calling apparently to me, I ask\nmyself if this soul about to wing its way to Eternity, remembering\nwhat it wished to ask of me, tried to reach me that night and\nsaw me where I was to be when I heard of its passing. . . .\nThe vividness of the dream, the intense penetrating call of the\nvoice I can communicate to no one, and these are the only things\nthat make the story worth telling. Cottage near\nwith its steep staircase is\neasily found. My cousin who had the\nterrible experience is still living ; my maid and my notebook\ncan vouch for the truth of the dream, while the funeral card of\nMr. W. and the people at Cottage can do the same for the\ndates. . . .\n[Signed] N. MATHESON.\nIn reply to our request for corroborative evidence and for\nleave to see the original papers referred to, Miss Matheson\nwrote again :\nJanuary 6th, 1913.\nI have put together, as you suggest, \"the documents in the case\"\nand they are at your disposal. They consist of my notebook, the\nletter from H. W. from which I quoted, a letter from his father\nto me a month or two before his death, in which he says how he\nlongs to see me and tell me \"all he hopes and fears,\" my maid's\nstatement, which she thought at first impossible to make without\nmy assistance, but when I told her it would lose all value if I\nsaid one word, she went away and returned in an hour with a\nfairly good outline of the facts. There is also another letter written\nto me since Mr. W.'s death by a member of the family, which\nshows, unintentionally, the reason Mr. W. clung to me as he did.\n\fMAY, 1913. Co88. 71\nI have also written to my cousin as you request. She is living\nat - - and I asked her to tell me in as few words as possible\nif she remembered my first dreams and if so, how much of them.\nWe neither of us kept the letters, for we thought nothing of it at the\ntime, and the blow which fell made any such thing impossible. . . .\nI think I might tell you that the terrible trouble I felt over-\nhanging my cousin, and which fell the night I wrote you of, was\nthe sudden insanity of her only daughter, 28 years old. She was\nso paralysed with fear that she had but one thought, to get away\nfrom people and to me. Fortunately the first condition of the\ninsanity was a frozen state in which her daughter would not speak.\nBut soon after she got to me, it became that of raving insanity,\nand while to-day she is perfectly quiet and good, she has never\nrecovered her mind. It led to so many changes, such a complete\noverturning of every condition that existed at the time she was\ntaken, that it has never been a matter of surprise to me that I felt\nit\ncoming.\nMiss Matheson also told us that she was shortly coming\nto London and could see us and show us her papers. Miss\nJohnson therefore went to call on her, and writes the follow-\ning account of her interview :\nJanuary 23, 1913.\nI went to see Miss Matheson at the Hans Crescent Hotel on\nJan. 15, 1913, and had a long talk with her about her experiences.\nIn regard to the premonitory dreams, dreamt on three successive\nnights, about her cousin, she said that there was absolutely no\nreason for expecting a misfortune of any kind. The illness (mental)\nof the cousin's daughter came on about six weeks later quite sud-\ndenly and with absolutely no warning. It made a great difference\nin Miss Matheson's own life, as she had been appealed to for\nhelp and had taken complete charge of the invalid, who had\nremained under her guardianship ever since, and was with her then.\nThe cousin had lived with Miss Matheson's parents, and so\nwas in the position of a sort of elder sister to her. She is now an\nold lady, and though Miss Matheson was sure that she remembered\nall about the facts, she did not expect that she would be prepared\nto write a detailed statement of them. She has, however, written a\nbrief note of general confirmation.\nAs the illness caused great anxiety and distress to all the family,\nand also brought about a complete change in Miss Matheson's life,\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1913.\n(she gave up her house to go abroad with the invalid), it was\nnatural that the letters which passed between her and her cousin\nat the time had not been kept.\nIn regard to the second dream about the cottage and the wailing\nvoice, Miss Matheson gave me the original account of it, which she\nhad written immediately after waking, before seeing her maid. She\nhad not connected it in any way with Mr. W. When the maid\ncame into her room in the morning, she told her of the dream, and\nit was the maid who first suggested that it might have to do with\nMr. W., since the address of his house was 24 East 51st Street\nin New York. They concluded, however, that it could not refer to-\nhim, because the little old-fashioned and inconvenient cottage was\nutterly unlike any place that he could have lived in or been\nassociated with.\nSome two or three weeks after the dream Miss Matheson began\nto make plans for the summer and determined to try and find a\nhouse in the New Forest for the special benefit of her ward, for\nwhom she thought country of that kind would be suitable. She\nstarted with her maid on May 16th, 1912, motoring through the\nforest, and the only house she could find that seemed at all possible\nwas Cottage. She did not much like the house, as it had not\nthe accommodation and conveniences that she had been accustomed to.\nIn particular the stairs were so narrow and steep that she did not\ngo up them, but sent her maid to look at the upstairs rooms; and\nall the time they were staying there afterwards, she avoided going\nup and downstairs as much as possible. But she told me she was\nquite certain that she was not in any way influenced by her dream\nin taking the house, since she had entirely forgotten it, and neither\nshe nor her maid noticed till afterwards its likeness to the dream\nhouse. She laid special stress on its great unlikeness to any house\nshe had ever taken before ;\nshe had never before stayed in any\nthat could be described as a cottage. She took it on May 16th\nfrom May 29th for four weeks, arranging to enter on May 29th,\nwhich they actually did.\nI saw Miss Matheson's maid, Mabel ,\nwho has written a\nstatement confirming the dream. She repeated to me her recollec-\ntions of the whole matter, and answered various questions. I was\nvery favourably impressed by her as a witness, as all her statements\nseemed to be made with care and thought. She said that the\nstaircase of the cottage was very markedly narrow, steep, and in-\nconvenient, it went straight up from the little hall, opposite to the\n\fMAY, 1913. 0!fl 73\nfront door. She kept a diary and brought it to refer to when I\nasked for the exact dates of their excursion to the New Forest,\netc. The dates given above were dictated to me from this diary,\nand noted by me at the time.\nMiss Matheson gave me various letters, etc., relating to Mr. W.'s\ndeath. He had been a chronic invalid for some years, but she was\nnot in any special anxiety about him at the time of her dream.\nShe heard from him fairly often; he was an intimate friend.\nALICE JOHNSON.\np.S. I read the above to Miss Matheson on Feb. 4, 1913, and\nshe declared it to be correct.\nMiss Johnson went to see Miss Matheson again on February\n4th, 1913, when she dictated to her and afterwards signed the\nfollowing more detailed account of the dream about her cousin :\nThe first night I dreamed that I had been out of the house and\ncoming in I found three members of my cousin's family sitting or\nlying in different rooms in a complete state of exhaustion. They\nwere 3000 miles away in San Francisco, so I was surprised to see\nthem and on showing it they said \"Something terrible is hanging\nover us and we have hurried to get to you.\" I saw my cousin,\nher husband and son; her daughter was not there. I also saw a\ngreat mass of opals thrown together.\nThe next night I dreamed that I had a letter from them saying\nthat something terrible was going to happen to them and they\nwere hurrying to get to me and would be there almost as soon as\nthe letter. The third night I dreamed that something terrible was\ngoing to happen to them and I must get to them myself, and in\nmy dream I went to San Francisco, only to be told that nothing\nwas the matter. But I did not see the daughter in any of the\ndreams.\nOn the same occasion, Miss Matheson dictated to Miss Johnson\nthe following extract from a letter from her cousin, dated Jan.\n11, 1913:\nI do remember your writing that letter speaking of your terrible\ndream of disaster awaiting us. I could not think of anything but\nan earthquake.\nMiss Matheson also obtained for us a statement written\nby her cousin, which is now in our possession, as follows :\nJan. 16, 1913.\nYes, I remember the dream you wrote me about, that a terrible\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1913.\ndisaster was threatening me, and my trying to get to you, and\nhow it was fulfilled by the events that followed.\n[Signed] J. F. BAUMGARTEN.\nIn regard to the dream of the voice heard in the cottage\nin April, 1912, Miss Matheson gave Miss Johnson her original\naccount, written immediately after waking, which is as follows :\nHANS CRESCENT HOTEL, April 13th, 1912.\nIn the Hans Crescent Hotel, London, on the night between April\n12th and 13th, 1912, I had a very vivid dream.\nAs I have never had but one dream before in my life of this\nextremely vivid character and as that came literally true in 6\nweeks' time, I am placing this on record.\nTHE DREAM.\nI dreamt I woke up just at midnight, the clock was striking 12.\nI found myself not in my own room, but in the room of a small\ncottage, such as I had never been in in my life. In a few minutes\nthe feeling came to me that I must go downstairs. It seemed as\nif something was imperatively calling me. I got up, it was bright\nmoonlight, like day, so that I did not require a light, and went\ndown an exceedingly narrow and steep flight of stairs and through\na short hall into a pleasant little cottage parlour with windows at\none end. I presently became conscious of a voice calling,\n\" 24 East\nStreet, 24 East Street.\" It seemed to come from just outside the\nwindow and was so piercing, so agonising, that it frightened me.\nI looked out, but there was nothing but the bright moonlight. The\nwailing voice went on,\n\" 24 East Street, 24 East Street,\" until in\n.a kind of panic I fled up the steep stair again to my bed.\nThough my feeling of panic was real enough for the moment,\nthere was underlying it a sense of well-being, of happiness and\ncontent, which the wailing voice did not seem to really disturb.\nThe dream like my previous one was nothing in itself. It was\nonly its extremely lifelike character that left the impression upon me.\nMiss Matheson added later:\nMy previous dream in September 1889 was dreamt 3 nights in\nsuccession. This dream of April 12-13 but one night.\n[Signed] N. MATHESON.\nThe following statement was written by Miss Matheson's maid :\nJanuary 4fA, 1913.\nOn going to Miss Matheson's rooms as usual on the morning of\nthe 13th of April, 1912, at the Hans Crescent Hotel, she said to\n\fMAY, 1913. 0(1868. 75\nme, \"I have had a most vivid dream of being in a small cottage\nwith such a steep staircase, the like of which I have never seen in\nmy life before. After descending the stairs and entering the parlour\nI heard an unknown voice outside the window calling out to me\n24 East Street, 24 East Street.\"\nKnowing considerable of Mr. W. and his illness I at once said,\n\"Can it in any way be connected with Mr. W. ?\" to which Miss\nMatheson replied, \"Why no, Mr. W. was never in such a cottage\nin his life.\"\nI thought it possible that Mr. W. had passed away and that\nMiss Matheson would soon hear of his death.\nLater in the day, when again speaking of the dream, Miss\nMatheson said, \"I so rarely dream that, when I do, I feel my\ndream must have some meaning.\"\nTime passed and on May 29th we went to a small cottage in\nthe New Forest that Miss Matheson had taken for a month and\nthere on entering the hall, facing us was a steep staircase such as\nMiss Matheson might have seen in her dream.\nTwo days later at the cottage Miss Matheson learned that Mr.\nW. had died on May 29th, the very day we went there.\n[Signed] MABEL\nMiss Matheson also gave Miss Johnson two picture post-\ncards of the cottage in the New Forest to which she went on\nMay 29th, 1912, to show the kind of house it was and\nits surroundings, as described in her first account ;\ntwo letters\nfrom Mr. W. to herself; a printed notice of his death on May\n29th, 1912, and the letter from his son dated Aug. 8, 1912,\nfrom which she quoted in her first account. He writes as\nfollows :\n. . . You ask if \"anything peculiar happened the night of Apr. 12.\"\nNothing \"peculiar\" in its literal sense, but that was the night that\nFather had a collapse, the one just prior to the fatal one. I recall\nthat I was away motoring at the time and learned of it by long\ndistance 'phone. Outside of that I know of nothing of note\nhappening. . . .\nThe fact of the son being away from home at the time\nshowed, as Miss Matheson pointed out, that, though Mr. W.\nwas a chronic invalid, the family were in no special anxiety\nabout him at that date.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1913.\nL. 1196. Dream.\nTHE following case, apparently one of telepathy, has been sent\nto us through an Associate of the Society. The names and\naddresses of those concerned have been given to us, but are by\nrequest withheld from publication.\nThe agent and percipient in this case were A. and his-\nwife B., as they are called here. The first report of the\nexperience was sent to us by A.'s mother, Mrs. Eooke\n(pseudonym), as follows :\nFebruary 3rd, 1913.\nA few days ago I received the following account, from [my\nson and daughter-in-law, A. and B.], of what appears to be a curious\ncase of telepathy.\n\"The other day, the 19th of January, A. was reading Tristram of\nBlent, a book which neither A. nor B. remember to have seen\nbefore. B. was busy about the house in the afternoon, when A.\nwas reading this book, and he said nothing to her about what he\nwas reading. When he came to the following passage he read it\nover several times and made a strong mental note of it :\n'\nIf we\ndivide humanity into those who do things and those who have to get\nout of the way while they are being done, Gainsborough belonged to\nthe latter class.' He said nothing about this. Some hours later\nafter dinner, both were reading, and B. was interested in her book,\nwhen suddenly she had an extraordinary desire to go to sleep im-\nmediately. It was the utmost she could do to tell A. this, for her,\nvery unusual thing, when she curled up on the sofa and dropped\nasleep, knowing nothing more till about two hours later when she\nawoke. In the meantime A. went on reading. After B. had been\nasleep for a considerable time, she began to speak with the subdued\neagerness usual in sleepers' speech: 'They are trying they are\ntrying to . . .' A. leaned forward (he was sitting about ten feet\naway) and said in an ordinary tone :\n'\nYes, what are they trying to\ndo 1\n'\nB. answered without hesitation :\n'\nThe people that have to be\ngot out of the way of? Then she muttered a few syllables, and was\nsilent, sleeping on, in deep slumber, for perhaps an hour till she\nwoke. She changed her position several times, her movements\nbeing those of a very tired and determined sleeper, and she gave\nno sign of being anywhere near waking all the time.\nB. had certainly not looked at the book since it came to the\nhouse, and it is very unlikely that either she or A. had ever seen\n\f3i .-u, r.n:;. Cases. 77\nit before. B. did not even know the title of the book A. was\nreading.\"\nThis is a verbatim copy of the statement as sent to me, as\nrequested, after having heard the story in conversation.\n[Signed] G. ROOKK.\nWe wrote then asking whether A. and B. would also send\nan account of their experience. A. writes :\nFebnary 10, 1913.\nOn the afternoon of Sunday, January 19th, 1913, I was reading\nTristram of Blent. My wife was in and out of the room a good\n<leal, but I did not call her attention to any passage in the book.\nI was specially struck by the following passage, and read it over\nmore than once, pausing for a time in my reading, but saying\nnothing: \"If we divide humanity into those who do things and\nthose who have to get out of the way when they are being done,\nGainsborough belonged to the latter class.\" I remember that my\nwife came into the room while my attention was fixed on this\npassage.\nSome hours later, in the evening, we were both reading, when\nmy wife said, suddenly, that she felt very sleepy, speaking in a\ndrowsy tone, and almost immediately she dropped off into a deep sleep.\nShe did not wake up for about two hours. After she had been\nasleep for some time, she began to speak with the subdued eager-\nness ordinary in such cases, saying, \"they are trying . . .\nthey\nare trying,\" but apparently being unable to say more. I leaned\nforward (I was sitting about 10 feet away) and said, in an ordinary\ntone, \"Yes? What are they trying to do?\" She answered at once,\nin the tone of a person answering such a question :\n\" The people that\nhave to be got out of the way of.\" She then muttered a few syllables,\nand was silent until she awoke, I think not less than an hour\nAfter. While she was speaking, and just before and after, she was\nlying perfectly still with her eyes closed and was certainly asleep.\n[Signed] A. ROOKE.\nB. writes :\nFebruary 10, 1913.\nOn Sunday, Jan. 19th, 1913, my husband and I were reading.\nI was quite interested in my book ; suddenly I felt a strong desire\nfor sleep. I had some difficulty to keep awake long enough to\n-explain to my husband that I was obliged to go to sleep imme-\ndiately an unusual thing for me to do.\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1913.\nI curled up on a sofa and knew nothing more until about\ntwo hours later.\nWhen I awoke my husband asked if I had read the book he\nwas reading. (He felt sure I could not have done so, as it had\nonly just been sent to the house.) I had not read, or even heard\nof it.\nHe then told me that he had been struck by a certain passage\nin his book and that in my sleep I repeated a part of it, using\nalmost the same words.\n[Signed] B. ROOKE.\nIn reply to a further question, Mrs. Rooke writes :\nFebruary Uth, 1913.\nIn regard to the question you ask, as to whether my son ever\nunconsciously reads or repeats aloud sentences that he is particularly\ninterested in, I can answer without any hesitation that I have never\nknown him to do so, and I feel quite sure that he never does. My\ndaughters say the same, and that they could not imagine him doing\nso ;\nit would be so unlike himself.\nAs you ask for a statement from me or my son's wife, to this effect,\nI trust this will be enough without writing to her to confirm it.\n[Signed] GA ROOKE.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nWITH reference to\n\"\nMiss Jones's\n\"\ndream, the account of which\nwas printed in the Journal for April, 1913, pp. 51-56, Mr.\nConstable writes :\nOne fact in this case seems to me peculiarly interesting. If we\nassume that, in the dream, the midnight motor-party and the\ncoloured illustrations were both \"presented\" to Miss Anne Jones,\nwe have a presentation of the present in time and a presentation of\nthe future in time, given to Miss Jones in one and the same dream.\nBut in the dream we have the two presentations related to one\nanother by the presence of Mr. M. \"in very dusty tweeds\" at the\nmidnight motor-party. This fact is evidently \"embroidery\"; it results\nfrom intellectual operation on the part of Miss Jones in, when\ndreaming, using her imagination to link up in time and event two-\nevents unrelated to each other in fact or time.\nThe case appears to me a, very clear one of Miss Jones's having\n\f1913. Correspondence. 79\nIKK! the two \"presentations\" in telepathy (as I define it in 7\nsonality and Telepathy). When the two impressions emerged in\nideas in her intellect, her imagination came into play, in trying to\nreconcile her experience with her normal experience.\nF. C. CONSTABLE.\nDUBLIN LOCAL SECTION OF THE SOCIETY FOR\nPSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nREPORT FOR THK YEAR 1912.\nTHE work of the Dublin Section has been carried on during\nthe year 1912 with a considerable amount of success. We have\nheld sixteen meetings of the Section, with an increased average\nattendance over the previous year. The Hon. Treasurer reports\na small balance of between 5 and 6 in hand, after defraying\nthe various expenses of hire of room for meetings, printing,\nstationery, and travelling expenses. The hon. officers who acted\nlast year agreed to serve again for the year 1913, except the\nhon. treasurer, Dr. Doherty, who, owing to continued ill health,\nis unable to perform the duties, and has sent in his resignation\nof the post. He has now accepted the office of vice-chairman\nof the Dublin Section vice Mr. Thomas Henry Webb, who has\nresigned.\nDuring the past year several of our members have been\nengaged in private circles in various aspects of psychical inves-\ntigation. One group sitting regularly have obtained remarkable\nresults in the use of the so-called Ouija Board, and the pre-\nliminary report by Sir William Barrett and the Rev. Savell\nHicks of the results so far obtained was read at the\nmeeting of the parent Society on December 9th, and at our\nlocal Section on December 19th, 1912. The experiments are still\nbeing continued, and we hope that they will encourage other\nmembers to devote some of their time to investigation.\nTHE WESTON VICARAGE POLTERGEIST.\nENQUIRIES have reached us about the alleged manifestations\nat Weston Vicarage, near Otley, which were reported in the\nYorkshire Observer in the beginning of April. Accounts by\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1913.\nthe Kev. Charles Tweedale, Vicar of Weston, appeared in the\nYorkshire Observer for April 2nd and 7th, 1913, and in the\nlatter of these accounts Mr. Tweedale wrote :\nIn conclusion, I may say that the Society for Psychical Eesearch\nhave made a most exhaustive investigation of the psychic phenomena\nwith which we have been favoured, and have interviewed and cross-\nexamined a score of witnesses who have resided in the house. The\nresult has heen to more than justify every word we have said. . . .\nThe Society for Psychical Research are still investigating and obser-\nving the phenomena, and every opportunity will be given to their\nofficers to do so in the future. . .\nThe Editor of the Yorkshire Observer applied to us for\ninformation on the subject, and Miss Newton replied as follows :\nSir, April 8th, 1913.\nIn reply to your enquiry received this morning, it is true that\none of our investigators has been three times to Weston Vicarage\nto enquire into the phenomena reported as having occurred there.\nHe has collected a great deal of evidence on the subject from present\nand former members of the household, but has not yet come to a\ndefinite conclusion regarding it.\nThe Society for Psychical Research are hoping to avail themselves\nof the opportunity offered to their officials by Mr. Tweedale, in his\nletter printed in your issue of April 7th, for continuing the investi-\ngation.\nYours, etc.,\nISABEL NEWTON\n(Secretary, S.P.K.).\nThis letter was, however, printed in a mutilated form in the\nYorkshire Observer of April llth, 1913, immediately following\none from Mr. Tweedale, so that it may have given readers the\nmisleading impression of having been written spontaneously to\nendorse Mr. Tweedale's statement, which was not the case.\nWe may add that the phenomena as to which our investigator\nhas collected evidence from Mr. Tweedale and members of his\nhousehold were far less remarkable than would be gathered\nfrom the descriptions recently appearing in the newspapers.\n\fNo. CCC.

I'.M::. I'r'tntfr Mn't', ,,<i f,,i< Members and Associates. 83\nLondon, W., on Wednesday, May 28th, 1913, at 5.30 p.m. ;\nthe President, PROFESSOR HENRI BERGSON, in the chair.\nTHE PRESIDENT delivered an Address, which will shortly be\npublished in the Proceedings. The following abstract is reprinted\nfrom Tin 1\nTimes by special permission :\nPROFESSOR BERGSON, who spoke in French, began by thanking the\nSociety for the honour it had done him in making him its President.\nHe had done nothing to deserve this honour. He himself had not\nseen anything of psychical research, nor had he made experiments\nor observations. Since the foundation of the Society, however, he\nhad followed its publications with the greatest attention. He admired\nthe indefatigable perseverance and the extreme ingenuity which it had\nbrought to its investigations. He admired also the courage with\nwhich it had braved the prejudices of a part of the learned world.\nWhence came these prejudices, which, by the way, were in process\nof diminishing and of disappearing ?\nThey were due to several reasons,\nsome superficial, others profound.\nIn the first place the method which the Society was often obliged\nto employ disconcerted many minds. But the facts which the Society\nstudied were natural facts. Thus to take the example of\n\"\ntrue\n\"\nor\n<;\ntelepathic\n\"\nhallucinations that was to say, of the alleged\napparition of a dying person, for instance, to a relation or a friend\nit was quite evident to M. Bergson that, if that fact was real, it\nwas subject to laws, as were all the facts of nature, and that, conse-\nquently, this fact itself, or at least a part of it, ought to be able to\nbe reproduced by us at will experimentally, if we knew its condi-\ntions. Indeed, in his opinion, if telepathy was a reality, it was pro-\nbable, or at least possible, that it was taking place constantly with\nevery one, but too feebly to be noticed, or neutralized by certain\nobstacles. There, then, was a fact which, if it was real, ought, it\nwould seem, to lend itself to the methods of study which were em-\nployed in the natural sciences. But not at all. The Society for\nPsychical Research was obliged to study it by a method which on\ncertain sides resembled that of the historian and on others that of the\ndetective or of the judge, collating evidence, comparing it, criticizing\nit. There, in the opinion of certain men of science, was an anomaly\nwhich embarrassed them and which resulted in their preferring tr\nhave nothing to do with that class of phenomena.\nI\nBut this was not the principal reason. The true reason was to\nfound in a certain bent which all our minds had contracted during\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1913.\nthe last three or four centuries, under the influence of the metaphysic\nand the science which had developed since the Renaissance. Experi-\nmental method, as for three centuries it had been understood, was\nessentially turned towards measure. Even when the object studied\nwas not directly measurable, even when we must limit ourselves to\ngiving a description of it, we so arranged as to retain of that object\nonly the aspect by which, later on, it might become measurable.\nNow, the phenomena of thought, of feeling, or, more generally, of the\nmind, were not measurable. Science tended, then, naturally, to\nsubstitute cerebral facts for these phenomena themselves, and to\nconsider the mental as the exact equivalent of the cerebral. Thence\nthe theory of the exact parallelism of the cerebral with the mental,\na theory which had become so natural to us that we spoke almost\nindifferently of the mind or of the brain. Now, it was because the\nfacts with which psychical research was concerned seemed to square\nbadly with this theory, not to be able to be explained by it although\nthis had been by no means proved that one was led a priori to con-\nsider them as illusory.\nM. Bergson proceeded to point out that in his view the theory of\nthe rigorous parallelism of the cerebral with the mental was a pure\nmetaphysical hypothesis which was neither proved nor even sug-\ngested by the facts. He recalled, in reference to this subject, the\nstudy which he formerly made of the diseases of memory. The only\nfunction of thought, he said, which it has been possible so far to\nattach to such or such a part of the cerebral cortex was the memory\nmore precisely the memory of words. The study of the various\naphasias had led, indeed, to localizing in such or such cerebral cir-\ncumvolutions the visual memory of words, the auditive memory of\nwords, the motive memory of words, and so on. Now, he had shown\nalready by psychological analyses, and this had been confirmed\nrecently by considerations of an anatomical nature as could be\nseen in the works of Dr. Pierre Marie that the classic theory of the\naphasias was untenable. He had shown that the brain must be an\norgan of the recalling of things remembered, far more than an organ\nof preservation. The role of the brain was to bring back the remem-\nbrance of an action, to prolong the remembrance in movements.\nNow, in a general way, it could be said that that was the role of\nthe brain. If one could see all that takes place in the interior of\nthe brain, one would find that that which takes place there cor-\nresponds to a small part only of the life of the mind. The brain\nsimply extracts from the life of the mind that which is capable of\n\f:\n.i\nINK, 1913. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 85\nrepresentation in movement. The cerebral life is to the mental life\nwhat the movements of the baton of a conductor are to the\nsymphony.\nThe brain, then, is that which allows the mind to adjust itself exactly\nto circumstances. It is the organ of attention to life. Should it\nbecome deranged, however slightly, the mind is no longer fitted to\nthe circumstances ;\nit wanders, dreams. Many forms of mental\nalienation are nothing else. But from this it results that one of the\nroles of the brain is to limit the vision of the mind, to render its action\nmore efficacious. This is what we observe in regard to the memory,\nwhere the rule of the brain is to mask the useless part of our past in\norder to allow only the useful remembrances to appear. Certain\nuseless recollections, or dream remembrances, manage nevertheless\nto appear also, and to form a vague fringe around the distinct recol-\nlections. It would not be at all surprising if perceptions of the organs\nof our senses, useful perceptions, were the result of a selection or of\na canalization worked by the organs of our senses in the interest of\nour action, but that there should yet be around those perceptions\na fringe of vague perceptions, capable of becoming more distinct in\nextraordinary, abnormal cases. Those would be precisely the cases\nwith which psychical research would deal.\nOn the other hand, it is space which creates multiplicity and dis-\ntinction. It is by their bodies that the different human personalities\nare radically distinct. But if it is demonstrated that human con-\nsciousness is partially independent of the human brain, since the\ncerebral life represents only a small part of the mental life, it is very\npossible that the separation between the various human conscious-\nnesses may not be so radical as it seems to be. There must certainly\nexist, in the normal state, mechanisms which neutralize this endos-\nmose between consciousnesses, if this endosmose is a real thing, for\nit could not be other than very embarrassing. But it is conceivable\nthat at certain moments these mechanisms work badly ; an^Kere;\ngain, facts for the criticism of psychical research would be\nThe field open to psychical research was. then, very wide :\none could say what were its limits.\nProfessor Bergson asked, in conclusion, what would have\nif all our science, for three centuries past, had been directed towards\nthe knowledge of the mind, instead of towards that of matter if,\nfor instance, Kepler and Galileo and Newton had been psychologists ?\nPsychology, he said, would have attained developments of which\none could no more form an idea than people had been able, before\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1913.\nKepler and Galileo and Newton, to form an idea of our astronomy\nand of our physics. Probably, instead of their being disdained A\npriori, all the strange facts with which psychical research was con-\ncerned would have been sought out minutely. Probably we should\nhave had a vitalist biology quite different from ours, perhaps also\na different medicine, or therapeutics by way of suggestion would\nhave been pushed to a point of which we could form no idea. But\nwhen the human mind, having pushed thus far the science of mind,\nhad turned towards inert matter, it \\vould have been confused as\nto its direction, not knowing how to set to work, not knowing how\nto apply to this matter the processes with which it had been success-\nful up till then. The world of physical, and not that of psychical,\nphenomena would then have been the world of mystery. It was,\nhowever, neither possible nor desirable that things should have hap-\npened thus. It was not possible, because at the dawn of modern\ntimes mathematical science already existed, and it was necessary,\nconsequently, that the mind should pursue its researches in a direc-\ntion to which that science was applicable. Nor was it desirable,\neven for the science of mind, for there would always have been wanting\nto that science something infinitely precious the precision, the\nanxiety for proof, the habit of distinguishing that which is certain\nand that which is simply possible or probable. The sciences con-\ncerned with matter could alone give to the mind that precision, that\nrigour, those scruples. Let us now approach the science of mind\nwith these excellent habits, renouncing the bad metaphysic which\nembarrasses our research, and the science of the mind will attain\nresults surpassing all our hopes.\nAt the conclusion of M. Bergson's address,\nMR. A. J. BALFOUR rose and said : It is not usual to follow our\nPresident's address with either commentary or discussion, but as an\nold president of this Society I think I am probably translating your\nsecret thoughts when I take the opportunity in your name, without\nasking your leave, to thank M. Bergson for one of the most interesting\nthe most interesting and illuminating address which this Society\nhas ever received. Most of us know M. Bergson by reputation who,\nindeed, does not ? but few of us have had an opportunity of hearing\nhim. Those of us who have had that opportunity to-night will leave\nthis hall congratulating themselves on the good fortune which has\nbrought them to this meeting, on an occasion which must be so pro-\nfoundly interesting to the whole future of our Society.\n\fJUNE, 1D13. The Case of ChcurUs P. Breivin. 87\nTHE CASE OF CHARLES 1'. 1JKKWIN.\nTHE April number of the Jxunu'l of the American Society for\nr*yrhinil Ii'f.^-.trch contains an interesting report of a case of\nsecondary personality, somewhat similar to the case of Ansel\nBourne (see Proc. S.P.K., Vol. VII, p. 221). The subject in\nthis case was Mr. Charles P. Brewin, a merchant tailor of\nBurlington, N.J. Mr. Brewin disappeared from home on Nov. 9,\n1903, and nothing was heard of him for nearly four years.\nOn June 24 or 25, 1907, a trolley-car conductor, who had\nlived as a boy in Burlington, saw Mr. Brewin in Plainh'eld, N.J.,\nand spoke to him by name. Mr. Brewin, however, asserted\nthat his name was Johnson, and when a day or two later his\nson and brother came to see him, he did not recognise them.\nSeveral newspaper reporters also visited him, and he appeared\nto be much worried and perplexed over the question of his\nidentity. On Sunday, June 30, 1907, Mrs. Dunn, in whose\nhouse he was living under the name of Frank G. Johnson, went\nout, and he was left for some hours alone. His restoration to\nhis normal self is described by Mrs. Dunn as follows :\n. . . When I came home I rang the bell and saw him through the\ncurtain, staggering to the door. He opened the door and stood still\nlooking at me, and said :\n\"\nWho are you 1\n\"\nI said,\n\"\nDon't you\nknow me, Mr. Johnson 1\n\"\nHe replied,\n\" I never saw you before.\"\nI came in and he remarked :\n\" Are you Mrs. Dunn, of Norwood\nAvenue, Plainfield, New Jersey?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Do you live\nhere?\" he further asked. \"Yes,\" I replied. He then said: \"I saw\na tax bill on the table with that name on it and I found myself\nhere in a strange place. I do not know how I came here, but I\nhave been asleep and was suddenly awakened by the explosion of a\npistol, or gun, or cannon, close to my head. It startled me so that\nI awoke out of this sound sleep. I jumped out of the chair and\nhad to support myself by the table and chair. I had to sit down\nagain until this dizzy feeling, and finding everything strange about\nme, went over. I could not find my hat or coat. I went out\nand walked about to see if I could find any one I knew, but came\nback with everything strange about me. If I could have found my\nhat and coat I would have gone away. I was afraid to go and\nlook for them, thinking that people who lived here might return\nand imagine I was a burglar.\"\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1913.\n\"\nWell, who are you ?\n\"\nI asked, noticing that there was something\nstrange in his condition and behaviour. He replied :\n\"\nMy name is\nCharles P. Brewin, merchant tailor of Burlington, N.J., and I can't\nunderstand how I came here to Plainfield. Do you know how I\ncame here 1 Do you know anything about it ? Find my coat and\nhat. I want to get off on the next train.\" I then said,\n\" You have\nbeen sick and have been with me for some little time.\" He replied,\n\"Oh, no. I left Burlington yesterday.\" He complained of his head\nbeing dizzy and that he could not collect his ideas, and urged me\nto get his hat and coat, saying,\n\"\nMy wife will be terribly worried !\n\"\nThis was the first time he had ever mentioned he had a family.\nHe went on : \"I am not in the habit of staying away from home\nat night.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"you are in a strange place. I shall\ngo and find when the train goes and tell you. You wait and do\nnot try to get to Burlington until I get back.\" He replied that he\nwould stay, and that he had been afraid to go prowling about the\nhouse for fear he would be taken for a burglar.\nThe case is also described by Dr. Buchanan, the doctor who\nknew Mr. Brewin as Frank Johnson, and was called in to see\nhim immediately after his return to normal consciousness. Dr.\nBuchanan writes as follows :\nSeptember, 1907.\n... To prepare my account, I would say that I have some\nrecollection of the excitement caused at the time of the disappearance\nof Chas. P. Brewin from his Burlington home, the finding of certain\neffects a hat and note, I think in a New York ferry boat, and the\nfruitless attempts to locate him. My actual acquaintance with\nFrank G. Johnson was formed on a professional visit to the lady\nwith whom he boarded, Dec. 7, 1905. He was introduced to me as\nMr. Johnson, seemed to be a perfect gentleman, quiet, unobtrusive,\nand anxious to do what lay in his power to assist in the time of\nneed. I met him subsequently to this several times, sat in the\nsame pew with him in church and shared the same hymn book,\nmet him at his presser's bench, where he was emplo}\nr\ned, at various\nentertainments, on trolleys, etc., and have had many short con-\nversations with him. As Frank Gr. Johnson, my opinion of him\nwas that of a quiet, unassuming bachelor, of a devoutly religious\nturn, with no vices, and with sufficient money to supply his needs\nand permit him to extend a helping hand where needed, which he\n\f1913. The Case of Charle8 \/'. Jirrtvin. 89\nalways did freely and generously. In short, I never for a moment\nhad a suspicion that Frank G. Johnson was any one but Frank G.\nJohnson, a journeyman clothes-presser and tailor, and a gentleman.\nSo much for Frank G. Johnson. Thursday morning, June 27, my\nfather, Rev. J. C. Buchanan, formerly pastor of the Baptist church\nat Pemberton, N.J., a town ten or twelve miles from Burlington,\ncalled my attention to an item in the Philadelphia Press, to the effect\nthat Chas. P. Brewin had been found in Plainfield by a trolley con-\nductor named Alfred Woolman later known as a relative of a former\nSunday school scholar of Mr. Brewin and identified as his proper\nself; that his relatives had been summoned, but that to everybody\nhe positively denied his identity as Brewin, insisting his name was\nJohnson. I told my father I knew a Johnson, and on my describing\nhim, he was satisfied that it must be Brewin, and later, on a trip down\ntown, he met Mr. A. L. Fone, Editor of the Daily Press, and made\nfurther inquiries of him, and in turn gave him the information in.\nhis possession. From this the reporters got hold of the case, and\nfrom then on the life of Frank G. Johnson was one perpetual pester\nand annoyance from this and other purely curious sources. I\nmention this because I firmly believe it to be the cause for the\nclearing up of the case. I am told by those intimately associated\nwith him, that from the time his brother and son first saw him\nthere began to show evidence of a mental struggle going on as to\nwhether his identity was what he claimed it to be. He would ask\nhis employer if he wasn't Johnson, etc., and would brood and stew\nover it till his head ached. To such a pitch did this worry extend,\nthat, on the Saturday evening previous to his awakening, his head\nached so and was so congested, that he was compelled to stay in\nthe store long after closing and keep quiet. In other words,\nphysical causes were awakening to clear up the fog of four years,\nand the old areas of mental processes were again grasping after old\nand familiar facts, under the stimulus of old ideas and faces, brought\nto a brain acting under increased blood pressure and excitement.\nSo much for Frank G. Johnson. Sunday evening, June 30, 1907, I\nwas summoned by Brewings landlad}*, Mrs. Dunn, to come at once, as\nMr. Johnson had suddenly waked up and become Brewin. I went\nat once, taking my father, who had known Brewin years before and\nvery intimately. Arriving at the house, I told my father to wait in the\nhall, while I went in the kitchen, where I found him eating a bit of\nbread and butter, with a cup of tea. I found him white and some-\nwhat weak, but perfectly clear mentally. My first remark,\n\"\nWell,\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1913.\nMr. Brewin, I see you have come to yourself at last,\" elicited the\nreply,\n\" Who are you 1\n\"\nTo my reply I added that I had a gentle-\nman with me whom he probably knew. Calling my father in, Brewin\ngave him one look, jumped to his feet saying,\n\"\nMr. Buchanan, how\nare you?\" and greeted him cordially. We then went into the\nparlour, and all sat down, where we tried to get him acquainted with\nfacts as they existed. But it was a hard job. Had it not been for\nmy father, who was the only one he knew as Brewin, and in whom\nhe had implicit confidence, I think nothing we said would have\nbeen believed. He told us of his awakening as if by a pistol shot,\nfinding himself in a strange place, his fear of being thought a burglar,\netc., all of which data you already have, and repetition is useless\nhere. So, too, is a detailed account of many things that occurred\nin the evening. To be brief, everything \"Johnson\" and all of\n\"Johnson's\" acts and acquaintanceships were gone, and Brewin was\nback where he left off four years ago, and yet, note this, Brewin\nwas not clear on all points of Brewin's past ;\nthe full clearing of\nhis brain came rapidly, fact by fact. Of the many interesting bits\nI recall during that evening talk, were his insistence that he left\nBurlington an evening or so before, and he must get back or his\nwife would worry about him ;\nhis telling me of his membership in\nthe Burlington Lodge of Foresters ;\nand his blank surprise when\ntold he had joined in Plainfield the previous March, and had a\npolicy made out to an Anna Johnson, his sister, for $1,000, all of\nwhich had documentary evidence ;\nhis after failure to recognize the\ndog he petted, the landlady he had boarded with two years, her son\nwith whom he had stock dealings, his garden that he had planted,\netc. About 10 p.m. I saw he was getting tired, and I told him he\nhad better go to bed, and again I was amused at his asking where\nto go. I took him to his room and he recognised nothing, asked if he\nhad slept there before, etc. He sat on the edge of the bed, put his\nhand in his pocket and drew out a black pocket-book and said,\n\"Why, that isn't mine, my pocket-book is red.\" He disclaimed\nownership of the watch and chain he took off, which were not\nthe ones he had when he left (which he described, and which\ndescription was the next day verified by his son), went to the closet\nand recognized none of the clothes there, though he had worn them\nall. He saw a card, on the bureau, of his present employer and asked\nwho that was. I told him it was the card of the lady by whom he\nwas employed, which didn't please him, and he emphatically declared\nhe was a boss tailor and worked for no women. I finally got him\n\f.ii NT, 1913. The Case of Charles P. Brewin. 91\nto bed, and he slept quietly till nine the next morning, awakening\nclear in mind and with less distress in his head than he had had as\nBrewin, four years before. Later in the day his brother and son came\non. The recognition was mutual and immediate, and later in the day\nBrewin left for Pavonia to see the wife he left\n\"\nthe evening before,\"\nfour years ago. After a week or so he came back with his wife,\nand is filling out at the same bench the time he contracted for with\nMiss Brown as Frank G. Johnson. His four years are a perfect\nblank. He tells me he remembers nothing that took place, even\nthough he is again working in the same scenes of his last two years\nas Johnson. His health is better, and he suffers less pain in his\nhead, though he cannot stand exposure to the sun. In short, his\nemployer has now working for her a Mr. Brewin, who is, with the\nexception of a vastly improved mentality, the Frank G. Johnson,\nand the said Brewin is quite as often addressed as Johnson as he is\nas Brewin.\nOf most of this interesting case you already have notes that\nare copious and exact, and I need not repeat them here. I simply\nwant to add that the genuineness of the case is unquestionable.\nEven now Brewin is having trouble in collecting back pension\ndue to him for the period of his existence as Johnson. The\nprincipal facts that have struck me, psychical and physical, are\nthese :\n1. The similarity between Johnson and Brewin in character. Both\nare identical church-goers, quiet, unassuming ;\nneither smokes, drinks\nnor swears; both enjoy and frequently take trolley rides for pure\npleasure, enjoy church fairs and are liberal patrons. Both have a\n\" hanker\" for minstrel shows.\n2. The retention in Johnson of all professional skill that Brewin\npossessed in the matter of tailoring in all its aspects, and Brewin\nwas an expert tailor.\n3. The retention by Johnson of much of the head distress, and\nremedies therefor, that Brewin had, and since describes as having\nhad, as Brewin, for years. Johnson used peppermint constantly to\ncool his head, a favourite remedy of Brewin's.\n4. The absolute loss by Brewin of his store of memories of Brewin\nthat represented his life in every aspect, as I can analyze it, except as\nstated in 1, 2; and 3.\n5. The creation of Frank G. Johnson, with all it gives rise to in\nthe way of query. When did Johnson evolve from Brewin? Why\nwas he Johnson and not Smith 1 Where did he set his stock of\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1913.\nparents, relatives, etc., as Johnson? Who were the friends he had\nsince he was Brewin no more? etc.\n6. And, finally, what is the physical basis ? . . .\nLook at the history : Increased blood pressure from worry and\nthought as to his identity, finally severe headaches, a crack, and the\nmind clears, and gradually, fact by fact, the whole past life of Brewin\nreturns and Brewin is himself again. But where did Johnson go?\nFor he has gone and his four years are gone, and a careful\nexamination yesterday (Sept. 21, '07) shows no evidence of hi&\npresence.\nAs to the way in which Mr. Brewin spent the period of\nhis absence, the facts, so far as they can be ascertained, are as\nfollows: He left home on November 9, 1903; in April, 1905,\nhe came to Plainfield (ostensibly from New York), and applied\nfor work to Miss Brown, who kept a dyeing and pressing\nestablishment.\n\"\nWhen he came she did not like his looks,\nand was reluctant to employ him, but in response to the desire\nto let him show what he could do, she set him to pressing as\nan experiment, and found him an excellent workman, and gave\nhim employment. . . . His work was satisfactory and regular.\"\nIn October, 1905, he went to board with Mrs. Dunn. She\nand several other people, who knew him at this time, describe\nhim as a man of\n\"\nexemplary habits,\" very quiet and regular in\nhis way of life.\n\"\nHe neither smoked nor drank.\" He\nfrequently complained of headaches, and was said to have had\na\n\"\nspell\n\"\nin church, which was attributed to heart trouble. He\ndoes not seem to have said much of his own antecedents. He\ntold Mrs. Dunn that\nhis father was an Englishman. He did not give his father's full\nname nor where he lived. But he said his father's mother had married\na second time and be himself, Mr. Johnson's father, did not like his\nstepfather, and left home as a boy or young man and came to this\ncountry. His father's mother had frequently sent money to his father\nfrom England. Hints here and there showed that his father lived in\nthe country, but no particular place was mentioned. . . . His father\nmarried a second time after the death of his mother, the second wife\nstill living (in New York I understood) and had a daughter by her,\na stepsister, whom an insurance policy, taken out while he was\nJohnson, named as beneficiary.\n\fJUKE, 1913. The Case of Charles P. Breioin. 93\nThis policy was taken out in the Foresters for $1,000, Mr.\nBrewin being already insured in this society under his own\nname. In his application as Frank G. Johnson he gave the\ndate of his birth as February 22, 1858, he stated that his\nfather had died at the age of 61 years as the result of a fall\nfrom his horse, and that his mother had died at the age of 43\nyears of pneumonia. He named as his own trade that of mer-\nchant tailor. In case of his death, the insurance money was to\nbe paid to Anna D. Johnson, aged 23.\nThese statements contain a curious mixture of truth and\nfalsity. Mr. Brewin was born on February 22, 1848, exactly\nten years earlier than the date given as that of Johnson's birth,\nhis father died of pneumonia (not his mother, as stated by\nJohnson), at the age of 47, his mother died at the age of 70\nfrom old age. It is to be noted that his mother survived his\nfather, and there is, therefore, no truth in the statement made\nto Mrs. Dunn as to his father having married again and having\nhad a daughter, the stepsister mentioned in the insurance policy.\nSo far as is known, there was no such person as Anna D.\nJohnson in existence. It is true that Mr. Brewin was a merchant\ntailor, but Johnson, at the time when the insurance policy was\ntaken out, was working as a presser of clothes. The date of\nthe policy was February 15, 1907, only a few months before\nMr. Brewin's return to normal consciousness.\nIt will be observed that Mr. Brewin came to Plainfield in\nApril, 1905, having left home in November, 1903. There is,\ntherefore, a period of nearly eighteen months to be accounted for.\nAs to what Mr. Brewin did during this period nothing has been\nascertained. He told Mrs. Dunn that he had worked for various\ntailoring firms in New York. One of these declared that they\nhad never employed any such man ;\nthere is no statement in the\nreport as to whether the other firms have been questioned.\nMr. Brewin also stated that he had known in New York a\nDr. Fithian, whom he had met in connexion with some mission-\nary work at a Baptist church in West 16th Street. It has not\nbeen possible to find any one called Fithian connected with that\nchurch during the period of Mr. Brewin's supposed stay in New\nYork. A Mr. Fithian began to attend services there in the\nsummer of 1908, but he knew nothing of Frank G. Johnson.\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1913.\nOne other incident of interest has been noted in connexion\nwith Mr. Brewin's restoration to his primary state of conscious-\nness. It was on the 24th or 25th of June, 1907, that the\nquestion of\n\"\nFrank Johnson's\n\"\nidentity was first raised by the\ntrolley car conductor ;\nin the course of the next few days, Mr.\nBrewin saw (and failed to recognise) his son and his brother:\nhe was also interviewed by several newspaper reporters. On\nSaturday night, June 29, 1907, he told Mrs. Dunn of a\ndream he had in the store,\n. . . that he had fallen asleep on the counter where he was press-\ning clothes. He dreamed that he was at Asbury Park and saw a\nlarge boarding house. There was a piazza in front and the ap-\nproach to it was a broad walk. The peculiar feature of the walk\nwas a tree growing up in the centre of it. ... He said the dream\nmade an impression on his mind and he referred to it several\ntimes that evening.\nSunday morning he told me he had had the same dream during\nthe night and repeated the details as before He said :\n\" I believe\nI could go to Asbury Park and find that house.\" I said: \"Of\ncourse, it was all a dream, and the house does not exist.\" But he\nsaid it all seemed so real to him.\nOn Monday morning, July 1, 1907, after Mr. Brewin's\nreturn to his primary personality, Mrs. Dunn told him of\nthis dream.\nHe at once spoke up :\n\" Did I tell you I dreamed that ? There\nwas just such a place as that. We went there several successive\nsummers. The proprietor was a man by the name of Brown. . . .\"\nHe said :\n\" It is the same name as yours,\" referring to Miss\nBrown [his employer at Plainfield]. . . . He then asked Miss\nBrown if she would be so kind as to write to the man, giving the\nnumber on Third Avenue, Asbury Park, and see if this was\ncorrect. The son confirmed the fact that they had visited the\nplace described.\nThe dream is interesting as marking the first re-emergence\nof Mr. Brewin's lost memories. It was perhaps the con-\nnexion through the name Brown with his life as Frank\nJohnson which caused this particular memory to be evoked.\n\fJUNE, 1913. 77\" Case of Charles P. Brewin. 95\nAs to the circumstances which led to the loss of memory\nDr. Hyslop writes :\nOn questioning him I find that he had a sunstroke in 1865,\nwhile in the war, and has always felt the effect of sunheat ever\nsince. He is more sensitive to it now than before his lapse of\nnormal personality. He ever afterwards had a pain in his head,\naffecting the back part of it\nespecially. He says he used to tell\nhis doctor that there was something 'clodding' his brain in the\nback of his head. In 1879 he ... heard a sound like a pistol\nshot in his head. He soon became dizzy, ... he was examined by\na Mt. Holly physician who said the trouble was with his eye. . . .\nThen a physician at a hospital finally told him he had a hemor-\nrhage of a blood vessel in the left eye. . . .\nProbably it was the\nbursting of this vessel that he had felt as a pistol shot.\nBefore he disappeared from home, his wife says, he had not been\nable to attend to business. . . . Mrs. Brewin says he left home on\nMonday morning, November 9, 1903. He had not been out of bed\nfor some time, but Sunday morning [November 8, 1903] he came\ndownstairs. . . . He got up the next morning and seemed nervous,\nand left the house about 8 a.m. He said he was going to the\nstore. . . . Her daughter-in-law's brother saw him in the station.\n. . . That was the last that was known of him until they learnt\nsome days later that he had been seen crossing the ferry on the\nDelaware river.\nIt is interesting to compare this account of the physical\nconditions preceding Mr. Brewin's lapse from his primary per-\nsonality with those in the case of Ansel Bourne. Mr. Bourne\nalso had suffered from a very severe sunstroke, and he had\nhad, as a young man, trouble with his eyes and frequent\nheadaches. His experience at the time of his return to normal\nconsciousness is also not unlike that of Mr. Brewin.\nOn the morning of Monday, March 14th, about five o'clock, he\nheard, he says, an explosion like the report of a gun or pistol,\nand, waking, he noticed that there was a ridge in his bed not like\nthe bed he had been accustomed to sleep in. ... He felt very\nweak, and thought he had been drugged. His next sensation was\nthat of fear, knowing that he was in a place where he had no\nbusiness to be. He feared arrest as a burglar. . . .\n[Proc.

JUNE, 1913\nThe two cases are also similar in the fact that there was\nnot an absolutely complete cleavage between the primary and\nsecondary personalities. The most noticeable points of dis-\nsimilarity between the cases are :\n(1) The lapse from the primary state of consciousness lasted\nin the case of Ansel Bourne for only eight weeks, whereas in\nMr. Brewin's case it lasted four years ;\n(2) The return to the primary state of consciousness was with\nAnsel Bourne spontaneous, whereas with Mr. Brewin it was no\ndoubt hastened, if not wholly induced, by the car-conductor's\nrecognition of him and the events consequent on this.\nDr. Hyslop was anxious to try some experiments in hypno-\ntism, as were tried in the case of Ansel Bourne, with a view\nto recovering\n\"\nFrank Johnson's\n\"\nlost memories, but this was\nnot allowed. It is unfortunate that there is no evidence at\nall as to how Mr. Brewin spent the first eighteen months after\nhe left home. There does not, however, seem to be any reason\nfor suspecting fraud ;\nthere was no apparent motive for fraud,\nand Mr. Brewin's conduct from the time when he first came\nunder observation as Frank Johnson was such as to convince\nall who came into contact with him of his complete\nhonesty.\nIn summing up the case, Dr. Hyslop says :\nThere is no special conclusion to be maintained, except that the\nevidence, so far as it\ngoes, tends to establish a genuine case of\nsecondary personality, with complete cleavage between the primary\nand secondary states, in so far as self-consciousness and normal\nmemory are concerned, though there is as distinct evidence that the\nmental contents of the two states sometimes interfused and sometimes\ndid not, the secondary state adding incidents that were not provably\na part of the normal memory.\nIn April, 1913, Mr. Brewin was reported to be still\nperfectly normal and carrying on business on his own account.\nH.

WOOLLEY read a paper on\n\"\nThe '\nThinking\n'\nHorses of Elberfeld,\" Mr. Bullough describ-\ning the history of the case, and Dr. Woolley the experiments\nwhich he and Mr. Bullough conducted. The following is an\nabstract of the paper :\nMR. BULLOUGH related how in 1890 a certain Herr von Osten\nobserved that a horse, which he used to ride and drive, responded\napparently intelligently to commands. He took up the idea of per-\nfecting this rudimentary education. After a short period of training,\nhe succeeded in obtaining perfect responses to orders such as\n\"\nstop,\"\n\fJULY, 1913. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 99\n\" turn to the left,\"\n\"\nwalk,\" etc., and was able to drive his horse,\nwithout touching the reins, along even the crowded thoroughfares\nof Berlin. The success of this teaching suggested to him the idea of\nputting his horse through a regular course of instruction, when the\nhorse, subsequently known as \"\nHans I.,\" died.\nIn 1900 he bought a five-year-old Russian stallion, destined to\nbecome \"der kluge Hans\" who, as the result of a prolonged and\npatient course of instruction, acquired a surprising proficiency in\nelementary arithmetic and spelling. In September, 1904, public\ncuriosity having been aroused, a committee was formed to investigate\nthe case. This first committee was chiefly concerned with the\nquestion as to whether any trick, in the sense of an intentional aid\non the part of the questioner, was responsible for the results obtained.\nThe conclusion arrived at by the committee was that no trick or\neven unintentional sign was employed, but they reserved their opinion\nas to the intellectual powers of the horse.\nA further investigation was undertaken in October, 1904, by\nProfessor Stumf, together with Dr. von Hornbostel and Dr. Pfungst-\nThe result was to discredit Hans's alleged intelligence. The\ninvestigators concluded that the horse was guided in his answers\nby a visual sign in the shape of unconscious movements of the head\non the part of the questioner, these movements being so small as\nto have completely escaped the notice of the previous committee.\nIn 1905, however, von Osten came into contact with Herr Krallr\na jeweller of Elberfeld, who had never previously handled horsesr\nand was interested only in the scientific aspect of the matter.\nAfter working with Hans, he became convinced that the animal\npossessed genuine intelligence, and decided to try experiments of\nhis own. In 1908, therefore, he bought two Arab stallions, Muhamed\nand Zarif, and began with them a systematic course of instruction, on\nthe lines of elementary school-teaching. Spatial relations, counting,\nthen addition and subtraction, the multiplication table (up to 12x12)\nand division, date-reckoning, squaring and the extraction of roots,\nreading and spelling (with a much simplified spelling table) were\nsuccessively explained and demonstrated. Mr. Krall is of opinion\nthat mere arithmetical performances are no satisfactory test of\nintelligence, since it is well known that even mentally-deficient\nhuman beings are capable of performing the most remarkable\ncalculating feats. He was, therefore, anxious to use arithmetic only\nas an avenue to mutual understanding and as a basis especially\nof spontaneous utterances on the part of the horses. He gives in\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1913.\nhis book several instances of such spontaneous utterances, and told\nthe investigators of others, which, granting the initial assumption\nof intelligence, are certainly interesting in the highest degree.\nThe first step in the training of the horse is to \"\ntame \"\nhim, i.e. to\nmake him familiar with his master. The second and far more difficult\nstage is to teach him to control his movements, so as to adapt them\nto responsive expressions. This appears to be a step which some of\nthe animals find great difficulty in taking. Assuming that the horses\nhave a conception of number, as the investigators are inclined to think,\nafter some rather striking performances which they witnessed, this is\ndeveloped, at this stage of their education, in the form of movement-\nimages. The groom, who assists during this stage, takes the horse's\nright hoof and beats with it upon the stamping-board, while Herr\nKrall counts aloud. Gradually the horse, gaining control and under-\nstanding what he is to do, stamps on his own account.\nWith the help of a simplified spelling table the horses learnt to\nspell, each letter being represented by a number. The association\nbetween each letter and a certain number being once formed, the\nspelling of words written on the blackboard was merely a matter\nof memory. Something far more complicated, but at present inex-\nplicable was achieved, when the horses began to spell out spontaneous\nstatements. After many fruitless attempts to teach the horses the\ncomplicated German orthography, Herr Krall finally left them to their\nown devices, which produced a very erratic but sometimes ingeniously\nphonetic spelling, e.g. sn for essen, gn for gehen, etc.\nIn the course of time, encouraged by the success he met with in\nMuhamed and Zarif, Herr Krall attempted the education of other horses.\nThe most important of these was the blind Berto, a Mecklenburg\nstallion of a charger type. His blindness was of special importance\nto Herr Krall in view of the visual-sign theory. Tactile impressions\nhad to take the place of visual percepts in establishing the necessary\nassociations. The work of this horse is limited to elementary arithmetic;\nhe reacts to spoken problems, but will also answer simple questions\nwritten on his flank. It was mostly with Berto that the investigators\nworked during their stay at Elberfeld.\nDR. WOOLLEY, after expressing his gratitude to Mr. Krall for the\nfreedom allowed to him and to Mr. Bullough in their experiments,\noutlined the four possible explanations which the investigators had\nto test. These were :\n(1) The horses might really possess the\nintellectual abilities ascribed to them by their owner. (2) They might\nby this time have learnt by heart the answers to all the problems\n\f,ii iv, r.n:i. Private Meeting for M'embers a\/< -. 101\nwhich could be presented to them. (3) They might respond to signals\ngiven consciously or unconsciously by some person present. (4) They\nmight respond to some supernormal influence exerted by some such\nperson.\nHe regretted that they were unable to give any definite solution\nof the problem, and could only point out the difficulties in the way\nof each of these possibilities.\nTheir experiments, which were carried out at Elberfeld early in\nApril, 1913, were greatly hindered by the fact that in the spring\nthe horses become obstinate and intractable. At that time Mr. Krall\nhimself was unable to obtain any results from his Arab, Zarif, and\nsaid that his other horses, especially Muhamed, were very difficult\nto work with. In consequence, the experiments described were carried\nout almost entirely with the horse, Berto. This animal is completely\nblind, and the results obtained when the questions were spoken aloud\nwere very good. If, therefore, the horse does respond to any signals,\nthese must be auditory, and not visual, in character, and as there is\nno appreciable difference between the behaviour of this horse and that\nof the others, it is very improbable that Pfungst's theory of unconscious\nhead movements is adequate to explain the phenomena.\nThe blind horse, however, is also able to count numbers which are\nwritten with the finger on his flank. Dr. Woolley and Mr. Bullough\nmade use of this faculty to investigate the possibility of signals or tele-\npathic impressions being conveyed to the horse from one of themselves.\nIn the first instance, each of them wrote on the horse's off side one digit\nof a number of two digits, neither knowing the number written by the\nother. (The groom, who is obliged to be present with this horse, was\non the near side and could not see what was written.) If either of\nthem was giving signals to the horse the numbers known to him should\nbe rendered more correctly than the others. No such difference was\nfound to occur, and they next proceeded to write in the same way two\nnumbers which were to be added together. The object aimed at was\nto give the horse a problem which was unknown to any one present,\neach of the experimenters contributing one digit which was unknown\nto the other. The results were rather poor: out of 19 such problems\nthe horse gave the correct result at the first attempt in only three\ncases, at the second attempt in one, and at the third attempt in two\ncases, but it was not at all certain that the horse understood clearly\nwhat was wanted. That there was probably some confusion was\nevidenced by the fact that in four out of the first eight such problems\nthe horse began by giving the number last written, a fact which seems\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1913.\nopposed to any theory of either signals or telepathy, since such a\nnumber could not possibly be the correct answer to the problem.\nThe faculties of the other horses were then considered, though,\nowing to the unfavourable time of year, the investigators had had\nno opportunity of seeing them at their best. They had seen no\ninstances of the horses' alleged faculty of spelling out spontaneous\nstatements or words. They had seen Muhamed answer correctly to\nwritten problems, including the extraction of fourth roots of large\nnumbers, but these performances were open to the criticism that all\nthe numbers so given were perfect fourth powers, and the horse might\nby that time have learnt by heart all the problems which were ever\nset. With this horse, however, and with the Shetland pony, Hans-\nchen, they received correct answers to simple arithmetical problems\nwhen no person beside themselves was present, and when the grooms\nwere apparently engaged elsewhere with the other horses. They very\nmuch regretted that it had not been possible to propound to these\nhorses problems which were unknown to any person present. In\nthe case of Hanschen there was no satisfactory method of doing this,\nand Muhamed was too intractable for any but the most familiar\nexperiments. Since, however, it was quite impossible to exclude the\npossibility of unconscious auditory signals, which could be perceived\nby an animal so sensitive as the horse, it was evident that only such\nproblems could be regarded as constituting a satisfactory test. They\nhoped to visit Elberfeld again in the autumn when the condition of\nthe horses might make possible a more definite conclusion.\nDr. Woolley concluded by summarizing his and Mr. Bullough's\npresent opinions as follows :\n(1) Mr. Krall and the grooms are entirely\nhonest in all their experiments and tests, and are anxious only to\nestablish the truth. (2) In the experiments they saw, the possibility\nof unconscious signals was not entirely excluded, but if there were such\nsignals, they were probably auditory and not visual. (3) The horses'\nmovements appeared to be too quick and definite to be dependent\non signals, and nothing of the sort could be detected by observation.\nKEPOET ON A CASE OF TELEPATHY.\nBY SIR OLIVER LODGE.\n[The following is a preliminary report by Sir Oliver Lodge\nof a case of experimental telepathy. We hope to obtain\n\fJULY, 1913. Report on a Case of Telepathy. 103\npermission to carry out further experiments with the same\nsubject and to report on them later. ED.]\nMay 23rd, 1913.\nI WENT last Saturday to see a child who was said to have\ni'aculties which might be classified both as telepathic and\nclairvoyant. I had had reports on the case from a friend of\nMr. J. Arthur Hill of Bradford, Mr. Percy Lund, who had\nbeen good enough to make a special journey to the place for\nthe purpose, and whose report was quite favourable, at least\nas regards telepathy. What I wanted to make sure of was\nthe faculty of clairvoyance, as distinct from or as an extension\nof telepathy, but in that I have not been successful. At the\nsame time, certain things are described by the child's father\nwhich make me think that the perception of objects unknown\nto any one does occur, though of course it requires most careful\nverification.\nI went by invitation of the father, who originally com-\nmunicated with me and sent me preliminary information.\nThe child is a girl of, I should have guessed, about ten,\nbut she told me she was thirteen. She goes to some Dame\nSchool in the neighbourhood, and is undeveloped for her age.\nShe seemed quite willing to try, and anxious to succeed ;\nrather nervous, naturally, at first, especially as the father,\nin his desire that my time should not be wasted, was\nanxious too; so that I felt that the conditions became\nmore satisfactory when he went away into another room.\nAt first, however, and unless otherwise reported, he was\npresent, and every now and then he tried a few experi-\nments himself with his own pack of cards. I may say at\nonce that I saw no reason to mistrust that pack, or to\nassume that there was anything but absolute genuineness\nin the whole case. Once at a later stage, when selecting a\ncard, I myself purposely drew it out carelessly so as to\nexpose it for a moment. The child didn't happen to be\nlooking. The father noticed it, and called my attention to\nthe fact, and said what he thought the card was. It was\nnot quite right, but nearly so. The child said she hadn't\nseen it, which I was convinced was true, but my record\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1913.\nshows that she guessed it correctly :\nthough of course this i&\nnot an experiment that\n\"\ncounts.\"\nThe father took no elaborate precautions about his pack,\nand evidently made his own tests in his usual way,\nthe pack being held up in his hand with one card turned\nface towards himself, or occasionally a single card held out :\nno particular system, nor any special precautions ;\nthe child\nsometimes looking at him attentively, but usually glancing\nabout anywhere. Sometimes she was successful instantaneously,\nas quickly as the Zancigs, for instance ;\nat other times she\nmade two shots, sometimes more, and seemed to wish to go-\non until she got it right, which she did usually, though by\nno means always. After several guesses I generally stopped\nher, either by showing her the card, or by discarding it unseen.\nI had taken with me my own pack of cards and a box of\ncardboard letters. I began by trying a set of seven letters\ntaken out of the box at random, and placed face downwards\non my paper-case, so that I had seen none of them. I asked\nthe .child to guess the letters, and she said slowly :\nS, A, R, T, B, U, G.\nI then turned them up, and found that they really were\nE, L, M, H, S, Q, N.\nThe child said, \"There's one right\"; but of course the failure\nwas complete.\nI then took six letters out of the box, and glanced at them\nas I put them down. She now said :\nF, B, C, E, O, P.\nThey really were\nF, P, S, J. G, Z.\nSo in this case two were right, and one right as regards\nposition. Again, however, a failure, though really above chance.\nI then took single letters out of the box, and held them in\nmy hands, so that I could see them, but she certainly couldn't.\nThe first letter was E, and she said R.\nThe next was N, .and she said, \"Is it G ?\n\"\nI said \"No\";\nand she said,\n\"\nIt's an N.\"\nI then took another R, which she first called an H, and\nthen an R.\nNext a Q, to which she first said F, and then Q.\n\f.ii IA, 1913. Report on a Case of Telepathy. 105\nI next tried some cards from my pack. .\nThe father and I\ncould both see what the card was ;\nthe child could not. Her\nreplies were usually quite quick, that is, after a few seconds,\nsometimes perhaps as many as ten, which would be an extreme\ncase ;\nbut I didn't time her, because I was otherwise engaged\nin watching both father and child. The cards actually seen\nby us are recorded in the first column ;\nher answers are\nrecorded in the second column. When more than one guess\nwas made, she often prefixed her first guess with \"Is it?\" to\nwhich either we said\n\"\nNo,\n5\n'\nor shook our heads.\nActual Card. Card Guessed.\nSix of Diamonds.

She didn't do it.\nThe father now took up his own pack of cards, and began\ndealing with them as explained above.\nIt appears that he had returned home that afternoon from\nhis week's work in -\n,\nwhere he is a clerk of the works\nat some building being erected in , and had spent a\nlittle time early in the afternoon testing the child in pre-\nration for my visit, finding her remarkably successful, and\nable to guess cards with great rapidity, even before he or\nny one had seen them. An aunt on a visit (a primary\nschoolmistress at , B.A.Lond.), whom I met afterwards\nt tea, confirmed this, adding that she had previously been\nsceptical. I did not gather that any record was kept.\nHe now began to repeat the sort of thing he was accus-\ntomed to do, in order to let me see it. The girl was sometimes\nstanding, sometimes sitting, in front of her father, who was\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1913.\nsitting on a sofa. The test, as I have said above, was a\ngenuine one, though not conducted with scrupulous care. No\nattempt was made to bandage the eyes of the child, nor to\ninterfere with her liberty of movement, which consisted chiefly\nin fidgeting. He did not seem to consider the series very\ngood.\nThe following is the record of this series of tests made\nwhile I was present. (As before, the card was held so that\nwe could both see it, but the child couldn't.)

No one else could see it.\nThe first card was unseen. She guessed a Five, a Five of\n'Clubs. On looking, I found it was the Five of Diamonds.\nThe next card I saw. She guessed a Two, a Four, a Four\nof Hearts. It was the Four of Hearts.\nThe next card was intended to be unseen, but I caught a\nglimpse of it, probably seeing no more than that it was nearly\nbare. She guessed the Ace of Hearts, and it was.\nThe next card was also seen, being the King of Diamonds.\n-She guessed an Eight; a King; of Spades; of Hearts. I then\n\fJULY, r.i:<.\nReport on a Case of Telepat\/<>\/. 107\nstopped her and said,\n\"\nIt's now only guessing\n\"\n;\nbecause I had\nadmitted that it was a King.\nThe next card I purposely drew carelessly, and this was\nwhen the father said he had half seen it. It was the Ten of\nClubs. He said he thought it was a black Eight. The child\nsaid she hadn't seen it, but guessed the Ten of Clubs. Of\n-course it was no safe test, but was done with another object,\nwhich was satisfactory.\nThe next card I saw, being the Ten of Diamonds, and she\nguessed it at once.\n(It must be understood that in this series of tests, unless\notherwise stated, I alone was looking at the cards not the\nfather, who was sitting on the sofa, with the child by his side.)\nThe next card was unseen. She guessed Ace of Diamonds.\nIt was the Two of Clubs.\nThe next, also unseen, she guessed Three of Diamonds. It\nwas Four of Spades.\nI didn't tell her that these were wrong, and I went on\ntrying my pack of cards in another way, at first simply cutting\nthe pack and pointing to the top card without turning it up\nor knowing what it was until she had made a guess. She\nsaid,\n\"\nTwo of Hearts\n\"\n; also,\n\"\nIt's a red card.\" I then looked,\nand said\n\"\nNo,\" leaving it, however, still in position. She\nguessed successively Four of Spades, Two of Spades, Two of\nHearts. I then showed it to the father, the child being not\nthen near him, and she immediately said\n\"\nThree of Spades,\"\nwhich it was.\nI then drew cards from my pack and looked at them\nmomentarily, afterwards putting them face down for her to\nguess. The first was the Knave of Clubs. Her guesses\nwere :\n\"\nFace card\n\"\n;\n\"\nJack of ... red, I think\n\"\n;\n\"\nJack of\nClubs.\"\nThe next was the Ten of Clubs. She said,\n\"\nIs it a face\ncard?\" I said \"No.\" She said, \"Six.\" I told her it was\nwrong, and went on to the next, which was the Nine of Clubs;\nand again she failed, making several wrong guesses.\nThe next was the Ten of Hearts, and her guesses were :\nEight ;\nFace card ;\nSeven ;\nHeart ;\nTen.\nThe father suggested trying a drawing of a geometrical figure.\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1913,\nI drew a square with the diagonals, and said,\n\"\nIt is a figure.\"\nHer guess was 57. She evidently had not heard the kind of\nthing we had arranged, though no precautions were taken about\nit. The father then told her it was a simple drawing, on which\nshe said, \"A star\/' and then, \"A square.\" I then said, \"Perhaps\nyou would like to try a figure of the sort you expected. Here\nis a number of two figures.\" By that time I had drawn 68\non a piece of paper, which we both looked at. Her guesses\nwere: 22, 97, 7, 10.\nThe father began to be discouraged, and to fidget at her\nlack of success ;\nfor though it had been on the whole above\nchance, it was obviously not satisfactory. So I asked him to\ngo away, which he did ;\nwhile I talked to the child about her\nschool, and some picture-books, and such like, till I thought\nshe was rested.\nThen I took my pack of cards, drawing one from the middle,\nand holding it low down against my body without looking at\nit. She didn't make a guess, so I looked at it, that is, gave a\nglance at it for a moment, keeping iny hand well over it all\nthe time, practically hiding even the back of the card, only\nthe top edge being visible, that she might see a card was there.\nShe said, \"Queen of Hearts,\" which was right.\nI was wearing no glasses, and the method adopted put any\npossible reflexion from the cornea out of court.\nI drew another unseen card, my object in drawing them thus\nbeing not to give her a suggestion that I didn't know them,\nbut to let her have a fair chance at them, not telling her\nwhether I knew them or not. I could at any time see them\nif I wanted to, by tilting my hand very slightly and looking\ndown. The child from her position in front of me hadn't the\nremotest chance of seeing anything. It is not suggested that\nshe was unable to see whether I looked at the card or not ;\nbut I have no reason to suppose that she particularly noticed\neven that. She got a paper and pencil to keep a record of\nher guesses, her father having said something about a penny\na dozen if she got them right, while I hinted at a rather more\nliberal offer. This certainly seemed to have the effect of\nmaking it less boring to her.\nI held the unseen card, as said above, with my hand covering\n\f,IM,, mi;;.\nfteport on a Ctwe of Telepathy. 109\nit, against myself. She said,\n\"\nIs it a face card?\" and I had\nto take a glance at it in order to say\n\"\nNo.\" She then said,\n\"\nFive of Hearts.\" I again said\n\"\nNo.\" She said,\n\"\nAt any rate,\nit is a Heart.\" I said,\n\"\nYes.\" She said,\n\"\nA Nine ?\n\" \"\nNo.\"\n\"An Eight?\" \"Yes.\" It was the Eight of Hearts.\nAnother unseen card. She said,\n\"\nIs it an ace ?\n\"\nI looked\nand said\n\"\nNo.\n'\nShe immediately said,\n\"\nSeven of Hearts,\" which\nit was.\nTo the next unseen card she said,\n\"\nThree of Spades ?\n\"\nI\nlooked, and she said,\n\"\nSix of Hearts.\" Eight.\nAnother unseen card she guessed Four of Spades. I looked,\nand she said,\n\"\nFive of Hearts,\" which was right.\nIt is to be understood that the card was held low down\nnear my lap, with my hand over it ;\nthat they were all cards\nout of my pack ;\nthat the father was out of the room. And\nit was noteworthy that the clairvoyant attempts all failed ;\nthat until I knew what the card was, she rather stared about,\nseeming to have no clue. I too felt that she had none, and\nthat the experiment was rather hopeless in that form, though\nof course I didn't consciously give any indication of that feel-\ning.

Balfour has\na singularly suggestive article on \"\nTelepathy and Metaphysics.\"\nTaking \"telepathy\" in a psychical and positive sense, i.e. not as a\ndenial of ordinary communication through the senses, but as direct\napprehension of one mind's thought by another, he urges that cross-\ncorrespondences and mystical experiences afford evidence enough to\nwarrant giving up the assumption that individual minds are completely\ninsulated and impermeable to each other. The individual mind is\nto be conceived as\n\"\npolypsychic,\" and its \"true self\" as receiving\ndirect influences from subordinate streams of consciousness with which\nit interacts, and this interaction is essentially telepathic. Hence there\nmay be telepathy between embodied minds, between embodied and\ndisembodied, between disembodied, and between the conscious con-\nstituents attached to a single body. Telepathy is thus universal, but\nit appears to be exceptional, because most of it is\n\"\nintracorporeal,\" and\nmost minds are only attuned to respond to the messages of their\nimmediate associates in the same body. Also telepathic interaction\nbetween minds rarely takes the form of particular messages, because\nProceedings, Vol. L, pp. 263-283; Vol. II., pp. 24-42, 189-200;\nVol. III., pp. 424-452.\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1913.\nmost of it\nexpresses itself in the diffusion of general ideas, which is\nnot evidential. Mr. Balfour concludes that his theory points towards\npluralism and theism rather than towards monism and pantheism.\nThe Archives de Psychologie, No. 49 (April, 1913), contains an\nelaborate article on an interesting case of \"\nEmotional Epilepsy,\" by\nEL Flournoy. The patient, a woman of forty-six, was subject to fits,\napparently epileptic, in which she turned her head to the left, and\nlost consciousness, after recovering which she frequently complained of\na pain in her neck. She was hypnotised, and then revealed that her\nhusband often treated her brutally, caught her by the throat and\nbeat her, and that on such occasions she was wont to turn away\ntowards the left, as he was on her right. The first fit occurred\nafter seven years of this treatment, but the article concerns itself\nrather with the differences between this \"emotional\" epilepsy and\nthe normal disease than with the cure of the patient, and accord-\ningly hypnotic suggestions were made, not to stop the fits, but to\nprovoke them artificially. These attempts failed, but it is permissible\nto think that science would have profited quite as much if the\npatient had been cured by making therapeutic use of her hypnotic\nself-revelations.\nF. C. S. S.\nThe Revue de Psychothtrapie for February and March, 1913, contains\nan interesting paper by Dr. S. Artault on \"\nStigmata and Mimicry.\"\nAs the title implies, the author seeks to establish a parallelism between\nthe production of stigmata, now so frequently recorded in hysterical\nsubjects, and the capacity of certain animals to change themselves\nrapidly to a coloration identical with that of their environment. It\nis known that this ability depends on the visual perception of the\nenvironment, and apparently also, in some cases, of the animal's own\nbody. Dr. Artault describes two interesting cases of stigrnatism which\nhave come within his own experience, in one of which he was able to\nabort the stigma on the left foot by tying a stocking rather tightly\non this leg, while that on the right foot pursued its\n\" normal\n\"\ncourse\nand became a sero-sanguineous blister. This result would suggest\nthat the injuries were self-inflicted, a possibility which is not excluded\nby the evidence given.\nThe other case recorded is rather unusual, in that the subject was\nnot apparently of a particularly religious temperament, though he\nhad been brought up in an atmosphere of extreme religious devotion.\nIn his case the stigmata appeared only on the dorsal and palmar\nsurfaces of each hand, and only as the sequels to attacks of an\nillness resembling tonsillitis. If these are to be regarded as genuine\nstigmata, related to ideas about crucifixion, it is noteworthy that these\nideas must have been quite subconscious, as it is recorded that the\npatient\n\"\nattached no mystical or symbolical idea to the occurrence.\"\nV.

OCT., 1913.\nCASES.\nHallucination.\nTHE following account of a recurrent hallucination was sent\nto Mr. Piddington by Mrs. Peake, to whom the percipient,\nMiss Olive M. Cruse, verbally related her experience a day or\ntwo after its occurrence. Mrs. Peake, in enclosing the account,\nwrites :\nJan. 13th, 1913.\nMiss Cruse told me of the occurrence as soon as it happened,\nand her account was so well observed that I asked her to write it\nout, which she did as soon as she had time. She is nineteen years\nold, a healthy and athletic girl, one of the best of my village\nmasque dancers ;\nand she has also been trained as a Morris dancer\nunder the Esperance Club. I have known her from a child, and\nshe is most truthful and level-headed. ... So far I can get no\nrumours or legends about the house where her father, a retired\nwheelwright, has lived for many years.\nC. M. A. PEAKE.\nMiss Cruse's account (from which we omit the address, by\nher request) is as follows :\nOn Friday evening, November 15th, 1912, I retired to bed as\nusual about 9 o'clock. I took a reading lamp upstairs and placed\nit on the dressing-table, which is under the window and fairly close\nto my bed. When ready, I got into bed and put the light out.\nBeing rather tired, I soon fell asleep, but awoke, as near as I can\njudge, in the middle of the night or the very early hours of the\nmorning. I had no clock in the room, so am not positive of the\ntime. I turned my head towards the window, when my eyes were\nattracted to a white figure hovering near the dressing-table. The\nfigure was in the form of a baby, and was clothed from head to\nfoot in a white robe which fitted rather closely. The robe appeared\nto be in one piece, part of which fitted closely round the head and\nformed a hood. No arms were visible, so the robe went straight\ndown. I saw no feet, but I had a feeling at the time that the robe\njust covered them. As near as I can tell, the figure was about\neighteen inches high. It seemed to me that some invisible hand\nwas holding it at the back, which caused it to bend slightly forward.\nAlthough appearing so suddenly, I felt too fascinated to be frightened,\n\fOCT., 1913. Cases. 115\nand gazed at it until it\ndisappeared. I tried to sleep, but that was\nimpossible. Whether through curiosity or not (I cannot tell), but\nI felt compelled to look up, and there was the figure in exactly\nthe same spot as before. I must confess I felt a little uncomfortable,\nbut far from frightened. It was at this second appearance I noticed\nit turn to the window and bow. It disappeared, but came again\nthe third time. After the third disappearance I did not see it\nagain. I lay awake for a long time and then fell asleep. Needless\nto relate, I awoke next morning feeling rather tired after my disturbed\nnight's rest. I could in no way account for the figure, unless it was\nthe moon shining on the lamp's white globe, but the idea did not\nappeal to me. I did not say a word to any one until the following\nSunday, when I mentioned quite casually to my friends that I had\na ghost, but they declared it was the moon, so I let the\nbject drop. Nothing happened Saturday or Sunday night, but on\nonday night the figure appeared again. I will relate it as well\nas I can. I went to bed at the usual time, but did not take the\nlamp. As before, I soon fell asleep, but awoke in the early hours\nof the morning. I stretched my legs, but was seized with cramp\nin the left leg just above the knee. The pain was so bad that I\ngot out of bed and put my foot on a cold rush mat. The cramp\ndisappeared directly. (I have mentioned this to show that what\nfollowed was no dream.) I got into bed again and had settled down\ncomfortably when, glancing up, I saw the figure again. It was the\nsame figure, same clothing, etc., and was in exactly the same place\nas I saw it on the previous Friday. I was positive now that it\nwas not caused by the moon shining on the lamp, for, as I have\nalready mentioned, I had not taken the lamp upstairs. I cannot\nsay how long the figure remained, but it seemed a long time to me.\nIt disappeared, but not very suddenly, for it seemed to float through\nthe air and then disappear. Guessing from my former experience\nt it would return, I watched and I had not long to wait. Now\nmes the strange part. Instead of remaining in the same place as\nbefore, it floated to the window and hovered near the white blinds.\nIt would then return to its former place. I asked in a loud whisper,\n\" In the name of the Lord what troublest thee\n\"\n? but much to my\ndisappointment received no answer. The floating was repeated again\nand again. Perhaps I was silly, but at last I got so uneasy that\nwhen the figure was near the window I reached across to the\ndressing-table and got candle and matches. Of course with a light\nthe figure entirely vanished. Sleep had gone from me, so having\ntha\ncon\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1913.\na book handy I did some reading. I read two or three pages and\nthen lay quiet trying to fathom the mystery, but no explanation\npresented itself. At last I fell asleep, but awoke next morning with\na vivid recollection of all that had passed. Had I wanted to think\nthe whole affair a dream I could not, for when I awoke the candle\nwas still burning, the book beside me, and my head on the bolster.\nI may add that I am accustomed to lie flat in bed and seldom use\npillow or bolster. I may mention two or three points, as regards\nthe figure, which I have omitted. 1st. The features were such\nthat I cannot find words to explain them, though in my mind I\nseem to have a vague idea of the same. 2nd. It is interesting to\nnote that when the figure was present the robe was so white and\nseemed to shine so much in the darkness that the white blinds\nappeared quite dark, though they resumed their ordinary whiteness\nwhen the figure disappeared. Perhaps at some future date I shall\nreceive an explanation of my midnight visitor, if indeed there is\nan explanation at all.\nOLIVE MARY CRUSE.\nThe above account is not dated, but in reply to an enquiry,\nMiss Cruse states that it was written on ISTov. 21, 1912.\nMr. Piddington, on receiving it, addressed the following\nquestions to Miss Cruse :\n1. Have you ever before had any experience of a similar kind.\nIf you have, please give details.\n2. How was the figure visible to you ? That is to say, was there\nnaturally enough light in your room to see objects by? or did the\nfigure appear to be self-illuminated and other objects to be dark\n1\n?\n3. Can you remember when you first told Mrs. Peake about your\nvision ?\n4. Has any other member of your family or any one else who\nmay be living or who may have stayed in your house seen a\nsimilar vision ?\n5. Do you often suffer from cramp, or was the seizure you\nmention exceptional?\n6. Can you explain further what you say about the features'?\nYou say though you can't explain them you seem to have a vague\nidea of them. Do you mean that you thought you recognised the\nchild's features as those of a child you know or have known?\n7. Have you since your statement was written seen the figure\nagain 1 If so, please give details.\n\fOCT., 1913. Cases. 117\n8. Have you been at all out of health shortly before or since the\nfigure appeared to you? By \"out of health\" I mean anything\nfrom a definite illness to an occasional headache. Were you over-\ntired or overworked at the time?\n9. Had you, before the first vision happened, been hearing, read-\ning, talking, or thinking of apparitions or ghosts?\n10. Do you \"visualize\" easily? That is to say, when you\nthink of a thing do you see it clearly, either in your mind's eye\nor externally? For instance, if some one were speaking to you, or\nif you were thinking, of a bunch of roses or a tea-pot, would you\nsee the roses or the tea-pot in your mind's eye or, say, upon the\nwall ?\n11. Did you notice whether any part of the vision was coloured ?\nYou speak of the extreme whiteness of the robe, but did you\njrve any colour, blue, pink, green, and so on ?\nMiss Cruse replied on Jan. 25th, 1913, as follows:\n1. I have never seen anything of a similar kind before.\n2. The figure was certainly self-illuminated. Only by getting\nloroughly accustomed to the darkness could other objects in the\n>om be seen. I could see the white blinds but very faintly.\n3. I told Mrs. Peake about the vision on the 20th of November,\n.912. It was the Wednesday following the two days (Friday and\n[onday) when the vision was seen.\n4. To my knowledge no person living or staying in the house\nseen any vision or anything of its kind before.\n5. I do not suffer from cramp. Now and again I get a very\nlight touch of it, but not nearly so painful as it was on that\n>ecial night.\n6. The features did not resemble, or even bear a likeness to,\nany child I have met. I cannot explain them properly. The\nlearest explanation I can give is that it was like the thin pinched\nof a wooden Dutch doll.\n7. I have never seen the vision since writing the account. As a\nlatter of fact, I have changed my room, and though the room is\noccupied I have not heard any sound or word mentioned about the\nnew occupant seeing the vision.\n8. I was certainly not overworked or overtired at the time. I\nwas having rather an easy time at home. I had spent the summer\nin London, and returned home at the end of August, so was having\na long holiday and rest before commencing work again. I do not\nremember any illness of any description at that time.\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1913.\n9. To my knowledge no mention of ghosts, etc., had been made\nin any of my conversations, neither had I read, talked, or thought\nabout such things.\n10. I think I visualize fairly easily. If objects are mentioned, I\nsee them in my mind's eye rather quickly.\n11. No no other part of the vision was coloured.\nSubsequently Miss Cruse sent a sketch of her room, which\nhas a small, high casement window with three leaded lights ;\nthe high sill is parallel with the top of the looking-glass on\nthe dressing-table, and the head of the figure (which was in\nfront of and a little above the table) was on the same level.\nOn both the nights when the apparition was seen the window\nwas closed, and plain white calico curtains were drawn across\nit. There was no blind. Outside, to the left, is a tree, an\nelm (pollard), of which Miss Cruse writes :\n\"\nThere are no thick\nbranches. Only a few slender twigs stretch as far as the\nmiddle division of my window, and these are about four feet\ndistant from the sill.\" Moreover it is very improbable that the\neffect seen by Miss Cruse could have been produced by the\nmoon shining through the branches, because the moon, which\nreached its first quarter on November 16th, 1912, set at 9.23\np.m. on November 15th, 1912, and just after midnight on\nNovember 19th, 1912.\nA CASE OF TELEPATHIC HALLUCINATION.\nBY DR. EMIL MATTIESEN.\nL. 1197.\nTHE following account of a vision containing veridical details\nwas given to me orally on Monday, May 5th, 1913, by Mr.\nJoseph Zohrer, a shoemaker, living and keeping a shop at\n46 Warschauer Str., Berlin, 0., and written down by me\nfrom his dictation. In translating it into English four hours\nlater, I have altered nothing except introducing a few gram-\nmatical changes, transposing one or two sentences, and adding,\nin square brackets, a few explanatory notes, based on personal\nknowledge. I feel absolute assurance with regard to Mr.\nZohrer's personal veracity and endeavour to keep as close as\npossible to facts. As to the question, how far his recollection\nof minute details be correct, it will be seen hardly to touch\nthe evidential value of the case.\n\fOCT., 1913. Cases. 119\nMr. Zohrer's account ran as follows:\n\" I have a sister, [Mrs. Agnes Sommer,] living in [Eggenberg near]\nGraz, Styria, who is there carrying on a prospering retail trade in\nvictuals. Before last spring three quarters of a year had passed\nwithout any letters being exchanged between us, and I had no\nreason whatever to suspect her to be straitened for money. On\nMarch 16th, 1912, when I was awakened at 7 a.m. by the crying\nof my child, I called out to my wife in the kitchen to come in and\nquieten the boy. Being wide awake, I was much astonished when,\nlooking at the door, [right at the foot of the bed, the kitchen-door\nbeing in the same direction across a passage,] I half heard and saw\nit\nopen and perceived a man entering in the spirit [sic], fair-haired,\nlooking about 28 years of age, in Sunday dress, but with no coat\non, without hat, wearing a white shirt with knitted sleeves, his hair\n:hed high. He was accompanied by three dark figures. And the\ntir-haired one came to me and told me to prepare for a highly\n)iritual visitor. Then one of the dark figures came to me and\nsked me to tell him what it was that was coming, for which the\ndr-haired one had prepared me. Then I looked at the clock [which\nmngs above the foot of the bed] which I did several times during\nwhat succeeded and saw that 3 minutes had passed [since 7 a.m.].\nfurious as to what might be coming I was musing to myself when,\nsuddenly, the ceiling seemed to open above me and there appeared\na female being, looking like an angel, and about 18 years old, in a\ngreat clarity, dressed in a garment with folds, girdled and hanging\ndown, and shining in changing hues, like a crystal. The beauty of\nthis being was such, that I felt enraptured. She spoke to me at\nsome length about my sister, telling me to help her, and other\nthings which I noticed, but could not remember, owing to my sur-\nprise and rapture, and after a long talk the figure vanished. While\nwas greatly regretting that I could not remember it all, the fair-\nlaired one approached me again and told me to prepare once more\nfor another such apparition. When at that moment I again looked\nit the clock, it showed 6 minutes past 7, and I was still meditating\nrhat might be in store for me, when I again observed the same\nling coming from the ceiling. It was a figure similar to the first\none, but apparently older, about 24 years of age, which repeated\nthe whole of the previous account, telling me : that my sister was\nneed, and had prayed God fervently for help; [this may be an\ninterpolation see note at end,] that it was my duty to help her,\nfor she had done good to me more than once; that my sister's\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1913.\ndaughter was going to be confirmed and great joy prevailed on that\naccount. And a voice came, I don't know whence, telling me to\nsend 60 Kronen [Austrian crowns; about 2 10s.]. Then the\nfigure took leave in greatest love. When I looked after her, I was\nable to see through two doors, and saw her walking into the kitchen,\nwhere my wife was standing at the fire, and then she disappeared.\nThen I saw the fair-haired young man leaving, and he, too, walked\nthrough two doors and I could see through them. My two journey-\nmen, who live in the back-room, were just drinking their coffee, and\nI could see it. Then this spiritual being busied himself with one of\nthe journeymen, and disappeared, and when I looked around, the\nother figures too had vanished, without saying anything. I got up\nand told my wife what had happened very minutely, and told her\nthat 60 Kr. must be sent off at once, as my sister was in very great\nneed ;\nand that this was going to be confirmed, though she [Mrs.\nZohrer] thought it incredible. I did not find time that day to send\noff the money, and the next day [see, however, note at end of\ncase] I\n\" heard\n\"\na monition, to despatch it at once. Then my\nwife went to the Post-Office and sent off 60 Kr.\nAfter some days the reply came on a post-card, which exactly\nconfirmed everything: \"Dear Brother, The money you sent me, was\na great divine miracle. I was in great need and have prayed God\nfervently for help. Then I was told that help would come, where-\nupon I thanked God. But of you I had no thought.\"\nWhen I travelled to Graz, shortly before Easter, 1913, and came\nto talk about this money-sending business [with my sister],\nstill\nfurther confirmation was obtained.\n[What follows agrees in all essentials with Mrs. Sommer's account (see\nbelow) and is therefoi'e omitted here.]\nMr. Zohrer, after finishing his tale, showed me the postal\nreceipt for the money sent (money being transmitted in Germany\nnot by P.O., but by being paid in cash at the Post-Office, a\nreceipt being handed to the sender). The usual formulary in\nred print was filled up with ink as follows :\n[Sum :]\n5 1 M[arks]\n5 Pf[ennigs]\n= 6 Kr. [Addressee:] Agnes Sommer. [Destina-\ntion:] Graz, Steiermark. [Date:] 19, Marz, 1912.\nMrs. Zohrer, who impressed me as a most sensible woman,\nand quite without the\n\"\nspiritual exaltation\n\"\nof her husband,\norally confirmed to me his having told her of the vision imme-\ndiately after its occurrence. I have not thought it worth while\n\fOCT., 1913. Cases. 121\nto get her written statement, supposing her recollection of details\nto have been tinged in the meantime by talking the case over\nwith her husband. Her recollection of the main points, however,\nis quite clear.\nMr. Zohrer has been unable, in spite of repeated careful\nsearching, to find the post-card above-mentioned ;\nbut he gave\nme the names and addresses of three persons, who had, he said,\nseen and read it. To one of these people, Mrs. Pintsch, I did\nnot apply, because she lives in the same house with Mr. Z., and\nI supposed her recollection to have lost its independence through\ntalking the matter over with Mr. Z. The second, Mrs. Schon-\nbeck, wrote to me, on May 27th, that Mr. Z. had intended to\nshow her the card in question, but had not done so : that she\nknew, however, Mr. Z.\n\"\nas a person of the greatest trustworthi-\nness.\" The third, Mr. Zingelmann, living at some distance from\nMr. Zohrer, replied to my enquiry as follows :\nJune Is\/, 1913.\n... At that time, while Mr. Zohrer was under my treatment,\n1\nhe\ntold me too that he had seen an apparition (he is clairvoyant at times),\nwhich told him that his sister was in straitened circumstances and\nthat he ought to do his duty by her ;\nthat he had told his wife of it,\nwho asked him in reply to send the 60 Kr. [mentioned in the vision] to-\nhis sister, as he was now able to do it. This Mrs. Zohrer, too, told me\nat that time. About 8 days later Mr. Zohrer showed me a post-card\nwith a Bavarian [mistake for Austrian] stamp, bearing a correspond-\ning post-mark, and containing about what follows: \"Dear Brother,\nThat I would get money I knew, but from whom, I did not know ;\nof\nyou 1 should have thought least of all. I was straitened for money,\njust for this sum of 60 Kr., and have repeatedly addressed myself on\nmy knees to my Heavenly Father; the Lord has always heard my\nprayer, and so I knew that I would get money.\" This interested me\ngreatly, after the account I had received which was fully confirmed\nby the post-card. . . .\nBut apart from these corroborations, Mr. Zohrer gave me a\nletter from his sister, with the postmark of July 19th, 1912, in\nwhich the following occurs :\nDear Brother, Your letter [apparently a letter relating Mr. Zohrer's\npart in the affair] has caused me great joy. The whole thing was\n1\nMr. Zingelmann is a \"magnetic healer.\"\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1913.\nguided by God. I prayed for help on the 2nd day before March 19th\n[Mr. Zohrer's \"\nname-day \"].\nI [had] to pay a big account of GO Kr.\nI had no thought that you should give [it]\nme. But on the eve of\nyour name-day, under the starry sky, I prayed to the Father for bliss\nfor you and that you should be conscious of my having prayed, and\nfeel the bliss. . . .\n1 wrote, on the day of my interview with Mr. Zohrer, to his\nsister in Graz, asking for an account of her part in the case, and\nputting some questions likely to elicit some normal explanation\nof Mr. Zohrer's acquiring knowledge of her embarrassment. Her\nreply, dated, on the envelope, Graz, May 23rd, reached me on\nMay 25th, 1913. It is in very bad spelling and grammar\nthroughout (this is almost entirely lost in the translation), but\nreveals a person of an intensely religious cast of mind (including\na\n\"\nspiritualistic\n\"\nstrain), and inspires entire confidence in the\nbona fides of the writer. It reads as follows :\nBODENFELD SlRASSE, No. 20, EGGENBERG.\n. . . First of all I ask your pardon for not answering [your letter]\nsooner. ... In reply to your questions : I have not written to my brother\nJoseph in Berlin for about 9 or 12 months [before March 19th, 1912].\nMy need already existed since 1909. 1\nI was deep in debt in my\nbusiness, so that I had no more credit anywhere; thus, if I did not\npay an account within 30 days I should get nothing more. Already\nin 1910 I fervently prayed my God for help, when it was [officially]\nintended to close my shop. I needed a 1000 Kr. . . .\n2\nAnd two\nyears later [i.e.\nin 1912], I was in need again. And thus it happened\nthat I prayed again, about March 18th. I cannot exactly remember\nthe date, it may be March 17th or 18th. A female customer came\ninto [my] shop for wheat-flour; I had none; as I owed 63 Kr., I could\nnot procure any before paying that [debt]. When the customer had\nX\nI had asked Mrs. Sommer how long, before March, 1912, her embarrassment\nhad been in existence, considering, in my mind, the possibility of her brother\nbeing normally aware of her chronic need. Mrs. Sommer appears not to have\nguessed my suspicion. She seems to refer to certain special cases of acute\nwant, and it remains possible to think that her brother supposed her business\nto be prospering on the whole, as, indeed, he expressed himself in his account.\nIn view of the exact agreement between the sum needed and the sum despatched,\nthe question of chance may thus seem to be eliminated. Note by Dr. Mattiesen.\n2\nHere and in a subsequent letter Mrs. Sommer relates how she obtained 1000\nKronen from an uncle. At his particular request she did not mention his giving\nher the money to any other members of the family.\n\fi:is. Cases. 123\nleft the shop, a strong thought, or a low voice, came to me :\n\" Go\nto the Father.\" I ran into my bedroom, knelt down and prayed\nfrom my heart. . . . And it came to me like an audible thought or a\nlow mild voice :\n\"My child, all your cares I have taken upon myself;\nyou will get 60 Kr.\" . . .\nI went from my bedroom into the shop again ;\none Mrs. Maria Holz-\nmeier came and complained that she had nothing wherewith to prepare\na meal for her five children. I said :\n\"\n. . . Just listen ;\nI asked my\nFather for 60 Kr. He has already promised [them] to me, and within\ntwo days I shall get them from Him.\" And two days after that in\nthe morning the money-letter-carrier, Mr. Unger, came. When he\nopened the door, I called out to him :\n\"\nWell, Mr. Unger, here you\nare with my 60 Kr.\" He said :\n\" How do you know from where you\nare getting 60 Kr. 1\n\"\nI said :\n\"\nFrom my Heavenly Father.\" He said :\n41\nHave you your Heavenly Father in Berlin ?\n\"\nHe handed me 60 Kr.\nAnd at that time, when the postman came, Mrs. Holzmeier . . . was\npresent again, as well as Mrs. Lutteri. ... I [had] never complained\n[of my need] to my brother in Berlin, nor to my other relations. . . .\nAnd it was on March 18th, 1912, when I thought: I shall write to\nmy poor brother for his name-day [this taking in Austria the place\nof the birth-day]. All day I found no time to write more than half\na letter, and that, too, I lost in the evening.\n[There follows an account of how Frau Sommer prayed that her\nbrother might \"feel the bliss\" (see above, p. 122).]\nYours most respectfully,\nAGNES SOMMER.\nMrs. Lutteri, when applied to, wrote as follows from Graz\non May 29th:\nIn compliance with your wish I write down for you what I\nremember in connection with Mrs. Sommer. Yes, I was present\nwhen the money-letter-carrier called. Mrs. Sommer had just been\ntelling me with sighs that she wanted money, viz. 64 Kr., for an\nurgent payment, but, as she added, \"I have prayed to the Father\nand He is going to help me,\" meaning by Father, of course, God.\nShe was very joyfully surprised when the money came, and said it\nwas money she had no longer counted on and hoped for. 1\nWhat\nshe said to the postman I no longer recollect verbatim, but it\nprob-\nably was in the same sense, and she was glad and thankful like a\nchild. The whole thing I took for an answer to a prayer. I have\n1\nThis seems to be a mistake. Note by Dr. Alattiesen.\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1913.\nnot seen Mrs. Sommer for a long time, since she moved away from\nhere [to Eggenberg, near Graz]. . . .\nI wrote to Mrs. Holzmeier, too, and received the following\nreply, dated Graz, June 4th, 1913 :\nYes, I can swear that the thing . . .\nhappened thus : Mrs. Sommer\nwas in great pecuniary embarrassment, having given too much credit\nin her business, and so she had been intending for a long while to\nwrite to her brother and to ask him for money. But being always\ndiverted by her business or some events in her family, she did not\ndo it, and the day after [sic]\nshe had got to have the money. And\nit was a beautiful moonlit night when she accompanied me and prayed\nunder the sky that the Father might hear her, and with great con-\nfidence she then told [me] : \"You will see, to-morrow I get the money\nI want.\" Next day, in the forenoon, I again went into Mrs. Sommer's\nshop. When the postman had come, Mrs. Sommer said :\n\" You're\nalready bringing me my money.\" Whereupon the postman said :\n\"\nSo you know it\nalready ? . . .\" Then only Mrs. Sommer wrote to her\nbrother about her embarrassment and the hearing of her prayer, and\nher brother was not a little astonished and described to her his\nexperience. ... I can assure you that I have not seen Mrs. Sommer\nfor a long time, and that the occurrence is very fresh in my\nmemory. . . .\nMr. Zohrer having told me that Mrs. Holzmeier is unable\nto write (which, perhaps, in Austria does not quite mean what\nit would mean in England), this letter, I suppose, has been\ndictated by her. As it is, it is in poor grammar, but correctly\nspelt. Whether certain errors of fact which it contains are\ndue to its coming through the hand of a third person, I\ncannot tell. Excepting some irrelevant details, Mrs. Sommer's\nletter appears to be in fair accord with her brother's statement.\nThere seems, however, to remain some difficulty with regard to\ndates, if a \"\ntelepathic\n\"\nexplanation of the occurrence is, on\na priori grounds, assumed as the most likely one. In her\nearliest written account obtainable, i.e. her letter of July 19th,\n1912, Mrs. Sommer fixes her prayer for help on to \"the\nsecond day before March 19th.\" This latter date being St.\nJoseph's day, and thus the name-day of her brother, it ought\nto have formed an easy starting-point in her mind for fixing\nthe event in her recollection. For the same reason her second\n\fOCT., 1913. Cases. 125\nprayer (for a blessing on her brother) might be supposed to\nhave been correctly fixed by her on to \"the eve\" of the\nname-day, though a letter (or card) posted late on March 18th\ncould not have reached her brother on the next day, a fast\ntrain travelling at least twenty-four hours between Graz and\nBerlin. If, then, a\n\"\ntelepathic\n\"\nconnection between this prayer\n\"\nfor a blessing\n\"\nand Mr. Zohrer's rapturous vision be assumed,\nthe vision cannot have happened, as he first told me, on\nMarch 16th. On the other hand, if it happened, as Mrs.\nSommer seems to think, on the morning of March 19th, her\nbrother cannot have allowed a whole day or more to elapse\nbefore obeying the order (a fact much easier to remember than\nan abstract date), for this he did, on the showing of the postal\njceipt, on March 19th. If, then, his recollection of his original\nleglect of the order is thought to be correct, Mrs. Sommer's\nsecond prayer either loses any claim to a supernormal efficiency,\n>r else would have to be fixed on to March 17th (if not\n6th), i.e. the probable day of her first prayer, on which day,\nfor a priori reasons, she might well be supposed to have\nmtinued in an excited\n\"\nprayerful\n\"\nmood and a telepathic\nturgor,\" if I may say so. And it might be supposed to\njak in favour of this assumption that she must have known\nit the 17th was the day for her to write to her brother, if\nshe intended to reach him on his name-day. The construction\nput upon the foregoing accounts would, then, come to this :\nthat both prayers acted as telepathic stimuli on March\n17th, 1912, that they got translated into a sensual irn-\n>ression by Mr. Zohrer on his awakening early next morning,\nid that the money was despatched on the day after the\nvision.\nThere might, however, appear to be another way out of\nlese difficulties, if the\n\"\ntelepathic\n\"\nexplanation based on\nlese prayers a scheme too hastily, perhaps, adopted at times\nby adepts in Psychical Eesearch be withheld in favour of\n)me other hypothesis of a supernormal kind, whatever its\ndetails might be. As a matter of fact, Mr. Zohrer is not\ninclined at all to allow so large an error with regard to the\nite of the vision in his first statement, as the above explana-\ntion would ask us to suppose. On being told by me of the\niifficulties just explained, and asked once more to think the\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1913.\nmatter over carefully with his wife, he wrote to ine, on\nMay 30th, as follows:\n... As to the apparition, we can remember that I saw it on [a]\nFriday, and consequently on March 15th [March 15th, in 1912, was\na Friday]. The vision, then, happened a few days before my sister's\nprayer for help, and you think that my help cannot [then] be a\nconsequence of her prayer. But in my view the thing is very\nsimple, for God knows in advance, not for days or years, but for\neternity, what will happen to us people, and thus God has known a\nfew days in advance that my sister would get in need and that\nshe would ask for His help, and thereupon the matter was devised\nin advance. . . .\nReaders may not be inclined to go quite as far as Mr.\nZohrer here does, even if they drop the hypothesis, not only\nof the \"prayer\" acting causally in this case, but also which\nis another thing of Mrs. Sommer acting at all telepathically\non her brother.\n1\nYet the case is, to my mind, apt to make\nus feel how vague and, at the same time, how \"\ndogmatical\n\"\nour ideas become as soon as the boundary of what is known\nof normal means of communication between the living is over-\nstepped. For the rest, in estimating the non-evidential details\nof Mr. Zohrer's vision, it must be kept in view, not only that\nhe, obviously, is a very religious person (he is born a Catholic,\nthough not now attached to his Church and its priests) ;\nbut\nalso that, as he tells me, he sees\n\"\nfigures\n\"\nrather frequently,\nmostly dark and of a\n\"\nhellish\n\"\ncharacter half man and half\nbeast, more rarely of angels ;\nand that he calls himself a\n\"\nhearing\n\"\nmedium. His sister, too, he says, by the way, is a\n\"\nmedium,\" i.e. she\n\"\nsees\n\"\nand \"\nhears\n\"\nthings, and at times\nspeaks in a trance.\nREVIEW.\nThe Belief in Personal Immortality. By E. S. P. HAYNES. (Watts & Co.,\nLondon, 1913. 156 pp. Price 9d. net.)\nIT is not to a 9d. book written for the Rationalist Press Association\nthat one would naturally look for matters of interest to Psychical\nResearch. Nor, as a fact, is there much to be gleaned from the great\nbulk of Mr. Haynes' work, which is simply dialectical and scientifically\nunprofitable, being composed of very sketchy and not very accurate\n1\nEven if Mr. Zohrer's vision preceded Mrs. Sommer's prayer, it did not\nprecede her anxiety and desire for money, and we may still suppose, therefore,\nthat the vision was due to a telepathic impression received from her. ED.\n\fOCT., 1913. Review. 127\nhistory, and (highly selected) bad arguments for immortality, confuted by\nalmost equally bad arguments against it, both being of the familiar sort\nwhich so cunningly keep the belief in a state of semi-animation while\nbaffling the desire for real knowledge. Mr. Haynes, in short, is a\npartisan, and not a scientific inquirer. But he is so candid, and ex-\npresses his bias so honestly, that it is easy to discount it. He confesses,\nfor example, that \" the alleged consolations of religion are merely an\nirritant\n\"\n(p. 5), and that he would prefer annihilation to a succession\nof lives (p. 64), and that psychical experiences are to him \"rather\nrepulsive\n\"\n(p. 92) ;\nbut he also calls the S.P.R. \" the one remaining\nrefuge for those who wish to believe in personal immortality,\" and\nadmits that though \"its proceedings may sometimes be rather tiresome\nto the outsider . . .\nthey are marked by the most studious impartiality\nand intellectual honesty\n\"\n(p. 91). It does not, indeed, seem quite con-\nsistent to hold both that \"apart from some belief in Christianity or\ntheism, I fail to see that there can be any strong presumption for\npersonal immortality\" (p. 71), and (p. 109) that \"those who really\nwant to be convinced resort to the spiritualist rather than the priest,\nd thereby get a *\nbetter run for their money\n' \"\n;\nbut his chapter on\nPsychical Research is thoroughly well meaning, even though his\nspeculations are neither profound nor original. Unfortunately it is\nvitiated by the uncritical willingness, now so common in our younger\ncritics, to accept eagerly, and on far from cogent evidence, whatever\nphenomena they think can be used to play off against those they do not\nwish to believe. Mr. Haynes, also, is quite ready to swallow telepathy,\nthe subliminal consciousness, and the hypnotization of sitters by\nmediums (p. 106) without inquiring whether the evidence renders these\nagencies reasonably certain, or whether they yield more than verbal\nexplanations, and still more, whether an order of nature expanded by\ntheir admission would be really congruous with the preconceptions of\nmaterialism.\nWhat is, however, of far greater interest is the revelation that Mr.\nHaynes is himself something of a psychic, and has had experiences\nwhich would, no doubt, have impressed him deeply if his bias had\nchanced to be the other way. He tells us (p. 103) that on one occasion\ne was walking at night past\n\" a new red-brick public-house throwing a\nstrong light on to a side road.\" He thought he saw \"a crowd of men\nnding outside in the light, and dressed in early 19th century clothes.\"\nAfter walking on twenty or thirty yards it struck him that \"\nthe clothes\nwere not those of the present day,\" and when he returned to the public-\nhouse to make inquiries, he found no one, and the landlord entirely\ndenied having had any customers. This may, of course, have been, as\nhe thinks, a case of hallucination (or, more probably, illusion) ;\nbut his\nveridical dream of the suicide of a college friend, which is told on\n.\n99-102, is much more important. He \"\nwoke up three or four times\nsolutely terrified by a dream in which I saw a person whom I could\nnot identify, but whom, for some reason, I thought to be a male con-\ntemporary of my own, lying down in a dim light which enabled me to\nsee nothing but the glint of a revolver barrel and part of a white face.\"\nThree days later he learnt that his friend had shot himself in a hotel at\nchf\nhe\n=\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1913.\nDijon about three hours before his dream. Rather more than a year\nlitter he went to the hotel, where the tragedy was '\nreconstructed\n'\nfor\nhim by the waiter ;\n\"\nand, as the waiter turned out the light, I saw what\nI instantly recognised to be the same light that I had seen in my\ndream. There was a lamp in the street immediately outside the room,\nfrom which came just enough light for me to have been able to see what\nI did.\" He also mentions that for some nights after his friend's death\n(i.e. presumably after it was known to him, not after the actual occur-\nrence), he \"was accustomed to wake and see him standing by the\nfireplace in my bedroom . . .\nsmoking a cigarette, in a shiny blue over-\ncoat and a bowler hat.\" No doubt the ghost's style of dress may have\njarred upon a fastidious taste, but Mr. Haynes's method of discouraging\nthis apparition\n\" to keep Whitaker's Almanack by my chair, and read\nall the Civil Service salaries until I could look up again and see that\nthe apparition was no longer there\n\"\nwas surely most unkind.\nEvidently Mr. Haynes \"intensely disliked the experience\" (p. 99),\nand unfortunately he did not record it at the time, although he kept a\ndiary. Nor did he \"\nlay it before the S.P.R., since the suicide involved\nwas carefully concealed by the family of the deceased, and I thought\nthe facts might lead to his identity being known.\" How vain this motive\nwas may be gathered from the fact that I did at once identify the case\nfrom his account. It was widely known in Oxford at the time, though,\nof course, minus Mr. Haynes's experience. In short, Mr. Haynes acted\nwith the usual uncultivated unkindness and scientific heedlessness of the\nordinary ghost-seer, which are still such obstacles in the path of psychical\nresearch.\nLastly, I may permit myself a few comments on Mr. Haynes's treat-\nment of my own discussions of the question of immortality, not so much\nbecause I wish to ventilate my own grievances (which are relatively\nslight) as because I can thereby illustrate his general attitude. To the\nsystematic discussion of the question in ch. xi. of Riddles of the Sphinx\nhe makes no allusion, though it is much more coherent than the views\nof many writers he does argue against. From ch. xvii.-xix. of Humanism\nhe makes a number of quotations, though he puts them in such a con-\ntext that they are usually misleading, and never reveal the real nature\nof the argument. But my Report on the Questionnaire of the American\nBranch is said to have \"abundantly [!] shown that most men do not\nwant to know about a future life\" (p. 110), and subsequently (p. 143)\nto have \"\nclearly shown \"\nthat doctrines of a future life\n\" have no real\ninterest for most men and women.\" I must protest that this was neither\nwhat I said nor what I meant, nor what I imagined myself to have shown,\nin my very tentative discussion of my very fragmentary data. When\none is painfully conscious of having been an imprudent 'prospector,'\nwho has just scratched the surface of a lode of knowledge which may\nextend into the depths of being, it is most humiliating to be praised for\nhaving\n'\nabundantly shown 5\nwhat only the labour of generations can\npossibly demonstrate ! And all that Mr. Haynes has shown is that it\nis as vain to expect help in a scientific research from the dialectics of\nRationalism as from the dogmas of Theology.\nF. C. S.

ED.]\nWHAT, in the main, is the characteristic of the promising though\nperturbing period in which we live ? Different persons would give\ndifferent answers, but the answer I venture to give is Rapid pro-\ngress, combined with fundamental scepticism. Let me hasten to\nexplain that I do not mean the well-worn and almost antique\ntheme of Theological scepticism : that controversy is practically\nin abeyance just now.\nTo illustrate the nature of the fundamental scientific or philo-\nsophic controversies to which I do refer, I may cite the kind of\ndominating controversies now extant, employing as far as possible\nonly a single word in each case so as to emphasise the necessary\nbrevity and insufficiency of the reference.\nIn Physiology the conflict ranges round Vitalism.\nIn Chemistry the debate concerns Atomic structure.\nIn Biology the dispute is on the laws of Inheritance.\nIn the vast group of Mathematical and Physical Sciences\npresent-day scepticism concerns what, if I had to\nexpress it in one word, I should call Continuity.\n\fNov., 1913. Sir Oliver Lodge's Presidential Address. 133\nStill more fundamental and deep-rooted than any of these\nsectional debates, however, a critical examination of scientific\nfoundations generally is going on ;\nand a kind of philosophic\nscepticism is in the ascendant, resulting in a mistrust of purely\nintellectual processes and in a recognition of the limited scope\nof science.\nFor science is undoubtedly an affair of the intellect, it examines\neverything in the cold light of reason ;\nand that is its strength.\nIt is a commonplace to say that science must have no likes or\ndislikes, must aim only at truth ;\nor as Bertrand Russell well\nputs it :\n'The kernel of the scientific outlook is the refusal to\nregard our own desires, tastes, and interests as affording\nI\na key to the understanding of the world.'\nThis exclusive single-eyed attitude of science is its strength ;\nbut, if pressed beyond the positive region of usefulness into a field\nof dogmatic negation and philosophising, it becomes also its weak-\nness. For the nature of man is a large thing, and intellect is\nonly a part of it : a recent part, too, which therefore necessarily,\nthough not consciously, suffers from some of the defects of newness\nand crudity, and should refrain from imagining itself the whole\nperhaps it is not even the best part of human nature. Emotion\nand Intuition and Instinct are immensely older than science, and\nin a comprehensive survey of existence they cannot be ignored.\nScientific men may rightly neglect them, in order to do their\nproper work, but philosophers cannot. So Philosophers have\nbegun to question some of the larger generalisations of science,\nand to ask whether, in the effort to be universal and comprehensive,\nwe have not extended our laboratory inductions too far.\nNot by philosophers only, but by scientific men also, ancient\npostulates are being pulled up by the roots. Physicists and\nMathematicians are beginning to consider whether the long-\nmown and well-established laws of mechanics hold true every-\nr\nhere and always, or whether the Newtonian scheme must be\nsplaced by something more modern, something to which Newton's\nlaws of motion are but an approximation.\nEven the laws of Geometry have been overhauled, and Euclidean\nreometry is seen to be but a special case of more fundamental\ngeneralisations. How far they apply to existing space, and how\nir Time is a reality or an illusion, and whether it can in any\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1913.\nsense depend on the motion or the position of an observer ;\nall\nthese things in some form or other are discussed.\nThe Conservation of Matter also, that mainmast of nineteenth\ncentury chemistry, and the existence of the Ether of Space, that\nsheet-anchor of nineteenth century physics, do they not some-\ntimes seem to be going by the board ?\nIf we had to summarise the main trend of physical controversy\nat present, I feel inclined to urge that it\nlargely turns on the\nquestion as to which way ultimate victory lies in the fight between\nContinuity and Discontinuity.\nOn the surface of nature at first we see discontinuity ; objects\ndetached and countable. Then we realise the air and other media,\nand so emphasise continuity and flowing quantities. Then we detect\natoms and numerical properties, and discontinuity once more makes\nits appearance. Then we invent the ether and are impressed with\ncontinuity again. But this is not likely to be the end ;\nand what\nthe ultimate end will be, or whether there is an ultimate end, is a\nquestion difficult to answer.\nThe modern tendency is to emphasise the discontinuous or\natomic character of everything. Matter has long been atomic,\nin the same sense as Anthropology is atomic; the unit of\nmatter is the atom, as the unit of humanity is the individual.\nWhether men or women or children they can be counted as\nso many\n'\nsouls.' And atoms of matter can be counted too.\nCertainly, however, there is an illusion of continuity. We\nrecognise it in the case of water. It appears to be a con-\ntinuous medium, and yet it is certainly molecular. It is\nmade continuous again, in a sense, by the ether postulated\nin its pores ;\nfor the ether is essentially continuous.\nElectricity itself i.e. electric charge strangely enough has\nproved itself to be atomic. There is a natural unit of electric\ncharge, as suspected by Earaday and Maxwell and named by\nJohnstone Stoney. Some of the electron's visible effects were\nstudied by Crookes in a vacuum ;\nand its weighing and\nmeasuring by J. J. Thomson were announced to the British\nAssociation meeting at Dover in 1899 a striking prelude to\nthe twentieth century.\nBiology may be said to be becoming atomic. It has long\nhad natural units in the shape of cells and nuclei, and some\ndiscontinuity represented by body-boundaries and cell-walls ;\n\f\\..v., 1913. Sir Oliver Lodge's Presidential A<l<lre88. 135\nbut now, in its laws of heredity as studied by Mendel,\nnumber and discontinuity are strikingly apparent among the\nreproductive cells, and the varieties of offspring admit of\nnumerical specification and prediction to a surprising extent ;\nwhile modification by continuous variation, which seemed to\nbe of the essence of Darwinism, gives place to, or at least is\naccompanied by, mutation, with finite and considerable and in\nappearance discontinuous change.\nYet undoubtedly Continuity is the backbone of evolution,\nas taught by all biologists no artificial boundaries or demar-\ncations between species a continuous chain of heredity from far\nbelow the amoeba up to man. Actual continuity of undying\ngerm-plasm, running through all generations, is taught likewise ;\nthough a strange discontinuity between this persistent element\nand its successive accessory body-plasms a discontinuity which\nwould convert individual organisms into mere temporary\naccretions or excretions, with no power of influencing or\nconveying experience to their generating cells is advocated by\n>ne school.\nAnd not only these fairly accepted results are prominent,\nbut some more difficult and unexpected theses in the same\nlirection are being propounded, and the atomic character of\nEnergy is advocated. How far can the analogy of granular,\ncorpuscular, countable, atomic, or discontinuous things be\npressed ? There are those who think it can be pressed very\nfar. But to avoid misunderstanding let me state, for what\nit may be worth, that I myself am an upholder of ultimate\nContinuity, and a fervent believer in the Ether of Space.\nThe Ether is the universal connecting medium which binds\nthe universe together, and makes it a coherent whole instead\nof a chaotic collection of independent isolated fragments. It\nis the vehicle of transmission of all manner of force, from\ngravitation down to cohesion and chemical affinity ;\nit is\ntherefore the storehouse of potential energy.\nMatter moves, but Ether is strained.\nWhat we call elasticity of matter is only the result of an\nalteration of configuration due to movement and readjustment\nof particles, but all the strain and stress are in the ether.\nThe ether itself does not move, that is to say it does not\nmove in the sense of locomotion, though it is probably in\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1913.\na violent state of rotational or turbulent motion in its smallest\nparts ;\nand to that motion its exceeding rigidity is due.\nMatter in motion, Ether under strain, constitute the funda-\nmental concrete things we have to do with in physics. The\nfirst pair represent kinetic energy, the second potential energy ;\nand all the activities of the material universe are represented\nby alternations from one of these forms to the other.\nIf the\n\"\nPrinciple of Eelativity\n\"\nin an extreme sense estab-\nlishes itself, it seems as if even Time would become discontinuous\nand be supplied in atoms, as money is doled out in pence or\ncentimes instead of continuously ;\nin which case our customary\nexistence will turn out to be no more really continuous than\nthe events on a kinematograph screen, while that great agent\nof continuity, the Ether of Space, will be relegated to the\nmuseum of historical curiosities.\nNow in all the debatable matters, of which I have indicated\npossibilities, I want to urge a conservative attitude. I accept\nthe new experimental results on which some of these theories\nsuch as the Principle of Eelativity are based, and am pro-\nfoundly interested in them, but I do not feel that they are\nso revolutionary as their propounders think. I see a way to\nretain the old and yet embrace the new, and I urge moderation\nin the uprooting and removal of landmarks.\nThe fact is we are living in an epoch of some very com-\nprehensive generalisations. The physical discovery of the\ntwentieth century, so far, is the Electrical Theory of Matter.\nThis is the great new theory of our time ;\nit was referred\nto, in its philosophical aspect, by Mr. Balfour in his Presidential\nAddress at Cambridge in 1904. We are too near it to be\nable to contemplate it properly ;\nit has still to establish itself\nand to develop in detail, but I anticipate that in some form\nor other it will prove true.\nThe theory is bound to have curious consequences ;\nand\nalready it has contributed to some of the uprooting and un-\ncertainty that I speak of. For, if it be true, every material\ninteraction will be electrical, i.e., etherial : and hence arises\nour difficulty. Every kind of force is transmitted by the\nether, and hence, so long as all our apparatus is travelling\ntogether at one and the same pace, we have no chance of\ndetecting the motion. That is the strength of the Principle\n\fNOV., 1913. Sir Oliver Lodged Presidential Address 137\nof .Relativity. The changes are not zero, but they cancel each\nother out of observation.\nIt is the extreme omnipresence and uniformity and universal\nagency of the ether of space that makes it so difficult to\nobserve. To observe anything you must have differences. If\nall actions at a distance are conducted at the same, rate through\nthe ether, the travel of none of them can be observed. Find\nsomething not conveyed by the ether and there is a chance.\nSpeaking as a physicist I must claim the ether as peculiarly\nour own domain. The study of molecules we share with the\nchemist, and matter in its various forms is investigated by all\nmen of science, but a study of the ether of space belongs to\nphysics only. I am not alone in feeling the fascination of this\nportentous entity. Its curiously elusive and intangible character,\ncombined with its universal and unifying permeance, its\napparently infinite extent, its definite and perfect properties,\nmake the ether the most interesting as it is by far the largest\nand most fundamental ingredient in the material cosmos.\nMatter it is not, but material it is ;\nit belongs to the material\nuniverse and is to be investigated by ordinary methods. But\nto say this is by no means to deny that it may have mental\nand spiritual functions to subserve in some other order of\nexistence, as matter has in this.\nThe ether of space is at least the great engine of con-\ntinuity. It may be much more, for without it there could\nardly be a material universe at all. Certainly, however, it\nessential to continuity ;\nit is the one all-permeating substance\nat binds the whole of the particles of matter together. It\nthe uniting and binding medium without which, if matter\nuld exist at all, it could exist only as chaotic and isolated\ngments : and it is the universal medium of communication\ntween worlds and particles. And yet it is possible for people\ndeny its existence, because it is unrelated to any of our\nnses, except sight, and to that only in an indirect and not\nsily recognised fashion.\nBut I hold that Science is incompetent to make compre-\nensive denials, even about the Ether, and that it goes wrong\nhen it makes the attempt. Science should not deal in nega-\nons : it is strong in affirmations, but nothing based on abstrac-\nion ought to presume to deny outside its own region.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1913.\nDenial is no more infallible than assertion. There are cheap\nand easy kinds of scepticism, just as there are cheap and easy\nkinds of dogmatism ;\nin fact scepticism can become viciously\ndogmatic, and science has to be as much on its guard against\npersonal predilection in the negative as in the positive direction.\nAn attitude of universal denial may be very superficial.\n'\nTo doubt everything or to believe everything are two\nequally convenient solutions ;\nboth dispense with the ne-\ncessity of reflection.'\nAll intellectual processes are based on abstraction. For\ninstance, History must ignore a great multitude of facts in\norder to treat any intelligently : it selects. So does Art ;\nand that is why a drawing is clearer than reality. Science\nmakes a diagram of reality, displaying the works, like a\nskeleton clock. Anatomists dissect out the nervous system,\nthe blood vessels, and the muscles, and depict them separately,\nthere must be discrimination for intellectual grasp, but in\nlife they are all merged and co-operating together ; they do\nnot really work separately, though they be studied separately.\nA scalpel discriminates : a dagger or a bullet crashes through\neverything. That is life, or rather death. The laws of nature\nare a diagrammatic framework, analysed or abstracted out of\nthe full comprehensiveness of reality.\nHence it is that Science has no authority in denials. To\ndeny effectively needs much more comprehensive knowledge\nthan to assert. And abstraction is essentially not comprehensive:\none cannot have it both ways. Science employs the methods\nof abstraction and thereby makes its discoveries.\nThe reason why some physiologists insist so strenuously on\nthe validity and self-sufficiency of the laws of physics and\nchemistry, and resist the temptation to appeal to unknown\ncauses even though the guiding influence and spontaneity of\nliving things are occasionally conspicuous as well as inexplic-\nable is that they are keen to do their proper work ;\nand\ntheir proper work is to pursue the laws of ordinary physical\nEnergy into the intricacies of\n\"\ncolloidal electrolytic structures\nof great chemical complexity\n\"\nand to study its behaviour\nthere.\nTo attribute the rise of sap to vital force would be absurd,\nit would be giving up the problem and stating nothing at all.\n\fNOV., I'.M:;.

Outlandish Territories\nmay in time be incorporated as States, but they must make their\nclaim good and become civilised first.\nIt is well for people to understand this definite limitation\nof scope quite clearly, else they wrest the spendid work of\n)iologists to their own confusion, helped it is true by a few\n)f the more robust or less responsible theorisers, among those\ni ho should be better informed and more carefully critical in\nleir philosophising utterances.\nBut, as is well known, there are more than a few biologists\n'ho, when taking a broad survey of their subject, clearly\njrceive and teach that before all the actions of live things\nare fully explained, some hitherto excluded causes must be\npostulated. Ever since the time of J. II.\nMayer it has been\nbecoming more and more certain that as regards performance\nof work, a living thing obeys the laws of physics, like every-\nthing else ;\nbut undoubtedly it initiates processes and produces\nresults that without it could not have occurred, from a bird's\nnest to a honeycomb, from a deal box to a warship. The\nbehaviour of a ship firing shot and shell is explicable in\nterms of energy, but the discrimination which it exercises\nbetween friend and foe is not so explicable. There is plenty\nof physics and chemistry and mechanics about every vital\naction, but for a complete understanding of it\nsomething\nbeyond physics and chemistry is needed.\nAnd life introduces an incalculable element. The vagaries\nof a fire or a cyclone could all be predicted by a Laplace's\nCalculator, given the initial positions, velocities, and the law\nof acceleration of the molecules ;\nbut no mathematician could\ncalculate the orbit of a common house-fly. A physicist into\nwhose galvanometer a spider had crept would be liable to get\nphenomena of a kind quite inexplicable, until he discovered\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.,1913.\nthe supernatural, i.e. literally superphysical, cause. I will\nrisk the assertion that Life introduces something incalculable\nand powerful amid the laws of physics ;\nit thus distinctly supple-\nments those laws, though it leaves them otherwise precisely\nas they were and obeys them all. We see only its effect, we\ndo not see Life itself. Conversion of Inorganic into Organic\nis effected always by living organisms. The conversion under\nthose conditions certainly occurs, and the process may be\nstudied.\nWhat appears to be quite certain is that there can be no\nterrestrial manifestation of life without matter. Hence naturally\npeople say, or they approve such sayings as,\n\"\nI discern in\nmatter the promise and potency of all forms of life.\" Of\nall terrestrial manifestations of life, certainly. How else\ncould it manifest itself save through matter ?\n\"\nI detect\nnothing in the organism but the laws of Chemistry and\nPhysics,\" it is said. Very well :\nnaturally enough. That is\nwhat they are after ; they are studying the physical and\nchemical aspects or manifestations of life. But life itself\nlife and mind and consciousness they are not studying, and\nthey exclude them from their purview. Matter is what\nappeals to our senses here and now ;\nMaterialism is appropriate\nto the material world ;\nnot as a philosophy but as a working\ncreed, as a proximate and immediate formula for guiding research.\nEverything beyond that belongs to another region, and must\nbe reached by other methods. To explain the Psychical in\nterms of Physics and Chemistry is simply impossible ;\nhence\nthere is a tendency to deny its existence, save as an epiphe-\nnomenon. But all such philosophising is unjustified, and is\nreally bad Metaphysics.\nHow consciousness became associated with matter, how life\nexerts guidance over chemical and physical forces, how mechanical\nmotions are translated into sensations, all these things are\npuzzling, and demand long study. But the fact that these\nthings are so admits of no doubt ;\nand difficulty of explanation\nis no argument against them. The blind man restored to\nsight had no opinion as to how he was healed, nor could\nhe vouch for the moral character of the Healer, but he\nplainly knew that whereas he was blind now he saw. About\nthat fact he was the best possible judge. So it is also with\n\fNov., 1913. Sir Oliver Lo<l<i<<' Presidential Addr 141\n\"this main miracle that thou art thoti, With power on thine\nown act and on the world.\"\nTo understand the action of life itself, the simplest plan\nis not to think of a microscopic organism, or any unfamiliar\nanimal, but to make use of our own experience as living\nbeings. Any positive instance serves to stem a comprehensive\ndenial ;\nand if the reality of mind and guidance and plan\nis denied because they make no appeal to sense, then think\nhow the world would appear to an observer to whom the\nexistence of men was unknown and undiscoverable, while yet\nall the laws and activities of nature went on as they do now.\nIf he looked at the Firth of Forth, for instance, he would\nsee piers arising in the water, beginning to sprout, reaching\nacross in strange manner till they actually join or are joined\nby pieces attracted up from below to complete the circuit\n(a solid circuit round the current). He would see a sort of\nbridge or filament thus constructed, from one shore to the\nother, and across this bridge insect-like things crawling and\nreturning for no very obvious reason.\nAnd note that what we observe, in such understood cases,\nis an Interaction of Mind and Matter ;\nnot Parallelism nor\nEpiphenomenalism nor anything strained or difficult, but a\nstraightforward utilisation of the properties of matter and\nenergy for purposes conceived in the mind, and executed by\nmuscles guided by acts of will.\nSuperficially and physically we are very limited. Our sense\norgans are adapted to the observation of matter ;\nand nothing\nelse directly appeals to us. Our nerve-muscle-system is adapted\nto the production of motion in matter, in desired ways ;\nand\nnothing else in the material world can we accomplish. Our\nbrain and nerve systems connect us with the rest of the\nphysical world. Our senses give us information about the\nmovements and arrangements of matter. Our muscles enable\nus to produce changes in those distributions. That is our\nequipment for human life; and human history is a record of\nwhat we have done with these parsimonious privileges.\nOur brain, which by some means yet to be discovered con-\nnects us with the rest of the material world, has been thought\npartially to disconnect us from the mental and spiritual realm,\nto which we really belong, but from which for a time and for\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1913.\npractical purposes we are isolated. Our common or social\nassociation with matter gives us certain opportunities and\nfacilities, combined with obstacles and difficulties which are\nthemselves opportunities for struggle and effort.\nThrough matter we become aware of each other, and can\ncommunicate with those of our fellows who have ideas\nsufficiently like our own for them to be stimulated into activity\nby a merely physical process set in action by ourselves. By\na timed succession of vibratory movements (as in speech and\nmusic), or by a static distribution of materials (as in writing,\npainting, and sculpture), we can carry on intelligent intercourse\nwith our fellows ;\nand we get so used to these ingenious and\nroundabout methods, that we are apt to think of them and\ntheir like as not only the natural but as the only possible\nmodes of communication, and that anything more direct would\ndisarrange the whole fabric of science.\nIt is clearly true that our bodies constitute the normal\nmeans of manifesting ourselves to each other while on the\nplanet ;\nand that if the physiological mechanism whereby we\naccomplish material acts is injured, the conveyance of our\nmeaning and the display of our personality inevitably and\ncorrespondingly suffer.\nSo conspicuously is this the case that it has been possible\nto suppose that the communicating mechanism, formed and\nworked by us, is the whole of our existence : and that we\nare essentially nothing but the machinery by which we are\nknown. We find the machinery utilising nothing but well-\nknown forms of energy, and subject to all the laws of chemistry\nand physics, it would be strange if it were not so, and from\nthat fact we try to draw valid deductions as to our nature,\nand as to the impossibility of our existing apart from and\nindependent of these temporary modes of material activity\nand manifestation. We so uniformly employ them, in our\npresent circumstances, that we should be on our guard against\ndeception due to this very uniformity. Material bodies are all\nthat we have any control over, are all that we are experi-\nmentally aware of; anything that we can do with these is\nopen to us ; any conclusions we can draw about them may be\nlegitimate and true. But to step outside their province and\nto deny the existence of any other region because we have\n\fKov.,1918.

When these two abstrac-\ntions combine, co-operate, interact, we get reality again. It\nis like Poynting's theorem.\nThe only way to refute or confuse the theory of Evolution\nis to introduce the subjectivity of time. That theory involves\nthe reality of time, and it is in this sense that Prof. Bergson\nuses the great phrase\n\"\nCreative Evolution.\"\nI see the whole of material existence as a steady passage\nfrom past to future, only the single instant which we call the\npresent being actual. The past is not non-existent, however, it is\nstored in our memories, there is a record of it in matter, and\nthe present is based upon it ;\nthe future is the outcome of the\npresent, and is the product of evolution.\nExistence is like the output from a loom. The pattern, the\ndesign for the weaving, is in some sort\n\"\nthere\n\"\nalready ;\nbut\nwhereas our looms are mere machines, once the guiding cards\nhave been fed into them, the Loom of Time is complicated by\na multitude of free agents who can modify the web, making\nthe product more beautiful or more ugly according as they are\nin harmony or disharmony with the general scheme. I\nventure to maintain that manifest imperfections are thus\naccounted for, and that freedom could be given on no other\nterms, nor at any less cost.\nWhere inorganic matter alone is concerned, there everything\ndetermined. Wherever full consciousness has entered, new\nwers arise, and the faculties and desires of the conscious\nparts of the scheme have an effect upon the whole. It is not\nguided from outside but from within, and the guiding power\nis immanent at every instant. Of this guiding power we are\na small but not wholly insignificant portion.\nThat evolutionary progress is real is a doctrine of profound\nsignificance, and our efforts at social betterment are justified\nbecause we are a part of the scheme, a part that has become\nnscious, a part that realises, dimly at any rate, what it is\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1913.\ndoing and what it is\naiming at. Planning and aiming are\ntherefore not absent from the whole, for we are a part of the\nwhole, and are conscious of them in ourselves.\nAlthough I am speaking ex cathedra, as one of the repre-\nsentatives of orthodox science, I will not shrink from a personal\nnote summarising the result on my own mind of thirty years'\nexperience of psychical research, begun without predilection\nindeed with the usual hostile prejudice. This is not the place\nto enter into detail or to discuss facts scorned by orthodox\nscience, but I cannot help remembering that an utterance from\nthis chair is no ephemeral production, for it remains to be\ncriticised by generations yet unborn, whose knowledge must\ninevitably be fuller and wider than our own. Your President\ntherefore should not be completely bound by the shackles of\npresent-day orthodoxy, nor limited to beliefs fashionable at the\ntime. In justice to myself and my co-workers I must risk\nannoying my present hearers, not only by leaving on record\nour conviction that occurrences now regarded as occult can be\nexamined and reduced to order by the methods of science\ncarefully and persistently applied, but by going further and\nsaying, with the utmost brevity, that already the facts so\nexamined have convinced me that memory and affection are\nnot limited to that association with matter by which alone\nthey can manifest themselves here and now, and that personality\npersists beyond bodily death. The evidence nothing new or\nsensational, but cumulative and demanding prolonged serious\nstudy to my mind goes to prove that discarnate intelligence,\nunder certain conditions, may interact with us 011 the material\nside, thus indirectly coming within our scientific ken; and\nthat gradually we may hope to attain some understanding of\nthe nature of a larger, perhaps etherial, existence, and of the\nconditions regulating intercourse across the chasm. A body of\nresponsible investigators has even now landed on the treacherous\nbut promising shores of a new continent.\n\fNo. CCCIV.-VoL. XVI.

Dr. Wallace was elected an Honorary Member of\nthe Society in 1882. He has at various times contributed\nto discussions in our Proceedings and Journal, but his chief work\nin connection with psychical research was done long before the\nSociety was founded. He was one of the pioneers who, in\nthe early seventies, determined to investigate for themselves\nin a region which at that time was very generally regarded as\nbeyond the pale of science, and the entrance to which was\n)rohibited on pain of scorn and ridicule. His claim to fame\n?sts of course on his wonderful work as a naturalist and on\nlis having, almost at the same time as Darwin, but independently\nof him, arrived at practically the same theory of the origin of\nspecies through natural selection. It was characteristic of\nWallace that his chief book on this subject was entitled Dar-\nwinism, but his own name is one that will not be forgotten\nwhile the history of the advancement of science in England\nis remembered.\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1913.\nPKOFESSOR BERGSON AND MIND.\nBY F. C. CONSTABLE.\nPROFESSOR BERGSON, in his admirable address to the S.P.E.,\nsaid :\n\"\nThe brain simply extracts from the life of the mind\nthat which is capable of representation in movement. The\ncerebral life is to the mental life what the movements of the\nbaton of a conductor are to the symphony. The brain, then,\nis that which allows the mind to adjust itself exactly to\ncircumstances. It is the organ of attention to life. . . . But\nfrom this it results that one of the roles of the brain is to limit\nthe vision of the mind, to render its action more efficacious.\"\nProfessor Bergson holds that the mind is distinct from mere\ncerebral activity ;\ncerebral activity is no more than a means\nfor the mind in limited action to\n\"\nvision\n\"\nour material universe.\nThis theory brings Professor Bergson into conflict with those\nwho do not distinguish between cerebral activity and mind ;\nthat is, with those who hold the theory of rigorous parallelism\nbetween cerebral and mental activity : Professor Bergson is on\nthe side of the angels.\nBut have we any human evidence in support of or against\nProfessor Bergson's theory ? The professor's beauty of form in\nlanguage and his genius of imagination are perhaps scarcely in\nagreement with the dry bones of bloodless argument. In spite\nof this I would, in support of the angels, enter on the desert\nof dry argument.\nMen of science, at present, accept the theory of the conser-\nvation of energy, and, if the theory be relied on, it assumes\nenergy to be, in itself, something unaffected by time and space,\nas those terms were understood before the advent of Professor\nBergson. The manifestations of energy in protean form\ngravity, electricity, etc. are manifestations in our universe of\ntime and space, but energy itself remains, by definition, noumenal.\nThese men of science place the foundation of our universe in\nsomething which is not material, but which, changeless in time\nand space, acts on the material, or possibly sets up the material.\nOne might therefore expect that they would treat mind\nas something distinct from mere cerebral activity : would treat\nit as something relatively noumenal which is partially manifest\nin relation to our universe in or through cerebral activity.\n\fDec., 1913. Professor Bergson and Mi-mi. 147\nBut with profound respect for Professor Bergson the\nstrongest argument is to be found in Emanuel Kant's trans-\ncendental philosophy. I have worried out this argument at\nobjectionable length in Pn-afmalil i\/\n<tnd Telepathy, and so here\ngive but a digest made as intelligible as possible.\nHume started with the assumption that there is no distinc-\ntion between mental and cerebral activity, and was led, by\nsound argument, to a conclusion\n\"\nthat all our distinct percep-\ntions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives\nany real connexion among distinct existences.\" If mental and\ncerebral activity are not to be distinguished, Hume's conclusion\nfollows directly : for then human experience begins and ends\nwith the presentation of objects.\nThen came Kant, and, with Hume, he makes human experi-\nence begin with the presentation of objects. But he does not make\nit so end, for if he did, Hume's difficulty would not be overcome.\nKant introduces the\n\"\nschematism of the understanding,\" and\nlys :\n\"\nIn truth it is not images of objects, but schemata, which\nlie at the foundation of our pure sensuous conceptions.\"\nBut how is this schematism possible ?\nThrough the power\nimagination which is in man. And whence comes this\n>wer ? From, Kant holds, the\n\"\nsoul of man.\"\nFor the\n\"\nsoul of man \"\nwe may use the term \"\nintuitive self,\"\nI have done, or the transcendent or subliminal self, or we\niay use any term we please. But the point is that Kant\nlistinguished mind from cerebral activity, and produced cogent\njuments in support of his contention.\nAgain, if mind be the same as cerebral activity, man cannot\n>y any possibility think outside the limits of cerebral activity.\nThis argument, so far as I know, has never been replied to.\nIf man can only think or have \"\nawareness\n\"\nin parallelism\ncerebral activity, he cannot be\n\"\naware\n\"\nthat he is\nthinking\ndthin limits. The limits of his thought cannot, by himself,\nrecognized as limits. For, to determine his own thought\nlimited he must have an idea or an \"\nawareness\n\"\nof thought\nr\nhich is not limited : he must have an idea or\n\"\nawareness\n\"\n>f\nsomething outside his limits of thought, and this necessarily\nimplies an idea or\n\"\nawareness\n\"\nof something to be thought\nmtside his limits of thought. This is impossible. It is a\nlatter of indifference what universe such a man might exist\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1913.\nin : his power of thought would still be subject to his limits\nof thought : all his thought in limits would be exhaustive,\nto him, noumenal.\nBut what can man do ? He can and does determine his\nthought as relative, that is, as limited. No human being has\never been able to determine what form, size, substance, or colour\nis. Man cannot even relate form to size, size to colour, for\ninstance ;\nall he can do is to relate one form to another, one\nsize to another, and so determine relative definitions. So our\nmind is\n\"\naware\n\"\nthat its knowledge is not knowledge : that\nits knowledge is no more than relative knowledge. But it is\ncerebral activity that conditions thought, so cerebral activity is\na subject of the\n\"\nawareness\n\"\nof the mind : the mind \"\nlooks\ndown on\n\"\ncerebral activity.\nMan \"\narrives at\n\"\nvital knowledge of his own ignorance.\nThis would be impossible if he were but a personality of limited\ncerebral thought, for, existing solely in such limits of thought,\nthere could, to him, be no possible field for thought or\n\"\naware-\nness\n\"\noutside his own limits. There would be nothing of\n\"\nawareness\n\"\nin him to look down on cerebral activity.\nHerein, I think, we find the strongest argument in support\nof the theory of distinction between mind and cerebral activity.\nAgain, following Kant, what we know of mental \"\noperation\n\"\ndemands the presentation to the mind of the manifold of\nintuition, and this cannot result from the mere presentation\nof objects : the presentation can only exist if we assume what\nKant terms a soul in man. Neither this presentation nor its\nreception is measurable ;\nthere is involved no more than what\nmay be termed a\n\"\ncondition precedent\n\"\nnecessary to explain\nthe observed\n\"\noperation\n\"\nof the mind. Cerebral activity is\nrelated to\n\"\ncerebral\n\"\nfacts, which, being in time and space (as\nthe terms are ordinarily understood), are measurable : the mind\n\"\nmeasures\n\"\nthrough cerebral activity, but the\n\"\nmeasurement\n\"\nwould be useless for mental activity without the presentation\nof the manifold of intuition.\nI do not enter now on the question of what mind is, or\nthe distinction between time (as measurable in relation to space)\non the one hand and duration on the other. All attempted\nis to show that there are strong, even scientifically strong,\narguments in support of Professor Bergson's assumption.\n\fDec., 1913. Cases. 149\nCASES.\nL. 1198. Vision.\nTHE following case of a telepathic impression was sent to us\nby Mrs. A. K. Bulley, an Associate of the Society. The per-\ncipient, whose real name we suppress by her own request, is\nhere called Miss Hartmann. She is a friencl of Mrs. Bulley's\niiiul was staying with her at the time of her experience,\nwhich it will be noted occurred before any one in the house\nknew of the illness with which it coincided.\nMrs. Bulley's account is as follows :\nNESS, NESTON, CHESHIRE,\n5.40 a.m., Nov. 14, 1913.\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 12th, my hand-bag was packed for me to\ntake the 10.16 [train] Burton Point Station for Chirk, via Wrexhaiu,\nwhen I received a telephone message, sent by the landlady of a very\nold family friend, a dressmaker,\n\" Miss Hyde is\nseriously ill and needs\nthe care of some friend.\" I phoned back I would come at once.\nI then wired to my friend in Wales that I was summoned to an old\nfriend very seriously ill, and might have to postpone my visit.\nI caught the next train to Liverpool, 10.38 a.m.\nBefore I left, when I said good-bye to [Miss Hartmann] she said\nwith much feeling, \"Poor Mum!\" (my home name). \"Why poor?\nIt's lucky it caught me in time so that I can help her.\" She said\nagain, \"Poor Mum. She will die. Will you mind very much?\" I\nassured her there was no need to jump to the conclusion Miss Hyde\nwould die because she was ill, and I attached no importance to [Miss\nHartmann's] conviction.\nThe landlady explained she had sent for me [herself], Miss Hyde not\nrealising the seriousness of her case and always being anxious \"not\nto trouble any one.\" [It was a case of] stoppage of the bowels;\nsickness and pain setting in the night before ;\nthe patient seventy\nyears old. . . .\nMrs. Bulley, after removing the patient to a Nursing Home,\nwhere she left her comfortably settled, and \"\nenjoying a cup of\ntea,\" returned home, and she states that Miss Hartmann, on seeing\nher, immediately asked,\n\"\nIs she dead ?\n\"\nAt about 9.45 p.m.,\non receiving a telephone message that Miss Hyde's condition was\nserious and an operation necessary, Mrs. Bulley returned to\nthe Home. Her account continues as follows :\nI was allowed to stay with the patient, who was absolutely\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec.,1913.\nfree from pain, and quite herself at first, till she died at 8.15 a.m.,\nNov. 13, 1913. While she dozed I thought much of my old nurse,\nEdaw, whom I was to meet that very afternoon on her return from\nOxfordshire : what a shock it would be to her that her old friend of\nforty-seven years' standing was gone (Edaw didn't even know Miss\nHyde was ill), how could I break it to her, etc. It was much on\nmy mind.\nAn hour before the patient died I was amazed by her temporary\nextraordinary likeness, in the lower part of the face, to \"\nGran,\" my\nhusband's old nurse, when she lay dying. It carried me back to that\ndeath-bed in April, 1912, so vividly that I altered the position of\nthe lamp, and by and by drew up the blind ;\nit was almost uncanny\nthat two mouths, utterly different when closed, should appear so\nlike then. Later the patient closed her mouth, and the likeness\nvanished. . . .\nMrs. Bulley then relates that when she returned home in\nthe evening of the same day, Miss Hartmann told her that on\nthe night of Tuesday, Nov. llth, at about 11.45 p.m., she\nhad an impression of a dying woman, whose death would\ncause pain to Mrs. Bulley ;\nat first she thought it was Edaw,\nthen that it was \"\nGran,\" who had died a year before, but, on\nlooking again, she saw it was a woman she did not know.\nHer own full account of this is given below. Mrs. Bulley\ncontinues :\nI have often meant to note down somewhat similar telepathic\ninstances connected with [Miss Hartmann], but have let them slip.\nThough now of no evidential value, to shew her type I may mention\nthat once when I called her in the morning she looked absent-minded,\nand said in a puzzled voice,\n\" Now that's very unusual. Mother is\nwriting to me now. But she never does write letters before breakfast.\nShe is the first up, she attends to her flowers and does other things,\nbut never writes letters.\" So we noted the day the letter should\narrive, and it came. \"What did I tell you,\" said [Miss Hartmann],\n\"listen to this,\" and she read how her mother said, \"contrary to\nmy custom, I am writing to you before breakfast, etc.\". . .\nH. A. BULLEY.\nThe percipient's account, which she dictated to Mrs. Bulley,\nand afterwards signed, is as follows :\nNov. 14, 1913, 10 a.m.\nI didn't dream, I was awake. I found myself sitting up in bed\n\fDec., 1913. <''i#e8. 151\nand lighting the candle. And then I saw an old woman in bed,\nand I was quite conscious that she was dying. Then I felt that\nhorrible feeling that somebody else was going to suffer badly from\nthat death, that I had no personal feeling in the matter. Then I\nthought it was Edaw. I think it was a light head, not grey, and\nI think it was this made me think \"No, it isn't Edaw, it's Gran.\"\nThen I thought \"It can't be Gran, because I know she's dead.\"\nAnd then I thought, anyhow I won't tell Mum because she might\nbelieve it was Edaw, and it certainly wasn't Edaw. When I lit\nthe candle I saw it was 10 minutes to 12, or 20 to, I forget which\nnow.\n[The woman] was lying on her back, quite calm, but there was\nsomething about the breathing like Gran. I saw her face ;\nif I could\nmodel, I could do it. I remember the shape, the colour, and the\nline of nose rather a good nose from the tip.\nI have had the above read over to me, and it is what I have\nthis moment dictated.\n(Signed) M. M. HARTMANN.\nMrs. Bulley obtained the following independent statement\nfrom Nellie, the housemaid, to whom Miss Hartmann related\nher experience the morning after the occurrence :\n8.15 a.m., Nov. 14, 1913.\n[Miss Hartmann] told me she saw some old person, who she\nthought was Edaw, who looked as if she was dying; it was\nsuch a relief to her to find it was not. She told me this about\n9.40, just as Mrs. Bulley had got the telephone message about\nMiss Hyde.\nE. DAVIES.\nMrs. Bulley wrote later:\nNovember 16th, 1913.\nI had told no one at all about the likeness to Gran until after\n*I\nheard [Miss Hartmann's] experience. We all knew the death would\nhit Edaw hard ; [Miss Hartmann] would not need to be told that ;\nbut\nwhen she had her experience there was this remarkable coincidence,\nthat she saw an old woman dying, that the thought of Edaw and Gran\nwas closely associated with it, and that the very next night I was\nfor hours watching an old woman dying, and thinking especially of\nEdaw and Gran.\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1913.\nG. 287. Apparition.\nTHE following account of an apparition was sent to Mr. G. W.\nBalfour by a correspondent, Mr. F., who is well acquainted\nwith the percipient. The names and addresses of all the\npersons concerned were given to us, but by special request\npseudonyms or initials have been substituted here.\nThe first written account of her experience was given by\nMadame Marbot, as she is called here, in a letter to Mr. F. r\nto whom she had described her experience verbally at an\nearlier date. Her letter is as follows :\n[June, 1913.]\nYou have asked me to write down for you what I saw at N., that\nsmall village in the mountains of Savoy. Here it is :\n'\nYou remember that I was laid up for some time below, near the\nlake. It was thought that the pure fresh air of the heights would\ndo me good, and I was taken up in a sort of camp-bed. The only\ninn of the village is at its entrance. Then comes a small restaurant,\nand the ascending road turns round into the village, which one\ncannot see from the hotel.\nI was carried into my room, and for the next three weeks spent\nmy time in it and in a sitting-room next to it. Then I was able\nto go down and sit in a meadow, some little distance from the\ninn and to its left. At last, after another week, I thought I would\nventure up to the right, into the village, which was unknown to\nme, and there happened the strange thing which you asked me to\nrelate.\nI said before there was a turn which led to the village. To the\nright is a road leading up to the parish church, which is hidden by\na large rock ;\nto the left, a house with a barn, and next to it a sort\nof chalet with a pointed roof. As I looked up, attracted by its old\nqueer build, I saw behind the top of the roof, and seemingly resting\nhis hands on the other side, a Curate in Roman Catholic clothing\nand with a strange sort of cap on his head, like those worn by\nCurates in church, but with what seemed stripes of white and black.\nThe priest had a pale face with regular features and seemed to\nlook at me intently, not even turning off his eyes when I stared\nback, wishing him to understand that I thought his manners\nstrange. In this way I had a very good sight of him, and, if an\nartist, I could easily recall his features on paper. A stone, over\nwhich I stumbled, made me look down instinctively. When I\n\fDec., 1913. Gases. l\">-'i\nturned my eyes again, the apparition was gone, and I went onwards\nthinking to myself how the manners of those village priests wanted\nimprovement.\nA few steps further I arrived at a sort of little square, where the\nvillage fountain and the letter-box are, and after putting in a letter,\nI sat on a stone staircase under it, and had ,'a good look at the\nchalet, where I had seen the priest. It was uninhabited ;\nits shutters\nwere shut, and the whole place had an air of abandonment and\ndesolation. I could not see what was on the other side of the roof,\nwhere there must be a balcony, on which the Curate must have stood,,\nso I moved on to the other side of the little square, from where I\nwould have a view of the back. To my intense astonishment there\nwas no balcony, nor anything but a roof as pointed as to the front,\nnor ^ny means of getting to it in any way. Then the Curate\nmust have been an apparition, and this thought sent an unpleasant\nsort of cold shiver through me, and I turned back home at once.\nOn my way I met my landlady's daughter, a girl of sixteen.\n\"What is that chalet there?\" said I, \"and why is it\nunoccupied?\"\n\"Oh, well,\" said the girl, \"we don't like to speak of it, but ask my\nmother, maybe she won't mind telling you.\" The good woman was\non her threshold, and of course I asked her at once, and then I\nheard that the house was unoccupied, because no one could stay\nin it. There were strange noises, knocks in fact, it was considered\nhaunted. \" Years ago,\" said she,\n\" a Curate inhabited it, because he\nhad property here and also relations.\"\nMadame Marbot here gives the landlady's account of the\ngeneral theory of the haunt, which was attributed to the fact\nthat the Priest's will could not be found, and that the next\nof kin, who would not have benefitted by it, were suspected of\nhaving destroyed it.\nMadame Marbot continues :\nI became convinced that I had seen the spirit of the Curate.\nMany a time did I pass before that chalet, but he appeared no\nmore. Days passed, and I went back to my abode down near the\nlake. One day, as I was coming out of a shop, a woman whom\nI vaguely recognised as having seen her here before, came up to\nme and then asked me if I would kindly receive her for a few\nmoments. She came home with me, and then asked me if it was\nreally true that I had seen the apparition of a Curate up in the\nvillage of N. \"\nFor,\" said she,\n\" I belong to the family to whom\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1913.\nour relation, the Curate, left his property in a will, which could\nnot be found after his death.\" ... I naturally gave this woman the\nassurance that it was perfectly true. I had seen that apparition.\n\" But what a strange headgear he had,\" said I,\n\"\nWhy were there\nthose unusual stripes of white and black ?\n\"\nAfter a moment's\nthought the woman said,\n\"\nWell, 1 think I can account for them.\nWhen our relation was put in his coffin, the women around him\npassed a white ribbon between the cloth stripes of his cap.\" I\n-cannot remember what reason the woman gave for it, or perhaps\nshe gave no reason, but it is strange I saw this detail, known by\nnone but the dead Priest's immediate attendants ! The woman\nwent away quite pleased, and I know no more, as I have left that\npart of the country.\". . .\n[Signed] L. MARBOT.\nThe following questions were then put to Madame Marbot\nthrough Mr. F. :\n(1) Would it be possible to obtain corroboration of the story from\nMadame Marbot's landlady, to whom apparently she related her\nexperience immediately after it occurred 1\n(2) Would it be possible to obtain a first-hand account from the\nrelative of the Curate, with regard to her statement about the tying\nof the white ribbon in the cap]\n(3) Could any statement be obtained from people living in the\nvillage as to the alleged haunting of the house 1 Is it certain that\nMadame Marbot had never heard that the house was haunted 1\n(4) What was the date of Madame Marbot's experience ?\nIn reply to these enquiries Madame Marbot wrote to Mr.\nF. as follows :\nJuly 31st, 1913.\nI myself can only repeat that I had no idea there was such a\nthing as a house reputed haunted in the village. It is impossible\nfor me to say the exact date [of my experience]. I never dreamt\nany one would take an interest in it, and all I can tell is that it\nwas after the 15th of August, 1912; between the 15th and the 25th.\nI am sorry not to be able to send you the evidence of the woman\nabout the white ribbon. She is no longer here, and as [the Priest's\ndeath] happened some years ago, it is difficult to obtain evidence of\nany value about it now.\n[Signed] L. MARBOT.\nThree corroborative statements in French were enclosed with\nthis letter. Translations of them are as follows :\n\fDec., 1!M3. Oa \\~>~>\n[.July, 1913.]\nI certify by these lines that [Madame Marbot] told me last year\nthat she had seen the apparition of a Priest above a house of the\nvillage of N. and that she had been told afterwards that the house\nwas considered haunted.\n[Signed] ABB R., Vicar of St. G.\nJuly 25, 1913.\nLast year, in the month of August, [Madame Marbot] told me\nthat she had seen the ghost of a Priest, above a house where he\nhad formerly lived.\n[Signed] CKLINE N.\nJuly 30, 1913.\nI remember perfectly that [Madame Marbot] told me last year\nin the month of August that she had seen the apparition of a Priest\nabove a house in the village.\nShe did not know that this house was reputed to be haunted.\n[Signed] MELANIE C., Innkeeper.\nMadame C. is the landlady to whom Madame Marbot related\nher experience immediately after its occurrence.\nSubsequently Madame Marbot succeeded in finding the wit-\nness who had described the black cap that the priest was\nwearing at the time of his burial.\nHer testimony, which is in French, is translated as follows :\nAugust, 1913.\nI remember very well having talked with [Madame Marbot] of\nthe apparition which she saw last year in the month of August.\nShe spoke to me of the black and white headgear which surprised\nher, and I told her that it might well be so, and I can corroborate\nher as to the white, which was put in by my husband.\n[Signed] MARIE C.\nREVIEW.\nIN the Century Magazine for September, 1913, there is an interesting\narticle by Maurice Maeterlinck called Life after Death. 1\nMr. Maeter-\nlinck declares that in his opinion there are only two modern theories\nof personal survival which are worth serious discussion, \"the\nneotheosophical and neospiritualistic theories.\"\n1\nThe article appears also in the Fortnightly Review for September and October,\n1913.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1913.\nIn discussing the neospiritualistic theory, Mr. Maeterlinck deals\nchiefly with the evidence collected by the Society for Psychical\nResearch. With many of his conclusions most investigators will\nagree, but on some points his arguments are open to objection.\nHe says that \"supernormal manifestations\" relating to \"life beyond\nthe grave\n\"\ncan be divided into two categories : direct manifesta-\ntions, that is to say, objective and spontaneous apparitions, and\nmanifestations obtained by the agency of mediums, e.g. by automatic\nwriting. In discussing the question of direct manifestations, Mr.\nMaeterlinck says :\nIt appears, therefore, to be as well established as a fact can be that a\nspiritual or nervous shape, an image, a belated reflection of life, is capable\nof subsisting for some time, of releasing itself from the body, or surviving\nit, ... of manifesting itself to the living, and, sometimes, of communi-\ncating with them.\nFor the rest, we have to recognise that these apparitions are very\nbrief. They take place only at the precise moment of death, or follow\nvery shortly after.\nMr. Maeterlinck speaks of these apparitions as\n\"\nobjective,\" whereas\nthe evidence at present available points rather to their being\nhallucinations, sometimes of telepathic origin.\n1\nIf this view is\njustified, then there is no such dividing line as Mr. Maeterlinck\ndraws between the phenomena of apparitions and those of automatic\nwriting. Both may be the result of a telepathic impression, whether\nfrom the living or from the dead, which is expressed in one case\nby a sensory hallucination, and in the other by a form of motor\nautomatism.\nIn regard to mediumistic communications, Mr. Maeterlinck rightly\nobserves that so long as it is possible to explain them by the\naction of forces which we know to exist, e.g. living minds, we have\nno right to ascribe them to forces which we do not know to exist.\nHe deals only briefly with the evidence recently obtained by cross-\ncorrespondences, observing that he does not consider that the suspicion\nof telepathy is here removed. He alleges the trivial nature of the com-\nmunications as a reason against supposing them to come from the dead :\nIs it really worth while to have passed through the terrifying gorges\nwhich open on the eternal fields in order to remember that we had a\ngreat uncle called Peter, and that our cousin Paul was afflicted with\nvaricose veins or a gastric complaint ? . . . Do they [the dead] not yet\nknow that the sign which will prove to us that they survive is to be\nfound not with us but with them, on the other side of the grave ?\n1\nSee Telepathic Hallucinations, by F. Podmore.\n\fDec., 1913.

He suggests that convincing evidence might be\ngiven by means of \"an astronomical or biological revelation.\" But\nis it not likely that, following the course whicn Mr. Maeterlinck\nhimself prescribes, the majority of people would ascribe these\nrevelations, if they proved correct, to known causes, e.g. scientific\ngenius, or chance coincidence? But although the difficulties in the\nway of obtaining evidence of this kind are very great, it must be\nadmitted that such evidence might conceivably be obtained. The\nfailure to obtain it does not, however, vitiate other kinds of\nevidence, especially as we know almost nothing of the conditions\nunder which the supposed communications occur. Cross-correspond-\nences must be judged on their own merits, not in relation to the\nkind of evidence we might hope or desire to get.\nAt the conclusion of his article Mr. Maeterlinck criticises Colonel\nde Rochas's attempt to prove the transmigration of souls by the\nrecovery through hypnotism of the memory of former existences,\nand points out that the experiments are vitiated by the fact that\nthe possibility of suggestion has not been eliminated.\nMr. Maeterlinck shows himself an open-minded critic of psychical\nresearch, and it is a matter for congratulation that so distinguished\na writer should interest himself in this subject. H. DE G. V.\nI\nPERSONAL SURVIVAL: THE FORM OF EVIDENCE.\nBY F. C. CONSTABLE.\nPOSSIBLY the suggestions herein made may be of more weight\nbecause the writer, while accepting the evidence for personal\nsurvival to be found in cross-correspondences, has not been\naffected by it so strongly as many others have.\nIf we consider the form of evidence that can be adduced\ntowards proof of spiritual survival, it has to be admitted, at\nthe outset, that it must be anthropomorphic. For there is no\nquestion of how the disembodied exist or what their form of\nexistence is : that cannot be known to us as subjects, it can\nonly be known to us as transcendent subjects. The question\nis of how the disembodied can prove to the embodied that\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1913.\nthey, the disembodied, continue in existence. So the evidence\noffered must be of such a nature that it appeals to the\nembodied : it must in its nature be anthropomorphic.\nNow for us, the embodied, what .do we know of one\nanother ? If I, for instance, could prove to any one of the\nCouncil of the S'.P.K. that I knew him or her down to the\nvery depths of personality : knew his or her secret thoughts,\nsecret desires and ambitions, knew in fact his or her secret\nlife of personality, which I affirm is of more importance to\nthe great majority of us personally than that part of our\npersonality known to the world, what would be the result ?\nI should be banned with horror ;\neven the picked men and\nwomen of the Council pass through life with their personalities\nonly manifest to their fellows in eating, drinking, talking and\nwriting on sublunary facts. A Marie Bashkirtseff or Benvenuto\nCellini is an abnormal human being. It is true there are\nsome human beings with the digestion of an ox and the skin\nof a rhinoceros who pass through life as mindlessly as a\nprimordial lump of protoplasm. But, for the great majority,\npersonality in its fullness is found in imagination : we live\nnot in the is but in the might be.\nThink for a moment : if you were faced by any one who\nknew you to the depth of your soul, would you not retreat\nin horror ? Ketreat, not in horror of revelation to others of\nevil in yourself, but in sheer horror of being faced by such\nabnormal knowledge.\nIf the above argument be sound, how then can the dis-\nembodied prove their continuance in existence to the embodied ?\nBy evidence of their past or present spiritual state ? No.\nFor that, even when the disembodied were on earth, was\nunknown to their fellows. How prove to a prisoner, who all\nthrough life has been imprisoned in a narrow cell, the glories\nof the open air ?\nThe only possible evidence of continuity any one of the\ndisembodied can offer to the embodied is evidence of the\nformer's past human life. And this evidence, too, must be\nof that part of his past human life which was manifest to\nhis fellows.\nWhat will be the nature of this evidence ? Concrete, simple\nfacts. We may, for analogy, consider the Tichborne case\n\fDec., 1913. Personal Survival: Form of Evidence. 159\nwhere the claimant tried to prove his personality as Tichboru<-.\nWhat was the form of evidence offered ? Of likeness in ab-\nstract personality ? No. Personality was attempted to be\nproved by the weight of knowledge of concrete facts. It\nwere more absurd for any one disembodied to try, by spiritual\nevidence, to prove to us evidentially his continued existence\nthan it would have been for Orton to try to prove he was\nTichborne by evidence that he had the same dreams and\nambitions.\nOne objection to the above line of argument must be met.\nThere are some who know, by personal experience, that the\ndisembodied survive in personality. But this experience is\npersonal : it is evidential in no way. Many of us are con-\nvinced in our inmost souls that we have had transcendent\ncommunication with the disembodied : but this experience is\nnot evidential ;\nit is of value only to the particular individual.\nPut yourself in a room alone, unseen, unheard by any one\noutside : assume you can only speak through the voice of\nanother. What would you say to prove your identity ?\nSpeak of your spiritual self ? Of your life of dreams ? No.\nYou would speak of simple, concrete facts of your life, which\nwould be likely to appeal to the anthropomorphic knowledge\nof your listener.\nThe question of the value of the evidence forthcoming from\ncross-correspondences is not now raised. All attempted is to\nshow that the argument preferred against the evidence because\nits form is simply that of puerile, concrete, anthropomorphic\nfacts, is bad. That form of evidence is the only evidence\navailable. Personal proof is transcendent of human thought .\nit is not evidential, has value only for the person concerned\nNOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nThe Archives de Psyrhologie. Number 50 (June 1913) of this\nvaluable periodical contains several matters of interest to psychical\nresearchers. (1) In Un Cas de Conviction Spontanee Dr. V. Demole\nrelates how one morning just after awaking he suddenly became\nconvinced that one of his patients in the hospital had died. He at\nonce took notes, and tried to analyse his state of mind. It turned\nout that the patient had died some hours before, and that the\nimpression was therefore apparently \"veridical.\" Dr. Demole,\n\f1GO Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec., 1913.\nhowever, proceeds to explain it by association of ideas and comparison\nwith another patient in the same ward in a very similar condition\nwho had died four days earlier. But, as Prof. Flournoy in his\ncomments on the case points out, this explanation ignores the\ndouble coincidence that Dr. Demole had never had such an experi-\nence before, and that his train of thought in this case conducted\nhim to a veridical conclusion, which he could not have known by\nnormal means. Hence Prof. Flournoy holds that the possibility that\ntelepathy or clairvoyance was involved cannot be excluded. (2)\nDr. Burnand tells a story of a nervous patient who saw a friend\nof hers who was in Russia coming out of a shop at Leysin and\ndisappearing when she tried to speak to him. Inquiries at the shop\nconfirmed the hallucinatory character of the apparition. She told\nthe doctor the same day, and he took notes. Two days later she\ntold him that her friend appeared to have had half his moustache\nshaved off, and it was found that she had mentioned this detail\nto her sister-in-law on the day of the apparition. On the next\nday the lady received a letter informing her that her friend had\nhad a boil on his lip, and that in consequence half his moustache\nhad been shaved off. (3) Dr. Dunant relates a souvenir of his\nchildhood current in his family. When 19 months old he was\napparently dying of bronchial pneumonia. On the morning of the\nnight the doctor had said he would not survive, he awoke and\nwhispered to his mother, \"Mamma, I have seen God.\" The mother\nasked, \"What was He like ?\n\"\n\"Very big and all white.\" \"What did\nHe say to you?\" \"He has cured me.\" He then fell asleep again,\nand when he awoke, the doctor found him free from fever, and\nconvalescing.\nF.

EVERARD FEILDING AND ALICE JOHNSON.\nIN the Journal for July, 1913, appeared a preliminary report\nby Sir Oliver Lodge of a case of telepathy, with the statement\nthat it was hoped to experiment further with the same subject\nand to present a further report to the Society.\nFurther experiments have been carried out ;\nbut the results\nare not sufficiently conclusive to justify anything in the nature\nof a decisive report, whether favourable or unfavourable to the\nclaims of this subject to telepathic faculty. The subject, a\ngirl of fourteen, whom, because it is not her name, we will\ncall \"Amy Joyce,\" spent a week from Oct. 18 to Oct. 25,\n1913, at E. F.'s house in London, her*\" -father, Mr. Joyce,\nbeing there also from Oct. 18th to 20th. She spent the next\nweek-end, Oct. 25th to 27th, with Mr. Baggally in Brighton.\nA large number of experiments were tried under conditions\nat first somewhat lax, but subsequently more stringent, but\nlittle or no evidence of telepathy was obtained, except in some\nof Mr. Baggally's experiments which are separately reported\nbelow.\nOne very definite conclusion was, however, reached by the\nexperimenters, namely, that in the experiments in question\nAmy Joyce habitually and very cleverly availed herself of any\nopportunity of normal vision which might present itself, and\nalso that she as habitually and as cleverly tried to conceal\nthe fact of her having done so.\nOne way of perceiving apparently hidden objects is, of course,\nthrough getting a view of their reflections. If a person who\nwears glasses holds some such object as a playing-card in\nsuch a position that the light from it, whether artificial or\n\fJAN., I!M. rtnt< Experiments in Thought-Transference. 165\ndaylight, falls on his glasses, another person facing him at a\ndistance of several feet can, if the angles are correct, easily\nsee its reflection in his glasses. All that is necessary is that\nthr\n\"\nagent\n\"\nshould have the light behind or above him. If\nthe angle is especially favourable, cards can be guessed by this\nMifiins in rapid succession; but even if it is not, and the\nguesser has to depend on casual movements of the\n\"\nagent's\n\"\nhead for catching the reflection, it is still possible to bring\noft\" successes in a much higher ratio than chance would\naccount for, and in a way very puzzling to any one who\ndoes not see how it is done.\nIt was evident, and Amy herself ultimately admitted it,\nthat she had discovered this method, and that she made use\n>f it whenever she could in guessing cards held by her father,\nwears thick glasses producing very clearly visible reflections,\nmcl who was not accustomed to guard against her seeing them.\nBut this was by no means the only method used by Amy\nin the course of our experiments. She appears in some\nlatters to be anything but an observant child, and, indeed, to\nso little interested in things in general as at first to put\nexperimenters off their guard in dealing with her. But a\nlittle experience shows that she is abnormally quick of vision\nind clever at seeing things without appearing to see them.\nAs already stated, the conditions of experimentation were\nit first somewhat lax. One of several persons in the room\nrould draw a diagram or picture, and Amy would try to\nguess it. This method was deliberately, and, as we now think,\nmistakenly, adopted at E. F.'s suggestion, in order to make\nthe proceedings seem like a game and not too much of an\nordeal for a child.\nIt followed, unfortunately, that as it was impossible strictly\nto control all the experimenters, the evidence for telepathy in\nthe successful cases was inadequate. There were not many\nsuccesses, and most of them occurred after several wrong\nguesses had been made and, the experiment being considered\nover, the drawing was carelessly held or laid down and for-\n)tten. It thus happened that chances were given Amy of\niing what the pictures were, and of these chances she very\nfully availed herself.\nA few successes, indeed, occurred when it was thought that\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN.,1914.\nthe precautions against normal vision were adequate, though\nthe proceedings were still somewhat informal in character.\nBut these successes were not numerous enough, nor was our\nconfidence in the precautions taken strong enough, to warrant\nany clear conclusions in favour of telepathy.\nStill more discouraging was it to observe that as the con-\nditions became more strict, the successes diminished. Amy\nshowed herself very unwilling to submit to the conditions\nproposed ;\nshe would not, for instance, sit still, but was con-\nstantly finding excuses to get up and walk about the room,\nwhich made it more difficult to keep the drawings hidden\nfrom her. After four days' experiments, during which a number\nof cases of cheating had been actually observed, besides those\nin which there was ground for suspecting cheating ;\nafter also\nit had been made abundantly clear that Amy was deliber-\nately and constantly trying to circumvent all precautions that\nwere taken against such cheating ;\nand after E. F. had carefully\nindicated to Amy his suspicions suspicions of which she then\nflatly denied the justification and begged her to amend her\nways ;\na single series of experiments, at which E. F. himself was\nnot present, were tried, in some of which opportunities were\npurposely given her for seeing the drawings used, whilst in\nothers they were carefully guarded, in order to see whether\nany correct impressions would be obtained otherwise than by\nnormal vision.\nWhen a drawing is held up with its back to an observer,\nthere are two possible ways of his seeing it :\n(a) by reflection,\nas mentioned above ; (b) by the transparency of the paper.\nMost white paper, though it looks opaque, can be seen through\nmore or less easily from behind if held up with a fairly\nbright light in front of it ;\nand it had been noticed several\ntimes that Amy had guessed a drawing inadvertently held up\nin this way with its back to her.\nTwo sets of drawings, accordingly, were used, one on white\npaper and the other on black paper, which is absolutely\nopaque to light rays. With these two sets a series of forty\nexperiments were tried under varying conditions. In some\ncases the paper, whether black or white, was completely\nscreened from Amy's view ;\nin other cases a drawing on\nblack paper was held up in such a way that, though ostensibly\n\f.j\\.\\., 1914. Some Experiment* i \/>\nThougJtirTransference.\nscreened, she could see the back of it; and in the remaining\ncases, a drawing on white paper was similarly held up.\nIn order to give a chance for telepathic percipience on her\npart, the persons chosen for agents were Mr. Baggally, who\nhad previously had some success with her, and Miss Newton,\nwho has sometimes been successful with other percipients. In\nthis series, not a single success was obtained except when the\nlira\nwings on white paper were held up so that she could see\nthrough them, and in almost every case she gave these correctly.\nWhen asked whether she could see anything of them, she\ndeclared positively that she could not. Later on, when E. R\nagain told her that we had found her cheating, she at first\ndenied it, but afterwards confessed that she had done so, and\nthat she had been in the habit of doing it for, she stated,\nabout a month before she came to London.\nSubsequently to this, yet another series of experiments was\nconducted by E. F. under the conditions which Amy said she\npreferred, namely, an informal gathering of many persons, each\nmaking drawings, with, however, careful supervision to ensure\nthat she could get no normal vision of any of these, and not\none single success was obtained.\nIn regard to the bearing of the London experiments on\nprevious ones, it is to be noted that Sir Oliver Lodge, in his\nown experiments recorded in the Journal for July, 1913,\nthought not only of spectacles, but even of the cornea as a\nreflecting agent, and he himself does not wear glasses, so that\nAmy's successes with him could not be due to her seeing\nreflections. He also, of course, guarded against other normal\nmeans of seeing, such as she contrived to use in the London\nexperiments, and nevertheless had a considerable amount of\nsuccess.\nThe history as a whole suggests that Amy had, and perhaps\nstill has, some genuine telepathic faculty ;\nbut that the desire\nto appear interesting and important, encouraged by the loose\nmethods of experimenting used in her own home, led to a habit\nof cheating and general untruthfulness, which probably tends to\ninhibit the telepathic power. In view, however, of the suc-\ncesses of Sir Oliver Lodge and Mr. Baggally, it is hoped that\nopportunities of further experiments with her may be found\nlater.\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1914.\nREPORT ON EXPERIMENTS WITH \"AMY JOYCE.\"\nBY W. W. BAGGALLY.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE sent me a preliminary Report of some\nexperiments in telepathy which he had tried with \"\nAmy\nJoyce,\" an account of which subsequently appeared in the\nJournal for July, 1913. I had an interview with Sir Oliver\nrespecting these experiments, and I expressed a wish to see\nthe child myself. Sir Oliver kindly wrote to her father who\nconsented that I should test his daughter's telepathic powers.\nI therefore on July 27, 1913, went to Mr. Joyce's house\nand stayed there two days. On Oct. 21, 1913, I paid a\nvisit to Mr. Feilding in London and remained at his house\nfour days while Amy Joyce was there. During this time I\npractically had charge of the girl, as Mr. Feilding, owing to\nbusiness engagements, was frequently absent from home. After\nmy visit to Mr. Feilding, I brought the girl to Brighton\nand she stayed in my home three days. I therefore had a\ngood opportunity of studying her character, and of trying\nexperiments with her. I found that she took every opportunity\nof gaining knowledge of the object experimented with by normal\nmeans, such as by reflection from the surface of spectacles\nworn by the agent (as when her father tried the experiments\nwhich I witnessed), or from the surface of the glass of a window\nbehind the agent, or from any reflecting surface ;\nor by a rapid\nglance at the number, diagram, or card used for the experiment,\nwhen such number, diagram or card, was momentarily visible\nto her through being inadvertently held partly sideways by the\nagent, or through being placed on the table at the con-\nclusion of an experiment (in which case Amy would, apparently,\nget a good result in\n\"\ndeferred telepathy \") ;\nor through\nthe number, diagram, or nature of the card being seen trans-\nparently when the agent sat with his back to a window through\nwhich light was shining.\nNotwithstanding that in many of the experiments that I\nwitnessed the girl resorted to the above means of gaining\nnormal knowledge of the object experimented with, I am of\nopinion that in some experiments which I personally conducted,\nand in which I took precautions that she should not be able\nto resort to the above methods, there were indications that\n\fJAN., 1914.\nReport on Experiments with \"Amy Juf\/<'<.\nshe possessed telepathic powers. I may say that I do not\nwear spectacles, and that in some of my experiments I wore\na felt hat which covered my eyes, so that there should not be\nany reflection in the cornea of my eyes. I also took the\nprecaution, when trying experiments with cards, that the whole\npack should be behind the card chosen by me so that it\ncould not be seen transparently ;\nand I took care that no\nwindow or reflecting surface should be behind me. The cards\nthat I used (my own pack) were exceptionally thick, so that\ntheir nature could not be seen transparently.\nI will proceed to give an account of some of my experi-\nments. On the occasion which I now describe, and which took\nplace at Mr. Feilding's house on Oct. 23, 1913, Amy sat at\none end of the room and I at the other. Mr. Murray Davey,\na friend of Mr. Feilding's, who had not met Amy before, sat at\nthe other side of the room from me, but not close to her.\nNeither he nor Amy could see my cards. The day was dark ;\nthe window of the room was on my right side (not behind me);\nI held the pack of cards close to me ;\ntherefore each of the\ncards in front of the pack with which I experimented was\nbadly illumined.\nThe whole series of experiments with cards tried by me on\nthis occasion was as follows :\nCards chosen\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JAN., 1914.\nI here asked Mr. Murray Davey to try to impress Amy\nsimultaneously with me. The card was chosen by me and\nheld by me, Mr. Murray Davey coming to my side to look\nat it, with the following results :\nCard chosen\n\fJAK., 1914. Report on Experiment* with \"Amy Joyce.\" 171\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1914.\nshe had hit on two of the numbers, but I did nob tell\nher which they were, nor in what position. The gradual\napproach to correctness in her guesses seemed to me\ncurious ;\nher last figure, 6, had some resemblance to my\nlast figure, 0.\n(2) I then asked her to go into the dining-room, while I\nremained in the drawing-room. Under these conditions,\nwhile she was out of sight :\nI wrote down the number 333 ; Amy guessed (a) 94*7 ;\n(&) 642.\n(3) Under the same conditions as above :\nI wrote down the number 532 ; Amy guessed 432.\nThen she called out from the dining-room that she found\nthe experiment difficult under these conditions, and returned to\nthe drawing-room.\nThe following experiments with numbers, which I carried\nout in Mr. Feilding's house, appear to indicate deferred tele-\npathy. Amy had asked me previously the number of digits I\nwas to experiment with. I replied, one digit. Lucky chance\nguessing cannot therefore be eliminated. A deferred success\nfor purposes of chance calculation was in this case equivalent\nto a second guess, i.e. it gave a double chance of guessing\nright. The double chance was 2 in 9, whereas we have here\n3 successes in 6. The result, to say the least, was curious.\nI drew the numbers in a thick pocket-book held vertically\nwith its back to Amy, taking care that the movement of my\nhand should not indicate what I was drawing. There were\nno reflecting surfaces behind me, and the girl was on one\nside of the room and I on the other.\nNumbers drawn\n\fJAN., 1914. Report on Experiment* with \"\nAmy Joyce\" I.-!\ndrawn at my house in Brighton a series of numbers of several\ndigits in a pocket-book which I kept in my breast-pocket.\nThe leaf on which I had drawn the numbers was folded over\nseveral times, so that if, by mischance, I should open the\npocket-book at this page in the presence of any one close to\nme, the numbers could not be seen.\nI asked Amy if she could get one of the numbers which\nI had written in this pocket-book. She said she would try.\nI thereupon retired to a distance from her, unfolded the page\nwith the numbers, and told her I had chosen one. She\nasked me the number of digits. I replied, three. I took care\nthat the book was held by me so that it was not possible\nfor her to see what the number was, and there was na\nreflecting surface behind me. The window of the room (the\ndining-room) was behind her.\nThe number I looked at and which I endeavoured to\nimpress telepathically on her was 681.\nShe asked,\n\"\nDoes it start with 5 ? Does it start with\n1 ?\n\"\nI said to her that she was not trying the experiment\nproperly, but merely guessing. She then said she would try\nto get the number by deferred telepathy. I then put the\npocket-book in my breast-pocket, where it remained, and we\nproceeded to try other experiments.\nIn about an hour's time, Amy said the number I had\nchosen was 684, then that it was 681.\nAs the pocket-book had remained the whole time in my\npocket, I am of opinion that this was a case of genuine\ntelepathy. I think it desirable that further experiments should\nbe carried out with Amy Joyce.\ni\nNOTE ON THE EXPERIMENTS WITH \"AMY JOYCE.\"\nBY J. ARTHUR HILL.\nMY knowledge of the \"Amy Joyce\" case began in March, 1913,\nwhen I replied on Sir Oliver Lodge's behalf to a letter sent\nhim by Mr. Joyce, describing his daughter's apparent powers.\nA good deal of correspondence resulted, and on April 5, 1913,\nmy friend, Mr. Percy Lund, kindly went to the Joyces', at their\ninvitation, for an afternoon's experimentation. Before going,\nhe discussed with me various evidential requirements, and I\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1914.\nparticularly emphasized the possibilities of reflections of various\nkinds, which of course may be observed subliminally and\nwithout any conscious attempt at deception on the part of the\npercipient.\nMr. Lurid found that Mr. Joyce wore spectacles, in which\nreflections were visible ;\nand he demonstrated this to Mr.\nJoyce by\n\"\nguessing\" several cards held by the latter, to his\ngreat astonishment. (Amy, however, continued to do equally\nwell when Mr. Joyce took his glasses off.) Mr. Lund found\nthat he could see enough of the reflections, from a distance-\nof a few feet, to enable him to name about three out of four\ncorrectly. He explained this to Mr. Joyce, who, however,\napparently forgot about it before the London experiments\nbegan.\nMr. Lund (who does not wear glasses) found that Amy\ncorrectly named cards held by himself, and not seen by\nMr. Joyce, to an extent far beyond what chance would account\nfor ;\nsometimes she would name six or seven successively,\nwith the greatest rapidity ;\nthen she would seem at a loss, the\npower coming in bursts, so to speak. She was also extremely\nsuccessful in reproducing drawings a square, a circle, a\nsix-pointed star, a Maltese and an ordinary cross, and a triangle\nwhich he drew at one end of the room, while she remained\nat the other. He is quite sure that she had no normal\nvision either of the drawings or of the movements of his hand,\neither directly or in reflections. To him, therefore, these\nreproductions, added to those card-readings which were done\nunder good conditions, with his own pack of cards, seemed\nconclusive evidence for some supernormal faculty on the\npart of Amy Joyce.\nMr. Lund's report, from which I copy most of the above\ndetails, was sent to Sir Oliver Lodge, and I also informed him\nfully of what Mr. Lund told me verbally about the reflections.\nTo this statement Mr. Lund adds the following note :\n\"\nThe above, so far as it concerns me, is correct.\"\n(Signed) PERCY LUND.\n57 Southfield Square, Manningham, Bradford.\n[Note. It was subsequent to receiving this information\nthat Sir Oliver Lodge went to for his interview with\n\fJAN., UU4. Note on Experiments with \"Amy Joyce\" 175\nMi. Joyce and the child. I have seen a letter from Mr. Hill\nto Sir Oliver, dated April 29, 1913, in which he explains the\nprecautions taken by Mr. Lund against reflections, as stated\nabove. It was on May 17, 1913, that Sir Oliver Lodge\nconducted his experiments at ,\nas reported in the July\nJournal. He is satisfied that successes were obtained without\nnormal seeing of any kind. A. J.]\nOBITUAKV.\nTHE REV. J. W. BARLOW, S.F. T.C.D.\nWE regret that, owing to the intervention of the summer\nholidays, a notice of the death of a distinguished member of our\nSociety, the Rev. J. W. Barlow, Senior Fellow of Trinity College,\nDublin, has not hitherto appeared in the Journal. James\nWilliam Barlow was born October 21, 1826, and died\nJuly 4, 1913; he became a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin,\nin 1850, and was Vice-Provost at the time of his resignation\nin 1908. His earliest studies were chiefly mathematical, and\nSir William Rowan Hamilton taught him his famous theory of\nquaternions ;\nbut he was widely read in both Ancient and\nModern Literature, and deeply interested in various branches of\nScience. The range and depth of his knowledge were indeed\nprodigious, and it is no small tribute to the work of Psychical\nResearch that so profound and acute a thinker should have\nbecome a warm adherent of our Society ; nearly twenty years ago\nhe became a member, and was elected the h'rst Vice-President\nof the Dublin section of the S.P.R., a position he retained to\nthe time of his death. In this he was warmly supported by\nhis distinguished daughter, Miss Jane Barlow, D.Litt., whose\nliterary eminence is so widely recognized. Mr. Myers's great\nwork on Human Personality deeply impressed Mr. Barlow, and\nhe brought it under the notice of Dr. J. P. Mahaffy, who\nincluded a considerable portion of this work in the Dublin\nUniversity Fellowship Course the earliest official recognition by a\nfamous, and indeed conservative, University of Psychical Research\nas a branch of science. In this connection we may here record\nthe interesting fact that Dr. J. P. Mahafty, S.F. T.C.D., the present\nVice-Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, has consented to take\nMr. Barlow's place as Vice-President of the Dublin section of\nour Society.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1914.\nFor many years Professor Barlow occupied the chair of\nModern History in the University of Dublin, and he published\nseveral philosophical and historical works. Among others\nwere his lectures on Mediaeval Italy and The Normans in\nItaly, and a brilliant and learned work on The Ultimatum of\nPessimism, an ethical study which is widely known. Earlier\nin life he incurred much ecclesiastical censure for his fearless\nadvocacy of broader theological views. His volume on Escha-\ntology, published in 1865, excited much controversy at the time\nfor its bold denial of the current, and as he maintained, unscrip-\ntural doctrine of eternal punishment. His latest work was a\nremarkable little philosophical romance called The Immortal's\nQuest, at first printed for private circulation, but afterwards\npublished with the author's name.\nLike Edmund Gurney in his wide range of learning, Mr.\nBarlow also resembled Gurney in his fondness for music, and\nfound his chief recreation in the organ, on which he was a\nskilful performer, enjoying especially Handel's music.\nIt would be a great gain to Psychical Eesearch if Miss Jane\nBarlow, who is a valued member of our Committee of Refer-\nence and Publication, and who had the most intimate knowledge\nof her father's views, were to give us the results of the\ncritical study which both she and her father made of the\nProceedings of our Society.\nW. F. B.\nSIR OLIVER LODGE'S PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS\nTO THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.\nWE think that many of our members may like to know\nthat Sir Oliver Lodge's Presidential Address, selections from\nwhich appeared in the Journal for November, 1913, has now\nbeen published in full by Messrs.

It caught tire in mid-Atlantic at about 6.30 on\nThursday morning, October 9, 1913, and three explosions\nshortly followed. Wireless messages sent out for help were\nreceived by the Cunard liner\n\"\nCarmania\n\"\nat 10 A.M. on\nThursday. The \"\nCarmania,\" steaming at full speed to the\nscene, arrived at 2.30 P.M., and put out a boat, which tried\nin vain for two hours to get alongside of the\n\"\nVolturno,\"\nbeing prevented by the gale and terrific sea. The \"\nVolturno\n\"\nhad already lowered two boats, carrying about 100 passengers,\nwhich had been lost. Later in the afternoon other liners who\nhad received the wireless calls arrived, and also made a\nnumber of vain attempts, by putting off boats, to rescue the\npassengers. At about 9 P.M. the flames on the\n\"\nVolturno\n\"\nburst through amidships and there was another big explosion.\nThe fire went on raging all through the night, several members\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1914.\nof the crew being, as was stated in the first reports, burnt\nalive. Fortunately the gale gradually went down, and early\nin the morning of Friday it became possible for the ships\nwhich had been standing by all night to launch their boats\nagain and take off the survivors. The \"\nVolturno\n\"\nwas aban-\ndoned at 10.44 A.M. on Friday. Some of the earlier messages\nstated that as many as 80 or 90 persons had been burnt\nalive ;\nbut this was clearly a great exaggeration, since the\ntotal death-roll was about 136, of whom it seems probable\nthat at least 100 were drowned. At the Board of Trade\nenquiry, it was said that four men were burnt in the fore-\ncastle.\nThe disaster took place in lat. 4 8 '2 5, long. 34'33. The\ntime at this longitude is about 2 hrs. 20 mins. earlier than\nGreenwich time.\nThe news was sent to England by wireless messages, which\nreached the station at Fishguard at 5.50 A.M.1\non Saturday,\nOctober 11, was re-telegraphed over the Post Office wires to\nthe G.P.O., and then sent to the press. Consequently it was\nnot received in time to appear in any of the morning papers,\nbut appeared first in the early afternoon papers of October 11,\n1913.\nIt happened that on the evening of Thursday, October 9,\nMrs. Claude Askew, who is an Associate of the S.P.E., was\nhaving a seance with some friends who were staying at\nher house, and two days later she wrote to Mr. Feilding as\nfollows :\nBOTCHES, WIVELSFIELD GREEN,\nHAYWARDS HEATH, October llth, [1913].\n. . . Last Thursday night Miss Watson, Miss Scott, Miss Gibbons,\nClaude, and myself sat in my bedroom. We had a most interesting\nseance. Knocks came freely, also a loud whistle, and feet could be\nseen passing outside the door; in fact, the whole seance was so\ngood that we all arranged to meet here again on Saturday week\nand ask you down. But in the middle of the seance a strange\nthing happened ;\nwe heard the sound of dripping water, followed\nby the smell of burning. We can all swear to this, and Miss Scott\nsuddenly exclaimed that a ship was burning on the sea, and pas-\nsengers getting burnt and drowned. This we can all testify to.\nJ\nSee The Evening News of Saturday, Oct. 11, 1913.\n\fi KI , 1914.\nTelepathic Impression of\" Voltumo\" Disaster.

The more I think over our experience of Thursday night,\nthe more impressed I feel. It was really most extraordinary, wasn't\nFirst of all the manifestations had never been so loud or so\nviolent, [or] so distinct; also the sound of dripping water was un-\nlistakeable, and the smell of burning was so bad that we really\nlought there must be something on fire downstairs ;\nthe whole\n>om was full of it.

She declared\nthat she could see hands stretched out imploring help, and at last\nre all cried out that the smell was like that of burning flesh, and\nre felt quite sick, I can assure you. ... It was profoundly in-\nteresting at the time, but now it seems simply extraordinary, for\nist at the time that Miss Scott was exclaiming that a ship was\nm fire and people being drowned, the unfortunate people must\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1914.\nhave been flinging themselves into the water. We sat from half\npast nine till about ten minutes past twelve. . . .\nMr. Feilding then sent a series of questions to Mrs. Askew,\nasking that she and Mr. Askew should write answers to\nthem without comparing notes, and send him their independent\nstatements. In accordance with this request, they wrote to\nhim :\n(Statement by Mrs. Askew.)\nOctober 16th, 1913.\n(1) As far as I can recollect, I was the first person to detect a\ndisagreeable smell in the room in which we were all sitting Miss\nWatson, Miss Jose Scott, Miss Beryl Gibbons, myself and my\nhusband. As the smell grew stronger we all decided that it was\nunquestionably the smell of something burning. It appeared to be\nall over the room, and it was so acute that we decided in the\nmiddle of the seance that before going to bed my husband must\nmake a thorough investigation in the rooms downstairs, in case\nanything should be on fire.\n(2) I heard a curious little sound like the loud ticking of a watch\nfirst of all, and called the attention of the sitters to the sound, and\npresently the sound seemed to grow louder and was like the\ndripping of water. We all heard this.\n(3) The sounds which appeared to be abnormal which we heard\nduring the seance came in the following order. A loud pop which\nsounded like a cork going off. But this might have been a bottle\nexploding, for I afterwards found a shattered bottle in my bathroom,\nbut the cork was still in the bottle, it had only fallen to the ground.\nA distinct and heavy crash downstairs in the kitchen (no servants\nwere there, for they had all gone to bed) a crash which was not\nunlike a heavy clap of thunder; also a loud whistle. Various raps,\nmore or less distinct, in various parts of the room, also on the\ntable. Curious floating lights, the apparent appearance of a small\ndog, the heavy shaking of the folds of a cover on a sofa, this was\nobserved several times by Miss Jose Scott and myself. Feet were\ndistinctly seen under the chink of the door, passing backwards and\nforwards outside. We also heard the sound of some one coming\nheavily upstairs and entering my husband's dressing-room, at a time\nwhen he himself was downstairs. This we all heard, and Miss\nBeryl Gibbons got up from her seat and walked into my husband's\ndressing-room to see if he was there, but found no one. In the\n\f1914.\nTelepathic Impression of\" Volturno\" Disaster. l>sl\nmiddle of the seance I left the circle and walked down a long\npassage to enquire how a friend of ours was who was sleeping in\nthe house, and as I came back I could distinctly hear footsteps\nfollowing me, and I also smelt the smell of burning more acutely\nthan ever. When I entered the room in which we were sitting,\nMiss Beryl Gibbons told me that she thought she saw some one\nstanding behind me, a tali figure dressed in black. During the\nwhole of the seance I was conscious, for my part, of the acute\nsmell of burning and the sound of dripping water.\n(4) During the middle of the stance Miss Jose' Scott suddenly\nexclaimed with great agitation that she was convinced that a ship\nwas on fire and that a number of people were being drowned.\nShe said she could see hands held up the hands of drowning\npeople. The smell of burning was peculiarly strong in the room\nwhilst she said this, and so was the sound of the lapping water,\nand she repeated the statement again a little later on, asserting that\nshe was positive that a ship was on fire at that very moment and\nthat we should soon hear of some colossal disaster at sea. No state-\nment could have been made more positively. There was no hesitation\nabout it; Miss Jos6 Scott affirmed it as a fact.\n(5) We sat from half past ten at night till about a quarter past\ntwelve. ALICE ASKEW.\n(Statement by Mr. Askew.)\nBOTCHES, WIVELSFIELD GREEN,\nSUSSEX, October 16th, 1913.\nHere are my answers to the questions you put. It was certainly\na curious experience, as I take it the ship was burning all that\nThursday night, and Miss Scott certainly did foretell a disaster at\nsea by fire and drowning. I am not so sure that Alice spoke of a\nship, but she smelt the burning and heard the water. They were\nall agreed as to the burning and the water, except myself, who did\nnot get either of these impressions. The whistle I have spoken\n>ut was really rather curious, as it sounded in the room, and at\nthat time of night there was nobody about to make such a noise.\nHowever, of course, that is a detail in comparison to the fore-\ntelling of the wreck !\n(1) and (2) Personally, I cannot say that I either smelt burning\nor heard the dripping of water. I think Alice and Miss Scott were\nthe first to refer to these sensations. They said it was 'something\nnasty\n'\nburning. I suggested that what they took for the dripping\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1914.\nof water was the noise of the petrol air-gas machine, but they said\nit was something quite different. So strong was the impression of\nburning that I was requested to go round the house to see that\nthere was nothing amiss. I did so, and found nothing to account\nfor any smell of burning.\n(3) The impression of water and burning went on more or less\nall the while we were sitting, and other things happened in the\nintervals of remarks upon these two subjects. The table was very\nactive, and we got some fairly well-defined knocks. We asked for\nmanifestations apart from the table and were asked to wait, sitting\nquietly. We did so, and presently there came a sound like a cork\nbeing blown out of a bottle : it seemed to come from the yard and\nI believe it was a normal sound, though I failed to find any cause\nfor it on a later inspection of the kitchen, etc. We then asked for\nanother manifestation, and after a minute or two several of us,\nmyself included, distinctly heard a light whistle, which seemed to\ncome from somewhere within the room. I thought this curious, and\nwe could not account for it. Another thing was that I heard the\nticking of a watch on the dressing table, though there was no watch\nthere. When I sat upright at the seance table I could no longer\nhear it. I was wearing a watch on my left wrist, but the sound\ncame when I leaned far over to the right. The whistle, however,\nwas certainly the most curious impression that I personally received.\n(4) I think Miss Scott was the first to speak of a ship on fire;\nmy wife may have done so as well. They both agreed they could\nsee people drowning, \"the tips of their fingers sticking out of the\nwater.\" Then Miss Scott said :\n\"\nWe shall hear of a disaster at sea.\"\nI am certain that she made use of words to this effect, and that she\nimplied the disaster would be through fire and water. . . .\nOther sitters may have had other impressions, but these are all\nthat I can personally answer for. CLAUDE ASKEW.\nIn answer to further questions from Miss Johnson, in par-\nticular whether any incident had ever happened before at any\nof their sittings which they thought at the time, or had\nreason to think afterwards, was connected with any contem-\nporary event, Mrs. Askew wrote :\nOctober 20, 1913.\nAll the ladies who sat with us on Thursday night were personal\nfriends of mine ;\nit was the first time Miss Beryl Gibbons had ever\nsat at a seance. We have no particular form of procedure at any\n\fan\nwi\nAl\nKKI; ,\np.m. Ti'lt\n\/mthic Impression of\" Volturno\" Disaster.\nof the seances we have at home. We just sit round a small table,\njoining hands. Sometimes there is a light in the room, sometimes\nthere is no light.\nWe have never before had reason to think that any incident\nhappening at our seances has been connected with some contem-\nporary event.\nOn the evening of Thursday, October 9th, we were sitting in my\nbedroom, and there was a fire in the room, so we were not in the\ndark. I may as well add here, in case any one should fancy that\nthe smell of burning came from the fire, that when we entered the\nroom at the beginning of the seance and proceeded to take our\nplaces round the table, there was no smell of burning of any sort\nin the room, nor did we smell burning for at least a quarter of an\nhour, and nothing was put on the fire from the beginning of the\n2ance till the end.\nThe door of my bedroom is a very old-fashioned one, for Botches\nwas originally a sixteenth century farmhouse, which we have very\nmuch enlarged and built on to, and there is quite a wide chink at\nthe bottom of the door. My husband was not in the room during\nthe time we all saw the feet passing backwards and forwards. He\nhad gone downstairs to see if there was anything on fire that might\npossibly account for the strong smell of burning, or if any of our\nold beams were smouldering, and Miss Gibbons got up and opened\nthe door to see if any person was walking about, but found no\none.\nThe friend who was sleeping in the house does not walk in his\nsleep. He was awake during the earlier part of the seance reading,\nand when I went to his room to ask him if he had heard any\nsounds I found him fast asleep. The servants sleeping in the house\nwere my maid, our cook and kitchenmaid, the housemaid and parlour-\nmaid. My maid sleeps in the room next to my small daughter, and\nthe other servants sleep upstairs. It would have been impossible for\ny of the servants sleeping upstairs to have descended the stairs\nwithout our hearing them, for the staircase is\nvery old and creaky.\nAlso my parlourmaid, who has been with me for over eleven years,\nassures me that no one left their bedrooms. All the servants were\nexceedingly tired, owing to the fact that we had been having a\nlarge party the night before, and they had no reason to suppose\nthat we were sitting that night. My maid could not have left her\nroom without our hearing her, and my little daughter, who is a very\nlight sleeper, would have woke up at once. My maid has been with\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1914.\nus for over twelve years, and she is a person in whom one can place\nthe utmost reliance.\nAs far as I know, none of our party had ever been in a shipping\naccident or taken any interest in such, nor had we any friends or\nrelatives upon the seas. The question of a voyage had not been\nmentioned that evening by any one, as far as I can remember, nor\nhad we been discussing accidents or shipwrecks. Till we went up\nto sit in my bedroom we were talking principally about the enter-\ntainment we had given the night before in aid of the funds of the\nVillage Hall, which has recently been erected in Wivelsfield village,\nand the party at our house that had followed the entertainment on\nWednesday evening, so our thoughts had been directed the whole\nof that evening far from shipwrecks or any sort of calamity. We\nhad been laughing over the various incidents connected with the\nentertainment.\nALICE ASKEW.\nMr. Feilding's questions had meanwhile been sent to Miss\nGibbons, who wrote to him as follows :\nOctober 17th, [1913].\nI will try and write exactly what happened at the seance we had\nat the As\"kews' last Thursday night. I don't think any one smelt\nburning for about half an hour after we started sitting, then Mrs.\nAskew asked us if we noticed it, and we all had ;\nit was not an\nordinary burning smell, but very strong and disagreeable ;\nat least,\nI thought so. I couldn't say where it came from, but it seemed\nstrongest in the Askews' room, although it was quite noticeable in\nthe passage outside.\nI don't remember who first heard the water running ;\nit sounded\nlike a river to me, not water dripping. Sometimes it seemed quite\nloud and then almost died away. I don't know where it came\nfrom; it was all over the Askews' room, but I didn't hear it\noutside.\nWe all heard it, and felt gusts of cold air, and several times I\nfelt something touch my neck and hands. The table kept tapping;\nso we asked for some outward sign, which it tapped it would give\nus. We waited for about a minute and there was a noise outside\nlike a bottle bursting, and a door downstairs slammed. There was\nno bottle outside and all the servants had gone to bed. We asked\nfor another sign, and about a minute afterwards we all heard two\ndistinct whistles, which seemed to come from the fireplace. After\n\finn.

Then we turned\nthe lights on and waited for Mr. Askew, whom we thought we\nheard coming upstairs twice before he really did. When he did\ncome we sat again, and Miss Scott went off into a trance ; when\nshe came round she said, \"There is a ship burning, and people are\nholding out their hands for help.\" She said she could see the\nhands over the Askews' bed, but while she was in the trance she\nnever spoke.\nAfter that we ended, and Mr. and Mrs. Askew went downstairs\nto fetch drinks and biscuits. Again we heard footsteps coming\nupstairs twice before they really came. When Mrs. Askew walked\nupstairs, I was standing at her door, and I distinctly saw [some one]\nwhom I thought to be her maid ;\nin fact, I was just going to speak\nto her, but there was no one there. . . . BERYL GIBBONS.\nIn reply to a request from Mr. Feilding, Miss Scott sent\nhim the following account, adding\n\"\nHere is my account as\naccurately as I can remember, but the fire scene took up my\nattention so much that I cannot be certain that everything\nelse is in its right order.\"\nIARDELEY\nBURY, STEVENAGE,\nMonday, Oct. 20th [1913].\nccount of Stance at Botches on Thursday night, Oct. 9th [1913]\nThe seance took place in Mrs. Askew's bedroom between about 11\nand 1 on Thursday night. There were five of us Mrs. Askew,\nMiss Watson, Miss Gibbons, Mr. Askew and myself. We used a\nsmall round table to start things with, and very quickly got it\nmoving. It said it had a message for Miss Gibbons, and then gave\n\"\nWarning Low \"\nand refused to continue. I think we all felt very\nstrong currents of icy air, though a fire was burning directly behind us.\nMiss Watson then said she noticed a strong smell of burning, and\nwe all did too. It became stronger, and I said it was burning paint\nand wood the same smell that I had once before smelt, when I\nhad been by a burnt stable and cottage the smell of burning human\nbelongings. I can't describe it better than that. Then I heard\nwater, most distinctly, and the others heard it, though no two of\nheard it in the same way. One said it was water dripping,\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB.,1914.\nanother rushing like a river, and Miss Watson said that she thought\nperhaps the house had once been burned and we heard the water\npoured on to it. I did not hear it like that, however; I heard the\nsea, very stormy, beating against something, ceaselessly, and I said\nso. I think I said then that it was a ship on fire in a storm.\nMeanwhile the table began moving again, and it promised to give\nus a definite manifestation that we could all hear outside the room,\nbefore midnight. At two minutes to 12 we all heard a loud report\nmore like a very large cork being drawn out of a very large\nbottle than anything. Then four of us heard a short loud peal of\nthunder, and three of them heard a low distinct whistle, two\nshort sounds, they said.\nThe smell of burning had become so strong that Mr. Askew went\ndown to see if anything was burning. He was away some minutes,\nthe lights being full on in the room meanwhile. We all heard\nsteps coming upstairs twice, and thought it was him returning, but\nat neither time did he come. Then Mrs. Askew went out of the\nroom to take one of the dogs away for the night.\nWhen we heard her coming back Miss Gibbons went to the door\nto see if it really was some one this time, and saw Mrs. Askew\ncoming, followed by a tall woman in black. Thinking it was Mrs.\nAskew's maid, she was about to speak to her, when she realised\nthat no one was really there except Mrs. Askew. Mr. Askew then\n<:ame back, and we sat round the table again. I don't remember\nmuch of what happened then, as I think I went into a short\ntrance, or sleep. Anyway, I had a very vivid impression of a\nburning ship in a storm, and a great crowd of people, all stretching\nout their hands for help. And I knew that there was help near,\nthough for some reason or other it could not reach them. I think\nI described this quite fully to them ;\nand evidently insisted on the\nhands stretched out for help, because Miss Watson kept saying :\n\" How horrible ! Don't go on saying that.\" All the time I saw\nfire, and heard the sea dashing against the ship, and I saw hands\neverywhere, especially vividly. I don't remember much else, except\nthat before we broke up I said :\n\" I am quite certain that we shall\nhear of a burning ship, and great loss of life during the next few\ndays.\"\nI went to London on Friday; and on Saturday morning I went\nout in a great hurry, not having seen the paper, and saw on a\nnewsboard outside Baron's Court Station :\n\"\nLiner on fire in storm.\nGreat loss of life.\"\n\fFKI:., 1914.\nTelepathic Impression of\" Voltumo\" Disaster. 187\nI was on my way to Waterloo then, and I wired to Mrs. Askew\nat about 1 o'clock, just before my train left :\n\"\nReported liner on\nfire. Loss of life. Remember seance. Jose.\"\nI think this is correct in the main facts, though I may have put\nthe details in the wrong order; but latterly I did not notice\nmuch ;\nthe smell of burning, the dashing of waves, and the hands\nasking for help filled my attention completely, and the trance made\nme very sleepy. JOSEPHINE SCOTT.\nP.S. We all saw lights at various times, but there was a fire\nin the room, though very low burning.\nI wired to Mrs. Askew about the fire, because I saw the placard\non an Evening News board, and not having seen the morning paper, did\nnot realise that it would have been in that. 1\nI thought it had only\njust been wired in. I know about the Evening News, because I\nknow the man who held the board well, and he is the man who\nsells only the Evening News.\nThe remaining witness, Miss Watson, gave a detailed verbal\naccount of the stance to Miss Johnson and Mr. Feilding on\nthe morning of October 19, 1913, and afterwards wrote it\nout, as follows :\nLYCEUM CLUB, November 20th, 1913.\nt(The\nfollowing is based on notes taken down in shorthand by\ne Hon. Everard Feilding's secretary, on October 19th, when the\nstory of the seance was being narrated by me to Miss Johnson\nand Mr. Feilding. I am not certain as to the exact sequence of\nthe events.)\nOn October 9th [1913] I was staying with Mr. and Mrs. Claude\nAskew in their house at Wivelsfield Green. It was suggested that\nwe should try and hold a seance. As nearly as I can remember,\nat about 11 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Askew, Miss Scott, Miss Gibbons,\nand I went into Mrs. Askew's bedroom, and sat round, with our\nhands on, a small table. There was a fire in the room but no\nother light. The fire was low.\nShortly after we sat down the table started tilting. Mr. Askew\nasked if there was a message for any one present, and spelt the\nalphabet. I think the table replied by tilts that the message was\nfor Miss Gibbons, but the letters which followed did not seem to\nspell any sense, so Mr. Askew ceased saying the alphabet.\n*As a matter of fact, the first news appeared in the evening papers of that\nday. ED.\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1914.\nPresently there was a strong and most disagreeable smell of burn-\ning in the room. I believe I was the first person who noticed and\nmentioned it. Then there came a distinct sound of water ;\nto me it\nsounded like water continually dripping. I think we all smelt the\nburning and heard the water. Mr. Askew suggested the latter\nmight be the noise of the petrol gas. The rest of us did not agree,,\nbut said we would listen to the gas when the seance was over and\nsee if the noise was the same, which we did, and all agreed that\nit was utterly different.\nThere came flashes of light in the room ;\nthose which I saw were\nagainst the door, and appeared as if a candle or a match with\na very long flame had suddenly been lit. I should think the\nstreaks of light were about 2 ft. in length ; they were not per-\npendicular, but horizontal, going across the door. I had my back\nto the fire, so each time I saw the flash I turned to see if it\ncould be the fire flickering, but it was not, the fire was very low,\nalmost embers. Mr. Askew had his back to the door, and I am\nnot sure that he saw any lights. The others did, but I do not\nthink we all saw the same lights, or at the same time, as we\nexclaimed at different times and did not describe what we were\nseeing in exactly the same way.\nI also saw a different sort of light upon the wall, but I am not\nsure that this was not a reflection from the gas in the passage\noutside coming through the crack under the door. It was impossible\nthat the lights which I have described above could have been this,\nas I saw them upon the door.\nThe smell of burning became stronger. I said it smelt like\nburnt leather, when Miss Scott suddenly exclaimed,\n\"\nIt's nothing\nof the sort, it is\nburning flesh, it is a ship on fire at sea; I\ncan see the whole thing, and the people holding up their hands\ntrying to be saved.\" She asked Mrs. Askew to look towards the\nend of the bed and see if she could not also see it. Mrs. Askew\nlooked, but I do not think saw anything. From that moment\nMiss Scott persisted that she saw a ship on fire, and that was the\ncause of the burning and the sound of the water. She said she\nwas certain we would hear of a liner being on fire. At last I\nbegged her to desist, it was becoming so horrible.\nThe table had been tilting and rapping, but nothing further.\nMr. Askew asked if we could have some other phenomenon. It\nanswered \" Yes\n\"\n(by three tilts) ;\nit was asked where this would\ntake place, and I think it answered, \"Outside.\" It was asked\n\fFEB., ion. Telepathic Impression of\" Volturno\" Disaster. 1 v.\nwhether it wished us to change our conditions of sitting, and it\nreplied that it wished us to take our hands off the table. These\nreplies were given in answer to suggestions from Mr. Askew.\nImmediately we had removed our hands there was a kud bang\njust outside the window ;\nit sounded as if a champagne cork had\nflown out of a bottle. Shortly after there was another more\ndistant noise, as if\nsomething had stumbled or fallen in another\npart of the house.\nThe smell of the burning was so vivid, it was decided we had\nbetter leave oft* the seance, while Mr. Askew went downstairs to\ndiscover if\nanything was on fire, and also if there was any reason\nfor the noise.\nThe lights were then turned on in the room ;\nthe door was wide\nopen, and there was a light in the passage outside. While Mr.\nAskew was downstairs we distinctly heard some one or something\nin the passage; we thought it was Mr. Askew returning, but when\nwe went to look he was not there. We heard the noise twice.\nMrs. Askew went out of the room to see if all was well, and on\nher return she said something had followed her down the passage,\nand Miss Gibbons said she saw a dark figure come into the room\nafter Mrs. Askew. Mr. Askew was still downstairs, and every one\n^Ise in the house was in bed.\nWe turned out the lights and again sat, with a repetition of\nwhat we had had before, the smell of burning, sound of water,\nlights, etc. Mrs. Askew, Miss Scott, and Miss Gibbons all said\nthat underneath the door, where the light in the passage could be\nseen, they saw some one passing to and fro. I looked, but there\nwas a chair with bars down the back between me and the door,\nand anything that I saw might have been caused by the bars. I\ndon't think the chair was in the same position with regard to the\nview of the others.\nMiss Scott was still persisting in her description of the ship.\nShe said she thought that she could go into a trance, and when\nMr. Askew returned and sat with us, she tried to do so. She\nappeared to fall asleep but did not speak, and when she recovered\ncould say no more than as before, that she had seen a liner\non fire.\nThe only fresh phenomenon was the ticking of a watch, which\nwe all heard, but could not account for.\nI think it must have been past one o'clock before we broke up\nthe seance. MILDRED WATSON.\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1914.\nTwo more items of testimony remain to be given. Mrs.\nAskew, in a letter to Miss Johnson, dated Oct. 28, 1913,\nwrote :\nSome friends with whom I was motoring back from Kempton\nremember that I had been telling them about the seance as we\nmotored down to the races, and I got very excited on seeing some\nposters, as we drove away from Kempton, announcing that there\nwas a fire raging on the \"Volturno,\" and reminded them of what I\nhad told them about the seance earlier in the day. . . . Mr. and\nMrs. Penton are the names of the friends with whom I was\nmotoring to Kempton, and their address is Hillside, Lindfield, near\nHayward's Heath.\nMiss Johnson then wrote to Mrs. Penton, asking if she\nwould give her recollections of the conversation, and received the\nfollowing reply in a letter bearing the postmark, Nov. 7, 1913 :\nMrs. Askew did not mention anything about [the] seance, which\nshe had on the night of the \"Volturno\" disaster at sea, until we\nhad arrived at Kempton Park, and she had bought a paper. On\nlooking at the paper, she saw the announcement of the disaster to\nthe \"Volturno,\" and seemed much astonished, and then said, \"How\nextraordinary,\" and told Mr. Penton and myself of the seance and\nof how Miss Scott had seen the ship on fire, etc., etc.\nThis is all I can tell you, as at the time I was busy racing, and\ndid not pay much attention to what she was saying; but on our\ndrive home, she gave me a thorough account of her stance, and all\nthe details as to how they smelt the fire and heard the water, and\nof how Miss Scott saw it all. G. L. PENTON.\nMiss Watson told Miss Johnson that she was staying with\na friend for the week-end, Oct. 11-13, and heard nothing\nabout the\n\"\nVolturno\n\"\ndisaster till she read of it in the\nmorning papers of Oct. 13. She had before this told her\nfriend about the sitting, and thought that she would, at all\nevents, remember how much upset she was on seeing the\npaper next day. In reply to a request from Miss Johnson,\nthis friend, Mrs. Dymond, wrote to her as follows :\nHAMPTON GRANGE, HEREFORD,\nNov. 11, 1913.\nMiss Watson has asked me to send you my recollections of her\nstory about the seance at which she was present. I am sorry I have\n\fMI.\nTelepathic Impression of\n\"\nVoltwno\n\"\nDisa*i< \/ . I ! I\nnot been able to do it sooner, but I have been away from home and\nvery busy, and thought it better to wait till I had more leisure to\nthrow my mind back. I was going in and out of the room while\nshe was telling it, so I missed some of the beginning, but this is as\nmuch as I can remember clearly.\nShe said they were sitting in a bedroom upstairs in the dark.\nLights began to Hash about, and they heard the sound of running\nwater. Mr. Askew went downstairs, and also into the bathroom to\nsee if the bathroom tap had been left running. While he was\ndownstairs they heard steps in the passage outside, and thought it\nwas Mr. Askew returning. He did not come in, so they went to\nsee, and found no one there. I cannot absolutely remember whether\nMiss Watson told us that evening that they smelt burning, though\na friend who was present tells me she did. Perhaps I was out of\nthe room when she said it. That was on Sunday evening. The\nnext morning I came in and found Miss Watson reading the news-\npaper account of the \"Volturno\" disaster. She was very much\ndistressed, and said they had smelt the burning and heard the water\ndripping. She said the smell was like burning leather or flesh,\nand that one of the people present at the stance had seen hands\ncoming up out of the flames, which apparently they all saw.\nThis is all that I can remember clearly, and I am afraid it is rather\nvague and not much use to you. DOROTHY DYMOND.\nIn regard to the supposed abnormal noises heard during the\nsitting, it seems not improbable that these were ordinary sounds\nisinterpreted, especially as the house is an old one, in which\nnoises are likely to occur. It is also possible that the smell of\nburning was due to some real smell, the origin of which was\nnot detected. But in that case, the natural interpretation to\nput on it would be that something in the JIOUM was on fire\n(as the sitters feared) : it would not naturally suggest that a\nship was on fire.\nThe evidence that this latter idea occurred to them at the\ntime would, of course, have been stronger if it had been recorded\nbefore anything was known of the disaster. But from Mrs.\nAskew's statement, in reply to Miss Johnson's question, that\nnothing had ever happened before at their sittings which the\nsitters thought at the time, or had reason to think afterwards,\nwas connected with any contemporary external event, it seems\nthat this was not a single correct impression out of a number\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1914.\nof incorrect ones, in which case it might be regarded as nothing\nmore than an accidental coincidence. It was, on the contrary,\nsomething unique in their experience.\nAgain, impressions that are not recorded until after they\nare found to correspond with external events may sometimes\nbe explained as illusions of memory. No doubt there are people\nwho sometimes imagine, after an event has happened, that they\nhad some supernormal impression about it beforehand. But\nif this case is to be thus explained, we should have to suppose\nthat three different persons in three different places (for it is\nto be noted that the party had by that time broken up) had\nthe same illusion of memory independently of each other, since\nthere is clear evidence that they were all struck by the corre-\nspondence between the events of the sitting and the disaster\nto the ship, as soon as they heard of the latter. Miss Scott,\non hearing of it, telegraphed to Mrs. Askew ;\nMrs. Askew, on\nhearing of it, told Mr. and Mrs. Penton of the coincidence,\nand on the same day wrote to Mr. Eeilding; Miss Watson, on\nhearing of it, remarked on the coincidence to Mrs. Dymond.\nIndependent evidence from all these persons has, it will be\nseen, been obtained, as well as independent statements from all\nthe witnesses of the actual events of the sitting.\nNOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nArchives de Psychologie, No. 51 (Sept. 1913). This number is\noccupied by two long articles, both of them of interest to psychical\nresearchers. The first describes the calculating powers of Mile.\nUrania Diamandi, a younger sister of the noted calculator, Pericles\nDiamandi. It appears that she is a visualizer and has arrived at\nher present proficiency by voluntary effort and her desire to rival\nher brother. Secondly, Prof. Claparede has a further account of\n\" the thinking horses of Elberfeld,\" in which he describes further\nexperiments with them and discusses the theories about them. The\nexperiments, which were intended to test whether the horses could\nadd figures which no one present had looked at, failed ;\nbut as the\nhorses were generally in bad form and usually answered wrong\nanyhow, it is held that nothing can be concluded from them. Of\nthe theories discussed, Prof. Claparede seems to incline most to\nthat of obedience to a telepathically received signal to stop tapping;\nbut he admits that the mystery is as yet unsolved. He also makes\nexcellent fun of a protest signed by a number of German professors\nwho thought they could settle a scientific question a priori by their\nauthority, and without investigation. F. C.

HENRY SIDGWICK read a paper entitled\n\"\nOn the Psycho-\nlogy of the Piper Trance Phenomena,\" which will be published\nlater in the Proceedings.\nEEPOET OF THE COUNCIL FOE THE YEAE 1913.\nTHE membership of the Society has increased considerably during\nthe year. 2] new Members were elected and 2 Associates\nbecame Members; 108 new Associates (including one Hon.\nAssociate) were elected, and 3 Members became Associates.\nOn the other hand, the total loss in numbers from deaths,\nresignations, and other causes, was 19 Members and 85\nAssociates; leaving a net gain of 30.\nThe total membership is now 1243, the numbers being\n\fMAIL, 1914.\nReport of the Council for ttie Year 1913. 107\ndistributed as follows :\nMembers, 290 (including 27 Honorary\nand Corresponding Members); Associates, 953 (including 11\nHonorary Associates).\nThe growth in membership is especially satisfactory because,\nas announced in the January Jouriud, it has recently been\ndecided to add to the office accommodation, which naturally\ninvolves an increase in rent and in other general expenses. It\nhas long been felt that the room which contains most of the\nbooks belonging to the Library is inconveniently small and\ncrowded, so that it has been difficult to offer readers proper\nfacilities for making use of the books, especially since the\nappointment of the Assistant Research Officer (Miss Verrall),\nas both she and the Assistant Secretary have had to work\nin the Library. The Council have therefore been on the\nlook-out for another room, and have taken advantage of\na vacancy that occurred at Christmas, on the top-floor of\n20 Hanover Square. The new room, which is next to Miss\nJohnson's, is pleasant, airy, and well lighted. It will be used\nby the Assistant Research Officer, and, if necessary, part of the\nLibrary will be housed there. It will be a great advantage\nto have this extra room for experiments and also for personal\ninterviews ;\nand it is hoped that, now there is more space,\nmore members will avail themselves of the opportunity of reading\nin the Library. The books can be borrowed and taken away\nfrom the office by Members only ;\nbut Associates have an equal\nright to come and read them in the office, and the Secretary\nis always glad to give visitors information and guidance in\ntheir reading, if desired. The Library contains all the standard\nbooks relating to the various departments of psychical research,\nwith many rare and valuable ones that are not to be met with\nelsewhere, as well as an unrivalled collection of works, both\nEnglish and foreign, on hypnotism and suggestion. It contains\nalso all the important foreign journals dealing with psychical\nresearch, and is constantly being added to and kept up to\ndate.\nIt would be possible for more persons to do independent\nwork in psychical research if those that had leisure and inclina-\ntion to do so would make a point of acquainting themselves\nthoroughly with the work that has been done by the Society\nin the past, the principles that have guided it, and the methods\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAK., 1914.\nthat have been followed. This becomes more and more essential\nas time goes on and as advances are made in the subject, so\nthat more knowledge and experience are constantly required\nto carry it on further.\nSome years ago, as a help to readers, a Combined Index was\nprinted, covering the first fifteen volumes of the Proceedings,\nthe first nine volumes of the Journal, the Proceedings of the\nfirst American Society for Psychical Research, and Phantasms\nof the Living. A supplementary Combined Index is now being\nprepared to the Proceedings, Vols. XVL-XXVL, and the Journal\nVols. X.-XV. The whole of this is already in type, and.it will,\nwe hope, be published before long, and be found useful to many\nreaders.\nThis year has been marked by the Presidency of Professor\nHenri Bergson, who is our third President from abroad, the\nother two being Professor William James and Professor Charles\nRichet. Professor Bergson's Presidential Address roused so\nmuch interest that it has been thought desirable to publish\nin the Proceedings, Part LXVIII, an authorised English translation\nof it\n(by Dr. Wildon Carr), as well as the original, which\nappeared in Part LXVII ;\nwhile a German translation has, by\npermission of the Council, appeared in the Zeitschrift filr Patho-\npsychologie, the Editor of which was anxious to interest the\neducated German public in the subject. It is, of course,\nappropriate that a Society which counts its members in almost\nall the civilised countries of the world should occasionally have\nforeign Presidents. A considerably larger number of foreigners\nthan usual have joined this year.\nAnother circumstance which aroused much interest in the\ngeneral public this year was the reference to psychical research\nin Sir Oliver Lodge's Presidential Address to the British\nAssociation at Birmingham, which has since been published in\nbook form with explanatory notes.\n1\nTo members of the Society\nit was an event of special interest that the greatest living\nveteran in psychical research, and one who had been, their\nown President Sir William Crookes was elected President of\nthe Royal Society.\nThe Society has to regret the loss by death during the year\n1\nPublished by Dent & Sons (Aldine House, Bedford and Chandos Streets,\nLondon, W.C.) under the title Continuity, price Is. net.\n\fMAU., inn. Report of the Council for the )'<\"\/ I'M.; 199\nof two of its oldest and most distinguished supporters, Dr.\nA. E. Wallace, O.M., and the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres.\nThe general work of the Society has been going on steadily\nthroughout the year, but it happens that there are few special\nincidents to record. As usual, a large number of experiments\nof various kinds have been carried on at the Rooms. Those\nwho have had most experience of such work will best under-\nstand how long a time has generally to be spent before results\nsufficiently conclusive to be worth publishing are obtained ;\nbut\nwe may mention in particular a promising series of experiments\nin thought-transference, in all of which the agent and percipient\nwere in two different rooms, begun several months ago and\nstill being continued.\nWe wish especially to impress on experimenters the desira-\nbility of trying experiments in thought-transference in this way.\nlere is no reason to think that distance need be a bar to\njlepathy, and the advantage of having the agent and percipient\ndifferent rooms is twofold: First, because, if success is obtained,\nhe evidence for telepathy is much stronger, since it is difficult,\nnot impossible, so long as both experimenters are in the\nsame room, to make quite certain that indications as to the\nsubject of experiment have not been unconsciously given by the\nagent, or unconsciously perceived by the percipient. Secondly,\neven if no such flaw in experimentation has occurred, so many\nprecautions are necessary to prevent it that it is practically\nipossible to record them completely, so as to give a reader\nrho has not been present the opportunity of judging for himself\nwhether the precautions taken have been sufficient. But if\nle agent and percipient are in different rooms, both the con-\nlitions and the record may be greatly simplified ;\nand it should\nlen be possible, by taking sufficient care, to make such a\nrecord as, to a reader assuming the bona fides of the experi-\nmenters, may carry almost the same weight as if he himself\nhad been present at the experiments.\nConsiderable progress has been made in dealing with the\nautomatic writings by various automatists, which also continue\nto be produced in abundance. Some of the results were given\nin a paper read by Miss Johnson at a meeting held early in the\nyear, and these will appear in full in Part LXVIII of the Proceed-\nings, to be published immediately.\n1\nAnother contribution to the\nt\n1\nThis Part was published in February, 1914.\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

In connection\nwith the same subject may be mentioned an important theo-\nretical paper by Mr. G. W. Balfour, entitled\n\"\nTelepathy and\nMetaphysics,\" which appeared in the Hibbert Journal for\nApril, 1913.\nIn the spring an interesting series of experiments with the\n.so-called\n\"\nthinking\n\"\nhorses of Herr Krall was carried out by\nDr. Woolley and Mr. Bullough at Elberfeld. These horses have\nbeen trained to spell out words and perform arithmetical\noperations, and there are differences of opinion as to whether\ntheir actions are guided by signals given unconsciously by\nthe experimenters, or by memory of what they have been\ntaught to do, or whether any real intelligence is involved. Dr.\nWoolley and Mr. Bullough convinced themselves of the bona\nfide character of the experiments, and though they were not satis-\nfied that all possibility of unconscious signalling was excluded,\nthey failed to detect any, and thought it improbable that it\nwas used. The performances of the horses were interesting\n.and remarkable, but did not seem to go beyond what might\nbe effected by well-trained memory. It turned out that the\n'time of year was an unfavourable one for getting the best\n.results, and further experiments were to have been made in the\nautumn, but these were unfortunately prevented by the illness\nof Herr Krall.\nMiss Verrall has during the year lectured twice to debating\nsocieties, at Lewisham and St. Albans, and she has recently\naccepted the position of Honorary Assistant Demonstrator in\nPsychology at King's College, London, a post involving one\nevening's work a week, with a view to keeping in touch with\nmodern developments in Psychology which may bear on psychical\nresearch.\nOn the psychological side of our work this year may be\nmentioned Dr. van Eeden's paper on Dreams, which included\na provisional scheme of classification, founded on records of a\nlarge number of his own dreams; and Dr. Woolley's paper on some\nexperiments made by a member of the Society, on the production\nof hallucinations by self-suggestion. In this paper Dr. Woolley\ndiscussed a number of the cases from a psycho-analytic point of\n-view, showing how they illustrated some of the normal processes\n\fM AH., 1914.\nReport of tke Council fo* thi >V\/\/- 1913, 208\nof dream-formation.

The names and addresses of all\nthe persons concerned have been communicated to us, but by\nrequest pseudonyms or initials are here substituted. The per-\ncipient, Mr. Parker, who is a clergyman, describes his experience\nas follows in a letter, a copy of which was received by Mrs.\nSidgwick from Mr. Kitchener on December 16th, 1913:\nOn Sunday evening, Dec. 7th, 1913, I explained to my niece and\ncompanion, M. W., that thoughts of two friends in whose house I\nhad lived for 12 months, 44 years ago, for the purposes of com-\npleting my education after leaving school, had occupied my mind\nduring the day in a most unaccountable manner. I had not seen\nMr. and Mrs. C. for 28 years, and had long since ceased to cor-\nrespond with them. The last time I had heard of them they were\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I added that I was so much\nimpressed by the frequent recurrence of these thoughts that, had\nthere been any tendency to superstition about me, I should probably\nhave expected to hear that something had happened to one or both\nof them. My niece and I smiled at the very suggestion !\nOn the following Friday, to my surprise, I received a copy of the\nD Daily Telegraph in which was the account of the tragic death\nof Mrs. C. from burning, which occurred early in the morning of\nSunday, Dec. 7th. Her nightdress caught fire as she was lighting\na candle to ascertain the time by her watch. The doctor at the\ninquest reported that death had ensued very shortly after the\naccident, and was mainly due to shock.\nMr. and Mrs. C. were 86 years of age.\n[Signed] T. PARKER.\nMiss W. corroborates Mr. Parker's statement as follows in a\nletter received by Mr. Kitchener on January 5th, 1914 :\nOn Sunday, Dec. 7th, [1913], at lunch time, my uncle spoke to\nme about a Mr. and Mrs. C., saying he had been thinking all the\nmorning about them. I had never heard him mention them before,\nand did not know of their existence.\nThen again at supper time he spoke of them and said that, if he\nhad been of at all a superstitious nature, he supposed he should\nhave expected to hear something about them within the next few\ndays.\nOn the following Friday he received a cutting from a D news-\npaper with an account of Mrs. C.'s accident and death.\nBefore telling me that he had received the paper, he asked me\non which day it was that he had spoken to me about Mr. and Mrs.\nC. This he did to make sure that it was the day of the accident.\n[Signed] M. W.\nMr. Parker sent us the cutting from the D Daily\nTelegraph above referred to. It is dated Monday, December 8,\n1913, and contains the following account of Mrs. C.'s death:\nA distressing accident occurred early on Sunday morning by\nwhich an old lady named Mrs. H C lost her life.

The\nboarding-house really consists of three houses, Nos. 48, 49, and 50,\nwhich have been so altered internally as to allow of communication\nbetween one and the other. On Sunday morning, at about a\nquarter-past six, several members of the Borough Police Force were\ngoing off duty when they heard cries of \"Fire!\" proceeding from\nNo. 48. The party consisted of Sergeant Jones and Constables\nHill and Jennings, and when they reached the door of the\nhouse it was opened by Mr. C ,\nwho led them into a bedroom,\nfrom which smoke was issuing. Mrs. C was found lying behind\nthe door with her nightdress, in which she was attired, smoulder-\ning, and she was at once carried out into the passage, but she was\npronounced to be dead by Dr. John A. W ,\none of the medical\nofficers of the County Council, who resides at the same house.\nIn regard to Mr. Parker's statement, Mr. Kitchener writes :\nTo the facts as stated by Mr. [Parker] I may add the following :\n(1) [Mr. Parker] is a man I have known for years, accurate and\nbusiness-like. He has hitherto had no sympathy with any investiga-\ntion of such cases, as I know from his reception of one or two\npersonal experiences of my own communicated by me to him.\n(2) I never heard him mention Mr. and Mrs. C., though he has\ntold me many details of his boyhood and young-manhood.

As you may have heard, we all\nwent over to E 's\n(where we spent the rest of the day) soon\nafter 12 o'clock. We had been waiting for the postman to arrive,\nbut as he was so late, Laurie suggested waiting a few minutes\nlonger while we went on. The house had previously been locked\nand bolted, excepting, of course, the hall door, so we all departed,\nleaving Laurie quite alone. He didn't arrive at E 's until after\n1 o'clock, and I noticed that he looked rather pale and tired, but\nmade no remark, as he is still feeling the result of his accident..\n\fMAI:..

He was sitting opposite me when\nIn-\nsuddenly said, looking at me, \"I had a vision this morning.\"\nI said, \"Did you\n1\n?\" and laughed, thinking he only meant to be\nfunny. But he said quite seriously, \"I did I saw Mother,\" and\nthen he proceeded to tell me how he heard all the bedroom doors\nopen and shut, and quick footsteps down the little corridor. At\nfirst he took no notice, forgetting he was alone in the house, then\nit dawned on him, and he went to see who it could be. I'm not\nquite clear whether he said he was already upstairs preparing to\nleave, or whether he only went up at that moment, but I understood\nhe was in the bathroom, and went to the door, when he saw Mother\nwalk from her bedroom towards him, and when she reached the top\nof the two little stairs he exclaimed, \"Good heavens.\" Then, I\nunderstood, she said something about being here and vanished.\nHe then realized what had happened and it unnerved him, so he\nimmediately ran downstairs, put on his hat and coat and left the\nhouse. After tea I got him to repeat what he had said, which he\ndid in much the same words, adding that Mother was dressed in\nher ordinary black attire, with her arms full of little parcels, and\nshe looked bright and like herself. She spoke, but he only had a\nsense of what she said, hardly hearing words. But she was so\nnatural that he was only surprised at her being there, not frightened,\ntill she vanished, but it was all over in a moment. The' footsteps\nthat he heard before looking were unmistakably Mother's quick, firm,\nshort steps, and the opening and shutting of the bedroom doors quite\nin her manner.\nIt was a wonderful experience, and startled him very much, as it\ndid me when he told me ;\nin fact, I can't get it out of my mind\nIt haunts me night and day; but each day, now, I feel happier\nabout it, as [my brother] G would surely have cabled by this time\nif anything serious had happened. . . .\n[Signed] GERTRUDE ORCHARD.\nThese letters were sent to us by Mr. Smith on Dec. 31,\n1913, before any news had been received by the family from\nCanada.

APRIL, 1914.\nTHE PHENOMENA OF FKIEDA GENTES.\nBY EMIL MATTIESEN, Ph.D.\nBEFORE entering upon the phenomena presented by Miss\nFrieda Gentes, it is necessary to say a few words on the\nquestion of Miss Gentes being a professional medium. I\nthink it may be said with certainty that all her mediumistic\ngifts were fully developed before she made any money out of\nthem. When her trance-painting was in full bloom, she was\ntold by her \"guide\" to produce it publicly, and consequently\nexhibitions were arranged in Berlin and other German towns,\nfor which admission fees were charged Her private circum-\nstances seem to have been such as to induce her not to refuse\nthe advantages offered by her newly discovered gifts. How-\never, there is, I think, no valid reason to deny her, on this\nscore, a serious scientific interest. Her drawing trances have\nbeen closely investigated by medical authorities and found to\nbe genuine. The cases of supernormal knowledge, referred to\nin this Eeport, were not connected with any professional\ninterest. It may be added, that all observers concur in\nattesting her personal integrity and truthfulness, and I may\nsay that my own observations, as far as they go, lead me\nvery sincerely to endorse this opinion. So far her real gains\nhave been very small, and her travels, she asserts, have not\npaid her expenses.\nBy personal enquiries I learnt the following facts about the\nmedium's personality: Miss Frieda Gentes was born in 1880.\nHer parents, she avers, were healthy people ;\nat least, with-\nout nervous complaints of any sort. The medium herself,\nhowever, appears to be of a very delicate constitution, pale\nand transparent, not reaching above 4 feet, her back curved\nand her finger-joints swollen. Her heart also causes her\ntrouble.\nThree years before her drawing powers developed (which\nwas in January, 1910), she had sometimes practised auto-\nmatic writing as a sort of\n\"\nsocial game,\" as it then appeared\nto her, but under the guidance of a decided\n\"\nspiritist.\"\nFurthermore she has been able to make tables rap and tilt,\nbut the raps she curiously avers have disappeared since\nthe development of her trances. Once, she reports, when\n\fA i i ; 1 1\n,, 191 4. 7 'A >\nPhenomena of Frieda Gentes. 211\nshe was alone, a picture rose from the wall, floated through the\nroom and lodged itself under a bed : the nail and cord being\nintact and the dust on the frame untouched. She also reports\nhaving heard noises as of\n\"\npeas\n\"\nbeing thrown on the floor\nabout her, but \"\nnot rolling away.\"\nHer automatic drawing started abruptly\n1\none evening towards\nthe end of January, 1910, when she was bedridden with\nrheumatism. During the preceding night Miss Gentes had\ntwice, on awaking, found her hands bathed in perspiration.\nNext evening, while she was noting down the press-marks\nof some books her sister was to fetch for her from the Public\nLibrary, the pencil suddenly drew a horizontal line across the\npaper (this sheet has been shown to me) and below that a\nflowery design of the type developed later on in her more\nelaborate pictures. She had been reading and was u\nwide-\nawake\n\"\nduring the whole process, which was repeated next\nnight, rather late. This time she used a blue pencil, and a\nflower was drawn upside-down. She was still\n\"\nwide-awake,\"\nand able to converse during the drawing. The new faculty\ndeveloped rapidly, but remained dormant during the ensuing\nsummer. Then very soon she began to fall into trance during\nthe drawing, possibly in consequence of using a greater number\nof coloured pencils and thus complicating the process.\nThe character, bringing on, and other details of her trances\nare thus described in a\n\"\nMedical Eeport,\" by Dr. A. Meier,\nof Munich, written on March 18, 1913:\n\"On March 17, 1913, Miss Frieda Gentes gave a special\nexhibition of her peculiar drawing work in a state of auto-\nhypnosis to a private circle of members of the Society for\nScientific Psychology [in Munich], at which some medical men\nand an experienced practical hypnotist were present. Miss\nGentes, by concentration of thought, by inducing inward and\ndownward convergence of the eyes, and by a peculiar modifica-\ntion of her breathing, auto-hypnotically induces a state of uncon-\nsciousness [in which she produces her drawings]. The state\nof unconsciousness comes on after scarcely 3 minutes ;\nthe\npulse, in the beginning 120 in a minute, first rises to 132,\niMr. H. Freimark, author of a book on Mediumistic Art (to be published\nshortly) thinks that Miss Gentes' automatism has been instigated by her know\nledge of the work of another drawing medium, Mrs. Assmann.\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1914.\nand after some 10 minutes again returns to 120; the colour\nof the face in this condition of total unconsciousness and\nanaesthesia is pale, the eyelids are nearly closed, leaving only\na narrow chink, the eyes slightly converge, the pupils are of\nmean size, and not reacting upon light, unless rather strong.\nWhen the state of unconsciousness began, the left arm was\nslowly bent at the elbow-joint into a right angle, raised up to\nthe level of the eyes, the fingers of this hand being abnormally\nextended, and arm and head remained in this cataleptic state\nwithout any change during the whole performance, which\nlasted nearly an hour and three-quarters. The right hand\nchooses, evidently without being controlled by the eye, out of\na great number of coloured crayons lying on one side, those\nwhich fit the drawing, and with them traces the drawing with\nmoderate speed on a sheet lying in front of the lady. In this\nwork the eye undoubtedly exercises some control, for as soon\nas the eyes are covered by a piece of paper held in front of\nthem, a noticeable unsteadiness sets in and the contours of\nthe drawing are no longer adhered to with the previous exact-\nness. In this state Miss Gentes, when called or spoken to,\ndoes not react at all, or, at times, very feebly.\n\"\nIf the drawing material is removed, the left arm soon sinks\nback into the lap, breathing becomes deeper, often resembling\nconvulsive sobbing (similar to what is observed in people coming-\nto after narcotics), the mimic muscles twitch and are distorted\nas in suppressed weeping, and after one more vehement twitch,\nalong with a little shriek, Miss Gentes again awakes. The\nprocess of awaking, too, lasted about two and a half to three\nminutes. Pulse 120. For some minutes Miss Gentes is some-\nwhat at sea, like a sleeper suddenly awakened; then perfect\nmental clearness again is established. Miss Gentes denies any\nfatigue even in the left arm, held up for so long (which, by\nthe way, is slightly colder to the touch than the right arm),\nand indeed none can be proved objectively to exist. Of hys-\nterical stigmata I have noticed nothing in particular. After\nawaking there is total amnesia. During the whole perform-\nance it was not permitted to step behind the back of the\nlady, as this would give her a headache after coming-to.\"\nI had an opportunity closely to watch Miss Gentes' trance\non June 4, 1913, and my observations, such as they are, bear\n\fAIM: 1\n1., 1914. The Phenomena of Frieda (rentes. 213\nout the foregoing statement almost in every detail. The trance\nseemed to be brought about chiefly by expectation.\nWork began about five minutes after\n\"\nexpectation\n\"\nhad set\nin. There were some sixty crayons on the table, well mixed-\nup, on the right side of the medium. Miss Gentes certainly\ndoes not choose those she wants to employ by her eyesight\n(she at times distinctly looks away from them), but by very\nprolonged\n\"\nfingering.\" The crayons are all of one \"\nset,\" and\nperfectly resemble each other in shape, smoothness, etc.; but\nI got no proof at that sitting of her\n\"\nfingering-out\n\"\na special\ncrayon she had been searching for. Those she employed fitted\nthe drawing, but others would have fitted as well. I also\nmade the experiment of the\n\"\nscreen,\" which left no doubt\nof the eyes being used in some dreamy fashion : the hand at\nonce began to\n\"\nsearch\n\"\non the sheet, wandering all about\nit, and finally settling in an appropriate place, to be sure, but\nstill mixing up the design and misplacing details in an obvious\nfashion. I got the impression that the hand, when bereft of\nthe guidance of the eyes, was directed by recollections of the\ndrawing achieved so far, recollections, however, of insufficient\n\"\nlocalisation.\" Miss Gentes told me, that for some ten minutes\nafter the conclusion of the trance, her eyesight was greatly\nimpaired.\nThe trance at times comes on spontaneously, when not\nexpected, but she can resist its coming on. It is preceded\nby a certain feeling of restlessness and oppression, which seems\nto radiate from the\n\"\nheart\n\"\nor the\n\"\nsolar plexus,\" as Miss\nGentes puts it. She feels sick, the twitching sets in (she has\nno special sensations in the arm), and she quickly loses con-\nsciousness. Her visual power, I am inclined to think, is rather\ncnhaiwed during the trance (possibly the fatigue of the eyes,\nobserved after coming-to, is due to an overexertion of the\nvisual apparatus during the trance). Thus, as Mr. Kampfer\n1\ntells me, Miss Gentes is able to work out a contour very\nslightly pencilled and quite invisible to ordinary eyes in the\nlittle light sometimes allowed. She has never worked in total\ndarkness. Her friends aver that she always gets the crayon\nshe wants at the time (which obviously may have to be a\ni Mr. Kampfer has been in charge of the public performances given by Miss\nGentes. Ed.\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APEIL, 1914.\nspecial one) when she continues work at a drawing which was\nbegun in a former trance (some of her drawings taking twenty-\nfive or even fifty hours to finish, while her trance has never\nexceeded eight hours). The trance personality has repeatedly\npromised by automatic writing (I have seen the originals) that\nit would finally succeed in entirely closing the\n\"\nwindows\n\"\n(i.e. eyes) of the\n\"\nhut\n\"\n(i.e. the medium), when, after working\nmore with her, it would have obtained full power over her. But\nso far the eyes, though closed more and more, have never yet\nbeen closed entirely. A mental (subconscious) origin of the\ncatalepsy of the left arm is suggested by the fact that it has\nbeen interrupted repeatedly by the will of the trance personality.\nOn such occasions it has declared that the catalepsy is. intended\nto prove the genuineness of the trance, and has challenged\nbystanders to imitate the feat, which they, of course, have been\nunable to do, exhaustion of the limb very soon forcing them\nto drop it, while the medium was holding up her arm for hours\nat a stretch without any fatigue being noticeable.\nAs to the intrinsic\n\"\nvalue\" of the drawings, everybody has, of\ncourse, to judge for himself. The effect of the originals is\nlargely due to their gorgeous and not disharmonious colouring.\nVery tiny circles, put closely together in great numbers, like\n\"\npearls\n\"\nin old-fashioned needlework, make up a great part\nof the designs, and form the\n\"\nground\n\"\nin some of them, while\nin others great areas of even colouring, smoothed to a perfect\npolish, are introduced. The trance-personality claimed to have\nused some fifty to sixty thousand \"\ncircles\n\"\nin one drawing,\nwhich it is not hard to accept as true.\nAs to the medium's professed inability to draw or paint in\nher normal condition, it is, of course, difficult to obtain absolute\ncertainty. I have no doubt, however, of her good faith in\nasserting it. She and her friends concur in stating that she\nhas never drawn or painted in any way seriously before her\ntrances began ;\nand that at school she was dispensed most of the\ntime if not always from drawing lessons on account of her\nfeeble health : her mark in that subject consequently was\n\"\nvery poor.\" Stress might, perhaps, be laid on her assertion,\nthat when she tries, while awake, to work at some painting\nbegun in a trance, she finds herself totally at sea, not knowing\nwhat to put in or how to go on. Her first automatic draw-\n\fA i\n-KM., iiM4. The Phenomena of Frieda Gentes. 215\nings, it is true, were primitive when compared with her later\nachievements ; still, they distinctly show the same characteristics,\nand are, as it were, the germ of what succeeded them.\nThe pictures are usually signed\n\"\nC. v. Rainsavi,\" or,\n\"C. v. II 1806-1910 \"\n(or 1911, etc.). This trance-personality\npretends its real name to be Louis Berlamottes, and to have\nbeen born on August 2, 1780, in Paris. I see no reason\nto suppose him to be a\n\"\nspirit,\" as Miss Gentes' friends (but\nnot she herself) seem to think. It is to be noted, that while\nRamsavi pretends the aim of his posthumous paintings to be\nto convince humanity of the reality of a future life, he\nobviously evades statements which could lead to researches\nconcerning the reality of his earthly life. He, e.g. refused to\nname the university where he had studied medicine, pretend-\ning that thus certain small peccadillos of his youth might get\nrevealed. He has been spoken to in French, but his use of\nthat language,\n\"\nin which the medium has never been instructed,\"\nappears to be limited to a very few common phrases, as, e.g.\n\"je comprends bien, mon frere.\" But it seems most destructive\nof his claims, that his pseudonym obviously originated in some\nsuggestions of Miss Gentes' friends. Search in this direction\nrevealed the following facts : Mr. Weingartner (Miss Gentes'\nfiance') thought to have observed in the corners of each of a\nseries of early drawings some single letters, which, on being\nput together in the order in which they appeared, gave the\nword \"\nRamsa,\" which he thereupon took to be the name of a\nspirit-artist. I was shown one of these\n\"\nletters,\" which quite\nobviously was merely a part of the ornamentation, gratuitously\nread into a letter. This pseudonym, then, once adopted by the\ntrance-personality, seems to have been the germ which led, later\non, to the elaboration of a whole life-story.\nAs will be seen, Miss Gentes conforms, not only in general,\nbut in every detail, to well-established types of\n\"\nautomatic\n\"\nmental activity. Her interest to Psychical Research, there-\nfore, seems to me to lie far less in these feats of her\n\"\nmedium-\nship\n\"\n(which have, in fact, brought her most before the public\neye), than in an element of supernormal knowledge which\nprimd facie very noticeably tinges her automatic messages.\nThese messages come to her in several ways. Sometimes\nshe writes them down automatically, mostly during her drawing\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1914.\nseances, interrupting the painting for the while. Dreams hardly\nseem to figure in her supernormal life, she mostly being able,\nshe says, to trace them to some natural origin, and thus to exclude\nany supernormal element. More frequently she has waking\nvisions, which confer to her a special meaning. Thus she\nclaims to see small shapes as of imps ;\nor human figures,\nwhich form out of clouds, and grow until they finally dissolve :\nthese always announce some impending misfortune.\nVery frequently she gets her messages through voices, which\nsometimes seem to speak right into her ear, sometimes to come\nfrom afar, or, as it were,\n\"\nthrough a telephone\n\"\ntypes of\nauditory hallucinations well known to the psychologist. She\nsoon forgets these messages, unless she speaks of them at once to\nother people.\nThere is a considerable mass of testimony bearing on Miss\nGentes' ability to divine the thoughts of people present with her,\nto get their names, unknown to her, to tell them their past\nlives or distant doings, correctly to foresee future events, etc.\nBut most of this testimony (contained in diary-notes, or letters\naddressed to the medium) does not go beyond fairly vague\nassertions as to feats of this sort having been witnessed, and\ncannot now be brought up to the desirable standard of evidence.\nA few of these documents, however, seemed to invite investi-\ngation, and the remainder of this Eeport consists of two of\nthese\n\"\ncases.\"\n(i)\nAn apparent instance of telepathy is described in the fol-\nlowing testimonial by Mr. Georg Korf:\nMOZART STRASSE, 3, HAMBURG,\nApril 7, 1911.\nWhile present last night at your sitting for trance-painting,\nthis idea suddenly occurred to me :\n\"\nIf Miss Gentes is clair-\naudient and clairvoyant, or even clair-sentient in this peculiar\nstate, then I should like to get an answer to a question put.\"\nI then wrote a test-word on a card, which I hid in my waist-\ncoat-pocket. A few seconds later Miss Gentes paused in her\npainting-work and wrote on a sheet of paper put ready to her\nhand :\n\"\nThe wings you may construct ; you yourself will live\nto fly ;\nmuch else besides, but not here.\" Only then I showed\n\fI'.MI.

The. original scrap of paper\nbearing the test-word I no longer possess; but I have enclosed\na copy of it. As it is my habit to carry [in my pocket]\none half or a quarter of a post-card for making short\nnotes, the copy enclosed resembles the original exactly.\nThe thing happened thus : Miss Gentes was in trance. [To\ntry her telepathic faculty] I directed my glance on to Miss\nGentes' forehead and th&ught intensely of a flying-machine I\nhad ordered to be constructed, which is an imitation of a pair\nof wings. Then I mentally put the question to the [medium]\nin about these terms :\n'\nDear Conrad von Bamsavi, please, answer\nmy question : Shall I achieve flying with rny apparatus ?\n'\nBefore trying this telepathic experiment, I wrote the word\n'\nFliigel\n'\non the slip of paper which I had been carrying about\nme, after first making sure that no one present could see what\nI was writing, and then again concealed it in my waistcoat-pocket;\nbesides, I stood apart at a distance of about four steps from\nthe drawing desk, and nobody was paying any attention to me,\nsince everybody was intently watching Miss Geutes' drawing.\nA few seconds after I had despatched my mental\n'\ntelegram\/\nMiss Gentes stopped her drawing, raised the arm with the green\ncrayon it was just holding, which apparently was a signal 1'or\nMr. Kiimpfer, that she wanted a clean sheet of paper, and\nthis being put to her hand, she wrote down an exact reply\nto my mental query. ...\"\n(2)\nThis case of precognition referring to an accident is\nperhaps\nthe most remarkable of all, and, happily, evidentially fairly\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1914.\nstrong. I first give, for convenience' sake, Mr. Kampfer's\nwritten resume\".\nDuring a sitting towards the end of 1907, \"the deceased\nbrother Richard [Gentes] manifested. Miss Gentes' mother,\nwho was present, said she should like to be with him, where-\nupon the reply came through [automatic] writing, that the\nmother would remain longer with Frieda than with her sister\nElsa. ... On Sept. 26, 1908, about 10 a.m. Miss Gentes'\nhairdresser was with her, and to her Miss Gentes suddenly\nsaid, without any external reason, 'my sister dies\/ wherewith\na condition similar to intoxication came over her, which con-\ntinued till about 4 p.m. She then read the extra-gazettes\npublished by the papers about the horrible disaster on the\nUnderground Railway and said :\n'\nMy sister is dead.' They\ntried to reassure her, and to persuade her out of it, but in\nvain. She sent out her brother to make enquiries. Towards\nevening he came back and reported that his sister really had been\ninvolved in the disaster and he had seen her in the morgue.\"\nThis resume is correct as far as it goes, but rather incom-\nplete. The knowledge came to Miss Gentes, as she told me\nduring a careful examination on May 8, 1913, through a\nvision, just after the hairdresser had called.\n\"\nI suddenly saw\nmy sister [Elsa] standing before me, one half of her face being\nblue.\" This, in her visions, is a standing symbol of a death\nnear at hand, while people already dead appear to her with a\nface entirely blue.\n\"\nAfter that I was for some time as one\nintoxicated, and have no very clear recollection of what happened\nduring that time.\" As to the vision itself she is as positive\nas possible, and its time may be fixed with fair approximation\nby the fact that the hairdresser used to call daily between\n9.30 and 10 a.m. It can hardly have happened after 10.15.\nOn that day the woman called twice again before noon, but\nwas sent away each time on account of Miss Gentes' excited\ncondition. She had, she also told me, intended to bake a cake,\nbut gave it up for the same reason. Elsa Gentes, I was further\ntold, was then employed in the\n\"\nKaufhaus des Westens,\" a\nwell-known department-store, as a saleswoman. She was living\nwith her mother and step-sister, Emmi Scholz, at 23, Bliicher\nStr., and used to come home for dinner during her midday\nrecess. On that day early her mother and step-sister had\n\fAPRIL, 1914. The Phenomena of Frieda Gentes.\ncalled on her at the Kaufhaus to tell her not to come home\nfor dinner, but to dine in the Kaufhaus, there being a special\nsale on, which Mrs. Scholz, the mother, wanted to visit. Her\nnot appearing early in the afternoon could not, therefore, add\nin the least to any apprehensions in her family. It was only\nMiss Frieda Gentes' persistent excitement and dread which\ncaused her mother to drive a second time to the Kaufhaus\n(some two miles distant from Bliicher Str.), to enquire after her\ndaughter. She did not find her, and her brother, who wanted\nto enquire by telephone, did not, Miss Gentes told me, get\nconnected. After the disaster got rumoured about, Mr. Wein-\ngiirtner went to the scene of it, but not having been admitted,\nwent home and again tried to persuade Miss Gentes out of\nher fears, which he thought groundless.\nThe disaster, well known to everybody in Berlin, had happened\nat 2 p.m., and Miss Elsa Gentes had been involved in it, because,\ncontrary to arrangements, she had started for Blucher Str. by the\nUnderground, the quickest way to get there. The corpse could\nnot get identified before evening, as the girl had no \"\nLegitimation\"\non her. The disaster was caused by one train hitting another on\nits side at the so-called Gleis-Dreieck, on an \"elevated\" section of\nthe route, and pushing one car from the bridge down into the\nstreet. A great number of people were killed.\nApart from the medium herself there are five possible wit-\nnesses for the fact of this prediction having been uttered before\nits fulfilment. Mr. Weingartner's testimony, given to me orally,\nI have incorporated in the foregoing enlarged statement. As\nto the hairdresser-woman, she has been lost sight of since, and\nhas become, I am told, an abandoned character, hardly worth\napplying to. Her name being Schulz, the most common in\nGermany, and in Berlin especially, she is practically ititrouvdble.\nThere remain Miss Gentes' mother, her sister Emmi Scholz,\nmarried since ;\nand her step-brother, Hermann Scholz. The\ntestimonies of these three are subjoined.\nMrs. Emmi Stammer, nee Scholz, wrote to me as follows:\n\"May 20, 1913.\n\"\nIn reply to your letter I will willingly describe to you,\nto the best of my recollection, what happened in connection\nwith the death of my sister Elsa\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1914.\n\"\nAt that time I was engaged as a clerk in the offices of\nH. Tietz in Leipziger Str. [another well-known and very large\ndepartment-store]. September 26, 1908, [being] a Saturday,\nwas a Jewish holiday, on which Tietz' establishment was closed.\nI therefore was free for the day and able to spend it in my\nsister's [Frieda Gentes'] shop in Alexander Str. We were very\njolly and decided to bake a plum-cake. I had fetched every-\nthing necessary for it, and we started to unstone the plums,\nwhen my sister Frieda grew very restless.\n1\nAfter we had been\nchatting together for another while it may have been between\n10 and 11 o'clock, she became quite excited and said: 'Our\nElsa dies, I have just seen her ;\none half of the face was blue ;\nshe dies.' As my sister Elsa was not ill, I reassured my sister,\nand told her she was nervous. Meanwhile it had got to noon.\nMy brother [Hermann Scholz] now came, who at that time\nwas employed in A. Samulon's linen-factory in Magazine Str.\nWe told him of the vision, but he laughed at us. When he\ncame again after [his] closing time at 4 p.m., we had in the\ninterim heard of the disaster on the Underground Railway.\nMy sister now charged my brother to telephone to the Kauf-\nhaus des Westens, where my sister [Elsa] was employed at that\ntime. He returned and said he did not get connected. In\ntruth he had been told that my sister had not returned from\nher dinner-recess. I reassured my sister Frieda, for I took it\nfor certain that my sister could not have used the Underground,\nsince my mother had intended to drive about noon to the\nKaufhaus des Westens, to buy linen, and besides was busy\npacking for [our] moving. Yet my sister insisted :\n'\nElsa is\ndead, I have seen her.' Now she sent me home to fetch my\nmother. The latter drove with me to the Kaufhaus des Westens,\nto convince herself whether my sister was in the house. Not\nhaving found her there, we drove to the scene of the disaster\nand from there to the [various] hospitals. Thence we were sent\nto the morgue, and there we found my sister, about 7 p.m.,\ndead. Thus this prevision, so tragic for us, had been fulfilled.\nThis occurrence, it will readily be understood, has deeply\nengraved itself on my recollection.\n[Signed]\n\"\nE. STAMMER.\"\n1\nMrs. Stammer does not mention the episode of the hairdresser's entrance.\nBut the omission is not important evidentially.\n\fAPRIL, nil i. The Phenomena of Frieda Gentes. 221\nI called on Mr. Hermann Scholz, Miss Gentes' step- brother,\non May 13, 1913, to obtain an account of his part in the\ndoings of September 26, 1908. He impressed me as a very\ndecent and orderly young man, and though his recollection\nof details was not quite as clear as might have been desired,\nhe obviously was most careful to state nothing but what he\nwus quite certain of. To make sure of the independent quality\nof his testimony I enquired, before saying anything about my\nerrand, when he had last seen his step-sister, to which he\nreplied :\n\"\nFour weeks ago.\" He knew nothing of my investiga-\ntion as yet. To save time, I took down his statements from\nhis lips, and here give them practically verbatim, merely\narranging them into a continuous narrative and omitting my\nquestions.\n\"At that time\" Mr. Scholz told me \"I lived in Alexander\nStr., two doors from my sister\n[Frieda], and daily used to dine\nwith her. I was employed as a lift-man at Arthur Samulon's\nlinen-factory. Dinner-time was from 12-1, or 1.30, certainly\nnot later than that [Mr. Scholz, as a matter of fact, was not\nquite certain on this point, and even consulted his wife, before\nmaking his statement], and this time was adhered to punctually.\nBut on Saturdays [September 26, 1908, was a Saturday]\nwe were free only half-an-hour, because work then stopped at\n4 p.m. On that day [Sept. 26, 1908] I, therefore, must\nhave returned to work at 12.30. [Mr. Scholz, in a later letter,\nadmitted this to be incorrect. See below.] When I went to\ndinner, at 12, or immediately after 12 noon, I found my sister\nterribly distracted. She was too restless to sit down for a\nmoment, but was rushing about in and out of the shop all\nthe time, the perspiration running down her face. She wept,\nand told me to go home [i.e. to Mrs. Scholz, at 23, Bliicher Str.]\nand see what had happened :\n'\nI am so restless, she said,\n[it is] as if\nsomething is going to happen in our family.'\n[He does not, however, remember whether she told him of\nany vision seen by her.] At 4 p.m. [when work was finished]\nI again went to No. 10, Alexander Str. [the sister's shop].\nI don't know whether she had already seen any\n*\nExtrablatt.'\nBut talk of the disaster may have reached her. She said :\n'\nElsa has been involved in that ;\nsee whether you can find\nout.' I marvelled at that, for I knew that Elsa had intended\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1914.\nto dine at the Kaufhaus that day [and therefore had no\nreason to use the Underground], but she said,\n'\nyou just be\noff\/ while she stood in the street, wailing. So I went, first\nto the scene of the disaster, where, however, no one was\nadmitted ;\nthen to a restaurant, where I enquired by telephone\nat the Kaufhaus des Westens, whether my sister had returned\nfrom dinner. I was told that she had not. Then I went to\nthe life-saving station on the Tempelhofer Ufer, from there to\nthe Women's Hospital in Gitschiner Str., and thence to the\nHospital on the Urban, always running. From the Urban I\nwent to the morgue. There I saw her, about 6 p.m. Then\nI took a cab and went to my mother, and there, after closing\nher shop, Frieda Gentes also came.\"\nI wrote to Mr. A. Samulon, enquiring about the hour of\nhis lift-men's dinner-recess in 1908, and the regularity with\nwhich it was kept, not mentioning, in my letter, Mr. Scholz'\nstatement. In reply Mr. Samulon wrote as follows :\nMay 21, 1913.\n\"\nTo the questions contained in your letter of May 19 I\nreply as follows :\n\"\nMy staff gets one hour for dinner on week days, except on\nSaturdays, viz. from 1-2 p.m. On Saturdays dinner-time is\nlimited to half-an-hour, viz. from 1-1.30 p.m., as on those\ndays we close at 4 p.m. Exceptions from this rule are only\nmade in case of sickness or of special permission, but I know\nnothing of the lift-man Scholz on the day in question having\nhad an exceptional permission with regard to\n[his]\ndinner-\ntime-\n[Signed]\n\"\nARTHUR SAMULON.\"\nBeing told of this letter, Mr. Scholz admitted the error in\nhis first statement. The fact, then, remains practically certain,\nthat his observation of Miss Gentes'\n\"\nterribly distracted\n\"\nstate\nrefers to a time nearly one hour before the moment of the\ndisaster.\nMrs. Scholz (Miss Gentes' mother) told me that for some\ndays previous to the accident Miss Elsa Gentes had not been\ncoming home for dinner regularly, as the family were preparing\nto move, and the household somewhat in a muddle. On the\nmorning of Sept. 26, 1908, Mrs. Scholz again told her daughter,\n\fA i\n-KII., 1914.

Of Frieda Gentes' prediction and\nexcitement she heard between 4 and 4.30 (when Miss Emmi\nScholz came home from her visit at 10, Alexander Street),\nand at first laughed at the idea, but after a while went out\nto enquire.\nI have seen the\n\"\nThird Extra-Gazette\n\"\nof the\n\"\nBerliner\nLokal-Anzeiger,\" quite the\n\"\nquickest\n\"\nlocal paper, published\nabout 3.45, and dated \"Saturday, September 26, 1908, evening,\"\nin which only 2 dead are given, of which one \"male unknown.\"\nThe regular \"Evening edition\" mentions \"13 dead,\" but gives\nno more names than the\n\"\nExtrablatt.\" The \"\nshutting off of the\nwhole locality by the police\n\"\nis mentioned.

Arthur Hill,\n- 23.5\nNote, J40\nA CASE OF STIGMATISM?\nTHE following case was sent to us by a gentleman here called\nMr. B. Walker, the subject being his wife. Mr. Walker, who\nlives in Spain, is a brother of an Associate of the S.P.R., and is\nwell known to us by correspondence. His true name and\naddress have been withheld at his request.\nMr. Walker's original statement of the case was as follows :\nDecember 25, 1913.\nTo explain this case, which looks like one of stigmatism by auto-\nsuggestion, I must begin by relating a little of our family history.\nIn the spring and summer of 1911 I was suffering from gangrene\nin the right leg, brought on, although this was not known at the\ntime, by arterio-sclerosis. The illness was a long one, lasting twelve\nweeks, during the whole of which, since for various reasons it seemed\nunwise to attempt amputation, not the slightest hope was enter-\ntained for my life, the only question being how long I should hold\nout. At the end of that time came a curious and inexplicable\nimprovement in my condition, in consequence of which the doctors\ndecided to amputate. The operation was successful, and after about\ntwo months of convalescence I was comparatively well again. At\nthe time of the operation the doctors warned my wife and me that\nthere was always a possibility, not to say more, that the disease\nmight appear at some later date. Last July, two years after the\noperation, I began to have some trouble with the great toe [of my\nleft\nfoot], into the details of which it is not necessary to enter. No\none seemed to know exactly what was the matter, but about the\nmiddle of November both my wife and I thought it\npractically\ncertain that gangrene would ensue.\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\nMy wife is not what is usually called a psychic : she does not\nwrite automatically, and can very rarely see anything in the crystal.\nBut she is very sensitive to mental impressions of all kinds, and with\nthe memory of my long and painful illness present to her, naturally\ndwelt a good deal on the possibility of its repetition, and in spite\nof every effort was unable to dismiss it from her mind. About three\nweeks ago, while she had this fear always present to her, her\nattention, while taking her bath, was attracted by something odd\nabout her toes, and she found that between each toe of the left foot\nthere was a patch of a bright blue-green colour of a pretty but\npeculiar shade. Some much smaller and slighter patches also appeared\nbetween the toes of the right foot. It should be borne in mind\nthat my trouble is with the great toe of the left foot. These\npatches gave her no inconvenience of any kind, but soap and hot\nwater made no impression on them. The next time our doctor\ncame to see me, she expressed fear that gangrene was setting in in\nmy toe, after which she showed him the green patches and asked\nwhether there could be anything in a medicine she had been lately\ntaking that could produce such a result. He said certainly not, and\nadded that he had never seen any skin affection in the least\nlike it. She also has never had or seen anything like it before.\nWhat makes us think that it may possibly be a case of auto-\nsuggestion is that, although she is of course perfectly aware that\ngangrene is not green in colour, she always sub-consciously associates\nit with that hue. She visualises very strongly, and often during the\nlast six weeks or so, on waking suddenly in the night, has seen the\nword \"gangrene\" written up, always in green letters. The colour\nof the patches is the same tone as that of a rug I use both night\nand day, but much more vivid in shade.\nShe has had no opportunity of showing her toes to any medical\nman other than Dr. K., a German M.D. who always attends us.\nBut he and I and our adopted daughter, Miss 0., who lives with\nus, can testify to the facts. I also mentioned them in a letter I\nwrote to my sister, Miss [Walker], when the colouring first appeared.\nOur prognostications about the recurrence of the gangrene have\nproved correct, and the toe is to be amputated in a couple of days.\nThe patches, which as I have said appeared about three weeks\nago, became somewhat fainter on Dec. 22nd, the day after the\namputation was decided on, possibly because my wife had been\nincreasingly anxious that the operation should not be delayed too\nlong, and her mind was somewhat relieved by the decision come to\nat the consultation on Dec. 21st. But as the operation, which is\n\fMAY, 1914. A Case of Stigmatism ? 227\nattended by some risk on account of the condition of my arteries,\ndraws nearer, the colour has become as vivid as before, and has very\nslightly extended in area.\n[Signed] B. WALKER.\nIn reply to this statement, we wrote asking for corroborative\naccounts from Mrs. Walker and Dr. K. Mrs. Walker wrote\nas follows :\nJanuary 13, 1914.\nOn Thursday, December llth, 1913, I was expecting Dr. K. to\nexamine my husband's left foot, which was threatened with gangrene.\nThe active fear of this disease in that limb had been present in my\nmind from about July 14th last, when a sudden attack of pain\nunder the knee, followed by other uncomfortable symptoms, had\nwarned me that mischief was going on. In July, 1911, when the\nright leg was amputated for gangrene arising from arterio-sclerosis,\nthe doctors had told me there was reason to fear a recurrence of\nthe gangrene at some future date. Thus when I saw in July last\nthat the circulation had suddenly become impeded, I felt a con-\nviction that sooner or later gangrene must appear and another\noperation become inevitable. At that time Dr. K. was away on his\nholiday, as were also Drs. [Y.] and M., the surgeons who have\nbeen in consultation with Dr. K. at intervals since the first operation\nin July, 1911, which Dr. M. performed. My husband did not\nwish to call in any other medical man, as those mentioned were the\nonly ones here who were conversant with his case. I therefore had\nthe responsibility of treatment as well as of nursing during the three\nweeks that my husband kept his bed and until Dr. K. returned\nabout six weeks later. On visiting my husband he found his general\ncondition good. There was no pain in the foot, but only excessive\ncoldness and a dark bluish appearance. He was then leading his\nnormal life, and Dr. K. thought I might safely go away for a\nmonth's holiday, as I was suffering from severe neurasthenia, the\nresult of anxiety and too much writing, my right hand having been\nfor years past partly crippled by writer's cramp. When I returned\nI felt dissatisfied with my husband's condition, and on November 14th,\nat my request, Dr. K. held a consultation with Dr. M. I was then\ntold that the condition was grave owing to the advance of arterio-\nsclerosis, that various complications might ensue, and that gangrene\nbeginning in the great toe was the most probable. Treatment with\na view to improving the circulation was ordered, and for the first\nfortnight it seemed successful so much so that Dr. [Y.], who called\non November 29th, expressed hopes that the threatened gangrene\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\nmight yet be staved off. After this, however, acute pain set in,\nand on December 7th Dr. M., having again met Dr. K. in consultation,\ntold me that owing to the state of the arteries the case was very\ngrave indeed, although at the moment there was nothing to indicate\nthe need of amputation.\nFrom November 14th I had been in a state of growing anxiety,\nand had been up from two to five times every night, so that, being\nunable to sleep in the day time, I was going very short of sleep,\nwhile the daily dressing of the foot kept its condition continually\nbefore my mind. During the night of December 10-1 1th I had resolved\nto ask for another consultation, although I knew that both my hus-\nband and Dr. K. thought my anxieties exaggerated and would oppose\nit. I was in continual dread lest gangrene should set in and spread\nas rapidly as it had done in the right leg in 1911, when there had\nbeen over two months of intense suffering, during which it had\nseemed that amputation would not save life. My husband in his\nletter to the S.P.R. mentioned how an extraordinary improvement\nin his general condition took place in the tenth week of that illness,\nin consequence of which amputation was successfully performed and\nhe regained a certain degree of health. My reason for wishing to\nhave a consultation on Dec. llth was that Drs. [Y.] and M. only come\nto [A ]\nfrom H. for consultations on Thursday and Friday in\neach week, so that it would be at least a week before they would be\nin [A ] again. Thus Thursday, Dec. llth, was, I felt, a critical\nday for me. I woke with a start in the night of the lOth-llth\nand saw the word \"\ngangrene\n\"\nin very large bright green letters\non the mosquito net at the foot of my bed. I had been doing this\noccasionally (waking suddenly and seeing the word as described)\nsince July 14th and constantly since November 14th, and each time\nthere had been some fresh development of the illness. I therefore\ndetermined again to make every effort to secure the consultation,\nwith a view to amputation the moment gangrene should declare\nitself. Of course I know only too well what gangrene looks like,\nand that it is not green; but some reminiscence of Shakespeare's\n\"green wounds\" has always made me visualise the word as green\nin these half-waking visions.\nThat morning on getting out of my bath I noticed something\nodd about the small toe of my left foot, and found that there was a\nvivid green stain on the inside of every toe, which no amount of\nrubbing would remove. Similar stains, but lighter in colour and\nsmaller in area, also appeared on the right foot. The stains are\nas nearly as may be described the colour of verdigris, and are\n\f, 1914. A Case of Stigmatism? 229\nbetween the toes. Only on the small toe of the left foot does the\nstain run up far enough to be visible above.\nI assumed that something in a Spanish syrup of liquorice which\nI had been taking for a cold might be the cause, acting perhaps\non uric acid in a rheumatic constitution, although I had taken very\nlittle of the medicine. Of course I at once eliminated the possi-\nbility of dye from stockings. Before December llth I had been\nwearing brown stockings, new but already washed ;\nwhile some\nnew black ones of the same set, put on afterwards by mistake\nwithout previous washing, dyed the soles of my feet slightly black\nwithout a tinge of green. Moreover, that dye was immediately\nremoved by washing, whereas up to the date of writing (Jan. 13th)\nno amount of soap and hot water has made the slightest impression\non the green stains. It may be worth mentioning that the rug\nwhich my husband has used over his foot night and day for many\nweeks past is of a peculiar blue-green colour, much the same tone\nas the stains on my toes, but a good deal faded by the sun.\nOn December llth I found it impossible to persuade either my\nhusband or Dr. K. that another consultation was immediately neces-\nsary. The foot was then warm and red, and it certainly seemed\nabsurd to talk of amputating a toe which appeared still quite alive.\nNevertheless I was convinced that if we did not have the consulta-\ntion we should regret it, and I was so unhappy at the decision\nnot to call in Dr. [Y.] that week (Dr. M. was away from Spain)\nthat I submitted with a bad grace to showing Dr. K. at my\nhusband's request the green stains, which interested him more than\nhis own ailment. Dr. K. said he had never seen anything like\nthem, that nothing in any medicine he had prescribed for me could\nhave produced them, that the stains were under the skin (the\ncondition of which was otherwise quite normal), and thus could not\nhave been produced by any outside agency, and he said that he\nwould like Dr. [Y.] to see them if it became necessary to have\nanother consultation in the following week.\nA day or two later my husband's foot had become so very much\nworse that Dr. K. was obliged to order injections of morphia, and\nfrom then to Dec. 18th, when we expected Dr. [Y.] to come to\nA ,\nthe disease advanced with the rapidity that I had feared.\nWhen we sent to his consulting room on Dec. 18th we found\nthat Dr. [Y.] was not expected again till\nJanuary 8th, by which\ntime I felt assured that my husband's life would be imperilled, not\nonly by the increasing pain and want of sleep, but by the quantity\nof morphia he was compelled to take to get any ease at all.\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\nOn Dec. 20th, however, much against my will owing to my great\nanxiety, I went to play for the service at the English Church, the\norganist having been suddenly called away and no one but myself\nbeing available to take his place. To my surprise our Chaplain\ntold me that Dr. [Y.] was in A , having made a special journey\nto see another patient, and a few minutes later he came into the\nchurch. As soon as the service was over he came to see my\nhusband, and said that gangrene had set in, and the sooner an\noperation could be performed the better. For various reasons this\nhad to be postponed until the following Saturday, December 27th,\nand then it was found necessary to amputate the leg above the\nknee. I was aware that there was an element of danger in giving\nthe chloroform, owing to the general condition of the arteries, and\nfor nearly a week after the operation certain symptoms kept me in\na state of continual nervousness as to what might happen.\nAt my husband's particular request, made two days before the opera-\ntion, when he was writing to the S.P.R., I looked at the stains on my\ntoes as often as I could remember to do so during the following\nweek, and found them as vivid as ever. A few nights after the opera-\ntion, when symptoms of heart trouble -made me especially nervous, I\nwoke and saw the word \"gangrene\" again, but this time it was a\nlong way off, not as before hung up like a sky sign at the foot of\nmy bed, and it was in small black print like the leaders in the Times.\nSince then my husband has ,made steady progress, and I have\nnot visualised the word again at night. The green stains are,\nhowever, as vivid as ever on the left foot, though they have almost\ndisappeared on the right. I am inclined to think that the six\nmonths' anxiety about my husband's left foot has so deeply impressed\nitself on my sub-consciousness that it\nmay be some time before this\napparently auto-suggested evidence of it disappears from my left\nfoot, although my waking self knows that in all human probability\nno recurrence of the gangrene is possible.\nI am a practical woman with a good head for business, but I have\nalways been extremely sensitive to mental impressions, visualise\nwith intense distinctness, and have had some previous psychical\nexperiences. [Signed] E. M. WALKER.\nThe following statement from Dr. K. was enclosed :\nJanuary 18, 1914.\nI herewith certify that Mrs. B. [Walker] has shown me some\ngreen patches between the toes of her feet, of which I am unable\nto explain the cause for the moment. [Signed in full]\nC. K.\n\fMAY, 1914. A Case of Stic\/matism ? 231\nA medical man to whom we showed the preceding reports\nsuggested that the case might be one of chromidrosis (coloured\nsweating), and we thereupon wrote again to Mr. Walker, telling\nhim of this suggestion and asking whether it was possible that\nthe marks on Mrs. Walker's toes had been there for some time\nbefore they were discovered. He replied as follows :\nFebruary 16, 1914.\nYour Doctor's suggestion of chromidrosis is\nvery interesting, and I\nwill take the first opportunity of speaking to Dr. K. about it. I\nmay say at once, however, that it is impossible that the stains can\nhave existed for any length of time without my wife seeing them :\nshe could not help noticing them when she washed her feet. It is\ntrue that when the toes were in their natural position only one of\nthe marks was visible, but when they were pushed apart as they\nmust be for washing, they would all be seen immediately. They\nextend from the junction of the toes nearly up to the lower joint, so\nthat their size and bright colour makes them conspicuous.\n[Signed] B. WALKER.\nA few days later we received through Mr. Walker the follow-\ning statement from Dr. K. :\nFebruary 23, 1914.\nChromidrosis, the suggested explanation of Mrs. W.'s skin trouble,\nmeans a coloured discharge of the sweat glands. I know the name\nfrom my studies at the University, but I have never met with a\ncase of it. The affection of the skin of Mrs. W.'s toes is not an\nabnormal perspiration, but some green mark under the skin subcu-\ntaneous or hypodermic. If it was a trouble of the sweating glands\nit should have disappeared with all the washing and scratching\n*\nMrs. W. has applied at the beginning. [Signed] C. K.\nSubsequently we received a further statement from Mrs.\nWalker, as follows :\nMarch 1, 1914.\nI do not much care to write about the green stains on my feet,\nas it seems to me such a ridiculous form of auto-suggestion. But\nas you say you are interested I write to say that at last the marks\nare diminishing.\nI have been in constant anxiety about my husband since as well\nas before his operation, for until the last week he was not regaining\nstrength as we had hoped, and was suffering a great deal from\nneuralgic pains in both the amputated feet. So that, if the stains\nwere connected with that, I have not yet had much chance of\ngetting rid of them. But in the last week or so a marked change\niMr. Walker notes that Dr. K. means \"rubbing.\" There has been no\nscratching of the marks.\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\nfor the better has set in. He is rapidly gaining strength, and the\nalarming collapses mainly nervous, I think which made us so\nanxious, seem to have disappeared ;\nand the neuralgia is steadily\ndecreasing. And the marks on my feet are certainly decreasing\npari passu with my causes for anxiety. To-day I noticed that the\nstains on my left foot are now only to be seen by pulling the toes\napart, whereas until lately they showed above them. Those on the\nright foot are very much fainter and seem to be disappearing\naltogether.\nI don't know whether chromidrosis affects all the sweat glands or\nwhether it is local : but there has never been the slightest trace of\ndiscoloration on any other part of my body. In the winter I per-\nspire very little; but two days ago I got heated in the sun, and\nmy feet perspired in the ordinary way ; nevertheless, as I say, the\ndiscoloration has diminished. In the left foot the decrease is in\nthe area alone ;\nthe colour is as bright as ever.\n[Signed] E. M. WALKER.\nAs further evidence suggesting that the marks on Mrs.\nWalker's feet are directly affected by her mental condition, Mr.\nWalker writes :\nMarch 17, 1914.\nOn the morning of March 10th my wife told me that she had\nbeen rather worried last night by matters unconnected with the\nstate of my health nothing of great moment, but small worries\nalways bulk large during a sleepless night and in the morning the\ngreen stains, which had almost disappeared, were again as bright as\never, although the area of them had not increased. I made a note\nof this at the time. To-day she said that the marks had almost\ndisappeared, though in what remains of them the colour is un-\nchanged. [Signed] B. WALKER.\nIn reply to a question regarding Mrs. Walker's general health,\nMr. Walker wrote :\nMarch 30, 1914.\nFor the last six months my wife's health has been exceptionally\ngood, in spite of broken nights and a period of great anxiety while\nI was ill. Since October she has been better and stronger than\nat any time during the twenty-eight years that we have been\nmarried. I forget if I told you her age : it was 57 last month.\nI enclose her report on a slight recrudescence of the marks,\nwhich took place about a fortnight ago.\n[Signed] B. WALKER.\nMrs, Walker's report is as follows :\nMarch 30, 1914.\nMy husband has been steadily improving in health for the last\nmonth, and is now stronger in every way than we ever hoped he\ncould be again. In proportion as I have been growing more and\nmore free from anxiety the green marks have lessened, and now only\none faint shadow remains on the big toe of the left foot.\n\fMAY, I'.MI. A Case of Sticpmatism? 233\nA fortnight ago, owing to a change in his regimen, my husband\nhad a sudden set-back, which lasted about 24 hours. On the\nmorning after the attack I noticed a small spot [about the size of\na small pea] of vivid green on the top of the small toe of my\nright foot, wnere no mark has ever appeared before. Next day my\nhusband returned to his former regimen, and his circulation again\nbecame normal. The new spot, like all the other marks, has now\ndisappeared. [Signed] E. M. WALKER.\nWith regard to the suggestion that the case is one of\nchromidrosis, it does not seem to be at all easy to form a\ndefinite conclusion. Chromidrosis is a very rare disease, and\nthe information to be obtained about it is scanty and not\nvery definite. The symptoms described by Mr. and Mrs.\nWalker (confirmed by Dr. K.) do not correspond to those\nusually associated with chromidrosis. In Segueira's Diseases\nof the Skin (p. 490) we find the following brief description:\nMany of the recorded cases of coloured sweating are doubtless\nimpostures, but there are a few authentic instances. The face,\neyelids, cheeks, forehead, and (rarely) the hands and feet are\naffected. The sweat may be dark brown or black. . . . Blue\nsweating from pyocyanin and green, yellow and red varieties have\nbeen recorded.\nKaposi (Diseases of the Skin, p. 117) says :\nThe term chromidrosis is applied by writers to those cases in\nwhich the sweat has a yellow, green, black or blue colour. The blue\ncolour has been attributed to a cyanate combination analogous to\nFordos' pyocyanin, to a microscopic fungus whose gonidiae nuclei\nhave a blue colour, also to Indian and Berlin blue.\nIn the Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science, 1869,.\nthere is an account by Dr. Foot of a case of chromidrosis\nwhich came under his observation, the patient being a young\ngirl. Dr. Foot thus defines chromidrosis :\nThe term chromidrosis is a general one, comprehending any dis-\ncolouration of any part of the external skin, which is due to the\nexudation of a special pigment, black, brown, blue, or yellow pro-\nvided that the discolouration be on the outer surface of the skin,\nsusceptible of removal by friction and of being reproduced after a\nvariable interval of time.\nAll the published reports that we have seen speak of the\npigment being exuded from the skin ;\nit is confined in most\ncases to the face, especially the eyelids ;\nthe subjects are\nusually quite young women, and the disease is frequently\naccompanied by hysterical symptoms of various kinds.\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\nThese reports, it will be observed, differ in one important\nparticular from the account given above of Mrs. Walker's\nsymptoms. They speak of the pigment being\n\"\nexuded from\nthe skin,\"\n\"\nsusceptible of removal by friction,\" whereas in the\ncase of the marks on Mrs. Walker's feet it is said that\n\"\nsoap and hot water made no impression on them\n\"\nand \"\nno\namount of rubbing would remove them.\" Dr. K. confirms\nthis in his statement that the green marks are\n\"\nunder the\n.skin.\"\nBut evidently the above statements about chromidrosis are\nnot exhaustive. Dr. Agnes Savill, whose opinion we asked on\nthe case, writes as follows :\nMarch 9, 1914.\n... It [chromidrosis] is a very rare condition I have only once\nseen a case, a blue green colour about the toes. It may last\nmonths and disappear of its own accord. It is\nusually met with in\nnervous women, the type who could develop stigmata. Its cause is\nobscure. Sometimes it can be seen as a powdery deposit on the\nskin ;\nsometimes no amount of rubbing and washing can remove it.\nSome authorities hold that it is the sebaceous gland's oily secretion;\nothers the majority that it is the sweat. Yet it does not occur\nin markedly perspiring patients ;\nso that it is no ordinary perspira-\ntion complication.\nThe fact that it occurs usually in nervous women who are in a\ndepressed or nervous state, may perhaps point to its being dependent\non the state of the nerves, and it may have a similar origin to that\nof stigmata. It is too rare for much to be known about it. ...\n[Signed] AGNES SAVILL, M.D.\nIt will be observed that the case of chromidrosis which\nhas come under Dr. Savill's observation, corresponds in general\nappearance to Mrs. Walker's symptoms, and Dr. Savill notes\nthat there may be cases of chromidrosis which no amount of\nrubbing or washing will remove. On the other hand, Dr.\nSavill's concluding remarks suggest that perhaps the two explana-\ntions of this case which have been put forward, chromidrosis\nand \"\nstigmatism by auto-suggestion\/' are not mutually exclu-\nsive. If chromidrosis is\n\"\ndependent on the state of the\nnerves\n\"\nand \"\nmay have a similar origin to that of stigmata,\"\nis it not possible that we have in Mrs. Walker's case an\ninstance of chromidrosis precipitated, so to speak, and localised\nby her mental preoccupation at the time ? It is noteworthy\nthat whereas in chromidrosis the pigment may be of several\ndifferent colours and may appear in various parts of the body\n\fui. A Case of Stigmatism? 235\n(usually the face), in Mrs. Walker's case both the colour and\nthe area affected were such as auto-suggestion might, under\nthe circumstances, be expected to produce.\nThe case raises several questions of interest, and we print\nit in the hope that some of the medical members of the\nSociety may be inclined to consider it and give us the advan-\ntage of their opinions on it.\nFEVER VISIONS AND AUDITIONS.\nBY J. ARTHUR HILL.\nSCIENCE supposes all careful records of facts to be important,\nif the proper connections can be discovered. And the way to\ndiscover them is to have plenty of records, so that gaps shall\nbe narrowed, and continuity approached. In psychology, many\nfacts are still anomalous, apparently chaotic and with no dis-\ncoverable meaning, e.g.\nthe ordinary dream. It is therefore\nto be wished that prolific dreamers who remember their dreams\nand can record them accurately along with comments on possible\npredisposing causes, etc., should follow the excellent example\nset by Dr. van Eeden, who gave an interesting report in\nPart LXVIL of our Proceedings.\nSimilarly with waking hallucinations. These rarer experiences\nmust have some sort of scientific interest, even though we\ncannot at present see any use in the contemplation of them.\nIt is a matter of faith, faith in science, in the rationality and\nmeaning-fulness of all facts. This faith induces me not without\nhesitancy, though to contribute the following record.\nIn June, 1913, I had a sharp attack of Eussian influenza.\nThere were no symptoms of cold no catarrh, sore throat,\ncough and the whole thing was fever pure and simple. The\ntemperature began to run up about midnight on May 31-\nJune 1, and was 102 about eight hours later, when the\ndoctor began to dose me with \"salicylate of soda. At 10 a.m.,\nJune 2, it was 103'S, and the next morning 104'5. After\nthis it came down, with various oscillations ;\nnot only the usual\n\"\nevening up and morning down,\" but also fluctuations which\nseemed to be a kind of rhythmic pulse of the fever itself.\nAt the top of each of these waves there was a drench of\nsudden perspiration and a drop of temperature almost like a\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\npneumonia crisis, then a gradual climb up again. After a day\nor two of salicylate, I was put on quinine, and this may\naccount partly for the noises, though I never had any\n\"\nringing\n\"\nin the ears ;\nwhether the headache and woolly feeling were\ndue to the fever or the quinine, or both, I do not know. The\ntemperature touched normal on June 5 ;\nremained so a few\nhours, and began to climb again. A relapse followed, and\nfive weeks in bed ;\nbut though the temperature again approached\n105, I had no more hallucinations. Those were chiefly on\nJune 3 and 4. In the relapse-period I had no quinine or\nsalicylate. I copy the following from pencil notes made June 5,\nas soon as I was able to write. During the hallucination\nperiod, I tried to fix on my memory everything I saw, with\na view to making a record as soon as strength permitted. I\nnever lost consciousness, and was not delirious. My nurses\nsay that I always seemed quite rational. But I did not tell\nthem about the busy time I was having subjectively !\nVague floating half-human faces emerged from nowhere and\nadvanced upon me : one of them with three eyes and no nose,\nothers with queerly bulging and hillocky foreheads and sunken\ncheeks. None of them recalled any face that I had ever seen.\nThey seemed to advance until quite close to me, then vanished\nor melted into something else. Once, and once only, a face\nthat was beautiful appeared. None of them spoke. Indeed\nthey seemed sluggish and half-alive creatures, with no \"\nspecu-\nlation\n\"\nin their eyes. They did not cause anything approaching\nhorror, certainly no fear. I knew they were hallucinatory, for\nthey appeared only when my eyes were shut, and even then\nI could to some extent control and even dismiss them,\ntemporarily, by an effort of will. My feeling was one of mild\ncuriosity, with slight repulsion when the face was deformed.\nThey did not seem malevolent.\nThen I saw great book-cases. These mighty structures arose\nsomewhere afar off, loomed up and advanced upon me, then\nslid smoothly away to the left, one after the other, scores of\nthem. The majority had cupboards in their lower portion,\nand on the doors were sometimes words, or hieroglyphics of\nsome sort. In one case they looked like a series of Hebrew\nletters, but I could not read them. (I never had more than\nthe merest smattering of Hebrew, and I have now forgotten\neven most of the alphabet.) On one panel I saw the word\n\fMAY, 1914. Fever Visions and Auditions. 237\nKey, in English, and I thought that the cupboard or book-\ncase contained the key of some locked mystery of cipher\nwriting or what not a Kosetta stone interpreting ancient and\nhidden records.\nAll were seen with shut eyes. I never saw anything with\nopen eyes except a few times when they were not widely\nopen, the lids thus shutting out part of the room and lessening\nmy awareness of locality. In these conditions a hallucination\nwould build itself up on a basis of half-perceived reality, being\nthus illusion rather than hallucination, though the perception\nwas abnormal in that the object would not have produced the\nillusion in my normal consciousness. For instance, the bars\nin the back of a chair would become a gate, and a green\ncushion beyond, seen between the bars, became a meadow.\nMy liveliest time was through the ears. The racket was\nnot really disturbing, for I was not forced to attend to it, but\nwhenever I liked to listen the entertainment was always in\nfull swing. First, there was always a barrel-organ which\nusually played God be with you till we meet again, and as I\ndo not know it very well though I did, fifteen years ago\nit often played several lines before I recognised the tune.\nThere was another instrument, I couldn't tell what, which\nobligingly played anything I wanted. Then there were people\nalways talking, never to me but to each other, and I could\noverhear their conversation if I liked. But it wasn't very\ninteresting. They were English, always, and did not seem very\noriginal did not present any new points of view. However,\nthey were always cheerful, in a quiet way. This quietness\nwas a peculiar and striking feature. There was a sort of sub-\nduedness about all these auditory phenomena which I clearly\nnoted at the time. It was a racket, as I have said ;\nbut rather\nbecause of its medley than because of the noise. In most\ncases, this curious muffled or muted quality of the sounds would\nhave been enough to differentiate them from real sounds, but\nin other cases there was a close approach to reality. For\ninstance, I heard a lot of imaginary trains, also winds. Non-\nexistent trains ran into stations, by thousands ;\nnon-existent\nwinds rushed and blew and swished, now rising and now falling,\nround the house. These trains and winds were so real to me\nthat I repeatedly asked if it was windy outside, but was told\nthat it was not. I also asked if extra trains were running\ng\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\n(a railway line is near, and trains audible), but it was not so.\nThe trains on the near-by branch line are infrequent, sometimes\ntwo hours between ;\nbut I heard a train every few minutes.\nI could always hear people talking in other rooms of the\nhouse. Sometimes I knew it was hallucinatory, knowing that\nthe room in question was empty, but sometimes I didn't.\nE.g. my nurse said one night :\n\"\nI'll give you your medicine\nnow.\" She went out. I then heard her talking to my sister,\nthe latter replying. I could not make out the words, but the\ntones of their voices were clearly recognisable. I thought,\nangrily, \"Why has she gone into my sister's room, waking\nher up like this ? She must have failed to get full instruc-\ntions before the household settled for the night, as she ought\nto have done.\" I was very angry. As a matter of fact, the\nnurse had not been into the room in question at all ;\nshe only\nwent just outside my own, to a little table where the\nmedicines, etc., were ranged.\nTo some extent the sounds could be influenced. E.g. if I\nexpected to hear something, I heard it.\nEvidently there was\ngreatly increased suggestibility,\" for I am not normally a\nsuggestible subject. One morning I awoke, and said to\nmyself :\n\"\nIt will be about six o'clock.\" At that time a local\nmill-whistle goes. I thought :\n\"\nThe mill- whistle will be going\nsoon.\" Almost at once I heard it, three times.\n\"\nJust\nguessed !\n\"\nI said to myself. Then I looked at my watch. It\nwas 4.30 ! No local whistles go at that time.\nTwo of the talking people who were always there had very\nstrong baritone voices, and were always quarrelling and\nshouting, though the noise was as if dulled by some muting\nsubstance, as if I had had cotton wool in my ears. I think\nthis was a reminiscence of the response-chanting of two priests\nor alternate verse-reading heard at High Mass in Notre\nDame many years ago ;\nI have a good memory for voices,\nand have a keen appreciation of quality in the tones of ordinary\nspeech, and these two priests' voices dwell in my normal\nmemory still. Sometimes the two hallucinatory voices turned\ninto a hollow baritone rattling as of a nutmeg in a dry cocoa-\nnut shell, greatly magnified.\nOne curious experience was the vision of a man and woman\nqueerly dressed, standing in front of me, the man making\nrhythmic motions with his hands near my head, which was\n\fMAY, 1914. Fever Visions and Auditions. 239\naching badly. The couple wore feather headdresses, and colours\nof barbaric vividness in their clothes. The man had some sort\nof leather jerkin on, elaborately ornamented. I had the\nimpression that they were Aztecs or Incas, and that the man\nwas making magnetic passes to relieve my headache. I thanked\nthem cordially (mentally only, of course). I don't remember\nwhether the headache was relieved or not.\nP.S. Reading the account now, as I copy it (January, 1914),\nI am impressed by the obvious abnormality of everything, a fact\nwhich bears out Mr. Piddington's conclusions regarding the\ngeneric difference between \"\nvisceral\n\"\nand psychical hallucina-\ntions (Proceedings, Vol. XIX., p. 267 and foil). In all or\nnearly all the experiences, there was something which would\nhave served to distinguish the perception from reality, even if\nthe hallucination had involved other senses. If the creatures\nseen had become visible to the open eye, externalised in space\nand even apparently bearing special relation to external objects,\nand if they had spoken and touched me, I should still have\nbeen aware at least I think I should of their subjective\nnature. As long as any reasoning power remained, I should\nhave known that beings with three eyes and no nose could\nnot really be present in my bedroom. Mr. Piddington quotes\nmany cases from Dr. Head, of visceral hallucinations, which\nalmost always were of morbid type, bodies without legs, or\nother abnormalities of various kinds. Psychical hallucinations,\non the contrary, seem more like ordinary experience. They\ngenerally present no un-human or distorted features, and indeed\nare often mistaken for reality, when the surroundings permit.\nAfter writing the above, I happen to receive a letter from\nan artist friend who lives at a distance, and whom I had not\ntold about my hallucinations. He discusses his own visualising\nfaculty, which he has cultivated to a high degree of effectiveness,\nbut says that he sees his visualised objects only with closed\neyes, and cannot project them out into real space. Consequently\nthey always remain definitely subjective. On the auditory\nside, however, which he does not cultivate, he thinks he always\nhas tunes running in his head, though he hears them only\nwhen all is quiet, and they are almost indistinguishable from\nreal sounds.\n\"\nI find it possible to come far nearer to the\nillusion of objective hearing at will than I can to objective\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1914.\nseeing. . . . When all is quiet at night I can '\nhear\n'\nwell-known\nmelodies (sounding as though far away, but perfectly clear in\nevery note and inflexion) at will.\" He recognises that the\npulse-beat in head or ears supplies the basis of the rhythm,\nbut it often happens that he is annoyed by a misfit, some\nsolemn and stately music presenting itself, but having to go\nat a jiggy rate- He then changes it with an effort. But the\npoint is that in his normal experience, as in my abnormal one,\nauditory subjectivisms approach nearer to pseudo-objectivity\nthan the visual ones. I should expect it to be so in my own\ncase, for I am a poor visualiser and also short-sighted, and\nhave been more occupied with music than with pictorial art.\nBut the a priori probabilities in the case of my artist friend\nseem the other way.\nThe points in which my hallucinations agreed with those\nof visceral type described by Dr. Head, are :\nPartialness no legs or arms.\nBeardlessness of all faces (a curious fact, for which I\ncannot account).\nIndistinctness of sex : faces would do for either man or\nwoman.\nSpeechlessness the figures never spoke.\nDistortion or unpleasant expression.\nMy experiences differed, however, from the visceral type in\nincluding definite colours, and in causing no fear or start ;\nalso in the articulateness of the auditory phenomena. (\" Hal-\nlucinations of hearing, occurring in sane persons suffering from\nvisceral disease, are never articulate voices,\" Dr. Head, quoted\nat p, 306 of Mr. Piddington's paper just mentioned.)\nMy visual experiences were perhaps more nearly allied to\nillusions hypnagogigues than to hallucinations, being seen with\nshut eyes ; but, on the other hand, they seem psychologically\nmore allied to hallucinations proper, for the auditory phenomena\nwere definitely hallucinatory, and I never have illusions\nhypnagogiqiws in my normal state.\nNOTE.\nThe list of Members and Associates elected at the last Meeting\nof the Council, and the report of that Meeting and of the Private\nMeeting of the Society, on March 27th, 1914, are held over, for\nwant of space, until the next issue of the Journal.\n\fNo. CCCX.

SCHILLER, D.Sc.\nTHE chief article in the Archives de Psychologic, No. 52,\nDecember, 1913, is a clear and full report, by Dr. W.\nMackenzie of Genoa, on \"\nThe Problem of the Thinking Dog\nof Mannheim,\" who is alleged to perform intellectual feats\nthat excel the record of the celebrated Elberfeld horses. Dr.\nMackenzie not only describes his visit to Mannheim and three\nsittings with the dog in September last, but also gives a full\nhistory of the case.\nIts hero, Eolf, is a Mannheim lawyer's Airedale terrier, now\nabout three years old, who has been systematically educated by\nhis mistress (who is an invalid) to express his ideas and\nwishes by a code of taps, which he raps on a piece of card-\nboard with his left paw. This education was undertaken (in\nignorance of the\n\"\nthinking horse\n\"\nexperiments) in consequence\nof his behaviour one day in December, 1911, while Frau\nMoekel was giving an arithmetic lesson to her little daughter.\nThe girl having failed to add 122 + 2, her mother, to shame\nher, said,\n\"\nI am sure Eolf could do it better than you. Eolf,\n\f.i INK, 1914. On the So-Called Thinking Animal)*. 245\nwhat is 2 -f 2 ?\n\"\nWhereupon the dog is said to have tapped\nher four times on the arm. This led to the establishment of\na code of taps standing for letters (or syllables, the same\nnumber standing e.g. for\n\"\n1\n\"\nand \"\nel \"), which Rolf accepted\nand has since used consistently, only adopting the improve-\nment that a pause after a stroke makes it mean 10 instead\nof 1. By means of this code Rolf, who usually sits beside\nhis mistress on a chain lying loose in her lap (to prevent his\nrunning away from his \"work\"), is said to have given the\nmost incredible proofs of his animal intelligence. Not only did\nhe become so good at arithmetic that the children employed\nhim to do their sums for them, but he has shown himself\ncapable of lying and joking and displayed a sense of humour\nof a high order. For example, on one occasion he refused\nto\n\"\nwork,\" and on being asked why he would not, responded,\n\"doctor has forbidden.\" So he was told to propound a\nproblem to the lady who was visiting him. He promptly rapped\nout 9 + 5. The lady said \"13.\" Rolf rapped out \"No.\"\n\"14.\" \"No.\" \"15.\" \"No.\" \"\nWell, then, tell me yourself.\"\n\"14.\" \"But I said that too.\"\n\"\nTeazed.\" Finally the lady\nasked what she could do to please him, whereupon he spelt\nout w(o)d(o)ln (wag tail) !\nDr. Mackenzie discusses and denies the possibility of giving\nsignals to Rolf by pulling his chain, and carried out some\nexperiments which exclude this (if the conditions were as\nreported). He prepared four pictures, enclosed them in\nenvelopes and drew one out at random, but in such a way\nthat he believes that neither he nor Frau Moekel, nor any one\nelse, could have seen it, except Rolf. Under these conditions\non two successive days Rolf correctly described the picture\ndrawn each time. There were only four of these experi-\nments, but it happened that one of the pictures was drawn\ntwice ;\nit was described differently, as a square the first time,\nas a cube the second !\nAmong the performances of Rolfs which Dr. Mackenzie\nrelates at second hand, one of the best is his interview with the\nCatholic priests, who interrogated him as to his religious views,\nand found to their surprise and delight that he was perfectly\northodox ! On being asked, however, by his master where he\nhad got his theological knowledge from, he candidly replied,\n\"\nCatechism Fritz,\" and, according to another questioner, his\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1914.\npersonal views are by no means orthodox. Being asked\n\"\nWhat is an animal ?\n\"\nhe answered,\n\"\nPart of primary soul,\"\nand explained death as a return to this\n\"\nUrseele.\" His self-\nconsciousness would seem to be attested by the distinction he\nmakes between the name he is called (\"Kolf\" and that which\nhe calls himself, \"Lol\"), and altogether he is clearly a dog\nwho is a philosopher that would have delighted Plato, even\nthough the latter might not have approved of his denning the\nhighest good as\n\"\neating salmon.\"\nAs regards the theoretic interpretation of these results Dr.\nMackenzie is disposed to appeal to the\n\"\nunconscious mind\n\"\ntheory of Thomson Jay Hudson (whom he erroneously calls\nHouston), and it must be admitted that the evidence of spon-\ntaneous will and thought seems too strong to ascribe it either\nto any mode of signalling (conscious or unconscious) or to tele-\npathy. But psychical researchers, who are familiar with the\ndeceptiveness of appearances, will probably regard all such\ntheorizing as decidedly premature, until the facts themselves\nhave been established under more stringent and convincing con-\nditions, for it seems clear that so far the conditions have not\nsufficiently guarded against all the various sources of error\nthat beset psychical research. It is difficult to rule out all\nthe possibilities of conscious or unconscious deception. Moreover,\nthe type of experiment that has been tried with the\nrt\nthink-\ning animals\n\"\nof Germany is not particularly good : it is\nneither calculated to conciliate a hostile bias, such as the\nprofessorial class are bound to have, nor yet to persuade the\nopen-minded. For it is quite a mistake to consider mathematical\nproblems as the best and severest tests of intelligence merely\nas such. They are not tests likely to appeal most to the animal\nmind, and they are not particularly difficult to baffle by a\nsystem of signalling. On the contrary, supposing such to be the\nclue to the mystery, it would merely be necessary for the\nanimal to know the signal\n\"\nstop,\" in order to do his sum\nright, without understanding his answer at all. Nor can\nexperiments which depends on no one else's having the know-\nledge the animal produces ever be quite convincing. There\nwill always be a possibility that the investigator was mistaken\nin thinking that he had taken adequate precautions.\nWhat is wanted is that the animal should spontaneously\n\fJUNE, 1914. On the So-Called Thinking Animals. 247\n(tct on the knowledge presented to him, and so convince every\none that he understands its meaning. Professors Claparede and\nLarguier des Bancels, who append to Dr. Mackenzie's paper\na brief confirmation of the latter's results and a description of\ntwo seances they had with Rolf last December, in which they got\ntwo more successful picture tests, suggest a much better type\nof experiment, which they were unfortunately not able to try,\nbecause the dog fell ill. They argue that acts are better proofs\nof intelligence than words, and that as Rolf is supposed to be\ncapable of reading, he should be shown a placard stating that\n\"\nthere is\nsugar for you outside the door\n\"\n;\nif thereupon Rolf\ndemanded to be let out and proceeded to look for the sugar,\nno one could doubt that he had really understood the message,\nafter quite a few experiments.\nIn other words, the controversy which is now raging on the\nContinent as to the\n\"\nthinking\n\"\nof animals, and bids fair to con-\ntinue interminably, because it is treated as a religious question,\nand neither side studies the case of the other, cannot be settled\nby merely theoretic tests. The alleged\n\"\nthoughts\n\"\nof animals\nhave to be attested by their acts. This leads us back unex-\npectedly to the view that the real test of knowledge, and the\nseverest and most conclusive test to which knowledge can possibly\nbe subjected, is the pragmatic. Merely\n\"\ntheoretic\n\"\ntests always\nleave loop-holes for doubts ;\nbut there is no disputing that if the\nsupposed knowledge can be used to guide action, it must be\ngenuinely there. Thus, the whole dispute about animal thinking\ncould be ended, like so many other academic disputes, by\napplying the pragmatic test in half an hour. But the history\nof mankind shows that it is more likely, like the dispute about\nother forms of the supernatural, to continue to drag its weary\nlength across the centuries. Herr Krall and the friends of\nanimal thought will publish in the new Zcitsehrift, Tierscele,\nthey are devoting to the cause, all that tells in favour of\ntheir interpretation, and will invent a priori metaphysics from\nwhich it can be deduced : their opponents will continue to argue\na priori that the alleged facts cannot occur because they are\ncontrary to die Wissenschaft, and they have long taught this ;\nwhile, as one of them has already declared, the question of\nhow the trick is done, is\n\"\na fourth class problem\n\"\nunworthy\nof a truly scientific mind. And they will not go to see the\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1914.\nanimals. But 1 do not see why in this dispute the psychical\nresearcher should not be the tertius gaudens. Unlike the\northodox psychologist he has no prejudices to get rid of, and\nno scientific reputation to imperil; while, if the whole thing\nturns out to be but one more form of subtle illusion, he can feel\nthat he has at any rate learnt something from it. It is to be\nhoped, therefore, that our Society will join the Swiss psychologists\nin keeping a watchful eye on all these\n\"\nthinking animals,\"\nand lose no opportunity of investigating them that may present\nitself.\nA PSYCHO-ANALYST ON PSYCHICAL EESEAKCH.\nBy V. J. WOOLLEY, M.D.\nAN article bearing the attractive title,\n\"\nThe Freudian Psychology\nand Psychical Kesearch,\" by Leonard T. Troland, concludes the\neighth volume (No. 6, February-March, 1914) of the Journal of\nAbnormal Psychology. As the writer admits that his acquaint-\nance with the views of psychical researchers is\n\"\nrelatively super-\nficial,\" he to some extent disarms criticism, and one can only\nexpress regret that he did not carry his studies of the subject\nsomewhat deeper before committing himself on paper. He\nmight in that case have avoided among other things the state-\nment that\n\"\nthe proof of spiritism depends upon the ability\nof the individual to give a correct, unbiassed account of his\nown experiences.\" If there is one investigation more than\nanother which demands the most minute and detailed checking\nof the individual's experiences by outside evidence of every\nkind, it is perhaps psychical research, and it is mainly for that\nchecking that our Society exists. Another singular statement\nis that the\n\"\npsychical researcher finds in the visions of the\ndying an insight into the nature of life after death.\" It is\ntrue that various investigators have recorded such visions when\nthey were found to have been veridical, but such cases are no\nmore easy to account for on the Freudian hypothesis than on\nany other. If the visions are not capable of some kind of\ntesting in relation to known facts, they would seem to offer\nno scope for psychical research in the ordinary sense of the\nword.\nBut Mr. Troland does not feel any difficulty in settling the\n\fJUNK, 1914. A Psycho-Analyst on Psychical Research. 249\nwhole question.\n\"\nA casual examination,\" he says,\n\"\nof the\ncases cited in Myers' Hitman Personality leads the writer to\nbelieve that after we have eliminated those explicable by param-\nnesia and repressed information, the number of striking coin-\ncidences which remain will not be such as to do injustice to\nthe laws of probability.\" After that there does not seem to\nbe much more to say about Psychical Research, at any rate\nin relation to Mr. Troland, but as he claims some knowledge\nof Freudian Psychology, and does not in this case confess to\nany superficiality, it is interesting to consider what is his con-\nception of Freud's discoveries. This conception is so peculiar\nthat I do not feel that any summary by me would do him\njustice, and I must quote a few sentences in full :\n\"\nOn the basis of the Freudian hypothesis we should\nexpect that the most grossly immoral subconsciousnesses\nwould be possessed by those persons who in their supra-\nliminal activities are the most guileless ;\nconscientious\nclergymen when under the influence of their suppressed\ncomplexes should exhibit highly villainous tendencies. On\nthe other hand, rakes and cut-throats, when intoxicated or\ndreaming, should be pure-minded and gentle.\"\nAre we to understand that these expectations have been ful-\nfilled in Mr. Troland's experience, or is the statement an argument\nagainst the acceptance of what he believes to be the Freudian\nhypothesis ?\nApparently he wishes us to understand the former,\nas he goes on to argue that those persons who are usually\nconsidered to be the most impeccable witnesses are by reason\nof their uprightness the most to be suspected\n\"\nin so far as\nthe results in question are supposed to be dependent upon the\nsubliminal rather than the supraliminal self.\" I do not pro-\npose to enter here on any discussions of Freud's hypotheses :\nI can only say that, so far as I am aware, he has never put\nforward any view from which any deduction of this kind can\npossibly be made. With regard to the corollary concerning\ntrustworthy witnesses, it may be pointed out that, as a rule,\nin any psychical investigation, the evidence of the percipient\nor medium is the least important portion of the whole. What\nis much more considered is the evidence of other persons\nwho were told of the abnormal occurrence before any informa-\ntion could have reached the percipient in a normal way.\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1914.\nOn the question of experimental telepathy, the quite just\nbut not novel criticism is put forward that where the agent\nand percipient are in the same room, it is impossible to exclude\nunconscious auditory signals. This fact has mainly brought\nabout the abandonment of this type of experiment for some\nyears past, but Mr. Troland does not seem to have heard of\nthe later experiments, and no mention is made of the cross-\ncorrespondence scripts.\nHis final paragraph is an exhortation to psychical researchers\nto apply to all cases of hallucination the psycho-analytic method.\nHe believes\n\"\nthat a careful examination of the cases of veridical\nhallucinations already reported by the British and American\nSocieties would reveal the presence and determining activity\nof sexual factors.\" Whether this is so or not, it is, firstly, quite\ncertain that such a pre-formed belief would greatly impede a\ncorrect analysis. Secondly, it is difficult to see why a sexual\nor any other factor should determine a hallucination which is\nveridical, and it is this quality which alone interests the\npsychical researcher as such. Lastly, if Mr. Troland had the\nslightest idea of the difficulty of inducing any percipient to\ngive even the baldest written statement of his hallucination, he\nmight understand something of the obstacles which beset the\npath of a would-be psycho-analyst.\nThere is much valuable light to be thrown on the problems\nof psychical research from the psycho-analytic point of view,\nbut a superficial acquaintance with the literature of both subjects\nis an inadequate preparation for an illuminator.\nEEVIEWS.\nThe Purpose of Education. By ST. G. L. Fox PITT. (Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1913. 83 pp. Price 2s. 6d. net.)\nTHE object of this little volume, as summed up at its close, is to\npoint out that the teaching which urges less reliance upon\n\" the\nseen, the concrete, the physically tangible, and more upon the spiritual\nside of our nature,\" is \"in strict accord with the conclusions of\nrecent psychological research.\" In the Preface, one of its main\nobjects is said to be the indication of a path midway between those\nextreme views which exaggerate respectively the importance of the\ninner life and of the environment. And yet another object, less\n\f4\nII\nJvm, i'.M4. Reviews. 251\nexplicitly stated, is to denounce that short-sighted utilitarian outlook,\nwhich in education \"draws the circle premature, heedless of far\ngain.\" Such a denunciation seems indeed to be invited by the\npresent time, when this bad bargain is so often struck as a means\nto the end of \"getting and spending.\" The author's protest is\nnowise too strong, but would perhaps have been more effectively\nmade in language less elaborately technical. The word \"complex,\"\nfor instance, a term which, according to the definition on pages 4\nand 5, covers almost all mental processes, casts an obscurity over\nsome passages where its use, despite his apologies for it, might with\nadvantage have been avoided.\nThere is no ambiguity, however, about the expression of his belief\nthat our age suffers from many ills, a remedy for which must be\n41\nfound, and found solely, in sound educational methods\"; but which\nhave by their evil influence on education made its reform at once\ndifficult and indispensable. Prominent among these contemporary\nills we find an assumption\n\" that the '\nstruggle for life\n'\nis a financial\nstruggle pure and simple,\" based on the delusion that \"\nmoney is an\nuniversal power, meeting all human needs,\" and closely connected\nwith an excessive regard for reputation rather than character, resulting\nin \"a most deplorable waste of human energy in the vain attempt\nof individuals, groups, classes and nations to maintain their position\nin the eyes of the world.\" The effects upon education are obvious\nin its commercial aims and methods, always strictly personal and\nstrenuously competitive, in the substitution of lower for higher\nmotives and ideals, and in the common neglect to provide for any\nsystematic training of instincts and character.\n\"One of the most noticeable consequences of the neglect of such\nsystematic training is to be seen in the mental habit of impatience\nwith outward conditions ;\nthat exaggerated longing for the immediate\nemergence of tangible results from all efforts and actions, a longing\nwhich often finds expression in a futile and vulgar utilitarianism.\"\nThere is, in short, a tendency to the \"inversion of the proper relations\nof the inward and outward, of means and end, that is responsible\nfor the pernicious custom, widely prevalent, of neglecting, not to\nsay ignoring, the importance of character training.\"\nBut \"the difficulty of the educational problem, which presents\nitself when we endeavour to inculcate the superiority of character\nto reputation, lies in the fact that the early stages of child-development\ndepend so largely on the feeding and cultivation of the minor com-\nplexes, in which narrow egocentric thoughts aud feelings must\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1914.\nnecessarily predominate. The problem then assumes this form : How-\nare we to counteract these budding and multifarious egoisms in the\nminor complexes without destroying all incentives to effort ?\n\"\nThe\nsolution is thus stated :\n\" We have seen that by enlarging the field\nof vision and consciousness, complexes can be united, resolved, and\nco-ordinated, so extending the sphere of experience and volition,\nand that the real strength and greatness of individuality lies in the\ndirection of the impersonal. These are fundamental facts handed\ndown to us by the noblest traditions, and confirmed by experimental\npsychological research.\n\"The genuine understanding of these fundamental facts would\nlead to the remodelling and readjustment of our whole educational\nsystem. Competition as an incentive to effort (and incidentally as.\nthe great fostering cause of egoism) would be abolished. Punishment\nwould be mitigated. Bribes would disappear. Children would be\ndiscouraged from assimilating false ideals while their minds are young\nand plastic. Noble ideals would be placed before them, and we would\ncontrive by suitable examples and illustrations to make these appear\nreally interesting and attractive.\"\nAll this applies mainly to the ethical element in education. With\nreference to the much-needed \"awakening to some higher faith in\nthe purpose and destiny of individual existence,\" the author asks i\n\" How is this possible without a serious effort being made to intro-\nduce a really moral and religious atmosphere into popular education?\"\nHe clearly uses the word \"religious\" in the widest and least dogmatic\nsense ; yet, even allowing for this, the following statement, which\noccurs in the chapter on Religion, Ideals, and Conversion, seems\nsomewhat too sweeping :\n\" It may be confidently asserted that\npractically every individual, with scarcely any exception, has at some\ntime or another undergone distinct religious experiences. Experiences,\nthat is to say, which exalt the mind to a state of ecstasy ;\nand\nwhether it be the ecstasy of awe, of hope, or of rapture, such states\nof mind indicate for the individual his partial awakening to a per-\nception of the real meaning of the existence to which he has been*\nborn.\" Either the universality or the intensity of such experiences\nmust surely be overstated.\nIn the same chapter, too, occur some remarks about confession\nand confessors, which might at a first glance be misinterpreted ;\nthey resolve themselves, however, into the proposition that good\nadvice is useful and rare; a conclusion with which most people\nwill agree. JANE BARLOW.\n\fJUNE, I'.MI. Review*.\nAdventuring* in the \/'>\/\/\/\/\/\/>\/\/\/. By H. ADDINGTON UKUCE. (Little,\nBrown & Co., Boston, U.S.A., 1914. 313 pp. Price $1.35 net.)\nIN his new volume, Adventurings in the J'whirnl, Mr. Bruce pays\nour Society several handsome compliments, discounting their value,\nit is true, in some degree, by calling its members \"scientific ghostolo-\ngists,\" a hybrid title which they would hardly care to adopt, and by\nascribing to them achievements which they can, perhaps, not even\ncredit, much less claim. For instance, he considers it due to their\nlabours that \"\nphenomena hitherto regarded as mysterious and \"\nsuper-\nnatural\" such as apparitions, clairvoyance, crystal-gazing, etc. have\nbeen definitely explained on a purely naturalistic basis.\" Mr. Bruce\nis, however, a believer in the unlimited powers of Telepathy, by which\nhe apparently accounts for almost every kind of occult phenomenon,\nand it may therefore be as the actual discoverers of Telepathy, though\nnot indeed of its omnipotence, that the Society meets with such high\napproval. Naturally enough, in these circumstances, his study of an\nimportant branch of its researches, the automatic writing of Mrs. Piper,\nMrs. Verrall, Mrs. \"Forbes,\" and Mrs. \"Holland,\" leads him to the\nconclusion that \" there is nothing whatever in the evidence presented\nincompatible with the view that the cross-correspondences in question\nresulted from direct thought-transference between the automatists\nt\nthemselves.\" But his presentation of the case is\nmisleadingly in-\ncomplete, omitting as it does the later and more elaborate series\nof cross-correspondences, designed to minimise the probability,\nif not preclude the possibility, of any such thought-transference\nhypothesis.\nThe special purpose, however, of the author's \" review of the results\nof modern psychical research,\" is to demonstrate \"the exceedingly\npractical character of many of these discoveries, by which the world\nhas been a rich gainer.\" Amongst them the subconscious with the\ndiscovery of which he again associates the S.P.R. is a particularly\nvaluable asset. \"All successful men, whether a Milton or a Rocke-\nfeller, a Shakespeare or a Morgan, are men who have developed their\nsubconscious faculties by laborious application of their conscious powers\nin the routine of daily life.\" The mere grouping together of such a\nquartette of \" successful men \"\ncertainly speaks volumes for the vast\nrange and scope of this marvellous latent power. Apart from poetry\n^ind finance, its availability for the cure of mentally caused diseases\nis from a practical point of view extremely important; and the three\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The experiments were conducted in Tunisia by Monsieur\nLandesque, an engineer by profession and an amateur \" dowser.\"\nThe experiments may be divided into two parts :\n(a) Some experiments in regard to a water-conduit, the subject\nbeing a professional dowser. The water, according to Monsieur\nLandesque's report, was turned on and off without the dowser's\nnormal knowledge, and the pendulum, which he used instead of\na rod, invariably responded by swinging when there was water in\nthe conduit, and by remaining motionless when there was no water.\nMonsieur Marage points out the great importance in such experi-\nments of being absolutely certain that \" the dowser is\nguided neither\nby sight nor by sound nor by suggestion,\" and the desirability of\nconducting a large number of experiments.\n(b) Some experiments in divining natural springs in the open\ncountry. Monsieur Landesque was himself the subject in these\nexperiments, and met with considerable success.\nIn the Bulletin for January-April, 1914, there is a note by Dr.\nMarage on the result of some experiments which he tried as to the\neffect upon a dowser of an intermittent current of water, (a) in an\nunderground conduit, (b) in an open gutter on the surface of the\nground. Several dowsers, both professional and amateur, were tested\nin this way.\n\" When all precautions were taken to ensure that the\nsubject was not guided by any external sign,\" the results were such\nas chance might give ;\n\" but if there was the smallest suggestion,\nacting on the sight or the hearing, the experiment always sue\"\nceeded.\"\nThese results suggest the desirability of carrying out similar ex-\nperiments on a large scale, to determine, if possible, whether an\nartificial current does or does not affect persons apparently possessed\n\f1914.

A negative result would\nbe interesting, although one could not draw from it\nany definite\nconclusion as to the effect of natural currents ;\na positive result\nwould go far to prove the existence of a faculty for divining water,\nbecause the experiments, being conducted under known conditions,\nwould not be open to the objections which can be raised against\nexperiments in divining natural springs, where the conditions cannot\nbe so precisely determined.\nH.

But he is well aware that at present more ex-\nperiments are needed rather than theories.

F. C. S. SCHILLER, in the chair.\nTHE PRESIDENT delivered an address on \"Philosophy, Science,\nand Psychical Research,\" which will be published in the forth-\ncoming part of the Proceedings.\nA CASE OF STIGMATISM?\nIN the May Journal of this year we printed an account of\nsome stains observed on her feet by a correspondent referred\nto as Mrs. Walker ;\nit was suggested that these stains might\nbe due either to auto-suggestion, or to chromidrosis, or to a\ncombination of these two causes, and we invited further\nopinions on the case.\nIn response to this invitation we received the following\nletter from Sir Edwin Cooper Perry, M.D., Physician to the Skin\nDepartment at Guy's Hospital, who has been for some years\na member of this Society:\n\fJULY, 1014. A Case of St \/.'\/\/\/\"\n'\/ 6*771 \/ 251>\nGuy's Hospital, May 19, 1914.\nThere is, I think, a much simpler explanation than auto-\nsuggestion for the \"\ngreen marks\n\"\non Mrs. Walker's toes.\nIn November, 1899, I brought before the Dermatological Society\nof London a patient who presented a \"bluish-green discolouration\nof the skin between the toes,\" and, so far as I am aware, this was\nthe first reported case in England. The credit, however, of dis-\ncovering the cause of the condition rests with Dr. Arthur J. Hall,\nof Sheffield, who contributed a valuable paper on the subject to the\nBritish Journal of Dermatology in November, 1902.\nBriefly, the green, or blue-green, or peacock-blue, colour is due to\nthe staining of the epidermis by the aniline dye of the black\nstockings, which, as stated on p. 229 of the Journal of the Society\nfor Psychical Research for May, Mrs. Walker was wearing. The\nchange from black to green, or blue, is\nbrought about by acid\nsweat, and sweat thus altered in reaction may be found between\nthe toes, and in other situations where bacteria abound. The\nepidermis is dyed, and hence the colour cannot be removed by\nrubbing, or by the application of soap and water.\n[Signed] E. COOPER PERRY.\nIn Mrs. Walker's original report of her case the following\npassage occurs :\nl\n. . . That morning [December 11, 1913] on getting out of my\nbath, I noticed something odd about the small toe of my left foot,\nand found that there was a vivid green stain on the inside of\nevery toe, which no amount of rubbing would remove. Similar\nstains . . . also appeared on the right foot. . . . Before December 11\nI had been wearing brown stockings, new but already washed ;\nwhile some new black ones of the same set, put on afterwards\nby mistake without previous washing, dyed the soles of my feet\nslightly black without a tinge of green. Moreover that dye was\nimmediately removed by washing, whereas up to the date of writ-\ning (January 13, 1914) no amount of soap and water has made the\nslightest impression on the green stains . . .\nIt will be seen that if Mrs. Walker's recollections on January\n13, 1914, were correct, at the time when the green stains first\nappeared she was wearing brown stockings, and that, when she\nafterwards put on black stockings, she observed that these\nI\nstockings dyed her feet\n\"\nslightly black without a tinge of green\n\"\n1\nSee Journal, S.P.R. 1914, pp. 228 et seq.\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research. JULY, 1914\nand that the dye\n\"\nwas immediately removed by washing.\" We\nthereupon wrote to Sir Cooper Perry to ask whether we were\nright in understanding him to imply that, although the normal black\ncolour from the dye of stockings could be removed by washing,\nthe change brought about by acid sweat produces a colour which\ncannot be so removed, and also whether in his opinion the marks\nobserved on Mrs. Walker's toes could be made by the dye from\nbrown stockings as well as black. He answered the first\nquestion in the affirmative, and said that he was \"\nnot chemist\nenough to know whether there is any brown aniline dye which,\nbeing acted upon by sweat secretion, stains the skin blue. I\nhave never seen such a case, and so far as I know all reported\ncases have been in wearers of black socks or stockings.\" Sir\nCooper Perry also sent a water-colour sketch illustrating a\ncase of\n\"\naniline dermatitis\n\"\nwhich came under his observation\nin 1906, and is thus described:\nEdward H., aet. 15, attended in the Skin Out-Patient Department\nof Guy's Hospital under Sir Cooper Perry, in July, 1906, for Derma-\ntitis and Discoloration of the Feet, which had been present for seven\ndays. He was wearing black socks. The green discoloration was not\naffected by the application of water, alcohol, aether, or chloroform.\nThe Dermatitis rapidly subsided under treatment by Calamine Lotion.\nThe sketch shows that the discoloured patches are on the sole\nof the foot, also on the under surface of each toe and between\nthe toes ;\nthe colour is bluish green.\nDr. Hall, in the article to which Sir Cooper Perry refers\n(see British Journal of Dermatology, 1902, pp. 418 d seq.)\ndescribes several cases of\n\"\nblue toes\n\"\nwhich have come under\nhis observation. In one of these cases, that of a married woman\nof thirty, who came to Dr. Hall to be treated for rheumatism,\nthe stains are described as being between the toes, hardly visible\non the upper surface, but conspicuous when the toes were pulled\napart, a condition very similar to that which Mrs. Walker\nobserved in her own case. Dr. Hall concludes :\nI have no doubt whatever that the cases of blue toes I have seen\nare due to the same cause viz. a blue aniline dye much used in\nthe manufacture of cheap (certainly black, possibly also other coloured)\nstockings. It is dissolved by acid sweat. It dyes the epidermis to\nsome depth in those parts which are moist and warm and the chief\nsweat-producers. It has nothing whatever to do with Chromidrosis\nor Bacteriological Decomposition or Hysteria.\n\f1914 A Case of S7 \/',\/,\/\/ fism? 261\nDr. Hall also states that in his experience discolouration of\nthis kind is usually found in the case of people who have moist\nfeet, who do not wash their feet often, and who wear cheap\nblack stockings.\nSir Cooper Perry states that in this matter his\n\"\nexperi-\nence is in accordance with Dr. Hall's.\" Dr. V. J. Woolley,\nwho kindly made some enquiries about dyes on our behalf, writes\nas follows :\nJuly 12, 1914.\nCheap black stockings are usually dyed with Aniline Black, which\nis easily changed by a reducing agent into Aniline Green. I think\nthat this must be the cause of the condition described by Sir Cooper\nPerry. Brown stockings are almost certainly dyed with a dye called\na Widal dye, and a reducing agent would change the colour of this,\nbut I do not know to what. But the change would probably be much\nmore difficult than in the case of the black ones.\n[Signed] V. J. WOOLLEY.\nOn receipt of Sir Cooper Perry's letter of May 19, 1914,\nwe wrote again to Mrs. Walker informing her of the suggested\nexplanation of the case, and asking whether she could make any\nfurther and more precise statement as to the kind of stockings\nshe was wearing before December 11, 1913, the day upon\nwhich the stains were first observed. Mrs. Walker replied as\nfollows :\nMay 24, 1914.\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th, received to-day : To the best\nof my recollection I did not wear any of the new black stockings\nbefore Dec. llth, 1913. They were a new set brought from England,\nand so far as I remember I did not change to woollen stockings till\nearly in December. As I have said, the stain from the black ones\nwas on the soles of the feet, and washed out easily. While the\nstains lasted I wore all sorts of different stockings, some new, some\nold (the new ones were always washed first, with the one exception\nmentioned), some black, some brown. But the colour of the stains\nnever varied, although the area did, until they began gradually to\nfade as my husband got better. I always have to be very careful\nabout my footwear, and put on clean stockings nearly every day (in\nsummer often twice a day), because, like so many rheumatic people,\nI find my feet inflame if the least little perspiration dries on them.\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1914.\nThis inflammation varies from light pink to red, and gets intolerably\nirritating in hot weather if I miss my daily bath. I have been subject\nto this discomfort for years : hence my especial care of my feet. It\ncomes between the toes and on the instep only.\nI don't think my feet perspired at all certainly not appreciably\nwhile the stains lasted, except on the one occasion mentioned. [See\nJour. S.P.B., 1914, p. 232.] As I say, I am always painfully aware\nwhen they do. I am now using methyl salicyl for the irritation,\nour hot weather having set in ;\nbut I don't think I began to apply\nthis until the stains had almost or quite disappeared. I had no\nirritation worth mentioning until about the middle of April. This\ndrug was recommended to me for my arthritic hands, and I find it\nkeeps the redness and irritation of the feet fairly under control.\nI began to wear white stockings and black canvas shoes early in\nApril. When for any reason I have to put on black ones I now\nlook carefully to see if any colour comes. So far there has not been\n.a sign, although the last time I had to wear black stockings and\nkid shoes, for a public function, it was oppressively hot and every\none was perspiring visibly. . . .\n[Signed] E. M. WALKER.\nIt will be seen from this statement that, as might have been\nexpected, Mrs. Walker could not clearly remember in May\nprecisely on what date in the previous December she had first\nworn the new black stockings. The clearest evidence we have\non this point is Mrs. Walker's original statement of January 13,\n1914, which clearly implies that the black stockings were worn\nonly after the stains had been observed on December 11, 1913.\nAssuming this to be so, Mrs. Walker's case differs in several\nimportant respects from those observed by Sir Cooper Perry\nand Dr. Hall. Not only are the black stockings wanting, but\nit will be seen from Mrs. Walker's letter, published above, that\non account of her rheumatic tendency she is unusually punc-\ntilious in the care of her feet. It should also be noted that a\npurely physical cause does not seem to account for the recru-\ndescence of the symptoms just at the time of Mrs. Walker's\n.renewed anxiety about her husband's health (see Jour. S.P.R.,\n1914, p. 232).\nOn the other hand, it must be admitted that the symptoms\nobserved by Mrs. Walker are very similar to those which have\nbeen ascribed to aniline dye, and the fact that she is rheumatic\n\fJULY 1914. A Case of Stiymatism? 263\nperhaps increases the likelihood of this explanation, since it is\nthe acidity of the sweat which acts upon the dye of the stock-\nings, and two of the cases reported by Dr. Hall were rheumatic\nsubjects.\nPerhaps the strongest evidence against the supposition\nthat the stains were due to dye from the stockings, is\nthe fact that Mrs. Walker has never observed any similar\nstains either before or since. If we suppose that she was\n.mistaken in thinking that she had not worn the new black\nstockings before the stains were observed, we might possibly\nexplain the production of an effect unique in Mrs. Walker's\nexperience by the fact that\n\"\nby mistake,\" i.e., contrary to her\nusual habit, she put on these new stockings\n\"\nwithout previous\nwashing\" (see above, p. 259). Could it be that, in the process\nof washing, some of the less\n\"\nfast\n\"\nelements of the dye are\n.removed, and therefore unwashed stockings are more likely to\n>be affected by the action of the sweat ?\nIf any of our members can throw light on the question as\nto whether it is likely that the dye from brown stockings\nmight produce the symptoms observed in Mrs. Walker's case,\nwe should be glad of further information on this point. Mean-\nwhile, as the evidence stands now, and unless Mrs. Walker\nshould have some further experience to report, we cannot draw\nany definite conclusion. On a priori grounds, a simple physical\nexplanation must be given precedence over one which assumes\nyet the existence of an unknown psychical factor, but it is not\ncertain that a simple physical explanation will meet the facts.\nAN INQUIEY INTO SPIRITUAL HEALING.1\nA SUMMARY.\nA CONFERENCE of representatives of the clerical and medical\nprofessions was held at the Chapter House, St. Paul's, in\nOctober, 1910, to discuss the alleged results and the rapid\ndevelopment of\n\"\nspiritual\n\"\nand \"\nfaith\n\"\nhealing movements,\nand a Committee was appointed to consider and report upon\nthe best method of closer co-operation between the two pro-\n1\nSpiritual Healing.

At a second conference, held in October, 1911, the\nprovisional conclusions of this Committee were unanimously\nadopted, and an enlarged, standing Committee was appointed :\n(a) To continue investigations into the meaning and\nscope of\n\"\nSpiritual,\"\n\"\nFaith,\" and \"\nMental\n\"\nhealing ;\n(b) To consider how the dangers connected with such\ntreatment by persons not medically qualified might best\nbe guarded against ;\nand\n(c) To promote all legitimate co-operation between the.\ntwo professions.\nThe members of this Standing Committee are :\nThe Dean of Westminster (Chairman), Sir Dyce Duckworth\n(Vice-Chairman), Sir Clifford Allbutt, the Kev.

A. Ormerod, Sir E. Douglas Powell, and\nDr. Howard Tooth.\nThe witnesses, all of whom had personally practised, or\nmade a study of, the treatment of physical disorders by\nspiritual or mental influences, include Dr. J. Milne Bramwell,\nDr. C. Lloyd Tuckey, Dr. M. B. Wright, and the Eev. Samuel\nMcComb, one of the founders of the Emmanuel movement in\nAmerica.\nEvidence was taken in reply to formulated questions, and\na considerable number of cases treated by spiritual healing\nwere also brought to the notice of the Committee. The\nalleged diseases thus treated include cancer, cirrhosis of liver,\nenlargement of thyroid gland, arthritis, hip disease, Eaynaud's\ndisease, angina pectoris, secondary haemorrhage,\n\"\nswelling of\nlegs,\" pneumonia, toxaemia, abscess of liver, erysipelas, dysentery,\nconjunctivitis, dipsomania and other vicious habits, epilepsy,\nblindness, deafness,\n\"\nmuscular paralysis,\" neuritis, sclerosis,\ntetanus,\n\"\nbrain fever,\"\n\"\nparalysis of bowel,\" asthma, neuras-\nthenia and other nervous conditions.\nIn the majority of these cases no medical evidence was\nobtainable, the only confirmation as to the nature of the\n\f,1914.

In no instance of a so-called\n\"\nincurable\n\"\ndisease\nwas medical evidence fortlu nmin.u to confirm any cure by\nspiritual or mental healing.\nThe cases in which it was possible to obtain medical evidence,\nboth before and after treatment, are six in number. In the\nfirst case, viz., secondary haemorrhage after excision of tonsils,\nthe haemorrhage ceased after the patient received Holy Unction,\n\"\nbut the doctor in attendance ascribed it to a natural\n'\ncessation\nof the bleeding from the faintness allowing the blood to co-\nagulate and form a clot.'\n\"\nIn the second case, i.e., malignant tumour of the thyroid gland,\n\"\nspiritual healing was not the only treatment used, as radium\nwas applied twice for periods of five days ;\nand there was\nmarked reduction in the size of the superficial growth each\ntime. But the patient died of the disease in a few weeks,\nnotwithstanding the temporary diminution in the external signs.\"\nThe third case was one of partial paralysis of the muscles\nof the arm of five years' standing. The patient received treat-\nment for an hour a day for ten days,\n\"\nand felt considerably\nbetter as regards his\n'\nnerve tone\/ and he thought there was\nsome increase of power in the hand. When examined some\nthree months after this treatment, the muscles of the arm\nwere still wasted and partially paralysed.\"\nIn the fourth case, which was one of severe and prolonged\ntoxaemia, although\n\"\nthe patient dated her improvement from\nthe time of the Anointing, the doctor in attendance believed\nthat there was '\nno deviation from the normal and recognised\ncourse in the recovery\/\n\"\nIn the fifth case, which was one of enlargement of the\nthyroid gland, the patient is stated to have been well a few\ndays after treatment, but\n\"\nthe doctor in attendance considered\nthat\n'\nthe causes of the swelling were of a temporary character\/\nand that the thyroid gland quieted down and the swelling\ndisappeared, as is frequently the case.\"\nThe sixth was a purely hysterical case of self-inflicted sores.\n\"\nThe mental effect of treatment by the Spiritual healer led to\na cessation of the self-inflicted wounds, and to the disappear-\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The illness had been\nreported to the Committee as\n'\na very rare and incurable\ndisease with partial insanity.'\n\"\nThe Committee affirm that the operation of the Divine\npower can be limited only by the Divine will, but they believe\nthat it is exercised in conformity with, and through the\noperation of natural laws. They are of opinion that the\n;physical results of what is called\n\"\nfaith\n\"\nor\n\"\nspiritual\n\"\nhealing are not different from those of mental healing or healing\nby\n\"\nsuggestion\n\"\n;\nand they recognise that suggestion is more\neffectively exercised by some persons than by others, and this\nfact may explain the special\n\"\ngifts\n\"\nclaimed by various healers.\nThey are forced to the conclusion that\n\"\nfaith\n\"\nor\n\"\nspiritual\n\"\nhealing, like all treatment by suggestion, can be permanently\neffective only in cases of functional disorders, and they emphasise\nthis point in order to warn those who resort to\n\"\nHealers\n\"\nin\nthe hope of receiving a permanent cure that they may thereby\nbe postponing until too late the medical treatment which might\nserve to arrest organic disease.\nWJrile recognising the value of spiritual ministrations as a potent\nmeans of suggestion, they strongly deprecate the independent\ntreatment of disease by irresponsible and unqualified persons.\nThe Committee hope to continue to collect evidence, and\nwill be glad to have further cases brought to their notice.\nWith each case they ask for a diagnosis by a medical practitioner,\nbefore treatment, with a short history of the signs and symptoms ;\nan account of the treatment carried out, with dates and other\ndetails ;\nand a medical examination, after treatment, by the\nsame doctor if possible, with a detailed account of the changes\nwhich have taken place.\nThe Eeport contains a summary of the evidence of various\nwitnesses, and a Note on Suggestion by Sir E.

ED.]\nTHE \"\ntrumpet-medium,\" Mrs. S. Harris, at the invitation of a\nlittle society in the Hague, called\n\"\nVereeniging voor Psychisch\n\f.7i i. v, 1914. Th< Trumpet-Medium, Mrs. S. Harris. 267\nOndereozk\" (Society for Psychical Research), held several seances\nin Holland between March 31 and April 16, 1914. These\nseances soon aroused the suspicion of some participants, and at\nlast the\n\"\nmedium\n\"\nwas exposed at a stance at Amsterdam, on\nApril 16. A leader of the spiritists in Holland, Mr. H. N. de\nFremery, gave a description of this exposure in Het Vaderland\n('Hie Fatherland, a newspaper of the Hague), of April 20,\nand in Hct Lcven (The Life, an illustrated periodical), of\nApril 21. Nevertheless, the \"stalwart spiritualists\" main-\ntained that Mrs. S. Harris was a genuine medium, and almost\nthe whole number of Hct Toekomstig Levm (TJie Future Life, a\nspiritistic periodical), of May 1, was consecrated to prove this.\nThe writer of the present article, having attended the\nseance of April 2, tries in the following to prove as clearly\nand shortly as possible, by means of personal observations and\ntin appendix, that there is no reason at all to ascribe to\nMrs. S. Harris any supernormal faculty.\n(1) Dark seances, without good control and for money's\nsake, should be a priori considered as fraudulent.\n(2) There is almost complete darkness at these sittings,\nand no good control at all, and, as a rule, the participant\nmust pay 5 fl.\n(8s. 3d.), there being almost twenty persons at\na seance.\n(3) The loud singing (by preference of merry songs), and\nthe circumstance that the sitters must have almost always\ntheir hands on their knees, favour trickery.\n(4) The voice of Harmony (the so-called control-spirit)\nsounds like the voice of a ventriloquist. I did not hear two\nvoices simultaneously (cf. Appendix 1).\n(5) In the sitting I attended, very little Dutch was spoken.\nWords like\n\"\nVader\n\"\n(father) prove nothing (cf.

Harris was called by some papers, e.g. Het\nLeven (The Life), of April 21, p. 490, a\n\"\nswindler,\" but she\ndid not answer the accusation.\nAPPENDIX.\n1. Mr. H. N. de Fremery in his article in Het Vader-\nland (The Fatherland} of April 20 writes, inter alia, the following :\nMrs. Harris brought with her to her seances three tin speaking-\ntrumpets, each divided into three parts which screwed into each\nother. At the bottom they were about 4 inches wide and at the\nmouth-piece about J an inch in width and, I should think, about\n3 ft. 3 in. long. Through those trumpets there resounded in the\npitch-dark at one time a man's deep voice and at another time a\nfew words whispered in English or in German and sometimes a\nfew words in Dutch. Those were called the \"direct spirit voices,\"\nand it was said that the inhabitants of the astral sphere, thanks to\nMrs. Harris's mediumistic power, were enabled to reveal themselves\nto mortals on earth.\nWell, on the 9th of April last, at a meeting which I attended in\nthe Odeon Hall in Amsterdam, I was asked to hold Mrs. Harris's\nleft hand. I did so and it remained in my right hand quietly the\nwhole evening. When I heard the trumpet voices, I made up my\nmind to find out whether, perchance, there was any connection\nbetween them and the medium. In order that what follows may\nbe clearly understood, it should be said that, in addition to those\nvoices, there was a falsetto voice to be heard as well, which, it was\nsaid, was produced by Mrs. Harris's deceased daughter\n\"\nHarmony.\"\nThe falsetto voice and the trumpet voice kept up a lively and by\nno means unamusing dialogue. Nevertheless, I never heard them\nsimultaneously. Availing myself of the pitch darkness, I placed\nmy right ear close to Mrs. Harris's shoulder and by so doing could\nl\nl must add that I do not consider palmistry as a science.\n\fJULY, 1914. The Trumpet-Medium, Mr. S. ll< 269\ndistinctly follow her breathing. Well, this kept regular time with\nthe voices heard. When the trumpet voice sounded I recognised\nMrs. Harris's voice, which I cannot describe better than by callini\/\nit an \"\ninternal grunt,\" caused by jerks through the central aperture\nof compressed lips. These sounds invariably accompanied the\ntrumpet voice. If there were prolonged sounds, then a deep breath\nwas drawn, whereupon the falsetto voice followed. My discoveries\nconvinced me that those \"direct spirit voices\" had nothing what-\never to do with the inhabitants of the astral sphere, but were pro-\nduced by Mrs. Harris herself.\nMy convictions were proved up to the hilt at the meeting in the\npitch dark which I attended yesterday evening, April 16. Mr. G.\nJ. De Bruin was then invited to hold Mrs. Harris's left hand.\nShortly before this I had told him my impressions. He did just\nwhat I had done, and agreed with me entirely.\nBut there is still more. One of the audience, Mr. I. Richter,\nhidden by the darkness, crept on hands and knees to the spot\nwhere he had seen Mrs. Harris put the three trumpets down. Two\nof them were still\nstanding on the floor and he took them away to\nhis place, the third trumpet was evidently being used, for the\ntrumpet voice was repeatedly heard while Mr. Richter carried out\nthis piece of cunning. But not one of the so-called manifesting\nspirits had observed this. Surely, if they had been real spirits who\nwere using the trumpets, they must have noticed that they had\nbeen deprived of the instruments for making their manifestations,\nand certainly would not have neglected to complain of it, as there\nwas still the third trumpet at their disposal. But Mr. Richter\nhimself disclosed what he had done. Then I heard the third\ntrumpet drop on the floor.\nThe disclosure, of course, occasioned great consternation, but the\nlights were not turned on until Mrs. Harris gave her permission.\nShe was wise enough not to say a word, but she seemed to be very\nmuch disconcerted.\nThe lady who had held Mrs. Harris's right hand informed me, in\nreply to my inquiry, that that hand had again and again been removed\nfrom her left hand, arid for a long time.\nMr. Bruin said that frequently he had not been able to discover\nwhere the left, foot of the medium was, on feeling for it with his\nright foot, but that Mrs. Harris's left hand had been firmly held in\nhis right hand the whole evening.\nIt is not necessary to set forth what facilities absolute darkness\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1914.\nafford to any one who wishes to \"make music,\" and to that end\nhas at his disposal from time to time the use of a right hand, and,\nmoreover, a mouth, two feet, and three trumpets of fully three feet\nin length.\nMr. Marcellus Emants, the well-known Dutch author, writes\nin Het Toekomstig Leven (The Future Life), of June 15, 1914,\np. 220, about a seance which he attended:\nI have not even once perceived that two voices spoke simul-\ntaneously. They sounded sometimes quickly after each other, but never\nabsolutely simultaneously.\n2. Mr. Marcellus Emants, too, cannot remember to have\n\"perceived anything of Dutch-speaking spirits,\" and he adds\nthe following, which is rather suspicious :\n\"It is true that a German announced himself with a few German\nwords, who rarely or never seems to fail at the seances of Mrs. S.\nHarris; this time he was called Professor Siebold of Munich. For\nwhom he came I do not know.\"\n3. Mr. Marcellus Emants writes in the article mentioned\nabove, page 219:\n\"The first to whom a spirit (whose *?) spoke, was I. The spirit,\nwho called me professor\n1\nsaid that in my life something had happened\nwith Paladino. This may seem astonishing, but it becomes childish\nwhen one knows that before the seance began when the door to\nthe other room was open I had spoken aloud with a lady about a\nseance with Eusapia Paladino. And this childishness is not removed\nby the circumstance that the spirit, when I simply asked \"Where?\"\ndropped the trumpet, while the control (spirit) indignantly declared\nthat I was not allowed to ask questions, because this betrayed distrust.\"\nNOTES ON CUKKENT PERIODICALS.\nTHE Archives de Psychologie, No. 5-1 (May, 1914), contains a study\nof the value of testimony by H. Lelesz. A picture was shown for\none minute and the witnesses had thereupon to answer a long\nquestionnaire. The result, viz., that of the four mental types re-\ncognized, the intelligent, the descriptive, the interpreters, and the\nsuperficial, the order of merit is as stated, will not excite surprise.\n1\nThis was not correct. K. H. E. de J.\n\fJULY, i-.tu Notes on Current Periodical- 271\nDr. Ch. Odier narrates a case of the hysterical contraction of a\nFrench girl's left leg, and interprets it on (essentially) Freudian lines.\nThe girl had been engaged to a friend of her brother's, a young officer,\nand been much distressed when his behaviour led to the breaking off\nof the engagement. Two years later her brother broke his leg in\na motor accident, and while she was nursing him she unexpectedly\nmet again her former fianct. Two years later still, the hysterical\ncontraction appeared and lasted for 9 months. The explanation\ngiven is that these events set up an unconscious \"complex,\" the\nargument of which was \"\nmy former Jiuncc came back to my brother\nwhen he had broken his leg, this (the left) leg was motionless;\ntherefore, if my leg too grows motionless, my fianct will come back\nto me.\"\nDr. E. Partos has an instructive note on the compilation of the\nevidence that seemed to bear out Prof. Abderhalden's theory of\nthe \"\nsero-diagnostic\n\"\nof diseases. It appears to have closely re-\nsembled the famous case of the N-rays, and illustrates the power of\nsuggestion in scientific experimentation.\nLastly, Prof. Claparede reviews a number of German works on\nthe \"thinking animals,\" in which he does not fail to bring out the\ncurious facts that hardly any of the opponents of \"Krallismus\" have\nbeen to see the animals whereas their supporters nearly all have,\nand that von Maday naively confesses that what instigated his protest\nwas the way in which KralPs book, coming out shortly after, dis-\ntracted public attention from his own. It appears also that good results\nhave been obtained with the horses by the experimenters alone,\nand in the absence of Herr Krall and his groom, and that a new\nacquisition, the mare Jon a, has learnt to do 1-figure additions and\nsubtractions after five weeks' instruction. Prof. Claparede's sensible\nconclusion is that the questions of fact cannot be solved by dialectics,\nbut only by going to Elberfeld and Mannheim. However, there\nought to be a number of people trying to educate their dogs on\nGerman lines, and to verify the Mannheim results.\nF. C. S. S.\nThe Neue Rundschau for June, 1914, has an interesting 39 pp.\narticle by Maeterlinck on the Elberfeld horses. He very candidly\nconfesses his initial bias, and states that before going to see them\nhe had been wholly convinced by the reports of their performances,\nand also that subliminal telepathic transfer from the human to the\nequine mind seemed to him the only acceptable hypothesis. He then\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1914.\ngives a lucid and amusing account of his own experiences, including\nMukamed's refusal to extract an impossible root of a number which\nin his mathematical ignorance Maeterlinck had written on the board\nat random. To test the telepathic hypothesis he tried a number\nof experiments, of which the answers were not known to him or\nany one present, and found that the horses answered as correctly\nas when the answers were known. Pfungst's theory of the reaction\nof the animals to unconscious signals having been disproved by the\nlater developments, M. Maeterlinck betakes himself to the suggestion\nthat some animals, e.g. horses, dogs, and cats (but not elephants and\nmonkeys), are natural \"psychics,\" and so can tap subliminally what\nProfessor James called a great \"cosmic reservoir,\" in which all know-\nledge i.s conserved. He consequently compares the calculating horses\nwith the calculating boys, who also (usually) answer intuitively and\ninstantaneously and without knowing how they perform their feats.\n(It would seem to follow that Balaam's Ass may have been an animal\n4\npsychic\n'\nof this sort, and that her scientific rehabilitation is approach-\ning.) It will be interesting, however, to see whether experimental\nconfirmation of this mystical hypothesis can be obtained, and also\nwhether any of the many philosophers who profess to hold it on\ntheoretic grounds will take any steps to verify it practically.\nF.

STKATTON.\n[Mr. Stratton, of Cains College, Cambridge, to whom we are\nindebted for the following report, has been for some years an Associate\nof this Society. He is also an active member of the Cambridge\nUniversity S.P.R., at a meeting of which this report was read.\nAt the request of the various people concerned in the case,\npseudonyms have been used here, and the name of the house\nalleged to be haunted is not given. But all the original docu-\nments, together with names and addresses, are in our possession.\nThe case is typical of a certain class of\n\"\nhaunted\n\"\nhouses, those\nin which the manifestations consist mainly of unaccountable noises.\nIts chief interest lies in the fact that the report includes first-hand\nnarratives from several witnesses, ivhich it is useful to compare.\nSome of the witnesses do not appear to have known at the time of\ntheir earlier experiences that there was anything unusual about the\nhouse, and it is noteworthy that these, so to speak, unbiassed experi-\nences are of a less remarkable character than those reported by\npersons to whom the supposed\n\"\nhaunting\n\"\nof the house was well-\nknown, showing that, as might be expected, allowance must be made\nfor the force of suggestion.\nIt is unfortunate that the house has now been turned into a\nvillage club and partly pulled down, so that no further investigation\nis possible, and, as Mr. Stratton himself says at the end of his\nreport, the case\n\"\nmust for the present rest as one more piece of\nevidence awaiting explanation, and icaiting also to take its share in\nthe building up of a general theory of haunting\"\nReports of somewhat similar cases and comments on them will be\nfound in Jour. S.P.R., Vol. V., pp. 331-352, The Haunted House\nat Willington, and Proc. S.P.R., Vol. X, pp. 34,0 \/., Eeport on\nthe Census of Hallucinations : Noises in\n\"\nHaunted\n\"\nHouses.\nED.]\nTHE house concerned in the following narrative is a country\nhouse about a hundred years old in a Midland village.\nNothing is known of any previous history of haunting, nor is\nanything known of any past happenings in the house which\nwould, according to ordinary superstitions, suggest cause for\n\f. 1914. The Haunting of\n- - Houne. _ < .\">\nthe unpleasant experiences which befell the late tenants. And\nyet during the past twelve years, Mr. and Mrs. Long\n(pseudonym) bought the house and lived in it from April,\n1901, to June, 1913, there have been few lengthy intervals\nof respite from a steady flow of curious and unexplained\nhappenings. The written statement from Mrs. Long upon\nwhich the following account is based was obtained for me in\nJuly, 1913, by a mutual friend, Mr. C. Sayle, of the University\nLibrary, Cambridge. Mrs. Long also obtained six accounts\nfrom her husband, various occupants of the house and visitors.\nThese accounts are given below, and they confirm in detail\nthe second-hand statements of their experiences previously sent\nto me by Mrs. Long herself. Mrs. Long's own account was\nbased on a diary which towards the end of the time was\nwritten up every day with details of her own experiences and\nthat of the servants.\nThe second part of Mrs. Long's account gives a very good\nidea of the frequency and of the general nature of the\nphenomena, at any rate for the last few months in the house.\nIt also shows that the more unusual of the experiences fell\nto the lot of the servants of the house. With regard to that\ntwo comments should be made. The first experiences, so far\nas is known, came to Mrs. Long. Later on her husband and\nher children shared in them. But it was not until they had\nbeen forced to the conclusion that there was something super-\nnatural about the place that they took the servants into their\nconfidence. They had, not unnaturally, been unable to keep\nservants for any length of time, but in the end Mrs. Long\nfound it preferable to explain the state of affairs to servants\nafter they had been with her for a short time, if she\nwanted to keep them. During the last six months, when\nthe phenomena were most insistent, the same four servants\nall of a trustworthy nature and with good references stayed\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Long through what was certainly a very\ntrying experience for them all.\nThe house has now been sold and taken over as a village\nclub-house; it has already been partly pulled down. Nothing\nhas apparently leaked out into the village about the phenomena\nin the house, and this, if a fact, is not without its bearing\non the question of the steadiness and trustworthiness of the\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The Haunting of\n- House. 277\nto Mr. and Mrs. Long, and I add to their accounts a\nshort notice which is largely based on answers to my\nquestions.\nThe following is Mrs. Long's account. In the first part\nhas been included several stories told me in detail by Mr. and\nMrs. Long three days ago.\n1\nAlso, parts of her story repeated\nin other accounts have been omitted here.\nMRS. LONG'S ACCOUNT.\n(1) My husband and I and children lived in the beautiful old\nvillage of .\nFinding our house too small for us, in 1900 we\nbought a larger house which was quite near to where we first lived.\nSoon after buying it my husband was ill, and in the year 1901 he\nwas ordered abroad for six months. I therefore went to our new\nhome in April, 1901, by myself with the children and servants. The\nhouse, a long two-storied one, was about 90 years old with a\ndelightful old garden. Every one who had lived there before we\nwent seemed attached to the place and there was no story of any\ndescription in connection with it.\nSoon after I went to the house, I was writing a letter one even-\ning in the day-nursery about nine o'clock. Both doors were open.\nSuddenly, in the piece of landing by the archway, I heard a loud\nbang, as if some one had dropped a dumb-bell on to the ground. I was\nterrified, and rushed through the door to the top of the stairs and\ncalled the servants, who were having supper. They all came up\nimmediately and hunted everywhere, but could find nothing to\naccount for it. A few days later I was wakened in the middle of\nthe night by several rappings against the outside wall of my room,\nnear the ceiling. I was very frightened, as I felt that unless some\none was standing below and had an enormously long stick reach-\ning nearly to the roof, it could not have been done. The same\nthing happened several nights and I had little sleep.\n2\nWe also\nheard the dropping noise very often.\nA few weeks later a friend came to stay with me, but I did not\ntell her of our experiences. One morning I went into her room\nbefore she was up, and she told me she had never been so\n1\nMy visit to Mr. and Mrs. Long was on September 30, 1913. This account\n-was written out on October 3, 1913. F. J. M. S.\n2\nThe account of these rappings reached Mr. Long on his way back home\nfrom New Zealand, and were the first he heard of the business.

OCT. -Nov.\nfrightened in her life, that at 12 midnight the night before she\nhad just put out her light when there was the most terrific bang\nby the side of her bed. She was petrified for a minute, and\nthen lighted her candle, expecting to find that some picture or\nsomething had fallen. She looked everywhere, but everything was\nin its usual place. I may say that, as a rule, she did not know\nwhat nervousness meant.\nHaving had no ghostly experiences hitherto, it was a long time\nbefore we allowed ourselves to think there must be something\nuncanny about the house. However, as time went on, we were\nobliged to recognize the fact. About every two or three nights\nwe awoke without knowing why, and then we would hear some one\nwalk down the landing and hear the swish of her skirts, and she\nwould walk past our door, creak a board, as it were, and go on\ndown the front-stairs, and sometimes we would hear a voice. In\nthe day-time we tried to make a board creak outside our door\nbut never succeeded. Other nights we would hear voices close\nup against the window, some one moving about in the room\nbeneath us, the sound as of a ladder put against the window and of\nsome one climbing up very heavily, and sometimes we would also\nhave our door-handle turning slowly in the middle of the night.\nThe strange part of it was that we always woke suddenly, feeling\nvery frightened, and then heard something. We all heard several\ntimes the sound as if heavy boxes were being dragged all over the\nroof and then banged down ;\nor one night we would wake and\nhear a sound as if a lamp was being smashed to bits close by, or\nelse one heard doors opening and shutting.\nIn the night-nursery the nurse heard frequent rappings, bangs\non the iron-work at the head of her bed, chests of drawers being\nforced over and violent blows struck on various pieces of furniture.\nIn the night-nursery our children used to hear some one rushing\nup and down the piece of landing leading to it soon after they\nwere in bed, at 6.30 p.m., and our little girl used to ask us very\nnervously what it was. At the time we thought she had imagined\nit, but years after we found how true it was.\nAnother night when she was in bed she was frightened by hear-\ning constant groaning coming from just below the open window. I\nwent up to her and told her that her father and I were down-\nstairs and that we should hear if\nanything was wrong. When I went\ndown and told my husband he said that he had heard some curious\ngroaning noises, but had said nothing. We went up to the little\n\f1914. The Haunting of House. 279\ngirl again, and suddenly there came a most terrible groan as from\na man in deadly agony, just below the window. My husband\nlooked out, fully expecting to see some one terribly hurt lying out-\nside, but could see nothing, though it was a beautiful summer\nnight; the need to look to the nervous and crying child, whom we\ntook into our room for the night, prevented him from carrying\nout his intention of going out into the garden to see what was\nwrong. We never knew of any reason for the groans.\n1\nSome days we had the feeling of the most terrible depression,\nwe all had it. About 1909, when my husband was ill in bed with\ninfluenza, I was sitting with him about 6 p.m. one summer's day\nand I kept hearing the most strange and uncanny noise as of some\nunknown animal underneath my wardrobe. It went on at intervals\nfor about a quarter of an hour, and at last I spoke about it, and\nmy husband said he wondered how long it would be before I said\nanything, as he too had heard it. I got up and looked under the\nwardrobe but could find nothing, and as I was going towards the\ndoor the noise seemed to follow me, and whatever it was gave a\nfinal shriek and it was all over. It was most uncanny.\nAnother night when my husband and I were reading by the\ndrawing-room fire, sitting on either side of the hearth, we heard an\nold man's asthmatic cough close to us on the hearth, apparently\nproceeding from the centre of the fire which was alight. One\nSunday night every one had gone to church except my husband\nand my little boy, who was in bed upstairs; the latter thought he\nheard some one on the landing and very pluckily went out to see who\nwas there. He was walking towards the nursery when he heard\ncreaking footsteps following him, and he screamed so, that my\nhusband rushed up and found him terrified.\nWhen our younger girl was six or seven, she had not long gone\nto bed in the night-nursery one Sunday evening when she saw\nsomething black standing at the side of her bed. For a minute\nshe thought it must be the governess, when suddenly she saw her\nlittle brother jump on the bed in his pyjamas. She said, \"He had\nnot any feet and he seemed to go away all grey, and I screamed\nand screamed 'cause I knew that he was at school, and I shall\nwrite and tell him he's very naughty aud he's never to do that\nagain.\"\n1\nThis occurred before Mr. Long at any rate had any thoughts of the super-\nnatural. He went to the window, not doubting in the least that there was\na person outside in fearful pain. F. J. M. S.\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT. -Nov.\nThe boy had gone back to school on the East Coast a few\ndays before a week late, having been ill. Our little girl talked\nof it for weeks after. She was, of course, much frightened at the\ntime, and gave me the account I have just given directly I came\nfrom church. The governess was fortunately in the next room and\nhad gone to her at once.\nAs time went on we had so little peace that (about two years\nago) we decided to ask the advice of a well-known priest who\nhad had much experience in these matters. He came over and\nread certain prayers in each room in the house and sprinkled holy\nwater into every corner. On returning that same night there was a\nmost wonderful feeling in the house as of intense rarity of atmos-\nphere, all ghostly feeling had gone out of the house and for nearly\na year we had absolute peace, and then the occurrences began again.\nOn one occasion I had a friend (a sister-in-law) staying in the\nhouse our little boy had also a school friend staying there and I\nhad gone by train leaving her at home ;\nI must mention that we were\nhaving a children's party two days later. I got back that day\nabout four o'clock, but it was not till the evening that my friend\nsuddenly said,\n\" What a charming maid you have got in to help at\nthe party.\" I stared at her, and she looked rather puzzled and\nsaid,\n\" I have never seen a more delightful face.\" I then told her\nthat I had not got in any one extra, and she told me that she was\ncoming downstairs at twelve o'clock that morning and this girl\nwas doing something at one of the stairs that she was in a deep\npink zephyr dress and pretty apron with no cap on, and her hair\non the top of her head, and that she had the most happy and\nbeautiful face. My friend said,\n\" I should know her anywhere.\" She\nthen owned that the figure did not move nor look at her as she\npassed, and, as my friend naturally thought she was just an extra\nmaid, she did not speak to her, but walked on downstairs and went\ninto the drawing-room. The little boy staying with us said he saw\nher too, but no one else in the house saw her. We have since\nalways spoken of her as \"the Pink Maid.\" It. was a strange\ncoincidence that only the night before my friend had said to my\nhusband and myself that if she could only see something she should\nbelieve in ghosts, but that she herself had never had an experi-\nence. Many uncanny noises were heard that night.\n1\nx\nln reply to a request for a confirmatory account this lady writes to Mrs.\nLong [in a letter received July 11, 1913], \"I thought of writing out the\nghost experiences yesterday, but last night I was surrounded by fears and\n\f19U.

Strangely it dated specially from the time we had\nan old pump in the scullery taken up, and we began to wonder if\nthe strange happenings in the house had anything to do with the\nwell. We had four servants in the house, all with excellent refer-\nences, and they will each vouch for the truth of the following\nincidents. Two of them were very sceptical of the ghosts, having\nnever had an experience themselves, though the other two were\nsuffering badly.\n(2) THE LAST Six MoNTirs. 1\nJuly, 1913.\n. . . After this the parlour-maid, who had had no experiences\nduring the four months she had been with us, slept in the same\nroom [as the sewing-maid],\n-\nand they both woke, and both heard\na mad rushing or dancing up and down the landing and in the\ncoat-hall underneath, and also heard notes of music. I happened\nto be awake very late and my door open, and the landing seemed\nto me full of distant sounds, and I heard notes of music, and the\njangling together of stirrups, as it were.\nOne Saturday afternoon my husband and little girl and I had\nbeen motoring, and had just had tea. A maid was coming through\nthe hall as it was beginning to get dusk, and she saw some one in\ngrey going upstairs round the bend of the stairs. She thought\nnothing of it, as she thought it was my husband in his usual dark\ngrey suit, and was much surprised when she went on into the\ndrawing-room to fetch the tea things to find us all three there.\nThe parlour-maid was out, and this girl was an unimaginative\nunder-servant aged 17. ...\nAt supper one night the old cook, who prided herself on not\ndiscomforts, so resolved to have nothing to do with any research or to think\nabout spirits. I acknowledge their presence, of course, but I will do nothing\nto arouse them. I don't think it leads to any good, and I wish you would\nnot do it either.

It leaned over her, and with a very long hand clawed her\nbackwards and forwards across her chest over the bed-clothes then\nwaited a few seconds, and did it again, and she screamed. Then it\nseemed to lie on her, and hold her down.\nTwo nights after, her wrist, which was under the clothes, was\nseized, and held so tightly she could hardly move her arm for a\nday or two. We then took her out of that room for three weeks,\nwhen she felt brave enough to go back, but she never laughed at\nthem again. . . .\nOn March 25th and 26th the house seemed to be alive all day\nand night. In the nursery in the morning, the wardrobe was hit\nwith a great bang, and the sewing machine box was hit as if with\na whip. Close to where the sewing-maid sat she heard, as it were,\na dog getting up with floppy ears and shaking himself. The girl\nwent down into the kitchen feeling nervous, and when there all\nfour servants heard some one walk through the nursery over-\nhead, and stamp on the landing. At night there were sounds as\nif two people were fighting on the landing, and they heard the\nsound of the blows. Loud bangs were also heard all night long.\nThe next day when we were out, as the maid was cleaning the\ndining-room window, there were constant loud hits on the oak-table\nas if some one kept hitting it, and nearly all day long some\none walked up and down the landing when there was no one\nupstairs.\nOn March 27th, 1913, at 10 a.m., when the maid was doing my\nroom, there were constant raps at my door, as if some one were\nrapping with a flat hand, and she felt that some one was by her\nside all the time she was sweeping. . . .\nOne evening about 7 p.m., I was sitting in the nursery, and\nthere was a sound as of a stick snapped in two just in front of my\nnose. All who were in the room heard it, and wondered what I\nhad done, and I looked to see what they had done. They said that\nthere had been a shadow on the ceiling just over where I was\nsitting just before, but they had not told me.\nThat night the sewing and parlour-maid slept in the same room,\nin the night nursery, and all night long great chattering was going\non underneath in the coat-hall, and they heard loud trumpet blasts\n\f1914. The Haunting of House. 283\nnearly all night long, then something very heavy seemed to fall, and\nall was quiet.\nLoud bangs were of frequent occurrence. One afternoon my\nlittle girl of ten was in the day nursery with the sewing-maid,\nand some one whistled in the room. My little girl of course said\n\"Whatever's that?\" and soon after she said, \"Well, if I believed\nin ghosts, I should say it was a ghost.\" (She knew nothing\nabout it.) ...\nOne night when all the servants had gone to bed, my husband\nand I were in the drawing-room about 11.20 p.m., when I heard\nmy little girl of ten call \"Mother,\" and yet not very loudly. I\nwent upstairs at once, and she said,\n\"\nI only called you, mother,\nbecause I heard you come upstairs, and go past the door; but\nwasn't it you, mother? Because I couldn't understand it when you\ncalled 'Yes' from downstairs.\" No one had been upstairs, as we\nhad had the drawing-room door open, and could see the stairs ;\nthis often happened.\nDuring the last few weeks beautiful singing was heard by the\nservants very often on their landing on one occasion three of\nthem were together. They said it was like many voices singing\nsome most beautiful tune which they did not know, and the\nevening they heard it they kept seeing\n\" shadows as of people\n\"\nmoving about. . . .\nOne morning in June, when the parlour-maid was doing my\nroom, my voice said to her quite distinctly from by the chest of\ndrawers, \"P ,\" but I was in Birmingham, and later on that\nmorning they heard some one come upstairs and go into my room\nand the bathroom, and thought I had come in, but I had not.\nThey went to see immediately if any one ivas there, as we always\ndid. My voice is very often heard calling some one when I have\nnever called, and in all parts of the house, where you could not\nhear if I did call. One morning I went upstairs, and, thinking\nthe maid was in my room, I said, as I turned in, \"Edith,\" and\nher voice said quite distinctly, \"Yes, madam,\" but she was not\nthere, so I went into the next room, feeling sure she was there, and\nsaid,\n\"\nOh, will you . .\n.,\" but there was no one there. A few\nminutes later she came up the back stairs, nowhere near where I\nwas, as she had been fetching some coal, and of course had no idea\nI wanted her.\nOne night in May I woke for no reason, and at once wondered\nwhat woke me, and then heard a voice close to me say,\n\"\nWhat\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT-NOV.\nwould you say if he did?\" Another night, when all the servants\nwere at supper, they heard loud and terrible screams from the old\npump in the scullery, and beating against the boards, and at last\nrushed terrified to us in the dining-room, and we went immediately,\nbut always directly you begin to listen the noises stop. . . .\nI have omitted to say that during the last ten days before we\nleft my husband and I were both writing in the dining-room one\nnight. The hall lamp had been lighted since 8 p.m., and had been\na nice, bright light all night. Also, if a lamp is going to flare\nup, it does it soon after it is lighted, or if some one has turned\nit up too high, or if there is a draught. At 10.15 I happened to\ngo through the hall, and specially noticed what a nice, clear light\nthe lamp was giving. At 10.30 we heard a smash, rushed out, and\nthe lamp was flaring up, and the chimney broken. We felt it\nmost strange, and after putting it out, we went on with our\nwriting. We had two large Beige lamps on the table. One\ngradually kept going lower, in spite of our turning it up, and\ngradually went out altogether. I, of course, tried to think it had\nnot been filled, though I practically knew it had been. Presently\nthe other one did the same thing, so we went to bed. The next\nmorning the lamps, which had both been filled the morning before,\nhad plenty of oil in, and the wicks were all right. A few nights\nafter, my husband, who always puts the lamp on the landing out\nhimself, last thing, says that that special night he even thought\nabout it specially as he put it out, as we were rather uncertain\nabout things, wondering if the spirits were going to set us on\nfire.\nNext morning the parlour-maid came out of the night nursery\nsoon after 6 a.m. (she slept there, as the sewing-maid was so\nnervous), and saw the landing lamp flaring up, and moved right to\nthe very edge of the chest, where it is never put, so that in\nanother minute it must have fallen on to the carpet just outside\nour bedroom door. She quickly put it out, and could not make it\nout, as my husband never forgets that lamp.\nFor weeks past the nursery lamp would be left an ordinary\nmedium light, whilst the servants were at supper, and when some one\nnext went up it had been turned nearly out, and yet the same\nlamp would burn all night long in the night nursery. They all\nslept with a light the last few mouths.\nThere is no question, \"the spirits\" very often tampered with the\nlamps.\n\f1914. The Haunting of\n- House. 285\nThe sewing-maid told me that before shy knew about the house\nshe hail written to her friends, and said she could not understand\nwhy the servants at our house stayed up so late that she often\nheard them walking about in the coat-hall underneath her room\nbetween 1 and 2 a.m. Later on one of these friends came to us as\nparlour-maid, and heard \"the walking\" herself, and had various\nother experiences.\nWe have heard nothing of any occurrences since we left so far,\nand the caretaker, who is already appointed, is to live in the man's\ncottage, so no one will be living in the house itself any more. No\nvillagers know about it.\n[Signed] M. LONG.\nThe following is Mr. Long's account :\nAugust 21, 1913.\nDuring the twelve years we lived at [\n-\nHouse] I had very\nmany peculiar experiences, which could not, I think, be accounted\nfor by natural causes. I am naturally sceptical, and for a long\ntime refused to believe that any experiences encountered by others\nof my household could not be explained by ordinary causes. I\nfrankly admit that my opinion in this respect would have remained\nunshaken but for my own personal experiences, and I was ulti-\nmately forced to the conclusion that they could have no other than\na supernatural origin.\nIt is impossible for me now to give in writing more than a few\nof my own experiences.\nIn November, 1908, I was staying with my wife and children\nwith some friends near Wrexham. I returned home by myself,\nleaving them there. On reaching home I found a good many\nbusiness papers and letters awaiting me. I had dinner and went\nto bed, probably about 11 o'clock, taking my correspondence with\nme. I got into bed, lit\nmy pipe, and was soon absorbed in my\ncorrespondence. In about probably half an hour I distinctly heard\nsome one walk down the passage and into the bathroom, adjoin-\ning my room. The walk seemed to be that of a woman. There\nare two doors into the bathroom, one from the landing, and\none from my bedroom. I at once jumped out of bed, and\nunlocked and opened the door leading from my room to the\nbathroom, taking with me a lighted candle. No one was there,\nand I quickly passed through the bathroom to the landing and\nthe passage, but clearly no one was there. I said,\n\" Who's\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT. -Nov.\nthere\n1\n?\" but got no reply. I got back to bed and was soon at my\nreading again. I had read for probably another half-hour when\nI heard voices at my window. They appeared to be men's voices^\nand they sounded as if they were just outside my window. I\nremember thinking that any way this was real enough, as the\nvoices were quite distinct, and I wondered if my Works were\non fire and a messenger had been sent over in the night from\nB to fetch me. I once more got out of bed and opened the\nwindow, only to find it\nraining and blowing hard, and I at once\nrecognised that the sound of even loud talking in the garden below\ncould not possibly reach me in my room, above the noise of wind\nand rain. I got back into bed wondering what it could all mean,\nwhen I heard a woman's shrill, uncanny laugh from the garden\nbelow. At the risk of provoking ridicule, I must describe that\nlaugh as devilish and unearthly, and for the rest of the night I\nkept my light burning.\nOn another night I sat up fairly late reading, my wife having\ngone to bed. Probably about 12.30 or 1 o'clock a.m. I put out\nthe light, locked the dining-room door, and was about to cross the\nhall with the object of putting out the hall lamp, when I heard\na voice proceeding from the hall ceiling. It was a woman's voice,\nvery sweet and appealing, and I tried hard to hear what it said,\nbut could not catch any of the words. It was not unlike my wife's\nvoice. I put out the light and went upstairs. My wife was\nawake, and I casually asked her if she had called to me, but it\nwas evident she had done nothing of the kind.\nAnother night at about the same spot in the hall, I felt an icy\ncold wind pass over my face. This was not any ordinary draught\nor anything like it. Of this I am convinced. No doors or windows\nwere open.\nOn another occasion I slept in a room called the spare-room.\nI awoke suddenly, and after about a minute I heard a distinct\nknock on the door. I got up and opened the door, but no one\nwas there. The next night I awoke again, and directly afterwards\nI heard a noise like a motor-horn under the bed. I lit a candle\nand looked everywhere, but could discover no explanation. Shortly\nafterwards I heard a loud crash, as if a heavy stone had been\nthrown at the looking-glass. I looked round the room again, but\nnothing had fallen, nor could I find anything that could possibly\nafford any explanation of the noise.\nOn another occasion I woke very early, about 5 o'clock. It was-\n\f1914. The Haunting of\n- - House.\nquite light, and I was surprised to hear the sound of children's voices\nproceeding apparently from the garden below. From the sound\nthere might have been twenty or thirty children, all talking\ntogether. I looked out of the window, but, of course, there was\nno one there, nor was it likely there would be, as it was far too\nearly.\n[Signed] J. LONG.\nAt my interview with Mr. and Mrs. Long, the former\nconfirmed the stories in his wife's account in which he also\nwas concerned, and added several others which he had not\nhad time to write out in his own account. These are given\nbelow :\nOne night, after noises had been heard in the garden, and\nas there was some reason to believe that burglars were\nworking in the neighbourhood, Mr. Long, the local policeman,\nand the gardener were sitting in the dining-room discussing\nwhat was the best line to take in the matter. There was\nno light in the room, so that the alarm should not be given\nto any possible marauders, and there was no question of the\nsupernatural in Mr. Long's mind at that time. While they\nwere talking there sounded on a wine cooler which stood\nas a coal-hod on the opposite side of the fireplace to\nthe gardener and policeman a most tremendous smash as\nthough it had been struck violently with a very heavy stick.\nThe gardener and policeman walked across to it and examined\nit, but there was no sign of any dent or mark on it.\nAnother night something appears to have badly frightened\nthe horse in its locked-up stable. For the following morning\nMr. Long was called up early by the groom to look at the\nhorse. It had broken its headstall in the night, cut itself\nbadly about the head, knees and sides, and bumped its eyes\ntill they were swollen badly. The horse was really a wreck\nand had to be sold. The veterinary surgeon who was called\nin said that\n\"\nthe animal must have been thoroughly\nfrightened.\" The same night was a disturbed one for Mr.\nand Mrs. Long ;\nand also the groom in his cottage a hundred\nyards away from the stable heard a noise as though a\nheavy lamp had been thrown to the ground and smashed.\nIn reference to the question of the possibility of the horse\nbeing disturbed in the same way as the occupants of the\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT. -Nov.\nhouse, it may be mentioned that the house dog showed\nsigns of disturbance only through markedly avoiding certain\nrooms.\nAnother curious experience of Mr. Long's was the follow-\ning : One Wednesday evening he came home from business\nand went upstairs for a wash and to see the children. From\nthe end of the passage leading to the night-nursery he saw\nthe cat on the table in the day-nursery helping itself to the\nchildren's supper. He went in and drove the cat away,\ncalling out,\n\"\nI say, the cat's on the table again.\"\n\"\nYes,\"\ncame the answer in the voice of Miss H., the governess.\nMiss H. was in church at the time, and there was no one\nin the room.\nOther experiences of Mr. Long include the rattling of the\nfront-door chain one night, and a curious rattling against\nthe wall of a picture on the staircase one very still day when\nMr. Long was just going upstairs. Once when standing\ncarving he seemed to catch sight through the open door\nof a dark bat-like creature flying out of the hall into the\ndrive. Mrs. Long had a somewhat similar experience once\nlater when waking after lying down for a rest upstairs. It\nwas only after hearing of her experience that Mr. Long\nrepeated his. On one occasion when Mr. Long was in the\nbathroom adjoining his bedroom, with the door between the\ntwo rooms closed, he heard a loud bang on the door. Mrs.\nLong, who was in the bedroom, noticed nothing. On another\noccasion, just as Mr. Long was going off to business, he\ncalled out to his wife, and she appeared to answer \"\nYes.\"\nBut he could not find her for some time, as she was out of\nearshot at the far end of the house, shut up in the larder\nand talking to the cook.\nThe sewing-maid's account (abridged) is as follows:\n[Received in August, 1913.]\nMy first experience (but I did not know I was in a haunted\nhouse) was that I was awakened by something which was pressing\nme down into the bed. The feeling was most deathly. After\nthat I often heard people talking downstairs, and bolting and chain-\ning the front door, after every one had gone to bed. . . . Sometimes\na woman walked the landing, swished her skirts as she passed my\ndoor, sometimes gave the door a gentle tap, another time it would\n\f1914. The Haunting of\n-\nbe a loud knock. There were often sounds of a woman crying,\nsometimes laughing. One morning I was awakened and I saw a\nwoman's face looking at me. . . . Another morning ... I saw a face\nagain. . . .\nAgain another morning, when I woke, there was a tall\nwoman stood by my bedside. She was dressed in grey, some-\nthing thin, which seemed to cover her right over from her head. . . .\nMostly every night my bed was shaken, the furniture all seemed\nalive . . . even the china on the washstand would all crash to-\ngether. . . . Once in the night\n\" it\n\"\nspoke to me. I had been\nmaking up my mind to go to a certain place. I was lying in bed\nthinking about it, when a voice very clearly called me by name,\nand said,\n\" Don't go, whatever you do, don't go.\" . . . Another time\nI heard a bird whistling, also a cock crowing. ... I have also heard\nsinging and music being played, but when you stopped to listen it\nalways seemed to get higher and higher and drift away. . . .\n[This account is unsigned, but the maid's name and address\nhi'cc been given to us. ED.]\nMiss S., the housekeeper, who lived at --- House for\nfive years, reports that once, when she and a friend were in\nthe nursery about midnight, they heard \"\na dreadful noise\non the landing outside, like the flapping of the wings of a\nhuge bird.\" They went out on to the landing, but could see\nnothing. On another occasion, when she was sleeping with\nMrs. Long's little boy, she was awakened by hearing\n\"\na\ndreadful noise, like something very heavy falling. She got\nup expecting to see that the boy had fallen out of bed, but\nhe was fast asleep.\n\"\nThe room was filled with a sort of\nblue smoke and smelt strongly of sulphur.

She \"\ndistinctly\nfelt the fingers pressed round [her] throat.\" The feeling lasted\nabout half a second.\nThe following account was given by a nurse, who attended\non Mrs. Long :\n[Received in August, 1913.]\nOn Nov. 10, 1908, I went to House in the capacity of nurse\nto Mrs. Long, who was in bed with a form of heart trouble all\nthe four months I spent there.\nMy patient's room and the nursery were at opposite ends of a\ncorridor, and my bedroom was between the two. Mrs. Long's\nj^oungest child was always put to bed in the nursery, and late at\nnight (generally between 10.30 and 11) Mr. Long used to carry\nher into his wife's room after my duties were ended and I had gone\nto bed.\nI had been in the house some weeks when one night I was\nawakened by footsteps going along the corrider, and the distinct\ncreak of a board as the foot pressed it just opposite my door. A\nfew seconds later a clock struck twelve. In the morning I\nremarked, \"Mr. Long was very late fetching Hope last night.\"\nMrs. Long asked: \"What makes you think so\n1\n?\" I said, \"The\nclock struck twelve just as I heard him.\" She returned some\nevasive reply.\nShortly after that a distinct tap on my door in the night roused\nme. I called out, \"Yes, Mr. Long.\" On the few occasions\nwhen my patient required my help after I had gone to bed, Mr.\nLong was in the habit of tapping and immediately saying that\nMrs. Long would like me to come to her. Instead of the usual\nreply the tap was repeated. I at once rose and went to the door.\nNo one was there. Feeling quite sure that the tapping was a real\ncall, I went quickly to Mrs. Long's door and listened for some\ntime. There was no sound, and I retired much puzzled. I spoke\nof this to Mrs. Long, but she again returned an evasive reply.\nVery soon after this I once more heard footsteps in the night and\n\f1914. The Haunting of\n- - House. 291\nthe creak of the board outside my door, and this time it happened\nas the clock struck two. I was concerned, thinking the late hour\nvery unsuitable for Mrs. Long, and I spoke about it in the\nmorning. Mrs. Long then asked me if I ever heard the board\ncreak during the day. I said \"No,\" although I walked over it\npractically every hour. I went then and there, tried all the board*\nseveral times, and could not make a sound with any of them. I\nam not quite sure whether Mrs. Long told me then that\nmysterious sounds had been heard in the house, but it would be\nabout this time that I began to think there was some supernatural\nagency at work.\nOne day I was sitting at work in the nursery, when I heard\nMrs. Long's voice call \"Nurse, nurse,\" most distinctly. I ran\nalong the passage and went quickly into the room to my patient's\nsurprise. I felt it almost impossible to believe she had not called.\nThe house was absolutely quiet, and I think this puzzled me more\nthan anything which had happened. A few days later, finding the\nhousekeeper was not at liberty to attend to Mrs. Long's bell\nduring my walk, I asked the housemaid (a new-comer who had only\narrived a few days previously from Essex) to go up if she were\nwanted. I returned to find the girl greatly disturbed. \" I've done\nalmost no work, nurse. Mrs. Long has been calling to me. I've\nbeen up at her door a good bit of the time, I got so nervous.\"\n\"Do you mean ringing her bell\n1\n?\" I enquired. \"No; calling my\nname.\"\nIt would have been an absolute impossibility for any one in the\nservants' offices to hear a call from Mrs. Long's bedroom. I did\nnot want to arouse any suspicion in the maid's mind, and I told her\nshe probably would not be asked to do this again, and not to feel\nworried.\nThe creak of the board, the footsteps in the corridor, and the\ntapping on my door were fairly frequent occurrences. I thought a\ngood deal about these things, but never had any sensation of fear.\nI had never been to [the village] before, knew no one there, and no\none had told me a word about any unusual happenings in that\nhouse until I had had the distinct experiences of my own.\nI should add that during the last month of my stay there the\nyoungest child slept in my room, and the two others returned from\nschool for the holidays. To the best of my belief I heard no noises\nwhich could not be reasonably accounted for during that time.\n[Signed] M. E. I.\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT. -Nov.\nA visitor staying in the house, Mr. W., had the following\nexperience :\nJuly 20, 1913.\nThe following is an account of an experience when sleeping at\nHouse some time ago, the exact date I cannot remember.\nI am not in the 'habit of seeing or experiencing such things,\nand, at the time, was not thinking of anything of the kind.\nI am a very sound sleeper, and, unless ill, invariably sleep\nsoundly all night, and am not easily wakened.\nI went to bed about 11.30 p.m., or midnight, and fell asleep at\nonce. At 2.30 a.m. (I looked at my watch at the time) I was\nsuddenly woken up, and sat up in bed, At the same instant I\nheard my bedroom door open, and \"\nsomething\n\"\ncame into the\nroom. I neither saw nor heard it, but could \"\nfeel\n\"\nit, and could\ntell its exact position in the room. It moved round the wall of the\nroom and round my bed, round the other wall and out of the door,\nwhich I heard close again. I could feel its presence in the same way\nthat a person with their eyes shut would feel a hot or cold object\napproaching or receding. I called out \"Who is that?\" but without\nreply. I got out of bed and struck a light, but could see nothing\nunusual. I tried the door, and found it latched. I looked out, but\ncould see nothing.\nThe room I was in was the spare room, which I have slept in\nseveral times, but have never experienced anything unusual except\nat this time.\n[Signed] V. \\V.\nAnother visitor, the wife of the local doctor, writes as\nfollows :\nJuly 12, 1913.\nOn an occasion recently when I had tea with Mrs. Long in the\ndrawing-room at [B House] I certainly had some unusual\nexperiences, which I will do my best to describe.\nWhile we were talking I distinctly heard a quiet moan from the\ncorner of the room where the piano was placed. A few minutes\nlater, while we were conversing, I was looking, without any inten-\ntion, at the wall just above the piano when I saw what appeared\nto me to be a ball of vapour, about the size of a golf ball, float\nslowly across the wall just above the piano and then disappear.\n\f1914. The Haunting of\n- House. 293\nI must confess to some very creepy feelings after that. I felt com-\npelled to turn round when I was standing near the door, as it\nthere was some one behind me.\nThis was only my second visit to the house. I have never had\nany such experiences before.\n[Signed] M. T. 1\nOne other experience remains to be told. It was the only\none in which any members of the village were concerned, and\nexcept for the two boys themselves, no one else appears to\nhave been excited by it. One night the newspaper boys wha\ncame round regularly with the evening paper saw an old man\nin a top-hat sitting on the rockery in the drive. Something\nabout him frightened the boys, and they fled back to the road,\nwhen he suddenly appeared to them in the shrubbery on the\nother side of the rockery. They ran away, and would never\nagain come up the drive with the paper. Instead they used\nto go a long way round and come across a field-path to the\nback of the house.\nIn response to further queries raised by the Secretary of\nthe S.P.E., Mrs. Long gave the following additional informa-\ntion :\nMarch 2, 1914.\nWithin the last few weeks my husband heard from the nephews\nof the people who sold the house to us that they believed that their\nrelatives knew it was haunted that they were always having the\ndoors rapped and no one there, and they believed the ornaments\nwalked from one shelf to another ! But they were not clear what\ndid happen. As we asked at the time and were told by the\npeople who sold it us that they had never heard anything, I am\nafraid they will not own up now.

Questions put to Mr. and Mrs. Long\nelicited the following facts, some of which may have a\nbearing on the question.\nNo one, so far as they know, could have had any motive\nfor wishing to drive them away from the house, and certainly\nthe question of the house being converted into a village club\nwas only mooted in the last few months. The manservant\nseveral times went on to the roof in fact all over it and on\nto a lower part between the rafters, and there was no trace\nof rats nor of anything else. In fact, no rats were ever seen\nin the house. Windows, doors, door handles were all\nexamined in turn, and many experiments were made in\nlooking for loose boards, etc., in the landing. The house is\nabout 45 yards from a main road, and about 600 yards from\nthe railway.\nThe pump was taken up and put outside simply because\nthe wood looked old. That was only done in March, 1913.\nThe well was thoroughly examined, and a small drag was put\ndown, but nothing was found, though\n\"\nat times it seemed as\nthough some one was beating against the boards which were\nlaid across it, and at other times shrieks seemed to come from\nit.\"\n1\nThe drains were tested in 1906 when the boy was\ndown with diphtheria of which there were several cases\nabout in the village and near his school. But they were in\nperfect order. However, to be on the safe side after the boy\nwas well, the drains were all cased in cement under expert\nadvice. It does not seem, likely that any theory based upon\nthe effect of poisonous gases in producing hallucinations can\napply.\nIt does not seem possible to trace the phenomena to the\npresence of any one person. Mrs. Long has her first experi-\nences before her husband comes back. He has his most\nstriking ones when she is away from home. Many servants\nleft at short notice, and most of those who stayed seemed to\nhave in some way a very unpleasant time. Three trained\nsick-nurses and several visitors had uncanny experiences.\nThe account of one sick nurse has already been given. A\nsecond nurse, when asked by Mrs. Long in July, 1913, to\n1\nLetter from Mrs. Long.\n\f1914. The Haunting of\n- - House. 295\nwrite her account, replied as follows in a letter dated July 13,\n1913:\n\"You have asked me to do a very difficult thing for me just\nnow. I will try and do it unless you would do it for me, aii<l I\nwill sign my name to it or copy it out. (Here follows a passage\nexplaining how busy the nurse was.) So would you write it out\nfor me and I will copy it ? You can do it so much better than I\ncould. If I were not so dreadfully pushed I would not ask you,\nbut make a try. I will put in any little thing you have left out,\nif you will.\"\nThe account was not written out for her. When at the\nsuggestion of the Secretary of the S.P.R. the nurse was appealed\nto again in March, 1914, she replied as follows:\n\"I am awfully sorry to say that I really cannot do what you\nask me. To be honest with you, I have had so much to occupy\nmy thoughts since I left you that I have forgotten really about\nthe ghost.\"\nThe third nurse was only at the house for a few days\nand has been lost sight of.\nSeveral earlier experiences of Mrs. Long's must be mentioned,\nwhich may be important. The earliest thing she remembers\nat all resembling the events at House was a sudden\nawakening one night, the feeling as of a hot breath and the\n-hearing of three knocks on a round Chippendale table in the\nbedroom. This was long previous to her living at House.\nAt the previous house she lived in she once on three consecu-\ntive nights shared in some curious happenings.\n1. One morning early, when lying awake talking quietly\nto her husband, she heard her elder daughter come running\ninto the room from the night-nursery.\n\"\nYes, mother,\" said\nthe little girl. \"I didn't call you,\" said Mrs. Long. \"Yes,\nyou did, mother ;\nI heard you several times.\" And the nurse\nconfirmed this. The child's name one of four syllables was\nunlikely to be confused with any other sound which might\nhave reached the nursery, and it was heard several times by\nboth child and nurse.\n2. The next night Mrs. Long went into the bedroom and\nfound a horrible, unearthly smell. She called some one else\nin to smell it, and it had gone.\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT.-NOV.\n3. On the morning following the next night Mrs. Long had\nnews of the serious illness of a friend. She was going upstairs\nfrom the dining-room to tell her husband when she heard\nthe dining-room bell ringing. As she knew that she had just\nleft the room empty, she turned back to see the meaning of\nthe bell ringing, and found the maid coming in with the\nplates the natural result of the bell. The room was\nempty !\nThe following night Mrs. Long herself was taken seriously\nill.\nThe only experience at all akin to those at House\never experienced by Mr. Long was at quite another time,,\nonce when he heard a decided rap on his door, a rap that\nwas never explained.\nMrs. Long has heard two unexplained noises since leaving\nthe house last June. One was at Harrogate, and was a\nrapping high up on the wall of her bedroom, and the other\nwas at Eedcar. In this latter case she and her little daughter\nand maid were alone on the top floor of a lodging-house, when\nshe heard a huge bang and kick at the door of her bedroom.\nShe rapped on the wall to the maid's room the maid was a.\nnew one engaged just for the stay at the seaside and had never\nbeen at House and the maid came through, but the noise\nwas unexplained. As, however, Mrs. Long had possibly told\nthe maid about her experiences at House, it is not im-\npossible that this noise was a foolish trick on the maid's part.\nIn any case, later phenomena are of less value than earlier\nones in deciding .whether in any way Mrs. Long can be regarded\nas the catalytic agent who started the phenomena at\nHouse.\nAn alternative theory is one which found favour for a time\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Long. While in New Zealand, at the time\nwhen Mrs. Long entered into - -\nHouse, Mr. Long took from\na Maori temple or\n\"\nwarri,\" which was \"\nunder Tapu\n\"\n(or given\nover to evil spirits), a sort of hideous idol. He brought it-\nhome and kept it in the hall, and Mr. and Mrs. Long often\nwondered if it could have anything to do with the noises. A\nfew weeks before they left they took it down and burned it,\non the advice of a missionary, and Mrs. Long added that the\nexperiences with the lamps followed this ! The late Andrew\n\finn. 7V\" \/\/<\"\/\/;,\/ of\n- II-, we. 297\nLang should have found in this suggestion a fit subject for a\ndelightful paper.\nFor my own part, I am free to confess that I have no\ntheory as to the nature or the cause of the phenomena described\nabove. In the first accounts I heard the phenomena were\nnearly all of one class, auditory, and I was inclined to think\nof some gaseous exhalation in the house, which induced auditory\nhallucinations. The pump and the diphtheria fitted in with\nthis view. The careful attention to drains was against it, as\nalso the widening of the range of hallucinations. Then I\nthought of the phenomena being traced to some one person,\nand I found that view untenable. The Maori spirits could\nhardly be expected to begin performing in Mrs. Long's home\nin an English village long before the figure had been taken\nback to England and to the house. The hypothesis of\n\"\nnerves\n\"\ndoes not help me, as I still seek for a reason why a large\nnumber of different people should have had such attacks of\n\"\nnerves\n\"\nat this one house during the past twelve years. Xo\nexplanation suggested so far seems to meet the case, which\nmust for the present rest as one more piece of evidence await-\ning explanation, and waiting also to take its share in the\nbuilding up of a general theory of haunting.\nCASES.\nP. 288. Dream.\nTHE following case of a premonitory dream was sent to us by the\npercipient, Mrs. Jenkyns, who, in enclosing her account, writes :\n99 LEXHAM GARDENS,\nKENSINGTON, W., July 12, 1914.\nI am sending you a very curious experience that befell me two\nyears ago [when we were living at St. Leonards-on-Sea]. If I had\nnot told my dream to five people before it was fulfilled, I should\nhave imagined I might have been mistaken, but any one of those\npeople, with the exception of my husband, who died shortly after,\nwould testify to the truth of my statement.\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT. -Nov.\nThe account is as follows :\nJuly 12, 1914.\nOn the 6th of June, 1912, I dreamed my husband and I were\nstaying at an old-fashioned hotel on the banks of the Thames, high\nup. We were dressing early in the morning, and I had just taken\nfrom the dressing table the jewellery I had worn the previous\nevening, an opal locket and two or three other little ornaments, when\na knock at the door heralded the arrival of a chambermaid, who said\na friend of mine, Mrs. R., was waiting in a bedroom near, No. 40,\nand would like to see me. Just as I was, with the jewellery still\nin my hand, I rushed to No. 40, anxious to learn the reason for so\nvery early a visit, and as I entered the room, the open sleeve of\nmy dressing-gown caught on the handle of the door and jerked the\nthings I was carrying out of my hand on to the floor. Not waiting\nto pick them up, I went straight to Mrs. R,., who was standing in\nthe deep square bay of the window. \"What on earth brings you\nhere at such an hour?\" I said: \"it is only just seven. Anything\ngone wrong]\"\n\"No,\" she replied, \"but I have always wanted to come down\nhere, and Mr. J. (mentioning a mutual friend) offered to motor me\ndown this morning, and suggested I might have breakfast with you.\nIt was this room I particularly wanted to see, on account of its\ncurious history.\"\nAs she spoke I glanced round, and saw a large, square, low-\nceilinged room, with paper and carpet all faded into a blur of drab,\nold-fashioned mahogany furniture, a big four-poster with twisted\ncolumns, and white dimity hangings ;\nin the bay, a large dressing-\ntable draped with the same dimity, and curtains at the windows to\nmatch.\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it looks to me like any other old room. What\nis the history 1\n\"\n\"Some time ago,\" she began, \"a young Hungarian shot himself\nhere, and since then there have been numberless fatalities two\nhave occurred quite recently. A maid cleaning the room picked up\na button. On it was the likeness of a very handsome dark young\nman. That very day she was knocked down and fatally injured by\na motor car in front of the hotel. Soon afterwards a visitor who\nwas put into this room was dressing, and picking up a fallen stud\nsaw the same face pictured on it. He was killed by his own car\nthat afternoon.\"\n\fmil. Cu\n\"How gruesome!\" I exclaimed. \"I had better not leave my\nthings on the floor any longer, but save them while they are all\nright.\" I stooped and picked up my locket, and to my horror as\nI looked at it the opal cleared like cigar smoke dissipating, until\nfrom a brilliant crystal there looked out at me the face of a young,\ndark, good-looking man.\n\"I have seen it! I have seen it! I shall be the next,\" I\nscreamed, and woke shaking with excitement. The dream was so-\nvivid that I could not shake off the impression, and I told my\nsisters-in-law at breakfast all about it. Afterwards I described it to\nmy husband, who was an invalid, and his attendant male nurse, as\nwe sat on the esplanade during the morning, and then it passed\nfrom my mind.\nThat afternoon the attendant had as usual gone to his home for\nan hour or two, and as my husband wished to go out, I started to\ntake him on the front. Very soon after we had left the house, and\nhad stepped from the side walk to cross the road, a van drew in\nclose to me, and a motor cyclist not seeing us, and wishing to keep\non his right side of the road, ran into my back, threw me violently\non to the top of my head, and fell on me, bicycle and all. I was\nfrightfully bruised and shaken, and my husband, who was in his\ninvalid chair, and powerless to help me, was very agitated also I\nwas laid by for a month. Strangely enough, my dream did not\noccur to me until one of my sisters-in-law reminded me of it.\nM. S. JENKYNS.\nIt will be noted that the dream, impressing Mrs. Jenkyns by\nits dramatic character only, quickly passed from her mind and\nwas not remembered until its premonitory significance was pointed\nout to her after the accident. It seems clear, therefore, that the\ndream did not help to bring about its own fulfilment.\nThe following confirmative statements are from Mrs. Jenkyns's\nsisters-in-law :\n17 REGENCY SQUARE, BRIGHTON, July 14, 1914.\nI was present at the breakfast table when my sister-in-law, Mrs.\nJenkyns, now residing at 99 Lexhani Gardens, S.W., related to us\nher curious dream about visiting at an up river hotel and a\nfriend telling her about a young man shooting himself in the room,\nmy sister-in-law was in, and that a maid had seen his face on a\nbutton and was killed by a motor car, the same face was seen on a\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT. -Nov.\nstud and the person met the same fate, and a locket my sister-in-\nlaw had, had an opal on it and that turned into a crystal with the\nsame face on it, and she screamed and called out \" I have seen\nit, so I shall be the next,\" and woke up. We all thought it so\ncurious, as she had a bad accident the following afternoon and we\nreminded her about having told us a very realistic dream that very\nmorning; the date was early in June, 1912, and I can remember\nbeing very interested at the time.\nD. M. JENKYNS.\n16 BEDFORD STREET, MARINE PARADE,\nBRIGHTON, July 14, 1914.\nI was one of the three sisters present at the breakfast table\nwhen our sister-in-law, Mrs. Jenkyns, related her strange dream. As\nyou have probably heard from her, she was knocked down by a\nmotor-bicycle the same afternoon and very much hurt. This is\nonly to vouch for the truth of her story.\nHOSE JENKYNS.\nMARGATE, July 15, 1914.\nRe my sister-in-law's dream. It was told to me in much the same\nwords [as the above accounts] at breakfast time, 9 o'clock, and at\nabout 5 o'clock the same day Mrs. Jenkyns was knocked down by\na motor-cycle.\nEDITH JENKYNS.\nMr. T. J. Lowles, the attendant, writes :\n55 CARISBROOKE ROAD,\nST. LEONARDS-ON-SEA, July 14, 1914.\nMrs. Jenkyns, of 99 Lexham Gardens, Kensington, has written\nme to the effect that she has sent to your Society an account of\nthe extraordinary [dream] she had previous to the accident to her\non the afternoon of June 6, 1912, when she was knocked down\nby a motor-bicycle, and that you wish it to be corroborated.\nI am a male attendant, and was at that time living with Mr.\nand Mrs. Jenkyns at 115 Marina, St. Leonards-on-Sea, as attendant\nto Mr. Jenkyns, and was with them till he died.\nI well remember Mrs. Jenkyns telling me of this dream when\nwe were sitting on the front in the morning of the day it happened,\nalso telling my wife what a strange dream it was.\nSo far as I can remember it was to the effect that Mrs. Jenkyns\nwas staying -at an hotel and while she was dressing she was\n\fCases. 301\ncalled away to another room to see a friend ;\nwhile there she\ndropped some of her jewellery, at which her friend remarked how\nunfortunate, and then told her the history of the room, namely\nhow a maid had found a button with a man's face on it and\nhad been killed by a motor car, a visitor had seen the same face\non a stud and met the same fate, and then when Mrs. Jenkyns\npicked up her jewellery the opal in her locket had become a\ncrystal, with the same face looking from it, and she screamed,\n\" I\nhave seen it, I shall be the next,\" with that she awoke. I was at\nhome when the accident happened, but a friend of mine was on a\ntram which was passing at the time and he sent me word. I went\nback at once and found the dream had come true, with the excep-\ntion that instead of being killed Mrs. Jenkyns was severely hurt.\nT. J. Lowi i\nP. 289. Dream.\nWE are indebted to Mr. F. Harcourt Page for the following\ncase of a premonitory dream, which resembles in its main\nfeatures the disaster to three British cruisers on Sept. 22nd,\n1914. Too much stress, however, should not be laid upon\nthe coincidence, for when we consider what a large place the\nwar occupies in the public mind, and the likelihood, therefore,\nof war incidents figuring in dreams, the scope for the occurrence\nof chance-coincidences is very great, especially in the case of\nan event so probable as that represented in Mr. Page's dream.\nMr. Page's account, which we reprint from The Er^nimj\nStandard and St. James s Gazette of Sept. 24th, 1914, is as\nfollows :\n\"THE TAMARISKS,\"\nEAST PRESTON, SUSSKX.\nDuring the night of Friday last, September 18, I had a dream in\nwhich I saw, with extraordinary clarity of vision, a large British\nwarship enticed close to what appeared to be the coast of Germany.\nSuddenly, by means of an instrument not clearly revealed, great\nflames leaped from the ship. Then two other British ships, similar\nin appearance to the one burning, appeared, hastening to the aid\nof their sister. They were steaming to their doom.\nThe first ship was but a lure to the others. A trap had been\nset, and 1 could see, in the small German ships that hovered in\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT. -Nov.\nthe vicinity, intense gratification at the approaching success of their\nstratagem. I was possessed of a fierce desire to do something, to\nwarn those oncoming vessels of the sure fate that would be theirs\nunless they stayed their approach. But with that utter sense of\nhelplessness experienced in dreams I could merely watch and avail\nnothing. As the first ship had become a mass of flame and then\nsunk beneath the sea, so did the other two share an identical end.\nQuite as remarkable as the above is the fact that while still\nasleep I was seized with the conviction that I must, as soon as I\nawoke, inform the Admiralty of the dream I had had, imploring\nthem to pass it on to the Fleet in the North Sea, hoping that by\nbeing forewarned a catastrophe might be averted.\nNeedless to say, on the Saturday morning, although I told my\nfriends (they will testify to the truth of this letter) of the remarkable\nvision I had had, I did not approach the Admiralty. Incredulous\nmyself of such phenomena, I was certain the Admiralty would not\nheed such a warning. Now, unhappily, it has come all too true.\nWhile I cannot assert that the small German ships I observed\nwere submarines, and further, so far as we know at present, the\nAboukir did not become a mass of flame before she sank unless\nthe torpedo from the submarine exploded in her magazine I think\nthat the dream I had last Friday night of the disaster reported in\nthis morning's papers is correct in nearly every particular.\nF. HARCOURT PAGE.\nThe following official statement regarding the disaster was\npublished in the morning papers of Sept. 23rd, 1914:\nHis Majesty's ships :\nABOUKIR (Captain John E. Drummond),\nHOGUK (Captain Wilmot S. Nicholson), and\nCRESSY (Captain Robert W. Johnson)\nhave been sunk by submarines in the North Sea.\nThe Aboukir was torpedoed, and whilst the Hogue and the Cressy\nhad closed and were standing by to save the crew, they were also\ntorpedoed,\nMrs. F. Harcourt Page writes :\n\"\nTHE TAMARISKS,\"\nEAST PRESTON, Oct. Wi, 1914.\nI am able to state that the dream which my husband had of the\ndisaster to three British cruisers in the North Sea he related to me\n\fi-.ni. <'**.\non the morning of Saturday, Sept. 19th. In fact, he awoke me\nabout 7 o'clock in the morning and told me he had had an extra-\nordinary dream, and there and then described it to me.\nBut being essentially an unbeliever in such things, and, further,\nonly half awake, I paid slight heed to what he said.\nI do remember, however, his clearly saying that he had seen\nthree large British warships sunk in the North Sea by a German\nstratagem, and that they had become a mass of flame before they\nsank.\nI also remember that he said that in his dream it had come to\nhim that he must write to the Admiralty and tell them, in order\nthat they might, by being forewarned, be forearmed.\nLater in the morning I heard him still talking about his dream,\nbut that as for writing to the Admiralty he certainly shouldn't do\nthis, as they would not pay any attention to it.\nHKI.KNK M. HAKCOUKT PAGE.\nMr. Frank Page writes :\nBox RIDGE AVENUE,\nPURLEY, Oct. 12th, 1914.\nI have been away from home lately, but on my return have\nfound letters from my son, Mr. Harcourt Page, of\n\" The Tamarisks,\"\nEast Preston, asking me to corroborate a dream he had in connec-\ntion with the loss by submarine attack of three of our large\ncruisers off the coast of Holland.\nAll I can say is this : I was staying with him at the time, and\none morning, two or three days before the disaster, he said to me,\n\" I've had a beastly dream about our ships.\" I said \" Oh.\" He\nthen added, \"I distinctly saw some of our big ships sunk by \"-\ntorpedoes, I think he said, but I cannot be certain whether the\nword was torpedoes or submarines. I have no faith in dreams, and\nconsequently showed no sympathy, and thus checked him from\nsaying more, which he was evidently going to do. Directly the\ndisaster happened he wrote home recalling what he had said, which\nI, of course, remembered.\nFRANK PAGE.\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Case.\nwas sitting in her room, when she became conscious of a\nfeeling of great depression and fatigue, which finally became\nso overpowering that, in spite of the fact that she was expect-\ning sevunil friends, she lay down on the sofa and sank into\na kind of swoon, a state between sleeping and waking, unlike\nanything she had ever experienced before. Whilst in this\ncondition, which lasted till after 9 p.m., she had an im-\npression of a sinking ship. This impression she related to her\nfriends when they arrived. None of them had at that time\nheard any news of a naval disaster. One of these friends\ncorroborates this statement as follows:\n[Received September 25, 1914.]\nI called on Miss [Jones] on August 6th at about nine o'clock.\nShe appeared to be very much exhausted or to be suffering from\nshock, and said that she had slept in the afternoon and dreamed\nof a sunk or sinking ship.\nE. M. G.\nMiss Jones' diary for August 6, 1914, contains the state-\nment :\nHad a bad dream of a ship sunk.\nIn the morning papers of August 7, 1914, the following\nannouncement appeared, having been issued by the Admiralty\non the previous evening :\nIn the course of reconnoitring after the minelayer Konigin\nLouise was sunk this morning, the Amphion struck a mine and\nfoundered. . . .\nPaymaster Gedge and over a hundred men were\nkilled. The captain, 16 officers, and 135 men were saved.\nFrom later accounts it appears that the Amphion sank at\nabout 7.30 a.m. on August 6.\n2. On Saturday, September 5, 1914, Miss Jones returned\nto her flat about lunch time, after calling on a friend. She\nfelt depressed and was unable to eat anything. At about\n2.30 p.m. she lay down and again sank into a kind of swoon,\nwhich lasted till 7 p.m. At about 5 p.m. she tried to rouse\nherself to make some tea, but could not. During this time\nshe again had an impression of a sinking ship,\n\"\na disaster in\nthe North Sea.\" She mentioned to a friend, Miss H., whom\nshe saw at about 2 p.m., that she felt very tired, and she\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1914.\nrelated her experience to another friend, Miss A., who dined\nwith her that evening.\nTo these same friends Miss Jones subsequently mentioned\nthe fact that on Sunday, September 6, 1914, at about 6 p.m.,\nshe had a strong impression that the allied forces had that\nday achieved a distinct success.\nThe following corroborations of this statement have been\nobtained :\n(1) Miss Jones' diary has an entry on September 5, 1914:\nHad a dreadful drowning sleep.\n(2) Miss A. writes as follows :\nSeptember 11, 1914.\nOn Saturday, September 5, I went to dine at 7.30 with Miss\n[Jones]. She told me she was feeling extremely exhausted, having\neaten nothing for some hours. She had lain for some hours in a\nheavy sleep, out of which she was powerless to arouse herself. She\nhad a strong impression towards the end, or at least during this\nspecies of trance, of the sinking of a ship. She felt sure we should\nhear very bad news, and asked me to recollect the date and nature\nof her experience.\nOn Sunday night Miss [Jones] wrote saying she felt much better,\nand was sure we should hear good news shortly.\nE. W. A.\nThe letter from Miss Jones to which Miss A. refers runs\nas follows :\nSunday Evening.\n... I think there'll be better news now. I had such a lightening\nabout six o'clock this evening.\n(3) Miss H. writes as follows :\nSept. 8, 1914.\nOn Sunday evening (Sept. 6th) between six and seven o'clock\nMiss [Jones] came to tell me that she felt certain the Allied Forces\nhad achieved success. She felt perfectly different, for on Saturday\nafternoon (5th) she had been dreadfully depressed, and had a heavy\nsleep.\nH. H.\nTwo disasters at sea occurred on Saturday, September 5,\n1914. The chief of these was announced by the Admiralty\non September 5 at 11.15 p.m., as follows:\n\fDEC., 1914. Case. 309\nH.M.S. Pathfinder, Captain Francis Martin Leake, struck a mine\nto-day at 4.30 p.m., about twenty miles off the East Coast, and\nfoundered very rapidly. The loss of life has probably been heavy.\nAt 1.30 p.m. on Sunday, September 6, 1914, the Press\nBureau issued the following announcement :\nThe Admiralty announce that the Wilson liner Runo was sunk\nby a mine at 4.35 p.m. yesterday, about twenty miles off the East\nCoast. All the crew and passengers were saved except about twenty\nRussian emigrants.\nIt will be seen that both these disasters occurred at about\nthe same time, 4.30 p.m.; that is to say after Miss Jones'\n\"\ntrance,\" or whatever it should be called, had begun, but\nprobably before or at about the time that she had an im-\npression of a sinking ship. In this connection it should be\nnoted that an earlier dream of Miss Jones', which is reported\nin the Journal, Vol. XVI., pp. 51 ff., appears to be of a\npremonitory character.\nAs regards Miss Jones' impression of some marked success\nfor the allied troops on Sunday, Sept. 6, 1914, the following\nextract from Sir John French's despatch of Sept. 17, 1914,\nis of interest :\nOn Saturday, Sept. 5, I met the French Commander-in-Chief at\nhis request, and he informed me of his intention to take the offen-\nsive forthwith. . . . He requested me to effect a change of front\nto my right. . . . These combined movements practically com-\nmenced on Sunday, September 6, at sunrise.\nThere was no mention in the news published on Sept. 6,\n1914, of any advance on the part of the Allies. The official\nreports from Paris published on that day say :\nOn our left wing the enemy appears to be neglecting Paris in\norder to pursue ^an ^outflanking movement.\nThe enemy reached La Ferte'-sous-Jouarre, and passed Reims,\nproceeding along to the^west of the Argonne Hills. . . .\nAnd later :\nThe German army continues to deviate from Paris, and still\npursues the south-easterly movement which was commenced two\ndays ago.\nAccording to reports which have been received, the enemy's\ntroops have evacuated the Compiegne-Senlis region.\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. c., 1914.\nMiss Jones' impression therefore was correct, and went\nbeyond what she might be expected to infer from previously\npublished statements.\nIt is, however, of much less evidential value than the other\nimpressions, in proportion as it relates to much less definite\nevents.\nMiss Jones has had two or three other impressions of events\nconnected with the war on land which seem to be more or less\ncorrect, but for various reasons they cannot now be made\nevidential, and therefore no report of them is given here.\nAs we pointed out in regard to a case which we published\nin our last Journal, it is not unlikely at a time of public\nanxiety such as the present that people should have impres-\nsions of disaster. But two considerations lend a particular\ninterest to Miss Jones' case, and increase the probability that\nthere is something in it beyond chance-coincidence :\n(a) Miss Jones has had two impressions of naval dis-\nasters, and both correspond approximately in time to the\nonly two disasters which had befallen the British Fleet up to\nSeptember 5, 1914, the date of Miss Jones' second impression.\n(5) These impressions derive a special significance from the\nmarked physical effect which they produced, an effect amount-\ning to temporary prostration. Miss Jones was in good normal\nhealth at the time, and has had no similar experiences before.\nPSYCHO-THEEAPY AND THE WAR\nTHE present moment seems suitable for drawing the attention\nof the Society to two organizations which aim at alleviating\nthe mental strain and shock caused by the war. These are\n(a) Lord Knutsford's scheme for a Hospital for Soldiers ;\nand\n(5) the Medico-Psychological Clinic, which was established a\nfew months ago at 30 Brunswick Square, London, W.C.\n(a) Lord Knutsford's scheme is in progress, and will be, it\nis hoped, shortly in operation. It is best described in the\nfollowing appeal, which was inserted in the Press by Lord\nKnutsford on November 2nd, 1914:\nThere are a certain number of our gallant soldiers for whom no\nproper provision is at present obtainable, but is sorely needed.\n\fDEC., HIM.\nPsyctio-Tkerapy and the War. :J1I\nThey are men suffering from very severe mental and nervous shock,\ndue to exposure, excessive strain, and tension. They can be cured\nif\nonly they can receive proper attention from physicians who have\nmade a speciality of treating such conditions.\nThese men are quite unsuitable patients for general hospitals, as\ntheir chance of recovery depends on absolute quiet, and on the indi-\nvidual and prolonged attention of the physician. If not cured\nthese men will drift back to the world as wrecks, and miserable\nwrecks, for the rest of their lives.\nThe physicians whose names, arranged alphabetically, I attach\nhave offered their services free to attend all these patients if a\nquiet home in London can be provided and one in the country. The\nscheme has received the sanction and support of the War Office.\nI hesitate to launch yet another appeal, and I regret that I have\nno time to get together an influential committee whose names\nwould be a lever to get the necessary money. But if the public\nwill trust me with .10,000 the scheme will be carried through,\nand I will do my best to see that it is properly worked. The names\nof the physicians willing to help and to form a committee of manage-\nment are a sufficient guarantee that the work will be well done.\nI would not undertake this extra burden were I not convinced\nthat there is a pressing need for this special form of help for our\nsoldiers.\nThe first object is to get a large and quiet house in London\nand then a convalescent home in the country. If more money is\nsent than is needed any balance will be given to the Red Cross.\nMoney can be sent and offers of houses made to the Hon.\nSecretary, Mr. C. R. Callard, c\/o Messrs. Richardson, Sadlers &\nCallard, 3 St. James's Street, S.W.\nLondon Hospital, E., November 2.\nThe list of names attached by Lord Knutsford is as follows :\nDr. Stanley Bousfield, Dr. Milne Bramwell, Dr. Douglas Bryan,\nDr. F.

DEC., 1914.\nwork done can be included, we hope to print an account\nof it in the Journal. In the meantime, our members should\nbear it in mind, with a view to referring suitable cases, later\non, to the organization, and to furthering the latter by sending\nsubscriptions to the Hon. Secretary, Mr. C. E. Callard.\n(6) The Medico-Psychological Clinic is the first of its kind\nto be opened in London, its only predecessor in Great Britain\nbeing the Liverpool Clinic, which was founded by the Liverpool\nbranch of the Psycho-Medical Society in 1905. (See Jouriial,\nVol. XV., pp. 271-272, and Proc., Vol. XXVI., pp. 373-374.)\nThe objects of the London Clinic are, as set forth in the\nprospectus, threefold :\n1. The treatment by medical and psychological means of func-\ntional nervous diseases and of functional disorders accompanying\norganic diseases.\n2. The advancement of this branch of Medical Science.\n3. The extension in the community of a knowledge of the laws\nof Mental Hygiene.\nThe hours of attendance are from 2 to 4 p.m. on Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and the fees for consultations\nand treatments are 2s. 6d. each.\nThe work of the Clinic is carried on in six departments, each\nunder the direction of a qualified medical practitioner having\nspecial experience in the work of the department and ably assisted\nby trained workers.\n1. Medical. DR. HILDA CLARK. A thorough physical examination\nis made of each patient (a) that unsuitable cases may be eliminated,\nand (b) that any conditions requiring treatment by medicinal or\ndietetic measures may be dealt with.

These are primarily intended for patients, but some will\nbe open to nurses and others who desire to qualify themselves as\nattendants to nervous cases of the character treated in the Clinic,\nor whose work brings them in contact with the problems of mental\nhygiene.\nThe members of the Medical and Psychological staff\n(including Consultants) are :\nDr. W. E. Armstrong, Dr. F. Aveling, Mr. G.' W. Badgerow,\nMr. Stanley Boyd, Dr. W. Deane Butcher, Dr. E. Farquhar\nBuzzard, Dr. Maud Chadburn, Dr. Hilda Clark, Dr. A. N. Leathern,\nDr. W. McDongall, Dr. T.

Stoddart, Dr. J. V. Swanberg, and\nMiss Julia Turner.\nThe following account of the work of the Clinic has been\nkindly contributed by a member of the staff:\nThe cases that the Medico-Psychological Clinic aims at assisting\nare cases of nervous and mental disorders, which are generally little\nunderstood and often passed over or barely recognized by the general\npractitioner. One reason for this inattention is that the patients\nthemselves often regard their complaints as something unusual or\neven peculiar to themselves, and are accordingly very reticent about\nthe matter, being perfectly sure that if they mention their disability\nthey will be considered odd or abnormal. The complaint may be a\ndisturbance of the physical functions as, for instance, excessive\nblushing or it may be, as in a larger number of cases, a mental\ndisorder. Among the latter are classed (a) phobias, e.g. unaccountable\nfears which perhaps present themselves suddenly of seeing or\nhearing of accidents, of going out alone, of passing high objects or\ncrossing open spaces ; (b) obsessions, e.<j. that evil or insanity will\nbefall, that friends have failed in affection, that misunderstanding\nor even persecution is to be feared ; (c) impulsive actions, i.e. actions\nwhich are performed more or less frequently under a sense of\nobligation which is not to be put aside, as, for instance, constant\nwashing of the hands, and the placing of objects in any given order\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEc.,1914.\nwhere the order is not of any intrinsic importance. Or the patient\nwho comes for relief may be the victim of an intolerable restlessness\nonly, or of an ungovernable irritability, or may suffer from intense\nphysical or mental exhaustion for which no adequate cause can be\ndetected.\nThe fear of being considered odd or unnatural is itself a painful\nmental disability, and arises perhaps from the natural but quite\nunreasonable fear of every aberration from normal mental health.\nThis fear is largely due to long-standing ignorance of the mind and\nits laws, and, to some extent, to the superstition of attributing such\naberrations to supernatural causes. But it is reasonable to assume\nthat deviations from mental health are likely to be at least as\ncommon as deviations from physical health ;\nand as few persons\npass through life without experiencing physical illnesses, it is not\nsurprising that the mind suffers similar disabilities, seeing that\nconsciousness is the most delicate and susceptible part of our\norganization.\nMental disorders are of various grades of severity, and arise from\nvarious causes. All those due to organic disease are outside the\nsphere of work of the Medico-Psychological Clinic, which is prepared\nto treat only those which are of psychic origin. In the absence\nof an In-patient Department which, it is hoped, will be added in\nthe future only those patients who are suitable for out-patient\ntreatment can be received at present.\nThe cause of the suffering of which our patients complain is\nattributed by psychiatrists to emotional shock, or mental conflict in the\nmajority of cases. An illustration of the former is seen in the case\nof a patient who became \"mind blind\" as a result of seeing a\nyoung relative attempt suicide. More commonly, mental conflict or\nprolonged mental strain, especially in early life, is at the bottom of\npsychic disturbances, the conflict being due to the persistent presence\nin the mind if not in consciousness of desires irreconcilable with\nthe general mental and moral outlook of the patient, or impossible\nto realise in the particular conditions in which the patient finds\nhimself. Often he is entirely unaware of the presence of the\ndisquieting complex, as it may have originated too long ago to be\nrecalled to memory ;\nbut none the less it remains a disquieting\nfactor in his mental life.\nThe customary method of treating these patients is by alternate\nscolding and exhortation. The unreasonableness of the fear, for\ninstance, is pointed out, and this, it is considered, should suffice\n\fDEC., nut.\nPsycho-Therapy an<\/ 1 1, It 315\nfor a re-habilitation. Unfortunately, however, the lesion lies in a\nstratum where the reason is a stranger. No amount of reason will\nbreak the spell, and this it is which in many cases constitutes the\nmost poignant suffering. In these circumstances, generally speaking,\nonly analysis followed by re-synthesis will help the patient to the\ndesired mastery of himself.\nBut as the process is a painful one, the whole-hearted co-\noperation of the patient is practically a sine qua non for success.\nHence the reaction of the patient is a factor of first importance, as\nin physical disease. For the psychasthenic or neurasthenic of long\nstanding to whom his ailments represent an interesting and im-\nportant part of life, this treatment like every other may fail to\nhave a beneficial issue, though, if fairly tried, it will offer a\nbetter hope than any other known means of cure.\nIn the case of some patients the injunction \"to put the trouble\nor worry out of the mind\" has been only too literally complied\nwith, with a result startlingly different from that intended, for a\npainful idea, or group of ideas, thus banished from the normal\nconsciousness may become a centre of disturbance in the sub-\nconsciousness, resulting in morbid mental or functional condi-\ntions. Cases of deeply seated trouble require in their treatment a\ngreat deal of time and infinite patience, both on the part of the\ndoctor and of the patient. The low level of the patient's physical\nhealth retards the process of treatment in the mental sphere and\nthis in its turn re-acts detrimentally on the physical health.\nFortunately the treatment in many cases may be appreciably\nshortened by useful adjuvants, as, for instance, massage, physical\nexercises and electrical treatment, which improve the physical\nhealth, while the mental treatment the more specially curative\npart is in process. Hypnosis, too, can often reach these lower\nlevels with success, when simple analysis would prove unduly long,\nif not impossible. Modern medical opinion is\ngreatly in favour\nof using other methods in preference to hypnotism if possible, and\nif hypnotism is employed the lighter degrees are always used first.\nAt the same time, it must be remembered that hypnotism is\na valuable ally in mental treatment, and that a great proportion\nof the popular prejudice against it is quite unfounded and even\nfantastic.\nHappily not all cases present the extreme of difficulty. Patients\nin whom the mental trouble is recent or easily traced derive much\nassistance from suggestion and therapeutic conversation alone.\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1914.\nIt will be evident from what has been said that treatment by\nmental means is in the majority of cases a very lengthy process and\nthat a great deal of skilled and patient labour is required. Hence\nin private practice where the doctor personally carries out every\ndetail of the process the fees are necessarily very high. A full hour's\ntreatment from two to four times a week for many weeks is\nnecessary in the case of analysis or therapeutic psychology, and\nfew patients relatively can afford the one or two guineas which\nrepresent the minimum that a doctor must necessarily charge per\ntreatment in private practice. Comparatively few patients therefore\nhave been able to avail themselves of this treatment up to the\npresent. The Medico-Psychological Clinic offers patients this form\nof treatment at about one-tenth the ordinary cost. The Institution\ndoes not cater for the ordinary hospital class, because a higher\naverage of intelligence and education is demanded than the majority\nof such patients possess, but for patients of the middle classes to\nwhom the specialists' fees would be an insuperable obstacle.\nOne means for achieving the reduction of the expense of treat-\nment is the institution of courses of lectures on therapeutic\npsychology at the Medico-Psychological Clinic. By their means\nexplanation is given in an impersonal manner of the processes of\nthe mind in health and disease accompanied by suggestions for the\napplication of these laws for practical guidance. Such teaching is a\nmeans of shortening some of the later stages of treatment. Non-\npatients who are interested, whether as social workers or from any\nother reason, are invited to join these courses.\nSir Lawrence Jones, who is the Chairman of the Board of\nManagement, adds :\nA new course of lectures will be given early next year, on Monday\nafternoons, as well as a course, on Wednesday afternoons, by various\nexperts, on the History and Methods of Psychology as applied to\nMedicine.\nThough the Clinic opened its doors in October, 1914, its equip-\nment, especially in the Laboratory and Electrical Department, and\nthe Library, is still deficient.\nIt is hoped that this notice may gain it fresh support, and enable\nit to extend its sphere of usefulness.\n\fDEC., 1914. \/froVir. ;;];\nREVIEW,\nDreams. By HENRI BERGSON. Translated by KIAVIN E. SLOSSON.\nT. Fisher Unwin, London, 1914. Pp. 62. Price 2s. 6d. net.\nTHIS is a translation in book form of a lecture delivered by\nProfessor Bergson before the Institut Psychologique in 1901.\nIt was at about this time or a little earlier that Professor\nFreud's great work on the same subject appeared, and it is rather\na curious fact that both of these attempts to solve one of the\ngreatest puzzles in psychology should have attracted so little atten-\ntion for many years. Both theories have certain common factors\nthough they also show important differences, and it will perhaps be\nuseful to show in what respects they differ from and resemble each\nother, so that those who are interested in the subject investigated\nmay decide which is the more suited to their own experiences.\nIt may perhaps help to clear the ground to point out that neither\nwriter allows any place for those dream sources which we describe\nas supernormal, at any rate with regard to the dreams of light\nsleep. Professor Bergson, however, is willing to concede that in\nthe experiences of deep sleep it is conceivable that telepathy may\nplay some part, and it is agreeable to find that he is brought to\nadmit this by \"the observations gathered by so rigorous a method\nand with such indefatigable zeal by the Society for Psychical\nResearch.\"\nThis concession, however, hardly amounts to more than an\nadmission that further investigation may prove valuable and is\nworth carrying on. We may therefore return to the dreams of\nlight sleep and his views as to their origin.\nHe believes, in the first place, that they arise from the mis-\ninterpretation by consciousness of the various bodily sensations\nwhich are experienced during sleep. These range from the so-\noalled\n\" retinal light,\" or variously coloured surface seen when the\neyes are closed, to vague visceral sensations which the pressure\nof the external world crowds out from the waking consciousness.\nThus he would account for the dreams which apparently foretell a\ndisorder of some particular organ, by the supposition that the brain\nis already receiving from that organ painful sensations which are\nnot sufficient to affect waking consciousness. He supposes that the\ncommon \"flying dream\" is due to the absence of pressure on the\nsoles of the feet, so that the body feels weightless.\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1914.\nBut it is evident that there are innumerable possible hallucina-\ntions which could be fitted in to such a vague picture as the retinal\nlight affords. What decides the form the hallucination takes 1 In\nthe first place, it is based on a memory of a past experience. He\nsupposes that we retain unconsciously memories of our entire past.\nIn waking life only those memories reach consciousness which\nsucceed in establishing a link with our present surroundings. In\nsleep we deliberately cut ourselves off from our surroundings (and\nit is in this cutting off or \"disinterestedness\" that he believes\nsleep to consist), and thus our store of memories all crowd to the\ndoor which has been left ajar and strive to reach consciousness.\nThe ones that succeed will be the ones that can best be fitted to\nthe bodily sensations previously described. Among these, however,\nthere is still some further selection, which depends on the \"peculiar\nrelaxation of the mind in the dream.\" This operates in such a way\nthat the memory image selected is the one which made the slightest\nimpression on the waking mind, the image of some object which we\nhave perceived almost without paying attention to it.\n\" The ego of\nthe dream is an ego that is relaxed; the memories which it gathers\nmost readily are the memories of relaxation, those which do not\nbear the mark of effort.\"\nThe resemblances of this view to that of Freud are obvious.\nBoth derive the dream experiences from memories, and they include\nunder this head fantasies or past imaginations of what might have\nbeen experienced. Both attribute a special importance to the casual,\nas distinct from the important or worrying, experiences of the pre-\nceding day. Both would allow some share in the work to the\nphysical sensations actually experienced at the time of dreaming,\nthough in Bergson's view this share is much greater than in Freud's.\nBut their differences are more fundamental than their resemblances.\nIt is clear that any satisfactory theory of dreams ought to answer\nthe question of why we dream. It is this that does not seem\naltogether clear in the work under review. It is not clear why all\nthese memories should take a hallucinatory form, why they should\nbe permitted to invade consciousness during sleep any more than\nduring waking life.\nUnless we can suppose that they fulfil some definite purpose, they\nwould seem to be only disturbing and on the whole noxious. It\nis of course well known that Freud believes that each dream is the\ndisguised fulfilment of some impulse of which the hallucinatory\ngratification may preserve sleep from disturbance.\n\fI'\" Review. 319\nAnother quality of dreams which has to be explained is the high\ndegree of emotion with which sonic dreams are experienced. it\nthey depended wholly on indifferent memories, it is hard to under-\nstand why, for instance, the dreamer should wake up cryirn\ncan only be supposed here that the indifferent experience has\nroused some buried and painful memory which is really responsible\nfor the dream.\nThe great difference therefore between these two theories can be\nexpressed by saying that Professor Bergson considers the dream\nto depend upon the memories which have excited least conscious\nattention, because such memories accord best with the relaxed or\n\"disinterested\" state of the dreaming mind, while Freud believes that\nthe dream is the gratification of some impulse, which is probably\nrepressed in waking life, but which is able to obtain a hallucinatory\ncarrying into effect during sleep because it has been able during\nthe preceding day to establish some link with a waking experience.\nHe would further say that the reason why this waking experience\nattracted apparently so little conscious attention was, probably, this\nvery linking up with the repressed impulse, which itself was repugnant\nto consciousness and was not allowed to reach it.\nWith respect to the question of the actual physical sensations\nof the sleeper as a source of dream, it is a matter of universal\nknowledge that they do form some part of the dream-material.\nMy own experience causes me to distrust somewhat the supposed\nsource of the flying dream in the absence of pressure on the feet,\nbecause the only form of this dream that I can remember having\nexperienced consisted in the ability to make enormous soaring jumps,\nreturning slowly to the ground after each, and it seems unlikely\nthat this would be produced by this cause. Probably, too, most\npeople have dreamed of holding .some object in their hand, and\ndiscovered on waking that the hand was empty, although the\nsensation of holding the object was extremely vivid and persistent.\nIn this case, too, there seems no local physical cause for the\nhallucination experienced.\nThis summary may perhaps be sufficient to enable our readers to\ndiscover which if either of these two theories accords best with\ntheir own experiences. In the nature of things proof is impossible,\nand the matter must remain one of opinion.\nIn his translator, Bergson has in our opinion fared very much\nbetter than Freud, possibly because his style is easier to render into\nEnglish. The only sentence which is open to objection is the state-\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.
