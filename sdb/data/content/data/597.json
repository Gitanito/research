HOLLAND'S SCRIPT.^\nBy Alice Johnson.\nPro'portion of Script printed.\nA CORRESPONDENT, Mr. J. Arthur Hill, asked me to state what\nproportion the printed parts of the script bear to the whole\namount produced during the period dealt with in my first\nReport, so that he might be able to form a rough estimate of\nthe proportion of evidential matter to the whole.\nThe script printed (which contained, as readers will have\nseen, a considerable quantity of non -evidential matter) amounts\nto about 65 per cent, of the whole. This may be divided\ninto three periods: {a) From September, 1903, to February,\n1904, about 68 per cent, of the script produced is printed\n(see Proceedings, Vol. XXL pp. 176-240); ih) From January\nto December, 1905, about 45 per cent, of the script is printed\n{op. cit. pp. 241-278); (c) From January 1st to April 15th,\n1906, about 90 per cent, of the script is printed {op), cit.\npp. 279-369). It is to be noted that a large proportion of\nthe cross-correspondences and other evidential matter belong\nto this third period.\nOf the matter unpublished: (1) the greater part consists\nof general reflections more or less similar to those printed in\nthe early part of the Report (pp. 192-219), and here and\nthere throughout it. (2) There are also allusions to Sir Oliver\nLodge and others of Mr. Myers's friends, a few of which\nwere printed. Most of these are omitted, partly as being too\npersonal to print, but still more because they could not in\n^ See Proceedinf\/s, Vol. XXI. pp. 166-391. All page references in this paper\nare to this volume, in connection with which the paper must be read.\n\fLX.] Supplementary Notes on Mrs. Holland's Script. 3\nany case be regarded as evidential. Thus, though Mrs. Holland\ndid not know either Mr. Myers or Sir Oliver Lodge personally\n(she met the latter for the first time at the end of the\nperiod of my first Eeport), she was acquainted with some\nof their writings and had come to know that they were intimate\nfriends. Hence she could form a pretty correct conception\nof their relationship to each other. There are indeed two\nor three cases relating to people whose special associations\nwith Mr. Myers were, as I have reason to believe, much further\nbeyond Mrs. Holland's ken, where the personal relationship\nis hit off in a few graphic phrases, suggestive of a certain\ndegree of supernormal perception, such as the description of\nDr. Verrall (p. 327). But here again, it is impossible to\nprove Mrs. Holland's complete ignorance of the matter, and\nfurther, the exactness of the portraiture must be more or less\na question of opinion.\nThere are further occasional references, as I stated, to Lady\nMount-Temple, chiefly about matters of fact known to Mrs.\nHolland, and a very few remarks about other persons known to\nher or included in the circle of her own friends.\nOf the matter omitted, only a very small proportion consisted\nof definite statements which, if correct, might have afforded\nevidence of supernormal knowledge ; so that, in considering how\nfar chance may account for the evidential statements which were\npublished, the omitted portions may practically be disregarded.\n\"The Eidolon\"\nI find that the word \" Eidolon,\" Mrs. Holland's use of\nwhich is discussed (pp. 215-218), occurs in a quotation from\nthe Iliad in a paper by Mr. Myers \" On recognised Apparitions\noccurring more than a year after death \" in Proceedings S.P.E.,\nVol. VI. p. 64. In his discussion there of the true nature\nof a \" ghost \" two lines from the Iliad are quoted, with\nDr. Leaf's translation of them :\n\" There is some soul and\nwraith even in Hades, but there is no heart in them,\" eidolon\nbeing rendered as vrraith. The next paragraph contrasts\nHomer's view of the condition of the dead with the famous\npassage from Plotinus about the shade of Herakles, cpioted\nagain in Human Personality, Vol. II. p. 290. The word\n\f4, Alice Johnson. [part\n\" Eidolon \" does not, I think, occur in Human Personality,\nwhich Mrs. Holland has read, so that it is interesting to find\nit in this the first important paper published by Mr. Myers\non phantasms of the dead, in the Proceedings which she has\nnot read. This additional fact does not make her use of\nthe word any more evidential of the influence of Mr. Myers,\nsince there are of course many other books in which the\nword is used in the same sense ; it only adds somewhat to\nthe appropriateness of the incident in connection with the\nMyers control.\nCompare Mr. Piddington's note on Mrs. Verrall's use of\nthe same word in her script of March 25, 1907, below,\np. 17.\nQuotations identified.\n(p. 260) Poem signed \" L. 0.\" Two correspondents have\ndrawn my attention to the fact that the two last lines of this\npoem (which is signed with the initials of Laurence Oliphant) :\n\" When the Invisible grows to fulfilment\nThe Woman soul leadeth us upward and on,\"\nare apparently a translation of the last part of the Chorus\nMysticus at the end of Faust, Part II., which is as follows :\nDas Uuzulangliche,\nHier wird's Ereigniss ;\nDas Unbeschieibliche,\nHier ist's gethan ; ...\nDas Ewig-Weibliche\nZieht uns hinan.\nBayard Taylor's translation of these lines is as follows\nEarth's insufKciency\nHere grows to Event;\nThe Indescribable\nHere it is done\nThe Woman-Soul leadeth us\nUpward and on !\n\fLX.] Supplementary Notes on Mrs. Holland's Script. 5\nThus it appears that the last line in the automatic poem is\nquoted from Taylor's translation, while the previous line (which\nis repeated four times in the poem) seems like a loose composite\nrendering of the previous four lines of the Chorus Mysticus.\nNeither Taylor nor the script gives a quite literal translation\nof these four lines, but the script is rather further than Taylor\nfrom the original. The whole of the automatic poem is not, I\nthink, founded on Faiist ; there are indeed certain superficial\nresemblances between it and the last scene in Faust ; but its\ncentral conception is much more appropriate to Laurence\nOliphant.\n(p. 291) Script of Feb. 28th, 1906. \"The Shameful\nHill\" (viz., Majuba Hill).\nMr. Andrew Lang tells me that this phrase is taken from\na poem of his on General Sir Ian Hamilton at Majuba, one\nline in which is\n\" The mists crept o'er the shameful hill.\"\nReferences to Mr. Baden Noel.\nIn regard to the phrase, \"was I a drone\" (p. 322), a\ncorrespondent points out to me that \" drone \" is an anagram\nfor \" Kodon,\" which confirms my view that the passage in\nwhich it occurred was intended to relate to Eoden Noel.\nAs to the passage \" Percival. Roden Noel\u2014Settle\u2014Seattle\nSeittle\u2014Cornwall\u2014where the one Ion\" street seemed to lead\ndirectly to the blue sea\" (p. 324), Mr. Noel's daughter\nwrites that he was much in Cornwall with Mr. Percy Addleshaw,\nwho says :\nEoden often called me \"Percival\" and often said that \"Percy\"\nwas an absurd contraction of the name. The word \" Settle \" or\n\"Seattle\" is, I imagine, \"Wrinkle,\" where he did stay with me\nfor a considerable time, and there is a street of the nature you\ndescribe. It leads to the edge of the cliff, and there is a path\nfrom the edge down which he used to go to bathe.\nMiss Noel remarks that the description of her father that\nfollows this passage in the script :\n\" Clear eyes under a broad\nbrow\u2014a shock of grey hair that was still thick\" (p. 324),\n\f6 Alice Johnson. [part\nis not very accurate. \" His hair was very thin latterly,\nthough curly, and it was hardly grey.\" My own recollection\nof the one occasion on which I saw him is that his hair was\nthen decidedly thick and curly, as shown in the portrait\nprefixed to his Collected Poems.\nAs to the words :\n\" Gary\u2014Carew\u2014Fowey. The Duchy \"\n(p. 350) which I associated with Eoden Noel, Miss Noel\nobserves that to his poem \" Fowey \" in the collected edition,\np. 435, there is a note: \"Carew says that Fowey etc.\"\nA Latin Passage in Mrs. Verrall's scrvpt.\nMr. Andrew Lang kindly sends me his interpretation of a\nLatin passage in Mrs. Verrall's script of March 21st, 1901,\nquoted on p. 379. By punctuating the Latin somewhat\ndifferently from what Mrs. Verrall had done, he arrives at\nthe following translation :\n\" Oh, if you cannot interweave, keep\non pertinaciously writing. Ponder all that you know. Soon\nwill come the inviolate light of the Sibyl, etc.\" ^ This brings\nout more clearly what Mrs. Verrall and I took to be the\nintention of the passage, as referring to my theory of cross-\ncorrespondences.\nSovic Cmwnients on Professor Gardiner's Peviciv.\nIn the Joicrncd of the American S.P.P. for November, 1908,\nappeared an able and discriminating analysis and criticism of\nmy Eeport by Professor H. Norman Gardiner, who writes, how-\never, under a misapprehension as to certain matters of fact\nwhich have an important bearing on the evidence and which\nI wish therefore to re-state.\nFirst, Professor Gardiner assumes that the possibilities of\nleakage of information in Mrs. Holland's direction were much\ngreater than was actually the case at the time her script was\nproduced. With the two or three exceptions mentioned below,\nthe whole of her intercourse with the S.P.E. (of which she is\n^Mr. Lang punctuates the passage thus: \"0 iiexere si nequis, pertinax\nscribas. Omne scituni perpeiicie, mox adveniet lux chalcidica inviolabilis.\"\nThe original script of this passage contains no capital letters and no\npunctuation points, except the period after the last word quoted.\n\fLX.] Supplementary Notes on Mrs. Holland's Script. 7\nnot, and never has been, a member) was carried on with me,\nand with me only. Almost all this intercourse was in writing;\nI preserved, of course, everything she wrote to me, often without\neven acknowledging it. I wrote to her comparatively seldom,\nand when I did so, generally kept copies of the whole of my\nletters. But in any case I always kept complete verhatim\ncopies of any statements of fact I made to her, or of any\nquestions I asked her about her script, (since questions may\nalways be suggestive), or of any remarks made about persons\nconnected with the S.P.E. who might be alluded to in the\nscript. The parts omitted to be copied consisted simply of\noccasional references to her own affairs, encouragement to her\nto go on writing, and expressions of gratitude for the trouble\nshe took to help in the experiments, etc.\nI saw her four times only during the period in question\nMrs. Verrall saw her twice only, on both occasions in my\npresence ; Mr. Piddington saw her once only, and that in my\npresence ; and Mr. Feilding (who at that time knew practically\nnothing of the scripts) met her once not in my presence.\nThese interviews no doubt influenced the scripts produced\nsubsequently to them ; but as I noted fully all the topics of\nconversation and facts mentioned, (Mr. Feilding having told\nme of what occurred on the occasion when he met Mrs.\nHolland), I know and have mentioned in my Eeport all the\nstatements of any definiteness in the script that can have\nbeen derived from them.\nMrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall have corresponded with each\nother directly only on the two occasions mentioned in my\nPieport (pp. 328-9 and 364), where practically the whole of\nthe correspondence is given. I have also seen all the corre-\nspondence\u2014some three or four letters in all\u2014that have passed\nbetween her and Mr. Piddington and Mr. Peilding up to the\npresent date (January, 1910).\nThis comprises the whole of Mrs. Holland's intercourse with\nany members of the S.P.E. who had any acquaintance whatever\nwith the experiments, or any intimate knowledge of the\nSociety's general work. I believe in fact that she met no\nother members of the Society at all, except Sir Oliver Lodge\nat a later period (see p. 348). The effect of her meeting\nwith Sir Oliver Lodge is described\u2014with, I think, the most\n\f8 Alice Jolmson. [part\nample allowance for any information that could have been\nderived from it\u2014on pp. 348-359.\nThis being so, the words used by Prof. Gardiner in speaking\n{Journal of the American S.P.R., p. 598) of \"her more intimate\ninitiation into the affairs of the S.P.E. and acquaintance with\nits personnel\" and still more in saying (op. cit. p. 611) \"Mrs.\nHolland did not know Dr. Hodgson, but she had met a\nnumber of persons who did,\" give a very misleading impres-\nsion of the actual state of the case.\nI fully agree with Prof. Gardiner that the various \" per-\nsonations \" in the script, however realistic and however closely\nthey resemble the persons represented, cannot be treated,\nstrictly speaking, as of any real evidential value. My view\nof this was, I think, made clear in my report. The persona-\ntion of Dr. Hodgson is somewhat more impressive than the\nothers, because the materials for it within Mrs. Holland's\nknowledge were apparently far more scanty than in the other\ncases, but it is impossible to state positively that they were\nentirely lacking. The most striking points in the Hodgson\ncontrol utterances are, I think, the cryptic mark \"K 57\"\nwhich was found to correspond with marks used by Dr. Hodg-\nson in some rough notes, and the name of \u2022' Q \", which was\ncorrectly given (pp. 30-4-310). Prof. Gardiner asks \"Why\nassume that that name, while the same as, was intended to\nrefer to, Dr. Hodgson's '\nQ '\n? If . . . some other Christian\nname had been used, would it not have been possible among\nthe vast mass of Dr. Hodgson's papers, to have discovered\nsomething which might be interpreted as an equally striking-\nconnection ?\n\" The reason why I think this name in Mrs.\nHolland's script refers to \" Q \" is that it occurs three times\nin connection with Dr. Hodgson and never in any other con-\nnection, and that it is the name of a person associated in a\nvery special manner with him.\nProf. Gardiner suggests a much more serious possibility of\n\" leakage \" in his criticism of the cross-correspondence \" Ave\nEoma Immortalis.\" I may remind readers that this consisted\nin allusions in Mrs. Verrall's scripts of March 2nd, 4th, and\n5th, and Mrs. Holland's of March 7th, 1906 (Pteport, pp.\n297-303). Of this, Professor Gardiner writes:\n\" \"We may surmise, indeed, that the evidence is not all in.\n\fLX.] Supplementary Notes on Mrs. Holland's Script. 9\n\\ye may suspect, for example, some hint in correspondence\nbetween Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland or Miss Johnson and\nMrs. Holland during the interval between Mrs. Verrall's first\nscript on March 2 and Mrs. Holland's script of March 7 ; Miss\nJohnson we may believe was '\ndiscreet,' but discretion is a\nrelative term when portions of the script of one automatist\nare being sent to the other for the discovery of pertinent\nincidents.\"\nAs to any hints \" in correspondence between Mrs. Verrall\nand Mrs. Holland,\" no correspondence whatever was taking\nplace between them at this time, and none took place during\nthe whole period of my paper, except on the two occasions\nmentioned above.\nAs to any possible hints in my own correspondence with\nMrs. Holland, I had not myself seen Mrs. Verrall's scripts of\nMarch 2nd, 4th and 5th, until some time after Mrs. Holland's\nscript of March 7th was produced. No indiscretion of mine,\ntherefore, however flagrant, could have given her hints con-\ncerning them. I may add that if I had committed any such\nindiscretion, I should certainly have mentioned it in my Eepoi't,\nas I have mentioned all circumstances known to me that have\nany bearing on the evidence ; for no one could fail to see that\nif Mrs. Holland had seen or heard anything of Mrs. Verrall's\nscripts before she wrote her own, the whole evidential value\nof the case would have been destroyed.\nProfessor Gardiner's main criticism of my theory of cross-\ncorrespondences is to a considerable extent vitiated by his\nfailing to take into account the order in which the events\noccurred. In his discussion of the \" Ave Eoma Immortalis\n\"\ncross-correspondence he says that the two automatists were\n\" experimenting for cross-correspondences at the time,\" and\nagain, \" there is at least the fact that both Mrs. Holland\nand Mrs. Verrall had at this time the thought of cross-\ncorrespondences in mind.\" But, as stated clearly in my\npaper, one reason why stress was laid on this case was\nthat at the time it occurred, no one\u2014as far as I have been\nable to discover\u2014had ever thought of the notion of cross-\ncorrespondences. The experiments between Mrs. Holland and\nMrs. Verrall were started in the hope of obtaining some\nevidence of telepathy between them (p. 250), and I think that\n\f10 Alice Johnson. [part\na good deal of such evidence was afforded. It was hoped that\nthey might produce veridical statements ahout each other (and\nthis occurred) or that identical or closely similar phrases might\nappear contemporaneously in both scripts. That this was in\ntheir minds is shown by the phrase in Mrs. Verrall's script\nof April 11th, 1906: \"There is an effort to have the same\nwords this time,\" and Mrs. Holland's remark :\n\" I can't help\nbelieving that we shall be tuned into accord some day and\nregister the same messages\" (pp. 363-4). This is a kind of\nexperiment between automatists that had been planned by Mr.\nMyers in his life-time (p. 371) and is what was apparently\nattempted in the cases recorded by Mr. Piddington (p. 372).\nThe notion that a statement in one script might be intended\nto complevicnt a statement in another came to me just after\nall the experiments recorded in my first Eeport. Soon after-\nwards I mentioned my theory to Mrs. Verrall and then to Mrs.\nHolland, to both of whom it came as an entirely novel idea.\nIt is certain that neither of them had it consciously in mind\nat the time of the experiments, nor had any of the persons\nwho were interested in their scripts.\nSince that time the idea has become familiar to them and\nhas no doubt influenced their scripts, so that it is a factor to\nbe reclioned with in the future.\nIt may, however, be argued that Mrs. Verrall's subliminal\nconsciousness had really evolved the idea some time previously,\nthough supraliminally she had never become aware of it. In\nthat case, the cross-correspondences might conceivably have been\nproduced by telepathy from her mind. With this argument\nand with some of my later critics who have upheld it I deal\nin the discussion on the theory of cross-correspondences at the\nend of my second Eeport on Mrs. Holland's script below.\n\fLX.] Supplementary Notes on \" Concordant Automatisms!' 11\nSUPPLEMENTAEY NOTES ON \"A SEEIES OF\nCONCOEDANT AUTOMATISMS.\"\nBy J.

On Feb. 27, 1907 (see p. 337), MyerSp\nmentioned \" My Star \" in connexion with the cross-corre-\nspondence \"Browning, Hope and Star\"; and on March 6\n{p. 340) \"George Pelham \" explained that \"My Star\" was a\npoem of Browning's which Myers had had on his mind \" because\n1 All page references in this paper, except where otlierwise indicated, are to\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXII., in connection with which tlie paper must be\nread.\n\f12 J. G. Piddington. [part\nit was one of his test experiments with a lady in the body to\nwhom he refers as V.\"\nAthougli, of course, I searched the scripts of the automatists\nfor allusions to My Star, I failed to discover any. But it\nhappened that an acquaintance of Mrs. Verrall's, Miss S., on\nreading the Eeport, though not looking for references to iiy\nStar, came independently to the conclusion that the words\n\" androsace, Carthusian, candelabrum \" in Miss Verrall's script\nof Feb. 17, 1907 (p. 08), were allusions to that poem, which\nruns thus\nAll that I know\nOf a certain star\nIs, it can throw\n(Like the angled spar)\nNow a dart of red,\nNow a dart of blue\nTill my friends have said .\nThey would fain see, too,\nMy star that dartles the red and the blue !\nThen it stops like a bird ; like a flower, hangs furled :\nThey must solace themselves with the Saturn above it.\nWhat matter to me if their star is a world 1\nMine has opened its soul to me ; therefore I love it.\nIt was Miss S.'s recollection of the Alpine flower Androsace\nas resembling a constellation of bright pink stars, of which one\nhere and there had faded to blue, that suggested \" My Star \" to\nher ; for she took the word \" Androsace \", followed in the\nscript by the drawing of an arrow-head and the words \" many\ntogether \", to refer both to the flower and to \" Now a dart of\nred, Now a dart of blue \". The other two words, \" Carthusian^\ncandelabrum \", are both names of flowers, the first being the\nname of a Dianthus (Carthusianorum) and the second that of\nan Acanthus. Many Dianthuses have a candelabrum-like inflor-\nescence, and Acanthus flowers might be described as \" hanging\nfurled \", so that these words also have a certain appropriateness\nin connexion with the poem. Miss S., however, interpreted\n\" candelabrum \" not as a flower but as an attempt to introduce\nthe notion of a prism, and thereby to represent \" the angled\n\fLX.] Su2oiolementary Notes on \"Concordant Automatisms.\" 13\nspar \" of the poem. As it happens, when Miss Verrall, before\nbeing acquainted with Miss S.'s conjectural interpretation, was\nasked what the word \" candelabrum \" in her script of Feb. 1\nsuggested to her, she replied at once: \"One of those old-fashioned\nchandeliers with glass prisms.\" Possibly \" candelabrum \" might\nbe taken to contain a double reference : that is to say, a\nreference both to \" iiower \" and to \" angled spar \".\nThe word \" dart \", which occurs twice in the poem and a\nthird time in the form \" dartle \", would be represented in the\nscript by the drawing of the arrow-head ; nor is it, I think,\nany objection to this interpretation that this drawing of an\narrow-head should thus have to perform the double function\nof representing \" dart \" and also one of the elements of the\ntriple cross-correspondence \" arrow \" (see Proc, Vol. XXII.\npp. 77-86).\nMiss Verrall's script of Feb. 3, 1907 (see p. 67) is clearly\nconnected with the one just discussed. This earlier script\ncontains both the word \" star \" and a drawing of a star, and\nends with the drawing of a bird and the word \" bird \",\nsuggesting the phrase in the poem \" Then it stops like a\nbird \". The later script also contains the word \" star \" and\na drawing of a star, followed by the words \" that was the\nsign, she will understand \".\n''\nStar \" is therefore prominent in\nthe scripts, as in the poem.\nI am not prepared to endorse Miss S.'s interpretation ; but\nI think it certainly deserves consideration.\n(pp. 82-83.) An Analysis of Mks. Verrall's \"Arrow\"\nScript (Feb. 18, 1907).\nI believe I have discovered the clue to some obscure\nassociations of ideas in Mrs. Verrall's script of Feb. 18, 1907.\nIf my solution of the puzzle is right, it supports the view\nexpressed in my paper (pp. 83-85) that this script was the\nresult of an attempt on the part of the scribe to get the word\n\" arrow \" written. In considering the analysis which follows,\nthe reader must, however, make allowances for my lack of\nliterary skill, which has made me represent in too downright\nand definite terms the subtle stages of a mental process of\nextreme complexity.\n\f14 J.

I suspect that,\nif this were so, it w^as the village (near Melle, in the\ndepartment of Deux Sevi'es) and not the well-known writer of\nthat name that was being thought of, for the train of ideas\nseems to be concerned at this i^oint with names of places, and\nnot with names of people.\nMont alian or Mont auhan. \" alban \" and \" auban \" repre-\nsent the result of the scribe's second and third attempts to\nget \" arrow \" written. This time, though only one, the initial,\nletter is right, the right number of letters is given.\nMont Alban, the French form of Mons Albanus, i.e. the\nhill of the city of Alba (Longa), whose name is derived from\nalha, meaning \" white \", suggests to the scribe \" Mont auban\ni.e. the French town of Montauban in Tarn-et-Garonne, which\nwas founded on the site of a Eoman station called Mons\nAlhanus.\n\" Alembert \", \" Mont alban \" and \" Mont auban \" introduce\nthe idea of French.\n\" The white hill.\" These words show that the scribe or the\nautomatist was thinking of the original significance of Mons\nAlbanus, the hill of the White City.\nAt this point the scribe stops trying to get the woirl \" arrow\n\"\nwritten, because he suddenly realises that certain associations\nof ideas, aroused in his mind by what has appeared in the\nscript, could be so utilised\u2014if he could but get the automatist\nto share them\u2014as to lead on to an idea closely and frequently\nallied with \" arrow \", and that this in turn might lead to\ngetting \" arrow \" itself expressed as well.

J. Arthur Hill, who independently suggested that the script con-\ntained an allusion to Joan of Arc due to an association of ideas with \"arch\"\nand \"arrow\", points out that \" de Lys\" was the name under which Joan\nof Arc\"s family was ennobled after her death. If the scribe was thinking\ngenerally of the verses in which come the words \" la royne Blanche comme\nung lys\", and particularly of Joan of Arc, \"Blanche de Lys\" (note that\n\"Lys\" is written with an initial capital) may be accounted for as a\n\"portmanteau\" resulting from a fusion, which was also a confusion, of the\ntwo ideas.\n\f16 \/% II \/^i, 0.l]^Mc\/in(jt'Qfi'lfCl [part\nobjective (arrow) and would only indicate symbolically a word\nthat was waijtred :\n(r.i?.

The scribe, it\nwill be observed, is aware that though the word \" Arch\nobsesses him, it is not the word he wants :\n\" There has been\ngreat confusion here, and I do not think anything has been\naccurately said.\" The probably undesigned use of the word\n\" accurately \", which contains the letters arc, helps the scribe\nto introduce other words containing the same three letters,\nnamely, \" accurate \" and \" aclcuranda \".\nTo me it seems certain that the scribe\u2014whether that be\na part of the automatist's consciousness or an external mind,\nor a mixture of the two\u2014knew that the word wanted was\nctrc. The automatist appears to have vaguely apprehended the\nFrench word cere (although she did not write it), for both\nmeanings of it are expressed in the script : the meaning\n\" bow \" by the two bows drawn back to back, and the mean-\ning \" arch \" repeatedly in the last part of the script. That\nshe emphasised the second meaning, and not the first, may\nhave been due to her having been put on to a wrong scent\nby an association of ideas between the word \" arch \" and the\nname \" Archipiada \", which occurs in this same poem of\nVillon's, though not in the passage where Jeanne d'Arc is\nmentioned.\nLiTEEARY Personation.\n(pp. 227-9.)

There is a march and uprising through ideal spaces which\nsome hold as the only true ascent ; there is an architecture which\nsome count as alone abiding,\nSeeing it is built\nOf music, therefore never built at all,\nAnd, therefore, built for ever.\nWhether considered in relation to its development in the race, or\nto its activity in the individual, Music resembles not so much a\nproduct of terrene needs and of natural selection as a subliminal\ncapacity attaining to an accidental manifestation independently of\nthe requirements or of the external stimuli of the supraliminal self.\nWe know the difficulty of explaining its rise on any current theory\nof the evolution of human faculty. We know that it is like some-\nthing -discovered, not like something manufactured ; \u2014like wine found\nin a walled-up cellar, rather than like furniture made in the\nworkshop above. And the subjective sensations of the musician\nhimself accord with this view of the essentiall}^ subliminal character\nof the gift with which he deals. In no direction is \" genius \" or\n\"inspiration\" more essential to true success. It is not from careful\nporing over the mutual relations of musical notes that the master-\npieces of melody have been born. They have come as they came\nto Mozart, \u2014whose often-quoted words I need not cite again, \u2014in an\nuprush of unsummoned audition, of unpremeditated and self-revealing\njoy. They have come, as to Browning's Aid Vof\/ler, with a sense of\nirrecoverable commingling of depths of soul and heights of heaven.\n(7) id. ib. p. 299, where in a script of Mrs. Verrall's full\nof allusions to Death is introduced a quotation from the Acneid,\n\u2014Manibus date lilia plenis\u2014which, together with its context,\nhad clearly been a special favourite of Frederic Myers's.

The Connexion between \"In Memokiam \"\nAND avTO<i oiipapo? ukv\/j-wv.\nIt was the occurrence in Mrs. A^errall's script of March 6,\n1907 (see Proc. Yo\\.

An Associate of the Society, Miss W. B. Hammond,\nhas pointed out how appropriate it is that the quotation\nshould have come from this particular Section, inasmuch as\n\f20 G. Piddington. [part\nreference is made in it to three of the conditions\u2014calm of\nearth, sea, and air (see Proc. Vol. XXII. p. 126)\u2014which\nPlotinus {loco citato) says are essential to ecstatic communion\nwith the Divine. Thus\n\" Calm and deep peace on this high wold \"...\n\" Calm and still light on yon great plain \"...\n\" Calm and deep peace in this wide air \"...\n\" Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,\nAnd waves that sway themselves in rest \"...\nIt seems possible, then, that not only were Sections XCIV.\nand XCV. of In Memoriavi, as Mrs. Verrall suggested (see\nProc. Vol. XXII. pp. 118-122), influenced by the Plotiaian\npassage, but that Section XL was also.\nFurthermore, a comparison of Sections XI. and XII. with\nSections XCIV. and XCV. seems to me to show that the\nparallelism between the passage from the Pnncades and In\nMemoriani is more extensive than Mrs. Verrall supposed.\nPlotinus taught that before communion with the Great Soul\ncould be attained not only must nature be at peace, but the\nsoul likewise must be \" collected into calm.\" Now in the\ntrance described in Section XII. this last condition is lacking\nfor, though there is calm of a kind\u2014the calm of despair\nin the poet's heart, he is at the same time filled with \" wild\nunrest \" (Sections XV. and XVI.). Hence, though he seems\nto himself to leave the body and hover about the ship that\nbears his friend's corpse homewards through distant seas, there\nis no true Vision : the experience is purely subjective ;\nnothing\nis contributed to it, as in genuine ecstasy, from outside ; it\ninvolves no contact with another mind. It is only in the\nlater trance, described in Sections XCIV. and XCV., when all\nthe Plotinian conditions are fulfilled : when, that is to say, not\nonly nature is at peace but the poet's \" spirit is at peace with\nall\" as well, that communion with the Divine Soul and with\nthe spirit of his friend ensues :\n\"it seem'd at last\nThe living soul was flash'd on mine.\nAnd mine in this was wound, and whirl'd\nAbout empyreal heights of thought,\nAnd came on that which is. . .\n.\"\n\fLX.] SuiTplementary Notes on \" Concordant Automatisms.\" 21\n(pp. 116, 145 and 238.) Mrs. Verball's Script of March\n11, 1907.\nI remarked (p. 116) that the language of this script (quoted\non p. 145) is reminiscent of the last stanza of F. W. H.

There are, besides,\nWordsworthian touches in it, as comparison with two passages\nin Wordsworth's Prehide, Book I, \" One summer evening ... a\ntrouble to my dreams \" and \" Ye Presences of Nature . . .\nwork like a sea ?\n\", will show.

[part\nright has been amply proved by Mr. Dorr's recent sittings in\nAmerica (see, e.g., below, pp. 104, 105), which contain dozens of\nabsolutely conclusive instances of these phrases, and especially of\n\" I said \", being used not only in the waking-stage, but in the\ntrance-script as well, with reference to cross-correspondences.\nAnd this frequent usage was not due to any suggestion of\nmine (or, for that matter, of any one else's), as neither Mr.\nDorr nor Mrs. Piper was aware of the interpretation I had\nput upon it.\n(p. 182.) Mrs. Vekrall's Sciupt of March 20, 1907.\nAs pointed out above (p. 21), Mrs. Verrall's script of\nMarch 11, 1907, probably contains reminiscences of Words-\nworth's Prelude. The phrase, \" the Evangelist is oiir patron \",\nin her script of March 20, 1907, among a series of references\nto St. John's College, Cambridge, is also probably reminiscent\nof a line in Book III. of the Prelude, in which Wordsworth,\nspeaking of his life at Cambridge, says :\n\" The Evangelist\nSt. John my patron was.\" Dr. Hodgson\u2014whose acquaintance\nwith the English poets was extensive\u2014often used to express\nhis pride at having been a member of the same college as\nWordsworth.

Only 48 hours separate the two scripts,\nand Mrs. Holland's was written on a day of the week,\nWednesday, on which connexion with Mrs. Verrall's was\nspecially aimed at (see pp. 206-7, 225, and 291). More-\nover, while Mrs. Verrall's \" Claviger \" script refers to\n\" shadow \" and indicates that it is the subject of a cross-\ncorrespondence ; Mrs. Holland's \" Peter \" script contains the\nword \" Shadow \" twice. Accordingly if \" Peter \" is taken as\nan allusion to \" Claviger \", these two scripts show two points\nof contact at least. And they may show more, for, if my\ninterpretation of the group of automatic writings discussed\nin Section XIX. of my paper is right, they both furnished\nseveral contributions to the Concatenation of Ideas. See\nfurther the cross-correspondence Janic\/dam in Miss Johnson's\npaper below% p. 204.\n(pp. 265-268.) Mrs. Holland's Script of April 8, 1907.\nI pointed out that the allusions contained in this script\nto Leah and Eachel, and Martha and Mary, as alternative\ntypes of opposite temperaments, were almost certainly borrowed\nfrom Dante, partly from Convito IV., 17; 85-111, and partly\nfrom Purgatorio, Canto XXVII. This theory as to their\nsource was strongly supported by the fact that in Cantos\nXXVII. and XXVIII. of the Purgatorio are to be found\ngrouped together several of the topics which emerged about\nthis time in Mrs. Verrall's script and Mrs. Piper's trance.\nIn a foot-note to p. 267 I drew attention to the fact that\nMrs. Holland, who frequently (I might have said, usually)\nrecognises and points out the source of literary allusions\nand quotations contained in her script, did not know the\nsource of the allusions to Martha and Mary, and Leah and\nEachel. At the time of writing I supposed that Mrs.\nHolland must at some time or other have read Pa.rgatorio,\nCanto XXVII., and either Convito IV., 17; 85-111, or a\nquotation of it in a commentary on the Purgatorio passage\na'nd that .she had subconsciously retained and reproduced\nrecollections of them, although they had passed out of her\nconscious memory. The following statement, however, made\nby Mrs. Holland on April 9, 1909, in response to my\n\f24 J. G. Piddington. [part\nenquiries, makes it very difficult to maintain this supposi-\ntion :\nMy knowledge\u2014or rather, my ignorance\u2014of Dante is that of the\nman in the street. I have always intended to read the Bivina\nCommedia, if only in translation, but have never done so. When\nI was in [Italy] eight years ago, I bought a little velUmi-covered\nCommedia, and found it far too difHcult for my budding Italian.\nThe lady who gave me lessons made me read Tasso with her.\nI am fairly familiar with the Vita Nuova because of Rossetti's\nbeautiful translation ; but I do not even know the scheme of the\nCommedia. It will be simplest to set down the little I know of\nit: Virgil is Dante's guide through the Inferno, and over its gate\nis written \"All hope abandon, ye who enter here.\" Of course I\nknow the Paolo and Francesca story ; and some Dore illustrations\nseen long ago dealt horribly with the \" sea of thick ribbed ice,\"\nthe sinners head downward in flames, and the enchanted tree\nthat bled and moaned when a branch was broken. Dante meets\nBeatrice ultimately, but I do not know where. I cannot remember\nanything else.\nWhen I was at \u2022\nlast month I glanced through a translation\nof the Commedia to see if I could find the \" Leah and Eachel\npassage, but I could not. I chanced upon the \" sevens \" passage,\nwhich interested me, as Miss Johnson had told me of a reference\nto it in the script [see Miss Johnson's paper, p. 241], and I am\ncertain I never read the passage before. My father was saying\nlately it was disgraceful of us not to possess a translation of\nDante.\nThis statement may be supplemented by an extract from\na letter addressed to Miss Alice Johnson by Mrs. Holland\non April 8, 1909 :\nThis morning came a note from Mr. Piddington asking about\nmy knowledge of Dante. I shall have to confess my ignorance.\nMy father was saying just the other day that it was rather\nshocking we have no translation of Dante. \" Should we read it\nif we had?\" asked I. \"Well, no\"; and there we left it.\n\fLx.] SuiDplementary Notes on \"Concordant Automatisms.\" 25\n(pp. 215-220). Mrs. Holland's Script of April 16, 1907.\nIn this script, likewise, there appears an allusion to a\nliterary passage unknown to the automatist.^ The allusion\nis made in the words \"Lucus(?) To iiy to find Euripides\nPhilemon\"; which, as explained in detail on p. 217, clearly\nrelate to Browning's Aristophanes' Apology. \" Euripides \" was\nmentioned by Myersp in a context which strongly suggests\nthat it was meant to be a cross-correspondence, and anyhow\nEuripides figured prominently in two of Mrs. Verrall's scripts.\nA triple cross-correspondence of a simple and direct type\nwas accordingly created by the appearance of the name\nEuripides in the three scripts. The allusion to Browning's\nAristophanes' Apology, however, both strengthened the coinci-\ndence and made it more complex and less direct ; because the\nnames Euripides, Lukos {i.e. \" Lucus \") and Philemon point to\nthe verse-translation of the Hercules Furcns incorporated in\nAristophanes Apology, and Mrs. Verrall's two \" Euripides\nscripts (March 4 and 25, 1907, see pp. 213-4) both explicitly\nrefer to the Hercules Furens of Euripides. A striking point was\ntherefore made by the allusion in Mrs. Holland's script to\nBrowning's poem, which would have appeared to be dragged in\nsuperfluously, had Mrs. Verrall's script, like Mrs. Piper's, men-\ntioned \" Euripides \" only, and not the Hercules Furcns as well.\nYet though the reference in her script to Aristojjhanes'\nApology is clear, it would seem not to have emanated from\nMrs. Holland's mind. Early in November 1907 Miss Johnson\nwrote to Mrs. Holland, and, without explaining why, put this\nquestion to her :\n\" Have you read Aristujjhanes Apiology ?\nOn November 24, 1907, Mrs. Holland replied as follows:\nI have not yet attempted to read Aristophanes' Apology. It and\nRed Cotton Night Cap Country and the person whose name I forget\nwho worked in distemper [i.e. Pacchiarotfo], are three peaks in the\nBrowning range I still wait to scale.\nIt is of course conceivable that in casually turning over\nthe leaves of her Browning Mrs. Holland may have noted\nand have subconsciously remembered and afterwards reproduced\n-'With this and the preceding case the \" Roden Noel'' incident described\nin Proc. Vol. XXI. pp. 316-327 should be compared.\n\f26 .\/. G. Piddington. [part\nin her script the names, Lukos, Euripides and Philemon. But,\nif this is tlie true explanation, I would remark that her\nretention and reproduction of these three names were singularly\nfortunate ; for they seem nicely calculated to fix the precise\nreference which was required to bring about a complex\ncross-correspondence. Euripides and Philemon without Lukos\nwould have suggested the two Greek dramatists of those names,\nrather than l-5rowning's Aristo-phancs Ajjology. Philemon and\nLukos alone without Euripides, while suggesting Browning,\nwould not have produced the triple cross-correspondence on the\nname Euripides. Euripides and Lukos alone without Philemon,\nwhile fixing the reference to Euripides' Hercules Furens, would\nnot have brought in Browning's verse-translation of the Hercides\nFurens ; whereas part of the complexity, as I think, of\nthe cross-correspondence, consisted in the fact of one script\nreferring to Euripides' play and of another script referring to\nBrowning's translation of the play.\nOn April 22, 1908, a year after the allusion to Browning's\nAristophanes Ap)ology in Mrs. Holland's script, came what\nmust, I think, be admitted to be an allusion to the same poem\nin Mrs. Piper's trance by Myersp. In order to show what\nled up to the allusion a few extracts from sittings previous to\nthat of April 22, 1908, must first be quoted:\u2014\nExtract from record of sitting with Mrs. Piper held on\nApiril 13, 1908.\n(Present: G.

[part\nMr. Dorr's contemporaneous note on this incident is as\nfollows :\n\" The reference to a translation by Browning from\nEuripides, or from the Greek plays at all in fact, is interest-\ning, for I did not know that he had made any such until I\nlooked it up at the sitting ... in the book of Greek Ode\ntranslations which I had brought with me to it. Finding\nthere a translation by Browning from the Hcrctdes Furens I\nglanced it through, and read a few lines here and there to\nsee if the control would identify the ones referred to ; but\nnothing was identified, unless it were the lines in which\nHercules' coming to the Hesperides and the plucking of the\ngolden apples is described.\"\nMyersp, it will be noticed, said that the lines from Brown-\ning, written by Mrs. Verrall, \" describe one of our messages\nhere \" ; and then identified the lines as those referring to the\napples plucked by Hercules in the garden of the Hesperides\nand added, \" She quoted it in answer to apple \".\nIsTow this was all quite consistent, for on March 23, 1908,\nMyersp had chosen \" apple \" as a cross-correspondence, and on\nApril 6, 1908, had claimed to have given \"apple\" to Mrs.\nand Miss Verrall.^\nWe find then that, while in April, 1907, Mrs. Holland's\nscript completes and elaborates a trijjle-correspondence on the\nsubject of Euripides and the Hercules Furens by an allusion to\nBrowning's Aristophanes' Ajjology ; in April, 1908, MyerSp\nclaims to have brought about a cross-correspondence on the\nsubject of \" apple \" by making Mrs. A^errall write \" a few verses\nfrom Browning which I gave her from Euripides \" ; the con-\ntext showing that he meant thereby Browning's translation of\nthe Hercules Fttrens, which is embodied in Aristophanes'\nApology. Neither Mr. Dorr nor Mrs. Piper was in any normal\nway aware that \"Euripides\" or the \"Hercules Furens\" was the\nsubject of a cross-correspondence ; and neither had seen or\nbeen told about Mrs. Verrall's scripts of March 4 and 25,\n1907, or Mrs. Holland's script of April 16, 1907.\nOnly twice was Euripides mentioned in the course of Mr.\nDorr's sittings: first, in the passage quoted, on April 22,\n1908, and a second time in the waking-stage of the trance\n^See Mrs. Sidgwick's paper, pp. 190-3, for a reference to the golden apples\nof the Hesperides in Miss Verrall's script and to this whole incident.\n\fLX.] Su2^plementary Notes on ''Concordant Automatisms.\" 29\nof May 4, 1908, when the name only was uttered discon-\nnectedly. And out of some 70 or 80 cross-correspondences\narranged for at Mr. Dorr's sittings MyerSp claimed to have\ngiven Mrs. Verrall only one other quotation from Browning,\nand that was on May 8, 1908, when he said he had given\nher \" Grow old along with lue,\" which is a line from JRahhi\nhen Ezra (see Miss Johnson's paper below, p. 223).\nThat MyerSp should have brought up the subject of Brown-\ning's translation of the Hercules Furcns just after Mr.\nDorr had made a reference to Hercules and Atlas is, I think,\ninteresting in view of the suggestion put forward in my paper\n(Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 257-8), that Atlas might be impli-\ncated in the references to Hercules and Prometheus in Mrs.\nVerrall's \" Euripides \" and \" Hercules Furens \" scripts.\nI know that some people, who have no doubts as to the\nreality of telepathy, nevertheless hold that, though an idea\nmay be impressed from outside on an automatist's mind, the\nform in which it is expressed in the automatist's script is\nnot determined by the external agency, but solely by the\nautomatist's own peculiar mental habits. Thus, in the first of\nthese two cases, while they would readily agree that the\nabstract idea underlying the references to Leah and Rachel,\nand Martha and Mary, was impressed on Mrs. Holland's mind\nby the agency which impressed cognate ideas on Mrs. Piper's\nand Mrs. Verrall's minds, they would argue that the form in\nwhich Mrs. Holland's script clothed it was determined by Mrs.\nHolland's own recollections of two Dante passages. That the\nform in which an idea is expressed in a script is very often\nthus determined, I do not for a moment doubt ; but I see no\ngrounds whatever for supposing that it invariably is. If tele-\npathy is a fact, what is to prevent a percipient receiving an\nidea in a particular concrete form hitherto unknown to him,\nprovided that this novel form can be communicated by means\nof a combination of words or other symbols already familiar\nto him ? When, then, a script contains a quotation or an\nallusion to a passage in literature which we have good reasons\nfor thinking was unknown to the automatist, and when, as in\nthese instances, there is evidence to show that the automatist is\na good telepathic percipient; when she has, moreover, given ample\n\f30 J. G. Pidd'mgton. [part\nproofs of candour and accuracy, no proofs of reluctance, and\nmany of readiness,\u2014nay, of eagerness\u2014to reveal all her normal\nsources of knowledge, why need we conclude that the quotation\nor allusion was merely a revived memory rather than a message\nimpressed upon the automatist ab extra ?\nIf these were the only appearances in script or trance-\nutterances of literary allusions apparently unknown to the\nautomatist, it might be hazardous or premature to claim them\nas anything more than revivals of submerged memories ;\nbut,\nas we shall see later (in the papers by myself and Mrs. Verrall\nbelow, pp. 39-150, jmssm), they do not stand alone.\n(pp. 296 and 304.) \"Six Tykannus.\"\nWith regard to the words \" six . . .

Hammond points\nout tliat they are clearly intended ibr \"Sic semper Tyrannis,\" the\nmotto of the State of Virginia. She adds :\n\" These words were\nspoken by John Wilkes Booth when he shot President Lincoln,\nApril 14, 1865. The date, which few Americans would\nforget, might have something to do with the appearance of\nthis quotation in the trance of April 17.\"\nIt is worth remarking that Mrs. Piper gave these words in\nthe same context as Thanatos (Death), which formed the subject\nof a cross-correspondence with Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall,\nand they seem to reinforce and emphasise her mention of\nDeath. Mrs. Holland's contribution to the same cross-corre-\nspondence was also found by Miss Johnson (see her paper\nbelow, p. 221) to be more complete than I had represented it.\nMiss Hammond also tells us that \" United we stand, divided\nwe fall\" (words spoken in the trance of January 2, 1907:\nsee Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 316-317) is the motto of another\nState.\n\fLX.] Further Experiments with Mrs. Piper in 1908. 31\nFUETHER EXPERIMENTS WITH MRS. PIPER IN 1908.\nIntroduction.\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Mrs. A. W. Verrall and\nJ. G. PiDDINGTON.\nIn the spring of 1908 a series of 21 sittings in Boston with\nMrs. Piper was carried out by Mr. G. B. Dorr, a Vice-President of\nthe Society for Psychical Research, he being himself the sole\nsitter throughout. It is with certain results of this series\nof sittings that the following three papers deal.\nMr. Dorr was a friend of Dr. Hodgson's, and had had\nmany previous sittings with Mrs. Piper. On this occasion\nhis object was twofold. In the first place he desired to\ncontinue the experiments in cross-correspondence with other\nautomatic writers on the lines of the English experiments\nin 1906-1907, described in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXII.,\nwith a modification of the conditions introduced by two new\nfactors : (\u00ab) the other automatists were wholly ignorant that\ncross-correspondences were being attempted, or even that sittings\nwere being held at all ;\nih) the sitter was not in communica-\ntion with any of the other automatists, and had no access\nto the scripts they produced, so that thought-transference\nfrom the sitter was throughout eliminated as' a possible cause\nof any interconnexions which might exist. In the second\nplace he tried the very interesting experiment of \" reviving\nthe literary memories \" of the trance-personalities, with a view\nto obtaining statements that might help to solve the problem\nof the identity of those personalities.\nThe papers that follow, by Mrs. Verrall and Mr. Piddington\nrespectively, deal with the second of the above mentioned\n\f32 Mr.'^. SidgivicJc, 3f)'s. Verrall, and J. G. Piddington. [part\nclasses of experiment\u2014Mrs. Verrall's giving a general con-\nspectus of the evidence and Mr. Piddington's dealing mainly\nv\/ith a remarkable special case. In the third paper, by Mrs.\nSidgwick, the cross-correspondences and interconnexions between\nthe automatists are discussed.\nIt is hoped that for students of Mrs. Piper's trance utter-\nances the cases described and the extracts quoted from the\nsittings give substantially all that in the present series of\nsittings (which if printed in full would run to over 200 pages)\ncan be said to throw new light on the nature of the intelli-\ngence at work. Without describing every incident falling\nunder either of the above heads, great care has been taken to\ngive, as far as possible, a fair general impression both of the\ndegree of success attained in the whole series of experiments\nand of the extent and nature of the failures, and we have been\ncareful also to omit nothing that bears on any experiment\nselected for full description. Moreover, the complete records\nwill of course be preserved.\nAs in other cases of Mrs. Piper's trance, of which accounts\nhave recently been published, the communicating intelligence\ncalls itself \" Myers \" or \" Hodgson \" or \" Eector,\" the latter\nprofessing as usual to act as amanuensis, though \" Myers\nand \" Hodgson \" also at times write directly. In the waking-\nstage, as before, Mrs. Piper speaks in pro'prid persond, repeating\nwhat she hears or describing what she sees. Neither the\nspoken utterances of the waking-stage, nor those written during\nthe deeper trance, seem to remain in Mrs. Piper's normal con-\nsciousness when she has returned to her ordinary waking life.\nWhat psychological facts underlie the drama; whether the\npersonalities who appear to take part in it are merely phases\nof Mrs. Piper's consciousness ; how far they are in telepathic\ncommunication with other minds, either of living persons or\nof persons no longer in the body ; and if they are, whether\nthere is any truth in the claim that intelligences other than\nMrs. Piper's are actively and deliberately concerned ;\nand,\nin any case, what are the relations of the personalities to\neach other ;\n\u2014all these questions which recent evidence about\nautomatism has brought so prominently forward in our Pro-\nceedings are again raised by the present series of sittings.\nAnd we think it will be generally admitted that these\n\fLX.] Further Experiments ivith Mrs. Piper in 1908. 33\nsittings furnish an important contribution to the accumulating\nevidence in which answers to these questions must be\nsought.\nIt is hardly necessary again to remind the reader that in\ngiving, e.g. the name MyerSp or MyerSy, or even Myers by\nitself, to the communicating intelligence, we are not doing any-\nthing so question-begging as to assume that that intelligence\nis Frederic Myers. We are merely giving it for brevity and\nconvenience the name which it gives itself, adding a suffix to\nindicate the automatist concerned. Whether its account of\nitself can be accepted at its face value depends on its cre-\ndentials, and these are mixed. That Myersp is not Frederic\nMyers as we knew him, with all his memories and associations\nof ideas and modes of expression intact, is clear from in-\nternal evidence, both by excess and defect. Some of the\nassociations of ideas and modes of expression (see Mrs. Verrall's\npaper, pp. 79, 80) are natural in Mrs. Piper but not in the\nsupposed communicator,^ and some of the confused and erro-\nneous statements would have Ijeen quite impossible to Frederic\nMyers in the full possession of his faculties. There is then\nunquestionably at least some degree of personation\u2014conscious\n\u2022or unconscious. On the other hand there is knowledge shown\nwhich, so far as can be ascertained, had never been in the\nmind either of Mrs. Piper, or of the sitter Mr. Dorr, or of\nother living persons with whom there is evidence of telepathic\ncommunication, but which was almost certainly possessed by\nFrederic Myers. The high-water mark of this kind of evidence\nis reached, so far as the present sittings are concerned, in the\n\" Lethe \" incident described by Mr. Piddington. And not only\nwas the knowledge shown in this case almost certainly pos-\nsessed by Frederic Myers, but the arrangement of it, fragmentary\nthough it be, fits in well with his associations and ways of\nlooking at things. This kind of evidence certainly points to\n^ There is one incident, outside the experiments, worth mentioning in this\n\u2022connexion. At the first sitting of the series (March 9th, 1908) Myersr made a\nspontaneous attempt, savouring very much of guesswork, to recall the occasions\nwhen Frederic Myers had met !Mr. Dorr. In the course of this attempt an\nallusion to Cambridge (where by the way Mr. Dorr had not visited Mr. Myers) is\nscarcely expressed as Frederic Myers would have expressed it. Myersp said \"I\nwish you could remember my showing you the students' liall and our walk\n<icross the little bridge over the river.\"\nC\n\f34 Mrs. Sidgwick, Mrs. Verrall, mid J. G. Piddington. [part\nthe intelligence of Frederic Myers being in some way or other\nbehind, or concerned with, Myersp.\nThe successful cross-correspondences described in Mrs. Sidg-\nwick's paper are interesting and important, but, as will be\nseen, they are not of a kind which adds weight to the claim\nthat a third intelligence has actively intervened, since, so\nfar as we can see, telepathy between the two automatists\nconcerned would sufficiently account for the facts.\nIt is important to observe that the two numbers of the\nS.P.E. Proceedings which deal with cross-correspondences were\nnot published till after the conclusion of these sittings with\nMrs. Piper. Part LV., Miss Johnson's report on Mrs. Holland's\nscript, appeared in June 1908, and Part LVII. (Vol. XXII.), Mr.\nPiddington's report on the experiments with Mrs. Piper, appeared\nin October 1908. Mr. Dorr had received a general account of\nthe line taken in the English experiments with Mrs. Piper, but\nhe had not seen the record of the sittings, and knew nothing\nin detail about the results.^ Neither Mrs. nor Miss Verrall\nknew anything about Mr. Dorr's sittings till long after their\nconclusion. It was only when Mrs. Verrall was shown the\nrecord of these sittings in October 1908, that she had any idea\nthat communications from MyerSp had been obtained or aimed\nat, after Mrs. Piper's return to America in the summer of\n1907.\nWe have for convenience given a list of the sittings with\ntheir dates, and references to quotations from them. This is\nintended to enable the reader to trace the chronological sequence\nof topics dealt with in the papers, should he wish to do so.\nThe amount of matter in these sittings unconnected with the\ntwo kinds of experiments with which these papers deal, is\napart from discussion with the controls about arrangements\nfor sittings, etc.\u2014very small And what there is, is for the\nmost pai't neutral and unevidential in character ^\n\u2014uninstructive\nto those who already know, as readers of the Proceedings-\nabundantly do, what a sitting with Mrs. Piper is like.\n^ For an account of communications on this subject with Mr. Dorr, see Mr.,\nPiddington's paper, note A, p. 136.\n- An exception to this has been referred to in a foot-note to the preceding;\npage.\n\fLX.] Further Experiments tvith Mrs. Piper in 1908. 35\nList of the sittings with Mrs. Piper ivith xohieh this Report deals,\ngiving the elates on which they were held, the headings\nunder which they are referred to, and the pages where they\narc ([noted.\n1908.\nMarch 9.

PIPEE'S TEANCE.\nBy Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nAs has been said in the Introduction, this paper deals with\nthe second of the two classes of experiments carried out by\nMr. Dorr, namely, the attempt to \"revive the literary memories\"\nof certain trance-personalities. His object was to obtain state-\nments showing classical or literary knowledge such as might\nbe possessed by the persons claiming to communicate, but not\nby the medium. The method employed was to ask questions\nor to submit small problems of translation from Latin, after\nhrst stimulating the interest of the trance-personalities in the\nsubjects introduced by conversation and by reading aloud\npassages from authors known to have been familiar to the\npersons supposed to be communicating. In the first instance,\na fortnight before these sittings began, Mr. Dorr had asked\nHodgsoup to translate \" veni vidi vici \" and \" arma virum-\nque cano,\" these two very familiar Latin phrases being-\nchosen for their familiarity. This Hodgsoup professed himself\nunable at the sitting to do ; but at the first sitting of this\nseries, March 9th, he asked to have the words repeated, and\nsaid that he had brought Myers to help in their translation.\nFrom this time it was with Myersp mainly that these experi-\nments were continued, and it was chiefiy the memories of\nFrederic Myers that the sitter attempted to revive, though\nHodgsonp was apparently present throughout and contributing\nto the result.\nThe experiment was novel and ingeniously devised. It was\nclearly worth trying to obtain from the trance-personalities\u2014\n\f40 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nwhatever they might be\u2014evidence of knowledge palpably not\nattainable by Mrs. Piper. On the assumption, suggested 1:\ny\nthe English experiments\/ that the trance-personalities had access\nto the memories of Frederic Myers, it was possible that\nevidence might also be obtained of knowledge not possessed\nby the sitter. In any case it was likely that in the course\nof this new type of experiment, fresh facts might be obtained\nbearing on the obscure problems of personality presented by\nthe trance-phenomena. That in all these three directions\nvaluable results were obtained, and that fresh material has\nbeen added for the examination of psychical researchers by\nthe ingenuity and labour of Mr. Dorr, it is the object of the\npresent paper to show.\nThat tlie results are not capable of exact classification\nor brief exposition is partly inherent in the nature of the\nphenomena, but is partly also due to defects in the method\nof experimentation, which further experience may remove\nor diminish. It is probalile that in any future attempt\nto revive the memories of a supposed communicator, fewer\nquestions will be asked and more scope will be given for\nspontaneous statements arising after reference hj the experi-\nmenter to topics once familiar. In this, the first set of\nexperiments, too many topics were presented at a time to the\ncontrol. A further element of complexity was introduced by\nthe simultaneous effort at experiment along another line\u2014the\nso-called cross-correspondences\u2014though it is to be noted that\nthe two often worked in together, and that a topic produced\nby the attempt at revival of memory was chosen by the\ncontrol as the subject of successful transmission.- It is certain\nthat on the mind of the reader the first effect of the great\nnumber of subjects introduced by the experimenter is bewildering\nin the extreme, and perhaps the control should not be credited\nwith more faculty for keeping them disentangled than is pos-\nsessed by the student of the record. Careful reading of the\nrecord shows meaning and connexion in statements at first\nsight unintelligible, and this suggests that, iinder conditions\nimproved by the experience of these sittings, clearer results\nmight 1)6 obtained.\niSee Proceedings S.P.K., Vol. XXII. pp. 108-172; 397-407.\n2 See Mrs. Sidgwick's paper, pp. 177, 182, 186.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper s Trance. 41\nThe method pursued by Mr. Dorr was as follows : During\nthe trance he suggested questions on literary or classical topics\nas subjects of messages to be transmitted, or asked what\nassociations they had for the control. He did not press for\nan immediate answer, and never misled the control or laid\ntraps. Throughout, his conduct was that of a friend trying\nto evoke memoiies dormant or forgotten, and he made this-\nintention abundantly clear to the trance-personalities. It was.\nhis habit, after the first six sittings of the series, at the\nbeginning of the trance to read over the utterances of the-\npreceding waking-stage^ and to invite comment by the respond-\ning hand on the disjointed sayings of the voice. This practice\narose first from references being made by the trance-personalities\nto statements uttered in the waking-stage of the previous\nsitting. Sometimes the hand explains the spoken words,\nsometimes corrects them, sometimes misinterprets them ; on\nsome occasions the hand disowns all recollection of the words,\nuttered by \" the spirit of tlie light as she returned.\" In the-\ncourse of the sittings the waking-stage tended to increase in\nlength and importance. The relations Ijetween the waking-stage-\nand the trance proper would in themselves furnish material\nfor a separate paper, and discussion of them must be deferred\ntill the reader has some acqiiaintance with the actual results\nachieved, whether by hand or voice.\nIt is difficult within the limits of this paper to deal with\nthe mass of detail presented in the record of the 21 sittings\nbetween March 9th and May 26th, 1908. ISTor is it possible\nto summarise the results, or to classify them as good, bad, or\nindifferent. The important point to discover in the case of\neach item of knowledge shown by the responding intelligence\nis not whether the information given is correct or incorrect,\nbut of what type it is. A partially incorrect answer to a\nparticular question may somethnes give indications of under-\nlying intelligence, whereas a verbally accurate statement ma}'\n^\nThe waking-stage is the name given, as readers of Vol. XXII. will remember\n(p. 29), to the intermediate stage when Mrs. Piper is passing out of trance\ninto a normal condition. During this period there is no writing, but phrases\nmore or less disjointed are spoken. The phrases are of three types: some\nclaim to be the verbatim repetitions of utterances by the \"spirits\", others to\nbe Mrs. Piper's paraphrases of those utterances, and the rest to be Mrs.,\nPiper's remarks in propria persona.\n\f42 Mrs. A. W. VerraU. [part\nsometimes be due to an accidental acquaintance with the\ncontents of a book of reference, or even to chance. It has\ntherefore seemed best to select some typical cases for presen-\ntation, and to leave the reader to form his own judgement.\nBefore attributing the statements to a third unknown\nintelligence, it is necessary to eliminate two known intelli-\ngences, the minds of medium and sitter. The knowledge\ndemanded is for the most part beyond the medium's range,\nand it is comparatively easy to exclude her agency. Account\nmust of course be taken of any information acquired either\ndirectly or inferentially from Mr. Dorr's questions or remarks,\nall of which, I need not say, are included in the record. It is\nmore difficult to exclude the mind of the sitter as a contribu-\ntory cause. 'No student of the now voluminous records can\nfail to recognize that there have been instances of direct\nthought-transference from the sitter,^ and we must also allow\nfor changes of tone and other involuntary indications.\"' In\njudging of the sitter's knowledge, we have to reckon with the\nsubliminal, as well as the supraliminal memory, and therefore\nwe must suppose that a good deal of the classical information\nshown by the control may have been at one time accessible\nto Mr. Dorr and stored in his subliminal memory.^ Even in\n^See, for instance, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXII. p. 436.\n- Some such cases are noted by Mr. Dorr. On the general question of\nthought-transference from the sitter, Mr. Dorr, in a letter written on\nNovember 16th, 1909, sums up as follows the impression derived from a long\nexperience of sittings with Mrs. Piper: \"My experience with the Piper\ntrance does not lead me to believe that the trance-consciousness\u2014whatev^er it\nmay be\u2014is able to tap my mind for facts or thought, except what I express\nin some way to the normal sense perceptions, by word or tone or movement.\nI have fairly strong grounds for thinking that it . . . rarely if ever gets\nsubliminal impressions from my mind. . . . With other sitters I have seen\ninstances of what I call its clairvoyant faculty shown remarkably now and\nthen . . . but this does not seem to me so much reading the sitters' minds\nas seeing things in some way associated with them\u2014as though it had a\nfaculty of seeing their environment, as it were.''\n^In answer to an enquiry from me, Mr. Dorr sends me the following note\nas to his classical reading: \"I dropped Latin and Greek at eighteen, at the\nend of my second year at Harvard ; I have never read Greek since, and\nscarcely any Latin\u2014none for a long time. Virgil I read the first three or\nfour books of at school\u2014I mean of the Aeneid\u2014and none since ; no Ovid, and\nvery little Horace. My Greek reading was still more limited than my Latin,\nand I have forgotten my Greek, alas, quite thoroughly . . . Translations of\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary A Ihisions in Mrs. Piper s Trance. 43\nthe case of tlie medium, we must allow for a similar extension\nof knowledge, especially if an interval elapses between the\nquestion and the answer. I am not suggesting the interven-\ntion of \" the useful book that knows.\" But it is not safe to\nassume that no trace of what has been said to the trance-\npersonalities reaches Mrs. Piper's normal mind,'- and a vague\nrecollection might suffice to draw her attention to a particular\nsuliject, and so focus her recollections or increase her informa-\ntion before the next sitting. The longer the interval between\nthe first question and the final answer, the more chance there\nis of hints being; obtained from Mr. Dorr's manner as to\nwhether the statements correspond with his expectations. On\nthe other hand, it will be seen in some cases that the\nresponding intelligence was misled by the sitter's misunder-\nstanding or ignorance. Hence the importance of response at\nthe same sitting in which the question is put. This does\nnot usually occur. The general object lieing what I have\ndescribed, the experimenter's main desire, as he pointed out,\nwas for satisfactory and complete rather than for immediate\nreplies, though he recognised the value and importance of\nthese. But in some cases, at least part of the answer was\nproduced in the course of the sitting or in the waking-stage.\nIndeed on one occasion, which I proceed to describe, the\nresponse was complete and immediate.\nCase I. Shelley.\nOn April 22nd Mr. Dorr read ten lines from Shelley's\ntranslation of the C'l\/clojys of Euripides, selected from a book\nwhich he had brought with him to the sitting, namely Mr.\nA. W. Pollard's collection of translations, called Odes from\nthe Greek Dramatists.\nMr. Dorr brought the books that he used with hiui to\nthe sittings in a hand-bag, and only took them out after\nthe Classics I have hardly read at all. I have been in Greece, once and too\nbriefly ; in Italy, in earlier years, a good deal.\" See also Xote A of Mr.\nPiddington's paper below, pp. 141-2.\n^ This is specially likely to be the case in the waking-stage, where the\nmedium is passing into a normal condition and may perceive and remember\nindications of approval or dissatisfaction.\n\f44 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nMrs. Piper had gone into trauce. During the trance Mrs. Piper's\nliead is turned away from the hand which writes, and there-\nfore also from the sitter who is placed on her riglit, and her\neyes are closed. Mr. Dorr however took care, even though\nher eyes seemed closed, to turn away from her the page, if\nopen, or the back with the title upon it, of any book used\nduring the sitting. Mr. Pollard's Odes he obtained from the\nAthenaeuin Library at Boston, an old Club Library to which\nMrs. Piper had no access. The book is not one which she\ncould have readily found in the places open to her, nor would\nshe be likely to have ever come upon it in her reading.\nIt has no associations with Mr. Myers, and would not there-\nfore on that around have attracted the attention of Mrs.\nPiper had she accidentally come across it. It is, however,\nwithin my personal knowledge that the book was known to\nMr. Myers ; I remember his talking with me of the book and\nof its editor about the time of its production in 1890.\nExtract from Sitting of April 22nd, 1908.\n(Myersp communicating.)\nG.

Tnless Mrs.\nPiper knew and recognized Shelley's translation, in which, as\nwill have been noticed, no name occurs distinctive of its\norigin, the infoi'mation came from the sitter's mind or from a\nthird intelligence. It is interesting to note that even here,\nwhere the knowledge shown is unmistakably correct, no attempt\nis made to give the name of the writer, Shelley. He is\ndescribed by naming another of his poems. Many parallel\ncases suggest that special difficulty is found in giving proper\nnames.-\"-\nCase II. Comus.\nThe next illustration also deals with English literature. ]\\Ir.\nDorr had found in general talk that ]\\Irs. Piper knew nothing\nof Milton's but Paradise Lost, and he had for some time\nintended to read from Comus. The opportunity occurred on\nApril 27th, 1908, when immediately before the conclusion of the\ntrance proper, he read a few lines from the opening of Comus\nwithout saying anything as to whence the lines were taken,\nor who was the author. Shortly afterwards, just before the\nconclusion of the waking- stage, these words were spoken as\nfrom MyerSp :\n\" I had it in my mind that you were going\nto read me about Comus. See those pretty little children.\"\nIt is clear that Myersp recognized the passage read. It is\nmoreover evident that the succeeding words \" pretty little\nchildren \" are not inappropriate in recalling the circumstances\nof the production of Covins, which was written for perform-\nance by the young children of Lord Bridgewater.\nThe appropriateness of this allusion was not recognized liy Mr.\nDorr, nor apparently by the trance-personality communicating on\nMay 4th. On that day when Mr. Dorr read over to jMyersp the\nutterances of the preceding waking-stage, after the mention of\n\" Comus,\" MyerSp wrote :\n\" Milton.\" Then Mr. Dorr said,\n'\u2022'\nAt\nthe end she said '\nSee those pretty little children.' \" To which\nMyerSp replied, \" I was thinking of my own dear ones.\" -\niSee below, pp. 48, &1, 68.\n- Mr. Myers's o-\\vn children -were three in number, a sister and two brothers,\nlike the Egerton children. Earlier in the waking-stage, before the allusion to\nCormis, the names of Mr. Myers's three children had been spoken by Mrs. Piper.\n\f46 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nIf I am right in thinking that the original combination of\nComus and children is due to a recollection of the circum-\nstances which produced Milton's poem, this affords an\nillustration of what I have above described as misinterpretation\nl)y the hand of what was spoken in the waking-stage.-^\nFurther slight indications were given of knowledge of\nMilton's Comus\u2014e.g.\n\" tempted her with wine \" emerged on\nMay 4th\u2014but the most interesting point in the allusions to\nComus is of a different kind, namely, its connexion by Myersp\nwith Mrs. Sidgwick's name. This is described in Mrs. Sidg-\nwick's paper (p. 197).\nCase III. Agamemnon.\nMy third illustration is from classical literature. I give the\nwhole incident in detail, as it is short, and moreover illus-\ntrates several characteristics of these sittings. On March\n31st Mr. Dorr announced to MyerSp that he would read to\nhim something written by Mr. Ernest Myers. He then read\na translation of the invocation to Zeus from the Agamemnon\nof Aeschylus, IL 160-183. The translation is published in\nMr. Pollard's Odes, and it was from this book that Mr. Dorr\nread.

Myers's answer that\n'\nErnest wrote about it ' was in reply, I think, to a poem\nyou read about Zeus.\nG. B. D. The word Jove did follow it, but I could catch nothing\nmore.\nBefore commenting in detail on these extracts, it will be\ndesirable to form an opinion as to the associations which the\npassage read by Mr. Dorr would have for a classical scholar.\nI take it that the thought of such a scholar would be :\n\" The\ntranslation is from the invocation to Zeus in the great Chorus\n\u2014the -TTuOei fxdOo? Chorus\u2014of the Agaviemncm\" and, for the\nbenefit of an enquirer not familiar with Greek, he might\nadd that the Agamemnon was written by Aeschylus, and was\nthe first of a Trilogy, or group of three connected plays,\nof which this Aeschylean Trilogy is the only extant specimen.\nWhat does MyerSp say ? A minute or two after the ques-\ntion has been put, the first word audibly spoken in the waking-\nstage by Mrs. Piper -is the name Agamemnon. A week\nlater, during the review of the utterances in the waking-stage,\nMyerSp tries to give the name of an author of whom he was\nreminded by something read to him by the sitter. This\nauthor is described as one who wrote three plays ; the name\nresembles Achilles, but begins AE. Further attempts to give\nthis name end in its successful production in the waking-stage\nof April 14 after, though not immediately after, the words\n\" Agamemnon king.\"\nThese points are clear and unmistakable. There are others\nless clear, but interesting and suggestive. Thus in the remarks\nquoted as from Hodgsoup in the waking-stage of March 31st,\nI am disposed to see allusions to iraQei \/ulu6o9, and to the\nChoral Ode read from Pollard's Odes, in the words :\n\" Troubles\nand trials, and the better you go through them the better\nyour [life] here\u2014He said he'd sing of the Odes for you.\"\nThat this is the intention of the p)hrase, \" Sing of the Odes,\"\nis probable from the fact that the mention of this phrase on\nApril 6th at once leads MyerSp to think of Aeschylus. The\napplication of \" troubles and trials,\" etc., to the -TrdOei juaOo?,\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary A llusions in Mrs. Pij^er's Trance. 51\n\" wisdom acquired by suffering,\" is not certain. There is no\ndoubt that the words are explained by the control on April\n6th, and were probably understood at their utterance by the\n\" spirit of the light,\" as advice to Mrs. Pip)er.^ If my view\nis correct, and the original remark was meant as an allusion to\nthe Choral Ode, we have here another instance of a failure\non the part of the writing hand to understand the full meaning\nof the spoken words.-\nAs showing the persistence in the trance of an association\nof ideas that has once occurred, we may note a statement on\nApril 14th. On April 6th Mr. Dorr had passed from the\nmention of \" three plays \" to questions about two plays of\nAristophanes (not mentioning the author's name), the Clouds\nand Birds. This association persisted with the control, for on\nApril 14th a reference to the play of the Birds is im-\nmediately followed by the words \" Agamennion king,\" and in\nthe waking-stage of the same day an allusion to \" Crane \" is\ninterpolated between the successful attempt at \" Aeschylus\nand the statement that the translation was by Ernest Myers.\nThat the connexion between the Birds and the Agaviemnon\nwas not intended is the view of Myersp on April 21st. He\ndefinitely dissociates the \" Crane etc.\" from the following\nwords. Here, then, the communicator appears to have a\nclear grasp of the situation and to be able to disentangle the\ndisjointed sayings of the waking-stage, without, however,\nattempting to account for them.\nOn April 13th, the answer to his question not being then\ncomplete, Mr. Dorr read over again the translation, without\nnaming the translator. His intention was \" to see whether\nthe recollection of the lines themselves, whether as read\npreviously or from former memory, was clear enough to\nidentify them as their author's.\" The result was the im-\nmediate production in the waking-stage of the answer to this\nquestion. Similarly, a fortnight earlier, the answer to the\nfirst question had been produced in the first utterances of the\nwaking-stage. The cases differ essentially in evidential value,\nthe required answers being normally known in the one case\n^For similar instances of personal application combined with veridical state-\nments, see below, p. 81.\n^See above, p. 46.\n\f52 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nand not in the other. But both cases iUustrate the close\nC(jnnexion between trance proper and waking-stage, and show a\ndesire to reply at the earliest possible moment to tire question\nput by the experimenter.\nTo enable the reader to judge at a glance how far the\nanswer of MyerSp corresponds with that of my supposed\nclassical scholar, I place the statements in parallel columns,\nprinting in brackets words representing what had been already\nmentioned by the experimenter, or could be inferred from the\npassage read\nClassical scholar Myersp.\nTranslation from [Ernest translated it] Apr. 13.\nInvocation to Zeus in 0 [Zeus] Apr. 13.\nGreat Chorus\u2014 He'd sing of the Odes.

Either Mrs. Piper knew and recog-\nnized the passage, or the explanation must be sought in the\nknowledge of the sitter, or in a third intelligence, or in a\ncombination of these two. The reader must judge which\nhypothesis is probable. My own view, as has been seen, is\nthat something more than thought-transference from the sitter\nis required to account for the facts.\nIt is time to turn to the failures. There are very few\ninstances of persistent error as distinct from confusion\u2014of\ncases, that is, wliere the only correct statements ai'e such\nas could have been derived from the medium's knowledge,\nor inferred from indications given by the sitter. The following\nare the only cases I have found\nCase IV. Ajax and Ulysses.\nIn the waking-stage of March 24th these words were\nspoken :\n\" I am the power that they say of Ajax. I\ndo not know what it means at all.\" On March 30th, in\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Pipei's Trance. 53\nrepeating these words, Mr. Dorr added :\n\" Who was Ajax, can\nyou tell me ?\n\" To this he received from the controls,\nHodgsonp and Myersp, who were both apparently concerned,\nthe reply :\n\" Greek god, yes, I understand ; old Ajax. I said\nto the spirit [i.e. to Mrs. Piper] I am not going to release\nyou until you repeat all for me. I will hold you, I will\nhold you in my power, the power of Ajax.\"\nThese words appear to be sheer nonsense. Ajax was not\na Greek god, neither was he old, nor had he any special\npower. Nor is anything contributed by the reference to the\nsubject in the waking-stage of the next sitting, March 31st:\n\" Ajax\u2014Ulysses\u2014took them in a boat and then went across ;\nhe would not be outdone.\" It is true that there is in\nHomer a close association between Ajax and Ulysses, but\nthere is no association with a boat. The first emergence of\n\" Ulysses \" and the \" boat \" was earlier in the same sitting,\nwhen in answer to a question about the Greeks and Persians\nthe control wrote :\n\" Didn't Ulysses take them in a boat\nacross ?\n\" The ignorance about Ulysses seemed as great as\nabout Ajax, and is the more remarkable in that on March\n17th, during a talk about Acnnd I., Ulysses was quite correctly\nassociated with the Wooden Horse.\nOn xipril 6 th Mr. Dorr, reviewing the words of the waking-\nstage, asked whether the control had any association in his\nmind between Ajax and Ulysses. But, in spite of this lead,\nthe only reply was :\n\" Power,\" and in the waking-stage of the\nnext day, April 7th, Ajax and Ulysses were definitely\nseparated. The remarks about both only add to the mistakes:\n\" Ajax's power, the power of Thor, Tor he pronounces it,\" and\nagain :\n\" They say Minerva was angry with Ulysses and he\nnever recovered\u2014so he died. So the story goes, and he\nknows the story.\" The story is not known to me. No\nlight was thrown by the review of the waking-stage on April\n13th, either on Ajax or Ulysses, nor by the statement in the\nwaking-stage of April 14th, \" Ulysses was so grieved that he\ndied.\" Mr. Dorr renewed the attempt to obtain further\ninformation about Ajax at the sitting of April 21st, l^ut\nnothing further was said by the controls.\nAs has been said, the above statements seem entirely\nwithout meaning, and I only hesitate to describe them as\n\/\n\f54 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nsheer nonsense in view of the fact that in some other cases,\nnotably in the gronp of allusions to Lethe, described by Mr.\nPiddington, the possession of a clue has enabled the student\nto see sense in what at first reading seems mere disjointed\ndrivel.-^\nCase V.

The other two \"gods\" were Poseidon and Athena (Herod. VIII. 64\nand 121). The connexion of Ajax with the island Salamis, familiar to readers\nof Herodotus and Sophocles, may lie behind these confused references.\n^ For the benefit of readers unfamiliar with these monsters, I may say that\nby means of the Winged Horse, sprung from the blood of the snaky-tressed\nGorgon Medusa, Bellerophon slew the winged Chimaera, compounded of horse,\ndragon, and goat.

Centaurs. Sphinxes . . . woman's\nhead and a lion's body\n;\n\" and when the subject came up on\nApril 14th in reviewing the preceding waking-stage, Mr. Dorr\ndrew attention to the confusion, and asked Myersp to recall\nthe Centaurs clearly, if he could. The attempt to do this\nseems to have produced a confusion between Centaurs and\nCyclops, for after drawing an object described as a Centaur\non April 22nd, the hand reached out and touched the sitter\non both eyes, and then upon the centre of the forehead,\nwhere it pressed heavily. This suggested to Mr. Dorr a\ncreature with a single eye in the centre of his forehead, and\nthe hand assented to this ^dew. Later in the sitting, when\nMr. Dorr proposed Cyclops as a message for transmission, the\nhand drew again the figure which it had described earlier as\na Centaur, and the confusion still persisted in the waking-\nstage, as is shown by the words :\n\" Cyclops \u2014 \u2014\u2022\n\u2014 head,\nsn'akes . . .

In the waking-stage the first words caught are\n\" Had a wicked face,\" which the comment on May 4 applies\nto Medusa. Later in the waking-stage of April 27th, a protest\nagainst the supposed confusion is made in the words :\n\" Don't\nyou think I know the difference between Cyclops and Centaur?\"\nand on May 4th, when these words are read to Myersp, he\nclearly distinguishes between them in the words :\n\" One eye.\nHalf-horse and man.\" Henceforth the distinction is maintained.\nBut it will be noted that by this time much help had probably\nbeen derived from the indications given by the experimenter.\n\f56 Mrs. A.

But he asked for\nthe meaning of the word Parthenon or its significance. The\nword represents two Greek words : the accusative case of\nParthenos, \" a virgin,\" and the nominative case of Parthenon,\nwhich means \" maidens' apartment,\" and is usually employed\nin that sense in the plural. In the singular it is used of the\nMaiden's chamber, namely, the Temple of Athena Parthenos at\nAthens.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper s Trance. 59\nThe attempt to give the meaning of the word Parthenon\nproduces again the unintelligible \" Venus chamber,\" which,\nhowever, does not satisfy the control, who corrects it to\n\" Inhab\u2014bride,\" words which seem to approximate to the ideas\nsuggested by Parthenon. The parallel straight lines and the\nword \" walk \" remain unexplained, and the control recognizes\nhis own confusion.\nOn March 31st further reference to Pallas Athene produces\nfrom the control the word \" virgin,\" which he definitely states\nis \" an answer to \" Mr. Dorr's question about the meaning of\nParthenon. This answer satisfies the experimenter, his intention\nhaving been not to obtain a specific translation of the word\ninto English, but to find out whether the control understood\nthat the name was due to the fact that Athena was the\nvirgin goddess. But the control utters in the waking-stage of\nthe same day the words \" Parthenon virgin's chamber,\" which\ngive the second meaning of the Greek word, and thus complete\nthe answer to Mr. Dorr's question. It is noticeable that this\ncompletion is produced after the sitter has accepted, as\n\" exactly what \" he \" wanted to get,\" the fii'st answer \" virgin.\"\nI am disposed to see in the original \" Venus chamber \" an\nattempt at the \" virgin chamber \" ultimately given, and the\ninterest of this case lies partly in the fact that the informa-\ntion given exceeds that consciously demanded by the sitter.\nThe later references on April 6 th and 7th appear to me\nto show the influence of Mrs. Piper's own knowledge. Poe's\npoem of the Raven is a familiar one, and the combination of\na virgin's chamber and a statue of Athena produces a\nrecollection of \" the pallid bust of Pallas \" above the \" chamber\ndoor.\" This recollection leads to other memories of Poe, for, as\nMr. Dorr points out, it is probable that the words \" my eyes\nmy beautiful \" on April 7th are reminiscences of Annabel Zee.\n\" And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes\nOf my beautiful Annabel Lee.\"\nCase VII.

It cannot, however, be omitted, for it\nis crucial. The first words, anna virumque ccmo, from the\nfirst book of the Aeneid were given by the sitter as a test\nfor translation by the control two weeks before these sittings\nbegan. This poem, therefore, formed the first subject of his\nattempt to revive the memories of the control and to elicit\ninformation. It was a good choice. A personality claiming\nto have access to the memories of Frederic Myers ought to be\nable to show a knowledge of this poem not only beyond\nanything attainable by the medium, but considerably exceeding\nthe knowledge of the sitter. This I believe to have been the\ncase. Amid much error and confusion we get indications,\nas I tliink, that the increasing knowledge shown is due to the\nrevival of once familiar memories, and not to the acquisition\nof information, or to the development of suggestion from the\nsitter. The only question is whether the knowledge indicated\nis distinctive enough to be attributed to a particular source.\nTo save time and space, I condense the record where I can,^\nand to make the position as clear as possible, I quote and\ntranslate the opening lines of tlie poem.\nArma virumque cano, Troiae qui prinnis ab oris\nItalian! , fato profugus, Lavinaque venit\nLitora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto\nVi superum, saevae memorem Junonis ob iram,\nMalta quoque et hello passus, dum conderet urbem,\nInferretque deos Latio, genus unde Latinum\nAlbanique patres, atque altae moenia Eomae.\nMusa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso,\nQuidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus\nInsignem pietate viruni, tot adire labores\nImpulerit.

On March 9th, at the\nfirst, namely, of this series of sittings, Hodgsonp announced that\nhe had brought Myersp to help, and asked to have the words\nrepeated.-^ The first attempt to translate this phrase goes beyond\nthe actual words given, though probably hardly beyond the\nknowledge of most educated persons.

Thus, though we have only an actual trans-\nlation of the words viricm . . . cano . . . qui . . . fato profugus,\nknowledge is shown such as would be derived from the context\nof the next three lines {anna, Troiac, Italiam, vcnit litora,\nJunonis).

But in answer to Mr. Dorr's question as\nto what Juno did with regard to Troy and the exile, we have\na series of incorrect statements showing clearly that the part\nplayed by Juno in the story of Aeneas is completely misap-\nprehended. The exile, called Teusis (?) or Torius, wandered\nand thought he was lost, but was redeemed and saved by\nJuno. Again, the control speaks of Juno's love for the exile\nand v olunteers \" the incident of Juno and her saving Torius\nas a proof of memory. The placing together of the words,\n\" Exile,\" and \" Saved by Juno \" as successive messages to be\nused for transmission may have enq^hasized the original mis-\nconception. But in spite of Mr. Dorr's recognition of the\nmistake about Juno's action, and even after the trance-\npersonality had remembered or guessed that Juno was the\nowner of the \"injured form\" (1. 27) asked about by the sitter,\nthe mistake still persists.

This follows immediately\nupon the repetition by Mr. Dorr of five phrases chosen for\ntransmission as messages for cross-correspondence, thiis\nG. B. D.

I. 125). It is\ntherefore appropriate that the name Neptune should be at\nonce introduced among reminiscences of the first Aeneid. The\nname is repeated with emphasis by MyerSp when the cross-\ncorrespondence messages are again enumerated, and later in\nanswer to a suggestion from the sitter not to \" try to connect\nthings together unless they come to yon so,\" Myersp replies\n\" Like Nejjtuner\nNo definite reminiscences can be traced in the later remarks\nat this sitting about \" her love of the exile and she restores\nhim,\" and \" built, she built a,\u2014she goes up with her love the\nexile.\" But in view of what follows in subsequent sittings\nI think it possible that we have here a first emergence of Dido\nand her part in the poem.\nAt the risk of seeming fanciful I hazard conjectures to\naccount for the incorrect or unexplained statements above\ndescribed. At the first reading neither Torius nor Teusis\n^ Of these five phrases, face in flame was suggested by Mr. Dorr before these\nsittings began ;\nTroy and exile were spontaneously suggested by Myersp on March\n9th, city inflames and saved hy Juno were added at the sitter's suggestion.\n\f64 Mrs. A.

[part\nconveyed any meaning to me, but Mr. Piddington suggested that\nthe word which appears as Torius or Tarius ^\nmay be intended\nfor Troius, the inversion of two letters l^eing not uncommon\nin Piper script. Aeneas is called Troius in the first book\n(I. 596). The followers of Aeneas are called throughout the\npoem indifferently Trojans, Teucrians, and Dardanians, from the\nnames of three heroes of the race, Tros, Teucer, Dardanus.\nIf Torius recalls Troius, perhaps Teusis is aimed at Teucer.\nAgain, the mistake about Juno is perhaps explicable if we\nsuppose a confusion between two passages very familiar to\nclassical readers, in the first Acncid and the fifth book\nof the Odyssey!^ In both the hero, after much wandering,\nis lost in a god-sent storm and saved by the interposition of\na god. In Odyssey V. Odysseus is saved by Ino from the\nstorm sent by Poseidon (Neptune). In Aeneid I. it is by\nNeptune that Aeneas is saved from the storm roused by\nJuno's wratli. Possibly the similarity of the names Ino\nand Juno may have aided the confusion. That there was\nconfusion in the trance between Homer and Virgil is clear,\nfor though the name of the poem is said to be Acncid, a\nrepeated request for the name of the poet produces in the\nword \" blind \" an unmistakable allusion to the writer, not\nof the Aeneid, but of the Odyssey.^\nOn March 10th Mr. Dorr read from Fragments of Prose\nand Foetry (p. 6) the eighth line of Acncid I. and the pre-\nceding and following paragraphs as follows\nOn my sixth birthday my father began to teach me Latin ; and a\nfew months later he gave me the First Aeneid of Virgil with an\ninterlinear translation.

So too is the introduction on March\n10th of the trident. The trident is, no doubt, naturally asso-\nciated with Neptune, but it is particularly appropriate in\nconnexion with the early part of the first Aeneid, as it is by\nthe power of the trident^ that Neptune claims the right to\ncalm the seas (Aen. I. 138).\n(d) Again it is appropriate that an attempt to recall the\nAeneid should produce an allusion to Aeneas' father, especially\nto any one just reminded by the passage read from Fragments\nof the pietcis which made Aeneas insignem virum.'^ Here as\nelsewhere there is difficulty about giving the name, Anchises.\n^If the \"she \" who got Dido to listen is referred to its preceding grammatical\nsubject, Juno, this statement is incorrect. But I believe that the words \"she\ngot Dido to listen \" constitute a new point and do not refer to what has preceded.\nThe point is clearer in the waking-stage of March ]6th.\n2 Great confusion was caused in my opinion by the failure of the sitter to\nunderstand the object of the control. See below, p. 70.\n\u2022Tor successful cross-correspondences on Neptune and his trident see Mrs.\nSidgwick's paper, p. 177.\n^ The passage contains no allusion to Aeneas' father.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper's Trance. 69\nThe words \" very odd and rather long \" seem to come from\nEector rather than fx'om Myersp.^ Some approach to the name\nis made on March 16 th\"' when, after Mr. Dorr has asked, in\nquite another connexion, if the control can tell him who\nCharo7i was and what he did, Myersp replies, \" I remember\nfather, if I understand the name.\" The sitter evidently saw no\npoint in this remark and replied, \" No, you have not got it\nyet.\" But MyerSp persisted :\n\" Oh I am thinking of Aeneas'\nfather,\" and then produced an illegible word terminating with\nthe right sound, '\nseas'\nReaders familiar with the Acneid will see at once why the\nname of Charon should recall the father of Aeneas. For it is\non his visit to his father in Hades that Aeneas uses the\nservices of Charon. The visit to Hades, described in the\nsixth Aeneid, is the centre of the wliole poem. In the waking-\nstage of March 30th, the first word uttered is \" Anchises,\"\nand when this is read to the control on April 6 th the\ndescription, \" Aeneas' father,\" is added. In the waking-stage\nof March 31st the name emerges again, immediately after the\nname Icarus,^ and the last mention of the name is on April\n13th, when in the waking-stage the words \"Anchises'\nfuneral \" were spoken just before allusions to disciis throwing.\nAs the reader will remember, the funeral games of Anchises\nform the subject of the fifth Aeneid. The group of allusions\ntherefore to the father of Aeneas is appropriate throughout.\n(e) From the father of Aeneas, MyerSp passes to the wrath\nof Juno, whom he describes as powerful and not to be\nangered,\u2014a phrase possibly reminiscent of saevae memo7'em\nJunonis oh iram, \" on account of the unfoi'getting wrath of\nstern Juno \" (Aen. I. 4), though sufficient had been said on\nthis subject on March 9th to justify a guess that Juno was\npowerful and angered. Something, however, beyond a guess\nappears, I think, in the subsequent statements. After the\nmention of the walls of Eome and Africa, MyerSp adds that\n1 See Mr. Piddington's paper, p. 145.\n^ For record of such of the statements on March 16th as concern the topics\n(d) and (e), see below, p. 71, where it has been placed in order not to interrupt\nthe narrative.\n5 See Mr. Piddington's paper, p. 148, for an explanation of the association of\nthese two names.\n\f70 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nJuno did not wish to be overpowered. This at once recalled\nto my mind Juno's speech (Acn. I. 37-49) and the reference\n(Aen. I. 15, 16) to Juno's special love for Carthage. One of\nthe motives of Juno's action, as represented by Virgil, was\nher desire to prevent the founding of Eome, the city destined\none day to destroy her own Carthage. Thus Conington's\nanalysis of Aeneicl I. 8-22 runs as follows:\n\u2014\"Why was it.\nMuse, that Juno so persecuted so pious a hero ? Juno was\npatroness of Carthage, which she had heard was destined one\nday to be crushed by a nation of Trojan descent.\"\nThis obscurely-worded allusion by the control on March\n10th, only intelligible to some one very familiar with the\npoem, was not observed by Mr. Dorr. Not seeing that the\nwords above quoted constituted an approach to the answer to\nhis question, and expecting an allusion to the judgement of\nParis, he asked again what was the cause of Juno's anger.\nAfter the irrelevant remark \" she got Dido to listen,\" the\nrepeated question produced the old mistake about Juno's\naction, modified, as Mr. Dorr noted, by some indication that\nit failed to satisfy him. But in the course of this modifica-\ntion, IMyerSp returned to the earlier point and repeated that\nJuno did not \" wish a better city than her own\u2014Africa\nAfrica.\"\nThe next few answers repeat the confusion and error, a\nconfusion not perhaps surprising, seeing that the sitter and\ncontrol were not thinking of the same point. But the control\nto the end maintains the view that what led the gods to take\npart was that \" Juno was in power and did not wish a finer\n\u2022\ncity.\"\nOn March 16th ^ this ]Doint is again suggested. MyerSp\nasked for a repetition of the question which, in its original\nform, ran :\n\" What was the cause of Juno's anger ?\n\" (March\n10). Mr. Dorr repeated it in the form, \"What was the cause\nwhich led Juno to take part against Troy ?\n\" Obviously the\ncorrect answer to this would have referred to the \"judgement\nof Paris.\" It is equally obvious that the sitter was not\naware that he had modified his question. But MyerSp\ncarefully distinguishes, and repeats the question in the earlier\nand more general form, to which the answer required from a\n^ See note on p. 72.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper's Trance. 7\nstudent of the Aencid would be :\n\" Juno's partiality for\nCarthage\n;\n\" Myersp says :\n\" What caused Juno's wrath ?\nBecause she did not wish Aeneas to conquer her, l^ecause she\nthought it mioiit\n\"\no o\nHere the sitter suggested that MyerSp was thinking, not of\nTroy, but of Eome, exactly what a student of the Aeneicl in\nparticular\u2014as distinguished from the general cycle of legends\nwould have done. Mr. Dorr then introduced the subject of\nthe judgement of Paris, telling the control not to confuse the\nold story in Homer with the story of Aeneas. To this the not\nunnaturally bewildered control replies :\n\" I remember, let me\nthink it over, don't tell me. I remember it caused wrath\nbecause of jealousy. She was jealous of\u2014because\u2014because it\nshe was not selected.\" In these remarks the sitter found the\nunmistakable allusion to the judgement of Paris which he\nwanted, and the subject was not revived. But I tlo not\nthink that it can be doubted liy a reader thoroughly familiar\nwith the Aeneid that the first attempts of the control to\nexplain the cause of Juno's wrath dealt not with her jealousy\nof Venus, but with her partiality for Carthage ; in other\nwords, with the cause of her enmity not against Troy, but\nagainst Eome.\nI append the record of such parts of the sitting of March\n16 th as are required to follow this comment.\nExtract from Sitting of March IQth, 1908.\n(MyerSp communicating.)\nG.

It is vague but I can recall it I think\nand give some of the words to Mrs. V.\nOn the same day, March 16th, 1908, an attempt was made\nby MyerSp to translate the line {Aen. I. 8), quoted on March\n10th from Fragments of Prose and Poetry. The literal translation\nruns: \"Muse, tell me the causes, for godhead how offended . .\n.\"\nThe translation given by Myersp runs thus :\n\" Oh Muse, oh what\ncause\u2014affront\u2014cause cause, with what affront. It is in\nmy mind. Oh Muse with cause\u2014cause for what affront\u2014\ncan't get it exactly.\" The word numcn (godhead) is not\ntranslated, and does not seem to have been understood even\nafter repetition. The general meaning of the line is unmis-\ntakably indicated, and here as in the earlier translation the-\nphraseology is, as far as I know, original ; the word \" affront\ndoes not occur in any translation or edition that I have\nconsulted.\nOn March 17 th Mr. Dorr read to MyerSp Dryden's trans-\nlation of the opening lines of the first Aeneid, and this,\nproduced several reminiscences of the poem. By this time\nenough had been said at previous sittings to show plainly\nwhat was wanted, and therefore references to obvious topics\n\f74 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nill the poem are of little evidential value. But some of the\nreferences are not obvious. Thus, after the first four lines\nhave been read\/ MyerSp notes three points as follows :\n\" Fleet\nbehind on island,\u2014soldiers in Horse. Arrow in heel,\" the\nfirst two points being plainly connected.\" Mr. Dorr numbers\nthese points as three, and notes that the second was in\nanswer to a question asked previously as to what connexion\nthere was between the AVooden Horse and Troy. The third\nwas introduced spontaneously, nothing having been said pre-\nviously to bring it out. It alludes to the death of Achilles,\na story familiar to inany persons who have no first-hand\nclassical knowledge.\nThe interesting point is No. 1, \"fleet behind on [o?- an]\nisland.\" This at once recalled to me a passage (Aen. II. 21),\ndescribing the stratagem by which the Trojans were led to\nbelieve that the Greeks had sailed away. The Greek fleet\nwas concealed behind the island of Tenedos, and the Wooden\nHorse contained the only Greeks who were left behind on\nthe mainland. The words, est in conspedu Tenedos, notissima\nfama insula, begin one of the most famous passages in the\nAcneid, and follow immediately upon the description of the\nWooden Horse. The conjunction therefore of the words \" fleet\nbehind an island \" and \" soldiers in Horse \" is appropriate, and\nplainly indicates, to my mind, a knowledge of the story\nof the second Aeneid.\nIt is interesting to note that the allusion to Tenedos was\nnot at the time perceived by the sitter. This point is made\nclear by Mr. Dorr's contemporary notes. Commenting on the\n^The first four lines of Dryden's translation follow closely the four lines of\nthe original.\n-I have here strictly followed the typewritten record of the sitting, where\nthe word \"soldiers'' has a small and the first full-stop is after the word\n\"Horse.\" I have little doubt that the third word in the first phrase should\nbe not \"on\" but \"an.\" Mr. Dorr, whose experience of the script is extensive,\nwrites on November 29, 1909, that, \"a and o written as they are often written\nin the script, not rarely need the help of the context to distinguish them . . .\nand '\nfleet behind on island ' is nonsense of a kind quite foreign to the general\ncharacter of what is said or written in the Piper trance.\" The tracing of the\noriginal, sent to me by Mr. Dorr, leaves undetermined the vowel in the third\nword ; it shows that the punctuation of the typewritten copy accurately repre-\nsents the divisions between the phrases in the original script.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper s Trainee. 75\nsitting of March iTtli he writes: \"The first one (i.e. fleet\nbehind on island) I am not clear about myself, hwt have\nsupposed it to refer to Aeneas' leaving the ships that came\nwith him to the African coast behind, when he went to\nDido's court. This does not seem to be satisfactory in view\nof the words used, as the ships were beached in a bay on\nthe mainland,^ not on an island, but I can recall no other\nincident it might refer to.\" On April 6th Mr. Dorr adds\nthe following note :\n\" I have just come by accident, in turning\nover the pages of the second book of the Aeneid, upon Aeneas'\ndescription of how, after leaving the Wooden Horse upon the\nTrojan plain, the Greek fleet apparently sailing for home re-\nmained hidden behind the island of Tenedos until the\nstratagem of the \"Wooden Horse had opened the way for\nstorming the city. My note upon this written after the sit-\nting shows my total lack of recollection of this incident at\nthat time, for I then searched my memory to find what there\nwas either in the Aeneid or in Homer to which the words,\n'\nfleet behind on island,' could apply and recalled nothing.\"\nThis incident then appears to show not only an intimate\nacqiiaintance with the Aeneid, but one beyond the conscious\npossession of the sitter.\nThis being so, it is worth considering whether any explanation\nwill account for the immediate transition from this incident\nto the death of Achilles, who, as the well-known story runs,\nwas wounded in the only vulnerable point, his heel, by an\narrow shot from the bow of Paris, but directed by the god\nApollo. To classical scholars a clue to the association of the\ntwo incidents is given in \" Tenedos,\" the name of the island\nbehind which the Greek fleet was concealed. The ancient\nfame and wealth of Tenedos, noted by Virgil, were due to\nthe island's possessing a temple of Apollo Smintheus.\" The\nname of the god of Tenedos, Apollo Smintheus, is rarely found\nin classical literature. Twice, and twice only, does his name\noccur in the extant accounts of the Trojan Epic. To the\narcher god of the silver bow, lord of Chryse, Killa and Tenedos,\naddressed as \" Smintheus,\" the old priest Chryses prays for\ni^e?i. I. 159, etc.\n-See Conington's note on Virgil, Aeneid II. 21. \"In Homer's time (\/\/. I. 38)\nthe island is famous for a temple of Apollo Smintheus.\"\n\f7(J Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nvengeance upon the Greeks, and the arrows of Apollo are\nshot forth in answer to those prayers. The story is told in\nthe First Iliad (II. I. 38, 452). To this same archer god,\naddressed as \" Smintheus,\" ISTeptune appeals to slay Achilles,\nand in answer to this prayer, the arrow of Paris is guided\nby Apollo against Achilles. The story is told by Ovid (llet.\nXII. 580), in the only passage in classical literature which\ndescribes in detail the death of Achilles.^ \u2022\n\u2022\nTenedos, then, the island which concealed the Greek fleet,\nwas a seat of the worship of Apollo Smintheus, the slayer of\nAchilles, and to those possessing this knowledge the transition\nfrom the one incident to the other is natural. But the history\nof Tenedos is not \" common knowledge \" even to classical\nscholars. Many persons familiar with Homer and Virgil might\nread the disjointed utterances of the trance-personality on\nMarch 17 without perceiving a link between the two phrases,\n\" Fleet l )ehind an island, \u2014soldiers in Horse,\" and \" Arrow in\nheel.\" Such a link, however, does in fact exist. Here, as\nelsewhere, familiarity with classical literature shows a coherence,\nwhere a first reading found only broken fragments, by supply-\ning an association of ideas which may account for the otherwise\narbitrary juxtaposition of unconnected allusions.^\nThe next point requiring comment is the production by\nMyerSp on this day of the phrases :\n\" Is there such anger in\ncelestial minds ? A hero for piety renowned\u2014should suffer and\ntoil.\" These words were spoken by the control immediately after\ntlie reading of lines 13-16 in Dryden's translation, as follows:\n\" For what offence the queen of Heaven began\nTo persecute so brave, so just a man\nInvolved his anxious life in endless cares.\nExposed to wants, and hurried into wars.\"\nThey represent lines 8-11, 3h(sa . . . ivijnderit, in the original.\nThe first sentence spoken by the control translates the line\n^ His death at the hands of Apollo and Paris is prophesied in the Iliad\n(XXII. 359) and alluded to by Virgil (Aen. VI. 57). Pindar {Pyih. III. 101)\nand Horace (Od. IV. 6, 3) allude to Apollo's share in the death of Achilles^\nand Euripides (Andr. 655, Hec. 387) attributes it to Paris.\n-For similar cases see Mr. Piddington's paper, pp. 98-102.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Pipers Trance. 77\nthat was to come, tantaene animis caelestihus irae ? represented\nby Dryden in the couplet,\n\" Can Heavenly minds such high resentment show\nOr exercise their spite in human woe.\"\nIt is certain that a Virgilian scholar, hearing a translation\nof the words insignevi 23'ieiate vincm, tot aclirc labores iminderit,\nwoidd expect the words tantaene animis caelestihus irae. And\nit is a remarkable proof of faniiliarity with the opening lines\nof the first Aeneid to combine phrases which translate both\nwhat has, and what has not, been read in Dryden's version.\nHere, again, the translation does not reproduce any version\nknown to me. \" A hero for piety renowned \" is a perfectly\naccurate rendering, and so is \" Is there such anger in celestial\nminds ?\n\" The words \" should suffer and toil \" accurately\nrepresent volvcre casus and adire labores.\nWhen the name Carthage {Ac7i. 1. 13) is read, the control\nadds \" Africa,\" and claims with justice to have uttered the\nword in a preceding waking-stage. The mention of Paris\n(Aen. I. 27) produces an allusion to Priam. But neither of\nthese connexions is beyond the range of ordinary knowledge.\nHere ended the experiment connected with the first Aeneid,\nthough there were some further scattered references to other\nbooks.^\nIt is impossible to summarise the above described refer-\nences to the Aeneid, but the four following points seem clear\n(1) Considerable knowledge of the contents of the poem\nwas shown by the trance-personality, and a certain familiarity\nwith the language\n(2) The knowledge shown was produced in a form sinmlating\nrevived memory, and was stimulated by quotations from the poem;\n(3) The answers, so far from representing the expectations\nof the sitter, were in some cases contrary to his belief, and\nsometimes maintained persistently in spite of criticism and\ncontradiction\n(4) The errors were not such as would be expected from\nhastily acquired or superficial knowledge, but rather such as\nmight be due to confusion or fargetfulness.\n'For one of these, see Mr. Piddington's paper, pp. 144-50.\n\f78 Mrs. A. W. Verrcdl. [part\nHere ends my examination in detail of attempts to \" revive\nthe literary memories \" of the trance-xiersonalities. One\nexperiment was tried with Greek ; but I do not propose\nto disciTss this here, for, interesting and successful though it\nwas, it does not contrilxite substantially towards the problems\nunder consideration. The sentence chosen and repeated to\nMrs. Piper in the original was the line from the Odyssey\nwhich Mr. Myers had expressed a desire to have \" graven on\nsome tablet in \" his memory. This wish is expressed in\nthe Fragments published in 1904;^ the line was engraved\nupon his tomb at Keswick and upon a memorial tablet to him\nin the Protestant Cemetery at Eome ; the Greek forms the\nmotto, and its translation the conclusion, of a commemorative\nnotice of Mr. Myers delivered in London by Sir Oliver Lodge\nin 1901, and published in Proceedings, Vol. XVII. Under\nthese circumstances, if Mrs. Piper had heard the line read\nor quoted, it is impossible to be sure that the sound of\nthe Greek would not recall its meairing. Failure to under-\nstand the line would, it is true, have been very damaging to\nthe claims of MyerSp, so that a certain value attaches to the\ncompletely successful result of this experiment. The method\nby which the result was obtained is precisely similar to that\nemployed in the experiments above described. There is there-\nfore no reason to distinguish between the knowledge shown\nhere and elsewhere ; the translation emerges in fragments,\npartly in the trance-writing, partly in the waking-stage, and\nis accompanied by allusions thoroughly appropriate under the\nsupposed circumstances.\nOther topics arising in these sittings deserve careful\nstudy.- As in the instances selected, they are of a \" mingled\n^ Frarpnents of Prose and Poetry, p. 48.\n-I have omitted all reference to one topic which occupies considerable space\nin the record, \u2014an attempt to obtain from Hodgsonp a translation of four lines\nof medieval Latin, which, on certain occasions, were printed on the Menu\ncard, at dinners of the Tavern Club in Boston, and would therefore have been\nfamiliar to Dr. Hodgson. My chief reasons for this omission are :\n(1) That many of the leading Latin words are either so universally familiar\n(e.g. Deus), or so like in sound or spelling to English words (e.g. Taverna,\nAwielorum chori, propitma) that their English equivalents could be easily\nguessed :\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper's Trance. 79\nyarn, good and ill together.\" But the disentangling of the\nthreads is a lengthy process. I will therefore here further\nquote only a few cases in illustration of particular points.\nObviously a point to be looked for in an examination of\nthese phenomena is the effect, if any, of the medium's own\nmind. It is difficult to find conclusive instances in these sit-\ntings, but there are two or three cases, in addition to the\nallusions above described to Poe's poems,^ where the normal\nknowledge of Mrs. Piper seems to have entered into the state-\nments of the trance-personalities. Thus on April 6th Mr.\nDorr asked the controls, both Hodgsoup and Myersp being\npresent :\n\" Do you understand what Pilgrim Fathers means ?\nTo this came the amazing answer :\n\" Something about birds or\nturkeys.\" The explanation occurred later to Mr. Dorr, and\nwas by him explained to the trance-personalities on April\n22nd: \"I have just discovered the association in E. H.'s mind\nbetween turkeys and pilgrims, that made the Light write the\none when I spoke of the other\u2014Pilgrim Fathers, Fast Day,\nThanksgiving and Turkey.\" The associations between these\nfour topics were probably also in Mrs. Piper's own mind ;\nthey\nare unfamiliar to the English reader. At any rate the next\nassociation seems more likely to be due to Mrs. Piper than to\nthe controls. On April 22nd, on passing into trance Mrs. Piper\nwhispered :\n\" Ship ! Three ladies on top of it.\" Myersp, when\nasked to explain this, said^ it was \" simply a recollection of\nValkyrie\u2014recollection only.\" Mr. Dorr points out that the\nconnexion between a ship and the Valkyrie, wholly unaccountable\n(2) that these words, if guessed, might give the chie to their context to anj'\none who had seen or heard the Latin verses ;\n(3) that it is impossible to prove that Mrs. Piper had not at some time\nseen or heard the Latin verses ;\n(4) that in fact she probably had seen the first line, which is quoted in the\ncommemorative notice of Richard Hodgson by Mr. M. A. de Wolfe Howe,\npublished in the Proceedings, Vol. XIX.\nUnder these circumstances, and as the attempts at translation, though pre-\nsenting points of interest, do not afford conclusive evidence as to the knowledge\npossessed by the trance-personalities, it seemed useless to describe the incident\nin detail. See, however, a discussion of it in connexion with an elaborate\ncross-eorrespondence in Miss Johnson's paper below, p. 222.\n^ See p. 59. See also the foot-note on p. 115.\n-This is perhaps another instance of the failure of the ti'ance-personalities\nwhen using the hand to understand the utterances spoken in the waking-stage.\n\f80 3Irs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nat first sight and not traceable in the old Norse stories of\nwhich he was thinking, may corne from some recollection of\nthe name of Lord Dunraven's yacht, the Valkyrie, very familiar\nat one time to readers of the daily press. On May 8th, in\nthe waking-stage, an allusion to Longfellow's ^ poem. The Old\nClock on the Stairs, intervenes between a quotation from Words-\nworth's We are Seven and from Browning's Rahhi Ben Ezra.\nOn this occasion the controls, when commenting on the utter-\nances of the waking-stage, repudiated all responsibility for the\nallusion to Longfellow.\nAnother point of some interest, but requiring a paper to\nitself for adequate treatment, is the persistent \" dramatization\n\"\nby means of which Hodgsoup and Myersp are distinguished.\nOn many occasions both controls are represented as present.\nBut sometimes one only is there, and sometimes, even when\nboth are present, only one takes part. The sitter does\nnot always remember, when a particular subject is under dis-\ncussion, that one or other of the controls was absent or\nnot listening when the subject was last spoken of. But so\nfar as I have been able to discover, no mistake on this\npoint is ever made l)y the controls. One instance must\nsuffice. On May 8th Mr. Dorr, having asked who was con-\ntrolling, and received the reply, \" Both, E. H. chiefly,\" read\nfour lines of Mr. Myers's translation of Aeneid VI., 146-149,\na passage descriptive of the Golden Bough, but not naming\nit. The acknowledgement of the reading and question as\nto its subject came from Hodgsoup. On May 12 th, both\ncontrols being present at the sitting, Mr. Dorr read the\nsame four lines, introducing them with the words :\n\" Now I\nwant to read you something which I read you once before.\"\nTo this Myersp replied :\n\" Did you recite it to me before,\nfriend ? If so, I did not fully understand.\" This division\nbetween the two persons may be a device to account for in-\naccuracies or forgetfulness, but the persistency with which it\nis carried through is in any case remarkable. No answer was\ngiven to the question about the Golden Bough, which was put\nnear the end of the series of sittings. But the two or three\nallusions to the subject\u2014which show no knowledge of its\nliterary associations\u2014are all made hy Hodgsoup.\n^ See Miss .Johnson's paper, pp. 22.3-4.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper's Trance. 81\nThe reader will have already observed that occasionally\nwords required to answer the sitter's question appear in the\nform of a personal allusion, or at least have a face-value\nunlike the inner meaning.^ Thus the sentence, \" See those\npretty little children,\" which, in my view, is suggested by\nreminiscences of Comus, appears to refer to something quite\ndifferent. Similarly, I believe the \" troubles and trials \" of\nMarch 31st to refer to a passage in the Agaviemnon, but they\ntake the form of an address to the medium as she comes out of\ntrance. A similar case is commented on by Mr. Piddington.'\nIn the waking-stage of March 30th occur the words, \"Tell Mr.\nDorr I say my utterances echo everywhere. If that is he, I\nthink he will understand what I mean by echo, if that is he.\"\nThe intention here seems twofold ;\nprimarily to suggest cross-\ncorrespondences\u2014a subject likely to interest Ijoth the sitter and\nthe medium ;\nsecondarily to convey the word Eclio as part of\na series of allusions to Ovid.\nThere is a clear instance of the personal application of a\nVii'gilian phrase on March 30th. Here the words in the\nwaking-stage run, \" He says tell him celestial minds. He\nsays such enmity in celestial minds\u2014he says not so\u2014there\nisn't any in their minds.\" Clearly the first half of these\nwords refer to the translation of the Virgilian phi'ase already\ngiven by Myersp on March l7tli. But the latter half applies\nthe phrase to the presumed situation of the controls. This char-\nacteristic is far more freqiient in the waking-stage than in the\ntrance-writing. I have not found in the trance-script ^ any in-\nstances closely parallel with those above quoted. There are\ntwo or three playful remarks, but no cases in which a whole\nsentence is apparently used for the introduction of a par-\nticular word. This is one of several points of distinction\nbetween the methods in use in the trance proper and in the\nwaking-stage.\nThe waking-stage developed considerably in the course of\nthese sittings. Eeaders familiar with the trance phenomena\nof Mrs. Piper will remember Dr. Hodgson's description of the\nconditions.'* He says, \" she frequently repeats statements\n^ See Mr. Piddington's paper, p. 134. -See p. 116.\n^ One is quoted by Mr. Piddington from the English sittings in 1906-7.\n* Proceedinrjs S.P.R., Vol. XIII. pp. 397-401.\nF\n\f82 Mrs. A.

As the waking-stage pro-\ngresses, the part played by Mrs. Piper increases witli her\nreturning consciousness.\nIn the English sittings 1906-1907, it became obvious that\nsome of tlie most distinctive indications of cross-correspondences\nwith other automatists were given in the waking-stage. In\nthis stage emerged, for instance, \" laurel wreath,\" \" Crossing the\nBar,\" \"Arthur Hallam,\" and \"Light in West.\" ^ In these\nAmerican sittings of 1908 the development of the waking-stage\nwas continued and extended. The time given to it was pro-\nlonged, the sentences became more coherent, and there was\nan increasing consciousness shown of the general situation\nand in particular of the presence of the sitter. Some of the\nclearest and most definite answers to questions asked during\nthe trance proper were given in the waking-stage.\nMy first examination of these records led me to observe\nhow often during the reading over to the trance-personalities\nof the utterances in previous waking-stages, the trance-script\nfailed to improve upon the trance-speech. Mr. Piddington's\nstudy of the sittings led him to the same conclusion, and he\nfurther noticed that on several occasions the trance-personalities,\nwhen communicating through the hand, positively misconstrued\nwhat had previously been communicated through the voice.\nSome instances of this misconstruction have been noted above.\nThe following may be added to the list.\nIn the waking-stage of March 24th, 1908, came these words:\n\" I walked in the garden of the gods\u2014entranced I stood along\nits banks\u2014like one entranced I saw her at last . . . Elysian\nshores.\" Mr. Piddington has suggested ' that this may be an\nallusion to the reunion of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Fields\nof the Blest ; but whether it be or not, it does not suggest\n^ Procefdiiigs S.P.R., Vol. XXII. pp. 94, 126, 269.\n^ See his paper, p. 95.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Piper's Trance. 83\nwhat MyerSp, in the writing part of the sitting of March\n30th, said it was, namely, an allusion to Venus. Venus had\nbeen mentioned, though in quite another connexion, in the\nwaking-stage of March 24th, and this seems to have led to the\nconfusion.\nIn the waking-stage of March 24th, Mrs. Piper enunciated\nthe letters C, Y, and X, apparently dropping a letter between\nthe C and Y. There can, I think, be no reasonable doubt\nthat this was an attempt to produce the word Ceyx. When\nhowever, Mr. Dorr, at the sitting of March 30th, asked for\nan explanation, the answer he received\n\u2014\" chariot \"\u2014was hope-\nlessly irrelevant (see below, pp. 94-5).\nIn the waking-stage of April 6th^ came the words :\n\" Inno-\ncence, Faith. He has a bird upon his hand. . . . Mr. Myers\nhas got Pygmalion\u2014birds\u2014Paradise.\" Later, after allusions to\nother topics, came, \" There were two pigeons over the door.\nCame a-knocking at my chamber door. Virgin's chamber.''\nVirgin's chamber is, as we have seen, an undoubted allusion\nto the Parthenon,- so that the second utterance itself suggests\n\u2014and subsequent explanations on April 7th make this plain\nthat two pigeons or doves are associated with the Parthenon.\nThe first utterance seems clearly to connect \" birds \" with\n\" Pygmalion.\" What the meaning of either sentence is, or\nwhether there is any meaning, is not what we are now con-\nsidering. The point is that the trance-script of April 7th\nthrew no light upon the words of the waking-stage of April\n6 th, when in answer to Mr. Dorr's request for an explanation\nof the words, \" he has a bird upon his hand \" (see below, p. 108)\n\u2014which belonged to the Pygmalion context\u2014he was told that\nthey referred to the Parthenon.-^\nOn April 7th in the waking-stage, came an ob^dous reference\nto the story of Hyacinthus,^ \" A lily came up out of the blood.\"\nYet, when questioned by Mr. Dorr on April 13th about this,\nMyersp says,\u2014tentatively it is true, or perhaps interrogatively,\n\" It was an utterance about Prometheus.\"\n^ See p. 107. - See above, p. 59.\n^See above (p. 59) for the confusion between Venus' chamber anrl Virgin's\nchamber, which may be responsible for the mention of two pigeons or doves\n(Venus' birds) over the door of the Parthenon.\n^ See Mr. Piddington\"s paper, p. 109.\n\f84 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nIf any conclusion may be based iipon the above-described\nand other similar instances, it would seem to be that, in the\nwaking-stage, a trance-personality sometimes either knows more\nor can express himself better than when making written\ncommunications. Mr. Piddington has drawn my attention to\nthree points of distinction between the phenomena of the\ncomplete trance and those of the waking-stage :\n(1) In Mr. Dorr's sittings (and with very few exceptions\nthis is equally true of all the other series of sittings in recent\nyears) the words in tlie waking-stage are represented as delivered\ndirectly to the medium by the communicating spirits themselves,\nwhereas the great majority of their written communications are\nrepresented as first delivered l)y them to Rector, and then by\nhis help committed to writing.\n(2) Consistently with this real or pretended modus operandi,\nthe language of the waking-stage seems nowhere to show any\ntrace of Eector's influence, whereas the language of the script is\nto a large degree coloured by Eector's own peculiar phraseology.\n(3) Whereas Rector is never (or very rarely) uncertain\nas to what has been written, the other trance-personalities are\noften uncertain how much, if any part, of their messages,\ndelivered in the waking-stage, lias got through ; and they\nappear to be often, if not always, unaware of what the medium\nmay have spontaneously said, wlien speaking in her own person\nduring the waking-stage.\nI would not be understood as saying that the trance-script\nnever improves upon the trance-speech. On the contrary, where\nprogressive knowledge is shown, a later trance-script often\nadds a fresh point to the utterances of the waking-stage.\nWhat is conspicuous in a study of the record, is the greater\nfacility shown in the waking-stage for the production of par-\nticular points that can be briefly expressed. Names, for\ninstance, seem much more easily produced in the waking-\nstage. The remarks of the sitter are more easily conveyed to\nthe controls, and long answers are better given, in the course\nof the trance-writing. Communication, in fact, between sitter\nand \" control,\" whatever that word denotes, takes place more\nfreely then. The waking-stage seldom permits of interchange\nof question and answer.\n\fLX.] Classical and Literary Allusions in Mrs. Pi2Jer's Trance. 85\nWithout pronouncing on the degree or kind of dissociation\ninvolved in the waking-stage and during the trance-writing\nrespectively, it is at any rate clear that in the waking-stage\nwe are dealing with a personality conceiving itself as Mrs.\nPiper, not as a \" Eector \" or a \" Phinuit.\" This may account\nfor the colloquialisms, personal turns, and ambiguous phrases,\nwhich are relatively frequent in the waking-stage. Probably\nhere, as in other cases of automatic phenomena where the\nunconsciousness of the automatist is not complete, an allusion\nso worded as not to be easily compiehensible by the automatist\nhas more chance of being registered.\n\f86 J.

Piddington.\nI.\nLETHE.\nAt the sitting of March 23, 1908, Mr. Dorr talked over various\ncross-correspondence experiments and other matters which had\ncome up at previous sittings with Myersp and Hodgsonp.\nHe also read five letters to them.^\nTowards the end of the sitting Mr. Dorr for the first time put\nthis question to Myersp :\n\" what does the word lethb\nSUGGEST to you ?\n\" The answers given were in part, though not\nby any means, as Mr. Dorr supposed, wholly confused ; and\nMr. Dorr, who evidently thought that the frequent change of\nsubject had by putting an undue strain on the attention of the\ntrance-personalities conduced to the confusion, apologised for\nhaving sprung a new question upon Myersp at the end of a\nfatiguinfj sitting.\nI shall now quote in chronological order the various refer-\nences to the question about Lethe which were made at Mr.\nDorr's sittings. To the reader, unless he should happen to hit\non the clue to the puzzle, these extracts will doubtless seem\nto be little if any better than a farrago of nonsense. It may,\ntherefore, help him to work his way through them without too\nmuch impatience, if I first assure him that they contain an\nunusually complete and relevant, though very far from obvious,\nanswer to the question put by Mr. Dorr.\n'\nThe substance of these letters is given in Note A, p. 136.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 87\nExtract from record of sitting held on March 23, 1908.\n(Present: G.

I understand what you are after now.i But can't\nyou make it clearer what there was peculiar about the\nAvaters of Lethe ?\nYes, I suppose you think I am affected in the same way\nbut I am not.2\n^ Mr. Dorr saw that a reference was intended to the Cave of Sleep, and\nwhy such a reference might be vaguely relevant ; but he did not grasp how\npointed and direct it really was.\n- The way in which Myersp here withheld the obvious and commonplace\nanswer until pressed to give it by Mr. Dorr is, I think, deserving of the utmost\nattention ; for the fact that in at least three other instances this same\navoidance of the trite and obvious is to be found in the communications of\nMyersp creates a presumption that Myersp deliberately preferred so to frame\nhis messages that only study and thought would render them intelligible.\nIn one of these three cases (see p. 107) Myersp, wishing, as I think, to make\nnot a general allusion to the well-known story of Pygmalion and Galatea, but\na particular allusion to the story as told by Ovid, who gives no name to the\nmarble statue that came to life, at first mentioned the name \" Pygmalion \" only,\nand did not mention \"Galatea\" until Mr. Dorr asked for an explanation of\n\"Pygmalion\" (see pp. 108-9).\nIn a second instance (see jip. l-t6, 147), instead of answering the question\n\"Where did the Sibyl live?\", by saying simply \" Cumae \", Myersp indicated\nby means of two proper names, Auchises and Icarus, a passage in the sixth\nbook of the Aeneid, where the dwelling place of the Sibyl is described.\nIn a third instance (see Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 397-407), instead of answer-\ning the question, \"Which Ode of Horace entered deeply into your inner life?\"\nby saying simply \"Horace, Odes i. 28\", Myersp alluded to a poem of Frederic\nMyers's containing phrases reminiscent of this Ode. Yet later developments\nstrongly suggest that Myersp could have given a much directer response, had\nhe wished, for he afterwards showed that he knew that the Ode of Horace to\nwhich the question related contained references to Neptune and Orion (see\npp. 157, 158).\nSimilarly here, it is quite clear that Myersp knew the ordinary associations\nwith Lethe and could have answered the question quite simply ; yet he preferred\nto give an indirect answer, and withheld a simple and obvious answer until Mr.\nDorr pressed for one.\nIn three instances out of the four, then, it was not apparently inability to\nsend a plain straightforward message that was the cause of the allusiveness.\nNow, in discussing the form in which the answer to the Horace Ode question\nemerged, I argued that it was perhaps due to a desire on the part of Myersp to\nframe his answer in terms not expected by his questioner, and thus to circum-\nvent as far as possible a telepathic explanation of the phenomenon (see Journal\n\f92 J. G. Piddington. [part\nG. B. D. Capital. That's as clear as can be.\nDid you understand Cave\"?\nG. B. D.

D. then reads a few lines in Latin describing Juno's\nvisit to the Cave of Aeolus ; and Hodgsonp makes a con-\nfused response. Thereupon G. B. D. proposes to give\nhim \"one or two new words to work over\", and\nHodgson,, replies as follows:)\nDo not give me too much, George. Let us go slow so we\ncan take it all in. Elysian came in.\nfor January 1909, p. 23). This was an over-bold conjecture, perhaps; but I think\nthe cases quoted above go a gond way towards justifying it. And in this con-\nnexion it is fortunate tliat evidence lias now come to hand tending to\nshow that the allusiveness, which characterises not only the answer to the\nHorace Ode question but also several of the complex cross-correspondences,\nmay represent a deliberate plan and not an unskilful attempt to hit a given\nmark ; for until it did come to hand, it was easy to argue that the allusiveness,\nfar from being designed, was merely due to failure on the part of the automatist\nto get a direct reproduction of an idea ;\nor, in other words, was but an\nexample of imperfect telepathy. That imperfect telepathy is the true explana-\ntion of some\u2014perhaps of a good many\u2014instances of allusiveness I do not\ndoubt; but I equally do not doubt that it is not the explanation of them all.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings : Lethe. 93\nG.

[part\nThe main part of the answer given to the question about\nLethe consists of allusions to a passage in Ovdd's Metamor-\njyhoses, but preceding these allusions are two isolated words,\n\" Olympus \" and \" Sibyl \", which do not belong to the Ovidian\npart of the answer. As they need but a few words of com-\nment, it will be convenient to deal with them before entering\non the long explanations and comments which the remainder\nof the answer will necessitate.\nIn \"Olympus\" I can trace no meaning.^ It occurred first\namong the preliminary and muddled attempts to give an\nanswer ; a second time, thrice repeated, in the waking-stage\nof March 23, 1908, and a third time in the waking-stage of\nMarch 31, 1908, in a sentence of which it was the only dis-\ntinguishable word (see p. 106). On March 30, 1908, in response\nto an enquiry of Mj'. Dorr's, Myersp said that an explanation\nof \" Olympus \" had been given previously ;\nbut, if so, I have\nfailed to find it, and I do not believe that any was given.\nThe word \"Sibyl\", however, is intelligible and appropriate.\nMr. IDorr, it must be remembered, did not originally ask what\nLethe was, but what it suggested ; and Lethe might well\nsuggest the Sibyl of Cumae to a Veigiliau scholar (which\nMyersp professes to be), for v\/hen Aeneas, as described in the\nsixth book of the Aeneid, saw the river of Lethe flowing by\nthe Elysian Fields and the souls about to return to earth\ndrinking of its waters, he was in her company. That this is\nthe right explanation is rendered the more probable by the\nfact that Myersp later on answered two other questions by\nmeans of allusions to two other incidents told in the sixth\nbook of the Aeneid {v. pp. 145 and 147). \"Olympus\" and\n\" Sibyl \" being thus disposed of, I pass on to the remainder\nof the answer.\nThe only point which Mr. Dorr saw in the answers to his\nquestion was the allusion to the Cave of Sleep, which he\nthought was probably due to an association of ideas between\nthe oblivion produced by the waters of Lethe and the oblivion\nof sleep. In November, 1908, Mrs. Verrall went carefully\nthrough the records of Mr. Dorr's sittings, and\u2014though she\n1 See, however, p. 327 for an explanation of \"Olympus\" discovered too late\nfor insertion here.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Letlie. 99\nfound a good mauy instances where answers given in the\ntrance to questions on literary and classical subjects, which to\nMr. Dorr had seemed vague or meaningless, were really indica-\ntive or suggestive of real knowledge\u2014she failed to trace any\ncoherence in the answei-s given to the question about Lethe.\nAnother classical scholai', Mr. Gerald Balfour, when he read\nthrough the records, likewise saw no sense in these answers.\nNor did I, when I first considered them. But I was struck by\nthe way in which Myersp and Hodgsoup at the sitting of March\n24, 1908, spontaneously repeated, amplified and emphasised the\nanswer given to the Lethe question on the previous day ;\nand\nshowed themselves apprehensive of its not having been under-\nstood, and confident of its relevancy. When confidence of this\nkind is exhibited by the trance-personalities it is usually well-\nfounded. Accordingly I thought it worth while to search for\npassages in classical authors which might throw light on the\nmatter; and by good luck came on a passage in the eleventh\nbook, hitherto unknown to me, of the Metamorphoses of Ovid,\nwhich explains and justifies the main part of the answers given\nin the trance. In this book Ovid tells the story of the trans-\nformation of Ceyx, king of Trachin, into a kingfisher, and\nof his wife, Alcyone, daughter of Aeolus, into a halcyon. I\nappend what is partly a summary and partly a literal trans-\nlation of the passage in question.\nSummary of Ovid, Metamorphoses XL 410-748.\nCeyx, in order to consult tlie oracle about the fate of liis brother\nDaedalion who had been changed into a hawk, starts on a voyage\nto Clares ; but is shipwrecked on the way and drowned.\nMeanwhile, Alcyone, who sorely against her will has been left\nbehind at home, in ignorance of her husband's death importunes the\ngods and especially Juno for his safety. But to make supplication\non behalf of one who is dead is an unholy act, and so unacceptable\nto Juno ;\nwho, in order that her temple may no longer be polluted\nby the prayers of Alcyone, bids Iris, the messenger of the gods,\n\"seek speedily the drowsy court of Somnus \\_i.e. Sleep], and order\nhim to send to Alcyone a vision, in the form of the dead Ceyx, to\nreveal the sad truth.\" Thereupon \" Iris clothes herself in raiment\nof a thousand hues, and, imprinting her bended bow upon the sky,\n\f100 J. G. Piddington. [part\nseeks, as bid, King Sleep's abode that lies hidden beneath a cloud.\nNear by the Cimmerians' land is a cave with deep recess, a hollow\nmount, the home and sanctuar}' of slothful Sleep, where neither at\ndawn, nor noon, nor eve can Phoebus enter in. From out the\nground reek mists and murky fogs, glimmering in a doubtful dusky\nlight. . . . Beasts there are none, nor flocks, nor branches waving\nin the breeze ; and never outcry of human voice awakes the echoes.\nIt is the home of silent rest. Yet [the silence is not absolute, for]\nfrom the foot of the rock issues the stream of the water of Lethe,\nand as the wave glides purling through the stream among the\nbabbling pebbles, it invites sleep. Before the cavern's entrance\nabundant poppies bloom and herbs innumerable, from the juice\nwhereof Night brews sleep. . . . No watchman on the threshold\nstands ; but in the centre is a couch, . . . whereon lies the god\nhimself [i.e. Somnus] with limbs in languor loosed.\" . . . Iris enters\nthe cave, irradiating it with the colours of her apparel, delivers her\nmessage to Somnus, and quickly departing returns to the heavens\nalong the rainbow-path by which she came. From among his\nthousand sons, Somnus chooses Morpheus, whose special gift it is to\nmimic the form, visage, gait and speech of man, to execute the task\nthat Iris has enjoined. Morpheus flies to Trachin, and appears in\nthe form of Ceyx to Alcyone, who thus learns her husband's fate.\nOvercome by despair Alcyone goes down to the sea to drown her-\nself, and as she stands upon the shore the body of a drowned man\nis washed up close to her. She recognises it as her husband's corpse,\nand flings herself into the water. In the act of falling she is trans-\nformed into a halcyon. The gods take pity on her sorrow, and after\na time transform Ceyx into a kingfisher ; and thus Alcyone rejoins\nher beloved mate. \" For seven tranquil days in winter-time Alcyone\nsits broodinij on her nest as it floats on the face of the waters. Then\nlulled is the wave of the sea ; and Aeolus guards and confines the\nwinds, and secures a calm surface for his daughter's brood.\"\nLet me now compare the allusions in the trance with Ovid's\nstory :\nTrance.

G. Piddington. [part\nThe references in the trance to \" cave \",\n\" flower banks \",\n\"clouds\" and \"poppies\" show that the recollections of the\ntrance-personality were not confined to the general outline of\nthe story of Ceyx and Alcyone, but extended to details of\nthe story as told in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and especially to\ndetails there closely connected with the river of Lethe.\nThe first attempts on March 23, 1908, to answer Mr. Dorr's\nquestion are hopeless muddles ;\nthough possibly the irrelevant\nreferences to \" wipds \", \" Troy \" and a \"river\" betray how the\nmind of the trance-personality was struggling towards a rele-\nvant recollection. Though the name of Aeolus had not been\nactually mentioned, Myersp had at previous sittings (see\nMrs. Verrall's paper, pp. C3-6S) spontaneously made an allusion\nto the storm which Aeolus at Juno's bidding let loose from\nthe Cave of the Winds in order to overwhelm the fleet of\nAeneas, who was \" carrying Troy and her household gods\ninto Italy \" (Verg. Aen. I. 50 et seq.). Confused thoughts\nof \"winds\", \"Troy\" and \"river\" may have aroused memories\nof the Cave of Aeolus and of how Juno and Aeolus tried\nto thwart Aeneas' escape from Troy ; and these memories\nin turn may have awakened a recollection of a story into\nwhich a daughter of Aeolus^ {i.e. Alcyone), Juno, the Cave of\nSleep and the river of Lethe enter. Whether this was so or\nnot, it is at any rate noteworthy that when after the pre-\nliminary muddles a relevant recollection did emerge, it was\nheralded by the words \"It is all clear\", and that these words\nwere emphasised by being underlined. \u00bb\nNeither Mrs. Piper nor Mr. Dorr had read any Ovid.- Ac-\ncordingly, if Mrs. Piper's own memory furnished the reminis-\ncences of the Ceyx and Alcyone story displayed in the trance,\nor if she obtained them telepathically from Mr. Dorr, our next\nstep must be to enquire what book or books other than Ovid\ncould have supplied Mrs. Piper or Mr. Dorr with the details of\nthe story given in the trance. I think we may with confidence\n^Alcj'one is twice called Aeolis, i.e. daughter of Aeolus, by Ovid. See\n3fet. XI. 444 and .573, and cf. 11. 747-8.\n-The evidence for this statement will be found in Note B. (pp. 138-42)\nwhere I have placed it in order not to interrupt the main narrative.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 103\ndispense with sci'utiuisiug classical dictionaries of the ordinary\nkinds, for though doubtless they would all su6 voce \"Alcyone\"\ngive the main outlines of her story, and though some might\n(though so far I have not come across any that do) suh voce\n\" Lethe \" refer to Ovid's description of its source, it is most\nunlikely that suh voce \"Alcyone\" the}^ would mention Lethe\nor the Cave of Sleep, or that sub voce \" Lethe \" they would\nmention Ceyx and Alcyone.\nWe must look rather to the kinds of books which would be\nlikely to reproduce the Ceyx and Alcyone story in consider-\nable detail, and which at the same time are likely to have\ncome within the range of Mr. Dorr's or Mrs. Piper's reading.\nIn dieither of Hawthorne's Wonder Books are Ceyx and\nAlcyone mentioned, nor is there any allusion to the Cave of\nSleep. In Kingsley's Heroes the story of Ceyx and Alcyone\nis briefly, and in Frederick Tennyson's Daphne and Other\nPoems diti'usely, told ; but in neither is there the slightest\nallusion to Iris, Somnus, Morpheus, the Cave of Sleep, the\nriver of Lethe or poppies : that is to say, to any of the dis-\ntinctive details of Ovid's version which wei'e reproduced in the\ntrance. The story is also very briefly and baldly told in\nWordsworth's Greece; but here again are none of the details\npeculiar to Ovid's version. Chaucer in The Dethe of Blaunche\nthe Duchesse- tells the stor}' of Se3's (i.e. Ceyx) and Alcyone at\nconsiderable length ;\nbut, though he borrows largely from\nOvid, he makes no mention of Lethe and its poppies, and\nJuno's messenger is given no name and is spoken of as \" he \".\nSpenser (Canto I. of The Faerie Queene) has borrowed several\nof the details of his \" House of Morpheus \" from Ovid's\ndesci'iption of the Cave of Sleep ; but Lethe is not named, nor\nare poppies, and there is no reference whatsoever to Iris or\nJuno, or to Ceyx and Alcyone. From none of these books\nthen could the knowledge shown in the trance have been\nderived.\nI know of two books only, other than Ovid, from which\nMrs. Piper or Mr. Dorr could have derived the details of the\nCeyx and Alcyone story as given in the trance. These two\nbooks are Bulfinch's The Age of Fable and Gayley's The\nClassic Myths in English Literature : the latter, as stated on\n\f104 J. G. Piddington. [part\nthe title-page, being \"based chiefly on Bulfinch's Age of\nFable \", and being, in fact, an enlarged and modernised edition\nof it.\n\u2022\nNeither Mrs. Piper nor Mr. Dorr had, until I mentioned it\nto them, ever heard of Gayley's book. Mrs. Piper affirms in\nthe most positive manner that she had never read, seen or\nheard of Bulfinch's book.^ Mi'. Dorr, however, had read Bul-\nfinch as a boy (see note B, p. 141), and consequently, if the\nallusions in the trance had been confined to t'le Geyx and\nAlcyone story only, he might, in spite of the fact that he\nretains no recollection of it and failed to recognise the allu-\nsions to it in the trance, be regarded as the source from\nwhich Mrs. Piper telepathically deiived her knowledge. \u00bb\nBut the allusions in the trance were not confined to the\nstory of Ceyx and Alcyone. Allusions to other Ovidian\nstories followed them, and were combined with them and with\neach other in such a way as to leave no reasonable doubt that\nthe person responsible for this combination was reproducing\nhis recollections of a combination of stories peculiar to Ovid.\nThe evidence for this statement is to be found in the\nappended group of extracts from the records :\nReferences to Echo and Narcissus ; Janus ; Saturn ;\nAND Orpheus and Eurydice.\nExtract from record of ivords spoken in the waking-stage of\nthe trance of March 30, 1908.\nJanus.

He took them to refer to the\nstory of the flower that sprang from the blood of Ajax ; and neither\nat this point, nor at any later period of the sittings did he realise that\nthey were a correct allusion to the flower that sprang from the blood\nof Hyacinthus.

B. D. had mentioned, in connexion with the cross-\ncorrespondence messages, Horace, Homer and Aristophanes\nas well as Ovid. It should be noticed that out of the\nfour classical authors Myersp remarks on Ovid only. A^te\nhj J. G. P.]\nIt will be observed that in the foregoing extracts Mj^ersp\nmentioned three classical stories : those, namely, connected with\nthe names of Orpheus and Eurydice, Pygmalion, and Hyacin-\nthus. It will further be observed that Myersp did not explain\nwhy lie referred to Orpheus and Eurydice and to Pygmalion\nwhereas, though he cannot be said to have definitely explained\nwhy he referred to Hyacinthus, he nevertheless said enough to\nlet it be seen why he was led to do so. Thus on March 31,\nMr. Dorr asked where a certain statue stood ; and gave a\nclue to the right answer by saying that the place where\nthis statue stood was famous for its games : meaning thereby\nOlympia. Myersp at once replied, \" Races Marathon.\" This\ncurious reply represents, I cannot doubt, an approach, by way\nof a very modern association of ideas, to the right answer,\n' The knowledge here shown by Mr. Dorr of the fact that the stories of\nPegasus and Hyacinthus are treated of by Ovid was acquired only after references\nto them had first been made by the trance-personality. These references led\nhim to look up Pegasus and Hyacinthus in works of reference, and it was in\nthis way that he obtained his information.\n\fLX.] Thi'ee Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 115\nOlympia.^ At the next sitting on April G, the word \"Discobolus\n\"\n(\" discus-thrower \"), which was distinctly stated to have been\ngiven with reference to the place famous for its games where\nthe statue stood, may be regarded as representing a second\napproach to Olympia by means of an allusion to discus-\nthrowing ; for discus-throwing was one of the events of the\npentathlon, and the pentathlon was first introduced at Olympia.\nThat this is the right interpretation is rendered practically\ncertain by the fact that the reference to the discus on April 7\nwas accompanied by references to two other events in the\nOlympic pentathlon, spear-throwing and wrestling: \"Do you\nremember disk ? and spear\u2014wrestling \".\nBut meanwhile, the attempt to express Olympia having first\nof all suo-crested disciis-throwino;, discus-throwing in turn had\nreminded Myersp of a story\u2014that of Hyacinthus\u2014of which\nthe throwing of a discus forms a prominent feature ; for the\nword \"discobolus\" on April 6 had been immediatel}' followed\nby the first of several allusions to the Hyacinthus story,\nnamely, \"discus hit me\".\nSince the discus figures in a good many classical stories, it\nmight be thought that a reference to any one of these stories\nwould have served the trance-personality's purpose just as\nwell as the one actually mentioned. And so, no doubt, it\nwould, had the ol)ject been merely to show acquaintance\nwith the meaning of \"discobolus\". But, as we shall presently\nsee, this particular reference to the Hyacinthus story seems to\nhave fulfilled a collateral purpose which reference to none of\nthe other stories would have done (v. pp. 117-20).\nConnexion between the Foregoing References.\nI will now proceed to explain what in my view occasioned\nthe references to Orpheus and Eurydice and to Pygmalion, and\n1 There was, of course, no such connexion in classical times as there is\nnowadays between Marathon and the Olj'mpic Games. The intrusion of this\nunscholarly, and hence inappropriate, association of ideas in the communica-\ntions of MyerSp may perhaps be accounted for by supposing that Mrs. Piper\nfailed to record in writing the word Olympia, with which nevertheless her\nmind had been impressed ah extra, and recorded instead a word associated in\nher own mind with Olympia, viz. \"Marathon.\"\n\f116 J. G. Piddington. [part\nhow they throw light on the source from which the knowledge\nof the Ceyx and Alcyone story was derived.\nThe question about Lethe, it will be remembered, was put\non March 23, and the answer to it\u2014consisting of allusions to\nthe story of Ceyx and Alcyone as told in the eleventh book\nof Ovid's Metamorplioses\u2014^was begun on the same day and\npractically completed by March 24. On March 30 Myersp, in\nthe waking-stage, after saying \" Janus \", which, for reasons to\nbe explained presently, I take to be an allusion to an Ovidian\npassage, speaks of Echo and Narcissus ; then mentions Janus\nagain in conjunction with Saturn, and, almostly directly after-\nwards, suggests by a play on the word \" Echo \" that the\npreceding \"Echo and Narcissus\" is a cross-correspondence;\nnext says that \"it\", i.e. apparently \"echo\", reminds him of\nOrpheus and Eurydice ; and finally mentions both \" Janus\nand \"Echo\" again in consecutive utterances. On March 31\nMyersp explains to Mr. Dorr that his utterances \" to the spirit\nof the Light \", i.e. his utterances in the waking-stage, reminded\nhim that he had written about Echo and Narcissus through\nMrs. Holland.\nThe connexion of thought between these utterances becomes\nat once intelligible, if we assume that \" Janus \" and \" Saturn \",\n\" Echo and Narcissus \" and \" Orpheus and Eurydice \" are all\nOvidian allusions: Janus and Saturn to Fasti 1. 1-294; Echo\nand Narcissus to Metamorphoses IIL 339-510; and \"Orpheus\nand Eurydice\" to Metamoriohoses X. 1-77 and XI. 1-66. The\nOvidian reminiscences evoked by the question about Lethe had\nrecalled other Ovidian allusions, of which Myersy and MyersH\nhad made, or had tried to make, use : namely, the allusion to\nJanus under the title of claviger in Mrs. Verrall's script of\nMarch 25, 1907 (see below, p. 124, and Proc. Vol. XXIL\npp. 253 et seq.), and an allusion to Echo in Mrs. Holland's\nscript which had not emerged at this time but which did\nemeige later ;^ and they also recalled Ovid's version of the\nOrpheus and Eurydice story. But while Myersp explains why\nhe was reminded of Janus and Narcissus,\u2014that is, he claims\nthem as the subjects of cross-correspondences,\u2014he does not\nexplain why he was reminded of Orpheus and Eurydice.\n^\nThis case will be dealt with later by Miss Johnson.\n\fLx.] Tliree Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 117\nIn the waking-stage of April 6 two more Ovidian reminis-\ncences emerge: to Hyacinthus in the words \"Discus hit me\",\nand to Pj^gmalion. So we get explanations of four out of\nsix references in all made in the trance to stories told by\nOvid : namely, of those to Ceyx and Alcyone, Janus, Echo\nand Narcissus, and Hyacinthus. Of the remaining two,\nOrpheus and Eurydice, and Pygmalion, no explanation was\nvouchsafed.\nThe tenth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses opens with the\ndeath of Eurydice, and Orpheus' descent into Hades in quest\nof her. Ovid then goes on to relate how Orpheus in his\nsorrow retires to Mount lihodope, and there sings of the rape\nof Ganymede ; of the death of Hyacinthus and of the fiower\nthat sprang from his blood ; of the transformation of the\nCerastae into bulls ; of the Propoetides changed into stones ; of\nPygmalion's statue changed into a living woman; of Myrrha;\nof Venus and Adonis ; and of Atalanta and Hippomenes. This\ncompletes the tenth book.\nThe eleventh book opens with the death of Orpheus and his\nreunion with Eurydice in Elysium. It will thus be seen that\nthe tenth and eleventh books are very intimately connected by\nreason of Orpheus and Eurydice being a common subject of\neach. Now the eleventh book contains, besides the death of\nOrpheus, the story of Ceyx and Alcyone. I think, then, that\nit is clear that the references made in the trance to Orpheus\nand Eurydice, to Pygmalion and also to Hyacinthus, are reminis-\ncences of the tenth and eleventh books of the Metamorphoses,\nand not reminiscences of classical dictionaries, or of popular\ncollections of classical myths, or of Bulfinch's Age of Fable,\nor Gayley's Classic Myths ; for although in these two latter\nbooks all the stories in question are mentioned, they are not\nin any way held together by any common bond, as they\nare in the Metamorphoses, but appear disconnectedly, and\nwithout anything being said to suggest a connexion between\nthem.^\n^ In Bulfinch's Age of Fahle the stories appear in the following order:\nHyacinthus, Ch. VIII., pp. 91-93;\nPygmalion, Ch. VIII., pp. 97-99 ;\n\f118 G. Piddington. [part\nMoreover, the form of the allusions made in the trance to\nthese stories affords evidence partly of a jjositive and partly of\na negative character in favour of the hypothesis that Ovid's\ntext or a literal translation of it, and not any work of refer-\nence, was the som'ce on which Myersp drew.\nOn the positive side are the persistent references to \" lily\n\"\nin the Hyacinthus allusions. In Ovid lilies are in two different\nways associated with Hyacinthus. Thus, first:\nUt si quis violas riguove papaver in horto\nLiliaque infringat fulvis haerentia virgis,\nMarcida demittant suhito caput ilia gravatum,\nNee se sustineant, spectentque cacumine terram\nSic vultus moriens jaeet.\n[As violets or poppy in a well-watered garden, or as lilies\nclinging to their yellow stalks, that some hand beats down, of\na sudden wither, hang their burdened heads, and droop and\nearthwards gaze, so sinks the dying head (of Hyacinthus).]\nThen, secondly\nEcce cruor, qui fusus humo signaverat herham,\nDesinit esse cruor, Tyrioque nitentior ostro\nFlos oritur, formamque capit quam lilia, si nan\nPurpureus color his, Ojrgenteus esset in illis.\n[Lo ! the blood that had streamed upon the ground and stained\nthe grass is blood no longer ;\nbrighter than Tyrian purple a\nflower springs up, and takes the shape that lilies have, albeit\nits hue is purple while theirs is silver-white.]\nSecondly, the \" portmanteau \",\n\" Morpheus and Eurydice \",\nwhich occurred in the waking-stage on March 31, is, I think,\nCeyx and Alcyone, Ch. IX., pp. 100-108;\nOrpheus and Eurydice, Ch. XXIV., pp. 254:--259.\nIn Gayley's Clasnc Myths the stories appear in the following order\nHyacinthus, Ch. X., pp. 120-121.\nPygmalion, Ch. X., pp. 167-170.\nOrpheus aiid Eurydice, Ch. XII. , pp. 185-188.\nCeyx and Alcyone, Ch. XIV., pp. 194-196.\nFive other stories taken from the tenth and eleventh books of the Meta-\nmorphoses are summarised in The Age of Fable and in Classic Myths, but no\nreference to any one of them was made in the trance.\nFor the order of the stories in Ovid see foot-note on p. 131.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 119\nmore like an automatism produced by familiarity with a con-\ntext which embraces both the Orpheus and Eurydice and the\nMorpheus stories, than a confusion between two names of like\nterminations ^ ; for \" Orpheus and Eurydice \" had been articulated\nwithout difficulty the previous day, and, besides, there is no\nother sign of confusion between the Orpheus and the Morpheus\nstories. Thirdly, the details spontaneously given in the trance\nall accord with Ovid's versions.\nLastly, though occurring in a different connexion, there is a\npassage in tlie sitting of May S, 1908 (quoted on p. 114) which\nsuggests that Myersp was aware that he had been utilising\nreminiscences of Ovid in his communications; for when Mr.\nDorr mentioned Homer, Aristophanes, Horace and Ovid in con-\nnexion with various cross-correspondences, it was Ovid's name\nalone which elicited comment: \"I remember well OVID.\" And\nthis comment, made just after Mr. Dorr had spoken of the\nCyclops, came at a particularly appropriate point, because the\nCyclops is a subject of frequent recurrence in Ovid ;\nthough\nnothing said by Mr. Dorr, who, on the contrary, spoke of\nHomers Cyclops, suggested any connexion between the Cyclops\nand Ovid.\nOn the negative side, it appears that no knowledge of details\nnot contained in Ovid is spontaneously shown by MyerSp.\nThus, the first spontaneous reference to Pygmalion was to\nPygmalion only, which accords with the vex'sion in Ovid, who\ngives no name to the statue that came to life ; whereas in other\nversions of the tale, and in Gayley's book, and in some of\nthe Classical Dictionaries, her name is given as Galatea.-\nMoreover, when Mr. Dorr asked about a detail not found in\nOvid, but to be found in Bulfinch, in Gayley, and in most\nClassical Dictionaries, i.e. the name of the wind that blew\nthe quoit against Hyacinthus, \u2014no answer was given.\nI regard it, then, as established that the allusions in the\ntrance to the Cave of Sleep, etc., Orpheus and Eurydice,\nPygmalion, and Hyacinthus are reminiscences of the tenth and\n1 Cf. the significant \"portmanteau\" \" sphear \" \u2014a compound of spear and\nsphere\u2014in Mrs. Piper's script of Feb. 4, 1902 (Proc. Vol. XX. p. 215).\n-It was only when Mr. Dorr asked for an explanation of \"Pygmalion\" that\nGalatea was mentioned. See foot-note on p. 91.\n\f120 \/. G. Piddington. [part\neleventh books of Ovid's Metamorphoses. And I consider that\nthe references to Orpheus and Eurydice and to Pygmalion were\nintroduced in order to indicate the source of the allusions to\nIris, Cave of Sleep, Morpheus, Ceyx, etc., which constitute the\nanswer to the Lethe question.^\nLater on (see pp. 129-32) I shall suggest a reason why the\nOrpheus and Pygmalion stories were mentioned rather than\nany of the other stories contained in Metamorphoses X. and\nXL, to indicate the source of the answer given to the Lethe\nquestion.-\n^ I do not think that the allusions to Hyacinthus were introduced primarily\nto serve this purpose. I believe it was the question about the statue that\nevoked them. At the same time I believe they would not have been evoked,\nunless Myersp had already been set thinking of the tenth and eleventh books\nof the Metaynorphoses by the question about Lethe. Or, to put it in another\nway : if the question about Lethe only had been asked there would have been\nno reference to Hyacinthus ; and if the question about Lethe had not been asked,\nand only the question about the statue, there would equally have been no\nreference to Hyacinthus. It was the combination of questions which recalled\nthe Hyacinthus story.\n^ It may occur to the reader at this point to enquire what warrant, if any, I\nhave for grouping the references to Orpheus and Eurydice, Pygmalion, and\nindirectly those to Hyacinthus, with the references to the Ceyx and Alcyone\nstory.\nNo positive indication was given in the trance that they were to be thus\ngrouped ; but three considerations can be adduced in justification of the\nsynthesis.\nFirst, these references, though detached, emerged in close chronological\nsequence : namely, Ceyx and Alcyone on March 2,3 and 24 ; Orpheus and\nEurydice at the next sitting on March 30; \"Morpheus and Eurydice\" at the\nnext sitting on March 31 ;\nHyacinthus and Pygmalion at the next sitting on\nApril 6. That is to say, no sitting was allowed to pass without a fresh reference\nbeing made to stories contained in the same part of the Metamo7~phoses as\ncontains the story of Ceyx and Alcyone.\nSecondly, the context of each reference suggests either a connexion between\nit and the subject of Lethe, or between it and one of the other references.\nThus, after Morpheus had been mentioned on March 24, and Orpheus and\nEurydice on March 30, came the words \"Olympus, Morpheus, and Eurydice\"\non March 31. Since \"Olympus\" (though I do not know why) had, like\n\"Morpheus\", been clearly connected with the answer to the Lethe question,\nthis odd combination of the three names suggests that some link existed in the\nthoughts of the trance-personality between his answer to the Lethe question\nand the Orpheus and Eurydice story.\nAgain, the first reference to the Hyacinthus story (\"Discus hit me\") and\nthe first reference to Pygmalion were made in the same waking-stage ; and the\nlatter occurred in a context embracing three words, \" Elysian \", \" Cyx \", and\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 121\nDid Mrs. or Miss Verrall know Ovid's\nMetamorphoses X. and XL 1\nNow although neither Mrs. Piper herself nor Mr. Dorr was\nacquainted with Metamorphoses X. and XI., a considerable\nnumber of other living persons must have been ;\nand to the\nminds of an}^ one or more of them Mrs. Piper may have had\ntelepathic access. Yet so indeterminate a possibility it would\nbe unprofitable and, indeed, impracticable to discuss. But let\nus restrict the field of possible candidates for the post of\ntelepathic agent to those classical scholars, between whom and\nMrs. Piper a comparatively regular and systematic supernormal\nTOtpport is known to have been established. So far as I know,\nthe only persons whom this description would fit are Mrs. and\nMiss Verrall.^ It becomes, therefore, desirable to ascertain if\nthey possessed the requisite knowledge.\nMrs. Verrall, writing on March 19, 1909, thus describes the\nextent of her acquaintance with Ovid's works :\nThis is my reading :\nFasti, Books I. II. and III., I lectured on in 1881 to a class at\nNewnham College ; so I knew them well then.\nHeroidum Epistulae I read about 1896 with a class of children.\nNot another word have I read except under compulsion : e.g. when\npassages have been set in unprepared translation papers. And I\nread the death of Eurydice about four years ago, because my husband\nand a friend had views on Virgil's account of that, and I com-\npared it, when lecturing on the Virgil, with Ovid. But I hate Ovid\nbeyond words, and I have never read a line that I could avoid.\nMrs. Verrall, then, believes she has not read the Cave of\nSleep passage in Ovid ; and an additional I'eason for thinking\n\" Facilis \" (v. p. 106), all associated, though for different reasons, with the Lethe\nquestion.\nThirdly, the juxtaposition {v. p. 109) of \"a lily came up out of the blood\",\nand \"no poppies ever grew on Elysian shores\", suggests that the two subjects\nto which these phrases relate were associated in some way in the thoughts of\nthe trance-personality.\n^ Since Mrs. Piper appears to have occasionally acquired information tele-\npathically from me, it should be stated that my first acquaintance with the\ntenth and eleventh books of the Metamorphoses dates from a good many months\nafter the conclusion of Mr. Dorr's sittings.\n\f122 J. G. Piddington. [PAET\nthat she had no acquaintance with it is furnished by the fact\nthat when she went over the records of Mr. Dorr's sittings,\nwith tlie special object of elucidating obscure points in the\nclassical allusions, she failed to make head or tail of the refer-\nences to the Cave of Sleep, Iris, Morpheus, etc.\nMiss Verrall, writing on April 12, 1909, gives the following\naccount of her knowledsje of Ovid :\nGenerally speaking, I am not at all familiar with the works of\nOvid. As a child I read school texts containing selections from the\nFasti and Meturiiorplioses. I have also read the Heroidmn Epistulae\nand some parts of the Tristia.\nThe book of selections from the Metamorphuses contained nothing\nfrom Books X. and XL, except Book XL, 11. 89-192.1 I am almost\ncertain that I have never read any other part of these books unless\nit were some passage set for unseen translation.\nThough it is possible that Mrs. Verrall or Miss Verrall may\nhave come across the Cave of Sleep passage in an unseen\ntranslation paper, it is not likely ; for when I drew their atten-\ntion to it, it was new to both of them, and neither was aware\nthat any writer\u2014ancient, medieval or modern\u2014had ever located\nthe source of the river of Lethe in the Cave of Sleep. This\npiece of mythological topography is, I believe, peculiar to Ovid,\nand is not reproduced in any of the classical dictionaries which\nI have consulted.^ And in this connexion I may as well add\nthat Ovid's description of the Cave of Sleep is not one of\nthose hackneyed passages familiar to all classical scholars.\nMoreover, even if we were to assume, notwithstanding Mrs.\nand Miss Verrall's statements, that one or both of them had\nknown the Ceyx and Alcyone story, and that from their minds\nit passed telepathically into Mrs. Pijjei-'s, this would still leave\nMrs. Piper's knowledge of the Pygmalion and the Hyacinthus\nstories unexplained ; and it is surely hardly credible that Mrs.\nor Miss VeiTall can at one time have read all these three\nOvidian stories and since forgotten having done so.\n^ The stories told in this passage, viz. how Bacchus granted Midas the power\nof turning everything he touched into gold, and of how a pair of ass's ears\nwas bestowed on Midas as a punishment for his having preferred Pan's pipes to\nApollo's lyre, have no connexion with the Ceyx and Alcyone story.\n\"It is mentioned incidentally in Bulfiuch and in Gayley ; and I am informed\nthat it is given in Roscher's new and unfinished German Lexicon.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings : Lethe. 123\nIt does not, then, seem likely that Mrs. Piper can have drawn\nthe knowledge shown in her trance from either Mrs. or Miss\nVerrall.\nDiscussion of the part played by MyerSp in this Case.\nSo far I have looked for the source of the answer given\nto the Lethe question in the minds of the living. The pro-\nfessed source, however, is the mind of a dead man, Frederic\nMyers. From this source for some years past there have pur-\nported to come series of communications through Mrs. Verrall\nand Mrs. Holland, as well as through Mrs. Pipei-. There has\nbeen a considei-able amount of coincidence in the content and\ncharacter of these three seiies of communications ; but if they\nreally are in some degree the product of one and the same\nmind, we might reasonably expect them to show similarity or\nidentity of content or character and of method and manner of\npresentment as well.\nI pi'opose, then, next to discuss whether the method by\nwhich MyerSp answered the Lethe question is marked by any\nfeature distinctive of the communications of Myersy and Myersy.^\nIn connexion with the Lethe question Myersp mentioned\ncertain disjointed words, names, or phrases, which in their dis-\niointed state conveyed no intelligible answer. Nor was a.i\\y\nintelligible answer deducible from them until two literarv\npassages\u2014J. erieicZ VI. 703-723, and Metamorphoses X. and XI.\n\u2014were discovered, wherein these verbal fragments are incor-\nporate, and whereby they can be blended into coherent unity.\nNow, since the phenomena of Myersp, Myersy and Myers^,\nclaim to emanate from one and the same source, it was appro-\npriate that Myersp sliould convey his meaning by this method ;\nfor the same method had been four times employed already\nin communications, which, though unsigned, thei'e is good\nreason for assigning in two cases to Myersy and in two to\nMyersjj. If a second example of the same method being used\n^ If an affirmative answer can be given to this question, it will afford an\nadditional reason for thinking that the knowledge of the Metamorphoses\nmanifested in the trance was not derived from Mrs. Piper's memories, but\nreached her mind in some supernormal manner.\n\f124 J. G. Piddington. [part\nby Myersp, described on pp. 144-50, is included, it makes six\ninstances in all ; and in all six instances this distinctive device\nis probably to be attributed to a \" Myers \" control.\nAnd let it not be supposed that the three automatists con-\ncerned, Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland, and Mrs. Piper, borrowed this\nplan of code-signalling literary passages from each other,\nat least in any normal manner. On the contrary, each\ngave an example of it in her phenomena without having\nseen or been informed of the parallel examples elsewhere.\nMoreover, none of the automatists suspected that any such\ncryptic device was in operation ; it being in each case left,\nas was the scheme of complex cross-correspondences,' for a\nstudent of the phenomena to discover. Besides which, the\nautomatist did not, except in one of the six instances, con-\nsciously know that an allusion had been made in her script\nto a literary context.\nThe meaning of these ratlier obscure abstract statements will\nbecome clear when read in the light of the concrete facts on\nwhich they are based.\nThe first instance occurred in Mrs. Verrall's script of March\n25, 1907 {v. Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 252 et seq.) in connexion\nwith the word claviger. The discoveiy that this word is used\nin Ovid, Fasti I. in two different senses and connexions, gave\na clue to the meaning of the script as referring to Janus, and\nalso threw light on a script of Mrs. Holland's, that of April 8,\n1907, and on an utterance in Mrs. Piper's trance of the same\ndate {id. ib. pp. 253-7, 265-9, 271-2).\nThe second instance occurred in Mrs. Holland's script of\nApril 8, 1907, which refers to Martha and Mary and Leah and\nRachel {id,, ih. pp. 265-8). Here, when the literary source\nof this part of the script was discovered, its context was\nfound to embrace various topics which were being indepen-\ndently mentioned about this time in Mrs. Piper's trance and in\nMrs. Verrall's script.\nThe third iustance is furnished b}' Mrs. Verrall's script of\nApril 8, 1907 {id. ih. p. 271), which contains a quotation from\nTennyson's Maud. This quotation formed a simple cross-\ncorrespondence with Mrs. Holland's script of March 27, 1907\ni.See Proc. Vol. XXI. p. .377.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings : Lethe. 125\n{id. ib. p. 261), inasmuch as the latter also contained a quota-\ntion \u2014though not the same quotation\u2014from Maud ; but between\nthe unquoted context of Mrs. Verrall's quotation and the theme\nof another script of Mrs. Holland's (that of April 8, 1907, just\nmentioned) which was illustrated by allusions to passages in\nDante's Convito and Purgatorio, a far more striking cross-\ncorrespondence was involved :\n\u2014more striking, because the sub-\nject of it, the identification of opposites, being far more removed\nfrom the commonplace is less likely to appear about the same\ntime in two different scripts than are different quotations from\na well-known poem, and less likely still to appear in two\ndifferent scripts of the same date.\nThe fourth instance, Mrs. Holland's reference to Browning's\nAristophanes' Apology in her script of April 16, 1907 {id. ib.,\np. 215), has already been described in detail in my Supple-\nmentary Notes above, p. 25.\nThe fifth instance is the one under discussion, where, by\ntracing to their literary source various disjointed words and\nphrases connected in Mrs. Piper's trance with the Lethe ques-\ntion, we have been enabled to make sense out of what at\nfirst sight appeared to be nonsense.\nIn the sixth instance, described in detail below on pp. 144-50,\nthe discovery that the two names Icarus and Anchises mentioned\ntogether in Mrs. Piper's trance are both embedded in a passage\nin the sixth book of the Aeneid led to the further discovery\nthat fi^om this particular passage an apt answer could be\nsupplied to a question put to Myersp by Mr. Dorr.\nMyersp, Myersy, and Myers^, all three, then, adopted the\nsame distinctive method. I speak of it as a \"method\", because\nI believe it to be due to design ; but if objection be taken to\nthe term, \" feature \" can be used instead. I call it \" distinctive \",\nbecause I believe it to be peculiar to these three manifestations\nof a \" Myers \" control, or at any rate to the group of \"spirits\"\nassociated with it.^\n^ I may remark in passing that it was quite appropriate for Myersp, who had\na year before spontaneously introduced the subject of \"halcyon days\" (see\nProc. Vol. XXII. pp. 10.3-7, 110, 112, 131, 140 and 163), to display in his\nanswer to the Lethe question acquaintance with a passage in classical literature\nwhere the origin of halcyon days is told.\n\f126 \/. G. Piddington. [part\nSo far we have dealt with these references to literary\npassages only as evidence for the employment of a common\nmethod by Myersp, Myersy and Myersu. But let us now shift\nour point of view, and consider whether behind these passages,\nselected primarily, no doubt, because of their immediate relev-\nance to the subject-matter of the communications to wliich they\nbelong, there may not lurk an ulterior or secondary significance.\nIf A, B and C, whose circumstances, education, mental\nendowments and pursuits are dissimilar, were independently\nof each other set the task of illustrating different topics or\nanswering different questions by means of allusions to literary\npassages, in all probability the literary sources of the passages\nselected would be too wide and too promiscuous to be covered\nby the knowledge of any single one of the three. Similarly,\nif, instead of relying on their own literary taste and know-\nledge, all alike employed a fourth party, X, to do their tasks\nfor them, though certain passages selected by X might happen\nto be known to one or two or all three of them, no single one of\nthem probably would know all X.'s passages. Moreover, on the\nassumption that X selected the passages without reference to the\nindividual literary attainments of A, B and C, it would be just\nas likely that some of the passages which, e.g., A might not\nknow, should occur in the set selected for him by X, as in either\nB's or C's set. Obviously, however, all the passages in all tliree\nsets would be within tlie range of X's reading, and would\nprobably be to some extent symptomatic not only of his in-\ntellectual but of his emotional bent.^\nThe phenomena of our three automatists present an analogous\ncase. In each instance a topic has been illustrated or a ques-\ntion answered in their scripts or trance-speech by means of\nallusions to passages in literature ; and in each instance not\nthe automatist herself but a fourth party, Frederic Mj^ers, is\nrepresented as responsible for the selections.\nLet us see if the result in this actual case accords with what I\nhave assumed to be the probable result in my imaginary case.\n1\nIf among my readers are any schoolmasters who have been led to suspect\nthat behind the Latin Prose or Verse of their pupils, A, B and C, lurks a\ncommon author X, the line of argument which I am here pursuing ought to\nappeal to them.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings : Lethe. 127\nFor convenience of reference I tabulate the passages.\nNo. of ^. ^ , .\n, Literary Passage.

G. Piddington. [part\nA Comparison of MyerSp with F. W. H. Myers.\nThe question now arises whether in the answer given by\nMyerSp to the Lethe question there was anything appropriate\nto the personality whom Myersp claims to be.\nWe may first consider whether all the passages just\nreferred to were known to Frederic Myers. The Tennyson\nand the Vergil passages certainly were ; and it is scarcely\nnecessary to state that a man whose knowledge of Dante\ncan have been surpassed by few of his English contemporaries,\nexcepting professed Dante scholars, knew the closing cantos\nof the Pttrgatorio ; but if any reader desires proof I would\nrefer him to Esmys Classical, pp. 173-176, and to the motto\nof The Implicit Promise of Immortality in The Renewal of\nYouth, p. 46.\nI can produce no such definite evidence that Frederic\nMyers knew Aristophanes A^oology ; but that he was familiar\nwith Bi'owning's poems is established by two passages in his\nwritings, Science and a Future life, pp. 163, and 167-8; and\nin view of this fact, and of the further facts that he was a\npersonal friend of Browning's, and was deeply interested in\nclassical subjects, the presumption that he was acquainted with\nAristophanes Apology is very strong.\nNeither in regard to the particular passages from Ovid's\nOvid's Metamorphoses, thougli she had heard of it; and that \"years ago\" she\n\" scampered through a translation of the Aeneid'\", but has no recollection of the\nsixth book. For the evidence as to Mrs. Holland's ignorance of the Purgatorio\nand Convito passages and of Aristophanes' Apology see pp. 24 and 25.\nFor Mrs. Piper's ignorance of Aristophanes^ Apology see Proc. Vol. XXII.\npp. 41.5-16 ; and in a letter addressed to me on June 26, 1909, she categorically\nstates that she has never read it. In the same letter she writes :\n\" I know-\nnothing about Dante nor anything he wrote, and very little more about\nBrowning.\" As regards the Aeiieid she writes on August 7, 1909, as follows :\n\"I have never read Vergil's Aeneid. I could not read it if I wished.\nAlta [her daughter] says it is written in Latin, and I could not read Latin\npossibly. I do not undei-stand or read Latin, have never seen a translation,\nand am not in the least familiar with it.\" For Mrs. Piper's ignorance of\nOvid see pp. 138-41. Mr. Dorr, moreover, satisfied himself by personal enquiries\nthat Mrs. Piper's knowledge of the Classics is practically nil.\nIncidentally it may be noted that the automatist whose knowledge included\nthe greatest number of the passages was the one whose education, pursuits\nand interests resembled the most closely those of Frederic Myers.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 129\nFasti and Metamorphoses, can I produce definite evidence that\nFrederic Myers was familiar with them ; but the following\nextract from the autobiographical part of Fragments of Prose\nand Poetry (p. 17) is evidence of his familiarity with Ovid's\nworks generally :\nThat early burst of admiration for Virgil of which I have already\nspoken was followed by a growing passion for one after another of\nthe Greek and Latin poets. From ten to sixteen I lived much in\nthe inward recital of Homer, Aeschylus, Lucretius, Horace, and Ovid.\nMyers, who was singularly modest concerning his literary\nattainments, would not have so expressed himself, had he not\nmeant to imply that his knowledge of Ovid was out of the\ncommon.\nYet even if it be granted that all the passages had actually\nbeen within Myers's knowledge, that fact alone, though\nstriking, leaves something to be desired ; for coming as they all\ndo from classics, ancient or modern, collectively or singly they\nmust be within the knowledge of many living persons ; and so\nit is possible that the automatist might have derived them\ntelepathically from one or more of these persons. The case\nwould therefore gain in impressiveness if traces could be\ndetected in the choice of the passages, or in the coroments\nthat accompanied them, of some bias characteristic of Myers's\nmind or temperament.\nSuch traces I believe to exist ; and I will do my best to bring\nthem out, after first warning the reader not to expect all the\npassages to be significant or to be equally significant, for pro-\nbably the predominant factor determining the choice of them\nwas a desire to allude to contexts relevant to the immediate\nsubject of the communications.\nIn the first place, all the authors from whose works the passages\ncome \u2014Ovid, Dante, Tennyson, Vergil, and Browning \u2014were,\nwith the possible exception of the last, the objects of Myers's\nspecial admiration or aff'ection ; and two of them\u2014-Vergil and\nTennyson\u2014of his veneration also.\nIn the second place, three out of the four stories told in\nMetamorphoses X. and XI. to which Myersp alluded, are the\nsubject of allusions in three consecutive stanzas of one of\nI\n\f130 J. G. Piddington. [part\nFrederic Myers's poems; and the order in which the allusions\nemerge in the trance and in the poem is the same.\nThe allusions in question were to Iris, Orpheus and. Eurydice,\nand Pygmalion. They emerged\u2014and emerged spontaneously\nin that order in the trance : Iris on March 23 and 24, Orpheus\nand Eurydice on March 30, and Pygmalion on April 6.\nThe subject of the third stanza of Frederic Myers's Stanzas\non Mr. Watts Collected Works^ is the picture entitled The\nGenius of Greek Poetry, with its \" rainbow forms that span the\nsky \"\n; the subject of the fourth stanza is the picture entitled.\nOrpheus andj Eurydice; the subject of the fifth stanza is the\npicture entitled The Wife of Pygmalion.\nIt is true that the direct reference in the third stanza is\nto The Genius of Greek Poetry ; but there is as well, I think,\nan implicit collateral allusion to Watts' Pris. To make this\nclear I will quote the first four lines of the third stanza\nYet oftenest in the past he walked,\nWith god or hero long gone by,\nOft, like his pictured Genius, talked\nWitli rainbow forms that span the sky.\nIn The Genius of Greek Poetry a symbolical human figure is\ngazing at the forces and phenomena of Nature as they pass\nembodied in God-like forms before his eyes. B}' far the most\nprominent of these forms is a rainbow which stretches nearly\nacross the whole picture. A classical scholar looking at this\npicture and knowing its title could hardly fail to be reminded of\nIris, the rainbow goddess, by the \" rainbow-form \" ; and if, like\nFrederic Myers, this scholar were at the same time an enthusi-\nastic connoisseur of Watts' work, he would almost inevitably\nbe reminded of his Iris. I think, therefore, that in Frederic\nMyers's mind the goddess Iris and Watts' picture Iris were\nassociated with Tlie Genius of Greek Poetry ; and this pro-\nbability is heightened by the words in the third stanza\nOft, like his pictured Genius, talked\nWith rainbow forms that span the sky.\nBesides the broader meaning which they bear, these two lines\nmean, I take it, that Watts dealt not once onl}^ in The Genius of\n'See Frafiments of Prose and Poetry, p. 190.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 131\nGreek Poetry, but in others of his paintings too, e.g. in his\nIris and JJldra, with the subject of the rainbow. Granted the\ncorrectness of this interpretation, we get, then, in successive\nstanzas of Myers's poem an implicit allusion to Iris, a reference\nto Orpheus and Eurydice, and a reference to Pygmalion.\nThe order in which these three subjects emerge in the poem\nand in the trance is not the order in which they emerge in\nOvid's Metamorphoses ;\n(nor, it may be added incidentally^ in\nwhich they ai\"e to be found in Gayley's Classic Myths or in\nBulfinch's Age of Fable). If it had been, the natural inference\nwould have been that Myersp and Frederic Myers alike (and\nBulfinch and Gayley likewise) had simply followed Ovid's\norder. If any significance attaches to the coincidence, it lies in\nthe fact that the order adopted in the trance agrees not with\nOvid's arrangement 1 but with that adopted in Frederic Myers's\npoem.\nBut since, ex hypothesi, the Iris story was necessarily men-\ntioned first in order in the trance, and since there were con-\nsequently only two possible orders in which the other two\nstories could follow it, the coincidence in the order of arrange-\nment is by itself not worth attention. It becomes noteworthy\nonly because it supplements the coincidence in the choice of\nsubjects : of which chance will hardly seem a satisfactory\nexplanation when the large number of different combinations of\nthree stories tvhich might have been formed from the tivo\nbooks of the \" Metamorphoses \" is taken into account.\nI do not believe that it is the kind of coincidence which\nMrs. Piper could consciously or subconsciously have concocted ;\nfor, even if she had read the poem (which she had not-),\n^ The references to Iris, Orpheus and Eurydice, and Pygmalion occur in the\nfollowing order in the 3Ietamorphoies :\n\u2014\nDeath of Eurydice and Orpheus' descent iuto the Underworld, Mel.

Since\nthen I have not even thought of it, and he too must have forgotten it, as he\nhas never mentioned it to me.\" It was the references to it in Proc. Vol.\nXXII. (see pp. 109-110) which made Mrs. Piper wish to read Fragments.\n\f132 J. G. Piddington. [part\nI do not believe that she possesses the classical scholar-\nship requisite to detect the indii'ect allusion implicit in the\nthird stanza to Iris, or the allusions to Orpheus and Eurydice\nin the fourth, and to Pygmalion in the fifth. ^ Meanwhile,\nit is precisely the kind of delicate coincidence which might\nbe expected to occur, if the communications of Myersp are\ninfluenced by the mind of the author of Stanzas on Mr.\nWatts Collected Works.\nA critic might here remark :\n\" But how about the allusion\nto the Hyaciuthus stoiy ? Y(ju seem to have overlooked the\nfact that in spite of this being one of the stories contained\nin Metamorp]Loses X. and XI. to which Myersp referred, there\nis no reference to it in the poem on Watts' pictures. Had\nMyersp referred to Iris, Orpheus and Eurj^dice, and Pygmalion\nonly,l grant the coincidence would have been striking; but he\nleferied to the Hyaciuthus story too, and that just spoils the\ncoincidence.\"\nIf it had proved to be the case that the Hyaciuthus story\nwas dragged in merely for the same purpose as the Orpheus and\nEurydice and Pygmalion stories \u2014namely, to serve as a clue\nto the source of the allusions to Iris, Cave of Sleep, Morpheus,\netc.\u2014this criticism would liave considerable force ;\nbut, as\npreviously explained (v. pj). 117-20), the Hyaciuthus story was\nintroduced, and effectively introduced, to serve a quite distinct\npurpose.\nIncidentally I would call attention to the fact that neither\nOvid, Watts nor Fredeiic Myers gave a name to the wife of\nPygmalion ; and that Myersp first mentioned Pygmalion only,\nand did not mention Galatea until asked to explain \" Pygmalion\n\"\nby Mr. Dorr, who evident!}' thought that Myersp was merely\nfirino- off classical reminiscences at random and without\nmethod. If, as I have suggested, MyerSp was thinking of Ovid's\nMetamorphoses, of Watts' picture, and of Frederic Myers's\nstanzas on Watts' pictures, it is intelligible why, in the first\nspontaneous reference, Pygmalion only was named.\nIn the third place, it was appropriate to represent Frederic\n'\nIn the poem neither Eurydice nor Pygmalion is named ; and Orpheus is\ncalled \"The Thracian\" simply.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 133\nMyers as remembering and utilising in his communications the\nstories of Ceyx and Alcyone and of Orpheus and Eurydice.\nThe theme of both stories is ad jinem servatos amores and\nthe happy reunion of two lovers, \" after long grief and pain\nin another state of existence; and, as must be apparent to any\ncareful reader of Myers's poems, this was a theme very near\nindeed to his heart; and the Orpheus and Eurydice story\nhad evidently taken great hold upon him.^\nMoreover, any one familiar with Myers's writings will recognise\nthat passages in classical literature which concern some inci-\ndent of a mystic or \"supernormal\" kind had a special attraction\nfor him. I do not base this statement on the frequency of\nreferences to such passages to be found in places whei'e they\nwould be expected, that is to say, in writings directly dealing\nwith \"psychical research,\" but upon the frequency with which\nthey occur in his articles on classical and general subjects. An\nincident of a supernormal kind, Alcyone's \"veridical\" vision of\nher husband's death, enters into Ovid's story; and the story of\nOrpheus and Eurydice is full of mysticism. It was, then, I\nsay, appropriate that Frederic Myers should be represented as\nremembering these two myths and utilising them in his\ncommunications.\n\" No Poppies ever grew on Elysian Shores.\"\nIn conclusion, I propose to discuss a phrase uttered in the\nwaking-stage of April 7, 1008, because, if it can really bear\nthe meanings I read into it, it cannot have been coined\nin the mint of Mi-s.

In Metamorphoses XL\nthe river of Lethe issues from the Cave of Sleep near the\nCimmerians' land, and before the Cave grow poppies; whereas in\nAeneid. VI. the river of Lethe flows by the Elysian fields, and,\nthough the scenery of the river is described, no mention is\nmade of poppies\u2014an omission the more noticeable because in\nthe Georgics (TV. 545) Vergil applies the epithet \" Lethean \" to\npoppies. No matter whether this omission was intentional on\nVergil's part or not, it is exactly the kind of omission which a\nVergilian scholar with mystic leanings and interested in\nsymbolism might seize upon.\nWhatever the reader may think of this interpretation, he\nwill, I hope, at least admit that the phrase implies knowledge\nof the fact that both Elysium and poppies have been asso-\nciated with Lethe ; for what else, unless it were knowledge\nthat poppies were a Lethean flower and that according to one\nvei'sion of the story Lethe was an Elysian river, could have\nprovoked the comment that \" no poppies ever grew on Elysian\nshores \"\nThere remains a small point to which I would draw the\nattention of those readers only whose interest goes beyond the\npurely \" evidential \" side of the phenomena.\nInto the four stories\u2014Lethe, Orpheus and Eurydice,\nPygmalion, and Hyacinthus\u2014mentioned by Myersp, poppies or\nlilies, or poppies and, lilies, enter in one way or another.\nFor the connexion of poppies with Lethe see Ovid, 3Iet. XL\n605 and Vergil, Georg. IV. 544.\nFor an indirect connexion of lilies with Lethe see Verofil,\nAeneid VI. 708-9, where the souls that crowd about its banks\nare compared to bees swarming round white lilies.\nFor the connexion of poppies with the Orpheus and Eury-\ndice story see A^ergil, Georg. IV. 544, where Aristaeus is told\nto ofl'er Lethean poppies to Orpheus to placate his wrath.\nFor the connexion of lilies with Orpheus and Eurydice see\nthe Orpheus and Eurydice of G. F. Watts (18G9), in which a\nlily lies at the feet of the swooning Eurydice.\n\f136 J. G. Piddington. [part\nFor the connexion of lilies with the Pygmalion story, see\nOvid, Met. X. 262, where Pygmalion makes gifts of lilies to\nthe marble statue ; and Watts' picture, Tli,e Wife of PygmaUoUy\nin which lilies are introduced as symbols of her purity.\nFor the connexion of lilies and poppies with Hyacinthus,\nsee Ovid, Met. X. 190-1 and 212 (quoted on p. 118).\nI am not for a moment suggesting that Myersp intended to\nbring out in his communications the odd fact of the intrusion\nof poppies and lilies into all these stories. Nor do I contend\nthat he was even conscious that the coincidences existed,\nalthough the juxtaposition of allusions in successive utterances\nto the lily that grew out of the blood, and to the poppies\nthat never grew on Elysian shores, rather suggests that he\nmay have been. But I do put forward the conjecture that the\nlilies and poppies were one of the associations which led him un-\nconsciously to group these four particular stories, rather than\nany others, from the tenth and eleventh books of the Metamor-\nphoses. At the same time I readily admit that poppies and lilies\nare so regular a part of the Roman poet's floral stock-in-trade\nthat chance is, perhaps, a sufficient explanation of the coinci-\ndences ; which it could hardly be, had i-arer flowers been the\nsubject of them.\nNote A.\nLetters read at the sitting of March 23, 1908. (See p. 86.)\nThese five letters were as follows: (1) A letter addressed to\nMr. Dorr by Sir Oliver Lodge, enclosing (2) a letter addressed\nto Sir Oliver Lodge by myself; (3) a letter addressed by me\nto Mr. Dorr ; (4) a letter addressed to Mr. Dorr by Miss Alice\nJohnson ; and (5) a letter addressed b}^ me to Hodgsoup.\nThere was nothing in (1) or (2) that need concern us here ;\nthat\nis to say, neither conveyed information which affected the\nevidential value of anything written or spoken in the trance\nsubsequently. In (4) Miss Johnson explained that it was difficult\nto reply definitely and promptly whether cross-correspondences\nhad been successful or not until there had been time to study\ncarefully Mrs. and Miss Verrall's and Mrs. Holland's scripts, as\nthe corresponding messages in these scripts sometimes came\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings : Lethe. 137\nout in very allusive fashion ; and she quoted as an illustration\nthe case of \" Giant and Dwarf \" (see Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 87-94).\nIn my letter to Mr. Dorr I asked him to send all records to\nMiss Johnson instead of to me, and to read a letter, which I\nenclosed, to the Hodg-son control. This letter I must quote, as\nit convej^ed both to Mr. Dorr and to the trance-personalities\ninformation, which they had not possessed before, of some of\nthe results of the English series of sittings in 1906-1907. The\nobject of the letter was to pacify Hodgsoup, who was im-\npatiently demanding to be told whether cross-correspondences\nwhich he and MyerSp had been trying had succeeded or not.\nDorr has told me what you have been saying lately about\ncross-correspondences. We will do our best to let you know\nwhen your experiments succeed, with as little delay as possible.\nBut I do not think you realise in the least the difficulties of\ncollating the various scripts. To do this takes a long time and\nmuch careful study. What is said or written through this\nLight (Mrs. Piper) is plain and straightforward ; but what Mrs.\nVerrall, Miss Verrall, and especially Mrs. Holland, write is\nnearly always of an exceedingly cryptic character, and only hy\nprolonged and patient study can the meaning be extracted.\nLet me give you an example : It is only a few days ago that I\nhave at last traced a positively amazing series of cross-corre-\nsponding messages between this Light, Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\nHolland. It has taken nearly a year to discover it. This was\na series of corresponding messages worked by you and Myers,\nand I think Sidgwick also, on the subject of the identification\nof opposites\u2014a subject connected with the ai'Tos oi'pai'us a\/ci'\/xaji-\nbusiness. The v\/hole thing is now perfectlj' plain, ^ and you\nhave scored an immense success. But if you had asked me\neven a few weeks ago if \"Light in West,\" \"Dante's Inferno,'\"'\n\"Aphrodite,\" \"I wander lonely as a Cloud,\" and \"Daffodils\"\n{i.e. some of the messages given through this Light which\nformed part of this series) had been successfully reproduced by\nthe other Lights I should have said \"No\" imhesitatingly\nwhereas now I see that they uvre reproduced, though in an\n^ The general scheme was plain to me at the time, but various points included\nin my published account of the incident\u2014among others the connexion of\nJanus and Prometheus, and the meaning of the names Leopold, Silvia, and\nHarold \u2014I had not grasped at tlie time when this letter was written.\n\f138 J. G. Piddington. [part\nexceedingly allusive fashion. The allusiveness of which I speak\nis, I imagine, partly the result of your own intentions, but it\nis also, I am sure, partly the result of the action of the Lights'\nown minds.\nSometimes a cross-correspondence is quite easy to trace straight\noff, e.g. \" Laurel wreath \" ; but this is rare. Most of the best\nones are traceable only after long study. So I a.sk you to\nwork on with both faith and patience. Be assured that every\nsingle word that comes from you or Myers or the others will\nreceive our attention. Bear in mind, too, that Mrs. Holland,\nthrough whom you have succeeded in sending some of the very\nbest things, lives at a great distance from us, as does this\nLight [i.e. Mrs. Piper] also ; and all this causes much delay.\nWhatever you do, do not be discouraged ;\nyou have suc-\nceeded far beyond our hopes.

The I'ccord was made at the interview, and the ques-\ntions were asked exactly as noted. At the time when Mr.\nDorr interrogated Mrs. Piper he did not know my reasons\nfor having these questions asked, and at my suggestion he put\nthem in such a way as to convey the impression that they had\nreference to subjects which had been mentioned not at his own\nsittings but at the sittings held in England in 1906-07.\nG.

No, I have never read any. 1 don't know who Ovid is ;\nthe name says nothing to me.\nTwo days later, on March 31, 1909, Mr. Dorr wrote:\u2014\nMrs. Pipei' has just written me, regarding your question\nabout Iris, that she does recall a picture of some sort\nonce given her\u2014a print or something of the kind\ncalled \" Iris the Cupbearer.\" She wanted me to tell you\nthis.\nThe following extract from a letter addressed to me by Mr.\nDorr, on May 22, 1909, may be suitably appended :\nLast spring, when these writings were going on, I went over\nthe subject of books, without telling them what^ I wanted\notherwise than generally, with both Mrs. Piper and her\ndaughters ; and I made sure then they had no books\nbearing on [classical subjects] in their apartment, and\nthat Mrs. Piper had read none, so far as her own state-\nment is to be relied upon. And apart from this, the\ninherent improbability of her past reading having fur-\nnished her with memories enabling her trance-consciousness\nto construct what came in the sittings seems to me con-\nclusive in the matter ; and would seem so, I think, to any\none out here [i.e. in the United States] familiar with the\nlittle interest in or knowledge of such subjects that\nexists among folks here.\nOf course, neither this nor any search at [Mrs. Piper's]\napartment, nor any statement made [by Mi's. Piper],\nwould have any convincing weight in a discussion of the\nquestion of possible deliberate deception. But this could\nnot have taken place unless the trance-state and the normal\nstate supplied each other luith memories and material mutually:\nthat is, unless our whole conception of the depth and\noenuineness of the trance-condition has been erroneous,\nand unless Mrs. Pipei', and her daughters too (almost of\nnecessity), have carried out a wonderful piece of deception,\ntaking us all in like children from Myers and Hodgson\non.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings : Ltthe. 141\nAnd again :\nWith regard to Mrs. Piper's past memories being the source,\nshe affirms most stronglj', and her daughters bear her\nout in it as strongly too, that she has never read along\nthese [i.e. classical] lines at all, and has no slightest know-\nledge of the subject. This I am almost certain must be\nso, too, from the improbability of it \u2014a point which I\ncan better appreciate, as an American, than you in\nEngland. People do not read these things out here.\nDorr's ignorance of Ovid. (See x>.\n102.)\nWriting on March 8, 1909, I put the following questions to\nMr. Dorr, without explaining my reasons for doing so :\n(a) Have you read much oi- any Ovid 1\n(6) If you have read any, with which of his works are\nyou most familiar ?\n(c) Have you read Ovid in a translation ; or have you\never read any collection of classical or mythological\ntales, which you think may have been taken from\nOvid ?\nMr. Dorr's reply, which he wi'ote owt before interviewing\nMrs. Piper on March 29, 1909, was as follows :\n\u2014\nI have never read any Ovid at all, as it happens, unless\nit were last spring in looking up the references in\nthe sittings after tlwj had come. Ovid was not used\nin the school courses here when I was a boy, and I\nread but little Latin at the University\u2014Livy, Cicero,\nand Plautus mainly, and a few odes of Horace. The\nonly collections of Greek mythological tales which I read\nas a boy were those contained in Thomas Bulfinch's\nbook for children and Kingsley's Heroes. The Heroes was\nread to me when I was a very young child ; the\nTheseus story in them is the one that I recall the best\nand that made the strongest impression on me at the\ntime. The Bulfinch tales I read somewhat later, though\nstill when a young boy; but they never interested me\nas did his Age of Ckivalrij and Legends of Charlemagne,\n\f142 J. G. Piddington. [part\nand I doubt if I ever could have repeated much from\nthem. Of Ovid as Ovid I know really nothing at first\nhand.\nOn learning that the Cave of Sleep story was contained in\nBulfinch's Age of Fable, Mr. Dorr obtained a copy of the book,\nand after looking it through, wrote me as follows:\nThe book seems little familiar in its stories to me now, \u2014\nunlike other books that interested me more when I was\na child, and whose every incident still comes back to me\nas I turn the pages over. The one part of it that I\nremember well is the Norse stories at the end. I doubt\nmy ever having read the others wholly through, for\nmuch seems new to me.\nNote C.\nMrs. Piper's ignorance of Bulfinch's and Gayley's hooks.\n(See p. 104.)\nThe statements reproduced in Note B satisfied me that neither\nMr. Dorr nor Mrs. Piper was acquainted with Ovid. As, how-\never, the Ovidian version of the story of Ceyx and Alcyone is\noutlined in Bulfinch'a Age of Fable and Gayley's Classic Myths,\nit was obviously desirable to enquire whether Mrs. Piper\npossessed a copy of, or had at any time read, either of these\nbooks. Accordingly, Mr. Dorr, acting on ray suggestion, called\nupon Mrs. Piper, and, before mentioning either book, asked her\npermission to go through all the books at her flat. This per-\nmission Mrs. Piper most kindly gave ; and Mr. Dorr there and\nthen made a thorough search. He found no copy of Bulfinch\nor Gayley, nor did he find any book even i-emotely bearing on\nclassical myths. He then asked Mrs. Piper if she had ever read\neither the Age of Fable or Classic Myths, and received in reply\nan emphatic negative, Mrs. Piper at the same time assuring\nhim that she had never even heard of either. Her daughters,\nAlta and Minerva, had both heard of the Age of Fable. The\nformer had occasionally consulted it at school, but she had\nnever possessed a copy of her own, and she had never brought\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: Lethe. 143\nhome the school copy, which it was forbidden to remove\nfrom the school. Neither Mrs. Piper, nor her daughters, nor\nMr. Dorr had ever heard of Gayley's modernised edition of the\nAge of Fable.\nThese statements of Mrs. Piper's to the effect that she had\nnot read any Ovid, and was not acquainted with Bulfiuch's\nand Gayley's books, carry great weight with me, who from my\npersonal intercourse with her have acquired confidence in her\nintegrity and scrupulous candour; and I believe they will carry\nequal weight with all who know her. Personal impressions\nof this kind cannot, however, be expected to carry much weight\nwith people not acquainted with Mis. Piper. They may be\nmore impressed by the fact that, in the course of the long\nperiod \u2014extending now over nearly a quarter of a centuiy\nduring which Mrs. Piper has been under the scrutiny of experi-\nenced observers, no slur has ever been cast on her veracity.\nI say \"veracity\" advisedly, for it seems to me that this is\nmore probably a question of veracity than of accuracy of\nmemory. Had the references in the trance been to the Ceyx\nand Alcyone story as told in Metamorphoses XI. only, I could\nhave believed that Mrs. Piper, straying at some time or other out-\nside her ordinary range of reading, had lighted on and cursorily\nglanced through this particular story, and since lost all con-\nscious recollection of it. But the references in the trance do not\nstop at the Ceyx and Alcyone story. They extend to three\nother stories contained in the same or in the preceding book\nof the Metamorphoses, where, however, they do not follow one\nanother consecutively, but are separated from each other by\nother stories intercalated between them. So I cannot think\nthat a casual glance through Metamorphoses X. and XL could\nhave supplied even the subconsciousness, still less the subcon-\nsciousness of a non-classical reader, with such systematised\nmemories as those apparently exhibited in the trance. If, then,\nMrs. Piper ever did read the tenth and eleventh books of the\nMetamorphoses, I think she must have read them with too\nmuch attention to have allowed her to forget that she had\ndone so.^\n^ Mrs. Piper tells me she has an excellent memory, and her daughters bear\nout her statement.\n\f144 J. G. Piddington. [part\nMoreover, it must not be lost sio-ht of that the knowledo-e\nof Ovid's Metamorphoses manifested in the trance is not an\nisolated instance of the manifestation of classical learning. The\nproblem is by no means so simple a one as that. Classical\nknowledge was shown again and again in the trance\u2014and some-\ntimes, as in the Lethe case, in immediate response to questions\n\u2014which could not have been extracted from the Metamorphoses\n(see Mrs. Verrall's pajier above). If the knowledge of the\nMetamorphoses is to be attributed to Mrs. Piper's recollections,\nit is to be inferred with practical, if not with absolutely\nlogical, certainty that her memory likewise supplied these\nother non-Ovidian references or a large part of them. And it\ncould only have done that, if Mrs. Piper has a fairly exten-\nsive acquaintance with classical literature. I cannot prove\nthat she has not ; but I am quite certain that no one who\nknows her will believe that she has.\nIF.\nTHE SIBYL.\nIn the waking-stage of the trance of March 23, 1908, the\nword \"Sibyl\" had been uttered (see p. 89); and this led Mr.\nDorr to ask Myersp at the next sitting (March 24, 1908) where\n\"the Sibyl\" (meaning thereby, the Cumaean Sibyl) lived. This\nquestion was never explicitly answered ;\nbut I believe that\ncertain disjointed utterances in the waking-stage were meant\nto convey an answer to it, and to convey it by means of an\nallusion to a Vergilian context, just as the question about\nLethe was answered by means of allusions to Vergilian and\nOvidian contexts.\nAppended in chronological order are the relevant passages\nfiom the records, either quoted in full or summarised,\nexplanatory comments being introduced where necessary.\nAs stated elsewhere (see Mrs. Verrall's paper, p. 59), a good\npart of Mr. Dorr's early sittings was devoted to trying to obtain\nfrom MyerSp evidence of acquaintance with Vergil's Aeneid.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: The Sibyl. 145\nThus on March 10, 1908, Mr. Dorr read the Sth line of Book\nI:\nMusa, rnihi causas memora, quo numine laeso,\nand Myersp ga,ve a pertinent reply by saying that it reminded\nhim of \" Eneas [sic] exile . . . Also Dido feast calm waters by\nNeptune\", this being followed by the drawing of a trident;\nand then spontaneously Myersp added :\nI remember something about his father.\nG. B. D. What was his father's name 1\nLet me think (pause). Very odd and rather long.i (Another\npause follows, and no further attempt to get the name is\nmade.)\nThen on March 16, 1908, Mr. Dorr put another question to\nMyersp, and was answei'ed as follows:\nG. B. D. Who was Charon 1\nI remember Charon perfectly well. . . .\nG. B. D. What did he do 1\nI remember father, if I understand the name.\nG. B U. No, you have not got it yet.\nOil, I am thinking of Aeneas's father.\nAeneas had not been previously mentioned at this sitting,\nthough several subjects connected with the first book of the\nAeneicl had been.- The answer given by Myersp\u2014which must\nrefer not to the first but to the sixth book of the Aeneid\u2014\nwas quite intelligible and intelligent ; for when Aeneas, guided\nby the Sibyl, descended to the Underworld and came to the\nbanks of the Styx, Charon at first refused to ferry him across,\nuntil appeased by the Sibyl's words :\n' \" Aeneas of Troy ....\ngoes down to meet his father in the deep shades of Erebus.\nIf the sight of such affection stirs thee in nowise, yet this\nbough {i.e. the Golden Bough] thou must know.\" '\nAen. VI.\n403-7.\nOn March 23, 1908, Mr. Dorr asked MyerSp what the word\nLethe sucraested to him. With the answer oiven to this\n1 The words after \"think\" are probably a comment interjected by Eector.\n-See Mrs. Verrall's paper above, pp. 69, 71-3.\nK\n\f146 J. G. Piddington. [part\nquestion we are already familiar (see pp. 87-9). Part of it, as\nwill be remembered, was cootained in the following utterances\nmade in the waking-stage of the trance of March 23, 1908 :\nHero \u2014Olympus \u2014 Pavia (?) \u2014 Sibyl \u2014 Olympus \u2014water\u2014Lethe \u2014\ndelighted \u2014sad lovely mate. Put them all together. Entwined love\nbeautiful shores\u2014Ask him if he cannot hear me. Muses\u2014I wrote\nChurch long time ago\u2014Olympus\u2014There's Mercury.\nAs explained by Mrs. Sidgwick {v. ]). 184), \" Hero \" and\n\"There's Mercury\" are probably allusions to Wordsworth's\nLaodamia. For \" Olympus \" see below, p. 327. \" I wrote\nChurch,\" etc., is a reminiscence of an old cross-correspondence\nexperiment (v. Proceedings, Vol. XX.II. p. 45). The remain-\nder, excepting \"Muses\", forms part of the answer to the\nLethe question.\nWith regard to these utteiances two facts should be noted\n(1) that Sibyl was not first mentioned by Mr. iJorr, but was fii-st\nspontaneously mentioned by a trance-personality; (2) that this\nfirst reference to the Sibyl was closely followed by a reference to\nthe Muses, to whom likewise no previous reference had been\nmade.\nThis reference in the trance to the Sibyl led Mr. Dorr to put\nthe following question to Myersj, at the next sitting, held on\nMarch 24, 1908 :\u2014\nG. B. D. Do 3'ou remember where the Sibyl lived ?\nI told the Light to say sibyl last time.\nG. B. D. Yes, the Light did say \"Sibyl\" in the waking-stage.\nMr. Dorr did not, however, wait for an answer to his ques-\ntion, but passed on at once to another subject.\nThe next reference to the Sibyl was made on March 30,\n1908, while Mr. Dorr was reading over the record of the words\nuttered in the wakiuo-.statje of March 23, 1908. When the word\n\" Sibyl \" was read out, Myersp wrote \" prophetess \" (see p. 96).\nThe first word audibly spoken in the waking-stage on this same\nday, March 30, 1908, was \" Anchises\". It was the right answer,\nand was, I take it, meant as the answer, to the question asked by\nMr. Dorr on March 10, 1908 :\n\" What was his [i.e. Aeneas's]\nfather's name ?\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from tJie Sitting.'^ : The Sibyl. 147\nThus two of Mr. Dorr's questions had been answered ;\nbut so\nfar no answer had been given to the question :\n\" Do you remem-\nber where the Sibyl lived ?\n\" I find the answer to this third\nquestion in the utterances made in the waking-stage of the trance\nof March 31, 190S, from the record of which I now quote:\nAgamemnon. [This, the first audible word, was a correct answer to\na question asked a few moments earlier during the writing part of\nthe sitting. See Mrs. Verrall's paper, p. 50.]\nSibyls\u2014Muses\u2014Graces. (Then came references to various other\nsubjects.) . . .\nMuses, Muses (followed by three words not caught) and Phyllis.\nHis Mary and Phyllis \u2014Icarus\u2014Anchises.\n\"His M&vy and Phyllis\" refers to a subject which has not the\nremotest connexion with what preceded or with what followed it.\nIt will be noticed that on March 23, 1908, \"Sibyl\" and\n\" Muses \" had been mentioned close together. This time not the\nsingular \" Sibyl \" but the plural \" Sibyls \" is conjoined with\n\" Muses,\" and with ''\nGraces \" as well. I think that the trance-\npersonality wished to convey that he knew that there were\nmore than one Sibyl (although the form of Mr. Dorr's question\nhad rather implied that thei'e was only one) ; and that he\nknew of other groups of feniale legendary characters besides\nthe Sibyls. When the \" Muses \" crop up a second time neither\nSibyls nor Graces are mentioned in the record. The names\nmay have been spoken and not heard ; but anyhow the\nfact remains that when the words (\" Icarus Anchises \") which\nI regard as implying knowledge of where the Sib^d lived did\nemerge, they had been immediately preceded, except for the\nclear-cut interpolation \" His Mary and Phyllis \", by the word\n\" Muses,\" which had twice previously been conjoined with\n\" Sibyl \" or \" Sibyls \".\nThe last extract from the records which bears on the subject\nis taken from the sitting of April G, 1908 :\nG. B. D. (reading over to Myersp the record of the waking-stage of\nMarch 31, 1908) Next slie [i.e. Mrs. Piper] said \"Icarus\"\nand then \"Anchises\".\n(MyerSp communicating.)\nThey are memories, produced by your refreshing my memory.\n\f148 G. Piddington. [part\nIn order to explain why I think the words \" Icarus Anchises\n\"\nindicate knowledge of the Sibyl's habitation, I must summarise\nthe opening passages of the sixth book of the Aeneid.\nSummary of Aeneid VI. 1-123.\nAeneas on his arrival at Cumae at once seeks the Sibyl's cave,\nwhich adjoined a temple that Daedalus, the father of Icarus, had\nbuilt and dedicated to Apollo after his escape from Crete. On the\ndoors of the temple Daedalus had depicted the tragedies that had\nbefallen the house of Minos, and had twice essayed to portray\nthereon the fate of his own son, Icarus ; but in vain, for grief had\nparalysed his hands.\nAs Aeneas gazes on these scenes, the Sibyl accosts him. After\nshe has spoken, Aeneas implores her to guide him through the\nUnderworld to meet his beloved father, Anchises, face to face. He\ntells her how he had rescued Anchises from Troy ; how Anchises\nhad shared his wanderings and sufferings ; and that it was Anchises\nwho had besought and enjoined him to seek the Sibyl's aid.\nIt is in this Verffiliau context that I find the kev to the\npuzzle. For my part I cannot suppose either that the con-\njunction of the names Icarus and Anchises in the waking-\nstage of the trance of March 31, 1908, was fortuitous, or that\nit was not intended as a reference to this passage. I have\nfailed to trace any other episode in classical literature wherein\nAnchises and Icarus figure together ; and at any rate the\ncombination, if not unique, must at least be very rare, as\nthere is nothing in tlieir legendary careers likely often to\nbring them to a literary focus.\nWhy, though, should the question have been answered in\nthis very indirect manner ? Possibly because the trance-per-\nsonality could not remember the word \"Cumae\", just as at\nfirst he could not remember the name \" Anchises \". But more\nprobably the answer was thus deviously conveyed, in order to\navoid the obvious : as was done, I believe, in other instances\n(cf the answer to the Lethe question, especially note on p. 91,\nand Journal for January, 1909, p. 23).\nEven a person of no classical learning might casually have\nheard of the Sibyl of Cumae, but, casually, is hardly likely to\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings: The Sibyl. 149\nhave picked up and retained such knowledge of detail as\nappears to be involved in the mention of Anchises and Icarus.\nBut what purpose was to be served by avoiding the obvious?\nThe simple answer would have been \" Cumae '\":\nan answer known\nto Mr. Dorr, and also to other people, e.g. Mrs. and Miss\nVerrall, with whom at one time or another Mrs. Piper has\nbeen apparently in telepathic raiyport. Had, then, Myersp\nsimply answered \" Cumae \", and if that answer were tliought\nto be beyond the range of Mrs. Piper's normal knowledge, it\nwould have been attributable to telepathy between the medium\non- the one hand and Mr. Dorr, or, say, Mr.s. or Mi.ss Verrall,\non the other.\nBut from Mr. Dorr's mind it seems very unlikely that the\nallusive answer \" Anchises Icarus \" was derived, for he never\nsaw any meaning in it, although he devoted much thought to\nthe records. And the same is true of Mr.s. Verrall, who studied\nthe records most carefully and thoroughly, and w^hose classical\nknowledge is far wider than Mr. Dorr's.\nIt seems hardly necessary to add that it was dramatically\nmost appropriate to represent Frederic Myers as answering in\na fashion which suggests a minute acquaintance with a pa.ssage\nin the Sixth Book of the Aeneid.\nThe remark made by MyerSp on April G, 190S, about the\nnames Anchises and Icarus deserves attention. It may, perhaps,\nbe only the kind of vague generality likely under the circum-\nstances to possess some degree of relevancy ; but it has proved\nto be so singularly apposite that I think it indicates some\nreal comprehension of the true inwardness of the phenomenon.\nI understand Myersp to have meant by it something of this\nkind: \"First, your question about Charon reminded me of\nAeneas's meeting with Anchises in the Underworld ;\nnext, your\nquestion about Lethe reminded me of how Aeneas and Anchises,\naccompanied by the Sibyl, watched the souls about to be\nreincarnated di'inking of the waters of Lethe ; this iti turn\nreminded me of how Aeneas and the Sibyl were warned by\nCharon that they were come to 'the land of Shadows, of Sleep,\nand Slumberous Night'; (and incidentally this reminded me of\nOvid's description of the Cave of Sleep and the River of\nLethe). So that, when you asked me where the Sibyl lived,\n\f150 J. G. Piddington. [part\nmy recollections of the sixth book of the Aeneid had been so\nmuch refreshed that I was able to recall that Anchises and\nIcarus come into Vergil's description of the Sibyl's Cave.\"\nIll-\nA PRELUDE AND A SEQUEL TO THE HORACE ODE\nQUESTION.\nIll my paper on \" A Series of Concordant Automatisms \" in\nProceedings, Vol. XXII. (written in the course of 1907 and\n1908 and published in October, 1908), I discussed (pp. 397-\n407) the answer made by Myersp to a question about an Ode\nof Horace put in the course of the sittings with Mrs. Piper\nin 1907. I have since become aware that allusions to the\nOde in question are made by Myers^ in some of Mrs. Verralbs\nearliest scripts in 1901 ; and further that references to an\nOde of Horace spontaneously made by MyerSp in 1908 seem\nto support the interpretation which I placed on the answer\nto the Horace Ode question given by MyerSp in 1907. The\nrelations between these various communications, and between\nthem and Frederic Myers's thoughts when alive, seem to me\nimportant ; and I accordingly propose to set out the various\nfacts involved briefly in chronological order, and then to discuss\nthem in more detail.\nOn Dec. 31, 1884, Frederic Myers addressed a letter to Dr.\nA. W. A'errall, in the course of which he said that the first\nsix lines of Hor. C. I. 28 had \" entered as deeply as almost\nany Horatian passage into \" his \" own inner history \" (see Proe.\nVol. XXII. p. 400). He did not, however, explain why this\nparticular Ode had \" entered into his inner history \".\nMrs. Verrall read this letter at or about the time of its\nreceipt.\nOn Jan. 17, 1901, Frederic Myers died.\nA few weeks after his death, Mrs. Verrall for the first time\ndeveloped the faculty of writing automatically, and much of\nher script purports to emanate from him.\n\fLX.] Three Incidentsfrom the Sittings : Horace Ode Question. 151\nMrs. Verrall's script of March 5, 1901\u2014the iirst piece of\nintelligible script she ever wrote\u2014contains an allusion to the\nfifth iine of Hor. C. I. 28 ; her script of March 12, 1901,\ncontains, besides quotations from two other Odes of Horace, an\nallusion to the medieval Latin phrase adscri'ptus glclae, which\nhas been used as a rendering of eiTapovpo<;, a word occurring\nonly in Odyssey XL 489 ; her script of March 15, 1901,\nafter a reference to a book, bids her \" reject the verses which\nI wrote in my presumption \" ; and her script of April 27,\n1901, to which is appended one of the regular signatures of\nMyerSy, bids search be made for \" the book \", again alludes to\nthe phrase ccdscrijjtus gkhae, and immediately afterwards to the\nfifth and sixth lines of Hor. C. I. 28.\nThese four scripts all show points of contact with each other,\nand undoubtedly belong to the group of Mrs. A^errall's scripts\nwhich purport to be inspired by Frederic Myers. Here I\nhave drawn attention to a few points only in them ; but\nlater on I shall quote them in full and discuss them in some\ndetail.\nIn October 1904, Mrs. Verrall for the first time read in\nFragments of Prose and Poetry two poems of Myers's : Imvior-\ntality and On a Spring Morning at Sea. Pmmoiiality had\nbeen published before, first in 1870, and again in 1875 ; but\nMrs. Verrall is quite positive that she never read it till 1904,\nand had never seen the early volumes of Myers's poems in\nwhich it originally appeared. On a Spring Moryiing at Sea was\npublished for the first time in 1904.\nOn January 1, 1907, Mrs. Verrall, while going through\nan accumulation of old correspondence, came across the letter\naddressed by Frederic Myers to Dr. Verrall on Dec. 31, 1884.\nShe had not read it since the beginning of 1885 and had\nforgotten all about it ; and the allusions in her early scripts\nto Hor. C, I. 28, though in one case recognised by her, had\nnot provoked in her mind any conscious recollection of it.\nThe discovery of the letter in January 1907 led her to ask\nme to put the following question to Myersp : \"Which Ode of\nHorace entered deeply into your inner life ?\n\" ; and this ques-\ntion I put at the sitting with Mrs. Piper held on Jan, 23,\n1907 (v. Proc. Vol. XXII. p. 3 97). From the time of the\ndiscovery of the letter until April 10, 1908, Mrs. Verrall was\n\f152 J. G. P'idclington. [part\nunder the impression that the reason why Hor. C. I. 28 had\nentered deeply into Frederic Myers's inner history was that\nit contained an allusion to reincarnation (id. ib. p. 407).\nOn April 17, April 29, May 1 and May 6, 1907 (see Proc,\nVol. XXII. pp. 369, 377, 379-381, 386-7), Myer-Sp gave answers\nto the question about the Ode of Horace, which a twelvemonth\nafterwards (April 25, 1908)^ I interpreted as meaning that\nallusions would be found in Frederic Myers's poem Immor-\ntality to an Ode of Horace, and that this Ode was the one of\nwhich the first six lines had \" entered as deeply as any\nHoratian passage into his inner history \".\nAfter pointing out certain verbal resendDlances between Hor.\nC. I. 28 and Immortality, I went on to suggest that Myers\nmight have found in Hor. C. I. 28, and especially in the\nfirst six lines of it, an expression of the sentiment which\nforms the main theme of Immortality : namely, dread of an\naimless and unprogressive existence in the after-life. By way\nof illustrating the interpretation which I thought Myers might\nhave put upon Hor. C. I. 28, I quoted, in Englisli, bhe lines\nfrom the Odyssey (XL 488-491), in whicii occurs the word\neirdpovpo^, which some commentators render by adscriptus\nglehac. -\nBetween Feb. 25 and May 26, 1908\u2014that is, partly before\nand partly after I had tliought out and committed to writing\nthe interpretation of the answer to Mrs. Verrall's Horace Ode\nquestion summarised above and given in detail in Proc. Vol.\nXXII. pp. 397-407\u2014Mr. G. B. Dorr had a series of sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper in America, and in the course of them read\nto MyerSp passages from the writings of Frederic Myers, and\nalso passages from classical authors, for the purpose of dis-\ncovering what response MyerSp would make to these sti7mdi.\nMr. Dorr knew hardly anything about the results of the\nsittings given by Mrs. Piper in England beyond the fact that\nsome success had been obtained in the cross-correspondence\nexperiments ; he had seen none of the records, and was\nunaware that any question about an Ode of Horace had been\nhave been able to fix the exact date b}' reference to niy contemporaneous\ncorrespondence with Mrs. Verrall.\n\"Tlioiigh well aware of this rendering of the word, I deliberately adopted\nthe other rendering, \"above ground\".\n\fLX.] Three Incidentsfrom the Sittings : Horace Ode Question. 153\nput to Myersp. I proceed to show in detail what seem to\nme to be references in these sittings to Hor. C. I. 28, to\nthe above-named passage in the Gdyssey, and to the poem\nImmortality.\nOn March 9, 1908, Mr. Dorr read the first four words of\nVergil's Aencid to Mj^ersp, who translated them, and spon-\ntaneously gave the names \"Juno\" and \"Neptune\" in relevant\nconnexion with them. It was then arranged that \" Neptune\nshould be the subject of a cross-correspondence experiment\nwith Miss H. Veri'all (see Mrs. Sidgwick's paper, pp. 175-7).\nOn March 10, 1908, Mr. Dorr read to MyerSp Aeneid I. 8,\nMusa, viihi causas racmora, quo nuriiinc lacso, and MyerSp in-\ncluded among the associations aroused in his mind by these\nwords \" Dido\u2014feast\u2014calm waters by Neptune \" : an answer\nwhich suggests that he recognised the source of the Latin\nwords, and that he was thinking particularly of the escape of\nAeneas and his fleet from the storm which Neptune had\ncalmed, of his arrival at Carthage and of his hospitable recep-\ntion by Dido (see Mrs. Verrall's paper, p. 68).\nA few minutes later Mr. Dorr read to MyerSp the follow-\ning words from Fragments of Prose and Poetry: \"From\nten to sixteen I [i.e. Frederic Myers] lived much in the\ninward recital of Homer, Aeschylus, Lucretius, Horace, and\nOvid.\"\nAs the name Horace was spoken, the hand wrote\nOde to i motalty imortality\n.... Ode Horace to MortaHty,\nThis reply\u2014which naturally conveyed no meaning to Mr.\nDorr\u2014I regard as affording some confirmation of the\ncorrectness of my conjecture that the words, \" Do you\nremember immortality?\"\u2014written by MyerSp on April 17,\n1907, in connexion with the question about an Ode of\nHorace\u2014were intended as an allusion to Frederic ]\\Iyers's\npoem Immortality (see Proe. Vol. XXII. p. 398). Anyhow\nit is clear that MyerSp remembered the question asked\na year before, and his answer to it. Mr. Dorr then went on\nto read some more passages from pp. 17 and 18 of\nFrarjonents, the last sentence read being this :\n\" It was the\nlife of about the sixth century before Christ, on the isles\n\f154 J. G. Piddington. [part\nof the Aegean, which drew me most.\" As these words were\nread Myersp wrote :\nA Hfe iiuvnqjlete.^ Oh ! it is all so dear. I recall so well my\nfeehngs, my emotions, my joy?, my pain and much pain. Oh ! I\nam transported back to Greece. I recall it all. I am transported\u2014\nI remember before my marriage all my imaginations, my pain, my\nlonging, my unrest. I lived it all out as few men did. I drank,\nas Omar Kyam [sic], life and all its joys and griefs. And never\nwas it complete. A disappointing\u2014long, dreary longing for a fulfil-\nment of my dreamed of joys. I found it here and only here. 'Men\nmay come and men may go but I go on for ever.' I shall be\ndelighted to complete my memories of Homer, Horace and Vergil\nuntil you are satisfied that I am still one among you, not a fantasy\nbut a reality.\nThis emotional outburst, it should be observed, is closely\nassociated with \" memories of Homer, Horace and Vergil \", and\nnot with the other classical autliors, Ovid, Lucretius and\nAeschylus, mentioned in the passage read from Fragments ;\nand into it is introduced a quotation from Tennyson whereby\nthe trance-personality proclaims his own immortality.^\nMyerSp then enumerates the cross-correspondence experi-\nments on which he is at present engaged, namely,\n\" The city in flames, a face in tiames, exile, Troy, Juno,\nXeptune \" ; and then immediately asks Mr. Dorr to select \" a\nline from Horace \" lor the purpose of a fresh experiment. Mr.\nDorr selected instead a Vergilian line ; but the point I wish to\nbe noted is that MyerSp makes his request for a Inie from\nHorace immediately alter writing \"Neptune'', and soon after\nspeaking of having found the consummation of happiness in\nhis present life and there only.\nOn March 16, 1908, after MyerSp had made a reference to\nJuno and Aeneas, Mr. Dorr asked him who Charon was, and\nMyerSp replied that he was \" thinking of Aeneas's father \" : a\nreply which suggests knowledge of the sixth book of Acncul,\n^The italicised words represent words underlined in the original script.\n-The whole passage should be compared with what was said by Myersp on\nMay 1, 1907, (see Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 379 and 403) in connexion with his\nanswer to the Horace Ode question, where, as here, emphasis is thrown upon\nthe comidetioii of happiness in the next life and on the inferiority of life on\nearth to the after- life.\n\fLX.] Three Incidents from the Sittings : Horace Ode Question. 155\nwhere Aeneas' vision of the Underworld and his meeting with\nhis father, Anchises, is described (see above, p. 145). All the\nutterances in the waking-stage were reported as from Myersp,\nand ran as follows :\n... I am not a phantom nor unreal\u2014Carthage\u2014 She did not\nwish [it] to be more beautiful than hers. Neptune calmed the\nsea for Aeneas My soul is in a flame. All God's pro-\nphecies have been fulfilled. Nothing in Iliad or Odyssey can compare\nwith my soul raptures, but they are all in tune with it. Vivi et\nvivias [so recorded] with my best love. . . . Vivi (pronounced\n\" veevee \") et vivias [so recorded].\nHere again MyerSp insistently proclaims the reality and joy\nof his present state of existence ; he is no phantom, no e'l^oAov,\nnot one of a throng of joyless ghosts such as peopled the\nUnderworld of Homer, or of A^ergil, or of Horace.\nAchilles.\nOn March 17, 1908, Mr. Dorr read to Myersp the following\nlines from Tennyson's Vastness, which Frederic Myers had\nquoted in his essay on \" Tennyson as Prophet \" in Science\nand a Future Life (pp. 152-3) :\nMany a hearth upon our dark globe sighs after many a vanish'd\nface,\nMany a planet by many a sun may roll with the dust of a vanish'd\nrace.\nRaving politics, never at rest\u2014as this poor earth's pale history\nruns,\nWhat is it all but a trouble of ants in the srleam of a million\nmillion of suns ?\nMyerSp in reply, after first saying it \" sounds like one of\nmy quotations from Swinburne rightly recognises it as from\nTennyson ; and then immediately writes \" Achilles \", adding,\n\" You brought him to my mind when you were reading\nHomer.\" Mr. Dorr asks, \" AVhat about Achilles ?\n\" and Mj'erSp\niMrs. Verrall has suggested some very plausible reasons why Myersp, if\nhe possessed the memories of Frederic Myers, should have attributed these\nlines to Swinburne, but I will not enter into them here.\n\f15G J. G. Piddington. [part\nanswers :\n\" Why, I recalled it when you were questioning me.\nCould you read more ?\n\"\nAlthough Mr. Dorr entirely foiled to see any relevance\neither in the allusion to Achilles, or in the request for more to\nbe read, I think it was extremely significant that an intelli-\ngence representing itself as that of Frederic Myers should\nconnect Tennyson's VaMness with Achilles.^ In Odysscjj XI.,\nwhen Odysseus enters the Underworld, he meets Achilles, who\nasks \" how durst thou come down to the house of Hades,\nwhere dwell the senseless dead, the phantoms of men out-\nworn ?\n\" Odysseus answers him in consolatory words, which\ndraw from Achilles this response :\n\" Nay, speak not comfort-\nably to me of death. . . . Rather would I live on ground\n[or, \" as a serf attached to the soil,\" i.e. eirapovpo<i \u2014 adscriptus\nglchac] as the hireling of another . . . than bear sway among\nall the dead that are no more.\"\nThis passage\u2014one of the most famous in ancient literature\n\u2014would almost inevitably be recalled to a classical reader\nby the whole thought, and especially by one of the concluding\nstanzas of Tennyson's Vastncss :\nWhat is it all, if we all of us end but in being our own corpse-\ncoffins at last,\nSwallow'd in Vastness, lost in Silence, drown'd in the deeps of a\nmeaningless Past ?\nThese lines, though not read by Mr. Dorr, actually form part\nof what is quoted from Vastness in \" Tennyson as Prophet \"\nand the fact that they are there quoted suggests that when\nMyersp asked Mr. Dorr to \" read more \" he may have meant\nthat if he read the remainder of the quotation the clue to\nthe connexion of thought with Achilles would be revealed.\nIf this is the right interpretation of the mention of Achilles,\nit would seem as if the \" Myers \" of Mrs. Piper's trance here,\nand the \"Myers\" of Mrs. Verrall's scripts of March 12 and\nApril 27, 1901, through the phrase adscripttis glebae, both\nmade allusions to the passage in the eleventh book of Odyssey,\nwhere the meeting of Odysseus with Achilles in the Under-\nworld is described.-\n1 There is no allusion to Achilles in \"Tennyson as Prophet\".\n2 This passage is at least twice referred to iu Myers's writings : Essays\nClassical, p. 172, and Essays Modurn, p. 159.\n\f]-X.] Three Incidentsfrom theSittings : Horace Ode Question. 157\nOrion.\nIn the waking-stage of the trance of March 31, 1908, were\nuttered the words \" He says you remind him of Orion \" ; the\ncontext leaving it doubtful whether \" He \" meant MyerSp or\nHodgsonp.^\nIt was Mr. Dorr's practice at that time to read over to the\ncontrols, usually at the next sitting, the record of the utter-\nances made in the waking-stage of a previous trance, in order\nto obtain comments on them or corrections or expansions or\nexplanations of them from the controls. Thus on April 6,\n1908, Mr. Dorr asked Myersp about the mention of Orion in\nthe wakinsr-stage of March 31 :\nG. B. D. The other day she [i.e. Mrs. Piper speaking in the waking-\nstage] said that R. H. [i.e. Hodgson] said I reminded\nhim of Orion. I thought that probably that had some\nreference to some message.\n(MyerSp communicating) Most certainly it did. I have given\nit through Mrs. V. [i.e. Mrs. Verrall] several times.\n\" Orion's head \" is what I wrote.\n[\"Orion's head\" may refer to one or both of two things.\nIt may refer to Aeneid X. 763-767 : \"Vast as Orion when,\nwith planted foot, he cleaves his way through the vast\npools of mid-ocean and his shoulder overtops the waves,\nor carrying an ancient mountain-ash from the hilltops,\npaces the ground and hides his head among the clouds\n'\n(caput inter nuhila condit) ; or to the story (not, however,\nto be found in classical literature) of how Artemis,\nchallenged by Apollo to hit an object far out at sea,\naimed and struck it, only to find that it was the head\nof Orion, whom she loved. }soie hj J. G. I'.j\nOn April 21, 1908, in the waking-stage, came another and\ndisjointed reference to Orion, as follows :\n\" Orion, son of\nNeptune.\"\n^ Mr. Dorr took \"He\" to mean Hodgsonp. I tliiuk it more likely that\nMyersp was meant, as the next utterance, which deals with a difl'erent topic,\nis preluded by \"Hodgson said\", as if to denote a change of speaker. But\nthe point is not material, as Mj'ers and Hodgson are always represented in\nthese sittings as in close co-operation.\n\f15S J. G. Piddington. [part\nOn April 22, 1908, Mr. Dorr asked Hodgsoiip if anything\nliad been said about Orion during the English series of sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper. Hodgsonp replied, correctly and with\nemphasis, \" No \". Mr. Dorr then asked Myersp for his com-\nments on the utterances made in the waking-stage on the\nprevious day. When the words, \" Orion, son of Neptune,\"\nwere read out, MyerSp at once wrote :\n\" Do you recall an Ode\nof Horace's ?\n\" Mr. Dorr replied :\n\" I do not know my Horace\nwell, and I recall none in special at the moment. Why do\nyou ask me ?\n\"\nMyerSp then said :\n\" Because you ought to\nknow that I am Myers by my giving all such proofs.\"\nTo Mr. Dorr these remarks of Myersp must have seemed\nhopelessly irrelevant,^ as indeed they must have seemed to\nany one who did not know both that a year before a\nquestion had been asked of MyerSp about an Ode of Horace,\nand to which of Horace's Odes this question related. As a\nmatter of fact, as we know, the question asked a year\nbefore related to Hor. C. I. 28 ; and this is the only Ode of\nHorace's in xohich Neptune and Orion, are hath vientioned.\nBut before discussing this, the culminating point of the\nepisode, I had better first describe the last references to it in\nMrs. Piper's trance.\nLast References to the Subject in the Trance.\nEarly in May 1908 I wrote to Mr. Dorr and asked\nhim to read the first six lines of Hor. C. I. 2S in Latin\nto MyerSp. I did this in entire ignorance that anything had\nbeen said at Mr. Dorr's sittings about Orion and Neptune\nfor I had seen the records of the sittings of March 9 and 10,\n1908, only, and these I had but hastily scanned.\nI did not tell Mr. Dorr why I wanted him to read these\n1 Except in so far as the words \"Orion, son of Neptune \" sliovved knowledge\nof one of the various versions of Orion's parentage.\n-The words \"Ode to imortality '', written at the sitting of March 10,\n1908, in connexion with the mention of Horace's name, hail conveyed nothing\nto my mind wlien I read them on March .30, 190S, for the first time; and I\ndoubt if I noticed them at all, for whea on April '25, 1908, I interpreted\nthe phrase used by Myersp on April 17, 1907, \" Do you remember immor-\ntality?\" as referring to Frederic Myers's Immortality, it revived no recollection\nof the words \"Ode to imortality \".\n\fLX.] Three Incidentsfrom the Sittings : Horace Ode Question. 159\nlines to MyerSp, and though Mr. Dorr knew the source of\nthem he did not reveal it or give any hint of it to MyerSp\nwhen he read them at the last sitting of the season on\nMay 26, 1908.\nAfter Mr. Dorr had read the first six lines the hand\nwrote :\nODE Odes, Beginning of end. Myers. Odyssey. (After a\npause) Do you remember a book Onar ? (G. B. D. No, I recall\nnone which has that name.)

You remember our reading certain things together before\nthe Light closed for the summer rest\"?\n(MyerSp communicating.) Yes, your last reading to me was\none of Horace's Odes and pleased me greatly. It gave\nme courage to go on.\nMr. Dorr read the lines again to MyerSp on March 1, 1909,\nbut they elicited no response ; and here for the present, and\nprobably for good, the matter stands.\nIt will be observed that, on May 2 6, 1908, MyerSp, after\n\" ODE Odes \" had been written, added \" Odyssey.\" Now at\nthe sitting of May 1, 1907 {Froc. Vol. XXIT. p. 381) the\nfollowing had occurred :\n(Present: Mrs. Sidgwick.)\n(Myersp communicating)\nI went over those Odes very careful!}'\nand remembered one in particular\nwhich I loved very much\nOdes yes it was.\n(Rector communicating)\nsounds like Odessus\nE.M.S. \"Odessis\"?\nyes.\nOdesesis\nOdesia\n\f160 \/.

Now, in\nthe new light thrown on the subject by Mrs. Verrall's early\nscripts and Mr. Dorr's sittings, I am disposed to regard the\nwords \" Odessus Odesesis Odesia Odesu Odesie \" written on\nMay 1, 1907, and the \"Odyssey\" of May 26, 1908, as\nattempts to connect Odysseus and the Odyssey with Hor.\nC.

It was appropriate\nenough that the reading of the first six lines of this Ode\nshould suggest an association of ideas with Omar's Song, whose\nburden, says FitzGerald, \"\n\u2014if not '\nLet us eat '\n\u2014is assuredly\n'\nLet us drink, for To-morrow we die !\n'\n\"\nSummary and Eeview of the earlier and later Answers\nTO THE Horace Ode Question.\nLet us now first consider how Myersp answered the Horace\nOde question in 1907 and then how in 1908 he amijlified\nand added to his original answer.\n\fLX.] Three Incidentsfrom the Sittings : Horace Ode Question. 161\nIn 1907 MyerSp conveyed his answer by means of allusions\nto Frederic Myers's poem Immortality and to two lines in\nAbt Vogler\n. . . the wonderful Dead who have passed through the body and\ngone,\nBut were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their\nnew\nthese lines being followed by the comment that though he\nhad returned to breathe in the old world it was \" not better\nthan our new\" (see Froc. Vol. XXII. pp. 369, 379-380).\nThere is a possible two-fold point in alluding to these two\nlines : they can be taken to indicate knowledge of the reference\nto the reincarnation of Pythagoras in Hor. C. I. 28, and they\ncan be taken to intimate that the gloomy forecasts in Hor.\nC. I. 28 and in Immortaiity of what existence after death\nmight prove to be, were not justified by the reality.\nBesides this, unless it is mere confusion, there would\nappear to have been a confused attempt to connect the Ode\nof Horace with Odysseus or the Odyssey.\nIn 1908, Myersp was led to mention Neptune in con-\nnexion with Vergil's Aeneid, not once, but frequently ; and\nthe subject of Neptune was further emphasised by its being\nchosen for a cross-correspondence experiment (cf. Mrs. Sidg-\nwick's paper, p. 177). The stress thus undesignedly thrown\non Neptune provoked apparently in the mind of MyerSp an\nassociation of ideas with Orion. At first it seemed as if this\nassociation of Orion with Neptune was due solely to a revived\nmemory of an out-of-the-way mythological story, according to\nwhich Orion was Neptune's son; but later (viz. on April 22,\n1908, see above) it was made evident that it was due to a\nmemory of an Ode of Horace's. What Ode was not stated,\nbut in only one Ode of Horace's C. I. 28\u2014are Neptune and\nOrion both mentioned, and that Ode is the Ode which formed\nthe subject of the question put to MyerSp in 1907. No help\ncould have been given by the experimenter, Mr. Dorr, towards\nthe identification of the Ode for the very good reason that\nhe knew nothing whatsoever about the test question put in\n1907, and even if he had known about it, he would not have\nknown what the right answer to it was.\nL\n\f162 J. G. Piddington. [PAKT\nIn addition to this, the mention by MyerSp of Achilles in\nconnexion with a quotation from Tennyson's Vastness on March\n17, 1908, and of the Odyssey in connexion with the first six\nlines of Hor. C. 1. 28 on May 26, 1908, seems to confirm,\nor at any rate to present very striking coincidences with, the\ninterpretation of the first answer given in 1907 to the Horace\nOde question (see Proc. Vol. XXII., pp. 398-406), which I first\nthought out on April 25, 1908. The mention of Achilles\nmade on March 17, 1908 seems like an anticipation as well\nas a confirmation of my interpretation, as does likewise the\ninsistence with which, in the communications of March 10 and\nMarch 16, 1908, MyerSp claims that his life is no phantasmal\none but real, and that his joy is fulfilled.^\nThe note of almost triumphant assurance with which MyerSp\nexplained to Mr. Dorr why he had asked him if he recalled\nan Ode of Horace's\u2014\" because you ought to know that I am\nMyers by my giving all such proofs\" (p. 158)\u2014suggests that\nMyersp felt assured that he had succeeded in getting through\na first-rate piece of evidence, and he certainly cannot have\nacquired this assurance from any sort of indication furnished\nby Mr. Dorr.\nMrs. Vekeall's Early Eeferences to the Horace Ode.\nI must now deal in detail with the four early scripts of\nMrs. Verrall's which I have so far only summarised.\nMrs. VermWs script of March 5, 1901.'-\n(\u00ab) Evie Myers counsel gear neu I save trouble cant\nkeep evie vely ten yet come nomeu et ego cum multis\nat omnibus ne tristia munera [spelt \"nunera\"] fiunt nee\n^ These anticipations by Myersp of conjectural interpretations put forward\nin my paper On a Series of Concordant Automatkma do not stand alone. Two\nother incidents that occurred at Mr. Dorr's sittings seem to me to be of the\nsame kind ; but I cannot discuss them here. If the coincidences are not\naccidental, and if they are to be explained by telepathy between the living,\nit must have been I who drew on Mrs. Piper or Mr. Dorr, not Mrs. Piper\nwho drew on my mind.\n2 This and the three other scripts Iiave ah-eady appeared, either in whole or\nin part, in Proc.

To the best of her belief Mrs. Verrall did not\nlearn of this application of adscriptus glehae until August 16,\n1906; when, as she noted at the time, she came across it in\na classical dictionary, and, recalling the words ascripta es glehae\nin her scripts of March 12 and April 27, 1901, thought they\nmight be meant as an allusion to the Homeric passage.\nSplendidior vitro o fons is a reminiscence of Hor.

III. 13,\nthe script says :\n\" nihU quod attinct modo eccini carmen\nineluctabilc auribus tuis.\" This, I suggest, may mean, that\nthe allusion to Horace C. III. 13 was not to the point ;\nand that the Ode to which the scribe had wanted to allude\nin connexion with \" glcbis adscripta \" was the Ode which \" I\nsang but a little while back \", i.e. the Ode alluded to in (\u00ab-),\nviz. Hor. C. I. 28.\nMrs. Myers is referred to in {a) and {d) ; that is in the\nonly scripts which allude to Hor. C. I. 28. I suggest that\nthe reason of this may have been that Mrs. Myers possessed\na copy of the \"small volume, which was published in 1870,\nand has for a long time been out of print \" {Fragments, p.\nvi) from which Immortcdity was reprinted. The \" verses\nwhich I wrote in my presumption \" and which Mrs. Verrall\nis bidden to \" reject \", I suggest are the poem Immortality.\n\f168 J. G. Piddington. [part\nMrs. Myers's name is also connected with what, I suggest,\nmay be allusions in (a) and (d) to another poem of Frederic\nMyers's : On a Spring Morni7ig at Sea. This poem was\npublished by Mrs. Myers for the first time in Fragments (p. 54).\nIts theme is a forecast of the after-life as couleur de rose as\nthat in Immartality is sombre.\nBut with these possible allusions to On a Spring Morning\nat Sea Mrs. Sidgwick's name is also connected. If the reader\nwill turn to Proc. Vol. XX. pp. 195-198 he will see that Mrs.\nVerrall, who was at the time quite unable to interpret the\nscript, learnt on Jan. 1, 1905, that there was \"a privately\nprinted pamphlet in a sealed envelope \" in a box under the\ndrapery of the window-seat in Mrs. Sidgwick's drawing-room.\nShe then supposed that \"the book\" of her script of April 27,\n1901, referred to this pamphlet. It had been given in a\nsealed envelope into Henry Sidgwick's charge by Erederic Myers,\nand contained among other matter the poem On a Spring\nMorning at Sea : though this fact was unknown both to\nMrs. SidQwick and to Mrs. Verrall, neither of whom had seen\nthe pamphlet, at the time the script was produced. Mrs. Myers\nnaturally possessed a copy of it likewise. It did not contain\nthe poem Pniniortality. I suggest that there was an endeavour\nmade in these early scripts of Mrs. Verrall's to refer to two\ndifferent books : first to the early edition of Myers's poems con-\ntaining Immortality, of which Mrs. Myers possessed a copy ; and\nsecondly, to the privately printed pamphlet, of which both Mrs.\nSidgwick and Mrs. Myers had a copy, containing On a Spring\nMorning ai Sea ; and that there was also an endeavour made\nto allude to these two poems in particular, and at the same\ntime to Odyssey XI. 489, and to Hor. C. I, 28; the object\nof this combination of allusions being to contrast the gloomy\nforebodings of Odyssey XL, Horace's \" Archytas \" Ode, and\nMyers's Immortcdity, with the roseate hopes of On a Spring\nMorning at Sea, and thereby to imply that the happy and not\nthe gloomy prevision was the true one.\nThe interpretation here presented is, I admit, highly con-\njectural. If it is correct, it obviously involves the assumption\nthat Frederic Myers is in some sense behind Myersy, and,\nI may add, Myersp also. This is the assumption which at\n\fLX.] Three Incidentsfrom the Sittings : Horace Ode Question. 169\npresent seems to me to account most simply for the facts which\nI have set before the reader. But I hope he will attempt to\napply other hypotheses to them ; for it is only by testing\nevery reasonable hypothesis that we can hope to arrive at a\ntrue solution of the problem.\n\f170 Mrs. Henry SiclgtvicJc.

PIPER\nAND OTHER AUTOMATISTS.\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nIt falls to me to describe tlie cross-correspondences which\noccurred in the course of Mr. Dorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper\nin America in March, April, and May, 1908. By cross-\ncorrespondence I mean a coincidence in the content of the\nscripts of two automatists. Those I have to describe are of\na more or less simple kind,\u2014the same ideas or nearly so in\nboth scripts. They do not carry out the programme of the\n\"Latin message\" (see Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. XXII. pp. 312-\n416). I shall limit myself to coincidences which are seemingly\nintentional on the part of Mrs. Piper's trance-personalities.\nIt may be as well to note that in none of these experiments\nin cross-correspondence can thought-transference between the\nsitter and Mrs. Piper have intervened as a complicating\nelement, since he had no access to or knowledge of the scripts\nof the other automatists, who were moreover separated from\nhim by the width of the Atlantic. Also active participation\nby the normal consciousness of these other automatists was\nlargely excluded by their ignorance that any special set of\nsittings for cross-correspondences was being held.\nIn a note to the first sitting of the series, that held on\nMarch 9th, 1908, Mr. Dorr says that he last had a sitting\nalone with Mrs Piper\ntwo weeks previous to the sitting of the 9th of March [actually\non February 25th] and I then gave [Hodgsoup] the two Latin\nsentences to translate, tJien if he could : Vcni, vidi, vici and Anna\nvirumque cano.

The intention there is very clear and\nmarked at the first emergence of the name on March 9 th.\nWas its selection and emergence on that day, among other\nnames which reference to the Acneid might have called up,\ndue to a double association, to vague recollections of the\npoem stimulated by a telepathic flash either from Miss\nVerrall or from some source that inspired Miss Verrall also ?\nIt looks rather like this. That it was not more than a\nrtash seems to be shown by the ignorance and confusion\nsubsequently displayed as to when and how and to whom the\nmessage had been given, and the inconsistency of the state-\nments about it with each other and with the facts. Probably\nthese false and confused statements were for the most part\nmade simply because the Piper script, like other automatic\nscript, almost always does attempt to satisfy a questioner,\nwhether the true answer to the question is really known or\nnot. Still it must be admitted that such statements diminish\nthe evidential force of successful experiments, as also do\nthe numerous statements that this or that \" message \" has\nsuccessfully appeared in cases where no trace of success can\nbe discovered by us.

Only I am telling you we wrote it [joy]\nstraight out as we did archway long ago.\n^ \"Laurel wreath\" was the subject of a concordant automatism in the Piper\nsittings in England (see Mr. Piddington's paper, Vol. XXII. p. 94), and earlier\nin this sitting of March '23rd the trance-personalities had referred to it. Is it\nassociation of ideas with this, or experimental zeal, or both, that leads to the\nmention of wreath here, and to its forming again part of a successful cross-\ncorrespondence ?\n- The word archway did not occur in Mrs. Piper's sittings in England. The\nword \" arch \" and other words of which \" arch \" was the first syllable occurred in\nMrs. Verrall's script, as Mr. Piddington informed the Piper trance-personalities\n(see his paper, A Series of Goncordant Automatisms, Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXII.\np. 80), with the suggestion that they were connected with an attempt to write\nthe word \"arrow.\" That it is this that Hodgsonp here refers to is rendered\nthe more probable by the fact that the word and idea of arrow and also\nLongfellow's line, \" I shot an arrow through the air,\" which Mr. Piddington had\nquoted to the trance-personalities in connexion with this cross-correspondence,\noccur in Mrs. Piper's utterances in the waking-stage of this same day.\nIt is important to remember in studying these sittings of Mr. Dorr's that\nwhen they were held neither Miss Johnson's paper on Mrs. Holland's script,\nnor Mr. Piddington's paper on concordant automatisms had been published.\n\f184 Mrs. Henry Sidgiuick. [part\nIn the waking-stage of this sitting the following broken\nphrases were uttered\nFish \u2014Mermaid \u2014Saturn \u2014^Hero \u2014Olympus \u2014[then a word\nwhich was indistinctly caught hut sounded to Mr. Dorr\nlike pavia^] Sybil\u2014-Olympus\u2014water\u2014Lethe\u2014delighted\nsad\u2014lovel}' \u2014mate\u2014put them all together.

See Mr. Piddington's paper, pp. 90-3.]\nOf these words fragmentarily caught, some e.c\/. Olympus,\nwater, Lethe\u2014are repetitions of what had been written in\nthe course of the sittiag. Of the rest some would certainly\nbe appropriate if we could suppose that the words and ideas\nof Wordsworth's Laodcnnia were inhueuciug the communica-\ntions. Consider especially the third stanza, which runs :\n0 terror ! what hath she perceived ? \u20140 joy !\nWhat doth she look on 1 \u2014whom doth she behold ?\nHer Hero slain upon the beach of Troy 1\nHis vital presence ? his corporeal mould 1\nIt is \u2014if sense deceive her not\n\u2014'tis He !\nAnd a god leads him, winged Mercury.\nThis stanza contains the words \" Hero \" and \" Mercury \" as\nwell as the two words '\nTroy \" and \" Joy \" previously mentioned\nas havino' been transferred to Mrs. Verrall.\nIn any case, whatever we may think of Mrs. Piper's utter-\nance, this story of Laodamia undoubtedly influenced Miss\nVerrall's script of April 20th, 1908\u2014a month later.\nMinos and Rhadamanthus and a third\nEp\/iT^s j^u>^o7ro\/x7ros -\n' Attempts to get this word repeated or interpreted at subsequent sittings,\nfailed, but see Mr. Piddington's paper, p. 101.\n^ Hermes, leader of souls.\n\fLX.] Gross-Correspondences. 185\n[The herald's staff, the symbol of Hermes' office, drawn here\nwith the words :J\nthe symbol of his oflfice\nand the souls follow\nA holly leave or something like that green and prickly a holly\nwreath\nTro}' Laodamia saw a vision too.^\nThe word here rendered \" Troy \" is very badly written, but\nit looks more like Troy than anything else ; and if it formed\npart of a sentence in which Troy completed the sense we\nshould, I think, have no hesitation in so reading it. But even\nif \" Troy \" was not actually written, the reference to Laodamia\nimplies it, and through the reference to Wordsworth's poem, ''joy\n\"\nis implied also. We have further the word \" wreath \" - which\nHodgsonp connected with joy on March 2ord (see p. 183).\n\" Joy of the gods,\" which was mentioned by Hodgsoup in\nthe same connexion on March 23rd, finds its parallel in Miss\nVerrall's script of April 1st, 1908, when she wrote:\nThe pillars of converging fire\nThe ministers of joy divine\nWill satisfy the hearts desire\nThe longing for a stainless shrine.\nThe double arch and the flowing river ask about that.\nThe stream flows swiftly and the swirling eddies beat against\nthe pier.\nTroy and Joy are mentioned at subsequent sittings with\nMrs. Piper in April, from the 6th onwards, as messages that\nhave been finished, but nothing more of interest was said\nabout them.\n^ Can tliis \"too\" meau \"as well as Alcyone''? For Alcyone's vision see\nabove, pp. 99-100. Mr. Piddington's paper on \"Lethe\" sliows that Alcyone's\nstory is referred to in Mrs. Piper's trance of March 23rd.\n-The word \"wreath\" does not occur in Wordsworth's Laodamia, and it affords\ntherefore an independent instance of correspondence between Mrs. Piper's and\nMiss Verrall's scripts. A reminiscence of Laodamia is not the sole cause of\nthe agreement between them.\n'The word \"joy\" had previously occurred in Miss Verrall's script of this\nperiod on March 5th thus: \"A star in the East the pledge and symbol of\nthe coming day, a star of joy to those that watch. The firstfruits of the\nmorning Nuntius Aurorte radiis ubi dissipat umbras.\"\n\f186 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nExile and Moore.\nExile was a word spontaneously written by Hodgsonp on\nMarch 9th, 1908, in the attempt to translate \" Arma virumque\ncano \" (see p. I7l), but as a \"message\" to be given to Mrs.\nVerrall it was\u2014unlike \" jSTeptune \" and \" Troy \"\n\u2014suggested by\nMr. Dorr. On the following day (March 10th) it is again\nreferred to, but without remark, in a list of messages to be\ntaken to Mrs. Verrall. Tlie next reference is on March 23rd\n(the sitting so important in connection with \" Troy \"). Mr.\nDorr is questioning the trance-personalities about what messages\nhave been taken :\n(HodgsoHp communicating.)\nG. B. D. Did you write \" Exile \" ?\nYes, long ago. It came out with Moore. MOORE.\nSimilarly on March 3 0th Mr. Dorr asks:\n<r. B. D. Exile, which you said had got through connected with the\nword Moore ?\nYes, both through.\nAnd again at different sittings in April it is said to have\nbeen given, and is finally ticked off as complete by Mr. Dorr\non April 21st, together with Neptune and Troy, and also\nwith a number of other words and phrases, of most of which\nwe find no trace. This is recorded as follows\n(Myersp communicating.)\nNow we will tur-n to messages.\n(G. B. D. takes record of April 14th and reads over the\nmessages then declared to be finished, the hand assenting\nto the list as it is read through.

The two pieces of script run\nas follows :\nJ2ml 27fh, 1908.\nAn open book.\nDominus illuminatio mea.^\nA golden harp\u2014the harp that once through Tara's halls\nThe lute with a single string Watts' picture -\nMciT\/ mh, 1908.\nBy the waters of Babylon\nthe song of exile in a strange land\u2014singing in a tongue\nunknown\nbut the music is sweet and music is a universal language\nGaray Mekon no it is useless\nThe harps upon the willow write that too\nthe harp that once through Tara's halls\na seven stringed lute the lute of Orpheus\nEurydice clamat\nThe first part of this second script is, of course, a reminiscence\nof the 137th Psalm, which runs:\nBy the waters of Babylon, there we sat down.\nYea, we wept when we remembered Zion.\n1 The motto of Oxford University. An open book is part of the Oxford\nArms.\n-The picture by Watts which these words first suggest is the well-known\nrepresentation of Hope \u2014a woman lilindfolded seated on a sphere, and playing\non a lute with a single string, which is an important feature in the picture.\nBut it is worth noting that there is a picture by Watts of Orpheus and\nEurydice, painted in 1869, and now hanging in the Watts Gallery at Compton,\nin which Orpheus holds a lute with all the strings broken but one.\nIf Mr. Piddingtou is right in thinking that Watts' picture of Orpheus and\nEurydice was in the mind of Myersp (see above, pp. 130, 132) it would be interest-\ning to find it also alluded to in Miss Verrall's script ; and the fact that the\nline from Moore leads on to Orpheus in her script of May 16th, makes it\ntempting to assume the same association of ideas on April 27th. Miss Verrall\nhad not seen the picture of Orpheus and Eurydice in question.\n\f188 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

In\nMiss Verrall's script of May 16tli we have, combined with\nExile and the quotation from Moore, the words and ideas of\nmusic, of harp, and of Orpheus and Eurydice. Music and harp\nare naturally connected, and harp is the common idea con-\nnecting Exile, Moore, and Orpheus\u2014if we admit that harp\neasily leads to lute, as it seems to do in both the above\nscripts of Miss Verrall's.\"'' Now the words \" music \" and \" harp\n\"\nare both claimed by Myersp as successful \" messages,\" and as\nregards \" harp,\" Miss Verrall is named at one point as the\nautomatist concerned. On May 4th, when in reading over to\nthe Piper trance-personalities a list of words and phrases\nthat had been agreed on at a previous sitting as messages to\nbe transmitted, Mr. Dorr comes to \" the Cave of Sleep with\nthe name of Morpheus associated with it,\" MyerSp immediately\nwrites \" I wrote harp,\" and a drawing of a harp is made.\nIn Mr. Piddington's paper on the Lethe incident (see above,\npp. 104-20) it will be seen that there is a possible reason for a\nconnexion by the trance-personalities of Morpheus and Orpheus,\nand moreover at one point in the waking-stage of March 31st\nMrs. Piper seems to confuse or combine the names, for she says\n\" Eurydice, Morpheus and Eurydice.\" I think, therefore, that\nit may not unfairly be said that harp is connected in the\nPiper script with Orpheus, though somewhat indirectly.

I said, chain him down and\nlet them feed on his liver.i I said fire,! j g^id music, I\nsaid, say Princess Sappho, at her feet a wreath of laurel.\nIn this last passage \" music \" also appears, and this is the\nonly place where music is definitely stated to be a subject\nof cross-correspondence ; it was, however, mentioned in a\nprevious waking-stage (March 30), and then in more or less\nconnexion with Orpheus (see Mr. Piddington's paper, p. 105).\nWe have then in Miss Verrall's script Exile, Music, Harp,\nMoore, and Orpheus, connected together ; and in Mrs. Piper's\ntrance four of these are claimed as cross-correspondences, while\nExile is connected with Moore, and harp and perhaps music\nwith Orpheus.\nPharaoh's Daughter.\nIt will be remembered that in the waking-stage of March\n23rd, 1908 (see p. 184), after mentioning Mercury and a cross\nwith ivy over it, Mrs. Piper says, apparently d propos of nothing :\n\"Pharaoh's daus-hter came out of the water.\" On March 30th\nMr. Dorr reads over his notes of what was said in the\nwaking-stage of March 23rd to the trance-personalities, with a\nview to getting explanations.\n(MyerSp communicating.)\n<jc.

The latter part of this script runs\nThe garden of the sun the golden apples that the dragon guarded\nWho stole the apples froward mortal Hesperides three nymphs\nno no go not to Lethe ^ and the river of wailing too\nUpon the shore they stood and stretched their arms.\nNow it is natural enough, considering the tendency of Miss\nVerrall's script to refer to classical subjects, that it should\nmention either the apples of the garden of the Hesperides, or\nthe river of Lethe ; but there is no obvious reason why they\nshould be combined. It is therefore interesting to find a\npossible reason for their combination in both topics having\nbeen mentioned in the sitting with Mrs. Piper on April 22nd,\n1908. Mr. Dorr on that day suggested Lethe as a message\nin association with Morpheus and the Cave of Sleep.- Later\nin the sitting, the following incident occurred\n(Myersp communicating.)\nMrs. Verrall has written a few verses from Browning which\nI, Myers, gave her recently from Euripides.

There had been, as readers of Proceedings,\nVol. XXII.i know, references to the Hercules Furens in Mrs.\nVerrall's script of a year before (March 4th and 25th, 1907);\nand in Mrs. Holland's script of the same period (April 16th,\n1907) there had been a quotation, or rather a reminiscence of\nBrowning's poem, Aristophanes' A2Jology, of which the translation\nof the Hercules Furens is a part. But in these scripts, of which\nMrs. Piper at this time knew nothing, there is no reference to\napple.\" \" Apple,\" however, is one of the cross-correspondences\npreviously attempted in the set of sittings we are now dealing\nwith, and the reference by Mr. Dorr to the golden apple would\nnaturally recall this. It is therefore impossible to say whether\nthere had previously been any connexion intended by Myersp\nbetween the \" apple \" taken as a message and the garden of\nthe Hesperides.\nThe first reference to \"Apple\" was on March l7th, thus:\nI said garden'^ and the word apple was inadvertently written.\nAgain, on Marcii 23rd (MyerSp communicating).\n<\\.

In the great majority of cases the trance-personalities\nclaim success, but in only about 2-J: ^ of them has anything\napproaching justification for the claim been discovered. This is,\nof course, quite in accordance with previous experience, and\nso is the fact that the degree of success, where there is any,\nvaries \"reatlv. I have described the cases which seem to me\nthe most successful, and we descend from them through various\ndegrees to the complete failures.\nI called attention in connexion with the Neptune case to\nthe strange contrast between the exactness of the correspondence\nverbally, and the erroneous and contradictory assertions as to\nwho has received and reproduced the message, and when she\nhas clone so. Neptune, which is spoken of as to be written in\nthe future by Mrs. Verrall, had, as a matter of fact, been\nwritten by Miss Verrall before it was mentioned by Mrs. Piper's\ntrance-personalities at all ; and we have no reason to think\nthat it was written by any automatist we are acquainted with\nafterwards. Pharaoh's daughter, on the other hand, which is\nspoken of as written by Mrs. Verrall months before, is not\nwritten till months after, and then by Miss Verrall. And\n^ The number is a little indefinite, because it is sometimes difficult to decide\nwhether a message in which two words are linked together (as e.g. in Joy\nand Troy) is to count as one or two. I have counted it as one when the\nstatement about the linking seems clear.\n-In these 24 I include the cases to which I shall refer presently, of\n\u2022emergence in Miss Verrall's and Mrs. Holland's script after Mrs. Verrall\nhad studied the records.\nN\n\f194 Mrs. Henry Sidgwide. [part\nTroy and joy, Exile with Moore, are neither of them written\ntill some day^ after it has been asserted in the Piper script\nthat they have got through. This same ignorance as to writer\nand date, accompanied by confident assertion, appears in the\nless clear correspondences as well, and success is claimed with\nequal confidence in the cases where there seems to be no\ncorrespondence at all. Erroneous guesses confidently expressed\nmay, as I have already said, be sometimes due to the known\nreluctance of the subliminal consciousness to admit inability to\nanswer questions. But sometimes the assertions are made\ngratuitously without any question being asked by Mr. Dorr.\nWith so much confusion as to date and persons it is\ndifficult to make any coherent theory as to the processes\ninvolved ; and I think the matter must be left there for the\nmoment as one of the puzzles which seem at present to\nstand in the way of a solution of the problems before us,\nbut which may ultimately help to furnish a clue.\nIt is perhaps worth noting that in the cases I have de-\nscribed, with the partial exception of \" Exile,\" the idea to be\nconveyed is chosen by the Piper trance-personalities\u2014not by\nMr. Dorr. Of the whole number of 80 \"messages\" about\ntwo-fifths are initiated by Mr. Dorr, and the rest by the\nPiper trance-personalities.\nIt may be noticed also that Miss Verrall is the partner\nin these successful experiments. This is true also of the\nmajority of the more doubtful correspondences occurring within\nsix months of the Piper sittings in question. Mrs. Verrall was\nmuch more often referred to by the Piper trance-personalities,\nbut her script shows very little, if any, correspondence with\nMrs. Piper's.\nConnexion with Mrs. Holland's Script. ..\nMrs. Holland, as it happens, was doing very little automatic\nwriting during the spring and summer of 1908. She only wrote\non March 4th, March 10th, and July 23rd. There is nothing\nconnected with Mr. Dorr's sittings in the scripts of March 4th\nand 10th. But in the course of the script of July 23rd\ncomes the reference to Seven, which must be read in connexion\nwith references by Mrs. Piper to \" We are seven \" on May 8th\n\fLX.] Cross- Correspondences. 195\nand 12th, and by Miss Verrall to the number seven on\nMay 11th. Miss Johnson has dealt fully with this episode in\nher paper below (pp. 222-258), and I need not enlarge on it now.\nI have not included it in enumerating the messages above only\nbecause it was not claimed on Mrs. Piper's side as a \" message\n\"\nquite so definitely as they were. After July 23rd Mrs. Hol-\nland's next script was produced on November 25th, 1908, and\non this and several subsequent days up to April 14th, 1909,\nthere are passages in the script that look like references to the\n\" messages \" of Mr. Dorr's sittings\u2014in two cases with a distinct\nreference to Mr. Dorr or to Mrs. Piper.^ Before the middle of\nNovember, however, Mrs. Verrall had read and made notes on\nthe records of Mr. Dorr's sittings, so that her mind had\nbecome a possible source of telepathic information, and the\ncomplication of the problem is increased.\nIn this connexion it is interesting to note that in a piece\nof script produced by Miss Verrall on November 12th, 1908,\nin the presence of Mrs. Verrall, after the latter had read Mr.\nDorr's records,\"-^ but when Miss Verrall was ignorant of them,\ntwo of the subjects of \" messages \"\n\u2014Iris and Palm branches\nemerged.^ The relevant part of the script is as follows\n[Drawing of the flower Iris] blue and purple and green spikes\nnuntius ipse ab alio emissus haec per terras.'*\nA bough of green leaves palm leaves to strew upon the way when\nthe time was ripe palm leaves super sethera notus ^ fame the palm of\nfame that is the thought.\nThe references to Iris, the messenger of the gods, in the\nPiper sittings will be found in Mr. Piddington's paper above,\n^ These cases will be discussed in a future paper.\n-Mrs. Verrall first heard of these sittings on October 18th, 1908.

At the same time I think\nit is difficult to suppose that the reference to me in this\nconnexion was entirely accidental, because, for reasons which\nI will explain presently, Comus was in my mind a good deal\nabout this time, and, moreover, while this is the only time I\nam referred to at all by the trance personalities in this series\nof sittings, Comus is, so far as I remember, the only subject\namong the many touched on that could with any appropriate-\nness be connected with me.\nThe story is this. The year 1908 was the tercentenary\nof Milton's birth and it was to be celebrated at his College\n\u2014Christ's College, Cambridge. Some of the younger members\nof the University arranged to perform the masque of Comus\non the occasion. It is usual at Cambridge in the performances\nof University dramatic clubs for all the parts\u2014female as well\nas male\u2014to be played by men. On this occasion, however, they\nwere anxious to introduce women, and as they also wished to\nbe able to say that the performers were students at the\nUniversity, I was approached to ascertain whether as Principal\nof Newnham College I would consent to certain students of\nthe College taking part. The important women's parts, it\nwill be remembered, are \" the lady,\" and Sabrina the water\nnymph. It was a new departure, and those who understand\nthe circumstances will realise that the question thus presented\nto me was one of those which, without being very important,\ngive a great deal of trouble to those who have to decide them,\nand that therefore Comus occupied my mind in a way it\ncertainly never did before. Exactly when the question first\ncame before me I cannot now remember, but it must, I\nthink, have been before the middle of May. The performance\ntook place early in July.\nIt certainly seems, therefore, as though events at Cambridge\nin England, or at least thoughts in the minds of persons\nthere, did somehow affect Mrs. Piper's trance personalities in\nAmerica. It is not necessary to suppose that there was\ntelepathic communication with me, for others, including Mrs.\nand Miss Verrall, were aware of my special interest in the\nsubject of Comits at that time.\n\f200 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich [part\nWith this I will conclude my paper. There were, as I\nhave said, many failures, and there are some more or less\nsuccessful cross-correspondences which I have not described.\nBut, apart from those with Mrs. Holland's script, to be discussed\nlater, the details of these would not, I think, either add materi-\nally to the weight of evidence, or throw new light on the\nprocesses involved.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Scrijjt. 201\nSECOND EEPOET ON MES. HOLLAND'S SCEIPT.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nIntroduction.\nIn my first report on the automatic writing of Mrs. Holland,\nwhich appeared in the Proceedings, Vol. XXI. (pp. 166-391),\na general account of the development of the case was given,\nwith a discussion not only of evidential incidents, but also of\na good many features that appeared to me instructive from a\npsychological point of view. For the general psychological\ncharacter of the case then I must refer my readers to the\nfirst report ; I propose to confine myself in this paper to\ncertain of the evidential or would-be evidential incidents\nbelonging to a period subsequent to the one there dealt with.\nThe period covered by this paper is a little over two years\nin length, namely, from June 2Jth, 1906, to July 23rd, 1908.\nDuring practically the whole of this period Mrs. Holland was\nin India, but it happens that the first script quoted was\nwritten while she was at sea on her way to India, and the\nlast one quoted was written while she was at sea on her way\nback to England.\nAll Mrs. Holland's scripts, with any communications that\nshe may have to make about them, are sent to me,-^ and are\nalways kept locked up in my office, so that no one but myself\nhas access to them.\nUp to Nov. 16th, 1906, Mrs. Verrall sent those of her\nscripts that were written on Wednesdays to me, (that being\n1 Except that during my visit to America in 1906 her scripts from July 13th\nto October 31st inclusive were sent to Mrs. Sidgwick, who gave them all to\nme on my return ; and Mr. Piddington has on one or two occasions written to-\niler direct to make enquiries on certain points in her script connected with\nhis paper on \"A Series of Concordant Automatisms\" in Proceedings, Vol. XXII.\n\f202 Alice Johnson. [part\nthe regular weekly day for Mrs. Holland to write), and her\nother scripts to Sir Oliver Lodge. After this date she sent\nthem all to Mr. Piddington, he being in charge of the English\nsittings with Mrs. Piper which were then beginning. Except\nfor an interval during 1907 when Mrs. Verrall's scripts were\nsent to me, Mr. Piddington continued to receive them up to\nthe end of 1907, from which date onwards they have always\nbeen sent to me.\nMiss Verrall's scripts, when she first began to write, were\nkept by her mother. Occasionally when a script of hers\nseemed likely to have evidential value, it was sent with\nMrs. Verrall's to Sir Oliver Lodge. Afterwards all Miss Verrall's\nscripts were sent to Mr. Piddington from Nov. 20th, 1906,\nto the end of 1907, (except for an interval during 1907\nwhen I received them), after which date they have all been\nsent to me.\nEach recipient has kept the scripts locked up, as long as\nthey remained in his or her possession, and the whole of\nboth Mrs. and Miss Verrall's scripts from the beginning\nhave now been put into my charge and are kept in my\noffice.\nBoth Mrs. and Miss Verrall have been accvistomed to make\ncopies of their scripts before sending them away, and at stated\nintervals they compare notes to see what correspondences, if\nany, have occurred between their scripts. The dates of com-\nparison are always noted and the observations and inter-\npretations made then or at any future time are always\nrecorded with their dates, so that the writers can always state\nat any given date what knowledge of each other's previous\nscripts they then possess.\nIn regard to correspondences between Mrs. Holland's and\nMrs. Verrall's scripts, or traces of telepathy between them, I\nused occasionally, as stated in my first report, to send each\nof them a copy of the other's script (always, of course,\nrecording the date and exactly what was sent) so that she\nmight tell me if anything in it referred correctly to her.\nDuring the period covered by this paper, I sent copies of\nonly nine pieces of Mrs. Verrall's script to Mrs. Holland, all\nwritten between April 18th and August 1st, 1906, and of\nthese only one, viz, that of June 20th,, 1906, turned out to be\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 203\nconnected with Mrs. Holland's. This is the script quoted below\nunder the Cross-correspondence entitled \" Janiculum \" ; but it\ndid not reach Mrs. Holland in India until some time after\nher corresponding script (that of June 24th) was written, and\nshe saw no point in it when she did read it.\nAt different intervals I have shown Mrs. Verrall portions\nof Mrs. Holland's script, but always noting when I did so.\nConsequently the degree of Mrs. Verrall's knowledge of Mrs.\nHolland's script at any given time is always ascertainable,\nand is mentioned in my reports whenever it bears on the\nevidence.\nIt is noteworthy that all Mrs. Verrall's scripts quoted in\nthe first part of this paper were written on Wednesdays, the\ndays on which she was trying for connections with Mrs. Holland,\nas recorded by her on each occasion at the time, except the\nscript of Sept. 20, 1906, about which a note in her record\nstates that, having omitted to write the day before, she had\nfixed her attention on Mrs. Holland that morning. On the\nother hand, some of the connections with Mrs. Verrall appear\nin Mrs. Holland's script on other days of the week.\nAs before, I am indebted to Mrs. Verrall for translations\nof the Latin and Greek, and information about the classical\nallusions, contained in her own and her daughter's scripts.\nAs to the question whether chance can account for all or\nany of the cross-correspondences, it is obvious that the data\nnecessary for any exact calculation of probabilities are entirely\nlacking, while a rough empirical judgment of what one might\nexpect to occur by chance can only be tentative and may\nbe quite untrustworthy. But in most of the cases which I\nhave here counted as cross-correspondences, the passages in\nthe scripts are marked out by some phrase which seems meant\nto call attention to them, such as, \" Eera ember the word and\nthe date \" ; or by some device such as the repetition of a\nword, or its being written in specially large letters. It is\nhere as if the intelligence guiding the script\u2014whether it be\nthe subliminal self of the automatist or some external intelli-\ngence\u2014is putting up a signal to apprise us of its intentions\nand the signal greatly reduces the probability that the coinci-\ndence is only due to chance. For it would be much more\nlikely, say, that a passage in Mrs. Holland's script should\n\f204 Alice Johnson.

Mrs.\nVerrall's script, however (which was no doubt partly inspired\nby the scenery of her surroundings), clearly alludes to St. Peter's\nChurch on the Vatican Hill, whereas Mrs. Holland speaks of the\nJaniculum. The two hills, the Vatican and Janiculum, are\nconnected topographically, in that they adjoin one another on\nthe west side of the Tiber, being both included in the regie\ntrans Tihcrinum of Augustus : there is, moreover, a St. Peter's\nchurch on the Janiculum as well as on the Vatican, both\nbeing\u2014according to different traditions\u2014the scene of St.\nPeter's martyrdom.\nMrs. Verrall's phrase \"But I have not made her see the\npoint of union between the mountain and St. Peter's rock\nis appropriate if applied to Mrs. Holland's mention of the\nJaniculum, for Mrs. Holland says nothing about St. Peter.\nIn his analysis of a later script of Mrs. Verrall's, that\nof March 25th, 1907, in connection with the experiments\nwith Mrs. Piper, Mr. Piddington speaks of certain analogies\nbetween Janus and St. Peter.- The script begins\n\" Claviger the bearer of the key and club. The Club and\nKey\u2014East and West.\"\nClaviger in the sense of Cluh-hcarcr is an epithet often\napplied to Hercules, who is referred to in the same script.\n1 Browning, The Lout Leader.\nProceeding.^ S.P.R., Vol. XXII. p. 255.\n\f206 Alice Johnson. [part\nClaviger in the sense of Kcy-hearcr, says Mr. Piddington, seems\nto be used only by Ovid in speaking of Janus, whose name\nis not mentioned in the script. Janus in this passage of\nOvid holds in his right hand a staff and in his left a key\nhe locks up vi^ar and sends forth peace ; he is the doorkeeper\nof the courts of heaven. Similarly St. Peter bears a staff as\nwell as a key, and he too is represented as the doorkeeper\nof heaven.\nJanus alone of all the gods looks with his double face upon\nboth the East and the West at the same time. St. Peter as\nan Oriental and by tradition the first bishop of the Western\nChurch may also be said to represent the union of the East\nand West.\nAt the time Mrs. Verrall wrote this later script about the\n\" key-bearer,\" she was aware of the cross-correspondence just\ndescribed between herself and Mrs. Holland when she wrote\nof the Vatican and Mrs. Holland of the Janiculum, but she\nhad only regarded it as a slight and vague connection, con-\nsisting merely in the mention of two adjoining hills. Mr.\nPiddington, with no reference whatever to the early scripts,\nworked out the implications in the later one, which I think\nthrow Iv'^X, back upon these.\nMr. Piddington now suggests (see his paper above, p. 22)\nthat a phrase in Mrs. Holland's script of March 27, 1907\n(quoted in full in Proceedings, Vol. XXII. p. 261), \"Peter is\nthe second one,\" is connected with Mrs. Verrall's of two days\nearlier, meaning that St. Peter is the second Clccviger. If so,\nthis would seem to confirm still further the cross-correspondence\nbetween the two scripts of 1906 with which I am now dealing.\nMrs. Verrall further points out to me that the two-headed\nJanus, who sees both the past and the future, may be regarded\nas a type or symbol of the \" Twin Eternities \" referred to\nin her script.\n\" Twin Eternities,\" as mentioned above, is a quotation from a\npoem of Mr. Myers's, in which it is used in a different sense,\nthe context being as follows\nMy soul in solitude her post has taken,\nBetween the two seas, on the narrowing bar, \u2014\nSees on each hand the stormful waters shaken,\nThe twin Eternities unite afar.\n\fLX.] Second Rejyort on Mrs. Holland's Script. 207\nThere 'mid faiths slain and idols shattered low,\nAnd many a fallen friend and fallen foe,\nShe waits by night the flooding tides to be.\nI would suggest, then, that while the main point of the\ncross-correspondence consists in a comparison between St. Peter\nand Janus,\u2014St. Peter being mentioned explicitly and Janus\nperhaps implicitly (through the \" twin Eternities \" and \" the\nmountain \" connected with \" St. Peter's rock \") in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript, and the Janiculum explicitly in Mrs. Holland's,\u2014there\nis also a subsidiary cross-correspondence in relation to Mr.\nMyers's poem ; for the thoughts expressed in the lines just\nquoted from it seem to be re-echoed in Mrs. Holland's script\nin the phrase, \" The final renouncement of the summit of\nbelief,\" and in her quotation from The Lost Leader. The\nimmediate context of this latter quotation, and the end of the\npoem, is as follows\nBest fight on well, for we taught him \u2014strike gallantly,\nMenace our heart ere we master his own\nThen let him receive the new knowledge and wait us\nPardoned in heaven, the first by the throne !\nHere we see that the Lost Leader, an instance of \" idols\nshattered low,\" is still regarded by his former followers as a\n\" fallen friend \" as well as a \" fallen foe.\"\nCeoss-Correspondence.\n\"Yellmv.\"\nThe next case is a slight and simple triple coincidence.\nMrs. Holland in India on Monday, August 6th, 1906,\ntowards the end of a rather long piece of script referring to a\nnumber of different topics, writes the following words, marked\noff from the rest by a space and a change in the hand-\nwriting :\ny e 1 0 [scribbles]\nyellowed ivory.\n\f208 Alice Johnson. '\n[part\nMrs. Verrall, on Wednesday, Aug. 8th, in Cambridge, writes\nI have done it to-night y yellow is the written word\nyellow\nyellow\nSay only yellow\nThe word \" yellow \" is written larger and more emphatically\neach time it occurs, and is distinctly claimed by Mrs. Verrall's\nscript as the word that was intended to appear. Such a\nclaim makes it, as I have said, much less likely that the\ncoincidence was merely accidental.\nMeanwhile Miss Verrall, who was writing at the same time\nand in the same room with her mother (each taking care not\nto see the other's writing) produced a script containing the\nfollowing sentence\nCamomile and resin the prescription is old on yellow paper in a\nbox with a sweet scent ,\n.\nMrs. and Miss Verrall were just then both writing on\nWednesdays with the express purpose of getting cross-corre-\nspondences with one another and with Mrs. Holland. On\nAugust 29th they for the first time compared the scripts thus\nproduced on Wednesdays of that August, and noted the word\n\" yellow \" as a possible attempt at a cross-correspondence on\nAug. 8th.

Hildesbruder is more like Sept. 21 is a date something has\nbeen hindered for this day. No more, I can't think.\nThis script correctly states that Mrs. Holland more than a\nweek before had had a warning of a supposed catastrophe to\ntake place on Sept. 21st, that this was somehow connected\nwith a person having a German name beginning with H.\n(? Hapsburg), and that the catastrophe would not after all come\noff on Sept. 21st. There is no indication on either side of\nany supernormal knowledge of the actual affairs of the Emperor\nof Austria. What is said about him in Mrs. Holland's script is\na mere guess, such as any one might have made, based on the\nnewspaper paragraph, so that if the prediction had been verified,\nno weight could have been attached to it. Mrs. Holland is\ninterested in public affairs and her script occasionally, though\nrarely, refers to them.

Whenever supernormal\nknowledge of persons has been shown, it is always about those\nin whom one or other of the controls purporting to influence\nthe script were personally interested, for instance, Sir Oliver\nLodge, Mr. Eoden Noel, the \" Mr. Grove \" mentioned in my\nfirst Report, Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Forbes, and Professor Maitland\nin the case given below (p. 217).\nB. AND THE Walnut Tree.\nHere knowledge seems to be shown in Mrs. Holland's script\nof some trivial matters connected with Mrs. Verrall. Mrs.\nHolland writes on Wednesday, Oct. 3rd, 1906 :\nA chill and windy day and the leaves are whirling in ray garden\nHardly worth while for B. to sweep them up when they fall so soon\nagain\u2014The big walnut has shed its leaves very early this year\nOn being shown this later, Mrs. Verrall wrote\nOn Sunday Sep. 30th and again on Tuesday Oct. \u20222ud and possibly\nThursday, Oct. 4 [the script having been written on Wednesday] I\nlooked for walnuts under the big tree in the [Trinity] Fellows'\nGarden, and noted how difficult they were to find, because the leaves\nhad fallen thickly with the fruit.\nMy gardener, Bowyer, has a passion for tidying, which annoys me\nmuch, especially when it leads to his sweeping up the leaves of our\nmaple trees. The leaves were finall}' swept away earlier than usual\nthis autumn, as we noticed when the bullfinches appeared on Nov. 20th.\nNote that \" B.\", mentioned in Mrs. Holland's script, is the\ninitial of Mrs. A^errall's gardener. No particular garden is\nspecified in the script, but while Mrs. Verrall and Mr. Myers\nwere both much interested in their own gardens, which were\nnear together, he used also frequently to meet her and Dr.\nVerrall in the Trinity Fellows' Garden.\nTwo or three other cases were given in my first report on\nMrs. Holland's script in which remarks about Mrs. Verrall's\ngarden (which Mrs. Holland has never seen) turned out rather\nstrikingly correct.^ By the time the one just quoted was\n'See also the \"pink may blossom on the trees near the drive\" in the case\ngiven below, p. 219.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 211\nwritten, Mrs. Holland knew of Mrs. Verrall's and Mr. Myers's\ntastes in this respect. It is therefore not unnatural that this\ntopic should be found in script much of which purports\u2014im-\nplicitly or explicitly\u2014to be influenced by Mr. Myers, and much\nof which is addressed\u2014implicitly or explicitly\u2014to Mrs. Verrall.\nIt is also possible that their joint interest in the subject may\ntend telepathically to the production by Mrs. Holland of correct\nstatements about it.\nCross-Correspondentce.\n\" Savonarola.\"\nThe next case is a triple cross-correspondence between Miss\nVerrall, Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall.\nMiss Verrall wrote on Saturday, Oct. 6th, 1906 (being\nthen at Bashley, Hants)\n{In Latin: Let the rest be silent; a single voice of one proclaira-\ning.)i She had not seen it before but memory was strong.\nReniembei' the word and the date.

Se\nre fio.Ky^oi.\nI find that Sav. led a procession round the square of S. Mark on\nXmas Day 1497. I then remembered a procession in Roinola and\nlooked it up. (I read li. in 1880-1882 and not since.) I find\n(Vol. II., Cliap. XLIIL, Unseen Madonna) an acct. of a jjrocession\non Oct. 30, 149G, on a bright day, long lines of monks, an image\ncarried. Can H.'s sc. be an attempt to represent that scene 1\nMrs. Verrall also thought that the phrase in her script,\n\" Only in the thoughts of the free,\" suggested a telepathic\nreflection of Miss Verrall's, \" Few are the initiated.\"\nIn the procession as described in Rumola there came first\na band of Florentine youth, bearing an image of Christ, then\nthe Companies of Discipline ; then the monks : first \" a white\nstream of reformed Benedictines [probably Carthusians] and\nthen a much longer stream of the Frati Minori or Franciscans,\nin that age all clad in grey . . . perhaps the most numerous\norder in Florence. . . . And after the grey came the black of\nthe Augustinians of San Spirito. . . . Then the white over dark\nof the Carmelites and then again the unmixed black of the\nServites. . . . [Next] black mantles over white scapularies\nand every one knew that tlie Dominicans were coming. . . .\nIn the long line of black and white there was at last singled\nout a mantle only a little more worn than the rest.\" The\nwearer of this was Savonarola and the crowd fell on their\nknees as he passed. Many other monks, secular priests, etc.,\nfollowed, and at the end of the procession was carried a hidden\nimage of the Madonna.\nIn Miss Verrall's script \" the long black robes, the candles\nand the images\u2014the bright sun and the gaping crowd \" are all\nappropriate to the scene in Romola, in which Savonarola\nmentioned by Mrs. Verrall\u2014was the most noted figure.\nMeanwhile Mrs. Holland, on Monday, Oct. 8th, i.e. on a\ndate intermediate between Miss Verrall's and Mrs. Verrall's\nscripts, wrote :\nAsk his daughter about the dream \u2014Grey monks of long ago\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 213\nConsidering how very frequently Mrs. Holland's script refers to\n]\\Irs. and Dr. Verrall, \" his daughter \" here may, I think, fairly\nbe interpreted as Miss Verrall, and the whole phrase suggests that\na cross-correspondence is being attempted, as is also suggested\nby Miss Verrall's phrase :\n\" Kemember the word and the date.\"\n\" Grey monks of long ago \" may then be regarded as Mrs.\nHolland's contribution to the cross-correspondence.\nIn the procession in question, as said above, the \" Franciscans,\nin that age all clad in grey,\" played a conspicuous part, so\nthat between the three scripts a fairly complete outline of the\n.procession seems to be given.\nCliOSS-CORRESPONDENCE.\nGreek Procession and Funeral.\nThe next case again concerns a procession, which is first\nmentioned in Mrs. Verrall's script of Wednesday, Oct. ord, 1906,\nwritten while travelling from London to Cambridge, as follows :\n{In Greek : IiDpeachment at first, and then disfranchisement and\nat last the penalty of death. )i\nThe sun shone in the north at midday {In Greek : Sing songs\nof good omen, all of you) - The propomps wave their torches {In\nGreek: Sing songs of good omen, all of you)\nOh tell the tale as it's told to j'ou Man is born to trouble as\nthe sparks fly upward. Perishing like the grass which to-day is\nand to-morrow is not.\nAfter this comes a reference to the funeral of Mr. Forbes,\n(the husband of the lady with whom so many of the cross-\ncorrespondences in Mrs. Verrall's early script were connected),\nshowing that the two last sentences quoted alluded to his\ndeath. Mrs. Verrall knew of his death, and that the funeral\nhad been arranged for this day at midday.\nThe first part of the script refers also, according to her own\ninterpretation noted on the script at the time, to a subject\nwith which her mind was then preoccupied,\u2014namely, the\nprocession in the closing scene of the Eumenidcs, which was\n^ ei(jayye\\ia to irpCoTov, elra. oe arifjla, Kal Tf\\os davarov f^Tj\/uia.\n'-\nev4>o.p.eiTe oe -Ko.vTes.\n\f214 Alice Johnson.

It is the pro-\npomps who \" sing songs of good omen.\"\nShe was at the time helping to arrange about the dresses\nfor the play, and one of her friends had, as she afterwards\nheard, called that afternoon to see her about it. Throughout\nthis term she was going to the rehearsals and helping in the\npreparations.\nMrs. Holland in India on Wednesday, Oct. l7th, 1906,\nwrote as follows :\nThe men with staves head the procession\u2014the lictors \u2014About\nhalf way comes the litter\u2014too heavy for the slaves that bear it\nGarlands\u2014but not of triumph \u2014What liquor do those great jars\ncontain What unguent that golden vase \u2014Where is the altar for\nthis sacrifice\nThe noonday sun has dimmed the torches flare\nHere then is a description of some kind of classical pro-\ncession, though the introduction of lictors suggests a Roman,\nnot a Greek scene. The litter may possibly be a funeral\nlitter, for in connection with it there are \" Garlands\u2014but\nnot of triumph.\" But Miss Verrall, on reading the proofs\nof this case, suggested to me that the latter part of the\nscript might be founded on reminiscences of Keats's Ode on\na Grecian Urn, the fourth stanza of which begins thus :\nWho are these coming to the sacrifice?\nTo what green altar, O mysterious priest,\nLead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,\nAnd all her silken flanks with garlands dresf?\nThis verse, like the script, contains the words, garlands, altar,\nand sacrifice, and the interrogative form is characteristic in both.\nThe last sentence, \" The noonday sun has dimmed the\ntorches' flare,\" may possibly be interpreted as a symbolic\nallusion to the Uumenides, namely, to the triumph of Apollo\nover the Furies, the offspring of Night, whose dwelling is in\n^ TrdvTes (all) should be 7racoa|Ui' (uuiversall)').\n-The part of the script here omitted relates, as interpreted, to Professor\nMaitland, and is quoted below, p. 217.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 215\nthe nether regions, lit only by torches, and who are led off at\nthe end of the play in a torchlight procession down to the\ncave under the Areopagus. Whether this interpretation be a\nfanciful one or not, the sentence has at least a considerable\nresemblance to Mrs. Verrall's phrases :\n\" The sun shone in the north at midday. The propomps\nwave their torches,\"\nand the whole script seems to represent a generalised conception\nof an ancient procession, possibly connected with a funeral\nwhereas in Mrs. Verrall's script the two topics of the pro-\ncession and the funeral are separate and disconnected.\nI wrote to Mrs. Holland on March 8th, 1907, saying that\nher script contained a description of a procession which we\ntook to refer to the Eununides which was performed at\nCambridge in the autumn of 1906, and asking if she had seen\nany references to the performance in the papers. She replied on\nMarch 26th, 1907, that she had no recollection of seeing any\nreferences to the Enmenidcs in the papers.\nCross-Correspondence.\nThe Blue Flower.\nThe next case is a straightforward and simple connection\nbetween the scripts of Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall.\nMrs. Holland on Wednesday, Oct. 24th, 1906, after a rough\ndrawing of a flower, writes, in a line by itself and in a rather\npeculiar hand :\nThe Blue Flower.\nMrs. Verrall's script of the same day seems to be an elaborate\nvariation on this theme\nThe blue is to be preferred Blue is lier colour\nI\nThen come some verses, all on the same topic, of which I will\nonly quote the first and last]\nLove in a mist lay dying\nHis heart blood stained the earth\nWith Cupid's arrows flying\nDeparted joy and mirth\n\f216 Alice Johnson. [part\nWhere others see tlie flower\nBkie, in a tangled grey\nHe knows in Love's own bower\nThe god they thought to slay.\n[\" He \" being apparently the lover. By the side of these verses is\nwritten :]\nThat is the story of Love in a Mist and Love lies bleeding\u2014the\nlittle Love is in the heart of the misty blue veiled flower Let him\nthat has eyes see.\nMrs. Verrall's phrase, \" Blue is her colour,\" may perhaps be\ninterpreted to mean that something' l)lue is the subject of an\nattempted cross-correspondence.\nThe Poison Bottle.\nOn JSTovember 7tb, 1906, in the middle of a script treating\nof a variety of topics, Mrs. Holland wrote :\nOn the ledge of the squarish \u2014no oblong window is not a safe\nplace for that solution\u2014Of course you cannot consider poisons\nout of place in a laborator}^ \u2014but there is not enough locking up\nthis one should be locked up\u2014Towards the end of the room\u2014to\nyour left\u2014an actinic green bottle.\nI took this to refer to Sir Oliver Lodge, who is not\ninfrequently mentioned in the script,^ and I sent it to him\nfor comment on February 26th, 1907, together with two other\nslighter and vaguer passages in the script of two later dates.\nHe replied to me\nThe one on 7 Nov., 1906, about the poison bottle.\n.\nThis I find is remarkably correct. My two youngest boys have\na laboratory adjacent to the house \u2014not at the college at all\u2014and\nthere they do photography, make explosives, and many other things.\nThe other night when we were all to<rether I asked them whether\nthey had a green bottle of poison in that laboratory, and the elder\nsaid, yes. It is on the bench, quite accessible, not on the ledge of\nthe oblong window, but near it, and on the left. He says it has\nbeen there nearly all the winter, and is Mercuric Chloride which\nthe Doctor gave him for a lotion, \u2014not one of their own chemicals.\n'\nSee, e.g., my first Report, pp. 207, 241, 277-8.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland'.s Script. 217\nI have told him that it must be either thrown away or locked up.\nHe agrees that it is too accessible, since the j'ounger sisters sometimes\nenter the same laboratory.\nProfessok Maitland.\nThe next case consists of apparent allusions in Mrs. Holland's\nscript only to the illness and death of Professor F. W. Mait-\nland, Downing Professor of the Laws of England, at Cambridge.\nHis name, though of course well known at Cambridge and\nOxford and to scholars of Law and History throughout the\nworld, was probably not familiar to the general public, and\nMrs. Holland, as she afterwards told me, believed that she\nhad never heard of him until she read the notice of his death\nin the papers. He was a special friend of Dr. and Mrs. Verrall's\nalso of Dr. Sidgwick's, Mr. Myers's and Dr. Myers's.\nHe had very delicate health and for some years had spent\nthe winter months in the Canary Islands. He went there as\nusual at the end of the Michaelmas Term, 1906, and died there\non Dec. 19th.\nOn Oct. l7th, 1906, Mrs. Holland in India wrote as\nfollows :\n[Wednesday, 12.30 p.m. Oct. 17th, 1906.]\nNina\u2014A.

[part\n\" Downing \" is written in a line by itself, as if to attract atten-\ntion. As said above, Professor Maitland was Downing Professor\nof the Laws of England, and he also lived at Downing College.\nThe description of the voyage may perhaps be taken to refer\nto his journey to the Canary, which his friends at that time\nknew was to be undertaken as usual. There was very stormy\nweather the day before he started, and he was taken ill with\npneumonia on the voyage. He did not, however, travel by the\nCedric, this being a White Star American liner.\nTn regard to the misquotation from Pioden Noel's poem, it\nmay be noted that tlie change in the wording makes it slightly\nmore appropriate to Professor Maitland's circumstances at the\nmoment, since he was shortly to cross the sea on what turned\nout to be his last voyage.\nThe signature \" A. T. M.\" no doubt refers to Dr. A. T. Myers,\nand I take \" A.\" to mean Dr. Verrall, since he is generally\nreferred to in Mrs. Holland's script as \"A. W.\" or \"A.\" The\ncombination here of the name \"Downing\" with A. and A. T. M.\nseems to indicate clearly the pej'son referred to, the three men\nbeing contemporaries and intimate friends. Or at least it is\ncertain that the person whom Dr. and Mrs. Verrall would\nassociate with \"Downing\" College would be Professor Maitland,\nsince he was the only one of their friends living at that\nCollege, and Dr. Verrall often went to Downing to see him.\nIt happened that he had gone on the day of the script,\nbein\" a little an.xious because Professor Maitland had not come\nto see them on the previous Sunday, as was his usual custom.\nHe found him well after the slight attack which had pre-\nvented his calling on the Sunday. This corresponds with the\nsentence in the script, \" This will be a slight attack and a\nvery brief one,'' whereas the general drift of the script may\nbe supposed to reflect Dr. and Mrs. Verrall's knowledge that\nin Professor Maitland's state of health any illness was a matter\nfor anxiety.\nAll this information was supplied to me by Mrs. A^errall\na few weeks after Professor Maitland's death, the dates being\nverified from her diary. I did not at the time of receiving\nthe script associate it with Professor Maitland at all, and Mrs.\nVerrall did not see it or know anything about it until Jan.\n29th, 1907. Consequently no comment had been made by\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 219\nme to Mrs. Holland on the earlier script before she produced\nthe later one, which was written on the day of Professor\nMaitland's death, Dec. 19th, 1906, as follows:\nPace. Pax\u2014It is only in appearance that the life appears\nunduly brief or all too swiftly terminated in reality the wheel had\nrun full circle\u2014\n\"Into a darkness quieted l)y hope.\"^\nPink may blossom on the trees near the drive \u2014Qui bien ayme\ntard oublye.\nH. December \"2 1st \u2014don't you remember'?\nM.\n^ .\n[Tlie passages omitted refer to other topics.]\nIn regard to this script, it may be noted : Professor ]\\Iaitland\nwas 56 at the time of his death.\nThere is a pink may tree near the drive up to the door of\nMrs. Verrall's house, which Mrs. Holland has never seen.\n\" H \" probably means Dr. Hodgson.\n\"M\" is ambiguous. It might mean Mr. Myers, but he is\ngenerally designated by \"P.\" This \" M.\" is written in a\npeculiar way, as if to indicate some new \" M.\" If we take it\nto mean Professor Maitland and \" H ''\nDr. Hodgson, the sentence\n\"December 21st\u2014don't you remember?\" becomes significant, for\nit was on Dec. 21st of this year, as Mrs. Verrall afterwards\ntold me, that she heard of Professor Maitland's death, whereas on\nDec. 21st of the previous year she had heard of Dr. Hodgson's\ndeath. This date is also her birthday.\nThus, though there is no exact specification of the person\nreferred to, all these passages are very appropriate to Professor\nMaitland's death, which took place in the night of Dec. 19th-\n20th, the script having been produced at 5.45 p.m. in India,\nwhich is equivalent to about 11 a.m. in the Canary Isles. Xews\nof the death was received in Cambridge, as just said, on Dec.\n21st, and it was in the papers on Dec. 22nd. The news was\n^ Browning, Sordello.\n\f220 Alice Johnson. [part\nalso, as I learnt later from Mrs. Holland, telegraphed to India;\nbut as her script earne enclosed in a letter bearing the Indian\npostmark Dec. 20th, it is, I tliink, impossible that she could\nhave heard of it before sending the script. She told me\nthat she thought the date when she saw the news was Dec.\n22nd or 23rd, and (in reply to a question) that she had never\nheard of the Downing Professorship.\nI may add that though the script of Oct. l7th quoted above\nmight be regarded as premonitory of the death, it resembles\nmost so-called premonitions in affording no evidence of any\nreal fore-knowledge of the future ; for all the circumstances\nalluded to were known at the time to Professor Maitland's\nfriends, who were well aware of the precarious state of his\nhealth.\nScript of 1 0 07.\nThe evidential incidents in Mrs. Holland's script of this\nperiod have already been dealt with by Mr. Piddington in\nhis report on the sittings with Mrs. Piper in England from\nNovember, 1900, to June, 1907. (See \"A Series of Con-\ncordant Automatisms,\" Proceedings, Vol. XXII.)

Mrs. Piper gave the word Thanatos (Death)\nfirst (not quite correctly) on April l7th, 1907,^ and repeated\nit (correctly) on April 23rd and oOth. Mrs. Verrall on April\n29th produced a script containing several references to death,\npartly in English and partly in Latin. Mrs. Holland on\nApril IGth wrote as follows:\nMaurice. Morris. Mors.\nAnd with that the shadow of death fell upon him and his soul\ndeparted out of his limbs.\nThe most agreeable sensation of which I was at first conscious\nwas that I was no longer deaf.\n[This statement is signed with two initials]\n1875.\n\" All are not taken there are left behind\nLiving Bidoveds tender looks to bring.\"-\nOne steep sharp ledge of ice above the grey green glacier streaked\nAvitli ding}' snow\u2014\n\"No sounds save at moments\nThe mountain bee's hum\nI come oh ye forests\nYe mountains I come.\" ^\n\" Maurice \" was the name of a friend of Mrs. Holland's, who\nhad died many years before.\nThe initials omitted above are those of a literary man,\nunknown personally, and but little known by reputation, to\nMrs. Holland. She had not identified them, and when I first\ntold her whom they represented, she could not remember that\nshe had ever heard of him ; later she recollected the name of\none of his books. He had died about three years previously,\nand I think it probable that she had seen an obituary notice\nof him at the time. The date mentioned, 187\"), was the year\n'\nSee Mr. Pidtlington's note on this above, p. 30.\n-E. B.

In a letter written shortly afterwards, which\nis quoted in his Li\/e,'^ he says :\n\" I liave still much left to\nme. . . . There is my little girl and my sister-in-law . . . and\nmy own sister.\" The quotation that follows the date in the\nscript is therefore very appropriate. The second quotation is\nalso appropriate, as he was a noted Alpine climber; the intention,\ndoubtless, is to make the identification of the man still more\ncertain.\nThe idea of death is thus more prominent throughout the\nscript than Mr. Piddington represented it to be.\nCross-Cokrespondence.\nSeve7is.\nThis is an elaborate case in which, not only was the subject\nof the cross-correspondence \" Seven,\" but six automatists,\u2014namely,\nMrs. Piper, Mrs. and Miss Verrall, Mrs. Frith (a friend of\nMrs. A^errall's), Mrs. Holland, and Mrs. Home,\u2014and another\nperson, making seven in all, were concerned in it.\n(1) 3frs. Piper.\nThe following are extracts from the records of Mr. Dorr's\nsittings with Mrs. Piper in America.\nOn April 21st, 1908, and again on April 27th and May 4th,\nMr. J3orr, with a view to reviving the memories of Hodgsoup,\nhad repeated to him the following set of Latin verses which\nused to be printed on special occasions on the menus of the\nTavern Club in Boston.^\nMeum est propositum in Taberna mori\nEt vinum appositum sitienti ori\nUt dicant cum venerint Angelorum choii\nDeus sit propitius isti potatori.'^\n1 Tliis had been published towards the end of 1906, but I have reasons for\nVielieving that Mrs. Holland had not seen it.\n-See Mrs. Verrall's paper above, p. 78, foot-note, for a discussion of this\nexperiment and explanation of its non-evidential character.\n5 Translation. It is my intention to die at the Inn and to have wine served\nto my thirsty lips, so that the band of angels may say when they come, \"May\nGod be propitious to this drinker.\"\n\fLX.] Second Report on 3Irs. Holland's Script. 223\nOn May 8th Hodgsonp, who had already given translations\nof two or three words in the verses, spontaneously gave in\none continuous sentence the following nearly correct rendering\nof the whole :\nIt is my habit at the inn, according to custom, when serving wine\nto my thirsty lips, when the angel band comes to say \" May God\nbe propitious to this one.\"\nNote that jrrojmsitum (intention) is here wrongly translated\n\" habit \" and viori (to die) is wrongly translated \" according\nto custom.\" These mistranslations are of importance in relation\nto the cross-correspondence, as explained later (see p. 257).\nThe subject was resumed in the waking-stage of this day as\nfollows :\nWal'ing-Stage, May 8fh, 1908.\n(The first word that becomes intelligible is \" Habit ; the other\nwords that went with this could not be caught, but probably were\na fresh attempt ... to translate the Latin verses).\nWe are Seven\nI said Clock !

Tick, tick, tick ; Stairs,\" no doubt\nrefer to Longfellow's poem The Old Clock on the Stairs. The\nword \" tick \" does not occur in this poem, but it has the\nrefrain, \" Forever, never, Never, forever.\"\n\" Angel band 1 my toast to you \" refers to the Latin\nverses.\nFor comments on the words \" Habit \" and \" tick,\" see\nbelow, pp. 245, 257.\n^ R.

[part\nSifting of May I2fh, 1908.\n[Tlie first part of this sitting was taken up with a further\nattempt to obtain a translation of the Latin verses ; then Mr. Dorr\nproceeded to read over to the trance-personalities what had been\nsaid in the waking-stage of the previous sitting :]\n(i. B. D. The first thing she said was \"We are seven.\"\nTiiat is Wordsworth, but we tvere seven in the distance as a\nmatter of fact.\nG. B. D. Then she said \" Clock, etc.\"\nWas it confusion ^ I do not recall saying anything about\nclock.\nG. B. D. It evidently referred to Longfellow's poem, and it may have\ncome out of Mrs. P.'s own mind.\nI do not know what it meant. Possibly . . .\nG. B. D. The next thing she said was \"(how old along with me.\nMrs. Verrall wrote it.\"\nMr. Myers gave it to Mrs. Verrall. Quite right . . .\nG. B. D.

Then she said \"St. Paul.\"\nYes with [Mrs. Forbes] and others\nAn attempt to explain the message about the \" Clock \" was\nmade in the waking-stage on May :^6th, 1908, as follows:\n\" It was the message about the clock they gave me. Mrs.\nA^'eirall said, '\nGo tell Mr. Dorr the clock strikes one, and Ave\nMaria.'\n\"\nI may state at once that Mrs. A^errall did not get the\nquotation \" Grow old along with me,\" nor any reference to\na clock, in her script of this period.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 225\nThe cliief point in the extract from the record of Mrs.\nPiper's sitting of May 12th lies in the number Seven. \"We\nare Seven\" had been quoted on May 8th; to this is now\nadded the rather enigmatic phrase, \" We incrc seven in the\ndistance as a matter of fact,\" which, after comparing with\nMrs. Holland's script quoted below (p. 238), I take to mean that\nseven persons are concerned in the cross-correspondence. Note\nalso the threefold repetition of the number, which seems in-\ntended to lay further stress on it :\n\" Seven of us\u20147\u2014Seven.\"\n(2) Mrs. VcrraU.\nAll Mrs. Verrall's scripts here quoted were written at\nCambridge, except that of May Sth, 1908, which was written\nin the course of a journey from London to Cambridge.\nOn April 20th, 1908, her script referred to \"the seven\nhills \" of Eome.^ The next one was as follows :\nApril 27, 1908.\n[scrawl] and later too \u2014Do not try to attend\n37603\n7\n6\n72\nTry again\n3\n7\n6\n41\n13 + 3 17\n\u2014 361\n^ 16\n495\nI can't do anything but these figures They seem to be wanted\nbut I can't tell why.\nNote that in all three groups of figures the numbers 3, 7, 6\noccur, and compare with Mrs. Holland's script and dream, quoted\nbelow.\n^ She noted next day that April 21st was the date of the founding of Rome, a\ndate very familiar to her from her girlhood.\nP\n\f226 Alice Johnson.

I had\nbeen reading the last four or five cantos of Dante's Pargatorio.\nM. de G. V. May 8th, 1908. 2.30 p.m.\"\nThe poem no doubt refers, as Mrs. Verrall observed, to Virgil,\nand it seems equally clear that it was prompted by her reading\nof the Purgatorio. She did not, however, notice until I pointed\nthe fact out to her some months later, that it is in the metre\nof Mr. Myers's St. Paul (which happens to be much more\nfamiliar to me than to her), and is closely imitated from that\npoem ;\ne.g. cf. the last line of her second verse with Mr.\nMyers's line,\n\" Faint for the flaming of thine advent feet.\"\nand note in the script the alliterations which are so charac-\nteristic a feature of St. Paul.\nMrs. Piper, as stated above, in the waking-stage of May 8 th,\n1908, in close conjunction with Mrs. Verrall's name, uttered\nthe words :\n\"St. Paul\u2014Light\u2014Life\u2014Angel band,\"\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 227\nwhereas the second line of Mrs. Verrall's poem in imitation of\nSt. Paul is\n\" Lighted the nations on the way to life.\"\n\" Angel band \" I have already explained as an allusion\nto the Latin verses read by Mr. Dorr to Hodgsoni^. This\nseems to be the primary intention of the words. But\nin view of the connection presently to be explained between\nMrs. Verrall's script and Miss Verrall's of May 11th, with\nwhich, again, Mrs. Piper's is connected, I am inclined to think\nthere may be a secondary intention, and that the words\n\" Angel band \" also refer to the third verse of Mrs. Verrall's\npoem.\nThe wording of the first half of this verse is clearly derived\nfrom Isaiah Lii. 7, How beautiful upon the mountains are\nthe feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\" But the con-\nnection with Virgil and Dante implies that something more is\nmeant, and the further description of the messengers, as\n\" Borne far aloft on oarage of their high wings\nGlorious shining in majestic grace,\"\nsuggested to me the souls descending on the Jacob's ladder of\nthe Paradiso (see Miss Verrall's script of May 11th below);\nfor this was a vision not for Virgil's eyes, since he left Dante\nbefore the latter entered Paradise.^\nMay 10, 1908.\nI have wanted for some time to tell you of something that will\ninterest you greatl}^, but it is very important that Helen should know\nnothing of it. It concerns her more closelj' than it does you but\nyou will have to wait some time to hear of it. She has got quite\na new type of thing in her writing\u2014-it is she who will lead this\ntime not you\u2014you only fill in her gaps\n^ It is perhaps worth noting that \"Angel \" was one of the cross-correspondences\noccurring in the Piper sittings in England a year before. On April 8, 1907,\nMyersp said that he liad given the word \" Angel \" to Mrs. Verrall. Mrs.\nVerrall's script of April .S, 1907, consisted of a description of angels, and on\nApril 28th she noted that this was probably a preliminary attempt at Dante's\nParadiso. (See Proceedinris, Vol. XXII. pp. 220, 227 and 264.) Nothing of\nall this was normally known to Mrs. Piper at the time of her sittings with\nMr. Dorr.\n\f228 Alice Johnson. [part\nMrs. Verrall told Miss Verrall on June G, 1908, of the\nstatement just quoted that she had \" got quite a new type of\nthing in her writing,\" and Miss Verrall said that the new thing\nshe had got was figures, namely, 3, 8, 7 (see below). It was\nonly after this that Mrs. Verrall showed her her script of\nApril 27.\n(3) Miss Verrall\nThe following are four successive scripts by Miss Verrall,\nall written in London, where she was then living\nApril 29, 1908.\nThe figure 3 that seems wanted.\nMay 4, 1908\n8 eight ....\nA a triangle.\nMmj 11, 1908.\n{(ly A branching tree not a real tree but emblematical.

Here we have\nmany variations on the theme of Seven, ending with \" We are\nseven,\" which had been given by Mrs. Piper on May 8th and\nwas afterwards emphasised by her on May 12 th. This script\nof Miss Verrall's was seen by Mrs. Verrall on June 7th,\nwhen she identified a number of references to Dante in it,\nwhich she and I have since worked out in greater detail.\n(a) \" Jacob's ladder \" is first mentioned by Dante in\nParadiso, Canto xxi. (25-38).^\nI saw rear'd up,\nIn colour like to sun-illumin'd gold,\nA ladder, which my ken pursu'd in vain\nSo lofty was the summit ; down whose steps\nI saw the splendours in such multitude\nDescending, every light in heav'n, methought.\nWas shed thence. As the rooks, at dawn of day,\nBestirring them to dry their feathers chill,\nSome speed their way a-field ; and homeward some,\nReturning, cross their flight ; while some abide,\nAnd wheel around their airy lodge : so seem'd\nThat glitterancp, wafted on alternate wing,\nAs upon certain stair it came, and clash'd\nIts shining.\nAnd again at the end of the same Canto (128-130),\nI at those accents saw the splendours down\nFrom step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,\nEach circuiting, more beautiful.\n^ This and the following passages are quoted from Gary's translation.\n\f230 Alice Johnson. [part\nCompare, with this description, Mrs. Verrall's\nBorne far aloft on oarage of their high wings\nGlorious shining in majestic grace.\nIn the next Canto St. Benedict explains to Dante that this\nis Jacob's Ladder\nOur ladder reaches even to that clime ;\n^\nAnd so, at giddy distance, mocks thy view.\nThither the patriarch Jacob saw it stretch\nIts topmost round ; when it appear'd to him\nWith angels laden.\n(Canto XXTi. 68-72.)\nIt is to be noted that this ladder is seen in the Seventh\nHeaven, of which it is the main feature.\n(b) \" A spinning top many colours but as it spins they are\nblended into one.\"\nMrs. Verrall points out that this seems to be the \" wheel\nmentioned in Parcidiso x. 140 (\"Thus saw I move the glorious\nwheel\") and further described in xii. 1-16:\nSoon as its final woid the blessed flame -\nHad rais'd for utterance, straight the holy mill^\nBegan to wheel ; nor yet had once revolv'd\nOr ere another, circling, compass'd it,\nMotion to motion, song to song, conjoining ;\nSong, that as much our muses doth excel,\nOur Syrens with their tuneful pipes, as ray\nOf primal splendour doth its faint reflex.\nAs when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth.\nTwo arches parallel, and trick'd alike,\nSpan the thin cloud, the outer taking birth\nFrom that within (in manner of that voice ^\nWhom love did melt away, as sun the mist,)\nAnd they who gaze, presageful call to mind\nThe compact, made with Noah, of the world\nNo more to be o'erflow'd ;\n^The highest sphere, or Empyrean.\n-Thomas Aquinas. ^The circle of spirits.\n\u2022The nymph Echo.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 231\nThese revolving circles are referred to again in Paradiso\nXXVIII. Here there is a central point of transcendent brilliancy\nwith concentric circles round it\nAnd over this [the sixth circle], a seventh, following, reach'd\nCircumference so ample, that its bow\nAVithin the span of Juno's messenger\nHad scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev'uth\nEnsued yet other two.\nCanto XXVIII. 27-31.\nNote in both these passages the association of the Wheel\nwith Juno's messenger (Iris, the Eainbow), and that the\nrainbow is specifically referred to later in the same script\nof Miss Verrall's. Note also the special association in the\nsecond passage of the Seventh circle with the Eainbow. Mrs.\nVerrall points out to me that Dante's conception is based on\nPlato's Myth of Er in the BepuUic, Book x. where the\nsouls about to be re-incarnated see \" a rainbow-coloured light,\nstraight like a pillar, extended from on high throughout the\nHeaven and the Earth.\" This is the axis of the Cosmos,\npassing at each end into the Spindle of Necessity, which\ncauses all the heavenly revolutions. The axis is surrounded\nby eight concentric revolving cups or rings, on each of which\nis mounted a Siren, \" which goeth round with her circle,\nuttering one note at one pitch ; and the notes of all the\neight together do make one melody.\"\nThis vision illustrates the astronomical theory of Plato's age,\nessentially the same as that of Dante's age, which dominates\nthe whole of the Paradiso} The eight circles or whorls repre-\nsent the seven planets surrounded by the fixed stars. \" The\n.seven planets by their movements were supposed ... to give\nforth sounds corresponding to the notes of the Heptachord. . . .\nLater it was held that the circle of the fixed stars had also\na note of its own, and a '\nharmony ' or '\nmode ' resulted like\nthat of the Octachord.\"' Cf. Mrs. Holland's \" Tlien an octave\nstruck the answer\" below, p. 241.\n^See the discussion of tlie Myth of Er in J. A. Stewart's The Myths of Plato,\npp. 139-169.\n^ Bepiiblic of Plato, edited by J. Adam, Vol. II. p. 452; note on Pep.\n167 B.\n\f232 Alice Johnson. [part\n(c) \" A leaf that hangs down.\" Mrs. Verrall tells me that\nthere is a flower called \" Jacob's ladder \" described in Bentham's\nBritish Flora, p. 304, a book very familiar to Miss Verrall.\nIn the illustration of this, a long pinnate leaf is drawn as\nbent over at the top and the number of leaflets shown hang-\ning down is seven, as in Miss Verrall's script. Her description,\nhowever, does not seem to apply to this plant (Polnnonium\ncaernhuim), and at the time she and her mother were inclined\nto think the Jessamine was meant. This has normally seven\nleaflets in each group, though occasionally the end one is sub-\ndivided. In any case, the primary intention of the script was\nprobably to give another example of Seven.\n(d) \" A branching tree not a real tree but emblematical \" is\nthe beginning of a topic, which is interrupted in the script\nby the mention of Jacob's Ladder, etc., and resumed at the\nwords :\n\u2014\" The seven-branched candlestick ; it is an image\u2014the\nseven churches; but these not churches, seven candles united in one\nlight and seven colours in the rainbow too. Many mystic sevens.\"\nThere seems here first a reference to the Mosaic seven-\nbranched candlestick (see Exodus xxv. 31-40), leading on to the\nseven golden candlesticks of St. John's vision :\n\" The seven\ncandlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches\n{Bcvelation I. 20). ISut, says the script, the candles really meant\nare not those that symbolise the seven churches, but certain\ncandles that are associated with the seven colours of the rainbow,^\nwhich is not the case with either of the Biblical seven candle-\nsticks.

Vol. XXII. p. 248).\nMrs. Verrall on April 28th, 1907, had interpreted two\nscripts of her own, April 3rd and 6th, 1907, as referring to\nthe Furgatorio and Paradiso (op. cit. p. 264).\nMrs. Holland, in her script of April 8th, 1907, had mentioned\nthe Paradiso, and Martha and Mary and Leah and Eachel {op.\ncit. p. 265).\nOn April 29th, 1907, Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage spoke\nof the \" Inferno . . . Dante's Inferno . . . There's no Inferno\nhere,\" after the sitter (Mrs. Verrall), had mentioned Dante to\nher during the sitting {op. cit. pp. 162-5 and 279).

Miss Verrall had never read any Dante,\neither in Italian or English, and did not look up the references\nor make any further investigation. Mrs. Verrall, on the other\nhand, during the first week in May was reading the Purgatorio\nin connection with Mr. Piddington's paper, and had finished it\non May 8th, the day when the first item of this cross-\ncorrespondence of Sevens came out in Mrs. Piper's trance, and\nwhen she herself wrote the script quoted above.\nIt may therefore be supposed that her preoccupation with\nthe Purgatorio had some telepathic influence in causing Miss\nVerrall (who was living in London at the time and did not\nknow that her mother had been reading Dante) to refer to it\nin her script three days later. But whereas the references\ndealt with by Mr. Piddington (and therefore probably most in\nMrs. Verrall's mind) were to the 27th and 28th Cantos,\nDante's vision of the Procession, to which Miss Verrall's script\nalludes, is in the 29 th Canto.\nNone of the other automatists concerned in this cross-\ncorrespondence knew that allusions to Dante had occurred in\nany of the scripts, except that Mrs. Holland knew that the\nParadiso had been mentioned in her own script of April 8,\n1907, though she was not aware that Martha and Mary and\nLeah and Eachel in that script were derivable from Dante.\n(4) 3\u00a3rs.

Mrs. Verrall also ascertained that she had\nnot read more of Dante than a few cantos of the Inferno.\nOn more explicit enquiries being made later, Mrs. Frith wrote\n(March 10th, 1909): \"I know a few scraps of Italian, but\nbeyond two or three well-known quotations from Dante, I\nhave never read a word of him in either En\"lish or the\noriginal, often as I have meant to do so.\"\nThis script of Mrs. Frith's, though written on June 11th\n1908, was not seen by Mrs. Verrall until July 18th.

Holland.\nThe script about to be quoted was the only one produced\nby Mrs. Holland between the dates March 10th and November\n25th, 1908. It was written while she was at sea, on her\nway from India to England. In her letter to me enclosing\nthe script was also enclosed the following account of a dream,\nnoted by her at the time. I may mention that she very\nrarely tells me anything about her dreams, so that the fact\nof her relating it shows that it made an unusually strong\nimpression on her.\nJuly 15th, 1908.\nLast night I dreamt that I was in a large bare room\u2014rather like\na studio. . . .\nSome one showed me an old note book\u2014or diary\u2014in which was\nwritten in a small neat hand :\n\"Since in 1872 a dear friend chose as a sign by which\nto communicate with me the figure 6, I, in my turn,\nwill try, in the time to come, to send the figure 6,\u2014\nsimply the sign of 6.\"\nI'or comments on this dream, see below, p. 245.

The\nreason why I took \" the two new comers \" to be Mrs. Frith\nand Mrs. Home was because I had lately heard from Mrs.\nVerrall that she had got some interesting writing from Mrs.\nFrith (she did not tell me what) and I had myself lately\nreceived from Colonel Taylor a report of Mrs. Home's trance\nutterances in which I had found some apparently veridical\nmatter. It will be seen that six out of these seven auto-\nmatists are concerned in this cross-correspondence, Mrs. Forbes\nalone makiuo no contribution to it.\nThe statement that there sliould be seven in accord may be\ncompared with Mrs. Piper's remark \" We were seven in the\ndistance as a matter of fact,\" see above, p. 224.\nI also felt sure at the time that \"Green beyond belief\" and\n\" the Green Eay \" had some special meaning, partly because of\nthe repetition of the word \" Green \" and also because in both\nphrases the writing was rather larger and more widely spaced\nthan in the rest of the script. I thought therefore that some\ncross-correspondence was being attempted, and hoped to discover\nit later.\nOn hearing from Mrs. Verrall on November 18th, 1908,\nthat she had found a connection between the scripts of Mrs.\nPiper, Miss Verrall and Mrs. Frith, in regard to Sevens and\nto various mystic sevens mentioned in the Purgatorio, Canto\nXXIX., I looked up the last Cantos of the Purgatorio to\nsee if they contained any marked reference to Green, and found\nwhat I took to be such in Canto xxxi. Dante is drawn over\nthe river of Lethe by Matilda and presented to four of the\nnymphs who surround the Car.\nAnd then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,\nWhere, turned toward us, Beatrice stood.\n\" Spare not thy vision.

The Ottimo Commento\nremarks :\n\" Dante very happily introduces this precious stone,\nconsidering its properties. . . . The emerald is the prince of\nall green stones ; no gem nor herb has greater greenness ; it\nreflects an image like a mirror. . .\n.\" Cf. Mrs. Holland's\n\" Green beyond belief\u2014the Green Eay.\"\nThroughout the whole poem, as well as in the Convito,\nthere are of course constant references to the eyes and the\nsmile of Beatrice (\" It is by the eyes and smile of Beatrice\nsays A. J. Butler in a note on this passage, \" that Dante is\ncarried forward and instructed in Paradise.\") But this phrase\nabout the emeralds is, I think, the one touch of personal\ndescription of her in all Dante's works.\nThe highly mystical passage in which it occurs is full of\nthe idea of shining : her beaming eyes {occhi rilucenti), and\nthe mystic \" twyfold being \" (the type of Christ\u2014the combination\nof the divine and human natures) who shines {raggiava\u2014a word\nwhich has the same root as rag) reflected in her eyes, as the\nsun is reflected in a mirror.\nFor Mrs. Holland's knowledge, \" which it would be more\ndescriptive to call ignorance,\" of Dante, see Mr. Piddington's\npaper above, p. 23-4.\n'\nDisser : \"Fa che le vi.ste non rispariiii,\nposto t' avem dinanzi agli smeraldi,\noikV Amor gia ti trasse le sue armi.\"\nMille disiri piii che fiainma caldi\nstrinsermi gli occhi agli occhi rilucenti,\nche pur sopra il grifone stavan saldi.\nCome in lo specchio il sol, non altrimenti\nla doppia fiera dentro vi raggiava,\nor con uni, or con altri regginienti.\n(Lines 115-12.3.)\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 241\nI had an interview with Mrs. Holland on November 24th,\n1908, and asked her if she attached any meaning to \"Green\nbeyond belief\" and \"the Green Eay.\" The only suggestion\nshe could make was that the Green Eay might refer to what\nis said to be sometimes seen in sunsets at sea. Just as the\nsun is sinking below the horizon, a vivid green ray may\nappear for a moment. She had heard of this, but had never\nseen it herself.^\nI then told . her very briefly of the cross-correspondence\nunder consideration, mentioning my interpretation of the seven\nautomati.sts referred to in her script, and saying that Mrs.\nPiper, Miss Verrall and \" the two new comers \" were involved\nin it, that it included allusions to the Procession of the Car\nin the Purgatorio, and that I interpreted her \" Green Eay \"\nto refer to the eyes of Beatrice.\nMrs. Holland was much interested in this case, and what I\nthen told her undoubtedly influenced the next piece of script\nshe produced (on November 25th), of which I will now quote\nonly the opening sentence :\n\"Then an octave struck the answer.'^\nShe recognised this as a quotation from P)rowning's \" A\nToccata of Galuppi,\" but neither she nor I saw any point in it.\nThe quotation was repeated, with an additional underlining,\nin her script of January 20th, 1909, which opened thus:\nResolute persistence\n\"Then an orMre struck the answer.\"\nI think this is intended as a sort of finishing touch to the\ncross-correspondence. An octave contains, of course, seven\nnotes, one of which is repeated, with a new and completing\nelement, as the eightli. The phrase has a certain interest as\nbeing possibly a reference to the harmony of the celestial spheres\nreferred to above, p. 231.\n(6) Mrs. Home.\nMrs. R.

To whom shall we send 1)\nSouls that labour for your earthly wisdom\nSend no names.\n(MissH. May we say the message is from a teacher?)\n.No. . . . Several wait to hear.

Shall I send this to Miss Johnson, or to Mrs.\nVerrall ?)\nMiss Johnson likes it better ;\nyou can help better through\nher.\n'\nAccordingly, Colonel Taylor sent a copy of his record to\nme three days later. At the time of this sitting, neither he\nnor Mrs. Home knew anything whatever of any of the un-\npublished scripts of the other automatists, except that there\nhad been a slight coincidence between an earlier trance-\nutterance of Mrs. Home's and one of Mrs. Verrall's scripts.\nI think the phrases :\n\" Send the burden of my words to\nothers,\" and \" Several wait to hear,\" clearly indicate that a\ncross-correspondence is intended, and the subject of this can\nbe no other than the opening words, \" Seven times seven and\nseventy-seven.\" Besides the reiteration of the number Seven,\nthere is here a possible reference to Dante's vision of the\nProcession of the Car, for this procession consists of seven\nsevens ;\nnamely, the 7 golden candlesticks, the 24 Elders and\n4 Beasts, the 7 nymphs and the 7 sacred writers. It may\nalso be held to refer to the fact that seven persons are con-\ncerned in the cross-correspondence, each of them giving the\nnumber seven.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Scri'pt. 243\nAs with some of the other factors in this cross-correspond-\nence, the phrase itself is probably of Biblical origin, being, I\ntake it, a mis-recollection of St. Matthew, xviii. 21, 22.\n(\" How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive\nhim ? till seven times ? Jesus said unto him, I say not unto\nthee, Until seven times, but. Until seventy times seven.\")\n(7) Mr. Piddington's \" Posthumous Letter.\"\nIt was not until November 18th, 1908, that I heard from\nMrs. Verrall that she had found a cross-correspondence of\nSevens, with various Dante allusions, in the scripts of Mrs.\nPiper, Miss Verrall and Mrs. Frith. I then concluded that\nthe Sevens in Mrs. Holland's and Mrs. Home's scripts quoted\nabove belonged to the same cross-correspondence, and I told Mr.\nPiddington briefly of this on November 19th. On November\n27th he questioned me further about it; we went thoroughly\nover all the scripts or copies of scripts in my possession, and\nI told him all the details of the case, in so far as they were\nknown to me at the time. He then told me that the subject\nof a \"posthumous letter\" which he had written in July, 1904,\nand had himself sealed and given into my charge as Secretary,\nwas variations on the theme of Seven.\nAfterwards he explained to me that the reason why he\nhad not told me this when I first mentioned the cross-corre-\nspondence was that he thought it an important matter, and\ntherefore did not wish to act in a hurry about it ; he was not\nsure whether the coincidence with the subject of his letter\nwas accidental or not ; and if he concluded on further con-\nsideration that it was not accidental, he was not sure whether\nto tell me about it, or to say nothing, on the chance of fresh\ndevelopments occurring in the scripts. Before coming to see\nme the second time he had made up his mind that if, on going\nfully into the matter of the scripts, he concluded that the\nconnection between them and his letter was not accidental, he\nwould then tell me about the latter.\nHe had written it in my room at the S.P.R. offices on\nJuly 13th, 1904; I was present at the time, but no one\nelse, and he of course took precautions to prevent my acci-\ndentally seeing what he was writing. He then sealed it up\n\f244 Alice Johnson. [part\nhimself and gave it into my charge and I put it away in a\ncertain locked drawer in the office with other letters of the\nsame kind, where it had been kept ever since. There seems\ntherefore no possibility that any one but Mr. Piddington\ncould have known anything of its contents. We now\n(November 27th, 1908) examined it carefully to see that the\nseals were intact and opened it together.^ The letter is as\nfollows\n20 Hanover Square,\nLondon, W., Uth Jul\/\/, 1904.\nIf I ever am a spirit, and if I can communicate, I shall endeavour\nto remember to transmit in some form or other the number\nSEVEN.\nAs it seems to me not improbable that it may be difficult to\ntransmit an exact word or idea, it may be that, unable to transmit\nthe simple word seven in writing or as a written number, 7, I\nshould try to communicate such things as :\n\" The seven lamps of\narchitecture,\" \"The seven sleepers of Ephesus,\" \"unto seventy times\nseven,\" \" We are seven,\" and so forth.\nThe reason why I select the word seven is because seven has\nbeen a kind of tic with me ever since my early boyhood. I would\nwalk along the street to a rhythm formed by counting 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6, 7. Though never superstitious, I also have already,\" in a play-\nful kind of way, regarded 7 as a, or my, lucky number. Often,\nplaying golf at Woking, I count the number of carriages on passing\ntrains, and if a train passes composed of 7 cariiages not counting\ntlie engine, I regard it as a lucky omen, and pretend to think\nthat it means that I shall win my match.\nI have purposely cultivated this tic, of which I have never spoken\nto anybody, as I think it likely in the event of survival that the\nmemory of it, having by practice been frequentlj^ revived in my\nlifetime, may survive the shock of death.\nJ. G. Piddington.\nIt will be seen that while the main theme of this letter is the\nsame as one theme of the cross-correspondence, there are certain\ndifferences of detail. Neither \" the seven lamps of architecture\n\"\n'It is to be Tmder.stood that the proofs of this paper have been submitted\nto Mr. Piddington, so tliat all statements relating to him are practically\nfirst-hand.\n-So written in the original. No doubt \"always\" is meant.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 245\nnor \" the seven sleepers of Ephesus \" are to be found in any\nof the scripts. On the other hand, \" seventy times seven \" is\nvery similar to Mrs. Home's \" Seven times seven and seventy-\nseven ;\n\" and \" We are seven \" occurs both in Mrs. Piper's and\nMiss Verrall's scripts. But there is nothing about the seven\nrailway carriages,\u2014which Mr. Piddington regards as the most\ncharacteristic point in his letter,\u2014in any of the scripts,\nwhile the Dante allusions which are conspicuous in three of\nthe scripts (Mrs. Verrall's, Miss Verrall's and Mrs. Frith's)\nand possibly to be found in the three others (Mrs. Piper's,\nMrs. Holland's and Mrs. Home's) are entirely absent from the\nletter. Nevertheless I think the coincidence too marked and\ndetailed to be put down to chance.\nThe probability that it did not occur by chance is considerably\nstrengthened by a comparison with Mrs. Holland's dream of July\n14th-15th, 1908, given above, p. 238, in which a number is\nmentioned as the subject of a posthumous communication. It is\ntrue that the number given in the dream was 6, whereas Mr.\nPiddington's number is 7, but that any number at all should\nbe chosen for such a purpose seems to me a very unlikely\nthing to guess.\nThe coincidence is further strengthened' by the use of the\nuncommon word iic, in the sense of mentcd hcdjit, in Mr.\nPiddington's letter, whereas Mrs. Piper in the waking-stage of\nthe sitting of May 8th, 1908 (see above, p. 223), uses the\nwords Hcdnt and Tick in close connection with \" We are Seven.\"\nI have already explained the immediate origin of these words\nin Mrs. Piper's trance : viz. that \" Habit \" was part of an\nattempt to translate the Latin verses quoted to her by Mr.\nDorr ; while \" Tick \" was suggested by a certain poem of\nLongfellow's, the thought of which seemed to have come\nspontaneously into her mind.

[part\nEarlier Eeferences to the same Topic.\nIn considering this section, it is important for the reader to\nbear in mind the dates at which the references in the scripts\nwere recognised, as well as the dates when they were written.\nI quote them in the latter order.\nIn January, 1910, when Mrs. Verrall was reading the first\nproofs of this paper, it struck her that the date of Mr.\nPiddington's letter (July 13, 1904), was one on which she\nhad produced a scri^^t of some interest,\u2014she could not remember\non what subject. She looked up this script and found that\nit was as follows\nJuly 13, 1904. 11.15 a.m.\n[After some nonsense Latin and Greek words :]\nBut that is not right\u2014it is something contemporary that you\nare to record\u2014note the hour\u2014in London half the message has come.\nI have long told you of the contents of the envelope, Myers'\nsealed envelope left with Lodge [Here follows a statement as to the\ncontents of this envelope, quoted in full in Mrs. Verrall's report on\nher script, Proceedings, Vol. XX. pp. 424-5 ; also a similar statement\nabout a sealed envelope left by Professor Sidgwick. The script\ncontinues :]\nI don't know what you want more\u2014why can't you act on this ?\nYou ask more and more tests and it is hard to see why.\nHelen could probably give the contents of the envelope too if\nyou want confirmation.

Surely\nPiddington will see that this is enough and should be acted upon.\nF. W. H. M.\nThe whole episode of the references in Mrs. Verrall's script\nto Mr. Myers's sealed envelope is given fully in her report\n{o'p. cit. pp. 299-301). Several references to the subject had\noccurred in February and March, 1903, also one in April\nand one in August of the same year. After August 18, 1903,\nthe subject was not mentioned again till it recurred in the\nscript of July 13, 1904, just quoted. When once resumed,\nit was referred to several times again.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Rolland's Scri'pt 247\nMi'S. Verrall naturally saw no other significance in this\nscript beyond its description of the sealed envelope,\u2014with\nwhich her mind had been much occupied,-\u2014and following out\nits instruction, she asked her daughter ^ next day to \" write\ndown a reference,\" without, of course, telling her anything\nabout her own script. On the following day, July 15th, 1904,\nMrs. Verrall being out of the house at the time, Miss Verrall\nwrote automatically as follows r\nMother has made a mistake the letter is in the second drawer\nbut she wiU not find it what she expected\nDriving round the pond\n{In Latin : Doubtless among the dead you will see all the future)\nthat is wrong {In Latin: you will perceive)^\n{In Latin : There will not be among the living any mind but the\nempty storm of it.\nAen VI 383\n1 The whole is lacking)\nIn the Maderana thai an accident\nEnough F. W. H. Myers\nThe first paragraph of Mrs. A^'errall's script applies appropri-\nately to what Mr. Piddington was doing at the time ; her\nscript was produced at 11.15 a.m. and his letter was written\nduring the middle part of the same day,^ the exact hour not\nhaving been recorded. It is significant that the script says\n\" In London half the message has come,\" for Mr. Piddington's\nletter only contains one main topic (Seven) of the cross-corre-\nspondence, the other main topic (Dante) being absent from it.\nBut Mrs. Verrall, as I have said, attached importance only to\nthe statement about the sealed envelope, and ignored the first\n^ \" Helen \" (Miss Verrall) had only been mentioned in the script 15 times\npreviously to this occasion, and was not then in the habit of writing auto-\nmatically, though she had done it a few times, beginning in the spring of\n1903.\n- This script was among those sent at the time, as stated above, p. 202, to\nSir Oliver Lodge, on the chance that it might turn out to be of evidential value.\nScilicet in functis videbis omne f uturum (that is wrong) spectabis.\nNon erit in vivis auimi nisi vana procella Aen VI 383. deficit omne.\nfind from my diary that he was at the S.P.R. rooms during the late\npart of the morning and early part of the afternoon, and he believes that he\nwrote the letter before lunch.\n\f248 \u2022\nAlice Johvson. [part\nparagraph of her script, which is separated by a space from\nthe rest, as if to indicate that it referred to a different subject.\nThe first sentence of Miss Verrall's script reads like a con-\nfused attempt to correct Mrs. Verrall's misapprehension :\n\" Mother\nhas made a mistake ; the letter is in the second drawer, but\nshe will not find it what she expected.\" This may perhaps be\ntaken to refer to Mr. Piddington's letter (which was actually in\nthe top right-hand drawer of a cabinet consisting of two columns\nof drawers with a set of pigeon-holes on the top) ; or it may\nrefer to the fact that Mrs. Verrall's script, as was afterwards\nfound, had not stated correctly the contents of Mr. Myers's\nsealed envelope.\nThe line in the Acneid referred to by Miss Verrall is, trans-\nlated literally,\nGrief from his sad heart ; he is pleased at the land called by his\niiame.i\nThe line is the last of two describing the pleasure of Palinurus\nwhen the Sibyl tells him that a tomb shall be erected to him\nin Italy and that the place shall bear his name for ever. The\nname \" Palinurus \" means \" backward (or, returning) breeze,\"\nand there seems to be some connection between this name\nand the word procella (storm-wind) in the script. The whole\nintention of the Latin phrases seems to be to mark an opposi-\ntion between the potency of the dead and of the living\n\"Among the dead you will see all the future;\" \"There will\nbe no mind (breath) among the living but an empty storm-\nwind.\" This may be compared with Miss Verrall's script of\nAugust 6th, 1907, quoted immediately below: \"Doubtless he\nhimself will seem to have transferred this.\" If \" he himself\nbe interpreted as the living experimenter, Mr. Piddiugton, the\nscript in both cases would seem to claim that the success of\nthe experiment would be due not to his agency, but to the\ninfluence of some other mind planning the whole scheme.\nIn the absence of any context, the exact meaning of the\nphrase \" deficit ovine \" (translated above, \" The whole is lacking \")\nmust be doubtful, but it may perhaps be regarded as equiva-\nlent to Mrs. Verrall's more definite statement, \" In London\nhalf the message has come,\" which I take to refer to the fact\n1 Corde dolor tristi ;\ngaudet cognomine terra.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 249\nthat only half the cross-correspondence was given in Mr.\nPiddington's letter.\nI must repeat that the interpretation of these two scripts\nfrom beginning to end was only made during January, 1910,\nand that none of the persons concerned had before that date\ntaken into consideration anything in the scripts, except the\nobvious reference in Mrs. Verrall's to the sealed envelopes of\nMr. Myers and Professor Sidgwick. In consequence of this\nreference, Mrs. Verrall invited Mr. Piddington to come and see\nher, so that she might consult with him as to the desirability\nof asking Sir Oliver Lodge to open Mr. Myers's envelope, as\nurged by the script. The consultation took place on July 17,\n1904, but the whole of the scripts was probably not shown\nto Mr. Piddington ; he is, at all events, now certain that,\nwhatever he saw, he never associated anything in them with\nhis own letter.\nDuring October, 1909, Mr. Piddington was studying and\nannotating Miss Verrall's earlier scripts and observed a\nreference to the rainbow and the number 7, followed by a\nLatin sentence which clearly indicated that a cross-correspon-\ndence was being attempted. The script is as follows :\n3\u00a3iss VerraWs Script, Aug. 6th, 1907.\nA rainbow in the sky\nfit emblem of our thought\nthe sevenfold radiance from a single light\nmany in one and one in many\n{In Latin : Doubtless he himself will seem to have transferred this\nto his own rule. Wherefore whatever is set forth must be co-\nordinated, lest, being scattered, it should escape notice. What one\nthing, that all people\u2014 So Fortune commands.) ^\nThe rainbow and the sevenfold radiance, etc., may possibly\ninvolve some of the Dante allusions referred to above, and\n1 Scilicet ipse videbitur lioc transtulisse ad saam normam quare coordinandum\nest quodcuiique expoiiatur iie diffusum praetermittatiir\nquod unum illud omnes\nSic Fortuna jubet.\nThe sentence '\"quod unum illud omnes\"' requires a context to complete it.\n\f250 Alice Johnson. [part\nthere are several other phrases in scripts of the same month\nwhich, when all put together, suggest a thread of Dantesque\nallusions runnin\" throu2;h the whole.\nBut I quote this one script because I am inclined to think\nwith Mr. Piddington that the \" ipse \" (himself) who \" will\nseem to have \" effected the cross-correspondence is Mr. Pid-\ndington himself, and that the reference here is to his posthumous\nletter, which was not opened until November, 1908.\nIf this interpretation is correct, further interest attaches to\nthe following script by Mrs. Verrall, though it is important\nto note that daring the earlier part of the same day on\nwhich it was written, Mrs. Verrall had seen all the scripts\nproduced by Miss Verrall in August, 1907 (it being their\ncustom to compare notes of their scripts at stated intervals).\n3frs.

[part\nBearing of the Case on the Theory\nOF Cross-Correspondences.\nI have treated this case at length, because it has, I think,\na very important and instructive bearing on the theory of\ncross-correspondences, since it inchides what I regard as all the\nelements of a typical cross-correspondence.\n(1) It exhibits clearly the part played by the automatists'\nnormal knowledge ; for in many instances we can trace the\nimmediate normal source of the individual utterances\n(a) Mrs. Piper derives \" Habit \" and \" Angel band \" from\nthe Latin verses given her by Mr. Dorr ; and \" We\nare Seven \" and \" Tick, tick, tick !\n\" from two poems\nwhich no doubt were familiar to her.\n(b) Mrs. Verrall writes of the seven hills of Rome on\nthe day before the date of the founding of Rome\nand immediately after reading the last part of the\nPurgatorio produces a poem about the exclusion of\nVirgil from Paradise. Into the third verse of this\npoem is introduced a familiar text from Isaiah.\n(c) Miss Verrall's most important script seems to draw\non the Bible for Jacob's ladder, the seven-branched\ncandlestick and the seven churches ; on Plato for\nthe spinning wheel ; on Bentham's British Flora for\nthe drawing of the seven leaflets, and on Wordsworth's\npoem for \" We are Seven.\"\n(d) Mrs. Frith's script was probably influenced by the\nquestion put to her by Mrs. Verrall, and it introduces\na Biblical reference in \" Pisgah is scaled.\"\n(e) Mrs. Holland's \" Grreen Eay \" is probably due to her\nscript having been written at sea.\n(\/) Mrs. Home uses a variant of the Biblical phrase\n\" Unto seventy times seven.\"\n(2) Though we may account in this way for many of the\nindividual utterances, take^i hy themselves, we still have to\naccount for the coincidences between them ; and the chrono-\nlogical summary suggests that telepathy, especially from Mrs.\nVerrall, must have played a part in this :\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 255\n(\u00ab) Three days after Mrs. Verrall has finished reading\nthe Purgatorio, Miss Verrall's script alludes to one\nof its final cantos.\n(6) The day after Mrs. Verrall has written to Mr.\nPiddington of these Dante allusions in Miss Verrall's\nscript, some of them are repeated in Mrs. Frith's\nscript.\n(c) Within three or four days of Mrs. Verrall's having\nseen Mrs. Frith's script, both Mrs. Holland and\nMrs. Home write about Seven, adding some possible\nDante allusions.\nAnother possible telepathic agent in the case is, of course,\nMr. Piddington. Against the supposition of his agency we\nhave the fact that no time coincidence was involved, except\nin the case of Mrs. Verrall's first script ; for the bulk of the\nscripts were not produced until some years later, and he was\nnot, as far as he is aware, specially thinking of his letter\nat any time during the period covered by them.^ Yet the\ndegree of correspondence between his letter and the scripts is,\nI think, too remarkable and detailed to be put down to chance.\nAccordingly, Mr. Piddington's letter might be held to account\nfor the Sevens in the scripts, while Mrs. Verrall's pre-occupation\nwith Dante, and her own scripts (in whicli the element of\nseven is very inconspicuous) might be held to account for the\nDante allusions.\nAre we to suppose, then, that the unconscious and involun-\ntary telepathic efforts of Mrs. Verrall and of Mr. Piddington,\nacting unconsciously, involuntarily, and telepathically in combina-\ntion with each other, produced the whole cross-correspondence ?\nA careful reader will see that even this hypothesis does\nnot cover the whole ground, for there are details in the other\nscripts not to be found either in Mrs. Verrall's or in Mr.\nPiddington's ;\ne.g. Miss Verrall's \" spinning top,\" Mrs. Frith's\n\"Pisgah,\" and Mrs. Holland's \"Green Pay,\" all of which\ncontribute to the cross-correspondence. There are, indeed, two\nor three items which some of the automatists may be\nsupposed to have borrowed telepathically from one another.\n^He writes to me: \"Few days of my life passed without my thinking of\nthe subject of my 'posthumous letter'; but I certainly was not thinking of it\nmore than usual at this time.\"\n\f256 Alice Johnson. [part\nThus, both Mrs. Piper and Miss Verrall have \" We are Seven,\"\nand Miss Verrall and Mrs. Frith have the phrase \" mystic\nseven.\" But looking at the scripts as a whole, we find an\nextraordinary variety in the methods chosen to aj^proach the\nsame idea.\nWe find, moreover\u2014in Miss Verrall's script especially\u2014an\ninextricable interweaving of the two topics, Seven and Dante ;\nfor all her Dante allusions, if analysed, are found to be con-\nnected, implicitly or explicitly, with Seven. The implicit\nconnections have been pointed out above ; viz. that \" Jacob's\nladder \" is in the Seventh Heaven ; and the \" spinning top,\"\nor wheel, is not only connected with the rainbow (in Plato as\nwell as in Dante), but it is the seventh circle of this wheel\nwhich is specially mentioned by Dante in connection with the\nrainbow.\nCan this interweaving of the topics be put down to the\naction of two separate and independent agents, Mr. Piddington\nand Mrs. Verrall, or must we go further afield and postulate\n(3) Some other intelligence, which, surveying and selecting\nfrom these diverse elements,\u2014namely, the ideas normally\narising in the minds of the automatists and of Mr. Piddington,\nand the play of telepathy between them,\u2014diverted them all\nto its own purposes and so shaped the event ?\nI have pointed out that the automatists drew on a number\nof different sources : on the Tavern Club Latin verses, on a\npoem of Wordsworth's, and on one of Longfellow's, on Dante,\non Plato, on various passages in the Bible. What was it\nthat from each and all of these miscellaneous sources extracted\nthe strands needed for the interweaving of Seven and Dante ?\nThe task would not, of course, be very difficult for any one who\nhad such a plan in mind,\u2014assuming that he was able to\ninfiuence the automatists to carry it out. I maintain only\nthat there is strong evidence of the existence of such a plan,\nand I think it looks like the plan of one mind, and not of\ntwo or more.\nAs to Mr. Piddington's letter, Mrs. Verrall's contemporary\nphrase, \" In London half the message has come,\" can hardly\nbe explained by telepathy from Mr. Piddington, since the\nphrase by no means represents his own conception of his\naction, for he was planning a message which should come in\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 257\na single and complete form after his death. On the other\nhand the phrase fits in exactly with the hypothesis that a\ncross-correspondence combined out of the ideas of Seven and\nr)ante was being planned by another intelligence, which took\nadvantage of Mr. Piddington's interest in the number Seven\nto enlist his telepathic co-operation.\nI am inclined to surmise also that the absence of Mr.\nPiddington's name from Mrs. Verrall's script may have been\ndue to an intentional v^\/ithholding on the part of the hypo-\nthetical intelligence ; for if it had appeared, she would probably\nhave made enquiries which would have led to the premature\ndisclosure of his letter, before the cross-correspondence was\ncomplete.\nIn Mrs. Piper's case, special ingenuity seems to have been\nshown in turning to account the unpromising material of the\nLatin verses, which is used for both the main topics of\nthe cross-correspondence. On May 8 th a translation of the\nverses had been given in writing. At the beginning of the\nwaking-stage of the same sitting a fresh attempt is apparently\nmade to translate them, but of this the only word that\nis audible is \" Habit,\" followed soon after by \" Angel band.\"\nNow it is remarkable that \" habit \" is a mistranslation of the\nword propositum, the proper meaning of which is \" intention,\"\nand that earlier in the sitting the same mistranslation was\naccompanied by another one, mori (to die) being rendered as\n\"according to custom\" (see above, p. 223),\u2014as if the trance-\npersonality were harping on the idea of habit or custom.\nThus out of these irrelevant verses are selected the very\nfragments that correspond (as I have explained) with Mr.\nPiddington's letter and with parts of Mrs. and Miss Verrall's\nscripts, the first fragment being emphasised by the fact of the\nmistranslations, just as we have found in previous cross-\ncorrespondences that misquotations are sometimes especially\nsignificant.\nAgain, note that Mrs. Piper's reference to Longfellow's poem :\n\" I said Clock ! Tick, tick, tick ! stairs,\" follows immediately after\n\" Habit \" (except that \" We are seven \" is interpolated,\u2014as I\nfancy, to clinch the correspondence), whereas \" Habit \" combined\nwith \" Tick \" gives the connection with Mr. Piddington's\nletter, in which the word tic is used in the sense of habit.\nR\n\f258 Alice Johnson. [part\nAnd note further that the insertion in that reference of the\nword \" Tick,\" vjJiich is contained in the ijoevi imj^licitly and\nnot explicitly, is just what is wanted at this point for the\nconnection.\nDiscussion of some Criticisms of the Theory.\nSince the theory of cross-correspondences was first put\nforward in a tentative manner in my first report on Mrs.\nHolland's script, followed by the far more complicated and\nelaborate instances of the same type given in Mr. Piddington's\n\" Series of Concordant Automatisms,\" two important criticisms\nof the theory have appeared,\u2014Professor Pigou's in the Proceedings,\nVol. XXIII. p. 286, and Mr. Podmore's in the Contemporary\nReview of September, 1909. In my original report I pointed\nout that if the plan of cross-correspondences did not originate\nwith some intelligence external to the automatists\u2014and the\nevidence that it did so was, I observed, very far from being\ncomplete\u2014the most probable alternative hypothesis was that\nit originated in and was carried out by Mrs. Verrall's subliminal\nconsciousness. It is, naturally, this alternative hypothesis which\nis maintained by both our critics.\nProfessor Pigou argues that the element of complementari-\nness in a cross-correspondence, which I adduced as evidence\nof the intention of a mind other than those of the auto-\nmatists, may on the other hand be purely accidental and\ntherefore evidence of nothing at all. He instances the case\nwhere Dr. Verrall attempted to transmit a phrase telepathically\nto Mrs. A^errall, whose script reproduced it, but only in a\nfragmentary and incomplete form ; and says that,\u2014since the\nfragmentary character in this case was clearly not intended\nby the agent, but was only the result of the imperfect\nreception of the idea by the percipient,\u2014the mere fact that\ndifferent fragments of the same idea occur in the scripts of\ntwo different automatists cannot be held to indicate any purpose\nin the fragmentariness. If the subliminal self of Mrs. Verrall,\nsay, were trying to impress some idea upon her own script\nand on that of some other automatist, the correspondence\nachieved would often not be exact :\n\" The two scripts would\nindeed be orientated about the same idea ; but they would be\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 259\nvery far from identical. If we compare the word aimed at\nto the bull of a target, it is in a high degree probable that\nattempts to hit the bull would result in shots scattered widely\nround it. In other words, mildly complementary corre-\nspondences are likely to result from attempts at simple\ncorrespondences\" {Proceedings, Vol. XXIIT. p. 295).\nThe simile is, I think, a very apt one ; it is one that I\nhave often thought of applying in psychical research, and I\npropose to analyse it a little further.\nSupposing\u2014-to make the analogy with our cases somewhat\ncloser\u2014we do not see any one shooting at a target, but find\na target marked with a large number of shots, which cluster\nmost thickly in a certain region, we infer that an attempt\nwas being made to hit some point within that region. It\nmatters not whether the attempt was made by one or by\nseveral persons ; in either case the aim or design was one and\nthe same.\nSo, if Mrs. Verrall's subliminal self were aiming at the\nexpression of a single word or simple idea through herself\nand another automatist, a similar effect might be produced, and\nwe should infer what the word or idea was by observing the\napproximations to it, just as we discover what spot on the target\nwas aimed at by observing where the shots cluster.\nNow Dr. Verrall's experiment was a comparatively simple\none, and Mrs. Verrall's script suggests nothing more than a\nseries of straightforward, though somewhat unskilful, aims at\nhis central idea\u2014the bull's-eye of his target.\nThe complex correspondences, however, are by no means\nsuggestive of any such simple design as this.\nThe scripts containing them present the appearance not of\na target with a central bull's-eye, but rather, as Mr. Piddington\nhas remarked, of a mosaic,\u2014broken and fragmentary indeed, but\nshowing unmistakable traces of a pattern, and that pattern\nfilled in by several different hands, whose efforts overlap, but\neach of whom contributes something different from that con-\ntributed by any of the others. Here the pattern must be\nregarded as the work of one designer ; for it can hardly be\nsupposed to result from the accidental concurrence of several\ndesigns.\nI refer especially to such cases as Mr. Piddington's \" Light\n\f260 Alice Johnson. [part\nin West\" (Proceedings, Vol. XXII. pp. 241-280) and the\n\" Sevens and Dante \" case just described.\nCases of the target type, where two or more automatists are\nconcerned, may no doubt be attributed to the design or agency\nof one of the automatists, for there exists ex loypothcsi evidence\nin each script that the word or idea to be expressed is present\nin some part of the writer's consciousness.\nCases of the mosaic type cannot be so easily disposed of\nfor in them we can find evidence of only ijart of the design\nin the mind of any one of the automatists. There is con-\nsequently no evidence\u2014still less is there any proof\u2014that any\none of them designed the whole : so that, if we are right\nin holding, as just stated, that the whole must be the work\nof one designer, there is no evidence\u2014still less is there any\nproof\u2014that that designer is one of the automatists. This\nappears to me the fundamental distinction between the two\ntypes of cross-correspondence.\nBut arguments from analogy may easily be pressed too far,\nand\u2014if the analogy be admitted\u2014the question at once arises\nhow far our actual cases of cross-correspondence conform to\nthese two ideal types.\nAs a matter of fact, we find a number of gradations between\nthem.\nOf the cases quoted in this paper, two, viz. (o) \" yellow,\"\nAug. 6, 1906, p. 207, and (&) \"The Blue Flower,\" Oct. 24,\n1906, p. 215, are of the simple target type.\nTwo others, (\u00ab) \"The Janiculum,\" June 24, 1906, p. 204,\nand (5) \"Savonarola,\" Oct. 8, 1906, p. 211, are of the mosaic\ntype, in that each script contributes something not found in\nany of the others ; but the whole design, especially in the\nsecond case, is so simple that it may be supposed to be con-\ntained as a whole (partly expressed and partly implied) in\none script and transferred thence telepathically to the others.\nNevertheless, it is noteworthy that the interpretation of Miss\nVerrall's script as referring to a scene in Roinola was only\nmade after the independent occurrence in Mrs. Holland's script\ntwo days later and in Mrs. Verrall's script four days later of\npassages which can be interpreted as referring to other parts\nof the same scene. That is, taking any one of the scripts\nalone, we should be uncertain what it referred to, and con-\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 261\nsequently we cannot assert positively that the whole idea was\nin the mind of any one of the automatists ; but taking all\ntogether, the reference is almost certain.\nThere are other cases in which a definite statement in one\nscript points us to the interpretation of a less definite one\noccurring earlier in cmother script, which again suggest that\nthe complete idea was at all events not in the mind of the auto-\nmatist who wrote first. Thus Miss Verrall's mention of \" Jacob's\nLadder\" on May 11th (see above, p. 228), points to the\ninterpretation of part of Mrs. Verrall's poem of May 8th,^\nwhich Mrs. Piper's mention of \" Angel band \" on the same\nday tends, I think, to confirm.\nSo long as any topic, whether expressed in direct terms or\nonly allusively, can be found in a script, it may, I think,\nfairly be argued that it must have been present in some\npart of the consciousness of the automatist, and may have\nbeen transferred thence telepathically to other automatists. But\nif it cannot be found (as, e.g. neither Miss Verrall's \" spinning\ntop \" nor Mrs. Holland's \" Green Eay \" can be found in Mrs.\nVerrall's script) then the same argument cannot be used.\nThe utmost that can then be said is that the topic 7nay\nhave been in the automatist's mind, and if so, may have\nbeen transmitted thence telepathically ; and such a hypothesis\ncannot, I think, be definitely accepted without further con-\nfirmation.\nIt appears to me, in short, that many of the items of this\ncross-correspondence afford strong evidence of the design or\nagency of some intelligence which was cognisant of the %vliole\nscheme, as finally revealed ;\n\u2014I refer especially to the use made\nof the Latin verses in Mrs. Piper's case, and to the veiled\nallusions to Mr. Piddington's letter in the Verrall scripts ;\nand it seems to me difficult to attribute so complete a knowledge\nof it to the subliminal consciousness either of Mrs. Verrall or\nof Mr. Piddington.\nWhat has been said of Professor Pigou's main contention\n1 If the objection be made that my interpretation of Mrs. Verrall's verse as\nreferring to Jacob's ladder is altogether fantastic and unfounded, I will reply\nthat I bring it forward partly in order to make the greatest possible allowance\nfor the theory of telepathy between the living. For the more items of the\ncross-correspondence can be found in Mrs. Verrall's script, the easier is it to\nmaintain that she transferred them telepathically to the others.\n\f262 Alice Johnson. [part\nwill apply also to the similar conclusions put forward by\nMr. Podmore in his able and sympathetic review of the\nevidence derived from the scripts\/ and I will now only deal\nwith one further point.\nMr. Podmore concludes that the Piper-Myers is not identical\nwith the Verrall-Myers. For my own part it never occurred\nto me to suppose that it was. It never occurred to me to\nimagine that in the scripts we could find anything more than\na product of the mental interaction of two personalities,\u2014the\nautomatist and another.\nTo attempt to formulate the meaning of such an interaction\nwould be rash and presumptuous at the present stage. We\nshall only, I think, approach a comprehension of it by studying\nit from a mental standpoint, and our mental operations are\nlimited by the inelastic nature of a language which is based on\nsensory, material and spatial terms. It is hardly possible to dis-\ncuss the subject without the use of material analogies which are\nconstantly liable to be mistaken for real similarities. The best\nmethod perhaps is to vary the analogies as much as possible,\nso as to avoid confining ourselves to fixed grooves of thought.\nIn particular, any analogy referring to a process,\u2014such as the\ncomparison of telepathy to wireless telegraphy,\u2014is to be\ndeprecated, as it inevitably suggests the inference that the\nprocesses referred to are essentially similar. It is better to\nconfine ourselves to analogies which relate simply to the facts\nbefore us and suggest nothing as to the causes that produced\nthem.\nI will then compare the scripts to chemical compounds of\ntwo . or more elements which are found in different proportions\nin the various compounds. Thus, if we call the automatists\nP. and v., and the hypothetical external intelligence X., we\nmay get in the one script such compounds as PX, or PgX,\nor PX,, and in the other VX etc.; or we may get in either\nof them such compounds as PVX, PgVgX etc. We may also\nget such compounds as PV, or PV\u201e ; or we may get the\n^Mr. Podmore's summary of the Latia message inciilent (Proc, Vol. XXII.\npp. 312-416) seems to me, however, incomplete, for he omits to take into\nconsideration the important fact that, though Myersp failed to show any real\ncomprehension in the abstract of the plan of cross-correspondences, he pointed\nout\u2014and maintained his point in the face of every discouragement\u2014that\n\"Browning, Hope, and Star\" was an instance of the kind required.\n\fLX.] Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 263\nelements P and V by themselves. The one element that we\nnever get alone is X.\nIf this be so, the Piper-Myers is not and never could be\nidentical with the Verrall-Myers. The utmost that can happen\nwill be that the same element is found in both scripts. The\nburden of proof must lie with those who maintain that it is\nthere to be found ; but our methods of analysis are not yet\nso far perfected that we can assert positively either its presence\nor its absence.\n\f264 Mrs. A. W. Vevrall. [part\nA NEW GEOUP OF EXPERIMENTERS.\nBy Mrs. A. W. Verrall.\nHistory of the Mac Script.\nOn September 26th, 1908, when I was away from home, T\nreceived a letter from a complete stranger in Scotland, enclosing\na considerable number of specimens of automatic script, obtained\nby the writer of the letter in combination with other members\nof her family. The writer, who is here called Miss Mac, gave\na brief account of the origin and development of the script, and\nexplained that lately the controls had urged that the script\nshould be sent to Mrs. Verrall.\nHer letter, dated September 23rd, 1908, was as follows:\n. . . We are a family of five and are all more or less, as well as\nour parents, able to write to a certain extent with Planchette. . . .\nIt is about nine months ago that I read Myers' Human Personality\nfor the first time. I was greatly interested in it. We had a Planchette\nin the house, but had never succeeded in writing with it when on\none or two occasions we had tried. However I read in the above\nbook that several people tried for a considerable period before getting\nlegible writing, so that I felt encouraged to try again. After about\neight weeks of practice, generally once a day, the huge illegible\nscrawling gradually decreased in size and then changed into hand-\nwriting, words and then sentences. We told the Planchette to stop\nafter every word instead of stringing them together as at first, and\nnow it generally refuses to go on until lifted and replaced after everj^\nword.\nFor three or four months we had only one control, Anne Murry,\npurporting to be a nun who lived in the time of William the\nConqueror and had rather a tragic history. I when from home\nceased writing for three months, and on my return in the middle of\n\fLX.] A Ne%v Group of Experimenters. 265.\nMay I practised with my brother A., with the result that I cannot\nnow write legibly with any other member of the family. ... A.\nwrites more or less with every member . . . but best with me.\nWhen he and I started together the result was several fresh\ncontrols. One, Ellen Bell, seemed to be a perfect lunatic, as indeed\nthe other controls said she was. She was so pertinacious for a while\nthat she used to interrupt and spoil all the other script, apparently\nrefusing to let any one else write. . . . She has her own line of\nriddles, epigrams, Limericks, etc., sometimes very witty, at other times\nutter rubbish . . . She draws clever caricatures of our acquaintances,\nin a few instances not known to the writers, but to some one else\nin the room. . . . She appears to be quite subliminal and varies in\ncharacter with the various writers. . . .\nOther controls called themselves \" Mr. Evans, a \"Welsh parson,\"'\nwho \" seemed anxious to be identified, but we find that the\nchurchyard in Aberystwitli where he was supposed to be buried\ndoes not exist,\" and \" Eosa Baughan,\" a name subsequently\nfound to be that of a \" character delineator \" on the staff of\nThe Lady's Pictorial. This control seems to have produced some-\nevidence of supernormal acquaintance with \" palmistry.\"\nIn June Miss Johnson's report on Mrs. Holland's script\n{Proceedings, Vol. XXI., Pt. LV. pp. 166 ci^ seep) was read by the-\nMac i'amily, and three weeks later, on July 19, 1908, they\ndeveloped a \" Sidgwick \" control. The nature of the phenomena\nobtained was considerably modified, as was to be expected, by\nacquaintance with the type of script described by Miss Johnson.\nThe script of July consisted of more or less disconnected\nsentences, in which, however, was a constant recurrence of\ncertain easily definable topics ; it abounded in literary allusions\nand quotations, and my name occurred more than once. The\nmarked influence of the reading of the Holland script was\nnoted in Miss Mac's letter.\nIn August the script underwent another change, and con-\nsisted mainly of attempts, with the aid of a large number of\ncontrols, to relate a complicated story in Italian verse. This\nlanguage was unknown to Mr. A. Mac, and Miss E. Mac, the\nother automatist, had only a slight knowledge of it. The Italian\nof the script is fiuent, but inaccurate and ungrammatical ; it\ncontains words not to be found in dictionaries, and the ter-\nminations are often undecipherable. The general meaning is,\n\f266 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nhowever, plain enough. But it is difficult to say with certainty\nthat it shows knowledge beyond that possessed by Miss Mac,\nthough it is certainly not the sort of thing that she would or\ncould consciously and deliberately write.\nAbout the middle of September there arose what Miss Mae\ndescribed as \" a regular clamour of entreaty,\" on the part of the\ncontrols, that she should write to Mrs. Verrall. My name had\noccurred in the script of July, and the idea of sending some\nof the \" Sidgwick \" messages to me had arisen, but nothing had\nbeen done, as Miss Mac did not think the messages sufficiently\ndefinite to warrant her in writing to an absolute stranger. \" It\nwas only,\" as she writes, \" planchette's entreaties that have made\nus change our minds.\" At the direction of a \" control,\" calling\nitself \" Eeynold Carson,\" Miss Mac sent to me the whole of the\nSidgwick script and of the Italian attempts, as well as a few\nspecimens of messages from earlier controls. On September 18,\nthis \" control \" had urged the desirability of despatching the\nspecimens to me, so that they might reach me \" by next\nSaturday week,\"\u2014before, that is, Saturday, September 26,\n1908\u2014and this was done. The script was posted from\nScotland on September 24th, reached Cambridge on September\n25th, and was re-directed to me in Hampshire, reaching me\non September 26th.\nMiss Mac wrote that before reading the report on Mrs.\nHolland's script the automatic writers had only read Human\nFersoncdity and Phantasms of the Living, among what she described\nas \" volumes of the Psychical Research Society.\" In reply to\na question, she wrote on September 29th that they had read\nnone of my script except what is contained in Miss Johnson's\nReport (Vol. XXI.), and that they had seen no reviews except\nof that Report.\nFurther enquiries as to the occupations and interests of the\nautomatists and their opportunities of reading the Proceedings\nof the S.P.R., confirm the belief of Miss Mac that none of the\nautomatists were acquainted with my Report on my ov^n script\n(Proceedings, Vol. XX.) published in October, 1906. More-\nover, the very fall notes sent by Miss Mac, at my request, in\nelucidation of her script contained nothing indicating any previous\nacquaintance with two or three points presenting obvious resem-\nblances with the contents of certain scripts mentioned in that\n\fLX.] A Netv Grmip of Experimenters. 267\nEeport, and two supplementary questions, sent with several others\nto Miss Mac in October and purposely framed to elicit latent\nknowledge of these points, failed to do so. It may therefore\nbe taken as certain that no knowledge of Proceedings, Vol. XX.\nwas consciously possessed by the Mac family. At the same\ntime it cannot be proved that at some time the Eeport, or a\nnotice of it, may not have been within reach of one or other\nof the automatists. The point is of importance in connexion\nwith some allusions in the Mac script,^ but does not affect the\nvalue of the greater part of its contents, including the principal\nincident here described.\nAt the time when Miss Mac wrote to me there was absolutely\nno acquaintance between any members of the two families. A\ncousin of Miss Mac's was a college friend of Miss Yerrall's,\nand this served as an introduction for the correspondence that\nbegan with the sending of the script. The principal automatist\nappears to be Mr. A. Mac, and the majority of the messages\nrelating to cross-correspondences were obtained by him in com-\nbination with Miss E. Mac (my correspondent), though occasionally\none or more other member's of the family collaborated with him.\nIn March, 1909, I made the acquaintance of Miss D. Mac,\nthe eldest of the family, whose work had brought her to\nCambridge for a short period. After I had written out the\naccount of this incident and shown it to Miss Mac and her\nfamily, I had some talk on the subject with Miss D. Mac.\nFrom her I learnt in detail more of the instances of telepathy\nbetween various members of the family, to which Miss E.\nMac had referred in her original letter, but nothing that passed\nbetween us has thrown any further light on the incidents\nhere related.\nThis paper deals with the messages claiming to come from\nthe \" Sidgwick control,\" generally referred to henceforth as\nSidgwickji, in accordance with the nomenclature introduced by\nMr. Piddington.\nThe messages were produced between July 19 and July 29,\n1908; the desire that the script should be sent to me was\nexpressed between Sept. 12 and 18, 1908,- it being particularly\nigee below, p. 301.\n-My name did not occur after July 29 till Sept. 1, and then again on\nSept. 12 and onwards till Sept. 18.\n\f268 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nurged that the script should reach me by Saturday,\nSeptember 26.\nThis latter fact at once struck me. My daughter and I\nwere engaged in an experiment necessitating the comparison of\nour scripts at fixed intervals and it had been arranged that the\nnext comparison of scripts should be made on September 27,\nthe reason being that we were to separate on September 28\nfor some weelvs. It was accordingly our intention to compare\nscripts on September 27 and then to leave the subject un-\ndiscussed aud the scripts unexamined till the middle of\nDecember, when we proposed to make the next comparison.\nIf therefore any question were raised by the newly received\nscript which necessitated a reference by me to Miss Verrall's\nscript, September 27 was the last possible day on which that\nreference could be made.^ September 26 therefore seemed\nan appropriate day to be named for the arrival of the new\nscript at my house. No reason can be suggested why this day\nshould have commended itself to the writers of the Mac script,\nand in view of the appropriateness of another date named in\nthe Mac script - this date may perhaps be regarded as not due\nto accident.\nTo return to the contents of the Mac script: On July 19,\n1908, there appeared for the first time, when Miss E. Mac\nand Mr. A. Mac were using Pianchette, a control claiming\nto be Professor Henry Sidgwick. The remarks claimed by\nthis control consisted of sentences more or less fragmentary.\nThe first piece of script, which announced itself at the outset\nas coming from '\nMr. Sidgwick,' was signed with his signature,\nH. S., as well as with the initials F. W. H. M. and the name\nHarry.^ On July 2 0 and 2 1 similar script claiming to come from\n'\nSidgwick ' was obtained, the name '\nMrs. V.' occurring without\ncontext on July 20, and on July 23 similar script contained\nboth the name Sidgwick and the initials F. W. H. M. On\nJuly 24 was written only a single sentence from the Sidgwick\n1 During the periods between comparison of scripts tlie record of each writer's\nproductions is not available to the other.\n- See below, p. 305.\nNo explanation has been found of this name, which occurs nowhere else\nin the Mac script.

News from the Occident. [Drawing of rose.] Roses\ndew-kissed\u2014R. S ^\nSidgwick. Sesame and lilies \u2014lotus the flower of repentance.\nSidgwick. Vanity of vanities all is vanity.

The whole of the \" messages \" claimed by\nSidgwickjf\u2014whose name occurs four times - in the course of\nthe 69 words\u2014were found to be intimately and intelligibly\n^ The .... mark an interruption by a control, \"Bell.\" Four Italian words\nthat follow are part of a lengthy Italian communication from a group of\n-controls of whom H. S. was one, and who occupied the Mac script in August.\n^I had made the above division into four subjects of the topics introduced\nin the script of July 27 some time before I noticed that the name of the\ncontrol, \"Sidgwick,\" was written four times. In view of other instances of\nintelligent direction by the controls, I am disposed to attribute this coincidence\nact to accident but to design.\n\f270 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nconnected with topics that had already been mentioned in\nscripts unpublished and inaccessible to the new automatists.\nOn July 29 another control, \"Evans,\" said that Mr.\nSidgwick was anxious to get a message through the auto-\nmatists to Mrs. Verrall and was trying to do it \" now.\" Here\nended the Sidgwick messages for the time. Although Sidgwickj,\ntook occasional part in the script freely produced by Mr. and\nMiss Mac in August, no further reference to me was made\ntill September 1, when my name emerged in connexion with\nthe cross, heart and anchor which several times in this script\noccur as symbolic of Henry Sidgwick (probably owing to\nrecollections of Proceedings Vol. XXI. p. 229). It was not till\nsome days later, September 13, that the definite suggestion\nwas made that the Sidgwick script should be sent to Mrs.\nVerrall.i\nSesame and Lilies.\nOf the four topics in the script of July 27, 1908, quoted\nabove, I deal first with the second, which is the most\ninteresting. It must be treated at some length, while com-\nparatively brief comment only is required in the other three\ncases.-\nImmediately after the second occurrence of the name\nSidgwick came the words \" Sesame and Lilies.\" This phrase\nis the title of a book by Euskin. Two points arise for con-\nsideration : Does the Mac script contain any further references\nto Euskin's book ?\u2014Is there any point in sending the words\n\" Sesame and Lilies \" as a messaire to me ?\nTo begin with the first question, whether there are allusions\nin the Mae script to Euskin's Sesame and Lilies \u2014Two lectures\nwere delivered by Euskin at Manchester in 1864 and published\nin a single volume under the title of Sesame and Lilies. The\nlectures are called respectively, \" Sesame : of Kings' Treasuries,\"\nand \" Lilies : of Queens' Gardens,\" and to each lecture is\nprefixed a motto in Greek.

(\" As the Lily among thorns, so\nis my love . . .\"). There have been several editions of this\nwork, and between these editions there is a good deal of\nvariation in small points. The first edition and its re-issues\nin brown cloth binding contained, as has been said, the two\nManchester lectures, with the mottoes in Greek from Job and\nCanticles. In 1871 a revised and enlarged edition was pro-\nduced as part of a general issue of Euskin's works. The\nvolumes were bound in blue leather with blind tooling on the\ntwo covers and gold letters on the back. The volume of\nSesame and Lilies in this edition contained a third lecture\ndelivered at Dublin in 1868. The original mottoes to the\ntwo Manchester lectures were altered, and for them were\nsubstituted, in the first case, a motto in English, from\nLucian's Fisherman, \" You shall each have a cake of Sesame\nand ten pound,\" and, in the second, a text in English from\nthe Septuagint version of Isaiah xxxv. 1, \"Be thou glad, oh\nthirsting desert ; let the desert be made cheerful and bloom\nas the lily ; and the barren places of Jordan shall run wild\nwith wood.\" There is no motto to the third lecture. These\nmottoes seem thenceforth to have been used in subsequent\neditions, except in the 1907 edition in Everyman's Library, this\nreturns to the old mottoes, but is not bound in blue leather.\nThere are therefore two forms of Sesame and Lilies, if we\nclassify the types by their mottoes\n(a) The two-lecture form, with mottoes in Greek from Job\nand Canticles\n(6) The three-lecture form, with mottoes to the two Man-\nchester lectures in English from Lucian and Isaiah (Septuagint).\nThere are several forms of Sesame and Lilies, if we classify\nthe types by their binding. Of these the most familiar is the\nset in blue leather with blind tooling and gold lettering. But\nin that binding there is no volume containing the two Man-\nchester lectures with the Greek mottoes, unless some private\nindividual has bound the earlier edition in blue leather like\nthat of the revised edition.\n\f\u2022272 Mrs. A.

Finally, he\nlikens the Wisdom which he is urging his hearers to seek\nto \" a Fourth kind of treasure, which the jewel and gold\ncould not equal, neither should it be valued with pure gold\n\"\n45). This phrase recalls the second half of his introduc-\ntory motto from Job (\" dust of gold \"), and, returning in\nthought to the first half of that motto (\" out of it cometh\nbread \") he concludes by urging the establishment of a Corn\nLaw \" dealing in a better bread ;\n\u2014bread made of that old\nenchanted Arabian grain, the Sesame, which opens doors ;\ndoors not of robbers' but of Kings' Treasuries\" (\u00a7 50).\nIn the second lecture, after describing types of womanhood\nin the great writers\u2014Shakespeare, Dante, Homer, and others\nand commending the education of Wordsworth's Lucy who\n\"grew in sun and shower\" 70), he urges women to leave\ntheir own secluded flower gardens and go forth to make a\ngarden of the world. \" The path of a good woman is indeed\nstrewn with flowers ; but they rise behind her steps, not\nbefore them.

In the\ntifth edition of Sesame and Lilies, published in 1882 with a\nnew preface, Euskin says of the book that, \" if read in con-\nnection with '\nUnto this Last ' it contains the chief truths I\nhave endeavoured through all my past life to display.\"\nOther Eeferekces to the Book in the Mac Script.\nWe are now in a position to consider whether there are\nother references to the book in the Mac script besides the\noccurrence of the unattached phrase \" Sesame and Lilies.\" There\nare, as it seems to me, two groups of unmistakable references\non two preceding days, namely, as follows\nJuly 19, 1908. Where is the little blue vase with the lilies\nthat grow by Sharon's dewy rose (a) . . . Search the scriptures, and\nthe dust shall be converted into fine gold (h).\nJuly 26, 1908. A blue book bound in blue leather with ended\npaper and gold tooling.\nLet us consider the applicability of the above quotation\nfrom the script of July 19, and take first the second clause,\n\" Search the scriptures, and the dust shall be converted into\nfine gold.\"\nIn reply to a request from me to identify all quotations in\nthe script. Miss Mac quoted to illustrate (b) Job xxii. 24, and\nxxviii. 6, for \"dust\" and \"gold\"; and Psalms xix. 10, Prov.\nXXV. 12, Lam. iv. 1, for \"fine gold,\"\nLet us see if we can fix upon one of these five passages\nas more intimately connected than the others with the phrase\nin the script, and therefore more likely to be its source. What\nis wanted is a passage contrasting \" dust \" and \" fine gold.\"\n\" Dust \" does not occur in the passages from Psalms, Proverbs,\nand Lamentations, all of which have \" fine gold.\" \" Dust \" is\ncontrasted with \" gold \" in both the passages from Job, but in\nthe actual verses referred to in Miss Mac's notes the \" gold\n\"\nis not \" fine.\" Closer examination of the context of Job xxii.\ngives no further clue, but if we look at the beginning of\nJob xxviii. we find that the verb \" fine,\" though not the\nadjective, is used in close conjunction with \" gold.\" \" Surely\ns\n\f274 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nthere is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where\nthey fine it. Iron is taken out of the earth ... as for the\nearth, out of it cometh bread . . . and it hath dust of gold\n(Job xxviii. 1-6).\nThis therefore is the passage which we are led on internal\nevidence to regard as the source of the phrase in the script,\nand the latter half of this passage is the motto set by Euskin,\nin its Greek form, at the head of his essay on Sesame ; or\nKings' Treasuries.\nMoreover, \" Search the scriptures \" is appropriate. For, as\nhas been said, Euskin insists on accurate examination of the\nwritten word,\u2014\" Search the scriptures\n\"\n\u2014and illustrates his\nmeaning by quotations from the Scriptures ;\nonly so can\nreading be of value, only so can \" one grain of the metal \" be\ngathered. In fact, Euskin's first lecture might be summarised\nin the words, \" Search the scriptures and the dust shall be\nconverted into fine gold.\"\nLet us turn to the other extract from the script of\nJuly 19; {a) \" Where is the little blue vase with the lilies\nthat grow by Sharon's dewy rose.\"\nTo illustrate this. Miss Mac quoted the hymn\n\" By cool Siloam's shady rill,\nHow sweet the lily grows,\nHow sweet the scent beneath the hill,\nOf Sharon's dewy rose.\"\nThe hymn is of course based on the famous words of\nCanticles ii. 1,\n\" I am the Eose of Sharon and the Lily of the valleys \",\nthe second verse of which chapter forms Euskin's motto to the\nsecond lecture. Lilies ;\n\" As the Lily among thorns, so is my\nlove.\"\nThus the two extracts from the Mac script of July 19\nboth correspond, one completely and the other partially, with\nthe mottoes prefixed to the two lectures in Euskin's book\u2014with\nthe two mottoes, that is, prefixed in their Greek form to the\noriginal edition of Euskin's Sesame and Lilies}\n^ In the script the plural \"lilies\" occurs\u2014a modification of the singular\n\"lily\" of the hymn quoted by Miss Mac, and of Canticles ii. 1, perhaps due\nto the plural \"lilies\" of the title of the book.\n\fLX.] A New Group of Experimenters. 275\nThe words \" Where is the blue vase \" are so far unexplained,\nand are best considered in conjunction with the second extract\nquoted above from the Mac script, that namely of July 26.\nThis runs as follows :\n\" A blue book bound in blue leather\nwith ended paper and gold tooling.\" \" Ended \" paper, though\nintelligible, is not the technical term for what is apparently\nmeant. \" End papers \" are the blank leaves added at each\nend of the book by the binder. The description is not very\ndefinite, but the implication plainly is of a book carefully\nbound, not merely put into a cover like the ordinary book\nof commerce. The script does not say on what part of the\ncover the \" gold tooling \" is. The description, however, quite\nfairly fits the familiar binding of Euskin's works. These books\nare blue, bound in blue leather with end papers and gold\nletters on the back. There is tooling on the covers of the book,\nbut blind ^ tooling.\nSo far then it appears that the references on July 19 and\non July 26 in the Mac script are appropriate enough to the\ninside and the outside of Euskin's Sesame and Lilies, though\nit is to be noted, as above stated, that no volume has been\ndiscovered which combines the blue binding with the Greek\nmottoes. It would be fanciful to press a meaning from the\ninterrogative form of the sentence, but it is permissible to see\nin the \" blue vase \" which holds \" the lilies \" an allusion to the\nblue binding of Euskin's book.\nNeither blue binding nor Greek mottoes, however, were\nassociated in the minds of any of the automatists themselves\nwith Euskin's book. Their copy of Sesame and Lilies was\nGeorge Allen's green cloth-covered '\nEleventh complete edition,'\nand this volume contains not the Greek mottoes referred to\nin the script, but the English mottoes from Lucian and Isaiah,\nThe automatists had recognised that the phrase on July 27,.\nSesame and Lilies, was a reproduction of the title of a book\n^ In this connexion it may be worth noting that immediately after the\ndescription of the book, when the automatists asked, \"What book is that?\",\nthe script went on \" Blind, blind, blind, wherefore are your eyes bound witli\nclay \u2014every man has his . . .\n''\n[sic). Possibly here the \"blind\" and \"bound\"\nmay have some reference to the Mind tooling on tlie blue hound Ruskin.\nAnd in '^\nEveryman's Library\" there has been a recent issue of Sesame and\nLilies, with a preface by Sir Oliver Lodge, an edition however not known to\nany of the automatists.\n\f276 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nby Ruskiii, and in their annotations had described the book\nas \" known, though not lately read.\"^ But they did not recognise\nthe previous allusions of July 19 and 26, and had no idea\nthat any other mottoes had ever been used by the author\nthan those which they found in their own copy, when, at my\nrequest, they looked out the mottoes prefixed to the lectures.\nThe allusions then in the Mac script to Ruskin's Sesame and\nLilies do not appear explicable as instances of revived memory.\nNor can we ascribe to accident the sequence of (1) the\nallusions to both original mottoes of the Manchester lectures,\n(2) the description of a blue bound book, and (3) the final\nwords \" Sesame and Lilies.\"\nCan any explanation be found in the instructions to convey\ntlie words to me ? Here I come to my second question, and\nto answer this an account must be given of the contribution\nmade to the subject by my own and my daughter's scripts.\nReferences in the Vekhall Scripts.\nBetween October, 1907, and June, 1908, as has been said,\nwe had tried experiments for obtaining cross-correspondences\nbetween our scripts. Miss Verrall was mainly in London during\nthis year. At three pre-arranged dates scripts had been com-\npared, no communication of the contents being made in the\nintervals, and some correspondence was observed between them.\nEarly in June we went abroad and automatic writing was dis-\ncontinued. On our return experiments were again begun, and\nthe first date for comparison of scripts was arranged for\nSeptember 1, 1908.\nThe circumstances were no longer so favourable for experi-\nmentation. During the months of July and August we were\nin the same house, and though we were careful not to speak\nto one another of the contents of our scripts, there was an\nincreased chance of similar associations being aroused by\nincidents common to both.\n1 Of the four automatists concerned, one had not read Sesame and Lilies at\nall, and another, Mr. A. Mac, writes that he had not read it all or recently,\nand had no recollection whatever of it except of an extract from it in an old\nreading book.\n\ft\nLX.] A New Group of Experimenters. 277\nOn September 1, 1908, Miss Verrall's scripts^ were com-\nmunicated to rae and some of mine were shown to her.\nEach writer had produced thirteen scripts. The comparison\nof scripts showed two ^ instances of attempts at intercon-\nnexion, of which one was as follows. Comparison of M. V.\nscript of August 19 on the one hand with H. V. script of\nAugust 19 and two other H. V. scripts, of August 12 and\nAugust 22, closely connected with it by internal evidence,\nled us to the conclusion that an unsuccessful attempt had been\nmade to produce \" Sesame and Lilies,\" the title of Euskin's\nbook, as the subject of a cross- correspondence between our\nscripts. It is to be remembered that when this conclusion was\nreached we knew nothing of the Mac script.\nThe scripts that refer to Sesame and Lilies are as follows\nI begin with my own script\n{August 19, 1908.

W. Verrall. [part\nThis script, purporting by the form of its signature^ to come\nfrom Myersy, in its first half emphasises the word \" Lilies \"\nParacusia Liliastriom is the botanical name of a wild Lily of\nthe Alps, and Liliayo is the name of another species. Paradise,\nthe garden, leads naturally to Eden, and the Lilies of Eden\nsuggest Lilith, but the scribe returns to Eve's Lilies in a\ngarden fair. The Lilies and the garden are again conspicuous\nin the four lines of verse. In the second half the script\nplainly indicates that a cross-correspondence is being attempted.\nThis cross-correspondence is apparently to consist of Lilies and\nsomething else. Lilies being the clue indicating what scripts\nare to be combined. The wording is obscure, but what is unmis-\ntakable is that in each of two scripts \" Lilies \" is to occur\nin combination with a different word. The second word in\nM.

This of course was unsatisfactory ; the catch-\nword \" Lilies \" was absent in the H. V. script, and its absence\nwas emphasized by the substitution of \" stars \" for \" lilies \" in\nthe phrase which appeared to re-echo the allusion to gold\nand the French arms in M. V. script.

The connexion between this\nscript of August 22 and the M. V. script of August 19 seemed\nfurther indicated by a similarity of phrase :\n\" Let the words\ncome\" (M. V.) \"let it come of itself\" (H. V.); and the\nidentity of control,\u2014\" Yours \" (M. V.) and \" F. W. H. M.\"\n(H.

A remem-\nbrance of that fact joined to the statements that (1) what\nwas wanted was \" Lilies and \" something, and (2) that it was\n\" a literary allusion that should come to-day \" suggested to me\nthat the intended subject for the cross-correspondence was\nSesame and Lilies, the title of another of Euskin's books. This\n1 Cf. Keats, Ode to a Nirjhtiwjale, \"Half in love with easeful death\"; and\nShelley, in the Preface to Adonais, writing of the Protestant cemetery at\nRome, where Keats is buried, \"in love with death.\"\nOnly two scripts within the period under consideration were signed by\nMyersHv\u2014this script of Aug. 22, and another, on July 27, in which appeared\nthe other cross-correspondence between the M. V. and H. V. scripts of July\nand August, 1908. (See above, p. 277.)\n\f280 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nview was confirmed on further investigation. The H. V. script\nof August 12, which by internal evidence seems closely con-\nnected with the scripts of August 19 and 22,^ begins with the\nwords \" Praeterita rediviva.\" Praeterita is the name of another\nof Euskin's works. There is a certain appropriateness in the\nframing in, so to speak, of the Sesame and Lilies episode in\nthe H. V. script; the first allusion, on August 12, opens with\nthe words \" praeterita rediviva \" (the past revived), and the\nlast allusion, on August 22, opens with the words \"Unto this\nlast\u2014that was the messaoe to be given.\" In both cases there\nis a certain play upon the meaning of the title :\n\" things\npast-by \" live again ;\n\" unto this last \" concludes the episode.\nThis was recognised at the time, but the singular aptness\nof choosing those two titles in particular was not realised till\nmy researches into editions of Sesame and Lilies led me to\nmake acquaintance for the first time with the preface to the\nedition of 1882, already quoted (p. 273). There Euskin says\nof Sesame and Lilies that \" if read in connection with Unto\nthis Last, it contains the chief truths I have endeavoured\nthrough all my imst life to display.\"\nIn this sentence, then, Euskin combines with \" Sesame and\nLilies \" both \" Unto this Last \" and \" All my past life,\" the\npast life which elsewhere he describes as \" Praeterita.\" It is\nimpossible to attribute to accident the selection among Euskin's\nmany works of the two titles which are so especially associated\nwith Sesame and Lilies in the mind of Euskin, and of readers\nof his 1882 preface, and it is as certain as anything can be\nthat neither I nor my daughter - knew any reason why those\ntitles should be so associated.\nThat the intention of tlie suggested cross-correspondence\nbetween us was aimed, not at the mere phrase, but at\nEuskin's title, is confirmed by the emphasis given to the\nword \" Garden \" in connexion with \" Lilies \" in M. V. script of\nAugust 19. The alternative title of Euskin's second lecture,\n1 See Appendix for complete copies of these scripts. Prominent in all three is\nthe idea of Death ; neither the topic nor the word death occurs in any other\nH. V. script of the period ;\ntwo, those of August P2 and August 22, have\n(a) drawings of a lyre and (b) allusions to the \"light of the western sky.\"\n-For a statement of the knowledge of Ruskin's book consciously possessed\nby my daughter and myself, see below, p. 284.\n\fLX.] A New Group of Experimenters. 281\nLilies, is Queens' Gardens and the garden is the central idea\niu the concluding paragraphs of his lecture.\nIt is therefore not surprising that a comparison of scripts\nled us to the conclusion that there had been an attempt and\na failure to work off a cress-correspondence on the words\nSesame and Lilies. We spent some time investigating both\nscripts in the hopes of detecting a reference to Sesame, but\ncould find none.\nThis conclusion was not recorded at the time, but was\nvividly present in our minds, and recorded on September 26,^\nafter reading the Mac script. But though there is no record\nof our recognition of the failure of this cross-correspondence\nin our scripts, evidence that we had discussed the question\nof Sesame and Lilies may be obtained from an H. V. script of\nSeptember 23rd.'^ This script, written three weeks after the\ncomparison of scripts on September 1, and before anything\nfurther had occurred to draw attention to the subject, con-\ncludes as follows\nNote the literary allusions something should be made of them\nputting one with another the clue is there but several things have\nbeen missed but try again.\nAn implement of peace the fork of the husbandman\u2014the sowing\nof the grain \u2014a star flower something like a daisy what does that\nmean the message was confused the star flower and the lilies too\nlook back\u2014the open door.\nThe allusions in this script to the above described episode\nare unmistakable ;\n\" liter'ary allusions \" (see M. V. script of\nAugust 19) are to be noted and put together, the literary\nallusions being, as we had observed, Praeterita, and Unto this\nLast ; the \" star flower something like a daisy,\" and again\n\" star flower and the lilies too \" recall the \" Liliastrum \" and\n\" Liliago \" of M. V. script. Clearly the \" sowing of the grain\n\"\nand \"the open door\" allude to Sesame, as a grain, and as\na magic word.\nTo sum up then : between August 1 2 and August 2 2 the\nV. and H. V. scripts seem to have attempted to work\n^ See below.

[PAllT\noff a cross-correspondence on the title of Euskin's Sesame and\nLilies, introducing by the way into Miss Verrall's script\nappropriate allusions to two other books of Euskin's specially\nassociated by the author with Sesame and Lilies, but not so\nassociated by either automatist. This attempt was recognised\nby us on September 1, though not recorded. Miss Verrall's\nscript, however, repaired that omission on September 23.\nConnexion between the Mac and Verrall Scripts.\nSo far, then, it is clear that references to Euskin's Sesame\nand Lilies were made in the Mac script between July 19\nand 27, and in the M. V. and H. V. script between August 12\nand 22. The question arises whether anything in the method\nof presentation, as distinguished from coincidence of subject,\nin the two sets of scripts suggests inter-connexion between\nthem or derivation from a common source.\nThe allusions in the Mac script combine with the title of\nthe book two definite ideas, blue and gold. \" Where is the\nlittle blue vase with the lilies \" etc., and again, \" The dust\nshall be converted into fine ffold\" on July 19; and on\nJuly 26, \"Where is the blue book with gold tooling.\" The\nM. V. script of August 19, suggesting that lilies is half of a\nmessage adds, \" Your second word is gold think of the\n(\/olden lilies of France.\" The French shield being gold lilies\non a bhie ground, it is evident that the idea gold is here\nexpressed and blue implied. Miss Verrall's contemporaneous\nscript begins \" Bhie and gold were the colours, golden stars on\na blue ground,\" and her next script combines with the growing\nlilies a view over blue hills.\nThese are the only cases in the scripts of the period which\ncontain the word lilies. The conjunction of gold and blue\nwith the Euskin title in all three sets of scripts cannot be\nan accident. It is one of many indications of intelligence in\nthe conduct of the experiment. The word \" golden \" occurs\nonce in the M. V. script of the period in question, and \" gold\n\"\nor \" golden \" six times in the H. V. script.^ The mere occur-\nrence of such a common word is of no interest, and in the\n1\nThe word b\/ne occurs nowhere else in the Mac or M. V. script of the period,\nbut once in the H.

V. script ^ where it is not associated with\n\" blue \", there seems no trace of allusion to Sesame and Lilies.\nThis cannot, however, be said of the one passage where it is\nused in the M. V. script, though, did that passage stand\nalone, it would hardly deserve attention. As, however, it\nshows some trace of correspondence with the Mac script, I\nhave thought it best to transcribe it here and leave the reader\nto form his own opinion.\nOn August 11, 1908, the M. V. script begins with the\nwords\nAugust's ripened sheaves under the moon reapers in the field.\nShe stood breast high amid the golden corn. The fidl sheaves\nungarnered. With reaping hook and sickle who stands there.\nBut now write something quite different. . . . Good-b3''e. Tuus.\nThe \" she \" of the above is obviously Euth. The line of\nverse quoted seemed to me an inaccurate recollection of the\nline in Keats' Ode to the Nightingcde, \" She stood in tears\namid the alien corn,\" but my attention has been drawn by\nMiss Johnson to a poem of Hood's called Buth which contains\nthe lines,\n\" She stood breast-high amid the corn\nClasped by the golden light of morn.\"\nAs I have read Hood's poems it is quite possible that the source\nof the phrase is to be found in Hood, though the rhythm of\nthe line is unlike that of Hood's poem, and the allusion to\nKeats is perhaps made more probable by the introduction into\nthe script of the phrase \" under the moon.\" This does not seem\nan obvious idea in connexion with gleaning or reaping, but the\nevening time is naturally present in a reminiscence of Keats'\nOde, whereas Hood's poem distinctly refers to morning. How-\never, the crescent moon is closely associated in my mind with\nKuth, owing to a very familiar passage in Victor Hugo's L6gende\ncles Slides, I. ii., \" Booz Endormi.\"\n^Examination of tlie complete collection of H. V. scripts shows that the\nwords gold and golden are of fairly frequent occurrence; e.g. there are five\ninstances in September, 1908, two of which are quoted in the Appendix,\np. 315. It is the combination of gold with blue and its repetition which\ngives point to the scrijit of Aug. 19.\n\f284 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nIt is not easy to determine whether this script has any con-\nnexion with the group of scripts referring to Sesame and\nLilies. On the one hand the conjunction of gold with corn\nsuggests Sesame, and the reminiscence of Keats' Oclc is paral-\nlelled by the reminiscence of another line in the preceding\nstanza of the same Ode, in the H. V. script of August 21^, which\nis certainly one of the Sesame and Lilies group.^ There may\nbe an attempt at connexion with the Mac script, for on July 19,\nthe day when allusions to the liuskin mottoes were made, the\nMac script contained the words \" Euth 7 2 chapter 7 verse 2.\"\nThere is no such chapter in Ruth as 7 \u2014a fact noted by the\nautomatists\u2014and it is conceivable that the general intention\nof the script was to refer to the name Euth rather than to\nany particular passage of the book of liuth? But the allusion *\nis too indefinite to be interpreted with certainty.\nPrevious Knowledge on the paut of Automatists.\nBefore discussing some further points which arise in con-\nnexion with these references in the scripts, it will be convenient\nto state exactly what was the conscious knowledge of Euskin's\nbooks possessed by my daughter and myself* on September 1,\n1908, when we discovered, as we thought, an attempt to refer\nto Sesame and Lilies in our scripts.\nMiss Verrall, to the best of her belief, had never read Sesame\nand Lilies, Praeterita, or Unto this Last. She was familiar\nwith the phrase \" Sesame and Lilies \" as the title of a book of\nEuskin's, but did not recognise any allusions to his books in\n' See above, p. 279.\n-If we suppose an inversion of the figures and a reference to Ruth ii. 7, the\ntext is not inappropriate as a general reference to sheaves and reaping :\n\" And\nshe said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the\nsheaves : so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that\nshe tarried a little in the house.\"\n\"Four times in the Mac script there are references by chapter and verse to\npassages in the Bible. One of these is '\nRuth 7 2' as above. The other three\ncases all seem to have some relevance or intention. Two of them are discussed\nbelow, p. 295, and there again it seems as though the point of relevance were\nto be found in the name of the book, Ecdesiastes, rather than in either of\nthe verses indicated.\n*For the knowledge of Miss Mac see above, pp. 275-6.\n\fLX.] A New Group of Experimenters. 285\nthe phrases used in her script. She was familiar with Modern\nPainters, Stones of Venice, Ariadne Florentina, and most of the\nbooks on Art, but had read none of the biographical or socio-\nlogical works. No doubt the titles had been seen by her, but\nno suggestion of them was recalled to her mind by the appear-\nance in the script of the words \" praeterita rediviva \" on August\n12, or \"Unto this last\" on August 22.\nI read Euskin's Sesame and Lilies in the second edition\njDublished in 1865. This edition, covered in brown cloth,\ncontains the two -Manchester lectures and the original mottoes\nfrom Job and Canticles. The mottoes are printed in Greek\nwith references at the bottom of the page but no translations.\nThe book was read for the first time by me soon after its\npurchase by my mother in 1866,^ and was probably read\nmore than once between that date and 1870 or 1871. At\nthat time I knew no Greek at all, and if therefore I became\nacquainted with the meaning of the selected mottoes I must\nhave learnt it by looking up the references given, there being\nno indication whatever in the book itself as to the meaning\nof the mottoes. It is of course possible that I did look up\nthese references, but it is most unlikely that a child of my\nage\u20149 to 13\u2014should have done so, and there was no one\nin the house who could have translated the Greek. To the\nbest of my belief I did not read the book after this period\ntill October, 1908, when my interest in it had been revived\nby the occurrences above described.\nAt some time, probably in or soon after 1871, the revised\nand enlarged edition, bound in blue leather and containing the\nthree lectures and the mottoes from Lucian and Isaiah, was\ngiven to my mother, so that I was familiar with the appear-\nance of the blue bound volume as well as with the small\nearly brown cloth-covered volume which I had read. Part\nof Praeterita was read by me in its first appearance in Fors\nClavigcra about 1875 or 1876; Unto this Last, to the best\nof my belief, I have never read ; nor did I read the preface\nof the 1882 edition of Sesame and Lilies till October 1908.\nI had a pretty good general recollection of the two lectures\non Kings' Treasuries and Queens' Gardens, but no detailed\nremembrance of the contents of either.\n^ The date is noted in my mother's copy now belonging to Miss Merrifield.\n\f286 Mrs. A. W. VerraCl. [part\nIt was only when I read the brown cloth-covered edition\nat my father's house, where I went on September 28, 1908,\nthat I recognised in the Mac script allusions to the Greek\nmottoes, and it was not till some days later that I found\nthat different mottoes had been used in the later edition bound\nin blue leather. Nor was I aware that in 1907 the original\ntwo lectures of Sesame and Lilies together with the Two Paths\nand the King of the Golden River had been published in Every-\nvian's Library, with a preface by Sir Oliver Lodge.\nConnexion with Earlier Scripts.\nThe question arises whether the phrase \" Sesame and Lilies,\"\nthus successfully produced by a combination of three automatic\nscripts, is to be regarded as an isolated incident, or as forming\npart of a series. The reader will be better able to judge this\nafter considering other cases of cross- correspondence between\nthe Mac scripts and other scripts.^ But apart from the general\nquestion of the influences underlying the Mac script, there are\nsome indications that this particular incident forms part of a\nseries and is connected with other successful cross-correspondences.\nThe first point to notice is that the phrase \" Sesame and\nLilies \" appeared in an earlier script of Miss Verrall's, on\nMarch 17, 1907, in the course of the experiments with Mrs.\nPiper described in Volume XXII. of the Proceedings of the S.P.E.,.\npublished in October, 1908. No publication of Miss Verrall's\nscript of March 17, 1907, was made till Mr. Piddington's Eeport\nappeared, and it is therefore impossible that the phrase should\nhave been known by Miss Mac and her brother to have occurred\nin Miss Verrall's writing.^ The phrase occurs after a reference\nto laurel leaves for a wreath and a quotation from a poem of\nClough's, \" Say not the struggle nought availeth \" ; it is followed\n^See below, pp. 294-300.\n-No proof sheets of Vol XXII. were seen by Mis.s Mac or her brother, iior\nare the Mac family acquainted with any of the very small number of persons\nwho had any opportunity of seeing Miss Verrall's script before its publication\nin October, 1908. The script of March 17, 1907, was quoted in a paper read\nby Mr. Piddington at a private meeting for S.P.R. members only on Nov. 7,\n1907, but no report was printed in the Journal.

The script is given\nin Proceedings Vol. XXII. p. 99, in the discussion on the\ncross-correspondence \" Laurel Wreath,\" and Mr. Piddington\ntraces some associations of ideas in the earlier script down to\nand including the quotation from Clough, but has no explanation\nto offer of \" Sesame and Lilies \" or the words that follow.\nThe script of March 17, 1907, had been seen by me, so\nthat in July, 1908, the fact that \"Sesame and Lilies\" had\noccurred in H. V. script was known to my daughter and me,\nand was recalled to my mind early in August, 1908, when\nI read in proof the section of Mr. Piddington's paper which\ndiscussed the H. V. script of March 17, 1907. The references in\nthe Mac script to \" Sesame and Lilies \" were completed on July\n27, some days before I received the proofs of Mr. Piddington's\npaper. The revival of my recollection of the H. V. script of\nMarch 17, 1907, therefore, though it preceded the emergence\nof \" Sesame and Lilies \" in the Verrall scripts, was subsequent\nto its appearance in the Mac sciipts.\nOn July 20, 1908, the first script produced by me as part\nof the experiment in cross-correspondence between M. V. and\nH. V. script during Jvxly and August contained the same quota-\ntion from the poem of Clough as had appeared in my daughter's\nscript of March 17, 1907. The M. V. script of JiUy 20,\n1908, ran : \"Say not the struggle naught availeth. For where\nthe tired waves, vainly breaking\u2014and so on. Conies silent\n\u2014flooding in\u2014the main.\" The reference to Clough 's poem was\nnoted by me in copying the script on July 21, but it was\nonly on August 6,^ when reading the proof of Mr. Piddington's\npaper, Sec. IX., that I remembered that the same poem had\nbeen quoted in H. V. script of March 17, 1907. It is con-\nceivable that this quotation from Clough on July 20, 1908,\nrepresents the first emergence in my script of an idea already\nformed and subsequently defined in all three scripts as \" Sesame\nand Lilies,\" words associated long before in H. V. script with\nthe poem of Clough's.\n' My diary and other contemporai'y notes show the dates of my reading the\nproofs of Mr. Piddington's Report. I had not received the section referring to\nmy daughter's script of March 17, 1907, when my own script of July 20, 1908,\nproduced the quotation from Clough.\n\f288 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nI have no theory to offer as to where or when that idea\nwas formed. I mention the circumstance here, as it may have\nsome bearing on the case under consideration. The words,\n\" Sesame and Lilies,\" in my daughter's script of March 17,\n1907, are the only reference before August, 1908, that we\nhave found in the whole of her script to Euskin or any of\nhis works. Euskin's name occurs once in my script of March\n19, 1905, in an attempt, possibly veridical, to establish a\nconnexion with Mrs. Holland. The object described is a picture\nof which it is said in the script \" Euskin has written of it.\"^\nIt is a point worth noting that the development of the\nSidgwick control in the Mac script corresponded closely in\npoint of time with the inauguration of the new cross-corre-\nspondence experiment between my daughter and myself The\nfirst appearance of Sidgwickjj is on July 19, 1908, and on that\nday begin the allusions in the Mac script to \" Sesame and\nLilies.\" Our first contemporaneous sitting for script was on\nJuly 20, 1908, and on that day in my script emerges\nthe quotation from Clough which sixteen months before had\nimmediately j)receded in Miss Verrall's script the words \" Sesame\nand Lilies.\" No special reason has been found by any of the\nautomatists concerned for associating Sesame and Lilies with\nDr. Sidgwick. Headers of his biography ^ or of his collected\nessays might easily find a link between him and Clough, and\nto me and my daughter the names of Clough and Sidgwick\nare intimately associated. But whereas the reference to Clough\noccurs in her script of March 17, 1907, and in mine of\nJuly 20, 1908, the name Sidgwick is found only in the\nMac script, which contains no allusion to Clough.\nEesemblances in Scripts to Contents of \" Sesame and\nLilies.\"\nThe next point to notice is a certain similarity between\nthe contents of two of the scripts^ and the concluding paragraphs\niSee Proceedimis S.P.R., Vol. XXI. p. 254.\n-See, for instance, Memoir, p. 141.\n^Between the verse of H.

The\nfirst script (one of Miss Verrall's) falls outside the period of\n\"Sesame and Lilies\" scripts (August 12-22, 1908). It was\nproduced after the comparison of scripts had suggested to us\nthat an attempt had been unsuccessfully made to produce\n\" Sesame and Lilies \" as a cross-correspondence, but before the\nreading of the Mac script had revived any interest in the\nsubject. On September 1-1, 1908, the H. V. script contained\nthe folio win\"\no\nIn the meadows where bloom the daisies and young maids' feet\nare tripping in the dance\u2014around the Maypole on the village green\nour English may, the hawthorn's scented pride, the bridal wreath of\nsummer Queen of May\u2014the light fantastic toe.\nAnd Holbein's dance too, the dance of Death.\nSections 93 and 94 of Euskin's second lecture, Queens\nGardens\u2014never read by Miss Verrall\u2014contain the following :\nHave you ever considered what a deep under meaning there lies\n... in our custom of strewing flowers . . . that . . . they will tread\non herbs of sweet scent . . .

On July 26, 1908, the\nsame day on which was produced the allusion to the blue\nleather-bound book, there also came two quotations from\nTennyson's poem of Maud. A first hint of one of these\nis probably to be traced in the phrase of July 19, \"May\nI go to the wind kissed hollow.\" But whether that be\nso or not, the phrase on July 26, \"I hate the little hollow,\"^\nis unmistakably a quotation from Maud, and was recognised as\nsuch in Miss Mac's annotations. The second quotation from\nMaud on July 26 is as follows: \" Eoses in the west, Eoses in\nthe south, Eoses in her cheeks, And a rose her mouth.\"\nThis quotation was recognised also as from Maud ; it is not\ncorrectly quoted ; in the first two lines \" Eoses in \" should be\n\" Eosy is,\" and \" in \" in the third line should be \" are.\"\nFrom no other poem are two quotations given in the Mac\nscript ; and this fact in itself throws emphasis on Tennyson's\nMaud. Eeaders of Mr. Piddington's Eeport\u2014not published when\nthe Mac script was produced\u2014will not need to be reminded\nof the important part played in the most elaborate of all the\ncross-correspondences, \" Light in West \" (Section XIX.), by the\nallusion to Maud ;\n\" Eosy is the East and so on,\" in my script\nof April 8, 1907 (Proc. XXII. p. 271).\nIt is therefore of some interest to find in a script endeavour-\ning to establish cross-correspondence with me, an allusion to a\nquotation which in my own script played a part in establishing\ncross-correspondences with other automatists. But there is a\nspecial suitability in this particular case in the choice of this\nquotation from Maud, as will be seen by a reader who will\ncompare some sentences from Mr. Piddington's Eeport with the\nconcluding paragraphs of Euskin's Sesame and Lilies. Mr.\nPiddington writes (p. 276) of\nthat famous passage in Maud where the lover, waiting for Maud\nin the high Hall-garden, sees just before the dawn (as did the lover\nDante waiting on the Mount of Purgatory to begin the ascent that\nis to bring him finally to Beatrice) the planet of Love,\n1 The actual phrase in Maud is, \"I hate the dreadful hollow behind the\nlittle wood;\" in the script it runs, \"I hate the little hollow\u2014woods of box.\"\n\fLX.] A New Group of Experimenters. 291\nand the reader will remember that Dante immediately there-\nafter enters the Terrestrial Paradise and sees beyond the river\nof Lethe Matilda gathering flowers. Euskin writes :\nShall morning follow morning . . . but no dawn rise to breathe\nupon these living banks of wild violet, and woodbine, and rose ; nor\ncall to you, through your casement\u2014call (not giving you the name\nof the English poet's lady, but the name of Dante's great Matilda,\nwho, on the edge of happy Lethe, stood, wreathing flowers with flowers),\nsaying: \"Come into the garden, Maud.\"\nIt cannot be an accident that selects as a subject for cross-\ncorrespondence between Sidgwickji (with the concurrence ^ of\nMyersji) on the one hand and Myersy and Myersjjv on the other,\nthe title of a book of Euskin's where, in a most characteristic\npassage, the author makes use of a twice repeated quotation from\nTennyson, to introduce a comparison between the English poet's\nMaud in her garden, and Dante's Matilda in the Earthly Paradise.\nFurther Eeferences in the Mac Script.\nOne further reference to the subject of this cross-correspond-\nence was made by Sidgwickji. On October 7th, 1908, Miss\nMac received from me a general comment on the script sent\nto me, but no reference whatever was made to the words,\n\" Sesame and Lilies,\" or to Euskin, nor was anything said that\ncould have suggested to the automatists that I was interested\nin the book. The Mac script, obtained on that day, after the\narrival of my letter, contained the words :\n\" The crucial test\nis the lost book lost lost lost.\" This was followed by a\ndrawing of a book twice repeated. The drawing shows an\nopened book with a floral decoration upon the binding. It\nis impossible to name the flower or foliage represented.\nFor some few days'- before this script was obtained I had\nbeen engaged in investigating the various editions of Sesame\nand Lilies in connexion with the question of introductory\nmottoes and bindings, and in particular I had been trying to\ntrace, but without success, the blue leather-bound copy of\n1 See above, p. 268 and Appendix, p. 307.\n^ See above, p. 286.

Two phrases in it repeat or recall\nphrases used in the allusions on July 19 and 26.

This control, Sidgwickji, used phrases re-\ncalling the two mottoes prefixed in the earlier editions of\nEuskin's Sesame and Lilies to the two lectures. On July 26\nSidgwickjj referred to a book carefully bound in blue leather.\nOn July 27 Sidgwickjj gave the phrase \"Sesame and Lilies,\"\nand on July 29 said that he was now trying to get a message\nfor Mrs. Verrall. But the automatists did not enter into com-\nmunication at this time with me.\nOn August 19, 1908, in my script, MyerSy produced \"Lilies\"\nas half of a message, which was to be completed, through some\nother automatist, with another word. The Lilies were described\nas being in a garden, and it was stated that for the completion\nof the incident the experimenter must wait some time. Con-\ntemporaneously on August 12, 19, and 22, Myers^y produced\nreferences to growing lilies and other connected topics, and also\ngave two titles of books by Euskin, titles which were subse-\nquently found to have been intimately associated by Euskin\nhimself with Sesame and Lilies.\nOn September 1, 1908, my daughter and I compared\nour recent scripts for July and August, and recognised\nthat about the middle of August there had been what we\nregarded as an unsuccessful attempt to give Euskin's title.\nSesame and Lilies, as a cross-correspondence between the two\nscripts. But we made no note of this opinion.\nBetween September 12 and 18, 1908, another control in the\nMac script urged that the messages of Sidgwickjj should be sent\nto Mrs. A^errall by September 26, and these messages were\ndespatched, with a letter from Miss Mac, on September 23.^\nMeanwhile on September 23 there were allusions in Miss\nVerrall's script to Sesame and Lilies, in phrases reminiscent of\nthe scripts concerned in the previous attempt at cross-corre-\nspondences between her scripts and mine. This script therefore\nserves as a record of the impression formed by us on September\n1, but not then recorded.\nOn September 26 a comparison of the statements by\nSidgwickjj with those of MyerSy and Myers^y showed that the\nphrase suggested in the Verrall scripts had been expressed in\nthe Mac script.\n1 Posted September 24, 1908.\n\f294 Mrs. A.

[part\nConclusions.\nIt; is claimed that the intimate inter-connexions of this episode\nare not due to accident, and that they show throughout a\nperception of the general situation, as well as a knowledge of\ncertain facts outside the range of the automatists concerned.\nIn particular it is claimed that intelligence is shown in the\nfollowing points :\n(a) In the division of the subject between three automatists\nand the distribution between them of various topics ;\nthus, while\nthere are inter-connexions between all the scripts of the ideas\nLilies, Blue, and Gold, the titles of Ruskin's two other books\noccur only in H. V. script, the full title Sesame and Lilies, as\nwell as the allusions to the prefixed mottoes, occurs only in the\nMac script, while the indication that Lilies is one of two words\nintended for a cross-correspondence is suggested in M. V. script.\n(b) In the withholding of the Mac script from Mrs. Verrall till\nafter the comparison of M. V. and H. V. scripts on September 1,\nand in the sending of the Mac script before the separation of\nMrs. and Miss Verrall.\n(c) In the registration in H. V. script of September 23 of\nthe impression produced on Mrs. and Miss Verrall by the com-\nparison of their scripts on September 1, but not recorded by\nthem.\n(d) In the choice of titles of Euskin's books named in H. V.\nscript, these two titles being, as was subsequently discovered,\nintimately associated as no other two books could be with the\nname Sesame and Lilies.\n(f) In the choice of the subject of the cross-correspondence,\nthe contents of Euskin's Sesame and Lilies being linked by an\neasy association of ideas with other subjects already successfully\nused in cross-correspondences by MyerSp, MyerSy, and MyerSjj.\nCross-Correspondence.\n\" Vanity of Vanities.\"\nThe name of the control, as I have said, was introduced four\ntimes into the script of July 27, 1908 (see above, p. 269). The\nphrase \" Sesame and Lilies \" followed upon its second use.\n1\n\fLX.] A New Group of Experimenters. 295\nImmediately after its third use came the words :\n\" Vanity of\nvanities all is vanity,\" followed by a line . Between this\nphrase and a phrase in H. V. script I am disposed to see a\ncorrespondence ; the connexion is scarcely disputable, but the\nH. V. script precedes the inception of the Mac script by some\nsix weeks.\nOn June 1st, 1908,-^ the H. V. script contained the following:\nLay not up to yourselves treasure upon earth, something about\nmoth and corruption and the worm shall devour it.\nVanitas vanitatum.\nThe anchor mark that well.\nIn M. V. and H. V. scripts the anchor, the symbol of hope, has\nlong been connected with Dr. Sidgwick.- It is therefore beyond\ndispute that on June 1, 1908, the H. V. script connected the\nphrase \" Vanitas vanitatum \" with a Sidgwick symbol, and empha-\nsised the importance of the connexion.^\nOn July 21, 1908, Sidgwickjf wrote: \"Evelyn\nfaithful unto death. Ecclesiastes 3. 2.\" On July 26 Sidgwickji,\nimmediately after the description of the blue leather-bound book,^\nwrote \"Ecclesiastes seven and three.\" On July 27 Sidgwickjj,\nimmediately after giving the words \" Sesame and Lilies,\" wrote :\n\" Vanity of vanities all is vanity.\" ^\nEcclesiastes 3. 2 is as follows : \"A time to be born and a time\nto die ; a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is\nplanted.\" Ecclesiastes 7. 3 is as follows :\n\" Sorrow is better than\nlaughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is\nmade better.\" It is of course possible that one or both of these\ntexts were intentionally referred to in the script, but in the\nabsence of verbal quotation and in view of the fact that a text\nactually quoted without reference on July 27, 1908, is from\nEcclesiastes, it is more probable that the earlier references to texts\n^ One piece of H. V. script (on June 10) was produced after this before Miss\nVerrall went to Switzerland. No further script was produced till July 20.\n- See Proc.

The reader of JEcclcsiastcs will\nremember that the idea of Vanity is so prevalent throughout the\nbook that by a common association of ideas an approach to the\nfamiliar \"Vanity of vanities\" might easily be made by means\nof general allusions to the book of Ecclesiastes}\nAnother reason for connecting the earlier references to\nEcclesiastes on July 21 and 26 with the quotation of July\n27 is to be found in the context of the three scripts.\nThroughout the Mac script the Sidgwick control is associ-\nated with faith, charity, and hope, and their symbols\u2014the\ncross, heart, and anchor.- Thus on July 19, the first com-\nmunication claimed by Sidgwickjf was headed by his name and\nshortly followed by the drawing of a cross j^^\"^ and the\nwords \"faithful unto death.\" On July 21, in a communication\nfrom Sidgwickjf, this was repeated, and a little later, just before\nthe reference to Ecclesiastes 3. 2, came the words, \"Evelyn\nfaithful unto death.\" The same script later contains\nthe drawing of an anchor. On July 23 the script begins,\n\"Sidgwick These three hope faith chai-ity.\" On July 26 are\nfound drawings of cross, heart, and anchor, and, a little later,\nthe star is drawn, followed again by the words, \" Faithful unto\ndeath.\"\nUnder these circumstances there is no doubt that both the\nearlier references to Ecclesiastes, as well as the actual verbal\nquotation on July 27, are claimed by Sidgwickjf. Moreover,\nin the script of July so claimed there are two, and only two\ndrawings of an anchor, and these come upon the only two\ndays (out of nine days on which Sidgwickjj wrote) on which\nis mentioned the name Ecclesiastes.\nWhen it is remembered that in the H. V. script of June 1\nthe phrase \" vanitas vanitatum \" was immediately followed by\nthe words \" The anchor mark that well,\" it will be seen that\n^ See above, p. 284, for a similar suggestion to explain the reference to a\nnon-existent chapter in the book of Ruth.\n^See Proc.

The interval between the two scripts is greater than\nin the last instance, being rather over four months. On the\nother hand, the connexion is definitely marked by the occurrence\nin both scripts of a similar word, irrelevant to the poem, but\nwith a certain appropriateness to the whole situation.\nOn March 16, 1908, the H. V. script ran as follows:^\nLa vie est breve\nUn pen d'espoir\nUn pen de reve\nEt puis bonsoir.\nThe end of the story.\nLike a crimson petalled rose the rose of Sharon.\nWhen the proof was sought he told them that the only means\nof obtaining it was to persevere in the attempt to prove the\nconnexion.\nGautier and Hugo those together types to be compared.\nUnless there is a possibiHty of setting the two side by side there\nwould be no opportunity.\nis is the\nnow at his ease.\n[drawing of flower] note this flower.\nThe end of the script is fragmentary and obscure.

The script was at the\ntime interpreted by Miss Verrall as suggesting that a cross-\ncorrespondence of some kind was intended. It had been\nobtained on a day when she and I were intending to write\nsimultaneously, but I had been prevented from trying for\nscript.\nOn July 27, 1908, the Mac script, immediately after the\nwords, above quoted, \"all is vanity \" went on:\nA little love and then the joy fades and the rose is crumpled\nand wither(s) up\u2014fane. [Here the automatists asked what was the\nlast word and the script went on: \"French,\" and added an accent\nto the e of the preceding word, thus converting fane into fanL\nIt then concluded :] Bleeding hearts cannot be staunched and the\nvoice of death echoes through the brain with palling monotony\nSidgwick\u2014hollow and mortal vain is life without a meaning.\nThis script at once reminded me of the first stanza of the\npoem by Victor Hugo, very familiar to me, of which the\nsecond stanza has been quoted above. The first stanza runs\n\" La vie est vaine\nUn peu d'amour\nUn peu de haine\nEt puis bonjour !\n\"\nThe allusions are unmistakable: \"A little love\" translates\nun peu d'amour \" ; the rhyme is given by \" fane,\" again\nperhaps by \" brain,\" and in the final sentence the phrase\n\" Vain is life \" translates \" la vie est vaine \"\n;\n\" French\n\"\nsuggests the language wanted.\nThe poem was known to Miss Mac, for though in her first\nannotations she only wrote :\n\"\n' Vain is life without a meaning\n'\nseems familiar: origin of quotation, if it be one, not known,\"\nshe wrote later in answer to my question, whether the\nautomatists knew a poem of Victor Hugo's which begins\n'\nLa vie est vaine,' \" that all knew it, and that she ought to\nhave mentioned that \" a little love \" in the script recalled\nthis poem to her, but that what followed in the script was\nso different that she did not think it could refer to the\nHugo poem.\n\fLX.] A Neiu Group of Experimenters. 299\nIt is in itself not remarkable that the H. V. script on\nMarch 16, 1908, and the Mac script on July 27, 1908,\nshould quote from a poem of Victor Hugo's known to both\nautomatists. It is more remarkable that each script quotes a\ndifferent verse, and that in one case, the H. V. script, the words\n\" the end of the story \" indicate that the second and concluding\nverse is deliberately chosen. Moreover, in this case it was\nplainly indicated that a cross-correspondence was intended, and\nthat unless \" two \" could be set side by side some opportunity\nwould be lost. But what clinches the whole matter and dis-\nposes of the theory that the correspondence is accidental, is\nthe introduction into both scripts of the word \" rose,\" a word\nwhich has no association whatever with either verse of the\noriginal poem. And the rose of the H. V. script is, it should\nbe observed, the \" rose of Sharon,\" a phrase which occurs in the\nMac script in connexion with the allusions to Sesame and Lilies.\nIt will be admitted that here again Sidgwickjj had good\nreason to include in the four topics of his message to me of July\n27, 1908, the combination of a rose with the first stanza of\na poem of which the second stanza, also combined with a rose,\nwas known by me to have occurred four months before in\nmy daughter's script.\nKe-echo of Peevious Experiments.\nI now return to the first of the topics of July 27, 1908,\nin which I see not a cross-cori'espondence with a contemporary\nautomatist\u2014as in the three already described \u2014but rather a\nreminiscence or re-echo of the subject of a previous successful\n\u2022experiment in automatic cross-correspondence.\nThe Mac script of July 27, 1908, began as follows:\nSidgwick. news from the Occident [drawing of stalked rose\nwith leaf] Roses\u2014dew-kissed. \u2014R. S.^\nNeither of these phrases is, as far as I have been able to\ndiscover, a quotation. The second recalls \" Sharon's dewy\n^ These initials which were not looked on by the automatists as the signature\nof a control, had occurred before, on July 20. There they came in the midst\nof the script, just as 6. V. occurs in the script of July 21 (see Appendix).\nThe initials R. S. have not been identified or explained.\n\f300 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nrose\" of the script of July 19; but no phrase at all like\nthe first is to be found in the script. Between the two there\nis no obvious connexion, but the whole arrangement of the\nscript indicates that they form part of a single topic, the\nnext topic, Sesame and Lilies, being introduced by a repetition\nof the name of the control.\nRegarded as forming a whole, the two clauses seem to\npresent a certain contrast or opposition ; news is announced\nfrom the setting sun, whereas it is rather with the rising of the\nsun that we associate dew-kissed roses, as it is in the morning\nthat we find dew upon the roses. It is in this contrast that\nI conceive to be the point of the message. The words of\nSidgwicku are not quotations, it is true, but we may find\ntheir literary prototype, and a parallel, not only to \" news\nfrom the Occident \" but to news from the Occident that might\nvery well find the \" roses dew-kissed \", in the poem of Maud,\nwhere the poet bids the happy day\n\" Pass the happy news .\nBlush it thro the West\nTill the West is East,\nBlush it thro' the West.\"\nHere then is '\nnews from the ' West, and news intimately\nassociated with '\nroses.' Tennyson's Maud, as I have already\nsaid,^ is the only poem from which two quotations are given\nby Sidgwickjj. The second of those two quotations, after a\npreliminary attempt on July 21, emerged on July 26 \u2014the\nday preceding the collected messages to me\u2014in a reproduction\nof the four lines\n\"Eosy is the West\nEosy is the South\nRoses are her cheeks\nAnd a rose her mouth,\"\nwith the substitution in the first two lines of \" Eoses in\nfor \" Eosy is,\" and in the third of \" Eoses in \" for \" Eoses\nare.\niSee p. 290.\n\fLX.] A Neiv Group of Experimenters. 301\nAt the time that the Mac script was produced, Mr.\nPiddington's Eeport {Proc. Vol. XXII.) was not published, and\nno paper had been read at any meeting of the Society on the\nsubject of Section XIX., \" Light in West,\" in which he describes\nthe series of complicated cross-correspondences between the trance\nof Mrs. Piper and the scripts of Mrs. Holland and myself.\nThese are grouped round the three concordant contributions\nmade on April 8, 1907 {o^o. cit. pp. 265-77); the contribution\nof my script was the substitution of \" east \" for \" west \" in\na quotation from the same poem from Maud (l. xvii.), which\nis quoted in the Mac script of July 21 and 26, 1908. The\nautomatists had no knowledge of any of these scripts, or of\nMr. Piddington's conclusions. Whatever view we may hold as\nto the meaning of the opening words of the Mac script of\nJuly 27, 1908, it is certain that on July 26 the script\nquoted the same line which had been referred to in my\nscript of April 8, 1907. But to me it appears that the\nopening sentence of Sidgwickji on July 27, 1908, conveyed\nan unmistakable allusion to the \" concatenation of cross-\ncorrespondences \" described by Mr. Piddington as \" Light in\nWest,\" and represented in the Mac script as \" News from the\nOccident.\"\nThis is not the only '\nre-echo ' in the Mac script. There\nis in the script of July 26th, 1908, an unmistakeable allusion\nto an incident described in my Eeport on my automatic writing\n{Proc. S.P.R. Vol. XX.) which there is every reason to believe\nunknown to the automatists. The Eeport was published in\nOctober, 1906, and it is therefore impossible to be certain\nthat some notice of the volume did not come within the\ncognisance of one of the automatists concerned, though none\nof the family had read the Eeport in question.^ The reader\nmust judge how far it is probable that a review, or notice,\nor even a perusal of the Eeport is likely to be responsible for\nthe incident which I now describe.\nOn July 26, 1908, the Mac script passed on from the\nquotation from Maud l. xvii. to an allusion to a well-known\n1 See above, p. 266, for a statement of the automatists' previous knowledge\nof the publications of the S.P.E. Both Miss E. Mac and Mr. A. Mac state\nthat, to the best of their knowledge, they did not read my Report or any\nreview of it.\n\f302 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.

The words were juovottoAop e? aco\n(\" to the one-horse or solitary dawn \"). They were taken\nfrom a chorus in the Orestes of Euripides\" describing a reversal\nof natural phenomena. Both the meaning and the sound of\nthe words were attempted in the script. Among those attempts\nwere the following^:\ndawn - J^^ly '1-\ntowards the east -A-ug. 16.\nto the east -^ug. 29.\nin the east like stars Sept. 7.\nBanipal and Assur . . . Asta, aster Sept. 7.\nThe resemblance between my Report and the Mac script\ncannot be accidental, and that Sidgwickjj associated the phrases\nwith me is manifest, not only from their occurrence in script\nwhich the automatists were told to send to me, and which\nproved to be full of \" messages \" appropriate and intelligible\nto me, but also because the phrases are immediately followed by\nthe words \" the passionate pilgrim,\" words which in my script of\nJan. 17, 1904, had been associated with Dr. Sidgwick. This\nlatter fact was known to the automatists, since the script in\nquestion was quoted in Miss Johnson's Beport,* so that if this\ncase stood alone, it would be difhcult to resist the conclusion\nthat certain passages from my Eeport, in particular the copy of\nthe script of Sept. 7, 1901, had also been seen at some time by\none of the automatists and retained by the subliminal memory.\nBut the case does not stand alone.

Under these circumstances it is justifiable to point\nout that there appears to be a certain intelligence shown in\nthe selection of the very few words used on July 26, 1908,\nto recall my husband's experiment. These words are not an\nexact reproduction of anything in the script. They summarise\nthe account in my Eeport and emphasise with remarkable\naccuracy the chief points ;\nnamely, the long series of \" illegible\nGreek characters,\" ^ the attempts to give \" three foreign words\n\"\n(Assur bani pal -), and the use of Latin (aster) in the script.\nThe general meaning of the passage selected from Euripides,\nwhich describes the reversal of natural phenomena, is well\nreproduced in the phrase, \" 0 star of the dawn to the porch\nof the east,\"\u2014the natural progression of the star of dawn, as\nof other stars, being from the porch of the east.\nI have now described the four topics in the Mac script of\nJuly 27, 1908, which accompany the four uses of the name\nof the supposed control. But before concluding the whole\naccount, it remains to comment on five words, which occur\nafter the phrase \" Sesame and Lilies \" and before the third\n\" Sidgwick,\" thus\nSidgwick Sesame and Lilies lotus the flower of repentance.\nEeference to \" lotus \" is very frequent in the preceding script,\nand the actual words of July 27 had occurred on July 19.\n(July 19.)

W. Verrall. [part\nMiss Mac's note on allusions etc., in the script runs as\nfollows : \"All references to Lotus thought to be from Holland\nscript.\" The passage of which Miss Mac was thinking is to be\nfound in Miss Johnson's Eeport (Proc. Vol. XXI. p. 350):\nFrom the ancient lotus symbol\nThe inevitable lily\nPurity\u2014immortality\nDetachment from Earthly Care\nKarma\u2014no\nOm mani pudmi om !\nThese words are followed by a \" rough attempt to depict\nthe seed-vessel of the lotus, a frequent ornament in Buddhist\ncarving.\" The words mean :\n\" Oh thou jewel in the lotus,\nthou!\" and the \"jewel in the lotus\" symbolises purity as\nwell as heavenly wisdom and is sometimes rendered as \" the\nheart of the lily.\"\nThere seems little doubt that the references in the Mac\nscript are directly traceable to the above passage in Miss\nJohnson's Eeport on the Holland script. It is possible that\nthe association there and elsewhere of lily and lotus has\nbrought in the \"lotus\" just after the \"lilies\" of \"Sesame and\nLilies\" on July 27. But having regard to the relevance of\nall the other script on July 27, I am disposed to think that\nthere is some reason not hitherto discovered for the introduction\nof this reminiscence of Mrs. Holland's script of May 15,\n1906.\nSummary and Conclusion of Incident.\nThe whole script therefore of July 27, 1908, is as follows:\nSidgvvick.

News from the Occident.\n(2.) Sesame and Lilies.\n(3.) Vanity of vanities.\n(4.) One stanza of Victor Hugo's poem.\nThese four topics are not wholly disconnected among them-\nselves : the roses of (1) are repeated by the rose ^ of (4), which\nis not suggested by the poem. Again the vanity of (3) is\nrepeated by the vain of (4). In the case of topics (2) and\n(4) there are a few superfluous words,- but in both those cases\nthe reference to the main topic is perfectly definite.\nFurther, I take the script of July 27 to be a summary of\nvarious attempts that had been made by the same control\nfrom July 19, 1908, onwards, to convey verifiable matter of\nevidential value that would be comprehensible to me, as is\nmade plain by the script of July 29, 1908, which, pui'porting\nto come from another control, \" Evans,\" is as follows\nAbout Mr, Sidgwick's script.

On\nSeptember 27, when automatic writing was attempted, the\nonly words written were from another control, not Sidgwickjj,\n\" Wait till V writes Wednesday week,\" i.e. till October 7.\nOn September 29 Miss Mac received from me a letter of\nacknowledgment, in which I wrote that it would be some\ntime before I could comment in detail on the script. On\nSeptember 30 the Mac script again repeated, as from\nSidgwickjj, \" Wait till Wednesday, because of V's preoccupation,\"\nthe \"Wednesday\" being again October 7.

[PAKT\n4 p.m., my letter commenting at length on the script was\nreceived by Miss Mac. I, who of course knew nothing of any\nstatements in the Mac script subsequent to September 23, had\nfinished my comment earlier than I had expected or led Miss\nMac to suppose. So that the original directions of September\n27, repeated on September 30, that no more script was to be\nproduced till \" V \" wrote on October 7, were justified by the\nevent. The Mac script of October 7, produced after the receipt\nof my letter, contributed only one sentence referring to the\ncross-correspondence on Sesame and Lilies, namely the allusion\nto the \" lost book \" which has been already described.\nHere for the present ends the account of the communications\nreceived from Miss Mac. At a future time I hope to supple-\nment this paper by notes on further indications in the Mac\nscript of telepathic connexion with other automatists, including\nsome re-echoes of recognised but unpublished cross-correspon-\ndences.

The references in Mrs. Holland's script occurred\nin December, 1908, whereas the chief references in the Mac\nscript were in July, and in the Verrall script in August, 1908.\nOf course the belatedness of Mrs. Holland's references detracts\nfrom their evidential value by giving more opportunity for the\ncoincidences to occur by chance. But it happened that Mrs.\nHolland produced only one piece of script between March\n11th and November 25th, 1908, that one (dated July 23,\n1908), being concerned with the cross-correspondence of\n\"Sevens,\" given in my paper above (pp. 222-263).\nAfter this almost blank period, she began to write again,\ngenerally once a week, from November 25, 1908, onwards.\nErom that date up to April 14, 1909, she produced twenty\npieces of script, in which have been found nine cross-corre-\nspondences with Mrs. Piper's script of a few months before,\nviz. the period from March 17 to May 12, 1908, besides\nsome evidential matter connected with the Verrall scripts, all\nof which I propose to deal with later. It looks, therefore, as\nif Mrs. Holland, on resuming her script, began to pick up\nthe topics (all, of course, unpublished at that time), treated of\nsome months earlier by the other automatists, for the connec-\ntions then appearing seem too numerous to be put down to\nchance. Consequently I think that the occurrence of passages\nin her script referring to \" Sesame and Lilies \" is not accidental,\nbut has some supernormal connection with the analogous pas-\nsages in the scripts of the other automatists.\n\f320 Alice Johnson. [part\nIt must be noted that Mrs. Holland's references did not\noccur until after Mrs. Verrall had seen the other scripts and\nmade out the connections between them and the various topics\ntreated of, so that it seems likely that she was influenced by\ntelepathy from Mrs. Verrall. The influence of her own mind\nis also obvious here. Her range of poetical reading is,\nas I have already said, unusually wide, and her script as a\nwhole is characterised by a profusion of quotations ; but in\nthis case her contributions to the cross-correspondence consist\nof hardly anything else. The poetical form taken by the\nscript may, then, be attributed to her own mind ; but for the\nselection of quotations appropriate to the subject some other cause\nmust, of course, be found. She does not, it will be seen, quote\nfrom any of the literary sources drawn on by the other auto-\nmatists, and incidentally she introduces certain topics belonging\nto the subject, but not to be found in any of the other scripts.\nThe first passage to be considered occurs in her script of\nDecember 9th, 1908.\n... A circling diadem of quivering star\n\"Three queens with crowns of gold and from them rose\nA cry that shivered to the tingling stars.\" ^\n[Here follow references to other topics, quite unconnected with this.]\n\"Blame not the Royal Saint for vain expense.\"\nCharge not tlie Roj'al Saint\n\u2014\nKing\u2014\nNot a sign\u2014the actual reliquary with the jewels and\ndLy% the crystal\u2014rock crystal\u2014It is in the Museum now and\nT\"*^ it should be in the Library.\n^ \"Tax not the Royal Saint\u2014\"\nThe third attempt, \" Tax not the Eoyal Saint with vain\nexpense,\" is the correct rendering of the first line of Words-\nworth's sonnet on the \" Inside of King's College Chapel.\"\nThis script contains two words that are prominent in the\nother scripts, viz.:\n(1) Gold: which occurs both in the Mac and the Verrall\nscripts.\n(2) Stars: cf. Miss Verrall's script of Aug. 19, 1908.\n^Tennyson, lilorte cVArthur. \\\n\fLX.] Sequel to the \"Sesame and Lilies\" Incident. 321\nIt also gives one important factor of the whole subject\n\" Sesame and Lilies \" which is not mentioned by any of the\nother automatists, viz.: \"Queens:\" the sub-title of the essay\n\" Lilies \" being \" Queens' Gardens.\"\nNote further the word \" Kino \" associated with the idea of\nsome kind of treasure, the jewels and the crystal \" : the\nsub-title of the essay \" Sesame \" being \" Kings' Treasuries.\"\nIn this essay Euskin complains bitterly of the English nation\nfor \" despising literature, despising science, despising art . . .\nand concentrating its soul on Pence,\" and justifies his complaint\nby showing what a very small proportion of the national\nwealth is spent on such objects as libraries, scientific work\nand art. Compare the sonnet quoted from by Mrs. Holland\nTax not the royal Saint with vain expense,\nWith ill-matched aims the Architect who planned\nAlbeit labouring for a scanty band\nOf white-robed Scholars only\u2014this innneuse\nAnd glorious Work of fine intelligence !\nGive all thou canst ;\nhigh Heaven rejects the lore\nOf nicely-calculated less or more ;\nSo deemed the man who fashioned for the sense\nThese lofty pillars, spread that branching roof\nSelf-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,\nWhere light and shade repose, where music dwells\nLingering\u2014and wandering on as loth to die\nLike thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof\nThat they were born for immortality.\nAgain, the third and last sonnet on King's Chapel begins :\nThey dreamt not of a perishable home\nWho thus could build.\nThere seems a possible connection between this script and\nMiss Verrall's of Sep. 1, 1908, which describes \"a Maltese\ncross, crystal and gold, hung on a fine gold chain \" and\nconnected with \"a royal tragedy\" (see above, p. 315); and\nboth scripts are possibly connected with the Mac script of\nSep. 14, 1908, which has the words \"crystal,\" \"jewels\" or\n\" jewel \" (three times repeated) and a drawing of three decorated \u00ab\ncrosses (see above, p. 310), Further, the Mac script on the\nX\n\f322 Alice Johnson. [part\nnext two clays, Sep. 15 and 18, had drawings of a crystal;\nwhereas Mrs. Holland's next script, that of Dec. 16, 1908,\ncontains the words\nCrystal\u2014the terrible crystal.^\nThe next references occur in Mrs. Holland's script of\nDecember 23rd, 1908 :\n. . .

A number of\ninteresting references to Eoden Noel had occurred in Mrs.\nHolland's earlier scripts, and an account of these was published\nin my first Eeport (Proceedings, Vol. XXL pp. 316-327).\nMrs. Holland had read this report and therefore knew of his\nassociation with Cornwall, and that the names \" Gary, Carew\nhad occurred in her script in connection with \" Fowey,\" which\nI had interpreted as a reference to a poem of his (op. cit.\npp. 350-351).\nFurther, for some reason which I am unable to conjecture,\nshe seems subliminally to associate his name with the notion\n^ Browning, The Englishman in Itnly :\n\" Oh heaven and the terrible crystal !\nNo rampart excludes\nYour eye from the life to be lived\nIn the blue solitudes.\"\n^Milton, Lycidas. ^Milton, Paradise Lost, Book iv.\n*E.

She did not know of their friend-\nship at the time when her script first associated them,\nbut had since learnt of it from my Eeport. It will\nbe remembered that it was a Sidgwick control that\npurported to inspire the Mac script in this cross-\ncorrespondence.\nIn regard to the rest of the script, it is perhaps worth\nnoting that a passage from Lycidas is selected by Ruskin to\nillustrate the teaching of his Sesame, whereas Mrs. Holland\nquotes the last line of it (a line not included in Euskin's\nquotation). This, however, may be an accidental coincidence.\nBut there is, I think, an unmistakable connection between her\nlast two quotations\n\" He for God only, she for God in him.\"\n\"Farewell, the flowers of Eden\nYe shall pick nevermore,\"\nand Mrs. Verrall's script of August 19th, 1908 (see above,\npp. 277, 313),\nLiliastrum Paradise \u2014Liiiago\u2014No, not that.\nLiHes of Eden\u2014Lilith. No. Eve's lilies all in a garden\nfair.\nand a certain sentence in the Mac script of Oct. 7, 1908\n(see above, p. 311), viz.:\nFarewell, said she, farewell, and once more sad farewell.\nThis same Mac script begins with the words \" Dig a grave\namong the laurels,\" followed by a drawing of a wreath, while\nMrs. Holland on Dec. 2 3 has \" Fresh wreaths and garlands\nnew.\" I take this phrase to be a variant or misquotation of\nthe line correctly quoted immediately afterwards :\n\" Fresh woods\n\f324 Alice Johnson. [part\nand pastures new \" : if so, it affords yet another instance of the\nspecial part played in cross-correspondences by the apparently\ndeliberate use of misquotations.^\nFinally, some further references to the subject of Sesame\nand Lilies are to be found in Mrs. Holland's script of\nDecember 30th, 1908, as follows:\nCon\u2014Context is lacking\u2014Nob constant remembrance\u2014Con\u2014\"Art\nthou poor yet has thou golden slumbers\u2014oh sweet content\u2014To\nadd to golden numbers golden numbers\nThe Pleiades\u2014Stars in her hair were 7\u2014No the Muses on Helicon\n\u2014Coniston\nF. W. H. M.\nI think the confusion at the beginning here represents an\nattempt to get the two words, \" content \" and \" Coniston,\"\nwhich emerge later.\nThe next part of the script is a fragmentary quotation from\na poem in Thomas Dekker's Patient Grissell, Act. I., Scene i.\nThe whole verse is as follows\nArt thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers ?\n0 sweet content\nArt thou rich, yet is thy mind perplexed?\n0 punishment\nDost thou laugh to see how fools are vex'd\nTo add to golden numbers, golden numbers ?\nBesides the threefold repetition here of the word \" golden,\"\none of the leading words of the cross-correspondence, the whole\nspirit of the verse re-echoes the sentiment of Sesame.\n\" Stars in her hair were 7 \" is a fragmentary quotation from\nEossetti's Blessed Damozel, the first two verses of which are\nas follows :\nThe blessed Damozel leaned out\nFrom the gold bar of Heaven\nHer eyes were deeper than the depth\nOf waters stilled at even ;\nShe had three lilies in her hand,\nAnd the stars in her hair were seven.\n1 Mis. Verrall has explained above (see pp. 286-7, and '292, foot-note) the\nconnection between \"Laurel wreath\" and Semme, and Lilies.\n\fLX.] Sequel to the \" Sesame and Lilies \" Incident. 325\nHer robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,\nNo wrought flowers did adorn,\nBut a white rose of Mary's gift.\nFor service meetly woru ;\nHer hair that lay along her back\nWas yellow like ripe corn.\nThe script then explicitly menfcious \" Stars,\"\u2014a word which\nhad occurred in Miss Verrall's script of August 19, 1908,\u2014\nand gives \" Lilies \" implicitly, for they occur in the line\nprevious to the one it quotes. \" Gold \" is also mentioned in\nthe second line of the poem ; and in the second verse is found\nthe word \" Eose,\" which is prominent in the leading Mac\nscript, that of July 27, 1908, having previously appeared in\ntheir script of July 26, and as \"Sharon's dewy rose\" in that of\nJuly 19, 1908; while with the phrase, ''yellow like ripe corn,\"\nwe may compare Mrs. Verrall's script of August 1 1, 1908:\nAugust's ripened sheaves under the moon\u2014reapers in the field.\nShe stood breast high amid the golden corn,\nand Miss Verrall's of September 23, 1908:\nThe sowing of the grain . . . the star flower and lilies too\nlook back\u2014the open door,\nwhich gives the double sense of Sesame, as a grain, and as\na magic word which opens doors ; whereas Mrs. Holland's\nscript can only be said to contain the first sense of the word,\ngrain, and that only implicitly.\n\" The Muses on Helico\/i.\u2014Coniston \" seems an attempt to\npass from the general habitat of the Muses to one particular\nhaunt of theirs with a somewhat similar name ; the intention\nbeing shown by the underlining of the syllable con in Helicon.\nThe literary associations of Coniston are, of course, above all\nwith Euskin, who lived there for the last twenty-nine years of\nhis life and died and was buried there. This phrase, then,\nwhich is the only allusion made by any of the automatists\nto the author of Sesame and Lilies, serves to complete the cross-\ncorrespondence.\nMrs. Holland's whole script of Dec. 30, 1908,^ is signed\n^ The portions of the script omitted from the extract given above contain\ntwo cross-correspondences with Mrs. Piper.\n\f326 Alice Johnson. [part\n\" F. W. H. M.\" Mr. Myers, who was a great admirer and also\na personal friend of Euskin's, had written an obituary notice\nof him which was printed in the Journal S.P.E. At the\nbeginning of this he speaks of Euskiu as a \" man dear to\ntlie Muses,\" and at the end writes\nI have pictured him waiting in the Coniston woodlands, as Oedipus\nin Colonus' Grove,\u2014waiting in mournful memory, in uncomplaining\ncalm, \u2014till he should hear at last the august summons ... of the\nunguessed accompanying God, \"Come, Q^dipus, why linger on our\njourney'? Thou hast kept me waiting long.\"\nIn so far as the individual items of this script go, there is,\nas in most cases, nothing that could not have been supplied by\nMrs. Holland's own mind. She knew the two poems quoted\nfrom ; she must have been perfectly familiar with the fact that\nEuskin lived at Coniston ; she may even have seen Mr. Myers's\nobituary notice of him, since this was reprinted in Fragments\nof Prose and Poetry, which she had once spent a few minutes\nin glancing over. But the intelligence shown in selecting\nfrom the stores of her mind elements appropriate to the\ncross-correspondence and fitting them together to confirm and\nsupplement what had been given by the other automatists,\nthis intelligence must clearly be attributed to some source\nexternal to her.\n\fLX.] Postscript to the Lethe Incident.\nPOSTSCEIPT TO THE LETHE INCIDENT:\nNote on \" Olympus \".\nBy J.

PiDDIKGTON.\n{Althovugh the reader is referred to this Note from j). 98,\nabove, he will not find it intelligible until he has finished the\nwhole account of the Lethe case.)\nSir Oliver Lodge points out that \" Olympus \" may refer to\nthe word Olympo in Metamorphoses, XT. 571 ; and this inter-\npretation I accept. The context of this line is concerned with\nthe drowning of Ceyx, which is thus described :\nCeyx himself . . . lays hold of some wreckage, and calls upon his\nwife's father \\i.e. Aeolus] and upon his own [i.e. Lucifer], though\nalas ! in vain. But the name most often on his lips is his wife\nAlcyone's. Of her he thinks, her face across his fancy comes\nbefore her eyes he prays the waves may cast him, and that by\nher loving hands his lifeless corpse may be entombed. While his\nstrength holds out, he speaks her name, as often as the waves\nallow of utterance, or breathes it under the water with shut lips.\nLo ! towering high aloft, a black arch of waters bursts, and engulphs\nhim in its riven flood. Dark was Lucifer that night; and, since\nhe might not quit Olympus, he had veiled his face in thick\nclouds.\nThe daughter of Aeolus \\i.c. Alcyone], meanwhile, in ignorance\nof these cruel adversities, . . . was devoutly offering incense to\nall the gods of heaven. Yet chiefliest did she frequent Juno's\nsanctuaries . . .\nThe fact that Aeolus is the subject of direct reference a\nfew lines before, and of indirect reference a few lines after,\nthe occurrence of the word Olympo accords well with the\nconjecture, advanced on p. 102, that the trance-personality\nwas helped to a recollection of the story of Ceyx and Alcyone\nby an association of ideas with another classical story in\nwhich Aeolus plays a part.\n\f328 G. Piddingion. [part lx.\nIn this connexion it is worth noting also that the first\nmention of \" Olympus \" in the trance was made immediately\nafter Mr. Dorr had spoken of the Styx (see p. 87), for Ovid\n{Met. XT. 500) describes the stormy sea in which Ceyx's ship\nfoundered as \" blacker than the Stygian wave \".\nIf \"Olympus\" was an allusion to Met. XT. 571, it may\nserve to explain why MyerSp on March 30, 1908 (see p. 96)\nsaid that he had \" previously answered \" Mr. Dorr's request\nfor an explanation of \" Olympus \". In the waking-stage of\nthe previous sitting (see p. 94) the letters of the name Ceyx\nhad been all but correctly pronounced, and MyerSp may have\nthought that leading words like \" Olympus \" and \" Ceyx\nought together to furnish a sufficiently easy clue to his\nmeaning.\nNeither in Bulfinch's nor in Gayley's version of the Ceyx and\nAlcyone story does the word Olympus occur. Bulfinch's para-\nphrase of Md. XI. 570-572 is: \"The Day-star looked dim\nthat night. Since it could not leave the heavens, it shrouded\nits face in clouds.\" Gayley omits the lines altogether. This\nenforces\u2014I might almost say, proves\u2014my contention that the\nknowledge of the story shown in the trance was not derived\nfrom either Bulfinch's or Gayley 's book.\nThe reason why I failed to detect any meaning in \" Olympus\n\"\nis that my own text of Ovid (Merkel's) reads caelo in place\nof Olympo. Mrs. Verrall has kindly looked up the textual\nhistory of Met. XI. 571 for me, and from her investigation\nthe following appear to be the facts\nBoth readings, ceiclo and Olyvvpo, are to be found in the MSS.\nHeinsius, whose edition of Ovid was published in 1652, adopted\nthe reading Ohpwpo ; and this reading seems thenceforward to\nhave been regularly followed {e.g. in the Delphin edition, in\nLemaire's, in Baumgarten-Crusius', and in the old Corpus Poet.\nLat.) till Loers in 1843 adopted caelo, the reading of the older\nMSS. Subsequent editors have followed Loers {e.rj. Merkel,\nand Postgate in the new Corpus Poet. Led.). It may be asserted\nwith considerable confidence that the editions of Ovid in\ncommon use about the time (1853-1859) when Frederic\nMyers has described himself as living \" much in the inward\nrecital of . . . Ovid \", would have contained the reading\nOlym-po.\n\f\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nPART LXI.\nAugust, 1910.\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETING.\nThe 136th General Meeting of the Society was held at the\nMorley Hall, George Street, Hanover Square, London, W., on\nThursday, May 5th, 1910, at -1.15 p.m.; the President, Mr.\nH. Akthur Smith, in the chair.\nThe President delivered the Address which is printed below.\nY\n\f330 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nPEESIDENTIAL ADDEESS.\nDelivered on May 5th, 1910.\nBy H, Akthur Smith.\nWhen, just ten years ago, Frederic Myers was elected to the\nChair of our Society, he prefaced his remarkable presidential\naddress with these words :\n\u2014\" When 1 heard that the Council of\nthis Society had done me the honour of electing me as its\nPresident for the current year, I felt that a certain definite stage\nin the Society's evolution had been reached at an earlier date than\nI should originally have expected. My predecessors in this chair\nhave without exception been men of the highest distinction. The\nlist has included men whose leadership would confer honour on\nany body of men whatever ; on such bodies, for instance, as the\nBritish Association or the House of Commons. We have been\ngrateful to these eminent persons for lending the sanction of their\nnames to our early beginnings. And we have other names of\nsimilar distinction ;\n\u2014destined, I hope, some day to adorn our list\nof Presidents. Yet for the current year the Council have preferred\nto choose a man who has little claim to such a distinction, beyond\nthe fact that he has worked for the objects which our Society\nseeks, from days even before the Society's formation, and that he\nis determined to go on thus working so long as his faculties may\nallow. . . . The time has come when we may fairly indicate to\nthe world that we believe our Society can stand on its own\nbottom . . . and that therefore we do not need to put forward in\nits prominent positions only those names which have been made\nindependently illustrious by good work of other kinds performed\nelsewhere.\"\nIf such a man as Frederic Myers thought it necessary to intro-\nduce himself to this office in such modest and apologetic fashion,\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 331\nhow much more is it incumbent on myself to justify the taking of\na place in such a succession of names, at the invitation of your\nCouncil ! Myers's hope as to his successors has up to the present\nbeen fulfilled. Our Society has been served by a succession of\npersons distinguished in many ways, in science, in philosophy, in\neducation. If it has now called to its chief office one whose only\nclaim to such a position is his intense and life-long interest in the\nwork before us, it must argue a great confidence in the present\nstrength and stability of the Society.\nThere is abundant evidence before us that our Society is now\nstrong and stable; and I am sure I shall provoke no jealousy\nif I say that its strength is due to Frederic Myers himself more\nthan to any one else. In 1882 we began with a small company\nindeed, and for some years were not infrequently the butt of\ngibes and sneers. At present, we have no fewer than 1284\nnames on our books ; and these, comprising representatives of\nmany creeds, are to be found scattered over the whole earth\nliterally from China to Peru. Happily, moreover, there seems\nto be no decline in the public interest which our investigations\nattract. The supply of new candidates continues steady, or\nrather tends to increase in volume.\nIt may well, then, be asked, indeed I am often asked by\npersons not conversant with our work, what our Society has\ndone, or what it is doing to explain or justify this extended\ninterest and support. To answer this question completely would,\nof course, involve the writing of the Society's history through\neight and twenty years. To attempt such an undertaking within\nthe limits of time and space which I must impose on myself\nwould be absurd. And it is the less necessary, since I am\naddressing myself mainly not to the uninformed but to those\nwho have already convinced themselves that there is a sufficient\nraison cVStre for our existence. At the same time, in view of\nthe continual accretion to our numbers of new enquirers, who\ncan scarcely be expected to follow all the steps of the past, I\nhave often been impressed with the desirability of presenting\nfrom time to time something in the form of a resume of what\nhas been accomplished, what attempted and as we hope in\nprocess of accomplishment. I think, then, it is reasonable and\nmay serve a useful purpose to adduce a brief summing up of\nthe results of our labours from this point of view.\n\f332 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nThe original programme of the Society comprised six\nsubjects as appropriate for its investigation :\n(1) An examination of the nature and extent of any influence\nwhich may be exerted by one mind upon another, apart from\nany generally recognised mode of perception.\n(2) The study of hypnotism and the forms of so-called\nmesmeric trance, with its alleged insensibility to pain; clairvoy-\nance and other allied phenomena.\n(3) A critical revision of Eeichenbach's researches with certain\norganisations called \" sensitive,\" and an enquiry whether such\norganisations possess any power of perception beyond a highly\nexalted sensibility of the recognised sensory organs.\n(4) A careful investigation of any reports, resting on strong\ntestimony, regarding apparitions at the moment of death or\notherwise, or regarding disturbances in houses reputed to be\nhaunted.\n(5) An enquiry into the various physical phenomena commonly\ncalled Spiritualistic, with an attempt to discover their causes\nand general laws.\n(6) The collection and collation of existing materials bearing\non the history of these subjects.\nThis enumeration of our original objects of research is, of\ncourse, familiar to many, especially of our older members, but\nI refer to it, partly by way of introduction to the brief review\nof our progress which I propose to present, and partly because\nit seems to me to need repetition from time to time in order\nto correct misconceptions which one often meets with as to our\nscientific position.\nEepeatedly have I been asked by outsiders, half in jest and\nhalf in earnest, what our Society has discovered, or even what\nit believes on this or that occult matter. Some seem to suppose\nthat the Society is possessed of a kind of corporate intelligence,\nor that we are wont at our meetings to recite something like\na creed which we regard as psychically orthodox. Even\nstranger misconceptions than these may be met with in some\nquarters. Some seem to think that candidates for admission\nare required to go through something like a Masonic initiation\nor Eosicrucian ordeal, or to face the \"Dweller on the Threshold,\"\nas described in Lytton's Zanoni. Now, in fact, it is obvious\nenough that if we were to confine our expositions to such\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 333\nmatters as all of us believe, our curriculum would be extremely\nlimited; and if on the other hand we were to pronounce dog-\nmatically on things which some among us believe, we should\npretty certainly soon be worried by many dissenters from our\necclesiasticism.\nBut to return to our programme. The inter-relation of the\nvarious subjects mentioned is plain enough. That they have not\nall received equal attention is also plain, and the reasons for this\nare not far to seek. In some cases, notably in that of hypnotism\nand hypnotic ansesthesia, the subjects have been widely taken up\nand investigated outside our Society. In the earlier days of our\nexistence we by no means neglected this investigation, as our\nProceedings clearly show. But now that the more familiar\nphenomena of hypnotism at any rate, have tardily forced their\nway into scientific recognition\u2014and the steps leading to this\nrecognition are amongst the most instructive and curious in the\nhistory of science \u2014now that these effects of hypnotism are daily\nbeing applied to practical purposes in various parts of the world,\nit seems scarcely incumbent upon us to devote our scanty\nresources of time and treasure to the further proof or illustration\nof what may be taken to be already established.\nThe lieichenbach researches, again, have not been neglected.\nExperiments were made to test the truth of the allegations\nthat to certain sensitives a luminosity was visible around the\npoles of powerful magnets. But, so far as my recollection\nserves, these experiments produced few if any satisfactory\nresults.-^ Moreover the interest in them was, I think, of too\nacademic a character to affect any considerable number of our\nsupporters ; and this, of course, had to be taken into consideration\nin the application of the energies at our command. But a\nsubject of enquiry which was not specifically mentioned in our\nprogramme but which is of a nature somewhat analogous to\nthat just now mentioned, inasmuch as it involves the study\nof a special sensitivity, more or less widely, but not univer-\nsally possessed, has attracted minute attention, which has\nproduced most interesting and important results. I refer to\nthe phenomena of the dowsing rod. The Society, and indeed\nthe world of science generally, is indebted to Professor Barrett\n^ I have been informed by Professor Barrett that of recent years the\nReichenbach experiments have been renewed with success.\n\f334 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nfor an exhaustive examination of this strange faculty, the\noperative cause of which must still, I suppose, be deemed to\nremain in the region of hypothesis. The dowsing rod has\nindeed for ages, some would say from the time of Moses, been\nempirically used and applied in the search for water and\nmineral lodes for commercial and other purposes. Fortunes\nhave been made by the exercise of the faculty. But never\nbefore has any one devoted so much time and careful study\nto this subject as has Professor Barrett during the past five\nand twenty years. As a result we have in our Proceeclmgs\nan exposition of the art, a discussion of the theory, and a\ncollection of the ancient and modern bibliography of the\ndowsing rod, such as had not before been presented to the\nworld.\nThese are, however, but by-products, so to speak, which\nhave appeared in the course of our quest. Beyond all doubt\nthe subject which above all others has attracted and engrossed\nthe attention of the great majority of our supporters is to be\nfound in our investigation of the evidence for the continuance\nof life after death\u2014\" The Survival of Man.\" In one depart-\nment of this enquiry, specifically mentioned in the programme,\nthe results obtained have not been great, namely the exami-\nnation of houses reputed to be haunted. Stories of ghostly\ndisturbances have reached us from time to time ; and thanks\nlargely to Mr. Baggally's and Colonel Taylor's readiness to\nplace their time at our disposal, some of these have been\ntested ; but on the whole, I think I must say, with meagre\nand unconvincing results. We have found little, if any,\ntrustworthy evidence in favour of what I may call the \"ghost\nstory of commerce,\" the periodic ghost, or the ghost which\nappears with a purpose. Our records, indeed, contain a valu-\nable monograph by Mrs. Sidgwick on the \" Phantasms of the\nDead \" ; but apart from this, the cases which have come before\nus have been too sporadic and disconnected to suggest any\nvery definite conclusions.\nThere remains, however, the great subject of all, the demon-\nstration of thought transference among the living, for which\nMyers happily invented the word \"telepathy\"; and the collec-\ntion of voluminous evidence which at least suggests the\noperation of telepathy between the dead and the living. This\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 335\nbranch of our enquiry has produced an extensive literature,\ncharacterised scarcely more by the evidence which it presents\nof tireless research than by the eloquence with which the\nresults have been propounded and discussed. It has given to\nthe world such works as Phantasms of the Living, Human\nPersonality, and lastly The Survival of Man. It has influenced\nmany of the pregnant writings of Professor William James of\nHarvard, and it has called forth the numerous and valuable\ncritical essays of Mr. Podmore on the whole subject\u2014a litera-\nture which has profoundly influenced the world of thought on\nmatters psychical and psychological, and I venture to thinlv is\ndestined to do so for many years to come. Moreover a great\nmass of literature has sprung up and is almost daily being\nadded to, outside the ranks of our Society, but almost wholly\nbased on its reports. Some of these works are valuable, many\nof them much the reverse, but they all tend to show how\ndeep an impression has been made by our work.\n\" Telepathy,\" as I have indicated, was a word unknown in our\nlanguage until about five and twenty years ago. Now it is\nscarcely an exaggeration to say that it is as familiar in common\nspeech as \" telegram \" and \" photograph.\" Telepathy has been\ndefined by Sir Oliver Lodge as \" the apparently direct action of\none mind on another by means unknown to science.\" This Sir\nOliver regards as having been experimentally proved, at any rate\nto this extent, that \" a hazy and difficult recognition is possible by\none person of objects kept as vividly as possible in the conscious-\nness of another person,\" and in this conviction, if in nothing else,\nI think all who have followed our Society's work are agreed. I\nsuppose that the admission of this operation of mind on mind is\nnot yet reckoned orthodox in the world of science, or deemed to be\na proved vera causa ; but it is obvious that in the world at large\nits recognition is very widespread and is increasing day by day.\nNow I contend that if by means of these many years of strenuous\nwork our Society had obtained no other result than this, this\nalone would suffice to justify its formation and labour. It\nestablishes the existence of a factor in the powers of the\nhuman mind which may before have been suspected, but never\nbefore came within measurable distance of pi'oof ; and he would\nbe a bold man who would venture to predict what results may\naccrue from it in the generations to come. One illustration\n\f336 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nof its pretty general acceptance may be given, which is not\nwithout its humorous side. Our Society through its various\nworkers has taught the world all it knows or thinks it knows\nabout telepathy, as well as giving it the word. And now\nwhat do we see ? When our researches carry us into deeper\nregions, and bring to light occurrences which are calculated to\nproduce more exciting effects on the minds of the observers,\nsuch, for example, as the phenomena associated with the names .\nof Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Verrall and others, especially the cross-\ncorrespondences,\u2014our critics lay hold of our own discovery\nand use it to cast ridicule or pour scorn upon the conclusions\nwe are endeavouring to formulate from these more recondite\noccurrences. They make a hurried examination of a most\ncomplicated series of facts and then confidently assure the\nworld that there is nothing in them but \" telepathy.\" They\nbeat us, or try to do so, with the stick which we have made\nfor them. Having jeered at telepathy as long as they dared,\nnow that it is established in a simple form, they accuse us of\ncredulity for not assuming its sufficiency to account for many\ncomplicated phenomena for which its aptitude is by no means\nproved, and to which its application seems more than doubtful.\nWe are not in such a hurry. We have not been deterred by\nscoffs in the past and we shall not now be hurried to unwar-\nranted conclusions by impatience. Our motto has been, and I\nhope will always be, \" Festina Icntc.\"\nTaking telepathy, then, in its simplest form to be proved, we\nhave under watchful examination the possibility of much more\ncomplicated manifestations of the same faculty. That there are\nsuch in operation the phantasms of the living and still more\nimpressively those of the dying seem strongly to suggest. But\nI prefer to leave the analytical examination of this question to\nexperts in science and philosophy, among whom it would be an\nimpertinence for me to claim a place. Many will remember\nthe ingenious illustrations presented to us of the possibilities\nof telergy, teltesthesia, telekinesis, genius, inspiration, etc., in the\ndiagrams expounded by Sir Oliver Lodge at one of our meetings\nin 1908, an exposition which personally I hope to see\nreported in a much completer form than was possible in the\nlimited space of our Journal. Nor shall I go at any length\ninto a consideration of the Piper phenomena which of late\n\ftxi.] Presidential Address. 337\nyears have figured so largely iii our investigations. I have,\nhowever, been asked to make some reference to the evidence\nfor the identity of the controls from a lawyer's point of view.\nTo this I will return in a few moments, but first I should\nlike to make some general observations bearing on the same\nsubject.\nOne of the commonest objections urged against the genuine-\nness of communications claiming to come from the dead, is\nbased on the triviality, or in other cases the want of consis-\ntency in the messages delivered. True, some of the communi-\ncations seem trivial, but it is a gross exaggeration to assert,\nas some have asserted, that all are so. This objection, again, is\nlikely to be more striking to a reader of the reports than to\na first-hand witness. No doubt it gives one something of a\nshock to find in a message purporting to come from Myers\nsolecisms of grammar ; and such may be met with. But apart\nfrom the fact that, though a few people here and there write\ngood grammar, no human being speaks it in general conversa-\ntion, how little as yet do we know of the nature of the\ndifficulties obstructing these communications, if communications\nthere be, or of the extent to which the communications are\ninfluenced by the personality of the mediums with their various\nlimitations ! That there are difficulties and limitations the\nscripts continually assert. Some one has compared them to\nthe difficulty of talking through an imperfect telephone, and\neverybody who has tried that will agree that the exasperating\nhindrances met with are more conducive to forcibleness of\nexpression than to elegance of style. Mrs. Piper's brain, nerves,\nand muscles may perhaps be the best telephone in the world\nfor the purpose in hand, but may be very far nevertheless from\nbeing a perfect instrument. And then again, how little, if any-\nthing, we have learned as yet of the conditions on the other\nside ! I think Dr. Schiller suggested in an article which\nappeared in our Proceedings some years ago that a life newly\nbegotten into the discarnate state may have to go through a\nperiod analogous to infancy in this life, needing again to learn\nthe use of such faculties as it finds itself possessed of\n\u2014\" an\ninfant crying in the night \" and sometimes \" with no language\nbut a cry.\" Or on the other hand, though this would seem\nscarcely in the same accordance with the processes of nature\n\f338 H, ArtJmr Smith. [part\nas we know them, the discaruate spirit may suddenly find\nitself endowed with senses, faculties and powers entirely\nunknown to us, and so may have to cramp itself (if I may use\nan Americanism) to communicate with us at all. If some of\nthe lower forms of life here are possessed of only one sense,\nsome higher forms of two or three senses, and man of five or\nsix, why may not the liberated spirit enjoy a dozen, or a\nhundred for the matter of that ? For we must assume, if we\nare to consider the question at all, that the exercise of senses\ndoes not continue to depend on the possession of physical\norgans of sense as we know them. How should we succeed\nif we tried (reverting to our comparison) to describe through\na buzzing telephone the beauty of the rainbow to a man blind\nfrom his birth ? These intelligences, if such there be, may,\nagain, be as conversant with the fourth, fifth, or higher dimen-\nsions of matter, as we are with the first, second and third.\nYet once more, it may well be that the attempt to communi-\ncate with us, if such attempt there be, involves a heroic\nact of self-denial or sacrifice on the part of those making\nthe attempt. Some passages in the scripts more than hint\nthat this is the case. In short, until the whole study has\nprogressed much further than it yet has, we must remain\nhopelessly incompetent to estimate the value, or quite as pro-\nbably the valuelessness, of such criticism as I have referred\nto. But surely with such facts as we have before us, this is\nno sufficient reason for discrediting, still less for abandoning\nthe study.\nAnd now let us briefiy consider the evidence for identity\nfrom a lawyer's point of view, which subject has been suggested\nto me. My first comment must be that it is by no means\nclear that a lawyer's is the most important point of view in\na case like that before us. The lawyer is conversant with\ncertain canons which in the aggregate are known as the law\nof evidence, the exposition of which by some writers occupies\na thousand pages or so. These canons are no doubt based on\nthe principles of inductive logic, but in the application of those\nprinciples they are cribbed and confined on all sides by the\nexigencies of forensic practice. It is far from being certain\nthat the dialectic methods of the forum are the methods best\nadapted for the investigation of questions not subject to similar\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 339\nrestrictions, but carried on under entirely different conditions.\nAnd here let me call attention to the important ambiguity\nwhich lies in the word \"evidence.\" Probably half the contro-\nversies which rage in the regions of theology, politics and\nphilosophy turn on the fallacious use of what logicians call the\nambiguous middle ; and possibly one reason why we have in\nBritain the reputation for being excessively addicted to con-\ntroversy may be found in the fact that our language is peculiarly\nand unfortunately rich in words which are more than ambiguous.\nThe word \" church,\" for instance, has eight or ten distinct\nmeanings. What wonder then that ecclesiastics wrangle when\nthey come to talk about it ? If half-a-dozen politicians meet\nto discuss \" socialism,\" it is quite likely that no two of them will\nattach the same meaning to the word. What wonder then if\nthey lose their tempers ? So of the word \" evidence.\" As Sir\nJames Fitzjames Stephen points out in the introduction to his\nDigest of the Law of Evidence, and expounds still more fully\nin his Introduction to the Indian Evidence Act, the word some-\ntimes means relevancy, sometimes testimony, and sometimes\nproof. It might seem plausible to argue that if there is evidence\nproduced as to an alleged fact, the truth of the fact is thereby\nmade evident. The fallacy is obvious enough v\/hen tested, but\nit is nevertheless operative in the minds of loose thinkers, and\nnowhere more frequently than in careless dabblers in psychical\nresearch. One brief illustration will suffice. The notorious\nPigott gave testimony, and perfectly relevant testimony, as to\nthe authorship of the Parnell letters. But half-a-dozen questions\nof cross-examination showed how very far this relevant testimony\nfell short of proof He gave evidence indeed, but made nothing\nevident save that he was an arrant liar. The same point is\nenlarged upon in what I have always regarded as a locus classicus\nfor the expression of a sane view of some of the problems\nbefore us ; I refer to De Morgan's Preface to his wife's work\nentitled From Matter to Spirit. It appeared anonymously some\nfive and forty years ago, since which time of course a great\ndeal of water has passed under the bridge ; but its authorship\nis now an open secret, and its wit and wisdom are worthy of\nthe writer of the celebrated Paradoxes. I believe the work\nhas long been out of print and is difficult to obtain, so that\na quotation at some length is the more justifiable.\n\f340 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nDe Morgan writes\nOne of the greatest pursuits of the world is the study of evidence\nwe are all engaged upon it in one way or another. But as generally\nhappens, when a word goes much about, it picks up more than one\nmeaning in its travels. Accordingly, evidence passes for that which\nis given and intended to produce an effect, and also for that\nwhich does produce it there is the quod debet monstrari, that which\nmay properly be tendered in aid of a conclusion, and the quod facit\nvidere, that which gives perception of truth or falsehood. The difference\nand the fallacies of confusion arising therefrom are strikingly illus-\ntrated in courts of law. \"While the case is preparing for trial it is\nthe lawyer's business to collect what he then calls the evidence, the\nmatter which is to be offered to the jury. It is his duty to see\nthat the evidence is quod debet monstrari, not onlj' addressed to the\npoints raised by the pleadings, but in conformity to certain rational\nru.les which are laid down.\nAnd here I may interject, though it may be giving away\none of the rather illicit devices of the profession, that counsel\nadvising on evidence in this sense will sometimes manaste to\nintroduce matter tending to prejudice the jury in his favour,\nalthough he knows it not to be in strictness admissible. De\nMorgan continues :\nThus it comes before the jury, who are sworn to give a true\nverdict according to the \"evidence,\" which now means the quod facit\nvidere. So far good ; the law must decide what is and what is not\nfit to be offered as material for evidence. But it may happen that\nmatter slips in which the Court would have prevented if it could\n(i.e. matter which I have called matter of prejudice), but could not,\nor at least did not, prevent. And now comes one of those coUisions\nin which the jury mind rules contrary to the legal mind. If the\nghost of a murdered man were to make his appearance in court in\na form which no one could possibly attribute to imposture, optics or\nchemistry, and were solemnly to declare that the prisoner was not\nthe murderer and then to vanish through the roof, the judge would,\nno doubt, instruct the jury that they must dismiss the respectable\napparition from their minds altogether ; that even if the spirit had\noffered to be sworn and to stand cross-examination, there would be\nvery grave doubt whether his evidence could have been received,\nfrom his probable want of belief in a future state; but that, as\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 341\nmatters stood, it was clearly their duty to take the vision pro non\nviso. To which the jury would reply, if they believed the ghost,\nby a verdict of 7i^3t guilty. No honest men would ever make believe\nthat they do not believe what they have in any way been made to\nbelieve, if they clearly understand what they are doing.\nSo far De Morgan ; but as to his last sentence I think that\nexperience of the courts will recall many cases in which juries\nhave yielded to judicial direction, and been induced to give\nverdicts conformable to legal rules of evidence, in spite of con-\nviction forced upon them by matter which I have described as\nmatter of prejudice.\niSTow let us try to apply this to the case before us, to the\nevidence tendered to prove the identity of controls, or spirits\nspeaking or writing through mediums. Here I perhaps may\ninterject the remark that, when I was asked to deal with this\nquestion, it was suggested to me that I might find some help\nby consulting and refreshing my memory with the report of the\nfamous Tichborne case of five and thirty years ago. Well, I\nhappen to have in my Chambers a full report of one of the\ntwo enormous trials which arose out of that imposture. But\nwhen I tell you that the report of this one trial, and that not\nthe more important, occupies five quarto volumes, each of which\ncontains nearly a thousand closely printed double column pages,\nI think you will e.xcuse me if even my enthusiasm for Psychical\nEesearch has not sufficed to induce me to attempt the task of\nnavigating such an ocean. I must content myself with some less\nonerous method.\nIt is clear in the case before us,\u2014the proof of the identity\nof our instructors who claim to speak from behind the veil,\n\u2014that though there is much evidence ciuod debet monstrari,\nthat is, what lawyers call evidence to go to the jury, there\nis absolutely nothing that can be called evidence quod facit\nvidcre (Professor James has somewhere called it \" knock-down\nevidence\") from a lawyer's point of view; nor can I conceive\nthat there is ever likely to be. Apart from the disqualifica-\ntions of the supposititious spectre which De Morgan humor-\nously introduced, our enquirers are hampered and restricted\non every side by the want of powers which are every moment\navailable to a judge trying an issue. If a witness speaks\nindistinctly he can be required to \" speak up,\" and if he\n\f342 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nrefuses, he may be committed for contempt. If he declines to\ngive a direct answer to a direct question, he subjects himself\nto the same penalty. He can be cross-examined in detail with\nthe peril of a prosecution for perjury before his eyes. But\nnotwithstanding the disabilities under which our enquirers\nlabour, it by no means follows that we (who constitute the\njury) may not be brought reasonably to believe the evidence,\ninformal though it be, presented to us, just as De Morgan\nsupposes the jury to believe the ghost.\nDirect \" knock-down \" evidence is then wanting and pro-\nbably always will be wanting. But circumstantial evidence of\na kind abounds ; and in courts of law experience has shown\nthat in many respects the evidence called circumstantial is\nmore trustworthy, safer to rely on than direct testimony. For\ninstance : the question for a jury to determine is the identity\nof A., who is alleged to have shot B. A witness, C, may\ncome forward and swear that in l)road day-light he saw A.\nfire the fatal shot. In a sense this seems the most cogent\nproof possible ; but in fact it is not so. C. may have an\ninterest in getting rid of A., and may be willing to perjure\nhimself to accomplish his object. This, of course, is analogous\nto the hypothesis of deliberate fraud as applied to our experi-\nments. Again : C. may have very defective vision and may be\nhonestly mistaken in swearing to the identification. This\nwould correspond to mal-observation in our experiments. But\nif on the other hand it is by independent witnesses proved\nthat shortly before the murder A. purchased a revolver, that\nthe bullet found in the body exactly resembled others found\nin A.'s possession, that foot-prints of a peculiar character were\ndiscovered leading to and from the spot where the shot was\nfired and were found to correspond to the marks made by\nboots known to have been worn by A. at the time, and so on;\nthough not one of these facts taken alone would be quite\nconvincing, their cumulative force might well be overwhelming\nand might justify a much more confident verdict of \"guilty\"\nthan the mere unsupported testimony of C, however clear.\nAs Professor James has pointed out in his report on the\nHodgson control {Proceedings, Vol. XXIIL), this is precisely the\ncharacter of the evidence before us. It is futile to take it\nitem by item and to proclaim that no one incident in it\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 343\nproves anything. The evidence must be considered as a whole.\nJuncta juvant. As to its convincing effect when so regarded,\nopinions will, of course, differ ; but in determining this ques-\ntion, we may reasonably apply the principles of logic, which\nare broader than the technicalities which restrict the law of\nforensic evidence. All this is indeed somewhat elementary,\nbut some of our critics are not incapable of ignoring what is\nelementary.\nWhen we appeal to logic, our path is still a thorny one.\nWe are very far from being in a position to apply to the case\nin hand the four canons (or indeed any one of them) which\nJohn Stuart Mill lays down as applicable to experimental\nmethods. We can scarcely even act on the Aristotelian advice\nto proceed to the unknown from what is known to us,\nbecause of the fact that so little as yet is really known.\nFor example : we are undertaking to enquire into the causes\nwhich produce the effects of a medium's trance-speech or\nautomatic writing. Before we can reach the conclusion that\nthe cause is the will of a departed human spirit to communi-\ncate with us, we are logically bound to eliminate, not only\nevery known cause, if any there be, but also any suggested\ncause which we ought to regard as more probable. I do not\nthink there can be said to be any cause for these phenomena\nwhich we are entitled to describe as knov:n ; so that the\ndiscussion of probabilities is all that is left to us. And here\nour difficulties thicken around us. In the attempt to esti-\nmate the balance of probabilities we find ourselves without\nthe known quantities which we need to enable us to frame\neven an indeterminate equation. Putting fraudulent conspiracy\nout of view as a cause of the facts we are investigating, there\nwould seem to be at least three possible explanations of these\nfacts to be considered, other than the hypothesis of actual\ncommunications from the dead.\nThe first which I would mention is of a metaphysical\nnature and will not perhaps appeal to many minds. A little\nmore than twenty years ago Sir Edwin Arnold published in the\nFortnightly Review a brief essay entitled \" Death\u2014and after-\nwards,\" in which he eloquently discussed some aspects of the\nquestion before us. This essay was shortly afterwards pub-\nlished separately and has since run through many editions.\n\f344 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nTo it are appended some critical examinations of his thesis,\nwhich appear anonymously, but which are evidently the\nproduction of acute thinkers. From one of these I will quote\na statement of the metaphysical supposition to which I refer.\nThe writer says\nWhen the GaHleo of Time\u2014surely coming\u2014shall have made con-\nceivable, if not actually accessible to us, what answers in the\ntemporal sphere to the antipodes we know as spatial fact ; when we\nhave begun to realise that \" past and future \" are no more absolute\nthan the \"over and under,\" the \"above and below,\" which now we\nknow to be reversible, not only in conception, but in physical\nexperience ; then perhaps we may alter somewhat our estimate of\nthe comparative value of the local temporal sensuous character of a\nfact, and our notion of what constitutes its real significance.\nProfessor Pigou in a recent number of our Proceedings has\nalluded to the same idea in the same connexion. Speaking of\nthe survival of man he says\nThe ambiguity connected with \"survive\" is philosophical. If any\none asks whether cats survive immersion in water, it does not occur\nto us to bring to bear on that problem a metaphysical discussion\nconcerning the reality of time ; we assume, in fact, that time is real,\nand we mean by \"surviving immersion,\" being alive after immersion.\nWhen, however, our cpiestion relates to men and women and bodily\ndeath, the idealist philosopher enters the arena and claims that time\nand all that therein is, is a purely subjective condition of human\nperception ; that in reality there is no after and no before ; that\nsurvival and death alike are appearance ; that men and women, as\nspirit, neither survive nor die, but in some sense eternally are.\nIt was not likely that such a deep philosophic thinker as\nMyers should have overlooked this speculation ; and he has\nnot overlooked it. In more than one passage in Human\nPersonality, and also in his essay on Wordsworth, he discusses,\nbut does not accept, the suggestion. I dwell on it now\nbecause there seem to be cases before us to which it may\nconceivably apply. I am not referring to prophecy or to the\npredictions of the Delphic oracle or to the legends of Mother\nShipton, or to the occasional happy shots of so-called astrolo-\ngers ; but I recall to mind what we know as \" the Marmontel\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 345\nincident \" in Mrs. Verrall's script, and other somewhat analogous\npremonitions ; certain striking predictive crystal visions which\nhave come under my own notice, and also some occurrences\ndescribed in the experiences of Swedenborg. I might refer\nalso to the seeming confusion between past and future which\nsometimes appears in the automatic scripts. See for example\nthe \" Neptune \" and \" Pharaoh's daughter \" references in Pro-\nceedings, Part LX., p. 193. If the conjecture is to be enter-\ntained at all, it would point to the idea that what Aristotle\ncalled the \" categories \" and the schoolmen the \" predicaments\n\"\nhave no relation to things as they are, but amount only to a\nrough formulation of the present conditions of human thought;\nand these not absolute or essential, but subject to extension or\nevolution with the progress of knowledge, so that a conception\nof our relation to space (for example) which may have been\nunthinkable to Aristotle or Aquinas has now become the\ncommon property of every school-boy ; and possibly the con-\nception of our relation to time may be destined to a similar\nchange. I am not, however, as confident as the writer above\nquoted that the Galileo of time is \" surely coming.\"\nA second conceivable explanation of the phenomena before\nus is of a quasi-theological nature. The sacred writings of many\nreligions, and the folk-lore of many nations are full of\nassertions of the existence of beings intelligent and potent, in\na sense intermediate between this world, and what we some-\ntimes call the other world or world to come. Some are repre-\nsented as benevolent, others as malevolent to man, others again\nas scarcely the one or the other, but capricious, tricksy sprites\naddicted to practical jokes and petty mischief Cardinal Xewman\nseems to have accepted the existence of such a race of beings;\nin his Apologia he writes :\n\u2014\" Also besides the hosts of evil\nspirits I considered there was a middle race, 8uLfx6vLa, neither\nin heaven nor in hell, partially fallen, capricious, wayward,\nnoble or crafty, benevolent or malicious as the case might be.\"\nTo such beings he ascribed potent influence in matters of\nchurch and state. A similar view appears in Father Hugh\nBenson's recent work The Necromancers. I do not propose to\ndiscuss such vague circumstantial evidence as may be deemed\nto exist in favour of the existence and operation of these Sai\/moi'ia,\nelementals, or whatever they may be called. This, however,\nz\n\f346 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nmay be said with reference to them, that if such beings exist\naround us, their operations may have a bearing not only on\nthe investigation of trance-speech and vv^riting, but also on the\noccurrences known amongst us as physical phenomena, and of\nthe pranks so often recorded, so seldom well authenticated,\nascribed to poltergeists. For myself, if I see no very cogent\na priori reason for discrediting the hypothesis of such powers\nin our environment, I see little that is calculated to carry\nconviction on the affirmative side. But this may be added : if the\nphenomena of trance and other mediumistic communications can\nconceivably be ascribed to such a cause as this, we may well despair\nof attaining any evidence conclusive of the identity of discarnate\nhuman beings purporting to communicate with us. Ignorant as\nwe are of the powers and means of information at the disposal\nof such SaifjLovia, if such there be, it is rather hopeless to expect\nto find any personation agent to put in our polling booths, com-\npetent to detect the deceptions which may be practised.\nThe third alternative to the reality of messages from discar-\nnate human beings lies in the possibilities of telepathy among\nthe living. As already said, simple telepathy so far as experi-\nmentally proved is not sufficient, is, indeed, far from sufficient\nto account for the occurrences which we seek to explain. But\nthe possibilities of this faculty are at this moment under care-\nful observation, as you all know. The records of our experi-\nments are voluminous ;\nthey are being added to and placed\nbefore you year by year, and it would serve little purpose now for\nme to speculate as to the ultimate results of an enquiry which\nis in hands much more competent than mine. To these three\npossible explanations other philosophic speculations might of\ncourse be added ; such for example as the existence of what\nhas been called a Cosmic reservoir of memories to which the\nsubliminal consciousness has access. But our limits prohibit the\ndiscussion of such hypotheses.\nAnd now we come back to the primary question: Consider-\ning the facts before us, and weighing as best we can the\nprobability of the alternative explanations which I have tried\nbriefly to suggest, are we entitled to say that Myers \" being\ndead yet speaketh ?\n\" Personally, I am not convinced. But\nthen I am in the disadvantageous position analogous to that\nof a person who tries to form an opinion on a complicated\n\fLXI.] Presidentml Address. 347\nissue at law from merely reading the evidence, without having\nhad the opportunity of seeing or hearing the witnesses in court.\nAnd one cannot but be impressed by the fact that many who\nhave assisted in the experiments have been convinced. More-\nover, when I wrote this last sentence, I had not read the\nlatest number of our Proceedings (Part LX.) which, I think,\ncarries us many steps forward.\nBefore I conclude I will venture to call attention to two\nmatters which seem to me worthy of earnest consideration, and\nto point in the direction of an affirmative conclusion. First,\nit is a strange thing, as was pointed out by De Morgan long\nago, that \" in spite of the inconsistencies, the eccentricities,\nand the puerilities which some of them (the supposed communi-\ncating spirits) have exhibited, there is a uniform vein of\ndescription running through their accounts, which, supposing it\nto be laid down by a combination of impostors, is more than\nremarkable, is even marvellous. The agreement is one part of\nthe wonder, it being remembered that the mediums are\nscattered through the world; but the other and greater part of\nit is that the impostors, if impostors they be, have combined\nto oppose all current ideas of a future state, in order to gain\nbelief in the genuineness of their pretensions\n!\nThe second point is this. It is as certain and demonstrable\nas anything can well be that many of the most striking\ndevelopments which have appeared in our recent investigations,\n\u2014I refer more particularly to the cross-correspondences,'\u2014-have\nnot originated in the speculations, the ingenuity, or the invention\nof any of the enquirers on this side,\u2014at any rate, not in their\nsupraliminal consciousness. These methods have come as a\nsurprise to all concerned, and I cannot but consider this to be\nin some degree an argument for their genuineness. From the\niirst, perhaps, the unexpected might have been expected ; and\nthis is not such a Hibernianism as it at first sight appears.\nWhat it means is that, assuming the communications to be\nreal, we might have expected surprises, but could not have\nexpected to forecast their nature. And this is just what in\nfact has happened.\nIn the preceding summary of our work and its results it\nmay be observed that there are so many \"ifs,\" so many instances\nof the use of the cautious subjunctive, that some may be dis-\n\f348 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nposed to ask whether the attainment of such uncertain results\nafter so many years is sufficient to justify our labour. Is the\ngame worth the candle ? As to this, I have already expressed\nmy view as to the incalculable value of the discovery of tele-\npathy, even in its most elementary form. Now I will go\nfurther. I agree, if I may presume to say so, with Professor\nBarrett that we seem to be \"On the threshold of a new world\nof thought.\" I agree, if again I may presume to say so, with\nSir Oliver Lodge that we seem to be \" at the beginning of\nwhat is practically a new branch of science.\" And if these\nweighty estimates of the results attained be accepted, what be-\ncomes of the significance of the phrase \"after so many years?\"\nWhat are twenty-five years in the history of a science, a discovery,\nan invention ? Is not this history in all its course a protest\nagainst impatience ? I believe that some twenty-two centuries\nago Hero in Egypt discerned the possibility of utilising the\nexpansive force of steam as a means of driving a macliine ; and\nhe was probably not the first. But the discovery had to wait\nall those centuries before it was taken up by Watt and New-\ncomen, Trevithick and Stephenson, and this force was turned\nto account to do so great a portion of the work of the world\nas we find it doing to-day. The same reflection applies to\nmagnetism and to electricity, the first observers of which little\ndreamed of the results which would accrue from their groping\nexperiments ; and I suppose that the school-boy's humble kite,\nafter playing an important part in the history of electricity,\nmay be regarded as the progenitor after a long period of incu-\nbation of the aeroplane ; a sort of protozoon from which has\nbeen evolved an eagle. Again, it is easy to smile over the\ncrude hypotheses and futile labours of the old alchemists. But\nowes modern chemistry no deljt to those patient explorers ? It\nis likely enough that a century or so hence our successors in\nthese enquiries will smile at our methods and conjectures much\nas does the modern chemist at the theories and dreams of the\nalchemists; but we shall have helped them nevertheless, and if\nthey are as wise as we hope they will be, they will not despise\nthe day of small and feeble things.\nBut we need not elaborate an argument to justify our exist-\nence. We are not called upon to justify our existence to\ntroglodytes ; and critics who have no higher or better point of\n\fLXI.] Presidential Address. 349\nview for estimating the value of a scientific discovery than by\ncalculating its immediate commercial or utilitarian value, may\nfairly be so described.\nApart, however, from any such questions of detail, I contend\nthat our studies are justified on the ground that they are help-\ning us to a wider view of the universe in which we live, in\nwhich I think we shall always live, in which, perhaps, in a\nsense, we have always lived ; to lift us, as one has said, from\n\" a mere planetary consciousness which naturally starts from\nthe earth as a mental centre, to a solar or systematic conscious-\nness more consistent with the Copernicau era, or yet higher, and\nby a completer generalisation to a cosmical consciousness, of\nwhich indeed the foregleams may be discerned in the very\nquestions we ask, in the very doubts suggested to us, in the\nvery paradoxes of which Nature is full.\" We have, I venture\nto think, done much towards undermining the gross materialism\nof some scientific thought, which a generation ago threatened\nthe higher conceptions of all matters psychological and spiritual.\nSome of you will doubtless remember the intensely interesting\npresidential address given to us by Sir William Crookes fourteen\nyears ago, in which by a series of ingenious speculations he demon-\nstrated the folly of what may be called a negative dogmatism,\nwhich would seek to discredit the exploration of regions hitherto\nunknown or but imperfectly known, on the ground of the\nseeming inconsistency of the phenomena presented with the\nordinary course of nature familiar to us ;\nor, if I may use a\nmathematical comparison, the folly of attempting to frame an\nequation to a curve, before, with the imperfect instruments of\nobservation at our command, we have been able sufficiently to\ndiscern its sweep to determine whether like an ellipse it returns\non itself, or like a hyperbola it stretches forth into the infinite.\nIt is perhaps somewhat daring to attempt to add an illustra-\ntion in similar vein to those in that address so brilliantly\npresented. But I have often thought that the prophecy of\ndespair with which the materialist would depress us may be\ncompared to the despair which might fall on an ephemeral\ninsect which we will suppose to have come into existence at\nthe noon-tide of a sunny day, and to be endowed with the\nfaculty of scientific observation. He would, after living, say,\na quarter of his life-time, notice that the sun, the source of\n\f350 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nlight and heat was gradually descending towards the horizon of\nthe sea. His own philosophy would tell him nothing of the\nseqvience of day and night, for he has never seen the sun\nascending. His science then would boldly, and, from his point\nof view, reasonably, conclude that with the setting sun all life\nwould cease. So our materialistic science tells us that the solar\nsystem which we know is slowly wearing itself out by friction\nand radiation ; that the time surely approaches when the sun\nwill be dark and cold with all its planets engulfed in its mass,\nand that universal death will reign, having put all enemies under\nhis feet. But may not this despairing cry be as false as that of\nthe ephemeris which mourned the setting sun ? Who can deny\nthe conceivability of another cycle of existence as truly growing\nout of this we know as day follows day, feon following seon\nby equally natural process, marking the systole and diastole\nof the heart of the Eternal ? Are there not indeed ancient words\nwhich declare as much, when of the visible universe we read \" as\na vesture shalt Thou fold it up and it shall be changed, but Thou\nart the same ;\nThy years fail not.\" \" The things which are not\nseen are eternal \" ?\nIn conclusion let me quote again from Sir Edwin Arnold's\nessay\nWhen we regard the stars at midnight, we veritably perceive the\nmansions of nature, countless and illimitable ; so that even our\nnarrow senses reprove our timid minds. If such shadows of an\nimmeasurable and inexhaustible future of peace, happiness, beauty\nand knowledge, be but ever so faintly cast from what are real\nexistences, fear and care might, at one word, pass from the minds\nof men, as evil dreams depart from little children waking to their\nmother's kiss ; and all might feel how subtly wise he was who wrote\nof that first mysterious night on earth which showed the unsuspected\nstars ; when\nHesperus with the host of heaven came,\nAnd lo !

PIPEE.\nBY HELEN de G. VERRALL.\nIntroduction.\nThe sittings with Mrs. Piper published in this Eeport are\namongst those that were held in America, at Arlington\nHeights, Boston, under the management of Dr. Hodgson. They\nextend over a period of five years and a half, from June 19,\n1899, to November 22, 1905, the last of the series having\ntaken place only a few weeks before Dr. Hodgson's death. All\nthe communications purport to come either from a young man,\nBennie Junot, who died on September 5, 1898, aged 17 ; or\nfrom persons in some way connected with him. Dr. Hodgson\nhimself was present during a part at any rate of all the\nsittings, with one exception ; sometimes he was alone, and\nsometimes the father or mother of Bennie Junot or other\nmembers of his family were present as sitters. This Eeport\nincludes every sitting up to November 22, 1905, at which any\nreference was made to Bennie Junot, and nothing has been\nomitted except (1) occasional repetitions due to the sitters'\ndifficulty at the time in deciphering the trance-writing, (2)\nremarks which do not purport to be in any way evidential,\nsuch as \" I won't forget to send you a message occasionally,\"\n(3) interruptions by other communicators not connected with\nBennie Junot, and (4) some attempts at medical diagnosis,\nwhich could be more satisfactorily discussed in connexion with\nsimilar attempts at other sittings. It will therefore be possible\nto form a fair judgment of the whole case and to estimate the\nproportion of correct and incorrect statements.\n^This name and also the name '\"Roble\" (see below) are pseudonyms.\n\f352 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nThe phenomena here discussed were produced under the\nusual conditions, with which I shall assume that the reader is\nfamiliar\/ and they do not present to those who have read the\nearlier reports on Mrs. Piper's trance-phenomena any new or\nstartling features. But the cumulative effect of the evidence,\ntaken as a whole, is striking, on account of the unusually small\nproportion of error, confusion and irrelevance, and there are\nmany points of psychological interest. One clearly marked\ncharacteristic is the large part played in the trance utterances\nby the association of ideas. Dr. Hodgson has referred to this\ncharacteristic in his Eeport on Mrs. Piper {Proc. Vol. XIII. p.\n333), and frequent traces of it are to be found in the sittings now\nunder consideration. If a group of names has been once asso-\nciated together, an allusion to any one of them is very likely\nto produce allusions to the others. The human mind in its\nnormal condition is largely influenced by such associations, but\ntheir force is controlled by consciousness and deliberate choice.\nIn the case of Mrs. Piper's mind, during trance, this control is\napparently lacking, so that associations once formed will often\nrecur without regard to their immediate relevance. This char-\nacteristic will also explain the tendency to repeat a mistake\nonce made. For instance, the confusion between \" Judge \" and\n\"Major\" (see p. 443) persists throughout the sittings, in spite\nof the fact that some part of the medium's mind is apparently\naware of it (see p. 470).\nWith regard to the sources of error, it is worth noting that\namongst the statements which must be described as incorrect,\nonly a small proportion are wholly false or meaningless. Many\ncontain some phrase or word perfectly relevant and intelligible,\nround which is woven a tissue of false interpretations. At\nthe first sitting, for instance, the following communication\noccurs :\n(Bennie communicating.)\nDo you remember who I meant by John\nN. B. J.\" No, tell me his other name.\nWell do you remember Roberts\niThey are described by Dr. Hodgson in Proc. Vol. XIII. pp. 291 foil, and\nby Sir Oliver Lodge in Proc. Vol. XXIII. pp. 1.30 foil.\n^ Mr. N. B. Junot, the communicator's father.\n\fLXi.] Report on the Junot Sittings luith Mrs. Piper. 353\nN. B. J. No.\nRoberts there is more to it Roberts\nN. B. J. \"Where <lid 3'ou know him 1\nHere and he has two brothers FRAK and Charles\nFrank and Charles were the names of the commuuicator's two\nmost intimate friends, so that it was quite natural that he\nshould mention them in close conjunction, and he had an uncle\ncalled John. All these facts are made clear at later sittings,\nbut the interpretation first put upon the names is wrong. It\nis as though vague unattached ideas were presented to the mind\nof the medium, and were by her provided with an imaginary\nand inappropriate setting. The same tendency is apparent\nin some of the various automatic scripts recently published.\nWith a few exceptions, of which the most interesting is the\nJohn Welsh incident related below, no information was given\nin the trance communications that had not been known at\nsome time to some members of Benuie Junot's family, but\nmany of the clearest and most correct statements were made\nnot in their presence but when Dr. Hodgson was alone. The\ncommunicator declares that he often visits his home and sees\nwhat happens there ; in support of this claim, he shows\nknowledge concerning the recent thoughts and actions of\nvarious members of his family, and on one occasion reference\nis made to a contemporaneous event (see p. 416).\nIt will be noted that a considerable amount of information as\nto names and other details was deliberately given to the com-\nmunicator by the sitters in the course of the sittings, and it is\nnecessary in reading the report to distinguish carefully between\nthe correct statements founded on this information and others\nwhich originated spontaneously with the communicator. I have\ngiven page references and notes throughout to facilitate the\ndistinction.\nThe plan was no doubt adopted by Mr. Junot with a view to\neliciting memories that might be supposed to be dormant. It is a\nplausible hypothesis that if the communicator were reminded of\ncertain names and certain incidents, other recollections associated\nwith them might be evoked, and the results obtained are\nconsistent with this hypothesis.\nNevertheless, there is nothing in the evidential part of the\n\f354 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\ncommunications which provably transcends telepathy between\nliving minds, if we suppose this faculty to possess the\nnecessary scope and extension. Perhaps the incident most\ndifficult to explain in this way is that concerning John\nWelsh, which I will briefly recapitulate here. On February 11,\n1902 (see p. 492), Mr. Junot sent a message through his son\nBennie to a former coachman of his, Hugh Irving, who had\nbeen dead some months, asking where \" the dog Eounder \" was.\nHugh Irving had left Mr. Junot's service about two months\nbefore his death and taken the dog with him. In the waking-\nstage on April 2, 1902, it is stated that \"John Welsh has\nRounder.\" Mr. Junot succeeded after some difficulty in tracing\n\" John Welsh,\" but unfortunately it proved impossible to discover\nwhether he had ever had the dog in his possession. It is\ncertain, however, that he was closely associated with the\ncoachman, who took the dog away, and it was through his\nattempts to find John Welsh that Mr. Junot recovered the\ndog. Moreover, there seems good reason for thinking that\nJohn Welsh, even if he never had the dog himself, knew\nsomething of his whereabouts, and could have helped Mr. Junot\nto recover him. Neither Mr. Junot nor any of his family\nhad ever to their knowledge heard of John Welsh (at any rate\nunder that name), still less of his connexion with Hugh Irving\nand possible connexion with the dog. Doubtless people could\nhave been found to whom all these facts were known, but\nthey were not people with whom Mrs. Piper had ever been\nbrought into contact. Until we know to what limitations, if\nany, telepathy between living minds is subject, we cannot\ndetermine whether it is a sufficient explanation of such\nphenomena as this.\nOn the other hand, if we suppose, as the controls them-\nselves declare, that the source of the information is the minds\nof the dead, such incidents present no difficulty, and therefore,\nthough they cannot be said to prove this hypothesis, they would,\nif frequently repeated, render it more probable.\nWhatever hypothesis we adopt to explain the veridical part\nof the phenomena, the confused and incorrect statements are\nno doubt in a great measure to be accounted for by mere\nguessing and invention on the part of the medium's subliminal\nconsciousness, persistently unwilling to admit ignorance or failure.\n\fLXi.] Report on the Junot Sittings ivith Mrs. Piper. 355\nI have said nothing iu this report as to the identity of\nthe alleged controls (e.g. Eector), who purport to influence the\nmedium's mind directly, or as to their relation either to one\nanother or to the mind of the medium, or to the communicators\n(e.g. Bennie Junot), whose remarks they claim to transcribe,\nand who rarely act as '\ncontrols '\nthemselves, because I do not\nthink this question can be satisfactorily discussed in relation\nto a particular episode such as is dealt with here. This same\nobjection applies in my opinion to almost all theorizing as to\nthe nature of the phenomena, and therefore in my comments on\nthe sittings I have usually confined myself to a statement of facts.\nDr. Hodgson regarded these sittings as amongst the most\ninteresting of those held with Mrs. Piper, and they were\ncarefully annotated with a view to publication. With few\nexceptions, all comments by the sitters were obtained within a\nweek or two of the sittings ; wherever the dates of these\ncomments are of importance they are given. There are\noccasionally points not commented on at the time, about\nwhich it is not now possible to obtain any information, but\nfortunately they are few.\nIt will be seen that most of the evidence as to the\nveridical character of these sittings has been obtained from Mr.\nJunot. Mr. Junot is a member of the S.P.E. who was\nformerly a member of the American Branch, and a friend of\nDr. Hodgson's ; he is also known personally to Mr. Dorr.\nThe study of these records will show that his comments are\ncharacterized throughout by scrupulous care and accuracy.\nDETAILED RECORD OF SITTINGS.\nNote. \u2014The notes in round brackets were made at the sitting by the\nperson responsible for the management of it, that is, in almost all cases,\nby Dr. Hodgson. The notes in square brackets are comments added\nafterwards by the persons whose initials are appended to them.\n1st Sitting.\nJ?me 19, 1899. Present.- N.B. Junot and R.

With regard to the possibility\nof Mrs. Piper knowing the name Junot, N. B. J. writes\n\" We knew nothing of Dr. Hodgson or Mrs. Piper until the\nsummer before Bennie's death, when one of our neighbours\ngave us a copy of the S. P.

Some time\nafter Bennie's death I wrote to Dr. Hodgson, applying for\nmembership in the American Branch and asking for a sitting.\nHe and Mrs. Piper knew nothing of us. We resided in a very\nlarge city 1000 miles away from them. Dr. Hodgson never\nmentioned our names in Mrs. Piper's presence for four or five\nyears after our first sitting.\n\"Our son died at the seashore about 100 miles away from\nBoston. We know of no notice of his death in any Boston\npaper. It is certainly very unlikely that there should have\nbeen any such notice. We have always lived in the West\nand have little acquaintance in or about Boston.\n\" At all our sittings we always saw Mrs. Piper before the\ntrance, but only for a few moments and always in Dr. Hodgson's\npresence. Mrs. Piper never came to know us until Mr. Dorr\nintroduced us after Dr. Hodgson's death.\"\nIf Mrs. Piper had ever seen jST. B.

This is\nthe first time that his name occurs in the sittings (the\nname Frank which had occurred several times was always\nsupposed by the sitters to refer to Frank B., and as there\nis no suggestion of a relationship between Frank and Bennie\nthis interpretation is probably correct.) On November 14,\n1900, N. B. J. wrote a letter to r)r. Hodgson, in which\nhe said :\n\" Tell Bennie that Aunt Alice sends her love and\nwould be very glad to hear from her son Frank and Uncle\nFrank Clarke who has lately passed out of this life.\" At\nthe next sitting at which Bennie communicated, January\n30, 1901, Dr. Hodgson told Bennie that this letter from\nN. B. J. only reached him after he was in England. He\nmentioned several of the messages contained in it, but said\nnothing of the paragraph quoted above (see p. 440). The\nallusion to \" Cousin Frank \" occurred in the next communica-\ntion from Bennie on Febniary 18, 1901, and at the sitting\nof February 19, 1901, after alluding again to \"Cousin\nFrank \" he says :\n\" I thought Dad asked me did he not ?\nIn fact his language is just such as might have been\nexpected, if the message sent by IST. B. J. on November 14,\n1900, had been duly delivered. In view of the great care\nshown in recording these sittings, it does not seem prob-\nable that any allusion to \" Cousin Frank '\"\nmade either by\nthe sitters or by Dr. Hodgson would have passed unnoted.\n\u2014H. de G. v.]\nITtij Sitting.\nFebruary 19, 1901.

June 17, 1902.\n\" You will rememlaer that I reported to you that after receiving\nthe brief communication to the effect that '\nJohn Welch ' had the\ndog '\nRounder,' I set about finding John Welch and was unable\nto find him, but in the process, found the dog in the hands of\nJames M. and recovered him. This dog is a champion ratter.\nHugh was, I am told, in the habit of entering him in rat killing\nmatches for money, so that it was apparent that any of the dog-\nmen would like to have the dog. Men who are in the dog business\nare often not of a high character and the word of such is not\nworth much.\nJames M. was formerly a coachman in our neighborhood. He\nclaims that Hugh gave hitn the dog. He seemed over-anxious\nthat I should not think that he had come by the dog wrongfully,\nand I was not much impressed with his statements.\nAbout teii days ago, it occurred to me to renew my inquiries\nthrough Walter W., who is a fine fellow, being dejjuty sheriff\nfor our immediate district. It is one of his duties to keep acquainted\nwith every one in the neighbourhood. I asked him if he knew\nJohn Welch. He answered at once as follows: 'Yes; that's \"old\nHappy.\" He works for Conrad M. He was a great friend of\nHugh. They \"worked the growler\" together of nights.' I then\nsaid: 'How do you know that his name is John Welch?' The\nanswer was :\n'\nThat's his real name. I had him registered to vote.\nEverybody knows him as \" Old Happy \" but his right name is John\nWelch.' I then told Walter W. why I wanted to know about\nthis, and he said he would get one of the printed lists of the\n\fLXi.] Report on the Junot Sittings ivUIl Mrs. Fiper. 517\nregistered voters of the precinct east of our own precinct, and it\nwould show 'Old Happy ' registered as a voter, and to-day he brought\nme the list Mdiich I enclose to you. It shows at the top of second\ncolumn '\nJohn Walsh ' registered from 2807 Avenue. Walter\nW. says, however, that '\nOld Happy '\ncalled himself '\nWelch ' or\n'Welsh,' and that he was so registered on former registrations.\nThe enclosed list is for the last election. It will be difficult to get\nany of the former lists, as they are commonl}^ destroyed after the\nrespective election, but I will get one if practicable.\nWalter W. said that he talked with '\nOld Happy '\nthis morning\nand '\nOld Happy ' knew all about the dog, but became suspicious,\nand demanded to know why W. questioned him, because he said :\n'They've got the dog back and why do you want to knowl'\nW. says, 'It's no use to bother with the old \"boozer\" any more.'\"]\n[List Encloseil.\nRegistered Voters\nElection of\nApril 1st, 1902.\nPrecinct IS\nWard 2.\nwith name of JoJin JJ'alsh, 2807,\nIssued by\nBoard of Election\nCommissioners\nof the\nCity of C.\n\u2014 Ave.\nR. H.l\n[Letter from Walter W., July 22, 1902.\n\"I knew Bennie Junot during his whole life-time\u2014having always\nlived near Mr. Junot's home. I also knew the colored man, Hugh\nIrving, who was Mr. Junot's coachman for about 20 years.\nHugh Irving had a friend, still living in the neighbourhood, by\nname John Walsh. Walsh is a working man who lived near. He\nand Hugh were much togethei'. Walsh is commonly known as\n'\nOld Happy.' I don't know whether Bennie Junot knew Walsh\nor not, but he probably did. I supposed that the name was JFelsh\nuntil I lately made enquiry from members of his family as to how\nthey spelt their name,' and have sometimes addressed him as\nWelsh.\nAt Mr. Junot's recjuest I visited Walsh, or Welsh, and asked\n\f518 Helen de G. Verrall. [part\nhim about the dog Rounder. He quickly became suspicious and\nwould not talk, saying '\nWhat are you asking about the dog for ?\nThey have got him back.'\nThe dog liounder is well known in the neighbourhood. Lately\nI have again called on Walsh and asked about Hugh and the dog.\nHe now says that Hugh not long before his death gave Rounder\nto a colored man, whom he knows by sight, but not by name.\nSome time ago Walsh's mother in talking with my wife called their\nname as Welsh.\"]\n[It will be seen from the above statements that Bennie's asser-\ntion about Rounder is not shown to be accurate. But it is interesting\nthat the name he gives should be that of a man closely associated\nwith Hugh Irving and therefore very likely to have known the\nwhereabouts of the dog, even if he never had it in his own\npossession. \u2014H. de G.

The psychological and therapeutic aspects of hypnotism\nhave ever been closely associated, and the further developments\nof a subject for which Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney did so much\nshould be of interest to all who are interested in psychical\nresearch. It may not then be out of place to review briefly\nsome of the more recent work which has been done in this\ndepartment, irrespective of any immediate bearing which it may\napjDear to have on the problems with which as a Society we are\nmainly concerned.\nThe occasion for such a review is afforded by the publication\nin the June-July (1909) number of the Journal of Abnormal\nPsychology of a series of papers which were read at a symposium\non Psychotherapy arranged by the American Therapeutic Society\nfor their annual meeting on May 6th, 1909.\nThe President of the Society, Dr. Frederick Henry Gerrish,\ntook as the subject of his presidential address The Therapeutic\nValue of Hypnotic Suggestion. He said he did not wish to enter\n2u\n\f666 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ninto any discussion of the various theories which have been\nadvanced to account for hypnotic phenomena. His desire was\nrather\n'\n' to set forth the practical usefulness of hypnotism in the\ndaily routine of medical work, and to clear away many miscon-\nceptions which have prevented the general employment of this\nagency.\" In doing so he showed the same enthusiasm as is\nalways shown by those who have had much experience of the\nuse of hypnotic suggestion in general practice.\nWe are constantly told that hypnotism is only of value in\ndealing with functional nervous disorders, and we might suppose\nthat its most enthusiastic supporters would be found among the\nneurologists, and that the general practitioner would find it of\ncomparatively little use in his daily work. But as a matter of\nfact it is only when it is used in the great variety of bodily and\nmental disorders which come under the care of the general\npractitioner that the extent of* its field of usefulness becomes\nclearly manifest. It is then also that its limitations become\naccepted in the same spirit as are the limitations of other thera-\npeutic measures. The specialist, on the other hand, whether he\nbe a specialist in neurology or a specialist in hypnotism, is very\napt to have these limitations forced too prominently on his\nattention, and it is not uncommon to find men writing dis-\nparagingly of hypnotism who in their earlier studies had been\nfavourably im^Dressed by its therapeutic value, and even enthusi-\nastic in its advocacy as a mode of treatment. Whatever be the\nreason, there is a tendency at the present time to decry the use\nof hypnotism and to extol other forms of psychic treatment which\nhave arisen in conjunction with modern studies in abnormal\npsychology. A good introduction to these newer forms of treat-\nment may be found in Dr. Morton Prince's j^a-pei' on The\nPsychological Pri7icij)les and Field of Psychotherapy\nIt is a fundamental law of the structure and growth of the\nmind that ideas, feelings, emotions, movements, sensations,\nassociated in experience, tend to become linked together into a\nsystem or group in such fashion that the stimulation of one\nelement in the group stimulates the activity of the rest. Such\na system or group Dr. Prince calls a complex.\nA complex may be composed almost entirely of ideas and\nfeelings or of physiological processes, although more frequently\nit is made up partly of psychical and partly of jihysiological\nelements. In every pulse of consciousness the potentiality of\n\fLXI.] Review. 667\ncomplex formation exists, but it is only under certain conditions\nthat tlie psycho-physical disposition of the moment becomes so\norganised that anything like complete reproduction of all its\nelements can afterwards be brought about. There are two main\nconditions on which the formation of complexes depends. In\nthe formation of normal complexes the most important factor is\nrepetition: it is on this that the efficacy of education depends.\nIn the formation of abnormal complexes the nature of the emotion\nor feeling tone accompanying the experience is the most frequent\ncause of the organisation of its elements into a complex.\nSince past experiences may be revived in consciousness, we\nmust believe that somehow and somewhere they are preserved,\nand Dr. Prince thinks that conscious memory of any past experi-\nence would be impossible unless there was some jDhysical arrange-\nment for preserving it. However this may be, we have good\ngrounds for believing that every element in an experience is\ncorrelated with some alteration in the nervous system, \"and we\nmust infer that some kind of residue or impi'essiou, chemical or\nphysical, is left in the neurones, in consequence of which they\nhave a disposition to reproduce, when again stimulated, the\noriginal experience, whether an idea or physiological reaction.\"\nThe neuronic residua of a mental complex Dr. Prince terms\nan \"unconscious complex,\" and it is on the organisation of the\nunconscious complexes that the conservation of mental and\nphysiological complexes depends. The factors which determine\nthe conservation of complexes are in the main the same as those\nwhich lead to their formation, namely, repetition and emotion or\nfeeling tone. Both repetition and the intensity of emotional\ntone in an experience seem to intensify the impression made upon\nthe brain, and the greater the impression made upon the brain\nthe more readily is the unconscious complex aroused to function.\nOf course the doctrine of neurone residua as the substratum of\nmemory is a commonjDlace of physiological psychology ; the point\ninsisted on here is that the elements of an experience which from\nany cause has led to the formation of a complex are not only\nconserved as neurone residua, but that they are conserved as a\nresiduum complex whose re-excitation will be accompanied by a\nreproduction of the original experience.\nWithout the organisation and conservation of comjDlexes their\nvoluntary recall would be impossible, but the fact that an experi-\nence has been conserved as a complex is no guarantee that it can\n\f668 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nbe recalled voluntarily ; and the fact that an experience cannot\nbe recalled voluntarily is no proof that it has not been conserved\nas a complex. An experience of childhood may be completely\nforgotten so far as our waking recollection is concerned, yet it\nmay be recalled in detail during hypnosis or in dream. When a\ncomplex which is well organised and conserved cannot be recalled\nvoluntarily there is said to be mental dissociation, and the correlated\nneural state is said to be one of cerebral dissociation. Dr. Prince\nbelieves that dissociation is \"a general principle governing the\nnormal psycho-nervous mechanism, and therefore in a highly\nmarked form only is pathological. . . . Among the normal\nphenomena of dissociation are to be reckoned temporary and\nsome permanent forms of forgetfulness, the limitation of the field\nof consciousness in absentmindedness, moods, anger, and other\nstrong emotional states, and sleep. Amongst the artificial and\npathological conditions characterising largely or chiefly the dis-\nsociations are hyjDnotic and hypnoidal states ;\nsuggested and\nhysterical amnesia, paralyses, contractures, anaesthesia, etc.\nsomnambulism, trance, psycholeptic attacks, etc.\"\nWhen an unconscious complex is stimulated the correlated\nmental complex arises in consciousness as a memory of which we\nare aware ; but when a complex which is dissociated from the\ngreat mass of complexes which form the waking personality is\nstimulated \"ideas are awakened, but we are not aware of them.\nThese are what are called subconscious, or better, co-conscious\nideas, which means ideas dissociated from, split off from the main\nconsciousness.\"\nWell organised complexes have a tendency to function more\nor less automatically and thus to determine the direction of our\nthought and its content. This is well illustrated by those patho-\nlogical fixed ideas which rush into consciousness unbidden and\nundesired. The automatic functioning of complexes is most\nmarked when they are dissociated and thus freed from the\ninhibitory control of the personal consciousness. The threshold\nof stimulation of dissociated complexes is lowered, their activity\nis easily aroused, and they are capable of extremely independent\nfunctioning. The type of this form of automatism is the sub-\nconscious fixed ideas of hysteria.\nThe relation of emotion to the formation, functioning, con-\nservation and dissociation of complexes is very important and in\nmany respects obscure. As already said, the intensity of emotion\n\fLXI.] Review. 669\naccompanying an experience seems more than anything else to\ndetermine the formation and conservation of the mental complex.\nBut if the emotion be of a painful or distressing character, in\naddition to its effect in stamping the experience indelibly on the\nmind, it may also have a disintegrating effect on consciousness\nas a whole. The complex formed by the experience may become\ndissociated from the personal consciousness so that its voluntary\nrecall may be impossible. On the other hand, exalting emotions\nhave an integrating effect, and are accompanied by an invigoration\nof the whole organism.\nOne of the most interesting and most important features in\nthe relation between an ideational complex and the emotions\nwhich accompany its revival in consciousness is the fact that when\na dissociated complex is roused to function co-consciously, the\npersonal or primary consciousness may be strongly affected by\nthe emotion although unaware of the ideational content of the\nco-conscious thought.\nPersonality, character, thoughts, hopes and aspirations, even\nbodily well-being, depend on the nature of the mental and\nphysiological complexes which have been formed in the course of\nexperience. And it does not matter in what state a complex\nhas been formed, whether in waking life, sleep, trance, or in\nhypnosis. So long as it is conserved it becomes part of our\npersonality, and may at any time affect our life for good or evil\naccording to its nature. Intellectual and ethical growth and\nmuch of our bodily well-being are the result of the formation,\nby the slow process of education, of complexes whose essential\nelements are conserved by means of repetition. And in the\ntreatment of mental, moral and physical disorders which are due\nto the functioning of unhealthy complexes, there is no way of\ncure but by the formation of new complexes of a different\ncharacter. The old morbid complexes must be broken up and\nnew ones substituted for them, and whatever method may be\nemjDloyed to effect this, the process is essentially an educative\none.\nIn the treatment of the simpler psycho-neuroses of the neuras-\nthenic type where the disturbance can be traced to the formation\nof morbid associations, to unhealthy ideas, self-examination,\nworry, erroneous beliefs in and apprehension of disease with the\ndepressive emotional tones that go with such states, the main\nprinciple to be made use of is the substitution of healthy com-\n\f670 T. W. Mitchell, M D. [part\nplexes in place of the unhealthy ones. \"The point of view, the\nattitude of mind, the beliefs, the habits of thought, must be\nmodified by the introduction of new points of view, of data\njDreviously unknown to the patient and drawn from the wider\nexperience of the physician ; by instruction in the meaning of\nsymptoms and in their organisation and causes ;\nby the suggestion\nof expectations that justly may be fulfilled ; of ambitions that\nought rightfully to be entertained ; of duties to be assumed but\ntoo long neglected ; of confidence and hope, and above all, by\nthe suggestion of the emotion and joy that go with success and\na roseate vista of a new life.\"\nThe relative advantages of education in hypnosis and in the\nwaking state is a much discussed question. From Dr. Prince's\npoint of view it matters little in what state therapeutic systems\nof ideas are formed, whether in hypnosis or in the waking state.\nIn obstinate cases he thinks hypnosis has the advantage that\nsuggestibility being increased and antagonistic ideas being dis-\nsociated or inhibited, the new ideas are more readily accejoted\nand firmly organised.\nWhen dissociation exists the disturbing subconscious ideas need\neither to be so modified that they cease to function or they must\nbe reintegrated with the personal consciousness and thereby\nrealised in all their meaning, rearranged and modified. There\nare various ways of doing this. \" So-called psycho-analysis,\nsuggestion in the waking state and abstraction, in so-called\nhypnoidal states and hypnosis, mental and physical hygiene, all\nhave proved to be eflBcient in bringing about a reintegration of\ndissociated functions. But all these methods are only different\nforms of education.\"\nSo also in dealing with the more profound psycho-neuroses,\nthose of the severer hysterias, reassociation of the dissociated\nfunctions is the essential principle. Sometimes reintegration can\nbe formed in a special state of hypnosis ; sometimes by suggestion\nin hypnosis or in the waking state, sometimes by recalling the\ndissociated ideas into the full light of the waking consciousness.\nSome writers think that when hysterical manifestations are due\nto the functioning of dissociated subconscious ideas it is always\nnecessary to recall those ideas to the j^ersonal waking conscious-\nness ; but Dr. Prince says \"It is enough to break up the\nsubconscious complex or to suggest antagonistic ideas, or to\nresynthesise the ideas in the manner already described, into a\n\fLXI.] Review. 671\nhealthy complex which gives a true appreciation of the facts\nwhich they represent. This can be done in hypnosis. After\nwaking, though amnesia for the previous subconscious ideas may\npersist, the symptoms disappear, for those harmful subconscious\nideas which caused the trouble have ceased to exist.\"\nIt may be seen from this short summary of Dr. Prince's paper\nthat he restricts the field of psychotherapy to those disorders\nwhich depend on the functioning of abnormal complexes ; that\nthe psycho-neuroses so produced may be roughly divided into two\ngreat groups according to whether the abnormal comjDlexes are\nor are not dissociated from the waking personality ; that the\ntreatment of the psycho-neuroses is always in essence an educative\nprocess, whereby the old abnormal complexes are broken up or\ndestroyed and new healthy complexes formed in their stead ; and\nfinally, that various methods may be employed for the purpose\nof rendering the re-education of the patient easier and the result\nmore permanent.\nAccepting the view that treatment consists in the formation\nof healthy complexes we may classify the methods adopted by\nreference to the mental state in which the educative process is\nattempted. This may be the waking state, or hypnosis, or any\nintermediate state which may be found between the waking state\nand hypnosis. Another classification may be made in reference\nto the method employed in presenting the ideas whose acceptance\nis necessary for the formation of healthy complexes. We may\nuse simple explanation and persuasion, suggestion, or psycho-\nanalysis. In practice, however, an artificial classification, resulting\nfrom the use of particular methods by individual therapeutists\nis adopted, and it is to a consideration of the more important of\nthese methods, as illustrated by the writers in the Journal under\nreview, that we must now direct our attention.\nDr. E. W. Taylor discusses Simple Explanation and Re-educa-\ntion as a Therapeutic Method, and this method is also advocated\nby Dr. G. A. Waterman in a paper on The Treatment of Fatigue\nStates. The treatment of fatigue states by this method was\nintroduced by Dejerine as an auxiliary to the plan of trusting\nto isolation, rest, over-feeding and electricity, advocated by Weir\nMitchell. Its wider application to the psycho-neuroses as a whole\nand to other disorders we owe to Professor Dubois of Berne. In\nDubois' book, The Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders, we\nJaave an interesting and able contribution to psycho-therapeutics,\n\f672 T. W. Mitchell, M.B. [part\nmarred however by extreme prejudice in regard to the employ-\nment of hypnotism and uncritical denunciation of suggestion as\na curative measure. His work is the product of a mind trained\nin the traditions of a past generation and almost unaffected by\nthe trend of modern psychological and philosophical speculation.\nHe mourns over the suggestibility of mankind, and would rather\nnot cure sick peoj^le at all than do so by utilising the very weak-\nness which has led to their sickness. He shows a pathetic respect\nfor human reason, and follows the rationalist philosophers in\nascribing to it a supremacy in matters of belief and conduct which\nis denied by the majority of modern thinkers. He confesses that\ngiving to the patient the conviction of cure is the most important\nfeature of his method, and he admits that there is faith in all\nconviction, but faith without reason he will have none of. He\ntherefore apjDeals to the reason of his patients, and when he finds\nthat they get cured he supposes that the cure is due solely to the\nrational acceptance of his explanations. Knowing as much as he\ndoes about suggestion and its possibilities, it is astonishing how\nProfessor Dubois can commit such an obvious fallacy.\nApart, however, from his rejection of suggestion deliberately\nused as a therapeutic agent, and his denial in reference to his\nown method of the part played by the suggestive influences which\nhe admits to be inherent in almost every other form of treatment,\nthe procedure which he recommends is based upon sound prin-\nciples and is an important feature in almost every form of\npsychotherapy. The essential points in Dubois' system are well\nsummarised by Dr. Taylor in the paper previously referred to.\nThey are as follows\n\"First. After eliminating or properly estimating physical\ncauses the mental attitude of the patient toward his ailment\nshould be carefully determined ; in other words, a diagnosis should\nbe made.\n\"Second. This is best accomplished by allowing him to tell\nhis com^Dlete story rather than by a primary process of interroga-\ntion on the part of the physician.\n\"Third. Having determined the false point of view almost\ninvariably revealed which has led up to the neurosis, the attempt\nis made to explain why such a series of events as that disclosed\nwould be likely to lead to this result.\n\"Fourth. Having impressed the patient with the correctness\nof the physician's point of view, the process of readjustment\n\fLXI.] Revieiv. 673\nbegins, or, to use the more popular but possibly too comprehensive\nterm, his re-education.\n\"Fifth. This is accomplished by pointing out in a painstaking\nway the correct way to mental health through a realization on\nthe part of the patient of his previous misconceptions and through\nan accompanying effort toward the establishment of more rational\nmental adjustment.\"\nDr. Taylor follows Dubois in thinking that the value of this\nmethod lies in its appeal to the reason, and that some special\nvirtue must inhere in such a \" commonsense basis of procedure,\nfree from all subtlety or demand for highly specialized training.\"\nHe considers the analysis of the mental state to be the essential\nfeature of the method, and thinks that \"this certainly recjuires\nno special personal attributes on the part of the physician, and\nis surely available for practitioners of no special education in this\nfield.\" It would seem as if Dr. Taylor had not fully appreciated\nthe difficulties encountered by those who without special education\nin this field try to analyse abnormal mental states, and it must\nsurely be a misconception of the nature of other psychotherapeutic\nmethods which leads him to suppose that they necessitate the\npossession of special attributes on the part of the physician.\nTaking the phrase \"personal attributes\" in its most general sense,\nwe shall probably find that no method of psychic treatment is so\ndependent for success on the personal attributes of the physician\nas the method of Rational Therapeutics advocated by Dubois.\nThe truth of this is evidently felt by Dr. Waterman, who says\n\"Whether this method can be generally adopted by practitioners\nis a great question. The remarkable personality of Dubois, and\nhis firm conviction as to the ethical and therapeutic value of his\nmethod, render it peculiarly efficient. It is difficult to conceive\nof a patient not being strongly moved by his remarks, which are\npresented by him so forcibly, and clinched by his frequent repeti-\ntion of his favourite phrase, '\nC'est la verite !\n'\nWhatever doubts may be entertained as to the necessity for\nspecial training in the employment of the mode of treatment just\nreferred to, there can be no doubt on this point in regard to the\nmethod of psycho-analysis elaborated by Professor Freud of\nVienna, of which an excellent account is given by Dr. Ernest\nJones of the University of Toronto in his contribution to the\nsymposium. Psycho-analysis in Psychotherapy.\nThe psycho-analytic form of psychotherapy is specially applicable\n\f674 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nto those psycho-neuroses in which a mental complex has become\ndissociated from the personal consciousness, and it is carried out\nby simultaneously laying bare and remedying the pathological\nmechanism at the basis of the malady. Hysteria may be taken\nas the type of these psycho-neuroses, and in order to understand\nwhat is meant by psycho-analysis it is necessary to have some\nknowledge of Freud's views on the nature and causation of\nhysteria.\nIt is acknowledged by the majority of modern observers that\nthe occurrence of hysterical symjotoms is associated with a splitting\nof consciousness and the subconscious functioning of dissociated\nmental states. Myers regarded stratification of consciousness as\npart of the normal structure of the mind, and he ascribed\nhysterical manifestations to a dream-like action of the subliminal\nconsciousness at the hypnotic level, whereby powers or faculties\nthat ought to be retained in the supraliminal become submerged\nand lost to the waking self. According to Janet hysterical\nsymptoms are the result of a splitting of consciousness, and all\nsubconscious manifestations are due to pathological dissociation.\nIn people who are lacking in cajjacity for psychic synthesis, in\nwhom there is narrowing of the field of consciousness, some of the\nideas that enter into the formation of personality tend to become\ndissociated from the waking consciousness and to take on indepen-\ndent functioning on their own account. Inability to keep a hold\non the whole of the conscious field is the cause of the splitting of\nconsciousness, and the stigmata of hysteria are the consequences.\nFreud's views regarding the origin of the mental dissociation\nmanifested in hysteria are quite different from those of Myers or\nJanet, and in some respects are totally opposed to them. Far\nfrom thinking it due to a dream-like action of the subliminal\nat the hypnotic level, or a merely accidental result of misere\npsycholoffique, Freud believes that the splitting of consciousness\nmet with in hysteria is caused by a deliberate act of will on the\npart of the j^atient. He does not, of course, mean to imply that\nthe jDatient intends to produce a splitting of consciousness. The\npatient's intention is different, but in trying to attain its aim it\njjrovokes a splitting of consciousness.\nPsychic health may exist so long as there is no hopeless incom-\npatibility between the ideas which enter into consciousness. But\nit may happen that an experience or an idea or a feeling may\narise which is so incompatible with all the ideas and feelings that\n\flxl] Reviexo. 675\nenter into the formation of the personality, that a jjsychical pain\nensues which is felt to be unbearable. If this unbearable idea is\nfairly faced, and if it can by any means be adjusted within the\npersonal consciousness, no harm will follow ; but if such adjust-\nment cannot be effected, if the personal consciousness will have\nnothing to do with the idea that has arisen, the unbearable idea\nis repressed by an act of will. The personal consciousness tries\nto forget it and to treat it as if it had never occurred. This can\nonly be done by taking away from it the emotional excitement\nwhich adheres to it, thereby changing the strong idea into a weak\none which will have little claim on the associative processes. But\nthe sum of the excitement thus fi'eed must be utilised in some\nother direction, and in j^eople who develop hysterical symptoms\nthere seems to be some psycho-physical adaptation which enables\nthe emotional excitement to be transformed into bodily innerva-\ntion. In hysteria the unbearable idea is rendered psychically\nharmless because the sum of excitement is transformed into\nphysical manifestations. This transformation, for which Freud\nproposes the term conversion, is to be regarded as a defence\nreaction of the Ego against unbearable ideas.\nIf there does not happen to be any adaptation for conversion\nto take place, and still for the purpose of defence a separation\nof the unbearable i-dea from its painful feeling-tone is necessary,\nthe emotional excitement must then remain in the psychic sphere.\nBut it separates from the unbearable idea and attaches itself to\nsome other idea not in itself unbearable, and in this way gives\nrise to obsessions or phobias.\nFrom his later work Freud has come to the conclusion that the\nrepressed idea is always of the nature of a wish, and that the\nhysterical symptom is a symbolic expression of its realisation.\nA wish whose realisation would be incompatible with the whole\npersonality of the patient is realised symbolically as a tremor or\na paralysis, and the hysterical symptom serves as a sort of uncon-\nscious gratification to the patient. When an unbearable idea is\nsuccessfully repressed a splitting of consciousness takes place, the\nrepressed complex takes on an automatic activity, and its function-\ning is manifested in the symptoms of the psycho-neurosis.\nThe aim of psycho-analysis is to discover the repressed complex\nwhich underlies the hysterical symptom, to reveal it in all its\nrelations and to bring it back into the waking consciousness of the\npatient. When the defence reaction of the Ego has been sue-\n\f676 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ncessful, when conversion has taken place, the repressed wish and\nthe circumstances under which it came to be entertained may be\ncompletely forgotten by the patient, and the distorted form in\nwhich the activity of the repressed complex becomes manifest\nforms the chief difficulty in discovering the real nature of the\nwish which is thus symbolised. Perhaps the most striking feature\nof the psycho-analytic method is the extraordinary ingenuity that\nhas been displayed by Freud and his disciples in elaborating a\ntechnique which is effective in unravelling the tangled skein of\npsycho-neural processes involved in the production of psycho-\nneurotic symptoms.\nThe procedure most generally employed for the purpose of\nresuscitating forgotten memories related to the repressed complex\nis to ask the patient to concentrate his mind on a given idea,\ngenerally one in relation to a symptom, and to relate in the order\nof their appearance all the thoughts that come to his mind. If\nhe does this quite honestly and without reservation, important\nclues as to the nature of the disturbing complex are very soon\ndiscovered. In most of the recent work in psycho-analysis very\neffective use has been made of a method elaborated by Jung of\nZurich. Sei'ies of test- words are called out to the patient, who\nhas to respond as quickly as possible by the first word or thought\nwhich arises in his mind in association with each test- word. Much\nmay be learned from the nature of the responses so given, but by\nnoting certain peculiarities in regard to these responses we are\nable to find with great certainty the elements of certain mental\ncomplexes which possess for the patient a high emotional value\ngenerally of a disagreeable nature. The first thing that may be\nnoticed in regard to these responses is that the reaction-time for\ncertain test- words is lengthened. In illustration of the delayed\nreaction-time, when the test-word is associated with an emotional\ncomplex, the instance taken from Jung, shown in the table on the\nfollowing page, may be given.\nAnother peculiarity which this table shows is that on asking the\nsubject to repeat one by one the answers to the test-words the\nreproductions are incorrect in all the instances in which the\noriginal reaction-time was prolonged. In this case it was evident\nthat some strong feeling-tone was associated with the words\nwater, ship, lake, swim, and the patient, when cautiously ques-\ntioned, confessed that a short time previously she had seriously\nthought of committing suicide by drowning.\n\fLXI.] Revieiu. 677\nstimulus word.

It is\nfound that if a galvanic current of low tension is passed through\nthe human body, the amount of current passing, as shown by a\ngalvanometer placed in the circuit, is increased when sensory\nstimuli of a certain strength are applied to the subject. But\nthe diminished resistance of the body thus shown varies not so\nmuch with the strength of the stimulus as with the intensity of\nthe resulting feeling-tone. Thus when the stimulus is a test-\nword in the word-association reaction experiment, very striking\ndeflections of the galvanometer are observed when the association\narouses an emotional complex.\nPrince and Petersen have shown that rises in the galvano-\nmetric curves can be obtained in cases of double personality\nwhere the emotional complex stimulated by the test-word is\ndefinitely co-conscious. Coriat has worked out the jDulse reactions\nto test-words in states of induced distraction, and he has found\nthat lengthened reaction times and high galvauometric curves\nare accompanied by acceleration of the pulse rate.\nThere are other peculiarities which may be observed in these\nassociation experiments which need not be referred to here.\nSuflSce it to say that by the methods just outlined, combined\nwith an analysis of the patient's dreams by means of the special\ntechnique introduced by Freud, it is possible to trace the origin\nof a symptom to its underlying complex, and the advocates of\npsycho-analysis as a therapeutic method maintain that by bringing\nsubmerged complexes to light and by enabling the patient to\n\f678 T. W. Mitchell, M.R [part\nunderstand and appreciate their significance in relation to his\nmalady, \"he is able to free his personality from the constraining\nforce of these complexes, and, by taking ujj an independent\nattitude towards them, to gain a degree of self-control over his\naberrant thoughts and wishes that was previously impossible.\"\nThe repressed complex, after being dissected and analysed in\nall its relations, becomes assimilated by the personal consciousness\nand the patient is thereby cured of his disorder.\nIn every attempt at scientific treatment of disease an accurate\ndiagnosis is the most essential preliminary. This is as true of\npsychotherapy as of treatment by physical or chemical measures.\nAnd just as in ordinary medical treatment accurate diagnosis\nhas been one of the latest phases in the history of the art, so\nin psychotherapy the empirical methods of earlier workers are\nbeing modified by the more accurate methods of investigation\nwhich are being evolved at the present time. The psycho-analytic\nprocedures elaborated by the Vienna and Zurich schools are the\nmost delicate instruments of psychical diagnosis which we at\npresent possess, and their value in this connection cannot fail\nto be recognised ; but when it is maintained that these pro-\ncedures are in themselves curative as well as diagnostic, there\nare good grounds for disputing the validity of the claim. To\ntrace the psychogenesis of a symptom is not in itself to modify\nthe complex which causes it, and if the psycho-analysis cannot\nbe successfully jDcrformed without at the same time so modifying\nthe complex that the symptom disappears, the influences which\nlead to such modification\u2014whether rational explanation, per-\nsuasion, or suggestion\u2014must be given their share of credit in\nregard to the therapeutic result.\nSo far we have been dealing with methods of treatment which\nare generally applicable to patients in the ordinary waking state.\nBut these methods may also be used in conjunction with the\nartificial induction of more or less profound alterations of con-\nsciousness. Moreover, it is maintained by some observers that\nnot only is the analysis of the mental state rendered easier by\nthe presence of these alterations of consciousness, but also that\nthe necessary therapeutic measures are thereby more easily and\nmore effectively applied. In the practice of hypnotic suggestion\nit has been observed that patients are sometimes amenable to\ncurative suggestions when no objective signs of hypnosis can be\ndiscovered. And although response to suggestion in these cases\n\fLXI.] Review. 679\nis generally obtained only after some preliminary hypnotic process\nhas been employed, or when the suggestions are given in par-\nticular ways or under peculiar circumstances, it is not uncommon\nto have the results recorded as being due to suggestion in the\nwaking state. The assumptions made are that since no signs of\nhypnosis can be detected, or since no formal hypnotic procedure\nhas been attempted, the patient is not hypnotised ; and that if\nhe is not hypnotised he must necessarily be in the ordinary\nwaking state. All these assumptions may be false. Using the\nterm hypnosis in the elastic sense in which it has been used in\nmodern writings, we may say legitimately enough that there\nmay be a first stage or degree of hypnosis, the existence of which\nis only shown by response to certain therapeutic suggestions\nfurther, a true hypnosis may be induced without any deliberate\nor formal attempt to hj^pnotise ; and finally, we have no reason\nto suppose that no intermediate state of consciousness may occur\nbetween the normal waking state and definite hypnosis. The\nexistence of such an intermediate state characterised by\nincreased suggestibility has been suspected by some observers,\nbut until comparatively recently little evidence has been forth-\ncoming in support of their opinion. During the last thirteen\nyears, however, Dr. Boris Sidis of Brookline has brought forward\na considerable amount of evidence pointing to the existence of\nsuch a state, and has furnished some definite data in regard to\nits peculiar characteristics. A summary of his researches and\nhis most important conclusions are given by Dr. Sidis in his\ncontribution to the Symposium entitled The Psychotherapeutic\nValue of the Hypnoidal State.\nIn his earlier studies on the Psychology of Suggestion, Sidis\nfound that any arrangement tending to produce monotony and\nlimitation of voluntary activity brings about a state of suggesti-\nbility termed by him suhwaking or hypnoidal, a state in which\nmental life can be affected with ease. \"The subwaking or\nhypnoidal state is essentially an intermediate state belonging to\nthe borderland of mental life. On the one hand the hypnoidal\nstate closely touches on the waking state, on the other it merges\ninto hypnosis and sleep. A close study of the subwaking state\nshows that it differs from the hypnotic state proper, and that it\ncannot be identified with light hyj^nosis.\"\nIn the course of a valuable experimental study of sleep in\nthe lower animals and in man Sidis found that the hypnoidal\n\fC80 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nstate becomes a more prominent feature in connection with bodily\nrest and recuperation the farther we descend in the scale of\nanimal life. Indeed he concludes that the hypnoidal state is the\nprimitive rest state out of which both sleeji and hypnosis have\nbeen evolved.\nThe hypnoidal state is on the borderland of waking, sleep,\nand hypnosis. It is a phase of consciousness which must be passed\nthrough in every transition from one of these states to another.\nIn passing from the waking state into ordinary sleep, or from\nsleep to waking ; from waking to hypnosis, or from hypnosis to\nwaking ; from hypnosis to sleep, or from sleep to hypnosis, we\npass through a hypnoidal state of longer or shorter duration.\nThe state is very unstable, and varies greatly as regards its\ndepth. Sometimes it passes into sleep, sometimes into a true\nhypnosis. In its deeper stages the j^fitient hovers between sleep\nand hypnosis.\nThe spontaneous occiirrence of the hypnoidal state in man is,\nas a rule, merely a transitory stage in the alternation of waking\nand sleep, but its artificial induction may be very easily accom-\nplished. There is nothing rigid about the method of doing so;\nit admits of many modifications. \"The jarincipal object consists\nin bringing about the conditions of monotony and limitation of\nvoluntary movements requisite for normal and abnormal suggesti-\nbility. The patient is put in a relaxed, recumbent position; he\nis asked to put himself in as comfortable a position as possible,\nclose his eyes, and attend to some monotonous stimulus such as\nthe regular beats of a metronome or the buzzing of an induc-\ntorium. . . . When respiration and jDulse become reduced,\nsensory-motor reaction diminished, sensory hypoesthesia becoming\noccasionally hyperesthesia, with occasional disturbances of pulse\nand resjoiration, with sudden apparently unaccountable starts,\nwith tendencies of retention of position of limbs, and now and\nthen with a slight tendency to resist actively any change of\nposition of limbs or of body without the actual presence of\ncatalepsy, the whole feeling tone becoming one of acquiescence\nand indifference, while memory with amnesic gaps begins to find\nthe lost links, and even to become hypermnesic\u2014when we observe\nall those symptoms we know we have before us the subconscious\nhypnoidal state.\"\nIn the hypnoidal state there is a surging up of subconscious\nmemories, and this peculiarity makes it a valuable instrument\n\flxl] Review. 681\nin tracing the origin of the symptoms of psychopathic maladies.\nBut Sidis does not claim for it in this respect any therapeutic\nvalue. He thinks that the information gained by the patient in\nthis way as to the origin of his troubles is valuable \"only in\nso far as by a systematic course of direct and indirect suggestion,\nby mediate associative and immediate associative suggestion, by\nsubstitution, disintegration, and synthesis, both in the waking\nand hypnoidal states, we help to transform the associative course\nand emotional tone of the patient's mental life.\"\nThe practical value of the hypnoidal state lies chiefly in its\ntherapeutic possibilities. Being a state in which the patient is\namenable to suggestion, many of the advantages of the hypnotic\nstate may be obtained withotit the necessity of inducing hypnosis.\nBut apart from its affording an easily induced state characterised\nby suggestibility, Sidis claims for it therajDeutic virtues of a\nunique kind. He maintains that the main therapeutic value of\nthe hypnoidal state consists in the liberation of reserve energy\npotential in the nervous system, and the synthesis of dissociated\ncomplexes which is thereby brought about.\nThe principle of reserve energy is based upon a broad generali-\nsation of facts, namely, that far less energy is utilised by the\nindividual than is actually at his disposal. In the struggle for\nexistence the importance of a reserve of energy which can be\ndrawn upon in emergencies is very great, and the accumulation\nof such a store of energy is a feature of the evolutionary process\nin all highly specialised organisms. The most important factor\nconducing to a reserve of potential energy is the increase of\ninhibitions that accompanies the growth in complexity which\ncharacterises the evolution of the nervous system. Unrestrained\nreaction to the multitude of stimuli to which highly differentiated\norganisms are exposed would be extremely wasteful, and successful\nadaptation to a complex environment is invariably found to be\naccompanied by an increase of nervous inhibitions. The thres-\nholds of stimulation of a complex system rise in proportion to\nits complexity, and with the rise of thresholds energy, which\nwould otherwise have been imnecessarily expended, becomes locked\nujD in the nervous system for future use.\nA high degree of inhibition is a characteristic of all civilised\nraces, but occasionally in the life of the individual the inhibitory\ntendency becomes too intense, and by interfering with normal\nand necessary reactions has a disastrous effect on the personality.\n\f682 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nA whole system or complex may thus be rendered inactive and\ncut off from the personal life, and the dissociated complex and\nits stored energy are rendered useless in the adjustment of the\nindividual to his environment. By removing the inhibitions\naccess is gained to the dormant energy of the inhibited systems,\nand the energy so released helps towards their reintegration and\nsynthesis. Now Sidis claims that the hypnoidal state \"helps us\nto reach the inaccessible regions of dormant energy, it helps to\nbreak down inhibitions, liberate reserve energies, and repair the\nbreaches of mental activity. The painful systems become dis-\nsociated, disintegrated, and again transformed, reformed, and\nreintegrated into new systems full of energy, and joy, and life.\"\nIn the course of his experience Dr. Sidis seems to have modified\nhis opinions in some ways regarding the nature and importance\nof the hypnoidal state. In his earlier writings little stress was\nlaid on the employment of hyjDnoidisation as a means of unlocking\nthe reserve energy of the nervous system. It was rather as a\njarocedure that induced a state in which suggestion was effective\nand in which forgotten memories could be recovered that it was\nrecommended. And there can be no doubt that in these respects\nit is a very valuable measure in the diagnosis and treatment of\nthe psycho-neuroses. In my own experience I have found it\ninferior to hypnosis in both of these resjDects, but of very definite\nvalue when for any reason hypnosis cannot be induced. In regard\nalso to the liberation of reserve energy the hypnotic state should\nbe more useful than the hyiDUoidal. For in the hypnoidal state\nthere is merely a fluctuation and redistribution of thresholds,\nwhilst in hypnosis there is a general lowering of thresholds and\na consequent removal of inhibitions that tend to block the free\ncirculation of the energy of dissociated systems. Indeed the\nprinciple of dormant reserve energy and its liberation in the\ncourse of successful treatment must be applicable to almost every\npsychotherapeutic method ; for in whatever way the reintegration\nof inhibited systems may be brought about, the energy so liberated\nmust go to swell the total amount of energy available and assist\nin the re-establishment of normal associations.\nAlthough I can endorse from my own experience the usefulness\nof the method of hypnoidisation advocated by Sidis, and although\nI think it is well to distinguish by a special name the inter-\nmediary state which is to be observed between waking and\nhypnosis, it seems to me doubtful whether the hypnoidal state\n\flxl] Review. 683\ncan be regarded as a state of consciousness clearly marked off\nfrom light hypnosis. Sidis admits that it is a very unstable\ncondition, sometimes differing hardly at all from the waking\nstate, sometimes deepening into definite hypnosis : and it seems\nprobable that its therapeutic value may be due to the hypnotic\nelement, which is almost invariably present in greater or less\ndegree. In discussing this matter we are of course hampered by\nthe absence of any recognised definition of hypnosis and of any\ndistinguishing feature which will enable us in every case to\ndifferentiate the hyjjnotic state from other states of conscious-\nness. In the deeper degrees of hypnosis the peculiarities of the\nstate are clearly marked off from the phenomena observable in\nwaking life, but as we approach the lighter stages it becomes\nmore and more difficult to say in what hypnosis really consists.\nIn Bernheim's hands hypnosis disappears altogether, and nothing\nis left but suggestibility, or, at most, increased suggestibility\nnormal suggestibility becomes increased suggestibility by means\nof suggestion. But although it is commonly held that some people\nare responsive to direct suggestion in the waking state, there\nare good grounds for holding that such resjDonsiveness is always\npreceded by some change in consciousness of the nature of what\nin its more marked stages we know as hypnosis. This applies\nwhether the preliminary change in consciousness occurs spon-\ntaneously or is artificially produced ; and in either case the\nobservable departure from normal waking may be so slight that\nwe are tempted to think that we have to do with effective\nsuggestion in the waking state. On the other hand, the change\nfrom ordinary waking may be apparent while none of the\nrecognised peculiarities of definite hypnosis are to be found, so\nthat we may be led to believe that we are dealing with a phase\nof consciousness which is neither the waking state nor hypnosis.\nThe hypnoidal state described by Sidis seems to include all the\nstages which lie between the waking state and definite hypnosis,\nand in view of the difficulty of saying where waking ends and\nhypnosis begins it is convenient and desirable to have some term\nwhich will cover this ill-defined territory.\nAs I have already said, some men who formerly used hypnotism\nin the practice of treatment by suggestion now maintain that\nthe \"sleep\" is unnecessary, and they teach that suggestion\nwithout hypnosis is equally efficacious. The most distinguished\nexponent of this view in this country is Dr. Milne Bramwell,\n\f684- T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nwho after many years of remarkable success as a hypnotist has\npractically given up attempting to hypnotise his patients. Yet\nhe tells us his results have in no way suffered, and he naturally\nregards the induction of hypnosis as simply a waste of time.\nIn view of the admittedly greater susceptibility to suggestion\nwhich characterises hypnosis as compared with that of the waking\nstate, and in view of the doubts expressed by many observers\nas to the possibility of getting response to direct suggestion in\nnormal life without some prior change in consciousness, it is\ninteresting to examine Dr. Bramwell's method of giving the\nsuggestions which prove so efficacious.\nDr. Bramwell asks the patient to sit in a comfortable arm\nchair, close his eyes, and concentrate his attention on some\nrestful mental picture. While the patient rests thus Dr. Bramwell\nquietly and monotonously makes suggestions which the patient\nis not supposed to attend to. The hypothesis on which the\nmethod is based is that we have a secondary consciousness which\npossesses powers over the organism greater than those of the\nordinary one, and that if the primary consciousness is absorbed\nin some restful train of thought the suggestions more easily\nreach the secondary one and call its powers into play. It is the\nrepetition of the impression made in this particular way which\ngives it its j^ower. Dr. Bramwell tells the patient beforehand\nthat he does not wish him to go to sleep, but that if he can get\ninto the drowsy condition which precedes normal sleep the\ncurative suggestions are likely to be responded to more quickly.\nIn describing the condition brought about by these methods. Dr.\nBramwell says the patient \" often passes into a drowsy, day-dreamy\nstate. Sometimes the condition becomes one of slight natural\nsleep ; the patient ceases to hear my voice, and loses conscious-\nness for a moment or two, then drifts back to consciousness\nagain.\"\nBefore giving systematised suggestions to his patients in this\nway, Dr. Bramwell always studies their m^ental condition in\nreference to their symptoms. When these are all of nervous\norigin he carefully explains, step by step, how they have arisen\nand have been maintained by morbid self-suggestion, and that\nthe remedy lies in re-education and the development of will\npower and self-control. But while this appeal to the patient's\nintelligence is often helpful, it is not the most important part\n'Bramwell, Hypnotism and Treatment hy Suggestion (1909), p. 168.\n\fLXI.] Review. 685\nof the treatment. The essential thing is the systematised sugges-\ntions under the conditions described.\nIn the method of Dr. Bramwell we find all the conditions\nwhich Sidis desiderates for the production of the hypnoidal state.\nThere is monotony and restriction of voluntary movement. The\nmonotonous repetition of suggestions v\/ill have an effect similar\nto that produced by the beats of a metronome or the buzzing\nof an inductorium, and increased suggestibility will be brought\nabout, not altogether by the content of the suggested ideas, but\npartly by the manner in which they are presented. In the state\nof consciousness produced by this method of giving suggestions,\nwe see the same instability and variableness which Sidis tells\nus characterises the hypnoidal state, and it would seem as if\nDr. Bramwell really treats his patients by hypnoidisation, com-\nbined with suggestion given in a joarticular way. Monotonous\nreiteration of the curative suggestions is a characteristic feature\nof the method, and the efficacy of this may be correlated with\nwhat we know of the importance of repetition in the formation\nand conservation of new mental complexes.\nIt will probably be found that all successful therapeutic\nsuggestion without hypnosis, where direct verbal suggestion has\nbeen employed, is to be explained by the production of the\nhypnoidal state ; for we have no evidence at present that direct\nverbal suggestion in the normal waking state can produce the\nmental and physiological changes which are implied in the cure\nof mental and physiological disorders. Indirect suggestion is\nanother matter, and its elusiveness is one of our main difficulties\nin estimating the value of any form of treatment whatsoever\nbut we are probably right in supporting the view put forward\nby Sidis in his study of the Psychology of Suggestion, that in\nthe waking state suggestion is least effective when most direct,\nand most effective when least direct.\nThe different methods of psychotherapy which I have described\nare all developments which have arisen out of the study of\nhypnotic suggestion, and it is as a rule the expressed purpose\nof their originators to offer them as substitutes for and improve-\nments on the older method. But although their superiority may\nbe admitted under certain circumstances or in the treatment of\nparticular morbid states, it is doubtful if any of them by itself,\nor all of them combined, will ever take the place of suggestion\nduring hypnosis as a widely applicable therapeutic measure.\n\f686 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nYet each is of value in its own way. Simple explanation and\nre-education is and always has been an important feature in\nevery form of psychotherapy.

By Frank Podmore. (Methuen & Co., London, 1909.\nPp. 306. Price, 10s. 6d. net.)\nIn setting out to write a short history of mental healing, Mr.\nPodmore may well have been embarrassed by the amount of\nmaterial at his disposal, and he must have had difficulty in\ndeciding where to begin and where to end. For the beginnings\nof mental healing must be looked for in the opening chapters\nof man's history, its persistence through the ages may be dis-\ncovered in the records of all peojjles, its development in our own\ntime has taken place along widely diverging paths, and in no\ndirection can it be said that the end has yet come. Instead of\nbeginning with Mesmerism, which was really the first attempt\nat rationalising the mystical practices of former generations, he\nmight have traced these practices to their roots in the super-\nstitions of barbarism or in the magical rites of early civilisations.\nInstead of ending with Christian Science, which seems the final\nabandonment of reason in the interpretation of the results\nobtained by mental healing, he might have traced the vicissitudes\nof hypnotism since the days of Braid and brought his story to a\nclose with an account of the psychotherapeutic methods of the\npresent day. We are told in the preface that \"the aim of the\npresent work is briefly to describe the various phases of the\nmovement initiated by Mesmer, and to trace the successive\nattempts made by those who came after him to get below the\nsurface to the underlying reality.\"\nIt cannot be Mr. Podmore's intention to imply that after a\nhundred years of striving to get below the surface to the under-\n\f688 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nlying reality the att-empt must be abandoned, or that all the\nphases of the movement initiated by Mesmer culminate in the\ndoctrines and practice of Mrs. Eddy. Yet there is no break in\nthe story from Mesmerism to Christian Science just as there is\nno real discontinuity between Mesmerism and the psychic treat-\nment of orthodox physicians at the present time. With the rise\nof Mesmerism two lines of thought which had existed for hundreds\nof years, at first inextricably mingled, then side by side, came\nonce more for a time into contact with each other. At the\nclose of the Mesmeric period these lines again diverged, there\nwas a parting of the ways, and it is along only one of these\nways that Mr. Podmore leads us.\nFor a long time after the Renaissance the practice of the art\nof healing displayed a curious blend of occultism and empiricism.\nNatural remedies were eagerly sought after and employed with\neffect in the treatment of disease, yet the virtues of medicaments\nwere almost universally believed to depend on the due performance\nof magical rites. The desire for natural explanations was frus-\ntrated by the uncertainty of the results, and such definite\ntherapeutic effects as were obtained seemed to receive their most\nreasonable interpretation in the doctrines of Hermetic Science.\nWith the dawn of the scientific era an ever widening gulf\ndeveloped between occultism and physical jDhilosophy, and towards\nthe close of the eighteenth century a mystical explanation of\nany natural phenomenon was as little likely to obtain credence\nas it would be at the present day. Yet about this time certain\nteachings of the mystical writers of an earlier period were forced\nupon the attention of the scientific world by the work of Mesmer.\nAnd although Mesmer failed to convince his scientific contem-\nporaries of the truth of his doctrines, or even of the genuineness\nof the phenomena on which he based his claim to be heard, he\nwas without doubt the means of bringing under the scrutiny of\nscience certain facts of nature which in the Age of Reason were\nonly too likely to be neglected and forgotten. Mr. Podmore\nsays that\n'\n' Mesmer's first claim to our remembrance lies in\nthis\u2014that he wrested the privilege of healing from the Churches,\nand gave it to mankind as a general possession.\" But if Christian\nScience were to be regarded as the sole outcome of the movement\ninitiated by Mesmer, it would seem as if his work had been in\nvain. Rather should we say that Mesmer's first claim to our\nremembrance lies in this\u2014that he compelled scientific men to\n\fRevieiv. 689\ninvestigate a class of natural phenomena whose very existence\nthey vk^oulcl fain have denied.\nMr. Podmore dismisses in a few pages the scientific work that\nhas been done in connection with this subject since the close of\nthe Mesmeric period. It is no part of his plan to record the\nhistory of Hypnotism which is, he says, \"only the youngest and\nat present by no means the most prominent of the progeny of\nMesmer.\" His purpose rather is to trace the pedigree of\nChristian Science and allied schools of thought from their roots\nin \"that universal system of knowledge whose boast it was to\nunite two well known sciences\u2014Astronomy and Medicine.\" And\nin doing so he has given us a most fascinating work. The\nfullness of knowledge which he shows in regard to every stage\nin the development of his story marks him out as peculiarly\nfitted for the task, while the impartiality of judgment and the\ncritical acumen which he brings to bear on all the subjects dealt\nwith are in striking contrast with the mental attitude of most\nwriters who have dealt with these matters in the past.\nThe first half of the book is devoted to the history of Animal\nMagnetism, and it is doubtful if there exists in any language\nso complete and yet so succinct an account of that extraordinary\nmovement. The book opens with a short description of Mesmer's\nearly life and studies, followed by a rapid survey of the main\nincidents which attended his first appearance in Pai'is in 1778.\nHis methods are described, and a record of some of the cases\nof cure by Animal Magnetism is given. Before proceeding to\ntreat of Mesmer's later life and the recejotion which he met with\nat the hands of the medical faculty and scientific authorities\ngenerally, Mr. Podmore shows how Mesmer derived his methods\nand his doctrines from the faith healers and the mystical\nphilosophers of a former generation.\nMany features of Mesmer's practice at the beginning of his\ncareer may be found in the methods employed by Valentine\nGreatrakes and Gassner, and the philosophical doctrines sum-\nmarised in the famous twenty-seven jDropositions are implicitly\ncontained in the writings of Paracelsus, Van Helmont, Fludd,\nand Maxwell. \"To Van Helmont the Magnetic system is still\npi'imarily a spiritual affair, a link between the heavens and the\nearth. Man can only obtain a complete mastery over the powers\nwhich sleep in his own nature by assimilating his will to the\nDivine Will. In the writings of Maxwell and Fludd greater\n\f690 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nstress is laid upon the material operations of the fluid ; the\ntheory tends to become less mystical and more scientific. . . .\nBut in Mesmer's exposition this sjoiritual aspect of the doctrine\nhas entirely disappeared. For him the Magnetic system is purely\na question of matter and motion.\"\nSuch at all events was the claim put forward by Mesmer in\nthe paper which he presented to the Academy of Sciences in\n1778. It was as a physicist rather than as a physician that he\nasked to be recognised. It was not so much a new method of\ntreating disease, but a new physical force which he claimed to\nhave discovered. But apart from cases of alleged cure of disease,\nthe only evidence he could bring forward in supjDort of his\ncontention was the subjective sensations of those operated upon.\n\"When Leroy and his colleagues undertook to explain all these\nsensations as due simply to imagination, Mesmer was confounded.\nHe forgot his resolve not to leave his great discovery to the\nuncertain arbitrament of the consulting room, his reluctance to\nembroil himself with the medical faculty, and he decided against\nhis better judgment to offer the proofs demanded of him.\"\nThen followed the long series of abortive attempts to have\nMesmer's claims investigated by the learned Societies of Paris,\nculminating finally in the appointment by the Government of\ntwo commissions, one chosen from the Faculty of Medicine and\nthe Academy of Sciences, and one from the Royal Society of\nMedicine. The reports of both commissions were unfavourable\nto the claims of the Animal Magnetists. The commissioners\nappointed by the Faculty of Medicine contented themselves with\nshowing that there was no proof of the existence of Mesmer's\npostulated fluid, and since the fluid did not exist they thought\nthere was no need to inquire into its utility. This Report,\ndrawn up with great skill by Bailly, was signed on the eleventh\nof August, and as Mr. Podmore says in his preface, this date\n\"should be observed as a day of humiliation by every learned\nSociety in the civilised world, for on that date in 1784 a Com-\nmission, consisting of the most distinguished representatives of\nScience in the most enlightened cajDital in Europe, pronounced\nthe rejection of a pregnant scientific discovery\u2014a discovery\npossibly rivalling in permanent significance all the contributions\nto the physical Sciences made by the two most famous members\nof the Commission\u2014Lavoisier and Benjamin Franklin.\"\nThe Report of the Royal Society Commission was to the same\n\fLXI.] Review. 691\neffect, although one of its members, Jussieu, issued a separate\nReport on his own account, in which he showed himself to be\na better obsei-ver than his colleagues. But Jussieu's Report had\nas little effect on his scientific contemporaries as the Report of\nBailly's Commission had on the wider public who were interested\nin Animal Magnetism, and the movement continued to sjjread\nup to the time of the Revolution.\nThe most important names connected with this period are\nthose of Puysegur, Petetin, and Deleuze, and Mr. Podmore\ngives an adequate account of the work of these three men. The\ndiscovery of Somnambulism by Puysegur marks an important\nstage in the history of the subject, and in his belief in the\ninfluence of the will in directing and controlling the magnetic\nfluid we may recognise the growing tendency towards the inclusion\nof the human element in the interpretation of Mesmeric phe-\nnomena and so towards what we regard as the true explanation.\nWith the outbreak of the Revolution the progress of Animal\nMagnetism almost stopped, but after the Restoration it reap-\npeared and flourished more vigorously than ever. So widespread\ndid its practice become that in 1825 it was again brought before\nthe Academy of Medicine, and a Committee of investigation\nwas appointed in February of the following year. The Report\nof this Commission, prepared by Husson and delivered in 1831,\nwas as indiscriminately favourable to the claims of the Animal\nMagnetists as Bailly's Report had been unfavourable. But\nalthough the Commissioners were men of scientific standing,\ntheir favourable judgment had but little influence on the medical\nprofession, and did nothing to alter its resolute determination\nto have nothing to do with Animal Magnetism. The attitude\nof the official medical world may be judged from the sjDlenetic\nwork of Burdin and Dubois. In their Histoire Academique du\nMagnetisme Animcd, published ten years after the issue of\nHusson's Report, these authors poured out their contempt on\neverything and everybody connected with the subject. So blinded\nby prejudice were they that they could see nothing of truth or\nof value in any part of the story from Mesmer to Teste.\nThe final abandonment of Animal Magnetism by the medical\nfaculty in France came about through the repeated discovery\nof fraud in connection with the Magnetists' attempts to demon-\nstrate the reality of clairvoyance by their magnetised subjects.\nAs so often happens in research on matters of this kind, the\n\f692 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ndiscovery of fraud was held to justify the investigators in dis-\njjensing with further inquiry into related jjhenoniena in which\nfraud had not been discovered.\nIt was in the period following the Restoration that Alexander\nBertrand lectured and wrote on Animal Magnetism, and although\nhis work had but little effect on his contemporaries, it may\nnow be recognised that he alone of all the medical men of that\ntime succeeded in distinguishing in some measure between the\nfalse and the true in Animal Magnetism. It is surprising how\nmodern much of Bertrand's writing appears, and it was perhaps\ninevitable that the importance of his views should have been\nmissed by his contemporaries and by later writers. His work\nhas hardly yet had justice done to it, and it is gratifying to\nfind that Mr. Podmore has clone something to restore to its\nproper place in the history of the subject the name of one of\nthe most careful observers in the annals of Animal Magnetism.\nThere was in Paris about this time another Magnetist, to\nwhose merit Mr. Podmore hardly, perhaps, does justice. The\nAbbe Faria was one of the most successful operators of his day,\nand his doctrine of Suggestion as the cause of the Mesmeric\nstate and its associated phenomena is more modern even than\nthat of Bertrand. The name of Faria is of particular interest\nto us in this country, for it was he who taught Richard Chenevix\nto magnetise, and it was Chenevix who introduced Elliotson to\nthe study of Mesmerism. If Elliotson had only paid some regard\nto the teachings of Faria, the story of Mesmerism in England\nmight have been very different, and we might have been spared\nthe most deplorable chapter in the annals of British Medicine.\nMr. Podmore brings his history of Animal Magnetism to a\nclose with an admirable chapter, in which he recounts the main\nincidents of the struggle with official medical science in this\ncountry. As he well says, \"The intolerance of the medical\nprofession from 1839 onwards to Mesmerism, and especially its\nobstinate rejection of the cumulative evidence of the relief from\npain occasionally afforded by its means in surgical operations,\nis one of the most noteworthy episodes in the history of medical\nscience.\" But recognition of the reality of some of the facts\nof Mesmerism and some insight into their probable explanation\nmust surely have followed the work of Braid had it not been\nfor the discovery of chloroform and the rise of modern\nSpiritualism. To the few unprejudiced medical men who were\n\fLXI.] Review. 693\ninclined to look with favour on the practice of Mesmerism, the\nhope that it might become of use in surgical work was the main\nincentive to its study, and the introduction of an anaesthetic,\nwhich was found to act with certainty in all cases, seemed to\ndeprive the less reliable method of the Mesmerists of all utility.\nThe effect of the rise of Spiritualism on the progress of Animal\nMagnetism is well told by Mr. Podmore. \"When table-turning\nand spirit-rapping were introduced into this country from\nAmerica, the Mesmerists soon identified the mysterious force\nwhich caused the jDhenomena with the mesmeric or neuro-vital\nfluid. A little later, when the trance and its manifestations\nwere exploited in the interests of the new gospel of Spiritualism,\nmany of the English Mesmerists, v\/ho had been j^^'eparecl by\nthe utterances of their own clairvoyants for some such develop-\nment, proclaimed themselves adherents of the new faith. Elliotson\nhimself before his death became a convert to Spiritualism. The\nMesmerists generally found the marvels of the magnetic fluid\ninsignificant in face of the new revelation. Mesmeric operators\nbecame spiritual healers, and their subjects trance mediums ; the\nspiritualist platforms were thronged with magnetic clairvoyants\nwho had developed into '\ninspirational ' speakers. The two\nmovements naturally became identified in the minds of the\npublic, and shared in a common condemnation. No physician\nwho valued his professional reputation could afford to meddle\nwith the subject, and the study of the induced trance and its\nattendant phenomena was relegated to oblivion, in these islands\nat any rate, for more than a generation.\"\nBut the cessation of scientific interest in Mesmerism did not\nstop the development of the movement, and the outcome of this\ndevelopment is not to be measured by the amount of scientific\nwork that has been done in this connection since the days of\nBraid, or by the conclusions that have been arrived at in the\ncourse of the rise of modern psychotherapy as practised by more\nor less orthodox physicians. As Mr. Podmore says, \"The\ndeliberate negligence of the scientific world left the whole field\nto be cultivated by the visionary and the charlatan. The\nabundant crop of false beliefs and extravagant systems which\nflourish at the jDreseut time is the direct result of the apathy\nor obstinate incredulity shown by the physicians of two generations\nago.\"\nAll the mysticisms and pseudo-sciences of the present day no\n\f694 T.

Mitchell, M.D. [PAKT\ndoubt owe something to Mesmer, but there are, as Mr. Podmore\nshows, three distinct schools of thought, each claiming a scientific\nfoundation, whose descent may be traced directly back to the\nsystem of knowledge on which Mesmer's work was based. \"The\nthree faiths in question are the fluidic theory, which finds its\nheadquarters, appropriately enough, in modern Paris ; the religion\nof Modern Spiritualism ; and the movement of Mental Healing,\nof which the sect known as Christian Scientists are the most\nprominent repi'esentatives.\" It is to tracing the connection\nbetween Mesmerism and these modern phases of thought that\nthe second half of Mr. Podmore's book is devoted.\nBelievers in Animal Magnetism had, in the face of all adverse\ncriticism, persistently clung to a belief in the existence of some\nform of fluid emanation which passed from the operator to the\nsubject in the process of magnetising, although they were often\nhard pressed to explain how the fluid operated in producing the\nso-called higher phenomena of Mesmerism. A welcome support\nto \u00a3heir belief was found in the experimental researches of\nReiclienbacli, and although counter experiments were made by\nBraid which jjointed the way to the true explanation, Reichen-\nbach's work exercised considerable influence in this country. But\nstill the higher phenomena called for some further explanation,\nand the growing wonders of clairvoyance recorded on all sides\nat this time gradually convinced the most orthodox of the\nfiuidists that in clairvoyance there was something which tran-\nscended all their physical interj^retations and compelled them to\nrevert to the mystical explanations of earlier times. Even\nDeleuze thought that the phenomena of somnambulism proved\nclearly the spiritual nature of the soul, and that the soul, \"though\nit generally makes use of the sense organs, can in certain states\nreceive ideas and sensations without the mediation of these\norgans.\" As Mr. Podmore says, \"If a man, gifted with such\nsobriety of judgment as Deleuze, could write in that strain, it\nis not to be wondered at that less cautious students should see\nin the magnetic trance an open door into the spiritual world.\"\nDuring the next few years their expectations seemed to be\nabundantly realised. Under the influence of the teachings of\nSwedenborg revelations of a spiritual world had formed a not\ninfrequent feature of magnetic or spontaneous trance, especially\nin Germany, from the beginning of the Mesmeric movement\nand at the time when Husson's Commission was investigating\n\fLXI.] Review. 695\nthe claims of the magnetists, Justinus Kerner was recording the\nsayings and doings of the Seeress of Prevorst. At a later date\nrevelations of a similar kind were given through Adele Maginot,\none of Cahagnet's somnambules, and other less notorious clair-\nvoyants, and the avidity with which such outpourings were\naccepted as authentic revelations from another world is an\nindication of the prevalence of the ideas and beliefs that made\npossible the rise of Modern SjDiritualism.\nThe insistence by the Mesmerists on the reality of clairvoyance\nwas always the chief stumbling block in the way of general\nrecognition of the truth tliat was in Mesmerism, and the clair-\nvoyant records of this period still give rise to our main difficulty\nwhen we endeavour to interpret the results which were claimed\nto have been obtained. Mr. Podmore devotes a chapter to the\nmore important of these records which is a model of scientific\ncaution. In summing up his discussion, he says \"the so-called\nclairvoyance at close quarters, when not due to fraud, would\nseem to indicate extreme acuteness of vision, the result sometimes\nof training, sometimes apjDarently of hyperaesthesia in the trance.\nBut the manifestations of community of sensation and of clair-\nvoyance at a distance, so far as they appear to be genuine,\nfurnish some support to the hyjDothesis of thought transference.\"\nBut he admits that there are a few cases \"which compel us at\nleast to enlarge the meaning of thought transference.\"\nThe final stage in the history of the movement initiated by\nMesmer is reached with the \" Coming of the Prophets.\" This\nis the title which Mr. Podmore gives to the chapter in which he\ndescribes the development of mental healing in America after\n1848. Prior to this date magnetic clairvoyants and spirit\nmediums laid claim to no special sanctity, they arrogated to\nthemselves no spiritual authority. \"But in the land of\ndemocracy we are confronted with a singular development un-\nknown to the older monarchies. The transatlantic seers constantly\ntend to be independent ; they assume the authority of the\nprophet ;\nthey grasp at a spiritual autocracy\u2014an autocracy by\nno means confined to the spiritual concerns of those subject to it.\"\nThis tendency was prominently shown in the careers of Andrew\nJackson Davis and Thomas Lake Harris, but the supreme\nexample of it is to be found in the person of Mrs. Eddy, the\nfounder of Christian Science.\nAlthough Davis at the beginning of his career essayed to\n\f696 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ndiagnose and treat disease when in trance, both he and Harris\nare chiefly noteworthy, in connection with mental healing, for\nthe systems of philosophy which were founded on the contents\nof their automatic writings. For in their scheme of things the\nunreality of disease and its conquest by spiritual regeneration\nare first clearly insisted on, and this revelation of divine truth\nbecomes later the foundation stone of the doctrines of Christian\nScience. But of more immediate importance in the development\nof Mrs. Eddy's opinions regarding the nature and treatment of\ndisease was the teaching of Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. After\nstarting his healing career as a professional mesmerist Quimby\ncame to the conclusion that the cures which he effected must really\nhave been due to faith and expectation on the part of the\npatients. He became convinced that all disease is a delusion,\nan error of the mind, and, discarding Mesmerism, he set himself\nto cure diseased bodies by ministering to sick souls. In doing so\nhe appealed exclusively to the understanding of his patients, and\nit is interesting to observe that this mode of psychic treatment\nhas been rediscovered within recent years by orthodox physicians\nwho believe that all that has hitherto been achieved by sugges-\ntion may be as certainly and more reasonably attained by\npersuasion. The descrijotion of Quimby's procedure, quoted by\nMr. Podmore from Mrs. Julius Dresser, might have been writt-en\nyesterday by a patient of Dubois or of Dejerine :\n\"... instead\nof telling me that I was not sick, he sat beside me and explained\nto me all that my sickness was, how I got into the condition, and\nthe way I could have been taken out of it by the right under-\nstanding. ... I felt the spirit and life that came with his\nwords, and I found myself gaining steadily.\"\nBut although Quimby may be regarded as the founder of the\nmodern movement of Mental Healing and the original source of\nall that is most characteristic in the doctrine and practice of the\nChristian Scientists, he is not the only link between the past and\nthe present. The various phases of the New Thought movement\nhave also had some influence in shaping the form which the\ndevelopment of Quimby's teaching was ultimately to take. While\nQuimby in his reliance on appeal to the reason in the treatment\nof disease showed himself to be a modern of the moderns, the\nmind-curers generally tended to revert to the old view of the\nAnimal Magnetists in believing in some specific action of the\noperator on the subject. A patient may, they say, be healed\n\fLXI.] Review. 697\nwithout his consent and even without his knowledge, so that\n\"absent\" treatment is as efficacious as treatment when healer\nand patient sit and converse in the same room. But in a wicked\nworld such a power may be used in injurious ways, and we have\nin Mrs. Eddy's denunciations of Malicious Animal Magnetism an\nindication of the terror that may be inspired by such a reversion\nto belief in the bewitchments of ancient Magic.\nNotwithstanding all the vagaries and strange philosophies of\nthe Mind Healers and Christian Scientists, notwithstanding the\nremoteness of their mental outlook from that of ordinary men\nand women, there is one matter connected with their teaching\nwhich must interest every one. Do they really cure disease?\nMr. Podmore says, as does every unbiassed person who has taken\nthe trouble to investigate the facts, that they unquestiona\"bly do.\nThere are no good grounds for doubting the testimony of\nthousands of honest people who describe the relief from suffering\nand the mental and bodily vigour which have come to them with\ntheir acceptance of Christian Science as the true gospel. But\nwhen we are asked for the explanation of these extraordinary\nstories our only answer is \"suggestion.\" That is as far as science\nauthorises us to go, and there for the present the matter must\nrest. But in reading Mr. Podmore's story from Mesmer to Mrs.\nEddy, we cannot help speculating on the evolutionary significance\nof the movement and the bearing which the growth of this phase\nof thought may have on man's life and destiny in the future.\nNor can we help feeling that behind all the extravagances of\nAnimal Magnetism, behind all the futilities of Christian Science,\nthere lies some profound truth which we have not as yet even\ndimly comprehended.\nT.
