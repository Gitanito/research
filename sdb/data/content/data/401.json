Early in the\nsummer of 1849, I happened, with my family, to attend a. lecture on\nmesmerism, as-applied to the art of healing, given in the Town 1Lill by a\nMr. Beattie. There were, as usual on such occasions, very curious and\nwonderful phenomena. exhibited, and there was also a good deal of incre-\ndulity expressed by some of the audience; for we are speaking now of\n34 years ago, and people's minds were as yet unaccustomed. to such\nwonders. What struck me most, however, was the lecturer's repeated\nassurance that he did not ask us to belien him. \"Go,\" he said, \"and\nDigitized by Google\n\f134 Jot\/rnal of Society .101' P8ychical Re&eal'cl,. [Sept., 1884.\n-----\nmake the experiment for yourselves. Most of you, if you tried fairly\nand without prejudice, could produce effects that would astonish your-\nselves.\"\nI was a girl fresh from school, where we had been encouraged to\ntake an interest in experimental science. I did not know much, but I\nhad learned enough to feel sure there was lOuch still to be discovered\nand learned in the world, and what could be fairer than the lecturer's\nchallenge 1 Moreover, I had a near relation suffering from epilepsy, and\nthough this, we were warned, was a form of disease most difficult to\ntreat, the subjects of it being frequently unaffected by mesmerism, yet,\nas cures were sometimes effected, there could be no harm in the attempt,\nand if successful, the result would be worth any sacrifioo of time and\npatience.\nAccorcihtgly, with the consent of my parents, I determined to try ;\nand on the 11th June, 1849, the following entry appeared in my\ndiary :-\" Mr. Beattie called, and shewed me about mesmerism. He\nalso lent me a book.\" This book was a little volume called\" Mesmerism,\nand its Opponents,\" by the Rev. George Sandby, and two days later I\nprocured it for myself, and studied it diligently during a short absence\nfrom home, which occurred at this time.\nMeanwhile, on the 11th, and two following days, I made unsuc-\ncessful attempts on my patient E. Then followed the absence already\nmentioned, but on July 3rd I resumed my efforts and persevered in\nthem daily for nearly six weeks without success. On August 10th I\ndiscontinued them, and wrote for advice to Mr. Sandby. I presume that\nhis allSwer received on the 14th was discouraging, for I made no further\nattempt at that time.\nI was absent from home a good deal during that winter, 1849-50,\nand it is not till March of the latter year that the subject reappears in\nmy diary. On the 5th of that month there is an entry, the first of a\nlong series of similar ones, \"l\\fesmerised M. N. again.\" I concll1de\nthat the attempt having produced no very decided result, was not\nnoted, as I cannot find any allusion to it.\nMy experiment of the previous year on E. having f~iled so com-\npletely was a great discouragement to me, and I pondered the matter a\ngood deal, and debated during my absence whether it would ever be\nworth while to renew the attempt. .\nI cOllSidered, however, that one failure on my part should not be\nallowed to discredit entirely all the wonderful cures and phenomena of\nvarious kinds observed by others, and the words of the lecturer still\nsounded in my ears and urged me not to give up until I had made one\nmore attempt, under less unfavourable circumstances. I had not long\nreturnei home when I became acquainted with Miss M. N., who was a\nparishioner of my father's.\n\f'Sept., 1884.] Journal oj Society for P8ycltical Researcl,. 135\n. ,\nShe and her sister lived together on very small means, their circum-\nlItances having been much reduced at the time of the death of their\n:parents, and M. was dreadfully afBicted with a chronic kind of St.\nVitus' dance, besides other ailments.\nI visited her frequently, and as I looked on at her never-cea.sing\nmovement, her mouth and eyes twitching and her whole body jerking\nup and down from morning till night, to such an extent that she could\nnot even feed herself, it occurred to me that hers was a fitting subject\nfor mesmerism. What a boon would an hour or two of perfect rest be\nto such a person! At any rate, I would talk to her about it, and make\n~ nex.t attempt on her, if she would consent to my doing so.\nShe had become very foud of me during our intercourse, and I had\nno difficulty in persuading her to a.llow me to do anything I liked to\nher; but some of her friends objected at first, having a sort of idea that\nmesmerism was a \"black art,\" and not to be meddled with. My\nfather's opinion, however, as clergyman of the parish, and my own repu-\ntation as the clergyman's daughter, prevailed so far th~t I was allowed\nto proceed without active opposition. -\nAt this time I had no expectation of any marvellous results. I did\nhope that I might succeed in quieting her nerves and muscles, and\ngiving rest, if not sleep, for a few hours every day, and that this rest\nmight have a beneficial effect upon my patient's health. But though I\nexpected nothing, I was prepared for anything, i.e., I was fully im-\npressed with the necessity of keeping my own nerves quiet and un-\nmoved under any circumstances. I rather dreaded than hoped that\nthings might happen to \"astonish me ;\" but, if they did, I was pre-\npared to look at them with as much calmness and philosophy as I could\ncommand.\nI think it was on the secondocca.sion, that, viz., of March 5th,\nnoted in my journal, that I succeeded in inducing the mesmeric sleep,\na state at that time of perfect repose, not unlike natural sleep-except\nthat the muscles remained rigid enough to keep my patient sitting up-\nright leaning back in the chair. She showed no disposition to lie down.\nIn this condition I left her, at first with directions to her sister not\nto touch or disturb her until she awoke of herself, which she did in\nabout an hour.\nAs time went on, however, and the mesmeric influence gained\ngreater power over her, I found it better to stay with her for an hour\nor two and wake her before I left. Otherwise she seemed never to\nawake quite perfectly, but remained for some hours in a dreamy state\nafter the actual sleep had left her.\nI cannot recollect, however, exactly the time when this change w:l.8\nmade, but it must have been very early. in the course of seances, be-\nDigitized by Google\n\f136 Journal 0\/Society\/or P8ychical Re8earcn. .[Sept.,l8M.\ncause on the 13th, after a week in which I had visited her every day,\nI find, in addition to the usual entry, \"Mesmerised M. N.,\" the word\n\"Discoveries,\" and that my mother was present, so that I must then\nhave remained with her during the sleep.\nThe\" Discoveries\" and \"New Discoveries\" entered on the 14th,\nreferred to phenomena. which, happening to myself in this way, with\nevery possible guarantee for their perfect truth and reality, necessarily\nmade a great impression on all our minds. They were, it is true, only\nthe introduction to a series of much greater wonders, but, being the\nfirst, they surprised and startled us almost more than those which\ncame :;iter.\nThe first unusual appearance that presented itself was a sort of\nmagnetic attraction towards myself. I noticed that whenever I moved\nabout the room to fetch a book or my knitting, or perhaps to eat some\nbiscuits or sandwiches (for I often took m'[luncheon with me to save\ntime), her face turned towards me. I tried, by way of experiment, to\nget quite behind the chair on which she sat, with her eyes closed and\nquite still up to this time; but she shuflled about in her seat and made\nevery effort to turn round so as to face me. Presently her arm stretched\nitself out with a \u00b7mechanical kind of motion and pointed at me wherever\nI moved. About this time, too\"she began to talk.\nHer voice and manner of speaking when asleep were much more\nanimated and decided than when awake. Instead of a poor, weak,\n~valid kind of creature, she became quite a clever, aniniated talker.\nInstead of the humility and self-depreciation of her waking hours, she\nappeared quite pltlased with herself and confident in her own opinions.\nIt was very curious to watch her, with her eyes always shut, and her\nforehead rather pressed forward, as if that were the seat and medimn\nof both sight and understanding. Sometimes she nipped her brows and\na puzzled look came over her face, and then a bright smile seemed to\nshow that all was clear again. But this is rather anticipating, for at\n. first she spoke little and rather hesitatingly, except in answer to ques-\ntlollS which I soon began to put to her.\n\" Why do you point at me, Mary 1\"\nMary: \"0, I don't know, but I feel as if I wanted-wanted to gel;\nnear you. It is very funny, suc~ a funny feeling. r can't. help it.\nNow, you are not angry, are you 7\"\nThe last sentence she very often used with a deprecating air and\nvoice.\nMeanwhile the attraetion became stronger every day till it caused\nher to stand upright and walk after me; a thing she could not do when\nawake, and had not done for many months or even years.\nAll this, of course, interested me extremely, and my mother and\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept., 1884.] Journal of Societyfor Psychical Resea#\u00b7ch. 137\nfather occasionally went with me to see the marvels I reported, and\nsatisfy themselves of their reality. I thought, however, that all this\nwa.lking about and general excitement might not be so good for my\npatient. as a quieter rest would be. Besides, the clinging to me was\nrathertroublesome and difficult to arrange for, so when her attentions\nin this way became too pressing, I told her rather peremptorily to go\nback to her chair and sit down, which, with some difficulty and exertion,\nshe at last managed to do-sighing a little and begging me not to be\nangry with her, 80S she would do always what I wished if she possibly\ncould, but it was very hard, &C.\nAfter that I found that she would always obey any command I gave\nher; a.nd though I never tried her to that extent, I believeshe would have\nhopped on one leg if I had ordered her to do so.\nBy degrees, as time went on, I noticed that the attraction became\nfainter. I cannot now remember how much time elapsed before a new\nphase of the mesmeric statebegan to show itself. I noticedthatonthe30th\nMarch my father went with me \"to see the wonders I reported,\" and\non the 7th April the ~ance is marked 80S \"very successful,\" but I think\nthat both these entries must refer to the first phase, viz., the attraction\nalready described.\nIt was, however, about this time or a little later that after a few\nquiet uneventful days, 80S I W80S sitting at work or reading in the same\nroom with her, I observed that I)I1Y little movement of my hands or\nfeet was being repeated in a mechanical kind of way by my patient.\nAs I worked, her right hand went up and down as if using her needle.\nIf I moved my finger or thumb, hers moved too. If I -lifted my hand\nto my face hers attempted immediately to follow the motion; and she\nthen began also to 8oSSOCiate herself with me in her speech-\" This\nwork tires us very much, doesn't it, dear 7\"--or if I wagged my finger\nexperimentany and well out of her sight (supposing she could see),\nshe would say, \"WeIll 1 don't know why we shoulli make this poor\nfinger work so hard, wag, wag, it is quite laughable.\"\nThis sort of thing, which I shall call \"sympathy,\" went on for\nsome time, increasing in intensity 80S the \"attraction\" had done, and\nthen slowly dying out as before, till it gave place to new and still\nmore wonderful phenomena.\nThat is to say the mere outward mechanical expression of sympathy\nwore out; but all the succeeding phenomena. may be classed under the\nsame head. The influence only went deeper and affected by degrees\nmore important organs, the senses, and finally the brain itself.\nItwas some timein that summer that I was sitting or standing nearthe\nwindow of her room, eating the cake or sandwich or whatev.er my lunch\nconsisted of that day. \"M.\" W80S in the mesmeric sleep, but had been\nDigitized by Google\n\f138 Journal of Sock-tv for PIJyc!lical Research.

I\nlooked at her, and saw that she was apparently eating something very\nnice, munching away and enjoying the taste extremely.\n\" What have you got there, Mary 7\" I said.\n\" Oh! Why of course you know. We--we are eating our lunch,\nand it is very nice. We have got some cake to-da.y, and it is very\ngood.\"\n\"That is right; then we will have some more.\" So saying I went to\nthe little corner cupboard where I always deposited my luncheon and\ntook, not cake this time, but a piece of dry bread.\n\" Well, yes, bread is very good, but it is not so nice as the cake.\nWe must not be discontented; but there is plenty more cake-why\ndon't we eat it 1 Ah, I know,\" with a laugh of triumph, \"you think\nI can't taste it; but that is nonsense. Of course we eat together,\" and\nso on. I tried her in all kinds of ways, tasted salt, and then sugar,\nthen pepper, and did my best to puzzle her, but she never hesitated or\nmade a mistake. .\nI find in my journa.l various entries during this summer, showing\nthe names of several persons who witnessed the facts I am relating.\nAmongst them, on May 21st, is that of Dr. H., a local celebrity,\nwho lived next door to us, and was an intimate friend of my father's.\nHe had formerly, at the request of the latter, seen\" M. N.\" more than\nORce, and now, on the 20th, he had been brought by my father to visit\nher again, and had confessed, though much prejudiced against mesmer\u00b7\nism, that her health was certainly improved.\nThe next day, however, when he came on purpose to see the\nwonders my father had described to him, the seance was a failure.\nThe sleep took place as usual, but the patient remained apparently\ndumb. Whether the fact of his incredulity had, or could have any\ndirect effect upon the patient, I cannot, with my limited experience,\ndecide; but I am inclined to suspect tha.t the failure was due to my\nnerves being upset by tho knowledge that the doctor had come on pur\u00b7\npose to criticise. I know that I was extremely anxious that he should\nsee the things which I saw day after day, and be convinced that at any\nrate I and my whole family were not the credulous fools he secretly sus-\npected us of being, but that appearances, at any rate, justified our belief.\nThis anxiety, and the nervousness produced by it, were, I believe, the\nsole cause of failure.\nNo one (except perhaps my mother, who went very often) ever saw\nmy patient at her best, the same cause operating, only in a less degree,\nwhenever the seance was in any Way made a medium of sight-seeing.\nAnd this leads me to remark that whenever I hear of a lecturer on\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept.,l884.] Jom\u00b7nat of SociPtu for P8ychical Re8ent\u00b7cl,. 139\nthis and kindred subjects failing occasionally to produce the promised\nresults, hooted offthe stage, probably, by a crowd of indignant sightseers,\nit is to me an additional testimony to the genuineness of his ex-\nperiments.\nWhen these results are produced by trickery, or mechanism, they\ncan be repeated any number of times with perfect precision and regu-\nlarity; but when they come to us as the effect of experiments having to\ndo with unknown or unexplained forces, we must expect to be often\nhamed, not knowing fully the conditions under which those forces act.\nWith occasional interruptions, varying from a day or two to a week\nor two, the seances were continued daily all through the summer, and\nwere witnessed by several persons at different times, besides the members\nof my own family. I find the names of seven people, many of whom\nare still living, who were present-some of them more than once-either\nin that summer or the winter following.\nI cannot now remember whether any real \"thought-reading\" had\nbegun before I left home for several weeks on October 24th. That\nit did so very shortly after my return is certain, from the following cir-\ncumstances, which,though of a private nature, must be mentioned in order\nto make the rest of my story intelligible.\nIt was during this absence that I became engaged to be married\nto a gentleman belonging to the Indian Civil Service. Circumstances\nmade it expedient at the time to keep the matter quiet, and it was\nknownonly to my parents and immediate relations. The gentleman had\ngone to India. immediately after our engagement, and I returned home\nto my usual occupations as if nothing had happened. Noone in the\ntown knew anything about it then, or till some weeks afterwards, yet I\nhad no sooner malpletised my patient than she began talking as if all\nthe facts were perfectly familiar to her. \" India is a long way off, isn't\nit, dear ~ I wish we could be nearer home, but, of course, if he is there\nwe must go too.\" In fact for months she could talk of little else when\nmesmerised, and knew my husband's name, a.ge, and appearance, but\nwas as ignorant as the rest of the world when in her natural state.\nGradually this knowledge of all that I knew became more and more\ncomplete, and, accustomed as I was by this time to such marvels, she\nsometimes fairly astonished me. One day she suddenly burst out\n~~\"~~a~~~~~~~~~~\nstairs !\" I looked up, \"What are you ta.lking about 1 When do you\nmean ~\" \"Why, you know, this morning, and dear papa was waiting;\nhe doesn't like us to be late for prayers. But we only just wanted\nto finish that sentence.\" My curiosity was thoroughly aroused now,\nand r inquired, \"Wha.t sentence~\" \"Why,the German book-Schiller,\n.wasn't it~\" It was perfectly true, though the fact had made but a slight\nDigitized by Google\n\f140 Journal oj Societu jor Psychical Research. [Sept.. 1884.\nimpression upon me, and I had certainly not thought 01 it a.ga.in until\nthus reminded of it, that I had been reading German upstairs that\nmorning until the prayer bell rang, and then, lingering for a moment to\nfinish a sentence, I had rushed hastily downstairs to avoid being late.\nThis and other phenomena of the sa.me kind puzzled me a great\ndeal; not the fact of her knowing what I knew, for with that idea I\nwas by this time familiar; but the thing which I could not understand\nwas her brain being acted upon by such apparently trifting occurrences.\nI could perceive that things which had deeply impressed my brain\nmight be repeated in hers as the deflections of one needle are repeated\nby another at the opposite pole of the electric current. When I asked\nher a question, my brain probably gave the answer which hers re-\npeated, but why did she spontaneously drag up little things which I had\nforgotten 7 Sometimes she even introduced little conversations be-\ntween my father and mother which had taken place in my\npresence. \"Dear mamma was vexed,\" she began one day,\nand then came particulars of some little argument between\nmy father and mother, which I had heard at the time but had\nnever thought of again, and certainly never repeated. I have often\nthought over this difficulty since, but cannot in the least explain it ex-\ncept upon the supposition that certain th~ do impress our brs.ins more\nstrongly than others. although we may be unconscious of the fact. It\nis a line of inquiry which I should think might be worth pursuing in\nthe interests of physical science, if any physician of note could so far\nshake oft' all prejudice as to make experiments for himself.\nI have only a few more wonders to relate, and they are all of the\nsame kind. One day,during the winter, I was sitting by the fire opposite\nto my patient, and, to pass the time,instead of working on this occasion,\nI bad a. book. I have forgotten what it was, except that it was a novel,\none of Dickens', I think. Suddenly she began to laugh. I looked up\nand saw her with her eyes shut as usual, but her head moving as if\nreading with her forehead, and her mouth smiling. \"What are you\nlaughing at 7\" \"Why at the story, of course.\" \"What story 7\" And she\ntold me what I wasreadingabout,making her coJDJrients on thecha.racters\nand expressing her amusement at some passages, and her sorrow at any-\nthing pathetic which I came to in the course of my reading. I asked her\nthe page, and she told me. I asked her whereabouts onthe page certain\npassages were, and shetoldme that also. I tried her with written letters,\nand figures, and put her power to all kinds of tests, and the result a.lways\nwas that she knew what I knew but nothing beyond. She was never\nwhat is popularly known as clairvoyante.\nI mention this particularly, because it was a. point which T took\ngreat pains to ascertain, and several times when I .asked her questions\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept.,l8St.] Journal 01 Societylor P8.1\/cltical RC8earch. 141\nabout people and things at a distance her answers were so decided, auel\nher knowledge apparently,.so minute and circumstantial, that I was\nvery nearly deceived into believing it to be true. But on every occasion\nof the sort I found, on inquiry, that truth and fiction were mixed up\ntogether. Everything which I knew myself was true. But the particular\nfacts which were happening at the moment, and which she described as\nif she saw them, were purely imaginary.\nOne remarkable instg,nce in illustration of this I will relate. It\nhappened during the summer, or early spring, of 1851. 1\\1y man\"ieel\nsister, with her husband and children, were expected at a vicarage lline\nor ten miles off,. to pay a visit to his father. I knew this, and was,\ntherefore, not surprised when we began to talk about it. Here, I\nthought, is a gooel opportunity to test her clairvoyance, so I said, \"Oh,\nyes, we knew they were to come to-day, but have they anived 1 Look\nand tell me 1\" After a short pause she began in rather an excited\nway, \"Yes, yes, I see them all just getting out of the carriage.\"\n\"Whom do you see1\" I asked. \"I see Mr. -- and Mrs. -- and the\nnurse, and so many children. They are going into the house, into the\ndrawing-room on the left of the hall.\" She\u00b7 then de.ribed the\nvicarage, the drive up to it, and many other particulars with what\nI knew to be perfect accuracy, and her whole story was so likely, so\nmuch what I expected to happen, that I was quite prepared to have\n-the whole confinned on inquiry. But it was not so. In the first place,\n\"'the train had been late, and the party did not arrive until an hour or\n-two later; and, in the second place, my brother-in-law was detained at\nhis own vicarage, many miles away, and never at\"rivecl at all at that\ntime.\nOn another occasion, some infonnation she gave me about 1\\11'. ---,\nin India, though very li,kely and plausible, turned out to be incorrect.\nHer thought-reading was always perfect, but the clairvoyance\nalways failed when accurately tested; and though r know how fallacious\nan opinion based on one experiment must often be, and also that there is\nplenty of good evidence for the tru~h of clairvoyance, I have sometimes\nspeculated whether, if any apparent case of clairvoyance were accu-\nrately inquired into, it would not often be found to have its origin in\n\" thought-reading.\"\nTowards the end of the summer of 1851, I gave up magnetising\n\"M.\" as a regular thing.

I hoped\nthat my long absence in India, eight years, would han worn out this.\ninfluence; hut when at last I returned home and went to see her, I found\nher alrcady lapsing into the trance, and had great difficulty in keeping-\nher out of it during my yisit. I believe that a more experienced and\nskilful operator could have prevented this in the beginning, and through-\nout the course it was always a subject of regret to me.\nM. A. P.\nSPECIMENS OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF CASES FOR\n\"PHANTASMS OF THE LIVING.\"\nV.\nThose who have given any serious attention to psychical researcli\nwill certainly not need to be told that its various branches of inquiry\nare by no means isolated, but touch each other and mingle with each\nother in a variety of ways. The phenomena inosculate, and the causes.\nare interfused. And consequently the lines of division between one of\nour books and another are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Were we\u00b7\npossessed of complete knowledge of the subject we could not survey it\u00b7\nin separate provinces without signalising between each province large\nbelts of debateable ground.\nAnd since, in fact, our knowledge of the whole matter is as yet of a.\nquite rudimentary and superficial kind, it bellows us, therefore, to re-\nmember that, at the very most, all that we can hope to do is to con-\nstruct a Linnrean rather than a natural system. 'Ye cannot expect to- ,\ntrace the true filiation of our complex phenomena from their supersensory\norigins, but at most to get hold (as Linnreus did) of certain deeply-seated\nand constant characters which may, in many cases, be found ultimately\nmore or less closely coincident with tile groups in which a complete\nknowledge may ultimately dispose the multiform narratives with which\nwe deal.\nThe cases of scenes flashed on the mind, with which we have been\ndealing in these papers, afford a conspicuous illustration of this inter-\nmixture of psychical agencies. The idea of clain'oyance as possibly\noperative in the presentation of some of these phantasmal scenes, has\nprobably presented itself to most of our readers.\nClairvoyance, however, as commonly understood, can scarcely be\nclaimed as a form of telepathy. It seems, at first sight, to be rather an\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept.,1884.], Journal of Societ!1 for PS!lchical Re8earch. 143\nextension of the powers of some one individual mind than the result\nof any communication from another mind; rather a sublimated I~Y1JerreB\u00ad\nthesia than a part of what we have been postulating as telaistluJBia,\ninduced by impact from without. Yet the history of clairvoyance, if\nrightly considered, is one of the most striking illustrations of the far-\nreaching importance of telepathic agencies. Clairvoyance was for a\nlong time known as a phenomenon of spontaneous, morbid origin.\nIt was connected mainly with somnambulism, or with different forms of\nsleep-waking and double consciousness, and it might certainly have been\ntaken as the very type of a physiological state incommunicable by\ninfection or contact.\nIncommunicable byinfection of the ordinaryphysical kind it assuredly\nis. There are no bacilli luci\/eri, no germs of lucidity, which convey the\ncapacity of distant vision from man to man. But inexcitable by\ncontact, surprising to say, it is not. It was one of the most startling\ndiscoveries of the early days of mesmerism that the passes which were\nthought of as conveying \"vital fluid,\" and as effective in stilling pain,\nor producing salutary crises in disease, did also sometimes produce a\nsmte of \"cerebral lucidity,\" in which the ordinary range of the senses\nseemed to be altogether transcended. This was a discovery made not\nonly without the discoverers' intention, but almost against their will;\nfor they foresaw (what was, in fact, the case) that the additional\nincredulity provoked by these new pretensions would prejudice the\ncause of curative mesmerism in which they were mainly interested.\nTheir great difficulty was that this new power could hardly be repre-\nsented as an extension of the power already claimed for mesmeric\npasses, i.e., of communicating to one organism either the general vital\ncondition or the actual sensations of another. If I mesmerise a patient\nand cure his headache, it may be said that I have but transferred to\nhis nerves something that was already in my own. And if he developes\ncommunity of thought or sensation, if he knows what I have in my\npocket, or tastes what I place on my tongue, this may still be called a\nmere extension of the sympathy established between the two nervous\nsystems. But if I mesmerise my patient and he proceeds to tell me\nwhat is going on in the next house, or in a house fifty miles off,-things.\nwhich neither he nor I can know by ordinary means,-we seelD to have\nmade a leap into magical wonders quite unconnected with our previous.\ntheory of nervous communication.\nNow just the same difficulty which met the mesmerist meets the\npsychologist who is attempting to explain by telepathy the phantasmal\nperception of distant scenes. It gradually becomes hard to maintain\nthat the distant scene IS a mere picture transferred from some other\nmind. In certain cases the analogy with mesmeric clairvoyance becomes\nDigitized by Google\n\f144 Jourllal qf Socicf,1f for PS.I\/chical Rescarch.

We have traced those scenes\nin one dit'eCtion already;-D.B they beca.me more panoramic, more\npictorial, more limited in extent, and in this way more analogous- to\nordinary three-dimensional percepts. We ha.ve now to trace them\nalong another line, and to watch them becoming more real, more pro-\nlonged, more complex, till they suggest, not the mere presence of some\nnew object in the percipient's field of view, but rather the transference\nof the percipient's own point of observation to some distant field.\nHere, as elsewhere, we shall find various steps of transition. And\ninasmuch as the novelty which is here introduced consists of some\napparent psychical action on the percipient's own part, it will be\nconvenient to seek for abnormalities in ltis conditiOn, and consider whe-\nther there is any profound agitation, or any abnormally deep absorption,\nwhich may seem to have set free his own psychical energies to travel\nalong some unknown way.\nIn this connection Dr. Goodall Jones' case, as given ill Proceedings\nII., will at once occur to us; when the sick woman's delirium seemed\nto have quickened her telepathic perception of her distant husband's\ndanger. And we will cite a parallel case, where the percipient's\nnervous disturbance is more chronic and deep-seated.\nFrom the Rev. Henry W. Harden, Hemsby Vicarage, Great Yarmouth.\nMay 10th, 1884.\nAbout two years ago an elderly woman in this parish, named Elizabeth\nCubitt, was drawing near her t\\nd with faculties and memory impaired by a\nlong illness, one feature of which was the nervous ailment called St. Vitus'\ndance.\nA grandson, aged 18, was at sea in a fishing boat. One morning she\ndeclared that she knew he was drowned for she had seen him in the water,\nAnd she strongly persisted in the statement. About three days afterwards\nthe lad came home and related in explanation of the wet clothes he brought\nback how, in a storm, he had been washed overboard by a wave and washed\nback by the next wave into the boat. The date of the event coincided with\nthat of the grandmother's dream or vision.\nHENRY W. HARDEN.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mr. Harden says ;-\nAt the time of the occurrence which I narrated about Mrs. Cubitt, I was\nvisiting her pastorally, and at one of my visits heard the facts from hergrand-\ndaughter (now Laura Chaney), an intelligent and respectable young woman,\nwho was nursing her grandmothet, and to whom the remark was made.\nBefore writing to you I verified my memory by asking Laura Chaney to\ntell me the story again as she remembered it. Her impreBBion was that it\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept., 1884.] Journal 0\/ Society\/or P8,ckicnl Re8earck. 145\nwas a dream, but from Mrs. Cubitt'l ltate at the time I hardly think it could\nbe said with certainty whether Ihe was awake or aaleep. My impreBlion was\nthat it was IOmething di1ferent from a dream-from the way in which (as it\nwas told to me) Ihe had said, \"I saw him in the water,\" instead of saying\n\" I dreamt that I saw him.\"\nI don't think Ihe was particularly lubject to alarms. Laura Chaney says\nthat when Edward Barnes, a relative, died, Mrs. Cubitt knew of it before\nthe newl came, and insisted that IOmething had happened, but ahe could\ngive no further details nor could ahe lpecify other instancel.\nThis case is not one of which the details can be pressed. But it\nmay serve to mark a step in the argument; and it may be reinforced\nby the celebrated historical case which we next cite; the vision of the\npoor fishwife with St. Vitus' dance thus forming our closest parallel to\nthe royal historian's \"avertissement que Dieu donne aux personnes\nillustres.\"\nFrom the Mimoiru de Marguerite de ValoW. Reine de Navarre.\nLa reine, ma mhre, lltoit a Metz, dangereusement malade de la fihvre.\nElle ~voit, et lltant aBBiatlle autour de IOn lit du Roi Charles, mon frere, et\nde ma lteur et mon frhre de Lorraine, et plusieura MeBBieura du Conseil,et de\nforce dames et princellel, qui, la tenant hora d'espllrance, ne l'abbandonoient\npoint, I'llena, continuant Bel reveries, comme Ii elle eut vu donner la bataille\nde J amac : \"Voyez comme il fuyent; mon fils a la victoire ; he Mon Dieu !\nrelevez mon fill, il elt par terre: Voyez VOUB dans cette haye Ie Prince de\nCondll mort I\" ToUB ceox qui Iltoit1a croyoient qu'elle revoit.

In some\nof these the perception was accompanied (and seemingly facilitated) by\na kind of nervous, agitation, slight, indeed, but bearing some analogy\nto the spasmodic movements of chorea or the inconsequent impulses of\ndelirium.\nAgain, this tendency to excitement is not the only way in which the\npercipient of these phantasmal scenes has tended to become slightly\nabnormal. Attentive scrutiny of the cases already given will show\nthat there has been a proneness to sudden and brief accesses of drowsi\u00b7\nness, just at the moment when the scene was about to appear. Now\nour usual way of explaining this fact would be to say that the impres-\nsion waited till a. casually occurring drowsiness dulled the competing\ntrains of thought, and gave opportunity for the telepathic impact to rise\ninto consciousness.\nBut it can never be amiss, in these obscure mattera, to scrutinise our\nDigitized by Google\n\f146 Journal of Societgfor P8gcMcai Research. ![Sept., l8IW.\ntheory afresh, and to consider whether these interchanging causes and\neffects can be looked at in a new aspect. Is it conceivable that the tele-\npathic impact can ever be the caU88 of the drowsiness 1 That it in some\nway hypnotises the percipient, and thus succeeds in forcing itself into his\nconsciousness 1 To give weight to this view, we should need instances.\nof very exact coincidence between the actual enaction of the primary\nscene, and the sudden drowsiness in which its secondary image is dis-\nplayed. Or we should need to observe accesses of drowsiness as marked\nand abnormal, as in the following case :-\n., Der jetzige Spiritismus.\" Prof. Dr. Maximilian Perty, Laipzig, 1877.\np.291.\nDr. Notter (a friend of Dr. Perty's) describes a clairvoya.nt cousin of his\nas one of the most sober\u00b7minded, prosaic, thoroughly unimaginative men he\nknew, for which reason he did not caro to say much about his clairvoyant\nexperiences. When in 1869 his eldest son was accompanying the expedition\nin Mexico as army surgeon, the father was, on one occasion in the forenoon,\nsuddenly overcome with an irresistible inclination to aleep. He was a man\nextremely exact in his work, was never lIAlCustomed to aleep in the forenoon,\nand was then engaged on official accounts. During this aleep, which, accord\u00b7\ning to the testimony ofattendants who were present, could not have lasted\nmore than a minute and a.half, the father saw the IOn, pale, and leaning\nBlainat the side of a narrow paBI; his horae, which was a greyone, was close\nby, and also several military officers. He wasgreatly terrified at what he had\nseen, but in order not to alarm his family, said nothing to anyone, but\nsatisfied himself with noting the day and hour. After three or four weeks a\nletter came from the son in which he described how at that very time he had\nbeen thrown from his horse, and as he was again attempting to mount he\nreceived a kick which broke one of the bllnes in his foot. The pain had made\nhim almost faint away, so that he was obliged to lean against the side of the\nroadway, but he soon reco\\'ered from the accident without any permanent\nill effects. A later letter oonfirmed all particulars and mentioned that the\ndoctor was actually riding a grey horae.\nOur data here are still insufficient. But we have at least found a.\ndefinite inquiry to pursue, viz.: Are momentary fits of drowsiness, in\nwhich distant events are observed, ever provably coincident to the very\nminute with those events 1 If they are so, there will be ground to\nsuspect that the drowsiness is of a quasi.mesmeric character, in some\nway induced by the distant agent's excitement, and a necessary pre-\nrequisite to the telepathic perception.\nIt would be very desirable in this connection to ascertain whether\nspontaneous somnambulists are ever conscious of distant crises. Cases\nof this sort would be very welcome; at present we can only give two;\nnor is it quite clear what the percipient's condition precisely was in\neither of them.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept.,l884.] Journal Qf Society for Psyc!lical Research. 147\n3, Mclean Place, Dumbarton, January 8th, 1883.\nPRcwESSOR BuB.ET1'. .\nSm,-Some time ago my brother joined the Loch Rannach, and sailed\nfrom the tail of the bank for Melbourne.

Pritchard, Tan\u00b7y\u00b7coed, Bangor.\nJanuary 30th, 1884.\nTwo years ago I awoke, one night, with a curiOUB senaation of being in a\nsick room, and of the prese.1C6 of people who were anxiously watching by the\nbedside of some person, who was dangeroualy m. It was not till some time\nafter that we heard that one of my sisters, then living in Florida, had been\nvery ill of a fever, and was at the time of the incident in a most critical state.\nMA.GGIE E. PRITCHARD.\nIn reply to inquiries. Miss Pritchard adds :-\nI hat'e never had any other experience of an impression of sickneBB or\ndeath.\nThe impreBSion of sickness was not the continuation of a dream and\nhardly a distinct waking impreBSion. I woke from a heavy sleep with a\ngreat sense of oppression, which gradually seemed to assume a distinct im-\npreBSion. It lasted about half an hour, that is, the actual impression, but I\nhad a great feeling of uneasiness for several days. I have never had any\nhallucinations or dreams of death.\nThe following corroboration is from Miss Pritchard's sister :-\nI recollect my sister telling me of her feeling of being in a sick room with\npeople watching round 3 bedside. She did not mention it to me till the\nmorning (it occurred during the night). It did not make much impreBSion\non me at the time-not tillafterwards, when we heard of our sister's dangerous\nillneBS.-E. B.

The evidence, indeed, is as strong as can fairly\nbe expected where no crisis of a moment or of an hour is involved, the\nimpression coinciding with a prolonged state of distress. But the\ngreat interest of the narrative lies in the light which it throws on what\nwe may call the genesis of telepathic clairvoyance. For the illness of\nthe sister in Florida affects the sister in England in a way which seeIlJs\nalmost midway between the two assumed modes of communication.\n\fSept., 1884.] Journal of SocietyJor P8ychical Be8earch. 149\nLet us try to picture to ourselves (bearing in mind that it is only\nconjecture) how this phenomenon may have occurred.\nThe English sister, \u00b7we will say, in her\" heavy sleep,\" was in a con-\ndition specially open to telepathic impact. Such impiLct came to her\nfrom the invalid in America, and elicited in her the power of telepathic\ncla.irvoyance. As we have already seen, this faculty seems most readily\n1;0 be excited when the percipient is asleep. The number of\nclairvoyant dreams is large. This lady, then, might have been expected\nto experience merely a clairvoyant dream, remembered or forgotten on\nwaking, as the case might be. On this occasion, however, things seem\nto have occurred somewhat differently. The shock of waking dispelled\nthe dream; but the clairvoyant connection was still maintained in-\ndistinctly, not as vision, but as the mere sensation of presence in the\nmidst of an imperfectly apprehended scene. This may be regarded as a\nkind of faint \"clairvoyance\" ; since we know too little of the nature of\n\" clairvoyant\" pere.eption to assume that a sense of sigltt is a necesSary\nelement in it. It seems better defined as \"apparent transference of\nthe centre of consciousness, with perceptions whose extent and nature\nseem todepend on the intensity of direction of the percipieut's attention.\nrather than on the range of any special organsof sense.\" In the case\nwhich we are considering, the perception scattered by the shock of waking\nseems gradually to have collected itself again, in the percipient's tran-\nquillity, much in the same way as a dream sometimes forms itself anew\nin a second slumber.\nOur next case throws an interesting light on the nature of tele-\npathic clairvoyance.\nMy uncle, the late A-- S--, Esq.; of Thornbury, near Bristol, was\nliving at his villa in that little town in the year 1842, and on the evening of a\ncertain day in November had retired to bed in his usual health, at his\ncustomary hour. Contrary to hiB habit, however, he could not sleep, but\nlay awake counting thE> houra until three o'clock in the morning, when Bud-\ndenly he found himaelf in a country whoBe featureB were quite Btrange to\nhim. He became aware that he waa in the Neilgherrie hill country of India,\nwhere hiB brother S-- waa on invalid furlough. It appeared to him that he\nremained three months there with 8--, that he attended h~m during his\nillness, and thatfinally S-- died,whEln the vision faded,and he found himself\n.again in hiB bed. He waa now satiafied that this vision had revealed a\ncertainty to him, turned round and fell asleep, and in the morning he told my\na\\1nt all about it. He baa mentioned this matter to me Beveral timeB, and\nalways expreBBed his belief that he waa broad awake while he Baw the vision,\nwhich he thought must have paaBed with tae rapidity of \"thought,\" and was.\nqaite lure it waa no dream.\nIn the next Bpring my uncle and aunt were at Cheltenham, whither they\nhad gone for the benefit of MrB. 8--'B health; in due coome my uncle\nDigitized by Google\n\f150 Jorernalof Bacielll fot\u00b7 P8ychical Re86arc\/,. [Sept.,18SL\nreceived from his brother's agents at Madras a letter containing information\nof S--'s death at such and such a place in the Neilgherrie Hills, at the\nprecise day and hour that mv uncle saw the vision in his bed at Thornbury.\n\"It was no news to me,\" said my uncle to me when telling me of the\ncircumstance; \"I knew poor S-- wu gone several months befOl'e.\"\n(Signed) A. S.\nHere we find the percipient insisting that he was \"broad awake\" j\nalthough the vision seen is, as one may say, a dream on the very face\nof it. Where else but in a dream (we may ask), are the events of\nmonths apparently lived through in a few moments1 Is such a con-\ncentrated retrospection possible except in sleep 1 To this question an\nanswer suggests itself which seems at once to put us in the right track.\nConcentrated retrospection of this kind is experienced, as is abundantly\ntestified,in the act of drownin3. That is to say, in the nearest approach\nto actual death of which we have numerous and concordant accounts,\nwe find that a rapid revivification of memory is a habitual feature. It\nseems conceivable, then, that a telepathic impression coming from a\ndying person might convey a kind of bird's-eye review of a loag tract of\nprevious existence. And, in supposing this to be the case, we are\nmerely extending a hypothesis already made, namely, that the picture\nof a scene, as transferred from an agent's mind, may carry with it some-\nthing of his reflections upon that scene, or of his foresight as to what is\ngoing to happen next.\nWe shall give one more death-bed scene, a case which comes to us\non very good authority, and which suggests several reflections.\nI had kno\\VJl Mr. H-- as a medical man, under whose treatment I had\nbeell for BOme years, and at whose hands I had experienced great kindnell8.\nHe had ceued to attend me for considerably more than a year at the time of\nhis death. I wu aware that he had given up practice, but beyond that I\nknew nothing of his proceedings, or of the Btate of his health. At the time\nI last saw him, he appeared particularly well, and even made Borne remark\nhimself u to the amount of vigour and work left in him\nOn Thursday, the 16th day of December, 1875, I had been for BOme\nlittle time on a visit at my brother-in-law'B and Bister'B house near London.\nI wu in good health, but from the morning and throughout the day I felt\nunaccountably depressed and out of Bpirits, which I attributed to the gloomi-\nneBS of the weather.

The attempt failed, and I returned to the dining-room\nwhere I sat by myself, my Bister being engaged elsewhere. The thought of\nMr.-- came into my miad, and suddenly, with my eyes open, u I believe,\nfor I wu not feeling Bleepy, I seemed to be in a room in whicD a man wu\nlying dead in a small bed. I recognised the face at once u that of Mr.--\nand felt, DO doubt, that he wu dead and not asleep only. The room appeared\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept., 1884.] Journal C!f Sociefy\/a]' Psychical Research. 151\n------------------------\nto be bare and without carpet or furniture. I cannot Bay how long the\n.appearance la.sted. I did not mention the appearance to my sia~er or brother-\nin-law at the time. I tried to argue with myself that there could be nothing\nin what I had seen, chiefly on the gIound that from what I knew of Mr.--'s\ncircumstances, it was most improbable that, if dead, he would be in a room\nin 80 bare and unfurnished a state. Two days afterwards, on December 18th,\nI left my sister's house for home. About a week after my arrival, another of\nmy sisters read out of the daily papers the announcement of Mr.--'s death,\nwhich had taken place abroad, and on December 16th, the day on which I\nhad Been the appearsnce.\nI have Bince been informed that Mr.-- had died in a sma)) villa.ge\nhospital in a warm foreign climate, having been suddenlyattacktld with illneaa\nwhilst on his travels.\nNow we find, on inquiry, that Mr.-- had died some hours before\nthis clairvoyant vision occurred. And the vision avowedly reveals not\na dying man but a dead man. It might therefore be urged that this\nnarrative was out of place amongst cases of telepathic impressions\noriginated by living minds. But on a closer survey we observe that the\nmarked depression began in the rlwrrting, and that the vision was not a\nsudden incident, but rather the culmination of a prolonged emotional\ndisturbance.\nWe suggest, therefore, that the dying man's thought reached this\nlady's n:.ind, and affected it (as in so many other cases) with a mere\nvague depression. This depression, however, was strong and persistent;\nit accumulated as the effects of a synchronous vibration accumulate, and\nat last, when the percipient was in a passive condition, (having been\ndriven to renounce other occupations by this haunting sense of distress),\nshe was made, for a moment, clairvoyante, and her centre of conscious-\nness was transferred to the scene whence the operating in1luence had\narisen. By that time, no doubt, the scene was one of apparent death; but\nwe may still refer the original impulse to the dying man. And we may\njust observe that the phenomena of mesmerism offer some interesting\nanalogies in the incubation of transmitted impulses in the subject's\nbrain.\nIt is, in fact, obvious that in dealing with telepathic clain\u00b7oyance we\nare, so to speak, standing at a centre towards which many lines of\nrecorded phenomena converge. We must not encumber the main course\nof our argument by noticing these at length. But we may just point\nout that among the cases of so-called \"second-sight\" in the Highlands,\nkc., are many which would fall into our scheme just at this point. In\n\"second sight,\" two distinct elements seem to be involved: (1) Sym-\nbolical prevision, as the sight of coffins or lights before death; (2)\nClairvoyance, sometimes voluntarily exercised, sometimes involuntarily,\nand in the latter case corresponding generally to sorue danger or distress\nDigitized by Coog\n\f152 JOl{rnal qf Sociefylor P8.'Ichical Re8earch.

The quaint case which we cite from \"Theophilus\nInsulanus,\" a contemporary collection of such narratives made by :Mr.\nDonald Macleod towards the end of the 18th century, is obviously\nparallel to many of the experiences on which we have already dwelt.\nMary Campbell, a woman of acknowledged probity and candour, relatea\nthat when she was a )oung girl, living in her father's house upon the island\nof Scalpa, there was a notable old aeer, one Evander Mac Mbaoldonich, 110\ndomestic in the family, who by the second sight, foretold several events which\npunctually came to pass; and in particular, that Kenneth Campbell, her\nbrother, being on a ~jaunt in the Lewes, and as he was returning home,\naccompanied by his servant whom he had sent upon an errand to a village at\n80me distance, as the aaid Kenneth was solitarily on his way, he found him\u00b7\nself seized with a faintiahnlll8, which 80 gained upon him that he W\/UI obliged\nto crawl on all fours, through mires and puddles, to a desolate cottage, where\nhe remained that night, and after a 80und sleep, recovered of his ailment.\nThe old Beef that night seemed frettish, and being asked the Nason of his\nbeing 80 much out of humour, told that the aaid Kenneth Campbell waa not\nat his ease, and that he observed him, by the second sight, ina very different\ncondition, his clothes being fuddled, and all bespattered with filth and mud;\nwhich, upon his return to the family next day, he himself declared to have\nbeen literally true, according to the above prediction.\nHere we ma.y leave for the present the subject of telepathic clair-\nvoyance. The next paper will be concerned with cases where the\nquasi-percept is still confined to one individual, although there seems no\nobvious reason why other persons present might not have shared in the\nseeing or hearing, had there been ~nything objective to see or hear.\nF.
