There were also present :\nMr W. R. Bousfield, K.C., Miss Ina Jephson, Mr W. H. Salter, Mrs\nW. H. Salter, Dr F. C. S. Schiller and Dr V. J. Woolley ; also Mr\nTheodore Besterman, Librarian and Editor, and Miss Isabel Newton,\nSecretary.\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read and signed\nas correct.\nIt was decided to hold the Annual General Meeting at 3.30 p.m.\non Friday, 26 February 1931.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 177th General Meeting of the Society was held at Friends House,\nEuston Road, London, N.W.I, on Wednesday, 26 November 1930,\nat 6 p.m., Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., in the chair.\nMiss Ina Jephson read a Report on \" Further Experiments in\nCard-guessing, with a more Evidential Technique.\" Miss Jephson\ngave a summary of the experiments recently conducted by Mr Soal,\nMr Besterman and herself, reports of which will, it is hoped, appear\nshortly in Proceedings. An interesting discussion followed.\nNOTICE.\nMembers will have observed that the Index and Titlepage of the\nvolume of the Journal just completed were issued to all members\nwith the December number, instead of to those only who purchased\nbinding-cases, as heretofore. This departure will, it is hoped,\nencourage more members to bind and preserve their Journals for\nfuture use and reference. Complete sets of the Society's publications\nare now very difficult to form and this will become more and more\n\f2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1931\ndifficult as time passes. It is therefore in their own interests that\nmembers are advised to preserve their copies.\nBinding-cases for vols, xxv and xxvi (which are treated for this\npurpose as a single volume) can be supplied for Is. 6d. Alternatively,\nmembers can send in their sets of the Journal for the two years (1929\nand 1930) and have them bound by the Society's binders for 4s. 0d.,\nwhich includes the cost of the binding-case. Missing numbers of the\nJournal for recent years can be supplied for 9d. each. Orders should\nbe accompanied by remittances, and should be addressed to the\nSecretary.\nTRANSACTIONS OF THE ATHENS CONGRESS.\nThe Transactions of the Athens Congress are now published, and can\nbe supplied for 7s. 6d., on application to the Secretary.\nIn addition to a Diary of the Congress, in which are included\nseveral addresses by Dr Tanagra, Dr Driesch and Sir Oliver Lodge,\nthe volume contains the following papers :\nPersonne et Suprapersonne, par Hans Driesch, Professeur a\nl'Universite de Leipsic.\nDas psychophysische Problem vom parapsychologischen und vom\nphanomenologischen Standpunkt aus, von T.

Miss Jones has\nhad other apparently supernormal experiences, which will be found\nrecorded in the Journal (1912), xv. 337-9, 339-42 (on which cp. xvi.\n14-5) ; (1913), xvi. 51-6 (cp. xvi. 78-9) ; (1914), xvi. 306-10 (cp. xxi.\n117-8) ; (1924), 350-2. Several of these cases are discussed by Mrs\nSidgwick in her supplementary examination of \" Phantasms of the\nLiving\/'' Proceedings (1922), xxxiii. 317-8, 330-1, 352-3.\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research januaey 1931\nMiss Jones's, account of her experiences, which is dated 13 July\n1930, is as follows :\n\"Death of Camille Vidart.\n\" On the morning of Saturday June 28th I was unable to get to\nwork as usual because of a sense of disturbance and of a death of some\nimportance. It seemed to me that some public person was dying. I\nknew that the death did not concern my husband who was away in\nKent at the time. Towards noon the feeling became so insistent that\nI called my housemaid Dorothy Holtby out on to the roof where I\nwas trying to write and told her to make a note of the day and of my\npremonition.\n\" On July 9th I received a copy of Le Journal de Geneve with the\nannouncement of Camille Vidart 's death.\n\" She was my godmother and a person well known as a linguist and\na feminist in Europe and America. I had not heard that she was ill\nnor had we exchanged any letters since our Christmas greetings. I\nsaw her last in the spring of 1928 when she visited me in London.\n[Signed, Ann Jones]\n\"\nWith this statement was enclosed the housemaid's corroboration.\n\" On Saturday morning, June 28th [Miss Ann Jones] called me\non to the roof of her flat in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and said that she\nhad a feeling, that something rather sad was happening, but that it\nwas entirely out of England, and did not concern any of her close\nrelatives.\n[Signed] Dorothy Gertrude Holtby.\"\nMiss Jones also sent a cutting from Le Journal de Geneve announc-\ning the death of Mademoiselle Camille Vidart on 28 June. The\nnotices \" de faire part \" include three from Societies in Geneva, thus\ncorroborating Miss Jones' s impression that the person who had died\nwas of some public importance.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nOn a Series of Sittings.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I have read with much interest Mr Irving's comments (in.\nProceedings, xxxix. 333 ff.) on my report on the Warren Elliott\nsittings and cannot but help feeling somewhat gratified that he has\nfound so little matter for criticism. Mr Irving's personal experience\nof sittings with various mediums is far wider than my own and it was\nonly to be expected that from that experience he would be able to\nmodify and correct some of the impressions which I derived from the\nstudy of my narrower material.\n\fJanuary 1931 Correspondence 5\nI was bound by the facts actually before me and I endeavoured to\nmake it clear by the language which I used that any judgments\nwhich I passed and any suggestions which I made were based solely\non the evidence of those facts. In one or two places in the report I\nspecifically referred to the possibility of evidence from other sources\nmodifying the conclusions at which I had tentatively arrived.\nI am glad to see, therefore, that the modifications which Mr\nIrving's wider experience suggests are mainly in the nature of\namplifications or extensions of my own suggestions.\nMay I make a few remarks on the various points raised by him ?\nThe correspondence between the statement made in his Leonard\nsitting with that in the Elliott sitting of which an extract was given\non page 86 of my report, is very interesting. I agree that if a number\nof such correspondences between statements made by different\nmediums concerning the post mortem conditions of the ostensible\ncommunicators could be found, they might be held to possess some\nsmall evidential value, but until such correspondences are forth-\ncoming in considerable numbers and of many varieties, I think it is\nsafer to take the attitude which I adopted and, while not denying\nthe possibility of evidential value, not to seek to use it in supporting\nany hypothesis. As it happened, the matter under discussion when\nI made the remark in question was a statistical one and whether I\nhad allowed an evidential value to these post mortem statements\nor not would have made little, if any, difference in the conclusion.\nAs regards Feda's use of symbolism, I, of course, accept Mr\nIrving's interpretation of the \" mackintoshes and umbrellas\n\"\nincident. I had before me simply the record of the words used by\nFeda and, as Mr Irving says, any one reading the script might take\nthis for an example of symbolism.\nOn this matter of symbolism and the psychological processes\ninvolved in the reception and transmission of impressions received\nby the medium, Mrs Salter's paper in the same issue of Proceedings\nhas much of great interest.\nConcerning proper names, I was, of course, only speaking of the\nsittings actually before me. I know of one or two cases, apart from\nthese, where names have been correctly or nearly correctly given,\nbut on the whole, so far as my knowledge goes, I think it is correct\nto say that proper names, and more especially surnames, do present\na considerable difficulty to the Control. I believe that in this view\nmany investigators will agree with me. I do not for a moment imply\nthat such names are never correctly given, I simply suggest that they\nare peculiarly difficult to get through, the reason for this difficulty\nbeing easily imaginable. Hence it is that when they are successfully\ngiven they possess a high evidential value,\nI cannot quite understand Mr Irving's criticism of my treatment\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1931\nof the reference to Miss Newton and events at the offices of the\nSociety. I ascribed these provisionally to telepathy or clairvoyance\nand said, on page 160, that there was no grounds on which a choice\nbetween the two could be based. In those cases where, as in the one\ncited by Mr Irving, the information was not in the possession of Miss\nNewton at the time the statement was made, telepathy from her\nwould seem to be excluded. This might constitute grounds for\npreferring the hypothesis of clairvoyance, though telepathy from\nsome other person who had the necessary information would still\nbe a possible explanation.\nAnd finally, as regards the apparent discontinuity in communi-\ncations, Mr Irving brings forward some very interesting and sugges-\ntive facts. On page 114 of my report I remarked that habitual\nassociations were about the most individual part of the entire\nmental furnishing, and suggested that some evidence of identity\nmight possibly be derived from a study of these. Mr Irving's cases\nare good examples of what I was referring to.\nI was pleased to note that Mrs Salter, in her paper above referred\nto, appears to take the same view as myself. She says on page 325,\n\" Apart from all physical characteristics a man's personality is\nchiefly expressed in the association of ideas which constitute his\nmemory.\"\nIt seems to me that a promising avenue of research might be\nfound along these lines. Perhaps Mr Irving may be able to discover\namong his records some further instances of sequence of topics\nwhich exhibit the probable associative processes of the ostensible\ncommunicator. If a considerable number of such could be found\nit would, I submit, be valuable evidence of identity.\nYours, etc.,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nManifestations op the Living.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014In Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, September 1930, p. 559,\nHerr Hans Schubert concludes a paper entitled \" Are manifestations\nof persons still living possible ?\n\" by the wish that his readers\nshould send him well attested evidence bearing on similar facts.\nSome forty years ago, in St Petersburg, I came across such a\nfact. In M. D. Shilkm's circle (who was later on one of my best\nfriends) a \" message \" was once received\u2014not in my presence\n\u2014\npurporting to come from a certain Manassevitch-Manouiloff (who\nplayed a rather sinister part many years later in the political life\nof the Russian Empire). Manassevitch-Manouiloff, then in Paris,\ngave his correct address alleged to have been unknown to any one\n\fJanuary 1931 Correspondence 7\npresent (\" Hotel Bergere, cite Rhin \") and mentioned by name Mme\nE\u2014eff, a lady with whom he was staying, a fact also supposed to\nbe unknown. It turned out afterwards that he had epileptic fits\nat the time and therefore may have \" communicated \" during one\nof those fits ; and on his return to St Petersburg, when Mme E\u2014eff 's\nname was mentioned to him, he was said to have shown much\nembarrassment.\nI had at the time a proces-verbal of the sitting in question drawn\nup, and sent a translation to Mr Myers who, I think, thought the\nease remarkable. Unfortunately it was afterwards ascertained so\nfar as I can remember that the (private) medium through whom the\nmessage was obtained, played tricks on some other occasion or\noccasions ; so we thought it safer to consider the Manassevitch-\nManouiloff case as null and void. But it may have been genuine\nafter all.\nYours, etc.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nREVIEWS.\nGonzalo R. Lafora, Don Juan and other Psychological Studies.\nTranslated by Janet H. Perry. Preface by Charles S. Myers.\n8vo, pp. 288, 13 ill. London : Thornton Butterworth, Ltd.,\n1930. Price 7s. 6d. net.\nThis book contains five essays, with the last of which, entitled\n\" Spiritism \", we are alone concerned. The author is described on\nthe titlepage as \" Professor of Psychiatry in the Faculty of Medicine,\nDirector of the Laboratory for Cerebral Physiology at the Cajal\nInstitute, University of Madrid \", and in addition, on the wrapper,\nas \" Vice-President of the Spanish League for Mental Hygiene \".\nThe translator, we are informed, is \" Lecturer in the Department\nof Spanish Studies, University of London, King's College \". The\nwriter of the Preface is of course a distinguished psychologist, to\nwhom, the translator states (p. 11), she owes \" a debt of gratitude\nfor his careful revision of my manuscript \".\nUnder these eminent auspices we are entitled to expect a treatment\nof the subject distinguished by scientific precision and psychological\ninsight. And our hopes are encouraged by Professor Lafora himself,\nwho repeatedly declares himself to be animated by the most rigorous\nscientific principles. All too soon, however, the reader perceives\nthat these hopes are not to be realised. At the very outset of his\nessay we find the author sustaining his argument by lengthy\nquotations from the Daily Mirror, soon followed by similar excerpts\nfrom La Petite Gironde and from the Paris Times. We find the\nfollowing definition (p. 238) :\n\" Automatic writing, produced by\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1931\nsome instrument unknown to the medium, or else by a pencil only \".\nIn short, Professor Lafora's essay on spiritism is quite valueless.\nMany of his errors it is astonishing that the translator and the\nwriter of the preface should have passed. We are glad to say,\nhowever, that when the worst of the author's mistakes, one affecting\nthe Society, was pointed out to the publishers, they readily agreed\nto cause it to be corrected in future copies sold.\nTh. B.\nEmile Cailliet, La Prohibition de VOcculte. 8vo, pp. xii. 206.\nParis : Felix Alcan, 1930. Price 15 fr.\nThis book, though its conclusions must be rejected, deserves a\nwelcome on the score of its subject and of its method. The subject\nof the book is Prof. Bergson's conclusion in his Presidential Address\nto the S.P.R. (Proceedings, xxvi. 463) that behind the prejudice\nentertained by official science against psychical research lies an\nunconscious though natural and deeply-rooted metaphysic. Prof.\nCaillet's method is to examine this metaphysic by tracing it back to\nthe savage's belief in magic and fear of the sorcerer. This application\nof psychologico-ethnological treatment to psychical research is\nbecoming more and more recognised as an essential part of our\nstudies : for a true perspective is notably lacking in psychical\nresearch.\nIn the present book, however, it is with some astonishment that\ntowards the end of a volume notable for its clear reasoning and\ncommand of the facts, the reader is suddenly confronted with the\nconclusion that the metaphysic postulated by Prof. Bergson is a\ntrue one and one that has divine sanction. How Prof. Cailliet came\nto such a conclusion after convincingly demonstrating that the\nunconscious prejudice in question is simply a survival of the super-\nstitions of savage man, is a difficult problem.\nTh. B.\nPierre Villey, The World of the Blind (a Psychological Study).\nTranslated by Alys Hallard. 8vo, pp. 403. London : Duck-\nworth, 1930. Price 7s. 6d. net.\nM. Villey, though he has been completely blind since the age of\nfour and a half, is Professor of Literature at the University of Caen\nand is the author of a monumental work on Montaigne. The present\nbook, which has been awarded a prize by the French Academy of\nMoral and Political Science as the best work in recent years on the\npsychology of the blind, brings out clearly the qualities which have\nenabled its author to triumph over his disability. It is marked by\npsychological penetration, a deep knowledge of the literature of\nits subject, and, above all, by unsentimental common-sense.\n\fJanuary 1931 Revieivs 9\nFrom the point of view of psychical research chapters IV to VI\nare the most important. In these M. Villey shows that the possession\nby the blind of a sixth sense or supernormal faculty is merely a\npopular legend (a conclusion to which the reviewer has also come as\nthe result of experiments with blind children). Compensatory\nhyperaesthesia of the remaining senses M. Villey demonstrates to be\nnon-existent. The sense of obstacles is conclusively put down to\nminute sensory observations, and the alleged faculty of orientation\nis shown to be largely exaggerated, and, what there is of it, to be a\nfunction of the sense of obstacles plus muscular memory. M.\nVilley is to be congratulated on a very able, as well as sane and\nsensible piece of work.\nTh.

Price 60 fr.\nThis very fully documented study describes and analyses what\nmay be called the occult atmosphere of the half-century 1770-1820.\nSuch phenomena, for instance, as the spread of Swedenborgianism\nand Mesmerism are here for the first time placed in a proper historical\nperspective.

Price Lire 6.50.\nThe author has succeeded in compressing into a very small space\na comprehensive history and survey of most aspects of psychical\nresearch. He is a little indiscriminate in his choice of authorities\nand nowhere goes very deep below the surface, but in view of the\nspace available it is a very creditable performance. Signor Servadio\ngives a bibliography of over 200 items, and is up-to-date enough to\nannounce that the next Congress for Psychical Research will be held\nin London in 1932 on the occasion of the jubilee of the S.P.R.\nArthur Conan Doyle, The Edge of the Unknown. 8vo, pp. vii. 332.\nLondon : John Murray, 1930. Price 7s. 6d. net.\nSir Arthur here collected a number of articles on various aspects\nof spiritualism. His point of view and method of treatment are\ntoo well known to need explanation, but one cannot help feeling\nadmiration for the persistence with which Sir Arthur continued to\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1931\nadvocate the most hopeless causes. Thus, the first and longest of\nthese articles is one on Houdini, in which the writer still maintained\nhis conviction that the conjurer accomplished some of his feats with\nthe help of spirits. It is also a pleasure to welcome Sir Arthur's\nstatement that \" the unmasking of false mediums is our urgent duty\n\"\n(p. 7).\nE. J.

Price 2s. 6d. net.\nThis is an account of magic, divination, and beliefs in the super-\nnormal in the ancient world, with the chief emphasis on Egypt.\nThe field is covered very rapidly, but many points of interest are\nbrought out. Dr Dingwallnever fails in the important task of draw-\ning the reader's attention to the striking parallels between these\nancient beliefs and contemporary doctrines. His chief fault is a\nrather careless use of language. For instance, after writing of the\nfolklore of fox-elves, he continues (p. Sin.) :\n\" Stories of this sort\nare by no means confined to the realm of myth and fable. A striking\nexample was occurring in a private family only a few years ago in\nthe centre of London.\" Reading a bare statement of this kind the\nuninitiated student might well believe that the \" striking example\n\"\nis accepted by Dr Dingwall as a fact.\nA. A. Friedlander, Telepathie und Hellsehen. 8vo, pp. 89. Stutt-\ngart : F. Enke, 1930. Price M. 4.\nProfessor Friedlander is of the opinion that neither telepathy nor\nclairvoyance is true. To justify this view he does not criticise the\npublished evidence, but prefers to display a very pretty wit in\nmocking the follies of anthroposophy, popular prophecies, the\nphysical phenomenon, \" mental radiation \", and the like : every-\nthing, in short, but telepathy and clairvoyance. \u2122\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nRevue Metapsychique, September-October 1930.\nThis number opens with an article by Professor Charles Richet\non \" Long fastings \" a propos of Therese Neumann. Various cases\nof which many are very old (16th, 17th and 18th centuries) are cited,\nafter which M. Richet proceeds to describe two in his own experience.\nThough expressing doubts as to the trustworthiness of some obser-\nvations bearing on Therese Neumann (p. 386 footnote), he is of\nopinion that we must admit \" that paradoxical, unlikely, incredible\nand most absurd fact \" that Lavoisier's law as to animal heat being\nthe result of combustions of the carbon and hydrogen contained in\n\fJanuary 1931 Notes on Periodicals 11\nthe food stuffs absorbed is not without exceptions ; in consequence\nwe have here to deal, lie thinks, with a special physiology wholly\ndifferent from the normal one.\nM. Pascal has a lengthy and excellent paper on hypnotism, to\npart of which paper Dr Osty, the Editor, replies. Both agree that\nthe phenomena of hypnotism seem now to be on the wane ; but\nwhilst M. Pascal believes in a revival of the hypnotic researches,\nDr Osty thinks also possible in the future other (unspecified) methods\n\" which will put at the physician's disposal the profound resources\nof human psychism \". It will probably astonish some of my readers\nto hear that, as pointed out by M. Pascal, the very existence of\nhypnosis has been denied by some critics (Delmas et Boll, La\nPersonnalite humaine, 1922) !\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, November 1930.\nDr van Holthe tot Echten, a Dutch magistrate, describes apports\n(flowers and pebbles) which occurred in the presence of the medium\nMelzer, of Dresden, during his stay in Holland last year. One\nincident of the kind at least cannot be explained by Melzer cheating\nhimself, since he had already left the country ; but of course there\nmay have been other non-supernormal \" possibilities \".\nProfessor Bleuler has a paper on \" Occultism and its Critics \".\nIt is in fact a lengthy plaidoyer in favour both of the mental and of\nthe physical phenomena with special reference to the Schneiders.\nI agree with the writer when he says a propos of certain theories put\nforward to \" explain \" some of these phenomena that we have in\nthem \" occultism in disguise, not physics \" ; and I would specially\nmention in this connection, besides hyperaesthesia as used by the\nlate Dr Baerwald to account for alleged clairvoyance at close\nquarters (p. 658), the cosmic reservoir of memories hypothesis.\nDr Mattiesen brings to a close his paper on \" The Psychological\nAspect of Spuk \" : a mixtum comppsitum of hauntings, poltergeist\nperformances, and phantasms of the dead d la von Driesen-Pono-\nmareff (cp. Proceedings, x. 385). His conclusions are favourable to\nthe spiritistic theory, though he seems to admit that we may some-\ntimes postulate (supernormal) action on the part of the living as\nwell. The constant mention of extremely suspicious poltergeist\ncases by the side of episodes of a different character and probably\nor obviously genuine, however we explain them, is not calculated,\nI am afraid, to enhance the value of an otherwise interesting study.\nIs it permissible under the present German code to hypnotise in\na trial either the person accused or the witnesses and to use the\ninformation thus obtained ? Dr Werner Lucas discusses this\nquestion and answers it in the negative. Clairvoyants may however,\nhe maintains, be hypnotised and their statements made use of.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1931\nHerr Hans Hanig relates and discusses under the title of \" Tele-\npathy or Clairvoyance ?\n\" a case of the finding of a lost book, where\ninformation thought by him valuable was supplied by Frau Hessel\nof Leipzig ; and Dr Marcinowski describes the apparition of an\naunt seen by a friend of his three days before the lady's death.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, December 1930.\nDr Siinner, the Editor, describes some psychometric experiments\nof his in Berlin, with Otto Reimann, the Prague \" metagraphologist\".\nOne of these in particular dealing with Chinese writing would be no\ndoubt very striking if we could be sure that it was absolutely\nimpossible for Reimann to obtain the information given by him,\nby normal means ; but in spite of Dr Siinner's very positive asser-\ntions to the contrary, it is difficult to feel certain on this point.\nHerr Carl Vogl narrates four recent sittings with Frau Silbert\nwhich do not seem particularly instructive one way or the other.\nThe phenomena (intellectual and physical) which M. A. Konecny\nof Prague, observed in the same town of Graz with another\nmedium, Kordon by name, seem to me to suggest collusion very\nstrongly.\nDr Freudenberg describes a sitting with Karl Lowen, the 75 years\nold Bodenbach \" medium \". The latter gentleman is going to be\ncompelled by his circumstances, we are told, to exhibit himself in\na music hall : it is therefore to be presumed that his phenomena\nmay be susceptible of a normal explanation after all.\nfleinrich Freiherr Droste zu Hiilshoff describes\u2014at best at second\nor third hand\u2014an old case of haunting of a very \" orthodox\n\"\ncharacter. Dr A. Schmidt prints an account of the premonitory\ndream of his own death by drowning seen three days before by a\nCzechoslovakian schoolboy. The coincidence is certainly very\nstriking, though I am strongly inclined to consider it as purely\nfortuitous. It is very satisfactory that the case is as well authenti-\ncated as it could be.\nA propos of Mr Price's report on Rudi, Dr Bruck has a paper on\nboth Willy and Rudi Schneider and recalls some supposedly super-\nnormal phenomena he witnessed with them. That most suspicious\nof all physical phenomena, direct voices, is dealt with in a short\npaper by Herr Gustav Zeller.\nAn account is reproduced from the Siiddeutsche Sonntagspost\ndescribing how the whereabouts of the dead body of a Herr Pallitsch\nof Chemnitz, who had attempted to make the ascent of the Kramer-\nkreuz in the Bavarian mountains and had not come back, were\ndiscovered through a clairvoyant dream of Frau Pallitsch's (supple-\nmented by an experiment with a pendulum held by a gentleman of\nher acquaintance over a map). It is a great pity that there is in\n\fJanuary 1931 Notes on Periodicals 13\nGermany no organisation similar to the S.P.R. to substantiate the\nnewspaper account.\nHerr Albert Hellwig, the Potsdam Landgerichtsdirektor, is the\nsubject of some more vituperation, this time owing to his attitude\nwhen presiding over the Felzer trial which has just taken place at\nPotsdam. We wish on the contrary to express to him our sympathy\nin this connection.\nZeitschrift fur Metapsychische Forschung, February-September 1930.\nThis monthly review has taken the place of the defunct Zeitschrift\nfur psychische Forschung (of which the last number appeared in\nAugust 1929) and is edited by Dr Christoph Schroder of Berlin. The\ngeneral standpoint is to my liking much too \" positive,\" but it must\nbe admitted that the review contains many papers of interest. Here\nwe must content ourselves with noticing but a few of them.\nDr Schroder prints a further instalment of his paper on Metaplasma\nPhanomenih, in which he reviews the Margery case, and M. Josef\nSwitkowski's (of Lwow) astounding accounts dealing with alleged\n\" gradual condensations of apports.\" In an article on the so-called\nmango phenomenon he surveys Jacolliot's experiments with the\nfakir Covindasamy, an incident alleged to have occurred with Mrs\nd'Esperance in 1880 and testified to by a Mr Oxley, etc. The Jacol-\nliot observations are absolutely inexplicable, as described, by\nconjuring, and if not genuine imply deliberate lying. I believe the\nauthor of Le Spiritisme dans le monde : VInitiation et les Sciences\nOccultes dans VInde (Paris 1875, translated into English as Occult\nScience in India [London 1919]), to be regarded as quite untrust-\nworthy, but I am not quite aware on what grounds this opinion is\nbased ;\nperhaps one of our French members will be able to sub-\nstantiate it.\nTwo interesting cases bearing on the problem of \" spirit-identity\n' r\nare published. In the first (March number) a Herr Baumert\ndescribes some automatic messages received by himself and dealing\nwith relations said to have existed between Goethe and Lavater, the\nwell-known Swiss philosopher and \" physiognomist.\" The messages\nappear to have contained particulars unknown consciously to Herr\nBaumert and subsequently ascertained to be true. In the second\n(February number), a series of evidential communications with very\nprecise biographical data purporting to come from a German musician\nnamed Rochlitz (died 1842) was obtained in a circle in the course of\nseveral sittings, which name is certified by the sitters on oath to have\nbeen unknown to them. The episode is curious but seems to me to\nexemplify but too well the internal weaknesses inherent in cases of\nthis type.\nProfessor Messer describes (March number) a sitting given by the\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1931\nmedium Heinrich Melzer, of Dresden, at which, phenomena of what\nthe Professor calls \" possession \" occurred. They seem quite\nunevidential.\nDr Mattiesen discusses cross-correspondences and champions the\ntheory of their spiritistic origin (April, June and July numbers). An\naudacious and characteristic attempt to rehabilitate Anna Rothe,\nthe \" flower-medium \" who was thoroughly exposed in Germany\nat the beginning of the present century, is made by Dr Bertram,\n(April), who also describes (July, September) some cures achieved\nby \" animal magnetism \". In the April number also Herr Michal\nMares expresses a different view of the incident discussed by Count\nKlinckowstroem in Die Umschau (see Journal, xxvi. 162, and\nabove, p. 12).\nDr 0. Fischer, of Prague, has a paper (May, June, July numbers)\non Otto Reimann, the Prague \" metagraphologist \". Herr Herbert\nBaldus discusses (June) magic among certain Red Indian tribes of\nSouth America (chiefly Paraguay). The paper is attractive but any\ncases approximating to the S.P.R. standard are conspicuously\nabsent.\nProfessor Kasnacich, of Graz, has the beginning of what promises\nto be a very lengthy account of Frau Maria Silbert and her pheno-\nmena (July, September). His account is hardly calculated to dispel\nthe unfavourable impression produced on serious students of the\nsubject by the narratives of such observers as e.g. Dr Walter Prince\nand Mr Besterman.\nDr Karl Camillo Schneider has a paper (June number) on \" De-\nferred Telepathy \" (read at the Athens Congress) dealing with\nexperiments in telepathy between Vienna and Athens. Here again\nwe have to do with persistent attempts to interpret quite unsatis-\nfactory results as successes. Again we feel bound to protest categori-\ncally against such a tendency. Besides \" deferred \" telepathic\nimpressions, we also note in these Vienna-Athens experiments\n\" anticipated \" ones, which Dr Schneider thinks quite a \" novelty \".\nMany, of whom I am one, will consider these alleged \" anticipations\n\"\ncoupled with Dr Schneider's almost desperate attempts at inter-\npretation as nearly fatal to the reality of anything like genuine\nthought-transference in the series in question.\nHerr Heinrich Neugebauer, a former naval officer, describes\n(September) a fakir's seance at Singapore (on board ship) in October\n1885. At first Herr Neugebauer witnessed a successful performance\nof mango-tree growing, then he had the experiment repeated after\nsurreptitiously substituting sea water to the fresh water with which\nthe fakir was to sprinkle the \" growing \" plant. The experiment\nfailed, and the Indian, after having ascertained that the water was\nsalty, flew into a rage and ran away. Herr Neugebauer sees in this\n\f15\n> - \u00bb \u00bb l la's \u00bb>\u2022*.\u2022\u2022\u00bb \u00bb '\na proof that the \" phenomenon '\nin question was a \" natural \" one\n(here \" natural \" and genuine are of course almost synonymous)\nsince the use of salt water in most cases acts fatally on plant-\ngrowing.\nDer Morgen, 1930, Heft 1.\nProfessor Hans Driesch has a very valuable paper on \" Para-\npsychological Hypotheses.\" Only mental supernormal phenomena\nare dealt with. Our late President commences by briefly reviewing\nthe alleged facts and then enumerates the hypotheses put forward\nto account for them, beginning first with those which attempt to\n\" eliminate \" the facts themselves : chance-coincidence, fraud,\nfishing, unconscious indications, \" specially favoured (bevorziigte)\nreactions \" (by which is meant the tendency some people have to\nchoose a certain number or a certain colour, etc.), illusions of memory.\nThen come the \" positive \" theories : that of brain-waves, or, as\nProfessor Driesch prefers to call it, the broadcast or radiation\nhypothesis, the animistic hypotheses (Professor Driesch notes that\nthere are several of them), the \" World Consciousness \" and \" Life\nplanes \" theories, and Spiritism, which the writer thinks worthy of\nserious discussion. The two last sections of the paper deal with\nprophecy and psychometry. Whilst greatly admiring the masterly\nway in which the matter is presented and reviewed, I cannot help\nthinking the discussion of such theories as e.g. that of a \" World-\nConsciousness,\" premature. I also think prevision of the future far\nless established than the author seems to believe (p. 30) ; nor do I\nconsider that the evidence in favour of psychometry altogether\njustifies us in examining in detail the more or less bewildering\n\" positive \" theories put forward in connection with this, to Professor\nDriesch, \" the obscurest phenomenon of the whole of parapsycho-\nlogy,\" but which to my mind is not yet established on an incon-\ntrovertible basis of fact.\nLeipziger Illustrirte Zeitung, 20 November 1930, no. 4471.\nCount Klinckowstroem has a short but suggestive paper on\nmediums who confess their own frauds, beginning as far back as\n1882 and 1883 (Chapman, who, the writer says, helped Alfred\nFirman for many years, and Truesdell). We are reminded at the\nend that the notorious Kraus, with whom Dr von Schrenck-Notzing\nexperimented, and who was the subject, under the pseudonym of\nWeber, of a paper read by the Baron at the Paris Congress of 1927,\nand of a report by Mr Besterman in the Journal, xxiv. 388-92, has\nnot yet succeeded in publishing his detailed description of how he\nperformed his tricks. We trust it will be published. P.-P.-S.\n848519\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1931\nThe Aryan Path, January-December 1930.\nThis new periodical contains much of interest to students of\npsychical research. In the April issue are two brief articles on \" Psy-\nchical Research and Spiritualism : Two Points of View \", the\nformer being represented by Mr H. S. Redgrove, the latter by Mr\nD. Gow. Similar articles appear in the June number, Sir Lawrence\nJones writing on \" The Present Position of Psychical Research\n\"\nand Mr Gow on \" Spiritualism\u2014Forty Years After \", to which the\nEditors add an Afterword.

The Editors of this\nperiodical are concerned to maintain a lofty idealistic outlook on\nthings and affairs ;\nthey are critical both of psychical research and\nof spiritualism, though going further in their acceptance of super-\nnormal phenomena than most critical students of psychical research.\nTh.

A Committee to this end has\nbeen established and the following gentlemen have consented to\nserve :\nLord Charles Hope.\nSir Ernest Bennett, M.P.\nMr H. F. Prevost Battersby.\nMr J. W. Miller.\nMr H. Leitner.\nDr B. Fielding-Ould (Chairman).\n(Miss Phillimore, Secretary).\nThat there is an immense field open for scientific Besearch in\nPsychic Science cannot be disputed, and it was obvious that an\ninfluential organisation like the London Spiritualist Alliance could\nnot ignore its obligations in this direction.\nThe Committee have full power to carry on any research that\nseems promising, but is under the direct control of the L.S.A.\nCouncil in matters of finance and publicity.\nThe Proceedings of the Besearch Committee will be published in\nLight from time to time, and Beprints circulated to all the leading\nPsychic Societies in Europe and America.\nThe Secretary (as above) will always be glad to receive suggestions\nand any information in regard to mediums which will help the\nCommittee in its work.\nEven the most enthusiastic Spiritualist will agree that nothing\nbut good can accrue by turning the cold eye of science upon the\nelusive and mystifying phenomena in which he is deeply interested.\nCASE.\nP. 301. A Premonition.\nIt will be remembered that Miss Clarissa Miles, a valued Member\nof the Society, died in August last and that an obituary notice was\nprinted in the October Journal (xxvi. 116). We have to thank her\nsister, Mrs Geoffrey Lubbock (also a Member) for sending us the\nfollowing account of her sudden death and her anticipation that\nsomething was going to happen.\n\" Case of Premonition.\n\" My sister, Miss Clarissa Miles, lived for 22 years in a Flat in\nEgerton Gardens. The lease of this Flat terminated on the 14th\nAugust this year.\n\" For months she had told us of her glorious visions which to her,\nappeared to be, the end of the World in its present state, and the\napproach of the Spiritualizing of the World. My sister Mrs Kings-\n\fFebkuaby 1931 Case L9\ncote & I, had implored her to look for another residence, all last\nsummer, but she always responded '\nMy life is going to change, the\nFlat has served its purpose, & don't worry me as to what I am going\nto do, something will happen before then.'\n\" On Monday August 11th she had a stroke & she died on Wed.\nAug. 13th, the day before the lease of her Flat was up. Miss Edith\nHarper writes me : on the morning of the 11th she rang Miss Miles\nup on the telephone, & asked her where she was going when she left\nher Flat, she replied, '\nI hav'nt the least idea, I have made no plans\nwhatever.' She paused a moment and then added '\nI feel something\nis going to happen before then, yes something is going to happen\nalmost any time now.'\n\" [Signed] Marguerite Lubbock.\"\nThe evidence of two people is always better than one, and at our\nrequest Mrs Lubbock was good enough to ask Miss Harper (men-\ntioned above) if she would give us her account of what occurred,\nwhich she has very kindly done as follows :\n\" As desired, I willingly send you my recollection of my last con-\nversation with Miss Clarissa Miles. She was a very intimate friend\nand I was in close touch with her movements. I knew she had\ngiven up her flat in August but had made no arrangements for a\nfuture dwelling. On the morning of Monday 11th August this year\n[1930] my mother received a letter from her saying she had arranged\nto store her furniture and to leave the flat on the following Thursday\n(14th). She asked that I would ring her up and arrange to come\nto tea before then. I duly rang up, about 10 a.m. Miss Miles\nherself answered the telephone, and sounded quite cheerful. We\nfixed the following afternoon, Tuesday 12th, for my visit. I asked\nwhere she intended going on Thursday when she left the flat, and\nshe replied '\nI have not the very remotest idea. I have made no\nplans whatever,' or words to that effect, equally emphatic. She\nthen added :\n'\nI feel something is going to happen before then.' I\nmade some answer like '\nDo you ?\n'\nand she repeated in a tone of\ngreat finality '\nYes, I feel something is going to happen.' We talked\na little more and she told me to be sure to come next day. We then\nsaid Goodbye. That is the last time I have ever heard her voice.\nWhen I went next day to Egerton Gardens Miss Miles was quite\nunconscious, and she passed away on Wednesday 13th August, just\ntwo days after her talk with me on the telephone.\n\" Miss Miles frequently spoke of some great and wonderful event\nshe felt would happen very suddenly. She was wont to give a\nspiritual interpretation to most of the affairs of life, both everyday\nand national.\n\" [Signed] Edith K. Harper.\"\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1931\nIn reply to a suggestion that Miss Miles might have had sub-\nconsciously some vague perception of the state of health preceding\nthe stroke, Miss Harper wrote :\n\" I am perfectly sure that Miss Miles had no anticipation of her\nown immediate death. She was extremely active, never spared\nherself, and on at least one occasion shortly before her passing\ndeclared she never felt better in her life. I however noticed the\nlast time I saw her, sometime in July, that she looked tired. But\nmany people do, in hot summer weather, do they not. Her pro-\nphetic ideas always related to some great '\ncosmic '\nevent about to\nhappen, of which we were '\njust on the eve,' and she fitted current\nhappenings, personal and universal, '\ninto the picture.'\n\"\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1930.\nSpontaneous Phenomena. Various cases of spontaneous pheno-\nmena, both mental and physical, have been reported to the Officers\nof the Society during the year, and each case, as well as some cases\nreported in the Press, has been followed up so far as practicable.\nThe Council regret, however, that the number of cases of spontaneous\nmental phenomena received by the Society has shown a distinct\nfalling off in recent years. This is not the first occasion that the\nCouncil have had to record a decrease. It would seem that there\nare recurrent good and bad periods for spontaneous cases, and that\nthe present period is a bad one owing to the erroneous belief that\nit is no longer of scientific interest to collect and analyse cases of this\nkind, in view of the number that have already been collected and\nanalysed by the Society. Some of our Members and Associates may\nperhaps hold the view that the cases already collected are sufficient\nto establish telepathy or some other supernormal faculty, but this\nposition is far from being accepted by general scientific opinion.\nMoreover, even if there were general agreement that the cases\nalready collected were sufficient to prove, e.g. telepathy, it would\nstill be necessary to go on collecting them, both because evidence\nloses much of its cogency with the lapse of time and also because\nevery fresh case may throw some light on the psychology and modus\noperandi of supernormal faculties, of which little is at present known.\nAnother cause of the decrease may be that popular interest in these\ncases has been satiated by recent exploitation in the public press.\nDuring the year visits were made to four houses in various parts\nof London, and to one in Leicester, for the purpose of investigating\nalleged apparitions and noises. In none of these cases was there\nreason to suppose that any supernormal causes were at work.\nExperimental Work. A great deal of work has been done during\nthe past year in analysing the results of the experiments in telepathy\n\fFebruary, 1931 Annual Report of the Council for 1930 21\nand clairvoyance mentioned in the last two Annual Reports. The\nclairvoyance experiments had not been completed by the end of\n1929, as the results obtained by Professor Gardner Murphy had still\nto be received. Owing to the large number of percipients, both in\nthe United Kingdom and the United States, the analysis of the\nresults was a complicated work, in which the experimenters were\nagain fortunate enough to secure the advice of Dr R. A. Fisher,\nF.R.S., of Rothamsted, and Dr E. S. Pearson, of University College,\nLondon. The co-operation of members of the Boston S.P.R.\nbrought a most valuable addition to the experiment. Papers on\nthese experiments in clairvoyance and telepathy have been read by\nMiss Jephson and Mr Soal.\nMass experiments in telepathy and clairvoyance under strict con-\nditions are somewhat of a novelty, and the technique for conducting\nthem requires careful study. Among the objects of such experi-\nments may be mentioned (1) to test how widely the faculties of\ntelepathy and clairvoyance (assuming them to exist) are distributed ;\n(2) to determine the psychological elements such as preferences of\nvarious kinds present in normal individuals and allowance for which\nhas to be made in evaluating supposed supernormal phenomena ;\n(3) to discover individual percipients with powers sufficiently marked\nto justify their intensive investigation ; and (4) to provide some sort\nof check on other experiments conducted under less strict conditions.\nThese particular experiments did not give results indicating the\nexistence of any factor other than chance. Possibly the conditions\nenforced may not have been such as to encourage any supernormal\nfaculty existing among the percipients. Only by further experi-\nments can it be shown whether it is possible to devise a technique\nproviding adequate safeguards against normal leakage and at the\nsame time free from any inhibitive factor.\nMiss Jephson has, throughout the year, continued to carry out-\nfurther experiments with cards, with members of the Society and\nwith Mr Soal's group of percipients. In order to make the condi-\ntions as informal as possible, the experiments have been conducted\non several occasions in the form of games at parties given by Miss\nJephson, and also later by Mrs Worsfold.\nThe Council take this opportunity to thank all the numerous\nmembers and others who have taken part in these experiments, who\nhave helped in their organisation, or who have contributed towards\nthe expenses ;\nin particular, Dr Fisher, Dr Pearson, Professor\nGardner Murphy, and Dr Flugel.\nIn addition to group experiments, investigation of individuals\nwith marked powers is also desirable, and the Council hope that if\nMembers or Associates know of any persons who apparently possess\ntelepathic or clairvoyant powers in a marked degree and would be\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1931\nwilling to collaborate in further experiments, they will help the work\nby informing the Society.\nThe Council consider that at the present time experiments in\ntelepathy and clairvoyance offer the most promising line of research\nwork which the Society can pursue, and they hope that they will be\npursued with vigour.\nSittings with Mediums. During the year sittings have been held\nby officers of the Society, and also by members co-operating with\nthem, with various \" mental \" mediums, including several who are\nlittle known and some who have been brought to the Society's notice\nfor the first time during the year. Whenever the Officers of the\nSociety hear of a promising new medium in this country, sittings are\nat once obtained. In some cases, however, it is impossible for the\nSociety to get such access to the medium as would enable any useful\ninvestigation to be made.\nRecords of these sittings are preserved in the Society's files, and\nfrom time to time brief abstracts are printed in the Journal. But\nit has never been the Society's practice to publish in Proceedings\nreports of sittings which present no features that are either new in\ncharacter or of marked evidential value.\nFor help in investigating several of these mediums the Council\nwish to thank various members of the Society. One of the new\nmediums investigated (non-professional) presented matter for useful\ninvestigation of the trance state. Several sittings have already been\nheld with this medium and more are arranged for ; two medical\nmembers of the Society are co-operating with the Research Depart-\nment in the investigation.\nPreliminary work has been done in the Stance-room with a view\nto a systematic study (to be carried out in the immediate future) of\nthe psychology of testimony as applied to physical phenomena.\nThe Library. The grant from the Carnegie United Kingdom\nTrust is now in its fourth and last year. Chiefly with its aid the\nnumber of books and pamphlets in the Library has been approxi-\nmately doubled, and now stands at over 6900, an increase of over\n500 during the year. A further Supplement to the Catalogue, cover-\ning the period from October 1929 to December 1930 inclusive, will\nbe published early in 1931.\nA gratifying increase in the number of Members borrowing from\nthe Library and of books borrowed can again be reported : during\nthe year 99 Members borrowed 868 volumes, apart from a large\nnumber consulted in the Library. In addition 74 volumes were\nborrowed by the National Central Library, many more than last\nyear. For the first time Members exercised their privilege of bor-\nrowing from the National Central Library, through the Society,\nbooks not in the Society's Library, without restriction of subject.\n\fFebruary 1931 Annual Report of the Council for 1930 23\nThe Society was again represented by Mr Besterman at the\nAnnual Conference (at New College, Oxford) of the Association of\nSpecial Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB), to which the\nSociety is affiliated. During the year Mr Besterman was elected to\nthe Council of this body. Members are again reminded that as\nbooks can be obtained through the National Central Library, so can\ninformation be secured by Members through ASLIB, in each case\nwithout cost.\nPresident for 1930. Dr Walter Franklin Prince, the Research\nOfficer of the Boston Society for Psychic Research, was elected\nPresident for 1930. Dr Prince is one of the most experienced, per-\nsevering and distinguished students of psychical research now living\nand the Council look upon Dr Prince's presidency as further evidence\nof the cordial relations which have always existed between serious\npsychical researchers in the United Kingdom and the United States.\nThe Council wish to express their appreciation to Dr Prince for\nhaving come specially to England, in July, to deliver his Presidential\nAddress, which, has now been published as Part 115 of Proceedings,\nand re-issued with the Council's permission as a Bulletin of the\nBoston S.P.R.\nThe Athens Congress. The 4th International Congress for Psy-\nchical Research was held at Athens in April 1930, when the Society\nwas represented by Sir Oliver Lodge, the Hon. Treasurer, and the\nLibrarian and Editor.\nAt the Congress, which was highly successful, the representatives\nof the S.P.R. gave an invitation, which was unanimously accepted\nby the other delegates, that the next International Congress should\nbe held in London in the autumn of 1932, which year is the 50th\nanniversary of the foundation of the Society.\nIn giving this invitation the Society has undertaken a heavy\nresponsibility, and the Council hope that Members and Associates\nwill loyally co-operate in seeing that it is adequately discharged.\nThe Council have already appointed Committees for dealing both\nwith the business side of the Congress and the entertainment of\nvisitors, and also with the preparation of papers on those branches\nof psychical research in which our Society has taken a particular\ninterest.\nAt the Athens Congress the Society's representatives also under-\ntook the responsibility of getting the Transactions of that Congress\npublished in the United Kingdom. The Transactions, which were\nprepared for publication by Mr Besterman, were published in\nDecember at the price of 7\/6 and are now on sale. The Council\nhope that they will have a ready sale among Members and Associates\nso that the Society need have no apprehension of incurring any\nfinancial loss through undertaking to publish the volume. Generous\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1931\ncontributions have been received from Continental sources, and it is\nhoped that individual members of our Society will not be backward.\nChanges in the Council. The Council appointed Miss Jephson\n(previously a co-opted member) an elected member to fill the vacancy\ncreated by the resignation of Mr Feilding, recorded in the Annual\nReport for 1929.\nDr C. D. Broad of Trinity College, Cambridge, was co-opted a\nmember of Council.\nObituary. During the year the Society suffered a heavy loss in\nthe death of the Earl of Balfour, who had been a member since 1882.\nHe was President in 1893, and he was a vice-President from the\nformation of the Society to the time of his death.\nThe Council also regret to record the deaths of nineteen Members\nand Associates, including the following, who have been members for\na considerable time : Miss Louisa Bigg (who left the Society a legacy\nof \u00a3100), Sir Edward Brabrook, Miss L. E. Cotesworth, Miss Clarissa\nMiles, Miss Edith Shove, Dr Abraham Wallace and Madame\nYaraschenko.\nAttacks on the Society by Members. In January 1930 the late Sir\nArthur Conan Doyle, then a Member, addressed to all Members and\nAssociates a circular in which he announced that he had resigned\niiis membership of the Society owing to his disapproval of its alleged\nanti-spiritualist bias, and he invited other Members and Associates\nto follow his example by resigning and joining another organisation,\nwhich he named. The Council are glad to say that this attack on\nthe Society failed almost completely, only six Members and one\nAssociate, none of whom had ever taken an active part in the\nSociety's work, resigning on the ground of agreement with this\ncircular. Other attacks by other members in the public press and\nelsewhere have met with equally small success.\nMembership of the Society. The Council have, however, to record\na serious number of resignations for other reasons, in particular on\naccount of the general economic depression which, as is well-known,\nis affecting other Societies of all kinds. The total resignations taking\neffect between 1 January 1930 and 1 January 1931 amount to\neighty-four, viz. fifty-nine Members and twenty-five Associates. A\ngreat majority of those who gave any reason for their resignation\nmention financial stringency, long illness, residence abroad, etc.\nThe new Members elected number thirty-nine, and the Society\nnow (1 January 1931) has 586 Members and 368 Associates. As\nmentioned in last year's Report it is inevitable that the number of\nAssociates should decline so long as financial reasons compel the\nmaintenance of the rule of not electing new Associates.\nBut if the Society has suffered from the general depression, it\nmust be remembered that it is still reaping the benefit of the con-\n\fFebruary 1931 Annual Report of the Council for 1930 25\ntinued interest and co-operation of several hundred people outside\nthe Society who, ever since the Broadcast Experiment in 1928, have\nhelped in experimental work. It was this group which made pos-\nsible Mr Soal's prolonged series in long-distance telepathy, the ex-\nperiment with cards in sealed envelopes, and Miss Jephson's new\nseries.\nMr Price's Circulars. In October a Member of the Society, Mr\nHarry Price, wrote to the Council suggesting that an amalgamation\nshould take place between the S.P.R. and his \" National Laboratory\nof Psychical Research.\"\nBefore the Council had had time to reply to this proposal, Mr Price\ncirculated to the Members and Associates of the Society a copy of\nhis letter to the Council, together with voting papers (unnumbered\nand not requiring signatures) which they were asked to return. The\nCouncil consider as most improper this attempt to obtain the opinion\nof the general body of Members and Associates on a proposal which\nMr Price had submitted to the Council and which the Council in\naccordance with his request had under consideration. They do not\nintend to take any further notice of it. Mr Price's letter to the\nCouncil and the Council's reply have been printed in the Journal for\nDecember 1930. Mr Price has since issued a further circular, dated\n19 December. The Council feel it their duty to inform Members\nand Associates that in framing their reply to Mr Price's proposal\nthey took into consideration :\n(a) That the principles on which the Society was founded and in\naccordance with which it has always been carried on, do not admit\nof the kind of publicity practised and advocated by Mr Price.\n(b) That the greater part of his instruments and books are of\nlittle or no value for psychical research, whatever other value may\nattach to them.\n(c) That, far from any financial benefit accruing to the Society if\nthe proposal were accepted, the result might well be a serious loss.\nPrivacy of the Journal. In the Journal for June and July 1930\nthe Council caused a note to be printed, drawing attention to the\nprivate nature of the Journal, and expressing the hope that all\nMembers and Associates would co-operate with them in maintaining\nthis privacy. The Council were compelled to issue this appeal\nbecause of several instances in which matter printed in the Journal\nwas reprinted elsewhere without their consent. So long as the\nprivacy of the Journal is respected Members and Associates have the\nadvantage of reading records of sittings, reports of \" supernormal\n\"\nphenomena, etc., which the contributors often desire not to be made\npublic. It is also possible in a Journal, the circulation of which is\nconfined to readers with some knowledge of psychical research, to\nprint cases interesting in themselves but not always fully conform-\n\fO \u00a9 t>\n^ a Ol\n\u00a9 \u00a9 o\n00 \u00a9 \u00a9\n\u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9\nl> Ol CO\ntH r-i r-\\\nOinHOlMOHOO(MOWOO00O\u00ab5OO\ni-H i\u2014\nI\nH N O O N O O \u00a9 O O CO O N CO lO CO ^\nrH ,-H r-l rH i\u2014( l\u2014l i-H H H\nHCOMiflHiOOliMCliOCltOHtOOiflNCOCl\nC] l> -ri CO \u00a9 r-1 CO C-l H H rI i\u20141 ^ CO\ni-l CO tH i-H\n(O \u00a9\n\u00a9 CO\n\u00a9 \u00a9\n\u00a9 \u00a9\ni-H CO\nW)\n-\n\u00a3131\n6, 3 \u00a7\ns \u00b0 4~\na -5 a,\n5a\nft?\n\u00a71\nc o\nO 00\na\\ <^ \"\nK) ft, Co ft, 03 6h\nSO\ne\nft .-O\ng & -g |\n\u2022\"S S 5 e\ns ft; ft;\na\n=\n\u00ab B M -3\n~ a.\n1\n\u00a3 s\ng o\nIS 50 S\n&MOt33fc1\n^'V2Q,^,C;^^i^ft(0\nz - CM \u00a9 CO\n- f - \u00a9 - t\u2014 \u00a9 c\n- i-H\n\u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 z \u00a9 r D\nCO 3' H CM S 1\nrH CO CM CM\nC|)\nrH\nO O O 00 CO\n\u00a9 00 CO i-H\n\u00a9 \u00a9 CM \u00a9\n\u00a9 CO\nPI\ni O\n-\na\n:\n*\n-urn\no c\n- -\n5\u00ab\n5> f;\no 5\n''\na 3\no \u00a3 \u00a3 H c\nMft a 2ft\n5 O\nH m x\n2 G 2\n4S 3\nf-r ^\nCh f-i\n> 0\nOfflHO\nCM rH **\u00a9\nGO \u00a9 \u00a9 r-\n1\nCJ CI CO CO\n\u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9\nfa\noo :o o ' 1\no \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9\nrH CM CO ~# CM \u00a9\n\u2014\nCJ i-H CO \u00a9\n\u00a9 -\nCO i\u2014\nl\n\u00a9 \u00a9 rH 00\nCM CO CO fO\n\u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 ~\nHHH CO\no ft.\no o S\n>> >> C3\nCO ft l-s\nC| co\n.gi .\nft,\n&2\ng\n&0\n.

Muhl, Automatic Writing. 8vo, pp. xv. 214, 20 plates.\nDresden and Leipzig : Theodor Steinkopff, 1930. Price 12s. 6d.\nThe author of this book (which, though published in Germany, is\nwritten in English), was formerly an assistant physician at St\nElizabeth's (Psychiatric) Hospital, Washington. She has made a\nspecial study of the use of automatic writing for therapeutic pur-\nposes, as a means of evoking forgotten memories and associations.\nIt is evident from the reports she gives of some of her cases that this\nmethod can be practised with good results, though Dr Muhl gives a\ntimely warning against its indiscriminate use without proper super-\nvision. According to Dr Muhl's experience the habit of writing\n* General Meetings.\n\fFebruary 1931 Review 31\nautomatically can be induced in the great majority of cases (includ-\ning persons in normal health of mind and body) by regular practice\nunder favourable conditions : in some cases automatism is best in-\nduced by complete rest and quietude, in others by setting the subject\nto read aloud, thus distracting the normal consciousness.\nThe examples quoted and discussed by Dr Muhl, though of con-\nsiderable psychological interest, have little relation to the experi-\nments in automatic writing carried out in recent years by the S.P.R.\nThis is made clear by the statement on p. 22 that \" the material\nproduced ... is endogenous.\" That this statement is true in a\ngreat majority of cases no student of automatism is likely to deny,\nbut on the other hand there is a small residue in which the evidence\nfor some extraneous influence of a supernormal character (probably\ntelepathic) is exceedingly strong. Dr Muhl would be hard put to it\nto fit into her preconceived framework the whole of the trance-\nwritings, let us say, of Mrs Piper, to which, curiously enough, she\nmakes no reference.\nIt is of some interest to observe that, generally speaking, the\nwritings discussed by Dr Muhl differ markedly in character from\nthose in which there is good evidence of supernormal faculty :\naccording to her own statement (p. 97) their two principal sources\nof origin are \" 1. Phantasy, and 2. Actual Recall.\" Actual recall,\nthat is, recall of past incidents and memories in the life of the auto-\nmatist, seems to play an almost negligible part in writings of the\nsupernormal type, and phantasy of the simple, obvious, fairy-tale\nkind described by Dr Muhl, has only a minor role, though it does\nundoubtedly intrude at times. Examples are to be found in some\nof the material from Mrs Piper's trance-writings quoted by Mrs\nSidgwick in her paper on \" The Psychology of Mrs Piper's Trance-\nPhenomena \" {Proceedings, xxviii), or again, in my mother, Mrs*\nVerrall's discussion of her automatic writing, especially in the\nreferences to the \" Isles of the Blest \" (Proceedings, xx. 112-8). I\nbelieve that if it were possible to classify all automatic writings\naccording to (a) the amount of purely subjective phantasy they\ncontained, and (b) the evidence they offered for any supernormal\nfaculty, these two elements would be found to occur in inverse\nproportion.\nThe obvious points of analogy and difference between Dr Muhl's\nexamples of automatism and those discussed in our Proceedings\nsuggest various interesting experiments which might be attempted\nby the future student of these subjects. For instance, a good auto-\nmatist of the supernormal type might be induced by Dr Muhl's\nmethods to let himself (or herself) go along the lines of phantasy,\nwith the object of comparing the two kinds of automatic material\nthus obtained from the same immediate source. The same auto-\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1031\nmatist (if possessed of sufficient strength and patience !) might also\nbe subjected to enquiry by other methods of psycho-analysis. In\nthe present state of our knowledge such experiments offer obvious\ndifficulties. It is to be hoped that the psychologist of the future\nmay be better equipped.\nIn the meantime such researches as Dr Miihl has carried out are\nuseful in their own field. Incidentally some of the writings she\nquotes have a certain naive and childish charm, and there are some\nautomatic drawings, which though of little artistic value, are\nvigorous and expressive.\nH. de G. S.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nBulletin du Conseil de Reciterches Metapsychiques de Belgique.\nOctober 1930.\nThis number opens with a lengthy paper 'by the President, discuss-\ning \" Unconsciousness, Tropism, Instinct, Intelligence, the Sub-\nconscious, the Superconscious, Intuition, Conscience \" : a long and\nimpressive array.\nM. Rutot speaks further of the Vandermeulen apparatus. Many\n\" messages \" received through the Ouija board in connection with\nthe ringing (Journal, October 1930, pp. 127-128) are reproduced\nverbatim. These are\u2014let us speak plainly\n\u2014\nvery stupid and not in\nthe least calculated to enhance the interest which might be felt in\nthe apparatus outside a few very small groups. This regrettable\ncircumstance ought not however to obscure the chief issue : how is\nthe ringing itself to be explained ? It is for specialists only to\nanswer this question.\nIn a short paper on \" scientific metagnomy \" the same author\ndescribes psychometric experiments with a Mme Lagrange. It is\ncharacteristic that M. Rutot thinks thought-transference was ex-\ncluded because in his conscious mind there was only knowledge\nbearing on the object, its age, origin, etc., which elements Mme\nLagrange did not detect, whilst she saw the ambiance of the object\nand was at times able to \" represent its ancient owner's sensations.\"\nAs if a clairvoyant could not, we may imagine, abundantly adorn\nwith his (her) fancy a nucleus telepathically transmitted and per-\nceived without becoming aware of some of the data ! However this\nconsideration is of a general and purely theoretical character : in\nthe present case I do not at all feel inclined to postulate any super-\nnormal hypothesis.\nP.-P.-S.\n\fNo. 473 \u2014Vol. XXVII.

Ed.]\nThe Annual General Meeting of Members of the Society was held in\nthe Society's Library at 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C.I, on\nThursday, 26 February 1931, at 3.30 p.m., Sir Oliver Lodge in the\nchair.\nThe Annual Statement of Accounts and Balance Sheet, and the\nBeport of the Council, were taken as read and adopted by the meeting.\nThe retiring Members of Council were re-elected.\nc\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1931\nMessrs Hartleys, Wilkins, Avery and Flew were elected Auditors\nfor the year 1931.\nMr Dingwall moved the following Resolution :\n\" That this\nMeeting views with grave concern the decline in the prestige of the\nSociety both at home and abroad, and is of the opinion that a change\nin the administration is desirable.\"\nThis Resolution was also signed by Mr G. B. Brown, Mrs J.

These meetings will provide\nopportunity for the usual formal papers, and also for informal ad-\ndresses and conversaziones. Notices of the meetings will be printed\nas usual in the Journal, and it will be advisable always to consult\nthese, as special additional meetings may be arranged from time to\ntime.\nMembers and Associates are particularly asked to note that all\nfuture meetings (unless specific notice to the contrary is given) will\nbe held at 5.30 p.m. on the last Wednesday of each month. Tea will\nbe served from 4.30, to which Members and Associates are invited.\nCASE.\nL. 1295.\nApparition of a Relative seen at the Time of her Death.\nProfessor W. W. Grundy, a Member of the Society, very kindly\nsent us, in a letter dated 17 November 1930, some particulars of an\napparition seen on the 15th of the same month by his sister-in-law,\nAvho was at the time staying in his house. He wrote, in part\n:\n\fMarch 1931 Case 35\n\" On Saty. last (Nov. 15) my wife was upstairs in bed with a cold.\nI was out of doors somewhere and my wife's sister was quietly\nreading a novel downstairs, awaiting tea.

The wire contained\nno mention of time : merely stated '\nThis afternoon.']\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1931\nTwo confirmatory statements were also obtained ; one is from\nMrs Grundy, the sister of the percipient, and is dated 5 December\n1930 :\n\" On Saturday, Nov. 15th 1930, my aunt who lived at Aberyst-\nwyth, passed away and at 7.30 p.m. the same day I received at the\nabove address a telegram to that effect\u2014not however stating the\ntime or hour of the passing.\n\" My sister, Gwen, who was staying with me at the time on hearing\nthe news asked '\nIs the time given ? I had an idea that she passed\naway at about 4.45 (p.m.) but I did not want to worry you then.'\n\" In a letter which arrived on Monday, Nov. 17th the time was\ngiven as 4.45 p.m. on the Saturday. I certify the above to be a true\naccount.\n\" [Signed] J. H. Grundy.\"\nThe second corroborative statement is from Professor Grundy and\nis dated 19 December 1930 :\n\" I hereby certify that both accounts to my knowledge strictly\ncorrespond to the facts except that (as noted on her letter) my\nsister-in-law was incorrect in stating that the time of death was\nmentioned on the telegram. It was however mentioned in a letter\nreceived on Monday morning Nov. 17th.\n\" I may add, for what it is worth one way or the other, that my\nsister-in-law in another letter states that this is not her only experi-\nence of a vision.\n\" She once had an equally clear vision of an absent friend\u2014then\nand still happily alive with us.\n\" [Signed] W. W. Grundy.\"\nIt will be noted that the weakness of this case lies in the fact that\nthe vision was not narrated until after the receipt of the telegram\nannouncing the death. On the other hand, we have adequate\nevidence that the exact time of the death was given before the arrival\nof the letter in which the time was mentioned. It is unfortunate\nthat, as we are informed by Professor Grundy, the telegram was not\npreserved, since proof that the time of the death was not mentioned\nin it is thus absent. But it is difficult to suppose that Professor\nand Mrs Grundy should be mistaken about such a matter so soon\nafter the event, especially as Professor Grundy repeats in a later\nletter that he is quite clear on this point.\n\fMarch 1931 Correspondence 37\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nAn Indian Fortune-Teller's Trick.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014The following account of a trick played on me by an Indian\nfortune-teller may amuse your readers.\nAccording to his own account, he spoke no languages but English\n(very imperfectly) and \" Sanskrit \" and had recently arrived from\nSouth Africa. After telling me to write down my name, and reading\nit when written, he examined the palms of my hands attentively and\nthen proceeded to give accurate details of my affairs {e.g. year of\nbirth, number of brothers and sisters, salary, etc.). Most of these\nhe could have learnt from the Civil Service List and from local\ngossip, but not all. He also told me that I had an enemy in my own\noffice (a fairly true statement about anyone in any office). He\nseemed to rely largely on \" fishing \" and I am glad to say appeared\nto find it particularly unprofitable, as he sweated profusely, darted\npiercing glances at me out of a pair of very shrewd eyes, and com-\nplained several times that I was evidently much accustomed to\nfortune tellers (which is however not a fact).\nHe then told me to wash my hands, which I did thoroughly, using\nsoap and a nail brush. He did not after that touch the palms of\nmy hands which I kept clenched and resting on my thighs. After\nabout five minutes in this position which he employed in reciting a\nrigmarole (referred to comprehensively as, \" I pray the God for\nyou \"), he told me to open my hands, which I did and found the\nfigures 81, 111 printed (in what looked like printer's ink) across the\npalm of my right hand.\nHe was ecstatic and rapturously announced that this number\nreferred to the number of \" gold pieces \" which I was to acqiiire in\nJune 1931, (had he the \" Calcutta Sweep \" in mind perchance ?).\nAfter my first surprise, it dawned on me that a combination of\n8 and 1 is the only combination that can be printed from a positive\nand still make sense, whichever way you read it. I assumed that\nhe must have written the figures on his own finger in some sort of\ninvisible ink, impressed it on my palm during the hand-reading\nepisode, and that the hand washing acted as a developer (not an\ninstantaneous one, however, since there was nothing on my hand\nvisible when I dried them). But why a man with such a good trick\nas that at his disposal did not learn to write figures in the negative\nI cannot understand. Possibly this is the essential difference\nbetween East and West.\nTo my great annoyance he rubbed out the figures from my palm\nwith one stroke of his finger. In spite of his obvious \" fishing \" and\ngeneral trickiness, I am convinced that this man displayed a certain\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1931\npower of mind reading. The evidence is unfortunately too essentially\npersonal to be made known to others.\nThis fact of subjective conviction of the truth of supernormal\nphenomena which apparently convey information much too private\nto be proclaimed coram publico is one of the great drawbacks in\nPsychical Research, it appears to me. Yet such evidence cannot be\nneglected. Yours, etc.,\nG. E. M. Miller.\nREVIEWS.\nH. A. Dallas, Human Survival and its Implications, pp. 70. Rev.\nC.

Price Is. each.\nThis is a useful set of handbooks for inquirers. Miss Dallas is an\ninvestigator of long experience, and she gives much wise advice. It\nis well to read extensively before seeking personal experience, and\nwhen investigation is begun, critical scrutiny of facts and inferences\nis essential. Stress is laid on the importance of spontaneous pheno-\nmena such as those described in Sir William Barrett's book, Death-\nBed Visions, and many apposite quotations are given from the works\nof Myers, Lodge, Richet, Crookes, and other workers. Consideration\nis given to the various descriptions of other-side conditions, but it is\nmade clear that there are many possible interpretations of what\nis said. On the religious side it is shown by extracts from letters\nthat in many cases the study of psychical phenomena has brought\nmany people back to the religious view of life, after a period of doubt\nor disbelief ; and at the same time it is pointed out that there is\nnothing in psychical research facts or inferences that is inharmonious\nwith present-day science. Miss Dallas's contribution, though written\nfrom the standpoint of one who is convinced of survival and com-\nmunication, is a sane and balanced presentation of the case in its\ngeneral aspects and without the detailed evidence which appears in\nother booklets of the series.\nMr Drayton Thomas leads up from non-spiritistic clairvoyance,\npsychometry, subliminal writing, and the like, to mediumistic\nphenomena in which the agency is claimed to be a discarnate human\nbeing. He gives illustrations of the kind of phenomena observed in\neach of the departments, and is specially interesting when dealing\nwith communications purporting to come from his father and sister,\n\fMarch 1931 Revietvs\nin a long series of sittings. Readers of Mr Thomas's other books, in\nwhich more detail is possible, will remember that the evidence from\nhis communicators is extensive and weighty. On the side of inter-\npretation, Mr Thomas goes rather far when he says of the subliminal\nmind that it is the \" area wherein all forgotten memories are stored\n\"\n(p. 13). All will agree that the evidence points to the conclusion that\nsubliminal memory is wider than supraliminal memory, but to\nassume that all forgotten memories are subliminally stored seems\nrather venturesome, though it has been frequently done since\nT. J. Hudson set the fashion. However, no doubt Mr Thomas\nwishes to be fair and even generous to opponents of the spiritistic\nhypothesis, and he makes them a present of subliminal potencies\nwhich are not proved but will come in useful. He rightly warns\nautomatic writers against taking their script seriously unless it\ncontains verifiable facts unknown to them ; and he discounts the\ninspirational speaking which is so common at spiritualistic meetings\nbut which does not seem to go beyond the possibilities of the\nspeaker's own mind. Most of us will agree heartily that if the\nspeaker had prepared something with conscious attention it might\nhave been better than the \" inspirational \" sounding periods which\nseemed to contain very little meaning. But Mr Thomas makes it\nclear that he regards the belief in discarnate human agency as a\njustifiable inference from some of the evidence.\nThe third booklet is a compilation of facts and conclusions\nregarding dowsing, raps, telekinesis, hauntings, apports, direct\nvoice, materialisation, with quotations from Richet, Schrenck-\nNotzing, Osty, Geley, Crawford, the Proceedings of the S.P.R. and\nso on. Mr De Brath has had a wide experience of this side of the\nsubject, and is specially interesting when he describes his results in\npsychic photography, when he took his own camera and obtained\nextras which convinced him of some supernormal agency. He gives\na handy summary of the Margery case, particularly the thumb-print\nevidence. On the philosophic side he regards the universe as made\nup of matter, energy, and mind ; a human being is made up of body,\nsoid and spirit. The outcome of psychical research is an extension\nof knowledge ; its results are not inharmonious with the already\nknown.\nMiss Macgregor and Miss Underhill give practical advice to\nbeginners as to the method of development by sitting in circles, by\nusing the crystal, planchette, and the like. They do not say much\nthat will be new to our members, but the information, advice, and\nwarnings given will be useful to those who have not previously read\nor investigated.\nSir Oliver Lodge points out the interesting and suggestive analogy\nbetween magnetism and matter on the one hand, and life and matter\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1S3I\n\u2014mind and body\u2014on the other. Magnetism can exist apart from\nmatter, but without matter it can make no sign to us ; we are aware\nof electricity and magnetism by their effects on the matter of a\nfilament or galvanometer or iron filings and the like. Life and mind\nmanifest themselves to us through matter, but may exist apart from\nit. Survival is demonstrated, though not yet recognised by \"all\nscientific men. When mind is recognised generally as so existing,\nit will revohitionise biology and must have a potent effect on\nscience. Philosophy cannot explain the relation of mind and matter\nby attending to matter alone. It concerns itself with the whole of\nknowledge, and must take all the facts and conclusions of science\ninto account. Psychical evidence indicates not only survival but\nthe survival of memory and the full personality. The universe is\none, and the division between this life and the next is an artificial\none, due to our limitations. Experience in the next stage, though\nno doubt still limited by an ether-body or space-body which is not\nmatter, will be as real as experience is now. Religion is the reaction\nof an intelligent person to the conception which the person has been\nable to form concerning the meaning and cause of existence (p. 26).\nIf minds are real, and we survive, the door is open to rational belief\nin other and higher intelligences, to the existence of a spiritual\nworld. Christ was a lofty Being who came down to reveal more of\nGod to men. Psychical evidence proves the preamble of all religions,\nas Myers said, and it is in harmony with the essentials of Christianity.\nIt is impossible to review adequately, in the space available, this\nprofound and far-reaching though simply expressed statement of\nthe case. Students must read it for themselves.\nJ. A. H.\nT. K. Oesterreich, Das Madchen aus der Fremde. Bin Fall von\nStorung der PersonlicKkeil. 8vo, pp. xii. 178. Beitrage zur\nPhilosophic und Psychologie (Heft 5) : Stuttgart 1929. Price\nM. 7.50.\nProfessor Oesterreich gives a very lucid and exhaustive account\nof a remarkable case of disturbance of the personality. It is the\ncase of a German girl of the lower classes who, after an almost tragic\nlife (the account of which in her own words, here faithfully repro-\nduced, is pathetic in the extreme), was taken up by the Stuttgart\npolice in a helpless condition. She was unable to speak or under-\nstand any language accessible to the combined philological and\nlinguistic resources of the authorities. She wore her hair in a pseudo \u2022\nOriental style, and her whole appearance and behaviour (e.g.\nmanner of eating) gave a similar impression. She practised a pecu-\nliar Buddha cult, unrecognisable as any known to students of the\nsubject.\n\fMarch 1931 Reviews 41\nFortunately, after being doubtfully treated in a charitable insti-\ntution, and driven from pillar to post by the police, she fell into\nkindly hands. Her behaviour and beliefs were carefully studied and\nrecorded, and her language was taken down. For many months the\nmystery was unsolved, making a nine days' journalistic wonder, and\nmight have remained unsolved but that one day the girl announced\nin writing that she was German and could speak and understand\nGerman. Then the psychologists came on the scene, and gradually\nthe whole of this strange case of dissociation was explained.\nThe peculiar interest of this case lies in the fact that it was possible\nto trace back nearly all the elements of the girl's fugue to their\ncauses, and finally to diagnose the case as one of compulsion neurosis.\nThe dissociative assumption of a pseudo-Oriental role was the result\nof a very strong desire, no doubt engendered by an unhappy home,\nto run away with some gypsies who in her early childhood had put\nup their tents for fourteen days near her home, during which time\nshe had spent many hours with them. There was also an anti-\nGerman feeling, due to the contempt in which, as a German, she had\nbeen held in her Swiss childhood. The mysterious Buddha cult was\nclearly shown to have been the result of the grafting of a suggestion\n(the showing of a statuette of the Buddha in the early days of her\nhighly suggestible dissociative condition at Stuttgart) on to a strong,\nthough unorthodox, Boman Catholic feeling. The incomprehensible\nlanguage was explained in the same way as that of Helene Smith :\nit was a re-arrangement and distortion of her own German with a\nfew foreign elements picked up during her childhood in Switzerland.\nThus the words with which she addressed the Buddha were batuu\nnustree=pater nosier. In the following also note the similarity in\nsound : rische=Reis (rice), borum = Parfiim (perfume). In the next\nexamples we have simply artificial prolongation : iwengo = ich (I,\nin dialect only the first letter is pronounced), ermio = er (he). Echoes\nfrom foreign languages : ferrovjia = railway (Italian), beschtru =knife\n(Spanish bisturi).\nAll this is of great interest to psychical research as presenting not\na few parallels with certain phenomena observed with mediumistic\nControls. But even more significant from this point of view are\ncertain negative aspects of this case. It does not appear that the\nslightest trace of anything supernormal was observed in it. But is\nit not a legitimate reflection that if this girl had fallen into the hands\nof such spiritualists as those Helene Smith came into contact with,\ninstead of into those of people interested in the East, she would\nprobably have adopted some form of spiritualistic disguise (not\nconsciously, of course) instead of a pseudo-Oriental one ?\nProfessor Oesterreich is to be congratulated on a most able,\npatient and useful piece of work. Theodore Besterman.\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1931\nEinfiihrung in die neuere Psychologic, edited by E. Saupe. Oster-\nwieck-Harz : A. W. Zickfeldt, 1931. Price M. 10.\nTo the new edition of the above work Professor Oesterreich has\ncontributed an article on psychical research, with special reference\nto experiments conducted in institutions of university status. At\nfirst sight this would appear to narrow the field almost to extinction.\nBut Professor Oesterreich has succeeded in covering the ground\nfairly exhaustively by including accounts of work done by professors\noutside their universities. Professor Oesterreich seldom commits\nhimself, but it is clear that he accepts the mental phenomena\n(including psychometry) and also many of the physical phenomena.\nThus he appears to accept the genuineness of Willi Schneider's\nphenomena (pp. 445-6), and to be very sympathetically inclined\ntowards the Goligher and Margery mediumships (pp. 447-8).\nProfessor Oesterreich also enters into theoretical discussions of both\nthe mental and the physical phenomena, but it appears to be\nimpossible to throw much light on the subject, in view of the very\nsmall number of phenomena which are generally accepted even by\nstudents of psychical research.\nProfessor Oesterreich laments the apparent impossibility of estab-\nlishing a German S.P.K., and puts it down to lack of funds. The\ndesirability of such a society cannot be too strongly stressed. There\nis in Germany no lack of able investigators and of material for in-\nvestigation. It is difficult to believe that the necessary monies\nwould not be forthcoming if the investigators themselves could be\nbrought together. After all, in the early days of the S.P.R. the\nmembership was very small and the funds still smaller : it was the\nsingle-minded and laborious co-operation of a group of investigators\nwhich successfully established the Society on a permanent basis.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nPsychic Research, November 1930.\nIn Proceedings for May 1929 (xxxviii. 399-408) I published a\nreview of the Margery cross-correspondences, in which I criticised\nat some length the account of them published in Psychic Research\nby Dr Richardson. After an interval of eighteen months Mr Bligh\nBond has printed in the present issue an article entitled \" Varieties\nof Cross Correspondence,\" in which he states that my criticisms are\nthe only ones \" remaining until now unanswered \" ; and he then\nproceeds to enumerate certain points in my review.\nFirst (I adopt Mr Bond's numbering) he says that he is unable to\nagree with \" the suggestion that there is a remote resemblance\n\"\nbetween the S.P.R. cross-correspondences and those published in\n\fMarch 1931 Notes on Periodicals 43\nconnection with the Margery mediumship. What I suggested was\nprecisely the contrary. I wrote (loc. cit., p. 400) :\n\" It is proper to\npoint out at the outset that the Margery cross-correspondences are\nvery different from those of the S.P.R.\"\nSecond, Mr Bond says that he has no interest in \" the further\nsuggestion that criticism of work done outside the S.P.R. should be\nas unsparing as that aimed at the work done within the Society\n\"\nuntil \" this writer [that is, Th. B.] applies exactly the same sort of\ncriticism [Mr Bond's italics] to the work of members of the S.P.R.\nwhose position with regard to their Society is the same as that of\nour own group of '\nMargery '\ninvestigators in relation to the Ameri-\ncan S.P.R.\" This remark is meaningless under present circum-\nstances, but I assure Mr Bond that if the time should ever come when\nmembers of the S.P.R., however distinguished, print in our publica-\ntions reports even remotely comparable in weakness to that published\nby Dr Richardson of the Margery cross-correspondences, I shall\nimhesitatingly apply to them \" exactly the same sort of criticism\n\"\nas I applied to the Margery phenomena.\nThird , Mr Bond writes : \"It must be obvious to any unprejudiced\nreader . . . that it was Dr Richardson's aim so to order matters that\nthe question of bona fides should not arise. In this he succeeded.\"\nWhat Mr Bond says was certainly \" obvious \" to me, since it was\nthe chief object of my review to emphasise this very fact and to\nshow that Dr Richardson had failed in his aim. Mr Bond, on the\nother hand, dogmatically asseverates that Dr Richardson succeeded.\nMr Bond may be right, but my view, at least, is not dogmatic, but\nwas arrived at after a close analysis of the published evidence.\nFourth, Mr Bond quotes my statement (loc. cit., p. 402) that \" it\nis quite impossible, by any such procedure [that is, by the supposed\npost-hypnotic influencing of Margery by her Control Walter], to\nprove the independence of Walter \" ; and he observes :\n\" No such\nclaim had been made on the basis of the evidence presented at that\nstage. The criticism is therefore irrelevant.\" Mr Bond may be right,\nbut what Dr Richardson himself wrote in the report I was reviewing\n(Psychic Research, xxii. 256) was that \" if we really succeed in prov-\ning post-hypnotic influencing of Margery by Walter, we shall have\ngone a very long way indeed towards proof of Walter's independence.\"\nHis fifth point Mr Bond divides into three parts : (a) is a reply\nto my remarks on the obscurities in the original text in regard to\nthe time of a sitting and to the time of despatch of a telegram\nreporting that sitting. Mr Bond states that the time of despatch\nis shown on the original telegram. If that is the case I can only\nregret that the original telegram has not been reproduced either in\nthe report I had before me or since, and that the information now\ngiven by Mr Bond was not given in the original report.\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1931\nNext, in (6) Mr Bond proceeds, in his own words, to administer\nhis final kick to \" this very dead horse.\" In Dr Richardson's report\nit was stated that an automatic script of five letters and one figure,\nproduced in a meaningless way on two sheets of paper, was, in the\ntelegram reporting that script ,\nput together in such a way as to make\nsense in itself and also in connection with scripts produced elsewhere.\nI remarked on the strangeness of reporting the script telegraphically\n\" by starting with the lower part of the first sheet, proceeding to the\nsecond, and concluding with the top part of the first.\" Mr Bond\nreplies that this was the order in which the medium (in trance)\nwrote the message. This fact is strange in itself, but I will of course\naccept Mr Bond's statement if it is so set down in the original\nrecord of the sitting. And I reiterate my regret that this important\nfact was not disclosed in the report I had before me (nor elsewhere\ntill now).\nFinally, in (c) Mr Bond answers my suggestion that what is\nreported in the article I had under review as intended for a multi-\nplication sign might, if necessary, have been taken for a plus sign,\nby declaring that the \" diagram was not interpretable as the '\nPlus\n'\nsign as he [Th. B.] would know if he had seen it.\" I accept Mr Bond's\nstatement, and once more reiterate my regret that I, in common\nwith other readers, was not given the opportunity of seeing a repro-\nduction of the diagram, since it neither appeared in the report I had\nbefore me nor has appeared since.\nIn short, in each of his specific criticisms Mr Bond complains that\nI did not take into account evidence which he knows it was im-\npossible for me to take into account, since it was, and remains,\nunpublished.\nHaving concluded his five points Mr Bond adds further criticisms\nunder the heading \" Some Modern Mediums,\" referring to my book\nof that name. I am not here concerned, of course, with Mr Bond's\nremarks on that book as such. But in his observations he refers to\ntwo further criticisms of mine of the Margery cross-correspondences,\nthese criticisms also having originally appeared as part of the\nabove-mentioned review in Proceedings, and these I must therefore\ndeal with. Mr Bond complains that my statement with regard to a\nparticular sitting that \" the box was opened at the sitting and the\nlights turned out,\" is untrue, and he adds that I do not give the\nreference to the source of this statement. I do not know why Mr\nBond should, on this particular point, quote from my book and not\nfrom my original review, unless it is because in Proceedings he would\nhave found that I do give two exact references, and that at the\nsecond reference Dr Richardson wrote :\n\" J. H. Brown had charge\nof the box of cards. He removed the paper covering just before the\nlights were turned off. ...\" It is true that at the first reference the\n\fMarch 1931 Notes on Periodicals 45\nlight is stated to have been first turned off, and if the word \" and\n\"\nin the sentence quoted can be held to imply a sequence of events,\nthen I freely admit that I was guilty of a half-inaccuracy, due to\ndirectly contradictory statements by Dr Richardson.\nMr Bond sees fit to make great play with my criticism of the\nsuppression of the identity of Captain X, in connection with which\nI pointed out that Captain X (on whom, a crucial cross-corres-\npondence experiment rests) is one and the same person as a gentle-\nman on whom also the case for the Margery thumbprints largely\nrests. This statement showed that I was aware of the real identity\nof Captain X, and Mr Bond indignantly remarks that I was careful\n\" not to reveal it [the real name] to his readers.\" Captain X's name\nwas given to me by Dr Crandon during his visit to London in 1927,\nand as the name had not been published in the meanwhile I clearly\nhad no right to publish it myself. What would Mr Bond have said\nhad I committed so flagrant a breach of confidence ?\nI would point out in conclusion that Mr Bond has selected these\nfew points from the large number brought forward in my review,\nand that he makes no attempt to answer the remaining points nor\nto meet the case I made as a whole. Theodore Besterman.\nRevue Metapsychique, November-December 1930.\nThis number begins with an obituary article by Dr Osty on\nProfessor Santoliquido, President of the Institut Metapsychique\nInternational.\nM. C. de Vesme has the beginning of a paper on stigmatised\npersons in the past. The case of St Veronica Guiliana (born 1660)\nappears to have been particularly remarkable in connection with the\ninvestigation (partly purely experimental investigation) pursued in\n1714 by a learned Jesuit, Father Crivelli. It seems to me to confirm\nmy standpoint that it is perhaps in the religious domain that we are\nafter all most likely to obtain striking evidence for supernormal\nphenomena.\nQuestions connected with hypnotism are discussed by MM. Pascal,\nOsty and Desoille. Dr Osty adduces statements made by very\ncompetent investigators (Professor Richet included) which tend to\nshow that persons apt to be hypnotised are growing more and more\nscarce. No explanation is offered.\nM. Delevsky, a mining engineer, discusses the part possibly played\nby suggestion at a distance in \" scientific creation.\" As a rather\nplausible instance he quotes the simultaneous researches on non-\nEuclidian geometry of Gauss (Germany), Lobatchevsky (Russia)\nand Bolyai (Hungary). Other cases are set aside as susceptible of\na simpler explanation ;\namong them I miss the well-known instance\nof Charles Darwin and A. R. Wallace.\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1931\n\" Mediumistic comedy\" is the sub-title given by Dr Osty to the\nrecent sittings for physical phenomena with Stanislawa P. at the\nParis Institute, during which sittings the medium was thoroughly\nexposed. (The late Dr von Schrenck-Notzing repeatedly experi-\nmented with Stanislawa.) Very characteristic is the attitude of the\nmedium's husband after the exposure in regard to the money paid\nto her for the Paris sittings (p. 526).\nIn the \" Chronique \" M. Maire is very hard on the protagonist of\nthe Vandermeulen apparatus (see above).\nI have left for the end of my Notes Dr Osty's preliminary and\nvery brief statement as to the recent sittings at the I.M.I, with\nRudi Schneider. The ectoplasmic \" phenomena,\" it appears, were\nabsent, the telekinetic very poor ; but on the other hand, the use\nof infra-red rays revealed the presence at a certain distance from the\nmedium of an invisible substance, not capable of being photographed,\n\" localised in space,\" and rigorously depending on the medium's\npsyche. We are promised further details later on. Meanwhile, Dr\nOsty asserts, a process has been found revealing with \" perfect\nprecision \" and \" perfect security \" the movements of the invisible\nsubstance in question, thereby making such a demonstration \" as\ncogent as the purest and simplest experiment in physics.\"\nBulletin du Conseil de Recherches metapsycliiques de Belgique, January\n1931.\nThis number opens with another instalment of M.

It is almost superfluous to add that the whole looks\nmost suspicious and that Herr Wratnik is obviously one of those\nwitnesses whose testimony would not go far towards establishing\nthe genuineness of any marvels whatsoever.\nHerr Rolf Reinisch narrates a series of incidents of various kinds\nconnected with the demise of his wife and her promise to \" come\nback.\" Professor Kasnacich pursues his account of sittings with\nFran Maria Silbert in 1919-1922. Herr Albert Langer has a long\n\fMarch 1931 Notes on Periodicals 47\npaper on \" experiments \" with Kordon Veri. The first three\ninstalments of the paper deal with card experiments which look\nsuspiciously like card tricks. As a precaution the medium was\nblindfolded, whilst experience conclusively shows how insecure this\nmethod of control is.\nDr Chr. Schroder has the beginning of a paper written in vindi-\ncation of the claims of Lajos Papp and Tibor Molnar, the Budapest\n-\" psychitives \" (sic) investigated by Mr Besterman (Proceedings.\nxxxviii. 450-465) who is taken to task in a rather discourteous\nfashion. Such methods are unfortunately very common on Dr\nSchroder's part, but if this gentleman imagines that he enhances\nthe value of his criticisms by his rudeness, he is, I am afraid, mis-\ntaken. It may be worth noting that Dr Schroder has recently\nmarried the daughter of Frau Rudloff, the medium with whom he\nhas long been associated.\nDr Carl Brack brings to a close a paper (begun in the September\nnumber) entitled :\n\" Does there exist telepathic pressure at a\ndistance ?\n\" (Fernzwang). The question, as was to be expected, is\nanswered in the affirmative.\nDr. Chr. Schroder prints a further instalment of a paper (also\nbegun in the September number) describing alleged visions of the\nfuture by a Frau Bartschat. The prophecies are given by means\nof painting and automatic writing. Frau Bartschat is believed by\nDr Schroder to have thus foreseen such events as a mine explosion\nid Silesia, a railway (or tramway) catastrophe in Buenos Aires, and\na typhoon in the Far East. I am afraid prevision of the future is\ngenerally speaking both one of the most unlikely a priori branches\nof psychical research and one of the most inadequately attested.\nAnd yet we have in this domain an alleged case of a permanent\ncharacter, accessible to all and having undoubtedly preceded the\nevent to which it is commonly supposed to refer : I have in view the\nseventy weeks prophecy in the Book of Daniel (Chapter 9). May I\nsuggest that a discussion of it in the Journal might prove very\nfruitful ? For my part I should be ready to let some of the weightiest\nmoral and intellectual issues which mankind has to face, not to\nspeak of prevision in general, stand or fall with this prophecy.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, January 1931.\nThis number opens with a paper by Frl. Gerda Walther on the\nNorwegian medium Mrs Ingeborg, daughter of Judge Dahl of Fred-\nriksstad. This medium's specialities are automatic writing, book-\ntests, sealed letter reading, etc., unfortunately also apports (a most\nsuspicious phenomenon). Incidentally we learn that the \" spirits\n\"\nmanifesting through Mrs Ingeborg have repeatedly declined to give\na test-word previously agreed upon as a proof of identity, alleging\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mabch 1931\nthat there is in the Beyond a \" law \" which prevents them pro-\nmising at sittings such Stichworte as tests. Hitherto we knew nothing\nof so deplorable a \" law.\" Apports are again to the front in a short\npaper by Messrs C. Blacher and E. Keuchel, dealing chiefly with\nthe medium Eugen F.K.

Let\nme note, however, a titre de curiosite, the \" plastic hallucinations\n\"\nhypothesis as championed by Privatdozent Dr E.

Woolley.\nThe Secretary having read the notice convening the meeting,\nSir Oliver Lodge said that the Annual Report of the Council and the\naudited Statement of Accounts had already been circulated to\nMembers, and he proposed that they should be taken as read. This\nwas agreed to.\nTreasurer's Statement.\nThe Hon. Treasurer, making the usual financial statement, said\nthat he proposed to be brief as the meeting had much other business\nto transact. The Society had ended the year 1929 with a very\nsmall balance in hand, and even so had had to defer payment of a\nprinters' bill then due, amounting to nearly \u00a3300. It ended 1930\nwith a credit balance in the General Fund of \u00a387, without any out-\nstanding accounts. During the year the Society had received a few\nwindfalls, but even apart from these the Society had improved its\n\fApril 1931 Annual General Meeting 53\nposition to the extent of about \u00a390, and in view of the world-wide\neconomic depression he thought that this was a most satisfactory\nresult.\nThe main cause of the saving was the improvements carried out\nby Mr Besterman in the preparation and printing of the Journal and\nProceedings. The quantity of matter contained in Proceedings\nduring the last year was rather below the average, owing to the fact\nthat some papers which might have been printed in 1930 were not\nready for issue until 1931 ; the coming year would redress the\nbalance.\nThe Society sent three representatives to the International Con-\ngress at Athens, and not a penny of the cost of sending them fell upon\nthe funds of the Society. In view of this fact, he thought that\nmembers might be more ready to buy copies of the Transactions,\nwhich had been published by the Society on behalf of the Congress\norganisation ; so far, the sales in this country had been somewhat\ndisappointing, though there was no reason to anticipate that any\ncharge would eventually fall on the Society's funds for this publica-\ntion.\nBy the generosity of Mrs Frederic W. H. Myers the capital of the\nMyers Memorial Fund had been raised to \u00a31,000. The second\nlecture under this foundation would be delivered by Dr T. W.\nMitchell in the course of the year 1931.\nSummary of Chairman 's Address.\nOn the motion for the adoption of the Report, the Chairman made\na statement. He said the Society was passing through a critical\ntime, such as many Societies had to pass through. In some cases\nthere had been a split which did harm to the cause. It was not the\nfirst time that there had been differences of opinion in the Society.\nHe referred to the disagreements long ago of such men as Alfred\nRussel Wallace and Stainton Moses, who were annoyed with what\nthey considered the slowness and scepticism of the Society.\nHe did not in any way wish to minimise the present dissatisfac-\ntion. The grounds of complaint seemed to be chiefly two, first\nrudeness, second inertia. Taking them in order, he had been struck\nhimself with the comparatively curt manner in which questions were\nsometimes answered at meetings, as contrasted with the polite\nmethods of the old days. Some questions might be foolish, but it\nwas always possible to discover some ground on which useful informa-\ntion could be given, and the foolish part ignored. In particular,\nhowever, he referred to the contemptuous criticism of foreigners and\ntheir methods of enquiry. There was a good deal of scepticism\nabout ectoplasm ; and he knew that some people disliked the\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research apeil 1931\npictures in Schrenck-Notzing's book. But ectoplasm was a name\ndevised by Richet as involving a minimum hypothesis to explain\ncertain physical phenomena such as telekinesis and materialisation.\nIt was not yet accepted : it needed investigation by biologists and\nphysiologists, and then its unpleasant character would disappear.\nThe activity on the Continent had greatly increased since the S.P.R.\nwas founded. It was not likely that eminent men should in their\nreports come up to S.P.R. standards. If phenomena occurred in\ntheir presence which they could testify to, they were apt to consider\nthat sufficient. They ought to be careful about their criticism of\neminent foreigners. Some of the critiques objected to in the Journal\nmight occasionally have been irritating, but their reviewer of foreign\nperiodicals, Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, a member of the\nS.P.R. for more than forty years, was not only a good linguist, but\nhad had much experience in psychical research, and they could not\nexpect him entirely to suppress opinions he might form on some of\nthe articles he reviewed.\nWith regard to the inertia of the Society concerning physical\nphenomena, they could not help scepticism. All they demanded\nwas that a phenomenon should be studied ; a student then had a\nright to his own opinions. Mr Besterman was a student from whom\nthey hoped good things in time. On the whole it might be said that\nphysical mediums just then were or had been rather weak. The\nexperiments were not really under their control : the conditions\nwere often dictated, or had to be approved, by an intelligence\nassociated with the medium under investigation. Scientific men\nwould never put up with so unusual a circumstance. Some day a\nreally strong medium would be vouchsafed to them, and then the\nscepticism might be an asset.\nConcerning Mr Price's proposal, the Chairman said he wished to\nspeak respectfully of Mr Price, who had devoted time and energy to\nthe investigation, and was an expert conjurer. But his methods\nwere different from those of the S.P.R. He attained a certain\namount of publicity, and called his privately managed laboratory a\n\" National Laboratory.\" Moreover he seemed in impulsive haste :\nfor instance, he circulated members generally on a proposal that had\nbeen submitted to the Council, and while it was still sub judice.\nThe members voted without understanding the exact terms of the\nproposition.\nThe Society must adhere to its ancient methods, which had already\ncontributed so greatly to its prestige. At the beginning the Society\nreceived the interest of many eminent Victorians, for instance,\nTennyson, Gladstone, and Ruskin. It had attracted distinguished\nnames ; and the atmosphere in which it began was very different\nfrom the atmosphere now, as could be illustrated by a quotation\n\fApril 1931 Annual General Meeting 55\nfrom The Observer of 1882 (22 October), reproduced by Mr Bester-\nman on page 120 of bis paper to the Athens Congress. Its prestige\non the Continent was illustrated by a letter from Professor Driesch\nprinted elsewhere in this number. It had some forty volumes of\nProceedings to its credit, and it was worth preserving. Members\ncould destroy the Society if they chose, and release the Council from\ntheir work and pecuniary sacrifice. The work would continue\nwhether in the Society or otherwise. Much more than was known\nhad all along been done privately, sometimes with positive results\nand sometimes not, and much expense had been incurred by indi-\nviduals. The apathy of the Society was only apparent. There\nwere times when rapid progress on doubtful ground would be in-\njudicious. \" They also serve who only stand and wait.\"\nThe Chairman then invited questions and discussion.\nMr Dingwall commented on the small sum in the accounts devoted\nto research. It was pointed out in reply that many other items on\nthe expenses side of the Society's accounts in fact covered expendi-\nture on research, and also that, as had always been the case in\nthe Society's history, a great deal of research work was done by\nmembers at their own expense.\nMr Drayton Thomas thought that the Society might train its\nown mediums, and also suggested that experiments in hypnotism,\nwhich had played a large part in the earlier history of the Society,\nshould be revived. Miss Jephson pointed out, in reply to the former\nsuggestion, that for several years the Society had carried on a series\nof experiments in telepathy and clairvoyance with a large number\nof persons claiming to have supernormal faculties.\nMr Findlay said that in his opinion the Society threw away\nuseful opportunities for investigation. About eight years ago,\nhaving had sittings in Glasgow with Sloane, whom he regarded as a\nmedium above all suspicion, he had offered to the Society to bring\nSloane to London at his own expense for investigation, provided that\nthe Society would engage Sloane as caretaker. The Society had\nhowever\u2014he thought unreasonably\u2014refused on the ground that it\nwas undesirable to allow a medium free run of the premises at all\nhours of the day and night. Sir Ernest Bennett said he had had\nsome experience of Sloane and could not agree with Mr Findlay's\nestimate of him. Dr Woolley thought that the Council's objection\nto having a professional medium as caretaker was justified.\nMrs Kingsley referred to a private conversation with Mr Bester-\nman, in which, according to her account, Mr Besterman had said he\nwould never advise any one to have sittings with mediums because\nhe thought it was dangerous. Mrs Salter said that at one time she\nused regularly to see people at the Society's Booms, and there were\nmany occasions when she had given advice, which might have been\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1931\n(erroneously) reported in that way ; it was not always wise to\nrecommend sittings with mediums for some people and in some\ncircumstances. The subject having been further dealt with by\nMr Bechhofer Koberts, Mr Besterman said he did not accept Mrs\nKingsley's version of the incident ; it was not reasonable in a meeting\nof that kind to quote, divorced from its context, what was said in a\nprivate conversation.\nThe Chairman then moved that the Beport and Accounts be\naccepted, and this was carried nem. con.\nThe Chairman then read the names of the six members of Council\nwho retired in rotation and offered themselves for re-election. No\nother candidates having been nominated, he declared the retiring\nmembers duly elected. Their names are as follows : Mr G. W.\nLambert, Dr T. W. Mitchell, Mr W. H. Salter, Mrs W. H. Salter,\nMr Sydney C. Scott, and Mrs Henry Sidgwick.\nThe auditors, Messrs Hartleys, Wilkins, Avery and Flew, were\nelected for the year 1931.\nMr Dingwall then moved the following Besolution :\n\" That this\nMeeting views with grave concern the decline in the prestige of the\nSociety both at home and abroad, and is of the opinion that a change\nin the administration is desirable.\" He prefaced his remarks by\nsaying that although he moved a Besolution he did not intend to\nhave it put to the vote. He agreed with Sir Oliver Lodge that\npoliteness and energy were desirable ; he was not concerned with\nthese matters, but with the question of honesty and competence.\nAs regards honesty he adversely criticised the sending out of proxy\nforms with an accompanying circular before the Annual General\nMeeting of 1928, which he said had been done at the Society's\nexpense. He also criticised the way in which the new Articles of\nAssociation were passed, and he commented at length on what he\nsaid were inconsistencies in certain statements as to whether Mr\nBesterman proceeded to Budapest in 1928 as the Society's representa-\ntive or not. Opposite statements could be found in a letter written\nby Mr Besterman's lawyers to the founder of a psychical Society in\nBudapest, Mr Bothy, and in what he claimed and reported to\nMr Bothy that Mr Salter had said to him (Mr Dingwall) during an\ninterview in October 1929. On the question of competence Mr\nDingwall criticised a passage in an article by Mr Besterman in The\nLink, and a case of premonition recorded in the February Journal.\nMr Guy B. Brown formally seconded the Besolution.\nMr Drayton Thomas, Mrs Goldney, and one or two other Members\ncriticised the action of the Council in inviting Members to fill up\nproxies in the Council's favour without circulating copies of the\nBesolutions.\nIn reply it was pointed out that since the Besolutions contained\n\fApril 1931 Annual General Meeting 57\nwhat in the opinion of the Council were in substance mis-statements\nof fact, the Council were on that ground unwilling to give them\nunnecessary publicity.\nMiss F. M. Sterling said that in her experience it was customary for\ngoverning bodies to ask for proxies in their support simply as a\nmatter of confidence, and she was quite prepared to support the\nCouncil on that basis. The names sent out on the proxy form were\nin her opinion a sufficient guide to Members.\nMrs Dingwall having also spoken, Mr Salter in reply said that the\ndiscrepancy alleged by Mr Dingwall was to be found between a letter\nwritten by Mr Besterman's lawyers, and statements said to have been\nmade by Mr Salter to Mr Dingwall at an interview, after which\nMr Dingwall wrote a letter to Mr Rothy, a portion of which had been\nread. Mr Salter had himself written neither of these letters, and one\nof them he had never seen. For the general purport of the lawyer's\nletter, the intention of which was to keep Mr Rothy's attack on\nMr Besterman within the bounds of decency, he took full respon-\nsibility, but not for its verbal inspiration. For the second letter,\nMr Dingwall's letter to Mr Rothy, he took no responsibility what-\nsoever. It was not written with his knowledge or approval, and did\nnot fairly represent what he had said to Mr Dingwall at the inter-\nview in question. There was no doubt as to the capacity in which\nMr Besterman went to Budapest, though there might be some\ndifficulty in defining in a few words the extent to which he repre-\nsented the Society.\nMr Salter then described the situation arising out of Mr Bester-\nman's report of his sittings in Budapest, the correspondence with\nMr Rothy, and Mr Dingwall's intervention in the dispute. He also\ndealt with other matters raised by Mr Dingwall, pointing out that\nthe circular inviting proxies in 1928 had not, as Mr Dingwall had\nsuggested, been sent out at the Society's expense.\nMr Dingwall then said that he proposed to withdraw his motion,\nbut several Members protested against his being allowed to do so in\nview of the nature of his opening speech. The Chairman then put\nthe motion to the vote by a show of hands. There appeared for the\nmotion 7 votes ; and against the motion, practically the whole\nnumber of other Members present.\nThe Chairman declared the motion lost by an overwhelming\nmajority.\nMrs Goldney then moved the following Resolution :\n\" Resolved\nthat this meeting approves of the amalgamation, proposed by Mr\nHarry Price and supported by an overwhelming majority of S.P.R.\nvoters, of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research with this\nSociety ; and requests the Council to appoint a Committee to discuss\nthe details of the suggested plan with the Administration of the\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April i\n(\nj3I\nNational Laboratory.\" She explained in some detail the circum-\nstances under which the proposal for the amalgamation of the\nNational Laboratory of Psychical Eesearch with the Society had been\nlaid before the Council and as to how the voting papers issued by\nMr Price had been circulated to Members and Associates. She\nexplained however that the circumstances as regards the National\nLaboratory had fundamentally changed since the proposal was made.\nMr Price had now acquired new premises which would accommodate\nhis Library and apparatus, so that no question now arose of their\nbeing moved to the Society's premises. Moreover, the membership\nand general organisation of the National Laboratory was being\nreconstituted.\nMr Price seconded the Resolution and said that, if he individually\nwere considered any obstruction to the amalgamation, he was willing\nto delete himself entirely from any scheme.\nA further discussion followed, in which Lord Balfour, Mr De\nBrath and Mr Bousfield took part. In the course of this discussion\nit was suggested that, in view of the changed circumstances, the best\ncourse would be for Mrs Goldney to withdraw her motion and for\nMr Price to submit further proposals to the Council. Dr Woolley\nexpressed the hope that the new proposals would be sufficiently\ndetailed to enable the Council to deal with them.\nThe motion was accordingly withdrawn by general consent ; and\nthe meeting adjourned.\nProfessor Hans Driesch and Dr Walter Franklin Prince, to whom,\nas the leading representatives of psychical research on the Continent\nand in America, copies of Mr Dingwall's Resolution had been for-\nwarded, sent to the Council the letter and cablegram which are\nprinted below.\nThe Council wish to thank the 234 Members of the Society who\nsent proxies in support of the Council as a vote of confidence.\nLetter from Dr Hans Driesch\n12 February 1931.\nMay I ask you to bring what follows before the Annual General\nMeeting of the S.P.R. to be held on February 26th.\nThe London S.P.R. , in my opinion, is not only the first in time but\nalso the first in rank of all Psychical Societies existing.

W. S. Irving. Recorder : Theodore Besterman.\nNotes by Th. B.\n[1] I had arranged to act as\nnotetaker for Mr Irving at two\nLeonard sittings, on 27 and\n29 January 1931. On the\nafternoon of the 26th Mr Irving\nasked me to put a book into a\nbox with a view to a booktest.\nThat evening I did so, taking a\nbook at random from my shelves\nand putting it into an attache-\ncase, which, of course, remained\nin my flat. Mr Irving intended\nto mention this arrangement to\nhis communicator at the sitting\nof the 27th, with a view to a\nbooktest on the 29th. But at\nthe very beginning of the former\nsitting, immediately after the\nusual greetings, Feda spoke as\nshown in the next column. (The\nidea of putting a book in a box\nfor test purposes was first sug-\ngested to Mr Irving by his com-\nmunicator through Feda on 21\nNovember 1929 ; but the method\nof doing so was different from\nthat used in the present case ;\nand the medium had no reason\nto anticipate that such a test\nwould be tried on this occasion).\nThe book I had put away was,\nas I discovered before putting it\ninto the box but after having\nchosen it at random, the second\nvolume of the 1907 impression of\nThe Poetical Works of Alexander\nPope, edited by G. R. Dennis, in\nMessrs Bell's Aldine Edition of\nthe British Poets (London). The\ncovers are a vivid red, very close\nto the colour of the covers of\n[Feda :] [1] Dora says I have\nto ask you a question here be-\ncause of that little problem of\nnot being sure, not being sure, as\nto what is present or immediately\npast or immediately future.

There is\nno definite statement to this\neffect in the records of the sit-\ntings, but the new method would\nappear to apply to recent tests.\nIt is borne out by the present\none to the extent that the actual\np. 18 is blank, while the eigh-\nteenth page on the new method is\np. 11, on which occur lines 187 to\n217 of Eloisa to Abelard, which\ntreats, of course, of the famous\nstory of the two parted lovers.\nThe whole poem turns on the\nbars or barriers preventing their\nreunion, though there is no ref-\nerence to bars or barriers on that\n1\nAfter completing this report I turned to Stainton Moses's Spirit-Identity\n(London 1879) to refresh my memory of his booktests.

The whole poem, again,\nis applicable to Mr Irving and\n\" Dora \" as parted lovers, as Mr\nIrving fully agrees.

A passion to\nresign,\nFor hearts so touched, so\npierced, so lost as mine.\nThe statement that the passage is\napplicable \" to a certain extent\n\"\nis true. For, although the lines\napply perfectly when taken out\nof their context, it will be remem-\nbered that in the context it is\nnot by the barrier of death that\nthe lovers are separated.\n[9] I handed the book to Mr\nIrving, on a dull morning, in the\nback room of the Society's Lib-\nrary, which is always a rather\ndark room. It is of course true\nthat Mr Irving found the book\ninteresting and spoke of compar-\ning and examining it.\n\fApril i!)3i Notable Booktest at Sitting with Mrs Leonard 65\nBill, she says, \" soon. It'll be\nunder circumstances in which\nyou can discuss the matter.\nYou'll be able to say '\nOh ! This\nis interesting. I must compare\nand examine this book, so and\nso, so.'\n\"\nThe ungrateful task of attempting to estimate the statistical value\nof this booktest must now be attempted. I will take it paragraph by\nparagraph.\n1. This is not an ordinary booktest, where the sitter is given\ninstructions to look in a specified place. Feda spoke of Mr Irving\ndoing something in the immediate past or immediate future (later\nthe immediate future was definitely given) in connection with a book.\nThis is true, but it cannot be given any value, since it would be true\nof almost everybody at almost any time. The book was then described\nas having a particularly vivid shade of red. I had great difficulty in\nfinding a book of a colour similar to that of the Pope ;\nbut, allowing\nfor all types of books, it may be very modestly estimated that one\nbook in five has vivid red covers. An examination of average book-\nshelves will show that the proportion is actually much smaller.\n2. No value can be attached to this, for, although there are very\ndefinite odds against any given book being of medium size, the\nestimate given was not literally correct.\n3. The odds against this statement are considerable, since only a\nfew of the books from which booktests are usually given, whether in\nMr Irving's own house or elsewhere, would have the recent touch of\na hand on it. This might, however, be a reasonable assumption if\nthe medium were \" aware \" (see below) that a special kind of test\nwas involved. Let us therefore give the statement a modest value of\n1 in 2.\n4. A vast majority of books are not treatises on psychical matters,\nand very few of them have touches of a psychical kind in them. Let\nus say, to be moderate, 1 in 10.\n5. No value ;\nbeing a forecast, it would be impossible to prove\nthat it had been confirmed quite spontaneously.\n6. This series of statements must be given a high value. A small\nminority of books have any kind of \" sign \" on their covers. Only a\nsmall proportion of this minority can be described as having \" a\nsign, or symbol, specially suited to the book.\" Many publishers have\nno marks at all ; no publisher puts his mark on all his books ; and\nonly a few, such as the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses,\nand Messrs Bell themselves, put their marks on a large proportion of\ntheir books. A considerable proportion of all marks on books are\nthose of the University Presses, and most forms of these marks are\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1931\nsimply adaptations of the University arms. These, it must be\nremembered, would not be \" specially suited \" to a book published\nby the University Press, since the University arms of course appear\non all kinds of other objects. A very small number of books indeed\nhave other kinds of symbols on their covers (such, for instance, as a\nwheel on a book dealing with engineering). Bookcase no. 17 at the\nS.P.R. (which has been chosen as it contains miscellaneous books)\nhas 243 volumes on its shelves (February 1931). Eight of these, or\n1 in 30, have some kind of symbol on their covers. But this pro-\nportion is higher than it would be in a general library, since novels\nhardly ever bear symbols, and of course there are no novels on our\nshelves. However, let us give this statement a value of 1 in 25.\nOf the various symbols to be found on the covers of books, I do\nnot think that Feda's description would apply to any but to this\nparticular one of Messrs Bell. It would not even apply to the other\nforms of this firm's \" bell \" mark. It certainly does not apply to\nany other sign that I can find on my own shelves or on those of the\nSociety or on the open shelves in the Reading Room of the British\nMuseum. The question, therefore, is what proportion of books bear-\ning any kind of symbol on their covers would bear this particular one\nof Messrs Bell's 1 After a careful examination of the many thou-\nsands of books in the various libraries to which I have access, I think\nthat this proportion would be very greatly over-estimated at 1 in 100.\nThe whole of paragraph 6 is therefore given a total chance pro-\nbability of 1 in 2,500, which is undoubtedly extremely conservative.\n7. Few books contain \" a great many references to the mind,\nmentality.\" Let us put it at 1 in 10.\n8. In what proportion of books would the eighteenth page contain\nso relevant a passage ? The proportion must clearly be very small,\nand would be ludicrously over-estimated at 1 in 100. But there is\nsome doubt whether p. 11 is the one intended ; we thus have a\nchoice between two pages (11 and 18, though in the present instance\nthe latter happens to be blank). We ought therefore to halve our\nodds ; but let us be on the safe side and divide by ten, thus obtaining\na chance probability of 1 in 10.\n9. No value ; see 5 above.\nWe thus get a total maximum chance probability, by simple\nmultiplication, of 1 in 5 x 2 x 10 3\nx 2500 = 1 in 25,000,000. It must\nbe remembered that every constituent of this figure has been greatly\nunder-estimated ; a true valuation, without prejudice either way,\nwould give us an even more remarkable figure. Even so, a chance\nprobability of one in twenty-five million trials drives us to the con-\nclusion that some extra-chance factor operated to bring about this\nresult.\nI have fully discussed these calculations with Mr Saltmarsh, who\n\fApril 1931 Notable Booktest at Sitting with Mrs Leonard 67\nagrees that they are all very definitely on the conservative side.\nHe goes further and is of the opinion that paragraph 2, to which I\ngive no value, should be given a score of 1 in 2. On the method of\nMessrs Saltmarsh and Soal1\nand allowing for this view of Mr Salt-\nmarsh's, we obtain the following formula (for help with which I am\nindebted to Mr Saltmarsh and to Mr Soal).\nScore :\n- 2(1 - 1\/2) log 1\/2 - (1 - 1\/5) log 1\/5 - 3(1 - 1\/10) log 1\/10\n- (1 - 1\/2500) log 1\/2500 = 6-956\nStandard Error :\ns\/2\/2(l - 1\/2) [log 1\/2]\n2\n+ 1\/5(1 - 1\/5) [log l\/5]2\n+ 3\/10(1 - 1\/10)\nN\/[log 1\/10]\n2\n+1\/2500(1 - 1\/2500) [log l\/2500]2\n= -630\nValue :\nStandard Error _ 6-956 _ ^\nScore -630\nThe result on this basis is so immensely far above chance that it\ngoes beyond the ordinary probability tables, and would thus not be\nexpected to appear by chance alone more often than once in thou-\nsands of millions of trials. It is interesting to see that a refined\nmathematical calculation produces even more favourable results\nthan the ordinary method of simple multiplication.\nIt will be useful to emphasise one or two points which distinguish\nthis booktest. (1) The test was not, as is usual with booktests,\ngiven from a specified place. In the experiment tried by Lady Trou-\nbridge, where she selected a particular book for the purpose of a test,\nFeda was informed of the experiment beforehand and was told where\nthe book had been put. 2\nIn the case of an experiment in which a\nbook was made into a parcel by a person not present at the sitting\nthe sitter's communicator was similarly informed.3\nIn the present\ninstance the absence of references to the place where the book was to\nbe found, in view of the medium's ignorance of the experiment it was\nhoped to make, and in addition to the definite statements in para-\ngraphs 1 and 3, suggests an awareness by, we may say for convenience,\nthe medium, of an unusual circumstance in this aspect of the test.\nThis is the more striking since the test was given at the very begin-\nning of the sitting, thus ruling out any possible unintended leakage\nfrom the sitters. It must also be remembered that, no place being\n1\nProceedings (1930), xxxix. 266ff.\n2\nMrs Henry Sidgwick, \" An Examination of Book-Tests obtained in Sittings\nwith Mrs Leonard,\" Proceedings (1921), xxi. 300.\n3\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas, Some Neiv Evidence for Human Survival (London\n1922), p. 50.\n\f(is Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1931\nspecified, the medium had the whole world of books to choose from,\npoetry and mathematical textbooks, ledgers and detective novels,\ntables of logarithms and Coptic dictionaries, any of which might\nhave been chosen, at random, as a test-book.\n(2) It was the first time that a Leonard booktest has been given\nfrom my flat, and my identity is still, to the best of my knowledge,\nunknown to the medium. She could therefore have obtained no help\nfrom these possible sources of information.\n(3) It would be unreasonable to regard the statement that the\nbook \" might have 250 to 300 pages \" as more than a general indi-\ncation of size, so that I do not regard the actual size of 323-330 pages\nas a mistake. In paragraph 8 there is also some doubt, but this may\nbe our fault. Apart from these points every statement made by the\nmedium in connection with this booktest was perfectly accurate.\nAn attempt at interpretation must now be made. Some of the\ninformation given was actively present in the minds of both Mr\nIrving and myself. All of it was or could conceivably have been at\none time, in my consciousness. Hence it is impossible definitely to\nassume the presence of more than thought-transference. At the same\ntime, taking a little less than the extreme view, it is difficult to\nsuppose that even in the remotest fastnesses of my subconsciousness\ndid I know what sentiments were to be found, not on the actual page\n18 of the volume, but on an arbitrary page 18 calculated on a method\nmost distasteful to my bibliographical passions. To accept the\nextreme view it would be necessary to suppose that when handling\nthis volume of Pope, which I have certainly had in my hands fairly\noften, I noticed how many preliminary pages there were in the book\nand which of them were blank ; and that this knowledge enabled me\nsubconsciously to work out that page 11 in the book, previously\nselected owing to my recollection of the sentiment appearing on it,\nshould be given as 18 in order to give the statement the air of a\nmessage from Mr Irving's communicator, since it is assumed that\nthis would have been the latter's way of giving the reference. To\nthis must be added that this supposed method of the communicator's\nwas unknown to me when I last opened the book before the sitting.\nIn short, it seems to me, even in the light of what we know about the\npowers of the subconsciousness, that the attribution of this booktest\npurely to thought-transference presents very great difficulties.\nThe question therefore arises whether any part of it is reasonably\ncapable of being regarded as evidence for survival or for clairvoyance.\nHere we enter a region where idle speculation is least profitable. It\nis enough to say that such knowledge as we possess seems to suggest\nthat clairvoyance is the more likely hypothesis, since the volume of\nPope had no associations with Mr Irving or with his communicator.\nI therefore suggest that the least unlikely notion is that a telepathic\n\fApril 1931 Notable Boohtest at Sitting with Mrs Leonard 69\ncommunication from the sitters directed the medium to the source\nfrom which the booktest was to be taken, and that the test itself was\nobtained by a clairvoyant perception. 1\nIt is only right to add that this opinion is not shared by Mr Irving\nhimself. To make this quite clear Mr Irving has kindly written the\nfollowing postscript :\n\" It is my view, and I think a not unreasonable\nview, that the communicator was the clairvoyant, and that, having\nmade herself acquainted beforehand with the fact that Mr Besterman\nhad selected a book for test purposes, she chose passages from this\nbook suitable to herself and to me. The other booktests given at this\nsitting were, I think, taken in the same way and with the same\nmethod of counting pages. Although, in this particular case, there\nis little in the material selected that can be said to point to the agent\nbeing the surviving memory of one particular person, i.e. of my wife,\nin some of the other cases of booktests taken from houses unknown\nto me there have been what I consider definite signs of this in the\nmaterial chosen, so that to me it is simpler to attribute the present\ntest to the same possible agency.\"\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Monist, July 1930.\nIn an article entitled \" Psychology and Psychical Research,\" Dr\nF. C. S. Schiller discusses the relation of philosophy and psychology\nto psychical research, and in particular the precautions which must\nbe taken in drawing conclusions from the phenomena.\nIn the author's view, the bankruptcy of philosophic psychology\nleaves the coast clear for psychical research. But in his view the\ndifficulties in the way of effective psychical research are stupendous\nand greatly exceed those which ordinary science has to encounter.\nThese difficulties arise from a bias due to an emotional element in\nthe mind of the observer. The hypotheses of psychical research\narouse an intense emotional reaction which produces an emotional\nbias which may lead perfectly respectable and otherwise credible\nwitnesses to give false evidence. Hence it is not so much against\nfraud and trickery that one has to guard, as against self-deception.\nAnother difficulty is that modern science has lost the conception\nof \" soul \" as an efficacious principle. But, says the author, \" We\nhave good reasons for reconsidering the assumption that '\nsoul\n'\nmust be an inefficacious impotent '\nepiphenomenon '\nthat has no\npower over '\nbody '.\"\nThis article suggests to the reviewer that the author is particularly\nfree from either of the two kinds of bias which are most often\nencountered. These arise from the materialistic complex and the\n1\nCp. Mrs Sidgwick, op. ext., xxxi. 377.\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1931\nspiritualistic complex. The materialist complex leads a careful\nobserver like Professor Richet to reject any theory which is incon-\nsistent with his a priori view that \" mind cannot function without\nbrain.\" This view-point of Professor Richet is a subject of an\narticle by the reviewer in the Hibbert Journal (April 1924) and the\nmaterialistic complex has been discussed at length by the reviewer\nin A Neglected Complex. It must suffice to say here that its effect\non the judgment is such as to turn aside the strongest evidence of\nsupernormal events or to provide fanciful explanations of them.\nThe bias due to a spiritualistic complex has equally to be guarded\nagainst. It may lead to the acceptance of supernormal theories for\nfacts which are obviously open to explanation on normal lines. The\ndifficulty for psychical students is that they have to find their way\nbetween Scylla and Charybdis so as to avoid both perils.\nW. R. BOUSFIELD.\nZeitschrift fiir die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatric, vol. cxix.\nUnder the title of \" Uber die seelische Struktur einer '\nHellse-\nherin,' zugleich em Beitrag zur Klinik der Halluzinose und zur\nPsychologie der Denktatigkeit,\" Dr Fiinfgeld, of the Psychiatric\nClinic of Frankfurt University, analyses the mental structure of\nMina Miiller, a woman supposed by herself to be clairvoyant. After\na detailed account of her heredity and personal history, the writer\nproceeds to an account of the investigation he conducted into her\nclairvoyant claims. This part of Dr Funfgeld's report is lamentably\ninadequate. First he wrote words (? common nouns) on slips of\npaper, on which he then concentrated. In a second experiment he\nfixed his thoughts on various objects in the room. In both cases\nwe are told that the subject completely failed to discover what Dr\nFiinfgeld was thinking of. But we are given no information what-\never as to the number of trials made, as to the conditions under\nwhich they were made, as to Dr Funfgeld's definition of a failure ;\nin short, nearly all the details that are considered essential in the\nreport of an investigation into supernormal faculties are lacking.\n(It is most convenient to retain the word clairvoyance, Hellsehen,\nbut it will be observed that Dr Fiinfgeld uses it very loosely to indi-\ncate any kind of supernormal mental faculty.)\nNext Mina M.'s claim to be able to foretell the results of horse\nraces was investigated. As a result the subject obtained thirty to\nforty per cent, of success. Dr Fiinfgeld discounts this success on\nthe ground that racing experts customarily obtain equally good, and\neven better, percentages of success. It may be so, but it is a state-\nment that could so easily have been tested that it should not have\nbeen made without some evidence. I would suggest that the\nforecasts in, say, six newspapers for the dates in question should be\n\fApril 1931 Notes on Periodicals 71\nconsulted, and the results compared with the subject's statements.\nUnless newspaper tipsters are wiser in Germany than they are in\nEngland, I should be surprised to find them able to give so large a\nproportion of successful forecasts. Finally, the subject failed to\nfind a lost earring. From Mina M.'s general history and psychology\nit seems very probable that her claims to the possession of super-\nnormal faculties are delusive, but as evidence for this these experi-\nments of Dr Fiinfgeld's, as reported by him, are quite inconclusive.\nThe remaining part of the paper is much more important. In it\nthe writer endeavours to ascertain how the subject arrived at her\nconviction that she is clairvoyant. Dr Fiinfgeld rejects the view\nthat the subject is suffering from some serious mental disturbance,\nand is also unable to find evidence for the presence of definite\nhallucinatory trends (though it seems difficult to exclude this possi-\nbility in the case of the voices heard by her). The chief elements\nwhich Dr Fiinfgeld discovered in the subject's psychological make-up\nwhich would explain the presence of her belief, are a general tendency\nto paranoia, a pronounced incapacity for taking up a critical attitude\ntowards her own mental processes (evidence makes no impression\non her, the subjective feeling of \" Tightness \" overruling everything\nelse), and a remarkable capacity for putting together minute indica-\ntions (what Dr Fiinfgeld conveniently calls Kombinationsfahigkeit).\nThese are the mental constituents which, as it were, provide the\nmechanism of the subject's hallucinosis. But the driving power of\nthis mechanism Dr Fiinfgeld finds in Mina M.'s overweening\nambition (which is of course bound up with, or the cause of, her\nparanoia). In connection with the subject's Kombinationsfahigkeit .\nDr Fiinfgeld gives an amusing account of the experiment in which hu\nfixed his thoughts on objects in the room. The subject detected and\nacted upon the very slightest movements of his head, eyes, etc., but\nwas so devoid of critical faculty that she followed these slavishly\neven when Dr Fiinfgeld, having discovered what she was doing,\ncounterfeited these movements.\nI have given only the barest outline of Dr Fiinfgeld's valuable\npaper, but I have given enough to show once more how very greatly\nit is to be desired that some mental medium with acknowledged\nsupernormal faculties should submit to psychological analysis. I\nam strongly inclined to believe, from such observations as it has\nbeen possible to make without formal analysis, that a genuine\nmental medium would not show the same abnormal or even near-\nabnormal traits as are shown by such subjects as Dr Fiinfgeld's.\nTheodore Besterman.\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie, February 1931.\nThe first article in this number is an elaborate and conscientious\naccount by Herr R. Lambert of some experiments with the clair-\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1931\nvoyant Max Moecke. Herr Lambert thinks that in what Moecke\nsaid to two of the sitters, the percentage of success was respectively\n45 and 52 ; whilst in attempts by Professor Max Dessoir making\nhaphazard statements to strangers about their circumstances only\nfive statements in a hundred were correct. I am impressed by an\nobserver of Herr Lambert's calibre arriving at a positive conclusion ;\nnevertheless I feel somewhat sceptical as to the general value of\nsuch performances as Moecke's. We want names and dates, not state-\nments which like caps will fit many a head; we want also fewer mistakes.\nDr Wendler describes what he calls an attempt at levitation :\nfour persons put their forefingers under the knees and shoulders of\nthe person to be \" levitated \" and all the five breathe simultaneously\nas deeply as possible twenty times, after which the experiment\nsucceeds quite easily.

There seems to\nhave been no exposure, but apparently the observers were unaware\nthat similar raps can be produced and have been produced by the\ntoes.

These meetings will provide opportunity\nfor the usual formal papers, and also for informal addresses and con-\nversaziones. Notices of the meetings will be printed as usual in the\nJournal, and it will be advisable always to consult these, as special\nadditional meetings may be arranged from time to time.\nMembers and Associates are particularly asked to note that all\nfuture meetings (unless specific notice to the contrary is given) will\nbe held at 5.30 on the last Wednesday of each month. Tea will be\nserved from 4.30, to which Members and Associates are invited.\nIt will be observed that the months in which no meetings are to be\nheld are July and August, and not August and September, as\noriginally announced. It has been found that the new arrangement\nwill be more convenient for the majority of members.\nOBITUARY.\nMonsieur M. Sage.\nWe have to report with much regret the death of Monsieur M. Sage,\nwho had been an Honorary Associate of the Society since 1904.\nMonsieur Sage was a valuable worker, enthusiastic, but at the same\ntime cautious and a good judge of evidence. He co-operated with\nthe Society in several interesting investigations. In 1908, for\nexample, he enquired on the Society's behalf into the \" Alleged\nMiraculous Hailstones of Remiremont \" (Proceedings, xxi. 405) ; he\nalso contributed some valuable knowledge locally acquired to the\nreview of An Adventure (Proceedings, xxv. 353), and in conjunction\nwith Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo made some enquiries into\nthe alleged exposure of D. D. Home (Journal, xv. 274).\nM. Sage was also of considerable help to the Society by making its\nwork better known on the continent, especially in France. He pub-\nlished several books on psychical research, of which the best known\n(published in 1902) is called Madame Piper et la Societe Anglo-\nAmericaine pour les Reclierches Psychiques and has been translated\ninto both English and German.\nA SERIES OF MEDIUMISTIC STATEMENTS MADE TO FOUR\nSITTERS.\nThe following case, which is a record of incidents occurring at sittings\nwith mediums, chiefly with Mrs Annie Brittain, has been sent to us\nby Mr E. S. Thomas, a Member of the Society, to whom the various\n\fMay 1931 Mediumistic Statements made to Four Sitters 75\nsitters are known, being connected with him by marriage. Their\nnames have been communicated to us, but pseudonyms are used\nhere.\nThe reader will be better able to follow the case in detail if a short\nsynopsis of events and persons is given first. Four sitters are\ninvolved :\n(a) Mrs Atleij, who had her first sitting with Mrs Brittain on 17\nMay 1929. One of the ostensible communicators was her daughter\nDorothy who had died in the previous March as a result of influenza.\n(b) Mrs Grant, a niece of Mrs Atley, who had her first sitting with\nMrs Brittain on 23 August 1929. Mrs Grant's daughter Molly had\ndied in the previous June of severe head injuries resulting from a\nmotor accident.\n_(c) Mrs Fowler, Mrs Grant's, daughter, who had her first sitting\nwith Mrs Brittain on the same day as Mrs Grant, but about two hours\nlater. It should be noted that Mrs Grant and Mrs Fowler sat anony-\nmously, as did also Mrs Atley. The only reason Mrs Brittain had for\nconnecting the two sitters of 23 August was that their appointments\nhad been made by Mrs Atley. From a comparison of the statements\nmade at the three sittings, and especially the number of recurrent\nnames, it seems clear that the close connection between the sitters\nwas apprehended.\n(d) Mr Grant, Mrs Grant's husband, who had a sitting with Mr\nGlover Botham about 20 March 1930. Only one incident is reported\nfrom this sitting ;\nit is with sitters (a), (b) and (c) that the case is\nmainly concerned.\nThe record printed here has been compiled from statements sent\nto Mr Thomas by the various sitters, who took their own notes. It\nshould be observed that on several occasions clear and veridical\nreferences seem to have been made to matters of which the sitters\nhad no normal knowledge at the time. This is a point of some\nimportance where the record of an independent note-taker is not\navailable, because inexperienced sitters\u2014not able to write shorthand\n\u2014may without any intention to deceive record the points in a\nstatement which strike them as veridical rather than those which do\nnot The original documents of the case are in the Society's pos-\nsession.\nExtracts from Mrs Atley'.s first sittinq with Mrs Brittain, 17 Man\n1929.\nJ\n[1].

Sarah and Mary men-\ntioned as with sitter's husband.\n[4]. There is a girl (with Ed-\nward) with such a sweet face, and\na very beautiful disposition. I\nfeel she has not gone over long,\nand hardly knows how to com-\nmunicate. The name sounds like\nDorothy or Doris.\n[5]. She says (regarding her\ndeath) \" I thought I was falling\nasleep and my heart just stopped,\nand I found myself here (and)\nwas just going to write to you.\"\n[6]. She has a very sweet clear\nlaugh.\n[7]. She says \" I never thought\nI would go first ; we always\nthought C\u2014d (husband) would.\"\n[8]. (Dorothy is) looking after\nlittle children who were arriving\nover there, especially (those) who\nhave been unhappy on earth.\nThe name M\u2014 ie is given. I\ncan't quite understand what . . .\nthey want to give. Was there a\nlittle child died ? Miscarriage or\nsomething like it? There's some-\nthing about a second child\u2014was\nanother expected ?\n[9]. Something about E\u2014ie.\n[2]. His brother, father of Mrs\nW. Grant.\n[3]. Two of his deceased sis-\nters.\n[4]. A good description of sit-\nter's deceased daughter Dorothy.\n[5]. She died suddenly and\nquietly while convalescent from\npneumonia after influenza in.\nMarch 1929.\n[6]. True.\n[7]. True ; confirmed by her\nhusband ; he died seven months\nafter her.\n[8]. The sitter is great-aunt\nof a M\u2014ie wdio had a stillborn\nchild a month before this sitting.\nMrs Atley replied, \" Oh no, there\nwas nothing of that kind,\" quite\nforgetting (assuming she had al-\nready heard) the above news.\nThis incident (the reference to\nM\u2014ie followed the reference to\nDorothy looking after children. 1\nIt was only on re-reading her\nnotes much later that the mean-\ning struck her and she wrote to\nM\u2014ie's mother on 15 October\nfollowing. She cannot be sure\nwhether she had heard the news\nat the time of the sitting or not.\n[9]. The very uncommon name\nof a (living) cousin of Dorothy's\nwas given, daughter of Susan\n(see below).\n1\nOn 20 October 1930 Mrs Davis, mother of M\u2014ie and sister of Mrs Grant,\nwas told at a Spiritualist Church near Birmingham that a beautiful baby was\nnear her in spirit in charge of its nurse.

Molly is here ; she had\nan accident, something to her\nhead. She sends her love to her\nmother.\n[10]. This was in answer to\nenquiry about Molly, daughter\nof Mrs Grant, who died after a\nmotor accident in June 1929. No\nnote of this incident was made at\nthe time by the sitter as sitting\nwas disappointing. But her letter\nabout it to Mrs Grant led to the\nlatter's sitting with Mrs Brittain.\nExtracts from Mrs W. Grant's first sitting with Mrs Brittain, 23 August\n1929.\n[11]. A beautiful spirit named\nElizabeth, fond of you . . . glad\nto pass over . . . died of cancer a\nlong time ago.\n[12]. Fine face of a man . . .\nfine features, deep-set blue eyes,\ngood forehead, small side-whis-\nkers, dent in chin . . . says his\nname is William.\n[13]. There is John (sitter\ncould not place John and said\nso), perhaps it is James, or a\nlittle word like Jim ; and there\nis Emily and Florence. Florence\nis Emily and Jim's daughter.\n[14]. Emily is not large any\nmore, and quite well and much\n3\nT\nounger ... A good manager.\n[15]. Jim has blue eyes that\ntwinkle and a round face, merry.\n[16]. Emily wants to talk and\nJim has taken Florence by the arm\nand says, \" Let her have it her\nown way, we'll trot round a bit.\"\n[11]. Aunt and godmother of\nsitter ; true regarding cancer.\n[12]. An accurate description\nin all details of sitter's uncle,\nEdward William Alley (see [1]\nabove).\n[13]. Sitter's father was named\nJim (see [2] above), her mother,\nEmily ; and Florence is a sister\nwho died young. The rest of the\nfamily are all living.\n[14]. She was rather portly in\nlater life and suffered in health\nfrom the effects of a fall. It is\nonly partially true that she was a\n\"good manager,\" though she was\na woman of strong character.\n[15]. True details.\n[16]. Characteristic remark.\nchild and to her own old nurse (deceased). In answer to her question the-\nvoyante said in effect that the nurse was not old but young and beautiful and\nIter name was Dorothy. This statement is certified by Mrs Davis to be correct.\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mat 1931\n[17]. There is another mother\nmuch quieter than yours.\nIs there a Charles ?\nShe is not like your mother,\ntaller and quieter . . . She gives\nher love and says Charles and\nAlfred both living have had a\ndifference of opinion . . . she\nwould like to see them friends\nagain.\n[18]. Now Emily says, \" She\nisn't your mother and she has\nhad long enough.\"\n[19]. She says when she passed\nover Florence met her and she\nsoon got her health.\n[20]. There is a Sarah and a\nMary and they are trying to send\na message to Ellen still living and\nElizabeth. There are three some-\nhow together.\n[17]. Sitter's mother-in-law\nevidently meant\u2014a quieter per-\nson and taller than Emily\u2014as\nCharles is her son, sitter's hus-\nband.\nTrue regarding Charles and\nhis brother Alfred at the time.\n[18]. Characteristic remark\n[19]. See above note [13] on\nFlorence.\n[20]. Aunts of the sitter (see\nalso Mrs Alley's first sitting, note\n[3]). Ellen alone is living. Ellen,\nMary and Elizabeth lived to-\ngether (see above note [11] on\nElizabeth). Sitter is sure the\nmeaning was \" and (there is)\nElizabeth,\" not \" and (to) Eliza-\nbeth.\"\n(At this point the medium woke and asked sitter if she was\nsatisfied. She said yes, but she had not got what she really came\nfor. Medium apparently relapsed into trance, and said :)\n[21].

She\nliked sports.\nHer hair is beautiful : light\nand dark gold-brown. Her eyes\nare blue.\nSitter : Blue ?\nNo, perhaps wall-flower colour.\n[21]. These details are accur-\nately descriptive of sitter's\ndaughter Molly : her hair was\ngold-brown. She wore bracelets,\nbecause she thought she had\n\" hefty \" wrists. She was good\nat games, very strong and agile.\nHer eyes were brown.\n\fMat 1931 Mediumistic Statements made to Four Sitters 79\n[22]. She is about twenty-\ntwo, I should think.\n[23]. She is laughing and says\nWinnie and Charles, and says,\n\" That is for evidence.\"\nThat is not what she calls you,\nbut Mum (sitter assents) or like\nthat and Dad, she says.\n[24]. I don't think she is as\nold as twenty-two, as she is try-\ning to blow a little wheel orna-\nment in your hat round, and\nsays, \" What a funny thing to\nwear in a hat.\"\n[25]. She says she is with\nDorothy, helping . . .\n[26]. Dorothy passed over\nearly in the year and left a little\nboy and little girl (sitter dissents)\n.\n(The communicator also sent\nher love to everybody, giving the\nnames of three girls friends and\nof her six living brothers and\nsisters).\n[22]. She was nearly twenty-\none.\n[23]. Winnie and Charles are\nher parents' Christian names.\nTrue.\n[24]. A very characteristic\ntouch.\n[25]. Dorothy was her second\ncousin, daughter of her great-\nuncle Ted (see above, Mrs Atley's\nsitting).\n[26]. She died in March 1929\nleaving a baby girl.\nExtractsfrom Mrs Fowler's sitting with Mrs Brittain, 23 August 1929,\nabout two hours after Mrs Grant's sitting.\n[27]. There's Emily, that's\nyour Grandma . . . She says she\ncan run about like she used to do\nbefore ske got big here (showing\nwaist), she's respectable now.\n[28]. She got big because she\nhad something the matter\u2014\n-\ninside.\n[29]. She has rather nice hair\nfor a Grandma.\n[30]. She must have been very\nreligious because she used to like\nyou to come to her house and\nread from the Bible \" In my\nFather's house are many man-\nsions.\"\n[27]. Correct name ; see above\nnote [13].\n[28.] Not known to the family.\n[29]. She had very thick hair\nfor her age (76).\n[30]. All true ; she was very\nreligious, and this was a favour-\nite passage of hers.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1931\n[31]. A beautiful young girl\nhas come in. She went over\nsuddenly a little while ago . . .\nShe's taller than you.\n[32]. \" Hallo,\" she says, \" have\nyou got on her stockings ? Be-\ncause you used to pinch her\nstockings.\"\n[33]. She says you ought to\nhave gone first, you're the eldest.\nThat's a joke, she's laughing.\n[34]. Anyhow now you won't\nhave to give her a twenty-first\nbirthday present . . .\n[35]. There is her blue nighty,\nshe'd like you to have her blue\nnighty . . .\n[36]. She is worried about\nsome shoes just before she passed\nover : her feet are so big no one\nelse can wear her shoes.\n[37]. She said she was . . .\nlooking forward to seeing you,\nand you were just too late\nweren't you ? And it was that\nbaby kept you wasn't it ?\n[38]. Oh, she hated that awful\nplace, she'd never been back\nthere ; she was not dead, dead\n... is going to help you all. My\ngoodness, she will have some-\nthing to do looking after all the\nfamily.\n(After several attempts to get\nher name the name Molly was\nobtained suddenly and written\nin her characteristic way in the\nair : round, detached o, straight\nl's, and \" gamma \"\ny.)\n[31]. Molly (sitter's sister) died\nin June 1929. True ; sitter is\nalso tall.\n[32]. A very interesting state-\nment, but inverted. She was the\nborrower.\n[33]. Sitter is the eldest of the\nfamily.\n[34]. She died shortly before\nher twenty-first birthday.\n[35]. Sitter lives abroad and\nknew nothing of this blue sleep-\ning-suit, for the existence of\nwhich Mrs Grant vouches.\n[36]. Her mother had recently\nbought her an expensive pair of\nlizard-skin shoes, they were too\nsmall and were soon trodden out\nof shape and spoilt. Sitter knew\nnothing of this and thinking a\npurchase had not been paid for\nsaid she would see about it.\n[37]. Sitter's visit to England\nwas delayed by her baby's\nhealth and she arrived just too\nlate.\n[38]. Clearly the hospital\nwhere she was taken. There are\nsix brothers and sisters living ;\nsee above, end of Mrs Grant's\nsitting.\n\fMay 193L Mediiimistic Statements made to Four Sitters 81\n[39]. She says you must take\ncare of Winnie and Charles, Mum\nand Dad . . . And Geoff, you\nmust help Geoff. Why didn't\nyou bring Geoff with you ? She\nwas very fond of Geoff, though\nthey used to quarrel a lot at\nhome. Geoff would always\nargue all wrong. She was going\nto mend some music for Geoff,\ndidn't get it done, and bind the\nback of a book, something like a\nschoolbook he used to work from.\n[40]. She would like Geoff to\nhave her books.\n[41]. And what about her\nlittle bus in the stables\u2014no good\nleaving it there doing nothing . . .\n[42]. She left some bags be-\nhind, only there were some things\nmissing from them.\n[43]. She says you have it\n\u2014\nthe little bus. Take it to a place\nlike Malvern and they will\ntune it up for you . . . she'd be\nhappier if you vised it.\n[44]. And the \" creature,\"\nthat's a joke\u2014someone they used\nto call the creature.\n[45]. Who is Geoff going with?\nBenson. (Do you mean Hen-\nson ?). Yes, HEN SON. . .\n[46]. There is a couch ; have\nyou a musical couch in your\nhouse ? Or perhaps with a\nspring broken that squeaks. She\nsays it is out from the wall . . .\nand that she used to come down\non it and you used to tell her not\nto . . .\n[47]. When you feel lonely you\nthink, \" I'd like old Moll to come\nand take me out in her little bus.\"\n[39]. See [23] above. Her\nbrother Geoff ; true regarding\naffection. They were fond of\narguing. A way she might have\nregarded it. She was going to\nbind a music book for G. ; sitter\nwas not aware of this.\n[40]. G. would appreciate a\ngift of books.\n[41]. She always called her car\nthe \" little bus.\" The garage at\nhome is the stables.\n[42]. True ;\nhandbags with\nfittings missing.\n[43]. Molly often took her car\nto Malvern to be tuned up.\n[44]. Significance not under-\nstood.\n[45]. The name of one con-\nnected with the organising of a\ntour (orchestra) on which Geoff\nwas going : he did not go him-\nself.\n[46]. All true.\n[47]. Characteristic of what\nsitter might think and say.\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat 1931\n[48]. She doesn't like the\nphotograph of her looking like a\nboy\u2014one with a big collar and\nneck that goes down ; it makes\nher look like a schoolteacher.\nShe likes the one she had taken at\nthe beginning of the year with\nher head looking out.\n[49]. She does love that baby ;\ngive him a big hug from hus\nAuntie Moll.\n[50]. Somewhere earlier she\nsaid, \" Wasn't it funny I went\nover in some one else's nighty\nand oh I had such a headache.\"\n[51]. There is Dorothy who\nwent over earlier in the year and\nleft a little girl and she is help-\ning Dorothy with the babies.\n[52]. (Regarding helping an-\nother sister to find a suitable\n\" partner \") ; she doesn't want\nto get mixed up in any matri-\nmonial complications.\n[53]. She says give her love to\nTom, Belle, Percy and your hus-\nband.\n[54]. Thank Dorothy's mother\nfor telling Mum.\n[48]. A large photograph an-\nswering to this description was\ntaken. Early in the year a\nsmaller one with a high neck was\nalso taken. [I have seen this\n\" large photograph \" with the\n\" big collar.\" Hon. Ed.]\n[49]. The sex of the child is\ncorrectly given.\n[50]. Sitter would hardly have\nknown of this, although a natural\ninference. The head injuries\nwere very severe.\n[51]. See above, Mrs Ailey's\nsitting.\n[52]. Characteristic remark.\n[53]. Tom and Belle are an\nelder brother and his wife.\nPercy is perhaps meant for\nNancy, another sitter. Sitter's\nfather-in-law's name was given\nfor her husband's.\n[54]. See above, Mrs Ailey's\nsecond sitting.\nExtracts from sitting of Mrs Atley and her daughter J., with Mr\nGlover-Botham, 26 October 1929, in France.\n[55]. (Jim described clearly,\nbut details not recorded). He\nwas a religious man, fond of\ngoing to church and singing\nhymns, but he's very jolly too\n\u2014\njoking now\u2014different to his\nbrother who is serious.\n[56]. (Dorothy described as\nhaving a lovely complexion, soft\ncurling hair, very sweet face,\nlovely eyes).\n[55]. See [2] and [13] above.\nThis characterisation of Jim is\nstriking. His love of and lusti-\nness in singing hymns were\nnotable traits. Regarding his\nbrother Edward see [1] above.\n[56]. The name was not given,\nbut sitters exclaimed it at the\ncorrectness of this description.\n\fMay 1931 Mediumistic Statements made to Four Sitters S3\n[57]. Who is Elizabeth ?

J. Wright, Miracle in History and in Modem Thought. 8vo, pp. ix.\n433. London : Constable & Co., 1930. Price 18s. net.\nThis book is divided into two Parts. The first deals with the\ngeneral question of miracles and the miraculous ; the second applies\nthe results gained in the first to the miraculous element in Chris-\ntianity.\nChapter I gives an account of the development of European\nthought on the subject in the recent past. A profound difference of\n\fMay 1931 ]\\cvicics 85\nopinion has gradually disclosed itself. There is, on the one hand, the\ntraditional view that a miracle is an event which cannot be accounted\nfor by the laws and agents of Nature and must be ascribed to the\ndirect action of God. On this view the occurrence of miracles is an\nessential premise, without which the existence of a God who governs\nand directs the world cannot be established. On the other hand,\nthere is the view that \" miracles,\" in the sense defined above, can\nnever be known to happen ; that their occurrence is not necessary\nin order to establish the existence of a governing and directing God ;\nand that, if they did occur, they would be a positive embarrassment\nto theism.\nMr Wright takes the second view. He carefully distinguishes with\nregard to any event which has been alleged to happen and has been\ncalled a \" miracle \" the two questions : (a) Did this event in fact\nhappen 1 and (b) Supposing that it did, was it inexplicable by finite\nnatural agents and the laws of nature, and must it be ascribed to the\ndirect action of God ? To the first question he answers that there is\nno event, however startling and unusual, with regard to which it is\nimpossible that there should be such good evidence as to make it\nreasonable to believe that it happened. In this connection he dis-\ncusses Hume's theory in Chap. II. He rightly concludes that Hume's\ncontention that no evidence could suffice to make it reasonable to\nadmit the occurrence of an event which contradicts a hitherto uni-\nform experience is quite worthless. But he recognises that Hume did\ngood service in pointing out the many sources of weakness which\ninfect most evidence for the occurrence of such events. After allow-\ning for this, he concludes that, among the enormous mass of strange\nevents which have been reported in connection with various religious\nand magical practices, there probably. is a residue of genuine fact.\nIn Chapter III the author describes the relation of natural science\nto miracle. Here the above distinction becomes highly important.\nWhen it is said that natural science cannot admit miracles, what is\ntrue is that it cannot admit that there are any events which are in\nprinciple incapable of that kind of explanation by natural agents\nand natural laws which science always seeks to give. \" Explana-\ntion \" in this sense is, of course, merely subsumption under de facto\ngeneral rules, and it is a postulate of science that this is always\ntheoretically possible. But natural science has no right whatever\nto assert of any alleged event, no matter how startling and unpre-\ncedented, that it could not have happened. The scientist who asserts\nof an alleged event that it could not have happened, and the theo-\nlogian who asserts of it that it is a \" miracle \" in the traditional sense,,\nare guilty of precisely the same kind of unwarranted dogmatism.\nBoth are assuming that we know all the laws and all the agents in\nnature ; for it is only on this assumption that the former could be\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 193 L\njustified in denying that such an event could have happened, and\nit is only on this assumption that the latter could be justified in\ndenying that it could be explained by natural causes.\nIn Chapter IV Mr Wright gives a sympathetic account of psychical\nresearch and kindred subjects, and uses their results to reinforce his\ncontention that many alleged events which have been called\n\" miracles \" may well have happened, and yet may not be \" mira-\ncles \" in the traditional sense. It is plain that human minds have\nmany latent powers ; and it would not be surprising if great person-\nalities, like the founders of religions, had these powers to so high a\ndegree as to generate by natural causation very singular phenomena\nin the mental and even in the physical realm.\nMr Wright brings his argument to a head in the long chapter which\nends Part I. This is entitled \" The Idea of God and the Miraculous.\"\nHe holds that belief in God is not something which has to be inferred\nfrom and justified by either the general order of nature or alleged\n\" miraculous \" interferences with it. Religious experience is a form\nof knowledge which does not need external support, though it has to\nbe reconciled with the deliveries of other alleged sources of knowledge.\nTo the theist who has this knowledge the whole order of nature is a\nmanifestation of God's character and workings, though certain\nfeatures in it may exhibit the character of God more clearly than\nothers. To rest one's belief in God on \" miracles \" in a traditional\nsense is dangerous to theism in two different ways. In the first place,\nno event could possibly be known to be a \" miracle \" in this sense.\nAt most the theist could suspect the presence of miracles at those\npoints at which scientific explanation has so far failed. As scientific\nknowledge advances this kind of theism must continually defend\npositions which it will eventually have to abandon. Secondly, if\nGod performs \" miracles \" in the traditional sense at all, his choice\nof the occasions for performing them, and his omission to perform\nthem on other occasions, presents a most formidable ethical difficulty.\nI do not propose to discuss the second Part, which is concerned\nwith specifically Christian miracles. In conclusion I would say that\nMr Wright has provided a most interesting and sensible discussion of.\na difficult subject. His range of reading is very wide, and he\nappends a useful bibliography of fifteen pages. I think that the\nbook might have been shortened with advantage by the omission of\nsome of the enormous mass of quotations, but this is a matter of\nopinion. C. D.

The volume concludes with a detailed discussion\nof the psychological experiences of St Theresa, and especially of her\nvisions. Dr Quercy's point of view may be inferred from his con-\nclusion that such visions are hallucinatory, but are not wholly the\nproduct of the unconscious mind ;\nthey are the joint outcome of an\nindividual volition and \" the direct influence of God upon our soul.\"\nIt should be stated that Dr Quercy considers such experiences as\nSt Theresa's very rare and to be distinguished from the various types\nof hallucination which he discusses in his second volume. St\nTheresa's hallucinations were, in fact, what a student of psychical\nresearch would call \" veridical,\" although Dr Quercy does not any-\nwhere discuss this aspect of the problem, or consider the possibility\nthat in persons less gifted than the saint an hallucination may some-\ntimes have a supernormal source.\nIn his second volume Dr Quercy describes and discusses all the\nvarious kinds and degrees of sensory illusion and hallucination\noccurring either in a more or less normal state, or in highly abnormal\nstates, as in various forms of insanity, under the influence of drugs\nand so forth. He includes an account of some personal experiences\nof his own during illness.\nThe conclusion to which he comes is that our sensory experiences\nmay be grouped in three classes :\n(1) We may perceive an object which is actually present (normal\nsensory perception).\n(2) We may perceive an object which is not present (externalised\nhallucination).\n(3) We may have quasi-sensory impressions of an object which is\nneither present nor actually perceived (visualisation and sensory\nillusions of various kinds, including hypnagogic illusions).\nH. de G.

The results were in many cases very striking\n(far beyond anything that can reasonably be attributed to chance),\nbut unfortunately the conditions in which most of the experiments\nwere carried out were not altogether satisfactory.\nIn the experiments in clairvoyance with Chizuko Mifune, for\nexample, the medium, and especially her hands, were on most\noccasions under very imperfect observation owing to her persistence\nin sitting with her back to the observers.

W. Mitchell in the chair.\n\fJune 1931 Private Meeting 91\nMr W. H. Salter opened a discussion on poltergeists, and said,\nin part :\nThe importance of poltergeists to the study of paraphysical\nphenomena need not be stressed at length. It is sufficient to recall\nthat the whole of the modern spiritualist movement can be traced\nback to the Hydesville rappings in 1848. Podmore somewhere calls\npoltergeists the ferae naturae of spiritualism : they might perhaps\nwith equal appropriateness (and better grammar) be described as its\nenfants terribles. There are many problems of the seance-room whose\nsolution can be facilitated by the study of poltergeists, problems\nrelating to the phenomena themselves, problems of evidence, and\nespecially problems concerning the psychology of mediums.\nMrs Brackenbury, who has a very extensive personal experience\nof investigating poltergeist cases, has recently been engaged in\nlooking through the Society's collection of cases, which after nearly\n50 years of continual research, is a very extensive one. Some of\nthese cases have been printed in Proceedings or the Journal ; others\nhave never been printed at all, and I feel sure that a careful stock-\ntaking will bring to light many points of great interest.\nThe last time the Society had a stocktaking was in 1896, when\nPodmore contributed to Proceedings (xii. 45-115) a detailed analysis\nof all the cases (eleven in number) which the Society had up to that\ndate investigated, together with notes on some other cases reported\nto but not investigated by the Society. Podmore summarised his\nfindings as follows (p. 114) :\n\" (1) In the eleven cases which we have\ninvestigated in detail, direct proofs of trickery have been found in\nseveral instances. (2) Where the phenomena have been recorded\nshortly after their occurrence by educated persons, trickery is found\n\u2014moral considerations apart\u2014to be an adequate explanation. (3)\nWhere the phenomena have been described by illiterate persons, or\nrecorded some time after the event, this explanation becomes diffi-\ncult ; and the difficulty is found to increase directly with the length\nof the interval and inversely with the education of the witnesses.\n(4) But these eleven cases are fairly representative of their class.\"\nThis paper led to a lively controversy between Podmore and\nAndrew Lang (Proceedings, xvii. 305-36). Lang held, relying almost\nentirely on the classic cases of ancient date, such as the Drummer of\nTedworth, that there was more in it than trickery. In 1911, shortly\nafter Podmore's death, Sir W. Barrett reopened the question with\na paper (Proceedings, xxv. 377-412) in which he analysed six cases,\ntwo of which he had himself investigated in Ireland. On the strength\nof these he maintained\nkt\nthat fraud and hallucination are inadequate\nto explain all the phenomena.\"' That is, I think, the last occasion\non which the general poltergeist problem, as distinct from particular\ncases, has been discussed before the Society.\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1931\nThe question whether there is any supernormal element in polter-\ngeist cases is not one on which general agreement can ever be expected.\nIn a few cases actual trickery, or preparations for trickery, have been\nobserved, but in the majority of cases there are so many doubtful\nfactors that the observer's or reader's judgment is likely to be\ndetermined by his general attitude to paraphysical phenomena.\nThe evidence in poltergeist cases is rarely of a high order. Much of\nit is circumstantial : things happen, or are alleged to happen, in one\nplace while all the independent observers are elsewhere. If they\nhappen in the presence of observers, it is rarely that the whole\nphenomenon is seen from start to finish : to take a common instance,\nthe supposed movement of objects without contact : the objects\nare seen in motion and coming to rest : the beginning of the move-\nment is not often seen by any independent observer. If to these\ndifficulties is added the fact that the only witnesses are often\nuneducated persons in a state of excitement, whose statements are\nonly recorded some time after the event, it becomes obvious that\na wide diversity of opinion as to the supernormality of any case is\nhighly probable.\nIf however opinions differ as to the interpretation of the facts,\nit is all the more striking that there is a strong resemblance between\nthe facts reported by the different S.P.R. investigators, notwith-\nstanding that these have throughout the Society's history included\nmen and women of the most divergent views as to the reality of\nsupernormal phenomena, from out and out spiritualists to case-\nhardened sceptics. I do not mean that there is not a considerable\nvariety as regards the phenomena produced, noises, movements of\nobjects and so on ; but that there emerges from a reading of the\ncases a fairly definite type of situation, which is sufficiently uniform\nto make it a not unreasonable inference that causes which can be\ndefinitely proved in some cases are probably operating in the\nothers.\nIt is impossible to read a number of poltergeist cases without\ncoming to the conclusion that in investigating such cases education\nand general intelligence are not enough : some specialised know-\nledge of the problems of psychical research is essential. The recorded\ncases may be classified under four heads in a steeply descending\nscale of evidential value as follows :\n(1) cases where a trained investigator has been present during\nthe occurrence of some of the phenomena ;\n(2) cases where a trained investigator, without actually witnessing\nany of the phenomena, has obtained first-hand reports\nfrom witnesses shortly after the occurrence of phenomena,\nand has cross-examined the witnesses ;\n\fJune 1931 Private Meeting 93\n(3) cases where phenomena have been witnessed by persons of\ngood education without specialised training\n;\n(4) other cases.\nThere are several problems, including that of supernormality, on\nwhich it seems to me that the evidence supplied by the first group\nof cases enormously outweighs that contributed by all the other\ngroups, the fourth group (i.e. cases resting solely on the reports of\nuntrained and uneducated witnesses) being practically worthless.\nApart, however, from the question of supernormality, on which\nopinions differ, there are several points on which there seems to be\na consensus of opinion, as will be seen if the conclusions appended\nby Podmore and Sir W. Barrett to their respective papers are\ncompared.\nThus it may be taken as fairly well established that the phenomena\nare associated with some particular person : they do not occur \" out\nof the blue,\"' so to speak. A few cases can be traced to impersonal\nnatural causes, loose tiles, dripping drain-pipes, rats and so on : for\nthe most part, however, cases of this type do not get reported to us.\nOccasionally it appears that there is more than one medium con-\ncerned in their production, or that when once poltergeist phenomena\nhave been started, other persons besides the medium deliberately\nexploit them for their own ends by faking additional phenomena.\nA second point of agreement is, to quote Sir W. Barrett, that\n\" the disturbances are usually though not invariably, associated\nwith the presence of a child or young person of either sex.\"'\nThe geographical distribution of poltergeists has perhaps not\nreceived adequate attention. Cases of course occur all over the\nworld, but although the S.P.R. collection includes cases from several\nforeign countries, I am considering for the present their distribution\nwithin Great Britain. In going through our collection recently, I\nwas struck by the comparative rarity of cases occurring in large towns.\nOur country is a highly industrialised one and by far the larger part\nof our population is concentrated in large towns and cities. Out of\nall our cases, London indeed contributes a fair proportion. But\nthe other big cities of Gt Britain do not between them contribute\none. A few come from medium-sized towns, but the largest number\ncome from small towns or villages. If therefore our collection is\nrepresentative, and there is no reason to suppose that it is not, it\nis clear that the villages and the small towns are the poltergeists'\nspiritual home. This is probably due to a combination of two\ncauses :\n(1) there are more distractions for the young in large towns\nand consequently less boredom, and boredom seems to be a condition\nfavourable to the development of the poltergeist psychology in the\n.adolescent ; (2) country folk (I speak as a rusticised Londoner) are\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1931\nmore inclined to belief in the supernatural, especially when it takes\na form as traditional as the poltergeist.\nThat imitation plays a considerable part is certain. If a case is\nmade much of in the press it is almost certain to be followed at a\nshort interval by other cases, especially in the neighbourhood.\nOf such cases, providing verifiable evidence of intelligence, I do\nnot think we have a full report of any later than the Derrygonelly\ncase, investigated by Sir W. Barrett in 1877. In that case Sir\nWilliam reported that he several times asked the raps to say how\nmany fingers he had open in his pocket, and got correct answers\neach time. But more evidence than we so far possess seems to be\nneeded before we can safely assume that the possession of super-\nnormal knowledge goes with poltergeist phenomena.\nIntelligence is of course shown where the phenomena have an\nobvious motive, e.g. to get the medium out of uncongenial sur-\nroundings, or to frighten away someone whose presence is dis-\ntasteful, but that is another matter.\nIn conclusion a word must be said as to the ethics of poltergeist\ninvestigation. Poltergeist cases, whether supernormal or not, are\ncertainly pathological, and the first duty of the investigator, trans-\ncending even his duty to increase our scientific knowledge, is to see\nthat nothing occurs to make the child-medium's mental or physical\nstate worse than it already is. These cases inevitably attract\npublicity : a generation ago this was merely local publicity. The\nvillage neighbours were all agog and the local papers wrote the case\nup. That was bad enough, but modern journalistic methods have\nmade things much worse. The cheap London press gets on to the\njob, and unless a particularly enthralling murder happens to\ncoincide, exploits the case to the fullest, regardless both of the child's\nwelfare and any serious scientific interest. Any investigator who\ncares to join in the journalistic hue and cry can of course get his\nshare of the limelight.\nThis, I need hardly say, has never been the practice of the S.P.R.\nor of our investigators, who have habitually followed the line of\nallaying local excitement, getting the child's parents to understand\nwhat the cause of the disturbances is, and giving such advice as\nwill prevent these unhealthy occurrences being renewed. Tactful\nhandling of such cases has undoubtedly in the past led to the\nrestoration of the child to normal mental health. For an example\nsee vol. xvii. 85-95 of the Journal, one of the rare cases in which\nthe child medium came from an educated household.\nBut it is possible that this practice has had a curious result. The\nchild who produces poltergeist phenomena is likely, especially if\nencouraged rather than checked, to develop into a regular medium,\nas happened -to the Fox sisters, the authors of the original Hydes-\n\fJune 1931 Private Meeting 95\nville rappings. Now poltergeist cases have ever since the Society's\nfoundation, been more carefully followed up in England than\nanywhere else, and with more consideration for the . medium's\nwelfare. During the same period our country, the birthplace of\nHome and Stainton Moses, has been curiously infertile in the\nproduction of physical mediums. Are these two facts quite unrelated\nor may it be that if we had allowed the poltergeist phenomena to\nrun riot in their infancy, we might now be enjoying as creditable\na crop of adult physical mediums as any country in central or east\nEurope can boast %\nMrs Brackenbury read a more detailed account of the case\nalready summarised in the Journal (xxvi. 104-5).\nMr A. W. Trethewy referred to certain Indian poltergeist pheno-\nmena of which there had been some recent discussion. A detailed\naccount of the case in question was given by Mrs Goldney, who had\npersonally investigated it. The Rev. J. W. Hayes gave his personal\nimpressions of the phenomena reported by Mrs Brackenbury. The\nRev. W. S. Irving, Mr A. H. Strawson, Dr V. J. Woolley, and Mr\nJ. Hettinger also contributed to the discussion.\nA CASE OF APPARENT HAUNTING IN MOSCOW.\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nIn the Russian daily paper Vozrojdenie, printed in Paris, there\nappears, in the number of 17 December 1930 and under the title of\n\" Ghosts I did not notice,\" a narrative by M. Nicholas Tchebysheff\n(now living at Meudon near Paris), who is well known to me.\nM. Tchebysheff was, when Nicholas II was overthrown (March\n1917), attorney to the Court of Appeal in Moscow. The Provisional\nGovernment appointed him Senator. Under General Denikin he\nwas from January to July 1919 at the head of the Home Department;\nand his last official post was, I believe, that of manager of General\nWrangel's political chancery at Belgrade. I think I may also call\nhim a pressman.\nThe Vozrojdenie narrative is picturesque and interesting, but too\nlong to be translated verbatim. I will therefore content myself with\nsumming it up.\n\"It is the only instance [in my experience],\" M. Tchebysheff\nsays,\n' l\nwhen I am ready to swear on the Gospel that ghosts, phan-\ntoms, powers from the Beyond there were, the fact that I did not\nperceive them notwithstanding : the marvellous [element] that was\nnear me did not pay attention to me, did not reveal itself to my\nsight and hearing. . . . This story I will relate as it actually occurred,\nlike a proces-verbal, not adding one word. Let my narrative serve\nas document.\"\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1931\nIn January 1909, M. Tchebysheff pursues, he was transferred\nfrom Smolensk to Moscow. He put up at an hotel and began to\nlook for a flat. He soon got a letter from a lady unknown to him\n(she subsequently turned out to be pale and good-looking\n11\nwith\nbig, sad eyes \"), offering him to take her flat in Kounin's house\u2014\na\nbrand-new five storied building at the corner of Pretchistenka and\nSmolensky boulevard. M. Tchebysheff called on the lady and liked\nthe flat, which comprised four rooms, a bath-room and a kitchen.\nHe had the impression that the lady looked rather ill at ease and\nwanted to tell him something, but dared not. She mentioned that\nshe now lived at her mother's and had not stayed in the flat long.\n\" I do come sometimes in the day,\" she added.\nM. Tchebysheff moved into the flat where nothing unusual\nhappened up to August, when he moved into another apartment\nfor financial reasons. More than once, he tells us, he did afterwards\nregret the Smolensky boulevard four rooms.\nLater in the same autumn he met the lady at a concert. He did\nnot at first recognise her. \" I am much in fault towards you,\" she\nsaid. \" It is impossible to live in that flat.\"\nM. Tchebysheff informed the lady he had moved into another\nhouse. Whereupon she said :\n\" Of course you could not live there\ntoo and so you went away. I could not stand it even a week : it\nwas something incessantly terrible.\"\nHe explained he had left the house because the landlord had\nraised the rent. Here the conversation rather abruptly terminated,\nM. Tchebysheff being with a few friends. To the lady he said he\nwould ring her up.\nOn thinking the matter over, he recollected in connection with\nthe flat in Kounin's house the following incident. Nothing at all\nhad happened there to himself, but once in July P., a friend of his,\ncame to stay with him for a few days. The very first night (appar-\nently), M. Tchebysheff felt himself awakened : it was P., pale, nay\nwhite, his eyes wide with fear, his chin trembling.\n\" It is impossible to sleep there. I cannot sleep there,\" he said.\nHe had been spending the night in the sitting room. M. Tcheby-\nsheff took his place and slept soundly till the morning. On waking\nup he learned that P. had left for the country.\nHe was unable to telephone to the lady as he had forgotten her\nname. But meeting P. a couple of days later, he asked him to\nexplain what had happened. In spite of much insistence he failed\nhowever to obtain an answer satisfactory to him.\nHe had as man-servant a Pole named Augustine who had been\nwith him a fortnight in Kounin's house, and questioned him. \" Did\nyou not notice, Sir,\" the Pole replied, \" that in that flat you had\nconstantly to change servants ?\n\" In fact, M. Tchebysheff recollected\n\fJune 1931 A Case of Apparent Haunting in Moscow ^97\nthat such had been the case. Now a cook would go away, now a\nman-servant. Twice people left without warning, leaving no address.\nAs to the cause of such a behaviour Augustine (he was unable to\nexpress his thoughts adequately either in Russian or in ^Polish)\nmerely stated these people had said it was \" too frightful \" there.\nHe admitted when hard pressed that he had never spent there the\nnight himself\u2014though apparently for reasons of quite a \" mundane\n\"\ncharacter\nJ\nAs stated to M. Tchebysheff by an old inhabitant of Moscow, a\nchurch and cemetery had once existed on the spot where Kounin's\nhouse was subsequently built.\nM. Tchebysheff concludes his account by expressing the hope\nthat maybe the \" lady \" is now somewhere out of Russia too and\nwill communicate with him. Hitherto, so far as I know, this hope\nhas not been fulfilled.\nIn a letter to me dated 21 December 1930, M. Tchebysheff writes\nthat the Vozrojdenie \" had neither added nor changed anything m\nmy protocol-like narrative.\" The latter has not been adorned by\nhim, he says, in any way, being a conscientious description based\non memory, in which M. Tchebysheff mentioned only what he firmly\nremembered.\nThough unavoidably very incomplete his account seems to me\nvaluable. It is likely that something like \" haunting \" was in fact\nat the bottom of the whole occurrence, though absolute certainty\non this point obviously fails us. The most curious point is of course\nM. TchebyshefFs apparent and complete \" unreceptivity.\" Surely\nit detracts nothing from the value of the opinion : rather the\nreverse. For if the fear to which the little flat gave birth was due\nto some natural but undetected cause, it is very strange that M.\nTchebysheff should not have shared in the impression. It would be\ninteresting to know whether there are on record many other more\nor less well attested cases of alleged haunting presenting the same\ncharacteristic and puzzling feature.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE ENCHANTED BOUNDARY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir\u2014I do not desire the printing of this letter unless what is\nstated therein has intrinsic interest for psychical research, since it\nwould be repugnant to me that it should be regarded as a reper-\ncussion to criticisms made in the gracious review, printed in the\nlast Proceedings, of my book, The Enchanted Boundary. Indeed, I\nthink the reviewer has grounds in the form and appearance of\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1931\ncertain features and passages of the book, for every one of these\nfew criticisms. Some things which are to be made very manifest\nin the book now preparing, which presents the case-results of the\nquestionnaire, should have been at least hinted in its predecessor.\nSuperficially it would seem, although this point is not brought up\nin the review, as though directing the questionnaire only to persons\nlisted in Who's Who in America, were also \" an interesting illustra-\ntion of American standards,\" but the reasons and justification for\nthis, I think will be made apparent. Turning to the purported\nillustration which is mentioned, I doubt if it is characteristic of\ncultured Americans to rate a person's testimony according to whether\nor not he belongs to a church, and am quite certain that this is no\nstandard of mine. But there is a scientific superstition, not entirely\ncircumscribed by American boundaries, that opinions as to the\nexistence of psychical facts, and especially the experiencing of\npurported psychical incidents, are largely conditioned on the\npresence or absence of religious belief. Included in the forthcoming\nEeport will be several classifications of respondents to the\nquestionnaire, which will have some though limited value, and one\nof them will be for the purpose of testing that issue. Entering\nchurch affiliations among the biographical data in the volume\nalready printed without explanation does, indeed, easily lead to\nan erroneous inference.\nI also readily acknowledge it regrettable that I, in some instances..\n\" improved \" my own letters to correspondents, for the purpose of\npublication, that is without making it clearer why and how I did\nso. Let us consider the matter, for it is an important point in\nliterary ethics. Certainly it would have been most reprehensible to\nalter or add a word to a letter of my correspondent. It would be\nan offence to change anything in a letter of mine if anything after-\nward written by that correspondent and published by me hinged\nupon it.\nBut when I print a correspondent's letter with his consent, I may\nreply to it, for the sake of the public, if I choose, in entire disregard\nof what I happened to have written in my letter to him personally.\nI think we will all agree on that, provided that I make no claim that\nI am giving the original letter. That being the case, what possible\nobjection can there be to the presentation of my argument made\nfor the benefit of the public, in part, and only in part, be that part\ngreat or small, in the language of the original letter, provided I\ndeclare that this is being done ? My original responses were made\nto correspondents without the idea in mind of printing them, and\nthey involve, as amongst themselves, many repetitions. What\npossible objection can there be, so long as there is no secret about it,\nto saving time by using the original responses in whole or part, but\n\fJune 1931 Correspondence 99\n\" improving \" the wording of certain infelicitous phrases, omitting\nparagraphs rather than print them again and again, and even\nsometimes substituting another case-illustration for one already too\nfrequently used ? I may not improve my opponent's style or argu-\nment\u2014all I can do is to give him fair warning and incite him to do\nhis best ; but my own argument, made to readers of the bcok, I\nmay \" improve \" with impunity as much as I choose, even to entire\ndisregard of what was written to the person himself. If any differ\nwith this opinion, I hope to hear from them in the Journal.\nThe reviewer has certainly pointed out defects in another passage.\nBut while I did unfortunately follow the question whether all\npsychical researchers agree that any types of phenomena are\nsupernormal by the answer \" yes,\" I afterward and somewhat\ninconsistently modified this answer by the expressions \" practically\nunanimous agreement,\" \" generally agreed,\" and \" practical agree-\nment.\" It should not be forgotten that the term \" psychical\nresearcher \" was carefully denned and limited in its application.\nBut even at that it was not limited sufficiently to represent my\nmeaning, as I have stated elsewhere in print but forgot to do by\nfootnote in the book. The psychical researchers I had in mind as\nbeing generally agreed, not absolutely but \" practically \" unanimous,\nwere those who not only have had much experience in \" this field,\"\nbut also have had personal experience with the particular type\nreferred to, in connection with exponents of reputation. I doubt\nif any veteran psychic researcher has been quite convinced regarding\nany particular type unless he has had considerable personal experi-\nence with such psychics as are capable of it. Psychometrical\npsychics capable of impressive work are very, very rare, as I stated.\nCan the reviewer \" name several \" (i.e. more than two) psychical\nresearchers, as defined, who have themselves had numerous experi-\nments with psychometrists that have convinced any whom they\nregard as their peers, and who are not themselves convinced ? If\nhe can I shall never again say \" practically unanimous agreement\n\"\nor \" generally agreed \" in reference to psychometry, and as it is\nshall more carefully guard its terms hereafter. It may be that the\nemployment of the word -practically in the sense of \" approximately,\nas a general rule of practice, with negligible exceptions,\" and the\nuse of the word generally in the sense of approaching universality,\non the whole,\" are Americanisms. If so I want to know it, being\ndesirous of employing words only according to such definitions as are\nintelligible to English-speaking people everywhere.\nNaming types of psychical phenomena is one of the most difficult\nthings to do satisfactorily. I usually employ names which as little\nas possible convey in themselves a theory of origin, terms which\nare descriptive of the outer appearance of things, even if they are\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psycldeal Research June 1931\ndrawn from popular usage. \" Telepathy \" is a word which may\nannounce a theory, but in so entitling one of the four named types\nI simply refer to those sets of facts which look like thought-trans-\nference. Veridical apparitions (not limited to those of the dying)\nmay be all telepathically caused, but are a quite different class of\nphenomena. I did not say whether I thought that they demonstrate\nanything more than telepathy because it was not germane for my\npurpose to discuss, in that place, theories of causation. By \" me-\ndiumistic deliverances \" (one rather shrinks from the term \" message\nmediumship \" as that seems to announce a theory) I of course was\nunderstood to refer to those deliverances, vocal or written, pur-\nporting to be from the spirits of the dead. For once, I must dis-\ntinctly differ from my friend the reviewer, and declare this a type\nof phenomenon in itself. It is what, in its appearance, is different\nfrom what I classed as \" telepathy,\" \" apparitions,\" and \" psycho-\nmetry.\" Theoretically, of course, all four might be telepathic in\ntheir nature.\nMr Besterman says \" it would have been interesting to have been\ntold whether Dr Prince believes in any forms of psychometry\nbeyond such as can be explained by telepathy.\" I am very willing\nto answer the implied question. I do not know by what interior\nprocess the psychometrical results which I have witnessed, and\nwhich I am convinced were supernormal, in the work of Sra. de Z\nand Mrs King were produced ; but I very much doubt if all could\nbe explained by what we at present know, or have any scientific\nright to assume, about telepathy.\nTake the experiment with Mrs King referred to on pages 145-6 of\nThe Enchanted Boundary, fully reported in the Proceedings of the\nA. S.P.R. for 1924, pp. 204-18, and discussed in Bulletin XI of the\nB. S.P.R., pp. 10-14. Certainly of the 34 statements tested, 33 of\nwhich were correct and the remaining one partly so, many were\nknown to me, so, theoretically, could have been obtained from me\nby thought transference. Even at that, the result would surpass\nthat of any experiments of which I know, instituted for the express\npurpose of testing telepathic ability. Nine of these facts were not\nknown to me at the time, and several never were known to me, as\nthat the church was built of \" grey stone.\" (The stone was covered\nwith plaster painted brown, and I would have supposed that bricks\nlay beneath.) But let us put all these facts aside. I had certainly\nformerly known that the writer of the letter had made a journey to\nBoston and New Haven, and had known that he mentioned these\nplaces in a letter. But at the time of the experiment, more than\nfour years later, I had no knowledge nor thought that I had brought\nthat very letter. I had taken the letter which, folded small, was to\nbe placed between the flat palms of the psychic and, in bright\n\fJunk 1931 Correspondence 101\nsunlight, so remain until the experiment was over, out of a file of\nsome eighteen letters by a clergyman, in no chronological order,\nand I had carefully refrained from looking inside it. But, while most\nof her true statements (which, taken together, exceeded chance\nexpectation about five quadrillion times) could not have been\ndivined by reading the whole letter, the mention of a journey,\nnaming of Boston, and terms describing another city and applying\nto New Haven as it would not to one city out of a hundred, showed\nknowledge, somehow derived, of a part of the contents of the letter\nitself. I have shown ad nauseam, in the publications named above,\nthe absurdity of supposing that the woman could have glimpsed\na word in the letter.\nBut I did not know that the references were in the letter. To\nsuppose telepathy from me is to suppose that I subconsciously not\nonly remembered so much of the contents of this letter but also\nthe very creases of the white outside pages, through the several\nyears since I had read it, and thus was able, still subconsciously,\nto identify it. For something or somebody was able to select three\nreferences, correct for no other letter from that correspondent. We\nget no help by imagining that the telepathic wave came 190 miles\nfrom the clergyman who wrote the letter, who knew nothing about\nthe experiment, and could not himself have known that I took the\nletter or what letter I took unless by another telepathic wave to\nhis subconscious, from my subconscious endowed with genius to\nidentify an old letter and to rejuvenate its contents by reference to-\ncreases or other obscure marks on its blank outside.\nI have no other solution how the thing was accomplished, but\nfor all that, I do not yet believe that my subconscious has that degree\nof demideific endowment. I really wish that some one would study\nthis case in detail, and, if only as an exercise in dialectics, or in the\ncapacity of advocatus diaboli, would argue that all its items were\ntelepathically derived, and attempt to point out what were probably\ntheir several sources, and the avenues by which they reached their\ndestination in the consciousness of Mrs King. I am inclined to give\npreferential attention to every claim of telepathy which can be\nmade even plausible to the intelligence, but am not disposed to\nemploy the word as a mere talisman to exorcise the perplexing\nproblems of psychical research.\nNothing in this letter is to be taken as controversial, in the in-\nvidious sense of the word. I am even more grateful to Mr Besterman\nfor pointing out obscurities and infelicities of statement, to which I\n(and he) could add other examples, than for his commendations.\nYours, etc.,\nWalter Franklin Prince.\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1931\n[I am more than gratified with the gentle and instructive reproof\nthe criticisms on which I ventured have drawn from the President.\nOn two points only I must beg leave to remain obstinate. Dr\nPrince claims the right to improve his letters under the circumstances\nhe has outlined above. But let Dr Prince put himself in the position\nof one of those correspondents he so scientifically excoriates.\nWould such a one not be entitled to say :\n\" It is very easy for you\nto make me look a fool when you've touched up your letters ; if\nyou had only given me the same opportunity how easily I could\nhave turned the tables on you !\n\" We may not believe for a moment\nthat any of Dr Prince's correspondents could have turned the tables\non him, but still ! Could not the difficulty have been met, I wonder,\nby dropping the letter form altogether ?\nThe more important point is Dr Prince's implied assertion that\nonly a student of psychical research who has had much experience\nof a particular phenomenon is entitled to a hearing on that pheno-\nmenon. Surely this is a revolutionary principle in scientific work ?\nHave I no right to be sceptical about the rope-trick because I have\nnever been in the East, or to believe in phantasms of the living\nbecause I have never experienced one ? I think that a fuller\nstatement of our President's views in this matter would be welcomed\nby our members.\n\u2014\nTh.B.]\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nRevue Metapsychique, January-February 1931.\nM. and Mme Magrou of the Pasteur Institute print a paper on\nthe action at a distance exerted by living organisms.

McDougall in the Chair.\nMr Theodore Besterman read, in part, a paper entitled\n\" Further Inquiries into the Element of Chance in Booktests,\" in\nwhich he described two series of control experiments in booktests.\nThe paper is published in Part 121 of Proceedings.\nThe Chairman congratulated Mr Besterman on a very interesting\npiece of research and asked Mrs Salter to describe the way in which\nshe gave her booktests.\nMrs Salter said that she wrote clown these booktests in the Society's\nlibrary after putting herself in the same sort of frame of mind as that\nin which she did her automatic writing. She was very much sur-\nprised that she had scored some lucky shots and did not see any\nreason to suppose that she had any of the curious faculty that appa-\nrently lay behind booktests. In reply to a question by Professor\nMcDougall, Mrs Salter said that she did not think that her booktests\nwere written automatically. Mr Besterman pointed out, however,\nthat they were not in Mrs Salter's ordinary handwriting.\nProfessor E. R. Dodds suggested that Mrs Salter's success might\nbe due to her knowledge of the sort of books likely to be found on\nMr Besterman' s shelves. In his own case he had some general\nknowledge of this kind and had been tempted to make use of it for\nthe booktests he sent in, but he had actually done them by a process\nakin to free association. Mrs Salter, referring to her best hit, said\nthat she had no special reason to suppose that Mr Besterman would\npossess anything bearing on pottery. Mr Besterman said that he had\nto confess that Professor Dodds was one of those deliberately asked\nto take part in the experiment in view of the greater likelihood in\ntheir cases of obtaining successes. It had been the special purpose\nof this particular experiment to load the dice as heavily as possible\nin favour of chance. But none of the persons so chosen had ob-\ntained any success.\ng2\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\nThe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas suggested that a point in favour of\nMrs Leonard's booktests, and one which was not capable of statistical\nevaluation, was the special appositeness of the tests. For instance,\nin one case known to him Feda gave an indication to a particular\nplace where a reference to a certain person would be found. The\nperson in question was the son of a wine merchant, and when the\nreference was verified it was found to be, \"I am truly a son of\nBacchus.\" Mr Thomas gave other examples of a similar kind. He\nthought that Mr Besterman's paper had shown conclusively that\nthe booktests received from Mrs Leonard were not the result of\nchance coincidence. Mr Besterman said that he appreciated the\nvalue of Mr Drayton Thomas's point. He did not think, however,\nthat he could fully agree with Mr Thomas's contention. In his\nopinion a simple and concrete reference was more valuable than a\nsymbolical or allusive one. Thus, \" He is truly a son of Bacchus\n\"\nwas a statement which required interpretation and one which could\nbe interpreted in several senses. Had the reference been, \" I am\ntruly the son of a wine merchant,\" it would have been a definite and\nunequivocal hit.\nMr Salter said that no doubt Mr Besterman agreed that the\npeculiar appropriateness of a booktest to the sitter receiving it was an\nessential part of such a test and one which would be taken into\naccount in the statistical evaluation of it. Mr Besterman assented.\nDr Hornell Hart suggested that when an actual booktest was\nverified the book indicated by the medium should be placed\namong a number of other books, and that the sitter should then be\nasked to pick out the book which he thought corresponded to the\nmedium's indications. Mr Besterman agreed that this was a good\nplan, but was doubtful whether most sitters would agree to it.\nThere were also practical difficulties.\nTHE SECOND MYERS MEMORIAL LECTURE\nThe Second Myers Memorial Lecture, by Dr T. W. Mitchell, has\nnow been published under the title Beneath the Threshold.

The attache-case con-\ntaining the volume of Pope was first opened after the sitting, and\nthe booktest verified, in Miss Newton's presence. Th. B.\n\fJuly 1931 Correspondence 109\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE ENCHANTED BOUNDARY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I will respond to the suggestion that I express myself more\nfully on the points in relation to which Mr Besterman conceives that\nwe disagree (see page 102 of the Journal). I am inclined to think\nthat, on the contrary, we agree when the facts are understood.\nThat Mr Besterman has not quite understood them is due in part to\nmy failing, in my letter which you have printed, to express myself\nas clearly as I thought had been done. Let us take up his two points\nin turr.\n1. The first is put in the form of a question whether my corre-\nspondents have not a right to complain that they might have made\na better showing had they been given an opportunity to touch up\ntheir letters, as I \" touched up \" mine. My answer is Yes, were the\nfacts such as Mr Besterman supposes them ;\nNo, since the facts are\nas follows :\n(1) Every correspondent was aware that his replies were subject\nto publication. (2) Every correspondent was asked whether or\nnot his name could be printed therewith, and unless he expressly\nassented it was suppressed. (3) Every correspondent was pursued\nwith appeals to \" improve \" and develop his thesis to the point that\nhe failed to answer, or else his letter is the last in the particular series\nto be printed. In such circumstances I maintain that I could with\nperfect propriety, for the sake of my readers, improve even my argu-\nment ;\nexactly as there is often printed an \" open letter \" ostensibly\nwritten to a person who never saw it until it appeared in a news-\npaper.\nBut, in fact, I never once improved or changed any argument.\nThe changes, which in a general way the reader was notified might\noccur, and which did occur in but a small percentage of my letters,\nwere limited to the following species : (1) the clarification of certain\nobscurities or correction of actual ingram maticisms resulting from too\nhasty dictation, (2) omission of paragraphs too often repeated to my\nvarious correspondents, and of formal or irrelevant matter, (3)\nsubstitution of case-illustrations for some also so often repeated that\nthey would have been tiresome to readers of the book, and one more,\nunstated in my previous letter, (4) corrections of erroneous punctua-\ntion. None of these, it will probably be agreed, put correspondents\nto any disadvantage. The whole object of pursuing them with\nletters was to draw them out to the fullest, and get their opinions\nput in the best possible shape. The only person from whom I feared\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\nany complaint was Mr Chauncey Thomas, and that because com-\npelled to condense and paraphrase his lengthy letters. But he\nexpressed his entire content with his treatment, and no whisper of\ndissatisfaction has come from any other.\nThe rock of offence\u2014and it is a real one\u2014was the careless use of\nthe word \"improve \" without explaining what it meant and how\nlimited was its application. Yes, and one other, which it is almost\nincredible that I have but just now observed, and of which the\nreviewer made no mention. My books for years show that my\npractice has been to designate long citations, not by quotation\nmarks but by distinguishing characteristics of typography. How\nin this book they came also to be enclosed in quotation marks, and\nhow it was possible for me not to have been conscious that they had\nbeen so typed, I do not know.\nThe two principles, that what professes to be a literal quotation\nshould be immaculate and that an academic opponent should be\ntreated with absolute fairness, are so incumbent that any appearance\nof delinquency in regard to either should be put to question.\n2. Mr Besterman's second point is that I have made an \" implied\nassertion that only a student of psychical research who has had much\nexperience of a particular [species of] phenomenon is entitled to a\nhearing on that [species ofj phenomenon.\"' If that is a correct\nunderstanding of anything written by me, it is more than a \" revolu-\ntionary principle,'' it is fatuity and fanaticism. But perhaps I can\ndemonstrate that I wrote nothing which ought to be so construed.\nLet us start at the bottom. In the Clark University lecture I\ndefined my understanding of the term \"psychical researcher \" or\nmy concept of the person deserving it, thus : \"A person of evident\nintelligence and cultivation, whose writings reveal acquaintance\nwith and employment of critical method, and who has had much\nexperience in this field and who is interested in the fixation of facts\nand not in propaganda.'* That was my definition, be it correct or\nincorrect, and I have not departed from it or narrowed it. The\npsychical researcher, however, is one thing, the psychical researcher\nconvinced is another thing. A man who measures up to the parti-\nculars enumerated, in my judgment, deserves the title, and has the\nright to be listened to with abounding respect, and his arguments\nare of course worth exactly what their own content make them worth,\nwhether or not one is arguing about a type or case of phenomena with\nwhich he himself has had personal contact. But when it comes to the\ndry statistical question what types of phenomena, if any, psychical\nresearchers in the main accept, it was necessary to add as a matter of\nfact that, at this stage of investigation, it seems as though a psychical\nresearcher must, in order to become thoroughly convinced of any\ntype of phenomena, have had adequate personal contact with it.\n\fJuly l'J31 Correspondence 111\nI was asserting, tentatively, not a point of ethics or propriety,\nbnt one of fact, a fact of our common human psychology. I did not\ndefend the fact any more than in case I had ventured the assertion\nthat the majority of people on shipboard in a storm became seasick,\nthis would have meant that I approved of their becoming seasick.\nIt might be quite reprehensible for them to be seasick, but that would\nbe aside from my point.\nMy statement is of a sort whose application is not peculiar to the\nfield of psychical research. Every major discoverer, such as Coper-\nnicus and Galileo, met the same inability to win full acceptance on\nthe part of any one, except and until persons themselves patiently\nretraced their footsteps and, as it were, came into personal contact\nwith the phenomena. That remained true until by this process a\nsufficient number of full converts, so to speak, had been gained so\nthat others surrendered to the influence of authority. The early\ndemonstrations of hypnosis, even up to past the time of Braid, were\nunable to convince scientific minds save the few curious enough to\nacquire personal experience with the phenomena.\nIt was such a fact which I asserted, without either approval or\nreprehension, and quite without any reference to respective rights of\ndiscussion. At least, I never had any such implication in mind,\nand cannot yet see how any sentence of mine bears such an inter-\npretation. Though I think that probably, in this period, no man\nhas become entirely assured, for instance, that some automatic\nwriting exhibits knowledge never normally acquired by the writer,\nunless he has had some personal experience in testing the conditions\nand watching the work of an automatic writer of that grade, I do\nnot hold that this final and satisfactory state of assurance to him is\ncommunicable or is to be taken into account at this stage, by any\nother man. I agree with Mr Besterman, most emphatically, that\nevery student of psychical research who has any good argument,\ndrawn from whatever source, is entitled to a hearing. And I concede\nto him his right to believe in the phantoms of the living though he\nhas never seen one, but must remind him that the experiencing of\nphantoms, as such, had been well established by the authority of\npsychologists without waiting for psychical research, and I may still\ndoubt if he could feel fully satisfied that such hallucinations were not\nmerely coincidental but telepathically caused, short of some personal\ncontact with what seemed to be actual cases of spontaneous or\nexperimental telepathy. If he could, I congratulate him on his\nindependence of the Zeit-Geist.\nYours, etc., Walter Franklin Prince.\n[I am very grateful to the President for his further elucidations, and\nI agree that our differences are more apparent than real. The first\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\npoint requires no further comment. In the second it now appears\nthat my mistake was in supposing that Dr Prince approved of the im-\nplication in the following sentence from his first letter (p. 99) :\n\" The psychical researchers I had in mind . . . were those who not only\nhave had much experience in '\nthis field,' but also have had personal\nexperience with the particular type referred to. . .\n.\" With Dr\nPrince's explanation that he merely stated the fact without giving it\nhis approval, my criticism falls to the ground. But I am glad that I\nmade it, for the President's two letters have thrown clear light on a\nmost interesting point.\n\u2014\nTh. B.]\nTHE MEDIUM FRAU SILBERT.\n[The following letter has been sent by Mr Rudolf Lambert to Mr\nBesterman, with a suggestion that it should appear in the Journal.\nIt contains matter of considerable interest to psychical research and we\ntherefore gladly print it. As our members are probably aware, Mr\nLambert is an Assistant-Editor of the Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie\nand has shown himself to be a man of open mind in regard to para-\nphxjsical phenomena.\u2014Hon. Ed.]\nDear Mr Besterman,\u2014I have been following with increasing\nindignation the purely personal attacks which have been made on\nyou in various quarters, and, most recently, by Professor Haslinger\nin the Zeitschrift filr Parapsychologie, because, like Dr Prince, you\nhave stated, in accordance with your duty and in the mildest possible\nway, that you detected Frau Silbert in fraud. This persecution\nangered me the more as I myself observed this medium's frauds in\nthree sittings at the end of March 1929. I therefore consider it my\nduty to throw my testimony into the scales, although I find it very\nhard to write against Frau Silbert's protectors in Graz. I am in fact\nin this dilemma, either to break a promise far too easily given to\nMessrs Haslinger and Walter, or silently to look on while the deluded\nadmirers of a fraudulent medium bait an honourable man. Before\nsetting out on my j\nourney I wrote to Professor Walter, without having\nbeen asked to do so, that \" even if I were to think that I had observed\nFrau Silbert's feet performing improper manipulations, I would\npublish nothing, since I am coming as a friend, who cannot after-\nwards attack those who have received him as such.\" I was the more\ndetermined to keep my word because I was unwilling to make my\ninvestigation of other physical mediums impossible by the publica-\ntion of an unfavourable report on Frau Silbert. Unfortunately I\nenlarged on this error by a second one, in that I did not tell Messrs\nHaslinger and Walter after the sittings exactly what I had observed.\nThe sittings had in fact left me no doubt about the nature of the pheno-\n\fJuly 1931 Correspondence 113\nmena produced, but I could not bring myself to tell these gentlemen,\nwho regard the medium as a saint, that the woman they honour is a\nswindler. I only sent them some hints on my observations, and thus\nmy considerate letters to them are to some extent contradictory of the\nreport I finished writing on 15 April 1929. Although the report was\nnot intended for publication, I showed it at that time in confidence to\nthree parapsychologists.\nWhen I read the manuscript of Prof. Haslinger's attack on you I\nat last wrote to him to inform him of my observations, and pointed\nout to him the unfairness of his controversial methods, which were\nonly possible \" because besides myself there are others who are\nprevented by personal considerations from publishing their observa-\ntion of Frau Silbert's untrustworthiness.\" It would certainly have\nbeen better if I had told Herr Haslinger in this letter that if he pub-\nlished his trivial attack I should no longer be able to keep silence.\nThere were two reasons why I did not do so : in the first place I had\nnot yet persuaded myself to take this course, and in the second place\nI expected that under the circumstances Herr Haslinger would\nspontaneously release me from my promise. As he did not do so\nand as he did not withdraw his attack, I at last made up my mind\nto write and tell him that I could no longer continue the silence I\nhad maintained for two years. Nor could his protest against my\nbreach of our agreement persuade me to support by silence the\nunscientific attacks of the fanatical defendants of Frau Silbert.\nI regret the necessity for these personal explanations : but they can\nserve to help the cause of scientific psychical research. For all these\nconsideratenesses, of which I present a notable example, falsify\nscience. I know that in a report favourable to Frau Silbert sus-\npicious movements of the medium, which, it is true, seemed unim-\nportant to the writer, remained unmentioned, because the observer\nwas unwilling to grieve the medium and her friends. I also know\nthat another of those who has reported on Frau Silbert in a completely\npositive sense, is persuaded of the genuineness of only some of the\nphenomena, and has observed other things which appeared to him\nhighly suspicious. So long as we report in this one-sided way,\nparaphysical phenomena will never be taken seriously. I hope that\nthe printing of my own sins will persuade other parapsychologists\nthat it is our solemn duty to publish without touching up all our\nexperiences : any other procedure is a crime against the spirit of true\nscience. We must refuse any proposal by a medium involving the\nnon-publication of unfavourable results, even if we are then allowed\nto see nothing.\nIt is impossible to communicate the whole of my material in a\nletter, and a selection from all three of my sittings might appear\none-sided. I therefore send you the report of my second sitting,\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\nomitting only some repetitions and other unessential details. The\nfollowing report of the sitting on 28 March 1929, at Professor Has-\nlinger's, is based on twelve pages of notes, mostly taken during the\nsitting.\nHaslinger's very heavy table has a strong cross-piece under it.\nTo my astonishment Haslinger, before the sitting, increased the size\nof the table top by adding leaves. Under these circumstances Frau\nSilbert, who was to sit at one of the narrow ends, would have been\nso far from the feet of the table and from the cross-piece as to make\nit much more difficult for her to lift the table with crossed knees and\nto use the cross-piece or feet of the table fraudulently as a lever or\nas a sounding board. According to the impressions formed at my\nfirst sitting I expected that Frau Silbert would ask to sit in the middle\nof the long side of the table or would object to the lengthening of it\n;\nshe took the latter course. At my request the tablecloth was re-\nmoved. In addition to myself, the following were present : Frau\nSilbert, an aunt of Haslinger's, Professor Hasbnger, his father, Frau\nWalter, Professor Walter, and Frau Krones. Frau Silbert sat\nalone at one of the narrow ends of the table, with myself on her right\nand Haslinger's aunt on her left. After we took our seats we heard\nraps. Frau Silbert thought that they came from the wall behind her,\nwhich I was unable to corroborate. Of a rap on the table in her\nimmediate neighbourhood she declared that it came from the other\nend of the table. Each sitter greeted the Control Nell with a \"Gott\nzum Gruss \" and three knocks on the table. Each time there came\nanswering raps from Frau Silbert's neighbourhood. The aunt's\nfoot was touched eleven times. Walter proposed that we should sit\ncloser to the table, which troubled me, as I sat far back to facilitate\nobservation. Frau Silbert pointed behind her and spoke of raps\nfrom outside ; I did not hear them there. Haslinger advised that\nthe lamp standing on a table behind me should be removed, because\nit threw light under the table ! There was now a lamp only on the\nseance table. Haslinger, next to his aunt, was touched on the knee.\nThe table moved, but it was very dark under it, though after a little\ntime the eye became accustomed to this. The aunt had put a little\nbell on the floor near Frau Silbert, and this bell now rang. I put\na bigger bell near my foot, where I could see it. Frau Silbert said,\n\" Strange that to-day everything is happening on the left side,\" that\nis, on the side of the aunt. The little bell between the aunt and Frau\nSilbert moved, but when I rose to see this phenomenon nothing\nhappened, though the movement began again when I sat down.\nRaps on wood in the immediate neighbourhood of Frau Silbert\n;\nrenewed raps were interpreted by some as a wish for darkness,\nwhich I supposed to be due to the fact that I was constantly looking\nunder the table. The wish, however, was not obeyed. Alleged\n\fJuly 1931 Correspondence 1 LI\nraps in the wall always appeared to me to come from below Frau\nSilbert. One after the other we asked Nell whether we were\nsatisfactorily seated, and each one accompanied his question with\nthree raps on the table, which Nell answered. Walter thought that\nNell's replies were rapped close to each sitter, but I always heard\nthe raps in the immediate neighbourhood of Frau Silbert. The little\nbell was heard again, and Frau Silbert declared it to be out of her\nreach, although it stood practically next to her feet. At Haslinger's\nrequest, following an order from Nell, I changed seats with the aunt.\nHitherto all the phenomena had taken place on Frau Silbert's left,\nand he wanted to move me closer to them. This change of seating\nappeared to me suspicious, for the lighting on the aunt's side was\nworse, since the lamp stood nearer my edge of the table.\nNell asked for darkness, Frau Silbert contradicted this, but we\nobeyed Nell. In complete darkness we heard many raps and also\nthe bell under the table just as Haslinger mentally asked for a\nphenomenon. The lamp on the table was again lit. I put the bigger\nbell near me on the cross-piece, and Frau Silbert showed me how she\nheld her feet in the dark during the phenomena ! The small bell,\nwhich was now near the aunt, was heard. After this Frau Silbert\nagain showed how she had held her feet during the phenomenon ;\nHaslinger directed the light of a pocket lamp on the now quite\ninnocent feet ! Then the bell near me fell from the cross-piece ;\nsome thought it had been swung, which would have required the\nuse of both the medium's feet. While I happened to be looking\naway the bell again fell. As if in reply to my unexpressed suspicion\nFrau Silbert picked up the bell with both feet and dropped it with\nthe words, \" Like this it falls at once \" !\nI put my watch on the cross-piece. Many touches were felt by\nthe aunt while the medium's feet were quite near her (the aunt).\nHaslinger announced raps everywhere, which to me, however, all\nappeared to come from the cross-piece. I looked quickly under the\ntable and saw Frau Silberfs foot on the cross-piece, from which it\nquickly withdrew. It was arranged that the aunt and I again\nexchange our seats. While we were doing this there were strong\nmovements' of the table. I now again sat at Frau Silbert's right.\nThere followed a luminous phenomenon under the table. But the\nmedium now had one hand under it, whereas till now her hands had\npractically always been on the table. There were several table\nmovements, but when I looked under the table nothing more\nhappened. In order to dissipate the resulting suspicion, the medium\nexplained that such lifting of the table could not be produced even\nwith both feet. As I wrote this down the table was again lifted a\nlittle. Such movements are easily produced with crossed knees. I\nagain looked under the table ;\nnothing happened. Then I pretended\n\f1 1 G Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\nto be quite inattentive, whereupon I noticed Frau Silbert's foot\non the cross-piece, from which it quickly withdrew ; the medium\nagain explained that it is impossible to lift the table with one's feet.\nThe little bell was heard between Frau Silbert's feet, and she tried\nto give the impression that it had been moved backwards. I\nthought that she had put the little bell in her left skirt pocket and\nwanted to verify this. As this was impossible from my place I\npretended that the bell might have flown behind a clock which\nstood behind the aunt. I walked round the table in order, appa-\nrently, to search behind the clock. As Frau Silbert thought me\noccupied I saw her manipulate the bell, though I was unable to\ndiscover the pocket I had suspected. Frau Silbert appeared to have\nseen my glance and adroitly threw the bell at Frau Krones, who stood\nnext to the chair I had left. As the bell fell near her Frau Krones\nsaid that it had hit her fairly high on the thigh under her skirt,\nand had fallen from there. The explanation is apparently as follows:\nFrau Krones was hit on the thigh, looked down, saw the bell, which\nhad in the meantime fallen to the edge of the skirt, and consequently\nthought that it had fallen from within the skirt. As I made notes\nof this occurrence the table again rose, but this never occurred when\nI looked under the table. There was now an interval for tea, with\ncessation of the phenomena.\nWhen the sitting began again the lamp was on the table. Frau\nSilbert thought that there were raps on the carpet behind her, but\nI did not hear them. The little bell fell from the cross-piece, and\nFrau Silbert showed by stretching her foot almost as far as the place\nat which the little bell had previously stood, that she could not reach\nso far with her foot. Now I heard raps of somewhat different kinds\nunder the table, but Frau Silbert said that the raps were behind her.\nI saw her foot on the cross-piece moving back from it, whereupon the\nraps ceased. Walter put a fiddle and bow on the floor under the\ntatle. We heard raps, and when I looked under the table I once\nmore saw Frau Silbert's foot withdrawing from the cross-piece.\nThe violin bow, one end of which was at Frau Silbert's feet, moved.\nI heard boots rubbing against each other. Frau Silbert explained\nthat the movements of the bow could not have been produced by her\nfeet, which was absurd in view of their position. Walter said that\nhe was delighted that I was having such a good sitting. Frau Sil-\nbert pointed behind her, but the raps came from below her. During\nfurther raps I glanced twice under the table and twice saw the\nmedium's left foot (that further from me) withdrawing from the\ncross-piece. Nell asked for darkness, and, as is always the case in\ndarkness, we had to form a chain, whereas in light the sitters' hands\nremained free on the table. This can hardly be explained otherwise\nthan by Frau Silbert's desire to know that all hands are controlled.\n\fJuly 1931 Correspondence 117\nThis is the more probable as Haslinger had prepared a pocket lamp\nwhich I was to have used unexpectedly, which was made rather\ndifficult when Frau Silbert held my left hand and Frau Krones my\nright one. The medium gave me her feet to control, but she did not\nclasp my left foot with both her feet. She put the points of her feet\nagainst one side of my foot, possibly hoping that I would not notice\nthe removal of one of her feet. But I moved my foot in such a way\nthat I was able to feel in succession the pressure of each of her feet,\nso that I at once observed when she removed one of her feet. As\nshe did so I was touched on the knee and then the curtain immedi-\nately behind Frau Silbert was moved. As she noticed that I was\nfeeling for her foot it came back, whereupon the phenomena ceased.\nDuring the curtain phenomena Frau Silbert declared that she saw\nthe beginning of a phantom, but nobody else saw it. During the\nsame period of darkness a light appeared suddenly to come from the\nsame curtain behind the medium ;\nbut before this she had released\nher hands from the chain and had moved them to about a yard from\nthe curtain.\nTowards the end of the period of darkness my watch appeared\nin Frau Silbert's hand ;\nimmediately before this we had observed\na light coming from the same hand. But as before this the chain had\nbeen broken for a minute she could in this time have taken the watch,\npreviously moved from the cross-piece with her feet. On this the\nsitting ended.\nI must observe that my notes on the period of darkness were\nwritten partly after the sitting, partly the following morning ;\ntheir sequence is therefore possibly not so accurate as that of the\nearlier part of the sitting. As a curiosity I add that once, as Frau\nSilbert noticed that I saw her foot leaving the cross-piece after raps\nhad been heard, she knocked on the foot of the table to show the\ndifference between genuine and fraudulent raps. But this hardly\nimpressed me, since Frau Silbert can vary the raps as she pleases.\nHow low an opinion this woman must have of her investigators when\nshe offers them such childish comparisons ! To the objection that I\nallowed Frau Silbert to cheat instead of really controlling her I reply\nthat one person is not enough for this purpose.\nUnless it be suggested that I have fabricated the above described\nindicia and direct observations of fraud, which are substantiated\nby the testimony of Dr Prince and yourself, everybody will agree\nthat Frau Silbert frequently gives purely fraudulent sittings, and\nmany will no doubt be inclined to regard the whole case as farcical.\nBut the problem is not so simple as that ; an English expert in\nconjuring told me that for some time it was difficult for him to pene-\ntrate Frau Silbert's tricks. I cannot think that such transparent\nsittings as mine were then in question. Further, a continental\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\nconjurer of international reputation, who does not believe in physical\nphenomena, told me that he has obtained engravings of objects and\nhas heard raps whilst himself controlling Frau Silbert, and that all\nnormal explanations fail him. As Dr Tischner's experiences\n(Zeitschriftfur Para'psychologie, Iv. 322 ff .) also are not to be explained\nby means of childish tricks, it may be worth investigating whether\nsuch phenomena are genuine, or whether they are produced by subtle\ntricks, with or without accomplices. This can only be decided by\nmeans of numerous sittings with adequate control above and below\nthe table. The supporters of the mediumship must recognise that\nthere could be no stronger argument against the existence of\ngenuine phenomena than the fact that since the publication of\nDr Prince's report (January 1928) obviously no such sittings can\nhave taken place, since Herr Haslinger in his article restricts himself\nto general considerations and to personal disparagements of you.\nFinally, I congratulate you on your reserve in face of the coarse\nattacks of Frau Silbert's disciples and on your refusal to take any\nnotice of these personal polemics, and I join myself to you in this\ndetermination, while I remain willing to give the reports of further\nsittings unprejudiced consideration.\nWith the expression of my warmest sympathy,\nI remain, yours very sincerely,\nRudolf Lambert.\n[Translated by Th. B.]\nREVIEWS.\nMax Dessoir, Vom Jenseits der Seele : die Geheimwissenschaften in\nJcritischer Betrachtung. 8vo, pp. xiv. 562, 4 plates. Sixth,\nrevised edition. Stuttgart : Ferdinand Enke, 1931. Price\nM. 16 unbound, M. 18 bound.\nThe previous edition of Professor Dessoir's well-known book was\nreviewed in the Proceedings, xxxii. 146. The present sixth edition\nhas been very extensively revised and enlarged, though the index\nhas unfortunately been very badly pared down. (It is rather odd,\nby the way, that notwithstanding the comparatively restricted\ninterest in Germany in scientific psychical research, a book such as\nthis, which maintains a high critical standard, should have gone into\nsix editions in about fourteen years.) As Professor Dessoir's general\nattitude and treatment have already been described by Professor\nSchiller in the above-mentioned review, it is perhaps only necessary\nto refer to a few points of special interest.\nAt pages 78-9 Professor Dessoir discusses the experiments in\nthought-transference with Professor Gilbert Murray, and suggests\nthat the successes obtained may be due to cryptomnesia. Since the\n\fJuly 1931 Reviews 119\nsubject chosen for telepathic transmission is not selected, of course,\nby Professor Murray himself, it is a little difficult to follow Professor\nDessoir's suggestion. In view of the almost universal tendency\namongst serious students of psychical research to reject a physical\nexplanation of telepathy, it is interesting to find Professor Dessoir\n(p. 86) proposing a physical explanation based on the possible trans-\nmission by the human organism of as yet unknown radiations of a\nstructure sufficiently complex to enable them to convey even in-\nvolved ideas.\nThe reader may be excused for feeling some alarm at being con-\nfronted with yet another term, and such a term ! , for psychometry :\npalaeoaesthetic clairvoyance (pp. 112 ff.). If Professor Dessoir is\ncontent to use the word Hellsehen (clairvoyance) in senses by no\nmeans always corresponding to the literal meaning of the word, on\nthe ground, presumably, that it has now attained historical re-\nspectability, is it not more convenient to allow the same considerations\nto apply to the word psychometry, which is also of fair antiquity \\\nIn a brief discussion (p. 137) of dowsing, Professor Dessoir very judi-\nciously explains the difficulties in the way of a physical explanation.\nThe author gives a lengthy account of clairvoyance in the service of\nmedical diagnosis, with special reference to Frau Elisabeth Frankl\n(pp. 152 ff.). Dr Kroner was good enough to give me a demon-\nstration of Frau FrankTs faculty in 1928, but although I thought\nhighly of the results I did not feel competent to report on them. I\ntherefore note with special interest that Professor Dessoir is im-\npressed by this lady's performance.\nProfessor Dessoir's attempt (pp. 187 ff.) at a theory of clairvoyance\nfollows, in its temporal aspects, the lines of Professor Broad's doc-\ntrine of the specious present. To his chapter on Mrs Piper the\nauthor has added in the present edition one on Mrs Leonard (pp.\n196 ff.), in which he discusses her mediumship in some detail. Of\nthe White case, in particular, he gives a full and very just account.\nProfessor Dessoir suggests that there is sometimes to be found, in the\nanalysis of mediumistic records, a desire \" to find a correspondence\nat all costs.\" And he cites, as an example, the notice printed in our\nJournal, xxv. 49-50. Here, it must be confessed, the author has\ntoo hastily jumped to a conclusion. A reference to p. 160 of the same\nvolume of the Journal would have shown Professor Dessoir that the\npurpose of the notice to which he refers was not so naive as he fears.\nProfessor Dessoir also discusses at some length the S.P.R. cross-\ncorrespondences (pp. 211 ff.). Unfortunately, the case he selects\nfor detailed consideration, \" One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life,\"\nis by no means the best that has been printed The author quotes\nMr A. F. Hall's ideal case, though not without showing appreciation\nof the impossibilist nature of Mr Hall's demands. In his discussion\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\n(pp. 226 ff.) of the sp\u00bbirit hypothesis, Professor Dessoir comes very\ndefinitely to the conclusion that the case is not proven.\nTurning to the paraphysical phenomena, Professor Dessoir has\nadded to his previous chapters on Slade, Eusapia Palladino and Anna\nRothe, further chapters on Heinrich (a German wartime poltergeist\nmedium), Maria Silbert, Willi and Rudi Schneider, Guzik, Kluski,\nEleonora Zugun, Mirabelli, and Margery. With all these mediums,\nexcept Mirabelli, the author has had personal experience, and with\nall of them he comes to an adverse conclusion, though in the case of\nMargery his views are only hinted at (p. 336). Professor Dessoir\nhas somewhat enlarged his chapters on fraud, conjuring, mediumistic\npsychology, etc., but they remain substantially as they were. His\ntheoretical application of the psychology of testimony to psychical\nresearch (pp. 339 ff.) is particularly interesting.\nThe remaining portions of Professor Dessoir's book deal with\nhistorical and philosophical questions (the Kabala, Christian Science,\nanthroposophy, magical idealism) with which we are only indirectly\nconcerned.\nProfessor Dessoir, who has been a Corresponding Member of the\nSociety for over forty years, has spent nearly half a century in the\nactive study and investigation of psychical research. This new\nedition of his book is a practically complete survey of the subject,\nwritten in the light of the author's exceptional knowledge and\nexperience, and from a consistently impartial and critical point of\nview. It is probably the best modern textbook we have, and is\ncertainly one that should be read by all who can follow the author's\nsimple and lucid German. A translation into English is greatly to\nbe desired. Theodore Besterman.\n\" Ephesian \" (C. E. Bechhofer Roberts), The Mysterious\nMadame : a Life of Madame Blavatsky. 8vo, pp. vii. 241,\nportrait. London : John Lane, 1931. Price 7s. 6d. net.\nThe compilation of a short biography of Mme Blavatsky presents\nexceptional difficulties. For the first forty years of her life, roughly\ntwo-thirds of the whole, the verifiable facts are most incomplete.\nShe herself discouraged inquiry into them, and such accounts as she\nfrom time to time vouchsafed to her followers proved on examination\nto be largely unverifiable and often untrue. For the latter part of her\nlife, that is, from her arrival in New York in 1873, the facts are\nclearer, and the biographer's principal task is to arrive at a fair\nestimate of her complex psychology.\nMr Bechhofer Roberts may be congratulated on the way in which\nhe has discharged both parts of his task. The reader's interest is\nwell sustained throughout the book. The narrative of H.P.B.'s\nearlier life is as lucid as her mystifications permit it to be, and the\n\fJuly 1931 Reviews 121\nestimate of her motives and character in the concluding chapter\nshows an evident desire to be fair, and may with some qualifications\nbe accepted.\nIt would have been better if Mr Bechhofer Roberts had more\noften given us chapter and verse for the conflicting statements as to\nH.P.B.'s life before the foundation of the Theosophical Society ;\nand in dealing with H.P.B.'s relations with the S.P.R. he is guilty of\na few inaccuracies. F. W. H. Myers was never \" Professor,\" and\nwe should like to know Mr Bechhofer Robert's authority for the\nstatement that he was at any time a theosophist.\nIn his concluding chapter the author pays a just tribute to H.P.B.'s\ncourage and resource in the face of long continued poverty and\nillness. He is probably right in acquitting her of mercenary motives\nand of being an agent of the Russian Government ;\nopportunity for\nthis was lacking, if not inclination. On the question of her sincerity\nhe is perhaps too charitable. She very possibly believed in the value\nof the doctrine she borrowed without acknowledgment from any\nhandy source. But that she had any faith in the marvels by which\nshe sought to gain acceptance for those doctrines, we find it hard to\nbelieve. Mr Bechhofer Roberts says that \" many mediums who\nshow themselves wholly upright in their ordinary life, resort to\ntrickery to maintain their psychic prestige.\" We think this over-\nstates the case ;\n\" trance-deception \" and \" subconscious fraud\n\"\nare usually mere polite periphrases. Even, however, if we allow\nthat they are sometimes more than this, there is no parallel between\noccasional acts of simulation done in trance or some similar state,\nand persistent trickery, involving careful preparation and collusion\nwith other persons, carried out for many years while H.P.B. was in,\nfor her at least, a \" normal \" mental state. W. H. Salter.\nAlfred Adler, The Pattern of Life. Edited by W. Beran Wolfe.\n8vo, pp. 271. London : Kegan Paul, 1931. Price 8s. 6d. net.\nThe aim of this book is to give a summary of Professor Adler's\n\" individual psychology,\" and to give students an opportunity of\nreading some case histories of difficult and problem children and of\nstudying Dr Adler's therapeutic method.\nA clear and sympathetic introduction by the editor will enable\nthose who are unfamiliar with Dr Adler's psychological theory to\nrealise its main outlines ; and if the compression which was necessary\nin order to present a whole philosophy of human nature in iO pages\nhas led to an effect of over-generalization, it will still prove a stimu-\nlating introduction to Dr Adler's fruitful and illuminating science\nof human motives. The case histories which follow and which illus-\ntrate the theories that have been expounded in the Introduction,\nhave been taken from the records of cases of problem children who\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1031\nwere brought to Dr Adler by physicians and teachers in New York\nand treated by Dr Adler during his visit to the New School of Social\nResearch. Representative cases have been chosen by Dr Beran\nWolfe to illustrate the \" patterns of life \" (that is, the methods of\nbehaviour) unconsciously adopted by the children. These are of\ngreat interest. Many readers of works on individual psychology\nmust have felt the need of further information on the practical\napplication of the theory ; till now it has been difficult to have access\nto such material as it has been confined to the German publications\nof Adler and his pupils. Readers therefore will be grateful to the\neditor for having realised this need and for having met it in a clear\nand attractive form.\nApart from its intrinsic interest the book is closely relevant to\npsychic research. Much possible light might be thrown on the\notherwise puzzling motives behind dishonest mediumistic activities,\nif we compared them with the activities of neurotic children and with\ntheir mistaken methods of gaining attention and significance. Cases\nof so-called \" poltergeists \" would I feel sure resolve themselves very\nsimply on analysis to a \" pattern of life \" (i.e method of behaviour)\nadopted by a child at odds with his environment and anxious in some\nway to dominate or intimidate its personnel. No case of polter-\ngeist is given in the present collection, but cases are mentioned of\nchildren with a mania for throwing things about so that they should\nin some way be the centre of disturbance and attention (p. 97). It\nis a very short step from openly throwing an object for an ingenious\nchild to throw more unexpectedly and cleverly, and to impose on\nsuperstitious parents and friends the idea that he is in league with\nsome spirit and not responsible. In this way he gains both prestige\nand immunity for his misdeeds, and there can be little doubt after\nstudying these histories that these two motives are always the leading\nones in neurotic solutions of the problems of life. The case (p. 74)\nof the boy with an invisible playmate, in connection with whom he\ntakes on a different voice and manner, is also interesting from the\npoint of view of psychical research.\nThe book can be warmly recommended to anyone interested in\neither psychology or psychical research. It is a pity that for the sake\nof brevity the editor omitted the exact form of the \"protocol \" or\npreliminary presentation of the cases, but it can be fairly closely\nsurmised, and if a similar form could be adopted in all investigations\ninto poltergeist and other so called physical phenomena it might bring\nsome orderliness into a research which has so far made too little use of\nthe light given to us by orthodox psychology.

Dr Schmitz also criticises the Conference on the ground that\nno actual demonstrations of phenomena were given : as if, he com-\nplains, there were to be a conference of musicians without music.\nHe strongly urges that this omission should be remedied at the\nLondon Congress of 1932. It may be suspected that Dr Schmitz does\nnot fully appreciate the difficulties involved in his proposal.\nPsychic Research, November 1930.\nEarly in 1930 the American S.P.R. issued a questionnaire to its\nmembers for the purpose of ascertaining their standing, beliefs, etc.\nDr Geo. H. Hyslop (who has since withdrawn from the American\nSociety's Board of Trustees) here reports on the 410 replies. Some\nof these replies are very interesting, as throwing some Ught on the\ngreat change that has taken place during recent years in the American\nSociety's attitude and publications.\nOne of the questions asked related to members' views on \" the\noccurrence of the phenomena studied by the Society.\" Of 440\npersons whose replies are tabulated, 250 come under the heading of\n\" Believer \" and 168 are \" Favourably disposed,\" a total of 418.\nNot a single member accepted the designation of \" Disbeliever\n\"\nand only 13 admitted themselves \" Sceptical.\" It will be noticed\nthat all supernormal phenomena are lumped together ; it must\ntherefore be assumed that a \" believer \" believes in all such pheno-\nmena, physical as well as mental.\nThe members were also asked whether they \" accept the spirit-\nistic hypothesis as an explanation of any of the phenomena.\" No\nless than 301 of those who replied do so accept it. The use of the\nword \" any \" is a little ambiguous in this question ;\npresumably it\nis understood to mean \" any one.\"\nIt is interesting to note that of those members of the American\nS.P.R. who replied 65 per cent, have had \" personal psychic experi-\nence \" ; 80 per cent, have sat with mediums ; 75 members have had\nmore than 300 sittings ; some have had a total running into thou-\nsands of sittings.\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1931\nPsychological Bulletin, May 1931.\nMr Paul Campbell Young, of Louisiana State University, reviews\n135 books and articles on hypnotism and suggestion. It appears-\nfrom his survey that there is still great need for investigation in this\nfield, and that the use of hypnotism is still suffering from its post-\npsychoanalytical decline. Under the elegant heading, \" Occult\nHold-Overs,\" Mr Young deplores the fact that in spite \" of time and\nderision the old notions that hypnosis brings with it mysterious\npowers, such as clairvoyance, telepathy, and other manifestations\nlinked up with the theory of animal magnetism, still persists.\nAmong these manifestations the writer, for no apparent reason,,\ncites the discussion of the fire-walk in our Journal for June 1928.\nMr Young also refers to the refutation of Alrutz's views about the\ndirect influence of mesmeric passes, but only mentions a brief\npreliminary report and not the full one published in volume xxxvi of\nProceedings. It appears that an independent investigation in\nRussia by D. Polinkovsky also procured only negative results. On\nthe other hand, there appears at the same time as Mr Young's\nsurvey a paper entitled \" Biological Sources of Radioactivity \" in\nthe Archives of Physical Therapy (May 1931), xii. 272-8, by Dr R.

S. Thomas, a Member of the\nSociety, who reported it to us on 21 September 1930, as follows :\n\" 1. My cousin, Mr L. T. Parry Jones, headmaster of a school near\nBirmingham, was taken ill on the evening of July 29th at the end\nof the summer term (1930) after dismissing his servants preparatory\nto going away. His sister Beatrice who kept house for him was\nstill with him. He went to a neighbouring nursing home. On\nAugust 6th he became delirious, developing a complaint which left\nlittle hope of recovery. He died on the night of Thursday, August\n8th, without regaining consciousness. Mr F. B. Thornton, an\nintimate friend and father of a pupil, had been to see him and knew\nof the seriousness of his condition. He and L.P.J, had often in light\nconversation talked of '\nCrossing the Styx.' On the night of my\ncousin's death he dreamt that he saw him crossing the Styx with\ntall trees like totem poles on the opposite bank. He was dressed in\nhis ordinary clothes, and as he stepped ashore he turned and waved,\ncalling '\nI'm over.'\n\" Later the same night he had a vivid dream-vision of L.P.J,\nstanding in the doorway with his mother. Mr Thornton had never\nseen my aunt, nor a photograph of her. There was no photograph\nof her in the living-rooms of the schoolhouse. He described her to\nme as shorter than her son and with greying sandy hair. Both\nitems are correct, but the second is of more interest, 1\nas L.P.J, was\na tall man. The next morning Mr Thornton told his wife of his\nexperiences before hearing of L.P.J. 's death. Mr Thornton had\nmany mediumistic experiences physical and visionary before his\n1\n[In reply to a question as to whether Mr Thornton could have any normal\nreason for thinking Mrs Parry Jones's hair was likely to be sandy, Mr Thomas\nwrites on 2 October 1930 :\n\" I don't think Mr Thornton had any reason to\nthink my aunt had reddish hair. He met three of her daughters who kept\nhouse at different times for P.J. The eldest certainly has dark auburn hair,\nbut the second's hair is dark brown and the third's black. P.J.'s hair was\nlight brown.\"]\n\fOctober 1931 Two Incidents 127\nmarriage, since which he has deliberately discouraged such pheno-\nmena on the grounds of health. My aunt died in 1924 at the age of 75.\"\nTo this statement was appended the following corroboration :\n\" The above facts are correct as far as they concern me.\"\n[Signed] Frank B. Thornton.\nBeatrice L. Thornton.\nAugust 26th 1930.\"\nMr Thomas then continues :\n\" I heard of Mr Thornton's experiences when I was at Tenby\nfrom L.P.J. 's sister Laura. He and his family had arranged to go\nthere with L.P.J. , and I met them and obtained the above signa-\ntures from him and his wife personally. He consented to try and\nrecognise my aunt, whose appearance was quite unknown to him,\nfrom photographs. A number of old family albums were available\nat Tenby. From these I selected 15 photographs of contemporaries,\nmostly relatives and acquaintances, of my aunt at various ages.\nAmong them were two of her. She was of stoutish habit, but\nbecame very thin in body and face before her final illness. One of\nthe photographs was taken shortly before this change.\n\" I took the photographs in an envelope to Mr Thornton on the\nbeach and sat about two feet from him. I asked him to go through\nthem and see if any of them resembled her. I did not say that a\nphotograph of her was among them. I said there was a certain\nfamily likeness common to the five sisters at all ages, and that was\nwhy some of the photographs were of young women. I took care\nnot to see the faces of the photographs when he handled them. It\nwas drizzling and he began by going through them without remov-\ning them from the envelope. Before examining them all he handed\nme one. I took it and asked him to take them out and go right\nthrough them. He took them out. I turned away, and he very\nquickly gave me a second. The first was of an elderly woman, who\nI could, see bore a certain likeness to my aunt. My cousin tells me\nshe is very like her in life. Mr Thornton did not think it was a\nphotograph of my aunt, because the original was shingled and my\naunt was not. This he told me afterwards. The second was of a\nvery hollow-eyed person in whom I saw no likeness, but my cousin\nsaw a likeness in the eyes (when I last saw her she was thinner, but\nnot hollow-eyed). I again asked Mr Thornton to go through the\ncards before making his decision. After a much longer interval,\nduring which I turned away from him as before, he remarked,\n'\nThat's the one,' and handed me the last photograph (f face) taken\nof my aunt. As he did so he withdrew the second photograph from\nmy knee. When I asked him the reason later, he did not remember\ndoing so.\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1931\n\"It is regrettable that he should have proceeded to make his\ndecision before going through the photographs.\n\" After this he gave me details of his vision : that he saw my\naunt in profile and with a hand on her son's arm. He also told me\nfor the first time that she had a shawl on. This only struck me\nafter leaving Tenby. Enquiries from L.J. [daughter] elicited the\nfact that latterly she nearly always wore something over her\nshoulders, as she had spasms of chill and would use anything handy\nfor a shawl. Apparently Mr Thornton told his wife it wasn't exactly\na shawl but a covering of some sort. 1\n\" 2. On August 22nd, 1930, my cousin Laura shewed me a copy\nshe had just made of a letter before returning it which Clementine\nX, an Irish maid (R.C.) on the school staff had written to her sister\nBeatrice from Glasgow. She had left at the end of term before\nL.P.J, fell ill. In this letter (undated) she says :\n\" '\nI am writing to see if there is anything the matter at the\nschool. ... I can't resist it, somehow. Every night as soon as ever\nI fall asleep I dream about Mr Parry Jones. He seems to be with\nme and he seems all changed, not like himself at all. So I wake up\nstartled, they have to call to me. ... As I should not like to think\nhe would have an accident or anything while he is away on holiday,\nI am dreaming every night about the school I wrote to you. ... I\nhope you won't think I'm mad writing you such rubbish, somehow\nI could not help [keep ?] it. If you have a spare moment, please\nwrite to me. Remember me to the Master.'\n\" This letter was probably written about August 18th. My\ncousin L. wrote to Clementine at once, and at my request asked her\nfor details as to when these dreams began, and whether she had felt\nanxious, etc. In her reply she apologised profusely for any pain\nher letter may have caused them (B. and L., his sisters), explaining\nher experience away as being of frequent occurrence and of no\nsignificance. She made no attempt to answer the questions. I\nlearn from my cousins that Clementine had told one of her col-\nleagues on the staff that she often had veridical dreams connected\nwith deaths. They both regarded her as psychic. It seems likely\nthat Clementine as a Roman Catholic obtained clerical advice before\nshe replied. She wrote later in similar strain to B. She had left\nthe school to be married, and felt it very much on parting. I learn\nthat although L.P.J, looked pale his friends attributed it to the\nstress of the term's work and had no anxiety about his health.\n[Signed] Ernest S. Thomas.\"\n1\n[These statements were contained in a letter from Miss L. Jones dated\n16 September 1930. She writes :\n\" Mrs T. told me it wasn't exactly a shawl\nher husban-l saw but a covering of some sort.\"]\n\fOctober 1931 Two Incidents 129\nSubsequently Mr Thomas wrote again on 18 October 1930, as\nfollows :\n\" LI. Parry Jones Case. I send you some further details re above.\nAnother sister of P.J., who had kept house for him, wrote to the\nmaid Clementine when she heard of her letter to my cousin B.J.,\nand asked her (quite independently) if she could give her the dates\nof her dreams.\n\" She received an answer (copy enclosed and undated) about\nSept. 21. C. had apparently regained her original feelings regarding\nher experience.\n\" This cousin (Mrs Alkin) gives me the interesting information\nthat P.J. suffered from very bad (' terrible ') dreams before the\ncoma supervened and meningitis declared itself. As she suggests,\nthis may have influenced the tone of Clementine's vision : P.J.'s\ndistress of mind perhaps still pervading his subconsciousness at first\n(when he '\nimpressed '\nClementine). She also confirms (without my\nquestioning) the statement I made that Clementine had a reputation\nfor '\ndreaming true '\n; she '\nwould often foretell the type of letter\nshe would [find] when she came down in the morning [from dreams\novernight].' She would '\nknow if there was anything wrong with\nany member of her family before she heard '\n[authority of a colleague\nmaid].\n\" In the letter enclosed she seems to distinguish between dreams\nshe still has of P.J. (of which she takes no notice) and the particular\nexperience when she woke shouting to which she refers in this\nletter. She seems a very emotional type and not a good witness for\ndetail. [Signed] Ernest S. Thomas.\"\nThe copy of Clementine's letter to Mrs Alkin is as follows :\n\" I hope you will forgive me for not writing sooner, but I was\nreally so busy. . . .\n\" I am wondering how the school will go on this term without the\ndear master. . . . Well it's very funny how I should dream of him\nthat time. I can't remember what date exactly, but my dear\nmaster must have passed away at the time. I don't care what any\none says to try and convince me. He must have been near me, for\nI woke up shouting to my sister, and she asked me what was wrong.\nI'd been dreaming that he was in some trouble and he was asking\nme to help him. But oh his dear face I will never forget it, it seemed\nsmall and drawn somehow, and he was so changed. I dream now\nabout him sometimes, but of course I don't take any notice of\ndreams. . . . [Signed] Clementine.\"\nThe evidence in the first of these two experiences is, as Mr Thomas\nhimself points out, weakened by the circumstances in which the\nphotograph was identified. Nevertheless, it seemed worth while to\nput the incident on record because, taken in conjunction with the\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1931\nexperience of the maid Clementine, it rather suggests that Mr Parry\nJones may have been one of the people who have at some crisis of\ntheir lives an exceptional faculty of impressing themselves upon\nothers in a supernormal way. A striking example of this type of\ncase is quoted by Mrs Sidgwick in her report on phantasms of the\nliving, Proceedings, xxxiii. 167 ff.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nMETHODS IN EXPERIMENTAL TELEPATHY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I have read with great interest Dr Gardner Murphy's\nreview (in Proceedings, xl. 99-104) of the Transactions of the Fourth\nInternational Congress for Psychical Research, and I heartily endorse\nhis plea for a higher standard in the quality of the reports issued by\npsychical researchers. I cannot think, however, that Dr Murphy\nhas been quite happy in his illustrations of what he apparently\nconsiders to be sound scientific procedure. I refer especially to the\nexperiments of M. Rene Warcollier in the domain of telepathy.\nLet me say at once that M. Warcollier is one of my valued friends\nand if I am inspired to put on the gloves for a friendly bout with\nhim I hope he will not take it amiss. Moreover, when the report of\nmy own investigations appears, I shall welcome his criticisms in the\nsame amicable spirit. Not the least of the bonds between M.\nWarcollier and myself has been our common interest in the subject\nof experimental telepathy. Our methods of approach, however, are\nso fundamentally different that I believe their relative merits and\ndefects would provide a fruitful subject for a discussion to which\nI am hoping both Dr Murphy and M. Warcollier will be induced to\ncontribute.\nI will begin, therefore, by describing just what impression the\nwork of M. Warcollier makes upon me who am neither a psycho-\nlogist nor an experimental physicist but a mathematician. I\nrecognise that M. Warcollier is extremely ingenious and fertile in\ndevising experiments, and that he has a lively gift of exposition,\nwhich makes all that he writes of exceptional interest and peculiar\ncharm. This power of facile experimentation he shares with the\nlate Dr Crawford, and, though the two workers belong to widely\ndifferent fields, their basic methods are not altogether dissimilar.\nI remember some years ago lending Crawford's Experiments in\nPsychical Science to a young physicist of considerable distinction,\nwho had, however, no knowledge of psychical research. He read\nthe book carefully, and handed it back to me with remarks to the\n\fOctober 1931 Corresponden ce 131\neffect that lie thought Crawford's experiments quite ingenious and\nadmirably arranged to demonstrate the mechanics of psychic\nlevitation. And no doubt considered purely as experiments in\napplied mechanics, Crawford's experiments were excellent, but\nunderlying all his work was a large fundamental assumption which\nCrawford never adequately verified, and which grew more and more\ntacit as time went on. This tacit assumption, of course, was the\nassumption that the levitating agency was a supernormal force and\nnot a human leg. At the beginning Crawford may well have had\nhis doubts, but under the imperious hypnotism of his own theories,\nthese doubts soon faded into the background of his mind. But I\ncan quite imagine that to a physicist who had somehow become a\nconvert to the possibility of psychic levitation, Crawford's methods\nwould appear far more promising and hopeful than say those of\nDr Prince or Mr Besterman, whose entire energies would be devoted\nto verifying the actual existence of the phenomenon.\nNow it appears to me that underlying all M. Warcollier's work is\nthe tacit assumption that the mental coincidences he observes are\nthe result of some special causal nexus of a supernormal character\nbetween two minds, and not the effect of that vast but indeterminate\nconcatenation of normal events which, in our ignorance, we call\nchance.\nWe must note, in the first place, that the material with which M.\nWarcollier has obtained most success consists of a series of sketches\nmade up of more or less complicated arrangements of curved and\nstraight lines, frequently intended to suggest concrete objects. In\nthe great majority of examples cited by him, success is claimed on\nthe ground that pairs of drawings executed in different places at\nmore or less the same time exhibit certain resemblances in shape.\nAs a rule it appears to be the form rather than the idea that is the\nbasis of coincidence. This resemblance is seldom exact but most\noften of a sketchy or fragmentary kind. Frequently there is nothing\nmore than the embryonic suggestion of a similarity. This frag-\nmentary nature of the resemblances M. Warcollier explains by\npostulating that there is selection and analysis of the drawing to be\ntransmitted by the subconscious minds of the agent and percipient.\nBut if one goes on making vast numbers of experiments as M.\nWarcollier has done, extending over a period of years, it is certain\nthat chance will produce coincidences of varying degrees of com-\nplexity, and a judicious selection from the more successful results\nwould provide material for the illustration of any number of psycho-\nlogical theories. What, I wonder, would happen if all the drawings\never made by M. Warcollier's agents and percipients in France,\nGreece, England and America were copied on to similar slips of\ncardboard, and these slips were thoroughly mixed in a large bag,\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1931\nand then a number of pairs or trios were drawn out at random ?\nI think it probable that I, as a sceptic, might find myself furnished\nwith enough material with which to illustrate the whole of M.\nWarcollier's theories of mental contagion, fragmentation of the\nimage, influence of the imagination, etc., etc.\nIt is possible that the probability of occurrence of fragmentary\nresemblances between pairs of drawings is greater than M. War-\ncollier imagines, especially when the sketches are at all involved.\nMoreover, there is a further complication. So far as I am able to\ngather from the somewhat scanty and inadequate records of the\nindividual experiments, the agents are chiefly guided in their\nselection of the material of transmission by personal preference.\nThat is to say, one or other of the group chooses an object or design\nwhich has impressed him at about the time of the experiments, or\nwhich he selects as suitable for testing some psychological theory.\nWell, in a civilised community we are all subject to common in-\nfluences. We read the same newspapers, listen to the same pro-\ngrammes on the radio, gaze at the same advertisements on the\nMetro., etc. Two persons, therefore, may produce drawings with\nfeatures of resemblance merely because a day or two previously\nthey had both been impressed by the same hoarding in a public\nplace. When the evening of the experiments arrives the two persons\nmay have forgotten what they had seen, but the impression made\nupon their minds may still be sufficiently active to stimulate similar\ntrains of thought, and in the sketches which they produce they will\nnot recognize the true source of their inspiration. Thus we may\narrive at a normal explanation of the coincidences which have led\nM. Warcollier to his theory of \" mental contagion.\"\nFurther, when the members of a small group of persons who\nexperiment together for months and years are constantly comparing\ntheir drawings and impressions, they will tend to become tolerably\nfamiliar with each other's mental preferences and idiosyncrasies.\nHence the members of such a group will produce sketches which\nshow a greater and greater degree of similarity. The believer in\ntelepathy will interpret this as the slow growth of \" l'accord tele-\npathique.\"\nAgain, there may be in the group pairs of persons with a similar\nartistic make-up in their mentalities. Such pairs may produce more\nthan the average number of coincidences and this will give rise\nto the belief in \"couples telepathiques.\"\nThe remedy, of course, for these latter complications would be\nthe selection by hazard of the sketches to be transmitted from a\nvery large number compiled by a great variety of types of mind,\nbut it does not seem clear that M. Warcollier has taken this pre-\ncaution in arranging his experiments.\n\fOctober 1931 Correspondence 133\nVery significant and disconcerting is the fact that M. Warcollier's\ngroups do not succeed in experiments with numbers, playing cards,\netc., where the chances are definite and easily estimated. Psycho-\nlogical reasons based upon the interference of mental habit and\nindividual preference may, of course, be invoked to account for\nthis, but it is surely very strange that in the early days of the\nS.P.R. apparently most successful results were obtained with\nplaying cards and numbers.\nBut a much more potent reason suggests itself to account for M.\nWarcollier's failure with numbers, capital letters, etc. It is that\nsuch material is perfectly clear cut, and does not permit of the\nexperimenters claiming equivocal successes on the score that an\nassociated idea has emerged in the mind of the percipient. If the\nagent thinks of letter A and the percipient sees an S, it is not at all\neasy to convince the reader that any telepathy has taken place.\nIf, however, the American group thinks of a cobra and M. War-\ncollier has the impression of, say, exotic birds and climbing plants,\nhow easy to explain this by saying that exotic birds were associated\nin the mind of the agent with the idea of a cobra.1\nThe truth is, of\ncourse, that every human mind is a perfect network of associations,\nand it is possible by using a very little ingenuity to find occasion\nfor linking together even the most incongruous ideas. What\napparent connection, for instance, is there between mathematics\nand a tiger 1 But I can easily find one in my own mind. A tiger\nsuggests to me Blake's poem, and the lines which I most readily\nrecall are these :\n\" What immortal hand or eye\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry ?\n\"\nAnd the words \" symmetry \" and symmetrical are constantly being\nused by mathematicians.\nWhen, therefore, M. Warcollier tells us that in place of the actual\nimage transmitted by the agent an associated idea may emerge in\nthe consciousness of the percipient, unless that association is as\nobvious as \" sea \" and \" ship,\" or\n'''\nIndian \" and \" wigwam,\" I\nshall remain frankly sceptical.\nBut my main criticism must be that M. Warcollier has provided\nus with no scientific criteria by which to judge whether the coinci-\ndences he observes are due to telepathy or not. He does, indeed,\nsometimes in a casual way refer to percentages of successes, but he\nfurnishes us with no control series with which to compare the results\nof his experiments considered in the mass. It is certain that he\nmust have had large numbers of failures. This I can definitely\nvouctrfor by the records of his two years' work with my own group.\n1\nR. Warcollier, La Telepathie a tres grande distance, p. 6.\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1931\nWhat he has given us in his various reports is, for the most partT\na selection of successful cases apparently chosen for the express\npurpose of illustrating and supporting certain ingenious psycho-\nlogical theories. To a professional psychologist like Dr Gardner\nMurphy these theories doubtless appeal just as Crawford's theories\nof X-matter and F-matter interest a physicist. But to the mathe-\nmatical mind, accustomed to think in precise terms and to express\nits beliefs in the language of the calculus of probabilities, the\nmethods of my friend M. Warcollier will seem inadequate.\nOutside the ideal abstractions of pure mathematics there can be\nno absolute certitude in our findings about facts in the concrete\nworld but only varying degrees of probability, and the aim of a\ntruly scientific method must be to reach a numerical expression of\nthe degree of probability attained by our experiments. Only thus\ncan we hope to rise from the region of opinion into that of real\nknowledge.\nI have recently completed an investigation in long-distance\ntelepathy with over 600 persons and lasting over a period of two\nyears. I have experimented with many different kinds of material.\nI have examined hundreds of mental coincidences, and had I so\nchosen nothing would have been easier than for me to have \" psycho-\nlogised \" over these coincidences much after the manner of my\nfriend M. Warcollier. But the extensive series of control experi-\nments which were interpolated among the genuine attempts at\ntransmission and the subsequent evaluation of the results by the\nknown methods of statistical analysis, have shown conclusively that\nthe coincidences observed were not to be attributed to any super-\nnormal faculty, but were to be considered as the work of chance\nand common environment.\nAlthough my percipients have followed closely the passive\nmethods of reception advocated by M. Warcollier himself, and\nalthough (like certain of M. Warcollier's own group) some 353 of\nthese percipients claimed to have had interesting psychic experi-\nences at various periods of their lives, I have been totally unable to\nconfirm M. Warcollier's conclusions either as to the supposed fact\nof experimental transmission of thought from the group of agents\nto the percipients, or as to the supposed phenomena of \" mental\ncontagion \" among the percipients themselves.\nI am prepared to believe that a very few specially endowed people\nlike Mrs Leonard possess the faculty of telepathic perception, and\nthat it occasionally operates between persons who are for all ap-\nparent purposes of normal mentality, but I am not prepared to\nadmit that it is so common a human faculty that it can be experi-\nmented with like memory or intelligence or attention. One of the\nmost cogent reasons why official science has neglected these super-\n\fOctober 1931 Correspondence 135\nnormal phenomena is surely the extreme rarity with which they\nhappen. I suppose in this country there are not more than a dozen\npersons who produce phenomena that would repay any sort of\nsystematic investigation by a scientific man.\nNow I ask Dr Murphy what hope there would be of discovering\na cure for cancer if not more than, say, one person per five million\never suffered from it % And our problem is infinitely more difficult.\nThe patient with cancer can at least be observed as long as he lives\nand experimented with, but in the case of your psychic you can\nnever be sure even of getting any phenomena to examine.\nIn view of the astonishing discrepancy between my own experi-\nments and those of M. Warcollier, I earnestly hope that M. War-\ncollier may see his way in the near future to undertake such a series\nof control experiments as will either confirm or confute his funda-\nmental hypothesis of telepathy.\nYours, etc.,\nS. G. Soal.\nMODERN SCIENCE AND ;\n'\nSURVIVAL.\"\nTo the Editor o\/The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I have been wondering if anyone would draw attention, for\nits bearing on our subject, to a passage at the end of Sir James\nJeans's recent little book The Mysterious Universe. The passage\nI mean is the following :\n\" Many would hold that, from the broad philosophical stand-\npoint, the outstanding achievement of twentieth century physics is\nnot the theory of relativity with its welding together of space and\ntime, or the theory of quanta with its present apparent negation of\nthe laws of causation, or the dissection of the atom with its resultant\ndiscovery that things are not what they seem ;\nit is the general\nrecognition that we are not yet in contact with ultimate reality\n\"\n(p. 127).\nThe \" yet \" in this passage seems as if it can hardly refer to the\npossible achievements of posterity\u2014as so many scientific \" yets\n\"\nin the past have done\u2014since posterity, occupying the same environ-\nment as ourselves, will not be in contact with reality either. Sir\nJames Jeans had just previously said that our universe or space-\ntime continuum was beginning to look like a sort of shadow in four\ndimensions of something in more.\nSince this obviously leaves open the door to possible contact with\nreality in some circumstances, many may regard it as offering\ndefinite support of the survival hypothesis. To me it seems rather\nto raise a question whether \" survival \" may be quite the right\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1931\nword, to suggest that we may, in fact, be living in a higher degree\nof reality, in more dimensions than four, though, in our immediate\nshade of consciousness, we are not aware of it\u2014any more than in\nthe dream shade we are aware of the waking shade. It is perhaps\nhardly possible to avoid the speculation that death, like waking,\nmay make us aware, may enable us to perceive this as the shadow\nof that.\nBe that as it may, it is at least manifest that twentieth century\nscience has moved a long way from the old materialism, which used\nto be rather a stumbling-block in the way of our investigations.\nYours, etc.,\nHubert Wales.\nPHANTASMS OF THE BLIND.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014I should be glad to know if any of our Members have come\nacross credible evidence of the phantasm of a blind man, either in\nhis lifetime or after.\nThe question seems to me to be important as the theory that a\nman's wraith or ghost is a telepathic projection of what he thinks\nor thought his visual aspect to be is a plausible one and has some\nconfirmation in experiments with hypnotized patients, but this\nexplanation would hardly hold in the case of a man blind from his\nbirth.\nThe test case would be that of a man blinded in youth, who\ncould have no visual knowledge of the changes time had made in\nhis appearance. Would his projected phantasm be still that of a\nyoung man ?\nI take it that most of us would welcome any evidence that the\noccasionally distressing aspect of phantasms of the dead had no\nreal counterpart in a future existence.\nYours, etc.,\nLewis C. Powles.\nMISS CUMMINS'S AUTOMATIC WRITING.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014In his recently published book, The Messiah Jesus, Dr\nEisler brings to light a \" censored \" passage concerning the physical\nappearance of Jesus. Dr Eisler claims to have recovered these\ndetails from a repressed text in the \" Slavonic \" Josephus. So far\nas I know, the only translation from German into English of the\npassage referred to (before the publication of the work in England),\nappeared in The Quest for October 1929.\n\fOctober 1931 Correspondence 137\nIt may interest your readers to know that a similar description\nwas written automatically by Miss Cummins in November 1926.\nThis description appears on pages 72 and 73 of Paul in Athens,\npublished last year. The translation of 1929 and the automatic\nscript of 1926 run as follows :\n\" He was a man of plain appearance, ripe age, with dark com-\nplexion, small stature, three ells high, bent back, long face, longish\nnose, eyebrows grown together so that those who looked at him\ncould be dismayed, scanty hair, with a parting in the middle after\nthe style of the Nazirs, and immature beard \" (The Quest).\n\" There was no marvel in the glance of his eye, no wonder in the\nshaping of his countenance. He was crooked of body, ill-pleasing\nto behold, with long woman's hair divided in the middle of the\ncrown. His neck drooped and his nose was like the beak of a bird.\nHe resembled many score of lowly men whom you will encounter\nin the market place and in the streets of your town. ...\" (Paul in\nAthens).\nComing as they do from entirely different sources, it must be\nadmitted that there is a curious resemblance between these two\naccounts.\nThe question now arises, how did the mind of the automatist\npick up this entirely unexpected picture of a hitherto uniquely\nidealised and beautiful Figure ? Miss Cummins knows no Russian,\nGreek, or Hebrew. Her German is limited to a knowledge of the\nmeaning of a few words in that language. Until last June she had\nnever set foot in Germany. Moreover, she has never studied\nChristian origins nor is she in the least interested in Church history.\nHer normal mind is entirely concerned with literature of a modern\ncharacter, more especially the drama. Only Mrs Champion de\nCrespigny and myself were present at the time of this writing. Mrs\nde Crespigny assures me that she had never seen anywhere in print,\nnor had she ever conceived in her mind, such a description of Jesus\nas was written on that occasion. For myself, I can only affirm that\nmy knowledge of historical facts pertaining to early Christian\nhistory is absolutely nil.\nIt would seem, therefore, that the only explanation possible (if\nwe exclude the cryptesthetic faculty and the spiritistic hypothesis),\nwould be that of telepathy from some outside source. In which\ncase Miss Cummins would have to be in telepathic communication\nwith Mr G. R. S. Mead, who had apparently studied the German\ntext of The Messiah Jesus, with Dr Eisler himself, or with some other\nscholar cognisant of these details. I myself have had some startling\nevidence of the astonishing accuracy with which, at times, my\nthoughts have been picked up by other people, though never as the\nresult of deliberate experiment.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1931\nBut if we admit this theory as the explanation, it must also be\nasked, why was other information not as accurately derived from\nthe same source and committed to paper on the same occasion ?\nNotably when (page 76) Miss Cummins wrote an interesting variant\nof Dr Eisler's theory that Jesus was impersonated at the resur-\nrection by a twin brother 1 In this instance, \" Menehas \" states\nhis belief that Jesus was impersonated by his disciple John, who\nresembled him.\nThere are other points of agreement and disagreement between\nthese two chapters (16 and 17) of Paul in Athens and The Messiah\nJesus, but space does not permit me to deal with them here. Neither\nis it possible to discuss the interesting anti-Christian views as expressed\nin the interpretation of the \" Slavonic \" Josephus, which would\nseem to coincide with those of \" Menehas,\" nor the claim made by\nthe pro-Christian Paul that these were fabrications. However, in\nconclusion. I would like to point out that an entirely different\ndescription of Jesus to the one given by \" Menehas \" appears on\npage 90 of The Scripts of Cleophas. This view is the pro-Christian\none. Also other allusions of the same character are made on pages\n75, 128, 129, and 130 of Paul in Athens. It seems, therefore, that\nMiss Cummins's mind is capable of reproducing two entirely\ncontrary views and is not obstructed by any personal inhibitions in\nthis respect. Yours, etc.,\nE. B. GlBBES.\n[It must be pointed out that the significance attributed by Miss\nGibbes to the interesting parallels she quotes are to a certain extent\nbased on a misapprehension. Dr Eisler does not claim to have\nproduced for the first time the supposed statement of Josephus\nabout the physical appearance of Jesus. Nor does this statement\nstand alone. Dr Eisler himself gives a number of references to other\nsources (The Messiah Jesus [1931]. pp. 393 ff.), and even in so\npopular a book as Jacob de Voragine's The Golden Legend there\nappears a modified form of it. Ed.]\nTHE MYSTERIOUS MADAME.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Mr Salter, in an otherwise favourable review of my recent\nbiography of Madame Blavatsky, suggests that I am \" guilty of a\nfew inaccuracies \" in dealing with her relations with the S.P.R.\nThe alleged \" few inaccuracies,\" however, appear to number only\ntwo.\nMr Salter's first complaint is that I suppose F. W. H. Myers to\nhave been at one time a theosophist. Well, Madame Blavatsky in\n\fOctober 1931 Correspondence 139\nher published letters to Sinnett (no. 61) refers to Myers as a theo-\nsophist ; and no less omniscient a personage than the Mahatma\nK.H. confirms this in his letters to Sinnett (no. 83). Olcott refers\nto Myers's resignation from the Theosophical Society in Old Diary\nLeaves (3rd series, p. 235). These three (or two) individuals were in\na position to know ;\nand, what is to the point in weighing their\nevidence, they had less to gain than to lose by mentioning that\nMyers had been a theosophist.\nThe second \" inaccuracy \" seems hardly worth inclusion in a\nserious review. It is that, like many other writers, I called Myers\na Professor. I plead guilty to this heinous offence ;\nMyers was\ntechnically a \" Lecturer \" at Cambridge and not a \" Professor.\"\nYours, etc.,\nC. E. Bechhofer Egberts.\nREVIEWS.\nAn Adventure.

Price 7s. 6d. net.\nThe original edition of this book, published in January 1911, was\nreviewed at some length in the Society's Proceedings (xxv. 353-60).\nThe only matter which seems to call for further comment now is a\nstatement which appears in Miss Olivier's preface, pp. 23-4, as\nfollows :\n\" An Adventure was adversely reviewed in the Journal of\nProceedings [sic] of the Society for Psychical Research, for June 1911.\n... It is, however, shown conclusively by the Bodleian papers that\nthe evidence had not actually been '\nexamined '\nat all ; and that\nthe writer of the review had not seen any of these original and con-\ntemporary records of the research. . . . The papers in the Bodleian\ndecisively prove that these documents were offered to the S.P.R.,\nand were not accepted by them. ...\"\nIt is first to be noted that strictly contemporary written records of\nthe experience with which An Adventure is concerned do not seem\nto have ever existed. It appears from the concluding paragraphs\nof \" Miss Moberly's account of the first visit to the Petit Trianon\n\"\n(p. 46) that it was in November 1901 that she and Miss Jourdain\n\" resolved to write down independent accounts \" of their expedition,\nwhich had taken place in the previous August.\nNow as to the part played by this Society. (1) The case was first\nbrought to our notice within a year or so of its occurrence and\ncertain \" original documents \" were offered for our consideration.\nThe opinion we then formed, from which we see no reason to depart,\nwas that the evidence for the hallucinatory character of the experi-\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1 931\nence was insufficient and that the case might be explained on the\nhypothesis that the percipients had subsequently ascribed a psy-\nchical significance to various actually existing persons and objects\nseen by them at Versailles.\n(2) Shortly after the first publication of An Adventure and before\nthe publication of our review, the authors submitted to the Society\na MS. book of notes written from time to time in the course of their\nown investigations into the case. It was apparent from these notes\nthat the records printed at the beginning of the first edition and\nreprinted in the present edition (pp. 39-51), were not the earliest\nrecords, in which many of the incidents upon which the authors\nlaid special stress as evidence of the supernormal character of their\nexperience were described very briefly and with far less detail than\nin the published version.\nThat the authors themselves attached importances to these\nearliest records at the time they were made, and then considered\nthem the most trustworthy report of their experiences, seems to be\nshown by the fact that, as described above, they sent them to the\nS.P.R. Permission was asked to include these original records\n(still, so far as we are aware, unprinted) in our review of the book ;\nwe offered to publish at the same time any statement concerning\nthese early documents the authors might care to send us. They\nrefused, however, to allow us to publish them and we were therefore\nprecluded from making any use of them in our review.\nWe put these facts on record here in order to show that the\ncritical attitude of our reviewer cannot fairly be ascribed^to a\nrefusal on the Society's part to consider such evidence as was\nbrought to its notice.\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE\nCIRCULATION.\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private\nnature of the Journal, from which no quotations should be made\nwithout the previous consent of the Council.

The first is eviden-\ntial : Is it really possible to find water, metals, etc., by dowsing ?\nEverybody who has conducted experiments with a good dowser or\nwho has studied the evidence agrees that it is.\nThe second question is : What causes the movements of the rod ?\nHere again there is general agreement. The movements of the rod\nare produced by the dowser's unconscious muscular movements. It\nfollows that the rod is merely an index and that it is the dowser\nhimself who \" perceives \" 1\nthe object sought.\nThe third question arises from the answer to the second : How\ndoes the dowser \" perceive \" the object sought ? This is the crucial\nproblem and there is no agreement on it. As there is not likely to\nbe much progress until this question is settled, in however pro-\nvisional a way, I have sought for an opportunity of discussing it in\nsome detail. The publication of an English translation of a book by\none of the leading exponents of the French school 2\nand of a book\nby two of the best-known German students of the subject,3\nseemed\nto present such an opportunity. I therefore invited the Vicomte de\nFrance and our Corresponding Member, Graf Klinckowstroem, to\nstate their own and to criticise each other's views. They kindly\nagreed, and their discussion follows. Their first articles were written\nindependently of each other. I have added to them these intro-\nductory remarks and a concluding summary and analysis.\nSince this discussion was completed I have been glad to note the\npublication of a number of the Revue Metajjsychique (Juillet-Aout\n1931) largely devoted to dowsing. The contributors are all French\ndowsers and investigators, and their articles display the usual and\nconfusing diversities of opinion, but contain much of interest and\nvalue.\n1\nThis word is used throughout in a completely non-committal sense, for\n\" becomes aware of \" or the like.\n2\nVicomte Henry de France, The Modern Dowser : a Guide to the Use of the\nDivining Rod and Pendulum.

In 1913 M. Henry Mager, colonial geographer, and M.\nArmand Vire. director of the Laboratory for Subterranean Biology\nat the Museum, took advantage of a psychical congress to bring\ntogether a few dowsers. These were submitted to various tests,\nsearches for underground water currents, hollows, hidden metals,\netc. The dowsers passed these tests brilliantly. As a result the\nphenomena of the dowsing-rod attracted the attention of a certain\nnumber of instructed and intelligent persons.\nThey observed first of all that it was not indispensable for the\ndowser to be endowed with a special \" gift \". The art of the dowser\ncan be acquired like all the other arts, with the reservation that,\nlike the other arts, that of dowsing calls for some aptitude and for a\nlittle patience and perseverance. At the same time, during the\nyears after the war, the chief dowsers published books in which they\nexplained their methods. We need mention only the works of\nM. Mager, Frere Padey. the Abbe Merrnet, the Abbe Ferran, that of\nM. Capron on the Abbe Bouly, M. Christophe, and finally my own.\nSeveral of these books have been very successful and have gone into\na number of editions. It will be seen that an important part has\nbeen played in recent development of the art of the dowser by our\ncountry priests. There has, in fact, appeared amongst them a\nnumber of dowsers of the highest merit. I have myself devoted a\nseries of articles to their work in Les Etudes. As the result of these\nbooks and articles the number of French dowsers has been constantly\nincreasing and has become great enough to justify the founding of\na now flourishing society, the Association des Amis de la Radies-\nthesie and of a Journal, the Chronique des Sourciers.\nThe pre-war dowser concerned himself only with the search for\nwater and sometimes for minerals. The dowsers of to-day have\nconsiderably extended the field of their investigations. Radiesthesia\nhas become a science capable of innumerable applications. It is no\nlonger content to indicate currents of water, but now specifies its\nmineralisation and radioactivity, it solves hitherto insoluble prob-\n1\n[The Vicomte de France's views are set out at greater length in his book\ncited above, p. 142, n. 2\n.]\ni2\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1931\nlems in geology, it helps archaeology by finding caves and founda-\ntions, agriculture by determining the best grains and by verifying\nwhether they are suitable for the soil, and finally it invades the\nfield of medicine with confidence and success, localising diseased\norgans, preserving from unnecessary operations, choosing remedies\nand diets. And we have so far only mentioned physical radiesthesia !\nOthers go further and are in process of founding a sort of psychical\nradiesthesia. They are no longer content to operate on the spot and\nmake use of plans and photographs. For them distance no longer\ncounts.\nWe are constantly learning new applications of our art and it is\nseldom that the results do not surpass our hopes. At the same time\ninvestigators are exercising their ingenuity in perfecting our instru-\nments and in replacing them by automatic apparatus. None of\nthese is as yet altogether satisfactory, but we may hope that before\nmany years have passed the problem will be solved.\nThe greatest progress made in France by the dowsing movement\nis due on the one hand to the published works and the remarkable\nresults obtained by some of the best dowsers, and on the other hand\nto the inventions connected with wireless, to which one is naturally\ninclined to assimilate the art of the dowser. It has to be remem-\nbered, in fact, that the dowsing novice can learn his art by practising\nwith the rod and the pendulum over electric currents, magnets and\nelectro-magnets, and wireless stations. With these last he can even\nregulate the length of the thread of his pendulum according to the\nwave-length of the transmission station with which he is in relation.\nThe dowsing-rod, and still more so the regulable pendulum, operates\nexactly as if syntonisations were produced analogous to those ob-\ntained with wireless apparatus. It is also known that very curious\nresults have been obtained on these lines with the Abrams apparatus,\nto which Dr J. Regnault in France has devoted important works, as\nwell as to various other phenomena which throw light on dowsing.\nThere is thus a physical radiesthesia, related to the known\nsciences and based on geology and biology, for which it supplies\nreliable and practical diagnostic apparatus, which, however, requires\nfor its successful use an adequate knowledge of the sciences. But\napart from the ordinary dowsers, among whom everybody may\naspire to be numbered, there are others whose exploits, to which we\nhave already referred, are somewhat disconcerting : these it is who\ntrace springs and the like on a plan or a map, and who diagnose\nillnesses from a photograph. In such cases explanations based on\nwireless and on telluric currents or on conductive atmospheric\ncurrents no longer seem to apply. We appear here to enter into an\nunknown region. We know that there exist persons called clair-\nvoyants, who possess the singular faculty of seeing at a distance,\n\fNovember 1031 Towards a Theory of Doivsing 145\nof penetrating the past and even the future, of diagnosing illnesses,\nof finding hidden objects, etc. All this has been studied and estab-\nlished. Successful results are often recorded, but no explanation is\nfound. Ought we to have recourse to St Thomas's \" Estimative\n\"\nor faculty of perceiving in a sensible object that which is not appre-\nhended by the senses ? It is unquestionable that this faculty exists\nin animals. St Thomas considers that it must exist to a much\ngreater degree in man, since it is directly related to the intellectual\nfaculties. He describes it as belonging to inferior or particular\nreason and declares that \" it unites in itself individual and concrete\nproperties, as superior reason unites general properties \".\nHowever this may be, it is possible to compare our intuitive\ndowsers with clairvoyants. The former sometimes do not even use\ntheir rods and pendulums for strictly divinatory purposes. I know\nsome who tell you in this way whether you are married, how many\nchildren you have, etc. They proceed rather like the clairvoyant\nwho, instead of the pendulum, uses coffee grounds or a pack of cards.\nNevertheless, these dowsers who read plans and photographs on the\nwhole obtain satisfactory results to which other clairvoyants do not\nappear to attain. We do not think that we have yet given a satis-\nfactory explanation of this phenomenon. But it should be observed\nthat the differences between the clairvoyant and the intuitive\ndowser appear to be minute. On the other hand, it is difficult to\ntrace a clear line of demarcation between the ordinary and the\nintuitive dowser. Some of the performances of the most \" ordinary\n\"\ndowsers make one incline to have recourse to the Estimative.\nNatura non facit saltus. We have here yet another illustration of\nthis celebrated adage.\nWe have written of the movements obtained by electrical currents.\nThese transformations of oscillations into gyrations for a given\nlength of wire, serving to make certain nervous modifications per-\nceptible, appear to be no more than simple effects of induction. We\nare on the borderline of automatism ; even machines imitate us\nwith more or less precision. Intelligence intervenes and directs our\nmovements. Attention and abstraction play their roles, which\nbecome more and more preponderant. By imperceptible transitions\nwe pass from the known to the unknown. It is not known how to\nbridge the gap dividing normal from supernormal phenomena. Per-\nhaps the \" magic rod \" will succeed in this task. In the meanwhile\nthose who use it, instead of philosophising, prefer to investigate and\nto pursue useful and specialised ends.\nThe era of the \" universal \" dowser appears to be at an end.\nNowadays one learns to use the rod and the pendulum as one learns\nto use the violin, the bistoury, or the brush. Some use our appara-\ntus because they are well-sinkers or hydrological engineers, others\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1931\nbecause they are mining engineers, others because they are doctors\nor veterinarians, others because they are agriculturists or gardeners.\nWhat I have put forward here is not a gratuitous assumption. The\nformal testimony is none other than my list of subscribers to the\nChronique des Sourciers and my editorial correspondence.\nThe services rendered by the rod and the pendulum are constantly\nincreasing in number and in accuracy, and one can foretell without\nany clairvoyance that before many years the use of the dowser will\nhave become a current practice. Let us hope that we shall then\nremember those modest French country priests who will have con-\ntributed to a large extent to the development of a movement so\nfecund and so useful for France and humanity.\n[Translated by Th. B ]\n\fNovember 1931 Towards a Theory of Dowsing 147\nIII\nDOWSING AS A PHYSICO-PHYSIOLOGICAL\nPHENOMENON 1\nBy Graf Carl von Klinckowstroem\nSir William Barrett came to the conclusion that the phenomenon\nof dowsing was to be regarded as purely psychical. Continental\ninvestigators, on the contrary, consider that the dowser reacts to a\nphysical stimulus. The old miners spoke of mountain atmospherics,\nmetallic exhalations, etc. ; the Cartesians sought for the explanation\nin the emanation of minute particles (the corpuscular theory) ;\nPierre Thouvenel developed in 1780 an electrical hypothesis, and\nthis mutatis mutandis is still advocated by many to-day. On the\ndiscovery of the complex of radio-active phenomena these also were\nnaturally drawn upon, and to-day the judicious defender of a\nphysico-physiological interpretation speaks of radiation in general,\nwithout committing himself as to its precise nature. During the\nlast decade geophysical investigations have developed a series of\ndiscoveries which in various ways throw light on the formation of\nthe earth's crust. One of these achievements, the measurement of\nthe radio-activity of the surface of the earth, has, according to\nBiehard Ambronn, a bearing on the phenomenon of dowsing. Am-\nbronn was able to establish that there were sudden changes in the\ndegree of radio-activity at places where lodes come to light and at\nmany other exceptional geological spots. Thus, where faults\nappeared there was always an increase in radio-activity, and a great\ndecrease over iron lodes. Now according to Ambronn the dowsing-\nrod gives indications in precisely the same places as the registering\napparatus shows variations in the degree of radio-activity, so that\na connection appears to him to be established between geological\npeculiarities (zones of disturbance), the indications of the dowsing-\nrod, and the characteristic variations in radio-activity.\nWith this faculty of the dowser there is perhaps to be connected\nwhat may be called weather-sensibility, the fact that certain people\nare very sensitive to changes in the weather, storms, etc. Willy\nHellpach considers this weather-sensibility to be directly paralleled\nby the sensibility of the dowser. There may in this connection be\ntaken into account, with E. Bandl, the possible connection between\n1\n[For a further exposition of Graf von Klinekowstroem's views see the book\ncited above, p. 142, n. 3\n, and his articles in the Journal, xv. 329-34 and xxii.\n54-60.]\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1-931-\nmeteorological phenomena and the radio-active emanations of the\nground. It must be remembered that, for instance, a fall in atmo-\nspheric pressure is followed, among other things, by an increase of\nradio-active emanation and of ionised air from the pores of the\nearth. This cannot be without some influence on cloud-formation.\nThis leads us to a further fact that has been discovered, namely,\nthat lightning is the best spring-finder. How is this to be explained ?\nLightning does not (pace Schiller) inevitably strike the highest objects-\ntrees and towers ; it chooses the path of least resistance, which is\nadmittedly often that presented by the highest points. For this\nreason the lightning conductor, as is well known, must be taken\ndown into earth until underground water is reached. And it has\noften been observed that lightning strikes the same objects again\nand again. Professor 0. Hoppe had already remarked in 1906, in\nconnection with the observations of the dowser Landrat von Biilow-\nBothkamp, that \" the electrical discharges of lightning only strike\nwater or metal conductors which lead deep into the earth,\" and he\npointed to the connection between atmospheric electricity and veins\nof water or metal. As lodes and \" water-veins \" are frequently\nconnected with clefts, fissures, and faults in the earth, the choice of\nsuch places by lightning may be explained by the increased ionisa-\ntion of the earth's atmosphere, due to its increased conductivity,\nover these places. It is also a well-known fact that storks only nest\non roofs that are never struck by lightning, under which, that is,\nthere are no water-bearing strata. The stork instinctively avoids\nthe places which in some way make him feel uncomfortable owing\nto the change of the electro-magnetic field, owing to \" radiations \",\nor whatever else the reason may be. Similarly it is known that trees\ndo badly over underground water.\nThis leads us to a further observation : many dowsers (for\ninstance, von Billow, von Uslar, von Graeve, von Maltzahn) have\ndeclared that they cannot sleep, or that they suffer some injury to\ntheir general wellbeing. when they are over \" water-veins \". Lately\nit has even been maintained in various quarters that to live for a\nlong time over strong underground streams of water leads to serious\ninjury to health. A Dresden dowser, Frau Hedwig Winzer, together\nwith Dr R. Bach, has conducted a series of careful investigations\ninto this question. According to Bach it appeared that Frau Winzer\nwas able to locate underground streams wherever (unknown to her)\nsuch illnesses as cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, neuralgia, heart\ndiseases, etc., had occurred to a marked degree. Bach also cites\nother writers (Kolb, Prinzing, Werner) who, from quite different\npoints of view, in the investigation of the distribution of cancer and\nthe localisation of its occurrence in various districts have come to\nthe conclusion that local influences play a role in the etiology of\n\fNovember 1931 Towards a Theory of Dowsing\ncancer. Prinzing. however, had principally in mind the assumption,\nto-day no longer acceptable, that cancer is due to an infectious\ncontagion. Werner describes it as remarkable that in some diluvial\nand miocene areas the number of localities in which cancer is common\nis particularly high, whereas in gneiss areas such localities are in\ngeneral few. These questions are not yet ripe for discussion, par-\nticularly as the primary causes, in connection with which numerous\npossibilities can admittedly be put forward, are wholly obscure. At\nthe same time, these facts also tend to support the idea of a physical\ncause. It is to-day generally assumed that cancer is produced by\ncontinuous stimuli of various kinds, and prolonged living over under-\nground streams would be one such stimulus. Attempts are being\nmade in medical quarters to clear up this complex of problems.\nAnother phenomenon also appears to be relevant here : the\nobservation first made by Freiherr von Bassus in 1905 that in calm\nweather the whole system of streams and rivers on the surface of the\nearth is exactly reproduced by gaps in otherwise uniform clouds.\nBassus was able to observe and to photograph this remarkable\nphenomenon from a balloon over a cloud 390 feet thick and 2250 feet\nhigh. For this phenomenon also a satisfactory explanation is still\nlacking. We have here a projection of the streams of water on to\nthe clouds, exactly as the dowser indicates the perpendicular pro-\njection of underground running water or lodes.\nIf we analyse the phenomenon of dowsing into its basic elements\nwe see that we are concerned with a comparatively simple process.\nThe chief component is the primary cause of the dowser's reaction,\nwhich we seek in a physical stimulus of the nervous system of the\ndowser. In this connection there has to be studied the reaction\nitself, a good deal of light on which has been thrown, in particular,\nby Dr H. Haenel. In connection with the physiological mechanism\nof the movements of the rod we are concerned with a system in\nlabile tension, represented by the hands and arms separated by the\ndowsing-rod, which can be easily brought out of equilibrium by any\nvariations in the contractile state of the hand and arm musculature.\nAccording to Haenel this occurs by means of the relaxing of certain\nmuscles within a system of other muscles which retain their tension\nand innervation. The impulse producing this relaxation can be\nquite minute.\nOwing to the mysterious appearance of the phenomenon itself\nthis simple fact has been frequently obscured and complicated by\nfantastic theoretical systems and uses, which have produced much\nmischief. To these erroneous systems belong for instance the num-\nerical dowsing experiments of the late Professor Moritz Benedikt,\nwho thought he was able to draw exact conclusions as to the nature\nand composition of the substances searched for from the degree of\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1931\nthe circular movements of the dowsing-rod. In this we can only\nsee a serious self-deception, which can be very quickly shown to be\nsuch by means of exact tests. The complicated and in itself logically\nconstructed system of Benedikt undoubtedly arose in a similar\nmanner to the Mars language of the medium Helene Smith, which\nFlournoy was able to trace to the unconscious capacities of the\nmedium. Of the further mischief which has been worked in Germany\nwith the dowsing-rod and pendulum\u2014the diagnosis of illnesses, the\ninvestigation of eggs, the testing of the genuineness of pictures,\netc.. I would rather say nothing.\nWhat has been said about Benedikt applies also to the hypotheses\nand experiments which have recently been produced in France.\nHere M. Henri Mager, also on the basis of laboratory experiments,\nhas developed a very minutely specialised system and thinks that\nhe has discovered laws governing the polar attraction and repulsion\nof the rod over positive and negative poles. This fundamentally\nerroneous attitude to the problem has unfortunately obtained fol-\nlowers in France. Among these is the Vicomte Henri de France,\nfor instance, who in his recent booklet, also on the basis of armchair\ninvestigations, which he calls fundamental investigations, and from\nwhich he draws far-going theoretical and practical conclusions.\nThese appear to me to be just as mistaken as the experiments of\nBenedikt and Mager. At bottom the Vicomte de France agrees with\nthe dowsers that physical influences, \" earth-currents or waves \",\nare the primary causes of the reaction of the dowsing-rod. We will\nreturn to the question whether this agrees with the experiments\ndescribed by him. He thinks further that a special disposition is\nnot necessary for the dowser, but that anyone can acquire the art of\ndowsing. In this respect also our own investigations have led us to\na different conclusion. Indeed, we regard it as a possible danger\nthat the investigation of dowsing may be discredited by the work\nof unqualified and dilettante dowsers, if anyone imagines that he\nwill be able to produce results after brief instruction. The use of the\nsidereal pendulum, which lends itself even more easily than the\ndowsing-rod to serious self-deceptions, appears to us to be in itself\ndangerous. The Abbe Bouly, who uses a pendulum, and who\nappears to be highly thought of in France, diagnoses illnesses. The\nAbbe Mermet is able by the same method to indicate the yield of\nsprings to the decimal point of a minute-litre, according to the Vi-\ncomte de France. We have no doubt that these claims would\nquickly vanish under scientific examination. No dowser can produce\nsuch results. According to our investigations even the possibility\nof an accurate indication of depth is a very debatable point. We\ndoubt equally the accuracy of the \" sensational \" pendulum experi-\nments with eggs of Professor Bosset of Lausanne, as well as the\n\fNovember 1931 Towards a Theory of Dowsing 151\nalleged ability of the late dowser Probst to make chemical analyses\nin the same way.\nThe Vicomte de France describes as a fundamental experiment\none with a pendulum over an electrical pocket lamp, in which he\natrributes the movements of the pendulum to systematic reactions\nto zones of influence, etc. What he publishes are detailed theoretical\ndiscussions and observations, but no proofs. However much we\nacknowledge that the Vicomte de France requires dowsers to have\nconsiderable geological knowledge, we cannot see in these complicated\ninvestigations any way which leads to the solution of the problem\nof dowsing. Precisely as with the theory of Mager, we cannot see\nin the methods described by M. de France anything more than an\nerroneous system which can only lead to confusion. In our opinion\nwe are concerned here only with a mental phenomenon : the pen-\ndulum plays the role of an ascension pipe from the subconsciousness\n(to use a phrase of R. Tischner's), as in the case of automatic writing,\nthe planchette, or scrying. Only the views and expectations of the\nusers of the pendulum are exteriorised. In brief, the complicated\n\" physical \" hypotheses and investigations of the French dowsers\nare simply the chimeras of laymen.\n[Translated by Th. B.]\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1931\nIV\nREPLY TO GRAF VON KLINCKO WSTROEM\nBy Vicomte Henri de France\nGraf Carl von KHnckowstroem is too well known for his learned\nstudies on the dowsing-rod and for the high authority he has acquired\nfor me not to be disturbed by his criticisms and for me not to take\nthem into serious consideration. I hope for the rest that we shall\nbe able to reach an agreement fairly easily, as we start from the\nsame basis and the same principles. Like him I think that the\nmovements of the dowsers are caused by the action on our nervous\nsystem of terrestrial radio-activity and atmospheric electricity.\nLike him also, I fear \" unqualified and dilettante dowsers \". It is\nfor this reason that I insist so much on the necessity that dowsers\nshould be perfectly acquainted with geology. I consider that the\nrod and the pendulum are the diagnostic instruments of that science.\nConsequently, in order to use them with success, one must begin by\nbeing a geologist, just as one has to be an astronomer in order\nusefully to employ a telescope.\nI thought for a long time, like Graf von Klinckowstroem, that\nthe art of dowsing could only be exercised by a very few exception-\nally gifted persons. This would have been very regrettable, for the\nmajority of those who need it, geologists, mining engineers, water\nengineers, etc., would have been unable to use it. Happily the\nrecent discovery of the regulable pendulum, perfected by the Abbe\nFerran, has convinced me that almost anyone can become a dowser,\nprecisely because this pendulum is regulable, whereas the rod is not.\nThe experiments which I recommend with electric currents,\naccumulators, wireless sets, magnets, etc., are, above all, exercises\nfor practice, which the dowser must perform every day in order to\nkeep in form ; in certain aspects the art of the dowser bears some\nresemblance to a sport, and daily practice is far from being useless.\nThese experiments do not appear to me to be at all contradictory\nof the fundamental ideas of Graf von Klinckowstroem. It does not\nappear to me that there is any conflict between dowsing by means\nof telluric or atmospheric electricity and that which is done at home\nand at will. In a way these exercises recall a little those done by\nhunters and fishermen with their rifles and rods for the purpose of\ngetting into form.\nThe only valid criticism that could be made against these exercises\nwould be to demonstrate experimentally that they are impossible.\n\fNovember 1931 Towards a Theory of Dowsing 153\nbut I have good reasons for thinking that this could not be done.\nA number of dowsers actually perform these exercises. If they\nsucceed in judging with their pendulums whether their accumulators\nare more or less charged, which can be easily verified ;\nif, in varying\nthe length of their pendulum, they see on their wireless apparatus\nthat they are in harmony with stations of short, medium or long\nwave lengths, lengths proportionate to that of the thread of the\npendulum ; then I think that these dowsers will regard the pheno-\nmena of their art as more akin to the theories of induction and of\noscillating circuits than to those of the subconscious.\nTaking these considerations into account, I cannot see what\nobjections Graf von Klinckowstroem could make against these exer-\ncises, which, in addition to their intrinsic merits, have the advantage\nof emphasising in the eyes of beginners the laws of modern physics,\non which he. like myself, bases the movements of the rod and of the\npendulum.\nTo deny a priori, as does Graf von Klinckowstroem. the medical\ndiagnoses of the Abbes Bouly and Mermet appears to me to be\nacting a little hastily. Many facts which appear one day to contra-\ndict accepted theories' have to be recognised as true the following\nday. Personally, not being a doctor, I have not concerned myself\nwith the medical part of dowsing, but this part exists and is even\ndeveloping rapidly. During the year following the foundation of the\nAssociation des Amis de la Radiesthesie the number of doctors who\nhave joined it has increased to such an extent that there is a move-\nment on foot to organise a medical commission. I know a veterinary\ndoctor who is at this moment preparing a medical thesis on the\nextraordinary results he has obtained with the pendulum. I men-\ntion finally the work and the review of Dr J. Regnault, of Toulon,\nwhich Graf von Klinckowstroem certainly knows.\nThe truth is that the Abbe Bouly and the Abbe Mermet are\ndowsers of the first order, the former with the rod, the second with\nthe pendulum. While others were feeling their way and hesitating\nthey have been frankly in the vanguard, and this is the cause of the\ngreat fame they enjoy as much in France as abroad. Courage is a\nnecessary quality in its cause, and it is very fortunate that we\npossess men of this kind. Without them it is more than probable\nthat the art of the dowser would have continued in its century-old\nruts.\nThere are at the present time in Europe many excellent dowsers.\nI may mention, without attempting to be exhaustive : in France,\nM. Mager, the Abbes Bouly and Ferran, Frere Padey, MM. Vire,\nBidreman, Larvaron, Treyve, Mathieu, Turenne, Dr J. Regnault,\nColonel de Marsay, Colonel Moreau, etc. ; in Switzerland; the Abbe\nMermet, Professor Boseet ; in Germany and Austria, Herren von\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 193L\nGraeve, von Maltzahn, Dr Bayer, Dr Braun-Fernwald, Dr Claus ;\nin England, Mr Christie ; in Spain, Professor Darder Pericas, etc.\nThese gentlemen make no mystery, in general, of the means they\nemploy. They often make known the extraordinary results they\noccasionally obtain, and sometimes in the most unexpected regions.\nI think that under these circumstances it is imprudent to assign\nbarriers to the possibilities of dowsing. I think it is better to see\nwhich of the experiments can be easily reproduced by the average\ndowser. We shall then be able to see what is capable of being\nwidely utilised. This attitude appears to be better than that which\nconsists of an a priori denial, better even than the experiments of the\ninventors themselves, for we do not know, in the latter case, whether\ntheir experiments are capable of being reproduced, which is the\nimportant point in such a matter.\nThe easily reproduced experiment becomes a definite achievement\nand public property. It is well to seek for the scientific theory which\nexplains the fact, but we must remember that it is more than\nprobable that the theories we build to-day will be replaced by\nothers in a few years, themselves also destined to be modified.\n[Translated by Th. B.]\n\fNovember 1931 Towards a Theory of Dowsing 155\nV\nREPLY TO THE VICOMTE BE FRANCE\nBy Graf Carl von Klinckowstroem\nI regard as a fundamental error the assumption that anybody can\ndevelop himself into a dowser by practice. According to our\nexperience the mere movements of the rod in an individual's hands\nare not in themselves any indication that he is a useful dowser,\nsince these movements can be produced by ideomotor causes or\nsuggestion. And there are certainly many such dowsers who are\nnot in fact \" true \" dowsers. Their \" successes \" prove nothing. We\neven know some cases where excellent dowsers have lost their\nfaculty, as, for example, the Munich dowser Kurringer, who at one\ntime rendered valuable services to the Munich water board in con-\nnection with pipe-bursts, etc. To us the dowser is only an instru-\nment. The scientific solution of the problem and the experimental\ninvestigations of dowsers is a scientific matter. The experiments\nand theories of laymen cannot advance the problem, but will rather\nconfuse and discredit it. I cannot accept the instructions given in\nFrance for the education of dowsers. In my opinion they lead to\nserious self-deception and to the erection of theoretical systems\nwhich are also in the nature of self-deceptions, as in the cases of\nBenedikt and Mager. I consider the various capacities that are\nattributed in France to the dowsing-rod and pendulum to be mis-\ntaken, and I am convinced that they would very promptly be shown\nas such on exact investigation by experts. I have as yet heard\nnothing of such investigations. The use of \" samples \" is also based,\nin my opinion, on erroneous theoretical assumptions. On similar\nprinciples operated Schermuly's \" polarisator \", a pendulum-like\napparatus with a capsule containing a specimen of the object for\nwhich search was being made. The worthlessness of this apparatus\nwas demonstrated years ago by means of a series of careful experi-\nments in the Psychological Institute of the University of Frankfurt.\nIn 1913 Gustave Lebon briefly investigated the dowser Probst,\nwhose ability to distinguish objects was alleged to approach a\nchemical analysis in accuracy. Unfortunately these experiments\nwere not continued (cp. Nature, 1913, no. 2085).\nWhy is so little notice taken of dowsing to-day by official science\nand by the competent experts and local authorities in France ?\nThis lack of interest appears to me to be due to the fantastic claims\nand hypotheses of the dowsers. There are dowsers in Germany also\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1931\nwho make a great fuss about their alleged capabilities, but for the\nmost part there remains very little of these claims after expert\nanalysis or investigation. On the other hand, scientifically educated\ndowsers, free from fantastic theorising, allow their abilities to be\nexpertly investigated in the strict possible way. Among these may\nbe mentioned the investigation of Dr K. Osswald by the Stuttgart\nGeologist Dr Kranz, and of Freiherr von Maltzahn by the Freiberg\nInstitute of Mines and Board of Mines. The records of these exact\ninvestigations from a sure demonstration of the usefulness of the\ndowsing-rod in the hands of competent dowsers who are conscious\nof their responsibilities, so that science can no longer dismiss dowsing\nas an ancient superstition. Only such a procedure can. in my\nopinion, be serviceable to the subject, only so can the interest and\nconfidence of science be won. The rod and the pendulum as instru-\nments of divination we have, admittedly, entirely excluded from\nour observations. Dowsing of eggs, photographs, etc., we consider\na misuse which confuses the subject and which can only lead to the\ndiscrediting of the phenomenon. The solution of this problem is to\nbe found by simplification and not by complication.\n[Translated by Th. B.]\n\fNovember 1931 Towards a Theory of Doivsing 157\nVI\nTHE PSYCHICAL AND PHYSICAL THEORIES OF\nDOWSING\nBy Theodore Besterman\nIt will be seen that there are two explanations of dowsing (I am\nwriting here only of the dowser's \" perception \", that is, the third\nproblem stated in section I above). Sir William Barrett maintained\nthat dowsing is a purely psychical process, and to this view I sub-\nscribed, after an independent examination of the evidence, when\ncompiling The Divining-Rod after his death. On the other hand the\ncontinental investigators maintain that dowsing is a purely physical\nprocess. Graf von Klinckowstroem gives this view his unqualified\nsupport ; the Vicomte de France leaves a loophole for the psychical\ntheory as an explanation of certain phenomena only, but as these\nphenomena (dowsing from maps, medical diagnosis, etc.) appear to\nbe unsupported by evidence, M. de France may also be reckoned,\nas he says himself, an adherent of the physical theory.\nThis radical difference of opinion is aggravated by a partial\nabsence of the relevant data. For while in The Divining-Rod and in\nSir William Barrett's preceding reports some attempt was made to\nrefute the physical theories and to substantiate the psychical, the\nsupporters of the physical view have not produced any arguments\nin favour of their own theories and against ours. 1\nAnother difficulty\nis created by the vast differences between the various adherents of\nthe physical theories : to these the foregoing pages must bear\nsufficient testimony.\nBefore the arguments for and against any physical theory can be\nstated, it is necessary to understand more clearly what such a theory\ninvolves. As different writers, and even the same writers at different\ntimes, advocate varying physical theories to a considerable number,\nit is impossible to enter into all of them. Let us take two typical\nones. I find no details of any of the theories in the Handbuch or\nThe Modern Dowser, and I have therefore tried myself to put the\nmatter into concrete terms.\n1\nMy friend Graf Klinckowstroem will forgive me for pointing out that\nalthough he (Schriften des Verbands zur Klarung der Wiinschelrutenfrage, x.\n39-40) severely criticised The Divining-Rod for what he considered the in-\nadequate attention given in it to the physical theories (his complaint about\nthe reference to himself was perfectly justified), in the Handbuch neither he\nnor his collaborator makes the slightest attempt to deal with the psychical\ntheory, which is simply rejected de piano (pp. iii, 46, 71, 72).\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1931\nFirst, the electrical theory. Electrical currents are set up in the\nearth by natural electro-chemical activity, as by the oxidation of\nsulphide ore by water. The importance of this fact for geophysical\nprospecting lies in the varying conductive properties of rocks,\nminerals, water, etc. If the currents are measured at different\nplaces in a given area, the varying degrees of conductivity are\nascertained, and the nature of the subsoil is thus determined. This\nprocess, however, is very difficult owing to the inhomogeneity of\nmost areas : the presence of cleaved rocks or of mixed masses of\nhighly conductive and less conductive substances, to give only two\nexamples, infinitely complicates the work. 1\nSecond, the magnetic theory. The earth's magnetic field presents\ncertain anomalies. Some of these are due to the differences in the\nmagnetic susceptibilities of various substances. Thus, limestone or\nchalk may be up to ten times as permeable as coal2\n. The measure-\nment of the anomalies in the earth's field thus enables the nature\nof the subsoil to be determined.\nBoth these processes involve the use of complicated and some-\ntimes of massive apparatus.3\nThe physical theory of dowsing\nassumes that this apparatus is replaced by the dowser, who makes\nthe necessary observations direct.\nThe arguments for the physical theory may now be stated thus :\n(1) There is some conceivable affinity between it and so-called\nweather sensibility. If it is true, as seems likely, that some people\nbecome aware of changes in the weather, they may do so by being\nsensitive to electrical disturbances in the atmosphere. On the other\nhand, there is no evidence that they are and the facts are capable\nof explanation on different lines, as by sensitiveness to atmospheric\nmoisture. There is also no evidence, so far as I am aware, that\nweather sensibility is more common among dowsers than among\nother persons.\n(2) It is less liable to the reproach that the unknown is being\nexplained by the unknown.\n(3) The belief almost universally held by dowsers that a physical\nprocess is involved. This argument, however, is practically value-\nless ; first, because of the fact that the physical processes so advo-\ncated vary immensely from dowser to dowser and from generation\nto generation, following the latest fashionable view ;\nsecondly,\n1\nChiefly based on C. Schlumberger, Etude sur la prospection electrique du\nsous-sol (1920).\n2\nAmerican Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Geophysical Prospecting\n(1929), pp. 239 ff.\n3\nSee the valuable Report of the Imperial Geophysical Experimental Survey\nentitled The Principles and Practice of Geophysical Prospecting (Cambridge\n1931).\n\fNovember 1931 Towards a Theory of Dowsing 159\nbecause the dowser is usually (by no means always) unqualified to\nexpress an opinion.\nI need mention only one argument against any physical theory :\nthe complete absence of evidence for the existence in the human\nbody of any organ capable of detecting, discriminating between, and\nmeasuring various electrical, magnetic, and\/or radio-active currents,\nemanations or properties, and then of communicating the result to\nthe neuro-muscular system, and the inherent improbability that\nthe human organism should be capable of doing work outside itself\nof so complex and delicate a kind.\nThe psychical theory is that the dowser \" perceives \" the object\ndowsed for by some supernormal 1\nmeans, conveniently but perhaps\nmisleadingly described as clairvoyance or cryptesthesia.\nThe arguments for the psychical theory may be stated thus :\n(1) It is the simplest theory, in that it offers a clear and uniform\nexplanation of all the phenomena.\n(2) There is good evidence for the possession by many dowsers of\nsome supernormal faculty apart from their dowsing. Thus, Jacques\nAymar was apparently able to trace criminals [The Divining-Rod,\npp. 27-31). Sir Herbert Maxwell gives a careful account of a similar\nfeat by an amateur dowser, Mr R. Howson (ibid., pp. 255-6). The\nsame gentleman is said to have been able to identify pieces of\ncrockery by dowsing (ibid., p. 256). There is a certain amount of\nevidence on record for the finding of lost and hidden objects by\ndowsing (ibid., pp. 256-60). Miss Miles was able not only to find\nlost and hidden objects, but spoke of \" seeing \" them (ibid., p. 261 ;\ncp. pp. 160-6). Miss Miles also, as is well known, took part in\nsuccessful experiments in thought-transference (Proceedings, xxi.\n60 ff ., xxvii. 279 ff ). The amateur dowser Mr F. J. Young conducted\na few experiments in clairvoyance by automatic writing, in which\nhe was decidedly successful (The Divining-Rod, pp. 264-6).\n(3) The descriptions given by some dowsers of their procedure\nand sensations strongly suggest a psychical process. Thus, like Miss\nMiles, the boy dowser Guy Fenley was spoken of as \" seeing \" the\nwater (ibid., p. 261). Another young dowser was similarly reported\nby Professor R. F. A. Hoernle (ibid., p. 261). Among older examples\nmay be mentioned the case reported by Dr Ashburner, the remarkable\ncases of Katharina Beutler and Anna Maria Briegger, and those of\nPedegacha and Jean Jacques Parangue (see references in ibid., p. 263),\nand, most notable of all, the Spanish Zahoris (ibid., pp. 277-82).\n1\nIt is worth noting that some adherents of a physical theory dismiss the\npsychical view on the ground that it is \" supernormal \", but the view that a\ndowser can become directly aware of terrestrial magnetism, for instance, is\njust as supernormal.\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1931\nThe only specific argument against the psychical theory that I\ncan suggest is inherent in its supernormal nature : we ought not\nto explain the unknown by the unknown if we can help it.\nIt appears to me that, so far as we have gone, the evidence and the\nprobabilities are emphatically on the side of the psychical theory,\nand that the adherents of any physical theory have yet to produce\nevidence justifying the further investigation of their views.\n\fNo. 480.\u2014Vol. XXVIJ.

Society, 31 Tavistock Square, W.C. 1, on Wednesday, 30\nSeptember 1931, at 5.30 p.m., Dr V. J. Woolley in the Chair.\nThe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas read a paper entitled \" A Con-\nsideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings, with special reference to the\nSources of Veridical Information and to the Method of its Recep-\ntion,\" of which the following is a summary :\nThe sittings he referred to were those he had taken on behalf of\nbereaved persons who had written to him for help. Such persons\nwere in most cases quite unknown to him and in all cases to the\nmedium, Mrs Leonard. In the records so obtained he found both\nfailures and successes. Some of them he had sent to Mrs Salter,\nMr Saltmarsh, and Mr Besterman, who agreed that they presented\ngood evidence of a supernormal nature. Whence came the veridical\ninformation ? The adoption of the telepathic hypothesis involved\nvery great difficulties, for there was in most cases a complete absence\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1931\nof link between the medium and the Communicator. Indeed, in one\ncase in which the conditions were more favourable to the operation\nof telepathy than they were in most of these proxy sittings, the\nresult was a failure.\nThe same reasoning applied to clairvoyance, for in twelve cases\nwhere the conditions favoured clairvoyance he obtained two suc-\ncesses, three doubtful cases, and seven failures. Passing briefly\nover other still less likely theories he came to the conclusion that\nthe veridical information did in fact come from the purporting\nCommunicator. When the results were examined from this point\nof view it was interesting to observe the wide differences in the degree\nand kind of success obtained by the different Communicators. It\nappeared that young, well-educated Communicators were the most\nsuccessful in transmitting evidential information through the\nmedium. These conclusions were tentative and he would continue\nhis investigations on those lines.\nThe Chairman questioned whether we really knew so much as\nMr Thomas had implied of the conditions favourable to telepathy.\nMr J. W. Findlater described his co-operation with Miss Nea\nWalker in a proxy sitting which failed. He felt that insufficient\nattention was given to the possibility of chance-coincidences in\nthese cases, and gave illustrations from his own experience.\nThe Kev. J. W. Hayes asked what was known about the identity\nof Mrs Leonard's Control Feda.\nMr A. W. Trethewy emphasised the difficulty of applying the\ntelepathic hypothesis to the results obtained in proxy sittings, since\nthey did not know what conditions were favourable.\nMr Besterman said that Mr Thomas's analysis of the different\ntypes of Communicators with reference to the degree of success\nobtained by them was a valuable contribution to the theory of\nspirit communications. He suggested that the analysis might be\nextended to the applicants.\nThe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas, in reply, said that he accepted\nthe identity of Feda as what Feda claimed it to be. He agreed that\nthe nature of telepathy and its conditions were still unknown, but\nconsidered that after making all possible allowances, telepathy\nwould not cover the facts.\nProof of Survival.\nThe 108th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Library\nof the Society, 31 Tavistock Square, W.C. 1, on Wednesday 28\nOctober, at 5.30 p.m., Professor F. 0. S. Schiller in the Chair.\nMr H. F. Saltmarsh read a paper entitled \" Is Proof of Survival\nPossible ? \", which will be published in Part 122 of Proceedings.\n\fDecembek 1931 Proof of Survival 165\nThe Chairman said that lie was not sure whether different parts\nof Mr Saltmarsh's paper were quite consistent with each other. He\nbegan very correctly and soundly by pointing out that there was\na good deal of dispute about the nature of proof and whether there\nwas actually such a thing as what used to be called conclusive proof.\nHe wanted to underline that statement of Mr Saltmarsh's because\nhe believed it could be shown that the critics of conclusive proof\nwere certainly right, in all probability, that was. Proof existed as\nwhat used to be called logical certainty and also existed as psycholo-\ngical certainty. He did not himself see why in psychical research\nthey should expect to get any greater kind of truth. He would ask\nMr Saltmarsh whether he believed or denied that there was such a\nthing as proof by accumulation of evidence, indefinitely prolonged\nbut sooner or later capable of becoming, psychologically at any rate,\nconvincing. If he did not deny that it seemed to him that it was\npossible for pieces of evidence which were quite inconclusive in them-\nselves to support each other and to strengthen the case in favour\nof an hypothesis. These cases taken separately had certain weak-\nnesses, but taken together they supported each other because the\ncombination of them would not have those weaknesses. He thought\nthat was a possibility. Risks had to be taken in psychical research\njust as they had to be taken in other sciences. There was no such\nthing as absolute certainty.\nMr G. R. S. Mead pointed out that the theory of the spiritual or\netheric body had a great deal to be said for it and that its rejection\nwould involve any theory of survival in considerable difficulties.\nMr Besterman said that the case Mr Saltmarsh had put forward\nwas even stronger in practice than in theory, since most of Mr Salt-\nmarsh's ideal cases did not in fact exist.\nDr V. J. Woolley suggested that that would be equally true of any\nscience.\nThe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas referred to the distinction between\nobjective and subjective proof, and pointed out that whether or not\nthe former was attainable, the latter clearly was.\nOther members took part in the discussion, and Mr Saltmarsh\nbriefly replied.\nTHE LOURDES CURE.\nWe print below extracts translated from some correspondence\nconcerning cures at Lourdes which has passed between Count\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo and Dr Monnier, whose book Etude\nmedicate de quelques guerisons survenues a Lourdes, he reviewed in\nProceedings, xxxix. 369-75.\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1931\nDr Monnier to Count Perovsky, 13 February 1931\n:\n\" If I understand your conclusions rightly, you are of opinion\nthat an enquiry concerning Lourdes scientifically conducted might\nbe fruitful, but you have doubts as to the possibility of such an\nenquiry.\n\" Let me point out to you the existence at Lourdes of a '\nBureau\nde constatations medicales '\nopen to all physicians of whatever\nnationality and whatever be their faith or agnosticism ; a member\nof a scientific society wishing to conduct an enquiry would, I think,\nbe admitted to it (Dr Vallet is its director).\"\nCount Perovsky to Dr Monnier, 17 February 1931\n:\n\" I know that there does exist at Lourdes a '\nBureau de constata-\ntions medicales '\nand that Dr Vallet is its director. You think that\na member of a scientific society would be admitted to it.\n\" In my opinion that is not enough. I had in view an independent\ncommission acting in a parallel way, but outside the '\nBureau,' a\ncommission in which Catholics might most certainly take part, but\nwhich would have chiefly and first of all a scientific and non-con-\nfessional character.\n\" I am far from rejecting the Lourdes cures just as I am far from\nrejecting stigmata, but I note\u2014and this is proved by the instance\nof Konnersreuth\u2014that most unfortunately many Catholics do not\nrealise what an impartial and objective investigation, worthy of the\nname, must be in this sphere nowadays. I acknowledge that they\nhave the most absolute right to address themselves to their co-\nreligionists only, not leaving the sphere of faith ; but at Lourdes as\nwell as at Konnersreuth they often appeal to the scientific and\ncritical spirit, nay, to sceptics. Well, if that be so, so far as Theresa\nNeumann is concerned, very little has hitherto been done to give\nsatisfaction to those who are competent to conduct such kinds of\nresearches outside of all confessional considerations ; nor am I sure\nthat the Lourdes standard is always of such a nature as to content\nthis last category of researchers.\"\nDr Monnier to Count Perovsky, 9 March 1931\n:\n\" It seems to me that a commission of enquiry such as you suggest\nwould do fruitful work at Lourdes. Would it be the first to come\nand work there ? I do not think so. Quite recently Mgr Gerlier,\nBishop of Lourdes, referred before me to the presence at Lourdes of\na group of Protestant physicians who had come with this very object\nof making an enquiry.\n\" As to the method to be pursued, the commission might find\ninspiration in that adopted by Dr Goret, whose name is connected\n\fDecember 1931 The Lourdes Cure 167\nwith the third observation referred to in my thesis, that upon\nEmilie Cailleux. He obtained in Paris the list of the sick persons\nleaving for Lourdes and examined them, then betook himself to\nLourdes to observe what happened to these malades. He thus found\nstanding and walking E. Cailleux, who had been treated for Pott's\ndisease, complicated by paraplegia, which made it impossible for\nher to walk, under Prof. Lecene in the St Louis hospital. . . .\n!:\nThe Presse medicah\u2014the most widely read French medical\nperiodical\u2014published on 24 May last a paper on Theresa Neumann.\n. . . From the documents quoted by the author it follows that\nTheresa Neumann was observed at leisure by one non-Cathobc at\nleast, Doctor Fritz Gerlich.\"\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE MYSTERIOUS MADAME.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014Before I wrote my review of Mr Roberts's book. I made\ninquiries from persons who had been closely associated with F. W. H.\nMyers during Madame Blavatsky's lifetime, and was informed that\nthough he, together with some other members of the S.P.R., was at\nfirst favourably disposed towards Madame Blavatsky, he had not\nat any time been a member of the Theosophical Society. I therefore\nasked Mr Roberts for his authority for the statement that he was at\nany time a Theosophist, and he refers me to Madame Blavatsky and\nColonel Olcott. neither of whose testimony can. I think, be con-\nsidered of much weight. Further inquiries fully confirm the infor-\nmation I had earlier received.\nMr Roberts considers the description of Myers as a Professor too\ntrivial an inaccuracy to deserve attention. I do not believe that\nMr Myers himself would have so regarded it.\nYours, etc.,\nW. H. Salter.\nTHE MEDIUM FRAU SILBERT.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Concerning the account of the sitting which Studienrat\nRudolf Lambert had with Frau Maria Silbert in Graz, on the 28th\nMarch 1929, and which he published in the July number of this\nJournal, we beg to be permitted to bring out the following short\ncounter-declaration.\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1931\nStudienrat Rudolf Lambert's report is rather at variance with\nour observations, which are accordant with those of the other four\nsitters. In spite of Herrn Lambert's subjective conviction of the\nungenuineness of what he saw, we cannot grant him the right to\nspeak publicly of fraudulent phenomena on account of so few\nsittings (three, perhaps more correctly two and a half). That is a\npoint of view which already such researchers as Sir Oliver Lodge\nand Prof. Dr Richet supported and to which, moreover, Herr\nLambert himself consented expressis verbis in his letters directed\nto us.\nWhich of the two subjective opinions is also objectively true will\nhave to be decided by\u2014psychic science.\nYours, etc.,\nFranz Haslinger.\nDaniel Walter.\n[The above letter, which is printed as received, was forwarded to\nHerr Lambert, who replied : \"I agree with Messrs Haslinger and\nWalter that it may often be difficult to judge the nature of a med-\nium's phenomena after only a few sittings. Still, my sittings with\nFrau Silbert were overwhelmingly convincing for one who sat,\ncarefully observing, next to her. Those who refuse to believe this\nmust not forget that Dr Prince and Mr Besterman also had two\nsittings each, and that Mr Dingwall, who came to the same con-\nclusion as we did, also had sittings with Frau Silbert. Finally,\nMessrs Wahrlich, Gierke, Alter, Linhart, and Somogyi had sittings,\non the reports of which Professor Benndorf based his accusations\nagainst this medium. So that the view that Frau Silbert often\nproduces fraudulent phenomena is based on over a dozen sittings in\nwhich took part nine independent sitters, most of whom were\noriginally very favourably inclined towards the medium and who\ncame to the conclusion that she is untrustworthy. Would it not\nhave been a falsification of the scientific investigation of Frau Sil-\nbert's mediumship if all these careful reports had been suppressed ?\n\"\n(Translated)].\nREVIEWS.\nDame Edith Lyttelton, Our Superconscious Mind. 8vo, pp. v.\n285. London: Philip Allan, 1931. Price 10s. 6d. net.\nLike many others interested in psychical research, Mrs Lyttelton\nhas felt the need of further subdivision of our mental strata ; more\nclassification becomes desirable as facts accumulate. \" Subliminal\n\"\nhas been and may remain a useful term, but it has been rather too\n\fDecember 1931 Reviews 169\ninclusive. Myers himself said that it was part rubbish heap and\npart king's treasury, for he attributed to it not only the pork-pie-\nengendered nightmare, the psychic processes underlying bodily\nfunctions, and the causation of diseases such as neurasthenia, but\nalso the inspirations of genius and the manifestation of faculties\nwhich we call telepathic, clairvoyant, and the like. Andrew Lang\nused to say that, sooner or later, we should have to divide the sub-\nliminal into Subliminal One and Subliminal Two ; the former for\nthe lower phenomena, and Number Two for the higher. But the idea\nwas not carried out until now. Mrs Lyttelton divides our mental\nstrata into subconscious, conscious, and superconscious ; a useful\nand suitable classification. The subconscious is the \" aboriginal in\nthe basement,\" while the superconscious is concerned with higher\npsychic facrdty and with inspiration, \" which is another word for\na message from the superconscious part of mind, which has contact\nwith a wider world than has the conscious mind \"\n(p. 41). The\nauthor refers to Freud, Jung, and other psycho-analysts, with\nrespect for their work but without going into detail or expressing\nan opinion on their theories ; then proceeds to a description of\nvarious forms of automatism such as dreams, hypnagogic visions,\nvisual and auditory hallucinations, automatic writing, crystal\nvision, and so on. Instances are given of veridical dreams or other\nveridical experiences, a few of these being hitherto unpublished,\nbut many of them being quoted from Phantasms of the Living or\nvolumes of our Proceedings. However, most readers have forgotten\nthem or have not read them in their original place, so it is well that\nthey should be repeated. The selection is made merely with de-\nscriptive intent, or at most as showing the occurrence of supernormal\nevents ; the question of communication with discarnate minds is\nnot discussed.\nFurther chapters deal with the inspiration of the Hebrew prophets,\nmysticism, genius ; what Myers called a subliminal uprush is here\ncalled a percolation from the superconscious, which indeed may\nreceive its inspiration from an external source.\nThe purport of the book is to show that supernormal things do\nhappen\u2014that knowledge is received in some unknown way, concern-\ning events distant in time or space ; and to relate modern evidence\nto other and older and higher inspirations. The introduction of the\nterm \" superconscious \" is a good idea, though Mrs Lyttelton of\ncourse knows well enough that all spatial symbolisms for a non-\nspatial thing\u2014the mind\u2014is sure to be inadequate and perhaps\nmisleading. But it is useful to make these images, and there is a\ngood deal to be said for the \" superconscious.\"\nJ. A. H.\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1931\nH. Dennis Bradley, . . . And After. 8vo, pp. 400, ill. London :\nT. Werner Laurie, Ltd., 1931. Price 10s 6d. net.\nThis book is a record of Mr Bradley's various psychical experiences\nsince 1925. In the earlier chapters he gives a report of sittings with\na number of mediums for mental phenomena, such as Mrs Osborne\nLeonard, Mrs Barkell, Mrs Garrett and Mrs Hester Dowden. The\nresults were of the usual type and afford some evidence for know-\nledge supernormally acquired. In particular the German \" psycho-\nmetric medium \" Frau Lotte Plaatz (sic) described with some\naccuracy the physical and mental peculiarities of the former owner\nof a gold cigarette-case handed to her by Mr Bradley (pp. 50-3).\nIt is to the last part of the book that most readers will turn with\nspecial interest. Mr Bradley here describes in detail his exposure\nof the well-known \" direct-voice \" medium, George Valiantine.\nThis exposure gains additional weight from the fact that Mr Bradley\nhas been, and to some extent still is, one of Valiantine's most con-\nvinced adherents. Briefly, what Mr Bradley proved beyond all\nreasonable doubt is that on various occasions alleged supernormal\nfinger-prints, obtained in some cases on smoked paper, in others on\nwax, were fraudulently produced by Valiantine himself. For details\nthe reader must turn to Mr Bradley, but one point is worth noting\nhere for its possible bearing on results obtained with other mediums :\nin producing these prints Valiantine was found to have used three\nparts of his body, his fingers, his elbow joint and his great toe.\nMr Bradley still maintains that the direct-voice phenomena\nobserved with Valiantine at earlier sittings were genuine, and enters\ninto furious controversy with Dr Kroner (pp. 107-74), and with Mr\nRossi and Mr Castellini (sic) in regard to suspicious circumstances\nnoted at sittings in which these various observers took part (pp. 182-\n8). To sceptical readers the following question (amongst others)\nmay occur : If the spirit voices are genuine, how did it happen that\nat the sitting of 27 February 1931 (pp. 351 ff.) two of Valiantine's\nregular communicators, \" Pat O'Brien \" and \" Bert Everett,\"\nmanifested in the usual way\u2014Mr Bradley notes that Pat O'Brien's\nvoice was \" characteristic \" and his words \" delivered in a natural\nmanner \"\n\u2014and apparently vouched for the genuineness of an\nalleged finger-print of the late Sir Henry Segrave, afterwards proved\nto be a print of Valiantine's right middle finger ?\nBut whatever uncomfortable doubts such questions may raise\nwe can at any rate compliment Mr Bradley on the ingenuity he and\nhis friends showed in trapping Valiantine and the frankness with\nwhich their discoveries are set forth.\nTo this Society, as was perhaps to be expected, Mr Bradley has no.\ncompliments to offer !\nH. de G.

Price 7s. 6cl. net.\nAll those who have had the opportunity of working with Mrs\nLeonard agree that her honesty and sincerity are above suspicion.\nThis enviable reputation will be enhanced by the present book.\nFor although some of the stories told by Mrs Leonard could no\ndoubt be explained on less satisfactory lines than those dictated by\nher charitable judgment, it is always clear that Mrs Leonard herself\nis quite convinced of the reality of what she is describing.\nAs Sir Oliver says in his Foreword, Mrs Leonard's book\n\" represents fairly and truly the feelings and interpretations of a\nsensitive's experiences, and contains material for psychological\nstudy.\" Some of the most interesting of such material is contained\nin the remarkable and horrible experience gone through by Mrs\nLeonard, when, after having some teeth extracted under an anaes-\nthetic, she lived through the whole process night after night in sleep\n(pp. 18-9). Clearly, it is not all fun to be a medium !\nIt is pleasant to read Mrs Leonard's tribute to the S.P.R. \" The\nSociety for Psychical Research,\" she writes, \" the officials and\nmembers of which always showed me the greatest sympathy and\nconsideration, were all delightful sitters with whom it was a pleasure\nand satisfaction to work \"\n(p. 59). And, emanating from the\nsource they do, the following words on the same page merit careful\nattention :\n\" How greatly the sitter can help one's mediumship to\ndevelop ! The wise, cautious, even sceptical sitter, if he has an\nopen mind, gets the best results, and is a great factor in definitely\nbuilding up, little by little, the psychical and mental forces of the\nmedium, and even of the control. The credulous,\n;\nI'm willing to\nbelieve anything, my dear. I don't want tests,' kind of sitter does\nnot improve the quality of one's mediumship, nor get the best\nresults.\"\nMrs Leonard is to be congratulated on a most interesting, modest,\nand admirably written book, which no student of the subject will\nread without profit. Th. B.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nRevue Metapsychique, March-April 1931.\nThis number opens with a warmly worded obituary notice by Dr\nOsty of M. Jean Meyer, the founder and benefactor of the Paris\nInstitut Metapsychique International, who died on 13 April last.\nIncidentally we learn from this notice that the Institute's present\nlabours are about to give a new impetus to the researches bearing\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1931\non \" the creative power of thought.\" We wish these researches\nevery success.\nThe same writer has a lengthy paper on \" How to discover, to\ndevelop and not to pervert the faculty of supernormal knowledge.\"\nIncidents connected with Pascal Forthuny's alleged powers are\nbriefly narrated, some, undoubtedly, very striking (p. 106). Much\nto be commended is Dr Osty's advice to researchers to apply the\nsubject's supernormal faculties only to realities, which can be con-\ntrolled (p. 113). Though to many of us such advice will appear\nsuperfluous, it is, I am afraid, very useful so far as the average\ninvestigator is concerned.\nM. Delevsky pursues his study of \" The Riddle of Premonition.\"\nHe gives hardly any facts, only very abstract discussions, many of\nwhich lie quite outside our sphere of research. It almost staggers\none to see such imposing edifices of speculation erected on so slender\na basis of fact. The paper is still unfinished.\nM. de Vesme brings to a close his very instructive study of stigma-\ntised persons, including \" luminous \" or perfumed stigmata, \" plas-\ntic \" ones, stigmata in the heart, etc. The evidential value of the\ncases (also of the categories of alleged \" phenomena \") differs widely.\nOf peculiar interest is the chapter dealing with stigmata in connection\nwith non-Catholics. The impression left by this chapter can, I think,\nbe summed up thus : the difference is so tremendous that one almost\nhesitates to say that it is not so much qualitative as quantitative.\nOn the other hand, Roman Catholics themselves have acknowledged\nthat per se stigmata are not evidence of holiness. A characteristic\ninstance occurs on p. 137, where a case of stigmatisation occurring\nin the lifetime of St Ignatius of Loyola is quoted which the founder\nof the Jesuits put down to diabolical intervention, on account of\nthe girl's by no means virtuous behaviour.\nI may add that a case of apparently quite authentic stigmatisation\nseems to have just been medically attested at Naples, where, on the\ndeath of Madre Maria Landi, a Franciscan nun who had a great\nreputation for sanctity, the presence of five stigmata on her hands,\nfeet and left side was officially registered after examination of the\ndead body by four physicians and Cardinal Ascalesi, Archbishop of\nNaples.

Personally I find lycanthropy very much less incredible\nthan the dematerialisation and rematerialisation of a human being,\na phenomenon which is accepted by many students. Lycanthropy\ncould be explained on the same lines as Gurney's explanation of\nwitchcraft : for the \" impossible \" phenomena there is probably\nno evidence, and the residuum is probably due to isolated and extreme\nforms of atavism. But how can one even begin to explain the de-\nand re-materialisation of a living being ? However, apart from one\nor two such points Mr Carrington's article is very sound.

Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., in the\nChair.\nMr A. W. Trethewy read a paper entitled \" Personalities of\nControls and Communicators bearing Ancient or Unknown Names \",\nwhich is printed below, slightly abridged.\nIt is difficult to frame a short title for this paper. May I give an\nexplanation ? Firstly the paper is written for believers in super-\nnormal phenomena, physical and mental, for those who are con-\nvinced that genuine cases do occur though there have been instances\nof deception. In the cases to be considered I take the good faith\nof the medium for granted. My object is to initiate a discussion\nof \" Controls \", including \" Communicators \", who do not claim to\nhave been associated on earth with any person now living. By\nnarrowing the field in this way a large class is excluded, chiefly\nconsisting of deceased relatives and friends of sitters. I deal only\nwith \" Controls \" whose description of themselves cannot be\nchecked by reference to the memories of persons still alive. I have\nin view mainly historical characters and the bearers of symbolic\nnames such as Truth, Power, etc., who give no further indication\nof their identity. Let us consider the historical characters first.\nThey are well represented in the mediumship of Stainton Moses by\nsuch figures as Grocyn, John Dee and Elizabeth Barton, the Holy\nMaid of Kent, who quoted incidents of their lives on earth in\nsupport of their claims to the characters they assumed. These\ndetails were checked by consulting biographies. Where the infor- *\nmation tallied with the literary authorities it could be attributed\nto the subliminal mind of the medium who might have read or\nheard the account and his recollection have faded. It might also\nbe ascribed to the clairvoyance of the medium on the lines of a\nbook-test. Rector did actually quote the words of a book to\nStainton Moses as an experiment. Other \" Controls \" might have\nconsulted their biographies in the same way, and indeed were said\nto have done so to refresh their memories. On the other hand if\nthere was no record corroborating the statement it was hard to say\nwhether the soi-disant spirit had invented the story, or the bio-\ngraphy was incomplete. So the question of identity cannot be\nsettled on these lines. It is even more difficult to come to a con-\nclusion about entities who are silent about their antecedents or\nclaim a character of whom there is no record.\nIt will take us a step on the way if we can decide whether the\nprofessed spirit is a subliminal creation of the medium, including\n\fJanuary 1932 Private Meeting 179\nin this term a secondary personality, or is a being external to the\nmedium. Let us take the case of the Holy Maid of Kent. She\nbegan to write an account of her life through the hand of Stainton\nMoses, but as her writing was hard to read, she made way for the\n*>\nControl \" Doctor who wrote for her what she wished to say. As\nlong as she used the pen she made correct statements, but when she\nmade over charge to Doctor he made a serious inaccuracy. It\ncertainly does look as if there were two personalities, the Holy\nMaid who knew all the facts, and Doctor her guarantor, who had\ngot up his case badly.\nAnother incident to be considered is the simultaneous manifesta-\ntions of Grocyn and Catherine Speer. Grocyn was making some\nextraordinary musical sounds, and was so engrossed in his work\nthat he forgot to regulate the power, and the oversight had dangerous\nconsequences for Stainton Moses who was found doubled up on the\nground. As the seance was in the dark his condition was not\nobserved till Catherine gave repeated warnings that something was\nwrong. A light was then struck, and the meeting closed. The most\nplausible explanation of this incident is that Grocyn and Catherine\nwere separate entities who used Stainton Moses's organism at the\nsame time for independent purposes. This seems much more likely\nthan that such a scene was part of the plot of a subliminal drama.\nA similar situation, but less convincing, may be found in the\nPiper records. Rector gives teaching to a sitter, G. B. D., whose\nrelations are said to be present in spirit. The by-play between them\nand Rector looks very like the talk of separate entities. [A passage\nis here omitted relating to G. Geley, Clairvoyance and Materialisa-\ntion (1927), pp. 258-260].\nOther instances of the apparent independence of \" Controls\n\"\nare the cases in which mediums, speaking in trance or with the\ndirect voice, or writing automatically, exhibit knowledge or quali-\nties which they do not seem to possess under normal conditions.\nThere have been many occasions on which a language unknown to\nthe medium has been spoken by the control.\nThis part of the argument may be summarised by the statement\nthat there have been cases in which the probabilities seem to be in\nfavour of the \" Control \" being an entity independent of the medium,\nrather than a subliminal creation. This conclusion does not commit\nus to the recognition of the truth of the \" Controls \" claim to the\nalleged identity. Some of Stainton Moses's \" Controls \", though\nthey displayed no traits actually at variance with their alleged\nantecedents, failed to show knowledge and qualities appropriate to\ntheir parts. Perhaps their unfamiliarity with the processes of\ncommunication furnished them with a reasonable excuse for their\ndefects. If they were not the persons they professed to be, were\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1932\nthey simply personating spirits deceiving the circle for purposes of\ntheir own ? There seems reason to suppose that such personation\ndoes occur with some mediums. But Imperator, the head of\nStainton Moses's band, made a very good defence against such a\ncharge. He argued that it was unjust to suppose that spirits with\nteaching to give like theirs could start their mission with lies in\ntheir mouths about their credentials. There certainly is a good\ndeal in this contention. It is difficult to believe that, with their\nmotives being so good as they appeared, the Controls gave false\nnames in order to ensure a hearing.\nThe position of Mrs Piper's \" Controls \" is even more uncertain.\nThey seem to have been independent of her, but they signally\nfailed to establish their claims to be identical with Stainton Moses's\n\" Controls \" bearing the same symbolical names such as Imperatorr\nRector, etc. They gave different names for their lives on earth,\nand their stories not only fell short of proof, but showed the claims\nto be untrue. There is nevertheless the same difficulty in believing\nthem guilty of wilful deceit. They did excellent work with Mrs\nPiper, managed her powers well, and gave some fine teaching. Such\nspirits are not likely to have lied for the sake of getting access to the\nmedium.\nA possible solution seems to me that when a \" Control \" says he\nwas a particular person in his life on earth, he does not signify just\nwhat we should mean by such words. Personality may not persist\nafter death with unchanged nature, it may become more complex*\nAt first there is apparently not much difference, but in later stages\nthe constitution may change and combine with other spirits. Or it\nmay be that the personality even on earth is more complex than it\nseems to us, but only part of it is revealed, the remainder lying\nunder the subliminal level for subsequent development. The\nconsideration of such questions must be speculative in that there is\nno experimental knowledge, and no source of information, except\nperhaps the teachings of religion and philosophy, and the com-\nmunications from spirits. I may refer to two recent messages\namong several, which have been published on this subject. There\nis an article by Miss Gibbes in the magazine Psychic Science for\nJuly, describing two simultaneous visits of Myers to different\nmediums, and his explanation of his use of two personalities at the\nsame time. In the paper Light of 14 August, Power, the Control of\nMrs Morris, is quoted as saying that the spirit realises personality\nafter passing from physical life, being different from what it was on\nearth. Power said that he himself had become so identical with\nthose spirits of the higher state who were working for the evolution\nof mankind, that even the name he had given was simply one\nwhich represented a great store-house, or register of power ; the\n\fJanuary 1932 Private Meeting LSI\nmessage which he gave came from many. This statement resembles\nthe group theory of the spiritualists that the higher spirits blend\ninto groups and have a corporate existence in that union. The\nword group must not be construed literally, it is only the nearest\nway to approach the idea in human thought and language. The\nTheosophical belief in a greater self embracing many individual\nsouls is of much the same kind. Perhaps some such theory will go\nsome part of the way to help us to understand the \" Controls\n\"\npoint of view regarding his antecedents on earth. [A passage based\non Mr Trethewy's Biblical Criticism and Psychical Research (1930),\npp. 58-64, 88, 89, is here omitted.]\nNow, let me state my conclusions. I have dealt mainly with the\nwork of Stainton Moses and Mrs Piper, because these are the two\nmediums whom I have studied most. As to the former, there is\ngood reason to suppose that his historical \" Controls \" had an\nexternal and independent entity. Even so, it is of course con-\nceivable that the characters assumed by them were not those of\ntheir real past, but fictitious garbs forced on them by the subliminal\nfancies of the medium. There is, however, no indication of such\ninfluence ; the names were not what he expected, and were extracted\nfrom the \" Controls \" with difficulty. Most of them played their\nparts fairly well, and some of them seemed to know more about the\nlives of the persons they professed to have been, than did the\nmedium and the sitters. Making due allowance for changes of\npersonality after the expiry of long periods, I think it not un-\nreasonable to believe that there was some connection between, say\nImperator and the prophet Malachi, though they were not identical\nin the same sense as a person recently deceased and his spirit. To\nturn to the\n'\n' Controls\n'\n' of Mrs Piper, the case for their independent\nexistence is hardly so strong, and one cannot feel that the claims to\nidentity with the spirits inspiring Stainton Moses were not due to\nher subliminal fancies. I would, however, acquit the \" Controls\n\"\n(if they had an independent existence, as is quite likely) of any\ndishonest intention in the way of false personation. If they had no\nright to the assumed characters, the claims were made for them,\nunconsciously of course, by the medium and not by themselves.\nThe good work they did for her, and the high tone of their messages\nfurnish a sufficient reply to any charge of wilful fraud.\nThough I am not prepared to argue that the \" Controls \" of\nStainton Moses and Mrs Piper were the same entities, it does seem\npossible to me that the same \" Control \" may work for two mediums\nand give to each of them a different account of his life on earth.\nAs perhaps in the case with ourselves also, he may have a more\ncomplex constitution than we realise. He and we may be governed\nby several influences which are parts of ourselves, but in another\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1932\nsense independent of us and not restricted to ourselves, capable of\naffecting others at the same time. If such an influence was part of\nthe composition of Stainton Moses's Imperator it could conceivably\nhave inspired Malachi long ago, and Mrs Piper's Imperator in\nthese days, besides other beings at the same times. I can also\nimagine that Imperator, instead of being governed by the influence,\nwas that influence itself, personified temporarily for Stainton\nMoses and Mrs Piper. This is merely an attempt to indicate in a\ngeneral manner an example of the lines on which an explanation\nmay be sought. My point is that we should always keep our eyes\noj)en to the possibilities of there being conditions which we cannot\nappreciate, but which, if we could realise them, would throw light\non puzzling situations. Was it not William James who argued that\nthe universe was truthful, and that we were not always at the\nmercy of a monkeying subliminal ?\nMuch of what has been said above about historical \"Controls\"\napplies also to \" Controls \" who bear only symbolical names (e.g.\nPower), and do not mention any particular character for the life on\nearth. They may be regarded as having been associated with one\nor more persons who once lived on earth, unless some other explana-\ntion appears more likely, e.g. a secondary personality of the\nmedium. There have been instances, especially with planehette in\nChina, of \" Controls \" assuming the names of characters of fiction,\nbut I have never studied such cases. They might originate in\nsubliminal creation, or in personation hardly false, or even from\nprevious existences on earth if the character was taken from life\nby the author of the work of fiction. Perhaps some member who\nhas considered such \" Controls \" can contribute to the discussion.\nThe Chairman, the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas, Mr J. Hettinger,\nMr G. R. S. Mead, Mr W. H. Salter, the Rev. J. W. Hayes, Mr J\\\nW. Findlater, and Dr V. J. Woolley took part in the discussion.\nA PROPHECY IN OLD MOORE'S ALMANACK.\nA correspondent of the Sunday Times recently drew attention to-\na prophecy in Old Moore's Almanack 1\nfor 1931. This prophecy\nreads as follows :\n\" The Government will be hampered and the\nAutumn may witness a General Election, resulting in the return of\na Party with a strong working majority. Politically, Britain will\nget a Committee of National Progress, not an obsolete three-Party\nsystem of Government.\" This forms part of a general forecast for\n1\nThere are several Almanacks with this name. That here referred to is the\none published by Messrs W. Foulsham and Co., Ltd. The copy in the British\nMuseum was received on 14 August, 1930.\n\fJanuary 1932 A Prophecy in Old Moore's Almanack 183\n1931. More specifically, as part of the forecast for October 1931,\nappeared the following passage :\n\" The celestial aspects indicate a\npolitical crisis of the first magnitude, followed by a fall of the\nGovernment and a General Election in which a new National Party\nwill be returned. Foreign and Empire trade will be one of the main\nissues upon which the Election will be fought.*' The coincidence\nbetween the facts and the isolated extracts from the Almanack is\nclose ; and it accordingly seems worth while to inquire further\ninto the matter.\nAlthough these forecasts err in detail (e.g. foreign and Empire\ntrade was hardly one of the main issues of the Election), still, they\nare substantially accurate ; and it seems desirable, therefore, to\ninquire whether they were merely an isolated hit, or whether they\nform part of a series of successes.\nRestricting ourselves to similar political events during the past\nten years we find that Governments fell or took office in October\n1922, November 1923 (Parliament dissolved), January 1924,\nOctober 1924, November 1924, May 1929, June 1929. Not one of\nthese was forecast by Old Moore. On the other hand falls of\ngovernments, general elections or the formation of new governments\nwere forecast for March 1923, November 1923 (\" new Cabinet \"),\nMarch 1927, December 1927, January 1928, April 1929, July 1929,\nAugust 1929, October 1929, October 1930. In addition there\nare such ambiguous prophecies as (August 1922) :\n\" The Govern-\nment will be subjected to censure and strong criticism and the\nvoice of the people will prove effectual for good.\" It is remarkable\nthat none of these forecasts should have come off even by chance,\nespecially when ordinary political knowledge is assumed. Thus it\nwas known that the Conservative Ministry of 1924 would come to\nan end in 1929 ; Parliament was actually dissolved in May of that\nyear and the Labour Ministry took office in June. Old Moore made\nfour attempts, but unluckily plumped for April, July, August and\nOctober. It seems clear that the successful forecast for October\n1931 is an isolated hit. reasonably to be expected by chance alone,\nfor, while the forecast of a National Party stands alone, Old Moore\nforecast the victory of a Reform Party for March 1923 and of a\nCoalition Government for October 1930.\nLet us now see whether the forecast for October 1931 formed part\nof an accurate prevision of the situation as a whole. For November\n1931 Old Moore prophesied \" a month of great prosperity for Old\nEngland. Payment of foreign debts will be received, and internal\ntrade conditions will improve. The export trade will be satis-\nfactory. ...\" For Mr MacDonald Old Moore foresaw \" a serious\npolitical reversal which will be completed in November.\" Both of\nthese prophecies could hardly have been less accurate.

It was finally packed with special care, and I had pleasing\nmemories throughout the day of seeing the marbled pale colours of\nthe cheque and the look of the writing on it.\nI got home late that evening, and next morning when I looked\ninside the envelope, to my extreme surprise there was no cheque.\nCompletely puzzled I spent the morning looking through all my\npapers and into the lining of my trunk and into every imaginable\ncrevice. Finally in despair I decided it must somehow have slipped\nout of the envelope and I sadly wrote a letter to the lawyer to\nconfess my carelessness and to ask them to stop the cheque. My\nlawyer replied by return saying he had looked through their counter-\nfoils but could find no record of the cheque, and that he must\nsomehow have omitted to send it ; he made good the oversight\nwith apologies.\nMy memory of having seen the cheque in the first letter was so\nclear and persistent that it amounted, I think, to an hallucination.\nI find that even now I find it very hard to accept this statement,\nthough commonsense naturally assures me it must be true. This\ncase, I think (though it does not reflect on my powers of observation\nin at all a flattering way) is of interest to psychical researchers as\nevidence for the entire unreliability of memory under the strong\ninfluence of expectation. If cross-examined in a court of law I\nwould have said with complete and absolute conviction that I had\nseen and handled the cheque in the first letter, and yet, when\nanalysed, that sense of conviction rests on nothing stronger than\nan hallucination prompted by emotion and expectation.\nYours, etc.,\nIna Jephson.\n[Miss Jephson adds, in reply to a question, that there was nothing\nin her bag resembling a cheque. This hallucination gains in interest\nfrom the fact that in a recent experiment in the psychology of\ntestimony in the Society seance-room, Miss Jephson obtained\nhigher marks than any other sitter.\n\u2014\nEd.]\n\fJanuary 1932 Reviews 185\nEEVIEWS.\nSir Oliver Lodge, Past Years : an Autobiography, 8vo, pp. 364,\n16 portraits and ill.

The book, after describing his family\nhistory, his educational opportunities and difficulties, his struggles\nin early manhood to combine reading by himself for examinations\nwith earning a livelihood as assistant lecturer in various institutions,\nand settling him as Professor of Physics at Liverpool, goes on to his\nown scientific work which has brought him so much fame. A\ngreat deal of space is naturally occupied by this, and much of it\nwill probably be skipped, though popularly written, by readers\nwho are not physicists themselves, nor have followed the problems\nwhich are and have been occupying physicists of recent years. The\npart of the book most interesting to psychical researchers generally\nwill doubtless be the author's account of his own introduction to\npsychical research and the development of his interest in it. which\nwill be found chiefly in Chapters XXII. XXIII and XXIV. For\nthe effect on his own mental development in relation to it see\nChapter XXVIII.\nThe book is well illustrated, chiefly by portraits, and I especially\nrecommend readers not to overlook a photograph of Sir Oliver and\nLady Lodge and their twelve children opposite p. 256.\nE. M. S.\nCharles Kichet, L'Avenir et la Premonition. 8vo, pp. 248. Paris :\nEditions Montaigne [1931]. Price 12fr.\nIn this little work Professor Richet has set himself one main\ntask, that is to say to establish the fact that premonitions actually\noccur. He defines the term \" premonition \" as knowledge of the\nfuture by means other than the ordinary sensory channels, by\nintuitions which depend neither on perspicacity, reasoning or logic.\nThe larger part of the book is occupied in giving condensed reports\nof some 140 to 150 cases of premonition. Professor Richet disclaims\nany attempt at a methodical order of classification of his cases, in\nview of his main object in writing the book. He has arranged them\nin six groups : A, his own personal observations ;\nB, those of his\npersonal friends ;\nC, various observations (this is, of course, the\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1932\nlargest of the classes) ;\nD, monitions of approach, that is to say\n\" arrival \" cases ;\nE, premonitions in games of chance, races, etc. ~,\nF, warning cases. Of these class D contains cases which, as he\nrecognises, might strictly be classed as monitions rather than\npremonitions, but as the line dividing the two sorts of phenomena\nis so vague and the data for making a decision so sparse, arrival\ncases may and should fairly be studied in any work dealing with\npremonition.\nHe also distinguishes between premonitions and auto-premoni-\ntions, the latter being cases where the foreknowledge shown may\nhave been derived from a more intimate knowledge of the state\nof the seer's organism than is possessed by the normal supraliminal\nmind. Such cases would seem to be excluded by his definition.\nProfessor Richet claims that all cases which he cites are well\nevidenced, either by documents or the testimony of reputable\nwitnesses.\nIt seems an almost irresistible conclusion, in face of the mass of\nevidence adduced, that, if human testimony be capable of establish-\ning the truth of any statement of fact, knowledge of the future is\nsometimes acquired by certain persons. In his Preface he enumer-\nates these possible hypotheses to account for this knowledge. A,\nfraud and mal-observation ; B, chance ;\nC, an inexplicable lucidity\non the part of the seer. The first, he claims, is disallowed by the\ncharacter of the witnesses and the circumstances of the cases which\nhe has chosen for citation. The second, viz. chance, he discusses\nin detail in many cases, giving numerical estimates where possible,\nand he comes to the conclusion that, while chance could possibly\naccount for the facts, the probability against it is so large that the\nhypothesis may be excluded. There remains only the inexplicable\nlucidity.\nAs a collection of cases the book is wholly admirable, the accounts\nare brief but adequate, the style in which the whole is written\nrenders it easy and pleasing to read. It lacks that ponderosity and\ndulness which is so often found in works of this character.\nIn the fourth section Professor Richet gives some interesting\ndiscussions of various considerations connected with the subject,\nsuch as whether the phenomena found with professional mediums\nshould be studied, the practical inutility of premonitions, and so\non. He also replies to certain objections which have been raised.\nIt is only in the last section that any really controversial matter\nis to be found, that is to say, apart from the acceptance or rejection\nof supernormal knowledge of the future as actually existing.\nProfessor Richet arrives at several conclusions. He considers that\nthe future is, in the main, unknowable in spite of the existence of\nthe sporadic glimpses of it afforded by premonition. He considers\n\fJanuary 1932 Reviews 187\nthat premonition is not more mysterious and inexplicable than\nmonition, under which heading he would include telepathy, clair-\nvoyance and telaesthesia generally.\nHe states his opinion that the existence of premonition proves\nthat the future is completely determined, but while his remarks on\nthis point and on the connected matter of morals are of the greatest\ninterest, it is permissible to point out that, in strict logic, the\nexistence of occasional premonitions does not prove that all the\nfuture is determined ; the most it could be held to prove, even if the\nargument be valid, is that those particular events which were\nforeseen were predetermined. Because a very few isolated events\nhave been foreknown we cannot argue therefrom that all events\ncould have been foreknown, yet that is what must be shown in\norder to prove the complete determination of the future.\nIt may quite well be that only those events which actually are\npredetermined are the possible subjects of premonition and, while\none may dissent from the theory of complete determination of the\nfuture, few will be prepared to deny its partial determination.\nMoreover those somewhat rare \" warning \" cases where the premoni-\ntion has enabled the actors in the affair to avert the foreseen hap-\npening seem to give direct testimony against the determinist theory.\nProfessor Bichet has an evident repugnance for metaphysical\nspeculation, but it is unfortunately the case that any theoretical\ndiscussion of premonition is bound to land one into metaphysics.\nIn his Preface he says that this little book will probably be the last\nwhich he will publish. It is to be hoped that this, at any rate, will\nprove to be a false premonition and that Professor Bichet may long\ncontinue to enrich the literature of psychical research with the\nfruits of his wide knowledge and the outpourings of his graceful\npen. H. F. Saltmarsh.\nHarry Price, Regurgitation and the Duncan Mediumship. 8vo,\npp. 116, 41 ill. Bulletin of the National Laboratory of\nPsychical Research : London 1931. Price 5s. net.\nIn March 1931 Mr and Mrs Duncan came to London to fulfil a\ncontract with the London Spiritualist Alliance. Their contract\nwas to give to the Alliance a number of sittings for a fixed remuner-\nation and to hold no other sittings elsewhere.\nMr Price tells us that in April they approached him with an\noffer of one specimen sitting to be followed by others if desired.\nThis offer he gladly accepted and in the end he appears to have\nmade it worth while for them to allow at his Laboratory conditions\nwhich were far more rigid than any that had been allowed at the\nL.S.A. In particular he was allowed to take flashlight photographs\n\f18!S Journal of Society for Psychical Research January id32\nof the so-called teleplasm in all sorts of manifestations, and it is\nthese devastating photographs which constitute the main interest\nof his book. No unbiased reader who examines them will have\nthe slightest doubt that what the Duncans claimed to be supernormal\nsubstances were in fact materials of the most ordinary kinds. The\nsupposed teleplasm was cheesecloth. The same holes and crease-\nmarks appeared in the pictures evening after evening. The\nmaterialised hand was a housemaid's rubber glove. (It is much\ntoo clumsy for a surgeon, as Mr Price suggests.) In the original\nphotographs, which Mr Price kindly showed me some months ago,\nthere appear too an obvious safety pin and some kind of stiff\nstructure supporting the glove and cheesecloth, but these are\npractically indistinguishable in the published prints. This is the\nmore to be regretted since the photographs are by far the most\nimportant pieces of evidence here presented. The only non-\nphotographic material secured was a portion of alleged teleplasm\nremoved from the medium's mouth at the last sitting. This\nproved on analysis to consist of several layers of cheap paper stuck\ntogether with white of egg.\nThe nature of the \" teleplasm \", however, was only one half of\nthe problem. The other half was to determine how Mrs Duncan\nbrought it into the room, exhibited it, and got it out again. Here,\nunfortunately, the results obtained are far less satisfactory. Mr\nPrice is now quite sure that it is done by the materials being\nswallowed beforehand, brought up during the sitting, and re-\nswallowed at its close. On the evidence at our disposal it is the most\nprobable theory, and so long as we remember that Mrs Duncan was\nnever seen to swallow or regurgitate anything, nor was any foreign\nsubstance found in her pharynx, we shall do no harm by believing\nit until a better explanation can be found. It depends entirely on\nthe fact that Mr Price believes that he excluded every other possible\nmethod of concealment, and such a line of argument is a very\nunsafe one in discussing the modus operandi of any conjuring trick,\nas I think Mr Price would be the first to agree. It would however,\nbe unfair not to mention that among the photographs are included\ntwo control pictures showing the extraordinarily small bulk occupied\nby an enormous sheet of cheesecloth when closely rolled up, and\nthat the account given of the physical examination of the medium,\nin the search for concealed substances, is extremely complete and\nconvincing.\nFive sittings in all were held. After the fifth the photographs\nwere shown to Mr Duncan with the suggestion that Mrs Duncan\nshould allow a film to be made of the whole performance in return\nfor a fee of \u00a3100. The offer was not accepted and the Duncans soon\nafterwards left for Scotland.\n\fJanuary 1932 Reviews 189\nIn conclusion Mr Price asks the reader a number of questions\nregarding the Duncans' motives, and concludes \"it is all very\npuzzling \". I do not think the puzzle is very difficult. They went\nto Mr Price because they wanted to make some more money in\naddition to their payment from the L.S.A. and because they thought\nthat from their point of view Mr Price was on the side of the angels.\nUnfortunately for them they left out certain factors from their\ncalculation, possibly not knowing of their existence, and never\nknew of their mistake until Mr Price produced the photographs\nafter the fifth sitting.\nIn support of the regurgitation theory Mr Price has quoted a\nnumber of interesting cases, some illustrated, of professional\nentertainers who have earned a living by swallowing and returning\na varied assortment of objects, including living animals. He might\nhave said rather more of the people who do the same with their\nfood in private for their own enjoyment. Numbers of cases can be\nfound referred to in works of medicine under the heading of\nrumination or merycism. All these cases are of interest in this\nconnection as showing the comparative ease with which voluntary\ncontrol over the gastric and oesophageal muscles can be developed,\nand that it is quite unnecessary to suppose the existence of a double\nstomach or an oesophageal diverticulum.\nOn p. 27 Mr Price has made an unfortunate mistake in relating\nat second or third hand an incident at an L.S.A. sitting, where the\n\" teleplasm \" caught on the edge of Mrs Duncan's platform and\nshe believed it was being held or trodden on by a sitter. This\nrough edge was later planed smooth. The only other matter which\nseems open to criticism is the rather contradictory wording both of\nthe notes taken at the sitting and of the notes made afterwards.\nWith a disarming frankness Mr Price says. \" In the protocol it is\nstated that the teleplasm was '\nissuing from her mouth ', '\ncoming\nfrom her nostrils.' etc. This is a little misleading. Actually we\ndid not see it coming in a stream from the medium's facial orifices\nas the protocol suggests \". Then one can only say that the protocol\nshould not suggest it. The only use of a contemporary note is to\nstate precisely what occurs and what the sitters do see.\nOn the same page Mr Price in his own note (not the protocol)\nsays, \" The teleplasm . . . coiled itself and squirmed upon the\nfloor ;\nit entangled itself round the chair ... it shortened itself and\nlengthened itself ; it twisted itself up into a short, thick rope\nslightly damp and with an odour. Of course, all these transforma-\ntions were caused by the medium who was manipulating it.\" But\nin that case it did not coil itself or entangle itself. The medium\ncoiled it, and so on. and it seems only misleading to describe the\nprocess in any other way. In the present instance this method of\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1932\ndescription is not important because the misleading description is\ncorrected later by a qualifying clause. But supposing that the\nnarrator is describing phenomena which he comes to believe later\nto be genuine, and uses the same picturesque inaccuracy, he will\nthen not put in any qualifying clause and we shall get a most\nstartling description which may be quite inconsistent with fact.\nTo sum up, however, the photographs speak for themselves and\nthey teach us at least two things. First that the taking of flashlight\nphotographs of alleged mediumistic phenomena may be of the\ngreatest value in detecting fraud and so, by corollary, of establishing\nwhat is genuine, and second that the physical examination of a\nmedium cannot be considered complete unless we are able to know\nthat nothing is concealed in the stomach or oesophagus. Mr Price\nhas not so far suggested any practicable technique for such a control\nand neither can I. V. J. Woolley.\nEdmund Selous, Thought Transference (or What ?) in Birds. 8vo,\npp. xi. 255. London : Constable and Co., Ltd., 1931. Price\n7s. 6d. net.\nThis interesting book, by a well-known naturalist, seeks to find\nan explanation for the simultaneous concerted movements of\nflocks of birds. The author's argument is stated in the Preface as\nfollows :\n\" If birds, when together, act in the same way simultane-\nously, they must do so either in response to some extraneous event\nwhich affects them through the senses, as known to us, at one and\nthe same time, or because influenced in some other way than this,\nknown or unknown, or by coincidence merely \", and is illustrated\nby records of observations of bird behaviour from 1900 onwards,\nwith a running comment.\nCoincidence we may, with the author, dismiss offhand. Mr\nSelous's observations clearly negative any theory that the flocks\nact on the word of command of an \" avine drill-sergeant \" or that\nthe flock simply imitates the movements of one or two enterprising\nmembers. Sometimes a flock may be set in motion by a common\nstimulus perceptible to the observer, e.g. the report of a gun, but\nMr Selous points out that in creatures so inquisitive as birds not\nall sources of danger produce immediate flight, and that many of\nthe movements seem to result from pleasurable emotions rather\nthan fear. He suggests as an explanation some community of\nmental process between each member of the flock, akin to telepathy\nbetween human beings.\nHe has no doubt, from his reading of the evidence published by\nthe S.P.R., supplemented by his own investigations, of the existence\nof human telepathy, and suggests that, while in mankind this\nacuity is exceptional in its occurrence, in birds it is much more\n\fJanuary 1932 Reviews 191\nfrequent and \" more perfect in its application to the needs and acts\nof daily life \", normal in fact rather than supernormal.\nThe title of the book is not altogether happy, as what the author\npostulates is \" collective cerebration \" rather than the transference\nof thought from one bird to another. But before we can usefully\nspeak of \" collective cerebration \" in birds, it would be desirable to\ndefine what kind and degree of \" cerebration \" is to be attributed\nto the individual bird. May there, for instance, be stimuli such as\ncurrents of air, light or heat, not perceptible to even so experienced\n\u2022a human observer as Mr Selous, but producing motions on the part\nof birds, whether individually or collectively, without any precedent\nact equivalent to what we call \" thought \" in ourselves ?\nW.

In particular they have\ndecided to discontinue the salary paid to Dr Woolley's personal\nassistant, and the payment for the reviewing of foreign periodicals.\nThey have also been obliged to curtail the salary of the Assistant\nSecretary, but are very glad to be able to retain her services for\nhalf-time.\nThe Council greatly regret that Dr Woolley, who was not in\nagreement with some of these decisions, resigned from the Society\nimmediately after the decisions were made.

By the time of our next Annual General\nMeeting the Society, which was founded in February 1882 and is\nmuch the oldest Society formed for Psychical Research, will have\ncompleted fifty years of activity. During its fifty years of life the\nSociety has naturally encountered many obstacles, and the Council\nconsiders that its success in surmounting them has been due to the\nfact that it has resolutely pursued the policy and followed the\nmethods laid down by the founders.\nThe financial position. The Council regrets that a time when all\nmembers of the Society would naturally wish to congratulate them-\nselves on the Society having attained its jubilee, should coincide\nwith a period of unprecedented financial stress. It would, however,\nbe idle to disregard the fact that the most important feature of the\nyear 1931 has been the world-wide economic crisis. This has seri-\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1932\nously affected the position of the Society, as it has other Societies\nrelying on voluntary support, owing to the resignations of Members\nand Associates, who on account of financial stringency feel that they\ncan no longer continue their subscriptions. In the Council's opinion\nthe losses that the Society has sustained in this way are less severe,\nhaving regard to the losses sustained by other Societies, than might\nhave been expected, but they are none the less serious.\nThe Council in November appointed a special Committee to\nreview the financial situation of the Society and to make recom-\nmendations, and as the result has instituted certain changes which\nwill to some extent relieve the financial situation during the year\n1931.\nIt is possible that the Society might check, temporarily at least,\nthis decline in membership by adopting a policy at variance with\nthat which it has followed ever since its formation : if it were, for\ninstance, in regard to the question of survival, to which the Society\nhas devoted much work, to become a propagandist body, or if it\nwere to endeavour to attract publicity by sensational methods.\nBut the Council is not tempted even to contemplate a policy which,\nwhatever temporary increase of membership it might bring, would\nin the end damage the Society irretrievably. It recognises that there\nhas been a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the policy of the\nSociety ; but it proposes to adhere to its cautious and critical pro-\ncedure, as likely to attain the best results in the long run. The\nSociety is actively engaged in important, if not in sensational work,\nof a kind essential to the furtherance of psychical research, which\nno other Society is attempting to perform. The Council accordingly\nappeals with confidence to all Members and Associates to support\nthe Society to the utmost of their abilities during the present\neconomic crisis.\nSpontaneous Phenomena. Two houses, in East London and\nHampshire respectively, were visited by Mrs Brackenbury during\nthe year to investigate the origin of noises for which the inhabitants\ncould not account. In the Hampshire case the noises were found to\nbe produced normally by a young member of the family, while in\nthe other case nothing abnormal occurred during the visits of the\ninvestigators. Mr Besterman investigated a supposed case of\nhaunting in Yorkshire, and was able to explain it satisfactorily to\nthe persons concerned, who had invited him to look into it.\nResearch Work. During the year a number of visits were made to\nmediums by Dr Woolley and Mrs Brackenbury, and in addition a\nseries of sittings was carried out by them with a young and little\nknown medium who was brought to the Society's notice by a\nmember. These sittings, though on the whole disappointing, gave\nsome instances of probably supernormal knowledge.\n\fFebiu-aky 1932 Annual Report of the Council 197\nAmong the other mediums was Mrs Duncan, whose public sittings\nwere attended twice, while Mrs Brackenbury was also enabled to\nattend one of her private sittings by the courtesy of the Research\nCommittee of the London Spiritualist Alliance.\nExperiments were carried out with a view to testing the theory\nof the late Dr Kilner on the perception of a so-called aura by an\neye fatigued by a di-cyanin screen.\nExperiments in telepathy were carried out for some time by Mrs\nBrackenbury with a lady who is not a member of the Society, but\nthey were interrupted by the illness of the latter and have not yet\nbeen resumed.\nA large number of experiments has also been made by the Research\nDepartment on the manufacture, by normal means, of \" paraffin\ngloves \" similar to those produced in the course of the sittings of\nthe medium Kluski, and a further important series on the methods\nwhich may be used to make artificial reproductions of impressions\nand prints of human skin on such substances as dental wax.\nBesides this experimental work, the Society's records and docu-\nments relating to the unpublished poltergeist cases have been re-filed\nand classified so that they can be readily referred to for study and\ncomparison.\nAmong the cases examined was an account appearing in a daily\nnewspaper of the alleged success of a medium in detecting and\nsecuring the arrest of a lunatic responsible for the \" Whitechapel\nmurders \" of 1888. A prolonged investigation finally showed that\nthe article had appeared, almost word for word, in a Chicago news-\npaper of 1895, while no confirmation of the alleged incidents could\nbe obtained either from police officers who worked in Whitechapel\nat the time and were interviewed for the purpose, or from the\npresent staff at Scotland Yard.\nThe work with regard to telepathy and clairvoyance mentioned in\nthe Reports for the last few years is still being actively pursued, and\nas it proceeds it becomes increasingly evident that the proper under-\nstanding of these two subjects lies at the root of all other inquiry\ninto the mental phenomena of psychical research. The present\nstage of inquiry is of necessity to a large extent statistical, and on\nthat ground may appear to be uninteresting to those who are not\nmathematically minded, but it is difficult to see how any progress\ncan be made without it.\nTo come to details, Mr Soal has now completed his very careful\nand elaborate report on the experiments in telepathy at a distance\ncarried on under his supervision, and this report is now in the\nprinters' hands.\nMiss Jephson is continuing her researches in clairvoyance with\ncards. Parties for collecting data have very kindly been given by\nm2\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1932\nDr Broad in Cambridge, and by Miss Carruthers, and the Oxford\nS.P.R. has also contributed a large quantity of data. Points which\nmay prove of considerable interest have arisen and Miss Jephson is\ncontinuing the series with a view to verifying and throwing further\nlight on them.\nOwing to the special nature of the booktests which have been so\nprominent a feature of Mrs Leonard's mediumship, it is not possible\ndirectly to estimate their evidential value. This can only be done\nindirectly by means of control experiments, that is, by comparing\nthe results obtained by chance alone. Two series of experiments\non these lines, carried out during the year by Mr Besterman, showed\nthat the results obtained in true booktests were greatly superior to\nthose obtained by chance, even under the most favourable condi-\ntions. A report appears in Part 121 of Proceedings.\nDuring the year Mr Besterman has begun work on a careful\nanalysis of all available records of sittings with Mrs Leonard. The\nprincipal object of this investigation is to study comparatively the\ncharacteristics of different Communicators as manifested in the\nrecords. In addition to the records of the series of sittings held\nunder the Society's control in 1918, Mr Besterman is using for this\npurpose the records in the possession of Mrs Fernald, Lord Charles\nHope, the Rev. W. S. Irving, Mrs Salter, Mr Montgomery Smith,\nthe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas, Mr John F. Thomas, Miss Nea\nWalker, and others, amounting so far to the records of over six\nhundred sittings. The opportunity of using still further records\nwould be warmly welcomed.\nOn the invitation of our Hon. Associate, Dr Tanagras, President\nof the Hellenic Society for Psychical Research, experiments in long-\ndistance telepathy have been begun between a group in London\norganised by Mr Besterman and one in Athens. Dr Tanagras has\nbeen very active in the past in promoting experiments in long-\ndistance telepathy between Continental groups in different cities,\nand it is hoped that the present experiments will give useful results.\nIn last year's Report reference was made to preliminary work\nhaving been done with a view to a systematic study of the psycho-\nlogy of testimony as applied to paraphysical phenomena. Experi-\nments to further this work, which have been organised by Mr\nBesterman, have been carried out during the year in the Society's\nseance-room, and a report has now been completed. Several\npsychologists and others have expressed their sense of the import-\nance of these experiments.\nThe Council wishes to thank those Members and Associates who\nhave co-operated in the different kinds of work above mentioned.\nThe Library. The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust has now paid\nthe fourth and last annual instalment of the grant of \u00a31,000 to the\n\fFebruary 1932 Annual Report of the Council 199\nLibrary. With the aid of this grant the Library has been more than\ndoubled in extent and very greatly improved in value. The number\nof books and pamphlets in the Library now stands at about 7,100,\nan increase of 200 during the year.\nNinety Members borrowed 714 volumes, and in addition a con-\nsiderable number of volumes was consulted in the Library. These\nfigures show a slight decrease from last year, corresponding to the\nreduction in Membership, but they do not include the 104 volumes\nborrowed by the National Central Library, a considerable increase\nover last year. Members continued to a limited extent to exercise\ntheir privilege of borrowing from the National Central Library,\nthrough the Society, books not in the Society's Library.\nThe Society was again represented by Mr Besterman at the\nAnnual Conference (at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford) of the Associa-\ntion of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux, to which the\nSociety is affiliated.\nMyers Memorial Lecture. The Second Frederic W. H. Myers\nLecture, entitled \" Beneath the Threshold,\" was delivered by Dr\nT. W. Mitchell in the Conway Hall, London, on 24 June. Copies of\nthe Lecture are obtainable at the Rooms of the Society, price Is.\nThe Society's Presidents. Dr Walter Franklin Prince, the Research\nOfficer of the Boston S.P.R., honoured our Society by consenting to\nbe re-elected as President for the year 1931.\nProf. Hans Driesch, who was President of the Society in 1926-\n1927, and who is the recognised leader of psychical research in\nGermany, was elected a Vice-President of the Society.\nHon. Treasurership of the Society. Mr W. H. Salter, who had for\na long time been anxious to retire from the Hon. Treasurership of\nthe Society as soon as a successor was ready to take over the duties,\nretired in October and was succeeded in the post by Mr L. S.\nFletcher, who had shortly before that date been co-opted a member\nof Council. The Council congratulates itself on having secured Mr\nFletcher as an Hon. Officer of the Society.\nChanges in the Council. In addition to Mr L. S. Fletcher, Lord\nCharles Hope and Mr H. F. Saltmarsh have been co-opted as\nmembers of Council ; their names will be familiar to all Members and\nAssociates as active workers for several years in psychical research.\nObituary. During the past year the Society has lost by death\nseven Members and 15 Associates, one Corresponding Member and\none Hon. Associate, including the following, who by long member-\nship or otherwise have been valuable supporters of the Society :\nMr Edgar Baruch, Lady Battersea, Mrs Robert Bevan, Mr F.

The total resignations taking effect\nbetween January 1931 and January 1932 amount to 84 Members\nand 28 Associates. The majority of these are due solely to financial\nstringency, and many members resigning on this ground hope to\nrejoin later. In addition 12 Members and six Associates have been\nremoved for non-payment of subscription.\nThe new Members elected number 36, and also one Hon. Associate ;\nand one Associate became a Member. The total membership of the\nSociety is now, including, in addition to 18 Honorary and Cor-\nresponding Members and 10 Hon. Associates, 501 Members and\n308 Associates. As mentioned in last year's report it is inevitable\nthat the number of Associates should decline so long as the rule of\nnot electing new Associates is maintained.\nThe 1932 International Congress. During the year the Council\nmade various preliminary arrangements for the holding of the\nFifth International Congress in London in the autumn of 1932. in\naccordance with the decision of the Athens Congress of 1930. The\nserious economic position, however, which developed during the\nautumn made it necessary for the Council to inform the Inter-\nnational Committee that any arrangements made must for the time\nbeing be considered provisional. Since then the absence of any\nimprovement has compelled the Council with great regret to request\nthe International Committee to arrange for a postponement of the\nCongress. As the depression is world-wide, it is expected that the\nCouncil's request will meet with general approval abroad.\nMonthly Meetings. In the spring the Council decided that it\nwould be desirable that so far as possible the meetings of the Society\nshould be held at a fixed time on a fixed day, and that more oppor-\ntunity should be given to members to discuss the papers after they\nwere read. Meetings have accordingly been held at 5.30 p.m. (after\ntea at 4.45) on the last Wednesday in each month from May on-\nwards (except the holiday months), and have been well attended.\nThe papers have been followed by interesting discussions.\nIt is not intended to limit the papers read at these monthly meet-\nings to those offered for publication in full in Proceedings. When it\nis not intended to publish the paper in Proceedings, a summary of\nit, and of any interesting points raised in the discussion, is printed\nin the Journal.\nThe Council believes that these meetings are doing a useful work\nin keeping members in touch with each other and with the Society's\nwork.\nPublications. Five parts of Proceedings were published during the\nyear : Part 117 and 120 in February, Part 118 in April, Part 119\nin May, and Part 121 in July.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to\n\fFebruary 1932 Correspondence 205\n\u00a373 17s. lOd. (an increase of \u00a333 15s. 4d. on last year's sales), and\nof the Proceedings and Journal to members of the Society, to\n\u00a366 lis. 2d. ; the total returns from the Society's agent in America\namounted, after deduction of commission, to \u00a35 lis. 4d. The sale\nof the Transactions of the Athens Congress amounted to \u00a355 14s. 2d.\nMeetings. The following meetings have been held during the\nyear :\n26 Feb.

War-\ncollier, d propos of Professor Gardner Murphy's comments on them\nin Proceedings, xl. 102-3. M. Warcollier and Professor Murphy\nwere invited to reply to these criticisms ; their answers are printed\nbelow. The former's letter, a personal one addressed to Mr Soal,\nis printed by M. Warcollier's kind permission.\n\u2014\nEd.]\n... I unfortunately lack the time to reply to your letter as it\ndeserves. I have no objections to make. I quite agree with you :\nmy work is that of an amateur. Having occupied myself with\ntelepathy during the past twenty-five years only in my leisure\nhours, I have never been able to do really scientific work and I am\nfar from being satisfied. I have done what I could, but my work\nis not as positive as I could have wished, just as yours has been\nnegative against your inclinations. The important thing is that we\nhave both of us done something.\nUnfortunately the critical period we are about to encounter\n(from an economic point of view) has compelled me to suspend our\ntelepathic reunions. If one day I have the necessary time (and\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1932\nmuch is needed !) it is my intention to begin again on new lines, in\nparticular on those you suggest (prepared designs drawn at random,\netc.), and I would publish the statistics that you very properly ask\nfor. One table which would be very interesting would show the\npercentage of success obtained by each subject during the years of\nour experiments. It would show that the hits are obtained by only\na few subjects, whereas the coincidences due to chance are found\namong all the subjects ; this holds good for such a period of time as\na succession of months. Then these good subjects obtain no more\nsuccesses, but their imaginations continue to \" perceive \" images,\nwhich, although just as numerous or even more numerous, no longer\ncoincide with reality, whereas other percipients now obtain series of\nsuccesses. The same thing is observed in a single sitting : a success-\nful experiment is usually not isolated, two or three are obtained at\nthe same time.\nYou criticise above all \" mental contagion.\" You are quite right\n;\nbut allow me to remind you that I have not spoken of it for several\nyears, although the results continue to be remarkable. But the\nphenomenon is too complex to be explained at present. It may be\nthat it is largely due to a \" psychic parallelism,\" but I am inclined\nto think that this is itself favourable to telepathy. I know that I\nshall appear ridiculous in maintaining this position, but it is the\nduty of those who, like you and I, do pioneering work, to take risks.\nThere remains one point about which I disagree with you. For\nme success in telepathy does not consist in a servile copy of the\nobject transmitted, but rather in a translation, a schematic or\nsymbolic interpretation which, I know, greatly complicates the task\nof the mathematician. But, you will reply, there are cards, numbers,\netc. I can only repeat that in France such experiments are not liked.\nWe have not the earnestness of the Anglo-Saxon, and I could not\nhave maintained a group for ten years with such stodgy experi-\nments : they are perfect from the mathematical point of view, but\npsychologically impossible.\nAllow me to point out an omission in your \" cobra \" illustration.\nYou refer to the association of ideas with birds, islands, etc., but\nplease note that I first drew a serpent almost identical with the\noriginal and that I had a very clear and disagreeable impression of\na reptile. This does not prove that telepathy occurred, but you will\nagree that this detail is not unimportant.\nIt appears to me further that your argument from the calculus of\nprobability is not opposed to mine. Consider, for instance, a rifle-\nman of mediocre skill. His shots are very uncertain. He has six\nshots. The first is not badly placed, the second is a little better,\nthe third is a bull's eye, the fourth is very bad, the fifth a little less\nbad. the sixth fairly bad. This may be due, for instance, to the\n\fFebkuary 1932 Correspondence 207\nfact that the rifle is too heavy for him. It might be maintained that\nhis success was due to chance, but the rifleman himself would always\nquestion this.\nI remember having examined a beginner in qualitative analytical\nchemistry. I introduced a little silver solution into a test tube and\ngave it to him for analysis. When he handed me his observations\nI saw with surprise that he had described the silver, but with it half-\na-dozen other substances which were not in the tube. The number\nof substances that he knew how to describe not exceeding half-a-\ndozen, he would have had a good chance to hit on silver if he had\nobtained his results by chance, since he mentioned all the metals\nthat he knew. Questioned, the student explained that he had really\nobtained the reactions of silver, but that he had no doubt diluted\nthe contents of the test tube with ordinary water instead of distilled\nwater. In fact, the substances that he found at the same time as\nthe silver could well have been introduced by water from the tap,\nbut I could not enter into such considerations, as you will agree,\nand I ploughed the apprentice chemist. We are little telepathists\nwho dilute the messages we receive with the impure water of our\nimaginations. . . . [Translated.']\nR. Warcollier.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014The letter by Mr S. G. Soal in the October issue of the\nJournal strikes me as an especially lucid, thoughtful and dispas-\nsionate presentation of certain considerations which constantly\ndisturb us in psychical research, and perhaps above all in the study\nof telepathy. It is suggested that I should \" reply \" to this letter.\nIf by a \" reply \" is meant a \" rebuttal \" I would not reply if I could,\nand I could not if I would. I agree with a great deal that Mr Soal\nsays, and I think the questions which he raises are timely and well\nstated. It is true that he and I have read certain materials which\nimpress him one way and me another way, but it would take a great\ndeal of space to clear up the issue and would involve reproducing\nin the Journal a very large number of drawings and many pages of\nmaterial printed in French by M. Warcollier.\nFor in fact the case is the statement of an attitude towards a\nlarge mass of experimental material, none of which, as far as I can\nascertain, is available to the readers of the Proceedings and the\nJournal.1\nThis material, except for scattered fragments, has ap-\npeared in the Revue Metapsychique. To debate with Mr Soal\n1\n[An abstract of a paper read before the Society by M. Warcollier in 1928\nappears in the Journal, xxiv. 319-23.\n\u2014\nEd.]\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1932\nregarding this extensive material, so to speak, \" over the heads \" of\nthose who have not had time or opportunity to follow the original\nFrench publications month by month and year by year since 1921\nwould be discourteous both to the reader and to Mr Soal, and could\nnot possibly convince anyone.\nI am uncertain whether Mr Soal refers to this entire mass of\nmaterial or only to certain selected fragments ; and if the latter, to\nwhich ones he refers. Since it is not clear whether his comments\napply to certain samplings or to the entire material, an attempt to\nmeet him on his own ground would be fruitless. I do know, how-\never, the unfailing clarity with which Mr Soal has described, both\nin print and orally, his own experiments and his own opinions, and\nI feel that the very fact that his own experiments have yielded\nresults very different from those of M. Warcollier requires comment.\nThe delightful combination of courtesy and sincerity which Mr Soal\nshows would call for a reply in kind even if his argument were not\nin itself a compelling one.\nThe first question seems to me this : has M. Warcollier's pro-\ncedure led to results which are exactly like those produced by\n\" chance \" ? A priori, one might expect so. Yet the expectation\nis not confirmed. In fact, a very large mass of material has shown\nthat with ordinary persons under ordinary conditions, results like\nhis fail to appear. I refer, of course, to the Stanford investigations,\nto Troland's investigations, to the broadcast experiments in England,\nGermany and America, etc. Mr Soal assumes that negative results\nof the kind which he has himself obtained will be obtained nearly\nalways when one gathers together a few ordinary persons (that is,\npersons not especially sensitive to telepathic phenomena) ; on this\npoint I am not only in complete agreement with him, but would\nexpress my conviction with somewhat more positiveness than he\ncares to use. It seems to me quite clear from the work I have just\nmentioned, as well as from the great body of published telepathic\nwork ever since 1882, that genuine \" sensitives \" are exceptional.\nOn the other hand, the material collected in Phantasms of the Living\nand in the \" Census of Hallucinations \" and in the many other\nsurveys of apparitions and the like (such as those collected by Mrs\nSidgwick in 1922) indicate that the phenomena are of an order of\nrareness which is comparable, let us say, with that of automobile\naccidents, rather than of the order of rareness of lunar rainbows.\nOne would expect, nevertheless, that in a small group of twenty or\nthirty ordinary persons working for a year or two, the difference\nbetween the chance expectation and the actual results obtained with\nmost kinds of material would be slight.\nOn the other hand, from the same sources one would expect that\npersons who are sufficiently sensitive to get brilliant telepathic\n\fFebruary 1932 Correspondence 209'\nimpressions rather often, say a dozen times a year, are not very\nhard to find. During most of the years that I was actively engaged\nin telepathic work, it was my rule to give most of my time to the\nhunting of good \" subjects.\" I suppose I spent ten hours \" hunt-\ning \" in preparation for every hour of experimentation. During\nthe three years I succeeded in finding four individuals who seemed\nto be capable of fairly consistent telepathic work\u2014these selected\nfrom many hundreds who in turn were more or less selected from\nthe general population through special interest in psychic pheno-\nmena or through reports of unusual experiences.\nNow the difference between really getting results and merely\npersuading oneself that one gets results is in some ways a much\nmore definite task than Mr Soal explains. In the first place, a\nperson who is not sensitive usually goes for weeks or months with-\nout getting any results at all. It is easy to maintain a priori that\nsome successes will happen ; and yet, using the ordinary kinds of\nphenomena\u2014pictures, diagrams, and so forth\u2014such as War-\ncollier's group uses, I have seen subjects go through a whole winter\nof such experimentation without getting any clear results at all that\nwould even comfort their own minds or revive their flagging interest.\nAnd if I had not seen phenomena obtained by \" specially sensitive\n\"\npersons, I should probably long since have given up interest in the\nsubject, since during twenty years of intermittent experimentation\nand three of intensive work, I never personally got, as percipient,\nexperimental results of a kind which would attract attention or\nwhich could possibly be played up as positive\n' :\nsuccesses.\" Empiri-\ncally, then, I cannot grant that coincidence does the various wonder-\nful things which are accorded to it.\nIn the second place, there are ways of calculating coincidence\nwhich seems to me somewhat better than those which Mr Soal has\nin mind. In the broadcast experiment from Chicago, all the items\nused had been chosen for use by a roulette wheel so that this matter\nof \" parallel mental habits \" might not be invoked as an explanation\nof such successes as occurred. In this experiment the number of\nanimals listed among which the roulette wheel had to choose was\nthirty-five. The animal actually chosen by the wheel was a walrus.\nNot one single individual out of 2,500 got the walrus. Now shall we\nsay in the language of pure mathematics that there was one chance\nin thirty-five for each person to get the walrus ?\n1\nIf so, the attain-\nment of a zero score is supernormal to an amazing degree. Of course,\nthe point is that the d priori chances of getting a certain idea are not\nto be computed without reference to the details of the situation.\n1\n[This would be true (leaving preferences out of account) only if the per-\ncipients knew which 35 animals had been listed. Otherwise the chance of\ngetting a hit would only be one in the total number of all animals.\n\u2014\nEd.]\n\f2 1 0 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1932\nThere were, for example, three hundred lions reported. If the\nmachine had happened to choose a lion, this would have been a\nremarkably \" supernormal \" result. Now safety, of course, lies in\nlarge numbers of items. We calculated how many people actually\ngot each item right and then calculated how much chance there\nwould be of any person getting two items right, provided the \" hits\n\"\nwere accidents. Taking the material not in terms of a priori expecta-\ntion but in terms of the empirical fraction which showed how likely\na person was to get a particular idea, the empirical chances of getting\ntwo or more things right during the series was 6 (in 2,500) while the\nactual number of such cases was 5. This means simply that we\nprobably had enough material to permit the gross distortion intro-\nduced by the roulette wheel to be ironed out. I do not know\nwhether the London broadcast material could be subjected to the\nsame analysis, but I feel reasonably sure that exactly the same kind\nof results would be found, that is, that the vast majority of persons\nin any given experiment are non-psychic. (The present method is\ninapplicable to single \" hits,\" but with numbers and letters our\nresults were below chance.)\nAgain, let us return to Warcollier. Is it empirically true that\nmasses of coincidences of the sort which he has published do really\nappear in the process of combining results from different telepathic\nseries 1 Is it true that the results obtained in one series would\nmatch the materials used by the agents in another series just as\nwell as they match the material actually used in the given series ?\nIs it true that the same individuals who secure successes in some\nseries which are so far ahead of chance expectation fall behind in\nothers ? Both Warcollier's data and my own convince me that\nsuccesses are shared very unevenly, and that this unevenness main-\ntains itself from month to month and from year to year. If the\nreader will follow through the Warcollier experiments by the\ninitials of the percipients, it will be much easier for him to convince\nhimself of this than it would be for me to convince him by argument.\nThe longer the series is continued, the more definitely one can tell\nwhether the bunching of success in the work of particular percipients\nis a chance affair or not. This is one of many reasons why a case\nlike the present cannot be judged at all without considering the very\nlong period during which the study has been continued. Surely, if\nany of Warcollier's group are really sensitive, he is himself sensitive ;\nhe has been at work on the problem for over twenty years and has\npublished abundant material on his own results.\nI agree that it is frequently impossible to tell to what extent the\nselecting of favourable cases out of a large mass of material may\nsuggest telepathy when no such process is actually at work. My\nfeeling is simply that Warcollier's best published results remain un-\n\fFebruary 1932 Correspondence 211\naffected no matter how many thousands of experiments he has\ncarried out. In view of the fact that Warcollier's experiments are\nusually weekly, rather than daily, and that his publications are\nvohiminous, I cannot see that the selection factor can be as serious\nas Mr Soal implies ; but even if Warcollier had experimented daily\nor hourly for twenty-five years it would not affect the logic of the\nsituation. The much-quoted figure representing the likelihood of\nmonkeys typewriting copies of all the books in the British Museum\nseems to me comparable to the probability that Warcollier in a life-\ntime could get, by sheer coincidence, what he has gotten ;\nand\nwhether we give the monkeys a day or a million years, and allow\nthem one error per volume or a thousand errors, will not affect our\nattitude. I cannot make this belief appear reasonable to the reader\nunless, by expressing it, I can induce him to read Warcollier for\nhimself.\nMr Soal is, of course, absolutely right in protesting against the\nhabit of allowing the agents to choose their own material for\nexperimentation, especially if it is material noticed during the day.\nI think Warcollier agrees with this, and is trying as far as circum-\nstances allow to decrease this source of error. How much can be\nexplained by this fact I do not know. I can again only say that\nmy own group, though often falling into this very bad habit, did\nnot thereby get any such results as Warcollier has. In other words,\nI think it is a criticism with much & priori force but uncertain\nimportance. I doubt its relevance in the long-distance work. But\nI would certainly agree that since it is easy to eliminate this source\nof error, it should be eliminated.\nI was not aware of the fact that Warcollier completely failed\nwhile using numbers, playing cards, etc. I should be glad to have\na reference to such experiments.\nThe middle paragraph on page 133 puzzles me. \" If, however,\nthe American group thinks of a cobra and M. Warcollier has the\nimpression of, say, exotic birds and climbing plants, how easy to\nexplain this by saying that exotic birds were associated in the mind\nof the agent with the idea of a cobra.\" This is the only sentence in\nhis letter which is documented by a footnote, and since the point is\nconcrete, it calls for a concrete answer. The object chosen in this\nexperiment was a drawing of a cobra coiled (to strike) and with its\nhead to the right, thus forming a figure which at a distance of six\nor eight feet looked like a large capital S tilted to the right as if in\nitalics. M. Warcollier received on this occasion a figure like a capital\nS tilted to the right, and beside it he wrote, \" mouvement de\nreptile.\" It will be noted among the mass of material published by\nM. Warcollier that the tilted letter S is at least very rare (I have\nrun across no figure resembling the one obtained in this series), and\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1932\nthat although there is a fair assortment of animals, reptiles are un-\ncommon. To get both the approximate form and the right charac-\nterisation would then be a very different thing from getting simply\nthe idea of exotic birds and so on, to which Mr Soal refers. This is\nbut one case among hundreds, and it would be absurd to lay stress\nupon it ; but since this is the only case in which Mr Soal's critique\nhas been specific, I think it only fair to M. Warcollier to point out\nthat in this one specific criticism due attention was not paid to the\nactual results of the experiment. It raises, in fact, some question\nas to the possibility of demolishing M. Warcollier's case except by\na very prolonged and exacting inquiry.\nI am in entire agreement with Mr Soal as to the desirability of\nM. Warcollier's undertaking experiments under some of the con-\ntrolled conditions Mr Soal outlines. Warcollier fully realises the\ndesirability of this. In fact, during 1929 we planned out a con-\nsiderable number of such experiments. It is, however, a matter for\nthe experimenter to decide as to what is to be done at any given\ntime, and I am not entirely sure that the division of labour will not\nbe best served by having M. Warcollier following his own lines for\nthe present, while others like myself whose groups of percipients\nare less successful (not entirely unsuccessful) find a way to supply\nthe necessary control.\nI must repeat that this letter does not and cannot touch the main\npoint of Mr Soal's thesis. Whether M. Warcollier's results are\nsupernormal or not is a question to be decided only after reading\nextensively in his published work ; and the decision cannot at\npresent be stated in terms of the theory of probability, but only\nwith that kind of assent or negation which comes to us after any\nprolonged study of a complicated problem. I am certain that M.\nWarcollier shares my earnest hope that the more exact quantitative\nmethods can be successfully applied to types of material such as\nthose which he has published.\nBut since the discussion of M. Warcollier's experiments arose in\nconnection with my plea for a higher standard for papers to be read\nat the London Congress, I think it perhaps worth mentioning that\nthe great majority of Warcollier's hypotheses regarding telepathic\ninteraction are but slightly altered forms of hypotheses which go\nback to the work of Podmore, Gurney, Myers, Mrs Sidgwick, and\nother pioneers. Most of his remarks regarding half-conscious or\ntwilight states, regarding batteries of agents, regarding subliminal\nassociation, and so on, are to be found in literature which is classical\nif any of the literature of our subject deserves that name. If it be\ntrue that these hypotheses are unwarranted in relation to prolonged\nexperimental work with subjects in a normal state, I am not fully\nclear as to why they should repeatedly have been invoked in the\n\fFebruary 1932 Correspondence 213\nstudy of exceptional phenomena occurring in the case of medium-\nship. If it be true that real mediumship is exceedingly rare, but, if\nfound, exceedingly worth studying, and if hypotheses similar to\nthose of Warcollier have actually been evolved by the pioneers in\nour field in an attempt to explain mediumistic phenomena, it would\nseem to me at least possible that the testing of these hypotheses on\na large scale should be regarded as a major concern of the psychical\nresearcher. If I were aware of anyone else besides Warcollier who\nis doing this, I should be interested in making a comparative study\nregarding the degree of success which each is attaining. What I\npersonally hope will be accomplished by Warcollier's work is that\nin time there may be improvements in experimental and statistical\nmethod by which the mass of data collected by him may achieve\nthe quantitative significance which he and I would both grant it\nlacks at present. It does not seem to me, however, that^the failure\nof other experimenters to obtain results which are supernormal\nwhen using methods similar to those of M. Warcollier can be regarded\nas weighty, unless it can be established that the percipients used in\nthe two series of experiments are equally endowed.\nYours, etc.,\nGardner Murphy.\nZEITSCHRIFT FUR PARAPSYCHOLOGIE.\nSir, \u2014Your readers may perhaps be interested to learn what con-\nsequences my letter on Frau Silbert in the Journal for July 1931\nhas had. On 20 November 1931 the proprietor of the Zeitschriftfiir\nParapsychologie wrote to tell me that he had received a command\nfrom his readers to dismiss me from the post of Assistant Editor\nwhich I had held for six years, in order that future conflicts (Bester-\nman-Bozzano-Silbert) might be avoided. As the proprietor of the\nZeitschrift is dependent on extremely credulous readers, he was\nobliged to obey their command.\n[After referring to a parallel incident which has recently occurred\nin another country, Herr Lambert proceeds :] Thus the uncritical\nbelievers form everywhere, in Dr Siinner's touching words, a \" com-\nmunity of brothers in the faith,\" whose members, as he forgot to\nadd, protect each other from all criticism and who punish every\ndeparture from the dogma of the community by expulsion.\nAt bottom I am pleased at this solution, as I have for long been\nembarrassed to think that I might be regarded by the uninitiated\nas sharing the responsibility for the publication of the absolutely\nuncritical articles, which, notwithstanding my protests, were\naccepted in ever-increasing numbers. During the lifetime of\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1932\nSchrenck-Notzing, who ruled the Zeitschrift behind the scenes, it\nat least maintained a certain standard. Since his death it has fallen\nlower and lower and has published articles which even Schrenck-\nNotzing rejected as being valueless. It is owing to this lack of\ncritical spirit, to which Count Perovsky has so often referred in his\nNotes on Periodicals, and to the hostile and unfair attitude of the\nZeitschrift towards writers of great merit, that Professor Driesch's\nrecent withdrawal as an official collaborator in the Zeitschrift is due.\nThe only hope for scientific psychical research in Germany is that\nwhen the present unfortunate situation all over the world is im-\nproved it may at last be possible to establish a really scientific\nperiodical in which every serious investigator would be able to\nexpress his views, whether positive or negative.\nI congratulate you on working for a society which, since its\nfoundation, has made unprejudiced investigation in our difficult\nsubject its sole object.

Mrs Alfred Lyttleton\nin the Chair.\nMrs W. H. Salter read a paper entitled \" A History of George\nValiantine \", which it is hoped to publish in an early part of Pro-\nceedings.\nDuring the course of the discussion Dr V. J. Woolley agreed that\nin the type of sitting in which Valiantine sat at one end of the\ntrumpet with the sitter at the other end it was impossible for the\nsitter to keep his eyes on the medium's lips.\nMr E. J. Dingwall expressed his gratitude for Mrs Salter's paper,\nwith which he entirely agreed. In his opinion there was no evidence\nwhatever that Valiantine possessed any supernormal faculties.\nThe evidence for the medium's Chinese voices had been stated by\nProfessor Giles to be valueless. The knowledge of Chinese sounds\ncould have been easily acquired by the medium in America.\nMr G. P. S. Mead suggested that Chinese tones were very difficult\nto imitate.\nThe Chairman pointed out that this would not be the case if one\nhad had the opportunity of hearing them.\nMr A. W. Trethewy said that Valiantine's alleged Hindustani\nvoices were so blurred that they might have been anything.\nSupernormal Occurrences in Classical Antiquity.\nThe 111th Private Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\n27 January 1932, at 5.30 p.m., Mrs W. H. Salter in the Chair.\nProfessor E. R. Dodds read a paper entitled \" On the Evidence\nfor Supernormal Occurrences in Classical Antiquity \", which is\nprinted below, considerably abridged, and with omission of the\nreferences to sources.\nTo avoid disappointment, it is well to be clear at the outset as to\nthe sort of results which may be expected from such inquiries as the\npresent one. It is certainly hoping too much to suppose that the\nauthenticity of any phenomenon whose occurrence in the contem-\nporary world is disputed can in any substantial degree receive direct\nconfirmation from the records of past ages. It is safe to say that\nnot a single narrative which has come down to us from antiquity\nreaches the evidential standard that would justify its publication\nas a case in the Journal. This was of course recognised by Andrew\nLang, that remarkable polymath, who inaugurated the study of\ncomparative psychical research nearly forty years ago ; but what\n\fMarch 1932 Private Meetings 217\nimpressed him was the wide temporal and geographical distribution\nof the testimony to certain phenomena : for example, the ascription\nof levitation to the Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus in Syria,\nthe 17th century Italian St Joseph of Cupertino, and the 19th\ncentury medium Home in this country. The evidence, at least\nin the first two cases, cannot be called strong ; but why is the same\nsupernormal happening associated with these three quite uncon-\nnected persons ? It is difficult, as he pointed out, to explain such a\ndistribution on a diffusionist hypothesis.\nPersonally, I am not disposed to attach quite so much weight\nas Lang did to this type of argument. It is obvious that such\nuniformity of testimony may often be accounted for by the operation\nof a common psychological cause : for example, the alleged levita-\ntion both of Iamblichus and of St Joseph seems sufficiently explained\nby the idea, common to Neoplatonism and Catholicism, that the\nsouls of the devout strain upward toward their heavenly home (and\nhence may be expected in extreme cases to carry their bodies a\nlittle way with them). Nevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude\nthat comparative psychical research is concerned only with the\nhistory of opinion and can have no bearing upon questions of fact.\nI will venture to propound for your consideration two canons in\nthis connection. The first is a negative one, namely, that if a\nparticular supernormal phenomenon, alleged to occur spontaneously\namong civilised people in recent times, is not attested at other times\nand places of which we have adequate knowledge, the presumption\nis thereby increased that it does not occur as alleged, unless it can\nbe shown that its emergence is conditioned either by an actual\nevolutionary change or by a shift in the focus of curiosity, such as\nmight be produced by a new philosophical outlook. Thus if no\ncase of telepathy had ever been recorded before, say, 1850, consider-\nable doubt would be thrown on the reality of its occurrence since\nthat date, unless clear reason could be shown for its remaining so\nlong unnoticed. This canon must of course be used with great\ncaution, since it involves an argument from silence, the strength of\nwhich will vary widely with the nature of the phenomenon and the\ncharacter and amount of the general documentary evidence available\nfor any particular period and region.\nMy second canon is this : suppose a phenomenon X to be accepted\nas occurring in modern Europe under conditions ABC and only\nunder these ; if it be recorded as occurring at another time or place\nunder conditions BCD, then there is a presumption that neither the\npresence of A nor the absence of D is necessary to its occurrence.\nHere the partial identity of the conditions described in the past\nwith those under which the phenomenon is obtained to-day offers\nsome assurance that the earlier narrative is not a piece of free\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1932\ninvention ; and on this assumption the element of difference may\nin certain cases be highly instructive.\nI propose now to take some of the various types of supernormal\nphenomena alleged to occur at the present day, and to ask what\nanalogues are discoverable in Graeco-Roman literature. I shall\nbegin with occurrences which seem prima facie referable to tele-\npathy. The earliest spontaneous case known to me is the familiar\ntale of the two travellers from Cicero's dialogue on Divination.\nI know of no further instances of veridical phantasms of the dying\nuntil we reach that vast treasury of edifying ghost-stories, the\nDialogues of Pope Gregory the Great. Less sensational, and for that\nreason less suspect, are some of the examples of telepathy described\nby Augustine, who is a far better witness than Pope Gregory, and\nhas indeed some claim to be considered the first serious student of\npsychical research. Particularly interesting is a case of apparent\ntelepathic rapport between an hysterical patient and a priest who\nwas in the habit of visiting him. The priest's house was twelve\nmiles distant from the patient's, and the latter could always tell\nthe exact moment at which the priest was setting out to visit him,\nand would describe exactly all the stages of his journey. He\neventually recovered and his supernormal powers then disappeared.\nIt will be noticed that these instances of spontaneous telepathy\ncome from relatively late authors. If it be asked why no case of\nthe sort is recorded before the 1st century B.C., I think the answer\nis probably that until about that time no plausible theoretical\nexplanation of such cases was available. It was Cicero's teacher\nPoseidonius who first gave general currency to the philosophical\ndoctrine of sympathy, i.e. an underlying unity which was said to\nlink every fractional mind and every particle of matter in the\nuniverse with every other and with the whole. The earliest extant\nauthor to use this general doctrine as a means of explaining telepathy\nand other occult phenomena is Plotinus in the 3rd century a.d. ;\nbut there is some ground for thinking that the explanation goes\nback to Poseidonius himself. And once the theory was established,\nfacts which would otherwise have been passed over as mere curiosi-\nties of coincidence acquired a possible significance and thus began\nto be recorded.\nExperiment is in general a still later growth. There is indeed\none celebrated early story which might be claimed as the first\nsuccessful case of experimental telepathy. I refer to King Croesus'\ningenious test of asking six different oracles to tell his messenger\nwhat he, Croesus, far away in Sardis, was doing at a certain hour.\nThe messengers themselves did not know, but from the Delphic\noracle the King's emissary received the correct answer that he was\noccupied in boiling a lamb and a tortoise together in a copper\n\fMarch 1<J32 Private Meetings 219\ncauldron. In later antiquity, various oracles laid claim to telepathic\nor clairvoyant powers, and there were also private clairvoyants.\nOne feat in particular, the reading of sealed letters, gave rise to\nconsiderable controversy between believers and sceptics. Among\nprofessional clairvoyant mediums the one best known to us is\nAlbicerius of Carthage, of whose powers several instances are related\nin detail by Augustine.\nBelief in prevision was widespread at all periods, and the evidence\nis correspondingly abundant, though poor in quality. The philoso-\nphical difficulties which stand in the way of acceptance of this\npower to-day were not generally felt in antiquity Its reality was\nespecially championed by the Stoics, on a priori grounds. Scrying\n(usually by boy mediums, in a vessel of water or oil) was widely\npractised as a means of discovering the future ; this may be an\nimportation from the East. There is also one instance of the use of\na device analogous to the \" ouija-board \".\nPrevision and other manifestations of supernormal knowledge\nwere often alleged in association with possession. Like most early\npeoples, the Greeks attributed to the intrusion of an alien spirit not\nonly cases of multiple or alternating personality, but also such\nconditions as epilepsy, hysteria and many forms of mental and even\nof bodily disease\u2014despite occasional rationalist protests, from\nHippocrates to Plotinus. In the early period, so far as we know,\nthe invading personality was always assumed to be a god or\n\"daemon\". The orthodox Greek view was that the dead were\nsafely imprisoned in Hades. An exception was made for the unquiet\nghosts of those who had died untimely or by violence, or had failed\nof due burial. These are they who prowl in graveyards and haunt\nthe living. In the best-known ancient story of a local haunt, the\none in Pliny's Letters, the ghost was laid as soon as its bones were\ndiscovered and buried. It was the revolutionary theory of\nPoseidonius, that the dead dwell not in an underground Hades but\nin the air, that made spiritualism for the first time thinkable.\nTertullian tells us that in his day, while some possessing spirits\ncalled themselves gods, some professed to be the souls of deceased\ngladiators and others claimed to be the ghosts of relatives. We are\nnever told that they gave evidence of identity.\nFrom the notion of possession it is a short step to that of medium-\nship, the exploitation of which was until Roman imperial times\nmainly confined to certain oracles. At Delphi the prophetesses\nwere thrown into trance states in which Apollo was thought to\nspeak through them ; the method of inducing the trance was a\nsubject of dispute even in antiquity. Oracles of the dead existed\nat certain places, but we do not know whether these involved\nmediumship. Magical papyri give recipes for the induction of\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march 1932\ntrance ; but the best ancient descriptions of this state are found in\nIamblichus and Michael Psellus. Iamblichus says that the normal\nconsciousness is sometimes entirely suppressed, sometimes survives\nside by side with the intruding personality. Psellus says that\npossession may be recognised \" when the subject is deprived of all\nactivity . . . but is moved and guided by another spirit, which\nutters things outside the subject's knowledge and sometimes\npredicts future events\". Some of Porphyry's \" oracles \" seem to\nbe based on actual trance utterances.\nFor the occurrence of physical phenomena at sittings the chief\nwitness is Iamblichus. He appears to allege that luminous appari-\ntions may be expected, that levitation may occur, and that spirit-\nforms may sometimes be observed passing into and out of the\nmedium. Porphyry thought that these spirit-forms might be\nbuilt up by the psychic activity of the medium out of \" the material\nsupplied \" and especially out of \" matter taken from living bodies.\"\nThis comes near to a theory of ectoplasm. For telekinetic pheno-\nmena I can find no true parallel, just as I can discover no evidence\nthat poltergeists were active in antiquity. The nearest approxima-\ntion to either type of occurrence is perhaps in the stories told by\nJosephus and Philostratus of obsessing daemons who at the special\nrequest of the exorcist demonstrated that they had really left the\nbody of their victim by overturning previously specified objects in\nhis neighbourhood.\nOn the whole the resemblances between the phenomena described\nby the Neoplatonists and those recorded as occurring in the seance-\nroom to-day appear sufficiently numerous and striking to afford\nprima facie ground for the assumption that the facts underlying\nthe two sets of records are of the same order and referable to similar\nagencies. And in fact Iamblichus is often claimed as one of the\nmost important historical witnesses to the truth of spiritualism.\nThis seems to me rather odd. For with all the parallelisms I have\nenumerated there is associated one fundamental difference, viz.\nthat what the spiritualists attribute to the activity of a discarnate\nhuman mind the Neoplatonists attribute to gods or daemons. We\nhave, indeed, seen that in spontaneous cases of possession the\n\" Control \" sometimes gave itself out to be the soul of a deceased\nperson ; it is also true that deliberate evocation of the dead, though\nmuch rarer than the evocation of gods or daemons, was sometimes\nundertaken. But of evocation of the dead by means of a medium\nthere is little evidence. Iamblichus admits that the evil souls of\nthe earth-bound dead may occasionally intrude upon a seance, and\nhe is said once to have detected a soi-disant Apollo as being really\nthe ghost of a gladiator. But his spirit-forms and luminous\nphantoms are always those of gods or daemons ;\ngods and daemons\n\fMarch 1932 Private Meetings 221\nwere the objects of the invocations preserved in the papyri ; and the\nauthors of Porphyry's oracles, when they describe themselves at all,\ninvariably describe themselves as gods.\nSo far as I can see this circumstance puts the spiritualist in a\nsomewhat awkward dilemma. Is he to regard the Neoplatonist\nphenomena as genuine or fraudulent ? If they are fraudulent,\nobviously they do not help his case ; and the sceptic may invite\nhim to explain why in a society so abundantly equipped with\npotential mediums and ardent investigators as that of the 4th\ncentury a.d., the genuine spirits failed to make use of these admir-\nable opportunities. If, on the other hand, the phenomena are to\nbe accepted as genuine, he must decide whether they were produced\nby non-human spirits or by the dead masquerading as non-human\nspirits. If he adopts the latter hypothesis, the sceptic will wish\nhim to explain why the dead of antiquity entered into so widespread\na conspiracy to hide their identity and deceive the anxious inquirers.\nAnd if, finally, he accepts the agency of non-human spirits, a new\nproblem presents itself ; how shall he account for the cessation of\nthis agency to-day, and the substitution for it of an entirely different\nagency which nevertheless produces the same effects 1 Once he\nadmits the notion that any single seance phenomenon is or ever has\nbeen produced by a discarnate non-human agent, he is indeed lost ;\nfor since we know nothing at all of the nature or powers of such\nagents, there can be no theoretical difficulty, once their existence is\nadmitted, in attributing to them the whole range of phenomena\nassociated with modern spiritism. Moreover, the Neoplatonic\n(and Catholic) \" daemonist \" hypothesis is, by its very vagueness,\nfar less open to a priori criticism than is the spiritualist. The\na priori objections to a belief in the continued activity of the dead\nare in the judgement of many modern persons, myself included,\nvery strong objections indeed ; but these considerations do not\napply to the activity of beings who have never experienced death.\nIt would seem, therefore, that the spiritualist should think twice\nbefore he calls the Neoplatonists as witnesses for the defence.\nAs for the sceptic, a comparison of ancient daemonism with modern\nspiritism will probably suggest to him the conclusion that in periods\nof religious decay men will invoke the aid of magic to support by\nocular evidence whatever article of a crumbling creed is nearest to\ntheir heart's desire and least capable of defence upon philosophical\ngrounds.\nA discussion followed, in which the Chairman, Mrs Carpenter,\nMr G. R. S. Mead, Mrs Kingsley, Mr G. W. Lambert, the Rev.\nW. S. Irving, Mr J. Hettinger, Lady Barrett, and Mr Besterman\ntook part.\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1932\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nIS PROOF OF SURVIVAL POSSIBLE ?\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014After reading Mr Saltmarsh's interesting paper under the\nabove title (Proceedings, xl. 105 ff.) it struck me that instead of\nattributing a number of theoretical potentialities to normal tele-\npathic action in a general way, it would have been more fruitful to\nhave analysed and compared some of the most cogent specific\nexamples of evidence for survival and test them with this touch-\nstone.\nAn example of such test-proof evidence to my mind, if we agree\n(as Mr Saltmarsh appears implicitly not to agree) that latency is\nhardly likely to endure for six months, is the Bowyer-Bower case\n(Proceedings, xxxiii. 167). Captain Bower's apparition was seen\nnot only at the time of his sudden violent death, but also six months\nlater (by his mother and again by his fiancee). The details of\ndevelopment and behaviour are strikingly suggestive of the operation\nof an external intelligence. Accepting the facts as truthfully\nreported the experience is surely utterly incongruent with any\nknown case of spontaneous unveridical hallucination experienced\nby a person in either good or ill health, and there is no room for\nexpectation as an explanation.\nAfter studying the subject carefully I find that the evidence for\nexpectation as a contributory cause of hallucination is extremely\nmeagre : hallucination, i.e. as distinct from illusion. Most of the\ncases reported are illusory, 1\nthe result of an observed natural\nphysical movement (e.g. a door opening) or of natural sounds.\nWhere a phantasm of an expected friend is seen, we cannot be sure\nthat it is not a spontaneously produced phantasm of the living\nperson, and the cases reported are rare. In the famous Merton\ncase the apparition was never seen when expected ; Mrs Leonard\nnever had her experience of \" leaving the body \" when she desired\nit : communications on expected themes and from expected sources\nare the exception at trance sittings. I myself, subject to hypnagogic\nhallucinations, never have them when I think of them and await\nthem. The mental tension of expectation seems thus to be fatal\nto psychic experience of certain kinds and is probably the cause of\nfailure in telepathic experiments. In successful series of experi-\nments confidence (as distinct from hope or expectation) has probably\n1\nMiss Jephson's phantasmal cheque {Journal, xxvii. 184) was probably\nillusory rather than hallucinatory ; i.e. \" built upon \" some shadow in the\nenvelope she looked into.

There is clearly an element\nof doubt or irritation in expectation ;\nsufficiently \" ruffling \" may\nwe not suppose to disturb the \" currents \" ? Were a medium to\nexpect trie trance to supervene rather than to be confident or im-\npassive about it, failure would probably result. At a sitting with\nMrs Brittain, which she had inconvenienced herself to give me, she\ncommented distressfully several times on the delay of the trance.\nWhile we were engaged in conversation which interested her she\nsuddenly said \" Ah, that's better !\n\" and \" went off\".\nYours, etc.,\nErnest S. Thomas.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014-Mr Saltmarsh {Proceedings, xl. 105 ff.) puts forward many\ninteresting theories and hypotheses which may or may not negative\nthe proof of survival. It would, I think, be of interest to many if\nhe would give his opinion on, and a solution to, the following case\nreported in Light for 26 May 1928, p. 244 :\n\"... Mrs Dowden was the means of obtaining an important fact\nthat nobody living knew, and it was subsequently verified. This\ncase was connected with a legal dispute, so an assumed name must\nbe given.\n\" About a hundred years ago a man died whom I will call Arthur\nGraham, but the year of his death was not known, nor his burial-\nplace. The whole law case hinged on the date of his death. It was\nessential that his tomb should be found ... the police failed to\ntrace it.\n\" One interested in the matter came to Mrs Dowden with a\nletter that had been written about a hundred years previously by a\nwoman related to Arthur Graham. The writer of the letter pur-\nported to communicate through Mrs Dowden and stated that the\ntomb of Arthur Graham was in a churchyard that had no church\nstanding m it in a certain district in London, the name of which\nwas given. Mrs Dowden was not acquainted with this part of\nLondon. The sitter doubted this information, but went in search\nof the grave as directed, and found that the information given was\ncorrect. He discovered the tomb of Arthur Graham, exactly as\ndescribed m the sitting, and the information was used in the law\ncase though its source could not be revealed.\"\nIt is, of course, easy to postulate that Mrs Dowden or the sitter\nmight on some occasion which had escaped their recollection have\nvisited the churchyard in question and there seen the tomb as\nsubsequently described. Mrs Dowden is, however, quite convinced\ntnat she has not, at any time, visited the said churchyard. She\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1932\nhas a horror of them and always avoids them. Neither is she\nfamiliar with the district indicated. The sitter was quite positive,\nat the time, that the information given was incorrect and that\nno churchyard without a church existed in that part of London.\nIt seems unlikely, therefore, that he could have conveyed the\nrequired information to Mrs Dowden as the result of a forgotten\nvisit though, of course, this possibility must be taken into con-\nsideration.\nUnconscious telepathy from some person unknown would hardly\ncover the case. For this would necessitate someone vaguely\nwandering through the churchyard who, consciously or uncon-\nsciously, noted the name and date on a certain tombstone yet was\nunaware of the search for the burial-place. But allowing for this\nit seems hardly credible that the information required could have\nbeen conveyed by some person unknown to Mrs Dowden just at\nthe moment when she was searching the Ouija Board for the\nnecessary details.\nThe case mentioned above would seem to dispose of the theory\nof latent telepathy. Nothing whatsoever was known to those\nconcerned as to the locality of the grave of \" Arthur Graham \" and\nthe information given through Mrs Dowden related to events of\none hundred years ago. Moreover, the hypothetical communicator\nexpressed much diffidence in alluding to her association with\n\" Arthur Graham\". She stated that she feared the scandal which\nwas current in her lifetime in connection with the matter. It might\nbe possible, however, to postulate some form of hereditary telepathy\nas an explanation.\nYours, etc.,\nE. B.

As to the\nidentities of \" Imperator \" and others, and their inconsistencies, if\nyou ring up Harrods, the reply will be \" Harrods speaking \" : ask\nfor detail and you will learn \"Groceries\", and (by a disregard of\nrules) further enquiry might disclose the speaker's name.

Balliere et Fils, 1927-1930.\nIn these two volumes and in a third not yet published the author\nsets out to give a complete account, theoretical and practical, of\nthe science of \" metapsychics \", anglice, psychical research. He\nopens his first volume, after some introductory remarks, with a\ndiscussion on the vocabulary of the subject and a suggested glossary.\nFor some of his proposals he will find difficulty in winning accep-\ntance in this country. For example, Myers's definition of telepathy\nas \" the communication of impressions of any kind from one mind\nto another independently of the recognised channels of sense \" is\ngenerally accepted amongst English-speaking writers. Dr Bret\nwishes to limit its application to a particular class of phenomena\ntypified by apparitions of the dying. Telepathic impressions in\ngeneral he would describe as \" telegnosie \" or \" metagnosie \" ; a\ntelepathic link between two persons is a \" metadesme \".\nDr Bret is open to the general criticism that he overestimates his\nreaders' powers of assimilating new words ; a list of some two\nhundred technical terms, including such unfamiliar combinations\nof sound as \" endometaplasmie \" (transfiguration), \" ichnognosie\n\"\n(psychometry), \" metallactobare \" (supernormal changes of weight),\n\" metaphtongue \" (supernormal sounds), \" metarsisme \" (levita-\ntion), may give rise to needless confusion and alarm ! It is probably\na drawback to any science to be too heavily encumbered with\n\" jargon \" ; it must certainly be a drawback in psychical research,\nwhich derives much of its material from ordinary men and women\nand should strive therefore, so far as possible, to be intelligible to\nthem.\n\f\u2022226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1932\nDr Bret's general classification and theoretical discussion of\nphenomena is based upon his first main division of the field into\n\" metagnosie \", supernormal perception, and \"metergie\", super-\nnormal action. This implies that mental phenomena will be\ndifferently classified according as we assign the responsibility for\nthem to an agent or a percipient ; for example, telepathy, in Dr\nBret's limited sense, is classified under \" metergy \", as a form of\nsupernormal agency.\nThe philosophic theory upon which Dr Bret bases his survey\nmay be summed up as follows :\n(1) Individual man consists of two\nelements, a normal or natural element, and a metapsychic or\nmetetheric element, linked to the natural element in some unknown\nway, and by its interaction with it, frequent in mediums, rare in\nothers, causing every kind of supernormal phenomenon. (2) The\nmetapsychic element of our individuality existed before the natural\nelement and will continue to exist after it. (3) Force and matter\nare two forms of the same thing. The difference between a super-\nnormal mental image and an ectoplasmic materialisation is one of\ndegree only.\nTo survival of death and communication with the dead as\nspiritualists and some others understand these terms, Dr Bret will\nhave little to say, although he admits that certain \" metapsychic\nremnants \" may prolong their post-mortem activity for a time.\nIf, as some will think, Dr Bret is too ready to cut the knot of\ncertain psychical problems which do not happen to fit his theory,\nas witness his references to Mrs Piper (i. 138, ii. 163), he may seem\non the other hand too favourable to the claims of such phenomena\nas he feels himself able to explain, that is, the whole range of super-\nnormal physical phenomena, including spirit-photography and\nfull-form materialisations : he instances the pithecanthropus\nalleged to have been observed at a sitting with Kluski, and speaks\nwell of Eglington (sic) and Mirabelli. The tendency to theorise\non insufficiently established data has always been a danger in\npsychical research.\nBut even those to whom many of Dr Bret's conclusions are\nunacceptable, may find much to interest them in these two, mainly\ntheoretical, volumes ; the third volume, still unpublished, which is\nto contain a detailed examination of observed phenomena, is likely\nto be the most interesting to psychical research.\nH. de G.

The phenomena appear to have consisted exclusively of\nrappings (barring a rather doubtful case of \" direct \" writing).\nProfessor Ludwig describes a very striking case of an apparition\nof a person recently deceased from the reminiscences of Don Bosco,\nthe founder of the Salesian order (died in 1888, beatified by the\nRoman Catholic Church in 1929). The apparition was of a very\nunusual nature, was, it seems, perceived by many persons, and bore,\nfrom the religious standpoint, a thoroughly orthodox character,\nRuigi Comollo's voice repeating three times the words :\n\" Bosco,\nBosco, Bosco, I am saved !\n\" Prof. Ludwig thinks it however worth\nwhile to discuss at some length (and to discard) the hypothesis of a\npractical joke.\nThe Baroness Margit Veszi-Mantica narrates a case of spon-\ntaneous phenomena (heavy blows) occurring at Dunavarsany\n(Hungary) in 1908. Dr Lipschitz insists on the necessity of \" tele-\nplasmic nebulae \" being submitted to spectral analysis ! He is good\nenough to admit incidentally that such an experiment may well\nsucceed but once in a hundred years (p. 345). Herr Wratnik\nnarrates a case of a fire of an \" occult \" nature occurring in the\npresence of Hilda Zwieselbauer, for which fire he unhesitatingly\nmakes an evil (unseen) entity, by the name of Joscht, responsible.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsijehologie, August 1931.\nAs was to be expected, Stanislawa P., who was thoroughly\nexposed at the Institut Metapsychique last year, has found defenders.\nIn the present number of the Zeitschrift Dr Schwab undertakes to\nshow that she has genuine mediumistic power : an old story which\nwe have witnessed ad nauseam since modern spiritualism began.\nHerr Hans Schubert describes some thoroughly non-evidential\nseances held in a castle reputed to be haunted. Herr Giinther-\nSchwerin discusses Spuk and materialisation. Reference is made\nto a curious hypothesis put forward by a Professor Danmar according\nto which ghosts avail themselves when manifesting in places where\nthere is no living medium of a particular substance accumulated\nthere called by Danmar medialum.

No\nattempts at duplicating \" mediumistic \" phenomena were made,\nbut some of Herr Fischer's statements appear to have been interest-\ning, e.g. when a propos of Eleonora Zugun, he accused of collusion\na lady closely connected with Eleonora. He also stated that the\n\" phenomena \" of Kordon-Veri are due to collusion.\nZeitschrift fit r Parapsyehologie, September 1931.\nDr Mattiesen prints the first instalment of a paper whose purpose\nis to put forward a new and hitherto, he thinks, a neglected argument\nin favour of the spiritistic hypothesis : the experiences of those who\nhave felt themselves \"out of the body\". Altogether 42 cases are\nquoted, of which several were published in our Proceedings.\nProfessor Blacher discusses the \" Principles of paraphysical\nresearch \". His standpoint is, as we know, ultra-positive. In\npassing he informs us in a footnote that he views Mr Besterman\nwith intense indignation !\nHerr Kiinhaupt, of Berlin, narrates at secondhand an interesting\ninstance of what may have been a collective visual hallucination,\nthough it is difficult to feel quite certain that the supposed ghost\nmay not have been a real person after all.\nHerr Haslinger has a few lines on the \" front \" which, he thinks,\nis forming itself in various countries against the \" negativism \" of a\ncertain group in the S.P.B.

On two photographs we see the medium\n\" levitating \" in this way a small object (hands held on both sides\nof the object of course).\nFrom Herr Josef Sell's paper on \" Parapsychological emanation\nand infra-red rays \" it appears that the medium 0.

Dr Zenker\nnarrates various \" spontaneous \" incidents savouring of Spuh out\nof his own and other people's experiences.

Dr Mattiesen brings to a close his paper\nbegun in the September number. An extract is quoted at the end\nfrom a letter of Professor Hans Driesch's who says that to him too it\nseems beyond doubt that such \" excursions \" support very strongly\nthe spiritistic theory. Our late President seems however to have\na slight doubt as to the reality of the alleged facts.\n\" Superrealism and Parapsychology \" is the subject of a paper\nby Dr Servadio.

Arthur Ford. Dr Bruck\nseems fully convinced that Mr Ford possesses truly telepathic and\nclairvoyant (or rather clairaudient) powers, as to which opinions\nwill widely differ.\nDr Simsa, a Prague physician, describes some sittings for physical\nphenomena of an extraordinary kind held recently at Prague-\nBranik, with a \" medium \" named Wolf, aged 25. The \" pheno-\nmena \" had been of a spontaneous character at first (stone-throw-\nings, etc.). Dr Simsa admits that the control used at his sittings\n\" was not sufficient for strictly scientific purposes \", and that \" our\nexperiments were not meant for all sceptics \"\n(p. 532). These\nexperiments are to be continued.\nDr Gerda Walther has a paper (first instalment) on spontaneous\nphysical phenomena in England, dealing chiefly with observations\nof the late Mr and Mrs MacKenzie, of the British College for Psychic\nScience.\nIn Kleine Mitteilungen we are informed of the decease at Niirn-\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1932\nberg, at the age of 60, of Dr Joseph Bohm, whom the Editor styles\n\" a pioneer in the sphere of parapsychology \". Prof. Blacher informs\nus that his sittings with the medium Mine Ideler have been pro-\nvisionally interrupted owing to the \" incompetent, unkollegial and\nespecially inopportune intervention \" of a Herr E.

The article should be read in conjunction with a note by\nDr Schroder entitled \" Occultism and Conjuring \" and printed in\nthe October number of the Zeitschrift fur metapsychische Forschung.\nFrom it it follows that Herr Ottokar Fischer, a Vienna conjurer,\nhas expressed himself in a manner quite unfavourable to the\ngenuineness of these performances, though this circumstance has\nof course failed to convince Dr Schroder, by whom the Kordon-Veri\ncard \"phenomena\" were filmed, it appears. The discussion is\nlikely to go on.\nDr Simsa brings to a close (provisionally) his paper on the Prague-\nBranik sittings and physical \" phenomena \". A curious\u2014if\nsinister and unfortunate\u2014feature of the latter was the wholesale\nkilling of some sixty chickens and ducklings, which killing Dr Simsa\n\" much suspects \" to have been of \" occult origin \" !

Fletcher, presented his financial\nstatement with the remark that it was not a very cheerful occasion\nfor any one to take on the Hon. Treasurership. The Society had\nbeen suffering from the economic strain, like other similar Societies,\nparticularly those dependent on voluntary subscriptions. He\nreferred to the Special Committee appointed towards the end of\n1931 to advise as to what should be done to make both ends meet,\nand to the economies which had been carried out in consequence.\nOne of the largest items of expenditure was the printing bill, and the\nCouncil had very reluctantly decided that it would be necessary to\nmake a cut of \u00a330 under this head. He was glad, however, to be\nable to announce that he had received from an anonymous source\nan offer of a contribution of the amount of the cut.\nMr Fletcher also referred to the Jubilee celebrations which it was\nproposed to hold in the course of the year. Some expenditure\nwould be necessary on these celebrations, and he had received from\nthe same source a promise of \u00a320 towards the extra cost which the\nSociety would incur in regard thereto. He hoped he would not be\ngoing beyond the functions of an Hon. Treasurer in saying that\nperhaps other members would like to follow this example.\nA discussion followed in which the following Members took part\n:\nDr E. J. Dingwall, Mr L. S.

Associate of the Society\nand President of the Hellenic Society for Psychical Research, has\nbeen conducting experiments in long-distance telepathy between\na group in Athens and groups in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, and other\nplaces. In 1931 he was good enough to invite me to co-operate\nwith him in such an experiment between his group and one to be\nformed in London, an invitation I was of course very glad to accept.\nThe two groups met at the same time, allowing for the difference\nin longitude. One group then attempted for five minutes to\ntransmit an object telepathically to the other group, the process\nbeing repeated after an interval of five minutes. Two objects\nhaving been transmitted in this way the group now acted as per-\ncipient, two objects being transmitted in the same way by the other\ngroup. The objects chosen for transmission and the impressions\nreceived were recorded in duplicate by each group, one copy being\nput in the post to the other group as soon as possible after each\nsitting. In the present experiment each of the objects available for\ntransmission was numbered, and a set of corresponding numbers\nwas chosen from at random, the number being then replaced, so that\nthe whole series was available each time.\nIn these experiments conducted by Dr Tanagras there had\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psycltical Research Apbil1932\nhitherto been no limit to the range of objects chosen for transmission.\nThis method is open to various objections, amongst them the\ndifficulty of evaluating the results. On the other hand, I was\nanxious to avoid going to the other extreme and using numbers or\nplaying-cards. I therefore suggested, as providing a means of\nmaking the results susceptible to statistical evaluation without\nlosing the emotional element, that twenty subjects of quasi-universal\nappeal be chosen and that one of these twenty be transmitted each\ntime by each group. To this Dr Tanagras agreed, and I therefore\nput together a set of postcards representing the following subjects :\nthe Crucifixion, the Virgin and Child, the Prince of Wales, Julius\nCaesar, Napoleon, Nefert-iti, a mummy, an elephant, a horse, snakes,\na butterfly, the Houses of Parliament (London), St Paul's Cathedral,\nan aeroplane, a railway engine and train, a steamer, a plate, a vase,\nand a chair, together, for control purposes, with a blank card. A\nduplicate set was sent to Dr Tanagras. Some of the cards were in\ncolours, with a view to testing their relative efficacy in the event of\na successful experiment.\nEach group sat twelve times, between 5 November 1931 and\n11 February 1932. The London group consisted of thirteen sitters\nand the Athens group of twenty-five sitters, a total of thirty-eight.\nThe members of the London group put in 93 attendances and those\nof the Athens group 118 attendances, a total of 211. The number\nof guesses recorded was 226 by the London group and 448 by the\nAthens group (the members of which usually made several attempts\nfor each object), a total of 674 guesses. The probability of obtaining\na hit by chance alone being one in twenty, the successes obtained by\nthe London group should have numbered 11.3, by the Athens group\n22.4, or 33.7 in all. The actual hits obtained, on the most liberal\nestimate, were respectively 12, 17, and 29.\nThus the experiment unfortunately failed to produce any direct\nevidence of telepathy, and an analysis for deferred impressions was\nequally unsuccessful. Th. B.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nMethods in Experimental Telepathy.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir. \u2014The courteous remarks of M. Warcollier which appeared in\nthe February number of the Journal and Prof. Gardner Murphy's\nvery interesting contribution to the same issue, call for some reply\nfrom me. I will first deal with M. Warcollier's letter. The choice of\nthe \" cobra \" illustration I admit was an unfortunate one, though\nwhen I picked it out I was perfectly aware that the percipient had,\n\fApril 1932 Correspondence 237\nin addition to getting an impression of exotic birds and climbing\nplants, actually sensed a reptile. The example was not intended as\na specific case for criticism but was merely cited as an illustration of\nthe kind of thing I had in mind when I said that capital letters, etc.,\ndo \" not permit of the experimenters claiming equivocal successes\non the score that an associated idea has emerged in the mind of the\npercipient.\"\nI still maintain, however, that when one experiments with '\"\nfree\n\"\nmaterial a very wide connotation can be given to the word \" success.\"\nFor instance, on 28 March 1926 one of Warcollier's agents con-\ncentrated on a picture of one of H. G. Wells's Martians showing a\npair of big eyes in an enormous head, and a bunch of tentacles\n(Revue Metapsychique [1927], p. 359). The percipient draws a\nfountain with four jets and thinks of a diver. M. Warcollier inter-\nprets the four jets of the fountain as a successful attempt at the\ntentacles, and remarks that there is an extraordinary resemblance\nbetween the head of the Martian and the head of a diver in his\nhelmet. But is this really good enough ? Personally it leaves me\nunconvinced. If for instance the percipient had drawn an onion\nwith its roots hanging down I should have been much more im-\npressed. I have recently been looking through all Warcollier's\npublished sketches and I do not think I have found a single pair of\ndrawings of which I could say with any conviction, \" Here is a\ncoincidence so exact in its numerous details that it is absolutely\nbeyond chance.\" At most I have been able to say, \" This is\nsuggestive,\" or \" This is interesting.\"\nI do not quite see the point of M. Warcollier's illustration of the\nman firing at a target. If, for example, it was true that in a long\nseries one tires, so that the first two or three shots were much better\nthan the rest, a statistical series would, if carried out for a sufficient\nnumber of days, infallibly demonstrate the superiority of the early\nshots. What the marksman himself thinks as the result of a single\ntrial is of no importance.\nI am quite ready to agree with Prof. Murphy that Warcollier's\nexperiments are voluminous, but I can scarcely admit that the\npublished successes are voluminous. Let us take, for instance, one\nof M. Warcollier's longest reports, that of the work of his group in\nthe year 1925 (see Institut Metapsychique, Les Conferences en 1926,\npp. 36-51). Including four successes which are described in the\nRevue Metapsychique (1927) ,\npp. 359, 362 and 369, and the American\nexperiments for 1925, we have in all about 36 published successes\nfor the year 1925. There may, of course, have been others, but\nthese are all that M. Warcollier has thought fit to describe. These\nsuccesses are shared among at least nine percipients. It is true,\nhowever, as Prof. Murphy states, that one or two of the percipients\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1932\n(in this case M. Warcollier himself and M. Du.) seem to get an undue\nshare of the successes. But what the true interpretation of this fact\nmay be I am not clear. It might conceivably be explained on the\nsupposition that these two percipients were more active than the\nrest of the group and managed to put in a bigger average of experi-\nments per evening. It might even be because they attended the\nweekly sittings more regidarly than the others. M. Warcollier\nsimply does not provide us with the information we require in\norder to form a conclusion. In this report, as in many others, we\nare not even told who was present on any particular evening. We\nare not told the number of experiments done by each person. For\nthe most part we are not even given the exact times at which the\nagents concentrated on their objects or the intervals between the\nrecording of the successful impression and the time at which the\nagent concentrated.\nAgain, my own statistical experiments with large groups have\ndefinitely convinced me that in guessing at free material percipients\nwho on an average make 3-4 shots per experiment do at the end of\n20 or 25 experiments score an appreciably larger number of successful\nhits than those who average only 1-2 shots per experiment. In my\nexperiments with the Warcollier group a single person would some-\ntimes record as many as five distinct drawings in his attempts to\nguess the object shown. These are factors which have to be taken\ninto account before one can decide that the uneven distribution\nof Warcollier's successes is due to superior telepathic power on the\npart of certain percipients.\nProf. Murphy has asked for references to experiments in which\nWarcollier's percipients have failed with playing-cards, numbers,\ncapital letters, etc. There are references to experiments with\nplaying-cards in Warcollier's book La Telepathic Experimental\n(1921). Though M. Warcollier appears to think that some of these\nexperiments or card games were successful, on the evidence pre-\nsented I can only conclude that they were probably negative. For\ninstance, on p. 174, he mentions an experiment with playing-cards\nin which the chance of success was 1 in 13. In a series of 260 trials\nhe tells us that 24 successes were obtained, which he interprets as\na positive deviation of 20% from the chance expectation (20).\nBut this positive deviation (4) is even less than the standard\ndeviation (4.3) and can signify absolutely nothing. It is true that\nM. Warcollier goes on to say that he has alivays obtained a positive\ndeviation with this game, but what is the precise meaning to be\nattached here to the terms \" always \" ? It is of course normally\nan even chance whether the deviation from the expected number is\npositive or negative, and no one ought to be excessively surprised\nif a run of five or six positive deviations should occur from time to\n\fjVpril 1932 Correspondence 239\ntime. For instance, if one does the game five times the chance\nexpectation that all five trials will give positive deviations is 1 in 2 5\nor 1 in 32, for six games 1 in 26\n. and so on.\nA series of seven or eight experiments with letters of the alphabet\ncarried out at a distance of some hundred miles, in which M. de\nSainville was agent and M. Warcollier the percipient, is described\nin the Institut's Conferences en 1928. pp. 298-302. Not one of these\neight letters was guessed correctly, though it is to be noted that a\nconsiderable number of partial successes are claimed with free\nmaterial in this same series.\nAs regards experiments with numbers I do not find very many\nin M. Warcollier's published work, but a certain number of experi-\nments with three-figure numbers were undertaken by Warcollier's\npercipients in connection with my own group, though without\nsuccess.\nProf. Murphy seems to be begging the question when in the\n\u2022concluding paragraph of his letter he says that he does not think\n\" that the failure of other experimenters to obtain results which\nare supernormal when using methods similar to those of M. War-\ncollier can be regarded as weighty unless it can be established that\nthe percipients used in the two series of experiments are equally\nendowed.\" If, for instance, I were to estimate the endowment of\nWarcollier's percipients on the basis of their two years' work with my\nown group I should be compelled to conclude that this endowment\nwas very slight indeed. If on the other hand I were to judge the\nendowment of my own group of 600 by the letters in which they\nrecorded their previous spontaneous experiences, I should be\ntempted to believe that at least a hundred of them constituted the\npsychic cream of the country.\nIn Les Conferences en 1926, p. 37, M. Warcollier tells us how he\nformed his group. He made an appeal to a selected public of about\n500 persons in the year 1922. From these 500 he obtained 50\naccounts of supernormal experiences. Twenty of these fifty persons\nagreed to take part in regular experiments.\nNow all this seems very remarkable when compared with my own\nexperience. Through a broadcast appeal I obtained not 20 but\n350 cases of people who claimed to have had supernormal experiences\nand who agreed to take part in regular experiments. Yet it seems\nthat with eighteen times as many \" psychics\n\"'\nI was unable to find\na single one who was really able to convince me in the subsequent\ntests that he or she possessed genuine telepathic powers. But out\nof a small group of twenty Warcollier seems to have been able to\nfind at least six or seven genuine percipients ! Frankly. I am\nsceptical, and the absence of any real control experiments and of\nadequate accounts of experimental details makes me search for the\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1932\nsecret of Warcollier's coincidences in other possible factors than\nthe operation of telepathy. Of M. Warcollier's honesty of purpose\nand sincerity there can be no question, and no one who has had the\nprivilege of knowing him personally could ever doubt it. Nor do\nI think it possible for anyone to prove that the best individual\ncoincidences that he cites are not examples of telepathy. At the\nsame time I believe that the factor of selection of favourable cases-\nis far more important than Prof. Murphy believes it to be. My own\nwork has convinced me that with free material if one goes on long-\nenough one does now and then note a remarkable success and\noccasionally an impression is recorded by some percipient, which,\nwhile it does not fit the actual objects gazed on by the agents, would\nyet count as a notable success if it had only been recorded a fortnight\nearlier or a fortnight later. And is it really necessary to possess the\nunlimited time and untiring energy of typewriting monkeys in\norder to pile up the few hundred coincidences that M. Warcollier\nhas recorded in his published work since 1921 ? I cannot help\nthinking that Prof. Murphy has rather exaggerated the actual\namount of success obtained by Warcollier.\nBut I freely admit that the case puzzles me. I feel that if I\ncould have been present at a few of the actual meetings of this\ngroup and studied the exact procedure I could soon make up my\nmind as to the part played by coincidence, psychic parallelism,\nmultiple guesses, verbal amplification of impressions after drawings\nhave been compared (if this ever happens), etc. But under the\ncircumstances, while agreeing with Prof. Murphy that Warcollier\nhas a real case that cannot be demolished offhand, however much his\nmethods of presenting his reports may be criticised, I feel unable\nto come to any definite conclusion.\nProf. Murphy raises one other interesting point with regard to\nhis own method of calculating coincidences (p. 210). In the case\nwhere a number of different objects are used in succession, even if\nthey differ from one another as much as teapots and lions, is it\nreally safe to assume that the operations of guessing at two classes\nof objects in succession are independent events ? Let us assume\nfor example that the percipients are told that the first object is one\nof ten animals whose names are given and that the second object is\none of ten flowers whose names are also given. In order to find a\nchance expectation of a percipient getting both objects right I doubt\nvery much if it would be correct merely to find the empirical pro-\nbabilities of each separately and combine them by multiplication.\nFor by doing so one is assuming that a person who thinks of a lion\nsay for his first guess is as likely to guess any particular one of the\nten flowers as a person whose first guess was a sheep. Now it may\neasily be that those who guess lions will tend to choose as their\n\fApril 1932 Correspondence\nsecond guess a yellow flower and those who guess sheep a white\nflower. Hence serious errors might arise\u2014especially with large\nnumbers of percipients\u2014if one merely multiplied the empirical\nprobability factors obtained from each experiment separately. And\nthis may be true to a greater or less degree of all classes of objects.\nIn the B.B.C. experiment for instance, there were two playing-\ncards thought of by the agents. The first card resulted in about\n56% of red guesses while in the second experiment the percentage\nof red guesses fell to 53%. This fluctuation in the popularity of\nred is far too great to be a mere chance variation. The first card\nshown was actually a black card and the second a red one. and here\nit would lead to serious error if one said that the probable number\nof people who ought to get the colour of both cards correct is\nN x -44 x -53, where N is the number of percipients (supposed the\nsame in both experiments).\nYours, etc.,\n8. Gr. SOAL.\nIs Proof of Survival Possible ?\nTo the Editor o\/ The Journal.\nSir, \u2014May I trespass on your space to reply briefly to the points\nraised in the two interesting letters appearing in your last issue ?\nMr Thomas thinks that it would have been more fruitful to have\nanalysed concrete cases. I agree : in fact. I intended to do so but\nfound that any adequate analysis would have expanded the paper to\nan inordinate length.\nThe question of the limit to be assigned to the duration of latency\nis a peculiarly difficult one : we have so little data to go upon. If\nthe deferred impression be a centrally originated hallucination,\nthen exteriorisation of a subconscious memory might account for it\nand latency might extend almost indefinitely. If, on the other hand,\nthe hallucination is provoked by some external cause, it is difficult\nto see how it comes to be deferred at all. Does the provoking cause\nremain in operation until it produces its effect\u2014does it, as it were,\ncontinue knocking at the door until it is opened 1 Or if the effect\non the recipient be produced immediately and passage from the\nsubliminal to the supraliminal be deferred, where, if not in the\nsubconscious memory, is the impressed stored ? This seems to me\nto be another example of the difficulty which is so often encountered\nin psychical research of estimating the probability of various\nalternatives, and confirms me in the opinion that acceptance\nof any hypothesis is. in most cases, governed by individual idio-\nsyncrasy.\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1932\nConcerning expectation as a contributory cause of hallucination.\nI agree that by itself expectation may prove a hindrance rather\nthan a help, but if the subject be in a highly suggestible state I\nthink that vivid expectation may provoke hallucination indirectly\nby means of auto-suggestion.\nMiss Gibbes is good enough to ask my opinion on a case reported\nin Light. I agree that it is extremely unlikely that Mrs Dowden\nshould have preserved a subconscious knowledge of the location\nof the tomb derived from unconscious observation on the spot. It\nis, of course, possible that the sitter might have possessed the\nknowledge normally and forgotten that he had done so. There\nis, however, no evidence to show that this was the case, and it is a\nperfectly gratuitous supposition.\nI think also that unconscious telepathy from some unknown\nperson is, though theoretically possible, extremely unlikely, as the\nrequisite linkage is so very complex and indirect. The hypothesis\nof clairvoyance seems even less acceptable : we can hardly suppose\nthat Mrs Dowden would clairvoyantly search all the graveyards in\nLondon for a particular tomb.\nPresumably the writer of the letter handed to Mrs Dowden was\naware at some time during her lifetime of the place where Arthur\nGraham was buried, though there is no information on this point.\nHowever, assuming this, the supposition would be that, by means\nof the letter, the mind of the medium made contact with the surviv-\ning consciousness of the writer and derived the information there-\nfrom. The part played by the letter is very mysterious. Personally\nI cannot accept as plausible the theory that an inanimate object\nsends out an emanation or radiation which gives information con-\ncerning persons who owned, handled or otherwise were connected\nwith it in the past. If one postulates radiation some account must\nbe given of its nature. Are the rays a stream of particles ? If so\nwhat are these particles ? Or are they waves, and if so in what\nmedium and of what wavelength ? And anyhow, how can an\nemanation or radiation convey information except by means of a\ncode of symbols, such as Morse ? And finally, can we suppose that\nthis activity can continue for a hundred years as in this case ? I\nsuggested in my report on the Warren Elliott sittings a possible\nexplanation based on a modification of the temporal conditions\ngoverning the subconscious mind of the medium. I must leave it\nto others to judge whether it is plausible and, if so, whether it is\napplicable to this case ;\npersonally I am inclined to think that the\nhundred years involved stretched the theory almost too far.\nAs the result of these considerations I am disposed to the opinion\nthat this case, if the evidence is otherwise satisfactory, which, as I\ngather from the Editor's note, appears somewhat doubtful, gives\n\fApril 11)32 Correspondence 243\nconsiderable support to the spiritistic hypothesis. There are\nalternatives but, to my mind, they are less plausible, though others\nmay assess the probabilities differently. Yours, etc.,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nREVIEWS.\nFrederick H.

Price $4.\nIn his early days Mr Haines was a rationalist ; in middle life he\nwent to church, but without enthusiasm ; then he became interested\nin spiritualism, had good sittings with several well-known London\nmediums, developed automatic writing and trance, and reached\nfull conviction that he received messages from his son who was\nkilled in the war, also from friends and from high spirits who lived\non earth long ago. The investigations were begun in a spirit of\nscepticism, and were conducted carefully ; Mr Haines took a\nstenographer, and had full notes taken ; he was careful not to give\naway information, and he studied the records in critical fashion,\nwishful only to get at the truth. The results seem to contain much\nthat was supernormal, and some of them can hardly be accounted\nfor by telepathy from the sitter.\nIn the exercise of his own psychic powers, a prominent feature\nwas the finding of lost objects by the help of impressions or auto-\nmatic writing ; and one at least of these seems to go beyond sub-\nliminal perception and memory, being apparently a case of true\nclairvoyance if we are to avoid the supposition of help from dis-\ncarnate minds. As to the communicators who are of remote time,\nthere can be no evidence of identity and the reader can form his\nown opinion ;\nthey and their teachings are of the Vale Owen kind,\nand edification rather than evidence is their aim. The book is\nclearly an honest record ; the writer is a retired business man and\nwould not claim that his book is a literary production of high order\n\u2014there are many slips in grammar and the like\u2014but he does give\nthe impression of having tried to give an exact account of his\nexperiences. And his interpretation of those experiences is reason-\nable enough. It is to be noted that he is aware of the various\nalternative hypotheses, and he maintains a critical attitude, not\nonly to the sceptical explanations but also to some of the activities-\nof spiritualism. The book has value as a psychological study of a\nmedium's mind from within.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1932\nMr Snipes's book is of the same character, but is more discursive\nand less evidential. The author has visited many mediums, and\nhe and his wife developed psychic powers. The evidence, such as\nit is, is not given in scientific fashion, and large areas of the book\nare occupied with ostensible communications from Henry Ward\nBeecher. Horace Greeley, Thomas Paine, and other famous people :\nthere is much repetition, and the matter is mainly of a sermonising\nbut unimpressive character. Mr Snipes says he has seen table\nlevitations without contact, and received what seemed to him\nevidential slate-writing with Slade ; but the accounts are casual\nand chatty, not full notes made at the time.

Price 3s. 6d. net.\nThe etherie theory of the survival of human personality is so\nwidely held that a book giving fully and clearly what that theory\nimplies is sure to be of interest to our members. In 1924 Mr\nFindlay, a member of our Society, published a small book containing\na summary of his experiences with the Glasgow medium, John C.\nSloan, with an introduction by Sir William Barrett : the present\nbook contains a much fuller report of Mr Findlay's sittings with\nthat medium. A large part of the book is devoted to explanations\ngiven through the medium of the etherie theory of survival and of\nthe modus operandi of communication, together with comments by\nMr Findlay in which he claims that this theory is in harmony with\nrecent discoveries in physics. Mr Findlay himself emphasizes the\nfact that the theories of the physicists are continually changing,\nand it is to be hoped that the physicists will not be so inconsiderate\nas to produce new theories which will not harmonise with mediumis-\ntic explanations. This part of the book, although of considerable\ninterest, can hardly be considered evidential.\nIn chapters VII, VIII and IX, however, Mr Findlay gives an\naccount of several incidents which he claims as not only super-\nnormal, but as incapable of explanation by any hypothesis except\nthat of survival. Unfortunately, however, the cases are not\nreported in conformity with the standards followed by our Society.\nFor instance, the striking case of \" Eric Saunders \" (the first of the\nevidential cases quoted by Mr Findlay) suffers from the fact that\nwe are not given firsthand statements from Mr Findlay's brother,\nto whom the communication was given, nor from the man through\nwhom the correctness of the communication was subsequently\nverified.

It\ncould only be attempted as the result of a lifetime of study devoted\nto the subject. This M. de Vesme has given it. and the progress of\nthe work will be watched with sympathetic interest.\nThe French title of the book is Histoire du Spiritualisme experi-\nmental, and the first volume appeared in 1928. The two volumes\nbefore us are a translation of about two-thirds of the first French\nvolume. It will thus be seen that, when completed, the work will\nbe on a very large scale, and it should occupy an important place in\nthe literature of psychical research. In a note to the English\nedition the author explains that he is using \" Spiritualism \" in its\nmost extended sense, and that \" experimental \" is to be given a\nwider meaning than it usually bears in English, and should be taken\nas including the results of observation as well as experiment.\nThe principal thesis of the first volume is that belief in spirits,\nand religious ideas generally, did not originate, as supposed by\nanthropologists, in the misinterpretation of natural (i.e.\n'*\nnormal \")\nphenomena, but that they are based on the observation of super-\nnormal phenomena, and on correct inferences drawn therefrom.\nThis interesting hypothesis is supported by a wealth of instances,\nthe Journal and Proceedings of the S.P.R. being quoted with\ngratifying frequency, and by ingenious arguments. Unfortunately\nnot all the authorities quoted are of the highest standing.\nIn the second volume M. de Vesme modestly disclaims any\nattempt to produce an \" erudite book, and it would of course have\nbeen impossible to explain in detail the beliefs of persons belonging to\nso many civilisations, from Egypt to Peru, without making the book\nunwieldy. M. de Vesme is however to be congratulated on having\nin both volumes covered so much ground, and on having brought\ntogether so much material of interest to the student of our subject.\nThe translation of the second volume leaves a good deal to be\ndesired, and there are numerous mistakes in names and in classical\nwords : e.g. the Egyptologist \" Flinders,\"' Epiphanus, Naupakton,\nneknia (several times), Serapeums. An important passage of the\nOdyssey (xi. 219-222) is translated (p. 138) in such a way as to be\nbarely recognisable. It is to be hoped that blemishes of this kind\nwill be avoided in the translations of the rest of the work, for the\nsuccessful completion of which we offer M. de Vesme our best\nwishes. W. H.

This man, as most\npersons interested in psychic research know, attained a very high\nreputation for his extraordinary performances which had the appear-\nance of telepathy, when they were not supposed to be of the nature\nof messages from the dead, a theory which he sometimes encouraged.\nMost readers will remember the testimonies of more or less prominent\npeople on the continent of Europe and elsewhere regarding him, and\nI need not refer to these. I myself was told, before I saw him,\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1932\nstories of his marvellous achievements, by at least twenty persons of\ngeneral good sense, including successful merchants and lawyers, and\neven a judge of a high court. As these persons told the story, there\nwas no possible way to explain the feats performed, according to any\nnormal process. More than one man said to me, when I ventured to\nexpress the possibility of doubt, \" Then I must be either a liar or a\nfool. I am telling you what I saw with my own eyes \". But, as the\nlate Dr Morton Prince and I, shortly before his death, with the rela-\ntion in turn of amusing examples, agreed, the eyes are, in certain\nsituations, very uncertain and deceptive instruments.\nEvery one of these witnesses substantially stated as follows, before\nproceeding to further detail :\n\" He told me what was on folded slips\nof paper before he ever touched them \". If that were so ; that is to\nsay, if the slips remained folded and were not touched by Reese, and\nyet he was able to tell what was upon them or to make perfectly\nrelevant replies to what was on them, there seems to be no escape\nfrom the conclusion that what he did was of supernormal\ncharacter.\nI am making, of course, no new revelation. Several persons have\ngiven more or less of an account of the way that Reese accomplished\nhis successes, a way capable of a number of variations. But it may\nbe of interest, nevertheless, for me to tell how he did it when he gave\nme a sitting. I do not, of course, make any point-blank denial that\nReese ever had any telepathic results, and I say nothing of those\ncases where his procedure was different than it was with me, although\nI doubt that any variation of his procedure was less tricky than the\none in my case. I wrote out my report, which has never been pub-\nlished, almost immediately after Reese had gone. That report re-\nmains in the files of the Society which I was then serving, so that I\ncannot tell the exact date, but it was a year or two before Reese's\ndeath. What I am to say is very clear in my memory. I shall show\nthe high probability that every one of the men who told me their\nstories and who had witnessed a similar procedure (and it was almost\nprecisely similar in most cases), when he said, \" He answered what\nwas on my folded slips before he ever touched them \", although of\nundoubted honesty, was mistaken. I shall show also the very psy-\nchological groove, so to speak, down which he slipped into error.\nHaving heard so many stories with their categorical affirmations,\nI was naturally anxious to meet Reese. A mutual friend, who had\nseen him perform many times and who believed in him thoroughly,\nwas also anxious that I should meet him. He used his influence with\nReese, who one day unexpectedly appeared at my office, and told\nme that he was willing to demonstrate at that time.\nI was seated at a roll-top desk in a well- lighted room, and rather\nexpected that he would sit down by me there, but he wandered into\n\fMay 1932 A Sitting with Bert Reese 251\nan adjoining room and suggested that instead we sit at a table in\nthat room. He did not wish to sit on the same side of a piece of\nfurniture with me, as he would be compelled to do at the desk, for so\nlocated he could not perform his manipulations unperceived.\nAs I readily assented, he asked for a sheet of paper and was given\nit. He proceeded, apparently, to tear this piece of paper into five\nfragments of about the same size. Although on the look-out, I did\nnot see him conceal any fragment, but directly after the sitting was\nover and he had gone, I did what so many failed to do : fitted the\nfive pieces together, and. as I expected, found that another was\nneeded to make up the entire sheet. A piece having been ab-\nstracted and concealed must, logically, be intended to play an im-\nportant part in what was to follow.\nReese asked me to write some question or sentiment on the pieces\nof paper, directed to five persons, \" the most of them passed on \",\nand to address the persons by name. He instructed me then to fold\nthe slips separately several times.\nWe went into the room containing the table, and he asked if two\nladies present could also sit, and I assented. Thereupon I sat at the\nright extremity of the long side of the table, Reese directly opposite\nme, and the two ladies, whom we will designate as Miss L. and Miss\nM., at the end between us.\nIt should be here stated that Reese, at that time a very old man\nbut with all his uncanny cleverness undiminished, had a curious\nvoice and a curious style of conversation. His articulation was in-\ndistinct, so that all three of us were more disposed to look at his face\nthan we otherwise would have done, and the same tendency to look\nat his face was encouraged by his drawling volubility, intermitting\nnow and then for a few moments, but ever beginning anew, and\nskipping from one subject to another, sometimes making an affirma-\ntion, sometimes indulging in a remark of quiet humour, and at times\nasking a question. I tried to resist this beguiling tendency to look\naway from the table to his face, but was afterwards obliged to ac-\nknowledge my lapses.\nAs I held the five slips of paper (let me hereinafter call them by the\nold term \" billet \") Reese asked me if I knew which message or\nquestion of mine was located on which billet. Before we really\nsettled down to business, and while he was chatting, several times\nhe broke off to ask this question again of me, and every time 1\nanswered truthfully that I did not. What difference did it make\nwhether I knew or not, on which billet any particular writing of mine\nwas to be found ? This, that if I did know, and observed that he\ngot back a billet from a person to whom he apparently had not\ngiven it, I should know that something was rotten in Denmark.\nPresently Reese said, \" Give Miss M. a billet \". I instantly passed\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1932\none to her, so that my movement and his, as his arm was partly\nstretched across the table and pointed at her, were almost simul-\ntaneous. His pointing finger came perhaps one foot from the billet\nas Miss M. received it. First impression upon the spectator's mind\n\u2014\nhe did not touch the billet.\nReese chatted a bit more, then said, \" Now give Miss L. one \", and\nprecisely the same procedure followed, though this time he did not\nhave to extend his arm as he pointed, since Miss L. was next to him.\nImpression deepened\u2014he did not touch the paper.\nA little more chatting, and he directed that Miss M. receive\nanother billet, and pointed as before, and probably his finger came\na little nearer it. Again the psychological impression is deepened,\nuntil it becomes a groove\u2014he did not touch the paper. Then Reese\nsaid, \" Keep the other two yourself \", and told an interesting story,\nwhich got us to smiling. The story finished, he casually and quietly\nadded, \" No, I think we'll let Miss L. have another one \". I ex-\ntended my hand toward Miss L. with the folded paper in it, and this\ntime Reese intercepted the paper, when his hand was probably not\nmore than six inches from that of Miss L. Here is where the twenty\nwitnesses who had told me their stories fell down. Either, through\nthe effect of the three instances where Reese did not touch the billet,\nthe witnesses failed to observe that he did touch it in the fourth case,\nor having casually observed it, its very naturalness prevented its\nhaving any abiding place in the memory.\nThe fourth billet was taken by Reese, and the back of his hand\nand his curved fingers so held that the action of his thumb was in-\nvisible to any of the three witnesses. He was so fiendishly clever\nthrough long practice as to be able, in the moment when the billet\nwas invisible, to shove his abstracted and folded slip of paper out\nbeyond the tip of his fingers and to put it in Miss L's hand without\nthe switch being observed.\nI should have earlier said that both ladies were directed where to\nhold the billets, so that each had one in each hand. It was necessary\nfor Reese to keep trace of the locations of the papers in order not to\nmake any mistake in the subsequent steps of his performance.\nHe now had, therefore, one of my billets, while Miss L. held\nanother in one hand and a dummy in the other. Reese waited a\nlittle while and went through the business of having some kind of a\nmediumistic spasm, put on the appearance of receiving inspiration,\nand drew a sheet of paper which was on the table toward him. Upon\nthis sheet of paper, drawn close to his edge of the table, he proceeded\nwith his right hand alone to make queer characters resembling\nHebrew. This device was intended to, and did enchain our attention.\n1 confess with shame that I thoroughly supposed that his message\nwas being set down in that form, which he would afterwards trans-\n\fMat 1932 A Sitting with Bert Reese 253\nlate. While we were looking at the making of the characters, his\neyes were naturally downcast\u2014it would have been impossible to see\nwhether he was looking at the paper or beneath the edge of the table,\nwhich he really was\u2014while his left hand underneath the rim of the\ntable unfolded my billet and he read it. (If I had had another\nsitting, I would have been on the look-out for this hieroglyphics busi-\nness, but he probably would not have used it a second time with the\nsame person. As I have learned from other sources, he had various\ndevices to enchain the attention.)\nNext Eeese began to tell what was on the paper, and to answer it.\nThe halting and imperfect way that he did it may have been partly\nthe effect of my bad writing, but was certainly a bit of consummate\nart with which he imitated mediumistic business. There remained\nno question that he had become aware of what I had written. Hav-\ning made his response, he said to Miss L., \" Now let's have the billet\nthat is in that hand \" (pointing to the hand which did not hold the\ndummy) \" and we will see whether that is right or not \". He took\nthe billet deliberately, drew his hand to his edge of the table, and\napparently spread what he had received out upon the table, but. of\ncourse, another substitution had been made, so that what he really\nopened upon the table was the billet which he had just read, and he\nwas provided with another one in advance. Were not the spirits\nkind, or did not his telepathy surpass any other ever heard of, that he\nnot only learned what was on the papers, but also was able to tell\nexactly in which hand of which person the particular ones were to\nbe found ?\nOf course, he proceeded in the same fashion with the other two\nbillets, last of all getting back the dummy from Miss L.\nMind, I do not claim to have actually seen all the acts and move-\nments which I describe. It was practically impossible to see a single\nsubstitution. Houdini said, in one of his books, that Bert Reese\nwas the greatest \" billet-switcher \" that the world ever knew, and\nthat without his own many years of experience he could not have\ndetected what the movements meant. What I did was to observe,\nas minutely as I could, the utterances, the outstanding acts, the\nsheltering posture of the man's fingers, and every possible detail, and\nimmediately afterwards to sit down to gather these indicia, and to\ngive the only possible rational interpretation for them as a whole.\nThe main fact that I did observe, however, in itself largely tells the\nstory and explains why a multitude of honest men look back to their\nexperiences with Reese and erroneously declare that Reese told them\nwhat was on their billets before he ever touched them. I saw that\nhe did not touch the first three of them, but that he very unobtru-\nsively and carefully did intercept the fourth, and in that act is the\nkey to the whole mystery of his performance. Add to this (in spite\n\f2 54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1932\nof my not seeing any actual substitution) the damning fact of con-\ncealing one piece of the sheet of paper of equal size with the others\nand keeping silent about the fact that it was abstracted, also that\ncurious and reiterated question whether I knew which writing was\non which billet, a question which could have no earthly occasion\nother than as explained above.\nAs he told it, and as he believed that it occurred, there would be\nno normal explanation for the incident of Reese's work as described\nby the late Thomas A. Edison. But it was never told in the detail\nnecessary to understand exactly what took place. Whether it is true\nor not, as Reese boasted to me, that Professor Muensterberg was\nbowled over by him and had proposed having a series of experiments\nin order to study the first psychical phenomenon of which he was\nconvinced, but was prevented by his death, I do not know. But,\nremembering that Reese, as reported to me afterward, boasted to\nsome friends that he had fooled me, before putting belief in the\nMuensterberg story, I should want to see those letters of the Harvard\nprofessor which Reese said he would show me but never did. After\nhis performance with me, I grasped him warmly by the hand, utter-\ning several such expressions as \"It was very interesting\u2014it was\nvery extraordinary \". I had hoped to have another sitting with\nhim, but I could tell by Reese's manner as he went out that my\nremarks, for all their fervour, did not have the right wording to\nsatisfy him, and he never would give me another sitting.\nI repeat those words to-day, it was very interesting, and very\nextraordinary indeed. I have seen some of the cleverest magicians\non the platform, but I never saw a whole programme that interested\nme so much as the marvellous art of this man, who could accomplish\nsubstitutions with three people present, none of whom were more\nthan three feet from him, without it being possible directly to detect\nthe acts of substitution, and do all in so calm, deliberate and non-\nchalant a manner.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nA THEORY OF SURVIVAL.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\nIn Mr Saltmarsh's paper (Proceedings, xl. 105 ff.), which\neffects such a valuable clearing of the ground for psychical research,\none point is touched on which, I think, deserves more critical atten-\ntion from psychical researchers.\nOn p. 108, the author speaks of the faces and finger-prints which\nare alleged to be formed out of some kind of teleplasmic or ecto-\n\fMay 1932 Correspondence 255\nplasmic substance during sittings with physical mediums. The\nphysical characteristics, the forms of the face, the markings on the\nskin of the fingers, etc., he continues, \" originally depended on the\nhighly complex arrangement of the skin, muscles, nerves, etc., of the\nliving body of the deceased person. This arrangement was broken\nup at death and the material scattered. In order to be reproduced\nthis material must be reassenbled in its original form or a facsimile\nmade out of other material. Is there any reason for holding that\nthe person who originallly owned the body is the only or even the\nmost likely agent who could do this reassembling ? I am inclined\nto think that this is not so.\"\nThe point which I think requires discussion is the most likely inter-\npretation of an identified finger-print of a deceased person, if proved\nto be genuine.\nAt death the material particles are certainly scattered, as Mr\nSaltmarsh says, and it is also true to say that their arrangement is\nbroken up, if by \" arrangement \" is meant no more than their actual\nspatial distribution. But, if by \" arrangement \" is meant the\nsystem of forces or dispositions which (whatever they are and how-\never they may act) determine this spatial distribution during life,\nthen I do not see that there is any direct evidence which obliges us\nto assume its destruction. Such destruction is commonly assumed ;\nthus, on p. 126 Mr Saltmarsh refers to \" disembodied minds \" in a\nway which suggests that disembodiment is the inevitable corollory\nof survival. This is the common assumption, but to my mind it\nruns ahead of the evidence. Personally, I should regard the pro-\nduction of a finger-print, indubitably recognised as that of a deceased\nperson (fraud being excluded), as strong evidence of the survival of\nthat person's body, meaning by the \" body \" an effective system of\nnon-physical dispositions which in life determines the minute spatial\narrangement of the cellular units or particles in the body\u2014for\nexample, of the skin-ridges forming the finger-prints. If we suppose\nsuch an effective organising system to exist and not to be included\nin the chemical and physical properties of the particles themselves,\nthere appears to be no particular reason why it should not survive\ndeath. If it did so, and afterwards came into contact with any\nsubstance of a kind which it could influence, it might quite well re-\narrange this substance automatically in precisely the same way as\nthat in which it had in life arranged the physical cell-matter of the\norganism.\nI am considering that what is essential in the body is an organising\nsystem, analogous in a rough sort of way to a magnetic field, and\nthat its visible appearance depends upon a supply of suitable\nmaterial within its field of influence, much as a card sprinkled with\niron filings is essential to make a magnetic field visible. Remove\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1932\nthe filings, and the field is no longer apparent to the senses ;\nbring\nthe filings back, and the original pattern reappears.\nNow, if the finger-print of a deceased person can be proved to have\nappeared impressed on paraffin-wax at a sitting, it seems much\nsimpler to assume that it has not been produced by \" thought \" at\nall but by the actual presence of the deceased person's \" body \"\nacting automatically on some peculiar kind of substance.\nIt may, of course, be the case that the medium has only to think\nof X's thumb for a model of it in ectoplasm to be formed, complete\nin every detail of all the complicated lines ; but when looked into,\nthis theory is very difficult to believe. Even granting an existing\nrecord of the finger-print of the deceased (such a record must be\nsupposed to exist for purposes of identification), the theory demands\nan extraordinary concatenation of marvellous processes. (1) The\nmedium must obtain clairvoyant access to this recorded impression.\n(2) She must either (a) retain a subconscious memory of it, perfect\nin every detail, while she is reproducing it in ectoplasm at the sitting,\nor (6) maintain a subconscious rapport with it during the sitting\nsufficiently close and minute to enable her to reproduce a complete\nreplica. (3) Her thought influences the ectoplasm directly. The\nreproduction is of an idea, and intermediary mechanism is lacking,\nthus making the process semi-magical.\nOn the other hand, the theory of a non-physical \" body \" of forma-\ntive dispositions has a certain a priori plausibility ;\nit is not alto-\ngether an ad hoc hypothesis coming directly out of the blue. Some-\nthing of the kind would appear to be inevitable unless we accept a\nrigidly mechanistic form of biology. Without such a hypothesis,\nthat is to say, those formative dispositions which are effective in\nshaping and maintaining the organisms in life must be assumed to\nreside entirely within the material particles themselves. That such\na theory, consistently upheld as an ultimate or metaphysical scheme,\nis fraught with immense difficulties, can scarcely be denied. Such\nan eminent biologist as Dr J. S. Haldane has said, \" A mechanism of\nhereditary transmission is simply a contradiction in terms\n. '\n' Neither\nneed the rejection of mechanism necessarily involve vitalism or an\ninstrumentalist view of the mind-body question. There is, I think,\na possible via media ; but that is going too far afield.\nWhat I wish to point out is that the existence of some such non-\nphysical \" body \" is placed quite on the cards by biological facts\nalone, and that the hypothesis, if introduced into psychical research,\nwould explain such a thing as a post-mortem finger-print far more\nsimply and naturally than that of a mediumistic \" thought-picture\n\"\nreproduced in ectoplasm.\nI do not say that a surviving \" body \" of this kind, even if proved\nto exist, would establish the survival of the personality. But, if it\n\fMay 1932 Reviews 257\nwere associated with appropriate and characteristic mental pheno-\nmena, it would go a long way in forming an important chain of\nevidence.\nYours, etc..\nG. N. M.

Mme Kahl-Toukholka. who seems to have\nendeavoured to name his wife to him as \" Genriette \". Mrs Bester-\nman's name being Henrietta, Mr Besterman suggests in his account\nthat \" Genriette \" is the French version of it plus an initial G.\nActually, the matter is simpler. Russians always turn such an\nH into G, so that the Russian form of Henrietta would be \" Gen-\nrietta \". The difference in the final vowel of Mme Kahl-Toukholka's\nversion seems a small matter\u2014to be explained perhaps by the French\ntermination of an otherwise uncommon name\u2014compared with the\naccuracy (to Russian minds) of the initial consonant.\nYours, etc.,\nC.

We are Here. Foreword by Sir Oliver Lodge. 8vo,\npp. 256, 3 ill. London : Rider and Co.. 1931. Price 7s. 6d.\nnet.\n\" We are here \", or actually \" We here \". is the introductory\nphrase used by two communicators who purport to be the sons of\nthe author, a Norwegian Judge, in their talks with him through the\nmediumship of his daughter Ingeborg. Ludvig Dahl, the eldest son,\nmet with a sailing accident on 29 May 1919 and was killed ;\nRagnar,\nthe youngest, died of tuberculosis on 31 May 1921. Seven months\nafter the eldest son's death the Judge and his family held a table\nsitting, at which his married daughter, Ingeborg. proved to be the\nmedium, and by interpreting the tilts of the table in the usual way\nit was learned that the purporting communicator was Ludvig.\nThe difficulty of obtaining evidence where the medium is a\nmember of the family is obvious, but Judge Dahl assures us as\n\f2.58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1932\nregards \" proofs of identity \", that \" these were readily and satis-\nfactorily given, by way of little familiar reminiscences from Ludvig's\nearly childhood \" (page 27), apparently overlooking the fact that\nthese, if familiar, would certainly be known to those present, in-\ncluding probably the medium. The name of a Swedish gardener to\nwhom Ludvig was much attached when about four years old was\ngiven, however, the author remarking (page 27), \" I am especially\nmentioning this example because that name was so far from our\nthoughts.\" On the following page he tells us that, as far as he and\nthe family were concerned, they needed no further proof.\nOn the death of the youngest son, Ragnar, he too became a regular\ncommunicator, and from 1923 onward the ouija board was used\ninstead of the table. Ingeborg being sometimes in trance, sometimes\nawake. The greater part of the book is occupied by descriptions of\nlife after death received by this method, but an interesting feature\nof the mediumship from the point of view of psychical research, is the\nclairvoyant state which takes place at the conclusion of the ouija\nboard sittings. In this state the medium apparently sees and hears\nher brothers, and is quite unconscious of the presence of the rest of\nthe family. She becomes childlike in the clairvoyant condition, and\nit is only with difficulty that the communicators can get her to repeat\nwhat they wish to say. On awaking from this condition she is\nable, says Judge Dahl. to give interesting descriptions \" supple-\nmented by messages of significant and even evidential contents,\ndirected to some stranger who happens to attend the seance. Then\na name may be given, which she was unable to give during the\nclairvoyance, or an allusion to the earth life of the person concerned\n\"\n(page 101). This would seem to have something in common with\nMrs Piper's \" waking stage \", and it is regrettable that so few details\nor information received in this way are given.\nChapter 5, entitled \" Miscellaneous Episodes \", is devoted to inci-\ndents connected with various types of phenomena claimed for the\nmedium, including reproduction of the handwriting of deceased\npersons, booktests, and apports. The handwriting phenomena are\nillustrated by photographic reproductions of the handwriting of\nvarious communicators while alive, of that purporting to come from\nthem through the hand of the msdium, and of the medium's own\nhandwriting. The signature in the letter of the deceased English\nlady to her niece bears a quite striking resemblance to her signature\nwhile alive\u2014more so perhaps than does the spirit-writing of Wiers-\nJenssen to his original writing. The reproduction of the medium's\nhandwriting shows no resemblance to any of the others, and we are\nassured in both cases that she had never seen the original hand-\nwriting. With regard to the letter from the English lady, the\nauthor states on page 227 that the medium's \" knowledge of English\n\fMat 1932 Reviews 259'\nis limited to that of the average Norwegian girl who has attended a\nsecondary school. An English letter she had never before written.\"\nThe booktests are of quite a different type to those obtained by\nMrs Leonard, and from the description given by Judge Dahl it does\nnot seem that normal knowledge on the part of the medium of the\nbooks and their contents can be ruled out. Briefly, the books were\nin a room in Judge Dahl's own house. There were apparently only\ntwo shelves of them, an upper and a lower. The communicators,\nLudvig and Ragnar, said they would go into this room and read a\npassage from any book that the sitters chose. Thus the 7th book\nfrom the left on* the upper shelf was selected (the total number of\nbooks on each shelf is unspecified). This turned out to be Words-\nworth's Poetical Works, and several passages from page 316 were\nread correctly, apparently in English. Other successful tests of the\nsame kind are given, but they would be more convincing if the sitters\nhad been allowed to select the page, as well as the book, or if the books\non the shelves had been thoroughly mixed up before the sitting.\nOf the apport phenomena little can be said, except that their\nsupernormal character depends entirely on the good faith of the\nmedium, as she was not of course controlled in any way. The first\nphenomenon, however, took place in full light. In this case, a piece\nof paper, said to have been given to her by the invisible Ludvig,\nsuddenly appeared in the medium's hand. In the second case two\nletters were produced in her hand after \" a slight click \" (page 240)\nwhen she was standing in the middle of a room\n\u00a3i\nwith hands out-\nstretched and palms upward.\"\nIt is much to be hoped that further records of Fru Ingeborg's-\nmediumship will be made from a more critical and evidential stand-\npoint.\nS.

Where so much is obscure it is gratifying to find an\nauthor who can boldly say, as M. Mager does in his Introduction,\n\" My object has been attained. I have solved the enigma of the\ndivining-rod and perhaps the enigma of matter.\"\nThe first half of the book is mainly historical. An account is\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat 1932\ngiven of several famous dowsers, mostly French, and their methods.\nThere is a long section, fully illustrated, on different forms of pen-\ndulum used in dowsing, but M. Mager distrusts the pendulum alto-\ngether as responding too readily to the conscious or unconscious\nthought of the dowser, whereas \" the divining rod in competent\nhands refuses all such complaisance.\"\nAfter describing the various types of forked rod used by dowsers,\nM. Mager enquires \" Why the rod moves \". Like other continental\ntheorists, he does not accept the hypothesis familiar to English\nreaders from Sir W. Barrett's work, that the movements of the rod\nare due to unconscious muscular action exteriorising a purely psychic\nperception on the part of the dowser. They are due, he holds, to a\nline of force coming up through the ground and impinging on the\napex of the forked rod : the force travels along the right branch up\nthe right arm. through the right side of the body, and discharges\nthrough the right foot into the ground, and a similar circuit is estab-\nlished through the left branch, arm and leg, there being an absolute\ndivision down the centre of the body. If either half of the body is\ninsulated, e.g. by a rubber shoe, the circuit of that side is destroyed\nand the rod fails to function properly. Copper, he maintains, stops\nthe current on the right side, but not the left : iron the current on\nthe left, but not the right.\nM. Mager's principal contribution to the theory and practice of\ndowsing is the use of rods of divers colours. These, he claims, re-\nspond in different ways according to the chemical composition of the\nsubstances whose vibrations cause the rod to move, so that it is\npossible by his method to tell not only the area of a subterranean\nfield of water, its depth and force, but also its purity and potability.\nHe describes in some detail the experiments that led him to this con-\nclusion, and the successes which he claims to have achieved in put-\nting his discoveries in practice.\nWhat is lacking in the book is evidence that M. Mager's methods\nif followed by other dowsers would give similar results. Until this\nhas been shown the objective validity of the methods must remain\nin doubt. It is to be hoped that M. Mager's very interesting, if\nspeculative, book, will induce other dowsers to put his theories to\nthe test.\nA like criticism applies, as the author candidly admits, to the\nsecond book. Dr Martin, a veterinary surgeon, claims that it is\npossible by means of a pendulum to discover whether an animal is\nin a healthy condition or not, and if it is unhealthy, to locate the\nmischief : if the pendulum is held in the left hand and the right is\nstretched out as an \" antenna \" towards the animal, the pendulum\nwill rotate counter-clockwise if the animal is healthy, and will oscil-\nlate without rotation in the neighbourhood of an unhealthy organ.\n\fMat 1932 Notes on Periodicals 261\nIf the experimenter will place the beast between himself and the. sun\nand will hold, in the same hand as the pendulum, a temoin of the\nappropriate substance, he will discover the cause of the mischief, as\nthe appropriate temoin will now make the pendulum rotate. Thus\nby means of a steel temoin Dr Martin discovered that a cow had\nswallowed a knitting needle, and so on. Dr Martin admits, however,\nthat without pathological training, no results of value are likely to\nbe obtained.\nW. H. S.\nOttokar Fischer. Illustrated Magic. Trans. J. B.

He\naccepts precognition as actually occurring, both in the states of\nwaking and sleep, the only controversy being as to its nature and\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1932\ncause. He lays it down that in both these states the individual\nmaintains relation with the external world of time and space as well\nas with the infinite and eternal universe, the former being the pheno-\nmenon, the latter the noumenon.\nMan has therefore the power to acquire knowledge of the past,\npresent and future. Knowledge of the past is governed by the laws\nof logic, which laws have been discovered and stated. Knowledge\nof the future is acquired by the operation of the mind in another\ndirection where the laws of logic cannot follow. The laws governing\nthis operation have yet to be discovered.\nAll nature is subject to law, it follows that there is no such thing\nas fortuitous coincidence ; what appears to be such is only what he\ncalls \" concordance \". He therefore denies the existence of chance\nas an independent causative factor.\nIt may be questioned whether any instructed person to-day really\nholds the view attacked ;\nsurely all that is meant by chance is a\nconcatenation of causes and circumstances so complex and so im-\nperfectly known as to defy calculation.\nDr Chatenay quite rightly points out that there is no causal rela-\ntion between the premonition and its fulfilment, there is no \" fatalite\nde soi \" only logically \" en soi \".\nHe quotes with approval Maeterlinck's phrase \" les noces mer-\nveilleuses que celebrent l'Espace et le Temps \" and says that the\nsolution of the problem of precognition must be sought in this\nconcept.\nThe remainder of the article is a criticism of the view expressed\nby Auguste Lumiere on the matter of a premonitory dream. Sub-\nstantially this is that the number of dreams is so great that it must\nsometimes happen that apparent premonitions occur due simply to\nchance-coincidence, and he cites two examples of coincidence which,\nhe says, are more extraordinary than the fulfilment of any dream.\nDr Chatenay objects that the phenomena are of an entirely different\norder and argues against Lumiere's conclusion, not altogether, in\nthe writer's opinion, with complete success.\nHe ends by citing three examples of what he calls precognition in\nspace. These, however, being simultaneous monitions, are irrele-\nvant.\nThough it cannot be said that the article throws any fresh light on\nthe subject, it is worth studying by those interested in the problem.\nH.

Mrs Alfred Lyttelton in\nthe Chair.\nLord Charles Hope read a paper entitled \" Report on Some\nSittings with Valiantine and Phoenix in 1927\/' which is printed,\nsomewhat abridged, in Part 125 of Proceedings.\nIn the discussion which followed Miss Fleming asked whether\ndirect communications had ever been received through Valiantine\nfrom relatives who had died quite recently.\nMr C. A. Moss suggested that Valiantine might be descended from\nan Itaban and that he might thus have a knowledge of the language.\nMiss Reutiner said she had sat with Valiantine and understood that\ncommunications had been received through him in Hindustani.\nLady Barrett asked to what extent it was claimed that the foreign\nmessages given by Valiantine and Phoenix consisted of consecutive\nsentences or words.\nMr Besterman added that Dr Whymant appeared to use the word\n\" conversation \" rather loosely. An exchange of words and phrases\ncertainly appeared to have taken place, but unless each observation\nhad some definite connection with the foregoing one. this could\nhardly be called a conversation.\nDr E. J. Dingwall agreed that this was a crucial point. In general\nhe thought that Dr Whymant's observations were to be attributed\nto hallucination. But in regard to the Chinese he felt this assump-\ntion could hardly be made.\nMr G. R. S. Mead said that the sounds of Chinese were very diffi-\ncult for a European to reproduce.\nThe Rev. J. W. Hayes, Mrs Carpenter, Colonel Dick, and Mr\nStrawson also took part in the discussion.\nLord Charles Hope, in replying, said that he had not himself re-\nceived communications from recently deceased friends. There was\nconsiderable doubt whether Hindustani had actually been spoken\nin Valiantine's sittings. It was possible that the medium sometimes\ngot telepathic impressions.\n\f26S Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1932\nThe Relation between Parapsychical and\nParaphysical Phenomena.\nThe 114th private meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\n27 April 1932, at 5.30 p.m., Sir Lawrence Jones in the Chair.\nMr W. H. Salter read a paper entitled \" The Relation between\nParapsychical and Paraphysical Phenomena,\" of which an abridg-\nment is printed below.\nThe question as to the nature of the relation between para-\nphysical and parapsychical phenomena is one which must have\nexercised the mind of every student of psychical research, but little\nlight is thrown on it in the standard literature of our subject. Pod-\nmore's The New Spiritualism is probably the most helpful book.\nThe object of this paper is to touch briefly on a few aspects of this\nquestion.\nIs psychical research concerned with two distinct and unrelated\nsubjects which by the accident of history have come to share a com-\nmon name, or do paraphysical and parapsychical phenomena own\nsome common underlying factor which unites them as naturally as\nzoology and botany ?\nSome persons, but probably no Members of our Society, might\nperhaps suggest that the question could be sufficiently answered by\nsaying that all alleged supernormal phenomena are the products of\ndeliberate fraud, but confining our attention to instances of both\ntypes of phenomena which, whether certainly supernormal or not,\nare not due merely to deliberate fraud, we have enough material to\ngo on.\nWe start with a human predisposition to regard mental marvels as\nincomplete if unaccompanied by a marvel on the physical plane.\nThis is an integral part of the popular conception of the supernatural,\nwell established long before mankind began to suspect that much\nwhich passed as supernatural was in reality supernormal.\nComing to the beginning of modern psychical research we find in\nthe Hydesville rappings in 1848 the mental and physical factors\nclosely combined. The raps, it will be remembered, are reported to\nhave given correct replies to questions, the answers to which were\nnormally known only to the questioners. Whether or not the Hydes-\nville phenomena were fraudulent is immaterial for the present pur-\npose, as during the decades which followed them the association of\nmental and physical phenomena was confirmed in popular opinion by\ntwo types of phenomena, in which the physical factor, though we\nshould not now regard it as supernormal, was not the mere product\nof fraud.\nThe first of these was table-tilting, which became popular in the\n1850's. The notion that the movements of the table in themselves,.\n\fJune 1932 Private Meetings 269\napart from any question of the content of the messages spelt out,\nwere due to some supernormal force long survived Faraday's demon-\nstrations that they were caused by unconscious muscular action.\nEven more important, perhaps, were the somatic conditions attendant\non mediumistic trance. In the then state of medical science it was\nonly to be expected that these should seem to be quite outside the\nordinary course of nature.\nThrough D. D. Home's mediumship the traditional association of\nthe mental and physical is carried over into the age of scientific\ninquiry. The records of Home's spirit messages are, however, so\nimperfect that it is impossible now to determine whether he pos-\nsessed any real parapsychical powers ;\nMyers, Barrett and Podmore\nwere all inclined to accept them. But it is, of course, on his para-\nphysical phenomena, still so hotly debated, that Home's present\nfame rests. With Stainton Moses the association continued, but\nwhether his physical phenomena was genuine or not, they were pro-\nduced under very inferior conditions, and it is not for them, but for\nthe Spirit Teachings, and for one or two cases of possibly supernormal\nknowledge, that he deserves consideration.\nWhen however we come to the principal mediums of the next\ngeneration, such as Mrs Piper and Eusapia, the cleavage between\nthe two types of mediumship becomes obvious, and has, with some\nexceptions, persisted to our day. In the line of succession to Mrs\nPiper we have Mrs Leonard, Mrs Warren Elliott and the S.P.R.\ngroup of aiitomatists, while Eusapia's lineage includes Eva C,\nKathleen Goligher and the Schneider brothers. The cleavage is not\nabsolute. Mrs Leonard's recent autobiography makes mention of a\nfew physical phenomena, but it is not clear that these were produced\nthrough her own mediumship. Mrs Thompson, during the earlier\npart of her mediumship, produced physical phenomena. Nor must\nthe versatility of Margery be overlooked, although as long as her\nphenomena are produced under the same auspices as hitherto, re-\nsults which would help us in our inquiry are not to be expected.\nWhile the cleavage is not complete it may none the less be said\nthat, during practically the whole of our Society's existence, all the\nphysical phenomena that matter derive from one group, and all the\nmental phenomena that matter from the other. Can this cleavage\nbetween the two types of mediumship be paralleled in the sphere of\nspontaneous phenomena ? Let us consider the three main types,\nthe poltergeist, the \" fixed local ghost \" and the veridical phantasm.\nThe typical poltergeist is purely physical and unconnected with\nany display of supernormal intelligence. There are, however, a few\napparent exceptions. In the Hydesville case already mentioned the\nraps were reported to have displayed supernormal intelligence in\nanswering questions. The Derrygonelly case investigated by Sir\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1932\nWilliam Barrett in 1877 is another exception of the same kind (see\nProceedings, xxv. 390). If a good number of more cases of the same\ntype were forthcoming and were supported by good evidence, we\nmight be led to the conclusion that this class of phenomenon had\nsome linkage with parapsychical phenomena, but on the present\nscanty evidence we cannot assume more than a chance connection\nbetween the physical phenomena, which are typical, and the mental,\nwhich, assuming them to be well established, are very rare.\nThe type of haunting known as the \" fixed local ghost \" is hard to\nplace. It is very rare, and to judge from our records, is growing\nprogressively rarer. There seems very little evidence for imputing\nintelligence to it, but it would appear that somehow a physical point\nde repere is an essential factor as in psychometry, a form of medium-\nship accepted by so cautious a critic as Dr Walter Prince.\nVeridical phantasms are generally accepted as purely psychical,\nsubject to the reservation made by Myers and Richet regarding\nreciprocal and collective cases. Myers's views are not very easy to\nfollow : equally with the other authors of Phantasms of the Living he\nrejected the view that the body has a rarified duplicate, a \" meta-\norganism \" capable of projection to a distant point in space : this\nwould imply, to use his words, the existence of a meta-coat and meta-\ntrousers. What he argued for was \" the breaking loose of a psychical\nelement . . . definable mainly by its power of producing a phantasm,\nperceptible by one or more persons, in some portion or other of space,\"\nand discussing a particular case he adds, \" a certain psychical ele-\nment so far detached itself from its organism as to affect a certain\nportion of space, not materially nor even optically, but yet in such a\nmanner that to a certain kind of immaterial and non-optical sensi-\ntivity a phantasm became discernible \" (see Phantasms, ii. 277 seq.).\nNotwithstanding the great weight which attaches to any considered\nopinion of Myers, the difficulties of this conception seem to outweigh\nthose involved in supposing that collective hallucinations are tele-\npathic in origin, and have no spacial existence at all.\nIt would seem therefore that the cleavage noticed between the\nparaphysical and parapsychical in mediumistic phenomena is even\nmore pronounced in spontaneous phenomena.\nA word is perhaps necessary as to cases of mixed or combined\nmental and physical phenomena, such as spirit photography or the\n\" direct voice \" of trumpet mediumship. In many of the cases re-\nported it would appear that mental phenomena of poor quality are\naccepted because they are guaranteed by physical phenomena which\nare no better, and vice versa ; there are few types of mediumship for\nthe genuineness of which the evidence is less satisfactory.\nLet us now consider whether the two types of phenomena operate\nthrough some common or similar force, and also whether they origin-\n\fJune 1932 Private Meetings 271\nate in any common or similar psychology in the persons through\nwhose agency they occur. Under the first heading we may compare\ntelepathy and telekinesis as being the two best authenticated forms\nof each class of phenomena.\nTelepathy is generally accepted as a purely psychical process, inde-\npendent not only of any physical force known to us, but also of any\nforce which, while unknown, yet conforms to known physical laws.\nThe main, but not the only, argument in support of this view, is that\ntelepathy takes no account of distances, and treats with disrespect\nthe law of inverse squares. The evidence for telepathy has not yet\nconvinced general scientific opinion, but so far as it goes, it seems to\npoint to the direct action of mind upon mind. One sometimes hears\ntelepathy spoken of as a sort of \" beggarly rudiment \" that the\nS.P.R. ought long ago to have left behind ; but it is such a revolu-\ntionary conception, that if nothing else had been done by the Society\nin the last fifty years beyond bringing it as near the point of proof as\nit has been brought, our time would not have been wasted.\nWhether telekinesis, on the assumption that it is genuine, is to be\nregarded as the direct operation of mind on matter, or as the operation\nof mind on normal matter through the medium of matter in the\nabnormal condition known as ectoplasm, it does not in either aspect\nseem to offer any analogy or parallel to telepathy.\nVarious theories have from time to time been put forward to ex-\nplain the connection between paraphysical and parapsychical pheno-\nmena such as the etheric and ideoplastic theories. If one starts with\nthe essential connection of the parapsychical and paraphysical as\nproved, it is legitimate, possibly inevitable, to adopt some theories of\nthis kind as a missing link, but it is not satisfactory to reverse the\nprocess and make the missing link an argument to prove the connec-\ntion.\nIn considering the psychological conditions favouring the produc-\ntion of either type of phenomenon it is best at the outset to confine\nour attention to the spontaneous instances of each type and to pro-\nceed later to mediumistic phenomena, since the genuineness of each\nmedium's performances must be judged separately, while the much\ngreater number of persons concerned in the production of spontan-\neous phenomena more readily permits generalisation.\nA glance at Phantasms of the Living or Mrs Sidgwick's later collec-\ntion of similar cases will show the very wide distribution of spon-\ntaneous mental phenomena. It is impossible to point to any type or\nclass of sane human being and say, \" there goes a typical agent or\na typical percipient \" or, \" there goes a person who is most unlikely\nto transmit or perceive a veridical hallucination.\" Poltergeist\nphenomena, on the other hand, conform to a general type, as agreed\nboth by those who believe in their genuineness and by those who do\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1932\nnot. They centre round some individual of a type almost too familiar\nto require description. Usually it is a child, occasionally an adult, in\neither case mentally or physically subnormal. The surroundings are\nusually uncongenial, and the main purpose of the phenomena seems\nto be to compensate the depressed person round whom they centre\nby conferring a transient importance. The poltergeist, if left to run\nits course unchecked, may develop into regular physical mediumship,\nand so it becomes important to inquire whether anything is to be\nfound outside the limits of poltergeist phenomena psychologically\nanalogous to the \" naughty little girl.\" to use Podmore's convenient\nlabel for the typical poltergeist.\nTwo parallels at once suggest themselves. First the mischievous\nphase, often observed in cases of multiple personality, of which the\nSally of Morton Prince's Miss Beauchamp is probably the best-\nknown . The second is the child control frequently appearing in the\ncase of mediums of various types. The nature and origin of Sally\nhas been much debated, but it is sufficient for the present purpose\nthat as the result of dissociation there emerged a very tricky, clever\nchild personality, quite unlike either the normal Miss Beauchamp or\nany of her other subsidiary personalities, and eager to play mis-\nchievous pranks on them ; a character in fact very closely resembling\nthe child medium of poltergeist cases, except that Sally was more\namusing and attractive. Margaret of the Doris Fischer case comes\ninto the same general class as Sally. It will be remembered that the\nre-integrated Doris is credited by Dr Walter Prince with supernormal\npowers.\nOf the child Controls of mediums many seem to be no more than\nnoms de guerre. Others, such as Feda, have all the distinguishing\nmarks of personality, whether independent of or subsidiary to the\nnormal personality of the medium. Feda, according to the universal\ntestimony of Mrs Leonard's sitters, has the attractive characteristics\nof Sally without her less admirable traits. But except in the one\nrespect of childishness there is as little resemblance between Feda\nand the typical \" naughty little girl \" of the poltergeist cases, as there\nis between poltergeist phenomena and Mrs Leonard's trance com-\nmunications.\nBut with the other types of mediums we may find instances of\nchild Control much more in line with the poltergeist cases. There is,\nfor example, Stainton Moses's \" Little Dickie,\" who it will be re-\nmembered provided the comic relief in the almost too serious atmo-\nsphere of Stainton Moses's sittings. Like Sally he was amusing and\nmischievous and showed little regard for the physical comfort of the\nprincipal personality : for instance he hit Stainton Moses on the head\nwith a brass candlestick. His kinship with the typical child medium\nof poltergeist cases is also apparent.\n\fJune 1932 Private Meetings 273\nMrs Thompson, who produced physical phenomena in the earlier\nstages of her mediumship, but later confined herself to trance com-\nmunications, had a child Control Nelly, and Mrs Piper had a child,\nChlorine, as one of her earliest Controls.\nWith Mrs Leonard's Feda we reach the opposite pole to the type\nrepresented by Sally, Dickie and the \" naughty little girl \" of the\npoltergeist cases. That there should be differences in the characters\nof child Controls is not surprising, but may be significant. They\ncorrespond to the differences between real flesh and blood children.\nNot all little girls are naughty little girls, and not all children, thank\ngoodness, become the centres of poltergeist disturbances. While it\nseems that there is a natural tendency for mediumistic dissociation\nto bring to the surface a child personality endowed with those char-\nacteristics which most children share, playfulness and some liking\nfor make-believe, the nature of the child personality which rises to\nthe surface seems to vary with the fundamental nature of the medium,\nand the phenomena produced seem to vary in the same way. Mrs\nLeonard, as everyone knows, is a well-balanced contented woman,\nand Mrs Piper has been described as placid in the extreme.\nStainton Moses, on the other hand, though successful as clergyman\nand schoolmaster, was obviously something of a misfit. It is not\nof course suggested that the \" Dickie \" phase of Stainton Moses was\nresponsible for the whole of his phenomena : it would be absurd to\nattribute the Spirit Teachings to a mere \" infantile regression.\"\nPodmore's analysis of mediumistic psychology in The Newer Spirit-\nualism (Book II, chap, i) is in many ways admirable. He stresses\nthe common psychological origin of physical and mental mediumship\nin dissociation, bringing to the surface a child personality. \" The\ntrance personality,\" he says, \" is commonly non-moral in the sense\nthat many children and some savages are non-moral. ... It shows\nlittle desire, has perhaps little aptitude, for distinguishing between\nfacts and fiction,\" and so on. Hence he finds it natural that most\ntrance mediums have at one time or another produced physical\nphenomena, or as he puts it, \" they voyage in the same boat with\nHome and Eusapia .\" He excepts cases of slight dissociation such as\nthose which result in automatic writing. The analysis would be even\nbetter if he had not ignored the great divergence between the types\nof child personality evoked by dissociation, and probably if he were\nwriting this chapter now with knowledge of more recent develop-\nments he would have laid more stress on the differences, and less on\nthe similarities between the two types of mediumship.\nWe may sum the matter up by saying that, so far as concerns spon-\ntaneous phenomena, which occur without trance and so without dis-\nsociation, there is no psychological connection between the two types :\nso far as regards mediumistic phenomena, in cases where there is no\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1932\ndissociation, or only a slight one, there is also no connection : in\nmediumistic cases, where there is much dissociation, there is a con-\nnection in the emergence of the child phase or personality, but only a\nsuperficial one, as the child personalities vary as widely as the normal\npersonality of the mediums themselves.\nSo far the discussion has left the question of fraud on one side, but\nit is impossible to conclude it without asking which particular kind\nof mental phenomena and which of physical are being compared with\neach other. As regards the mental it is generally agreed that\nabundant evidence is forthcoming for the genuineness of both\nspontaneous and mediumistic phenomena. With the physical\nphenomena the case is entirely different, and the difference in evi-\ndential value suggests some fundamental difference inherent in the\ntwo types of phenomena. The contrast has been so well and so\nrecently drawn by Dr Walter Prince in his Presidential Address that\nit is unnecessary to dwell on it in detail.\nIn the discussion which followed the paper, Mr Besterman referred\nto Dr Osty's recent investigation of Rudi Schneider as affording\nanother instance of paraphysical phenomena (in that case, interfer-\nence with an infra-red ray by some substance or force which could not\nbe photographed) apparently responding to intelligent direction.\nMr Hettinger, Mr Findlater, and Miss Reutiner discussed the con-\nnection between mental and physical phenomena with regard to table\ntilting and the direct voice.\nMr Lambert emphasized the difficulty of drawing a clear-cut dis-\ntinction between genuine physical phenomena and hallucinations,\nwhile admitting that hallucinations affecting several senses of several\npercipients at the same time were almost unknown.\nThe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas said that it was important that\neverybody who was interested in psychical research should test their\nown powers for the production both of mental and of physical pheno-\nmena, as nobody knew what their powers were until they had tested\nthem. He believed that there emanated from mediums what he\nwould call a \" field of influence \" and that it was of denser character\nin the case of physical mediums than with mental mediums, and he\nhoped that apparatus would be invented to enable us to investigate\nit,\nMiss Fleming and Mr Wilkinson also took part in the discussion.\n\fJunk 1932 Correspondence 275\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE STATISTICAL METHOD OF ASSESSING THE EVI-\nDENTIAL VALUE OF MEDIUMISTIC COMMUNICATIONS.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\nIn vol. xxxix of Proceedings, p. 58, Mr Saltmarsh, dealing with\nthe difficult problem of scoring sittings so that the statistical method\nmay be applied to them, writes :\n\" The closest analogy seems to be\nthe marking of examination papers on some literary subject where\ndifferences of opinion, individual idiosyncracy, nuances of meaning,\nall complicate the matter.\" This comparison between the problem\nof scoring and the marking of examination papers on some literary\nsubject should make the following experiment of great interest.\nSome time ago, the Durham University School Examinations\nBoard authorised an experiment to test the reliability of the methods\nof marking the English papers set for the School Leaving Certificate.\nThe papers comprised an essay and precis (a two-hour paper) and\nanswers to six questions on set books in literature (a three-hour\npaper) . All the scripts from one school\u201448 in number\u2014were marked\nseparately by seven examiners of long experience, both in teaching\nand examining. These examiners did not meet or consult one another\nabout the marking but were told the object of the experiment. The\nresult, given in the table below, was astounding, even to teachers and\nexaminers prepared for differences in standards of marking.\nExaminer Fail Pass Credit Special C\nA 1 16 27 4\nB 0 2 :;i L2\nC 7 30 11 0\nD 0 9 36 3\nE 5 16 27 ii\nF 2 7 37 2\nG 19 L2 17 0\nThis discrepancy in the marking becomes even more pronounced\nif the \" Credit \" mark (the most important one) is taken and candi-\ndates divided into two classes.\nExaminer Below Credit Credit and Above\nA 17 31\nB 2 46\nC 37 11\nD 9 39\nE 21 27\nF 9 39\nG 31 17\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Joxe1932\nFinally, when this classification was examined, it was found that\nonly one candidate out of the 48 was placed by all the examiners in\nthe same class.\nThe bearing of this experiment on the statistical method in\npsychical research is obvious. It shows how sound is Mr Salt-\nmarsh's view (p. 59) that \" the ideal method would be to have each\nrecord scored independently by several persons, who would be pro-\nvided with a set of rules for their guidance ; a discussion between them\nof each disputed point would in all probability then result in some\ncompromise, and the average of the final scores might be taken as a\nfairly reliable estimate.\" It is quite true, as he says, that such a\nmethod \" would entail an enormous amount of labour,\" but an inves-\ntigation made on this principle (together with the other suggestions\nhe makes in the Appendix) would be a valuable contribution to\npsychical research.\nYours, etc.,\nJ. W. FlNDLATER.\n[The interesting experiment referred to by Mr Findlater is de-\nscribed in two articles by Charles Roberts and H. V. A. Briscoe in\nThe A.M.A. (the journal of the Incorporated Association of Assistant\nMasters in Secondary Schools), for December 1931 and February\n1932 (xxvi. 319-20, xxvii. 47-8). Arrangements are being made for\na similar experiment in the marking of mediumistic records.\n\u2014\nEd.]\nIS PROOF OF SURVIVAL POSSIBLE ?\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\nIn the April Journal under the above heading Mr Saltmarsh\nhas very clearly set forth some of the difficulties he finds in connec-\ntion with the idea of latency. Of chief interest is his suggestion that\nif an impression is received as a memory there is no reason why a\nperiod should be set to its latency. I think all these difficulties dis-\nappear if we take the word latency in its scientific connotation, where\nthere is always the idea of potential energy ; not that of the ever-\nresilient-spring type, but (as there are experimental psychological\ngrounds for positing) something analogous to an electric charge which\nslowly loses strength if not discharged.\nBut the theory of latency was only suggested provisionally to\naccount for phantasms of the recently deceased without having to\nattribute them to discarnate agency (v. Myers, Human Personality,\nconcise ed., p. 223). Incidentally it necessitated rather high-\nhanded action with a considerable mass of well-attested evidence for\nphantasms of the dead, which has in effect to be attributed to tele-\npathic impressions received by the percipients from unknown living\n\fJune 1932 Correspondence 277\npersons in a state of perturbation at their recollections of fear or\napprehension under strange natural or apparently praeternatural\nexperiences. The theory is mainly based upon the \" lagging \" ob-\nserved in certain historical telepathic experiments with hypnotised\nsubjects (v. loc. cit.) which, it may be suggested, may possibly have\nbeen due not to latency at all. but to lethargy or slowness of action\non the part of the percipients. It is not \" latency \" which causes the\nproverbial Scot to laugh at a joke A while others are enjoying joke B.\nThe Morton haunting, the Barter ghost, Miss L. Dodson's exper-\nience, the F. G. case (the scratched nose)\u2014to mention a few old re-\ncorded examples of apparitions\u2014are strongly suggestive of discar-\nnate agency, which is supplemented by (e.g.) the Statius, Ear of\nDionysius and Lethe cases and the best evidence obtained by Mr W.\nIrving and Mr Drayton Thomas with Mrs Leonard.1\nIt is in my opinion not possible to do the evidence justice by\ngeneralised pronouncements on the different categories of material\ncollected by the Society, although categorical proof may be a con-\nsummation never to be realised.\nYours, etc.,\nErnest S. Thomas.\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF TESTIMONY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\nI venture to assume that most of the members of the S.P.R.\nmust have been amazed at the contents of the Society's Proceedings\nfor May 1932. Officially they consist of a report of a \" series of\nexperimental sittings . . . for the purpose of investigating the most\nfavourable conditions for observation in sittings for psychical\n[sic, read \" physical.'\"\n\u2014\nEd.] phenomena.\" The Cotincil approved\nthe scheme.\nSix sittings were held, and each was attended by seven members of\nthe Society [this is not correct : see the report, pp. 369, 373.\n\u2014\nEd.]\nmaking forty-two in all. After each sitting they answered a written\nquestionnaire by Mr T. Besterman as to what had actually happened\nduring the twenty-five minutes that the sitting occupied (movements\non the part of the lady enacting the medium, interruptions by him-\nself, etc.) and he marked them for the accuracy and scope of the\nanswers. The rest of the Proceedings is taken up with eighteen\n1\nThe remarkable incident of the pseudo-personality John Ferguson recorded\nby Mr Soal (Proc. S.P.R.. vol. xxv) from his sittings with Mrs Cooper, which\nweighs against the \" spiritistic hypothesis,\" may perhaps be correlated with\nwhat was said by controls through Mrs Leonard io Sir Oliver Lodge regarding\n\" masks \" and \" personations \" (v. Conviction of Survival, pp. 23-33) although\nthe cases are obviously different in character.\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1932\npages of elaborate tables concerning the marks the sitters earned,\nand Mr Besterman's analysis of them. As the procedure at all these\nsittings was identical, they yield no results whatever as to the inves-\ntigation of the most \" favourable conditions for observation \" which\nwas their avowed object, but only show the comparative powers in\nobserving of forty-two unnamed persons.\nIt is impossible to imagine a more futile issue of the Proceedings of\na Society whose aim is Psychical Research, for from first page to last\nthere is nothing however remotely connected with it. Surely it\nwould be better if, during any month, there is nothing whatever to\nreport about the Society's activities in their subject, to notify the\nmembers, and issue no Proceedings at all, but save the expense of\nphotographs, plans, printing and publication, till the Council has\nsome material which is of possible interest to its members.\nYours, etc.,\nE. F. Benson.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Lancet, 17 October 1931.\nDr Robert M. Riggall, Hon. Clinical Psychologist to the West\nEnd Hospital for Nervous Diseases, gives a brief account of an\ninteresting case of an eightfold multiple personality. It is the\ncase of a woman, now aged 41, whose medical history is known\nsince 1915. As Dr Riggall is a psycho-analyst it is interesting to\nnote that the various personalities fit very well into a psycho-\nanalytical view of human personality. This feature does not\nappear in the classical cases of multiple personality. So far as can\nbe gathered from Dr Riggall's brief account the splitting of the\npersonality began in 1915, when the patient herself claimed that\nshe was a dual personality. While under the care of Dr W. H. B.\nStoddart at St Thomas's Hospital during 1916 and 1917 \" several\ndifferent personalities were discovered by means of hypnosis.\" It\nwould be interesting to learn precisely how these personalities were\n\" discovered.\" It is unfortunately only too often true that such\npseudo-personalities are \" suggested \" to the patient by the hypno-\ntist himself. A case of eightfold personality is so unusual that it\nis to be hoped a detailed report will be forthcoming in due course.\nTh. B.\n\fNo. 487.\u2014Vol. XXVII.

Everard Feilding.\nHaving been recently reminded, through reading for review Ottokar\nFischer's Illustrated Magic, of the verbal account given me some\ntwenty years ago by a friend (who prefers to be referred to by his\ninitials, but whose name is known to the Editor) of an occasion on\nwhich he had himself seen a performance of the rope-trick, I asked\nhim to write a report of his experience. Several letters have passed\nbetween us, but for brevity I have to summarise the resultant of his\noriginal statement and of his answers to my questions.\n16 February 1932.\n\" One Sunday afternoon in December 1903 in my bungalow on the\nWynaad plateau, S. India, my boy Daniel told me a group of\njugglers had arrived and would like to perform before me. I de-\nmurred, thinking they were of the ordinary type. . . . David, how-\never, insisted that they were out of the ordinary and I agreed. . . . The\ngroup consisted of four, an aged man with a long white beard, an-\nother man middle aged, a woman and a small boy of about 10 years\nfrom the Telegu country. They proceeded with their performance,\nwhich was good, . . . and after a little time I dismissed them. Some\nlittle time after, Daniel appeared to say they were still at the back\nand were anxious to show us a special trick which he declared to be\n'\nso so clever,' but they wanted a promise of 15 rupees. . . . The\nverandah not being suitable we went outside. They told me I was to\nsee the boy climbing up a rope to the sky. I may say here that while\nI knew this to be a wonderful trick and had read of it in books I did\nnot know that but few people had seen it, and I have, ever since,\nblamed myself for not noting details with more care.\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1932\n\" The performance which had gone before had been carried through\nby the three younger members of the group, the old man contenting\nhimself with droning on some pipes. In this matter however the old\nman took complete charge.\n\" He asked for four saucers which he placed at the corners of a\nsquare of about 6' x 6'. In the centre of the square he placed a\nshallow earthenware vessel, about 15\" in diameter. The boy stripped\noff everything except a '\nlangooty '\nand string. The old man poured\nsome grayish powder into the saucers and central chatty.\n\" He insisted that if Daniel was to watch he must sit close to me\nso he squatted between my feet, he also stipulated for dead silence,\nno smoking, and we were both to watch him carefully.\n\" He put a match to the powders, and from all the vessels arose a\nthin column of rather pungent smoke. He then took a fine rope,\ncoiled it, and held it in his right hand. The boy kept close to him the\nwhole time and copied every movement he made.\n\" He then squatted down and kept up a sort of incantation, mak-\ning passes with his hands. (These passes were not out of the ordinary\nbut of the type usually made by jugglers when at work.) In the\nmeantime the man and woman were busy on the tom-toms. This\nwent on for some time until I got rather bored ; but was afraid to\ntake my eyes off him as I expected something to happen any mo-\nment. Suddenly he moved towards the centre column of smoke\nkeeping his eyes on us throughout, and after what seemed a short\ntime, flung the rope into the air. The boy sprang for the rope and\ndisappeared up the rope through the smoke column. The whole\nthing was very quick, he seemed to go up, dwindle and disappear.\nI remember it was a case of the boy being hauled up by, rather than\nclimbing, the rope, for his position as I saw him was that of a man\nbeing lowered on a rope with his foot in a loop of it, one arm out-\nstretched holding the rope above, the other arm by his side. He\njust disappeared rope and all. The tom-toms had been worked up\nto a roar and then .suddenly ceased.\n\" When I looked down again the old man was sitting calmly op-\nposite with a smile on his face. The boy was not to be seen but\npresently the woman cupped her hands and called, and the boy ap-\npeared on the hill nearby. This was a high hill about as high as that\non which the old bungalow at W. [a place known to me. E.F.]\nrested, although much more precipitous. That is all I can tell you\nof what I saw. Daniel saw all I saw, and was worried declaring it\nto be '\ndevil's work'.\n\" The old man declined discussion on the trick simply asking for\nhis fee. which he got.\n\" Daniel and myself were the only onlookers, my other servants\nhaving gone away for the day. Daniel declared he felt ill and had\n\fJuly 1932 More Alleged Occurrences of the Rope-Trick 283\na bad head that night and next day, but knowing Daniel to be rather\nfond of master's whiskey I put this down to what I found had always\npreviously been the cause of such heads. I did not time it, but the\nwhole affair took about half an hour. The time was between 5.30\nand 6 p.m. The old man was really aged, though fairly active, and\nI should have put him down as 80 and over.\"\n22 February 1932.\n\" The following answers to your questions may help you. (1) The\naccount was made from memory, but the details were planted in my\nmind when I wrote a letter at the time describing it to my father.\n\" (2) When I say '\nfine '\nrope I mean a rope of ordinary thickness,\nof say \\ inch to f inch in diameter. I did not examine the rope, but\nfrom what I remember it was of ordinary make.\n\"\n(3) No, the smoke was not thick enough to obscure the boy. I\ncould not say to what height the boy went, but he certainly grew\nless and less, until he vanished. The rope seemed to go with the\nboy.\n\" (4) I did not see the end of the rope for all my attention was\nriveted on the boy.\n\" (5) The rope vanished with the boy, nor did I see it again, and\nI did not examine it.\n\" (6) As regards the time taken from when the man flung up the\nrope to when the boy and rope disappeared I could not rightly say,\nbut it seemed a matter of very few seconds.\n\" (7) As regards the height of the hill, an active boy could have\ngot to the top of it easily in five minutes. It must have been the\nsame boy for it was a lonely place, and no other people could have\nbeen '\npressed '\ninto the service of the jugglers. I cannot of course\nsay how long it was before the boy appeared ; but it seemed almost\nat once after I looked down that the woman called out, and he ap-\npeared.\n\" (8) As to whether at the time everything seemed quite normal\nlike a conjuring trick, or whether I felt as if I had been bemused or\nmade the victim of an optical illusion, it seemed to me an ordinary\ntrick which I could not explain, and I do not remember ever thinking\nI was in any way bewitched, or bemused.\n\" (9) At that time of year the days were short : I do not remember\nwhat the light was like, but it was usually dark by 6 to 6.10 p.m. in\nDecember. The sunset I could not see at any time from the bungalow\nsite as the country was very broken.\"\nI wrote further to ask if the report to his father was extant and\nwhether he could not say approximately whether the boy went up\n10 feet high or 20 or 50 or 100. Also, as it seemed to me impossible\nthat a rope hanging from the sky with a boy disappearing up it could\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1932\nappear like an ordinary trick, whether there was nothing about it\nthat seemed abnormal.\nTo this he replied :\n25 February 1932.\n\" I am sorry to say the account I wrote for my father is not extant.\n\" (2) I'm afraid it is very disappointing, but I cannot state any\ngiven height [to which the boy seemed to go]. The boy disappeared,\nand as he disappeared decreased in size so that the height must have\nbeen well over the maximum you instance.\n'*\n(3) I was only 23 years of age when I saw this trick performed,\nand at the time did not consider it any more wonderful than that\none of placing a boy in a basket, piercing him with swords, the boy\npresently appearing perfectly sound and intact from the bottom of\nthe garden although one had never taken one's eyes from the basket\ninto which he had originally stepped. As I say, I was young at the\ntime and did not appreciate the wonder I was being shown.\n\" No, I cannot say there was anything which seemed abnormal\nto me.\"\nUp to this point, I had abstained from reminding my friend of\nanything he had told me before. As I have said it was about 20\nyears ago, but my recollection of the account he then gave me was\nabsolutely clear on two points, viz. that the height of the rope did\nnot exceed 10-12 feet and that when he looked at the top of it it\nseemed muzzy, i.e. not normal. The difference was so striking that\nI asked whether the mythopoeic faculty had been at work in his\nmind or in mine. He replied :\n7 March 1932.\n\" I fear it is in my mind, not yours, that the mythopoeic faculty\nis at work. There is no doubt as regards the rope not being a long\none, for the coil I saw was small, so my memory as regards the\nending of the trick is probably faulty, and what I told you some\ntwenty years back (very nearly) would be more exact. There is no\ndoubt that Daniel my servant considered himself bemused : but as\nfor myself, whether my memory through distance has become\nwarped I cannot say, but I am quite unable to remember whether\nmy vision of the boy was clear or foggy at the moment he disappeared.\n\" Now that you mention the fact I clearly remember telling you\nwhat you write and that is, I should say, probably what is correct.\nOne tells these stories (based on fact) to people who murmur '\nHow\nwonderful ' and forget all about them, and one is therefore rather\ninclined to slur actual detail happenings and in time forget what to\nthe keen analyst of such matters are the main essentials, so you must\nforgive me if I have disappointed you.\"\nWell it certainly is disappointing, but even the account as my\n\fJuly 1932 More Alleged Occurrences of the Rope-Trick 285\nfriend first told it me years ago was sufficiently impressive to make\nit probable that the trick he saw was something very difEerent from\nthat described in the book which has given rise to this discussion\n(see my review in Journal S.P.R., May 1932, xxvii, 261).\nSince writing the above my attention has been called to some\ncorrespondence about this trick which appeared in the Morning\nPost at the end of January 1932, amongst others from MrsPennell-\nWilliamson, of Boscombe, who supplemented her account in a letter\nto myself. She refers to an occasion 35 years ago when she saw the\nrope-trick in Mussoorie in Northern India. Her version differs from\nH.A.'s in that she says the boy climbed up the rope hand over hand\nand vanished at the top at a height of from 20 to 30 feet, coming\nback after a few moments from another part of the grounds of a\nhotel, from a window on the first floor of which she viewed it. This\nlady is of opinion that the effect was one of some hypnotic influence.\nVarious officers wrote to the Morning Post maintaining that the\nrope-trick was purely a myth, chiefly on the ground that although\nthey had offered rewards for its performance no one had ever come\nforward to claim them. Reference, however, was made by one\ncorrespondent to Lord Frederick Hamilton's book Here, There and\nEverywhere, published in 1921, which contains a story told to the\nauthor by Colonel Barnard, at one time chief of police in Calcutta,\nwho with an English subordinate saw what purported to be the\ntrick. Colonel Barnard, having never seen the rope-trick, had in-\nstructed his policemen to inform him of the arrival in Calcutta of any\njuggler professing to do it. At length the police told him that a\nman able to perform the trick had come and would show it on con-\ndition that Colonel Barnard should be accompanied by one friend\nonly. The Colonel took with him one of his English subordinates ;\nhe also took his Kodak. They arrived at a poor house in the native\nquarter, where they were ushered into a courtyard thick with dense\nsmoke rising from two braziers burning mysterious compounds. The\njuggler, naked except for his loincloth, appeared and commenced\nsalaaming profoundly, continuing his salaams for some little while.\nEventually he produced \" a long coil of rope. To Colonel Barnard's\nsurprise the rope began paying away, as sailors would say, out of\nthe juggler's hand of its own accord, and went straight up into the\nair. Colonel Barnard Kodaked it. It went up and up, till their eyes\ncould no longer follow it. Colonel Barnard Kodaked it again. Then\na small boy, standing by the juggler, commenced climbing up this\nrope, suspended to nothing, supported by nothing. He was Kodaked.\nThe boy went up and up, till he disappeared from view.\n\" The juggler, professing himself angry with the boy for his\ndilatoriness, started in pursuit of him up this rope, hanging to noth-\ning. He was Kodaked, too. Finally, the man descended the rope\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1932\nand wiped a blood-stained knife, explaining that he had killed the\nboy for disobeying his orders. He then pulled the rope down and\ncoiled it up, and suddenly the boy reappeared.\n\" The two Europeans returned home absolutely mystified. Colonel\nBarnard went into his dark room and developed his negatives.\nNeither the juggler, nor the boy, nor the rope had moved at all. The\nphotographs of the ascending rope, of the boy climbing it, and of the\nman following him, were simply blanks, showing the details of the\ncourtyard and nothing else. Nothing whatever had happened : but\nhow, in the name of all that is wonderful, had the impression been\nconveyed to two hard-headed, matter-of-fact Englishmen ?\n\"\nI have no means of judging whether when Colonel Barnard told\nhis story to Lord Frederick Hamilton or when the latter wrote his\nbook the mythopoeic faculty had been at work on one or other of\nthem, as seems to have been the case with my friend H.A. It will\nbe noticed that in two respects their accounts tally, i.e. the smoke-\nproducing powder or herbs, and the impression that the rope went\nup of itself. Through another correspondent of the Morning Post,\nMr F. I). Logan, I was referred to an account of the trick in the\njournal of the great Moorish traveller, Ibn Battuta, who went to\nChina in about 1345 and records how he there saw a juggler take a\nwooden ball with holes in which were long leather thongs and throw\nit in the air till it rose right out of sight,\u2014the audience were sitting\nin the Palace Court during the hot season\u2014when nothing remained\nin his hand but a short piece of the cord [or thong]. He then ordered\nan apprentice to go up the cord until he too disappeared from sight.\nThe juggler called him three times without receiving any reply, so he\ntook a knife and climbed up till he disappeared as well. He then\nthrew down the boy's hands, feet and trunk, and finally his head and\nthen came down himself puffing and blowing and smeared with blood.\nAfter saluting Ibn Battuta's host, an Emir, he placed the boy's limbs\ntouching one another and gave them a kick, when he rose up as sound\nas ever. This so amazed Ibn Battuta that he got a palpitation of the\nheart, so they gave him a potion, and then a Cadi sitting next to him\ntold him that there was no climbing or coming down or cutting up of\nlimbs at all, but that the whole thing was hocus-pocus.\nThis is only one of many accounts of marvels performed by fakirs\nin Ibn Battuta's presence in India and China, which in the 14th cen-\ntury would have offered a rich field of work for the S.P.R.\nON A SITTING WITH RUM SCHNEIDER.\nBy William Brown, M.D., D.Sc, F.R.C.P.\nOwing to the appearance in the popular press of highly-coloured\nreports of my recent experiences with Rudi Schneider, I felt it\n\fJuly 1032 On a Sitting with Rudi Schneider 287\ndesirable to publish an accurate description over my own signature\nas promptly as possible. For this reason I contributed the following\ntwo letters to The Times of 7 May and 14 May respectively. The first\nletter gives an objective account of the \" phenomena \" which I wit-\nnessed, and my immediate mental reactions to them. The second\nsets out the results of a week's hard thinking and reflection on the\nwhole experience, and states my considered opinion about it.\nI may add that I was present at one or two \" successful \" sittings\nwith Rudi Schneider three years ago, and have had many unsuccess-\nful or \" negative \" sittings with him before the remarkable sitting to\nwhich these letters refer.\nI. From The Times of 7 May 1932.\nSir,\u2014As a certain amount of publicity, unsolicited by me, has\nbeen accorded to a striking experience which I had last Tuesday\nnight at the National Laboratory for Psychical Research, I should\nlike to give a brief record of my impressions in your journal, while they\nare still fresh in my memory. A detailed record of every incident was\nmade at the time by a shorthand writer, but that is another matter.\nI was one of a circle of seven people at a seance with Rudi Schneider,\nthe Austrian medium. We sat, holding hands, in front of a \"cabinet\",\nor small recess, curtained off by two heavy curtains edged with\nluminous strips, with the medium to the side, about 2 ft. from the\nleft-hand curtain, and fully controlled as to hands, feet, and head by\none of the sitters. A shaded red lamp hung in front of the curtains,\nand on the floor in front of them, illuminated by the red rays, was a\nsmall table with a detachable top on which was placed a knotted\nhandkerchief. A luminous waste-paper basket was also near by. In-\nside the cabinet, on the floor, were vases containing different kinds\nof flowers\u2014daffodils, anemones, etc. I searched the cabinet care-\nfully and found nothing else there. Then the room was plunged into\ndarkness, apart from the red light, and Rudi went into a trance char-\nacterised by rapid breathing, which was kept up over long periods\nof time. His trance personality, \" Olga \", appeared and spoke in\nwhispered German.\nLater the curtains began to shake and billow out as if blown by\na breeze, and we had a feeling of cold. After some experiences with\nthe basket, which \" Olga \" directed me to place on my knees and\nthen to hold near the curtain, and which was moved and tugged by\nsome unseen agency, sounds of movement seemed to come from the\nsmall table, and a loud bang was heard in a far corner of the room.\nSubsequently, on turning up the light, we found that the detachable\ntop had been hurled over our heads into that corner, and that the\nknotted handkerchief had been transported over our heads into the\nopposite corner of the room.\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1932\nThen a mass of flowers suddenly emerged from the curtains at a\nlevel of about 4 ft. from the floor and fell under the red lamp. They\nhad been caught up from the vases in the cabinet by some unseen\nagency. Mr Harry Price, the director of the laboratory, who was\nsitting immediately in front of the shaded red light, was asked by\n\" Olga \" to hold a flower by its head, with the stalk pointing towards\nthe curtains, under the red light. It then disappeared towards the\ncabinet. I was asked to do the same with another flower. I felt an\nimpact at the end of the stalk, and then the flower was drawn from\nme into the darkness. These were the outstanding events of the sit-\nting. I could find no evidence of fraud or trickery, and, while retain-\ning an alert and critical attitude of mind throughout, I had a strong\nfeeling of some mysterious power working from within the cabinet,\na power for which I could imagine no mechanical or pneumatic con-\ntrivance as a cause\u2014at least such as would be possible under the con-\nditions of the seance.\nI have had sittings with many other \" physical \" mediums, and in\nno case have received the impression of genuineness in their manifes-\ntations such as I had with Rudi last Tuesday night. Undoubtedly\nthe phenomena are worthy of the closest scientific investigation.\nI am, Sir, yours faithfully,\nWilliam Brown.\nII. From The Times of 14 May 1932.\nSir,\u2014In my letter of last Saturday I endeavoured to give a con-\ncise, accurate account of a \" successful \" seance with the young\nAustrian medium Rudi Schneider at which I was present on Tuesday\nnight, 3 May. I briefly described the chief events that occurred and\nalso my own mental reactions to them. At the time I had a feeling\nof conviction that the phenomena could not be accounted for in\nordinary terms\u2014in other words, that they were supernormal. But\nintellectual conviction comes, if at all, only after reflection upon all\nthe relevant circumstances, and this involves in its scope a very wide\ncircle of facts both physical and psychological. Direct observation,\nfree from any inaccuracy, may point imperiously in one direction and\nyet a full consideration of all the circumstances may indicate a differ-\nent interpretation. In psychical research, as in the investigation of\ncrime, circumstantial evidence is of supreme importance.\nMy experiences are paralleled by those of Dr D. Fraser-Harris and\nof all the other sitters (a large number) who were present at one or\nanother of the more successful seances, and I understand that their\nconviction of the genuineness of the phenomena was at least as strong\nas mine. Moreover at the Institut Metapsychique in Paris the\ndirector, Dr Eugene Osty, held a large number of seances with Rudi\nlast year, using infra-red rays and elaborate photo-electric receiving\n\fJuly 1932 On a Sitting with Rudi Schneider 289\napparatus, whereby he seems to have demonstrated absorption of\nsuch rays to the extent of 30 per cent, and more by action at a dis-\ntance under trance conditions. These interesting researches are de-\nscribed in \" Les Pouvoirs Inconnus de l'Esprit sur la Matiere\n\"\n(Librairie Felix Alcan, 1932). Similar results with infra-red rays have\nbeen obtained in one or two sittings here in London with less elab-\norate apparatus.\nNevertheless, one is not relieved from the necessity of the closest\nscrutiny of all the circumstances of these researches, and during the\npast week my mind has hardly ceased from an active review of every\nconceivable aspect of the problem. The human element must be\nclosely considered, the temperament, situation, and motives of every\nperson concerned, both here and abroad, so far as it is at all possible\nto discover them. The order of events, the conditions of the seances,\ncertain observations which seemed insignificant at the time but\nwhich may prove to be important in the light of later events\u2014these\nand many other considerations must play their part in helping one\nto come to a final verdict.\nIn the light of such considerations as these I am still unable to dis-\npute the genuineness of the phenomena that I experienced. On the\nother hand, the extensive lacunae in my knowledge of this wider\ncircle of facts prevent me from going sponsor for the phenomena, in\nspite of their immediate impressiveness. Intellectual conviction can\nonly come, if at all, after a much more stringent scientific investiga-\ntion carried out in a university laboratory or in the seance room of\nthe S.P.R., with trained scientists and psychical researchers as\nsitters. In saying this I am not depreciating the very important pre-\nliminary work that has already been done, both here in England and\non the Continent, but I am emphasising the need of confirmatory\nevidence and of systematic verification. Further knowledge is re-\nquired of the exact physiological and psychological nature of Rudi's\ntrance state, or so-called trance personality \" Olga \"\u2014whether\ngenuine or spurious. An outstanding difficulty in this kind of re-\nsearch, distinguishing it from ordinary scientific research, is that one\nhas to adapt oneself to the whims and preconceptions of the medium\non pain of getting no \" phenomena \". One cannot dictate the condi-\ntions of the investigation, but has to submit to dictation from him\nor from his trance personality. Therefore indirect and hidden con-\ntrol of the investigation needs to be exceptionally stringent and far-\nseeing.\nWhether genuine or spurious, Rudi Schneider's trance manifesta-\ntions are worthy of the closest scientific study, and will well repay\nsuch study.\nI am, Sir, yours faithfully,\nWilliam Brown.\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1932\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF TESTIMONY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nStr,\u2014I have read with interest Mr E. F. Benson's criticism of the\nexperiments in the psychology of testimony published in the last\nnumber of the Proceedings. He does not seem to me to have under-\nstood the point of such experiments. It is generally realised by those\nwho have studied the evidence for the physical phenomena of\nspiritualism that there is a strong tendency in witnesses to take an\nexaggerated view of their own powers of observation and of their\nability to report what they have seen. The only way to convince\nthem of this is to give them the opportunity of comparing their ac-\ncount of what they think they saw or heard on some given occasion,\nwith an authentic account of what actually happened, by the person\nor persons who know this from the inside as it were. And that is\nwhat Mr Besterman endeavoured to do. Of course if he could have\nproduced the expectant atmosphere generally prevalent at a real\nseance as S. J. Davey did, the evidence would be more interesting,\nbut in an experiment conducted under the auspices of the Society it\nwould hardly be permissible to do this. The effectiveness of the\nevidence obtained would be increased by adding to the number and\nvarying the items, but if this is done it will hardly be necessary to\npublish tables of the results every time.\nYours, etc.,\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014In the June Journal Mr E. F. Benson ventures to assume\nthat most of the members of the S.P.R. must have been amazed at\nthe contents of the Society's Proceedings for May 1932. I had formed\na similar opinion, but on other grounds than those put forward by\nMr Benson. I thought that many of our members would have been\nsurprised to learn that the accounts given by intelligent witnesses\nof the events of a short sitting for physical phenomena could be so\nfaulty and so incomplete. Some of our members may not have read\nthe remarkable papers by Hodgson and Davey in Proceedings, vols,\niv and viii and the possibilities of mal-observation and lapse of\nmemory revealed in those papers may be unknown to them. Yet to\nhave knowledge of these possibilities is of the first importance in all\ninvestigations of paraphysical phenomena, and serious students of\npsychical research should welcome Mr Besterman's Report.\nI do not understand how Mr Benson can describe such a report as\nfutile or maintain that there is nothing in it \" however remotely con-\n\fJuly 1032 Correspondent 291\nnected \" with psychical research. In my opinion some knowledge of\nthe psychology of testimony is essential in every form of psychical\nresearch whatsoever.\nYours, etc.,\nT. W. Mitchell.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir.\u2014Mr E. F. Benson's letter in the June issue of the Journal\nprotesting at what he terms the futility of the contents of the\nSociety's Proceedings for May 1932, seems to me to show a very ill-\njudged lack of appreciation of Mr Besterman's experiments. He\ncomplains that the investigations \" only show the comparative\npowers of observing of forty-two unnamed persons.\" But is not that\nthe very crux of psychical research\u2014the powers of observing of\nnamed or unnamed persons 1\nThe great majority of us in these matters must always take our\nevidence second-hand. The bulk of the \" evidence \" collected by\nour Society after fifty years of effort is in the form of reports of per-\nsonal experiences from persons unknown to most of us. Now quite\napart from the bona fides of these witnesses what are their \" powers\nof observing ?\n\" Surely a vital question indeed ! Mr Besterman's\ninvestigations throw a rather disturbing light on the whole matter.\nLook at his tentative conclusions :\nSitters largely ignore disturbances that appear to be irrelevant.\nSitters' reports of auditory conditions . . . are untrustworthy and\nerratic, etc.\nThirteen sitters (out of 42 !) actually experienced illusions ranging\nfrom extreme mal-observation to true hallucinations. Who would\nhave anticipated that result ?\nI venture to assert that far from being futile the whole question is\none that requires the most serious investigation. I, for one, would\nlike to thank the experimenter for undertaking such a dull task and\nI take off my hat to his patient spirit of enquiry.\nYours, etc.\nG. W. Fisk.\nTHE MEDIUM BERT REESE.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I am glad that Dr Prince has now printed his account of his\nsitting with Reese. Any additional information regarding Reese's\nmethods, as well as those of Ludwig Kahn, is valuable, and from\nwhat Dr Prince has recorded it is clear that Reese used several\nmethods in his performances.\nI can, however, hardly agree that Reese's methods, as outlined by\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1932\nDr Prince, were so remarkable. Substitution of one billet for another\nis not so difficult if the first billet can openly be seized. The fact\nthat Reese deliberately took the billet for the purpose of exchange\nweakens his art from the point of view of the conjurer, who would\nnaturally assume that that was the occasion for substitution. Reese's\nfame rests upon an entirely novel method of seizing the billets\nwithout the knowledge of the sitters. This, coupled with a variation of\nthe misdirection noted by Dr Prince, was mainly responsible for the\ntheory that the billets remained untouched. But unfortunately he\ndid not, apparently, work this method before Dr Prince. Had he\ndone so Dr Prince would have been far more impressed by his\n\" marvellous art \". It was probably this method which Kahn also\nused and on which was built up his reputation as a clairvoyant.\nYours, etc.,\nE. J. Dingwall.\n[It is hardly correct to imply that in Reese's sitting with Dr Prince\nthe first billet could be openly seized. On the contrary, it is precisely\nDr Prince's point that it was taken by Reese 'without the sitter's\nknowledge. The method described by Dr Prince is, in essentials,\nprecisely the same as that recorded by previous observers, including\nDr Dingwall (see Zeitschrift fur kritischen Okhultismus, ii. 275 ff\n,\nwhere full references are given, to which may be added an account\ndating from 1926 in the sixth edition of Prof. Max Dessoir's Vom\nJenseits der Seele [1931], pp. 96-8). If, therefore, Dr Dingwall now\nknows of any other method used by Reese, it is to be hoped that he\nwill put it on record. Ed.]\nORIENTAL WORDS IN A DREAM.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014The following experience may interest Members of the\nSociety. In 1929 or 1930 I dreamt that I was standing in the midst\nof a group of people of Oriental nationality in a flat country with\nhills on the horizon\u2014a sort of plateau. The colour of the country\nwas yellowish (hot looking), and the dress of the people with whom\nI was talking was Oriental looking, mostly yellow long garments but\nnot exclusively so, there were light colours and a predominant note of\nyellow in colour both in the landscape and their clothes\u2014but this\nwas not stressed in any way. The point was that they were con-\nsulting me as to the meaning of something or other which had to do\nwith religion. I supposed their religion, and I remember saying to\nmyself, in my dream, \" These people at any rate think religion is\nimportant \". I wondered at their asking me and felt that they did\nnot understand how ignorant I was. The sentence was repeated\n\fJuly 1932 Correspondence 293\nmore than once. In my dream I seemed to understand their con-\nversation but do not remember that I understood this particular\nsentence, which was : Mifta-taleen.\nI have spelt it as I pronounced it in my dream, and as they did.\nI woke up, repeating this sentence, wide awake. I recognised that\nthe words were gibberish, but thought I would memorise them, so\nthat I should know, when I awoke for the day finally. I told myself\nthat the second syllable of the first word was the same as the first\nsyllable of the second word. For, in my dream it was only two words,\nI thought. This enabled me to remember the phrase clearly.\nA few weeks later, I met Mr Lawrence Lockhart, who knows both\nthe Persian and Arabic languages well, and asked him if there was\nany meaning in these words that I had heard in my dream, in any\nOriental language that he knew. He at once said \" Certainly, there\nis\n\"\u2014and wrote out this sentence in Persian and in Arabic . The mean-\ning is the same, he says, in both languagues : miftah-i-fallm, Persian ;\nmiftahu't-faUm, Arabic ;\nmeaning \" The Key of the Teaching \".\nIn my dream, as will be noticed I heard the last letter of the word\nas n, but I might easily have mistaken this.\nMy daughter to whom I told my dream next morning after dream-\ning it confirms me in what I say.\nYours, etc.,\nEmily Baldwin.\nDorothy I. D. Baldwin.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Boston Society for Psychical Research, Bulletin XVI, April 1932.\nThis Bulletin of 135 pages, which contains The Sinclair Experi-\nments demonstrating Telepathy, by Dr W. F. Prince, consists of two\nparts, the first being a careful and critical discussion of the telepathic\nexperiments, chiefly in the transference of rough drawings, conducted\nby Mr and Mrs Upton Sinclair, she being the percipient. It may be\nremembered that Mr Sinclair's book about them entitled Mental\nRadio was reviewed in our Proceedings, vol. xxxix. Dr Prince, how-\never, had before him more material than we had, for he had prac-\ntically the whole of the original notes of the experiments described\nin the book and of a number carried out since, including some in\nwhich Professor McDougall was the agent. Moreover he himself\narranged a series of experiments in guessing without the aid of tele-\npathy, using one of the telepathic series as a standard of comparison.\nThe result was very much in favour of telepathy as against chance.\nIn this part Mrs Sinclair also described the conditions she finds\nfavourable to telepathic success.\nWe cannot in the space at our disposal describe Mrs Sinclair's\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1932\nvaluable experiments in more detail nor speak at length of the\nsecond part of Dr Prince's study. This he describes us \" Some His-\ntorical Data of Experiments for Telepathy, especially by means of\ndrawings.\" He here discusses in detail a number of published series\nof telepathic experiments mostly published in our Proceedings from\nearly days onwards, though some published elsewhere. And he also\ngives references to some which he does not describe in detail. It is\na useful reminder for students of the subject of what has been done.\nBut the whole Bulletin and the discussion of the Sinclair experi-\nments in particular, will be of great value to psychical research if it\nstirs up possible percipients to try what they can do in telepathy,\nfor more experimentation is greatly needed.

Warcollier compares such drawings or\ndiagrams with those of children and primitives, noting analogies and\ndiscrepancies.\n\" Rhabdomancy \" or the divining-rod is much to the front in the\nshape chiefly of the first two instalments of a long paper by Professor\nCazzamali of Milan. This paper, chiefly theoretical, deals also with\nthe experiments made on 16 March 1931 at the Verona stadion with\neight Italian dowsers. The results obtained Professor Cazzamali\ndescribes as \" excellent \" in four cases and \" negative \" or \" poor\n\"\nin the other four. It is unfortunate that the experiments were to\nsome extent undoubtedly vitiated\u2014as pointed out by Professor\nCazzamali himself\u2014by the presence of the three engineers who had\nprepared the nine artificial \" zones \" or \" camps \" to be explored\n(p. 345).\nDr Osty deals with cases where people \" foresee \" their own death.\nHis conclusion is that such cases are not explicable as \" mere\ncellular warnings giving to the mind the certainty that the body will\nsoon cease to exist \" ; and he thinks the cause to lie in \" the cryptic\nintelligence for which time and space are not barriers to knowledge.\"\nThe recent experiments with Rudi Schneider at the Paris Meta-\npsychical Institute are dealt with by the same author in another\npreliminary and very brief statement which promises us detailed\nresults in a few months.

CASE OF HAUNTING AT RAMSBURY, WILTS.\nWe have received the following account of a case of haunting from\nLord Balfour and Mr Piddington, signed by them both.\nIn June 1931, a man named Samuel Bull, by occupation a chim-\nney-sweep, died in his cottage in Oxford Street, Ramsbury. His\nwidow continued to live in the same cottage with a grandson, James\nBull, and soon after her husband's death became bed-ridden.\nIn August 1931, a married daughter of the widow came to live\nwith her mother at the cottage in Oxford Street, as well as her\nhusband and five children.\nIn February 1932, the hauntings described below began : the\napparition of Samuel Bull being seen by the members of the family.\nOn 3 April 1932 Lord Selborne was given a verbal account of the\nhauntings by Admiral Hyde Parker, who lives at Ramsbury, and\non 6 April he wrote to Lord Balfour to say that Admiral Hyde\nParker would be willing to answer any communication from the\nS.P.R. On 7 April, Lord Balfour wrote to Admiral Hyde Parker,\nand on 11 April received from him a letter from which the extract\nthat follows is taken :\n\" I at once got into touch with our Vicar (Rev. G. H.

They complained that there was\nsomeone outside the door, and were very nervous.\nNo one was there, however, i.e. no visible presence, but the con-\nditions continued, and a little later the deceased man was seen to\nascend the stairs and pass through a door, which was shut, into the\nroom in which he died, and in which Mrs Bull, the widow, had been\nlying for some time until it was condemned as unsafe, and which at\nthe time of the apparition's first appearance was shut up and unused.\nThe apparition was seen by Mrs Edwards and the grandson (aged\n21) and then by all the others, widow and grandchildren.\nAt first everyone was terrified and the children screamed, but later,\nand on subsequent occasions, were calmer, but in a state of quiet\nawe.\nThe '\nappearances '\nhave been very frequent since, but no diary\nhas been kept of dates and happenings.\nAll the questions submitted by Lord Balfour I had already put to\nMrs Edwards and the family, and had received consistent, satis-\nfactory, and in most cases quite clear and definite answers, but in\none or two cases they had found it difficult to express in words their\nown experiences.\nI once again, on receipt of the series of questions asked by Lord\nBalfour, asked Mrs Edwards to answer all these questions in the\norder in which they were set down, and again I received answers\nwhich were perfectly consistent with her earlier statements and were\nexactly the same except in one case, question No. 6, where an inter-\nesting development is noted.\nThe following are the answers received :\n1. Particulars of real names and address {not necessarily for pub-\nlication) and dates :\nDeceased man : Samuel Bull\u2014who appears ;\nWidow : Mary Jane Bull (aged invalid confined to her bed);\nDaughter : Mrs Edwards ;\nSon-in-law : Mr Edwards ;\nGrandson : James Bull\n;\nGrandchildren : Five girls and boys\u2014the eldest a girl nearly\n14 years\n;\nAll living in Oxford Street, Bamsbury. No particulars of actual\ndates have been kept.\n2. Have several members of the family seen the apparition at the\nsame time when they were together ?\nYes. All members together. Even the smallest girl (5 years ?)\nwho recognised the apparition as '\nGrandpa Bull '.\n\fOctober 1932 Case of Haunting at Ramsbury, Wilts 299\n3. Have any members seen it when others did not ?\nYes. When some members have been absent, such as children at\nschool, husband at work, etc., but when the apparition comes all\nwho are present can see, and apparently can see equally well.\n4. Details concerning the apparition. Is its appearance more or\nless as in life, and solid ? Can they see the features clearly ?\nYes, as in life, dressed as he usually was in the evenings when he\nhad finished work.\nYes, solid, though only one member has felt him, that is the\nwidow. The apparition invariably goes to a position by the bed and\nlays his hand upon the forehead of the widow. Mrs Bull says the\nhand is firm but cold.\nYes, the features are clearly recognised (as instanced by the\nchild in answer 2 ) . Mrs Edwards has said that the thing which seemed\nto fascinate her most was the appearance of his '\npoor hands,'\nbecause the knuckles seemed to be protuding through the skin.\n5. Is any colour visible ? Is it heard as well as seen ? Have any\nof the family felt as if touched ?\nThe family find it difficult to say anything as to colour. (I think\nthis is due to the dim fight in the house and the more or less drab\ncolour of his clothes whilst alive\u2014see answer to question 4\u2014but Mrs\nEdwards spoke of the '\nmuffler '\nhe was wearing as being different\nin colour from the rest of the clothes.)\nOnly the widow has felt the touch. (See answer to question 4.)\n6. 7s the apparition seen, heard or felt (a) in daylight, (b) in artificial\nlight, (c) in twilight, (d) in darkness ?\nThe apparition has been seen at all times of the day and of the\nnight, but only seen at times of darkness because there were candles\nburning. See Note A below.\n7. Was there any sense of alarm felt at first ? Was it seen by one\nperson only or by more than one on the first occasion ?\nYes, there was alarm at first. See prefatory note.\nIt was seen first by Mrs Edwards and almost immediately after\nby Jimmy\u2014the grandson of 21 years.\n8. Had the man ever said in life that he would try to reappear after\ndeath ?\nNo. The '\nappearance '\nhas come as a great shock to the family.\nNote A.\u2014All the statements bore testimony to the sadness of\nthe apparition's appearance. They '\nunderstood '\nthat the deceased\nwas grieved at their forlorn condition, but the last two appearances\nhave changed considerably and he seems much happier. This is\nbelieved to be due to the possibility that the family might soon go\ninto a Council house, and so be in happier circumstances.\nWith reference to answer to question 6. I had asked Mrs Edwards\nsome time ago whether the apparition were luminous\u2014but she said\nx2\n\fsoo Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\n'\nNo '. When he appeared at night, though they felt his presence,\nthey could not see him without artificial light.\nBut now Mrs Edwards says, since this change in him he is lighter.\nI asked, '\nDo you mean that he shines with a light of his own ?\n'\nShe answered, '\nI can hardly tell, but I think so '. I asked, '\nIf\nhe were to come in the middle of the night do you think you would\nsee him without the help of your candle 1\n'\nShe answered '\nYes, I\nbelieve I should.'\nThere was genuine grief at the sadness of his appearance before,\nand now there is as genuine gladness at the change that has taken\nplace.\nNote B.\u2014The family always know the '\npresence '\nis there for half\nan hour or more before anybody sees him. They are conscious of a\npeculiar restlessness or stirring or expectancy. Mrs Edwards says,\n'\nI feel as though I am expecting my brother from America, or\nsomething like that '.\nNote C.\u2014There is some hope that the family might be moving into\na Council house in a few days time, and in that case the apparition\nmight cease to appear, especially as the owner intends to put the\nhouse into condition, which will involve very considerable disturb-\nance of present conditions. So if the S.P.R. propose to make any\ninvestigation there is no time to be lost.\nMrs Edwards will be very pleased to do all in her power to facilitate\nan investigation.\n(Signed) Geo. H. Hackett,\n9 April 1932. Vicar of Ramsbury.\nExtra Notes.\u2014The appearances are not fleeting, but quite\nlengthy, and [on] one occasion at least, lasted for several hours.\nMrs Bull had faithfully nursed the deceased for four years before\nhe '\npassed '\nfrom sooty cancer.\"\nOn 14 April, Lord Balfour and Mr Piddington went to Ramsbury,\nand had a long interview at Admiral Hyde Parker's house with the\nAdmiral and Mr Hackett, the Vicar. During this interview the\nVicar gave them the following information :\n1. With regard to the statement contained in the Note attached\nto his report to the effect that on one occasion the apparition\n\" lasted for several hours \", the Vicar explained that he had meant\nby this that the figure appeared off and on during several hours.\n2. The widow once heard the ghost say \" Jane \"\u2014that being her\nname.\n3. The first to see the apparition were Mrs Edwards and her\nnephew of 21 years old, and they saw it on the same occasion. [See,\nhowever, below for Mrs Edwards's own statement which differs\nfrom the above.]\n\fOctober 1932 Case of Haunting at Ramsbury, Wilts 301\n4. In reply to the question \" What grounds have the family for\nthinking that the apparition has any connexion with the unsatis-\nfactory state of the cottage ?\n\" the Vicar said he thought that they\nhad no grounds beyond \" sheer inference \".\n5. When the children complained of there being \" some one out-\nside the door \", they did not, the Vicar understands, hear any\nnoise ; nor has any noise been heard by other members of the\nfamily, with the exception of the widow, who, as mentioned above,\nonce heard her name spoken.\n6. When asked whether any members of the family have been\ninterested in Spiritualism, the Vicar said \" No \" ; and he returned\nthe same answer when asked whether any members of the family have\nhad previously any experiences similar to the present ones.\n7. Mrs Edwards, with whom the Vicar had had a talk earlier in\nthe morning of 14 April, had spontaneously told him that the\nappearances take a great deal out of the members of the family, and\nespecially out of old Mrs Bull. She also told him spontaneously\nthat Mrs Bull often sees the figure ; and that the last appearance\nhad been on Saturday, 9 April.\n8. In reply to the suggestion that the whole story might have been\nconcocted for the purpose of arousing sympathy with the family on\naccount of the wretched conditions in which they were living, and so\nincrease the chances of their obtaining better accommodation, the\nVicar said that, in the first place, he believed in the good faith of the\nwitnesses, and, in the second place, that any such plot might well\nhave had just the opposite result to that desired. He added, how-\never, that the family might, of course, have miscalculated the out-\ncome of a manoeuvre of the kind.\n9. Lord Selborne in his letter to Lord Balfour had written as\nfollows :\n\" The Admiral seemed to regard the family as telling the\ntruth, but he emphasised the fact that no strangers have ever seen\nthe apparition though they have been in the room when all the\nfamily said they saw him.\" Admiral Hyde Parker said that Lord\nSelborne must have misunderstood him ; and that so far as he knew\nno strangers had ever been present during the appearances. The\nVicar agreed.\nAt 2.55 p.m. Admiral Hyde Parker, Mr Hackett, Lord Balfour\nand Mr Piddington called at the cottage, and had a minute or two's\nconversation with Mrs Edwards, downstairs. They then all went\nupstairs into a bedroom where Mrs Bull was lying in bed, Mrs\nEdwards taking with her her youngest child\u2014the only one of her\nchildren who was at home at the time.\nThey found the cottage completely dismantled, the only furniture\nleft being the bed in which Mrs Bull was lying and a single chair.\nThe dilapidated state of the cottage was apparent. The family were\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\nactually engaged that day in moving into one of the local District\nCouncil houses.\nIn Mrs. Bull's bedroom an interview then took place which lasted\nabout 40 minutes. In the course of it a number of questions were\nput to Mrs Edwards and answered by her. Mrs Bull answered one\nor two questions.\nAppended is a summary of what Mrs Edwards and Mrs Bull said.\nSummary of Interview.\nOn 21 June 1931, Samuel Bull died. His daughter, Mrs Edwards,\ncame to live with her widowed mother in August 1931, as did also\nher husband and five children.\nThe first experience occurred after three of the children, who had\npreviously been sleeping in the grandmother's bedroom, had been\nmoved to a room downstairs because one, or perhaps two, of the\nchildren had got influenza. The children had been at least a fort-\nnight downstairs before they experienced anything unusual. It was\nwhen Mary, a girl who will be 14 next June, was down with in-\nfluenza\u2014and she was the last of the children to catch it\u2014that the\nghost was first seen by Mrs Edwards and Mary. It was shortly\nafterwards that Mrs Edwards and the grandson, James Bull, aged\n21, saw the apparition together. Mrs Bull, when she heard that Mrs\nEdwards and Mary had seen the apparition, said to Mrs Edwards\nthat she had seen it before.\nMrs Edwards said that the date when Mary was ill could be ascer-\ntained by the Vicar, as be could find out when Mary was absent\nfrom school.\nWhen Mrs Edwards and James Bull saw the figure on the same\noccasion, Mrs Edwards, as soon as she saw it, told him that she was\nseeing it.\nMrs Edwards said that all the members of the family, including\nher husband, had seen the figure.\nThe figure appears to be quite life-like to Mrs Edwards. It does\nnot glide, but walk, and seems solid. She spontaneously described\nthe appearance of the hands and knuckles, her statement agreeing\nwith the one reported by the Vicar under question 4 above.\nMrs Edwards said that when the appearances began she was more\nfrightened than the children.\nAfter describing the feeling of restlessness and expectancy that\nprecedes her visions of the figure, Mrs Edwards added that after\nthe ghost has disappeared she feels more composed.\nMrs Bull said that she had twice felt the hand of the ghost on her\nbrow. It felt cold. She also said that she had heard the ghost call\nher \" Jane \" once.\n\fOctober 1932 Case of Haunting at Ramsbury, Wilts 303\nQuestioned as to whether any members of the family had ever\nhad any experiences of a psychical kind, Mrs Edwards said that her\nfather, Samuel Bull, had had a premonition of the death of one of\nhis sons, who died as a prisoner of war at Mons. She gave details\nof her father's premonition, which, however, it is not necessary to\nreproduce here.\nWhen asked about the duration of the appearances, Mrs Edwards\nsaid that on one occasion the figure must have been visible for half-\nan-hour continuously.\nMrs Edwards was a good witness. She answered the questions\nput to her simply, naturally, readily and briefly.\nThe interview ended at about 3.40 p.m.\nThe account of the interview with Admiral Hyde Parker and Mr\nHackett, and the account of the interview with Mrs Edwards and\nMrs Bull, were written out by Mr Piddington on 15 April 1932, and\nare based on memoranda that he made at the time.\nThe Vicar undertook to seek an opportunity of interrogating the\nhusband, Mr Edwards, later, on which any excitement that the inter-\nview with Mrs Edwards might have caused had died down.\nOn 31 May 1932, the Vicar wrote to Mr Piddington as follows :\n\" Thank you for your letter. I did not hurry to obtain the signa-\ntures to this statement, first because you advised me not to hurry,\nand secondly because I thought that it would be a further test of\nsome value if I allowed a considerable time to elapse before returning\nto the subject with the family, as it seemed to me that memory was\nlikely to be less stable in regard to a mere statement, especially a\nfalse statement, than it would be in regard to an actual experience.\nMoreover, the aged widow has been extremely ill lately\u2014her\n'\npassing '\nis imminent\u2014and it was hardly seemly to press the family\nat such a time.\nHowever, since receiving your letter I have watched for an oppor-\ntunity, and it came to-day, when the husband happened to be at\nhome.\nI had the statement with me, and was able, quite naturally, to\nopen the subject.\nEvery question was answered as naturally as before and with as\nmuch conviction and appearance of truthfulness. Both Mrs Edwards\nand her husband were perfectly ready and willing to sign the state-\nment, which I read over to them before the signing.\nI regret that the signatures are not in ink. My own pen stubbornly\nTefused to serve and the only medium they could provide was a\nstumpy pencil.\nNothing has happened in the new home. . . .\n(Signed) Geo. H. Hackett.\"\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\nThe following is endorsed on the back of the Vicar's report :\n\" The following is the signature of Mrs Edwards (referred to in\nthe foregoing) and also of Mr Edwards her husband, testifying to the\ncorrectness of the statement. The whole statement was read to them\nimmediately before signing.\n(Signed) Mary Jane Edwards.\nHenry John Edwards.\nThese signatures were obtained in the house of Mrs Edwards, and\nare in pencil because they had no ink in the house at the time.\nThe signatures were made in my presence, to-day, May 31st 1932.\n(Signed) Geo. H. Hackett,\nVicar of Ramsbury.\"\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF TESTIMONY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Your correspondent (Journal, xxvii. 278) alleges that the\nexperimental sittings by Mr Besterman \" yield no results whatever\nas to the investigation of the most '\nfavourable conditions for ob-\nservation '\nwhich was their avowed object.\" His ground for this\nview is that \" the procedure at all these sittings was identical.\"\nApparently his thought is that the conditions of some of the experi-\nments should have been \" most favourable \" and of others less\nfavourable for observation, and that the results of questioning after\nthese respectively should have been compared. But, as I under-\nstand it, Mr Besterman wished to see what the answers would be\nrelative to a set of experiments uniformly under the \" most favour-\nable conditions for observation \" compared with the mass of re-\nported experiments with persons actually claiming to produce super-\nnormal physical phenomena. Let B stand for the Besterman experi-\nments, X for the stock sittings with physical mediums, and make a\nfew of the comparisons possible. (1) B sitters in advance notified by\na letter to expect no supernormal phenomena ; X sitters most com-\nmonly incited in advance to expect supernormal phenomena. (2) B\nsittings prefaced by a warning that that \" medium \" is not a real\none, and a statement expressly intended to put sitters on their guard\nto observe critically ; X sitters met at the start by the assumption\nthat the medium is a real one, and usually subjected to a barrage of\nremarks from medium and presumed spirit control calculated (in-\ntentionally or not) to lull their suspicions and put them in an un-\ncritical frame of mine. (3) B sitters expressly told that their attention\nis to be confined to the what, to the exclusion of the how ; X sitters\n\fOctober 1932 Correspondence 305\nin duty bound to have their attention divided between the what and\nthe how. (4) B sittings but 25 minutes long, not long enough seriously\nto enfeeble the sitters' powers of attention ; X sittings usually two\nhours long, often much longer. (5) B sittings proceed to phenomena\nat once ; in X sittings often phenomena do not occur for half an\nhour, an hour, or more, when already the threshold of attention is\nlowered. (6) In B sittings abstention from any misleading suggest-\nions, with one exception ; in X sittings full latitude for misleading\nsuggestions. (7) In B sittings the phenomena (acts) comparatively\nfew ; in X sittings the phenomena (including the acts of the medium\nand such of others as must be taken into account) probably aver-\naging twenty times as many. (8) In B sittings some of the most im-\nportant phenomena taking place in full light ; in X sittings all the\nimportant phenomena usually occurring in darkness or bad light.\nThese points will be enough. Now if under these comparatively\n\" most favourable conditions for observation \" all the sitters forget\nmore or less of what occurred and many of them observe or remem-\nber things otherwise than as they occurred, it is certain that under\nless favourable conditions for observation\u2014those of the ordinary\nsitting\u2014things will be observed and reported not in better but in\nstill more peccable fashion. Is it of no \" possible interest \", when\nwe read the reports of Tom, Dick or Harry on what he saw and heard\nat a sitting for teleplasm, or materialisation, or slate-writing, to\nknow that with most people the bodily senses can be deceived, and\nthat the memory will fail to record some essential facts and will\nrecord others in muddled or quite erroneous fashion ?\nIt is not uncommon to read that in a particular experiment with a\nphysical medium one or two persons claim to have observed an\nincriminating or suspicious act, while all the others present did not\nsee it and express their disbelief in its occurrence, although the\nlight was poor and both particular skill and a particular location\nwere the requisites for observing the disputed act. Readers may be\n\" amazed \", but is it of no \" possible interest \" and of no value to\nlearn that in an experimental test where we know exactly what in\nfact was done, out of the details of an incident occurring in full light,\nonly 4 out of 42 observed its most crucial one, that of pocketing a\ncard ? The means of producing a fraudulent physical phenomenon\nmay, and often does, hinge upon an act as apparently trivial as\nthat. In one case it hinged upon the medium's wiping his nose and\nthen putting his handkerchief in another pocket than that from which\nhe had drawn it. Many witnesses failed to note, or to remember,\nthat act ; it was so commonplace a one that it appeared to be utterly\ndetached and irrelevant. It is of extreme importance to realise that\nnothing which occurs in a physical sitting can be regarded as cer-\ntainly irrelevant, and that the most casual and apparently detached\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\nact may be the \" wood-pile \" in which the \" nigger \" hides. Pro-\nbably many of the sitters in the Besterman experiments took no\npains at all to observe what took place as immediate sequences of\nthe knock on the door, supposing that \" the disturbance \" was no\npart of the show. The demonstration that people can be so easily\ndiverted is most important, for exactly so do fraudulent physical\nmediums arrange \" disturbances \", and lead sitters to think the dis-\nturbances are no essential part of the sitting and may be disregarded.\nIt is so \" natural \" when one coughs to raise his hand to his mouth\nfor a moment that thousands of sitters have quite overlooked and\ndisregarded this act by the medium in the darkness, although the\ntrivial act was the very key of the mystery.\nSometimes the time factor is an important one in the rendition\nof a report. A sitter says that \" not five minutes \" after he laid his\nnotes on the table an answer of some length was received on a slate.\nIf that were so, one would be puzzled to account for it on normal\ngrounds, for to get possession of one of the notes, find opportunity\nto unfold and read it under the edge of the table, restore it folded\nto the table and produce the writing unperceived would be expected\nto occupy more than five minutes filled with the necessary confusing\nlittle acts and misdirecting utterances. The sitter does not claim\nto have timed the occurrence by his watch, nevertheless he is sure\nof his \" not five minutes \". Is it of no \" possible interest \", is it\nnot rather a piece of valuable information to all who read such\nasseverations, that in a case where the elapsed time is exactly known\nto have been 19 minutes the estimates of 35 persons ran all the way\nfrom 5 to 40 minutes, and that the preponderant tendency was to\nunder-estimate rather than to over-estimate ? Eighteen persons\nnamed a figure four or more minutes below the real number, only\nseven a figure four or more minutes in excess of it.\nI should have expected that all, or at least most, sitters would be\nunable to report other than very defectively the objects, details of\nobjects and their positions during the moment of a flash. But I\nregard a demonstration better a hundredfold than an opinion. And\nsurely every one of the nine \" tentative conclusions \" has its value.\nWe have been reading statements by sitters at physical sittings for\na long time and shall probably continue to do so more or less for a\nlong time to come. Every approach which is made toward a measure-\nment of the average value of sensory impressions under given con-\nditions and of memories, immediate or delayed, of the average\nwitness, or the average person in a given class of witnesses, is of value\nand must be taken into account in our subsequent reading.\nThere has perhaps never been comprised in such a short space so\nbrilliant a demonstration of what I might call the divertibility of\nthe human mind as is to be found in the Crocker report (Bulletin XII,\n\fOctober 1932 Correspondence 307\nBoston S.P.R.). It is a demonstration that even men whose very\nprofession relates to the presentation of evidence cannot equally\nobserve diverse phenomena at the same time. The majority were\nlawyers, and they were apparently so intent on hearing and remem-\nbering what was said that a black object on a background of white,\nin good light, was noted by none, and none noted its withdrawal.\nBefore their eyes took place the acts which indicated theft by a\ncertain person, and they were none the wiser, but rather the weight\nof their testimony tended to incriminate an innocent person. Mr\nBesterman's series of experiments does not with such overwhelming\nforce show that, for instance, in a physical sitting incriminating facts\nmay visibly happen unnoticed by most or all of the witnesses. But\nit is notable as the first attempt in the direction of measuring the\nvarious factors of unreliability in honest testimony under sitting\nconditions. I hope that he or others will institute series of experi-\nments in order further to strengthen the correct conclusions and to\nrectify any (if there are such) which are wrong, and in order to lead\nto further conclusions, by varying the conditions and the phenomena\nof the test sittings and by varying the queries. If most readers\nshould indeed be \" amazed \" and disgusted by the printing of results\nin tabular form, as is intimated, then only totals, percentages of\ntotals and conclusions might be printed, and the tables could be\nmimeographed and thus put into the hands of the real investigators.\nI do not think that when the total number of sitters is only 42 any\ntable by which the average scores of Spiritualists are computed and\ncompared with the average scores of the non-Spiritualists is of any\nparticular value, apart from further data regarding the persons who\nhappen to constitute the two groups. It might be that a larger share\nof the Spiritualists than the others were experienced ; it probablv\nwould be that the Spiritualists willing to take part in such experi-\nments, and at the invitation of the S.P.R. , ranked comparatively\nhigh in critical quality. Dr Hyslop was convinced of spirit communi-\ncation, but few could surpass him in the number and precision of his\nobservations in such a sitting. On the other hand, I have known a\ncollege professor of such a temperament that after scores of experi-\nments with a particular medium he remained blind to the damning\nforce of indicia which stamped the mediumship as obviouslv spurious\nin the eyes of more cautious men even at their first sittings.\nOf course, a thing actually observed by one sitter out-weighs the\nfailure of the nine other sitters to observe it. But it might be\nurged that the observation of the one was an illusion. So this has\nlong been the situation with physical phenomena : certain men whom\nI might name attend sittings with one prominent medium after\nanother, and, if they make no convicting discoveries, yet have the\nmisfortune, time after time, of witnessing no phenomena which\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\nseem to them genuine, and of observing much in the way of indicia\nwhich seem to them to point to normal causation, while, on the other\nhand, certain other persons visit these same mediums and time after\ntime announce what seem to them supernormal phenomena, and\nobserve few or no indicia which seem to them suspicious. I, myself,\nhave the unhappiness to belong to the former class. And the war\ngoes on, each class charging the other with seeing, remembering,\njudging improperly. It is well within the bounds of possibility to\nhave tested the question which of the two classes is in fact reporting\nmore nearly in accordance with the objective facts. Let six sittings,\nvaried as to their phenomena, be carefully rehearsed in advance by\nthree managers who will be able afterward to vouch for every detail\nof what actually occurred, and when and under what conditions.\nLet these sittings be attended by, say, a half dozen of the un-\nfortunates seldom, if ever, able to testify to the genuineness of\nphysical performances, and by an equal number of persons who have\ntestified to the genuineness of physical phenomena and hence have\ncome into collision with the former class. Then let it be ascertained\nby the reports which class has the better score, and by how much.\nIt would be a most illuminating set of experiments, and I would\ngladly offer myself as one of the subjects. But it is doubtful if the\ntest will ever be made.\nAnother test I should like to see undertaken. Believing that there\nare sitters who, hearing after or even during an experiment the\nchatter of others as to what they saw and heard, by suggestion come\nto think that they also saw and heard details which they actually\ndid not themselves experience (and the calling out of statements to\nmake a dictaphone record may likewise confuse the memories of\nsome sitters as to what they individually observed), I wish that it\ncould be scientifically determined whether or not this is so. Let\nthere be arranged six sittings, with varied, brief, rehearsed and fixed\nprograms as to phenomena and conditions. Let there be present\nnine persons at each sitting\u2014six valid and inexperienced ones and\nthree who, unknown to the rest, are to play a part. At the first\nthree sittings let silence be preserved, or at least let no experiments\nin misdirection take place. But at the last three let loose the gates\nof conversation and let the three in the \" plot \"\u2014shrewd and\nadroit persons acquainted with psychology\u2014occasionally utter a\nmisdirecting or suggestional remark or question. For instance, if\nthere appears a rounded patch of mingled light and shadowy\nspots (caused by bunching a phosphorescent piece of fabric), one\nmight say, as if to himself, \" Isn't that a face ? \", etc. Then the\nreports on the first three sittings could be compared with those on\nthe last three. But such an interesting psychological experiment\nwould probably be denounced as one of extreme iniquity.\n\fOctober 1932 Correspon dence 309\nPsychologically it would have been desirable to ascertain to what\nextent the omissions of particulars in the \" disturbance \" as indicated\nin Table III, were due to defects of observation and to what extent to\nfailures to record what was in fact noticed. Some people seem con-\nstitutionally unable to give a full account of what they actually\nwitnessed within a brief period of time, or become able to do so only\nafter practice. It is very improbable that only four persons noticed\nthe white card or its pocketing, seeing that Mr Besterman was not\nspeaking so as to divide attention at the moment. Probably the\nobject and the act were unmentioned by some from an erroneous\nfeeling that they were too trivial or detached to deserve mention.\nIf at the very close of the questionnaire attention had been speci-\nfically called again to the incident and sitters had been asked to\nthink whether or not they had omitted any details of it, presumably\na number of the blanks would have been filled. Of course, it is of\nvalue to demonstrate that the tendency to omit details deemed\nunimportant exists, for it follows that, as indeed we have been mor-\nally certain is the case, many witnesses would similarly omit ob-\nserved details in a sitting for claimed supernormal phenomena\nbecause of the judgment, often fatally erroneous, that they are not\nworth recording.\nIt seems to me that some method of scoring should be devised\nwhich will distinguish between an utterly erroneous answer and no\nanswer at all. If failure to reply to question 5, asking what object\nwas touched, presumably because of inability to recollect, ranks as\n0, then naming the wrong object ought to be reckoned as a minus.\nThe witness of a physical sitting who positively misstates the actual\nfact of a given movement does much more damage than the witness\nwho either did not note the fact at all or is silent because uncertain\nas to its nature.\nA series of specially designed experiments would, I believe, demon-\nstrate that while an experienced sitter versed in psychology may\nundergo an illusion (using the term to include hallucination), he is\nvery much less likely than a person untaught in both respects to be\nunaware that it is an illusion. The remark of the psychologist\n(page 386), \" I have, however, the impression that this was an optical\nillusion,\" is an illustration. 1\nNo other sitter experiencing illusion\nappears to have made an equivalent remark. In one of my Stuttgart\nexperiments, as it approached the fifth hour of duration, certain\npersons experienced heterogeneous optical hallucinations, partly\n1\n1 would not be taken as implying that the psychologist, as such, is likely to\nsee and record more correct details of an objective sitting than other intelligent\nmen. This particular psychologist seems not to have made a brilliant record,\nand I have known psychologists who seemed helpless to protect themselves\nagainst those defects of observation, memory and record about which they\nwere accustomed to discourse.\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\ndue to weariness and partly probably of the nature of after-effects\nfrom long staring at luminous bands and spots. I was one of these,\nbut found that the effects persisted in whatever direction in the\ndarkness I looked, so not for a moment doubted their hallucinatory\ncharacter. But two other persons, more naive in experience and in\npsychological knowledge, were inclined to think that materialisations\nwere beginning to appear.\nAny future series of experiments to the same general end as those\nof Mr Besterman, carried out properly and reported from any part\nof the world, will be regarded as far from \" futile \" by more persons\nthan myself. For example, were there held two sets of test sittings,\none with tricky physical effects, the other for purported mental\nmediumship and containing previously rehearsed devices for obtain-\ning hints from sitters and instances of \" giving away \" facts by sit-\nters, the two sets to be attended by the same cultured witnesses (no\nninnies), and their ability to report justly what occurred in the one\nand the other set were compared, an important conclusion to which\nsome of us have come might be much strengthened. And if not,\nwe should like to know it.\nours, etc.,\n^yALTER pRANKLIN Prince.\nREVIEWS.\nGeorg Wunderle, Um Konnersreuth. 8vo, pp. iv. 65. Abhand-\nlungen zur Philosophie und Psychologie der Religion : Wiirz-\nburg, Verlag C. J. Becker, 1931. Price Mk. 2.\nThis little book (65 pages) is a valuable contribution to a much\ndiscussed problem.\nIts pieces de resistance are Professor Wunderle's paper on \" Die\nStigmatisierte von Konnersreuth,\" read by him at the Erfurt\nCongress of Religious Psychology (June 1930), and Professor Alois\nMager's \" Religionspsychologie und die Vorgange in Konnersreuth \":\na paper read at a similar Congress in Vienna eleven months later.\nWe have further, besides an introduction by Prof. Wunderle, two\nchapters, of which the first is devoted to some \" echoes \" of the Erfurt\npaper and the second to a polemical pamphlet of Dr Fritz Gerlich's\npublished in 1931 and directed against Professors Wunderle and\nMager ; also a correspondence between the latter and Dr Gerlich,\nand a \" conclusion \".\nProfessors Wunderle and Mager (the latter of Salzburg University)\nare, it should be noted, two Roman Catholic ecclesiastics, Professor\nMager being besides a Benedictine monk. Dr Fritz Gerlich has\npublished a work in two volumes on Therese Neumann ; he is a\nlayman and was until recently a Protestant (he is now, we believe, a\nRoman Catholic).\n\fOctober 1932 Reviews 311\nThat both Professor Wunderle and Professor Mager are believing\nRoman Catholics, goes without saying. That they will cheerfully\nsubmit to the verdict of their Church in the matter, when that\nverdict has been officially formulated, is equally certain. But mean-\nwhile and whilst ready to see in the stigmatica not only a young girl\nof irreproachable behaviour, but also a kindly and pious person of\nhigh merit (Wunderle, p. 14), and in the Konnersreuth facts them-\nselves a \" religious occurrence \" (whatever that may mean exactly),\n\" authentic, trustworthy, uniform (einheitlich), full of meaning,\nimpressive \" (Mager, p. 37), they are by no means ready to endorse\nat once the interpretation put on the \" phenomena \" by the en-\nthusiasts. They plead for more accurate and scientific investiga-\ntion and evidently earnestly wish their Church to suspend its judg-\nment and postpone as much as possible an \" infallible \" verdict.\nHere and there we find opinions expressed or hinted at by them\nconcerning the way in which they are being treated by their op-\nponents. \" If,\" writes Father Mager to Dr Gerlich (p. 43), \" Therese\nNeumann approves of the way in which Dr Gerlich acts and looks\nupon him as her advocate it is certain that Christ does not speak\nthrough her. For nothing contradicts's Christ's spirit more than\nthat kind of polemic.\" If Therese Neumann stated, after Dr Gerlich\nlaid before her Father Mager's letter of 15 May 1931, that she hardly\nspoke with him, \" this is and remains, objectively speaking, an\nuntruth, whether uttered in a normal state or in the Zustand der\nerhobenen Rulie \"\n(p. 65). It is permissible to suppose, it should be\nnoted, that the two learned ecclesiastics would have expressed them-\nselves more freely if they had had full liberty to do so. Though we\nare not entitled to speak of any concrete moral pressure brought\nupon them, their position in the Roman Catholic world in reference\nto Konnersreuth is more or less peculiar ;\ncomparative isolation (at\nleast in Europe) will perhaps not be too strong a term.\nIn view of this fact we may surmise that in dealing with such\ndelicate matters as those referred to in the two passages above quoted\nthey tried to express themselves as diplomatically as they could. 1\nAnd I confess that when reading Father Mager's paper at the Vienna\nCongress, I have the impression that the original paper was on one\nor two points more explicit. Still, a characteristic sentence has\nremained : \"It must be stated most emphatically,\" Father Mager\nwrites, \" that there can be no question of a scientific verdict as to\nthe Konnersreuth case, so long as these preliminary investigations\nhave not been made (p. 39).\" Now these \" preliminary investiga-\n1\nSince writing the above I have read a masterly article of Professor\nWunderle's in the Wurzburg Frdnkisches Volksblatt which he kindly sent me.\nI acknowledge with pleasure that the language of that article as well as some\nextracts quoted from a paper of Father Mager's are sufficiently explicit.\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\ntions \" should, in the Salzburg Professor's opinion, deal with Therese\nNeumann's state of consciousness during, between and after the\necstatic visions ; with the nature of the ecstatics themselves ; with\nthe alleged talking by her in languages no more spoken to-day ; with\nthe apparent non-absorption by her of any food. And though in\nFather Mager's opinion, there remains at Konnersreuth a residuum\nof facts inexplicable by what we know to-day of causality, natural,\nnay pathological factors, take part in what occurs there (p. 37). And\nthe very nature of the voyante's illness and of the accident which\ncaused that illness has not been thoroughly cleared up (p. 39).\nj\nAs to the \" phenomenon \" which has perhaps most contributed\nto^Therese Neumann's world-wide celebrity, though Dr Wunderle\nis undoubtedly much impressed by her stigmata, he distinctly\nsays (p. 22) that he is unable simply to ascribe the character of a\n\" theological miracle \" to every kind of stigmatisation, and he admits\nthe possibility of natural stigmatisation.\nOf particular importance for his general position is, however, such\na passage as the following :\n\" The fact that not only a medical, but\nalso a psychological investigation of the Konnersreuth case has been\ndeclined is to be deeply regretted. \/ hold those ivho, directly or in-\ndirectly, have been guilty of such a refusal to have assumed no small\nresponsibility \"\n(p. 15 ; the italics are Prof. Wunderle's own).\nThe case is still sub judice and I am afraid will remain so for a long-\ntime to come ; nor do I think it likely, alas, that its investigation\nwill assume the character science is entitled to require. Isolated\ninstances of objective research there will possibly be ; but what is\ncalled sometimes the \" Konnersreuth circle \" has now, I am afraid,\nclosed on Therese Neumann in such a way as almost to preclude the\npossibility of a sound investigation worthy of the name.\nThat, scientifically speaking, truth is on the side of those who fol-\nlow Prof. Wunderle and Father Mager there is no doubt. But even\nfrom the religious standpoint it seems to me that the critical and\nsemi-sceptical tendency has scored already an important point. For,\nastounding as it may seem, it is a fact that for such people as Dr\nGerlich and Pfarrer Naber (Therese Neumann's confessor) there is\napparently no doubt that it is Christ Himself who speaks through\nthe stigmatica using her in the state known as erhobener Ruhezustand\nas a \" terrestrial speaking instrument \"\n(p. 53).\nSo firm is on this point Dr Gerlich's conviction that, as he informs\nus in his letter to Father Mager printed on pp. 46-61, when he wants\nto obtain some enlightenment from the entity speaking through\nTherese Neumann in the erhobenen Ruhezustand\u2014\" therefore, such\nis my conviction, from the Saviour \"\u2014and when he is unable to\nobtain it himself, he \" regularly \" applies to Pfarrer Naber in writing\nin the following terms :\n\" Will you be kind enough to request in my\n\fOctober 1932 Revieivs 313\nname the Saviour to confer on me the grace to answer the following\nquestion ... (p. 55).\"\nOn this Professor Wunderle says :\n\" Not only is the questioning\nof the Saviour by Gerlich and Pfarrer Naber utterly antiscientific,\nbut it is a proceeding equally conflicting with the attitude of the\nChurch. From the religious standpoint the utilisation of Therese\nNeumann as a formal Chistusorakel for the purpose of verification of\nscientific researches must be rejected categorically. By so doing the\nKonnersreuth affair is placed in a risky position \" (the italics are\nProfessor Wunderle's own).\nThese lines are the last of this little volume. On the one hand\nthey are discouraging. On the other they are cheering, as showing\nthat inside the Roman Cathohc Church itself there are to be found\nhonest and learned, noble-minded priests in whom deep religious\nfeeling does not exclude a truly scientific and obj ective attitude and\na sincere regard for truth even in a peculiarly \" ticklish \" sphere.\nWe earnestly hope that in spite of so delicate a position both\nProfessor Wunderle and Professor Mager will be able to continue\ntheir championing of the cause of objective scientific inquiry into\nthe Konnersreuth problem. I much fear that their efforts may not\nprevail in the long run. Their merit will be none the less and they\nwill deserve\u2014they deserve already\u2014the sympathy and respect of\nall honest seekers after truth, whether devout Christians, atheists or\nagnostics.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nCarl Vett, Seltsame Erlebnisse in einem Derwischkloster. 8vo,\npp. 331, 4 ill. Strassburg : Heitz und Co., 1931.\nThe well-known organiser of the International Psychical Research\nCongresses reports in this book on the personal experiences he has\nhad with the Turkish dervishes in Constantinople. The larger part\nof his book consists of a psychological diary of a fortnight's stay in\na Dervish cloister in that town in 1925. Mr Vett entered it not only\nand not primarily out of scientific curiosity, but rather because of a\nreligious desire to come into direct contact with the mysticism of\nIslam. He succeeded in entering into such intimate contact with\nvarious typical Dervish sheiks as probably no European had done\nbefore him. And so he is able to give us a highly instructive and\nintimate insight into the religious life of this order As the works of\nNicholson and Macdonald on the religion of Islam show, it is full of\nreports on and beliefs in parapsychical happenings. It is the chief\nmerit of Mr Vett's book that he gives us a direct insight into these\nthings. It contains a mass of reports on telepathic visions, biloca-\ntions, levitations, fire-tests, and other phenomena. An investigation\ninto their reaUty is naturally in no case possible. Nevertheless one\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1932\nobtains the general impression that, notwithstanding obviously\nuncritical credulity, parapsychical phenomena are not rare among\nthe Muslims.\nIt is a tragically disappearing world into which Mr Vett was able\nto look. While under the old regime it was reckoned a privilege to\nbelong to the Dervish order, and officials of high standing entered it,\nthe present-day Turkish government sees only superstition in it,\nand in February 1931 a number of the Dervishes who had received\nVett into their community were condemned. European rationalism,\nwhich is no longer in Europe itself the last word in the scientific\noutlook, still triumphs in the East. {Translated.)\nT. K.

Mrs Edith Lyttelton\nin the Chair.\nFather Herbert Thurston, S.J., read a paper entitled \" Some\nNeglected Types of Evidence in Psychical Research \".\nHe had been struck in reading the objections raised by the more\nsceptical critics of the phenomena of D. D. Home by the little effort\nthey seemed to have made to deal with the spiritualistic literature\nof the period. While they were quite willing to quote admissions\nto the discredit of mediums, evidence tending in the contrary sense\nwas ignored or ruled out as valueless. Beyond doubt the stories of\nmarvellous phenomena which filled the spiritualist journals of the\nHome period were as a rule negligible. But he would urge that all\nthis testimony was not equally worthless. Mr Frank Podmore had\nlargely set the tone of the adverse criticisms of physical phenomena,\nespecially in the case of Home. But Podmore had concentrated his\nfire upon only a few examples and had brushed aside much testimony\nthat ought not to have been left out of account. An example was\nthe account in the Norwood News of 22 May 1869 of a sitting at the\nhouse of Mr Enmore Jones. He referred to this because it seemed\nto him a very straightforward statement, endorsing from a quite\nindependent standpoint the type of manifestation so frequently\nrecorded in Lord Adare's letters. Besides the familiar raps, table\nmovements and accordion tunes, the account mentioned two less\nusual features. One was that of the table oscillating violently\nwithout shaking off a statuette and its glass shade, the other was the\nstatement that the writer of the description felt the keys of the\naccordion moving up and down as it hung over his feet. Podmore\ndealt with these types of phenomena in The Newer Spiritualism by\nquoting Mr W. M. Wilkinson's account in The Spiritual Magazine\n(1861, pp. 359-362). This Podmore dismissed on the ground that\nthe conditions were not described. He then referred to Sir William\nCrookes's experiences of the same kind. These he attributed to\nHome's use of \" a small musical box, a loop of black silk, and a hook\nwith a sharp end \".\nIt seemed to him that this view was quite inadequate. It did not\naccount for the playing of tunes and for the movement of the\naccordion keys, a phenomenon which Podmore stated against the\nplain evidence never to have been seen in good light. It did not\naccount for such descriptions as those left by Serjeant Cox and other\nwitnesses, who saw the bellows expanding and contracting, heard\nthe music playing, and felt the powerful tugging. If hallucination\nwere to be put forward it would involve the hallucination of three\nsenses. It was also strange that the fact of the accordion playing in\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1932\nother people's hands was passed over by Mr Podmore without a\nword.\nA discussion followed in which Mr Trethewy referred to similar-\nevidence he had come across in some manuscript records of 1857-\n1860.\nMr Besterman said that he still felt inclined to agree with Pod-\nmore's criticisms in general, but not perhaps in detail. Father\nThurston had not attempted to criticise the narratives he had\nquoted. There was no indication in most of these narratives that\nnotes had been made at the time. Yet these accounts were long and\ndetailed, referring to a large number of phenomena, the exact nature\nand sequence of which it was essential to know. He therefore felt\nsomewhat sceptical about the reliability of such accounts. Never-\ntheless they would all feel indebted to Father Thurston for having\nagain drawn attention to the great difficulties of judging these old\ncases.\nDr Dingwall regretted that the speaker had not dealt with Home's\nlevitations. He felt that these phenomena were now too old to be\ncapable of being adequately judged. The proper course was to-\nstudy the mediums of to-day and to apply the comparative method.\nThe Rev. Mr Hayes suggested that the alleged phenomena might\nhave been hallucinations.\nSir Lawrence Jones, Captain Seton-Karr, Mr Sweeney, Mr Het-\ntinger, Mrs Adlercron and Mrs Felkin also took part in the discussion.\nOBITUARIES.\nG. Lowes Dickinson.\n[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson died in the early morning of\n3 August 1932, in his 70th year. He had been a member of the\nSociety for over 28 years and a member of Council from 1904 to\n1920. His interest in the Society's work never diminished : he was\npresent at one of the meetings held to celebrate its jubilee. Among\nhis contributions to the Society's publications are a report of \" A\nCase of Emergence of a Latent Memory under Hypnosis \" (Pro-\nceedings, xxv. 455-467) and a discussion of certain cross-correspond-\nences (Journal, xiv. 10-15).!\nI think Lowes Dickinson was the first person who interested me\nactively, now a long time ago, in the work of our Society. I know\nat least that for more than twenty-five years I have had the inestim-\nable advantage of talking over its problems with him and hearing\nhis acute and stimulating comments. Perhaps they were all the\nmore stimulating because his mind was so receptive as well as so\ncritical. Everyone who had the privilege of his friendship, and many\nwho only heard him speak or only read his beautiful writing, felt the\n\fNovember 1932 Obituaries 323\nbeauty of his character, its courage, its gentleness, its freedom.\nThere were the same qualities in his mind, a mind that could not\nstiffen, that was always ready to grow, a faith the more invigorating\nbecause, to paraphrase one of his own great sayings, it lived always\nwith the dagger of criticism pointed at its heart.\nPerhaps it will be of most interest to our members if I try to give\nsome accoimt of his attitude, as I knew it, to our most burning\nquestions. I have hesitated more than once in doing this, proud\nthough I was to have been asked, and for several reasons. I am\nafraid of rousing controversy, of treading on sacred ground, and even\nmore of not giving a true impression of Dickinson's own position.\nFor this was always changing, even oscillating, though to make the\nmetaphor truer as well as more complete, it oscillated round a fixed\ncentre. I have known him doubt, and deeply, the possibility of any\nsurvival, certainly of individual survival, and I have known him, on\nthe other hand, accept for the time as evidences of real phenomena\nthings which later on he came to consider delusions or deceptions.\nGradually and both by scrutinising all the evidence he could get hold\nof and by listening to those secret intimations of something beyond\nwhich come to a man of his spiritual insight, he arrived, I think,\npretty definitely at a double conclusion, negative and positive.\nFirst, that the physical phenomena as they are usually called\n\u2014\" the\nWitch of Endor business \" as we sometimes dubbed them when we\nwere talking\u2014things like the calling-up by mediums of apparitions\nand \" ectoplasm\", were now really too deeply discredited by in-\ncessant fraud and their own inherent vulgarity to be at all credible.\nNext, that a large and growing body of evidence did point not only\nto ordinary thought-transference from living minds, but also to some-\nthing drifting through from another form of mind. I wrote \" filter-\ning through \" at first, and then I saw that Dickinson would have\ncriticised this as a most inappropriate metaphor. For what came\nthrough seemed, he thought, always to come mixed up with all kinds\nof impurities and puerilities, so that if one swallowed it holus-bolus\nthere was an end of sound discrimination and genuine science.\nI think it was from him I heard a simile which always struck me\nas an excellent one, to the effect that the typical outpourings of a\nmedium were like a dream when one has heard a knock at the door,\nwith a whole tissue of absurdities woven round it. But it has been a\nreal knock by someone else for all that. And in connection with this\nhe leaned more and more to the view that our ordinary way of con-\nceiving mind as split up into individual minds is singularly inadequate\nand at bottom unsatisfying to the heart. What he loved \" to dream\nof \", as he might have put it himself, was that the world of spirit was\nlike a vast submerged continent of which only the peaks appeared\non this earth as individuals. And however much he might, did,\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1932\ndoubt at times, he always swung back to the sense that \" we are\ngreater than we know \" and not destined to go out like the blown\nname of a candle. This was the centre I spoke of, and for him it\ninvolved a conviction of the value in the Society's work.\nIt is comforting to me to remember how keenly interested he was\nin the account I gave him, almost the last time I saw him alone, of\nMrs Sidgwick's review, read by Gerald Balfour at our Jubilee. He\nhad not been able to hear this and I was full of it. It chimed in\nvery well with his own attitude and I heard, after his death, that he\nhad spoken of it eagerly to a Cambridge friend.\nHe knew for some months, as he told another friend, that his life\nhung by a thread which might snap at any moment. He faced this\nnot only with calm but with a noble sense of adventure. I did not\nknow myself that he knew it, for he was endlessly careful not to\nalarm the apprehensive. But he did write and speak to me about\nfeeling \" the great change \" drawing near. The first time was in a\nletter. \" I wonder \", he wrote, \" if you feel, Hke me, that what used\nto be only words is becoming real ? It is pretty terrible but very\nexciting \". I thought when I read this that he was only speaking of\nold-age which he felt approaching although in a sense he never lost\ntouch with youth. But when we talked about it I saw he meant\nmore, in fact he said he did, and I hope I shall never forget the look\nin his eyes as he told me. \" It must be such a tremendous change \",\nhe said. Then, a little later, when talking about a friend who had\nrecovered from a terrible malady and almost at once forgotten all\nabout the suffering, I happened to say \" I should not wonder if\ndeath was hke that\". \"Nor should I, my dear\", he answered and\nhe smiled.\nF. Melian Stawell.\nJohn William Graham, Litt.D.\nThe sudden death of J. W. Graham on 17 October 1932, has\ndeprived the S.P.R. of an old and devoted member. His name\noccurs first in the List (of Associates) for December 1884.\nHe was born, of Quaker parentage on both sides, at Preston,\nLanes., in 1859, and after being educated at the Friends' Schools\nat Ackworth and Kendal, passed on to University College, London,\nand then to King's College, Cambridge. Here he was one of a group\nof ardent young Liberals who, in the 'eighties, created an atmosphere\nat King's perhaps more stimulating than was to be found at the time\nin any other College. Another of the group, and ultimately the\nmost distinguished of them, was the late Lowes Dickinson, who was\nalso, like Graham, keenly interested in psychical research, though he\ndid not join the Society till later.\n\fNovember 1932 Obituaries 325\nIn 1866 Graham became Tutor in Mathematics, History and\nEconomics at Dalton Hall, Manchester, a Hostel for Men founded by\nthe Society of Friends, and from 1897 to 1924 he was Principal of\nthe Hall. He was a man of wide and varied interests and worked\nhard at many schemes for social betterment, such as Adult Educa-\ntion and Smoke Abatement.\nAfter his retirement from Dalton Hall he became a Fellow and\nLecturer at Woodbrooke, Birmingham, and a year later Professor\nof the Principles and History of Quakerism at Swarthmore College,\nPennsylvania. He then travelled for some time in India, lecturing\non the philosophy of religion.\nHe was prominent and influential in the Society of Friends and an\nactive member of many of their Committees. Their international\nwork made a special appeal to him and he travelled and lectured\nextensively in Germany of late years to help forward the cause of\ninternational reconciliation. He published a number of books on\npolitics and religion, of which The Faith of a Quaker (brought out by\nthe Cambridge University Press soon after the war) is perhaps the\nmost characteristic.\nIn 1928 he came back to live in Cambridge and last year was\nadopted a prospective Liberal candidate for the borough. He was\nnow an elderly man, in frail health, and it was only a sense of public\nduty that led him to accept this practically hopeless position, for the\nopportunities it gave him of publicly advocating his principles.\nAs a Friend, he held steadfastly to pacifism during the war, as he\nhad done previously in the Boer war, but his nature was fiery and\npugnacious\u2014qualities derived perhaps from his ancestors on the\nScottish border\u2014and when it came to spiritual fighting with the\nforces of evil, he put on his whole armour and went forth unabashed\nby \" the thunder of the_captains and the shouting \", for he was\ngenerally, of course, on the unpopular side.\nThough he had strong convictions, he was not a party man.\nNeither as a Liberal nor as a Friend was he bound to the ortho-\ndoxies of his own side : he would consider each question inde-\npendently on its own merits and not infrequently found himself in\nconflict with his friends or colleagues. This, though it sometimes\ndistressed him greatly, never led to bitterness or estrangement.\nThe great concern of his life was religion, and he cared about\npsychical research chiefly for its possible bearing on religious ques-\ntions. He never took a prominent part in the work, but gave much\nuseful help unobtrusively in inquiries. He was not in the first\ninstance critical of evidence, for it was his habit to think well of\neverybody and he could not easily be persuaded of the ordinary\nperson's inaccuracies of statement and failures in memory. But\nwhen real flaws were pointed out, he was candid enough to admit\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1932\nthem and to realise that a scientific Society, such as ours, must\ninsist on a high standard of evidence. Thus, while he personally\nattached importance to the psychical experiences that abound in\nthe early history of the Friends (as in that of other religious bodies,\nsuch as the Franciscans and the Wesleyans), he recognised that they\nwere rarely, if ever, \"evidential\". A striking case of this kind,\nhowever, which we owed to his researches, was printed in the\nJournal, xiii. 87.\nHe wrote occasionally in other periodicals on psychical research,\ne.g. an interesting article by him on the characteristics of the\n\" Myers Control \" in automatic scripts appeared in the Hibbert\nJournal for January 1909. He had been from his Cambridge days a\ndevoted disciple of Myers : indeed, among his chief heroes in early\nlife were Euskin, Sidgwick and Myers. He was of the type that\nremains faithful to its youthful ideals and enthusiasms, and he was\nfortunate in being able to work all his life for the causes that were\nnearest to his heart.\nAlice Johnson.\nL. 1296. CASE.\nHALLUCINATORY IMPRESSION OF A EELATIVE'S DEATH.\nMme Adelina de Lara, Cranford, Hook Heath, Woking, a Member\nof the Society, writes as follows in a letter dated 28 July 1932 :\n\" On Monday 25th inst. I awoke about 7.15 a.m. and saw lying at\nmy side on the pillow, what appeared to be a half-sheet of note paper\nwith words written on it\n\u2014' Mimi was dying, last night '. I repeated\nthis to myself and the whole thing vanished\u2014When my friend\n\u2014\nwho lives with me\u2014brought in my morning tea I immediately told\nher, I also said it was rather strange, as I had only ever known one\n'\nMimi '\nand (as my friend knew) she was my cousin's (Sir Landon\nRonald's) wife. I did not know if she were ill or well as I have not\nseen her for some years, nor have I had occasion to speak or think\nof her.\u2014Relations leading busy lives often drift apart\u2014 \"\n[Signed] Adelina de Lara.\nThe friend mentioned in Mme de Lara's statement corroborates\nit in the following terms :\n\" I hereby testify that the above is a true and correct statement.\"\n[Signed] Pearl Ives.\nLady Ronald committed suicide during the night of 24 July 1932\nby taking poison. The death occurred after 10.30 on the evening\nof the 24th, but it is not possible to establish the exact time. The\nincident thus has the appearance of a deferred telepathic impression.\n\fNovember 1932 Correspondence 327\nCOREESPONDENCE.\nON THE EVIDENCE FOR SUPEBNOBMAL OCCURRENCES\nIN CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir.\u2014Professor E. R. Dodds says in the March Journal that the\northodox Greek view was that the dead were safely imprisoned in\nHades. If this statement correctly represents Greek ideas about the\nnext life, in the classical period, it is not true of those ideas as held\nunder the Roman Empire. This is clear from the evidence cited by\nLudwig Friedlander in the Sittengeschichte Roms, vol. ii, pp. 623 ff.\nAccording to Friedlander, Dio Cassius says that at great events and\nin moments of crisis the dead would rise, sometimes in considerable\nnumbers, and freely show themselves on this earth. This belief may\nthrow some light on the obscure passage in St. Matthew's Gospel,\nxxvii. 52 f.\nYours, etc., TT , T\nH. >sORTHCOTE.\nP.S. \u2014Moreover, in Greek thought, \" daemons \" were human in\norigin.\n[Prof. Dodds writes :\n\" I trust my paper did not convey the false\nimpression that the\n1\northodox '\nHades-theory was the only view\nheld in later antiquity about the state of the dead : by the time of\nDio Cassius {circa 200 a.d.) the most conflicting opinions on the\nsubject were current. But there is in any case nothing especially\nsignificant in Dio's mention of apparitions of the dead among other\nportents occurring at times of great crisis. The popular belief that\nthe heroic dead may rise from their graves to protest against acts of\ntyranny or foreign aggression is found among many peoples, includ-\ning the Greeks of the classical period. It is exemplified, as Mr\nNorthcote says, in Matt, xxvii. 52. But it does not imply belief in\nspiritualism, i.e. in the possibility of regular communication with the\nspirits of individual deceased persons ; the French soldiers who\nthought they saw Joan of Arc leading their ranks in the late war were\nnot spiritualists.\n\" Mr Northcote's postscript about daemons would be correct if he\nhad written '\nin some Greek thought '. It is true that from an early\ntime (Hesiod) the heroic dead, who received cultus, were sometimes\ndescribed as '\ndaemons and that later this complimentary epithet\nwas occasionally extended to the ordinary dead. But the fact has\nlittle bearing on my contention about the difference between Neo-\nplatonic theurgy and spiritualism : for Iambbchus (de myst. II. 1 f.)\nexplicitly distinguishes daemons from '\nheroes '\nand human souls ;\nand in many of the utterances quoted by Porphyry the communi-\ncator described himself unambiguously as a god.\"]\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1932\nNOTES ON SITTINGS.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014It is useful for students to compare their experiences, so I\nneed not apologise for making a few comments on points in the\n\" Report of some sittings with Valiantine \" in a recent issue of\nProceedings.\n1. I note that the \" Voice \" gave Lord Charles Hope the name of\nan aunt : but that he did not at once identify this because it was not\nthe name she was usually called by. I have repeatedly had a similar\nexperience. Some years ago I was with a highly developed clair-\nvoyant, Mr Otto von Bourg. I handed him a letter signed with the\ninitials (only) of an aunt of mine who died before I was born, and after\nwhom I was named. He gave her surname almost correctly and then\nsaid : \"I get Annie \". Her second name was Anne, but she was\nnever so called in my hearing. He then said :\n\" Who is Harriet\n\u2014\nHarry\u2014Henrietta ?\n\" I said :\n\" You are not quite right \". \"I\nget H. so strongly,\" he rejoined. He put the letter again to his fore-\nhead and said :\n\" It is Helen ! She says Helen \".\nThe name so familiar to me was obtained with difficulty ; the\nname I did not associate with her came readily. It is curious that a\nfew weeks later this medium again gave the name \" Annie \" alone,\nin connection with this aunt.\n\" On another occasion with the same clairvoyant I asked a ques-\ntion. I said :\n\" Can you tell me anything about a friend, a girl I know\nwas called after ?\n\" He promptly gave me one of this girl's names,\nbut not the name which she is known by, not the name of the friend\nin memory of whom she received the name I always called her by.\nWhat can be the psychological reason for this ? Is it, perhaps,\nconnected with the trick of memory which makes it so difficult some-\ntimes to give a familiar name when one is suddenly asked for it ?\n2. Lord Charles Hope writes :\n\" Before the end of my Valiantine\nsittings I felt I could have got this voice to acquiesce in and repeat\nany nonsense I cared to suggest \".\nThis is an experience which can also be corroborated. A friend of\nmine, who might have become a very gifted medium if circumstances\nhad permitted her to cultivate her faculty in this direction, received\nthrough her own writing what claimed to be communications from a\ndeceased friend. Some remarks which were made impressed me as\naffording a clue to the confusions which arise in mediumistic experi-\nences : they suggested to me that the \" Control \" was conscious of\nthe possibility of becoming merged in the consciousness of the medium\nand then merely giving back her own thought to her. This is not an\nunlikely occurrence, it is equally possible that a medium, or Control,\nmay reflect back the thoughts and suggestions of the sitter.\n\fNovember 1932 Notes on Sittings 329\nIt is this contingency that makes it desirable that the sitter should\navoid asking questions, and should keep a passive and receptive\nmental attitude.\nSome of my most successful sittings have been proxy sittings, in\nwhich, being almost completely ignorant of the conditions of the\nperson on whose behalf I was acting, I was not liable to affect the\nmedium by the activity of my own mind.\nYours, etc.,\nHelen Alex. Dallas.\nON A SITTING WITH EUDI SCHNEIDER.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014In your issue for July Dr Brown's letters to the Times about\nhis sitting with Rudi Schneider are reprinted. In one of these letters\nhe refers to publicity unsolicited by him. I should like therefore to\nmake it clear that not a word concerning the sitting in question was\nconveyed to the Press except upon Dr Brown's own initiative.\nYours, etc.,\nHarry Price.\nREVIEW.\nC. E. Bechhoeer Roberts, The Truth about Spiritualism. 8vo,\npp. 280. London : Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1932. Price\n8s. 6d. net.\nA title beginning \" The Truth About ...\" does not predispose a\nreviewer in favour of a book, but the reader who penetrates beyond\nthe title of this book will find (to his agreeable surprise, if he is not\nalready familiar with Mr Bechhofer Roberts's writings) a well-\narranged and well-informed discussion of the strength and weakness\nof the different types of evidence on which the case for Spiritualism\nrests. The book is primarily intended for readers not very deeply\nversed in psychical research : but it is very different from most\n\" popular \" literature on the subject, and there can be few students\nso advanced as to derive no profit from it, even if Mr Roberts does\nno more than compel them to think of arguments to rebut his con-\nclusions.\nIn the first chapter Mr Roberts, after explaining that, in the\nabsence of any definition universally acceptable to spiritualist bodies,\nhe proposed to define as a Spiritualist anyone who, to put it briefly,\naccepts survival and constant communication, gives a short account\nof how spiritualists are organised, and a description of a typical\nspiritualist service. Many, of course, who accept survival and com-\nmunication hold aloof from all spiritualist organisations, the cause\nof abstention being usually their knowledge of the untrustworthiness\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1932\nof many of the particular phenomena, acceptance of which has, as\nshown by Conan Doyle's attacks on the S.P.R., become almost de\nfide among organised spiritualists. It is presumably to meet the\ncase of these abstainers, who have an influence out of all proportion\nto their numbers, that Mr Roberts in his definition speaks of \" con-\nstant communication \", but it might have been well if he had made\ntheir position rather plainer.\nChapters II and III give an interesting summary of spiritualist\npractises among the ancients and the more backward races of our\nown times, and of the American origins of the modern spiritualist\nmovement, closing with a good short account of the career of D. D.\nHome.\nThe rest of the book is concerned with the developments of\nspiritualism in our own time, ever since in fact, with the foundation\nof the Society, the facts on which it relies have been subject to\nsystematic, continuous, impartial scrutiny. The scale of the book\ndoes not of course permit of Mr Roberts giving full-length portraits\nof all the notable mediums of the last 50 years, or a detailed analysis\nof all the relevant types of evidence : there are parts of the book\nwhere the subject suffers from excessive compression. But on the\nwhole the aiithor is to be warmly congratulated on the complete-\nness with which he covers the ground and the judiciousness of his\ncomments. It would be superfluous, or even offensive, to praise an\nauthor of a book on almost any subject other than psychical re-\nsearch for refraining from asking the reader to accept untrustworthy\nevidence, or for choosing instances that were relevant to illustrate\nhis argument. It is hoped that Mr Roberts will not repudiate a\ntribute to the skill he has shown in avoiding pitfalls which have\nensnared so many writers of popular books on this subject.\nAfter two good chapters on the psychology of the sitter and of the\nmedium, Mr Roberts turns to paraphysical phenomena, mediumistic\nand spontaneous. While some of the former have, he considers,\nfairly good evidence in their support (e.g. Dr Osty's recent experi-\nments with Rudi Schneider), there is in his opinion no ground for\nconnecting any tolerably well-established phenomena of this class\nwith the activities of disembodied spirits. The phenomena (such as\ntelekinesis), which have the least apparent connection with spirit\nagency, are the best evidenced : those with the closest ostensible*\nconnection (spirit photography and materialisations), the worst.\nThe necessarily brief accounts of notable physical mediums are\njudicious : in fairness, however, to Eusapia Mr Feilding's Naples\nsittings with her might have been mentioned.\nMr Roberts holds that some types of spontaneous physical\nphenomena are better attested, but that they do not provide any\nbetter grounds for accepting a spiritualist interpretation.\n\fNovember 1932 Review 331\nPassing to the mental phenomena Mr Roberts first discusses pre-\nvision and psychometry, which, if genuine, are just as difficult to\nexplain on a spiritualistic, as on any other hypothesis. In the\nchapter on telepathy which follows, one is glad to see due emphasis\nlaid on the Groningen experiments. As however it is by telepathy\n{i.e. telepathy between the living) that the author later on explains\nmost of the mental phenomena of spiritualism, his argument requires\nthat he should not only establish the reality of telepathy (which he\nmost successfully does), but should also indicate the extent and\nlimits of its operation. In this connection reference might have\nbeen made to the negative results of various \" mass \" experiments.\nIn the chapter on trance-mediumship Mr Roberts classifies the\ninformation given by such mediums as Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard\n(information, that is, outside the medium's normal knowledge) into\nfour groups : A. information known to the sitter, B. information\nknown to some other person connected with the sitting, C. informa-\ntion known to some living person not connected with the sitting,\nand D. information apparently known only to some person who has\ndied. \" We shall see \", he goes on, \" that the evidence in these groups\nvaries with the complexity : there is plenty for the first, and a certain\namount for the second, and some perhaps for the third ; while the\nfourth requires special investigation if it is to yield any at all\".\nIf we leave the fourth class out of account for the moment, surely\n\" some perhaps \" understates the evidence for the third class. And,\nassuming that telepathy from the living was the sole effective cause,\nshould we on, the basis of the knowledge derived from the spon-\ntaneous cases and the experiments, be justified in expecting any\nsuccess at all in group C ?\nThe other two stumbling blocks in the way of any exclusively\ntelepathic explanation are the vivid presentation in trance of a\npersonality normally unknown to the medium, and the cross-\ncorrespondences. Mr Roberts refers to both, but unfortunately they\nrequire more space for adequate illustration than the size of the book\npermits. It is possible to frame a theory which will explain each of\nthem, more or less, by telepathy, but is it not necessary in doing so to\ninvent ad hoc a species of telepathy for which there is otherwise\npractically no evidence ? Why is it that for its best efforts tele-\npathy between the living should habitually masquerade as communi-\ncation from the dead ?\nThese are questions which some Spiritualists, who may have\nfollowed Mr Roberts's argument up to this point with much approval\nand little dissent, might wish to put, in the hope that at some future\ntime Mr Roberts may deal with it as fully as the complexity of the\nproblem demands.\nW. H. Salter.\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1932\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nBoston Society for Psychical Research, Bulletin XVII, October 1932.\nThis Bulletin is entitled Book Reviews and other matters, which\nwell describes it. It begins with supplementary information con-\nnected with a book on Leonard and Soule Experiments in Psychical\nResearch by Mrs L. W. Allison, published by the Boston Society\nsome years ago. Then follow the reviews by Dr Prince of seven\nbooks printed in the last seven years. The reviewing of careful\nreviews already published would seem a rather profitless occupation.\nDr Prince's own reviews are always careful, so I do not propose to\ndevote more than a sentence or two to any of these seven. For the\nfirst, How to go to a Medium by E. J. Dingwall, Dr Prince \" has\npractically nothing but commendation \". The second on Mr Bester-\nman's Some Modern Mediums is largely occupied by a defence of the\nauthor against unjustifiable and unfair attacks, especially by foreign\ncritics. The third book reviewed is Body, Mind and Spirit by\nDr Elwood Worcester (the President of the Boston Society) and\nDr Samuel McComb\u2014an interesting book judging from the review,\nbut only partially concerned with psychical research. The next\nreview deals with Mr. Bradley's book . . .And After\u2014the book in\nwhich he expounds the exposure of the medium Valiantine, regarding\nwhom there has recently been discussion in our Proceedings. The\nfifth review\u2014on Fort's Wild Talents pronounces the book, though\namusingly written, as having \" no interest for psychic research,\nsince it has no scientific value whatever\". The sixth review deals\nwith Houdini and Conan Doyle and perhaps needs no further remark\nhere. The seventh and last book reviewed is Mr Harry Price's Rudi\nSchneider. This is followed by a paper by Professor Nils von\nHofsten of Upsala describing two sittings in the course of Mr Price's\nseries at which the Professor was one of the sitters. This article\nshould be read in connection with Mr Price's book. Readers of the\narticle will agree we think that at Professor von Hofsten's two\nsittings at any rate the supposed faultless conditions of control were\ndefective, though he does not claim to have observed any occurrence\nof actual trickery.\nThe Bulletin concludes with \" An Hypothesis suggested as a\nPossible Aid to the Interpretation and Further Investigation of\nPsychical Phenomena \" by Professor Hornell Hart of Bryn Mawr\nCollege. All serious attempts well thought out to interpret and\nexplain psychical phenomena are well worth while, but so far pre-\nscribed programmes of investigation seem doomed to failure by the\nimpossibility of getting the phenomena to occur to order, and I am\nafraid that Professor Hornell Hart's well-meant effort may meet\nwith the same fate.

Their names and addresses are\ngiven above.\nMiss Nea Walker and Admiral the Hon. A. C.

H. Salter in the Chair.\nThe Rev. W. S. Irving read the complete annotated record of a\nsitting with Mrs Leonard.\nHe said that several papers had been read to the Society or printed\nin the Proceedings or Journal in which particular incidents from\nsittings with Mrs Leonard, selected either for their exceptional\nevidential value, or because they illustrated some point which the\nauthor desired to discuss, had been presented to them detached from\ntheir context. Useful as this method of presentation was, it was\nimportant that they should not fail \" to see the wood because of the\ntrees \", and he proposed therefore to read a paper in which a recent\nsitting of his with Mrs Leonard should be reproduced and analysed\nfrom start to finish. It was inevitable in any sitting that some\npoints should be more impressive than others, and he did not suggest\nthat all the incidents which he analysed were particularly striking.\nThe object of the paper was to record in full a sitting which presented\na number of typical incidents, chosen for their illustrative rather\nthan for their evidential value. Unfortunately such a paper clearly\ndid not lend itself to summary.\n\fDecember 1932 A Sitting with Mrs Leonard 337\n[It has been filed in the Society's Rooms and can be seen by any\nmember].\nIn the discussion which followed the Rev. J. W. Hayes asked\nwhether in the lecturer's experience the medium's features or actions\nduring the Personal Control tended to imitate those of the Com-\nmunicator. Mr Irving said that on the whole they did not.\nMr Soal considered that the sitting contained nothing supernormal\nand referred to the difficulty of deciding this point without full\nknowledge of all the circumstances.\nMr Saltmarsh said that when working on the Warren Elliott\nsittings he had carried out control experiments, which produced\nresults only one-fourth or one-fifth as good as the real sittings.\nDr Dingwall agreed with Mr Soal and said that he found it difficult\nto suppose there was anything supernormal whatever in the sitting.\nMr Besterman thought that some of the speakers had failed to\nunderstand the object of the paper, which was merely to present a\ntypical sitting, without regard to its evidential standing. As the\npublished evidence showed there would have been no difficulty in\nselecting a considerable number of highly evidential incidents, only\nof course they would not all occur in the same sitting.\nThe Chairman, Miss Home, and Mrs Baggally also took part in\nthe discussion.\nCASE\nL. 1297. APPARITION NEARLY COINCIDING WITH\nA FRIEND'S DEATH.\nWe have received through Mrs Henry Sidgwick the following account\nof what seems to have been an apparition coinciding with a death. It\nwas seen by the Rev. Prebendary Carlile, the well-known leader of\nthe Church Army, and the account below is by him and was given to\nMrs Sidgwick on 6 October 1932, when, by the kind arrangement of\nLord Daryngton, she had the opportunity of meeting the Prebendary\nand talking over with him the experience.\nHe states :\n\" On Sunday morning, 14 February 1932, 1 went to St\nPaul's Church, Woking, and after Matins stayed for the Holy Com-\nmunion. It has always been my habit, when there, if there were over\n30 Communicants, to offer to assist with the Cup if desired.\n\" As there seemed a need on this occasion, I looked round and was\njust going to offer to help, when I saw a second clergyman standing\nin the chancel, robed ready to assist. Three times I looked, especially\nto see whether the stole was black or purple. On his left in the choir\nwas also a choirman in surplice. After the Celebrant came in to take\nthe service I looked up again and saw the clergyman kneeling in the\ncentre at the Communion Rail, apparently waiting till needed. I\nthen looked again but he had left, and I supposed he was unwell and\nhad retired to the vestry.\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1932\n\" After the service I asked the verger at the door, why they had\nsung a burial hymn that morning. He said it was because the Rev.\nOutram Marshall, late secretary of the E.O.U., had just passed away.\n\" I then went into the vestry to inquire how the other clergyman\nwas. The Curate and the Churchwardens and the robed choirman\nsaid there was no other clergyman present, nor had any of them seen\none. I asked them and my sisters afterwards, whether I appeared to\nbe quite normal, and they all said I was quite as usual.\n\" The priest who had passed away was in the habit of coming;\nwhen well enough, to the weekly Celebration in this church.\n\" He was an old personal and affectionate friend of mine, and I\nwas unaware that he had died ; hence possibly this Visibility was\ngranted to me. I am perfectly certain about what I saw. Similar\nappearances have occurred to many others.\"\nMrs Sidgwick writes : \"Mr Carlile told me that this vision is the\nonly visual experience of a psychical kind that he has ever had,\nthough he has had strong feelings of the presence of a loved person no\nlonger in this world. The figure he saw had its back to him so that he\ndid not see the face, nor did he recognise his friend. In fact when he\nwent into the vestry to inquire how the clergyman he believed himself\nto have seen was, he expected to see, or hear about, a stranger. The\nevidence for the experience having been a psychical one depends\ntherefore on two coincidences difficult to attribute to chance\u2014the\nfact that the vision occurred so soon after the death, and the fact that\nno one else appears to have seen the stranger clergyman at all. The\nexperience undoubtedly greatly impressed Prebendary Carlile him-\nself and those to whom he related it. An account of it was written\nshortly after it occurred and on 18 April I was shown one signed by\nhimself. I could not however pursue the subject further at that time\nas I was ill.\"\nWe have verified from other sources that Mr Outram Marshall's\ndeath did occur on 14 February, but do not know the hour.\nPRELIMINARY NOTES ON THE TRANCE MEDIUMSHIP\nOF FRU INGEBORG KOBER (NEE DAHL).\nBy Theodore Besterman.\n[TJiese notes are extractedfrom afull report of the sittings in question.\nThis has been filed in the Society's Rooms, where it can be inspected by\nany member of the Society. It is not being published at present in the\nhope that the Society may have further opportunities for investigating\nFru Ingeborg.]\nThe circumstances of this case are briefly as follows : Hr Ludvig\nDahl, Byfogd1\nof Fredriksstad, a town in south-east Norway, on the\n1\nThe Byfogd combines the functions of Mayor and Judge.\n\fDecember 1932 Trance Mediumship of Frti Ingeborg Kober 339\neast of the Oslo fjord, about 120 miles south of Oslo, and his wife,\nlost their son Ludvig (born in 1894) in May 1919, as the result of a\nsailing accident, and another son, Kagnar1\n(born 1901), in May\n1924, from tuberculosis. At the end of 1919 some odd phenomena of\na paraphysical kind led to a table-sitting being held at which it\nbecame apparent that Fru Ingeborg Kober, the only daughter of\nJudge and Fru Dahl, was the medium. In the form of raps messages\npurporting to emanate from Ludvig were received, and the experi-\nments were repeated. At first, as Fru Ingeborg then lived in another\npart of the country, progress was slow. It was not until 1923 that\nthe table was replaced by the ouija. From that time the communica-\ntions became more frequent. Judge Dahl gives an ample selection\nfrom them in his books. 2\nApart from the usual type of spirit communications, the medium-\nship of Fru Ingeborg presents several striking features. The most\nremarkable of these are the reading of the contents of sealed enve-\nlopes, the giving of booktests from books in another room, and a few\nphysical phenomena. I was therefore anxious to have sittings with\nFru Ingeborg and approached Judge Dahl through the kind inter-\nmediary of Mr I.C. Grondahl, Lecturer in Norwegian at University\nCollege, London. Judge Dahl very kindly invited me to take part in\nsome sittings, and my wife and I accordingly spent the larger part of\nJidy 1932 in Norway, chiefly in the island of Hanko, in the Oslo\nFjord, on which Judge Dahl has a summer villa.\nDuring the few weeks available to us before we left my wife and I\nacquired as much Norwegian as possible, sufficient in my own case\nto read Norwegian with the help of a dictionary, to follow easy and\nslow conversation, and to follow the messages spelled out on the\nouija. Nevertheless the language difficulties remained serious ; this\nfact and the circumstance of our attending the sittings as guests,\ndecided me to concentrate on those phenomena over which we could\nmost easily keep effective control : namely, booktests and the read-\ning of sealed envelopes. In the case of the latter it was of course\npossible to make the conditions perfect from the beginning. In the\ncase of the booktests, not knowing what conditions might be im-\nposed (none were in fact imposed), and how long it would take to\nobtain such a test, as they occur very rarely, we had arranged a\nseries of progressively stricter tests ; the least strict of these, how-\never, was sufficiently evidential for the purpose of a preliminary\ninvestigation.\nI now proceed to a description of Fru Ingeborg's trance and of the\nconditions under which the sittings are held, so far as these came\nunder our own observation.\n1\nRagnar is usually referred to in the sittings as Skat, which means Darling.\n2\nWe are Here (1931), which is based on three Norwegian books.\na2\n\f340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1032\nThe sitters take their places about, but not at, a round table, and\nsometimes in other parts of the room. The sitter in charge of the\nouija takes his place at the table on the medium's right, and is seated\nat right angles to her. In front of him lies the ouija, a rectangular\nboard measuring ten inches by fourteen inches. Its longer side\nfaces the sitter. Looked at from his point of view, the upper part of\nthe board bears, in curved concave rows, the letters of the alphabet,\na few conventional phrases such as Yes, No, All right, etc. The\nlower part is blank and on this is laid a small triangular pointer on\nthree metal discs, which slides smoothly on them over the surface of\nthe board. The medium is seated at such a distance from the ouija,\nfacing of course its shorter side, that when she stretches out her\nright arm almost to its full extent her hand rests comfortably on the\ntriangular pointer when it is in the middle of the ouija.\nAnother of the sitters, not necessarily in the circle, keeps a record\nof the proceedings. During the ouija trance the communications are\nwritten down from the dictation of the sitter in charge of the ouija\n(the other sitters can see what is being spelled out) ;\nduring the rest\nof the sitting they are taken down in the usual way.\nThe remaining sitters seat themselves as they please, and the\nwhole proceedings are quite informal, absolute silence not being\nimposed, the lighting conditions being normal, and matters going\nforward without fuss or excitement.\nThe sitters having taken their places, the medium stretches out\nher right arm in the manner described, putting her right hand on the\npointer, puts her left elbow on the edge of the table and leans her\nhead on her left hand, with which she covers her closed eyes. At\nseveral of the sittings either my wife or I sat very near the medium\nand at her side, in a position in which her eyes and face could be\nobserved. We are satisfied that when the medium's right hand is\nspelling out messages on the ouija her eyes are in fact closed ; and\neven if they were not that the position of her left hand over her eyes\nwould make anything more than a casual view of the board\nimpossible.\nThis fact at once introduces an element of seeming supernor-\nmality, since it is clear that the medium's hand is not guided by\nsight to the various letters, etc., on the ouija. It is possible that\nlong-continued practice has made the position of the letters so\nfamiliar to the medium that she can find her way about it unseeing.\nI tested this possibility so far as possible during sittings VII, VIII,\nIX, by occasionally not replacing the board in position when it was\naccidentally moved. Even when the board was lying at a consider-\nable angle and several inches from its usual position, the accuracy\nwith which the letters were pointed out was not affected. But of\ncourse such a test is far too crude to be conclusive. A much more\n\fDecember 1932 Trance Mediumship of Fru Ingeborg Kober 341\nconvincing one took place quite by chance in sitting XI. Dr Wereide,\nnot having the ordinary ouija available, used one made by himself.\nThis is a square glazed frame, bigger than the board the medium is\naccustomed to. The letters on it are differently disposed, and the\nmedium had not seen it before the sitting, 1\nnor did she give more than\na casual glance at it in the few moments before she went into trance.\nNevertheless, the spelling out of the communications was hardly\naffected. From time to time the pointer went to the position in\nwhich a given letter would normally have been, but this was excep-\ntional. On the whole the letters were pointed out with certainly not\nless than 90 per cent, of accuracy. This point clearly deserves\nfurther investigation.\nWithin a few moments, at most within two or three minutes of\nsettling herself in position, the medium's breathing becomes irregular\nand stertorous, and she appears to fall into a trance. Her right hand\nthen begins to move the pointer to various letters of the alphabet on\nthe ouija, thus spelling out messages, answers to questions, etc.\nVery occasionally the medium mutters a few words while her hand\ncontinues to move about the board. This part of the sitting I call the\nouija trance.\nIt continues for a period varying from a few minutes to half-an-\nhour or a little more. Then the medium's hand moves slowly away\nfrom the pointer and drops into her lap, as does the other hand ; the\nmedium opens her eyes, her breathing becomes more normal, and\nshe begins to speak. Sometimes, however, the transition is extremely\nabrupt, the ouija communication being broken off even in the middle\nof a sentence, the hand falling suddenly away from the pointer, and\nthe medium sitting up with a violent start. She is now in a trance\ncharacterised by a species of vocal automatism, and she acts as if\nshe sees and speaks to the spirits of deceased persons, usually one or\nboth of her brothers Ludvig and Ragnar. Her eyes move freely, if\nsomewhat rigidly, but as if focussed on a moving point which usually\nremains at a fixed distance just out of her reach. From time to time\nshe makes tentative gestures, as if reaching out to touch the object,\ne.g. one of the brothers, on which her eyes are fixed, and then realising\nthat it is out of reach. Sometimes the medium appears to see the\nobject moving away from her, as may be gathered from her gestures\nand words, and then her eyes seem to follow it to a more distant\n1\n1 asked Dr Wereide for a statement on these points, and he writes in reply\n:\n\" I can inform you that the ouija board had not been seen by Mrs Ingeborg\nbefore. Always when she has been here (about 6-7 times in all) she has carried\nher own ouija board with her. When I arranged the meeting with you here I\ndid not know that she would be here at all. The same day you came here she\ntelephoned and said she had been ordered by Ludvig to come here. I thought\nshe would take her ouija board with her, but as she did not I must use the\none we had.\"\n\f342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1932\npoint. This usually happens towards the end of this part of the\nsitting. From time to time the medium rubs her right shoulder, as if\nit was being irritated or touched.\nThe medium's expression changes rapidly and constantly : joy,\nfear, amusement, unhappiness, affection, terror, almost the whole\ngamut of emotions, follow each other in rapid succession, and often\nexpress more than the words spoken. This is often so to a surprising\nextent : the medium's expression may indicate that she is in extreme\nfear, while the words she speaks simultaneously hardly denote more\nthan a little anxiety. From time to time the medium appears to be\nspeaking with her brothers more directly, as it were, or intimately,\nthan usual, and then an expression of great and almost maternal\naffection, touching to observe, comes over her face. (It must be\nremembered that the brothers died at the ages of 25 and 23 respec-\ntively, while the medium is now 37). This stage I call the speaking\ntrance.\nWhen this is drawing to an end, and for some moments after, the\nmedium appears terrified : she clutches the hand of whoever is\nseated at her right (usually Judge Dahl), strokes his face repeatedly,\nthen touches the table, the curtain, other nearby objects, pinches\nherself, looks round intently, until she is finally reassured and come to\ncompletely. This process is sometimes painful to watch, and was so\nparticularly in sittings VII, VIII, IX, in which my wife and I had\nconsiderable difficulty in comforting the medium. This intermediate\nstage between the speaking trance and the regaining of full conscious-\nness I call the waking trance, though Judge Dahl uses this name for\nthe whole post-ouija part of the sitting. There is no doubt, however\nI think, that the two stages, the speaking and waking trance, are\ndistinct. During this stage the medium, as will be gathered, gradually\nloses \" contact \" with her brothers and becomes aware of her sur-\nroundings. These two processes overlap and it is often difficult to\ndraw a hard and fast line both at the beginning and at the end of the\nwaking trance. Further, the speaking trance is sometimes in-\nterrupted by a return to ouija communication.\nWhen the medium has come out of trance, she sometimes remains\nslightly distracted for a few moments ;\non one occasion she felt\nimpelled to say a few words which were relevant to what had taken\nplace in the sitting, but the meaning of which the medium did not\nappear to appreciate, for she apparently has no memory of what\noccurred during the sitting. A somewhat unusual feature is the fact\nthat the medium invariably comes out of trance with a very sharp\nthirst.\nI now turn to the results of the sittings.\nThe sealed envelopes. There is no need to enlarge on the results of\nthe experiment with sealed envelopes. The Communicators stated\n\fDecember 1932 Trance Mediumship of Fru Ingeborg Kober 343\nthat they had read the contents of three of these, but preferred to\ncommunicate them in my absence. I understand from Judge Dahl\nthat this promise has been repeated since our departure, but at\npresent (November 1932) nothing definite has occurred. So further\ndevelopment may perhaps still be looked for.\nThe booktest. We had prepared nine newly-bought volumes of\npocket size. On our arrival at the hotel these were placed, as bought,\non a table in our room. But the books were not all continuously on\nthis table : once or twice a day one or other of the books was taken\naway for one purpose or another. We chose for the first test\nFielding's The Adventures of Joseph Andrews (No. CCCXXXIV in\nThe World's Classics), a book we had both read before some years\nago, but in quite a different edition ;\nx\nwe were careful not to open it,\nand consequently had no notion what appeared on any particular\npage. We knew, of course, the name of the hero, and the names of\nParson Adams, Fanny, Joseph, and Lady Booby appear on the jacket\nof the book. The medium stated afterwards that the book is un-\nknown to her.\nAt the first two sittings I had brought a sealed envelope in my\npocket. In view of what the Communicator said at Sitting II (that\nthey would prefer a letter which was not brought to the sitting) I\nsubstituted Joseph Andrews for the envelope in Sitting IV and on-\nwards. I mentioned this fact (without specifying the book) to Judge\nDahl and to Hr Fridtjof Dahl before the beginning of Sitting IV.\nAfter each Sitting we returned to our hotel and put back the book\nwith the others on the table. Between the placing of the book in\nmy pocket and the replacing of it on the table it never left my\npocket.\nThe Communicators first clearly referred to the proposed booktest\nin Sitting V, saying :\n\" With reference to that little booktest, we\nmust find the opportunity. On such an occasion the conditions must\nbe the very best, is that not so ? You certainly understand that.\nBut an attempt we are wining to make.\"\nIn Sitting VII the Communicators, in response to my request,\nagain affirmed their intention to try the booktest. In Sitting VIII\nthey finally did so. The significant part of the test reads as follows,\nomitting repetitions and interpolations :\n\" I take the first section at\ntop on page 49, Jos. Joseph. Having put . . . something about his\ncoat. . . . Something about a man, Jo, Joseph. . . . There was\nforty-nine.\" Page 49 of Joseph Andrews is reproduced and the reader\ncan judge for himself of the accuracy of the booktest, which I regard\nas definitely successful, even allowing for the bibbcal associations\n1\nThis is unfortunately no longer in our possession. Its lay-out was so\ndifferent from that of the edition in The World's Classics that different matter\nmust certainly have appeared on the relevant page.\n\f344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1932\nbetween the name \" Joseph \" and the word \" coat.\" It is not\nimpossible that the medium's \" He [Joseph] put something in my\nmouth, I choked,\" which followed, is a reference to the passage in the\nnext paragraph on the same page.\nCh. 12. Joseph Andrews, &c. 49\nwho hath been since transported for robbing a hen-\nroost) had voluntarily stript off a great coat, his only\ngarment, at the same time swearing a great oath (for\nwhich he was rebuked by the passengers) 'That he\nwould rather ride in his shirt all his life, than suffer\na fellow-creature to lie in so miserable a condition.'\nJoseph, having put on the great coat, was lifted into\nthe coach, which now proceeded on its journey. He\ndeclared himself almost dead with the cold, which\ngave the man of wit an occasion to ask the lady, if\nshe could not accommodate him with a dram. She\nanswered with some resentment, 'She wondered at\nhis asking her such a question ; but assured him she\nnever tasted any such thing.'\nThe lawyer was enquiring into the circumstances of\nthe robbery, when the coach stopt, and one of the\nruffians putting a pistol in, demanded their money of\nthe passengers ; who readily gave it them ; and the\nlady, in her fright, delivered up a little silver bottle,\nof about a half-pint size, which the rogue, clapping it\nto his mouth, and drinking her health, declared held\nsome of the best Nantes he had ever tasted : this the\nlady afterwards assured the company was the mistake\nof her maid ; for that she had ordered her to fill the\nbottle with Hungary Water.\nAs soon as the fellows were departed, the lawyer,\nwho had, it seems, a case of pistols in the seat of the\ncoach, informed the company, that if it had been\nday-light, and he could have come at his pistols, he\nwould not have submitted to the robbery ; he likewise\nset forth, that he had often met highwaymen when\nhe travelled on horseback, but none ever durst attack\nhim ;\nconcluding, that if he had not been more afraid\nfor the lady than for himself, he should not have now\nparted with his money so easily.\nAs wit is generally observed to love to reside in\nempty pockets ; so the gentleman, whose ingenuity\nwe have above remarked, as soon as he had parted\nThere is no reason why a booktest should not be arranged for in\ncompletely evidential conditions. The conditions of the present\ntest, which was intended to be the first of a series, were certainly not\ncompletely evidential. They were, however, sufficiently so to make a\nsupernormal explanation highly probable and to make out a case for\nfurther investigation.\n\fDecember 1932 Trance Mediumship of Fru Ingeborg Kober 345\nPhysical phenomenon. The only other attempt at a supernormal\nphenomenon that came under our observation, did not succeed.\nThis was an attempt in Sittings IX and XI to materialise a hair.\nIt is now mv agreeable duty to acknowledge my indebtedness.\nFirst of all I should like to put on record our great appreciation of Fru\nIngeborg's generosity in devoting the larger part of eleven sittings to\nus in twelve days, during more than one of which she was far from\nwell and worried by the illness of her little girl and boy (a mild\nepidemic swept the island during our stay). Her immediate ac-\nquiescence in all our proposals, and her most kind attention to us\nmade our observation of her mediumship more a pleasure than a duty.\nAll this applies very fully also to Judge and Fru Dahl, who at no\ntime raised any objections of any kind, gave us a free hand, and\nshowed us the utmost kindness and hospitality. Frk. Kynning,\nMiss Lipscomb, and Hr Fridtjof Dahl, gave us every possible help.\nDr and Fru Wereide kindly allowed us to be present at the sitting at\ntheir home. Lord Charles Hope made a welcome contribution to the\nexpenses of the journey.\nFinally, I must express my great indebtedness to Mr Grondahl.\nwhose constant help and genial personality greatly contributed to\nthe success of the sittings.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nMASS EXPERIMEXTS IX TELEPATHY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014I have read with interest Dr William Brown's comments in\nProceedings (Part 127) on my recent work in experimental telepathy.\nI need hardly say that I agree with Dr Brown that such experiments\ncannot disprove the existence of a telepathic faculty in the case of\ncertain rare individuals, though they undoubtedly show that such\nindividuals are extremely hard to find, since a broadcast appeal fails\nto discover them. Dr Brown however appears to me to be under a\nmisapprehension when he goes on to say that \" the negative results\n\u2014that is the failures\u2014 swamp the successes to such an extent that\nthe results show nothing of the activity of telepathy \"\n(p. 80). In\npoint of fact more than 200 persons continued the experiments over\na period of 15-27 weeks and each individual's record was kept on a\nseparate card and carefully studied. The advantage of working with\nlarge numbers is that it enables us to discover what is the average\nperformance in the various tests. Chance alone of course will always\nproduce a certain percentage of persons whose success is much higher\nthan this average. Then it is usually possible to arrange further\nexperiments to test this small minority. But whenever I have\n\f346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1932\ncarried out these additional tests I have invariably found that these\napparently \" successful \" persons in the major test entirely fail to go\non producing successful results, thus demonstrating that in all\nprobability their original successes were simply examples of the\nextreme fluctuations of chance.\nI am in entire agreement with Dr Brown that progress is likely to\nbe made by a more intensive study of individuals who appear to\npossess supernormal powers of perception. But where are such in-\ndividuals to be found who can produce results under experimental\nconditions ? I have yet to meet the individual who can obtain a\nmean score exceeding 15-18 with 25 playing cards and then do it\nagain with another 25 cards. Dr Prince tells me that besides Mrs\nUpton Sinclair he does not know of a single person who can demon-\nstrate experimental telepathy in America. I certainly do not know\nof a single person in England who is capable of producing experimen-\ntal results that will satisfy a rigorous scientific inquiry. Should any\nof your readers believe themselves to be acquainted with anyone who\nhas an indisputable telepathic gift I should be only too willing to\narrange some experiments with him or her even though he may not\nbe able to get a score of 15-18 with playing cards.\nYours, etc.,\nS. G. Soal.\nREVIEWS.\nGeorge Lawton, The Drama of Life after Death : A Study of the\nSpiritualist Reliyion. 8vo, pp. xxvi. 668, 21 ill. New York :\nHenry Holt and Co., 1932. Price $3-75.\nThis is an astonishing book, baffling not only to the reader and\nreviewer but also, it would appear, to the publisher. For on the\nwrapper appears this legend :\n\" This is a study of human beings, not\nbooks ; and of hopes and fears, not theories. For the tragic question,\n'\nIf a man die, shall he live again ?\n'\nhas oppressed the race of men\nsince the beginning and will to the end. Of the countless solutions of\nthis riddle, not one offers so realistic and earthy a hereafter as that\ndescribed in this book.\" But this is a wholly inaccurate description\nof the contents. Mr Lawton, who is an instructor in philosophy in\nthe College of the City of New York, has set out to obtain from\nspiritualist books, lectures and conversations, a general picture of\nthe Spiritualist creed : he concerns himself with beliefs and per-\nsonalities, not with evidence ; he nowhere discusses survival as an\nevidential problem, and he certainly does not offer any \" realistic\nand earthy hereafter \" except in so far as he reproduces and collates\nSpiritualist statements. He is not himself a Spiritualist : his atti-\ntude is summed up in the paragraph, \" All religious systems are\n\fDecember 1932 Reviews 347\ntherapeutic, not descriptive, and their vitality depends on the\ndegree to which they transform, through the imagination, the simple\nbrute facts of suffering, frustration and death, into something that\nwill not hurt so much. Now Spiritualism is simply one way among\nmany others of attempting an adjustment to the problems and\ndenials of life. Spiritualism is therefore to be accepted or rejected\nfor the same reasons that we accept or reject other systems of belief\n\u2014its capacity of compensating us for our frustrations, releasing our\ntensions, and its possession of a sufficient degree of internal agree-\nment to meet our intellectual standards.\" This is surely not a very\nhelpful avenue of approach to an examination of Spiritualism, for\nit is precisely the claim of Spiritualism to rest on a basis of scientific\nevidence that distinguishes it from other religions. It is perhaps due\nto Mr Lawton's fundamentally mistaken way of approach that the\ncontents of this book do not hang together in any sort of sequence.\nI find it impossible to discover what Mr Lawton set out to do\u2014except\nin isolated sections\u2014and where he supposes, at the end of over 600\npages, that he has arrived.\nThe first part of the book describes at length the general outline\nof Spiritualist beliefs, so far as it is possible for the author to collate\nthese. There are pages after pages of extracts from writings so\ndifferent as Raymond, Alan's Alaine (a recent novelette by an Ameri-\ncan Spiritualist), and the works of Andrew Jackson Davis. Mr\nLawton admits that there is not much uniformity in Spiritualist\nteachings, but he claims to have tried to discover certain main\ntrends. In this he has certainly succeeded, though at the expense of\nmore space and energy than many would think necessary, and by\nconcentrating very largely on American Spiritualism.\nPart Two of the book is an examination of Spiritualism as an\norganised religious body. Once again the author draws from all\nkinds of material\u2014some of it, such as the quotation of an appeal of\nSpiritualists to wear \" recognition badges,\" with no fewer than five\nillustrations of these, surely of no value whatever\u2014and over 200\npages are given to this subject. Nor, for that matter, is the informa-\ntion very accurate ; Mr Lawton has rashly relied too much on Hart-\nmann's works of reference and similar unreliable sources. Thus on\npage 152 are thrown together as \" Psychical Eesearch Societies \" all\nbodies whose names contain or suggest that purpose, regardless of\nwhat these societies actually stand for ; so that the S.P.R. is made\nto rub shoulders with the British College of Psychic Science, the\nSociety for the Study of Supernormal Pictures, and other hetero-\ngeneous organisations. And I doubt whether the \" Dialectical\nSociety of London \", even if it were not long defunct, would be claimed\nby anybody except Mr Lawton as an English Spiritualist society.\nOn page 375, the beginning of the third part of his book, the writer\n\f348 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1932\nappears at last willing to come to grips with his subject, but once\nagain the reader will be disappointed. We are told at inordinate\nlength why many people wish to believe in survival and then Mr\nLawton reverts to such by-paths of psychology as the \" Benefits\naccruing to Pathological Spiritualists from Communication.\" On\npage 530 he begins to discuss the functions and equipment of\npsychical research, but for some reason limits this investigation to\n\" those researchers only who serve as theologians of the Spiritualist\nmovement and who are regarded as such by the Spiritualists\n\"\u2014his\nitalics\u2014and afterwards declares that\n'\n' the most obvious and genuine\ndistinction between the Spiritualist and the researcher is ... a\nclass or social one. With exceedingly few exceptions psychical\nresearch societies, though perhaps intended to be centres for the\nscientific collection and appraisal of evidence, have actually become\na very high type of Spiritualist organisation ;\nthey are churches for\nthe spiritual and Spiritualist elect.\" Mr Lawton devotes his last\nhundred or so pages to discussing the contemporary sources of\nstrength and weakness for the survival of the Spiritualist creed and,\nwith a large but uneven bibliography, this curiously unsatisfactory\nvolume ends. I cannot remember opening a book with more interest\nor putting one down with a greater sense of disappointment.\nC. E. Bechhofer Egberts.\nSir J. Arthur Thomson, Scientific Riddles. 8vo. pp. 384. London :\nWilliams and Norgate, Ltd., 1932. Price 10s. 6d. net.\nSir J. Arthur Thomson is not a member of the S.P.R. and is one\nof the few men of science outside the Society who have taken some\ntrouble to examine our evidence. Chapters XLII, XLIII and XLIV\nof this book are entitled respectively \" Is Telepathy a Fact ?\n\"\n\" What lies behind Clairvoyance ?\n\" and \" How Explain Crystal-\ngazing 1\n\" Sir Arthur's treatment of the evidence is not at all\nunfair on the whole, although he is inclined to charge the S.P.R. with\noverlooking normal explanations of some of the phenomena\u2014which\nis not the fact. 1\nAlso, in criticising the evidence for telepathy, he\ndraws attention\u2014without citing specific instances\u2014to the faintness\nof coincidence between the agent's thought and the percipient's\nimpression. I suspect that he is thinking of some of the vague co-\nincidences occurring in a series of experiments, and that he has over-\nlooked the fact that these vague coincidences form part of a series of\ncoincidences in which close coincidences are found.\nIn his Introduction (p. 11) the writer says :\n\" But the moment we\n1\nAs the author does not state to what particular reports he is referring, it\nmay be that his criticisms are not directed against evidence published by our\nSociety\u2014of whose work, by the way, he speaks with respect. But my impres-\nsion is that it is the evidence published by the S.P.R. which he has in mind.\n\fDecember 1032 Reviews 349\nask such questions as : Is there a design in evolution % or Can per-\nsonality survive bodily death ? we are beyond science, though not\nnecessarily off the pathway to Reality or off the way to Truth.\" Yet\nhe evidently does not think that it is \" beyond science \" to ask such a\nquestion as \" Is Telepathy a fact ?\n\" Why, then, should it be\n\" beyond science \" to ask \" Can personality survive bodily death ?\n\"\nIt seems to me that this latter problem is one to be investigated by\nmuch the same methods as the problem of telepathy. Since he does\nnot, explicitly at least, take the line that telepathy, if a fact, must\nbe a physical process, Sir Arthur Thomson appears to be inconsistent\nin placing the problem of survival outside the province of science,\nwhile treating the problem of telepathy as one within that province.\nAll questions of this sort ultimately turn on what particular defini-\ntion is given of the word \" Science \". Has Sir Arthur Thomson been\nconsistent in his use of the word ?\nJ. G. P.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nTijdschrift voor Parapsychologie, 1932.\nJanuary. C.
