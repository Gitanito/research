Ghosts was abandoned after its first issue and was merged into this journal, which appeared monthly.  Magic was primarily devoted to stage magic but attempted to include a rational presentation of spiritualism, occultism and magic from a historical perspective.  The journal\u2019s first issue said that it \"is intended to create a wider and more intelligent interest in a most attractive subject \u2014 to make more appreciative audiences for magical entertainers, and new devotees of a fascinating hobby.\"   Contributions by Henry Ridgely Evans and Harry Houdini.
