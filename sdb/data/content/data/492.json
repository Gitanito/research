Two Telepathic Impressions.\nWe jjrint below wliat appear to be two instances of tele-\npathic impressions passing between Miss Ida Wild and her\nsister. Miss Ida Wild is an Associate of the Society, and an\nearlier instance of telepathy between her sister and herself\n(in the form of a dream) was printed in the Journal for October\n1925 (Vol. XXII. p. 120 ff). At the time when the experiences\ndescribed below occurred Miss Ida Wild was in Devonshire\nand her sister was in London.\nOn July 30th, 1926, Miss Ida Wild wrote to the Editor, Mrs.\nSalter, as follows :\nOld Larkshayes,\nDalwood, Kilmington,\nS. Devon.\nHere are two instances of telepathy (?) between my sister Ann\nWild, and myself, both within a few days, one from her to me,\none from me to her.\nIt may seem odd that as I was so worried 1 waited till Thurs-\nday to telegraph. We live, however, three and a half miles from\nthe nearest office, and on Wednesdays from half time, five miles\nis our nearest, and I have a very busy life of routine. . . .\nIda Wild.\nEnclosed with this letter was the following statement\n:\nI. The Elm-Tree. (From I. W. to A. W.)\nWhile A. was home, we decided the elms must come down\nbefore Winter. Trim told us we had better wait for Fall. That\n\/\n\f2 Journal oj Society for Psychical Research January, 1927\nis the last A. heard ori th\". subjfict, She went away in June.\nOn July 21st, the goats broke down the hurdling under the elms,\nand there was a regular hunt to get them down to the paddock.\nAt once, I told Trim that we must have proper fixed fencing by\nthe coach-house in place of hurdling. On July 23rd, the men\ngot driven by bees, and after dinner brought out the tools for\nthrowing the trees, Trim saying that it was a pity to start fixed\nfencing now and then have to destroy it with tree-throwing in\nFall. Thus the idea of tree-felling was not earlier than 21st,\nwhen I told T. of the fence. The danger was, the elm might\nfall in the lane and over neighbouring orchard-land, so they\nlopped and nicked to turn it clear N. down our orchard. I\ndo not believe it could have fallen E. over coach-house. As\nit was, they were not quite ready for it to part when it gave a\ngreat circular twitch, and fell W. into the garden, and over\norchard gate. They were hours clearing it, and the '\nrace-\ncourse '\nfence is only just (29th) repaired.\n(See A. W.'s letter date, 29-7-26. Also I. W.'s diary, 23-7-26.)\nWith the above statement was enclosed a letter from Miss\nAnn Wild to her sister, from which we quote the following\nextract\n:\n29 Palace Gate, W. 8,\n29-7-26.\n... I am simply kicking myself about the elm tree because on\nThursday or Friday, [July 22 or 23] I dreamt that it fell, but over\nthe tin-tab and broke it. I ought to have written at once or\ntold my dream. No evidence now.\nAnn.\nAlthough this case lacks corroboration, we print it here\nbecause we have other better attested instances of telepathy\nbetween Miss Ida Wild and her sister. With her letter of\nJuly 30th, 1926, Miss Ida Wild enclosed a further statement\nas follows :\nII. Telegram to Ann. (From A. W. to I. W.)\nOn Tuesday, 27th, I had a strong feeling of '\nwoe '\nand unease,\nwhat you call '\npresentiment.' It was with me at rising, and\nincreased aU day, in spite of a strenuous day. I tried through\n1 = tin-tab [see below].\n\fJanuary, 1927 Cases 3\nmy diet of the last few days for a reason, but couldn't find one !\nDuring tlie afternoon and evening, I was almost '\nfit to be tied\n\"\nwhen I beard motor-bicycles, thinking I should get a telegram to\nsay A. was dead or dying or mutilated. I hadn't any reason\nfor believing her ill ;\nthough she is never extra robust, she is\ngenerally fairly fit. On Wednesday I was busy plucking fowls,\netc., and sat in a linhay where I could see the road, and the\nsound of a bicycle (motor) made me nearly ill. I may say, I\nwas absolutely sure I should have had a card or note a.m. Wednes-\nday, but none came. Thursday I went to Axminster early, and\ntalked to the man who drives me about my anxiety ; he was\nairy about it, and said \" No news, good news,\"' and tried to per-\nsuade me I was nervous, quite unlike me, as he admitted. I\nsent a wire (I had of course again had no letter a.m.) to Ann,\n\" Please don't be annoyed at this telegram, but are you quite\nall right ?\n\" Her answer never arrived at O.L. tiU nearly 5 p.m.\n(See A. W.'s note 29-7-26, also my diary, 27th July.)\nThe letter from Miss Ann Wild to her sister referred to\nabove was as follows :\n29 Palace Gate, W. 8.\n29-7-26.\n. . . Your telegram came about 12 and the reply I sent was\nretiirned to me an hour later for a fuller address, which delay I\nregret.\nIn case it was a dream that prompted it and you thought I\nwas ill, I am as fit as a fiddle now. But on Tuesday my tummy\nwent wrong and during the night I felt awful bad and thought\n\" Now I've got appendicitis right enough.\" In case you didn't\nhave a dream but I neglected to write, it was the rottenness\nof my innards on Tuesday that kept me lazy. . . .\nAnn.\nMiss Ida Wild also sent us some pages from her diary, from\nwhich we quote the following extracts :\nJuly 23rcZ, Friday.\n... In morning T. and S. got stung while I was out. So later\nthey threw one of the two elms by coach-house, and it proved\nrotten, so that instead of falling as they nicked it, it crashed\n\fi Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1927\nthrough our new race-course fencing all over the garden !

Book-Tests.\nA NUMBER of book-tests obtained at Mr. living's sittings have\nalready been published in Proceedings (see '\nA Report on Some\nRecent Sittings with Mrs. Leonard,\" by Mrs. W. H. Salter^\nVol. XXXVI. pp. 207-263). In particular attention may be\ncalled to the incidents related on pp. 239-251, for the book-\ntests and other veridical statements there discussed are con-\ncerned with the same house and room, though not the same\nbookshelves, as the book-test now to be reported. On each\noccasion the statements made at the sitting seem to have been,\nunusually accurate,^ suggesting that in some way a good\n\" rapport \" had been set up. Mr. and Mrs. Y., from whose\nhouse the tests were taken, have never sat with Mrs. Leonard\nand had no personal acquaintance with her. Concerning his.\nacquaintance with Mr. and Mrs. Y., Mr. Irving wrote (op. cit^\np. 245) :\n\" Mr. Y. is the son of some old friends of mine who live in a\nparish in which I used to be interested. Mr. Y. is now married\nand lives in town. In recent years I had met him but seldom,\nand at the time of the sitting [September 23, 1924] knew nothing\nof his business or occupation. I had visited his house for the\nfirst time and dined with him and his wife on the Sunday imme^\ndiately before the sitting, and after dinner we had talked on\npsychical matters. I told him some of my experiences in research,\nand said that it would be interesting if my communicator would\ngive me a book-test, or other tests, from his house. My wife had\nknown him in life fairly well.\"\nThe name and address of Mr. and Mrs. Y. are known to-\nthe Society, but are not given here. '\n.\n.\n1 See communicator's statement at the- sitting, p. 7 below.\n\fJanuaet, 1927 Cases 5\nTests were also obtained from Mr. Y.'s house at a sitting on\nSeptember 21, 1925. These have not been pubUshed. Mr.\nIrving says of them :\n\" Taken as a whole I think they are\na good series, but not quite so good as the other two. The\nlast book-tests are marred by an obvious mistake.\" Mrs. Salter\nhas seen the record of this sitting and agrees with Mr. Irving's\nverdict.\nExtract frotn. a Sittin\/j with Mrs. Leonard, Tuesday, January 26, 1926.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Dingwall.\nFeda. Now, Mr. Bill, she's [the communicator, Mrs. Irving] got\nsome more book-tests.\nW. S. L Good.\nF. Wait a minute. The next one isn't Mrs. Twonnie's, and\nit's not your home, but it's a house you've been to\nbefore\u2014not at home, Mr. Bill, here. She's given other\nbook-tests from the same place, Mr. Bill, but it's not\nwhere Mr. George was [the Rooms of the London\nSpiritualist Alliance], nor the Psychical 'Searchers, or\nany of those places. It's a private place you've been\nin before, and she's been interested in, and she's had\nsome quite good book-tests from. Wait a bit, Mr. Bill,\nshe's building up a big letter B while she's talking of\nthis. And she's talking of a house in London, not\nquite right in London, she says, just outside. It's not\nquite in London. She keep on saying, \" Just outside.\"\nNear to London, but sufficiently outside to have some\ngardens and trees round about and near it. Wait a\nminute. She's showing me a room again. I know she's\ntook me to this room before : not a very large room,\nbut a comfortable room. It's got a kind feeling, like\na nice\u2014you know, like a room that's like a nice, fat,\nkind aunt,\nW- S. L Aunt ?\nI\"- Yes. Well, Dora [the communicator] says, \" It's got a\nlived-in feeling, a homely feeling.\" Yes, aunties what\nis fat is homely ! And, Mr. Bill\n\u2014\nW. S. L Yes ?\nF. There's some shelves of books in this room in a very\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1927\npronounced position. You couldn't mistake them\u2014you\njust walk straight across from the door to them. (Feda\nindicates opposite the door, straight in front.) There\nmay be a few more in other parts of the room, but these\nare the most noticeable. Now she worked downwards.\nW. S. I. Worked ?\nF. Yes, she went to what she felt was the top shelf, and\nshe doesn't often go to top ones. [Note 1.]\nFirst of all will you enquire if there's been a box removed\nfrom this room near where the books are ? I can't tell\nif it's a large or a small box, but I know it is a box.\n[Note 2.]\nShe says, \" While I was feeling the first few books, on the\ntop shelf, I had such a strong feeling, such a strong\nfeeling of figures\u2014as if one of these first few books\ndealt particularly \"\u2014Too quick !\n\u2014\" with figures.\" That\ndidn't interest Dora, but she noticed it. Wait a minute.\nBut it took her back, it reminded her of something she\nhad to do here, Mr. Bill, in connexion with figures, not\nthat she did once or twice, but that she did reg-u-Zar-ly.\nIt's something you will remember too. Now, wait a\nminute, Dora. This is 'portant, Mr. Bill, in a way.\nShe's showing me a little book, rather a flat book, and\nshe pretending to be awful careful adding up pennies in\nthis flat book. She says, \" Not only pennies, shillings\nand pounds.\" And this is something she did here that\nthese first few books will remind you of, Mr. Bill. She\nused to make rather a fuss, a point of it, when she was\nhere, Mr. Bill. You used to notice it, and talk about\nit, with lier, Mr. Bill, but she was the one to do it.\nShe says, \" I know you'll be reminded of it directly\nyou see these books ; and you've got one book that I\nused for that piu-pose at home still. [Note 3.]\nNow she took the fifth book from the left. Wait a\nminute. On the twenty-second page-\u2014I'm not going to\nsay twenty-tooth any longer, twenty-second ;\npeople\ncan't laugh at me then ! Reference to eating and\nthings to eat, which will remind you of what you've\nbeen doing recently. That's you, Mr. Bill. [Note 4.]\nNow, wait a minute. \" But further along, page 89, there\n\fJandaet, 1927 Cases 7\nis a very good reference to a place and scenery that\nyou and I talked about, wanted to see, when I was\nhere on the earth with you.\" [Note 5.]\nNow on the shelf below to the right hand side\u2014wait a\nminute !\n\u2014reminded her very much of\u2014seemed so funny\n\u2014Baronets. Titles, but particularly Baronets. I know\nwhat that is, Mr. Bill. Gentlemen what's made knights\nare always so dreadful cross 'cos they wasn't Baro-\nknights, 'cos I've got two or three what's sitters.\nDora says, \" A distinct reference to Baronets, just at\nthe distinct right hand end of the shelf below the top\none. Something to do with history. [Note 6.]\nHistory too on this shelf. A book towards the left of\nthis shelf that deals with history, I feel not one\nparticular period of history, but over several\nperiods, quite a long period. You said several ? Yes,\nshe says, Mr. Bill, that it's this book about history\n\u2022 that she wants you to take next. She hasn't got the\nnumber of the book, but it's the left hand end of this\nsame shelf. That's right. Have you got that ?\nW. S. I. Yes.\nF. It'll be unmistakable, and she wants you just to look\ninside it. On page 1-8, 18, and there there is a re-\nference to a picture, a picture you have got at home,\none that you like, not a new one, one you've had a long\ntime. That's right. That's right. She thinks that\nyou'U be specially interested in this one, Mr. BOl,\nbecause it is a picture that's connected with Dora.\n[Note 7.]\nNow, Mr. Bill, she doesn't anticipate that you'll have any\ndifficulty about tracing this room, and she says it has\ngiven her a good condition before when she's tried.\nMr. Bill, she says, it isn't the rooms themselves, you\nknow, it's the people who've had the rooms that make\nit easy, or difficult for her.\nNotes by Mr. Irving.\n1. From the above description I recognised this house as Mr.\nY.'s house at Hampstead. Series of book-tests, and other tests,\nmany of them good, were taken from here in September 1924 and\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1927\nSeptember 1925. On the latter occasion I had been asked by\nFeda, \" Do you know if there's some one whose name begins with\nB. connected with this room, or house 1 \" This settled the matter\nto my mind. After the sitting I went to Hampstead, found Mr.\nY. at home, and secured his help in verifying the tests. I had\nnot been in his house since September 1925, and no former tests\nhave been taken from these particular shelves, the former tests\nbeing from shelves behind glass over a bureau, to the right front\nas you enter this room. The shelves from which the tests this\ntime are taken are opposite the door, some eight in number, and\nextend from floor to ceiling. They are very conspicuous.\n2. Mr. y. had to consult his Wife about this. A box-gramo-\nphone had been borrowed by a relation, and taken from the house,\nabout a fortnight before the sitting. It had been brought back\non the Saturday, January 23, 1926. This gramophone is always\nkept under a table about two yards in front of the bookshelves.\nIn appearance it is like an ordinary good-sized box : the gramo-\nphone is inside it.\n3. The books on the top shelf were small, many of them thin\nlittle note-books. The 17th book from the left\u2014which was only just\nover a span ^ from that end of the shelf\u2014was a small red-covered\nnote-book. On the inside of the cover, at the beginning of the\nbook, was a Calendar, at the end a \" Table of Weights and\nMeasures and Foreign Coinage.\" Inside were Mr. Y.'s accounts\nduring a trip abroad. On one page I found hotel bills for\n\u00a31 18s., 15s. 2d., \u00a31 2s. 3d. This book at once reminded me of\nthe little book in which my wife used to put down the accounts\nfor \" washing.\" On my return home I found this book. It\nseems to be a similar red-covered note-book, the only difference\nbeing that on the inside back cover is \" Henderson's Merchant's\nEeady Reckoner, showing the relative Values of the Standard\nWeights,\" instead of the \" Table of Weights and Measures and\n'\nForeign Coinage.\" I frequently saw my wife adding up the\naccounts in this book.\n4. The fifth book from the left on the top shelf was \" In Praise\nof Walking.\" \" Thoreau, Whitman, Hazlett, Burroughs.\" Pub-\nlished by A. C. Field, 44 Fleet Street, E. C. On page 22 I only\nfound, \" The story of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a\nwolf. . . . The founders of every state . . . have drawn theii\nhand's span.\n\f\u2022January, 1927 Cases 9\nnourishment and vigour from a similar wild source.\" On page 23,\nhowever (which touches page 22 when the book is closed) I\nfound:\nThere is a difference between eating and drinking for\nstrength, and from mere gluttony. . . . The Hottentots\neagerly devour the marrow of the Koodoo and other\nAntelopes, raw . . . they have stolen a march on the\ncooks of Paris. . . . This is probably better than stall-\nfed beef and slaughter-house pork, to make a man of.\nI must now quote a few sentences from Feda, given a little\nlater at this sitting\n:\nJ'eda. But I don't think he has ! He's been eating something\nwith currants in ? Mr. Bill, it only sounds a little\nthing, but she doesn't like you to eat things with\ncurrants in, and you've been eating something with\ncurrants. She doesn't like it, Mr. Bill. Isn't it a\n- noosance ! Only a little thing, but she thinks you'll\nknow what she means.\nAbout two hours before the sitting I had stopped at Purley\nStation Hotel for luncheon. The Menu was as follows :\n\"\nSoup,\nEoast Beef and Yorkshire Pudding, or Roast Pork and Apple\nSauce. Currant Pudding. Sauce.\" I had Roast Beef and Cur-\nrant Pudding. In order to show that the Menu a day or two\nafter would not have agreed with the test, I copied it out while\nlunching there on the following Thursday, two days later. It was\nthen :\n\" Soup, Boiled Beef, or Mutton Cutlets. Potatoes, Sprouts.\nPears and Cream. Rice Pudding and Prunes.\"\n5. On page 89 I found: \"I should on this -account like well\nenough to spend the whole of my time in travelling abroad.\" And\n\u2022on page 88 (which touches page 89 when the book is closed:\n\" Nothing remains but the Bourbons and the French people.\nThere is undoubtedly a sensation in travelling into foreign parts.\"\nA few days before her last . illness began my wife said to me :\n\"All being well, next year we'll go to Paris, if the War's over,\nand stay with Dickie and Paul.\" \" Dickie \" is one of my wife's\nmarried sisters, who was then Hving in Paris, while her husband\n\" Paul \" was at the front. My wife and I have never travelled\nabroad together, and I cannot recall that we ever planned to go\nto any other place beforehand like that. The above quotation is\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1927\nis not from memory. It is written down among some \" sayings\n\"\nof my wife which I have preserved.\n6. The last sentence may possibly belong to the next test ; it is\nimpossible to tell. The 9th book from the right, on the top shelf\nbut one, was \" Chippinge, A Historical Novel,\" by Stanley\nWeyman. Nelson & Sons, London. Although the book is the 9th\nfrom the right, it was only just over a span from the end of the\nshelf, as the books are small ones.\nCorrohorative Statement by Miss Newton.\nMr. Irving asked me to look through the book \" Chippinge\n\"\nwith a view to verifying the allusion to \" Baronets, Titles, but\nparticularly Baronets.\" Examined with this in mind, the book\ndoes seem to be unusually full of titles ; I quickly counted twenty,\nas I turned the pages, and on page 28 I noticed that somebody's\n\" first sitting had been graced by the presence of three royal\ndukes . . . and a score of peers.\"\nThere are about eight baronets in my list, including Sir Robert\nVermuyden, who is a conspicuous person in the story, closely\nassociated with the hero.\nI. Newton.\n7. The sixth book from the left hand end of this shelf was\n\" The Three Musketeers,\" by Dumas. I found nothing on page\n18, but on page 19 (which touches page 18 when the book is\nclosed) I found :\nhe soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon\nwas pointed and well-sharpened, and that at each of these\nscratches not only the spectators, but even the actors them-\nselves, laughed like so many mad men.\nThis description at once reminded me of a picture I have at\nhome, hanging in the spare bedroom, which illustrates the sentence\n\" He that will this toast deny, down among the dead men let him\nlie.\" A Puritan stands beneath a picture of King Charles I.\nholding a wine-glass reluctantly in his hand. On each side of\nhim stands a Cavalier with rapier in right hand and wine-glass in\nleft, threatening to run him through if he will not drink to the\ntoast. The Cavalier on the right has perhaps already gone beyond\nthreatening, as the Puritan has caught hold of the blade with his\nhand. To the left are three more Cavaliers with swords raised\n\fJanuaey, 1927 Gases 11\nhigh in right hand, and wine-glasses in left, apparently chanting a\nsong ; a fourth, on a table, covers the Puritan with a gun. To\nmy wife King Charles I. was a hero and a martyr. We bought\nthis little picture together over twenty-six years ago, and it was\none that we framed ourselves.\nCorroborative Statement by Miss Newton.\nI have verified the passage quoted from \" The Three Muske-\nteers,\" p. 19, Following it is a further description :\nA circle was formed round them, the conditions required\nthat at every thrust the person hit should quit the game,\nlosing his turn to the advantage of the person who had hit\nhim. In five minutes three were slightly wounded. . . .\nWith regard to its being a book that \" deals with several\nperiods of history,\" the Preface is concerned with the periods of\nLouis XIII. and XIV. (the word period is many times mentioned).\nThere is also the period of the author himself. That is all.\nI. Newton.\nMr. Irving sent the picture in question to the Society's\nRooms, and we have in our possession a photograph of it\nwhich establishes the accuracy of his description. It wiU be\nnoted that the date of the period covered by the reign of\nLouis XIII. and the early part of the reign of Louis XIV., that\nis, the latter half of the seventeenth century, corresponds\napproximately to the date of the scene illustrated by Mr.\nIrving's picture and the costumes worn by the Cavaliers are\nin general type such as one associates with Dumas's Three\nMusketeers.\nMr. Irving also sent to the Society the two red note-books\ndiscussed in Note 3, and the accuracy of his statements have\nbeen verified.\nA statement from Mr. Y. is appended to the record of the\nsitting to the effect that the test was verified in his presence\nand that Mr. Irving's account of it is correct.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1927\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning an Hallucination of a Cat.\n\\In (jiving permission for the following Statement to he printed in\nthe Journal, Dr. W. F. Prince asks us to say that it was made\ninformally in a personal letter to the Editor, Mrs. Salter.]\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.E.\nJune 18, 1926.\nDear Madam,\u2014Referring to pages 66-71 of your last Journal\n[Vol. XXIII. ,\nMay 1926] relating to an evidential hallucination of\na cat, with reference to a similar case in an earlier Journal, I\nmay say that another and very interesting case of the sort is to\nbe found in the American Proceedings for 1920, pages 294-308.\nThese were the experiences of members of a family with which I\nhave been in touch for many years. I took pains to collect the'\nevidence, but it is of more importance that this evidence was\nstudied by the son of one of the witnesses, who was at the same\ntime the brother of a second and father of the third. He is a\nman of sceptical bent though interested and openminded, and as\nunbiased from family considerations as anyone whom I know.\nIn this case a white cat, which did not exist in the flesh, was\nseen many times over a period of 13 years. On several\noccasions the hallucination was experienced by two persons at the\nsame time, one of whom called attention to it after it had been\nplainly perceived by the other. As in the case recently reported,\nthe cat was on one or two occasions apparently felt as well as\nseen. And, according to the testimony, every such appearance of\nthe \" white kitten \" was shortly followed, either by the death of\na person related or the beginning of the fatal illness. My critical\nfriend has not undertaken to decide whether there is or is not\nany significance in these coincidences, but he does declare that\nthe coincidences existed.\nA curious feature of the case to which I referred, that of the\nYoung family, is that years before the first hallucination of a\n\" white kitten \" such a kitten was owned by one of the afterward\nwitnesses, and mysteriously disappeared, with a consequent rather\npoignant effect upon the emotions of this witness. If it could be\nsupposed that in some unknown fashion there could come into her\nmind premonitions of the death of relatives, it might be that by\n\fJan'uarv, 1927 Correspondence 13\nsome obscure mechanism, the subconscious would call up the\nimage of the cat that had disappeared and probably died. But\none of the witnesses was of a younger generation and had nO'\nrecollection of the historical cat, and consequently no feelings-\nwhatever about it.\nI suppose that a resolute specialist in the manipulation of the\ntheory of telepathy could explain the whole problem. It only\nneeds that we suppose\n(1) That witness A was telepathically apprised of some morbid\ncondition on the part of each person, successively, who\ndied, with such accuracy that the impression never related\nto a mere illness but always to a fatal one.\n(2) That this telepathic impression, by a subconscious me-\nchanism, called up the memory of the mysteriously-\ndisappeared kitten.\n(3) That this memory objectified itself as the apparition of that\nkitten.\n(4) That by auto-suggestion the apparition was once reinforced\nby the illusion of actually feeling the cat.\n(5) And that on several occasions, the hallucination of the cat,\nin the exact location it seemed to A to occupy was\npassed over to witness B or witness C by telepathy.\nAs easy as that, and yet it may all be the veriest \" bunk !\n\"\nWalter Franklin Prince.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe first part of the second volume of the Zeitschrifi fiir kritischen\nOkhuUismus is of such high quality that the journal promises to be\nthe leading European periodical in psychical research. Dr.\nAuerbach has a paper upon the work of an alleged clairvoyant,,\nMr. S., in which he fails to come to any decision as to the true\nnature of the phenomena presented. Count Klinckowstroem pub-\nlishes a comment on certain statements included in the Sieben-\nmannerbuch.\" and Dr. Rosenbusch has a crushing reply to the\nattacks made upon him in the same volume. The issue closes\nwith an \" open \" letter to Mr. Dingwall upon a technical point\nrecently discussed, and a lively controversy between. Count\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research januaky, 1927\nKlinckowstroem and Baron von Sckrenck-Notzing upon the manage-\nment of mediums.\nThe Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for November has a con-\ntinuation of Mr. Krall's account of . his experiments with the\nthought-reader, Ninoii ; and Mr. Okolowicz of Warsaw has an\naccount of the travel paintings of the medium, Marjan Gruzewski.\nIn the October issue of Revalo Bund, Dr. Mattiesen publishes\nan interesting survey of the recorded case of alleged shakings of\ndwellings in which seances are taking place. Another phenomenon\nwhich the author considers in the same article is the stopping\nof clocks produced by purported psychic agencies. The issue for\nNovember has a long discussion of points arising from a con-\nsideration of the results obtained by Mr. Soal and Mrs. Cooper.\nThe issues of Nature from July 31 have had a correspondence\non Science and Psychical Research. The controversy was opened\nby a review of Sir Conan Doyle's History of Spiritualism, by the\nNew Zealand entomologist. Dr. R. J. Tillyard. In the issue of\nAugust 28 the controversy was continued, and in that for Sep-\ntember 11 criticisms appeared from the pens of Mr. Campbell\nSwinton and Dr. J. P. Lotsy, who inquired if Dr. Tillyard would\nnot refuse to investigate reputed cases of insects with bony\nskeletons suckling their young. Mr. Campbell Swinton continued\nthe attack in the issue for September 25, in which he was joined\nby Sir Bryan Donkin the following week. On October 16 Mr.\nSwinton again entered the arena with a lively discussion con-\ncerning the position of certain psychical researchers, and on\nOctober 23 Dr. Tillyard replied to certain of his critics in such a\nmanner that a clear picture is obtained of his present attitude\ntowards the matter in dispute. \" It is not the number of seances\nthat a man attends, but his capacity to draw definite conclusions\n\"\nis, he says, what \" really matters.\" In five sittings with three\ndifferent mediums, Dr. Tillyard declares that he has had \" definite\nsupernormal results,\" and that these were under \" strict test\nconditions.\"\nSir Oliver Lodge continued the discussion on October 30 with\na consideration of the hypotheses which may be employed on the\nassumption that the phenomena investigated by psychical re-\nsearchers \" are real in the sense that when understood they will\nlead to an extension of natural knowledge.\"\nOn November 20, in an admirable editorial summing up, the\n\fJantjaet, 1927 Notbi- iW Feriodieals 15\nauthor called attention to the dubious history of spiritualism even\nwhere the subject matter had been investigated by scientiiic\nbodies. Thus the alleged phenomena of spiritualism can be com-\npared with the mysterious \" N Rays,\" which were the subject of\nfifty scientific papers and led to their discoverer being awarded a\nsubstantial prize by the Paris Academy of Sciences. In the con-\ncluding remarks the writer of the article shows an acute apprecia-\ntion of the theories devised by the supporter of the reality of\n\" spirit photography \" and the \" direct voice.\" \" When the\ncontrol becomes rigid,\" we read, \" the phenomena cease alto-\ngether. That is the general rule, and it admits of only one\ninterpretation \"\n(p. 722). In spite, however, of the failures and\ndiscouragements, the author considers it \" highly desirable that a\ncompetent body should exist for making out a prima facie case\nin favour of any alleged new phenomena of the class we are\ndiscussing. Such a body we have in the Society for Psychical\nResearch. . .\n.\"\nThe Sunday Chronicle (October 17, 1926) has been giving an\naccount of their enquiry into the phenomena of spiritualism. A\ncommittee had been formed and the sittings of various mediums\nattended. Among those visited were Mr. Evan Powell, Mr.\nHarold Evans, Mrs. A. B. Deane, the Misses Moore, Mrs. Blanche\nCooper, etc. The findings of the committee have not been\nfavourable to the claims of the mediums, and on one occasion the\nlight was turned up upon Mr. Harold Evans revealing the latter\ndraped in a white overall posing as the materialised spirit,\n\" Sister Catherine.\" This incident seemed to convince a few\nprominent spiritualists that Mr. Evans is not always reliable,\nalthough at a seance held on November 8 under the auspices of\nthe Chiswick Christian Spiritualist Church, Mr. Evans' performance\nwas stated to produce \" undeniable evidence of materialisation and\nphysical phenomena \" {West London Observer, November 9, 1926).\nSimilarly Mr. Munnings (see Journal S.P.R., 1926, XXIII.\npp. 73 sq.) has again started his performances, for on November 14\nhe conducted another of his experiments in \" broadcasting spirit\nvoices \" at the Southend Kursaal. As at the previous exhibition\n(lb. p. 74) no names were announced, but it is understood that\nthe medium Munnings \" following a period of retirement, has re-\nturned to public work again \" (Thameside Mail Nov. 20, 1926).\n\f16 Jourim.l,of: Society^ -for Psychical Research January, 1927\nREVIEW.\nThe Divining Rod. By Sir William Barrett, F.R.S., and\nTheodore Besterman. Methuen (18s. net), pp. 336.\nDowsing was a subject of which Sir William Barrett had made\na life-long study, and everyone interested in this curious by-path\nof knowledge must be glad that in the latter part of his life he\nfound so able a co-adjutor as Mr. Besterman. The j)resent volume\nis a worthy monument of their joint labours.\nThe history of dowsing is peculiar. Quite unknown in classical\nantiquity and, apparently, in the early Middle Ages, and not much\nin use among primitive peoples at any time, it suddenly becomes\na subject of frequent reference in 15th century Germany, whence it\nseems to have been introduced into France, England, and other lands.\nWhile at first mainly employed for the discovery of metals (with\nthe detection of corpses and criminals as a side-line), its principal\nuse at the present day is for the discovery of subterranean water\nsupplies. For this purpose it has been often successfully resorted\nto in recent years by large landowners after the efforts of trained\ngeologists had failed. Several instances of this, well documented\nand illustrated by plans, are quoted in the book.\nIt might be thought that the causes of a phenomenon so wide-\nspread and so readily capable of being subjected to experiment^\nwould by now have been placed beyond doubt ; and there is no\ndearth of hypothetical explanations, including diabolical agency, elec-\ntricity and (abhorred word !)\n\" cryptaesthesia.\" Our authors incline\nto the last, but he would be a bold man who would assert that any\nof the rival hypotheses has been satisfactorily proved or disproved.\nIt is in fact on the theoretic side that the book is weak. In\nparticular the recent German investigations summarised by Count\nCarl V. Klinckowstroem in S.P.R. Journal for 1925, pp. 54-60, de-\nserve more consideration than the brief and not altogether accurate\nreferences made to them under the heading \" Obsolete Theories.\"\nThe historic side, on the other hand, deserves nothing but\npraise, whether our authors deal with the earlier period before\northodox science had come on the scene, or with our own time\nwhen the dowser has to hold his own with the geological expert.\nFor both periods the book is profusely illustrated, and some of\nthe early prints are most entertaining. In conclusion, not the\nleast of the book's many merits are the admirably full biblio-\ngraphy and index. W. H. S.\n\fNo. 432.\u2014Vol. XXIV.

Lea>:ixg.\nSince our last note on this subject in the Jodrnal for\nDecember, 1925, only a few cases have come to our notice,\nbut two general observations arise out of them. The Rev.\nH. Byerley Thomson remarks that he had never heard of the\nvisions, and had no experience of them until about two\nyears ago, when he was surprised and puzzled by their occur-\nrence. Yet he sees in the crystal and has had psychic ex-\nperiences from the age of fifteen. His account was sent us\nin June, 1926. In August a letter appeared in Nature (Aug.\n7th) from Dr. J. H. Kenneth referring to that of M. Gheury\nde Bray (of March 17th, 1923) and describing the faintly\ncoloured landscape images (one of them recognised and there-\nfore a memory-image) seen on waking. This drew forth a\nfurther letter from M. de Bray {Nature, Sept. 11th, 1926),\nand hence three other correspondents favoured us with de-\nscriptions. One of these. Miss Kennaway, also refers to the\nscanty information on the subject. As far as any reasoned\nand studious discussions of these phenomena are concerned, it\nis scanty, but since I have given attention to it I have been\nstruck with the frequency with which the experience itself is\nmet with in our literature. Just as Maury noticed in his\npatients at the Salpetriere how marked a period the oncoming\nof sleep was for the development of certain symptoms, so one\nfinds repeatedly that the hypnagogic condition (though not\nunder its technical name as a rule) is mentioned in connection\nwith visions of the specific type under consideration.\nMy second point is that in spite of the similarity that\nbinds all these descriptions into the one class of liaUucinations\nliypnagogiques, it is particularly unsafe to generalize on any\nparticular feature of them. Mr. George E. Browne, a reader\nof Nature who wrote to draw my attention to the letters\nreferred to, almost simultaneously with those received through\nM. Gheury de Bray, finds himself diifering as widely as\npossible from the bulk of hypnagogists, in that he is most\nbrilliantly awake and finds his visions so intensely interesting\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research fkbruarv, v.)-2t\nthat he has to stop them in order to get to sleep at all.\nOther points, such as the degree of illumination and colour,\nthe speed, the character, and so on,' will be found to be\nabsolutely opjjosed in the experience of different individuals,\neven in this small group of half-a-dozen persons. This seems\nto illustrate the fact that the mechanisms of the unconscious-\nare too intricate, or too much veiled by idiosyncrasy, to be\ndefinitely laid down yet. The only things that come out\nbeyond dispute are that the subconscious does use memory-\nimages, as the conscious mind itself does (and must), that it\nrecombines various elements so as to make unrecognised re-\nsults, as some peojjle also consciously do when \" imagining,\n'\nor writing fiction, designing, etc., and that it can help itself\nto ideas in neighbouring minds and produce much more\nmarvellous effects in many ways than are possible to the\nconscious mind voluntarily using its normal powers.\nWith these preliminary remarks I now give the descriptions,\nreceived, summarized where required by conditions of space.\nI. From the Ri'c. H. Byerley Thomson.\nHealth : nornial, nothing to account for the appearances.\nSize : of a postage stamp, external, about a few feet away,\ndetails visible and well-defined. Colour ; never brilliant, always\nlow in tone. \" They have the appearance and characteristics of.\nphotographs more than of pictures \" [Cp. S.P.R. Proceedings, vol..\nXXXV. p. 338]. Duration : a few seconds. Subjects : Faces,\nmen, rarely women ;\nhead and neck. Two types, dark bearded\nOriental, clean-shaven European ;\nmiddle-aged, hard and severe,,\nno movement, smile, etc. Women more varied, well-defined,.\n\" of a soulful expression.\" With one exception all of strangers \u2022\nemphatically not produced by memory.\nThis gentleman tells me that he was originally trained as a\ncivil engineer, but is naturally clairvoyant and mediumistic.\nWhen psychometrising he sees the visions as larger and clearer\nthan in the crystal ;\nand cau see them at any time on closing\nhis eyes.\nII. Mr. H. R. Cah-ert {through M. Gheury de Bray).\n\" My images are all '\ncinematographic '\nand not panoramic.\"'\nHe gives an instance of seeing on waking (but with eyes still\n\fPebrlahv, 1927 Hypnagogic Phenomena 21\nclosed) while his brother, who was already dressing, had just\nreminded him of the time, a group of students like those in a\nteam photograph seen the previous evening. In it . his brother\n\"was included, but in shirt-sleeves, without a collar, etc. This\nwas evidently a combination of a memory-image with a modifica-\ntion from immediate consciousness, and as such is unusual. He\nadds, \" The whole thing could not have taken much more than a\nminute. I am not quite certain whether I thought that what I\ni\\-as observing was the actual group of boys or whether I thought\nthat it was a photograph, but if the latter I do not remember\nnoticing the white mount. In any case . . . the whole picture\nwas perfectly stiU, and I was in a wakeful condition.\"\nIII. From Miss M. Kennaivay (through M. Gheury de Bray).\n\" These images appear for no apparent reason. Some are ab-\nsolutely steady and do not alter at all but simply fade ; others\ndissolve from one scene to another, these often containing figures\nwhich move about, usually in a dim light -so that I am not\ncertain on what they are engaged. These figures as a rule\nappear to belong to a bygone age.\n\" Scenery is nearly always unnaturally distinct, with the hard\nclearness of a cold day after rain. Sometimes, though, it is not\nso, and dark trees against a sunset sky, sheep coming down a\nlane towards me with light on their backs, or beautiful snow effects,\namong other scenes, have been true to nature in every way.\nOther pictures are in a strange dim light, neither sunshine nor\ntrue daylight.\nThey all come usually on first waking. The scenes are some-\ntimes quite small as though looked at through a diminishing glass,\nand with the clear briUiance seen through a camera lens.\n\" Faces also are very distinct, in a curious half light as a rule,\nand following each other sometimes in rapid succession. Wonder-\nful patterns appear occasionally in neutral or dim colours, so\nintricate that gTeat skill would be required to draw them and far\ntoo complicated for any but a general remembrance.\"\nIV. M. Gheury de Bray.\nWriting in Nature of September 11th, 1926, on \" Spatial and\nTime Relations in Dreams,\" M. de Bray describes the emergence\nof a perfectly steady memory-image of a mountain side seen two\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Fkbkuaet, 1927\nSet 3 (Nov. 14th) gave \" a vast curved shore of a lake or bay,\nseen through the loggia or forecourt of a Roman villa. The far\ndistance was a mile or more and the intervening water faint\nmother-of-pearl with tiny ripples coming in. There were a\nnumber of ornamental bronze stands on stone bases, and of very\nelegant design, all round the edge.\nSet 4, Night scene. Broad river intensely black, chateau on\nright, and small ill-defined building in far distance. Observer\napparently standing on bridge in foreground.

Against an all but black back-\nground could dimly be discerned the one figure it contained ; like\nsmoke it formed, faded, formed again, and again disappeared for\ngood.\nCONCERNING THE \"MARGERY\" CASE.\nEditorial Note.\nIn Part 101 of Proceedings, pp. 414-432, there appeared a letter\nfrom the Hon. Everard Feilding embodying certain observations\nby Mr. Hoagland and Mr. Code on Mr. Feilding's review of\nMr. Hoagland's article in the Atlantic Monthly for November, 1925.\nFrom Mr. Feilding's review and those replies it is abundantly\nclear that the whole question regarding the genuineness of the\n\" Margery \" mediumship has become involved in a tangle of\nallegations and denials on plain matters of fact, and of imputa-\ntions and insinuations against the veracity of the principal per-\nsons concerned, which it would be hopeless for any one not\nhaving personal knowledge of the disputants to attempt to unravel.\n\frKliliUARY, 1027 Concerning tJie '\nIlargery\" Case 25\nAccordingly, while feeling bound to aUow our reviewer, Mr.\nPeilding, to correct certain points in his review, we appended an\nEditorial note saying that no further correspondence would l^e\npublished.\nOur desire is to have as little as possible to do either in Pro-\nceedings or in the Journal with the whole \" Margery \" question\nunless and until it is disentangled from the charges and counter-\ncharges surrounding it, since, until this has been done, it is not\npossible (in this country at any rate) to make any advance in\ndiscussing the matter in the only aspect which is of interest to\nPsychical Research.\nWe print here, however, a letter from Dr. W. F. Prince, as it\nis confined to answering points already raised in a previous\nJo urnal.\nDr. Peince'^s Letter.\nDecember IQUk 1926.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014On page 157 of the November Journal, referring\nto my review of the documentary evidence on the Margery Case,\nthe following sentence occurs : '\"An attack is also made upon\nthe various publications in favour of the medium, and extracts\nare selected in order to show the various '\nchanges,' '\nomissions\n'\nand '\nsubtractions That statement is misleading : the changes,\nomissions and subtractions were charged against one publication,\nnamely the one bearing the names of Dr. Crandon and others,\nentitled \" Margery-Harvard-Veritas,\" which declared that it con-\ntained the Harvard sitting-notes \" absolutely as written and\nsigned.\" No answer to my charges has ever been printed, nor\nwas one possible. I even saw the copy of the sitting-notes sent\nto the printer, with many passages cancelled by pen.\nOn the same page of your Journal it is asked why the Scientific\nAmerican Committee accepted unfavourable conditions. I have\nrepeatedly endeavoured to make the writer of the criticism under-\nstand that this Committee was not an independent body, but\nleally a jury of the magazine, to give verdicts on cases brought\nbefore it. I took part in the investigation of several previous\ncases, wherein the apparatus was furnished and the other arrange-\nments made ahnost entirely by the staff of the Scientific American.\nLater, in the Margery Case, certain members of the Committee\n\f26 Jounml of Society for Psychical Research February, 1927\nstepped out of their j^arts to a certain extent, but as long as\nMr. Bird was Secretary to the Committee and \" general stage\nmanager \" (his own term) no one of the Committee had a right\nto say him nay. Soon after Mr. Bird ceased to be Secretary,\nopportunities for further sittings were denied the Committee.\nEvery innuendo, in the item on your page 157, directed against\nthe Committee, falls upon that member of the Scientific American\nstaff who acted as \" executive officer,\"' kept the records, and\narranged matters so that for weeks one member of the Com-\nmittee did not even know that experiments were being conducted.\nAs to the number of times the \"hnk\"' was controlled, that appears\nto those most familiar with the situation a matter of little con-\nsequence, for reasons which did not appear until late in the\nseries.\nWalter Franklin Prince.\nAN EAELY RECORD OF A POLTERGEIST CASE\nThe following extract from The Political State of Great\nBritain, February, 1738, p. 165, has been sent to us by Father\nHerbert Thurston, S.J.\nLetters from Bristol of the 7th of January (1738) brought as\nthe following very odd particulars which will serve to put people\non their guard with respect to accidents which at first sight seem\nto have something in them supernatural.\nFrom Portishead we have a very odd account of the inhabitants\nin general there having been for several weeks past under a\nconsternation of witchcraft, notwithstanding the incongruity of\nsuch sorcery being yet surviving in G-reat Britain. An outcry\nwas daily made of this prodigy by droves of people who visited\nthe house where the witchcraft was reported to be in full power,\nwhich belonged to one Flower, an old tailor, noted for nursing\nparish children for 18d. per week. This old man and his old\nwife have severely felt the effect of it, for at every instant one\nor the other had a bang on the head, or some other part of the\nbody, with large stones, spoons, knives, etc., and divers people\nwho visited the house for their satisfaction and truth of the\nmatter, met with the same reception, and saw the windows broke,\nbut knew not by what means, and such was the fear of many\n\fFebruary, 1927 An Early Record of a Poltergeist Case 27\nthat they thought it dangerous to enter the house ; and the twO'\nold people, in order to drive the dilemma from them, were\nconstantly at prayer by the advice of the good people. At\nlength a gentlewoman of this city (Bristol) who happened to be\nat a gentleman's seat, hearing of this, reported by the family\nwhere she then resided, and putting no faith in such chimeras,\nresolved like the rest to visit the bewitched house and saw several\nthings flung about, but imperceivable from whence ; and repeating\nher visit, at length began to look with a suspicious eye upon a\nlittle girl of about twelve years old, grand-daughter to the old\npeople, who, she always perceived, placed herself in a window\nbehind whatever persons came into the room, and she receiving\na blow on the arm with a spoon, conjectured it must come from\nthe girl, and therefore immediately searched her, and to her\nsurprise found two pockets full of large pebble stones, etc., under\nher petticoats, which she artfully flung at convenient opportunities,\nand carried on this subtilty so far as to occasion much wonder\nthat a little witch so young could manage her scheme so well\nto deceive a whole parish ; for beside this she had a knack in\nchanging her voice to several topes. The gentlewoman had the\nthanks of the whole parish for laying this young witch.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe October issue of the Journal of the American Society for\nPsychical Research has a paper by Mr. Rene Sudre in defence of\nCrawford. Mr. Sudre is of the opinion that the Goligher phenomena\nwere authentic, and that their investigator's findings are of capital,\nimportance. He does not attempt to meet the objections raised\nby the English inquirers and also by Dr. Rosenbusch in the\n\" Dreimannerbuch,\" neither does he comment upon the remarkable'\ndiscrepancies between Crawford's theories and the photographs^\nwhich are supposed to prove the correctness of those ideas.\nThe same number has an account of a sitting with Frau Silbert\nby Baron Winterstein, who describes the usual manifestations\noccurring with this medium. The November issue of the same\nJournal has a detailed account of a sitting with Margery, ap-\nparently conducted by Professor McComas (Princeton) and Pro-\nfessor Overstreet (New York). Attempts were made to meet\n\f2S Journal of Society for Psychical Research February, 1!J27\ncertain objections raised against tlie control when the glass cabinet\nwas in use, and fifty large-headed luminous pins were placed\non Margery's arms, wrists, ankles, head and knees. Whilst Prof.\nOverstreet had his hand over the medium's mouth, Walter both\nAvhistled and spoke, and certain luminous objects remained floating\nwithin the cabinet in front of the medium. The bell-box was\nalso em|)!oyed, and when Prof. Overstreet carried it about, with-\ndrawing nine feet from the medium, the bell continued to ring\nintermittently. These phenomena, the report states, took place\nin red light, beginning and ending in the same period of red\n.light (p. 682).\nBuUeiiii IV. of the Boston Society for Psychic Research consists\nof a very suggestive report by Mrs. Sagendorph of certain ex-\nperiences of her own which formed the basis of some experi-\nments with mediums. The narrative is clearly written ; the notes\nare full and provide a running commentary to the text ; and the\nstory provides a neat little episode in the history of mental\nmediumship. It is a pity that more notes were not taken at\nthe beginning, but this can easily be understood when it is\nremembered that the characters in the incident were not aware of\n\"the developments which subsequently ensued.\nPsyche for October has a spirited discussion between rival\nanthropological experts on the claims of the \" diffusionists,\" whilst\nProf. McDougall contributes a long paper on the \" Margery Medium-\n.ship\n\"\"\nin which he reviews the history of the case, with special\nreference to his own methods in its investigation. The paper\ncontains a number of novel features and should be read by all\nthose who wish to become acquainted with the personalities of\nthis famous controversy. The author is of the opinion that,\nshould Margery's claims be substantiated, she is \" jjerhaps\nthe most remarkable medium of all time \"\n(p. 1-5). In con-\nsidering the positions of the various opposing parties in the case,\nProf. McDougall divides them into two opposing camps, the\nPros and the Cons. Amongst the Cons he cites Dr. Prince,\nMr. Hoagland, Dr. Corastock and himself. As regards his own\nobservations, Prof. McDougall states that he has taken part\n\"in a considerable number of investigations of alleged super-\nnormal phenomena \" ; but hitherto he has \" failed to find\nconvincing evidence in any case.\" Prof. McDougall then con-\ntinues to examine the Margery case, and in an acute analysis of\n\fFkbruart, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 29-\nthe alleged teleplastic plieuomena contrasts the appearance of the\n'\u2022\ntelepksm \" when lying on the table and its alleged activities\nwhen invisible and under a good light. This difficulty is one-\nwhich has never been squarely faced, and it is present not only\nin the case of Margery. Thus the fragile nature of Eva C\"s\n\"teleplasm\" can be compared with the alleged formations re-\nsponsible for the supposed telekinetic phenomena of the Brothers .\nSchneider. The apparent inconsistency may be due to our own\nignorance, or it may on the other hand be due to the fact that\nthe whole theory of \"teleplasm\"\" is in reality based upon a\ngigantic imposition. At all events, Prof. McDougall has done good\nwork in exposing its presence in the case of the Boston medium.\nThe Zeitsclmft fur Po.rajpsychologie for December, 1926, has a\ncontinuation of Mr. Krall's discussion of thought-transference in\nmen and animals. He continues his account of the experiments\nwith the Brazilian telepathist, Ninoff. Professor H. J. Klem\nsupplements the discussion with a brief paper on the same medium,\nin which he comes to the conclusion that there is no reasonable\ndoubt of the reality of Ninoffs powers ;\nwhilst Mr. Yaldek and\nMr. Mery give their views concerning the phenomena. Mr..\nKinoff's exhibition appears to be somewhat as follows. He stands\nin a circle of about a dozen persons, all of whom are entire\nstrangers to him. His eyes are bandaged with a napkin and the\nbandage is supplemented by a roUed-up glove which is laid over\nhis eyes. He then asks one of the company to think of an.\nobject which he is to remove from the thinker's pocket. Upoa\na member of the audience obliging, Ninofi approaches^ him and\nproceeds to rummage through his pockets. We will assume that\nthe object thought of was a pocket-book. Xinofi produces it,\nand then asks for- certain of the contents of the pocket-book to\nbe thought of.

He\nsuggests that the \"communicator\" could and should have been\ncalled as a witness i While the circumstances in this particular\ncase were peculiar, the general c|uestion as to the copyright not\nonly of automatic writings, but of the trance utterances of mediums,\nrequires careful consideration by Psychical researchers.\nCORRESPOOT)ENCE.\nTHE OBJECTS OF THE SOCIETY.\nDeceiither, 1926.\nTo iJic Editor of tlie Journal of the S.P.R..\nDear Madam,\u2014Recent correspondence on Psychical Research in\nNature and a leading article in the number for November 20th,\n1926, winding up the discussion, afford perhaps a good occasion\nfor reminding members of our Society what the Society stands\nfor and what the objects of its principal founders were. The\narticle referred to. which is on the whole friendly to the Society,\nthough not perhaps very well informed, states that \" The S.P.R.\nfounders were largely the Fabians of Spiritualism. Their object\nwas to sift the physical and mental j^h^non^ena of Spiritualism\nand to sort out those to which they could give their adherence\nwithout a loss of self-respect or scientific standing.\" Now as\nmyself one of the founders and intimately connected with them,\n\fFEBRnAEi-, 1927 Correspondence 31\nI can say emphatically that this was not their object. They did\nnot desire to find among the evidence presented to them what\nthey could profess to believe without sacrificing their reputation.\nThey were not so unscientific, nor, I may add, so unscruxmlous.\nTheir hope in founding the Society was to further investigations\nin which they had already been engaged, and, with a view to\nincreasing our knowledge of facts, to get in touch with as many\nother people interested in the subjects in question as possible,\nespecially with those who had themselves had experiences bearing\non them.\nOn the whole we have, I think, been fairly successful in this.\nBut quite lately there has seemed to be a difficulty : fewer accounts\nof experiences have, I believe, been sent to us. This may be\ndue to a recurring, but very erroneous, idea that we have had\n\u2022enough. But it may be partly due to a difierent cause of which\nI have heard rumour.s\u2014rumours which are really the reason for\nmy writing this letter. I am told that there are members of\nthe Society who think that those who manage it are unduly\nselective in what they publish in Proceedings, pu.bhshing only\n-what accords with their preconceived theories, or what tends in\nthe direction of their own desires. This would be almost as bad\nas the principle of selection of which Nature accuses the founders\n\u2022of the Society and would be altogether wrong for a scientific\nsocietv. Of course it would be quite permissible for a society\n\u2022existing with the object of encouraging among its members and\nspreading abroad a particular belief, but the object of our Society\nis simply to try to find out the truth, and we are bound to\npublish what seems good evidence either in favour of the truth\nof certain theories or of certain alleged facts, or, on the other\nhand, against them. Only the evidence must be good, or at\nleast as good as our researches can make it. Those who have\nalready made up their minds that all is known that can be\nknown, whether negatively or positively, about the subjects our\nSocietv exists to investigate, naturally will not be interested in\nour Proceedings. Neither those determined to doubt nor those\ndetermined to believe will care for evidence which might\ndisturb them in their point of view. We publish for those\n-who reahse that much evidence is still recjuired, that a com-\nparative study of well evidenced phenomena is much needed, and\nthat hardly anything is yet known of the way telepathy, for\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February, 1927\"\ninstance, works. We are still groping about in the dark about\nthis and other things.\nBut our critics will j^erhaps say that what they complain of\nis not intentional selection, but a difference of judgment about\nwhat is good evidence. That, I fear, may be more or less in-\nevitable, but I would urge critics to call the attention of our-\nofficers to any case which they think has been improperly over-\nlooked. Discussion may reduce differences of view and is at\nany rate better than attributions of unworthy motives on entirely^\nconjectural grounds.\nIn conclusion, I would beg for patience. Considering the ex-\ntreme difficulty of our subjects, the few people who can produce\nthe evidence we wish to investigate, and the comparatively small!\nnumber of investigators, I cannot think our progress has been\nso very slow, nor do I think it likely to be rapid in the\nimmediate future, or that we can hope constantly to have for-\npublication papers of a sensational kind. That the whole inves-\ntigation is of the most important nature possible I. however, feel as-\nstrongly as I have always done.\nI am. Madam,\nYours faithfully,\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nREVIEW.\nOhlcultismus uud Wissenschaft nnter hesotulerer Berucksichtiyuny der\nTelehinese uud der ninferialisafionen.

Schiller, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick,\nMr. W. S. Montgomery Smith, and Mr. Warren J. Vinton.\nThe Chairman presented the Report of the Council. Mr.\nW. H. Salter read the Report to the Meeting, and dis-\ncussion was invited.\nIn rej)ly to questions as to the proportion of the Society's\nincome devoted specifically to research, and to the Library,\nthe Hon. Treasurer said it would be most misleading to take\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech, 1927\nthe sum appearing in the Annual Accounts under the heading\n\" Research and Travelling Expenses \" as being any gauge of\nthe extent of the Society's research work. In the first place,\nmuch of the most important research work was done voluntarily\nby members and did not cost the Society a penny, except\nfor printing the results. Further, both the Secretary and the\nAssistant Secretary, in addition to their ordinary administrative-\nwork, spent considerable time on what is definitely research\nwork, and the salary of the Research Officer was paid out of\na separate fund, and so did not figure on the General Accounts.\nOwing to the generosity of various members, finance had\nnot for some few years past been, and was not now, in any\nway a limiting factor in research. As regards physical\nphenomena, the difficulty was to find subjects worth investi-\ngating and willing to be investigated under suitable conditions.\nAs to the Library, it should be remembered that the Society\nreceived most of the current literature of any importance\neither by gift or in exchange from other Societies. The\nCouncil were however carefully considering whether any im-\nprovements could be effected in the Library and the Library\nCatalogue.\nThe Hon. Treasurer, presenting the Financial Statement,,\nsaid that the Society started the year with a balance in hand\nof \u00a3703 8s. 4d. and ended with a balance of \u00a3425 7s. 8d.\nOf this balance \u00a3177 17s. 9d. belonged definitely to Research,\nbeing the balance of Special Research Donations ; and \u00a3150\nwas on deposit (\u00a3100 being placed to the Dilapidations Fund,,\nand a legacy of \u00a350 was awaiting investment). The actual\nbalance was therefore \u00a3110 3s. 5d. On the other hand,\nupwards of \u00a3400 had been invested. It had already been\nmentioned that a member who died recently had very generously\nleft to the Society a legacy of \u00a3200 free of duty, but this had\nnot yet been received. He felt that he ought to add that\nthe Council were always much touched when members remem-\nbered the Society in a way which would help to enable ife\nto carry on its work in the future.\nThe Chairman announced that the six retiring Members of\nCouncil offered themselves for re-election. No other nomina-\ntions having been received, the following were declared to be\n\fMarch, 1927 Annual Report of the Council for 1926 37\ndvily elected Members of the Council : The Rt. Hon. G. W.\nBalfour, Mr. E. N. Bennett, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., Sir\nOliver Lodge, Professor W. M'Dougall, and Dr. V. J. Woolley.\nAl^NUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1926\nThe Society has had the honour, during the year 1926, of\nhaving Prof. Dr. Hans Driesch of Leipzig as its President, and\nwe are glad to be able to announce that he has consented to\nallow himself to be nominated for re-election for a second\nyear. We cannot, of course, expect from him a second\npresidential address, but hope that he may visit us, and per-\nhaps have something to say to us on his way home from\nthe United States in March.\nIn no country has greater scientific interest been shown in\nPsychical Research of recent years than in Grermany, and we\nfeel confident that Dr. Driesch's two years of presidency will\ncontribute to closer co-operation between ourselves and German\ninvestigators in the same fields.\nThe Council observe with gratification signs of increased\ninterest in the Society's work among persons who have not\nthemselves taken active part in it, but approach the subject\nthrouo-h research in other scientific fields, such as Natural\nScience or orthodox Psychology. We may instance the recent\ndiscussion of physical phenomena in Nature which closed with\nthe Editorial comment that it is \" highly desirable that a\ncompetent body should exist for making out a prima facie\ncase in favour of any alleged new phenomena of the class we\nare discussing. Such a body we have in the Society for\nPsychical Research\n;\n\" and also Dr. Broad's comments in his\nbook The Mind and its Place in Nature, reviewed in our Journal,\nDecember, 1925. Our members may also remember the series\nof articles on \" Spiritualism and the Church,\" published in\nthe Morning Post in March and early April, in which Dr.\nPercy Dearmer expressed high appreciation of the Society's\nwork and critical methods. In this connexion we may also\nmention that for the first time an Academic Institution has\nseriously discussed the case for and against Psychical Research.\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research biarch, 1927\nA special course of lectures was given at Clark University,\nWorcester, Mass., last November and December, among the\nlecturers being Dr. Driesch, Dr. ScbiUer and Dr. Walter Prince.\nThe Society undoubtedly owes its position in the scientific\nworld, of which the aforesaid references are e^ddence, to the\nconsistency with which, avoiding all sensationalism, it has\nadhered to the fundamental principles of scientific enquiry, and\nin particular to its patient accumulation and cautious sifting of\nevidence. The Council feel that at no time in the Society's\nhistory has it been more important to maintain this attitude\nthan at the present time. In early days two of the principal\nobstacles with which the Society had to contend were indif-\nference and ridicule. These have now been replaced in many\nquarters by an attitude of uncritical acceptance, which is\nimpatient of the Society's apparently slow advance, and con-\nduces as little as indifference to impartial enquiry.\nThe phenomena with which the Society deals occur for the\nmost part sporadically, and cannot be produced to order, and\nthe conditions of their occurrence are still almost unknown.\nA long time has to be spent in the accumulation of apparently\ndull and trifling details before any conclusions are reached\nwhich are worth publication. The Society therefore owes a\ngreat debt of gratitude to those of its members who have\nassisted by placing at its disposal material showing jirima facie\nevidence of supernormal origin, e.g., either in the form of their\nown automatic writings, or in carefully annotated records of\nsittings with trance mediums or of spontaneous or experimental\nthought-transference.\nInvestigations are being carried on in consultation with our\nofficers and independently, which promise well. But even\nshould they prove negative or inconclusive, they may be\ninstructive as to method, or may point in a fairly decisive\nway to a possible explanation of the observed phenomena.\nOf experiments and investigations which prove purely incon-\nclusive (and in all systematic work there must be such), it is\nof course seldom desirable to publish accounts in detail.\nAn experimental investigation, in which Mrs. Warren Elliot\nand other trance-mediums are co-operating and several members\nof the Society are assisting, has been for some time in progress.\n\fMarch, 1927 Annual Report of the Council for 1926 39\nIt has been rendered financially possible by special donations\nfrom members of the Society, and particularly from one very\ngenerous donor who wishes to remain anonymous. Those\nengaged in the work are very hopeful, from what they have\nalready obtained, of getting results of interest and value ; but\nit is likely to take a considerable time to carry out their plans,\nand it is not desirable to say much about the investigation\nwhile it is going on.\nThe Council have made, and are continuing to make, efforts\nto get into touch, while the phenomena are actually in pro-\ngress, with so-called poltergeist cases\u2014movements of objects,\nnoises, etc., which seem to be connected with particular\nlocalities or the presence of particular individuals. As these\noccurrences are generally known to the local clergy, the Council\ncaused a letter to be sent to the principal religious papers in\nthe hope that this would lead to the Society being promptly\nnotified of any such cases as might occur. We cannot con-\ngratulate ourselves on much success so far. The phenomena\nare of course rare, and out of all the cases of poltergeists and\nhaunted houses reported to us during the year only a few\nappeared sufficiently promising to be worth visiting by repre-\nsentatives of the Society. In none of these cases were pheno-\nmena of interest observed. In one \" haunted house \" where\nseveral members of the Society had opportunities of observation,\nthe investigators were able to suggest a normal explanation.\nMiss Newton's experiments in thought-transference mentioned\nin our last report have been reported on by her and by Miss\nJephson, who assisted her throughout. Their report, which is\non the whole disappointing though it presents points of interest,\nwill be read at a private meeting of the Society and printed\nin the Journal. Miss Newton continues experiments of a\npreliminary kind at 31 Tavistock Square with any members\nof the Society who wish to test or discuss their telepathic or\nother psychic powers, and cordially invites members to caU\nwith this object.\nOur members will be interested to hear that Mrs. Piper's\nhealth has sufficiently improved to enable her (with the consent\nof our Society) to agree to give a series of sittings under the\nauspices of the Boston Society for Psychic Research.\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march, 1927\nCertain letters and other manuscripts whicli had belonged\nto the medium Daniel Dunglas Home, together with photo-\ngraphs and a model of his hand, were offered to the Society\nby a nephew of the late Mr. Alexander N. Aksakoff, now\nunfortunately a Russian political refugee. The Council wel-\ncomed the opportunity of acquiring these documents and relics,\nnot only for their intrinsic interest, which is considerable, but\nalso as being in some way a link with Mr. Aksakofi, who at\nhis death bequeathed a large legacy which was the basis of\nour Endowment Fund. Many of the documents have never\nbeen pubUshed, and throw an interesting light on the career\nand times of D. D. Home, a fact which members who attended\nthe Conversazione in November, when Mr. Dingwall exhibited\nand explained some of the more important ones, will appreciate.\nWith them was presented to the Society a large bronze bust\nof D. D. Home. A catalogue of the documents has been com-\npiled, and can be consulted by members in the Society's rooms.\nThe increase in applications for membership of the Society\nwhich we were able to report last year has not been main-\ntained, and we have fallen back to the number in 1923.\nFifty-nine Members were elected during the year, and one\nAssociate became a Member Two Associates who resigned\nin 1925 cancelled their resignations, and two who were included\nin the losses during the same year paid up their arrears of\nsubscriptions and were reinstated On the other hand, eleven\nMembers and ten Associates died during the year, thirty-three\nMembers and twenty Associates resigned, and twelve Members\nand four Associates were removed from membership owing to\nnon-paymeii' of their subscriptions. In the great majority of\ncases of resignation the necessity for economy has been given\nas the reason. The Secretary reports that the total member-\nship of the Society now stands at 1099, of whom 608 are\nMembers, and 491 are Associates.\nThe Council regret to have to record the death of several\nmembers of long standing, including Mr. Desmond Adair,\nProfessor E. G. Browne, Mr. Henry Holt, Dr. H. L. Noel-Cox,\nProfessor W. Romaine Newbold (a Corresponding Member),\nS. M. la Regina Madre Margherita of Italy, Mrs. H. D. Sedg-\nwick, and Mr. E. J. Thomson.\n\fMakch, 1927 Annual Report of the Council for 1926 41\nFour Parts of Proceedings were published during the year :\nPart 97 in January, Part 98 in June, Part 99 in July and\nPart 100 in December. The expenses of printing these Parts\nand the monthly Journal amoimted to \u00a3764, an increase ^of\nmore than \u00a3150 on the total for last year.\nThe sales of the Society's publications at half-price to\nMembers and Associates reahsed \u00a391 Is. lOd., and included\ntwo complete sets of the Proceedings and of the Journal.\nThe sales to the public, by ]\\Ir.

This was done early in the summer\nand cost about \u00a380.\nThe Council once more desire to express their gratitude to\nMr. Sydney C. Scott for the legal advice and assistance that\nhe has generously given during the year in regard to various\nquestions arising out of the Society's tenancy of 31 Tavistock\nSquare.\nOne General Meeting, four Private Meetings, and one Con-\nversazione have\" been held during the year.\nFebruary 18th. \" Some Personal Psychical Experiences and\nExperiments,\" by Dr. Wilham Brown.\n^ March 18th.

S.P.R. (1927), xxiv. 16 ? I\nYour reviewer writes :\n\" Our authors incline to the last [theory,\nthat is, cryptesthesia], but he would be a bold man who would\nassert that any of the rival hypotheses has been satisfactorily\nproved or disproved.\" On the contrary, while not claiming that\nwe have proved dowsing to be a phenomenon of cryptesthesia j\n(since proof in such a connexion is impossible) we do claim that\nwe have \" proved \" dowsing to be insusceptible of a physical\nexplanation. And if your reviewer questions this claim it would ^\nbe a matter of the greatest importance and interest to know his\narguments.\nYour reviewer refers to the investigations of von Klinckow-\nstroem and writes of our \" not altogether accurate references\n\"\nto them. Since our reference consists of a verbatim quotatioij\nfrom a letter by von Klinckowstroem I cannot see where the\ninaccuracy arises.\nFinally, may I very respectfully take exception to the general\ntone of the review, which, in my opinion, is hardly worthy of\na book containing the life-work of the chief founder of the S.P.R. ?\nIt was the considered opinion of Sir William Barrett that \" the *\nfirst movement of thought \" towards incorporating cryptesthesia 1\ninto the canon of accepted science \" will occur from the impos-\nsibility of finding any normal explanation of the phenomena of\ndowsing.\" {The Divining Rod, p. 276.) It therefore comes as\nrather a shock to find dowsing described in the organ of the\nS.P.R. itself as a \" curious by-path of knowledge.\"\nYours faithfully,\nTheodore Bestekman.\nNote by the Reviewer.\nIt cannot often happen that a reviewer is taken to task by an\nauthor on account of a review so preponderantly favourable as\nmy notice of The Divining Rod.\n\fMarch, 1927 Correspondence 45\nI called dowsing a \" curious by-path of knowledge \" because\nit has no obvious connection with any other branch of recognised\nscience or psychical research. The intellectual curiosity which\nleads distinguished scientists like Sir William Barrett to pursue\nsuch by-paths is a scientific virtue of the highest order.\nI do not refer \" to the investigations of von Klinckowstroem,\"\nbut to a summary by him in the Journal for April, 1925, of the\ninvestigations of other German scientists. Either these investi-\ngations are not referred to at all in The Divining Rod (the\ninvestigators are not mentioned by name in the book), or the\nonly reference is that on p. 2.50 (\" In Germany most students of\nthis subject,\" etc.), which entirely misrepresents their views. Either\nalternative is a serious blemish in a book of this size and scope.\nThe positive evidence given in the book for cryptesthesia as\nexplanatory of dowsing is quite inadequate. Mr. Brown's experi-\nments (pp. 256, 257) do not exclude the possibihty either of tele-\npathy or of normal causes {e.g. unintentional hints from bystanders) :\nthe Albert Hall experiments do not exclude telepathy. None of\nthe experiments are in pari materia with dowsing for underground\nwater or minerals, the locahty of which is not within any person's\nnormal knowledge.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Revue Metapsychique for Nov.-Dec, 1926, has an account by\nDr. Osty of a further series of sittings with the Polish medium\nGuzik. The seances took place at the Institute and were very\nunequal in quality. Dr. Osty seems inclined to adopt the pro-\nvisional hypothesis of the genuineness of Guzik's powers, but he\nhas to admit that as the conditions of control became such as\nto lead to a favourable judgment, so the quality of the phenomena\nbecame poorer and their number fewer.\nThe British Journal of Psychical Research for Jan.-Feb. 1927,\nhas an account of the early history of Eleonore Ziigun, the\nEoumanian poltergeist girl ; and Dr. E. J. Tillyard contributes\nthe accounts of two sittings with Margery in 1926. In the\nsecond seance the teleplasm was examined and felt by Dr. Till-\nyard. It was \" a large mass of peculiar white substance just\nlike cooked brains.\" To the touch the mass felt \" hke warm\nrubber or wax, and was definitely turgid. ...\" (159).\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research imarch, 1927\nThe Hibbert Journal for January lias a stimulating article on\nthe drama of death and resurrection by Mr. W. J. Perry of\nUniversity College, London, and an interesting sketch by Mrs.\nLiveing of Jean Vianney, the Cure of Ars. Although the pol-\ntergeist phenomena are not discussed, a good idea is given of\nthe life of this amazing person.^\nThe Zeitschrift fiir hritischen Okkultismus (Bd. ii. Heft 2) has\na paper by Count von Klinckowstroem on Nostradamus and a\nnote by the same author on the history of his experiences in\noccultism. Dr. Richard Baerwald has a criticism of the recently\npublished experiments of Mr. Krall which were undertaken with\na view to testing the Lehmann and Hansen experiments in in-\nvoluntary whispering. Dr. Baerwald considers in some detail\nthe astonishing differences observable in the two series of experi-\nments, and comes to the conclusion that Mr. Krall's work cannot\nbe said to have disproved the factor which was thought so con-\nspicuous in the Danish experiments. Count Perovsky-Petrovo-\nSolovovo contributes to the same issue a candid criticism of the\nrecently pubhshed account of the Dunraven sittings with Home.\nIt is clear that the Count finds himself in considerable difficulties\nwhen he tries to devise normal explanations for the phenomena,\nand he is to be congratulated upon his fearless attempt to deal\nwith the problem and his suggestions that Home occasionally\nused a confederate. He admits that during the majority of Home's\nseances it was possible for the medium to cheat. The question\nremains as to whether he in fact did so, and indeed whether the\nadmission of wholesale cheating will in any way explain the\nmanifestations. Finally he records the case of a Russian military\noificer whose desire to believe was so great that he forbade his\n^ For those who wish to examine the evidence regarding the phenomena\noccurring in the presence of the Cure of Ars, I add here a few references\nin chronological order : J.

(Paris : Felix Alcan,\n1926. 12 francs.)\nThis book, part of which has been reprinted from the Revue\nMetapsychique, is an account of the clairvoyant descriptions given\nat the Institut Metapsychique International by the medium\n\" Pascal Forthuny \" [Georges Cochet].\nM. Forthuny has for many years been connected with literary\nand art journals in Paris, and for some time he was art critic to\nLe Matin. Novelist and musician, M. Forthuny moves in the\nbest Parisian Literary circles, and his knowledge of foreign lan-\nguages, among which is Chinese, gained for him a very fair\nacquaintance with European and Oriental literatures. In June,\n1919, his only son, Frederic, was killed in an aeroplane crash,\nand on the 18th of July, 1920, his mediumship conomenced.\nWhilst sitting at his desk writing a novel, \" his hand suddenly\nceased to obey his conscious thought, and began, as if moved by\nsome impulsive extraneous force, to make a whole series of strokes\njust like a Uttle child at its first writing lesson.\" With amazement\nForthuny took a sheet of white paper, and, placing his hand upon\nit, continued to trace the strokes ; then curves of all sorts ;\nsoon after letters and then words, although still without any\nlogical connection. Calling his wife, Forthuny remarked, \" Here's\na funny thing. I'm a medium \"\n(p. 21).\nMuch intrigued by this occurrence, Forthuny continued his\nattempts, and soon intelligible sentences were produced. Answers\nto questions were obtained, and two controls appeared, a \" guide,\"\nand His son, Frederic.\nThe early features of the automatism do not differ in any pro-\nnounced respect from those commonly observed. Names and\naddresses were given which proved on inquiry to be mere fabrications :\nprophecies were made which were never fulfilled. In the winter\nof 1921, Forthuny was present at a gathering of people at the\nInstitute in Paris. A clairvoyante was giving descriptions, and\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1927\nat one time \" Dr. Geley handed a folded letter to this lady\nasking her to tell him any impressions that contact with it\nsuggested to her.\" M. Forthuny, however, good7humouredly\nintercepted the letter saying that this was not difficult, and pro-\nceeded to relate something of no consequence. He then continued\nin the way adopted by clairvoyants, but although what he said\nhad some significance, it was thought to be due to a coincidence.\nWishing for a further test, Madame Geley took a fan and gave\nit to M. Forthuny. The medium took it, and jokingly remarked,\n\" What's this ? I get the sensation of suffocation, and I hear by\nthe side of me the word filisa.\" The fan had previously belonged\nto an old lady who had died of a lung affection and whose maid\nwas named ifilisa. In this way were Forthuny's clairvoyant\nfaculties discovered. His success later induced Dr. Osty to ask\nhim to demonstrate his powers before a series of meetings at the\nInstitute. The greater part of the book is taken up with an\naccount of these meetings, and M. Forthuny's success cannot be\ndenied. About 1500 persons attended the demonstrations, and\nof these 136 were selected by M. Forthuny for experiment. Ac-\ncording to Dr. Osty's calculations 33-8% obtained striking successes\nin which the medium's statements were wholly or almost wholly\ntrue ;\n30-9% were partial successes ; and 13-2% were total\nfailures. How far the successes can be explained through normal\nprocesses the readers of the book must judge for themselves.\nAccording to M. Forthuny himself, the information is given in a\nvariety of ways, sometimes visual, sometimes auditory. Although\nthe visual images are never so vivid as to be classed as hallucina-\ntory, the sounds are very clear and appear to originate at some\npoint within the head. Dr. Osty is to be congratulated upon his\nwork. It is to be hoped that he will continue his observations\nand embody them in a further volume.\nE. J.

Librarian.\na2\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1927\nOBITUARY.\nDr. Walter Leaf.\n(Died, March 8tli, 1927.)\nWe have to lament the loss, at the age of seventy-five, of\nanother distinguished member of the Society who has supported\nit for many years. Dr. Leaf, chairman of the Westminster\nBank and of other important business enterprises, a great\nscholar and in particular an authority on Homer, was not an\noriginal member of the Society, but he joined it in 1884 and\nremained a member until his death. He served on the Council\nfrom 1889 to 1902, and on the Committee of Reference from\n1893 to 1922. He took an active part in sittings with Mrs.\nPiper\u2014both organising them and himself acting as sitter\n\u2014\nduring her first visit to England in 1889-90, and was respon-\nsible for a large section of the Report on her sittings published\nin Proceedings, Vol. VI. He contributed other papers of\nimportance to our Proceedings, the last being a description,\nbased mainly on a little book by Bjornsen, of the life and\nwork of \"Vis Knut,\" a Norwegian peasant of the last century,\nwho appears to have had supernormal powers. This was\npublished in Proceedings, Vol. XXI. (1908). We also owe to\nDr. Leaf many reviews published in Proceedings.\nHis own conclusion as to what the evidence accumulated up\nto the time of Myers' death in 1901 entitled us to regard as\nproved, was set out with care in a review of Human Person-\nality and its Survival of Bodily Death, when that book came out\nin 1903. The review will be found in Proc, Vol. XVIIL,\npp. 53-61. What he regards the evidence as pointing to is\n(if one may be allowed to put it very shortly), the temporary\nsurvival of a \" cluster of memories,\" to which sensitives may\nhave access, but which is itself gradually disintegrating. This\ncluster of memories he does not regard as a personality.\n\" To me,\" he says (p. 61), \" personality presents itself mainly\nas a limitation\u2014as the barrier which inexorably cuts me off\nfrom those who are nearest and dearest to me, so that they\ncan never '\nknow half the reasons why I smile or sigh.' . . .\nIt is a hope and not a fear that the dissolution of the body\n\fApril, 1927 Obituary 53\nmay mean the dissolution of this spiritual crust as well ; that\none day the infinite which is within us all may have freer\nplay, and mingle in unconstrained communion with other\nspiritual elements equally purged of earthly dross, through\nchannels infinitely clearer and more translucent than the\nimperfect and unsatisfying organs of the mortal frame.\"\nIt was probably the feeling that we were moving very\nslowly, if at all, in the direction of more definite conclusions,\nand that he himself was not likely to be able to do much\nto hasten progress, that led him gradually to drop active\nwork for the Society. But we must always feel him to be\none of those whose work and interest through many years was\nof high value to us.\nCASE.\nL. 1278.\nA Telepathic Experience.\nWe print below a report of what appears to be a telepathic\nimpression. The case has come to us through Sir Oliver\nLodge, to whom the percipient, Mr. J. P. Hodge, wrote as\nfollows :\n6\/\/\/ Feh., 1927.\nKnowing you to be interested iu thought-transference, I venture\nto bring before your notice the following instance. For a number\nof years I have been aware that mental impressions reach me\nsome short while before the spoken word confirms them, but the\ncase I am about to relate is perhaps the most remarkable.\nA few evenings ago I was reading Bullen's Whaleman's Wife,\na romance dealing with the whale-fishery. It contains no refer-\nence to lifeboats.\nI was alone, and, rather losing interest in the book, closed my\neyes and fell into a reverie. Almost immediately I pictured\nmyself at an undefined spot on the English coast, arranging with\na local boatman to take me out in the lifeboat next time there\nwas a call. The call came, and in the most vivid manner I\nmentally visualised the operations of getting the boat out through\nthe surf, with me crouched down against the after air-box, and\nthe coxswain standing by shouting his orders to the crew.\nAway we went, the spray slashing my unaccustomed face, and\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apkil, 1927'\nthe crew sweating at their oars as the boat, now and again,\nawash ahnost to the thwarts, smashed into the waves. It was\nall so realistic that I even called myself a pretty considerable\nfool for getting soaked to the skin in such an enterprise.\nThe entry of my wife put an end to the adventure, and brought\nme back to material things. She had been in the next room\nlistening to a wireless talk on the strenuous times in the history\nof the lifeboats at certain northern ports, and the heroic conduct\nof those engaged in the work of rescue.\nTo me the whole thing seeins a clear case of thought-trans-\nference, and therefore of sufficient scientific interest to warrant\nmy trespassing on your valuable time.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. P. Hodge.\nTo this letter Sir Oliver Lodge replied on February 9th, 1927,^\nto the effect that it would be necessary \" to enquire whether\nyou knew wdiat your w'ife was doing, and the nature of the\nwireless talk to which she was listening,\" and also stating that\nhe proposed to send Mr. Hodge's letter to the Editor of the\nS.P.R. Jom-nal.\nOn receipt of this letter Mr. Hodge wrote again to Sir\nOliver Lodge as follows :\n10\/\/; Feb., 1927.\nIn reply to your letter of yesterday, I regret that a desire not\nto trespass too much on your time shotdd have resulted in my\nformer letter being deficient in details.\nI did not know what my wife was doing, and was under the\nimpression she was upstairs in a bedroom, instead of which she\nwas listening (with head-phones) to the talk on lifeboats in the\nnext room to myself on the ground floor.\nThe talk was descriptive of the methods of launching the boats\nat Newbiggin and Ramsey, and included references to rescue work\ndone under strenuous conditions in recent gales. In addition^\nthe lecturer emphasised the dangerous nature of the lifeboatman's\ncalling, and related a few anecdotes calculated to call up a vivid\nmental picture of the proceedings.\nMy wife was evidently mucli imjiressed, as she came suddenly\ninto the room in which I sat, and spoke somewhat volubly on\nthe matter. Tlie whole thing seemed to me more than a coinci-\ndence, and the fact of my reading a sea story at the time had\n\fApeii., 1927 Case 55\najjparently nothing to do with it, as the book contains no refer-\nence to lifeboats. For a landsman I have a rather unusual\nknowledge of ships and rigging, and the description of a whaler\nwould be c|uite unlikely to lead my thoughts in the direction of\nsuch a highly-specialised type of craft as a lifeboat.\nIt may perhaps be of interest to record that a few evenings\nlater I was reading the British Journal of Pliotograplaj, and while\nthinking over a problem raised in the correspondence I was also\naimlessly running through a list of second-hand apparatus in the\nadvertisements ; in fact, thinking of two things at once, as it is\ncalled. It is when my mind is occupied in this dual manner\nthat it is most receptive to a third impression totally irrelevant\nto the others.\nIn this case I suddenly thought of a friend, a Mrs. B., from\nwhom I had received a letter a week before, and a few seconds\nlater my wife, sitting about four feet behind me, said, Have\nyou answered Mrs. E.'s letter '? \" On my asking her why she\nhad broken a fairly long silence ^vith that question, she stated\nshe had looked up and seen Mrs. E.'s letter among others on\nthe mantelpiece. I could not see it from where I sat.\nIt is curious that my receptiveness to the impressions occurs\nonly at irregular intervals of varying duration, but during the\npast 30 years (I am 52) a sufficient number of instances have\narisen to convince me that telepathy is possible.\nAbout 20 years ago I conducted an experiment in the opposite\ndirection. The subject was a girl about 22, of a pliable and\nsomewhat highly-strung temperament. She sat on a piano-stool,\nand her male cousin and I sat before her and endeavoured to will\nher to do simple things, e.g. walk across the room, touch a\ncertain ornament, etc. She did 5 out of 7 things required.\nThe one that impressed me most was when she, sitting with her\nback to the piano, rose up and took down the portrait of her\nmother from about 7 or 8 other photos on top of the instrument.\nAs she eventually became overwrought and semi-hysterical we\ngave up the experiment, and for this reason I have made no\nfurther attempts.\nj p jjodge.\nOu February 16th, 1927, the Editor, Mrs. Salter, wrote to Mr.\nHodge, asking for a personal statement from Mrs. Hodge,\nand also asking whether Mr. Hodge had read through the\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1927\nwireless programme and might in this way have had some\nknowledge of the subject of the talk to which Mrs. Hodge\nwas listening. To this letter Mr. Hodge replied as follows :\nmil Feb., 1927.\nIn reply to your letter of 16th inst., I have no objection to\nyour printing the account of my experience in the S.P.R. Jourml,\ntogether with my name, as you say the publication is circulated\nprivately. It is only in the case of the public Press that I am\nchary of publicity, as nowadays the papers are run with an eye\nto vulgar self-advertisement and an entire disregard of the feelings\nof those whom they persist in dragging into the limelight.\nA statement is appended of my wife's share in the proceedings.\nAs regards your final query, I may say I had not seen the\nwireless programme prior to receiving the impression. It was the\nextraordinarily vivid mental picture, coinciding with my wife's\nlistening to the talk, that made me think it of sufficient import-\nance to bother Sir Oliver Lodge, as I felt some diffidence in\napproaching him with what he might have considered a trivial\nmatter. You will doubtless have gathered from my two letters\nthat I believe telepathy possible. One often sees the word\n\" supernatural \" used in connection with such phenomena, but to\nme the word has no meaning, save that it smacks of medieval\nsuperstition. J. P. Hodge.\nWith this letter was enclosed the following statement from\nMrs. Hodge :\nFeb. 20th, 1927.\nI beg to state that on the evening in question I, unknown to\nmy husband, had been listening to a wireless talk on the launch-\ning of the lifeboat at Newbiggin and elsewhere during the recent\nsevere gales. I was extremely interested in the talk, and immedi-\nately it was concluded I returned to my husband, whom I had\npreviously left reading a book. On hearing of my description of\nthe talk he remarked what a curious coincidence it was, as on\nmy rejoining him I had disturbed a reverie during which he had\nparticipated in some thrilling lifeboat experiences.\nM. R. Hodge.\nAlthough the fact that Mr. Hodge had been reading a book\nabout whale fishery does not seem to account for his vivid\nimpression of lifeboats, it is worth noting that this may have\n\fApril, 1927 Footnote to a Review 57\nserved as a point de repere for the telepathic impression, assist-\ning its emergence into consciousness.\nFOOTNOTE TO A REVIEW.\nBy Walter Franklin Prince.\nPart 100 of the Proceedings has a review of what is termed\n\" Proceedings of the Boston Society for Psychic Research,\"\notherwise the book The Psychic in the House. The shorter occa-\nsional publications of the B.S.P.R. are by it termed Bulletins,\nand the longer ones, issued as cloth-bound volumes, have no other\ndesignation than their respective titles.\nNaturally, I cannot object to the commendation of my book\nshown in the review. But I am equally in sympathy with the\ncriticism that apparatus should have been employed to determine\nwhether or not certain mysterious sounds were objective in\ncharacter, although subjective sounds may, in a given set of\ncircumstances, be as evidential of some supernormal cause as any\nobjective ones could be. My neglect was the neglect of my\npredecessors, and I shall hope to repair it if such sounds ever\nkindly renew themselves in the future.\nNevertheless, I must ask to call attention to a few inadvertences\nof the reviewer, else readers will not be properly apprised of what\nthe book in question contains.\nIt is not a fact that I was \" inclined \" to think \" that all\nthese sounds [raps, etc.] were supernormaUy produced.\" On a\nnumber of pages, as pp. 84, 87, 90, 99, doubt or disbelief in\nrelation to certain of the sounds is expressed.\nAnd certainly, if I had heard raps only in my of&ce, and there\nonly when alone, it would as readily have occurred to me that I\nheard them because I was alone. The point, emphasized in the\nbook, is that elsewhere I habitually heard them when in company\nof others. The review does not give due recognition to those\nfeatures of the complex rapping record which impart to it\nsignificance ; such as the sudden ushering in of a period of raps\nby a shower of sounds in a house hitherto quiet at night, the\nnearly simultaneous beginning of raps in my office, the sudden\nand permanent cessation of the sounds in the office, the seeming\nindication of intelligence in connection with the raps, and other\nfeatures stated in the book.\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1927\nIt may seem an easy matter to \" invalidate \" these occurrences\nby drawing an imaginary portrait of a temperament quite unlike\nmy actual one, but it should be explained why, with such a\ntemperament roused to the point of pop-eyed credulity, and with\nother persons in the house still experiencing what my critic terms\n\" haunting \" phenomena, I became unable to hear any more such\nsounds, either in the house or the office, alone or in company,\nfor more than six months, or until the '\"\nbangs \" came. I am\nunable to see how Mr. Dingwall's hearing raps for which he has\n\" no explanation \" heljis in the work of invalidation. Why\ndoesn't he proceed to find out the explanation of his raps, with\nthe aid of the apparatus which he recommends that I employ ?\nOf the remarkable group of occurrences in which the dog\nfigured, one, and that far from being the most puzzling, is selected,\nand it is said :\n\" Now Prince has yet to show that the dog saw\nthe apparition at all (his italics).\" Why should I show it 1 In\nthat case I did not allege it. Through two pages I only once\nhint that possibly the dog shared the experience of its mistress.\nMy curiosity was directed to the question why the psychic, after\nshe saw the dog leap and stand staring, was stimulated to see\nan apparition of her grandmother, who had entered her life only\nbriefly when a child\u2014why her subconscious should fix upon this\nalmost forgotten gxandmother as a fit object to cause the dog\nalarm. As to the suggestion that the dog \" suddenly got burnt\n\"\non the register, it was, I suspect, that of one who does not know\ndogs. No dog, burnt on a register, acts in that manner,\n\u2014\nfollowing the leaping by staring, not toward the register but in\nanother direction, then showing panic and trying to butt through\na closed door, and refusing to enter that room for a week after-\nward. Of course, if one is at liberty to boil down the details to\n\"jumped up and howled,\" then there is left nothing \"so peculiar,\"\nso far as the dog is concerned. But why suppose the burnt nose,\nwhen I myself suggested that the dog might have had a nightmare ?\nA number of questions are asked which do not seem to me to\ngo very deeply into the matter. \" Why does the grandmother's\nspirit terrify the dog ?\n\" There are many accounts, some of\nthem well authenticated, of dogs and cats and horses being\nfrightened by something apparently seen by them, invisible to\nhuman companions or seen by them as apparitions. Why does\nshe content herself with one jjeek ? \" I don't know, nor why\n\fApril, 1927 Footnote to a Revieiv 59\nshe shouldn't. Nor have I anywhere urged that she did in fact\nhave one. If she did, her reason is her own business, which I\nknow no more than I know why a hen crosses the road. I\ndid think it worth mentioning that the one time in the psychic's\nlife when she saw an apparition of her grandmother was the one\ntime when, ex liypothesi, the dog burnt its nose. Perhaps if the\ndog burns its nose again, the grandmother hallucination will be\nrepeated. If it is I shall report it as an interesting psychological\nfact, without, I hope, necessarily implying that I incline to a\nspiritistic interpretation.\"\nIf it could be grasped that when I discuss a theory, I treat it\nfairly, including all its implications, it might be seen that such\nfairness does not warrant the guess that I am convinced of it\nin application to the case discussed. I am perfectly amiable\ntoward the theory that the crystal visions came by telepathy\nfrom the living and say : \"If telepathy is involved, whether\nfrom the living or the dead,\" etc. But the telepathic hypothesis\nhas been discussed ad nauseam, and is well understood in applica-\ntion to such problems. I had in hand a complication of facts of\na 'prima facie spiritistic appearance, was disposed to give the\nspiritistic theory (which I do think has amply earned its right to\nthe arena) a fair chance if only for a change, not being one of\nthose who think it a scientific duty to argue for telepathy ever-\nlastingly and exclusively, and to give scant attention to any other\npossible solution. I am obdurately unrepentant for having done\nthis, but certainly should never become a spiritist on the basis of\nthis case alone.\nMay I once more quote from the review \\\n\" The attraction\nthat the spiritistic solution has for Prince is well illustrated by\nanother incident.\" And that incident is that the psychic saw\nan apparition, asked me to stand near the spot where she saw it,\nwhich I did ; I was told that the person unseen by me was touch-\ning me, I felt certain pronounced sensations on a particular\nfinger, and the psychic without knowledge of this declared that I\n\"was touched on that finger. I simply reported these facts, and\nnowhere said or hinted that I thought that a spirit actually\ntouched me. Could I have said less, consistently with the truth,\nhad I been the most obdurate materialist living ? As a matter\nof fact I have never fixed upon the spiritistic solution of that odd\nincident. Nor have I fixed upon any other. How, then, does this\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1927\nincident well illustrate the attraction that this theory has for me ?\nIs it because I was willing to experiment with the supposed spirit?\nWell do I remember the orthodox farewell which Mr. Dingwall\nuttered, with all the unction of the faithful (astonishing and well-\nnigh upsetting me by his histrionic abilities), when a \" spirit \" of\nluminous cheese-cloth retreated into the cabinet. But I never\nsupposed that his complaisant \" Good-by, Pansy,\" well illustrated\nthe attraction that a spiritistic solution had for him.\nReaders are so apt to ascribe ill-feeling to even the most care-\nfully worded academic discussion that I add that there is none,\neither in the criticisms by my former valued office-colleague or in\nthe exceptions which I have taken. I simply wish it understood\nthat any argument in the book should be taken with all its\npoints in combination, and that if some incidents of weaker\nevidential character were included consequent upon my desire\nto make the record complete, these should be taken in conjunction\nwith the evidentially stronger ones.\n[In his note to my review of his Psychic in the House, which\n\" is equivalent to a Proceedings, vol. i., of the Boston Society for\nPsychic Research \" (p. 7), Dr. Prince raises too many questions\nto be discussed here. I may point out, however, that Dr. Prince\nadmits that he fails to appreciate the very relevant point concern-\ning the raps heard by me, and actually suggests that I should\ninvestigate them by instrumental means. Moreover he appears\nto put forward a vigorous defence of his position as an advocate\nof the spiritistic hypothesis when it has not been attacked. Such\na position is fully justified if the facts warrant its assumption.\nReaders of Dr. Prince's will decide this point for themselves.\nE.J.D.]\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nEleonore ZiiGUN and the National Laboratory op Psychical\nResearch.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nFebruary 23rd, 1927.\nDear Madam,\u2014Though long a quiescent member of this Society\nwith no psychical standing or experience, it may yet be pardon-\nable on my part to comment on the above topic for the reasons\n\fApril, 1927 Correspondence 61\ngiven below. I do not know how the S.P.R. and the National\nLaboratory stand to one another, and whether there is the\npossibiHty in the future of sympathetic intercourse or of co-\noperation between the two bodies ;\nbut seeing little chance of\never witnessing any psychical phenomena as a member only of\nthe former Society, I joined the latter for this purpose. I am a\nsceptic in matters psychical, never having had any personal\nexperience of or first-hand acquaintance with anything of the kind,\nnor have I as yet seen any manifestation at a seance under test\nconditions. I read fairly diligently the Society's publications, and\nconsider the evidence brought forward sufficient for the establishment\nof some form of telepathy ;\nbeyond this I cannot go at present,\nbeing one of the doubting Thomases, and a representative of a\nprobably fairly numerous and increasing class of person, not\ncredulous by nature and made still more wary by a scientific\ntraining.\nThe full, clear and interesting Report ^ of the strange happenings\nwhich occurred at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research\nlast October in connexion with the Roumanian peasant girl,\nEleonore Ziigun, is now to ^hand. It occupies the whole of the\nJanuary number of the Proceedings. It is of special interest to\nme, as I attended one of the sittings. I paid my guinea and\ntook my chance, and had the \" satisfaction \" of seeing nothing.\nI do not grudge the payment ; the sitting, negative though it\nwas, has made the report much more interesting and vivid.\nThe seance I attended was held in daylight for the most part\non Saturday afternoon, October 9th. Eleonore Ziigun was in my\npresence approximately from 2 to 5.30 p.m. This day is dismissed\nin four lines in the Report (p. 26), as follows :\nNo telekinetic phenomena were witnessed on this day, but\nseveral \" stigmata \" appeared on the child's face and arms\nunder conditions which precluded the possibility of the girl\nmaking the marks herself.\nNo \" stigmata \" appeared during the sitting, and I do not\nrecollect being told that they were visible that morning, so\npresumably they became manifest during the evening after I left.\nFrom a perusal of the Report, this day seems to have been the\nmost barren of results of those included in the three weeks'\n1 Proceeding Nat. Lab. of Psych. Research, Vol. I., Part I, Jan. 1927.\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1927\nperiod of observation at the Laboratory, so my fellow- sitters and\nmyself had particularly bad luck. My companions in the seance\nroom consisted of three gentlemen unknown to me\u2014a senior\nman, a sceptic who had never yet succeeded in witnessing any\npsychic phenomenon under test conditions ; a man of middle age,\na believer in spiritualism ;\nand a young man who said he would\nhave to reconstruct his philosophy of life if these things were\ntrue. Countess Wassilko, Eleonore's rescuer and guardian, was\npresent for most of the time, and I appreciated this opportunity\nof meeting such an interesting, clever and charming lady. I\nalso had the pleasure of hearing her lecture on Bleonore the\nTuesday following. The Secretary, Miss Kay, was in attendance\nthe Avhole time, and a fifth man was in the seance room for\nsome minutes at one period.\nWe spent a jjleasaut social afternoon, enlivened at times by\nsome vigorous argument between the senior and middle-aged\ngentleman. Before tea Eleonore played with the dog, diabolo,\netc. She also coloured-in some outline drawings under the\nguidance of the Countess. I noticed she went behind the pro-\ntective screen once at least to get some toy or replace one, and\nmy eyes were then glued on her, in case anything telekinetic\nshould happen later. After tea (I think it was after and not\nbefore) we tried to induce phenomena by joining hands round the\ntable under red light. I had control of Eleonore on one side.\nNothing happened, and the sitting had then to be abandoned.\nAt the lecture the thought passed through my mind, what a fine\nopportunity for some psychical manifestation, as the medium was\npresent the whole time, but nothing abnormal occurred.\nFrom the Report much of a marvellous and aj)parently genuine\ncharacter did happen under test conditions. Even with the\nfear of being held hypercritical attention might be called to certain\ncoincidences noticed in the Report. The \" stigmata \" appear to be\nrestricted to the parts of the body which could easily be reached\nby the hands or mouth. The marks on the face are likened to\nstreaks or scratches, and those on the hands and arms to bites,\ncorresponding to injuries that might have been caused by nails\nand teeth respectively. Eleonore was never detected in the act\nof self-infliction, and strict watch was apparently kept ; still it\nwould have been a satisfaction to see these \" stigmata \" arise\nspontaneously with one's own eyes.\n^\n\fAprii,, 1927 Corres'po n dence. 63\nThe magnetic white letters used for notices on the ground\nfloor in the entrance were observed by me before I was aware\nthat they had been connected with startling telekinetic events.\nThough it is very unlikely that Eleonore could have had access\nto the receptacle in which the spare letters were kept, one wonders\nwhether sufficient precaution was taken to see that no letter was\never missing from the notice board itself. As I passed the board,\nthe detachment of a letter appeared quite a simple matter. As\nfar as I could see, practically the whole of the premises of 16\nQueensberry Place, the home of the Laboratory, is taken up with\nPsychical and Spiritualistic Societies of one kind or another.\nBelievers in Spiritualism are inclined to accept \" phenomena\n\"\nwithout sifting the evidence. The handling of these letters was\nnot under the control of the Laboratory.\nThe fiuding by Dr. Tillyard of the magnetic lett-er \" C attached\nto the case of his pocket-knife is indeed an extraordinary incident.\nPresumably it was not there before he had paid his farewell\nvisit to the Countess and Eleonore at the Laboratory. The\nproximity of the medium might therefore be assumed necessary for\nits reappearance \\n such a novel position. Should the still missing\nletter \"\"\nW \" suddenly drop on to the deck of the steamer convey-\ning Dr. Tillyard to Xew Zealand, as is (facetiously ?) hoped in the\nEeport (p. 40), a doubting Thomas might be converted to a belief\nin telekinesis and related phenomena.\"\nIn reading the account of the sudden reappearance of the\nlost sapphire ring, as an example of apport,\" it would have\nbeen more convincing had Eleonore been minutely searched before\nthe sitting commenced. Apparently this was not done, as no\nreference is made to it. When telekinesis or apports are in\nquestion, perhaps all sitters should be required \" to turn out their\npockets \" before the seance begins.\nIn conclusion, may I have better luck in obtaining first-hand\nevidence should an opportimity again present itself.\nJoHX Paekix.\nBl.\\ithw.'\\.ite, Caelisle.\n[Cf. \"Notes on Periodicals,\" beloiv. \u2014Ec]\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1927\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Sunday Ghronicle of Jan. 16, 1927, prints part of a circular\nwhich has been recently sent to a number of spiritualist organiza-\ntions by Mr. John Lewis, of the International Psychic Gazette.\nMr. Lewis suggests that in the recent exposure of the medium\nEvans by the Sunday Chronicle, the Committee were in a con-\nspiracy to discredit him and did so by \" casting around him a\nsheet or garment \" [in which he was posing as the materialized\nfigure of \" Sister Catherine \"'].

He appears to have been impressed with what he\nobserved, and concludes his account as follows :\n\" No serious\ninquirer has the right to pass judgment upon such occult mani-\nfestations unless he has acquired a sufficient body of experience\nthrough personal observations and contact with such mediums as\nFrau Silbert. Personally, I do not hesitate, as man, investigator\nand philosopher, to admit the honesty of Frau S. and the genuine-\nness of her mediumistic faculties \"\n(p. 8). The same issue has a\npaper by Dr. Tischner on Hyperaesthesia and Clairvoyance, and\nalso an article by Prof. Blachcr on the question whether medium-\nship is a growing or declining faculty.\nThe Proceedings of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research\nfor January, 1927, has a report \" on the telekinetic and other\nphenomena witnessed through Eleonore Ziigun,\" by Mr. Harry\n\fApril, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 65\nPrice. After a short introduction, the alleged supernormal occur-\nrences are described, and the results of attempted seance procedure\nare discussed. The report closes with a delineation from the\nmedium's hands by Mr. Jacquin. In his opinion \" the nervous\nnatality or '\npsychic '\nforce in Eleonore Ziigun, instead of being\nused by her own personality, is being used by some order of\ndiscarnate being\u2014a discarnate intelUgence of a low order \" (59).\nThe Berliner Tagehlatt of February 20th has an article by one\nof the authors of the \"\"\nDreimannerbuch,'' Dr. Hans Rosen-\nbusch of Munich. It is entitled \" The Exposure of the Roumanian\nDevil : Eleonore Ziigun and the Dragon Dracu : the film brings\nit out.\" The article describes how Ziigun and her protectress\nthe Countess Wassilko were in Munich for the purpose of posing\nin film studies of Ziigun's alleged stigmata. Dr. Rosenbusch and\nothers had some experiences with the medium ; and detailed\nevidence is brought forward that the markings were caused by the\nmedium herself, ably assisted by the Countess, who under the\nshield of clever misdirection (which failed in its purpose), tried\nto scratch the medium's skin to produce the weals. The Daily\nNews of Feb. 28th has a report from its correspondent in Berlin\nthat an action for alleged libel is to be brought against Dr.\nRosenbusch, and six Viennese savants have published a statement\nsignifying their faith in the Countess and belief in the abnormal\ncharacter of Ziigun's skin markings.\nThe Journal of the American S.P.R. for January has a paper by\nMr. Sudre on \" Stigmatism and Ideoplastics,\" with special reference\nto Janet's recently j^ublished book, De Vangoisse a Vextase (Paris,\n1926). The volume deals with the religious delirium and accom-\npanying phenomena in the woman Madeleine, who was for some\ntime iinder observation in the Salpetriere. A mild form of\nstigmata was present, and during seven years they were observed\nabout twenty times. Mr. Sudre's method of dealing with the\nfacts is characteristic of him ; and he gives a clear and per-\nsuasive accoimt of certain other cases, concluding with the opinion\nthat it is through these borderland phenomena that the tele-\nplastic manifestations can be approached. The issue of the same\nJournal for February has a paper by Prof. Driesch on the methods\nof theoretical psychical research. The writer insists on the\nnecessity of the exj^erimenters imposing their conditions on the\nmedium through the influence of suggestion, and similar devices.\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1927\nProf. Driesch continues with an examination of various facts which\nare thought to favour a spiritistic interpretation, but he is care-\nful to distinguish certain phenomena as probably due to some\nhuman faculty, as for example in the case of the medium Ludwig\nKahn, whose billet-reading is \" probably not under the influence\nof a spirit.\" In the same number is an article by Mr. Bird on\nthe \" Theoretical Aspect of Apport,\" and a note by Mr. Sudre on\nthe Ziigun case, with special references to the alleged apport\nphenomena of this medium. '\nIn the Joiinud of Abnormal and, Social Fsychology for Jan.-\nMarch, 1927, is the much discussed article by Dr. and Mrs.\nRhine on their sitting with Margery. The seance took place on\nJuly 1, 1926, and a description of what was observed is here\npublished for the first time. The conclusion to which these two\ninquirers have been led is that \" the whole game was a base and\nbrazen trickery, carried out cleverly enough under the guise of\nspirit manifestations.\" In sup])ort of this conjecture a number of\narguments are adduced which are further assisted by noting the\ninconsistencies which appear only to be explicable on the theory\nof fraud. Dr. Rhine's case is a strong one, but what he does\nnot appear to realise is that almost precisely similar objections\ncan be raised against the vast majority of all physical mediums\nand a goodly percentage of mental subjects. This has long been\nrecognised by serious investigators, and recent events in Europe\nhave not conduced to remove or weaken that opinion. Dr.\nRhine hopes that his report will do something \" to spare the\nname of psychic research some of the ridicule which such spurious\ncases bring upon it.\"\" He declares lie has no desire to attack the\nCrandons, but merely wishes to distinguish \" such fraudulent\nactivity\" from the ''genuine basis of psychic research.\"\nE.

[Brinton's Trans.]\nAlthough I do not think M. Rouhier quotes the above question\nfrom Father de Leon's Road to Heaven, it will serve to introduce\nthe reader to the divine plant, or in M. Rouhier's own words,\n\" la plante qui fait les yens emerveilles.\" What drug is this\nwhich finds its way to the confessional and which permits the\npartaker to solve problems and discover lost articles ?\nPeyotl is a small cactus without spines found in Mexico and in\nthe extreme south of the United States. Its area of growth can\nbe roughly defined as extending on the north from Deming (New\nMexico) to Corpus Christi ; on the east from Corpus Christi to\nPuebla ; on the west from Sombrerete (Zacatecas) to Deming\n;\nand on the south from Puebla to Sombrerete. In certain localities\nthe plant grows so abundantly that proper names take their\norigin from it, and Seler cites a mission near Villa Lerdo called\n\" El Santo Nombre de Jesus Peyoites.\" Peyotl for the most\npart appears to grow on desert regions and the lofty \" steppes.\"\nIt prefers usually arid districts and rocky cliffs, stony slopes and\nthe sides of mountains denuded of vegetation. Clinging close to\nthe ground it sprouts in little clusters, the rounded heads of which\nspring from one stalk and press the one against the other. The\ntotal length of the cactus can attain 1.5 to 20 cm. at the maxi-\nmum. The rounded top is slightly flattened and in the centre\nappears a shallow depression. The sides vary according to the\nage of the plant, and are more or less irregular.\nThe Indians of the United States make use of Peyotl in the\ndry state. They do not often gather it themselves, more com-\nmonly buying it from traders who hawk it to the most frequent\nconsumers. To prepare it for sale a section is cut horizontally\nfrom the upper portion above the neck ; and thus green juicy\nslices are obtained, which are then dried in the open air.

It is this second phase in which\nthe consumer becomes conscious of visions in full colour. During\nthe early doses the pulse slows down, the face becomes rosy and\nanimated, the eyes quick and brilliant. The subject becomes\ntalkative and seems exhilarated. Later, if the room is darkened\nand the experimenter closes his eyes, the visions commence.\nWhite or violet clouds appear, float seemingly in front of the\neyes and then fade away. Kaleidoscopic compositions follow, and\nsometimes vivid points of light, like a meteoric shower, fall from\nabove in glittering cascades. Endless movements follow ;\nrhythmical\npulsations without end. It is the \"Genie du Peyotl \" which \"a\ndefinitivement ouvert les portes d'or de son merveilleux domaine au\n'chercheur d'infini.'\n\"\nWhatever may be the truth concerning the alleged supernormal\nfaculties conferred upon the peyotl drinker, M. Rouhier has not\ndealt with them. Perhaps the stories may have sprung from the\nundoubted fact of the persistence after consumption of pro-\nnounced visual hyperaesthe^^ia. The stimulation of imaginative\nactivity is also present, but nevertheless the plant's reputation as\nan assistant to the sorcerer is widely spread. There appears to\nbe little doubt that the drug played some part in the growth and\npopularity of Nagualism, although M. Rouhier has not attempted\nto deal in any detail with this important aspect of the question.\nIntoxication played a prominent part in the secret Mexican\nrituals, and both levitation and telepathic phenomena were claimed.^\nIt would seem advisable that some detailed investigation might\nbe made in this direction. The whole question of the possible\nemergence of images telepathically received under the influence\n\u00bb of drugs deserves to be considered, and no doubt volunteers to\nact as subjects could easily be obtained. M. Rouhier has played\nhis part in providing us with a monograph upon one at least of\nthe substances which have gained a reputation in this respect,\nand he is to be congratulated upon the clearness and order which\ncharacterises his work.

A Book-Test.\nWe print below a report of a book-test sent to us by Lord\nand Lady Grey of Fallodoii. It was obtained at a sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard at which they were both present on\nDecember 9th, 1926. There was, unfortunately, a certain\namount of doubt as to the identification of one of the test\nbooks, and it will perhaps make matters clearer for the reader\nif we discuss one source of this confusion before describing the\ntest in detail.\nThere were on this occasion two ostensible communicators,\nLady Grey's son, Bim, and his father, the late Lord Glen-\nconner, and the communicators differed one with another as to\nthe position of the second test book. The statement made by\nLady Grey's son indicated a book which was found to have no\nrelevance ; the statement made by Lord Glenconner was open\nto two ])ossible interpretations (discussed below), either of\n^Accidentally omitted from the April Journal.\n\fMat, 1927 Case 71\nwhich gave a result of some interest. If therefore we follow\nLord Glenconner's statement one source of confusion will be\neliminated.\nThe original report of the case was contained in a statement\ndictated by Lord Grey, as follows :\nA BOOK-TEST\nReceived at a sitting with Mrs. Leonard on the\n9th December, 1926 ;\nLord and Lady Grey of Fallodon present.\nDictated by Lord Grey.\nThe sitting began by a description of the kind of happiness\nwhich those feel on the other side.\nA room with books on both sides of the door was then indi-\ncated. We were told to disregard the books on the left and to\nconcentrate particularly on the books on the right [i.e. to the\nright as one enters the room]. To take the third book from the\nleft on the second shelf from the ground, on page 18. A little\nway down the page we should find \" a reference to what he made\nFeda say at the beginning of this sitting about their particular\nkind of hapjjiness.\" He does uot say that the word \" hajjpiness\n\"\nis used, but words expressing what he said about \" the opening\nout \" there : the satisfaction in happiness they have. \" It would\nespecially be their kind of happiness that they speak of uow,\nMrs. Bim.\"\nThe book thus clearly indicated is entitled Pictures of Bird\nLife. On page 18 nothing appropriate was found ; but on\ntransposing the figures and referring to page 81, the following\npassage occurs in describing the song of the nightingale :\n\" In passionate intensity it is unrivalled, and its char-\nacteristics are so unmistakeable, that once heard it can never\nagain be mistaken.\"\nOn the opposite page, approximately at the corresponding place,\noccur the words \" an increased range.\"\nIn the description of the next book there was confusion, as Bim\nsaid it was two books to the right, and his Father said it was\nfive books to the left ; that in this book, on page 32, something\nwould be found si^eciaUy fitting to Lord Grey, \" a message that\nwill especially apply to him.\"\n\f72 Joitrval of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1927\nThe description given left, it doubtful which book was meant,\nbut pointed to the book indicated being one\"\" of !^three different\nvolumes. One of these was clearly irrelevant ; another was Lord\nGrey's own book on fishing, and a third was Fishing and\nShooting, by Sydney Buxton. The page given was 32, and on\nthat page of this last-named book is a description of a corner on\nthe River Itchen, which had been for many years a j^articularly\nfavourite place of Lord Grey when fishing ; he had always called\nit \" The Haystack Corner.\" On the l^age specified, describing the\nspot, it says, \" there is always a haystack there.\"\nThe directions continue :\n\" Is there a book about music just\nclose to it, because, when he was touching this book, he felt\nmusic ? He does not think it is a book about music, but words\nmeaning music. Perhaps the book has got nothing to do with\nmusic at all, but it has got to do with sounds and harmonies, and\nyou see something about music on the outside of the book.\" The\nthird book from the left of Lord Buxton's book above referred to\nhas for title : Songs of the Edinburgh Angling Club. There is\nno musical notation in it ;\nyet it is a book of songs.\n(Signed) Pamela Grey.\nThis statement is an accurate account of the facts.\n(Signed) Grey of Fallodon.\nI bear witness that the books found were in the position as\nstated. I was present at the looking out of the tests.\nPhemie Davis.\nIn reply to this statement the Editor, Mrs. Salter, wrote to\nLady Grey asking for further details as to how the three\nvolumes mentioned in connexion with the second test were\nidentified. To this question Lord Grey replied by a statement\ndictated on February 22nd. 1927, as follows :\nThe first direction about the second book was as follows : Bim's\ndirection was that it was two books to the right of the first\nbook\u2014this would make it the fifth book from the left. This was\nthe book which was clearly not relevant. His father said it was\nfive books to the left (of the first book). Now, the first book\nwas the third book from the left. In order therefore to get the\nfifth book to the left of the first book, it was necessary to pass\nover the wooden slat that divides the shelves, and proceed into\n\fMat, 1927 Case 73\nthe parallel shelf. The doubt then arose, whether the phrase\n\" the fifth book from the first \" meant that the first book was to\nbe counted as the beginning. If it was so counted, the second\nbook indicated would then be Lord Grey's own book on Dry Fly\nFishing. If it was not so counted, the second book would then\nbe the book immediately beyond Lord Grey's own book, i.e.\nSydney Buston's book Fishing and Shootifig, with a description\non the page cited of the haystack corner.\nWith regard to the doubt raised by Lord Grey as to whether\nthe expression \" the fifth book from the first\n\"'\nshould be\ninterpreted to mean that the first book was to be counted as\nthe beginning,\" two points are worth noting.\n(1) Such evidence as has come to our notice seems to\nindicate that when communicators identify a book in this way,\ne.g. by saying that it is \" the fifth from the first,\" they do\nnot intend the first book to be reckoned in the count. An\nexample of this is to be found in Mrs. Sidgwick's \" An Exami-\nnation of Book-Tests,\" Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXL, p. 278 :\nFeda reports A. W. V. [the communicator] as saying :\n\" The\nfifth book, not the fifth from the first, but counting the first.\"\nThis statement seems clearly to imply that if the expression\n\"the fifth from the first\" had been used, the first book\nshould not have been included in the count.\n(2) Quite apart from evidence as to the practice obtaining in\nthis matter at sittings with Mrs. Leonard, it seems to us more\nnatural to interpret the words \" the fifth from the first \" to\nmean that the first book is not to be reckoned in the count,\nand it is to be observed that that is apparently the way in\nwhich Lord Grey himself interpreted the similar directions given\nby Bim above (see Lord Grey's statement of February 22nd,\n1927).\nIf then we take it that when the communicator stated that\nthe second test book was five books to the left of the first\ntest book, he did not intend the first test book to be reckoned\nin the count, the volume thus identified is Sydney Buxton's\nbook. Fishing and Shooting, on p. 32 of which was found\na statement having a close personal association for Lord\nGrey.\n\f74 Jourruil of Society for Psychical Re.'^earch may, 1927\nTHE D. D. HOME COLLECTION.\nThe Society has recently acquired through the heirs of the late\nD. D. Home a collection of MSS. and other objects belonging\nto the medium and his second wife.\nIt consists in the main of letters to D. D. Home, of which\nthere are over seven hundred, including correspondence from\nSir William Crookes, Allan Kardec, Mrs. Lyon J. Bundy, F. H.\nWillis, W. M. Wilkinson, etc. Among other exhibits are the\noriginal M8S. of Mrs. Home's two books, D. D. Home : His\nLife and Mission and The Gift of D. D. Home ; an unjniblished\nMS. by Home on the \"Modern Spiritual Manifestations\"; a\ncollection of photographs both of the medium and men and\nwomen of his time ; a number of records of sittings with\nHome, of which some are unj)ublished ; a large bust of the\nmedium and a cast of his left hand.\nA catalogue has been prepared and may be seen shortly at\nthe Society's Rooms.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe ZeilscJinft fur pxt\/cJiisciie Forschung for February has an article\nby Prof, [of Theology] Richard Hoffmann of Vienna on his\nexperiences in four .sittings with the medium Rudi Schneider in\nBraunau, where the young man's parents live. Prof. Hoffmann\nappears to have had the phenomena usually associated with this\nmedium, which comprise movements of the curtain, telekinesis, and\nmaterialisations. The seances took place in July 1924, and at the\nfirst the movements of the curtain, whilst the Professor held Rudi's\nhands and controlled his feet, were so curious that they brought\ninstant conviction owing to the conditions of control (\" ein fiir\nmich sogleich absolut einwandfreies Phanomen,\" p. 48). The issue\ncloses with a continuation of Karl du Prel's psychic novel, \" Das\nKreuz am Ferner.\"\nThe Congregational Quarterly for January has a short paper by\nMr. J. A. Hill on Spiritualism and Psychical Research. The\nwriter records how, through his own personal experiences, he\nbecame convinced that survival of bodily death is a fact, and that\ncommunication is sometimes possible. He gives a few examples\nof evidential communications, and, after illustrating his thesis by\na few specimens of apparitions seen at the moment of death, he\n\fMay, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 75\ncloses with the opinion that psychical research is giving the death-\nblow to materialism. \" Our evidence,\" he writes, \" makes\nmaterialism scientifically untenable.\" It establishes the existence\nof a spiritual world, and supplies the religious man with a\nfoundation for his religion.\nThe Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for February has a short\naccount by Prof. Ludwig Jahn of a new clairvoyant medium in\nCologne, Mr. Fritz Fastenrath. His work has been known since\n1924, and he combines the alleged faculty of clairvoyance with\nmedical diagnosis. Not only does he describe the ailments of his\npatients, but when writing to them he describes accurately the\ncontents of their houses. In the same issue is a critical review by\nDr. Marcinowsky of Dr. Hellwig's recently published Okkultismus\nu. Wissenschaft, and a note by Dr. Kauders on what he describes\nas the \" materialisation \" of a finger which was observed in 1.556.\nDr. Kauders does not appear to give the source of his information,\nbut those who are interested will find it in Richard Hakluyt's\nThe Priricipal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the\nEnglish Nation (London, 1599), i. 312 seq. Richard Johnson is\ndescribing certain incidents observed among the Samoeds. At a\nmeeting, or what we should probably call a seance, the priest or\nmedium became \" as it were madde.\" Then he took a sword\n\" of a cubite and a spanne long,\" and thrust it into his belly,\nbut no wound was visible.^ After this the priest took his seat\nupon a sort of low stool and his head and left arm were tied up\nwith a long line, which was held on either side. A large gown\nwas thrown over the whole, and when the line was pulled the\nknots disappeared and an object was heard to fall into a kettle\nof hot water which the priest had with him : this object was\nsupposed to be the priest's head, shoulder and left arm, but\nJohnson was not allowed to verify this phenomenon. Instead of\nthis marvel all that was vouchsafed was a finger which was thrust\nout of the gown twice \" and there was no hole to be seene.\"\nJohnson does not add that he agrees with Dr. Kauders' opinion\nas to its being materialized.\nThe Revue Metapsychique for Janvier-Fevrier has a paper by\nDr. Xavier de Watraszewski on the alleged clairvoyant faculties of\nthe Polish medium, Miss M. Sabira. The phenomena appear to\nbe of a remarkable character and simple to control. The medium\nThis feat is commonly reported of Shamans.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt May, 1927\nis seated before a table and a pile of sealed letters, boxes and\npackets are placed before her. She takes up each object, places\nit against her forehead, and gazing into a small crystal ball,\ndescribes with an extraordinary accuracy the contents of the\nvarious sealed packets. In addition to her clairvoyant powers,\nDr. Watraszewski affirms that both psychometry and medical\ndiagnosis have been successful, the latter statement being confirmed\nby a medical colleague from the Saint-Lazare hospital in Warsaw.\nIn the same issue Mr. C. de Vesme has the first part of an\narticle on the role of supernormal phenomena in the origin of\nreligious beliefs. Whilst criticising the various anthropological\nschools of thought, he admits the importance of the mass of\nmaterial gathered together, but complains that, whereas many of\nthe more startling facts are believed and repeated by anthro-\npologists, the facts relating to alleged supernormal occurrences are\nalmost everywhere rejected. Mr. de Vesme has raised a suggestive\npoint, and he cannot be unaware that the practice of blindly\nfollowing authorities in both anthropology and psychical research\nis one to be condemned, and one which already shows signs of\nbeing discarded.

It is\nhoped that the Report will be published later in Proceedings.\n\fJune, i'j27 Report on Experiments in Thoioght Transference 79\nA REPORT ON EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT\nTRANSFERENCE.!\nBy Miss Ixa Jephso]s\\\nAllusion has been made in three of the C'ouncirs Annual\nReports to the long series of experiments in thought trans-\nference at the Society's rooms, which have been carried out\nunder Miss Newton's direction. Since the summer of 1925\nMiss New^ton has been too much occupied in other ways to\ncontinue the experiments systematically ; so this seems a good\nmoment to report briefly on what has been done.\nThe experiments began in May 1923. Miss Newton's inten-\ntion in initiating them was not so much to add to the actual\nevidence for telepathy as to find out, if possible, more about\nthe conditions favourable to it. But in this regard the results\nare disappointing : doubtless because no markedly good agents\nor percipients revealed themselves, and there have not been\nenough successful results on which to base conclusions. The\nconditions which make for success must obviously be most\ndifficult to recognise where so many of the elements involved\nare psychological, unknown, or possibly even unknowable either\nat the time or afterwards.\nThe experimenters met at the Society's rooms some forty-two\ntimes from May 1923 to June 1925. The largest number\npresent on any one occasion was eight, and on manv occasions\nthere were only two present. Indeed at first and not infre-\nquently afterwards Miss Newton and I were the only experi-\nmenters.\nAs regards conditions\u2014at the beginning of the series the\nexperiments were all with \" contact.\" That is to say that\nwhen trying to transfer the chosen idea I put my hand on\nMiss Newton's or vice versa. This arose from my having a\ntradition at the time that contact had helped in other experi-\nments which I had done previously to these at the S.P.R.\nHowever, we soon came to think contact did not affect the\nsuccess or failure, and abandoned it. After this short series\n^ This paper was read at a private meeting uf the Society on February\n23, 1927. It was on that occasion illustrated by lantern slides.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, ii>27\nof contact experiments members of the Society willing to test\ntheir telepathic powers were invited to join in the experiments,\nand in all twenty-nine persons took part.\nAt almost every one of the forty-two meetings several experi-\nments were tried between would-be agents and percipients in\nthe same or, occasionally, adjoining rooms, and the whole\nnumber of such experiments amounted to over 350. Further,\nto get the number of telepathic impressions aimed at, each\nexperiment must be multiplied by the number of would-be\npercipients engaged in it, and this gives us some 625 experi-\nments. But this number is an understatement, because some\nof the cards on which the impressions were recorded have been\nlost, and others wasted because the percipients omitted to\nnumber and date them, and later, owing to an accident,\nthey were mixed up. We should probably be safe in\nestimating the number of impressions at about 675. As out of\nthese we only regard twenty-five as successes,^ and perhaps\nabout the same number as partial successes, it is clear that\ntelepathy did not manifest itself to any large extent. In\naddition to experiments with agents and percipients in the\nsame or adjoining rooms, twenty-four were made with agents\nand percipients in different parts of the country. These we\nwill deal with separately.\nWith regard to conditions : throughoiit the experiments an\neasy informality was aimed at, as it was thought that anything\nmore stiff and solemn might tend to inhibit the emergence of\ntelepathy. The experiments were in fact treated as in a sense\npreliminary, to be made more formal when the ideal agent and\npercipient or conditions were discovered. But, notwithstanding\nthe informality, pains were taken in placing the percipients and\nagents to make it impossible for the percipient to see any card\nor object held by the agent, and comjjlete silence was main-\n1 The line between successes and partial successes is a vague one, and\nwould probably be drawn differently by different people. For the impressions\nreckoned as successes are themselves never, except in one or two very simple\ncases, completely successful. They are in fact really only partial successes,\nas will be seen from examples quoted below. What we mean by \" success\n\"\nis merely agreement between impressions of agent and percipient greater\nthan one would expect to occur by chance, whereas our \" partial successes\n\"\nl^erhaps agree in a minor particular only.\n\fJune, 1927 Report of Experiments in Thought Transference 81\ntained when the agent had selected the subject intended to be\ntransferred. Only once (May 11, 1925) among the impressions\nreckoned as successful was there any fear that owing to their\nrelative positions the percipient might have seen the agent's\ncard. The agent, Prof, de G}ti, thought of a chair, and drew\none roughly on the card he held in his hand. The percipient\ndrew a chair in the same position as the agent's, but not other-\nwise resembling it, and she was not aware of having seen the\ndrawing, and there was absolutely no reason for supposing the\npercipient to have looked at the agent's drawing, but I remember\nwe thought at the time we had not been quite careful enough.\nAll the experimenters acted both as agents and percipients, and\nvariations were tried, such as all acting as agents except one\nas percipient, and of course the contrary, namely, one as agent\nand the rest as percipients. Experiments were tried on the\nplan of Professor Gilbert Murray's, though without success, and\nin other unsuccessful experiments the agent or agents were in\na different room from the percipients. A considerable variety\nof subjects in different classes were used for the attempted\ntransfers, viz. :\n(a) Picture postcards drawn from a large and varied stock,\nand other similar pictures looked at by the agent.\n(6) Actual objects looked at.\n(c) Scenes or objects mentally visualised.\n{d) Ideas of such things without intentional \\asualisation.\n{e) So-called diagrams looked at by agents, i.e. either mean-\ningless combinations of lines, or simple outline drawings,\nor shapes in coloured paper pasted on to cards (as\nexample, a green shamrock or a gold crown on a black\ncard), or single capital letters.\n{f) Numbers thought of.\n{g) Pla^nng cards.\n(h) A word or name.\n{i) Imagined sounds.\n(j) Imagined colours.\n(k) Imagined tastes.\n(?) Imagined emotions.\nThe percipient was as a rule told beforehand which of the\n-above classes the subject selected by the agent would belong to.\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1927\nTlie agents tried different plans at different times for trans-\nmitting the impression desired\u2014as e.g. gazing fixedly at it, or\nthinking hard about it, or on the other hand getting only a\ntransient glimpse of it, or after deciding and noting down what\nit was to be, not keeping the mind fixed on it at all. But, as\nalready said, the experimenters were not able to draw inferences\nof importance from the medley of results, though individual\nagents or percipients may perhaps have gathered some few\nhints for their own future use. There is one thing perhaps\nworth saying about pictures looked at by the agents\n(class (a) above). The number of experiments in trans-\nferring these pictures (mostly postcards) was fairly large\n\u2014\nabout 100 \u2014 and the number of impressions recorded by per-\ncipients of course much larger, there being often several\npercipients. Of these, 8 impressions have been counted as\nsuccessful. But it seems certain that in none of them was the\nimage of the postcard as seen by the percipient clear and\ndistinct. Examples will illustrate this. On January 11, 1924,\nthe agent. Mr. Duff, had before him a postcard photo-\ngraph of the \" Dying Gladiator.'' The percipients\u2014there\nwere four\u2014all knew that the agent was looking at a picture\npostcard, but the impressions of three of them were hopelessly\nwrong. The fourth was mine: I noted on my card, \"A grey\nand white card, an interior, I think of a grey stone effigy\nunder the light of a window, in a church perhaps. There is\nsomething still about it.\n\"\nNow an effigy is a recumbent\nstatue, and the \" Dying Gladiator \" is a nearly recumbent\nstatue. This is the only occasion in the w^hole series of\nexperiments when either an effigy or the Dying Gladiator or\nany other recumbent statue was thought of by an agent or\nreferred to by a percipient, and it is a curious coincidence if\nthey were associated by pure chance. Yet if I had clearly\nvisualized the picture 1 shoiild surely have recognised the\nstatue, which I know very well, and indeed must often have\ndrawn, and not referred to it vaguely as an effigy.\nAgain, on June \"27, 1923, I gave a fair though imperfect\ndescription as regards line, form, and light and shade of ^\na\npostcard photograph of palm-trees at Hyeres, but without\nhaving the slightest idea that it represented trees, etc., \" Some-\n\fJune, 1927 Report of Experiments in Thought Transference S3\nthing going ofi into perspective one beMnd the other, the dark\ncomes across at an angle with the Ught, black and white, no\ncolour above, something like fingers spread out.\"\" In the\npostcard the branches of the palm trees suggest spread-out\nfingers.\nIn another case January 26, 1925, Miss Newton as percipient\nappeared as it were to get fragments of the picture and\nfragments of interpretation. I was the agent, and had before\nme a postcard representing an \" Indian encampment, Ontario,\nCanada.\" Miss Newton wrote on her card, \" First thought,\nin a flash : something straight in the sea : a pier. Afterwards,\nwhen in a drowsy state, a shape like this . The form\nof the land in the picture easily suggests a pier projecting\ninto a lake, and the shape afterwards seen is like that of\nthe Indian tents.\nThe efforts to transfer scenes or objects mentally visualised\nor ideas of scenes or objects without deliberate visualisation\nwere together about the same in number as the actual pictures\nand about equally successful, or rather, unsuccessful. We may\nperhaps count 7 as successes. Here is one of January 18,\n1924. The agent. Miss Candler, wrote on her card, \" The Alps\nat sunset in thunderstorm seen from Jura. Blood red moun-\ntains against black sky, feeling of wrath of God.\" The\npercipient, who was myself, wrote : \"I imagine a volcano or\nsomething on fire\u2014dark foreground. I feel as if I was watching\na fire or earthquake or something where one would be a\nhelpless spectator\u2014a thunderstorm.\" It seems that except in\nthe fiery appearance the visual part of this impression was not\ntransferred, or at least we have no evidence that it was.\nWhat got through was the thunderstorm and the emotional\neffect. In the following case, again, on January 19, 1925, the\ngeneral idea in a complicated imagined event seems to have\ngot itself transferred with some idea of the locality. Miss\nBoucher James as agent thought of \"a fur coat, brown and\nwarm, trying on in the shop, sale-time, Derry & Toms.\"\" One\nof the percipients, Mrs. George, got \" Moving crowds of people,\nshops, noise (High Street, Kensington).\"\" The brackets indicate\nthat Mrs. George did not mention her impression of High\nStreet, Kensington, which is where Derry & Toms' shop is\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1927\nsituated, till after slie had been told what the subject was.\nIt will be noticed that it was only the last part of the agent's\nidea which was connected with the percipient's.\nA visualised subject of a different character was the following.\nMiss Button, as agent, on February 25, 1924. thought of \" a\nlarge white cat with green eyes, purring,\"\" and drew in pencil\non her card a rough sketch of such a cat facing the spectator.\nMiss Newton, as percipient, wrote down, \" A Box, a block of\ngranite. Cushion. Then a light gleaming between the fork of\na tree in the garden [Tavistock Square] reminds me of the\nCheshire cat, and I think of a cat on a cushion, its paws\nturned in.\" I myself, who was another of the percipients,\nwrote down, \" an animal, a cat with its back to you. I\nimagine Miss Dutton is thinking of something at home.\"\nFrom this we may pass to the experiments in which agent\nand percipient were in different counties. During the week\nfollowing the cat experiment Miss Dutton returned to her home\nin Devonshire, and it was arranged that at a fixed hour on\nMarch 3, 1924, she should try from there to impress the\nexperimenters in Tavistock Square. She gazed at \" a brass\nbell bright gold where light touches, dark shadows in the\nunder-cutting. Ringing, rmging, ringing. Yet it is not really\na bell, but an inkstand and dire accidents have happened\nwith ink from attempts to ring it. I hope you get it.\" Miss\nDutton posted the same day a rough sketch of the bell in-\ndicating the embossed pattern on it. Miss Newton, a percipient,\nwrote, \" Sudden '\nDing dong bell, pussy's in the well,' \" and\nafterwards annotated this :\n\" There was nothing in my mind\nto account for the sudden intrusion of '\nDing dong bell,\nPussy's in the well.' The well reminded me of the green and\nwell at L and I added [this as] the second impression.\"\nThat she should have had for the only time in the series an\nimpression of a ringing bell when the agent was trying to\nsuggest a bell was certainly remarkable.\nIn all some 24 experiments were made either to receive\nimpressions from Miss Dutton from Devonshire or to transmit\nthem to her, or to the Misses Tipping ^ at Leamington. But\n^ It will be remembered that telepathic experiments by the Misses Tipping\nsome years ago have been published in Proceedings, vol. xxvii. pp. A\\5A51n.\n\fJune, 1927 Report on Experiments in Thought Travsferencc So\nthere was no furtiier success, unless we count as such an\nimpression of \"a brilliant red square \" received (among others)\nby INIiss L. Tipping on Nov. 3, 1924, when several agents at\nTavistock Square were trving to transmit the idea. \" a gas\nfii-e.\"' The percipient's description is correct, though inadequate,\nof the kind of gas fire in the room where the agents were\nsitting. One curious thing happened, however, in the course\nof these \" distant \" experiments. On November 10. 1921:,\nMiss Newton and four others sitting in Miss Newton's\nroom at 31 Ta\\astock Square, were trying to transmit to the\nJ\\Iisses Tipping at Leamington a picture of a Russian peasant\nwoman. The picture was not transferred, but among im-\npressions recorded by Miss Tipping appeared a bowl with\ngold fish in it, very lit up so that the fish appear very\nbright.\" Miss Newton recorded when she received Miss\nTipping's note that during the experiment on November 10,\nshe had looked up at the hanging electric light bowl which was\nlit up in her room,^ and had a momentary vision of very red\ngold fish swimming about in it.\"' \"Again, seeing the bowl\nreflected in the looking glass over the mantelpiece I thought\nof it as a bowl of gold fish several times during the experi-\nments. The idea occurred to me [and] I could not get rid of\nit. I do not remember ever having thought of gold fish in\nconnection with this electric fitting before, nor do I know of\nanything that might have led me to think of a bowl of gold\nfish that day.\" This note was unfortunately not made at the\ntime because the recurrent impression seemed irrelevant to the\nexperiment in hand, irrelevant to the pictilre Miss Newton and\nthe agents were trying to transfer. Were Miss Newton's and\nMiss L. Tipping's impression of goldfish telepathicaUy connected,\nor were they not ? And if they were, with which did the\nimpression originate ? The fact that Mrs. Leonard's Feda has\napparently shown telepathic knowledge of thoughts of Miss\nNewton's certainly not intentionally transferred (see Proceedings,\nVol. XXXVI, pp. 192 j^.) suggests that another sensitive (Miss\nTipping) may have had similar access to her mind. On the\nother hand the peculiar nature of Miss Newton's impression\nThe fitting is a round alabaster bowl, hangina under the lamp, nhk-h it\n\u2022conceals.\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1927\non this occasion suggests some origin outside. The coincidence\nmay, of course, be accidental ; but if so, it is an odd\none.\nThere are instances in this series of experiments when ideas\nwhich had earlier been in the agent's mind, but which she\nhad no intention of transmitting, occurred to the percipient.\nThus on December 15, 1924, I myself as agent visualised \" a\nfat woman talking fast (the cook I had just been interviewing).\"\nMrs. Enthoven, one of the percipients, said, \" Candied slices\nof orange, a grocer's shop, large. I saw mentally Miss Jephson\nin a grocer's shop thoroughly enjoying her inspection of good\nthings.\" On this I annotated, \" I had just been in a grocer's\nshop, and as a matter of fact I had specially noticed the grocer\nas he was such a gloriously typical one.'\" Again, on November\n30, 1923, the agent, Miss Boucher James, thought of \" Biskra\nand the palm trees. The endless reach of the desert, the\n[distant] mountains. The slow roll of the camels. I centre on\nthe palms and the mountains in the distance.\"' Miss Newton\nas one of the percipients said, \" A very high cliff by the sea\nseen from the top. Measles.\" She said she noted the last\nword because she \" could find no association with it.\"\" The\nagent then said she had received a letter the night before\nfrom an old servant, who was just about to come and look\nafter her for a time, saying she couldn't come as her little boy\nhad measles, and [this] had been in her mind all the morning.\nAnother form of an earlier idea obtruding itself occurred\nwhen a card looked at by the agent, but rejected in favour of\nanother for the purpose of the experiment, prevailed over the\nselected one. This appeared to happen on one or two occasions,\nthough it was not quite certain.\nHeaders of this report will, I think, admit that some\ninteresting and at any rate suggestive correspondences occurred\nin the course of the experiments, and that there may have\nbeen some telepathy at work. But the very large proportion\nof failures makes it impossible to feel sure that the suc-\ncesses or most of them may not have been due to chance.\nIt is clear that there were no strikingly good combinations of\nagents and percipients among the experimenters.\nAs a contrast I will give a short series which occurred a\n\fJlne, 19i'7 Report on E'xperiment'^ in Thought Transference 8\/\nyear after the experiments I have been describing ended, bnt\nwhich in spite of its promise also ended disappointingly.\nA Miss S., who had lately become interested in the work of\nthe Society, called on Miss Newton on June 24. 1926, and they\nagreed to try for thought transference then and there. Miss\nNewton (agent throughout) sat behind Miss S. (percipient)\nwithout contact and recorded each experiment as it occurred.\nThere were twelve. In the first two the agent drew simple\ndiagrams.\"' The percipient had no impressions.\nExperiment 3. Agent says, \" Now I will think of some actual\nthing I have seen,\" and notes \" Russian Ballet.\" 3Iiss S.\nspeaks at once, \" Russian Ballet.\"\" The percipient had not\nseen it this season.\nExperiment 4. Agent writes, \" A summer house in a garden.\"\nPercipient says \"Flower Show.\"\" Agent asks, \"What do you\nsee ?\n'\"'\nThe percipient says, \" Flowers. . . . Garden of Flowers.\"'\nExperiment 5. Agent writes, \" Italian blue sky, simshine,\noranges growing up the side of a pergola, blue sea showing\nthrough.\"' Percipient says, \" Sea and blue sky.\" Agent asks,\n\"What else?\" Percipient, \"Boat.\"\" Agent, \" What country ?\n\"\nPercipient, \" Italy.\" Agent, \" Anything else ?\n\"\"\nPercipient,\n\" Gentians ? Vines ? Olives ? [Evidently guessing].\"'\nExjJeriment 6. Agent looks at postcard portrait of Edmund\nBurke. Percipient has no impression.\nExperiment la. Agent says, \" I will think of a number,'\"\nand notes \"27.\" Percipient says quickly \"27.\"\"\nExperiment lb. Agent thinks of 8, and a cipher slips into\nher mind causing confusion. She writes 08. Percipient says\n\"58.\"\nExperiment 8. Agent says, \" I will think of three numbers,\"\"\nand notes \" 157.\"\" Percipient says \" 123.\"\"\nExperiment 9. Agent says, \" I will think of a letter of the\nalphabet,\" and notes \"M.\" Percipient says quickly. \"M.\n\"\nExperiments 10, 11, 12. Agent records \"Three other experi-\nments were tried. Percipient '\nguessed '\neach time and was\nwrong.\"'\nPossibly fatigue may account for these last three failures,\nbut however this may be, the success of the series was brilliant\nas thought transference experiments go, and considerable hopes\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research .tlnk, i;i27\nwere founded on it. Unfortunately, however, a further attempt\nwas a complete failure ; we cannot tell why. But it may be\nnoted that a third person was present and the conditions were\nformal. Miss S. is sensitive and diffident about her jjowers,\nand was doubtless nervous, and this may have prevented her\nconsciously apprehending telepathic impressions. And the same\ncauses may have operated in the agent and prevented trans-\nmission. There has unfortunately been no further opportunity\nof experimenting with Miss iS., but she has recently agreed to\ncome and try again with Miss Newton, and I am hoping also\nto try some experiments with her privately.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning Lord Dunraven's Sittings with D. D. Home.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMarch 18, 1927.\nDear Madam,\u2014I am much obliged to E.J.D. for his review of\nmy paper in Zeitschrift fur Kritischen OkkuUismus on the late\nLord Dunraven's sittings with D. D. Home.^\nI do not think, however, he is right when he states that \" it\nis clear that the Count finds himself in considerable difficulties\nwhen he tries to devise normal explanations for the phenomena.\"\nOn the contrary, for the majority of these phenomena at any rate,\nI find no difficulties in such an hypothesis after reading the\nDunraven account. For that account shows us that D. D. Home\nwas practically at liberty to act as he liked, moving freely about\nthe room and even leaving the room ; it shows us that the\neye-witnesses attached to absolutely non-evidential if [not absurd ^\ntrance-addresses the same importance as to conclusive phenomena ;\nit shows also that in the great majority of cases, practically\nprecautions were taken against trickery. It gives us the perfectly\nlegitimate right to conclude that in some cases ^ Home could have\nintroduced a confederate without much difficulty. In short, the\ngreat value of Lord Dunraven's \" Experiences in Spiritualism\n\"\nlies in the fact, that they j^rove to us quite conclusively that in\n1 S.P.R. Jour., March, 1927, p. 46. ^ Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXV., pp. 144, 158.\n''I have in particular in view such seances as those of February 9, 1869,\nand July 7, 1869 {op. cit. pp. 173, 278).\n\fJuxE, 1927 Correspondence 89\nnineteen cases out of twenty, Home could have cheated if he had\nwished to. And since there is every reason to suppose that Home's\nother seances were not different in quality from those described\nby Lord Dunraven, the same contention will hold good for the\nwhole of Home's performances.\nFrom this point of view Lord Dunraven's notes and letters\ndeal Home's reputation as a powerful physical medium, in my\nopinion, a heavy blow. He appears to us as controlling and\ndirecting the sittings ;\nprecautions against fraud are either non-\nexistent practically, or obviously inadequate ; omissions appear in\nthe accounts which prove that the observers had no idea of the\nconditions required to make an experiment even relatively con-\nvincing, etc. Under these circumstances the great bulk of D. D.\nHome's phenomena must be thrown overboard. For surely we\ncannot make their genuineness depend on the assumption that\nHome did not ivish to cheat.\nA certain residuum of phenomena, not easily explicable, will\nremain. But, though in their case I have no ready explanation\nto offer, they seem to me somewhat vitiated by their association,\nwith so many other \" manifestations \" of which the explanation\nmay well lie on the surface.\nAs for the sitters, I am beginning to think that much delusion\nin this region is due to them. There are many sitters whose\nshare in complicating the problem is inferior only to that of the\nmedium himself ! I hasten to add, that I certainly do not think\nthat the late Lord Dunraven was such a one. But his account,\ncandid as it is, presents us with such a picture of the conditions\nprevailing at Home's seances, that the evidential value of even\nsome of the most striking of the great medium's phenomena must,\nin my opinion, be considerably discounted.\nI do not pretend to explain all the recorded j^erformances of\nD. D. Home. For my purpose it is sufficient to point out\nthat the ijreat itiujority can he explained away in a normal way\nirithout tJie least difficulty. And here we are undoubtedly much\nindebted to Lord Dunraven's transparently honest accounts and\nto the light they throw :\na. On D. D. Home's behaviour\n;\nh. On the mentality of the persons present.\nI am.

By\nE. N. Bennett, M.A., late Fellow of Hertford College, Oxford.\nLondon : Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co. ; New York :\nE. P. Button & Co. Pp. 9.5.\nIt is entirely proper that the entertaining pamphlets on the live\ntopics of the day called the To-day and To-morrow series should\ninclude also one on Psychical Research, and it is fortunate that\nso experienced, enterprising and com^^etent a psychical researcher\nas Mr. E. N. Bennett should have undertaken to write it. I)i\nApoUonius he casts a rapid but intelligent coup d'oeil over the\npresent status of psychical affairs, which is necessarily stripped\nof detail, and perhaj^s in places somewhat subjectively coloured\nby his political interests, but is always stimulating and never dull.\nIt will be read with interest, and his readers will regret only that\nMr. Bennett has not added a short bibliography of what he\nconsiders the most significant psychical literature of the day.\nThe points of interest in Mr. Bennett's survey to which I\nmyself would draw special attention are, in the first place, the\nstress laid on Avhat he calls megalomania, i.e. the desire to appear\nimportant, as a cause of fraud and misstatement in ^^sychics who\nhave no other obvious motive to deceive. He more than hints\nthat this may account for the cases of Stainton Moses (p. 24)\nand Gilbert Murray (p. 48), and though I cannot associate myself\nwith the severity of this view, it can hardly be denied that it\nreflects seriously on any person and any Society which allows the\nevidence for any alleged supernormal happening to remain less\ngood than it might easily be made. Secondly, I would note Mr.\nBennett's robust faith in the proof of telepathy by the founders\nof the S.P.R. (p. 45), even though he admits that \" our facts\nsoon become more or less obsolete \" and advocates the collection\nof \" fresh data.\" He hardly quite realises, perhaps, that no\nscientific truth rests securely on merely historical evidence, and\nthat science always aims at control of the conditions and con-\nsequent power to multiply the evidence at will. Tliirdly, he\ninclines to regard telepathy as \" a dying sense \" (p. 53) which\nfunctions more freely in animal life. I can see no advantage in\nthis supposition : it only makes its investigation more difficult,\n\fJune, 1927 Revieivs 91\nwithout rendering it really more acceptable to the prejudices of\nscientific materialism. Fourthly, he hardly appreciates sufficiently\nthe need for the provision of adequate funds (pp. 48-9). Psychical\nResearch has now reached a stage of development when large\nendowments are needed not only for laboratories and the continuous\nexamination of sensitives, but also to render the position of Re-\nsearch Officer of a Psychical Society such that men of first-rate\nability will feel justified in adopting it as a profession. Fifthly,\nthe wording of Mr. Bennett's reference (pp. 89-90) to my Report\n{in Pioc. S.P.R., Vol. XVIII., p. 416) on the Questionnaire on Human\nSentiment about the Future Life is a little misleading. The \" 78\u00b0 o\n\"\nwho denied that they desired a future life \" whatever the conditions\nmight be \" were only [preferring annihilation to hell, and had mostly\nanswered an earlier question in the affirmative : the indifferents\nwho were not troubled about their future life were answering a\nquestion as to whether it was actually essential to their mental\ncomfort. And the conclusion I ventured to draw from the evidence\nwas not that the belief in a future life was dying out, but rather\nthat it had always been a \" half-belief,\" conventionally accepted,\nbut needing the stimulus of personal bereavement to become\nreally jjoignant (cf. Problems of Belief, ch. v.). It seems to me\nas certain as anything can be in human psychology that if the\nChurches now drop their dogma of immortality, with which they\nhave never been as earnest as they seemed, an appreciable fraction\nof mankind will always seek (more or less enduring) satisfaction\nin the seance -room. Lastly, Mr. Bennett has allowed his printer's\ndevil to misspell Sir W. Crookes's name on pp. 45 and 80, though\nhe gets it right on p. 18. Count v. Klinckowstroem is misspelt\non p. 79, and a letter has dropped out on p. 87.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nn.\n\u2022Clairvoyance and Materialisation : a Record of Experiments. By\nGusTAVE Geley.

Beside\nthe fireplace was an armchair, where my cousin usually sat\nwhen she was with me. Suddenly that chair was illuminated\nby a light so intensely bright that it actually seemed to\nheave under it, though the remainder of the room remained\nin semi-darkness.

A Death Coincidence.\nWe print below a report of what appears to be an impression\nreceived by the percipient at the time of the agent's death.\nThe case has come to us through Sir Oliver Lodge, to whom\nthe percipient, Mr. A. F. Henderson, wrote in the first\ninstance. The difficulty in cases such as this, in which\nthe percipient hears only a noise, or a \" non-vocal sound-\nphantasm,\" is to determine to what extent we are justified in\nregarding the impression as causally connected with the event\nwith which it is afterwards associated, to determine, in fact,\nwhether the case is supernormal at all. What makes the\npresent case worth putting on record is the exact coincidence in\ntime between Mr. Henderson's impression and the death of his\nfriend. This type of evidence is discussed, and one or two\nsimilar cases are quoted in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II.,\npp. 125 fi. Two similar cases, originally printed in our own\nJournal, are also quoted by Mrs. Sidgwick in her paper on\n\"Phantasms of the Living,\" Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIII.,\npp. 211-243. In these two cases there was also a close\ncoincidence in time.\nThe original report of his experience was sent by the per-\ncipient, Mr. Henderson, to Sir Oliver Lodge. Mr. Henderson\nwrote thus :\n79 Pall Mall, S.W. 1,\nnth March, 1927.\nDear Sie,\nIt has been suggested to me that the happening which\nI shall relate may be of interest to you.\n\fJuly, 1927 Case 95\nThe following is a perfectly authentic record of an experience\nthat I had in the early hours of January 9th ^ last.\nOn Sunday the 8th January my family and myself retired at\n10.45 p.m. I was awakened by loud and continued knockings,\nsuch as might have been caused by the rattling or banging of\nwindows or doors. So persistent were these noises that I got up,\nbut finding the disturbance could not have been so caused, I went\nto my wife's room\u2014which is immediately over mine\u2014thinking that\nshe might have called me by knocking on the floor. I was led to\nthis thought because she had recently been far from well. I was\nrelieved to find her sleeping ; she was, however, awakened l)y my\nopening the door, and after being assured that all was well,\nI returned to my room. Before going to bed I looked at my\nwatch and foimd the time was 4.15 a.m.\nI must now recount how the above occurrence is significant of\nsomething supernatural.\n5Iy dear old friend, Professor W. L. Barrett\u2014in his day a\ncelebrated flautist\u2014had been very ill for some time. He was to\nhave been the guest of the Savage Club House Dinner on\nSaturday the 15th January in celebration of his fiftieth year of\nmembership and of his eightieth birthday.\nOn the previous Saturday, in spite of friendly warnings, he\ninsisted on going to his beloved Club, but during the evening\nbecame so ill that he was taken by two of the Members to a\nNursing Home the same night. I was advised of this on the\nfollowing day\u2014Sunday the 9th\u2014and, of course, determined to visit\nthe Home on the following day. I was there at 9.30 a.m. and\nwas informed that my friend had passed away during the night.\nAt the time I did not connect this with what had occurred to\nme at home, but on my telling my wife that \" Billie \" had died,\nshe reminded me of what had happened and asked me to ascertain,\nif possible, at what time our friend had passed away. At the\nmoment when we were discussing this matter Mr. Barrett's nephew\nrang me up on a matter connected with his uncle's death ; on\nBy a clerical error, corrected by Mr. Henderson in a later letter to Sir\nOliver Lodge, the dates given here are \" January 9th \" and Sunday the 8th\nJanuary.\" Sunday was in fact the 9th of January, and Mr. Henderson's\nexperience occurred in the early hours of the 10th. The date \" Sunday the\n9th \" is correctly given in a later paragraph of Mr. Henderson's letter of\nMarch 17th, and the date of his experience, .January 10th, is confirmed by\nMrs. Henderson's statement (see below).\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1927\nmy asking him if he knew the time he died, he told me that he\nbreathed his last at 4.10 a.m.\u2014the exact minute that I was\nawakened as I have described.\nMy wife, knowing of the deep friendship that existed between\nBarrett and myself, is convinced that at the time of passing he\nmust have been thinking of me. Who knows ? I hope it may\nbe so, and I should like to have such belief strengthened.\nMay I venture to ask you to express your views on this\nexperience ? I shall be most grateful to you.\nYours faithfully,\nA. F. Henderson.\nIn reply to this letter Sir Oliver Lodge wrote thus to Mr.\nHenderson :\nmh March, 1927.\nThe time coincidence in your report, if it can be thoroughly\nsubstantiated, is certainly remarkable, and would seem to be\nbeyond chance coincidence. Occurrences like this have happened\nbefore, and I see no reason to doubt that there is some causal\nconnexion between the death and the knockings, but as to how\nsuch physical manifestations are brought about, we are in the\ndark. It would seem unlikely that it can be the immediate\nactivity of the departed person. At the same time there does\nseem to be a certain amount of psychic activity or energy\nliberated at the moment of death, which sometimes takes a form\nakin to this. ...

I fully\nunderstand and appreciate the fact that the statements made in\nmy letter to you must be thoroughly substantiated and corroborated.\nIn so far as I have described the happening, my wife will\ncorroborate the facts set out in my letter to you. I spoke to her\nlast night again on this subject and she tells me that after I had left\nher room she herself looked at her clock and fixed the exact time.\nFor the rest, I am attaching hereto copies of letters I am\nwriting to :\n(1) the Nursing Home where my friend died ;\n(2) to Mr. Barrett's nephew. . . .\nA. F.

L. Barrett, died in your Nursing Home between\nSunday the 9th January and Monday morning the 10th. No\ndoubt you have a record of the exact hour and minute that my\nfriend passed away.\nI should be most grateful to you if you would let me know the\nexact time he died.\nI will later give you my reason for making this request.\n(6) Letter to Mr. H. T. Barrett.\n22nd March, 1927.\nYou will recollect that I had a remarkable experience in con-\nnection with your late uncle's death. You will also remember\nthat when you telephoned to me on Monday evening the 10th\nJanuary last you informed me that he passed away at 4.10 a.m.\nand that you obtained this information from the Nursing Home.\nI should be very much obhged to you if you would kindly\nconfirm this.\nI will later give you my reason for making this request.\nOn April 1st, 1927, Mr. Henderson wrote again to Sir Oliver\nLodge, enclosing the following letters received by him from the\nMatron of the Nursing Home and Mr. H. T. Barrett\n:\n(a) Letter from the Matron.\nMarcl 2ith, 1927.\nIte Mr. Barrett, who died in my Home on the 10th Jan. 1927.\nI was very ill at the time with asthma and bronchitis, and for\nsix weeks did not make my books up. When I did do so I put\nMr. Barrett admitted on the 9th Jan.\u2014died on the 10th between\n4 and 5.\nThe Night Nurse who was with him when he died said as far\nas she can remember it was between 4 to 4.30. So that if she\ntold Mr. Barrett's nephew it was 4.10 a.m., that would be correct.\nNurse D. W .\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1927\n(b) Letter from Mr. H. T. Barrett.\n3lst March, 1927.\nMy Dear Henderson,\nI am sorry for the delay in writing you the specific\ninformation as to the time of my late uncle's death, but I was\nanxious to confirm my own recollection of the time, so that there\nshould be no doubt as to the accuracy of the information.\nI was informed on the telephone of his illness on the afternoon\nof Sunday, January 9th, and I telephoned the Nursing Home on\nthe same evening, when I was informed that he was comfortable\nand apparently in no immediate danger, giving them my telephone\nnumber to advise me of any change. Very early on Monday,\nJanuary 10th, the Matron rang me up saying that he had taken a\nchange for the worse and they were afraid he would not live the\nnight. I informed her that I would enquire how I could possibly\nget through by motoring to York, Leeds or elsewhere, and would\nring her up later. I did this at 4.20 a.m. and was informed that\nthe old gentleman had been dead ten minutes, death taking place\nat 4.10 a.m.\nH. T. Barrett.\nThe following confirmatory statement was also received from\nMrs. Henderson :\nApril 3rd, 1927.\nMy husband has told me he has been, and is, in correspondence\nwith you in regard to his experience in connection with the death\nof our dear old friend, Mr. W. L. Barrett.\nThe circumstances are clearly within my recollection, and are\nbriefly as follows :\nIn the early hours of Monday, Jan. 10th, my husband came\ninto my room appearing very much disturbed. He told me that\nhe had been awakened by noises which he thought might have\nbeen made by me to call him ; I assured him that all was well\nwith me. After he left the room and before turning off the light\nI noticed the time was 4.15.\nOn Monday morning, Jan. 10th, my husband called at the\nNursing Home where Mr. Barrett had been taken, and then and\nthere found that our friend had passed away. On the same\nevening Mr. Barrett's nephew telephoned to my husband whilst\nI was sitting by his side ; I prompted my husband to ascertain\n\fJuly, 1927 Case 99\nif possible whether Mr Barrett's nephew happened to know about\nwhat time his uncle died ; it occurred to me to make this request\nbecause I associated my husband's experience with the passing of\nour friend, and he (Mr. Barrett's nephew) told my husband that\nhe had been informed over the telephone that the hour was\n4.10 a.m. This convinced me that there must have been some\npsychic influence to account for his experience.\nKate Hexderson.\nOn April 5th, 1927, Mrs. Salter wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge\nasking whether any e\\Tidence was available as to whether the\nsounds heard by Mr. Henderson were objective or subjective.\nTo this enquiry Mr. Henderson replied thus :\n4f\/t Ajyril, 1927.\nI thank you for your letter of the 28th ultimo and have care-\nfully perused the communication you received from the Editor of\nthe Jouryml of the S.P.R., and in reply to this would say that I\nhad already anticipated the query. Neither my wife nor servants\nheard any kind of disturbance during the night. . . .\nA. F. Henderson.\nTWO CASES OF INDUCED AUDITORY HALLUCINATION.\nBy Ct. H. Estabrooks, Ph.D.\nThe two following cases seem of interest to the writer since he\nhad the chance of studying them at first hand. They demon-\nstrate very neatly several points in the genesis of hallucination,\nand one offers an example par excellence of spiritistic\n\" rappings.\" Indeed, if it were not for the fact that its\norigin was perfectly certain, the writer would probably have been\nwilling to swear that it was a genuine case of psychic phenomena.\nAfter completing his B.A. work and previous to going across\nthe water on a Rhodes Scholarship, the writer had a break-\ndown in health. This was due to a recurrence of lung trouble\ncaused by gassing and necessitated a year in sanatoriiun.\nWhile there he experimented on auto-suggestion, and the two\nfollowing cases are examples ending a series of induced\nhallucinations.\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1927\nHe found that he could put himself to sleep by counting,\nand that suggestions made to himself during this process were\nfairly successful. Most of these suggestions were of a thera-\npeutic nature, the two reported on here being included in a\nnumber of exceptions.\nIt was found that suggestions given in the afternoon would\ntend to be realized that night. This seemed the most favour-\nable combination. Accordingly the writer suggested to himself\none afternoon that he would wake up that night at 2 a.m. and\nwould hear an orchestra playing. He went to sleep at once\nafter this suggestion had been given, recalled it clearly on\nwaking for dinner, and had it in mind all the evening until\ngoing to sleep for the night.\nThe suggestion worked very well. The writer awoke at\napproximately 2.00 a.m., and was at first puzzled to hear an\norchestra playing. He shortly realized it as the result of his\nsuggestion and lay quietly listening to results. The music\ncontinued for a minute or two, and then changed quite\nsuddenly into the rattling of the sanatorium windows. There\nwas a considerable breeze on and the rattling of the windows\ntogether with the howling of the wind had combined to form\nthe point of departure for this very vivid hallucination.\nThe second case is, however, of more interest. The following\nafternoon the writer suggested to himself that he should hear\nspiritistic rappings the following night at 2.00 a.m. Again he\nwent to sleep while making the suggestion, and recalled them\nperfectly after awaking for dinner and up to the time of going\nto sleep finally for the night, at about 10.00 p.m.\nThat night he again awoke at about 2.00 a.m. He very\ndistinct!}' heard a series of \" raps,\" which sounded much the\nsame as if one were drawing a blacksmith's rasp sharply over\na piece of wood every two or three seconds. The writer at\nonce realized the origin of the raps. They were very clear and\nvery persistent.\nHe made a \" mentaj request \" that they group themselves in\nthrees. They did so. They then grouped themselves in two's\nagain on request, and suddenly stopped after continuing for\nabout two minutes.\nIn the case of this hallucination there was another very\n\fJuly, 1927 Ttvo Cases of Induced Auditory Hallucination. 101\ninteresting point. At each rap there was the sensation of a\nsharp, light blow on the back of the right hand below the base\nof the little finger. This hand was under the bedclothes.\nImmediately after the cessation of the \" raps \" it was noticed\nthat the muscle at the base of the little finger was twitching\nin that irritating way in which muscles will twitch when one\nis a little overwrought.\nWithout doubt the last of these two hallucinations illustrates\nthe genesis of many reports of spiritistic phenomena. No\ndoubt there are a great many people more susceptible to\ninduced hallucinations of this type than is the writer. Auto-\nsuggestion, used of course unwittingly, would produce results in\nthese folk far more ostentatious than those herein reported.\nSo far as \" subjective certainty \" was concerned, the writer\nis positive he heard those raps, felt them on his hand, and was\nable to exercise mental control over them. Anyone not\nfamiliar with their genesis would have been totally deceived.\nAs M'Curdy points out, it is this confusion of \" subjective\ncertainty with objective reality \" that marks the mystic.\nHere we have a demonstration of at least one way in which\nthis confusion could very easily arise. g.

This is the first number\nof a publication issued (in German) by the S.P.R. of Riga, and\nis edited by Prof. D. C. Blacher of the University. To judge by\nthe contents there is considerable interest in psychical research in\nLatvia, and the claim is made that in a Mr. F. (called \" Paleas \")\nRiga possesses one of the strongest of existing mediums.\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie (formerly Psychische Studien), Mar.\n1927, continues Herr Krall's (the owner of the Blberfeld horses)\ninteresting study of telepathic transference of orders from human\nto animal minds, illustrating his contention by experiments of\nvon Osten's with \" clever Hans \" and of himself with Muhamed \"\nand \" Zarif.\" Nevertheless he maintains that his horses were\ncapable of independent thought and usually answered by that.\nR. Lambert has a long and critical review of the \" Margery \"\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1927\ncase, dealing with the accounts of Houdini, Bird, Prince, Hoagland\nand Ehine, and to be continued in the next number. Prof.\nF. Heiler has an article maintaining the genuineness of the Sadhu\nSundar Singh and the authenticity of the wonders related about\nhim, while Prof. Oesterreich of Tubingen reviews both his book\nand Dr. 0. Pfister's, which comes to the opposite conclusion.\nThere is also a discussion of an article in the Berlin Tageblatt by\nDr. Rosenbusch accusing Eleonora Zugun of fraud and Countess\nWassilko of being her accomplice, together with a protest by six\nViennese professors repudiating this charge.\nZeitschrift fiir Kritischen Okkultisnms, Vol. II., Part 2, has an\narticle on Nostradamus by Count v. Klinckowstroem, who also\nwrites a short article to explain how he has become more critical.\nDr. R. Baerwald writes on K. Krall's articles in the Z. fur\nParapsycholo(jie, June and July, 1926, directed against the \" in-\nvoluntary whispering \" theory of telepathy propounded by Lehmann\nand Hansen. Krall, as the result of elaborate experiments, has\nbeen unable to verify Lehmann's and Hansen's results, and\nsuggests that their whispering was by no means \" involuntary,\" a\nj)oint which occurred also to me in reviewing Lehmann's Aher-\nglaube unci Zauberei in 1900 (Proceedings, Pt. 38). Dr. Baerwald\ndisputes Krall's results on the ground that he has not reckoned\nwith the almost illimitable hyperaesthesia of the unconscious,\" and\nthat it is improper to question the results of such eminent pro-\nfessors, and finally accuses him of being on the way to paranoia.\nCount Perovsky Petrovo Solovovo criticises Lord Dunraven's book\non D. D. Home, and R. Herring considerably damages Sweden-\nborg's reputation as a psychic. It appears (1) that the ghost of\nM. de Marteville did not inform Swedenborg where the lost receipt\nwas to be found, but excused himself on the ground that he had\nto inform his wife, who accordingly dreamt in the same night\nwhere the missing document was to be found. The revised\nversion of the incident rests on a recently discovered letter written\nby a Danish general who subsequently married the lady. (2)\nSwedenborg's revelation to the Queen of Sweden is discredited\nby the conflicts in the accounts and the lack of authentic reports.\n(3) His clairvoyant vision of the fire in Stockholm is discounted by\nthe fact that there was no considerable fire at either of the dates\nalleged, and rests practically on Swedenborg's own assertion.\nF.

By Paul Bousfield, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.,\nand W. R. Bousfield, K.C., F.R.S. London : Paul Trench,\nTrubner & Co., Ltd. 1927. Pp. 224. Price, 9s.\nThis book is, as its title-page shows, a book on Psychology, and\nit only incidentally touches on Psychical Research. The object of\nthe writers is to expound a hypothesis\u2014purely a hypothesis at\npresent\u2014which may help to bridge the gap between brain and\nmind.\nThe brain receives impressions through the senses, but there is\nno evidence, physiological or other, of any mechanism in the\nmaterial brain to integrate the various sensations into meaning or\nsynthesize them with the results of past experience. For these\npurposes a psychic structure of some sort must exist, whether\nmental or physical. The authors of this book suggest that the\nstructure may be a real structure in the ether and therefore phy-\nsical, though so fine that its elements are even more imperceptible\nto us than the electrons and protons of which matter is now\nbelieved to be composed, and therefore they consider, not material.\nThis structure may, they suggest, be a necessary part of every\nliving cell, through the whole scale of living organisms, and in\nman we may describe it as a \" psychic brain.\"\nThe psychic brain is conceived as consisting of at least two\ndepartments : one the retentive department, or mnema, in which all\npsychic dispositions are recorded and from which their resultants\nemerge from time to time ; and the other the active department,\nor exchange, to which sensory impressions are communicated and\npassed on to consciousness together with mnemic impressions.\nThe exchange must also act in the reverse direction, transmitting\nmotor ideas from the consciousness to the material brain, analysed\ninto the form in which they can be carried out through the\nmuscles into action.\nIt is to consciousness that belong the emotions and the exercise\nof judgment on the ideas presented to it.\nRegarding material brain and psychic brain as both structures\nin the ether, communication may be conceived as taking place\nbetween them by means of etheric waves affecting the exchange.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jily, 1927\nIn other words, the writers hold that it is in substance telepathic,\"\nand infer that \" the exchange must be regarded as the organ for\ntelepathic reception \"\n(p. 195). About the reality of telepathy they\nhave no doubts, and the forms in which telepathic ideas are trans-\nmitted and conditions favourable to their reception are briefly\ndiscussed in a chapter on the subject. The writers are not un-\naware that \" if telepathy is produced by radiant ether waves \" a\ndifficulty arises from the fact that these waves \" do not appear\nto conform to the law that the intensity of the effect should vary\nwith the inverse square of the distance \"\n(p. 188), but they trust\nto further experiments solving this and other puzzles.\nIf ideas are transmitted from the material brain to the psychic\nbrain by means of etheric vibrations, we may ask how they get\nfrom the psychic brain to consciousness and vice versa. About this\nthe authors say very little, but what they do say rather suggests\nthat they conceive consciousness itself as etherial. \"Possibly,\"\nthey say (p. 103), \" ideas from the mnema and the exchange are\nconveyed to consciousness by etheric waves, but it seems more\nprobable that we must regard both the mnema and the exchange\nas open to or merging into consciousness. Here, however, we are\nup against something which seems at present outside the range of\nrationalization.\" E. M. S.\nII. The Case For and Against Psychical Belief. By Sir Oliver\nLodge, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Frederick Bligh Bond,\nL. R. G. Crandon, Mary Austin, Margaret Deland,\nWilliam McDougall, Hans Driesch, Walter Franklin\nPrince, F. C. S.

Worcester, Mass. : Clark University. 1927.\nPrice, $3.75.\nWe very sincerely congratulate the President and Trustees of\nClark University on the courage and scientific enterprise they have\nshown in having assented to the delivery, under their auspices, of\nthis first course of lectures on psychical research to be officially\ngiven in a University : a priority, we venture to say, that should\nhave been claimed by one or two other American Universities very\nliberally endowed for such a purpose.\n\fJuly, 1927 Reviews 105\nWe regret, however, that more thought and care were not de-\nvoted to the preparation, first, of the course itself, and now of\nthe book embodying it.^ The term \" psychical belief \" should\nhave been editorially defined, for psychical belief (even accepting\nthis loose use of \" psychical \") is not necessarily the same thing\nas conviction of the reality of supernormal phenomena. This dis\ntinction is tacitly recognised by the division of the book into four\nparts, containing respectively the contributions of those \" convinced\nof the multiplicity of psychical phenomena,\" of those \" convinced\nof the rarity of genuine psychical phenomena,\" of those \" uncon-\nvinced as yet,\" and of those \" antagonistic to the claims that such\nphenomena occur.\" (We may well ask why the word \" genuine\n\"\"\nwas introduced into the second reading : we are to understand,\npresumably, that the lecturers in the first group, among whom is\nSir Oliver Lodge, believe in the multiplicity of phenomena that\nare not genuine !)\nTo come to the selection of lecturers and subjects, it is un-\nfortunate that in such a course as this was intended to be, sixty\npages are devoted to a contemporary case (the Margery case) all\naspects of which are still subjects of acute controversy. The\nlectures of Miss Austin and Miss Deland, while interesting enough,\nmust be put down as literary, rather than as scientific, per-\nformances. As for the late Harry Houdini, who repeats once\nmore the oft-told tale of mediumistic fraud (in an extract from his\nbook A Magician among the Spirits), we refuse, with all resj^ect, to\nconsider skill in conjuring to be in itself adequate qualification for\noiiering serious criticism of psychical research.\nDr. McDougall contributes a lecture on \" Psychical Research as\na University Study,\" which is probably the most eloquent and\nsustained argument for psychical research as a scientific study that\nhas ever been written. We hope it will be reprinted as a pamph-\nlet and given the widest possible circulation. Sir Oliver Lodge's\npaper is a characteristically direct and lucid survey of the history\nand phenomena of our subject, together with the formulation of a\n^ On p. 16, for mircales read miracles ; p. 22, for \" Thirty Years of Psy-\nchical Investigation \" read \"...

Dr. Schiller restates the problems of psychical research\nas they appear from his own logical standpoint, with emphasis on\nthe possibility of applying the pragmatic test to them. As Dr.\nSchiller points out (p. 221), dowsing is the only \" psychical\n\"\nphenomenon which has as yet successfully met this test, though\nthere is no intrinsic reason why all the other phenomena should\nnot prove amenable to it. Our President, Professor Driesch, ex-\namining the relation of psychical research to philosophy, finds\npractically all its phenomena to be readily capable of being\nunderstood. He finds it impossible, however, to explain psycho-\nmetry without introducing paraphysical or spiritist hypotheses : for,\nw'hile clairvoyance may be related to certain philosophical doctrines,\nsuch as that of Leibnitz's omniscient monad, the role of the in-\nanimate object in psychoraetry makes this impossible. But is this\nnot to make premature assumptions concerning the actual role of\nthis inanimate object ? Is it not possible that the belief of a\npsychometrical medium in the necessity of an object to be psy-\nchometrized, may act as a censor preventing the exercise of the\nnormal clairvoyant faculty unless such an object is actually present ?\nOn this assumption, we need not have recourse to Dr. Driesch's\nsuggestion (p. 173) that psychometry may be assimilated to the\nphysical phenomena which occur in discontinuity with the medium's\nbody, by supposing that the object in psychometry has \" on \" it\na materialized structure perceptible only to the medium. The only\njiheuomenon for which Dr. Driesch is not prepared (p. 170) to\nadvance any hypothesis whatever is premonition. The whole paper\nis extremely suggestive and should be closely studied.\nApart from Houdini, Dr. Coover and Dr. Jastrow are the only\nlecturers definitely opposed to the claims of psychical research\n(although the former appears in the section of the \" unconvinced \").\nDr. Jastrow 's j^aper cannot be described otherwise than as fanciful :\nhe ranges backwards and forwards through history, psychology,\nethnology, without making a single sj^ecific criticism. Here is an\nexam]jle of his method. Half-way through his lengthy lecture we\ncome at last to a paragraph beginning (p. 295) :\n\" Certainly in\n\fJuly, 1!)27 Revieivs 107\nopposing to the last ditch the conclusions and the animus of\nPsychical Research I can do no less than select as its exponent\nthe most favourable example of the position involved.\" This very\nreasonable opening introduces an extensive quotation from Pro-\nfessor Richet, followed by\u2014two pages of amazed exclamation with-\nout a single word of specific criticism !\n^\nDr. Coover does not make the same mistake : his paper almost\nentirely consists of quoted cases and remarks on them. But some\nof these remarks are very surprising indeed. We have space for\nonly a single example : commenting on Richet's plea \" for the\nacceptance of the phenomena on the grounds of the evidence for\ntheir occurrence, not because they are in any way understood,\"\nDr. Coover observes (pp. 233-234) :\n\" But is the evidence for a\nphenomenon really sound if nothing concerning the phenomenon is\nrevealed but its occurrence ?\n\"\nTheodore Besterman.\nIII. A propos de VIntroduction a la MetapsycJiique Humaine. Refuta-\ntion du livreyde Rene Sudre. By Ernest Bozzano. Paris\n:\nJean Meyer. 1926. Pp. 2.50.\nIt was not to be expected that spiritists would relish the\nmethods by which the ingenious M. Sudre sought to dispense with\nthe spiritist interpretation of the psychical phenomena he discussed\nin his Introduction a la MetapsycJiique Humaine ; but it is a well-\ndeserved tribute to his cleverness that Prof. Bozzano should have\nfound it incumbent on him to devote to it so detailed, thorough,\nand readable a confutation. He has no difficulty in showing that\nin his desire to avoid spiritism M. Sudre is often driven to the\nuse of strange devices, and in quoting many cases which, as\nreported, tell strongly in favour of the spiritist interpretation.\nBut M. Sudre, in reply, would presumably content himself with\n1 Dr. Jastrow makes great play with witchcraft, of which he writes (p. 293) :\n\" There is none of the phenomena included in the categories of '\nPsychical\nResearch ' for which the evidence is more abundant, versatile, and compre-\nhensive than that for witchcraft as a reality. . .\n.\"'\nThis is a quite typical\nexample of Dr. Jastrow's method : he is evidently ignorant of Gurney's\nimportant essay on the subject in Phantasms of the Living (i. 172-185), in\nwhich it is shown that there is no evidence whatever for those elements of\nwitchcraft wliich Dr. Jastrow describes as having been \" rationalised out of\nexistence \" (lycanthropy, compacts, nocturnal rides, and the like).\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1927\nstressing \" as reported,\" and hinting that such reports were\nuntrustworthy. As both sides show animus and have a bias, it\nis a very pretty quarrel between rival theories, in which there is\nno need for the psychical researcher as such to take sides, because\nhis primary concern is with the recording and accumulating of\nthe facts. Their interpretation may be allowed to stand over for\nthe present. F. c. S.

H. Salter read a paper entitled \" An Experiment in\nPseudo-Scripts,\" which will appear shortly in Proceedings.\nThe 92nd Private Meeting of the Society took place in the\nSociety's Rooms at 31 Tavistock Square on July 22, 1927\n\u2014\nSir Oliver Lodge in the chair. The reason for holding an\nextra meeting so late in the season was to give our Members\nan opportunity of hearing from the Chinese scholar. Dr. Neville\nWhymant, an account of sittings at which he had been present\nin New York when a so-called \" direct voice \" spoke through\na trumpet in Chinese\u2014at first in modern Chinese, but after-\nwards in archaic Chinese, the voice then apparently claiming\nto be the philosopher Confucius.\nDr. Whymant is not only a Chinese scholar, but speaks'\nmany languages, and it was in order that he might interpret\nwhat was said in Italian that he was invited to join a private\ncircle in New York where Mr. George Valiantine was the\nmedium. The sittings were held in complete darkness.\nItalian remarks duly came, but not in good Italian. This\ndefect, however, was explained by the control as due to his\nbeing a Sicilian speaking in the Sicilian dialect. Later came\nwhat Dr. Whymant at once recognised as Chinese, and he\nand the control exchanged the elaborate complimentary remarks\ncustomary in China when strangers meet, and carried on some\nconversation. After three or four sittings at which remarks in\nmodern Chinese were made, a name was somewhat indistinctly\ngiven which suggested the name of Confucius to Dr. Whymant\nA 2\n\f11 \"2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1927\nto his great surprise, and conversation in archaic Chinese on\nthe control's part and with old pronunciation and intonation\nfollowed. The actual pronunciation and intonation of the time\nof Confucius himself, who died in 478 B.C., are not known\n\u2014\nindeed, they hardly could be ; but writings of his remain, and\na Tmode of pronouncing them was fixed a few centuries ago,\nand is used by scholars. One of the most remarkable things\nthat happened was that the control not only completed an\nobscure and little read poem from an anthology of Confucius\nor his time, of which Dr. Whymant quoted to him only the\nfirst line, but gave a plausible interpretation of it new to Dr.\nWhymant. \u2022\nThis control spoke at several sittings, and Dr. Whymant\nwas extremely puzzled, not to say disturbed, and has, we\ngather, at present no explanation of the phenomena satis-\nfactory to himself to offer. He regards the investigation of\nthe case as incomplete, and it is much to be hoped that\nwhen he returns to America, as he probably will do in the\nautumn, he may have the opportunity of further sittings,\nand that he may perhaps secure the collaboration of another\nChinese scholar.\nThe paper was illustrated by gramophone records of \" direct\nvoice \" through Valiantine, for which we are indebted to Lord\nCharles Hope, who took them in England subsequently to\nDr. Whymant's American sittings. The gramophone repro-\nduced for us both Italian and Chinese speaking and a short\ncommunication in the Confucius voice. Unfortunately, how-\never, they were not distinct enough to be heard in rooms full\nof people\u2014they suffered, of course, from the double indis-\ntinctness of trumpet and gramophone\u2014and Chinese scholars\npresent at the meeting could make little of them.\nThe paper was, of course, much more interesting than this\nbare account of it. The meeting was a very full one, and\nthose present listened with close attention, and an interesting\ndiscussion followed.\n\fOctober, 1927 Obituary Notice: Miss C. E. Wingfield 113\nOBITUARY NOTICE : MISS C. E. WINGFIELD.\nWe regret to announce the death of Miss C. E. (Kate)\nWingfield, which took place suddenly on July 7, 1927. Miss\nWingfield was a very remarkable crystal-gazer and automatist.\nUnder the pseudonym of \" Miss A.,\" a long description of\nher experiences is given by Myers in Proceedings, VIII, pp.\n498-516 ;\nIX, pp. 73-92. Much of this is reproduced in Human\nPersonality. At a later date Miss Wingfield developed trance\nmediumship, and one of the earliest attempts at a cross-\ncorrespondence is described by Mr. Piddington in Proc.\nXVIII, pp. 205, 267, 294, where Miss Wingfield appears\nunder the name of \" Miss Rawson.\" See also Proc. XXIII,\npp. 212-214, 219-226, Sir Oliver Lodge on \" Trance Com-\nmunications.\" Also Journal, XI, p. 167.\nTwo volumes of Selections from Miss Wingfield's automatic\nwritings have been published under her own name under the\ntitles Guidance fro-m Beyond, More Guidance from Beyond\n(Philip Allen, 1923-1925). Of late years Miss Wingfield's\npsychic activities were confined to her family and friends, by\nwhom she is deeply mourned. L. J. J.\nDR. T. W. MITCHELL S PAPER AT THE BRITISH\nASSOCIATION.\nAt the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement\nof Science at Leeds, a paper was read in the Psychology\nSection, on September 5th, by Dr. T. W. Mitchell on \" The\nPhenomena of Mediumistic Trance.\" The meeting was presided\nover by Dr. William Brown, President of the section.\nThere was a large and interested audience, and the paper\nwas followed by a discussion in which Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr.\nC. S. Myers, Dr. William Brown and others took part.\nThe discussion centred mainly round the question of the\nreality of telepathy, and its adequacy to explain the phenomena\nobserved.\nIn his presidential address on \" Mental Unity and Mental\nDissociation,\" earlier the same day, Dr. William Brown referred\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research octobeu, 1927\nto the work of the Society for Psychical Research in the following\nterms :\n\" The unitary personality, as an organisation of mental activities\nand mental powers, is not static but dynamic, and is in process\nof development throughout life. Although it carries with it, as a\nphysical correlate, a unitary working of the brain and of other\nparts of the body, this does not necessarily involve complete\ndependence \\\\])0\\\\ the latter for its continued existence. The\nquestion of personal survival of bodily death is one which can be\nintelligibly and scientifically put, and which is in theory answer-\nable along the lines of scientific observation and inference. The\ninvestigations carried out by the Society for Psychical Research\nduring the past fifty years are of this nature, and the Society's\nresults and provisional hypotheses can rightly claim a place in\nmodern psychological science. Nevertheless, if due allowance is\nmade for the possible working of such factors as conscious or sub-\nconscious fraud, telepathy between the living, and chance coincid-\nence, the scientifi'C evidence for personal survival of bodily death is\nnot very strong.\nFor more convincing reasons (apart from the pronouncements of\nrevealed religion) in support of this belief we still have to turn\nto philosophy, and in modern philosophical theories of value we\nfind arguments that are far from negligible.''\nMR. PRICE'S LIBRARY\nDuring the reorganisation of the Library, it became clear that\n.additional space was urgently needed for the Society's own books,\nand that it would therefore be impossible both to meet this\ndemand and also to house in the Society's rooms the Library\non Magic which Mr. Price some years ago kindly lent to the\nSociety. The Council were accordingly reluctantly compelled\nto inform Mr. Price to this efi'ect. They wish to take this\noccasion of thanking Mr. Price once again for the loan of his\nvaluable collection.\nLIBRARY NOTICE\nThe reorganisation of the Society's Library has nearly been com-\npleted, and the lending of books will soon be resumed. New\n\fOctober, 1927 Library Notice 115\nbookcases are installed, and a new catalogue will shortly be\nready. It is hoped that members will take full advantage of\nthe improved facilities for consulting and borrowing books and\nperiodicals.\nThe next number of the Journal will contain, it is hoped,\nparticulars of a plan constituting the Library into a Memorial\nto the founders and other outstanding workers in the Society.\nCASE.\nL. 1281 A Telepathic Impression.\nWe print below a report of an auditory impression apparently\nof telepathic origin. It will be seen that the experience\noccurred some time ago, in 1914, but it is confirmed by\nseveral people to whom the relevant facts were known at the\ntime of their occurrence. The case has come to us through\nSir Oliver Lodge, to whom the percipient. Miss S. A. Acland,\nwrote in the first instance. We take this opportunity of\nthanking Miss Acland for her trouble in collecting the necessary\nevidence, and for permission to use her name.\nMiss Acland's letter to Sir Oliver Lodge was as follows :\n7 Park Town, Oxford,\nMay 29, 1927.\nWill you forgive me for once more troubling you with a letter ?\nI have been thinking for some time of writing to you on the\nsubject of telepathy, but waited until after I had heard your\nbroadcast of the result of the telepathy experiment, which I did\nlast evening.\nI have only had one experience myself in telepathy\u2014but that\nwas, I hope you may think, interesting. I spent eight winters\nfor my health in Madeira, leaving for seven of those years my\nfaithful maid in charge of my house and affairs, including my\nlittle dog Chum, a Yorkshire terrier. The year 1910 ^ I left my\nmaid, Mrs. Lawrence, as usual in Oxford ; she had then been\nwith me twenty years, and we slept in neighbouring rooms with\nthe door between us a little way open, as she was an invalid.\nOn the night of Feb. 22, 1914, I went to bed as usual, but\nslip for 1914, see below.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1927\nawoke suddenly, hearing, as I felt sure, Lawrie, as I call her,\ncalling for me. I did not remember that I was in Madeira, and\nsaid, \" Yes, Lawrie. I'm coming,\" and put out my right hand\nto turn up my electric light which is on that side in Oxford, and\nfound space. I then realized that I was in Madeira, but still\nseemed to hear her calling. I then turned up my light, which\nwas on my left hand, and looked at my watch, which told me\nit was 2.20. I could do nothing, so turned it out again, and\nafter a time went to sleep.\nIn the morning my maid, who is Mrs. Lawrence's niece, came\nin, and my first words were : \"I am so afraid that there is\nsomething very wrong with your Aunt, she seemed to be calling\nfor me so urgently last night.\" Later Dr. Grabham, the well-\nknown Madeira doctor, now 87, came in, and I told him. I was\nso much impressed and distressed.\nI wrote home by the next mail to enquire whether there was\nanything wrong that night. In those days it took just about\nthree weeks to receive an answer. When it came it told me\nthat my much-loved little dog was desperately ill that day ; the\nVet. had been three times and our kind Doctor three or four\ntimes in the hope of saving Chum's life. He had probably been\npoisoned. Mrs. Lawrence sat up with him the night of the 22nd,\ngiving him Brand's Essence or drops of brandy every quarter of\nan hour. She kept saying, \" Oh ! how I wish that Miss Acland\nwere at home. How I wish she were at home.\" The wish was\nso strong that it woke me 1500 miles away. The little dog\nrecovered. . . .\nYours very truly,\nSarah A. Acland.\nOn June 3, 1927, the editor, Mrs. Salter, wrote to Miss\nAcland, asking whether it would be possible to obtain con-\nfirmatory statements from Dr. Grabham, Mrs. Lawrence, Miss\nMassey, and the doctor in England who had attended the\ndog. On July 9, 1927, Miss Acland wrote to Mrs. Salter as\nfollows :\nI think I have now collected all the evidence for which you\nask. I enclose (1) a signed note from Dr. Michael Grabham,\nM.D., F.R.C.P., etc., etc. (2) A note from my maid, Miss C.\nMassey. (3) A note from Mrs. C. Lawrence. (4) A certificate\n\fOctober, 1927 Case 117\nfrom Dr. F . I wrote out the paper which Dr. Grabham has\nsigned to save him trouble, and in returning it this week he\nwrites, \" I have no difficulty in signing the statement, as I\nremember the circumstances well.\" I have still Mrs. Lawrence's\nletters telling me of the little dog Chum's illness on her birthday\nand of her wish for me. . . .\nSarah A. Acland.\nWith this letter were enclosed, the statements referred to by\nMiss Acland, as below :\nQuiNTA DO Val,\nFunchal, Madeira.\nI quite well remember Miss Acland telling me when I went to\nsee her one morning that she had been awakened by fancying\nthat Mrs. Lawrence, who was in Oxford, had been calling to her.\nMiss Acland feared that the maid was ill, as her health had been\na source of great anxiety to Miss Acland for many years.\nMichael Gtrabham.\nI was with Miss Acland in Madeira, and quite remember her\ntelling me in the morning when I went to her, that she was\nafraid something was the matter with my Aunt in Oxford, as she\nhad been awakened by hearing her call.\nThis was the morning of Feb. 23, 1914.\nC. E. Massey.\nFeb. 22, 1914.\nI shall never forget my birthday, Feb. 22, 1914, when I was\nattending all day and that night to little Chum, who was so very\nill, and I kept wishing that Miss Acland was at home.\nCaroline Lawrence.\n9-vi-27.\nI certify that I well remember that Miss Acland's little dog\nwas ill, and that I went to see him ; this was in February 1914,\nwhen Miss Acland was in Madeira. In a few days I got a letter\nfrom Miss Acland that told me that she had a foreknowledge of\nsomething wrong at home, as she had heard Mrs. Lawrence calling\nher two or three times so plainly that she wondered what was\nthe matter.\nJ. R. C. F ,\nM.A., L.R.C.P. Lond.\n\f118 Journal of Society jar Psychical Research October, rJ27\nIt will be observed that in Miss Acland's letter of July 9,\n1927, she mentions that she still has in her possession the\nletters from Mrs. Lawrence telling her of the dog's illness.\nAs these letters constitute the only written records of the\nevents concerned made within a short time of their occurrence,\nit seemed advisable to see them, in order to put the case on\nthe strongest possible basis of evidence. Accordingly, with\nMiss Acland's permission, Mrs. Salter wrote to Dr. Schiller,\nasking whether he would call upon Miss Acland and see the\nletters, which he was good enough to do. On July 20, 1927,\nDr. Schiller wrote to Mrs. Salter as follows :\nCorpus Christ: College,\nOxford.\n. . . [Miss Acland] showed me the letters of Mrs. Lawrence,\n\\vhich were full of small household details, and from which I\ntranscribed what seemed the most relevant })arts.\n(1) On Feb. 27, 1914, she wrote :\n1 must tell you we have had Chummy ill. On Saturday\n[Feb. 21, 1914] after tea Ethel and Rosie took him for a\nwalk. It had been a wet day, so it was very dirty.\nWhether he picked anything or had a chill I do not know. . . .\nWhen he came back he seemed quite himself until we were\njust having sujjper, when he was very sick, and was so\nseveral times in the night ; and on Sunday he was very ill,\nso before dinner I asked Mr. V [the Vet.] to come. . . .\nI told Mr. F on Monday how ill he was [Mr. F. is Miss\nA.\"s doctor and had given her the dog], and he came up first\nthing. ... I feel so thankful he has pulled through. . . . He\nwas in a state of stupor all Sunday, the night too.\n(2) On 6th Mar., 1914, she wrote :\nMy birthday was spent looking after dear little Chum,\nwhich I shall not be likely to forget. At this minute he is\nlying on the rug asleep with his ball. . . . He went with me\nthis morning.\nThese references ought to enable you to verify the dates suffi-\nciently.\nI have also seen Dr. C4rabham's letter accompanying his con-\nfirmation. ...\nF. C. S. Schiller.\n\f\u2022OCTOBEE, 1927 Revieiv 119\nKEVIEW.\nAn Experiment with Time. By J. W. Dunne. A. C. Black,\nLtd. Pp. 208. 8s. 6d.\nThe first hundred pages of this very suggestive book describe\ncertain dream experiences of Mr. Dunne and his friends, in some\nof which future events were apparently foreseen with an accuracy\nwhich, though not photographic, is sufficiently striking and un-\ncanny to merit the most serious attention. This dream prevision\ndoes not appear to have been precisely of that particular brand\nwhich M. Sudre has styled \" duplicating precognition,\" since our\nauthor's dream scenes were usually composite pictures in which\npast and future experience and pure imagination are blended,\nrather than faithful reproductions of future events. Thus, for\ninstance, one night in the spring of 1902, Mr. Dunne dreamed he\nwas standing on the slopes of a hill watching an island on which\na volcano was about to explode. The dream developed into a\nnightmare in which Mr. Dunne found himself rushing about among\nthe French authorities of a neighbouring island and shouting in\nhis efforts to save the threatened island, \" Listen ! four thousand\npeople will be killed unless \" A little later (he does not\ngive the exact date) Mr. Dunne received a newspaper describing\nthe volcano disaster in the French island Martinique. The\nnewspaper mentioned a probable loss of over forty thousand\nlives, and it is curious that our author misread these figures\nas four thousand, which was the number given in his dream.\nSubsequent information showed that the actual number of deaths\nhad nothing in common with four thousand, and from this fact\nand many similar experiences, Mr. Dunne concludes that what he\nforesees in his dreams are not distant events in the world, but\nanticipations of his own future mental experiences. Thus, the\nauthor would appear to have reached independently the con-\nclusion of Dr. Osty that it is his own future which the dreamer\nforesees, and not the future of those world events of which\nhe will never receive the sense impressions. In other words, if\nthere is displacement of consciousness in time, this displacement\nis directed along the brain tracks of the subject.\nMr. Dunne is very chary throughout his narrative of giving us\nthe exact dates and times of the various occurrences described,\nbut as he states explicitly that his records are not to be regarded\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Ootobeu, i!t27\nas scientific evidence, it would be somewhat unfair to bring him\nto book on that score. At the same time, it is a matter for\nregret that Mr. Dunne, who has such a keen sense of experimenta-\ntion, and who seems fully alive to the psychological possibilities,\nof his subject, should have omitted to take the simple precaution\nof getting his dream records witnessed and posted immediately to\nsome responsible scientific man. Oases of prevision, in which the\nevidence is unimpeachable, are at present as rare as lunar rain-\nbows, and it is a pity that such good cases as Mr. Dunne presents\nmay possibly have to be discounted on the grounds of insufficient\ncorroboration.\nIn addition to the dreams, there are described certain waking\nexperiments which bear a not altogether fanciful analogy to the\nbook tests of psychic research. Having chosen some book which\nhe had not previously read, say Mason's House of the Arrow, the\nauthor opens it at the beginning and finds the name of one of\nthe characters, being careful not to glance at any other page.\nHe then closes the book, sits down and gives up his mind to.\nfree association. Discarding those images which belong definitely\nto the past, he jots down others that have an appearance of\nnovelty, and among these latter he perceives the image of \"a\nclock pointing to half-past ten.\" He seems to reach this image\nby association with the character he has chosen, and on opening\nthe book he finds that the plot of the whole story hangs upon\n\" a clock pointing to half-past ten.\" In this particular case,,\nalthough Mr. Dunne had not read The House of the Arrow, it\nmight not be unreasonable to suppose that he may have pre-\nviously seen some review of this book and forgotten about it.\nWhether these waking experiments are to be regarded as real\ncases of clairvoyance in future time will be to many an open\nquestion, but the incident (p. 86) of seeing an umbrella standing\non its handle outside the Piccadilly Hotel and next day noticing\nan old lady using her umbrella in this fashion near the same spot\ncertainly lends support to the author's interpretation.\nIn order to account for these redoubtable experiences Mr. Dunne\nhad first recourse to the hypothesis of false memory or \" identify-\ning paramnesia.\" This hypothesis he easily eliminated by care-\nfully recording his dreams at the very moment of waking, and\nhe was led gradually to elaborate an extremely complicated theory\nof \" serial times,\" and \" serial observers,\" which, imless we have\n\fOctober, 1927 Review 121\nentirely misunderstood it, seems based on a fallacy. Adopting the\nepiphenomenalist standpoint, he regards every mental state as\ncorrelated to a group of brain events and the brain itself as a\nfour-dimensional complex of events which occupy a certain length\nGH of the time dimension. Every point X on GH marks a three-\ndimensional time section of the brain, and the events comprised\nin this section are schematically represented by points A, B, C,\netc., lying in a line through X drawn perpendicular to the plane\nof the paper, the three dimensions of space being, for the sake of\nconvenience, contracted into one. Travelling along the time line\nGH is an observer 01, who can only think in three dimensions\nand who takes, as it were, successive mental snapshots of the\nthree-dimensional sections of the brain. Now, according to the\nauthor, the motion of this observer 01 along the time dimension\nmust itself be timed by reference to a new kind of time, which\nhe calls T2. The observer 01 must himself be observed by a\nnew observer 02, whose span of consciousness is four-dimensional,\nand whose field of attention at any moment consists of the\npsychical correlates of the time extended brain events contained\nwithin a segment of the line GH. To this new observer our\nordinary time becomes merely an additional dimension of space,\nand his real time of conscious duration is figured as the new\ntime T2, so that the conceptual world of 02 is really five-dimen-\nsional. This new time T2 is geometrically represented as exend-\ning in the plane of the paper in a direction perpendicular to the\nold time line GH. As the \" three-dimensional \" observer 01\nmoves along GH from birth to death, the line GH itself is\nimagined to be moving in time T2, perpendicular to its own\nlength, so that (assuming the two displacements to be j^ropor-\ntional to each other) the observer 01 is really moving in a\ndiagonal line. The motion of 02 in time T2 must itself be\ntimed by reference to a third time T3, and the observer 02\nmust himself be observed by a new observer 03, whose field of\nperception would therefore be five-dimensional and his conceptual\nworld six-dimensional, and so the process is conceived to go on\nindefinitely, until we reach an ultimate time and an ultimate\nobserver\u2014the \" observer at infinity.\"\nDuring waking hours the four-dimensional observer 02 sur-\nrounds the bright moving focus of 01 like a fringe of dimmer\nlight, and follows him slavishly along GH. In sleep, however^^\n\f122 Journal oj Society for Psychical Research October, 1927\nwhen 01 is temporarily extinct, 02 is free to fix his attention\non any strip of GH, and this strip may lie either in the past of\n01 or in his future. Now, according to the author, the observer\n02 has not properly learnt his business of interpreting four-dimen-\nsional presentations, which he tends to represent to himself as a\nseries of three-dimensional sections with gaps between. -Hence\nwe have an explanation of the disconnected character of dreams,\nand also of the intermingling of past and future in the prevision\ndreams. At physical death the observer 01 is the only one to\ndisappear from the diagram, but observer 02 remains immortal in\ntime T2 as GH moves indefinitely up the page.\nNow, in criticising this scheme of serial times, we must first\nnote that the author regards the cerebral elements as having\n'extensions into this mysterious time T2, and he represents these\nextensions by straight lines (or, more strictly, right cylinders with\ntheir axes parallel to the direction T2). This seems necessarily\nto imply that he looks upon our space-time universe of experience\nas being a four-dimensional section of some larger five-dimensional\ncomplex of which the new time T2 will constitute the fifth\ndimension. Now, if there is an observer 02 who interprets this\nfifth dimension as the time T2 of his conscious duration,\nthen it seems clear that for such an observer our own universe\nin time Tl (or as much of it as he can grasp) is merely\nan instantaneous phenomenon in his consciousness. In fact, 02\nwill move instantaneously out of our universe into other four-\ndimensional sections of the complex which, though they may be\nin some unknown sense continuations of our world, are yet\nemphatically outside our world. It would appear, therefore, that\nthe author is wrong in supposing that the observer 02 would be\nable to follow the observer 01 in the time GH, since the whole\nof GH, its cerebral states and correlated conscious states, would\nbe but a moment in the existence of 02. 02, in fact, cannot\nremain in our universe, and it does not seem possible to conceive\nthe old time and the new time T2 as flowing on together.\nBy representing the cerebral extensions in time T2 as being\nright cylinders, the author would seem to imply that in this\ntime T2 all the phenomena of our four-dimensional universe\nsimply endure without any change. But if such is his meaning\nthere would appear to be little justification for introducing the\ntime 72. To give a truer picture of the cerebral extensions in\n\fOctober, 1927 Reviews 12S\ntime T2, they should have been represented, not as right cylinders^\nbut as some more general kind of surfaces.\nThe best way out of the difficulty would be for the author\ndefinitely to abandon time T'2 and the other serial times which\nseem to lie altogether outside human experience. It might, in\nfact, be better to attempt to explain prevision as a mere dis-\nplacement of the field of perception along the time of ordinary\nexperience, and thus avoid introducing the unknown and the\nunknowable.\nTwo later chapters of the book are devoted to expounding a\ncurious theory of\n'\"\nintervention,\" which, even if the original\nscheme were workable, strikes us as rather unplausible and at\nvariance with the author's epiphenomenalism.\nBut whatever may be thought of Mr. Dunne's theories, it must\nbe admitted that he has made a distinct contribution to our\nknowledge of dreams and prevision, and it is to be hoped that\nothers will be found ready to follow in the way he has opened\nup. If his book leads others to record their dreams and to-\nrepeat his waking experiments while paying attention to the vital\nquestion of corroboration, it will not have been written in vain.\nS. G. SOAL.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitsch.f. Parapsychologie, April 1927. Mr. R. Lambert has a full article\non the sittings of the members of the S.P.R. with Mrs. Leonard,\nin which he concludes that her phenomena are genuine, but that\nit is not possible to decide between the alternative explanations.\nThere is a report of a sitting with Frau Silbert by Dr. A. v.\nWinterstein. The discussion about Sundar Singh is continued by\nHerr Pfister, and there are a number of minor articles, of which\nthe most interesting is an account of sittings with the Icelandic\nmedium Ni Indridason by Prof. Nielsson of Copenhagen. The\nMay number begins with a translation of E. J. Dingwall's Reijort on\n\" Margery \" from Proceedings, Pt. 98. There follows a Report on\nEleonora Zugun by Dr. W. Kroner, secretary of a commission\nwhich examined her from Nov. 1926 to Jan. 1927. Her pheno-\nmena are declared to be supranormal in origin, although it is\nadmitted that she cheats when she can, and that they appear only\non such parts of her body she could have bitten or scratched.\n\f124 Joiirval of Society for Psychioal ResearcJt <:)ctober, 1027\nIn view of this it is difficult to believe the assurances of the\nexperimenters that she was adequately controlled, the more so as\nmost (if not all) of the \" bites \" corresponded with the measure-\nments of her own jaws. Prof. C. Limmer discusses the Indian\nrope-trick, and favours the theory that it rests on suggestion and\ncollective hallucination, but admits that this theory ought to be\nproved experimentally. The June number continues the Margery\nReport, and states Prof. Driesch's list of the alterations in the\nconditions of experiment necessary to make Margery's sittings\nconvincing. It contains also three ghost-stories, of which two are\nfirst-hand.\nThe Zeilsch. f. Kritischen Okkuliismvs, II. 3, starts with an article\nby Prof. Dessoir of Berlin on the clairvoyant \" Helene Schnelle,\"\nwhich is to appear in the forthcoming sixth edition of his book Vom\nJenseits der Seele. Prof. Dessoir reports experiments of his own\nand of his friends in which the sensitive described the character\nof persons unknown to her, and sometimes to her sitters, from\nspecimens of their handwriting. Her success seems to have been\nvery considerable though by no means uniform, and though Prof.\nDessoir points out that descriptions given will usually fit a number\nof persons. The sensitive died in 1923. M. Paul Heuze describes\nsome sensational experiments which he made to test the \" buried\nfakir \" stories. The only historical case which seemed prima facie\nworth examining was one he found in Larousse's Dictionary, but of\nwhich he could discover no English original. It tells, somewhat\ninaccurately, the tale of General Wade's presence at the court of\nPunjit Singh in 1838, when a fakir was exhumed who was said\nto have been buried for six weeks with a guard set upon his\ntomb. In the Larousse account an English officer (a midship-\nman !) was said to have been present at the burying, and so\nM. Heuze calculates the fakir could have been taken out again\nafter three-quarters of an hour. M. Heuze then heard that a\nfakir had allowed himself to be submerged in a coffin in the\nHudson River at New York for a whole hour, and he determined\nto repeat the experiment, and actually remained in a watertight\ncoffin for an hour and a quarter, the simple explanation being\nthat there was enough air in the coffin to enable him to hold out\nso long. It is evident that his experiment disposes only of stories\nabout the burying of fakirs, and not of those which describe their\napparent lifelessness on exhumation ; to explain the latter, some-\n\fOctober, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 125\nthing analogous to animal \" hibernation \" would seem to be\nrequired. Count v. Klinckowstroem has a short article on science\nand fakirism, arguing that all the performances of the \" fakirs\n\"\nare tricks. Dr. v. Schuler has an obituary notice of Houdiui.\nMr. Dingwall has an article on the Soul of the Occultist, which\nsuggests that the investigation of occultism requires special train-\ning, and that in the absence of this men of science also are easy\nto deceive. Dr. H. Rosenbusch continues his destructive criticism\nof physical phenomena, and attacks Mr. R. Lambert's account of\nEusapia Palladino very elaborately. He denies, inter alia, that\nthe members of the S.P.R. Committee were exjaert conjurors, and\nclaims to derive evidence that they were tricked from their own\nReport. There is also a picture of Houdini fabricating paraffin\ngloves \" with bent fingers. Count v. Klinckowstroem, in review-\ning Proceedings, Pt. 100, declares that cross-correspondences are\noverrated in England and form '\"\nan enormous mass of dough with\nvery few raisins of questionable value.''\nSeelenproUeme, No. 2, May 1927. This number is mostly com-\nposed of theoretical articles, but V. v. Wrede relates his experiences\nwith \" Nina,\" a trance-personality of Frau Ideler, who claimed to\nbe a Russian girl he had known twenty years before, spoke much\nbetter Russian than her medium, and was instrumental in bringing\napports, mostly of flowers.\nF. C. S. S.\nThe Revue Metapsychique beige (November-December 1926, January-\nFebruary 1927) publishes a lengthy account by J. Thiebault,\nPresident du centre spirite de Mantes sjSeine, of the materialisation\nseances at which he was present in 1926 in Mme. Alexandre's\ncircle at Mantes. On reference to the same review of May-June\n1926 we see that these seances are an old story. \" It will be\nseven years in April 1926 since the Mantes-sur-Seine spiritistic\ncentre has given public proofs of the power of its psychic energy\n;\nseven years since the solution of the problem of survival can be\nobjectively met there \" (B.M.B. May-June 1926). Since April\n1922 Commandant de Marine Compana has directed the sittings\nfrom the \" spirit \" side. The chief spirit manifesting herself at the\nseances appears to be Mme. Alexandre's daughter Madeleine, who\ndied in 1919. Altogether four mediums have successively helped\nthe spirit to materialise, a certain Blaise operating since 1922.\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. October. 1927\n(Before that date some sittings had taken place at Versailles in\n1921.)\nIt may be said at once that the phenomena in question are\nmost su.'^picious. They must have made the same impression on\northodox spiritualists, since the Revue Metapsychique beige of May-\nJune 1926 informs us that at the Paris Spiritistic Congress of\n1925 M. Thiebault had not been permitted to lecture on the\nMantes phenomena !\nThe President of the Mantes centre spinte still firmly adheres,\nhowever, to his belief in their authenticity, and on pp. 195-211\nof the November-February number of the Revue we are treated to\na lengthy account of the performances in question, followed by\n\" scientific \" and philosophic disquisitions. Various apparitions are\ndescribed, one claiming to be Joan of Arc.\nAll the phantoms appear to be very material, and M. Thiebault\ndescribes Madeleine's \" plastic pose of the most charming effect.\"\"\nIn the Mercure de Fm)>ce of April 15 M. Rene Sudre mentions\nvery briefly Dr. Christian Winther's (of Copenhagen) experiments\nin full light with Mile. Anna Rasmussen. A pendulum which\nhad been placed in a closed wooden box, and could not even\nbe seen from the outside, was repeatedly moved \" telekinetically.'^\nThese movements were automatically registered on photograms, the\nmedium being placed at a distance of 3 metres 75 centimetres\nfrom the apparatus. In 72 cases out of 78 the movements were\nexecuted at the very moment the experimenter asked for them, as\nwas subsequently revealed by examination of the photogram.\nM. Sudre also mentions in the same review Dr. Oskar Fischer's,\n(of Prague) recent experiments with Rudi Schneider which were\napparently successful. The description, however, is far too brief\nin M. Sudre's account to enable us to judge by ourselves of the\nadequacy of the precautions taken.\nThe Revue Metapsychique (Paris) of March-April 1927 has a\nvery long article by Professor Cazzamalli of Milan on \" Cerebral\nradiations in face of ])ractical and theoretical criticisms.\" The\nItalian savant answers his critics, and insists on the authen-\nticity of his experiments at great length. M. C. de Vesme prints\nthe sequel of his paper on \" The part played by metapsychical\nphenomena in the origin of religious beliefs.\" Many cases of\napparently supernormal incidents connected with various African\npeoples and tribes are quoted, some of them striking. The most.\n\fOCTOBBK, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 127\ncurious is taken from a book entitled Fleurs noires et dmes blanches\nby Pere Trilles, a missionary (pp. 123-124). If in order to explain\nit we do not admit \" bilocation \" (surely a hypothesis to be\navoided at almost any cost), we must postulate a veridical audi-\ntory hallucination telepathically induced by the negro wizard in\naccordance with the missionary's suggestion\u2014and this at a con-\nsiderable distance. The case is very \" uncanny.\" Pere Trilles,\nM. de Vesme says, also described it in a public lecture delivered\nin October 1906 before the Nantes Society of Commercial\n'Geography.\nOn the other hand, the alleged telepathic or supernormal trans-\nmissions of messages among African tribes over great distances\n\u2022seem to be jjerfectly explicable by systems of signalling with\n\" tom-toms,\" etc., which do, in my opinion, much credit to these\nsavages' \" ingenuity, and afford a perfectly natural explanation\nof seemingly incomprehensible occurrences. M. de Vesme makes\nmention of these systems, but does not seem to give this\n\u2022explanation as wide an application as it deserves.\nIn the Chronique M. Pascal Forthuuy gives some information\nabout a Brazilian medium, Mirabelli by name (of Sao Paulo),\nTvhose marvels are described in a pamphlet of 74 ]oages, published\nin Sao Paulo by Rodolpho Mikulasch (Rue Ypirauga 50, in Sao\nVincente Santos). The phenomena\u2014which, it must be admitted,\nare far too good to be true,\"\u2014are attested by 555 witnesses,\namong whom are 72 physicians- The marvels certified to include\napports and full-form materialisations in the physical line : in the\nmental lino, long messages in English, Italian, Erse, Persian,\nDutch, French, Spanish, German, Catalan, Hebrew (Moses being\nthe communicator !), Bulgarian, Czech, Russian, etc. !\nIt would be curious to know to what modest dimensions all\nthese preposterous claims would dwindle supjjosing Mirabelli were\nto appear at 31 Tavistock Square, or even at 89 Avenue Kiel.\nRevue Metapsychique of May-June has a note on the Third\nInternational Congress for Psychical Research in Paris ; an article\nby Dr. Belbeze on \" Cartomancy and Metagnomy \"\n; two notes\nby MM. Andry-Bourgeois and M. Desoille on Prof. Cazzamalli's\n\" Cerebral Radiations \" ; and another article of M. de Vesme's\non \" Metapsychical Phenomena and Religious Beliefs.\" This time\nsupernormal or quasi-supernormal experiences are described in\nconnection with American and \" Hyperborean \" aborigines. There\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octobeu, I92r\nis nothing in the incidents quoted which could compare with\nPere Trilles' case. A \" Causerie \" by Prof. Santoliquido (President\nof the International Metapsychical Institute) is printed, together\nwith an address by Prof. Charles Richet from which I quote\nthe following sentences :\n\" II y a done, autour de nous, d'innom-\nbrables et puissantes vibrations . . . Qui sait si I'ame des vivants,\nsi meme Vdme des morts . . . ne degagent pas des effluves inaccess-\nibles au vulgaire, capables d'emouvoir rorganisme des sensitifs et\nde leur reveler, en de rapides eclairs, quelques fragments de la\nrealite qui nous encercle ?\nIn the Chronique M. Pascal Forthuny mentions the case of\na certain M. Augustin Lesage, a Pas-de-Calais miner, who suddenly\nbecame a painter in obedience to a voice believed by him to be\nexternal. He gave tangible proofs of his new faculty by working\nat the Institute on decorative \" panneaux \" from 6th April to\n10th May of this year. P.-P.-S.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for\nJuly contains an article by Mr. Charles R. Wild on the medium-\nship of Mrs. Pruden. Mr. Wild has had frequent sittings with\nMrs. Pruden since 1906, and is convinced that the phenomena\nobserved are genuine. He describes an occasion in 1908 when a\nmessage was written on the inner side of a closed slate during a\nperiod when Mr. Wild was holding the slate continuously under\nthe table, the open side towards himself. The weak point of\nMr. Wild's testimony is that his contemporary notes\u2014made for\nhis own use\u2014are mainly concerned with the contents of the messages\nreceived ; the physical conditions are only briefly noted, and in\nrecalling them Mr. Wild has to depend largely on his memory.\nMr. Harry Price contributes the first of a series of articles on\nthe recent opening of Joanna Southcott's box.\nMonsieur Rene Sudre gives an account of a sitting with Rudi\nSchneider at Braunau. The sitting was in the nature of a\ndemonstration and no attempt was made to enforce rigid con-\nditions. M. Sudre takes the opportunity to stress the importance\nof training mediums to produce their phenomena in good light,\nwhich he believes can be done.\nThere is also a report of a lecture by Mr. H.

On the receipt of a letter expressing their willingness\nto co-operate in the experiments by acting as percipients\nmembers will receive full instructions as well as a notice of\nthe next experiment.\nTHE PARIS CONGEESS FOR PSYCHICAL\nRESEARCH.\nThe Third International Congress for Psychical Research took\nplace in Paris from September 26th to October 1st (inch),\nin the Amphitheatre Richelieu, Sorbonne.\nThe exact number of the persons present is unknown to\nme ; it was from 200 to 250 I am told. The EngHsh S.P.R.\nwas represented by Mr. E. N. Bennett, Mr. W. H. Salter\nand Dr. WooUey.\nProfessor Richet was Honorary President, and in spite of\nhis eighty years took a most active part in the proceedings.\nSeveral countries were represented, but several delegates whose\narrival had been announced did not come. The German\ndelegates were especially numerous. Many speeches and\naddresses were delivered in German, some at great length, and\nso far as I know, no incidents whatever occurred in this\nconnection. Politically speaking, the atmosphere was decidedly\n\" Locarnian.\"\nThe \" seance inaugurale \" (Monday, September 26th, 9.30 a.m.)\nwas opened by two speeches : one by Prof. Richet, the other\nby Professor Hans Driesch, the latter being entitled \" On the\ninfluence of Metapsychics on the general aspect of the Uni-\nverse.\" Dr. Osty, the Director of the Institut Metapsychique\nInternational, and M. Carl Vett, a Corresponding Member of\nour Society, to whose labours those congresses are much indebted\nalso spoke.\nThe papers read I will divide into two parts : (1) those\ndealing with facts (experiments, observations, etc.) ; (2) those\n\fNovEirBEE, 1927 Paris Congress for Psychical Research 133\nof a more or less theoretical character. The latter I shall\nabstain from commenting on at all. Of course the precise\ndistinction is not always easy to draw and in one or two\ninstances the line of demarcation drawn may appear somewhat\narbitrary.\nI will begin by the enumeration of the papers of the hrst\ncategory, giving them in the order in which they were read ^\nwhether by the author or by some other person.\nDr. Cazzamalli, Milan : Electromagnetic waves in their connec-\ntion with certain psychosensorial phenomena of the human\nbrain.\nM.

They were mentioned only\nonce, I beUeve, in Professor Driesch's papers and only by\nname, everything going on exactly as if cross-corresjjondences\nhad never existed.\n(4) It was stated by M. Osty in the course of the discussion\non Mr. Malcolm Bird's paper in defence of \" Margery \" that\na Dr. Menager had succeeded in obtaining casts of human\nhands (artificially), imder conditions previously declared by\n\" experts \" impossible (fingers of two hands interlaced). Such\ncasts were in fact shown us. Professor Ch. Richet commenting\non them stated that special precautions had been taken by\nhim during his experiments with Kluski to insure the use of\nthe paraffin brought by the experimenter and prevent sub-\nBtitution, and this circumstance is important. Still the fact\nremains that a phenomenon declared conclusive 'per se without\nreference to the conditions under which it was obtained cannot\nbe considered as such any more.\n(5) To me personally it was very interesting to hear from\nM.

S.\nREVIEWS.\nI. The Sixth Sense : A Physical Explanation of Clairvoyance,\nTelej)athy, Hypnotism, Dreams and other Phenomena usually\nconsidered Occult. Forty years of Study, Observation and\nExperiment. By Joseph Sinel. With a Foreword by Mac-\nLeod Yearsley, F.R.C.S., F.Z.S. London, 1927. T. Werner\nLaurie. Pp. 180. 6s. net.\nAccording to its \" jacket \" \" this extraordinary book contends\nthat the pineal body in the brain of the higher animals is the\nactive agent in Clairvoyance and Telepathy. Mr. Sinel does not\nmerely advance theories\u2014at every step he gives supporting evidence\n. . . strong enough to stand up against any active criticism.\"\nMr. Sinel certainly rehabilitates the jiineal gland (which orthodox\nscience now regards as an atrophied eye), not indeed to its\nCartesian glory as the sole \" seat \" of the soul, but as the organ\nfor the reception of the effluvia and radiations which he believes\nto account for the phenomena of telepathy and clairvoyance ; but\nhe can hardly be said to prove his case. The evidence on which\nhe relies is not presented in sufficient detail to carry conviction,\nlacks corroboration, and is interspersed with amazing assertions\nlike \" \/ never had a wrony reply \"\n(p. 143) from his chief medium,\na girl with whom he conducted experiments in \" telepathy \" from\n1908 to 1917 (p. 49).\nNow, it so happens that I was privileged to be present at\nsome of Mr. Sinel's experiments, and that a brief account of his\nprocedure will form the most effective criticism of his book. In\nthe winter of 1914 Mr. Sinel sent to my friend Dr. R. R. Marett\nof Exeter College large numbers of drawings and reproductions,\nwhich he said had been made telepathically by the daughter of\nan old friend. The reproductions were remarkably good, both\n\fNOVEMBKR, 1927 Reviews 139\nbetter and more copious than any that had ever been recorded\nin such experiments, and it seemed to Prof. M'Dougall and myself\na clear case for investigation. So in the Easter vacation of 1914\nwe set out for Jersey, and together with Dr. Marett, were admitted\nto a sitting with the medium, a girl of about 15 or 16. We\nsoon found, however, that what happened was this. Mr. Sinel\nwould draw a picture, and the medium would say she saw\nnothing. He would then draw a second picture and a third,\nleaving the first exposed and easily visible on the table of the\nsmall room. The medium would then draw the first picture, and\nMr. Sinel would hail this as a wonderful example of telepathy !\nWe. all thought this a complete explanation, though we did not\nsuppose that originally the girl had regarded the experiments as\nother than a \" game \" (as indeed she called them, cf. p. 137) ;\nbut when Mr. Sinel interpreted his own carelessness as telepathy\nin her, she found it impossible to undeceive him. Prof. M\"Dougall\nreturned to Oxford next day, but I had another sitting with\nMr. Sinel and his \" medium \" in the Jersey Museum, of which he\nwas the Curator. Here the room was large and the pictures\nwere not exposed ; as I expected, therefore, the medium \" could\nsee nothing.\" I thereupon wrote a letter to Mr. Sinel giving\nhim our explanation of the case ; to this he never replied (as\nI supposed, because he could not), and I then reported the whole\ncase to the S.P.R. It now appears that he has recovered his\ncredulity, but I find it difficult, after this experience of his\nmethods, to credit his accounts of his other experiments. I feel\nthat they were probably vitiated by equally simple oversights,\nand if Mr. Sinel wishes to be believed, he must provide indepen-\ndent corroboration to authenticate his assertions.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nII. Wissenschaftlicher Okkultismus. By Dr. August Messer.\nLeipzig : Reulle and Meyer. 1927. Pp. vii, 151.\nThis excellent little introduction to Psychical Research is from\nthe pen of a professor of philosophy in the University of Giessen.\nProfessor Messer discusses the subject under five heads, historical\nsurvey, parapsychic phenomena, paraphysical phenomena, mediums,\nand attempts at explanation, and writes clearly and simply.\nHis attitude is scientific and moderate, and the conclusion he\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Novembke, 1927\ncomes to is that the question of the oripjiu of the phenomena\nmay well be left open for the j^resent, but that it is urgent to\nimprove the methods and equipment of psychical inquiry and to\ntrain up inquirers who are able to devote themselves wholly to\nthe subject. F. C. S. S.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nSeelenprobleme, Nos. 1, 2. V,)21 . These two numbers of the little\nreview published by the Riga Society for Psychical Research\ncontain interesting information chiefly about the mediums now\noperating in Latvia. Three of these are mentioned :\n\" Paleas\n\"\n(a pseudonym), Mme. Ideler (also a pseudonym), Mme. Katoda\n(ibidem). The claim is made that the first is one of the most\npowerful of living mediums.\nSo far as Physical Phenomena are concerned, the first two-\n(Mme. Katoda is apparently no physical medium) seem to deal\nchiefly in apports ; a circumstance to be regretted, seeing\nthat this particular phenomenon is certainly the most doubtful;\nof all physical manifestations. Herr von Wrede describes (p. 58),\na seance with Mme. Ideler, at which \" we distinctly saw how the\nflowers, one might say, formed themselves between the (medium's)\nhands ; that is, at first shapeless masses became visible which\ngrew bigger and bigger ; then they formed separate flowers. I\nplaced myself once behind the medium's back and watched the-\nprocess over her shoulder, so that I could see the medium's bare\narms stretched forward before me.\" The light was however very\ndim, there were from fifteen to seventeen sitters, which is far too\nmany, and I remember reading a somewhat similar account where\nthe medium was the notorious Anna Rothe ; which seems to show\nthat such observations do not necessarily imply the authenticity\nof the occurrence. Everything depends of course on the personality\nof the observer. The same Herr von Wrede describes an interest^\ning case where a trance -intelligence, claiming to be a former\nwoman friend of his, manifested repeatedly through Mme. Ideler.\nTwo incidents which appear to be supernormal are briefly described\nin this connection. Prof. Blacher, the Editor of the review and\nPresident of the Riga S.P.R., contributes a rather striking case\nwhen the alleged deceased mother of a Herr Rheinwald manifested\nat a seance of Mme Ideler's. Both Herr Rheinwald and his wife\n\fNOVEMBEE, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 141\n(evidence given) claim to have clearly recognised the deceased\nby her phraseology and demeanour. Herr Rheinwald's mother\nwas a complete stranger to the medium.\nZeitschrift fur kritiscJien Okkultismus, II. Band, 4 Heft (July 1927).\nCount Perosvky-Petrovo-Solovovo narrates again under the title of\n\" Anonymous Deceiver \" the strange and instructive story of the\nRussian chamberlain and diplomatist (also painter and alpinist), X,\n(see S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. 24, Part 54, and Journal, January\n1924). Incidentally he mentions (p. 254) that there is not a\nshadow of proof that X was ever in connivance with Sambor\n:\na denial which in justice to the late Russian medium should not\nbe lost sight of. The gist of Count P.-P.-S's. paper is, of course,\nto make clear that one of the chief difficulties in mediumistic\ninvestigations comes not from the medium himself, but from some\nof the sitters.\nDr. Richard Baerwald has an interesting and valuable paper on\n\" Hyperaesthesia and Clairvoyance.\" It seems to me that at the\nbottom of this and similar discussions there is a singular mis-\nunderstanding. Hellsehen ought not to partake of \" God's Omni-\nscience \" at all (p. 267) ; it may, supposing it to be authentic,\nsimply mean a form of direct jjerception hitherto unrecognised by\nscience, independent of thought transference, but deprived of any\nmetaphysical element. On the other hand. Dr. Baerwald is\ninclined to give \" hyperaesthesia \" such an extension as to make\nit practically almost indistinguishable from \" clairvoyance \" at a\nshort distance (p. 273). My conviction is that all such specu-\nlative hypotheses are much too premature : we want facts, viz.\nexperiments.\nThis brings me easily to the subject of the late \" Professor\n\"\nBert Reese, who is, in the same number of Z. f. hit. Okl\\, the\nsubject of two interesting articles, one by Count Klinckowstroem,\nthe other by Mr. Dingwall. Much as I appreciate certain aspects\nof the late Harry Houdini's work, I am glad to see his evidence\nas given by Count K. supplemented by the personal experience of\nour late Research Officer. I quite concur with Count K. when\nhe says that the researchers' next task is to test under crucial\nconditions Ludwig Kahn.\nDr. Fournier d'Albe has a very brief paper, with three instruc-\ntive photographs, on the Goligher circle. We learn from it that\nthe medium is now happily married, and does not apparently wish\n\f]42 Joiirval of Society for Psycltical Research November, 1927\nto be reminded of her recent antecedents and the tragic outcome\nthereof.\nDr. Ubald Tartaruga, of the Vienna Parapsychical Institute, has\na severe paper on the Austrian managers or impresarios of\nmediums.\nHerr Friedrich Luther discusses the \" theoretical possibility of a\nphysiological telepathy.\"\nZagaclnienia Metapsychiczne (Warsaw), December 1926. The\nreview begins with an appeal to its readers which, we hope, will\nbe listened to.\nM. Stefan Rzewuski has a long article on sooth-saying and\nmetapsychics, with abundant quotations from Dr. Moll, Professor\nRichet, Dr. Osty, A. Bozzano and others.\nDr. Watrasziwski describes experiments with Mile. Sabira (see\nRevue Metapsychiqiie for January-February 1927).\nM. Prosper Szmurlo has an article on \" Psychometry and Archae-\nology,\" describing experiments made with M. Ossowiecki in a\nrecently-discovered crypt of the Royal Castle in Warsaw. Intro-\nduced into the crypt, Ossowiecki put his hand upon a brick of the\nwall on which a coat of arms was engraved and gave a detailed\ndescription of the crypt as it may have looked in the fourteenth\ncentury, mentioning the presence of prisoners and warders. It\nhas been subsequently ascertained that the crypt had been, in\nfact, used as a prison. He also made other statements which\nthe investigators have not attempted to verify. M. Szmurlo\nconcludes that psychometric power can extend far away into the\npast ; other researchers will probably prefer awaiting further\nconfirmation.\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie, June 1927. A further trans-\nlation of Mr. E. J. Dingwall's report on his sittings with\n\"Margery\" is given (stances of 6th-19th of January, 1925). Pro-\nfessor Hans Driesch follows with some suggestions re an improve-\nment of the conditions prevalent at these seances. Inter alia\nhe recommends that under no conditions should the medium's\nhands be held by Dr. Crandon himself or one of his friends.\n\" It would be best if they were altogether away,\" he adds.\nSeveral spontaneous cases of supernormal character are given\nin the same number, some of which are striking. Heinrich\nFreiherr Droste zu Hiilshoff of Miinster narrates an interesting\nepisode of apparent haunting coupled with teleliinesis (picture\n\fNovember, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 143\ntwice falling off a wall, the second time into the fire-place where\nit burns to ashes). Herr Erich Bogel recounts out of his own\nexperience apparent premonitions in the form of a whisper, occur-\nring in the so-called \" borderland state (between sleeping and\nwaking). An extraordinary case of alleged post-mortem manifesta-\ntions of a physical character (including direct writing by a visible\nspirit hand) is quoted from Polish sources as having occurred\nin the village of Ochotnik, Poland. Some of the manifestations\nare apparently attested by a physician and a priest. It is to be\nregretted that no thorough investigation of these incidents, how-\never suspicious, seems to have been made by the Warsaw Psychical\nResearchers.\nDr. Franz Freudenberg analyses briefly the official report recently\nissued (Verlag von Karl Marhold, Halle a. d. Saale, 1927), on\nthe First General Medical Congress for Psychotherapeutics, held in\nBaden-Baden in April, 1925.\nDr. Reddingius (The Hague) has an article discussing the spirit\nhypothesis, and Herr A. Sichler attempts to explain a purely\nsubjective anthropomorphic hallucination from the standpoint of\npsychoanalysis.\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie, July 1927. The Editor, Dr.\nSiinner, and Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing print two articles\nin memoriam Professor Karl Gruber, who died on 18th June after\na long and severe illness. The deceased, whose services in the\ndomain of \" Parapsychology \" will not be forgotten, Dr. von\nSchrench-Notzing says, is the author of several important works\nand papers bearing on Psychical Research. He began to take\npart in sittings with Willy Schneider in the beginning of 1922,\nattended 33 of such seances, mostly controlling himself, and\nbecame convinced of the genuineness of the phenomena.\nProfessor Ferdinando Cazzaraalli has a long paper on his cerebral\nradiations, which is more or less identical with the one printed\nin the March-April number of Revue Metajxsychique.\nDr. Angelos Tanagra of Athens prints a short account of\nPoltergeist phenomena observed a few months ago at Missolonghi\nby himself and a few other physicians, the supposed medium being\na thirteen years' boy called Christos Vourvachis. The account is\nentitled Massensuggestion oder Ectoplasma ? but I do not feel sure\nthat the incident referred to is not susceptible of a simpler\nexplanation. The mysterious disajjpearance of the little bojr\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1927\ndressed in black seen by tbe seven signatories may have been due\nto a perfectly natural cause ; the eighth- witness who claimed to\nhave seen and heard nothing may have been simply absorbed by his\nthoughts (I do not wish to adopt a more uncharitable explanation).\nHeinrich Freiherr Droste zu Miilshofi briefly narrates a case of\nveridical vision at a distance ; and Dr. Wilhelm Platz defends\nthe right of the spiritistic hypothesis to be considered a \" legiti-\nmate \" one.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, August, 1927. A detailed analysis\nof a pamphlet on the Brazilian medium Carlos Mirabelli pub-\nlished at Santos (Brazil: see Journal S.P.R., Oct., 1927, p. 127)\nis printed. The phenomena described are said to be attested by\n555 witnesses, out of whom the names of 277 are given. They\nare so stupendous that one quite understands that the Editor\nof the Z. f. Parapsychologie should have applied to the Brazilian\nconsul at Munich inquiring whether the names were familiar to\nthe latter, so as to feel sure that the pamphlet was no hoax.\nThe consul answered that seventeen of the persons mentioned\nw^ere personally known to him, among them a former President of\nthe Republic (Senhor Souza), Senhor Reynaldo Porchat, Secre-\ntary of State, Senator Muniz Sodre and Professor Olegario de\nMoura of the University of Sao Paulo.\nAmong the phenomena narrated some materialisations occurring\nat 9 a.m. in the daylight, the medium being both held and\nvisible, are the most stupendous. Among these materialisa-\ntions there figures one of a whole human skeleton ! These\napparitions allow themselves, to be handled and touched, float in the\nair, disappear gradually, etc. Many of them have been photo-\ngraphed. In spite of the numberless disappointments which\nphysical johenomena have brought Psychical Research, I certainly\nagree with the author of the review of 0 Medium Mirabelli,\nResultado de un inquerito, that such evidence as this cannot be\nignored, and that this amazing personality ought to be tested on\nEuropean soil.\nProfessor Blacher, of Riga, describes some attempts at levitation\nwith the medium Frau Ideler, which, as he admits himself, are\nnot completely conclusive (p. 467).\nProfessor Hans Driesch has a concise and lucid paper on\n\"Theoretical Methods as a frame-work in Parapsychology,\" which\nwill well repay perusal.\n\fNovember, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 145\nA lecture on \" Entelechy and Form \" given by Professor K. C.\nSchneider before the Vienna Parapsychical Institute is reproduced ;\nand Dr. Gustav Zeller speaks in the words of highest commenda-\ntion of Edward Reimpell, a Hamburg charact>erologist and clair-\nvoyant.\nIn the same number of the Z. \/. ParapsycJwIogie several spon-\ntaneous cases are given ; the two most interesting are contributed\nby Dr. E. A. Glogau, of Frankfort o. M. ;\nthey deal with influence\ntelepathically exerted by dying persons at a distance.\nRevue Metapsi\/chique, July-August, 1927. Dr. E. Osty prints\nin this number a long paper on \" Practical utilisation of Super-\nnormal Knowledge,\" dealing chiefly with cases where attempts are\nmade to trace dead bodies or lost objects through \" metagnomic\n\"\npower. Dr. Osty begins by narrating briefly a case dating as\niar back as 1692 (the Jacques Aymar case), published at first\nin the Mercure Galant of October, 1692, and reprinted in 1693,\nat Lyon (Amaubri), under the title of Traite de la Baguette). To\nmy mind the behaviour of the clairvoyant in this instance, as\nwell as in some further cases (Abyssinian) briefly mentioned further\non, presents a striking similarity to the behaviour of police-dogs\nAvhen on the track of a criminal. Dr. Osty then relates a long\nseries of incidents out of his own experience obtained through a\nFrench subject, Mme. M. In a few of them the information\ngiven corresponds with actual facts ; in others, the clairvoyant\nderives the knowledge shown, Dr. Osty thinks, from the\npsychisms of other persons ; there are also cases in which she\nJahulates (sic) on her own account. Incidentally, Dr. Osty rejects\nthe assertion that telepathy may be regarded as excluded if the\nperson or persons present have no knowledge of the facts given\nby the clairvoyant, and seems to regard the operation of tele-\npathy at a distance as an established fact.\nM. de Vesme prints a further instalment of his interesting\npaper on \" The part played by metapsychical phenomena in the\norigin of Religious Beliefs.\" This time he deals with Oceania\nand Java. Reference is made to a case already printed in the\nE. M. in 1926 (No. 3, p. 226), and taken from the Reviie Mondiale,\nwhere a certain M. Jean Dorsenne asserts he was able to see in\nthe crystal used by a Tahitian sorcerer a vision already seen by\na native consultante. An article by a Dr. Gerstaeker, a resident of\nJava, published in Die Gartenlaube of 1871, is quoted from for\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1927\nthe Guendarma cases : this being, it is alleged, the native terra\nfor stone throwings of an apparantly supernormal origin. The\nincidents in question are curious, but unfortunately recorded long\nafter the event itself.\nM. Henri Azam prints a short article on Professor Cazzamalli's\nexperiments. He thinks they leave us \" in a state of absolute\nuncertainty (p. 297) ; on the other hand, he considers that they\nmay have a scientific portee much greater than the one which\nthe Professor attributes to them.\n\" The Human Fluid and the proofs of its existence \" are dis-\ncussed in the Chronique. References made to two articles printed\nin the Revue Gencrale de VJ^lectricite of January 22, 1927, and in\nthe Revue Polytechnique de Geneve, November, 1926, where experi-\nments are described, tending to prove that there does really exist\n\" a physiologico-physical agent frequently though irregularly\nemitted by the human body.\" This \" agent \" has been chris-\ntened \" I'Anthropoflux R.\"\nZeitschrift fur psychische Forschung, August, 1927. Dr.\nPagenstecher, of Mexico, narrates the personal experiences which\ninduced him to \" revise \" his Weltanschauung, including various\nincidents connected with his investigation of Mme. Maria Reyes de\nZ.'s psychometric power and Dr. Walter F. Prince's journey to\nMexico, and some knockings of unexplained origin occurring in the\ndead of night in June, 1921.\nProfessor Dr. Christoph Schroder prints the first part of a.\nreport on \" the metapsychical phenomena of Frau Maria Rudloff\n\"\n(a German physical medium of doubtful reputation). Frau\nRudloff's dermatic phenomena are dealt with. They closely\nresemble those of Eleonora Zuglin, the Rumanian medium. The\nincidents described refer to the period October 9th to December\n12th, 1926. In most cases \u2014though not in all \u2014the scratches,\netc., appear on Frau R.'s arms, neck, wrists, etc., when the\nmedium is uncontrolled : in the few cases where there was control\nit ie perfectly conceivable the medium could have eluded it. On\nthe other hand we are repeatedly told that the Ritze, etc., were\nstark blutende, and this circumstance will perhaps be regarded by\nsome as a difficulty in the way of a normal explanation.\nDr. Mathiesen is pursuing his study of the trance-phenomena\nfrom the standpoint of a spiritistic interpretation.\n\fNovember, 1927 Notes on Periodicals 14-7\nVolume III. of the series Der Quell des Wissens ^ (Psychology\ncontains an excellent study by Count von Klinckowstroem on\nOccultism.\" The Count has succeeded\u2014which is almost a tour\nde force\u2014in compressing the whole subject into twenty-one pages.\nThe author's [standpoint is very negative as to physical pheno-\nmena : still he says, [a propos of Willy Schneider, that Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing's experiments with this medium afiord us for\nthe first time the hope that there may after all be paraphysical\nphenomena. I note what seems to me a slight error, in\nthe beginning of the \"chapter\" on \"paraphysical\" phenomena.\nParapsychical phenomena, Count Klinckowstroem says, date back\nfar into the history of mankind, whilst physical phenomena seem\nto be an invention of the nineteenth century and of the American\nfraudulent mediums. The long series of Poltergeist cases extend-\ning through two or three centuries, and long before the HydesviHe\nor Rochester knockings, seems to me to refute the Count's assertion.\nI think it would not be difficult to maintain the opposite point\nof view, viz. that the Fox sisters and other American mediums\ndid \" innovate \" not so much in the physical as in the psycho-\nlogical and intellectual domain, and in fact it cannot be denied\nthat automatic writing for instance, at least automatic writing\nsystematized and on a wide scale, begins only after 1843.\nMercure de France, September 15, 1927. M. Rene Sudxe\nanalyses in detail Professor Hans Thirring's Position of Science in\nrelation to Psychical Research, printed in No. 6 of The British\nJournal of Psychical Research. Readers of that paper will re-\nmember that it was WiUy Schneider who was instrumental in\nbringing about the distinguished Austrian physicist's conversion\nto belief in telekinesis.\nM. Sudre then briefly relates a sitting of his own with Rudi\nSchneider at Braunau, which gave him every satisfaction. (Cf.\nthe July number of The Journal of the American S.P.R.) The\nmanifestation which struck him most was the materialisation in\nred light of a hand having the perfect appearance of a human\nhand {minus two fingers) and endowed with \" extraordinary\nagdity.\" This hand's contact gave one the impression of a\n\" chamois glove,\" a remark which may possibly afford more\nmaterial for reflection than jM. Sudre thinks. I need not point\n-out that from the evidential standpoint such seances in the\njnedium\"s family circle are of small value. P. P.

He suggests other\nexplanations, and virtually implies that to get rigorous proof\nof survival by cross-correspondence one would need something\nmuch more stringent,\u2014something akin to a person in China\nwho knew nothing of Europe wTiting a European message,\nunintelligible except to one particular individual, who on his\npart should at the same moment, or at least on the same\nday, get a precisely similar message, both purporting to come\nfrom the same deceased person, and both involving one and\nthe same meaningless array of letters and numbers. Let us\nsuppose that such a thing was accomplished, what would\nhappen ? Suppose a Chinese gentleman were to find his hand\nwriting what to him would be utter gibberish, how long would\nthat script be able to escape the wastepaper basket, if they\nhave such things in China ? Furthermore, if the scripts\ndesired by Mr. Hall were both produced, and did both escape\ndestruction, and if they were brought together and submitted\nto some British Museum or Royal Society expert, would he or\nanyone be likely to jump to the singular conclusion that they\nproved survival ! Would he not regard them as evidence of\nobvious collusion ?\nIt seems to me that an irrefragable proof of survival is\nimobtainable, and that it is a mistake to lay down conditions\nsuch as there is no hope of satisfying, and to say that if\nsuch conditions were satisfied they would constitute the irre-\nfragable proof desired. In a laboratory we are not accus-\ntomed to dictate to phenomena, but to accept what we find,\n^Proc. S.P.R. Vol. xxxvi, p. 4.55.

Most of the discoveries that have been made\nhave been inspired in the first instance by such vague and\ntransient hints that only a man of genius could learn any-\nthing from them, or even pay attention to them : most people\nwould not notice their existence.\nI suggest that Mr. Piddington's treatment of cross-corre-\nspondences is in accordance with ordinary scientific procedure.\nBut we may be grateful to Mr. Hall for taking the trouble\nto experiment with his friends as to the kind of literary hotch-\npotch which would be stimulated by the bare outline of a\ntheme suggested to people of fairly wide reading.\nTHE PRESENT STATUS OF DOWSING IN\nTHE BRITISH PRESS.\nBy Theodoee Besterman.\nIt has been said more than once (most recently and judiciously\nby Mr. Piddington ^) that the verdict awaited by the worker in\npsychical research is not that of the specialist in any orthodox\nscience, but that of the intelligent man in the street, the\nverdict, in short, of Dr. Broad's \" enlightened common sense.''\nAnd it will no doubt be generally agreed, however cynical a\nview one may take of the ethical standards of the Press,\nthat the writers in our general newspapers do fairly accvirately\nrepresent the trend of public opinion in neutral and non-\npolitical matters. I have therefore attempted the following\nanalysis of newspaper opinion on a single specific subject\nstudied by psychical research, namely, dowsing.\nThe passages examined are all the reviews that have reached\nme of a recent book on this subject, with the exception of\nsix reviews in periodicals (such as Light and The Occult Re-\nview), which might be considered prejudiced.

Concerning Me. Piddington's \" One Crowded Hour of\nGlorious Life.\"\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014While reading Mr. Piddington's original paper ^ I\nexperienced a concomitant feeling of surmise (Can Cross-corre-\nspondences provide evidence for survival ? etc. ^). The surmise\nseemed pertinent ; and it seemed probable that other readers\nmight have experienced a similar feeling coinciding in time with\ntheir perusal of that paper. These reflections I expressed at\nrather less length in the words, \" These are the questions which\nMr. Piddington's article raises.\" Is it not gratuitous to suppose\nthat other readers can have confused this with the totally dif-\nferent statement, \" Mr. Piddington has raised these questions \" ?\nNevertheless, had I in fact been concerned specifically with his\npersonal opinions, as expressed in his paper, I should still (though\nof course in a different form) have been supporting a normal\nagainst a supernormal explanation ; for Mr. Piddington finds\nhimseU \" unable to resist the conclusion that many of the coinci-\ndences . . . are due to some one's intelligent design \"\n(p. 346).\nIt would occupy too much space to recite the abundant evidence\nthat other sentences in my criticism failed to convey their mean-\ning to Mr. Piddington.\nIn his reply to me (Vol. xxxvi, p. 471) Mr. Piddington repeats\nwords which in his original paper had already amazed me. He\ndeclares that he prefers a supernormal to a normal explanation, unless\nthe normal explanation can be set forth in detail. I can only reply\nthat I prefer a normal explanation where one is possible : and\n1 Proc. S.P.R. Vol. xxxvi, p. 345. ^ proc. S.P.R.

To test the scope of associations in\nautomatic scripts we must work with automatists themselves.\nNow, would not an experimenter, faced with this very difficult\ntask, find himself forced to adopt conditions closely similar to those\nin the \" Crowded Hour \" ? The object of an experiment being\nresults, he would choose conditions favourable to results. That\nhis automatists should possess similar mental contents is, of course,\na sine qua non. This means, practically, that they should share\ncommon habits of life and thought. A further desideratum would\nbe a commonly shared emotional belief or attitude towards life,\nsince emotion appears to be an important factor in determining\nthe direction of subconscious trains of thought. His chief diffi-\nculty would be in finding a method of supplying a common\n\" starting point.\" We all know how to supply a stimulus in an\nordinary association test ; but who knows what is palatable to\nthe \" automatic \" mind 1 or how to feed that mind at all\nWould not the experimenter probably fall back on the plan of\nmaking his automatists supply their own stimulus by allowing\nthem to circularise (shall I say when the spirit moved them ?)\noccasional extracts from their own scripts ?\nAre not these very much like the conditions in the \"Crowded\nHour\"? And had the object of the \"Crowded Hour\" experiment\nactually been the testing of associations, would Mr. Piddington\nhave regarded the correspondences as positive results ? or would\nhe have declared the experiment spoiled owing to unpremeditated\ninterference ab extra ?\nA.

Two Personal Experiences.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014The following cases may be of interest as illustrations\nof telepathy of sorts :\nI may say that, so far as I am aware, I am not exceptionally\n\fDecember, 1927 Correspondence lo7\npsychic, nor have I gone into much experimental investigation of\nspiritualism or kindred subjects.\n(a) Some years ago I used to keep bees, but on account of\nnot having sufficient leisure to attend to them properly, I had to\ngive them up, but have always retained my interest in their\nnatural history and management. It is, however, necessary for\nme to state that I have never contemplated nor entertained any\nidea of again becoming a bee-keeper.\nOn the 8th of last month (July, 1927), I was spending the day\nat Westward Ho ! which is about five miles away as the crow\nflies, and at just about mid-day was looking at some bees on\nblackberry blossoms growing in a lane there, when the thought\ncame suddenly into my mind in a most forcible manner :\n\u2014\" Why\nnot keep bees again ?\n\"\u2014and this kept dwelling in my thoughts\nfor some time, to the exclusion of everything else. When I\nreturned home to Great Torrington in the evening, I was told\nthat a swarm of bees had settled in my garden, and they had\nbeen \"shaken\" and taken away. The time at which the swarm had\narrived was just mid-day.\nI enclose a corroborative statement from Miss Dorothy Green,\nwho was in charge of our house whilst my wife and I were at\nWestward Ho !\nAug. 18, 1927.\nOn Friday morning the 8th of July last Mr. and Mrs. Doe\nhad gone to Westward Ho ! leaving me in charge of their\nhouse \" Enfield,\" Great Torrington. At as near about 12\nnoon as I can judge, I saw a swarm of bees come and settle\nin a Standard Climbing Rose Bush on the Lawn in front of\nthe house.\nI let them pitch there, and in the afternoon sent to a\ngardener who keeps bees, and he came with a box and\nshook the bees into it and took them away.\nDoBOTHY Green.\n(&) One night, whilst in my home in Great Torrington, I\ndreamt that I was in Fleet Street in London, and I went into\na jeweller's shop there with the watch which I was wearing and\ngot it exchanged for another with a peculiar face and hands,\nwhich very much attracted my fancy. On coming out of the\nshop, and taking the new watch out of my pocket to have a\n\f158 '\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1927\nlook at it, I found tliat it was a complete fraud, consisting of\nnothing but a face and hands, without any works inside. I\nthen woke up, probably from the shock of my discovery, but soon\ndropped off to sleep again, but not before I had distinctly heard\na clock in the house strike 12 o'clock. In the morning I went\nto my office as usual, without any further thought of my dream,\nand at mid-day, I took out my watch to see whether it was\nlunch time, but as it stood at 12 o'clock exactly, I resumed my\nwriting. After some time I again looked at the watch, and then,\nfor the first time found that it had stopped at 12, presumably\nthe preceding midnight, when I had my dream. I usually keep\nmy watch during the night a little distance from my bed, but\nthe distance may have been short enough for me to have heard\nit ticking, and I may, therefore, have subconsciously noted that\nit had stopped, and hence my dream.\nGeorge M.

Ed.]\nREVIEWS.\nI. Mind and Body, A Criticism of Psychophysical Parallelism. By\nHans Driesch. Authorized Translation with a Bibliography\nof the Author by Theodore Besterman. Methuen & Co.,\nLondon, 1927. Pp. xviii, 163. 63. net.\nThis is a translation, under the author's supervision, of the third\nedition of a work first published in 1916, and Prof. Driesch has\nalso added a short preface to it. In it he explains that he con-\nsiders normal psychology to be sufficient to refute psychophysical\nparallelism and to establish the theory of interaction, and has\ntherefore \" left out all '\nabnormal ' phenomena,\" although his\n\" personal conviction is that abnormal phenomena, and psychical\nresearch in particular, is the most important part of all psycho-\nlogy.\"\nBearing in mind this self-imposed limitation, the gist of Prof.\nDriesch's argument may be stated as follows, in his own words\n(pp. 94-5). \" The physical thing consists of very few elements,\n\fDecember, 1927 Reviews 159\nand perjiaps of only one ; the mental '\nthing '\ncomprises a large\nnumber of difierent kinds of psychical '\nelements.' And besides we\nsee that in the physical all relations between the elements, apart\nfrom their capacity for action consist of variations of the relation\nnear ;\namong the psychical elements, on the other hand, there\nexists a great variety of difierent kinds of relations, and relations\nnot only of meaning, but also of the kinds of connexion. How\nthen can the mental thing find its '\nparallel representative '\nin the\nrealm of physical things ? Such a representative seems to be\nquite impossible. For it is a logical contradiction to assume that\ntwo things, one of which is of quite a difierent degree and kind\nof manifoldness than the other, can be ultimately the same\u2014and\nsuch is the teaching of parallelism. It is thus unthinkable that\na given condition of the brain, which is in fact a given material\nthing, is '\non the other side '\na mental thing, that is, a given\nmental experience-content. . . . Thus ordo et connexio rerum can\nnot be idem as ordo et connexio idearmn, because the structure of\nthe particular res is wholly difi:erent from the structure of the\nparticular idea, in every respect, and most especially with regard\nto the degree of manifoldness.\"\nOn this argument it may be remarked, first, that it attacks\npsychophysical parallelism as a dogma about the relation of body\nto mind, and does not touch it when it is merely conceived (more\nreasonably) as a principle of metJiod. Secondly, it rests on the\nbelief that the physical and the mental may both be analysed\ninto \" elements,\" and is exposed to all the difficulties which this\nnotion involves. Thirdly, even if it is accepted as it stands, it\nis difficult to see that it proves as much as Prof. Driesch claims\nfor it. It hardly follows that psychophysical parallelism is\n\" impossible.\" All that can be said to have been shown is that\nparallelism renders meaningless a gTeat deal of psychical variety.\nThis renders it seriously objectionable, but hardly impossible.\nFourthly, Prof. Driesch's negative criticism evidently needs to be\nsupplemented by a positive account of the function which the\nphysical performs for the mental : this account, moreover, must\nnot, in affirming the reality of the mental, render the physical\nmeaningless in its turn. Lastly, Prof. Driesch's argument is so\ntechnical that it is hardly likely to commend itself to the plain\nman, and so to dispose of parallelism in practice. Something\nsimpler and more \" einleuchtend \" would seem to be required.\n\fI(j0 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decejiber, 1927\nNow this can, it seems, be obtained from the \" transmission\n\"\nview of the function of body in relation to mind, which used to\nbe advocated by William James, but is not mentioned by Prof.\nDriesch.\nMr. Besterman's translation reads well, though it has a few\nmisprints and errors. Thus on p. 2 the printing of \" mental\n\"\nfor \" physical \" in line 7 makes nonsense of the argument. On\np. 92 \" Evidenz \" should have been translated \" self-evidence,\"\nnot \" evidence,\" which has acquired a different meaning in English.\nThere are misprints on pages 14 and 91 (\" der \" for \" des \").\nI have been unable to detect on what principle the bibliography\nis ordered : it begins with an item from 1905 and ends with one\nfrom 1910, while extending from 1890 to 1927. One result is\nthat a chronological \" key \" has had to be added to it.\nF. C. S. S.\nII. The Divinity in Man. By John W. Graham, M.A., D.Litt.\nGeorge Allen & Unwin, Ltd. 10s. 6d. net.\nThis book elaborates and develops the thoughts in the first\nbook of the author's earlier work, The Faith of a Quaker.^ The\nname of the author will commend this new volume to a wide\ncircle of readers, including many who do not belong to the\nSociety of Friends. It consists of a series of lectures on a number\nof different subjects, all of interest to the student of mystical\nreligion. Writing from the standpoint of one who bases his\nfaith on experience rather than authority, the author handles his\nmaterial in a scientific temper which will appeal to the student\nof psychical research.\nA complete summary of the book would be out of place in\ntliis review, and the following comments are directed to those\nportions which bear upon the work of the Society.\nThe first five chapters deal with tlie Nature of God, and the\nproblems involved are mostly outside the scope of psychical\nresearch. Mention must be made of the author's theory of\nPrayer, on account of the use he makes of the fact of telepathy.\nHe recognizes two types, the receptive prayer, whereby the soul\n\" draws upon the energy of God \" (p. 42), and the transmissive\nprayer, the object of which may be another person. Of the\n1 Reviewed in the S.P.R. Journal for Dec, 1920.\n\fDecember, 1927 Revietvs 1()1\nsecond type he says, \" These shooting darts of prayer sometimes\nappear, so far as we know, to strike their object direct, and then\nwe call them '\nthought transference,' though it is possible that\nthey may have passed through some spiritual centre, an '\nanswerer\nto prayer,' on the way \" (p. 41). It is clear from another\npassage that the author does not envisage any other than a\npersonal object, for he says, \" Natural forces, the subject-matter\nof physics and chemistry, biology and physiology, are not subject\nto a spiritual force like prayer, which has its own great sphere\nelsewhere \"\n(p. 65). If by \" thought transference \" Dr. Graham\nmeans the phenomena of telepathy generally, it must be borne\nin mind that \" moment of death \" incidents, for example, include\nnot only phantasms attributed to telepathy, but also, in rare\ncases, telekinetic phenomena (see e.g. Journal S.P.R., Vol. IX.,\npp. 280-84, cited by Myers, H.P. 868B ; also Proceedings S.P.B.,\nVol. VII., p. 154, cited by Myers, H.P. 925A). This suggests that\nboth types of incident are due to some psychic force which may\nin some cases \" impinge \" on inanimate objects, though usually it\nproduces hallucinations. Moreover, the \" force \" is by no means\nalways voluntarily released, and often acts in a very bizarre and\npuzzling fashion. Prayer, on the other hand, is a consciously\ninitiated spiritual activity. It has its own treasury of experiences,\nand is hardly to be identiiied, in any of its forms, with thought\ntransference, whether spontaneous or experimental.\nIn Chapters VI. (on the Subliminal Man) and VII. (on Inspira-\ntion) the author passes on to explore \" the human side, the\norgan of Religion in Man.\" Here he takes Human Personality as\nhis guide, \" a book,\" he says, \" likely to fill, I believe, a place\nanalogous to that of T?ie Origin of Species in human thought. . .\n.\"\nAn outline of the steps which led up to the formation of The\nSociety for Psychical Research (of which the author has long been\na member) is followed by an appreciative description of its method.\nThe main argument of both chapters proceeds on lines familiar\nto readers of Frederic Myers' work, and need not be recapitulated\nhere.\nChapter VIII. is a lecture on Plotinus. Many students of\npsychical research will be grateful for this valuable summary of\nthe teaching of a philosopher who exercised so considerable an\ninfluence over the mind of Frederic Myers. It is questionable,\nhowever, whether so much space should have been devoted to\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research decembeu, 1927\nthe stories wliicti Porphyry tells us to emphasize the superior\npsychical powers of his master. The reader, despite warnings to\nadopt a critical attitude, is left with the impression that there\nmay have been mysterious forces at work. But with the excep-\ntion of the story of the telepathic impression which Plotinus\nreceived of Porphyry's intention to commit suicide, verified at the\ntime, and told us \" first hand \" by Porphyry himself, none of\nthem is worth relating, except to illustrate contemporary beliefs,\nor Plotinus' attitude towards them. The story of the evocation\nof Plotinus' familiar spirit by the Egyptian priest is open to the\ngravest suspicion. The conduct of the priest is consistent with\nhis having used two methods of decej^tion well known to fraudulent\nmediums in all ages. First, the place for the \" seance \" was\n\" forced \" on Plotinus and his friends, on the ground that the\ntemple of Isis was the only pure place that could be found in\nPome. Secondly, just after the apparition had appeared, and\nbefore anyone could question it, the priest's \" friend \" caused a\ndiversion by \" strangling the birds,\" and no doubt misdirected\nthe attention of the onlookers for a precious moment or two\nwhile the \" apparition \" disappeared.\nThe remaining eight chapters are mainly concerned with the\nhistory, thought and practice of the Society of Friends. The\nstudent of psychical research will be interested in the chapter on\nthe subliminal self of George Fox, but he may find difficulty\nin accepting several of the interpretations placed upon George\nFox's \" premonitory \" visions. Fox, like many other religious\ngeniuses, often had visions of terrifying or catastrophic events,\nand it is fatally easy to find such visions \" verified \" in the light\nof after events, of which they were not genuine premonitions at\nall. When the visions are symbolic, the risk of misinterpretation\nis greatly increased. Both the nature and symbolism of such\nvisions are probably due to psychological causes, and the hypo-\nthesis of prevision should only be invoked when all others have\nfailed. On the pitfalls attending those who handle \" prophetic\n\"\nmaterial, the reader should consult Father Thurston's little work,\nThe War and the Prophets (Burns and Gates, 1915).\nG. W.

Januaky, 1928\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nCASE.\nL. 1282. A Name given in Automatic Writing.\nWe have received the following account of a personal experi-\nence from Miss Nea Walker, a Member of this Society and\nSecretary to Sir OKver Lodge. The incident occurred in the\nfollowing circmnstances : in the spring and early summer of\nlast year Dr. Howard Warner, a medical practitioner, had\nsome sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott, the appointments\nhaving been made for him anonymously by Miss Walker.\nMiss Walker has for some time been in the habit of making\nappointments for sitters in this way, and it is important to\nnote that she had never met Dr. Warner and the whole of\nthe correspondence which had passed between them up to\nthe time of the incident here recorded has been shown to\nthe Editor, j\\'Irs. Salter. Statements on this point from Miss\nWalker and from Mrs. Salter are printed below.\nOn October 8th, 1927, Dr. Warner sent to Miss Walker\nsome notebooks containing the record of his sittings with Mrs.\nWarren Elhott, saying he should value any comments she\nmight make on them. On October 14th, Miss Walker replied\nat some length ; the main part of her letter consists in a\ndiscussion of Dr. Warner's records, the only part of it which\nconcerns us here is the postscript\n:\nP.S. Has a word or a name, Levey, anything to do with\nyou ? I don't suppose so, but while I was reading your notes,\nI noticed that someone from \" over there \" was apparently near, and\nI picked up a pencil expecting the name of one of the Group,\nif anything. It simply wrote what looks Uke the above word.\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1928\nI thought nothing of it, thinking it a muddle and just my mind f\nworking. Then, as I read on, I came to the fact that one of\nyour wife's initials was L. [Dr. Warner's wife was the purporting\ncommunicator at his sittings.] So I feel I had better tell you,\nthough it does not seem to me at all likely to connect, and to\nbe much more likely to be something out of my mind which did\nnot develop. I wasn't paying much attention and was going on\nreading, and I have not a strong faculty, it is only in fits and\nstarts that I ever get anj^hing evidential. A sort of comfort\nfrom a sense of \" their \" presence without being able to distin-\nguish any individual, is what I get.\nTo this letter Dr. Warner replied as follows on October 15th,\n1927:\n. . . Your postscript in which you very evidently placed no\nfaith has knocked me \" all of a heap \" and only goes to show\nhow they are trying by every means to re-assure us. My dear\nwife had two only very special friends in girlhood both of whom\nshe kept up with after marriage though at a distance. One was\nnamed Levey (as you say and not a common name).^ She married\nan Austrian Count and went to live in Silesia before the war\nand of course during the war correspondence was impossible.\nWe often spoke of her and wondered if she was still alive, as I\nbelieve the \" Russian steamroller \" was pretty active there early\nin the war. My wife would know that I should recognize the\nname I am sure, and as it came while you were reading her\nmessages surely it was another attempt to communicate . . .\nHoward Warner.\nOn October 28th, Miss Walker wrote to Dr. Warner saying\nthat Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, to whom she had mentioned the\nincident, thought it worth recording in the S.P.R. Journal.\nShe asked Dr. Warner whether he would have any objection\nto this and also whether he could say what had become of\nhis wife's friend, or alternatively would state that he had no\ninformation on this point. In reply to this letter Dr. Warner\nwrote as follows :\n1 It is worth noting that the name Levey (so spelt) occurs only 21 times\nin the London Telephone Directory, as compared with 424 occurrences of\n\u2022\"\nLevy,\" and about 2400 occurrences of \" Smith.\"\n\fJanuary, 1928 Case 171\n2Wi October.\n... Re the Levey \" episode by all means use it and with-hold\nnothing, I often think it is such a pity that what evidence we\ndo receive should be mutilated, as it often is, because people\nwill not have the courage of their convictions. As far as I can\ntell you the name \" Levey \" has not been in my thoughts for\n6 or 7 years, it is 20 years since I saw her, but my wife used\nto speak about her and wonder how she was getting on (before\nmy wife passed on in 1920). \" Levey \" was the maiden name of\nher friend and before marriage she and my wife were very dear\nfriends and I used to hear a lot about her. I know nothing\nabout her now and cannot find out anything . . .\nIf you think the \" cricket shoe episode \" in notes of my sitting\nwith Mrs. Warren Elliott is worth publishing, I will gladly write\nit up. It is difficult to see how this could be explained by\ntelepathy from the living and you have seen the bill from the\nschool bootmaker verifying the supply of the shoes . . .\nHoward Warner.\nIn sending to the Society her record of the \" Levey \" incident\nMiss Walker wrote to the Secretary, Miss Newton, as follows :\nNovember 17, 1927.\n\" Levey \" Episode.\nThe enclosed correspondence with Dr. Warner, of Fakenham,\nNorfolk, will explain to you why I head my letter thus . . .\nThe only comment I think you would ask from me is in con-\nnexion with the little bit of script (one word) I got and which began the\ntale. What makes me, of late years at any rate, pick up a pencil\nthinking \" someone \" may be wishing to send a message, is\nalways a feeling of having been touched. The \" touch \"\u2014I don't\nknow what else to call it\u2014mostly occurs on my right cheek,\nabout the cheekbone. It is cold, slightly prickly (this not always),\nand there is a feeling of suction. I do not know if you have\n\u00abver noticed boys playing with little hollow india-rubber things\ntied to a string, which seem to stick to the pavement ? I haven't\nseen them for years, and don't know what they are called ; but when\nI feel this touch it reminds me of those toys,\u2014I can only suppose\nbecause there is a feeling of suction and hollowness, and a sort\nof rubberlike coldness. If I feel the touch on my head instead\n\f172 JournaL of Society for Psychical Research January, 1928\nof on my cheek, it feels like rubber fingers filled with something,\nthe suction is gone. And sometimes it is only a kind of tickling\nsensation across the top of the head. If the room is quiet, there\nis sometimes a kind of buzzing noise ;\nor, at other times, something\nwhich sounds like a very distant telephone conversation in a\nrather high key, no words distinguishable. One, or a combination,\nof these sounds and feelings is what starts me thinking \" some-\none \" has come. And it was that suction-touch which led to\nmy taking ujj a pencil on the day when, you will see, I got the\nname Levey while reading notes of sittings which Dr. Warner had\nhad with Mrs. Warren Elliott . . . Nea Walker.\nWith the other documents relating to the case Miss Walker\nsent to the Society the original script. It is headed in Miss\nWalker's writing as follows :\nWhile reading Dr. Warner's notes, 14th Oct., 1927, felt some one\nand got this, before I reached fact that L was an initial.\nThis note was added by Miss Walker when she discovered\nin the course of reading Dr. Warner's record of the sittings\nthat L was an initial of his wife's. The original script con-\nsists of the single word \" levey,\" faintly but clearly written.\nIn reply to an enquiry from Mrs. Salter as to what evidence\nthere was that Miss Walker could not have derived a know-\nledge of there being some connexion between Dr. Warner and\nthe name Levey from any normal source, Miss Walker wrote\nas follows :\nDec. 8th, 1927.\nYou ask whether I can show that I could not have known\nnormally of a connexion between Dr. Warner and the name\nLevey which came in my script.\nI think I can do that quite satisfactorily.\nI have never met Dr. Warner, so that it could not have\nshpped out in conversation.\nI have all his letters to me, and copies of mine to him. He\nfirst wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge for help, on hearing the paper\nwhich was read at the S.P.R. on the White Case. The letter\n(date, 11. November, 1925), came on to me in the usual course of\nevents. I replied, and a few letters passed between us then\n;\nand since then, at intervals of several months, we have corres-\n\fJantjart, 1928 Case 173\nponded. But Dr. Warner only -wTote when lie had questions to\nask on mediumship, its development, etc., or when, this spring\nand summer, he wished me to make anonymous appointments\nfor him.\nI will enclose the whole correspondence, so that you may see\nthat my answer is fair.\nI ought perhaps also to say that there was nothing in the\nrecords or annotations of the sittings (which I saw, for the first\nand only time, in October, 1927), giving any connexion with the\nname Levey. In fact the word was written before I saw that\n\" L \" was an initial belonging to Dr. Warner's communicator.\nNea Walker.\nIn corroboration of Miss Walker's statement ]\\Irs. Salter\nwrites thus :\nDecember, 11, 1927.\nI have read the whole of the correspondence between iliss\nWalker and Dr. Warner referred to in her letter of Dec. 8th,\n1927. It covers a period from November 11th, 1925, when Dr.\nWarner first wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge, saying he would like to\nhave a sitting with a medium, to October 6th, 1927.\nI have found nothing in this correspondence which might have\nsuggested to j\\Iiss Walker that the name Levey had any con-\nnexion with or interest for Dr. Warner. H. r>E G. Salter.\nConcerning the \" cricket-shoe \" episode referred to above,\nDr. Warner wrote to Mrs. Salter as follows :\n2nd. December, 1927.\nMiss Nea Walker has sent me on your letter and I am very\nglad you think our two little bits of \" proof \" are worth publica-\ntion . . .\nI have fuU notes of my three sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott,\nthey were very good but of course the vast bulk of true state-\nments are capable of the telepathy explanation, the case I am\nrelating is not. Howabd Warner.\nWith this letter Dr. Warner enclosed the following state-\nment :\n2nd December, 1927.\nMy wife passed over in 1920 and the following episode occurred\nat the second of these sittings I had this year with Mrs. Warren\n\f174 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1928\nEllliott. The sitting was on June 2, at Mrs. Elliott's house, at\n3.30 p.m. and only Mrs. Elliott and myself were present. I took\nnotes of what \" Topsy \" [Mrs. Warren Elliott's \" control \"] said.\nThese sittings were kindly arranged for me by Miss Nea Walker\nand the medium had no knowledge of me whatever beyond the\nfact that I was due for a sitting on June 2, at 3.30 ; even now\nshe does not even know my name.\nAfter many statements which though perfectly true, were capable\nof explanation on the hypothesis of telepathy from myself to the\nmedium, \" Topsy \" said :\nYou are daddy to this lady's children . . . The boy is a real\nman, she (my wife) says. He very excited about some\nsport or game. You bought him something new for sport.\nExcited. Is it boots ? Heavy boots. White boots. Not\nwhite now, black now, she says (with a laugh).\nI have two children, a son and a daughter, and my son aged 13\nhad returned to boarding school at the beginning of May, I had\ncertainly not bought him any white boots, to do with games,\nbefore his return to school and I did not know of any having been\nbought for him subsequently.\nThe first information I had to show that the statement was\nviridical was on July 26 when I received a bill (which I enclose)\nfrom the school boot maker showing that on May 6th the school\nauthorities had ordered him a pair of cricket shoes, nailed. My\nson had not mentioned this in any letter and I had not seen him\nsince his return to school. The shoes certainly were rather black\nthan white by the time he returned home for the holidays.\nThe bill enclosed was for a pair of cricket shoes for \" Master\nWarner \" and is dated. May 6, 1927.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. \" The Master Builder.\"\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nOctober 15, 1927.\nDear Madam,\u2014Mr. Piddington's notable article on the Master\nBuilder cross-correspondence suggests a few comments, which,\nthough belated, may I think help a little to elucidate the problem.\n\fJakuart, 1928 Correspondence 175\n(1) Is not the fall of Oedipus referred to, as well as that of\nthe Sphinx ? Mr. Piddington remarks (p. 499) \" Oedipus was\npresumptuous neither towards man nor God.\" But Sophocles\nclearly intended him to be an example of v\/3pis. Gp. the com-\nment of the Chorus (O.T. 873 ff.) J'\/ipts (f^vreveu rvpavvov {'>\/3pis . .\n.\nuKporara ^yt'ur' dva\/Saa' *u7roT\/^oTarai' wpovcrev tis dvdyi<a\\'. (\" Insol-\nence breeds the tyrant ;\nInsolence . . . when it hath scaled the\ntopmost ramparts, is hurled to a dire doom!\" Jebb.) \"The\ntone of Oedipus towards Creon (esp. 618-672),\" observes Jebb,\n\" suggests the strain of warning rebuke.\" Even more, perhaps,\nhis outrageous treatment of Apollo's prophet Teiresias. If this\nwas not exactly to \"usurp the place of God\", it was to defy\nGod, and the doom of the insolent man, hurled down at the\nmoment of apparent triumph is closely parallel with those of\nSatan and Solness. The idea of destiny seems to be prominent\nin all three stories. Cp. Mrs. King's scripts, 460 (E) and 509.\n(2) May not \" book four \" in E refer to Paradise Regained,\niv., which contains the narrative of the temptation on the pinnacle\nof the temple, and the allusion to Oedipus ?\n(3)\n\" Epithalamium \" (C and G). Is it too fanciful to regard\nthe \" mighty song \" which Hilda heard in the final scene as not\nmerely Solness' defiant declaration, but a kind of epithalamium\ncelebrating the achievement of his spiritual union with her, whom\nhe intended to embrace on his descent? \"Greeting\" (in G),\nrefers plainly, I think, to the gesture of greeting which Hilda\nsees Solness make from the tower, and the greeting which she\ngives in return.\n(4) A \" cornerstone \" is no doubt generally a foundation-\nstone (p. 494), but sometimes, I think, the apex of a building,\ne.g. in Psalm cxviii, 22 :\n\" the head stone of the corner \" (a passage\nquoted five times in the N.T.). Cp. Zech. iv, 7 : \"he shall bring\nforth the headstone thereof with shoutings,\" also Job, xxxviii, 6f.\nCf. :\n\" Who laid the corner stone thereof [of the earth], when\nthe morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted\nfor joy ?\n\"\nYours faithfully,\nA. B. GouGH.\nMr. Piddington writes in reply :\nI should like to thank Dr. Gough for his remarks on my paper,\nwhich I have read with real interest even when I dissent from them.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Januaey, 1928\nIn view of the reference Dr. Gough gives to Soph., Oed. Tyr.,\n873, I admit that my statement that Oedipus was presumptuous\nneither towards man nor God needs toning down.\nThere is nothing, however, to show that the scripts under\ndiscussion allude to this particular passage in the Oedipus Tyrannus :\non the contrary, Mrs. Salter's script explicitly, and Mrs. King's\nscript implicitly, refer to the guessing of the Sphinx's riddle by\nOedipus. Hence I cannot agree that the scripts intend to give\nOedipus as an example of \" the doom of the insolent man,\nhurled down at the moment of apparent triumph,\" like Satan\nand Solness. And Dr. Gough's suggestion to this effect seems to\nme to be open to two other objections. In the first place, it\nwould represent Oedipus as himself falling and in the same\nbreath as the causer of another's (the Sphinx's) fall. And in\nthe second place, it would equate a purely metaphorical \" fall\n\"\n(i.e. the fall of Oedipus) with the falls of Mulciber, Satan, and\nMaster Builder Solness, which are all depicted as real falls.\nI think it quite likely that \" book four \" in Mrs. King's script\nis meant for Book IV. of Paradise Reyained.\nI also think Dr. Gough's suggestion about \" Epithalamium\n\"\nnot at aU unlikely ; and I had thought of saying something\non much the same lines. But I deliberately refrained from\ndoing so, because experience has taught me that it is\nunwise to press interpretation beyond a certain point, critics being\nonly too ready to pounce upon interpretations put forward tenta-\ntively, and to pull them to pieces as though they had been ad-\nvanced in a positive manner and as essential to the case.\nAs regards the possibility of \" cornerstone \" being used with\nreference, not to the foundation, but to the completion of a\nbuilding, I may say that before commenting on the \" corner-\nstone \" references in Mrs. King's and Mrs. Salter's scripts, I looked\nup the Biblical passages where the word occurs, and, though\naware that some commentators give it the meaning that Dr.\nGough suggests it should bear in the scripts, decided to stick to\nthe usual sense of the word. I did so partly because it is the\nusual sense, and partly because in one of Mrs. King's scripts\n(not quoted in my paper )\" cornerstones \" is very clearly used in\nits usual sense, as follows\n:\n\" We must lay the foundations very sure\u2014-no high reaching\n\fJanuary, 1928 Correspondence 177\ntemples yet, but long and patient setting of the cornerstones\u2014the\nfabric must stand secure.\"\nWith \" setting of the cornerstones \" here compare \" The corner-\nstone of the building is set\" in King, 737 (the script quoted in\nmy paper).\nI take this opportunity to touch on another point connected\nwith the \" Master Builder \" cross-correspondence.\nIn my comments on \" Verify reference to Oedipus in 0\\dd\n\"\nin one of Mrs. King's scripts, I said that the only personal\nreference to Oedipus in Ovid that I could trace was one in Met.\nVII., 759-761, where an allusion is made to his guessing of the\nSphinx's riddle and to the consequent fall of the Sphinx. I\nwas very careful to abstain from claiming that this is the one\nand only reference to Oedipus in Ovid, though \"prepared to\nassert \" that \" if there are other references, they must be exceed-\ningly rare.\" I am indebted to Mr. W. W. Grundy, Professor of\nLatin in Cardiff University, for drawing my attention to a per-\nsonal reference to Oedipus in 11. 259-260 of the Ibis. The lUs is\ngenerally attributed to Ovid, and I should say\u2014though my\nopinion on such a point is of little value\u2014is rightly so attributed.\nThe reference is as follows :\nNec plus aspicias, quam quern sua filia rexit,\nExpertus scelus est cuius uterque parens.\nThe author is raining down curses on some one who has slandered\nhim, and prays that the slanderer may become as \"blind as the\nman whom his daughter led [i.e. Oedipus, who when blind was\nled about by his daughter Antigone], and whose sin both his\nparents [i.e. Laius and Jocasta] experienced to their cost.\"\nJ.

For instance, how far, if at all,\ncan we attribute the remarkable philological knowledge implied\nin the compositions of \" Patience Worth to the operations\n\fJanuary, 1928 Reviews 179\nof Mrs. Ciirran's subconsciousness, as distinct from her con-\nsciousness ?\n^\nA definitive answer to this question is, I think, to be found in\nthe book under j^reseut review. For Coleridge's Kuhla Khan is\nperhaps more frequently cited than any other human perform-\nance as an example of the creative powers of the subconscious-\nness. ^ Now, Dr. Lowes shows conclusively that every one of\nthose elements in Kuhla Khan which are so often described as\n\" typical of the subconsciousness,\" is, in fact, traceable to Cole-\nridge's previous reading. Dr. Lowes has written a long book,\nbut it is not a word too long for his task : his object and, it is\nimpossible to doubt, his achievement, cannot be summarised in\nany detail. The merest outline of his method (he applies it to\nThe Ancient Manner as well) must of necessity suffice.\nAs is well known, Coleridge's own account of the composition of\nKuhla Khan is that he fell asleep while reading the following\nwords in Purchases Pilgrimage :\n\" Here the Khan Kubla commanded\na palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto. And thus\nten miles of fertile grounds were inclosed with a Avail.\" He\nslept for three hours, woke with the conviction that he had in\nhis sleep composed two to three hundred lines, set pen to paper,\nand had written the fragment of fifty odd lines known to us'\nwhen he was interrupted by the now legendary \" person on\nbusiness from Porlock.\" Now, the quoted passage from the\nPilgrimage (even in its correct form) accounts for only the barest\nbones of the poem. But Dr. Lowes has made an exhaustive\nstudy of the books known to have been read by Coleridge. And\nreasoning from these, he shows how the words in the Pilgrimage\ncalled up in Coleridge's mind (unconsciously, of course) a similar\npassage in Purchas's Pilgrimes. This new passage is found to\nsupply the origins of further elements in the poem, and in turn\nleads to a third passage, which is equally useful. Then, con-\ntemporary entries in Coleridge's note-book opens up (at any rate,\nto Dr. Lowes's omniscience) further vistas of the same kind. The\nconclusion of it all -has already been stated : almost every unusual\nor dream-like \" idea or expression in the poem is shown to be\nderived from some passage or other proved (in most cases, ren-\ndered probable in the others), to have been read bv Coleridge.\niCp.

(November 1927), xxxvi. 575.\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1928\nIt must not be supposed, however, that Dr. Lowes imagines\nhimself to have \" explained \" the strange beauty of Kuhla Khan.\nFar from this, his strongest feeling on completing his infinitely\nlaborious task, is one of wonder at the nature of the genius that\nselected a score of casual sentences and transmuted them into a\nsingle expression of almost unalloyed beauty. But it must be\ngranted that Dr. Lowes has destroyed the claims of the sub-\nconsciousness to the possession of acquisitive powers distinct from\nthose of the consciousness, and that he has pushed the problem\nof genius one step further back into mystery. He is to be con-\ngratulated on having carried out a most difficult and delicate\nundertaking with the surest taste and with an unfaltering apprecia-\ntion of true values.\nTheodore Besterman.\nIL Hoiv to go to a Medium. By E. J. Dingwall, M.A., with a\nforeword by Maurice B. Wright, M.D., London, 1927. Kegan\nPaul, Trench, Trubner & Co. Pp. 98, 3s. 6d.\nIn his foreword Dr. Wright says \" This short book should be\nwidely read by all who are interested in the subjects of Psychical\nKesearch and . . . who are thinking of taking up the study of\nmediumistic phenomena.\" I agree, but, whether after its perusal\nan appreciable percentage of those \" who are interested \" will\ncontinue to \" think of taking up the study \" seems to me ex-\ntremely doubtful. In a useful little Introduction, Mr. Dingwall\nsets out in simple language the elements of the phenomena of\nautomatism by way of habituating beginners to the idea that\nbecause, say, a planchette writes without the conscious guidance\nof the operator, it does not follow that the performance is super-\nnatural or even supernormal. He then goes on to discuss the\nframe of mind in which a medium should be approached and\ngives very sound advice upon the method of recording the results.\nIn the body of the book he reviews the various forms of mental\nand physical phenomena, and provides as it were, a Manual of\nDeportment for the young (or green) Researcher. Thus, if a\nclairvoyant medium should say \"I see a gentleman standing by\nyou and hear the name John, I think it is your father,\" \" do\nnot,\" says Mr. Dingwall, \" as many sitters do, say '\nNo, it is my\ngrandfather,' . . . but something like this, '\nYes, go on, I should\nlike to hear some more about the gentleman,' \" a polite formula\n\fJanuaet, 1928 Reviews 181\nwhich must evidently be as gratifying to \" John \" as to the\nmedium.\nMr. Dingwall's experience has evidently led him to make a\nvery broad distinction between mental and physical mediums.\nOf the former he writes \"It is a mistake, in England at any\nrate, to suppose that all mental mediums attempt to gain know-\nledge surreptitiously about their clients. It is well-known that\ncertain of the best mediums discourage gossip even on the part\nof their own sitters as calculated to spoil their results. Whatever\nmay be the source of the correct information which is given\nthrough them, it is certainly not, in many cases, derived from\nenquiries made by the mediums or on their behalf.\" When,\nhowever, he turns to physical mediums, the tale is very different.\nHe describes the various forms taken by their phenomena, giving\nexcellent advice about how they should be investigated and what\nconclusions may safely be drawn from them. And interspersed\none finds this dismal litany. Of raps at sittings for table-turn-\ning : \"I have never heard what I consider to be a genuine\nrap at a sitting of this kind.\" Of lights : \"I have never yet\nseen what I consider to be genuine lights.\" Of telekinetic\nmovements of objects : \"At the present moment I am unable to\nindicate a single medium with whom these occurrences can be\nobserved under satisfactory conditions.\" Of materialization\n:\n\" The manifestations [at public circles when phenomena are\nexhibited on certain evenings at so much per head] are almost\ncertain to be fraudulent.\" Of slate writing :\n\" I have no good\nscientific evidence that any slate-writing has ever been genuine.\"\nIf, nevertheless, our young (or green) Eesearcher, undeterred by\nthe prospect of the waste of time and money involved by a\nsearch for what a person of Mr. Dingwall's experience has never\nyet found, decides to pursue his quest, he cannot do better than\nto accept his guidance. \" If you are in any serious difficulty,\"\nhe writes, \" and do not know where to obtain the information you\nrequire, the writer will do his best to reply, if a stamped envelope\nis enclosed.\" But after all, as Mr. Dingwall says, \"A fraudulent\nmedium is almost as interesting sometimes as a genuine one,\nespecially if the investigator is acquainted with the principles of\ndeception,\" so that even if one fails to find \" phenomena,\" one can\nat least count on finding very considerable entertainment.\nE.

Price 12s. 6d.\nThe author's aim in this book has been to examine the nature\nof human personality from various points of view, of which the\nmost important is that of psycho-analysis, or, as the author prefers\nto call it, deej) analysis. He brings forward much interesting\nmaterial, both experimental and theoretical, and gives a valuable\nsummary of the results so far reached by psycho-analysis, to-\ngether with the divergent lines of theory associated with the names\nof Freud, Adler and Jung respectively. To the readers of this\njournal the most interesting chapter is probably the last, entitled\n\" Personality and Survival of Bodily Death.\" The author considers\nthat \" as regards the possibility of survival the evidence of\nPsychical Research is of scientific importance,\" but that \" our\nbelief in survival is but little influenced by the findings of Psychi-\ncal Research.\"\n\" Alternative hypotheses are possible,\" but he gives no indica-\ntion as to what these hypotheses are. Most impartial students of the\nevidence would agree that the only possible alternatives to survival\nlie in supposing the existence of vast and unproved faculties of\ntelepathy or clairvoyance in successful mediums. Yet the author,\nso far as I can discover, does not mention the word telepathy\nthroughout the whole book, a rather startling omission in a work\nwhich aims at dealing exhaustively with the faculties of the mind.\nHe goes on to say that \" the arguments in favour of survival\nwhich are really impressive are on a different footing.\" They are,\nof course, independent of any evidence, and appear to be summed\nujj in the statement that \" we are likely to survive so far as we\ncan continue a realisation of values which we are in process of\nrealising here.\" The arguments in support of this statement seem to\nrest on the assumption that a supposition is true if its truth would\ncause the universe to appear to us pleasanter or more orderly.\nThe same supposition leads the author to the opinion that we\ncan never hope to get scientific proof of survival because it may\nbe better for us not to get it. If he is correct, it would seem a\nwaste of time to seek it, but his meagre estimate of the present\nevidence perhaps fails to allow for the short time that critical\nresearch has gone on and the very small number of those engaged\nin it.

E. Bousfield, K.C, in the chair. A paper on \" Some\nCritical Aspects of the Margfry Mediumship \" was read by\nDr. L. E. G. Crandon.\n{Editorial Note.\u2014The following extract from Dr. Crandon's\npaper gives a brief history of the \" Margery Mediumship as\nset out by Dr. Crandon himself. We do not propose to\ncomment on the paper, or to allow any space in the Journal\nfor discussion of it.)\nThe Margery mediumship dates from .Time, 1923. At that\ntime, all of us were entirely ignorant even of the history of the\nsubject. About that time, some of us read Crawford's books,\nand shortly after, as an experiment, and with hardly any serious\npurpose, we had a table built like Crawford's. Six of us sat in\nred light ; the table began to tilt and have raps almost at once,\nand by elimination we quickly discovered who was to blame, and\nthus Margery became a medium.\nThe personnel of the Margery group includes a physician and his\n\fFebruary, 1928 Private Meeting 187\nwife, a lawyer (member of the Committee on Ethics of the Suffolk\nBar), a mechanic engineer, and a surgeon.\nThe \" Inside \" group sit with fair regularity two or three times\na week. In addition to this, about every two weeks we have in\nfifteen to twenty people from the waiting-list. If the visitors\ncome as a group of investigators and not merely as observers,\nwe have certain requirements which must be fulfilled. An investi-\ngating group must agree in advance to make concurrent notes of\nthe sittings, by stenography or dictaphone, and must sign the\ntyped notes then and there. They must declare in writing that\nthe notes contain all the facts observed and the conditions thereof,\nregardless of cause. Anything alleged to have been detected in\nthe way of normal production of phenomena must be in the\nnotes, or shall be deemed non-existent.\nThe phenomena of this medium occur at home or abroad, and\nin strange houses. The medium's husband has been intentionally\nor unexpectedly absent scores of times, and for official sittings he\nis never in control of the medium. Margery has sat in a closed\nsearched room several times with one observer, if well known to\nbe honest.\nThe controlling intelligence of this mediumship declares himself\nto be Walter, the medium's brother, who passed from this life\nabout fifteen years ago. For present purposes, however, when the\nword \" Walter \" is applied to the controlling intelligence, let it\nbe understood that the name is used for brevity and explicitness,\nand does not necessarily imply commitment to the disincarnate\nnature of the control.\nAlthough this mediumship is typical of the best in history, it\nis nevertheless unique in several respects. Some of these aspects\nare the rigidity of the control methods, the great variety of the\nphenomena, the ingenious and willing co-operation of Walter, and\nthe tolerance to photography by flashlight.\nRigidity of Control. The medium is willing to submit to any\ncontrol, mechanical, or electrical, or luminous, provided it does not\nactually cause pain. Manual control depends on the honesty of\nthe sitters next the medium, and can have little scientific value\nin the dark. The acme of rigidity has been reached, we believe,\nin our plate-glass cabinet devised by Dr. Richardson. It is made\nup of six plate-glass doors, its dimensions being 3 feet wide,\n7 feet high, and 6 feet deep. The psychic's ankles are fastened\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February, 1928\nto eye-bolts in the floor by picture-wire, her hands are thrust out\nthrough side-ports and fastened with wire to eye-bolts. The\nhands cannot be drawn into the cabinet when thus fastened.\nThe head is prevented from forward motion by a leather collar\npadlocked on the neck and drawn back horizontally by a stout\ncord to an eye-bolt in the back of the cabinet. This method of\ncontrol in nowise interferes with the phenomena.\nKinds of Phenomena. There are many categories, with varieties\nunder each.\n{a) Cool Breezes. Cool breezes come out of the cabinet with\ngreat intensity, esjjecially if the phenomena arc about to be extra\ngood. A self-registering maximum and minimum thermometer\nplaced in the cabinet has repeatedly shown a dro]i of 28 degrees :\nthe room being 70 degrees, the thermometer shows a minimum\nof 42 degrees.\n(6) Lift\/in;\/ (f Ohjccts, or Teleh'.nesis, is shown in many variations,\nfrom lifting of a luminous paper ring, up to levitation of the\ntable with a 175 lb. man on it. A bell in a box, which can only\nbe made to ring by ])ressing down on a wooden flap on top, is\nrung intermittently in good red light as one of the sitters walks\nabout the room with the box in his hands. A ])air of scales\nmade wholly of brass and wood, and of extreme delicacy, is made\nto balance in good red light with a \" four to one \" load.\n(c) We have had trance-writing in one week in nine languages.\n(rf) We have bad aiitoinatic writing, Itut it is not one of our\nmajor interests.\n(e) We have repeatedly had music on instruments which are not\npresent. There is no radio in the house.\nif) We have -psychic lights of all grades of intensity up to a\nsheet two feet wide and seven feet tall. This Walter calls his\n\" shining garment,\" to be used later, he says, for complete\nmaterialization.\n(g) Materializations have been very impressive. We believe that\nthe teleplasm can be produced in many degrees of density. We\nrecognize, first, a type which cannot be seen or felt, but can be\nphotographed with a quartz lens ;\nsecond, a kind of somewhat\ngreater density which takes on form that can be felt, but in the\ndark only ; and third, a dense form of teleplasm which can be\nseen in good red light, or even in white flashlight, can be felt\nand examined and have its temperature taken. This material is\n\fTebkuabt, 192S Private Meeting 189\nlike soft rubber ; its temperature is about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIt is connected with the body of the medium, because even a\ngentle secret squeezing of it by one of the sitters will cause the\npsychic to groan, thus showing that it is connected with her\ncentral nervous system. Hands are formed, sometimes crude,\nsometimes almost perfect. They may or may not be covered\nwith skin ;\nthey contain bones, though some bones may be\nmissing ;\nthey have finger-nails. Such a hand will move about\nin a sluggish way and do things in good red light.\n{h) The Independent Voice. When the mediumship was four\nmonths old, we first heard faint whispers from the cabinet. This\nvoice rapidly developed, till now it is a loud hoarse masculine voice.\nWe thought that the voice, as a matter of common sense\nand experience, must come from the psychic, so we did what\nany one would do to test it. We put a hand over the psychic's\nmouth, and still got the voice. We filled her mouth with water :\nthe voice went on, and the psychic later ejected the same coloured\nwater. Not content with this. Dr. Richardson devised what he\ncalls a \" voice cut-out machine.\" This consists of two luminous\nfloats in a three feet U-tube, half full of water. Through a\nspecial glass mouthpiece and a metal gaspipe, the psychic blows\ndown one half of the U-tube. To maintain the floats at a dif-\nference in levels, the psychic's lips, teeth, tongue and cheeks are\nwholly occupied. The slightest opening of the lips would let the\nfloats go down to one level. Under these conditions, Walter\ngoes on talking or whistling merrily. It appears that we thus\nprove, mechanically, that the voice of Walter is independent, not\nof the presence of the medium, but of the normal use of her\nanatomy and physiology. Conversation has been carried on with\nWalter on the fourth floor front in the house, when Margery was\n31 feet away, on the third floor back. We have been able to\nrecord the whistling on the dictaphone, and other voices than\nWalter's apparently come through. Before a sitting with strangers\nwe ask each visitor to blow up the voice machine and then try\nto talk or whistle. No one has yet been able to do so.\n(i) The Baryta-waler Test. The psychic is lashed in the glass\ncabinet. On the table before her, but two feet away, is placed\na bottle half full of barium hydrate water. If one blows through\nthis solution a white cloud (precipitate) of barium carbonate is\nthrown down, due to the action of the carbonic acid gas (COj)\na2\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research febkuakt, 192&\nin the expired air. The psychic's mouth is now fully occupied\nby the voice machine. Walter talks, and at the same time\nbubbles may be heard going through the barium water bottle,\nand a luminous glass pellet is heard and seen to dance up and\ndown in the bottle. At the end of the experiment, white barium\ncarbonate makes the water milky. Thus it would appear that\nwe have three expiratory phenomena in the cabinet at the same\nmoment : the psychic's mouth, Walter's voice, and the bubbles\nof breathed air through the water. So we thought and declared ;\nbut Walter laughed and said, \" Set up the apparatus again,\"'\nand we did so. We then repeated the experiment ; the three\nsimultaneous expiratory phenomena again occurred, but we found\nno trace of barium carbonate in the water. What was blown\nthrough the water at this experiment we do not know, but it\nwas not the air of the room, for that will cause a slight pre-\ncipitation, nor was it human breath. What was blown through\nmust have been some other gas.\nij) Apports and Dep)orts. We have had about twenty apports\nand one apparent deport. We speak very little of these pheno-\nmena because they are admittedly the most difficult to believe.\nThey are also most difl&cult to control as to conditions of search\nbefore and after.\n[li) Photograpilis. We have always three cameras set up, ready\nto take photographs from three directions, if we are told to do\nso by Walter. Two of the cameras are fitted with a fused quartz,\nlens, and the third is stereoscopic, with two glass lenses. We\nuse hypersensitive films. The flashlight powder is so sprinkled\nover five electric sparking-points that the whole flash goes off at\nonce. The developing fluid has been so modified that it will\nbring out a picture, more or less latent, even on an under-exposed\nplate. All these details cut down the exposure of the medium\nand the psychic structures to a minimum of white light. They\nare all taken in the midst of good red light. The photographs\ntaken then can be divided into four classes. (1) Those which are-\nnot seen by the eye, but are recorded by both glass and quartz,\nlens. (2) Those not seen by the eye, not recorded by the glass\nlens, but recorded by the quartz lens. (3) Those seen by the eye\nand recorded by both lenses. (4) Those not seen by the eye or\nrecorded by either camera, but yet manifest by mechanical means\nas being present.\n\fFEBEtJART, 1928 Private Meeting 191\nQ.) Parajfin Gloves. We have had a large number of paraffin\ngloves, each with a narrow wrist. Each is obviously of a mar-\nculine right hand, and is never that of Margery's husband, wl o\nhas a deformed right index finger-nail. These gloves are produced\nunder conditions which apparently render it impossible for them\nto be normally produced. A normal method of doing it has\nbeen perfected by someone in Belgium, and also by another\nperson recently discovered by Dr. Osty, in the south of France.\nThe same normal way has apparently been worked out also by\nDr. Jamieson in Nelson, New Zealand. This normal methcd\nconsists, in brief, of the application of a tourniquet to the upper\narm till the hand becomes much swollen ; the hand is then\ndipped in paraffin and then into the cold water. Next, the con-\nstricting band is removed on the upper arm, the swelling subsides,\nand the experimenter is alleged to be able then to extract his\nhand from the glove. Dr. Geley, in his posthumous book, ex-\npresses the opinion that this cannot be done with the condi-\ntions imder which he studied Klusky. We have a similar opinion\nconcerning the gloves produced in the presence of Margery.\n(m) Finger-prints. From August, 1926, up to September 1,\n1927, we have had sixty-eight impressions of a thumb in dental\nwax (called \" Kerr \"). This wax softens in hot water, the impres-\nsions are then produced, and the wax hardens and becomes a\npermanent record.\n(1) The prints appear on marked identifiable pieces of wax, in\nthe presence of strangers only, in strange houses, with Margery\nlashed, hands, feet and head.\n(2) All the thumb-prints obtained (with five exceptions) are the\nsame thumb-print, and are never that of a sitter.\n(3) Some of them are negatives, both concave and convex.\n(4) Some of them are positives, both concave and convex.\n(5) Some of them are mirror-prints of others. That is to say,\nthey correspond to the others, but are reversed, and ridges\ncorrespond, ridge for ridge. The observations as to identity and\nmirror reversals are confirmed by C4overnmental or Police Officials\nin Washington, Boston, Berlin, Munich, Vienna, and Scotland Yard,\nall in writing.\n(6) It is not apparent how the mirror-prints on a mass of wax\ncan be produced in a world of three dimensions.\n\f192 Jovrnal of Society for Psychical Research February, 1928\n(7) Tlie thumb-prints of Walter in characteristics resemble those\nof Margery forty-five per cent.\n(8) The thumb-prints of Walter resemble those of the mother\nof Margery and Walter seventy per cent., in characteristics.\n(9) These relationships are precisely what they should be in the\ncase of brother and sister, and of son and mother.\n(10) A paraffin psychic glove made May 17, 1924, shows the\nsame thumb-print.\n(11) In 1912, Walter left his mother's house on what proved\nto be a fatal train trip, and shaved himself before leaving. The\nrazor was put away by his mother in her trunk. There was no\nother man in the family, and the container was never ojDened till\nMay, 1927. Walter's mother then handed the razor-case to the\nfinger-print expert. He opened it with difficulty, extracted the\nrazor with forceps, and developed on the handle the distal third\nof a latent thumb-print, which he declares to be consistent, in\nevery line present, with the Walter print.\nIf all the statements above are true, we have here an intrinsi-\ncally supernormal experiment, from which it appears one must\nconclude that there is produced, or reproduced, in the presence\nof Margery, a thumb-print which can belong to no one else but\nWalter Stinson, fifteen years deceased. No accusation of jugglery\nin photography can be made, because we have in our possession\nthe three-dimensional mass of dental wax corresponding to each\nphotograph.\nThe finger-j^rint experts find themselves in a corner. They\ndeclare the prints to be made by primary contact with human\nskin ; in other words, that the prints are not forgeries. Yet the\nprints are made with the psychic in a closed cabinet, and no one\npresent in the closed searched room but the finger-print expert.\nIt would seem as if the prints under those conditions must be\n]nade by a materialized individual thumb, or must be a forgery.\nIf a forgery, it is so successful that the experts are deceived\n;\ncriminals could make similar forgeries, and the science of finger-\nprint identification must fall.\nThere is a story which illuminates this subject. It is from a\nnovel called The Red Thumb Mark, by Freeman. In brief, a\nprint of the defendant's thumb is found at the site of the crime.\nIn court, it is identified as his by the experts. The defendant's\nlawyer asks to have the experts excluded for a time, and then\n\fFebuuakt, 1928 Private Meeting 193\nbegs the judge to allow a simple experiment. The lawyer then\nproduces a sheet of paper with twenty squares on it, and says,\n\" I have here a rubber stamp of the defendant's thumb made by\na j)hoto-engraving process ; with it I fill any ten of these squares,\nhere and there, with an imprint. I now have the defendant put\nhis thumb on an ink pad and fill the remaining ten squares with\nan actual print of his thumb.\" The experts were then called\nback to pick out the ten real thumb-prints. They not only\npicked out the wrong ones, but were 100 per cent, wrong. They\nmade this error because they found the prints made by the rubber\nstamp to be identical in every respect with each other, whereas\nno two of the actual thumb-prints were microscopically identical.\nAnd that is true, if you make a number of prints of your own\nthumb : no two will be just alike. They will be obviously from\nthe same thumb but will have minute differences because of the\ndifferences of temperature, the amount of rolling, the amount of\npressure, the amount of ink, etc. Confirming this, we find in the\nsixty-nine prints of Walter's thumb that no two are absolutely\nalike.\nFurthermore, we have enlarged the thumb-prints, even up to\none hundred times, and we find that this brings out more truly\nanatomic details ; whereas if the prints were artificially made, the\ntexture, unevenness, and the defects of material used would\nappear much magnified in an enlargement.\nLately we have obtained excellent photographs of Walter's hand\nmaking the prints, in good red light.\nCASE.\n\u00ab\nL. 1283. VeridiCxA.l Information given by a Communicator\nUNKNOWN TO THE SiTTER.\nWe have received from the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas the\nfollowing record of a case in which at one of his sittings with\nMrs. Leonard veridical messages were apparently received from\na communicator with whom Mr. Thomas had no personal\nacquaintance, giving facts quite unknown to him at the time\nof the sitting.\nThe date of the sitting was October 28th, 1927, and on the\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt Fkbruary, 1928\nevening of that day Mr. Thomas sent to the Editor, Mrs.\nSalter, the relevant extracts from his contemporary notes with\nthe following request\n:\nYou should receive this ou Saturday, Oct. 29, 1927. Will you\nkindly note time and date of reception ? It may possibly prove\nof interest.\nThese notes, with Mrs. Salter's endorsement that they were\nduly received by her at 4 p.m. on October 29th, 1927, are\nin the Society's possession, and the names and addresses of\nthe persons coicerned are known to the Society, although they\nare not given here.\nThe circumstances in which the incident occurred were as\nfollows: On September 21, 1927, a lady, here called Mrs. Peter,\nthe wife of a vicar in a country parish and a complete stranger\nto Mr. Thomas, wrote to him asking whether he was still\nliving at the address she had found given in Lady Grey's\nbook The Earthen Vessel, as she would like to write to him\n\" concerning a terrible trouble which has recently befallen us\nin the death of our only and darling son.\" Mr. Thomas\nacknowledged this letter, but informed Mrs. Peter that he was\nabroad at the time. On his return, Mrs. Peter wrote to him\nagain on October 26, 1927, a letter, from which the following\nextract may be quoted :\nI believe I told you, did I not, that we have lost our only\nand darling son, the 3rd of July last. He had left me to return\nto Oxford two hours before he was killed, full of life and the joy\nof living, and was run into by a young woman motorist who\ncame twenty-five to thirty miles an hour out of a side road.\n[Details of the accident are then given.] He was so terribly\ninjured he died in fifteen minutes. . . . We have a dear daughter\nof seventeen. ... If we could get any communication from him\nit would be an unspeakable comfort. ... I am wondering if any\none at their sitting could get a message from Ralph any time\nfor me. ... I venture to enclose these few letters out of over\nthree hundred and forty . . .\nA. [Peter.]\nAVith this letter were enclosed copies of fourteen letters of con-\ndolence received by Mr. or Mrs. Peter, testifying to the fine\n\fFebruary, 1928 Case 195\nand lovable character of their son. None of these letters\n-contain any information relevant to the case which is not\n\u2022contaiiied in Mrs. Peter s letter of October 26, 1927, as quoted\n\u2022above.\nOn receiving this letter from Mrs. Peter on October 27, 1927,\nMr. Thomas decided that he would make an attempt to get\ninto touch with her son at the sitting which he expected to\niave with Mrs. Leonard on the following day. The procedure\nadopted by Mr. Thomas and the manner in which the supposed\ncommunication from young Mr. Peter was introduced are\ndescribed in a letter written by Mr. Thomas to Mrs. Salter,\nin reply to an enquiry from her, as follows :\nDecember 10, 1927.\nEeplying to your inquiry I quote below the notes of my sitting\nin which Feda introduced young Mr. [Peter]. Perhaps you would\nlike to know how I account for his coming in the way he did.\nAfter replying to Mrs. [Peterjs appealing letter I began to think\nthat perhaps I ought to make an attempt to obtain what she so\ndesired. Accordingly I acted upon advice given me some years\nback by my father at a Leonard sitting. He had said that in case\n\u2022of my wishing to attract his attention to any special matter I\ncould do so by writing a message in brief, clear form and then\nreading it aloud once or more each night and morning for two\nor three days. He said that he would then certainly become\naware of it, either by being present while it was thus strongly\nin my thought, or by noticing that thought when next he visited\nme.\nI had used this method with success. On one special occasion\nI had also in similar manner invited a missing soldier to come to\nmy study, and to ask those whom he noticed present in my\nroom to tell him how to send messages through them to his\nparents. That proved successful ; it is a lengthy story with\nwhich I need not trouble you.\nIn the present instance I did exactly the same. I invited young\nMr. [Peter] to come to me and to ask my father and sister, who\nwould doubtless be also present, to tell him how to prepare some\nevidential messages for his parents and to take him to my ap-\nproaching Leonard sitting.\nHaving done this it rather passed out of my mind, and I was\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February, 1928:\nnot consciously thinking about it that afternoon when the sitting\nbegan. It was, however, brought suddenly to my mind by a\nquestion asked by Feda, and this question came almost at the\nbeginning immediately after the opening greetings, and a book\ntest. I now transcribe my notes as typed the evening of the\nsitting. ...\nFeda. Have you been asked to help a boy ?\nC. D. T. Yes.\nFeda. There is one here ; he was in a rush to come.\n[Here follows a note by Mr. Thomas, the substance of\nwhich is given in his letter above. The note is\ntherefore omitted.]\n(Feda then said that this boy had not been ill, and his\npassing seemed to have been quite sudden. I said\nthat this was correct and that I hoped she would be\nable to give me some further particulars.)\nFeda. He says, The letter, the letter, as if that had made you\nthink of him.\nC. D. T. Quite right. His mother sent me a letter about him.\nI quote no further, as the tests immediately followed, and you\nalready have a copy of these. . . .\nLater in the sitting, while my father was controlling, I asked\nhim how he got into touch with the lad who had been speaking\nearlier in the sitting. He replied. It was in your study we met\nhim. We did not know why he was there, but gathered that\nlater. . . .\nC. Drayton Thomas.\nOn the evening of October 28, 1927, Mr. Thomas wrote a\nletter to Mrs. Peter a copy of which, as already mentioned^\nwas sent to Mrs. Salter and endorsed by her. The letter\nwas as follows :\nOctober 28, 1927.\nWhen writing to you yesterday I had no thought of following\nit up with another to-day. I think that possibly I have been\nin touch with your son at my sitting this afternoon, and I hasten\nto send you a few items which have an evidential bearing. If\nI am to catch the post there will be no time to do more, and\nI should like you to have this before Sunday in the very possible\nevent of your recognising some of the items as correct.\n\fFebruary, 1928\nIf you find reason for thinking that the following remarks\noriginated with your son and apply to recognisable facts, perhaps\nyou will let me know and I will then send the remainder.\nI now quote fragments of the sitting :\nHe tries to say a name beginning B\u2014, not long, nor to\nbe connected with himself, but with someone on earth. It\nsounds like Ber\u2014 [1]\nHe had made an alteration in the time of going and that\ncaused him to be just at the spot where the accident hap-\npened. [2]\nHe gives a C for near where he lived. [3]\nA little before he passed his people had been talking about\nbuilding or erecting something in which they were all inter-\nested. [4]\nHe says, I am glad that the photograpjhs were taken a\nshort while before, so that they have some late ones of me,,\nas well as the earlier ones. Mother put one in the right-hand\ndrawer. She may have put more, but put one there and\nI think placed it in a sheet of paper ; it looked to me as if\nfolded in two round the photo. Possibly it was in a clean\nenvelope. [5]\nHe says, I have seen HAR\u2014who passed over. [6]\nHe says. The Present, they will know what I mean. The\npresent, I was so pleased ; tell them it had no connection\nwith my passing, it did not cause my passing. I had wanted\nit, but do not wish them to think it helped me to pass over.\n(I had to read this last paragraph over as he was anxious\nthat it should be given correctly.) [7]\nWearing a special cap. [8]\nAsk if they remember talking about a badge a little while\nbefore. [9]\nPie says four of them at home. (I said I understood there\nwere only three.) He says four, there is one also whom he\nthinks of with aliection. Feda gets from him a feeling of\ntwo parents, one younger, and an older person. [10]\nWho is Jefi ? Feda heard him say that name. [11]\nC. D. Thomas.\nOn October 29, 1927, Mrs. Peter wrote to Mr. Thomas in\nreply. As her letter is long and contains some matter not\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February. 1928\nrelevant to this case, it will be better to give an abstract,\nincluding some quotations, of the relevant parts :\n(1) The name beginning with B, sounding \"like Ber,\" is\nidentified by Mrs. Peter as referring to a great friend of the\nfamily, Mrs. Bertram (a pseudonym, with the first three letters\nunchanged). Mrs. Peter wrote :\nShe lives only one and a half miles off and is aunt to the girl\nhe had loved since he was a little boy of eight. He so often\nwas at her house and met the girl he loved there and was most\ninterested consequently in everything Mrs. Bertram said or did.\nThe morning he was killed he met her in her taxi returning from\nchurch, and her driver said, \" That was Mr. Peter,'' and she said,\n\" Oh, L., why did I not stop him and make him come in.\"\n(He was just by their gate.) And I so intensely regretted it,\nknowing one word from her would have had him off his bike like\na shot, and so delayed his getting to that awful corner, and the\nwoman would have gone by. He saw Mrs. Bertram and smiled\nat the driver whom he knew well. That is a name that is so\noften on our lips . . . there was no name he would so often say\nperhaps as Mrs. Bertram.\n(2) With regard to the alteration in the time of his going,\n3Irs. Peter writes that it had been originally planned that he\nshould return to Oxford on the Saturday afternoon, but at the\nlast moment he received an invitation to a tennis party on that\nday, and after some doubt and discussion it was decided that\nhis departure for Oxford should be postponed till the Sunday\nmorning. It was a matter of regret to Mrs. Peter that she\nhad been instrumental in arranging this postponement, since,\nif the young man had gone on Saturday, as originally planned,\nthe collision which killed him would not have occurred.\n: (3) The nearest town, about two miles from the Vicarage,\nias a name beginning with C.\n(4) With regard to the reference to building, BIrs. Peter\nwrites that there has been much talk about enlarging the\nVicarage. The decision to enlarge it was reached in August,\n1928, but the building was postponed on account of a serious\nillness of Mr. Peter s. She says :\nWe are always discussing it and planning where we should put\nthis or that. We have talked no end about it, and had builders\n\fFebuuauy, 1928 Case 199\netc. here to go into the matter. We meant to do it next Feb-\nluary if my husband found he could carry on.\n(5) At the time of Mr. Kalph Peter s death the most recent\nphotographs in his parents' possession, or of which they had\nany knowledge, were some taken more than three years before,\nwhen he left school. After his death Mrs. Peter learnt through\na college friend of his of the existence of two group photo-\ngraphs, taken about eighteen months before, in which her son\nfigured. These photographs she has since obtained and had\nframed. There seems to be some confusion about the state-\nment that the photograph is in a drawer. The statement does\nnot apply to the college photographs of Mr. Ralph Peter, but\nmight apply to another photograph which has lately come into\nMrs. Peter's possession.\n(6) Mrs. Peter could suggest no one with a name beginning\nHar to whom reference might be made except a man in a\nneighbouring parish who had died about eighteen months\nbefore. But as this man was only an acquaintance, the point\ncannot be considered as having much evidential value.\n(7) Concerning the present Mrs. Peter writes :\nThe present must mean his motor bike. It was a twenty-tirst\nbirthday present, got by putting together all his birthday cheques\nonly fourteen months before. I always dreaded him having one,\nand he knew I was always very anxious about him . . . though\nhe was a good and careful rider. The police superintendent at\nLichfield told us . . . that had he been in a car he would never\nhave been killed.\n(8) In her letter to Mr. Drayton Thomas Mrs. Peter stated\nthat the allusion to a special cap was not imderstood ; her son\nI\nwas not wearing any special cap at the time of the accident.\nSubsequently she wrote to Mrs. Salter that she thought refer-\nence might possibly be intended to an incident which occurred\nabout three weeks before the sitting, and therefore some time\nafter the communicator's death. But the reference at the\nsitting is too vague to be identified with any certainty, and\ntherefore the details of this incident are not given here.\n(9) Mrs. Peter has a vague recollection of a conversation\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febhuakt, 1928-\nwhicli took place some months before her son's death to whichi\nreference may be intended, but the point is not clear.\n(10) The family consisted of four persons including Mr.\nRalph Peter himself, the parents and two children. There is a\ndifference of fifteen years in age between Mr. and Mrs. Peter.\nThere was also a girl (mentioned above) of whom he thought\nwith great affection. \" She had been his fancy since he was\na wee boy of eight, and in that way he had never looked at\nanyone else.\"\n(11) Concerning the allusion to \" Jel? \" Mrs. Peter writes:\nJeii' is great evidence. Our Rural Dean's son, his only son, is-\nnamed Jeff, never called anything else. Our darhng was at his\nhome till nine o'clock the night before he was killed. I enclose-\nyou Mrs. M.'s letter to show you where she speaks of her son\nGeoff.\nIt was to Mrs. M.'s house that he went for the tennis party\nreferred to above.\nA few other statements were made at the sitting, but they\nare of too general a character to have much evidential value\nand therefore are not quoted here.\nTwo points in the case are worth noting :\n(a) Although Mr. Drayton Thomas went to the sitting with\na definite intention of getting into touch with Mr. Ralph Peter,\nif possible, the introduction by Feda of a youzig man wishing\nto communicate was spontaneous.\n(b) The information given at the sitting related almost\nentirely to matters unknown to Mr. Thomas. Such informa-\ntion as he had, e.g. of the young man's name, was not draAva\nupon.\nHUMAN PERSONALITY AND THE PROOF OF SURVIVAL,\nBy David Gow.\n(Editor of Light.)\nAs one who has followed for many years the question of\nhuman survival and its evidences, may I set down my view\nthat it can rest on no single criterion. Let me put it in this,\nway : A friend, X, leaves England in order to reside in\n\fFebruary, 1928 Human Personality and Proof of Survival 201\nAustralia and I eventually receive a brief cablegram bearing\nhis name. That would be for all ordinary purposes proof\nthat he had arrived. But it would not be final and conclusive.\nLater I receive a letter in his handwriting, confirming his\ncablegram, and letters also arrive from other friends mentioning\ntheir meeting with X. If, beyond this, I should chance to\nmeet an Australian visitor to our country who reports having\nmet X, that would be sufficient to establish for me with\ncertainty the fact that X was actually resident in Australia.\nThese are the kind of proofs I have sought for and fre-\nquently gained in connection with the quest for proof of the\nsurvival of particular friends who have passed out of mortal\nlife. But as these people have admittedly travelled beyond\nthe bourne of time and space, it might be held that the\nAustralian analogy is inadequate and that the direct evidence\nand the corroborative evidence would need to be extensively\nreinforced on thj principle that an extraordinary fact (or\nalleged fact) needs correspondingly extraordinary proof. That\nmay be admitted, but only so long as the fact remains extra-\nordinary. The multiplication of facts of the same order tends\nto diminish their extraordinary character, and it is fair to\nclaim that the testimony to such facts has multiplied so\ntremendously of late years that the question is no longer in\nthe same position that it was.\nSuppose we invert the order of our procedure. Instead of\ntaking our facts and applying them to the particular quest on\nwhich we are engaged, we give that quest a subordinate\nposition\u2014even to the point of leaving it out of accoimt alto-\ngether. We take the facts, then, and, instead of marshalling\nthem as evidence of the preconceived idea, examine them\nindependently and see where they lead. It seems not im-\npossible that they would point to a question with which human\nsurvival may or may not be bound up\u2014I mean the problem\nof the nature of human personality.\nThat is the problem which has been forming gradually and\ndimly in my mind during many years of thought and inquiry.\nIt has been forced on my attention many times and by many\ncurious experiences. These began, in eSect, some years ago\n\u2022when I was in correspondence with a clergyman, scholar and\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Februaet, 1928\npLilosoplier, whom I sometimes consulted on academic points.\nWe established an epistolary friendship, not meeting each other\nuntil long afterwards. It was my friend who first noted that\nwe were often thinking of the same things at the same time\nand, in writing, dealing with the same subjects and using the-\nsame phrases and images, unknown to each other until our\nletters arrived. This happened so frequently as to occasion\nnot only amazement but even exasperation on the part of the\nclergyman who complained week after week that my articles\nin Light, were almost duplicates of things he had himself\nwritten for me or was engaged at the time in writing. One\nday he designed a little humoroiis article for Light on the\n\" red-faced man \" in Dickens' Shetches by Bo:, and had plotted it\nout in his mind. The very next week an article on the same-\ntheme and on the same lines appeared in Light, very much\nto his astonishment. I had been thinking of the same thing\nat almost the same time and in the same way. One day\nI wrote him a letter in the course of which I likened myself\nto the \" White Knight who \" knew the rules of the game.\"\nBut on the same day on which he received my letter I received\na letter from him saying that, like the \" White Knight,\" he\n\" knew the rules of the game !\n\" These coincidences went\non until they became almost frightening. We eventually met\neach other on his visiting London, and then this strange\n\"spate of telepathy came to an end.\nIt was about this time that I became aware of curious-\nechoes from my mind reaching me from various quarters.\nThoughts, monologues with myself, private writings were reflected\nto me from various quarters\u2014sometimes from seance-rooms at\nwhich I was not present. I began to liken my editorial\noffice to a sort of whispering gallery. My unspoken thoughts^\ncouched sometimes in an unusual phraseology, would be picked.\nup and returned to me. To one less seasoned in the psychic-\nrealm the experience would have seemed weird in the extreme..\nTo have one's personal reflections repeated to friends in the\nseance-room by controls and communicators through a medium\nwas distinctly embarrassing.\nOne day I had sketched out in my mind the characters of a.\nhumorous skit on the line of The Three Musheteers, assign-\n\fFebeuart, 1928 Human Personality and Proof of Saruival 203\ning a living person to eacti character : Porthos, Athos and\nAramis\u2014adding D'Artagnan as a fourth. I could not quite\nfit Athos, by the way. I kept the matter in my mind, being\naccustomed to rely on memory-drafts in these matters. A\nfew days later a letter reached me from a well-known author\nand dramatist who had lately come into the active investiga-\ntion of SpirituaHsm. He told me of his idea for a humorous\narticle. It was to be called \" The Three Pamphleteers.\" It\nwas based on Dumas' Three Musketeers. He had taken all\nfour characters, as I had, fitted three of them to the same\npersons, but he had \" got stuck \" over Athos ! When he\nknew of the coincidence my friend was astonished. He\nassigned it, of course, to telepathy. But to me the return of\nmy own unspoken and unwritten thoughts in this strange\nfashion seemed to have a deeper sign ificance.\nTo one, two\u2014even sis of these correlations of thought I\ncoidd have given the name of chance-coincidences. But they\nwere so multitudinous that such an explanation would have\nbeen farcical.\n'These things, in feet, gave me strange hints and gleams\noutside and beyond the question either of psychic faculty or\nhuman survival.\nThey pointed to a vast problem\u2014that problem to which\nI have referred : the nature of Human Personality. They\nsuggested, in some obscure way, the possibility that we are\nreally concerned not so much wiih questions of personal or\nindi\\'idual existence here or hereafter, but something cosmic in\nits range. It is too deep a question to enter upon here except\nin a vague, allusive fashion. Hitherto the conception that\nevery individual is rmited in the subconscious, that the Many\nand the One are identical, that self-consciousness is an illusion^\nhas been a kind of stock idea of the mystic and the trans-\ncendentaKst. Perhaps also one may add the poet, remembering\nDante Gabriel Kossetti's lament over a v\/orld in which \" Man is\nparcelled out in men,\" and each man's attitude towards his neigh-\nbour is: \"He is he, I am I.\" May not the time come when\nthis idea of human solidarity will emerge from a vague poetical\nperception into something with clear outlines\u2014something clearly\nvisible to the mind, a scientific as well as a philosophic and\n\f204; Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febecaet. 1928\nmystical conception ? In that case may we not look for a\nkind of \" solution in unity \" of some of our problems ? When\nwe cease to divide and subdivide, to demark and to isolate,\nwe may find that the solution of one great Problem will solve\nby the same fact a multitude of smaller enigmas.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie.

Prof. Dr.\nChristoph Schroder continues the description of Frau Rudlofi's\n\" Phanomenik,\" dealing this time with \" Sanguiformative Meta-\ngenetic \" drawings on mirrors, window panes, also tables and doors,\netc. These phenomena \" appear to have begun in July, 1925 \",\nand Prof. Schroder says he has, lying before him, altogether 213\n\" protocols \" (some extremely short ones) drawn up by Fraulein\nRudloff, which he says he has no reason not to accept as having\nbeen written in good faith, in view of his later, to him quite\nconclusive, experiments. The \" Sanguiformative Metagenetic\nphenomena \" are illustrated by photographic reproductions which\nit must be confessed, look decidedly suspicious. The account in\nquestion is only a beginning.\nDr. Mattiesen brings to a close his series of articles on trance-\nphenomena and indefatigably begins a new series as an argument\nfor the spirit hypothesis.\nDie Zeitschrift fiir Psychische Forschung. December, 1927.\nDr. Emil Mattiesen continues his comprehensive survey and dis-\ncussion of the difficulties in trance-communication as evidence for\nthe spirit-hyjjothesis.\nM. Macourek of Trebian, Styria, Austria, commences an account\nof some recent experiences with the medium Frau Marie Silbert.\nThe whole tone of the account is one of complete confidence in\nher, and the narrative contains so far nothing very striking, with\none possible exception : the phantom of part of a man dressed\nin uniform is said to have been seen by another person simul-\ntaneously with the medium, both being thoroughly frightened.\nThe sitters were six in number.\nDr. C!hr. Schroder prints many further \" protocols \" (chiefly very\nshort) of Frau Rudloff's \" sanguiformative and metagenetic\n\"\ndrawings on mirrors, etc. (In some cases the \" substance \" is\nsaid to have been an \"albuminous\" one.) The \"protocols\"\nembrace the period from August 26 to October 9, 1925 ; some\n*\nbelong to a later period. In many cases Frau and Fraulein\nRudloli are the only eye-witnesses. In very few instances do the\n\fFebruary, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 207\nconditions under which the drawings (chiefly of heads), scrawls,\netc., ajjpeared present something like a prima facie case for investi-\ngation\u2014that is if we exclude (as we are perfectly entitled to) the\ntestimony of the mother and daughter.\nRevue Metapsychique. November-December, 1927.\nDr. Osty has the beginning of a long paper entitled \" On\nthe borderland of classical Psychology and Metapsychical\nPsychology \" which deals with calculating and painting pro-\ndigies. In the part published, the case of a certain Louis\nFleury, born in April, 1893, and blind from birth, is narrated in\ndetail. At first almost entirely unintelligent, he seems to have\nbeen intellectually transformed, so to say, by a sudden and\nviolent moral shock at the age of fifteen. \" Since then the\nabstract world of numbers became his true internal life, his mind\nexerting itself without effort and with joy \" (p. 395). Dr. Osty\ndiscusses the case with great detail, adducing many instances of\nF.'s extraordinary performances. Incidentally however, we are\nreminded that as far back as 1912, a certain M. Quinton made\nbefore the Paris Philosophical Society a demonstration showing\nthat a very simple method exists for extracting roots of various\ndegrees (cubic, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, etc.) in a very short time.\nThe performances of the ''\nprodigies \" are by no means explained\nin this way, liut this circumstance should not be altogether\nlost sight of.\nA \" well-known \" painter, M. Le Loup de Sainville prints an\naccount of his experiments in \" extra-sensorial perceptions \" (at\nfirst delivered as a lecture before the Metapsychical Institute in\nMa3^, 1927), which contains valuable facts. M. Le Loup operated\nwith various subjects as percipients at a distance amounting some-\ntimes to 120 kilometres and obtained many successful results.\nI am not sure that the cases quoted as successes do not some-\ntimes imply a little straining of the evidence (cf. the Berlin case\nwhere M. Le Loup was percipient and M. Rene Warcollier agent,\np. 447). But the amount of coincidence obtained in some\ninstances is certainly beyond what chance can produce. The\nwriter seems to have obtained particularly satisfactory results when\noperating (always at a more or less considerable distance) with a\ncertain Mile. Marthe G. as percipient. It is significant that the\n\" administrative situation \" occupied by this lady compels M. Le\nLoup, he says, not to reveal her name. Altogether the paper is\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February, 1928\na valuable contribution to the subject. And such a case as that\ndescribed on p. 438, where the writer transmits to a friend,\nDr. d'A., at 120 kilometres, \" trois rectangles allonges\" shouting at\ntlie same time the words, and where the percipient hears the\nwords and draws the three rectangles at once, sending them im-\nmediately by post to the agent that very evening, such a case,\nI say, if correctly described (there is no corroborative evidence), is\n])erhaps the most striking on record.\nSignor Bozzano re^jlies to a criticism by M. Charles Quartier\nof his book, Les Enignies de la Psychometrie el les Phhiomenes de\nTelesthesie, and M. Charles Quartier retorts by breaking a further\nlance with Siguor Bozzano.\nA short letter by M. Paul Heuze, whose \" enquele \" on medium\nand Spiritualism in VOpinion a few years ago aroused much\ninterest, deserves attention. M. Heuze describes the \" clairvoyant\n\"\nguessing of cards drawn at random out of a pack by himself,\nby an Irishman, Mr. C. P., who sitting at a distance \" does not\ntouch anything.\" Three cards are drawn each time without being\nlooked at and the Irishman always guesses one card at least and\nalmost always two, often all three. These three cards and\nanother detail quoted l)y iA'l. Heuze and into which I need not\nenter here seem to be quite unnecessary comjjlications ; the fact\nof the Irishman being an \" homme du meilleur monde \" is certainly\nno guarantee ; but taking into account the personality of M.\nPaul Heuze, the case undoubtedly deserves further investigation.\nP.

Sir Oliver Lodge in the\nchair. There were also present : The Right Hon. G. W.\nBalfour, Mr. E. N. Bennett, Mr. Th. Besterman, Mr. W. R.\nBousfield, Mr. G. Brown, Mrs. E. K.

Scott, Mrs. Henry Sidg-\nwick, Lady Sybil Smith, Mr. F. C. Summerson, Mrs. Kingsley\nTarpey, Mrs. Vatcher, Mr. M. West, and Dr. V. J. WooUey.\nSir Lawrence Jones read the Annual Report of the Council\nfor the year 1927, and the Hon. Treasurer, Mr. W. H. Salter,\npresented the Financial Statement.\nThe Society, he said, had begun the year with a balance\nin hand of \u00a3425, and had ended the year with a balance of\n\u00a3555. This he considered extremely satisfactory in view of\nthe fact that the bulk of the expenses of reorganising the\nLibrary (\u00a3460 out of an estimated total of \u00a3700) were shown\nin the accounts as paid for out of current income, and that\nthe year had been an exceptionally busy one in the matter\nof research, so that the employment of additional staff had\nbeen necessary.\nAs stated in the Report, the Society had been able to do\nthis largely owing to the generosity of the Anonymous Donor\nmentioned on previous occasions. The Society should not,\n\f212 Jourval of Society for PsycJncal Research March, 1928\nhowever, on that account, through diminution of its own\ncapital resources, risk any further limitation of its powers of\nresearch. It was for that reason that he was appealing to\nMembers and Associates to raise by donation a sum of \u00a3400\ntowards the cost of reorganising the Library, as in so far as\nthe cost was not met out of donations it would fall on the\nSociety's General Fimds. The total received to date in\nresponse to this appeal was about \u00a3140.\nSir Oliver Lodge having invited comments on the Annual\nReport and Financial Statement, Mr. Dingwall (1) questioned\nthe accuracy of the statement that no paper on Psychical\nResearch had been read to the British Association between\n1876 and 1927 ^\n; (2) asked how many \" physical \" mediums had\nbeen investigated by the Hon. Officers during 1927 ;\nand (3)\ncriticised a leaflet issued by the National Book Council, bearing\nthe Society's name and address, and containing a list of books\non Psychical Research suitable for readers.\nThe Chairman stated he would enquire into Mr. Dingwall's\nfirst point. Dr. WooUey, replying to the second, said that\nthe number of \" physical \" mediums investigated by the Hon.\nOfficers in 1927 was precisely the same as the number investi-\ngated by Mr. Dingwall during his last year as Research Officer,\nviz. nil. Dr. Woolley proceeded to explain more fully the\ndifficulties attending attempts to investigate \" physical \" mediums\nunder satisfactory conditions.\nSir Lawrence Jones (as Chairman of the Library Committee)\nand the Hon. Librarian (Mr. Besterman) explained the cir-\ncumstances as to the trade circular to which Mr. Dingwall\nhad referred, and Mrs. Leaning also spoke on this subject.\nAfter further discussion of other matters the meeting pro-\nceeded to the election of Members of Council. The voting\nwas by show of hands and the names were taken in alpha-\nbetical order. The result of the voting was as follows :\nName of Candidate. Number of Votes.\n*Mr. W. W. Baggally - - - - 29\nMr. E. J. Dingwall - - - - 10\nMr. J. C. Fliigel ----- 13\n*Dr. T. W. Mitchell - - - - 31\n^ See below, p. 221.\n\fMarch, 1928 Annual Report of the Council for 1927\n*Mr. W. H. Salter ----- 28\n*Mrs. W. H. Salter ----- 32\n*Mr. S. C. Scott ----- 28\n*Mrs. Sidgwick ------ 34\n(Retiring Members of Council marked *.)\nThe Chairman accordingly declared the six retiring Members\nof Council duly re-elected.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1927.\nAs foreshadowed in our Aimual Report for last year, the\nSociety was fortunate enough to obtain the consent of\nDr. Driesch to act as its President for a second year.\nDr. Driesch paid a visit to the Society in March, when he\ngave to a private meeting an interesting account of his recent\nexperiences in the United States. He attained his 61st birth-\nday during the year, and the Council joined in arrangements\nwhich were being made in Germany for the presentation to\nhim of his portrait, of which it is hoped that a photograph\nwill be placed in the Society's Rooms.\nAs the Society is aware, the annual appointment of a\nsalaried Research Officer was not renewed last March (see\nJournal for May, p. 70). The Council decided as regards\nresearch carried out under the auspices of the Council, or on\nthe Society's premises, to concentrate all authority in the\nhands of the Hon. Research Officer, Dr. V. J. Woolley. This\ndoes not, of course, mean that the Council wish in any way\nto discourage independent research by its members\u2014quite the\ncontrary. Such independent research has always been a most\nimportant soxirce\u2014indeed, probably the most important\u2014of the\nknowledge which the Society exists to co-ordinate and develop.\nThe year 1927 has been one of unusual activity for the\nSociety in many branches of its work.\nWe may first of all mention the reorganisation of the\nSociety's Library. At the last Ammal Meeting questions were\nraised as to the adequacy of the Library for the purposes of\nserious research, and on the 17th February, 1927, the Council\nappointed a special Committee to consider all questions con-\nnected with the Library. On the recommendation of this Com-\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march, 1928\nmittee, Mr. Theodore Besterman was appointed Hon. Librarian\non the 16th March, and the work of reorganising the Library\nwas promptly set in hand. It was soon ascertained that the\ngrowth of the Society's Library would require additional shelf\nspace, and the Council were therefore reluctantly compelled\nto request Mr. Price to remove the books he some years ago\nvery kindly lent to the Society under the condition that they\nwere kept apart from the rest of the Library. The Council wish\nonce again to express their thanks to Mr. Price for this loan.\nNew bookcases were ordered both for the Library and for\nthe back room opening out of it. These cases have a miich\nbetter appearance than the old shelves, and, what is more\nimportant, provide more accommodation for books. Additional\nbooks have been purchased, missing volumes replaced, and old\nvolumes reboimd ; and a new Catalogue has been issued. The\nprocess of reorganisation (although mainly carried out during\nthe vacation) involved the closing of the Library for several\nmonths, but the CouncU beUeves that the great improvement\neffected will more than recompense users of the Library for\nany temporary inconvenience they may have suffered.\nThe Carnegie United Kingdom Trust have recognised the\nimportance to students of the Society's Library by promising\na grant of \u00a3250 per annum for four years, to be spent on the\nfuture purchase of books and periodicals and on binding.\nIn one way and another the reorganisation of the Library\nhas cost the Society at least \u00a3700. After applying towards\nthis amount the capital of the Edmund Gurney Fund there\nremained a sum of approximately \u00a3400 to be found. The\nCouncil are accordingly appealing to members to contribute to\na special fund to meet these expenses, no part of which can be\npaid out of the money to be received from the Carnegie\nTrustees. The response to this appeal has so far been satis-\nfactory, and the Council hope that ultimately it will be possible\nto repay the whole of this expenditure without entrenching on\nthe Society's capital, and thereby hmiting its activities in other\ndirections. While on the subject of the Library the Council\nwish to express to the Honorary Librarian their appreciative\ngratitude for the time, thought and trouble he has expended on\nhis task.\n\fMarch, 1928 Annual Report of the Council for 1927 215\nTuming to research, the Society co-operated with the British\nBroadcasting Corporation in an experiment in telepathy in\nFebruary. \" Listeners in all over the country were invited\nto send to the Society any impressions they received between\ncertain hours on the night of February 16th, and approxi-\nmately 30,000 replies were received. The analysis of this\nenormous mass of material, perhaps the largest that has ever\nbeen obtained in any single experiment in psychical research,\ninvolved an immense amoimt of labour. A rapid preliminary\nanalysis was carried out with the assistance of several members\nof the Society, whom the Coimcil wish to thank, and sub-\nsequently it was found necessary to engage a temporary staff\nof eight persons to carry out a more detailed analysis. A\ncertain amount of evidence for telepathy on the part of some\nof the \" listeners in \" was obtained, and in other respects the\nresults were of psychological value. A report on the experi-\nment was read by Dr. Woolley at a public meeting in May,\nand wiU be pubbshed later in Proceedings.\nIt seemed desirable to conduct further experiments with such\nof the \" hsteners in\" as had shown evidence of telepathic\npowers, and accordingly weekly experiments have been con-\nducted during the last four months with about one himdred\npersons, consisting mainly of \" listeners in \" who were willing\nto continue the February experiment, and partly of members\nof the Society. These latter experiments, which are still\nproceeding, are xmder the management of Mr. S. Gr. Soal.\nThe experiments referred to in the last Annual Report as\nbeing carried on with Mrs. Osborne Leonard, Mrs. Warren\nEUiott, and other trance mediums were brought to a close at\nthe end of June, by which time the Society had obtained a\nquantity of material that it would obviously take a consider-\nable time to sift and analyse.\nSeveral mediums gave sittings, including Mrs. Osborne\nLeonard, Mrs. Warren Elliott, Miss Bazett and Mrs. Dowden,\nto all of whom the Society is indebted for the readiness with\nwhich they co-operated. A feature of the investigations was\nwhat has become known as \" Absent Sitter Sittings,\" of which\nMrs. Warren Elliott and Miss Bazett between them gave ninety-\nnine, while similar sittings were also given by Mrs. Lucy Smith\n\fiH O\n00 CO o\nrH rH\nO 00\ng ^ 00\nI-H O o o O O CO O O 00\nrH rH\nI>\nrH\no rH\no\nCO rH\nrH\nI-H\nin\nI-H I-H\nGi\nI-H\no\nCO\nrH\nCO\nI>\nrH O CO o\nCO\na\nc\n^ o\n00 o\n^ o ^ I.\nAh\no ^ ^\n.g\n.3\nPh\n>>\nw\no o\nO 00\na\n. o\ns g\n\u00a71\nCD\n1^\n\u20223 P.\na;' CD\n2 iS\nOT\na\no\n1-5\n\u00ab1 .g<\ntu ;\nS S\nS g 'S\n1-1 o\nto >j\na\nCM O\ng I C\nP=( H E-i S m\nOT\na .\ntD 0)\nO C OT\n~ \u00b0 Sa\ne H <!\no\nO\n8 H\nF- OT C\nCO M S\ni -S\nC3 ^\n3\nO \u2014 .\nC3 03 C3\n03 S .S\nO O o\nOT OT\nOT\nc' -a\no ^\n3 CD\ntn &\n\u00bb S\n> OT\nd\nC3\na\no\n<D .S\no B\nII\nCD\nE o d\nH\nX3 G\n^ P3 f\no o o o\nCO o =^ CI '-^ ^ ITS\nCI O uO <^ ^ o\nI> CO\nITS G^l O\nCO rH\nOS T-i O\nlO rH CJ\nrH CM\no CI CO O o 00 o\nrH\no\no CO CI CI CO CO O\no CI CI CI CI \u2022* rH\nin CD rH CI t>\nrH CI o\nrH\n.a\na\nH^\ncn\n(D\n^ p\nO\na\np o ^\n3\na\no ^\nTti lO to t~-\nCl CI CJ C3\no c; o oi\nCO 00\nCl CI CJ\nCI O CI\nSSSSS '\"^rHrHrH\nOT\n3\no\np\ns\nr> -H o\nO 00 CO\nO O\n^ 00 OJ\n3\ncc\n\u2014 o\n5\nOT\nI\n3 c;\n<D (3\nS .S .2\n' C3\n.2 3\nt \u00a7 s\nd\no\no\na\no\nS o\n1^^\ncn pt*\np. a\n\u2022H tC\n-g S3 o\n\u00b0 S \u00b0J\nS 5 -3\nM t-^ cn\nO o .S-\ng H 7\nOT ^\n'\no\nO <D\ntS OT \u00ab\n9. o\na S 3\nc .-a\no\no\na\n-a\no\n3 <>J\n'3\n^ ^\n-\na\n1 P, J3\n; S S\n\fo CO CO\n(N cs\nr-l\nO o 00 uO\no CO L-O uO\nCi\n^ C CD O fM\n\u2014 O r-i O O O\nO: C.

In these Absent\nSitter experiments objects formerly belonging to deceased\npersons were handed to the medium with a view to ascer-\ntaining whether \" communications \" would result similar to\nthose obtained when a friend or relation of the deceased\nperson was present as sitter.\nFifty-two sittings of the ordinary kind were also held with\n]\\Irs. Warren Elliott, and nine with Mrs. Leonard.\nThe number of \" sitters \" was between forty and fifty, several\nof whom had sittings with more than one medium. For each\nsitting the Society provided a shorthand note-taker, and the\nSecretary, when the verbatim records of the sittings had been\ntyped out, forwarded a copy to the sitter for annotation. It\nwill be imderstood that the business of taking verbatim records,\nhaving them typed, obtaining the sitter's annotations and con-\nducting correspondence with the sitters arising out of the\nannotations, involved very heavy work upon the Society's\nstafi.\nWhen this work was accomphshed there remained the task\nof analysing the results, comparing the results obtained by any\none sitter through one medium with those obtained by the\nsame sitter through another medium, comparing the results of\nthe Absent Sitter Sittings with the Ordinary Sittings, and\ncomparing the results obtained by difierent sitters respectively.\nIt became clear at an early stage that it woidd be necessary\nto have a complete index with a variety of cross references\ncompiled, and the task of compiling this index and preparing\nan analysis of all the sittings was kindly undertaken by\nMr. H. F. Saltmarsh, a member of the Society, to whom the\nCouncil wish to express their very hearty thanks.\nIt may be some time before a complete report of these sit-\ntings can be presented, but the analysis has already proceeded\nfar enough to show considerable evidence of apparent super-\nnormal activity. In any event, investigations on as large a\nscale as these experiments, or the British Broadcasting Cor-\nporation experiment already mentioned, cannot fail to be of\nassistance to future investigators of trance mediumships and of\ntelepathy at a distance, by providing, as it were, a back-\ngrqvmd for their own researches.\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1928\nThe Society has already arranged for various members who\nhave shown themselves to be good sitters to have sittings\nwith several other mediums for the purpose of ascertaining\nwhether any of such medixuns deserve a more extensive in-\nvestigation.\nThe experiments arranged by Miss Jephson of a \" clair-\nvoyant \" nature, to which reference has already been made,\nare still being carried out.\nA few reports of alleged poltergeists have been received by\nthe Society, but not so many as the Council would wish.\nThe Council desire once again to impress upon members the\ndesirability of reporting to the Society at once any cases of\nhaunted houses, poltergeists, premonitions, veridical hallucina-\ntions, etc., occurring in their neighbourhood. Investigations\nwere conducted at Kessingland, near Yarmouth, and Malpas,\nCheshire ; neither investigation produced any clear evidence of\nsupernormal occiraences.\nAs the result of these rather laborious activities in the\nSociety's research department during last year, not only was\nthe regular staff of the Society occupied to the fullest possible\nextent, but it was from time to time necessary to engage\nadditional temporary staff to deal with the trance medium\ninvestigations as well as the B.B.C. experiment. The Council\nwish to take this opportunity of expressing their very warm\nthanks both to the permanent and the additional stafi for the\nservices they have rendered.\nThe Society has been enabled to carry on an active policy\nof research mainly owing to the generosity of the anonymous\ndonor mentioned in last year's report. But the greater the\nSociety's activities in research the greater are its expenses in\nother directions, e.g. in printing. While, therefore, the Coimcil\nare for the immediate present relieved of anxiety as to the\nprovision of fimds for actual research, they wish to emphasise\nthe fact that it is essential that the general funds of the\nSociety should be maintained and, if possible, increased.\nThe Council added to its members by co-optation Professor\nE. R. Dodds, of Birmingham University, Professor Julian\nHuxley and Mr. J. Arthur Hill whose books on psychical\nresearch will be known to most of our members.\n\fMahch, 1928 Annual Report of flie Council for 1937 221\nThe Council also elected as Corresponding Member, Dr. Ubald\nTartaruga, of Vienna.\nOur Hon. Member, and former Secretary for Russia, Count\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, has kindly undertaken the task of\nreviewing several Continental periodicals connected \\vith psychi-\ncal research, so that our members will have even better\nopportunities than in the past of keeping themselves in touch\nwith work done on the Continent.\nThe third International Congress for Psychical Research was\nheld in Paris at the end of September, and the Society was\nofficially represented by Dr. WooUey, Mr. E. N. Bennett, and\nMr. W. H. Salter. As the question of compiling an inter-\nnational glossary for psychical research was being raised, the\n\u2022Council appointed a special Committee to consider the question,\nand this Committee drew up a short report, which was for-\nwarded to Paris. The Congress, however, decided to adjourn\nany definite decision as regards a glossary to the next Congress,\nrecommending that the different National Committees should\noccupy the interval in communicating their views to each\nother. With this object, our Society has got into touch with\nrepresentatives of psychical research in the United States of\nAmerica, so that if possible there may an agreed policy as\nregards the English terminology.\nAt the meeting of the British Association for the Advance-\nment of Science at Leeds in September, the President of the\nPsychology Section, Dr. William Brown, in his Presidential\nAddress, referred to the question of personal survival of bodily\ndeath, and described the Society's investigations as rightl}^ claim-\ning \" a place in modern psychological science.\"' In the same\nsection Dr. T. W. Mitchell read a paper on \" The Phenomena\nof Mediumistic Trance,\" which has been j)rinted in the current\nissue of the Hihbert Journal. No paper concerned with psy-\nchical research \" had been read at the British Association\nmeeting since 1876 (before the foundation of the Society),\nwhen one by Sir William Barrett was unfavourably received.^\nThe admission of the subject as worthy of consideration at\n^ We have since ascertained tliat in 1920 at a meeting of the British Association\nat CardifE Dr. Prideaux, of Nottingham, read before the Psycliological Sub-section of\nPhysiology (Section I) a paper entitled \"A Psychologist's Attitude towards Tele-\npathy.\" So far as we have been able to ascertain, this jiajjer has not been published.\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march, 1928\nthe 1927 meeting was therefore a further illustration of the\nincreased interest now being taken by organised science in\npsychical research, to which reference was made in the last\nAnnual Eeport.\nWith regard to the membership of the Society, 52 new-\nMembers were elected, 2 Associates were transferred to Member-\nship, and 2 Members who resigned in 1926 cancelled their\nresignations. On the other hand, 34 Members and 10\nAssociates resigned during the year. One Member became a\nCorresponding Member. 9 Members and 8 Associates died\n\u2022\n9 Members and 3 Associates were removed for non-payment of\nsubscriptions. The total membership now stands at 1,082, of\nwhom 612 are Members and 470 Associates.\nThe Council regret to have to record the death of several,\nmembers of long standing, including the Rev. Peter Dewar, Dr.\nWalter Leaf, for many years a Member of Council and a\nfrequent contributor to both Proceedings and Journal, Mrs.\nBiddulph Martin, Mr. Alfred E. Martineau, Miss Fehcia\nScatcherd, Mr. St. Loe Strachey, Mrs. H. J. Wilson, and Miss\nC. E. Simmonds, who left the Society a legacy of \u00a3200.\nFour parts of Proceedings, including Part 104 containing the\nLibrary Catalogue, which was circulated early in January,\n1928, were published during the year : Part 101 in January,\nPart 102 in June, Part 103 in November, and Part 104 in\nDecember.\nThe sales of the Society's publications at half-price to\nMembers and Associates amounted to \u00a346 6s. 7d., a decrease\non those of the last few years.

He was consulted\nin two independent cases in which great unhappiness and serious\nmental disturbance were being caused by a supposed obsessing\nspirit\u2014in each case the spirit of a dead person who had known\nthe patient well in Ufe. Dr. Prince, admitting to the patients\nthat he did not know whether there were such things as obsessing\nspirits or not, acted on the assumption that the supposed spirit\nwas a real independent individual, and arguing with it as such,\nsucceeded in persuading it to cease its persecutions\u2014at any rate\nfor a time experimentally\u2014with a view to seeing if this new line\nof conduct would not make it happier. The result was that the\nsupposed spirit took his advice, and a cure, apparently a per-\nmanent one, was effected.\nAfter describing in some detail the cases, which, by the way,\ndiffer in important respects from each other, Dr. Prince discusses\nthe question whether there reaUy was operating in each case a\nspirit distinct from the patients themselves. On the one side we\nhave to note that subsequently Dr. Prince tried vainly to cure\nby suggestion patients with a similar conviction of persecution,\n^ General Meeting.\n\f224 Journal of Society \/w Psychical Research March, 1928\nwhich, however, they did not attribute to a recognised dead\nperson. On the other side it does not appear that the supposed\nspirits manifested any knowledge or experience beyond the range\nof the patients' own. Dr. Prince slightly inclines, I think, to\nthe spiritistic hypothesis, partly on account of the dramatic con-\nsistency with which it works out in these cases. But he fully\nadmits that there are at present \" too few cases for the formula-\ntion of a law.\" I am not sure that in his discussion he gives\nsufficient weight to the hypothesis of a divided personality, with\na split-off portion as independent as \" Sally ''\nin Dr. Morton\nPrince's celebrated Miss Beauchamp Case.

This number\nbegins with an interesting account by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing of\npoltergeist phenomena at Kotterbach and Nikolsburg, Czechoslovakia.\nIn the first case chiefly stone-throwings were observed, in the\nsecond the \" phenomena \" were very abundant and very various.\nDr. von Schrenck has summarised the evidence sent him by M.\nWratnik, a school teacher who witnessed some of the phenomena.\nThe young people whom a sceptic would suspect were three in\nthe first instance and two in the second. In the account of the\nNikolsburg case the descrij^tions given of the occurrences are par-\nticularly inadequate, in fact, there are hardly any. In the\nnarrative relating to the Kotterbach case the writer (M. Wratnik)\ndescribes some stone-throwings witnessed by himself which, though\nnot convincing, are interesting. In an appendix a third case is\nmentioned\u2014the Kosten case ;\nhere, too, there were mysterious\nstone-throwings, but a natural origin seems still more likely than\nat Kotterbach, though Dr. Simsa, whom Dr. von Schrenck calls\nthe only student of \" paraphysical \" phenomena in Czechoslovakia\nknown to him, has expressed the belief that the origin of the\n\" hail of stones ... is to be sought in the spiritual world.\"\nProfessor Dr. Eduard von Liszt of Vienna relates the apparition\nof a \" mysterious light \" (not seen by himself) observed by several\npersons at Millniki, Galicia, Poland.

She\nlast attended a Meeting of the Society on the 1st December,\n1927.\nBoth as regards her own experiences and as regards psychical\nmatters generally, she retained a thoroughly critical and\nscientific attitude.\nAt various times during her life Mrs. Smithson contributed\ngenerously to special funds raised by the Society, and by her\nWill she left the Society a legacy of \u00a3500.\nMrs. Smithson was a woman of wide culture and varied\ninterests : not only psychical research, but also education,\nand the peace, women's suffrage and temperance movements\nengaged her active support.\nShe lived for the earlier part of her life at York, and later\nat Hitchin, where she jsresented a recreation ground for the\nspecial use of women and children.\nTHE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT.\nMrs. Brackenbury is now in regular attendance at the\nSociety's Rooms assisting the Hon. Research Officer.\nCASE.\nG. 294. A Case of Collective Hallucination.\nWe print below a case of an apparition of the dead being\nseen by more than one person at the same time. There is no\nveridical element, as the fact of death was known to one\nof the percipients. The interest arises from the fact that\nthe phantasm was seen first by a single percipient and then,\nafter an interval of about fifteen minutes, by the same per-\ncipient and a companion who had never heard of the dead man.\nBoth the percipients and also the place where the apparition\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1928\nwas seen are well known to Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Salter, arid\nMr. Salter's report of the case, after interviewing the witnesses,\nis printed below.\nMr. Salter's Report.\nIn the year 1900 an old man named Charlie C. died at the\nEssex village where these events happened. I have questioned\nseveral of his neighbours who knew him when alive, and they all\ndescribe him as an unusually short man, between four and five\nfeet high, habitually carrying a long stick, which he used for\ndriving his pigs (pig-keeping being his means of livelihood), and\nat the end of his lif,e having white hair and whiskers. Very few\npeople can estimate height accurately, and the figure given is\nprobably an under-statement, but it may be taken as established\nthat his shortness was exceptional and very noticeable.\nHe was found dead in his cottage one morning, having, accord-\ning to local tradition, spent his last hours in trying to unearth\nhis savings which were buried under the hearth. He was reputed\n\" close,\" and when some years later a small figure resembling him\nwas seen sitting on a stile a few yards from the site of his cot-\ntage (which no longer exists) it was supposed that Charlie C.\nhad come back to look for his hoarded wealth. I have not been\nable to ascertain exactly when his ghost \" was first seen : the\npercipients were two youths, one of whom was killed in the War,\nand the other has left the district, and cannot now be traced.\nThey reported what they had seen to a Mr. George H., who\nlived not far off, and the only importance of the incident evidenti-\nally is that the first percipient on the occasion I am about to\nrelate is a son of Mr. George H., who had heard family talk of\nCharlie C.'s ghost being seen.\nThe case was first reported to my wife and myself a few weeks\nafter the second appearance of the little old man, on the\n12th October, 1927, by the second of the two percipients. Miss\nEthel G., who mentioned it rather casually in connection with\nanother supposed supernormal occurrence, which was, in fact,\nnothing of the kind. Not until the lapse of some weeks further\ndid we hear sufficient details to make it worth while investigating.\nI thereupon interviewed both percipients, and took down their\nstatements. Miss G.'s statement was obtained first and is there-\nfore printed first here, as follows\n:\n\fApril, 1928 Case 229\nOn the 12th October, 1927, I was walking up [the] High\nStreet, going south on the west side of the road, with\nMr. Fred H., about 7.15 p.m. I was walking next the walk.\nThere was some moonlight. [The moon was full on the\n10th October.] As we passed the stile opposite [Mr. W.'s]\nhouse I saw a figure seated on the top rail of the stile. It\nlooked to me like an old, white-haired man, very small, as if\nwhen standing he could not have been much more than four\nfeet. He was wearing some sort of hat ; I think a slouch\nhat. He had white hair, but I could not see his face owing\nto the shape of his hat. I could not see what clothes he\nwas wearing. He held one hand out with a stick in it. I\ndid not stop to look more closely.\nAfter we had passed, as I did not recognise the man, I\nasked Mr. [Fred] H. who he was. He said he didn't know.\nOn the following Sunday I went to Mr. Fred H.'s house,\nand we started discussing things. I asked Mr. Fred H. if he\nhad ever found out who that little old man was. He turned\nto his mother, and she asked me what little old man I meant.\nI then described him. She said it was supposed to be the\nghost of the man who lived in the house which used to stand\nnear the stile and was burnt down. She said he had been\nfound dead on his hearth over where somp money of his had\nbeen buried. Mr. Fred H. then said, \" I knew all the time\nwho it was, but I wouldn't tell her (meaning me), as I\nthought she would be frightened.\"\nMr. Fred H., independently and without having seen Miss G.'s\nstatement, gave me the following account :\nI saw the old man on the stile about 7 p.m. when walking\nfrom my house to meet Miss G. He was between four and\nfive feet high, wore felt hat and overcoat, and dangled stick\nfrom his hand. I did not see his face then : I saw his grey\nhairs. He sat on top rail. I saw him again when walking\nwith Miss G. at 7.15. That was the first night I had seen\nhim.\nSince then I saw him three times in October. On these other\noccasions there was no moon. It was hard to see him then.\nI first heard about the old man appearing years ago : my\npeople talked of it.\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1928\nI forget the name : Charlie C, I think.\nIt is twenty-one years since the cottage was burnt down.\nHe died before that.\nI then read over Miss G.'s statement, and he added :\nHaving heard Miss G.'s account read over, I confirm it\nentirely.\n(Signed) F. H., Nov. 24 [1927].\nMrs. George H., when spoken to, generally confirmed Miss G.'s\naccount of the conversation at her house the following Sunday.\nShe is not, however, certain whether Miss G.'s mention of the\napparition preceded or not her own reference to Charlie C.'s ghost\nhaving been previously seen.\nMr. Fred H. is about twenty-five years old, and helps his father\nin a carting business : he was born in the village. Miss G. first\ncame to the neighbourhood not quite two years before her experi-\nence of October, 1927 : she is a trained children's nurse. Miss G.\nhas never previously had any similar experience. Mr. Fred H.\nand his father and mother are all predisposed to take supposedly\nsupernormal occurrences seriously. In particular, every year from\nOctober to Christmas they experience phenomena of a mildly\npoltergeist type in their own house.\nThe tradition of Charlie C.'s ghost does not seem to be widely\nspread in the village. It was unknown to Mr. W., who lives op-\nposite the stile, and has resided in the village over forty years :\nto the doctor, who has lived about fifty yards away since before\nthe War : to the tenant of the land lying just across the stile,\nwho uses the stile constantly by day and night to see after his\nlive stock; and neither my wife nor I had ever heard of the\n\" ghost \" till Miss G. told us of it.\nThe stile is of the ordinary kind : it is flanked on the north\nby a brick and rubble wall about four feet six inches high : be-\nhind the wall is a poultry run, six-foot wire netting supported by\nrough posts. On the north side of the stile is an ordinary farm\ngate, opening into pasture land. The site of Charlie C.'s cottage\nis about twenty yards further north.\nThere is a street lamp at no great distance, but it does not\nilluminate the stile direct : the light from it touches the wall ten\nyards from the stile, and is there cut off by an intervening cot-\ntage, thus, especially on moonless nights, creating a dark\n\fApril, 1928 Case 231\n\" pocket \" near the stile, which, however, gets a little faint light\nfrom Mr. W.'s house opposite, distant approximately eighteen\nyards. The moon was, however, at the time of the apparition a\nlittle past the full.\nThe possibility of some living person having been on the stile\nat 7 p.m. and again at 7.15 p.m. may, I think, be excluded. It\nis not a place where people sit on cold nights, and the weather\nwas distinctly cold then ; least of all would children be likely to\nbe found there ; and in view of Charlie C.'s almost dwarfish stature,\nnone but a child would be likely to'be mistaken for his \" ghost.\"\nApparently the approach of the poltergeist season in the H.\nhousehold, combined with family gossip as to Charlie C.'s \"ghost\"\nhaving been seen at the stile, produced a hallucination in Fred\nH.'s mind, which revived a quarter of an hour later and became\ntransferred to his companion, who knew nothing of Charlie C. or\nof the ghostly associations of the spot.\nW. H. Salter.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie. February, 1928.\nThe translation of Mr. Dingwall's report on \" Margery \" {Proc.\nS.P.R., Vol. xxxvi. Part 98) is resumed after a long interval, a\ndifierent translator being now employed.\nFrau Maria Leinv\/eber of Wohldorf, near Hamburg, narrates\nsome personal experiences in table-tilting. The experiences are\nremote and the account is uncorroborated, but Frau Leinweber\ninspires confidence as a narrator, and the paper is worth ponder-\ning over. Some of the incidents described undoubtedly suggest\ntelepathy from one of the sitters {not touching the table), and one\nincident (p. 76) goes beyond such an explanation. On the other\nhand, deliberate and repeated statements are described which are\nnot in accordance with real fact. On the whole the paper tends\nto revive in one the impression how abstruse, complicated and\nmysterious the subject is !\nHerr Florizel von Renter describes an interesting' case of auto-\nmatic writing connected with his visit to Ireland in company with\nhis mother. The incident, which occurred in August, 1927, at the\nRoyal Hotel, Giant's Causeway, certainly suggests at first sight\npost-mortem action by the deceased mother of the hotel-owner.\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1928\nProfessor A. Kronfeld continues to comment on Evelyn Under-\nbill's work, and Professor Richard Hoffmann of Vienna has an\narticle on \" j^arapsychical \" elements in St. Paul's experiences.\nStudienrat Dr. Olaf Garben of Hamburg discusses Indian con-\njuring and brings forward the evidence of a certain Herr Oscar\nSchlosser, who avers having been present in the autumn of 1911 at\na fakir performance at Singapore, at which sitting the photographic\ncamera failed to register some of the things the observers saw.\nHerr Schlosser's evidence is given at first hand (it appeared at first\nin the paper Hamburg 8 Ukr Ahendblatt of July 17th, 1927),\nand, whatever may be thought of it, is a valuable contribution\nto a very tantalising subject. I may add, as I have narrated\nelsewhere {Zeitschrift fiir Kritischen Okkuliismus, I. Band, p. 197),\nthat a similar statement was also made to me many years ago\nby an eye-witness. Unfortunately, all my efforts to get from this\nnaval officer a written account were of no avail\n!\nCount Klinckowstroem discusses the same fascinating problem.\nIn view of his well-known sceptical attitude, it is instructive to\nsee him discussing such cut-and-dried explanations of the whole\nmatter by fraud as M, Heuze's. On the other hand, I very much\nhesitate to endorse the conclusion apparently arrived at by\nDr. J. B. Moller, a Rostock physician, that mass-suggestion was\npractised by an Indian conjurer in 1919\u2014at the Copenhagen\n\" Tivoli.\" This, I confess, seems to me in the highest degree\nimprobable.\nStudienrat R. Lambert, who has, as is well known, made a\nspecial study of Eusapia Paladino's phenomena, prints a long letter\nsent him by Professor Courtier, the well-known author of a report\non E. P.'s seances given by her at the Institut general Psycho-\nlogique in 1905-190$. In this letter M. Courtier declares\u2014an in-\nteresting admission\u2014that he has always been convinced of the\ngenuineness of some of E. P.'s [table-] levitation phenomena, without,\nhowever, being in possession of data which would permit him to\nimpose this conviction on others.\n\" Has Psychical Research any Practical Value ? \" is the title\nof an article by Mrs. Helen C. Lambert of New York, who de-\nscribes in it the work done by Dr. Titus Bull.

Studienrat Lambert\ncalls attention in a footnote to the way in which Dr. Bull's\nmethods confirm those used by other researchers, such as Dr. Wick-\nland and Dr. Magnin.^ Whatever may be thought of the hien-\nfonde of Dr. Bull's presumption, this is surely a case of by\ntheir fruits shall ye judge them,\" or of \" the end justifying the\nmeans.\" If by taking \" spirits \" at their face value we can relieve\nany appreciable amount of human suffering, let the plunge be\nmade\u2014provided that it be limited to one narrow domain for\npractical purposes only.\nOut of the many notices contained in Kleine Mitteilungen I\nselect one which informs us of the foundation of an Austrian\nSociety for Psychical Research.

He concludes that in\nPsychical Research instruments of control are indispensable, the\nevidence supplied by these instruments being alone of any value\nfor science.\nThe Warsaw Society of Psycho-Physics prints a pwces-verbal of\nexperiments made with a canine celebrity, \" Bim,\" a \" bull-dog\nboxer \" belonging to M. Sadowski. In the presence of twenty-one\nmembers of the Society and the owner, the dog answers questions\nby a certain number of barkings, in accordance with a \" code\n\"\nagreed upon (one for \" yes,\" two for \" no,\" etc.). The dog has\nits eyes fastened on its master, and when it is blindfolded, the\nresults are negative. Still, two or three experiments succeeded,\nM. Sadowski being in another room and the door between the\ntwo being shut. The questions are, however, put aloud. The\ndog answers correctly that 2x3 = 6, that 2x2 = 4, that ^25 = 5.\nAltogether sixteen experiments are narrated. They justify us\nin wishing that such trials might be repeated.\n^Cf. Also Dr. AValter Prince's paper in Bulhtin No VI. of the Boston iSociety\nfor Psychic Research.\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1928\nTwo Societies print reports of their activities : the Polish\nMetapsychical Society founded in 1926 '(not to be confused ap-\nparently with a Polish Society for Psychical Research), and the\nWarsaw Psycho-Physical Society.\nI may be permitted to express the hope that henceforth these\nnumerous bodies will give more attention to the investigation and\nproper authentification of spontaneous cases than hitherto.\nA supposed spirit-photograph taken at a seance of Guzik's\nshows us two very orthodox spirit-forms dressed in white and\nfloating in the air : they contrast favourably with the materialised\nmonkeys, prehistoric men, etc., supposed to haunt this medium's\nsittings.\nM. Zytomirski has another article on the etheric body.\nDr. Czubrynski discusses at length the \" mediumship \" of Mme.\nSabira Huramowicz. The experiments narrated took place in the\nrooms of the Polish Society for Psychical Research and at Dr.\nSokolowski's. Most of these consisted of descriptions given by\nthe medium of persons who had been in contact with objects\nhanded to Mme. Sabira. The psychometric descriptions given were\nsometimes very detailed and in some cases exact. The medium\nwas rather vague so far as geography and time were concerned,\nand we are told that the prehistoric era was completely impene-\ntrable to her ! As in M. Ossowiecki's case, we are told, impres-\nsions connected with living beings were perceived much more\neasily than those connected with \" dead nature \" {martwa przyroda).\nSeveral instances are given which induce Dr. Czubrynski to believe\nthat the source of the knowledge shown is derived not from the\nobjects themselves, but from the minds of those present.\nP.-P.-S.\nEEVIEW.\nLeila Holterhoff Heyn et Rene Maublanc : Une education\nfaroptique. Decouverte du monde visuel par une aveugle.\nN. R. F., Paris, 1926. 224 pages. 10 fr. 50.\nM. Rene Maublanc, \" ancien eleve de I'^cole normale superieure,\nAgTege de Philosophic,\" tells us that after reading in 1921 Jules\nRomains' ^ treatise on paroptic vision, he felt that the subject\n^ Kmn de plume of M. Louis Farigoule, \" professeur agrege de I'Univer-\nsite \" (and author of the very witty but mechant play, \" Knocke ou le\n\fApril, 192S Review 235\nwas worthy of a thorough investigation. He was present at some\nexperiments (November 1922-January 1923), concluded that \" the\nfacts were undeniable,\" and tried then to investigate on his own\naccount. His first attempts were rather unsuccessful, when he\nlearnt that in September 1927 a Mrs. Leila HolterhofE Heyn had\nwritten M. Jules Eomains from New York saying she intended\ngoing to Europe and wanted to see him. She added that she\nwas blind, had studied psycho-analysis and medicine, and was\nwell known in New York. She arrived in Paris in December,\nbut M. Jules Romains was ill and advised her to apply to M.\nMaublanc.\nMme. Heyn has been completely blind since the age of a\nyear and a half, and has two artificial eyes. Two medical cer-\ntificates printed in the book attest her blindness, and the fact is\nabsolutely beyond doubt. This calamity has not prevented her,\nhowever, from studying at Columbia University and in Berlin and\nfrom understanding several languages.\nM. Maublanc called on her for the first time on 21st December,\n1924, but was able to begin his \" subject's \" education at the\nend of January only. He had altogether sixty-nine seances\n\u2014\nwith intervals\u2014the last described taking place on the 15th of\nOctober, 1925. Apparently other sittings have taken place since\n(p. 194), but we find no particulars about them.\nThey never lasted more than an hour, M. Maublanc tells us,\ngenerally three-quarters of an hour.\nHe began by putting Mrs. M. into a slight hypnotic trance,\nwhich together with M. Jules Romains he calls regime d. After\na very short time iVIrs. H. was able to plunge herself into that\nstate without external aid. Some subsidiary details were sub-\nsequently varied ; for instance, it was decided that after closing\nher eyes at the beginning for a short time she might open them\nagain after M. Maublanc had counted up to thirty, that her eye-\nlids should not feel tired.\ntriomphe de la medecine \"). The treatise in question is entitled La vision\nertra-retinienne et le sens ^woph'^ue. Paris, N.R.F., 1920. After some\ntheoretical considerations on the anatomy and physiology of the skin and\non experimental psychologj^ the writer narrates the result of his experiments\n(objective experiments with \"clairvoyants\" and blind people, subjective\nexperiments on himself), puts forward the explanations he thinks possible,\nand formulates a theory of his own : that of the ocells or microscopic\norganits {sic) of vision, localised in the human tegumen.\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1928\nThe first paroptic trials were attempted at the third sitting and\nindefatigably pursued up to the end.\nM. Bene Maublanc claims that by dint of education and per-\nseverance he has been able to make Mrs. H. \" see.\" \" She dis-\ntinguishes day from night, she knows the sun. She has created\nfor herself a whole new world, the world of colours and visual\nforms. She has learnt to know our visual signs, letters, numbers\nand drawings. She lives in another space. Her existence has\nbecome richer, has been transformed \" (p. 146).\nHe further tells us that Mrs. H. has become capable of seeing\nthrough the various parts of her body : through her face in the\nmain, more through her cheek-bones and eye-lids, she says, than\nthrough her forehead. Rather well through the fingers. A little\nthrough the nape of the neck {ibidem).\nOn the other hand, this \" vision extra-retinienne \" appears to\nbe most capricious. \" Why,\" asks Mrs. Holterhofi Heyn, whose\naccount (translated from the English) follows in the book that of\nM. Maublanc, \" was I unable in the course of a journey in\nSwitzerland and in Italy to see anything in the mountains ?\nWhy, on the contrary, in my good days, was I able to perceive,\nin a gondola, the water of Venice ? Why did it even give me\nan almost pleasant feeling of colour ? Why can I on certain days\nperceive objects at a distance and not those which are close to\nme ? Why have I never seen the sky whilst being sensible of\nthe sun \"\n(p. 193).\nTo the Psychical Researcher the experiments dealing with the\ndiscerning of colours and\u2014especially\u2014the reading of words are\nundoubtedly the most interesting by far. It is difficult not to\nfeel strongly impressed by the accounts. So far as the colours\n(red, blue and yellow chiefly) are concerned the results obtained\nexceed most undoubtedly what chance-coincidence can produce\n:\nstill mistakes are in most cases not infrequent. But when it\ncomes to the word-reading chance guessing is altogether out of\nthe question. I will content myself with two or three examples\nsufficiently striking. The first is particularly deserving of atten-\ntion, because the sitting in question is one of the very few when\na third person was present (the lady companion, who may have\nbeen present at all\u2014see further on\u2014has preserved on the subject\na complete silence).\nOn 12th October, 1925 (68th seance), M. Rene Maublanc pulls\n\fApril, 1928 Review 237\nout of his pocket a copy of the newspaper Le Quotidien, and\nrequests Mrs. Heyn to read the title. At first she finds out that\nthe letters are red, she then reads the following letters : i, n, i,\nd, e, n. She then says the first is a capital G, confusing it\nwith Q. . . . She then reads n, a (corrected as o), then ti,\" and re-\nconstitutes the word Quotidien. She fails to see the \" Le (p. 145).\nM. Andre Cusenier, a friend of M. Maublanc, is present at the seance.\nOn 23rd September, 1925 (64th sitting), M. Rene Maublanc places\nunder a sheet of glass in a small frame a piece of white pasteboard,\nupon which he has written in Indian ink and in capital letters, 5-6\ncentimeters high, the words \" Vision extra-retinienne \" in two lines.\nMrs. H. begins by recognising the number of lines and the\nlength of each line. She then reads separate letters in the\nfollowing order : R, e, n, i, t, e, o. She begins to place them in\norder, reading r, e, i, n, t. She inserts the t \" at the third\nplace and quickly completes the word \" retinienne.\" She then\nrecognises \" extra \" and \" vision \"\n(p. 137).\nOn 8th October, Mrs. Heyn reads \" without difficulty \" (but\nafter some groping) the word \" Volonte \" (being the name of a\nnew paper which has just appeared) and the word voloir \" (for\n\" vouloir \"), the leading article being so entitled. Two days later\nshe reads the word Mistress \" (sic) preceding her own Christian\nname and surnames, and guesses that her own name is meant.\nIn this case, again, the words are written in Indian ink upon a\npiece of pasteboard and are placed under a sheet of glass ;\nthey\nare 5-8 millimeters high (p. 143). (Of course, practically the\nexperiment amounts here almost to the reading of one word only.)\nSuch results are, it will be admitted, extremely remarkable.\nUnfortunately, they are undoubtedly vitiated to a certain extent.\nM. Maublanc tells us that it was \" quite necessary to guide\nthe subject at close quarters {de tres pres), and to encourage\nher at every moment. It is impossible to let her toss about\nalone. Could we teach a child to read if we do not encourage\nit, if we do not correct its mistakes ? At a test sitting {seance\nde controle), where a possible fraud must be eliminated, those\npresent obviously must not help the subject. But at education\nsittings such help is indispensable \"\n(p. 71). Possibly it is : the\nwhole question is how far the help afforded by the experimenter\ngoes. In the Rene Maublanc-Mrs. Holterhoff Heyn case I am\nafraid it went pretty far.\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1928\nOn the other hand, one must not exaggerate matters. Judging\nby Mrs. HolterhofE Heyn's account which follows M. Maublanc's\nthis lady is not only highly cultured, but quite a personne d'elite.\nHer interest in the experiments was both individual and scientific.\nIs it possible to believe that she was deluded ? that she believed\nherself to see, when, as a matter of fact, she was merely prompted\nby her teacher, who was simply suggesting to her what she was to\nsee ? Surely such an explanation is inadequate.\nUndoubtedly both accounts are sadly wanting in some par-\nticulars. Telepathy is hardly mentioned as a possible explanation ;\ninvoluntary whisjDering is, I believe, not mentioned at all. As\nI am writing these two words my memory goes back some forty-\ntwo or three years. I had when a boy a teacher who was in\nthe habit of whispering himself the answers to the questions he\nput me. I very often availed myself of this\u2014undoubtedly uncon-\nscious\u2014habit. I do not think the explanation of the results\nobtained by M. Maublanc lies in such whispering (much less\naudible than in my teacher's case), which might have been uncon-\nsciously picked up by Mrs. H. H. and then externalised and\ntransformed into alleged vision. But surely such an explanation\nought not to have been lost sight of\n!\nMme. Heyn's lady-companion was present, M. Maublanc tells\nus (p. 31), at the sittings, though it is not quite clear if she was\ninvariably present. If so, her testimony would have been very\nvaluable. It is not given.\nIn most cases\u2014as my readers may have judged by themselves\n\u2014the description of the experiments is far too brief. In some\ncases this brevity is almost irritating. Mrs. H. H. tells us, for\ninstance, that \" a few days ago I was able to decipher a word\nquite alone. It took infinite time, and I was as tired as I would\nhave been after a whole day's work. Still I succeeded, and\nI had exactly the impression a little child has when reading its\nfirst word \" (p. 192). It does not even occur to the writer\n\u2014\na most distinguished, in fact a superior woman, I repeat, judging\nby her own account\u2014to explain to us Jww she ascertained that\nshe had correctly deciphered the word !\nOn p. 126 M. Maublanc tells us that on 7th September (1925)\nMrs. H. H. stated to him that she went to the Comic Opera the\nday before, and .saw very distinctly the stage and the artistes.\n\" She can see, however, only one person at a time. If she fastens\n\fApril, 1928 Revietv 239\nher eyes upon him when he ajjpears on the stage she can follow\nhis movements.\"\nNo evidence whatever is given that in such a case\u2014similar to\nnot a few others\u2014we have not to deal with a purely subjective\nimpression. Such inability to distinguish between what may be\nsubjective and what is undoubtedly objective is disconcerting.\nScientifically speaking, the book Une education paroptique leaves,\ntherefore, much to be desired. Still, it is a fascinating book\nwritten with obvious sincerity and in good faith. Also a very\npuzzling book\u2014of which the bibliographical part (pp. 203-227) is\nnot, perhaps, the least interesting. P.-P.-S.\nSHOKT NOTICES.\nThe Mind. Edited by R. J. S. McDoavall.

Some Evidence Obtained at Recent Sittings with\nMrs. Leonard and Mrs. Brittain.\nWe have received through Miss H. A. Dallas a report on\ncertain incidents which occurred at two sittings, one with Mrs.\nLeonard, the other with Mrs. Brittain, at which Miss Dallas was\npresent, in the first case as note-taker, in the second as sitter.\nThe sitter at Mrs. Leonard's was a friend of Miss Dallas's,\nMrs. John, and the sitting took place on August 20, 1926\n;\nMiss Dallas's sitting with Mrs. Brittain took place on the follow-\ning day.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1928\nIn sending an account of these incidents to the Editor,\nMrs. Salter, Miss Dallas wrote as follows :\nInnisfail, Crawley, Sussex,\nMarch 1, 1928.\n... I enclose an account of an experience I had in 1926. I\nthink you may like to print it in the Journal. . . . Mrs. John is\nquite willing that her name should be printed, but please do not\nprint her address. . . .\nH. A. Dallas.\nWith this letter were enclosed the two following statements :\n1. Statement by Miss Dallas.\nDuring the month of August 1926 I visited Mrs. Osborn Leonard\nin the capacity of note-taker with a friend. The interview was\nlong and satisfactory ; one of her two sons appeared to be com-\nmunicating the whole time. Towards the end of the sitting one\nor two remarks were addressed to me. The communicator told\nme that when my time came to pass on I should not have a\nlong illness, but I should just \" drift out.\" Needless to say I had\nasked no questions, and I was too intent on taking notes to be\nthinking of my own concerns.\nOn the following day I had an appointment with Mrs. Brittain\nfor myself. After a while, during which messages from my own\nrelatives were given, I asked :\n\" Is there any message for the\nfriend I was with yesterday ?\n\" I gave no name or information\nconnected with her. At once the response came ; both sons were\nreferred to and messages were given inclusive of details of which\nI was ignorant ; for instance, the father's name was mentioned.\nThis I did not know, as my friend had been a widow for some\ntime when I first made her acquaintance within recent years.\nThen, unsolicited, I was told :\n\" You will not die of disease, you\nwill just drift over.\" Almost the same expression was used as on\nthe previous day. I was not anxious about my health, and I was\nquite unaware of the fact that I should have to go into hospital,\nbefore the close of the year, for a serious operation, which has\nbeen successfully performed.\nThe incident seems to me worth recording and sending to our\njournal, because it seems to indicate that the same intelligence\nwas in communication on successive dates through two mediums.\n\fMav, 1928 Case 245\nand it suggests that this intelligence wished to give me some\nassurance with regard to my health, which was quite unsought,\nand in view of future events, more opportune than I knew.\nI may add that I had never seen or known my friend's son,\nbut that the statement was made at the interview with Mrs.\nLeonard that he had come into contact with relatives of mine in\nthe Unseen life. This might account for his being able, through\n\" Feda,\" and through \" Belle,\" to give the message which I re-\nceived on both occasions. jj ^ Dallas\n2. Note by Mrs. John.\nThere is a very interesting sequel to this sitting with Mrs.\nOsborn Leonard. Miss Dallas, who had kindly taken notes for\nme, returned home with me to spend the night, as she had an\nappointment the following morning with Mrs. Brittain at thv\nL.S.A. We were both very tired, so did not discuss the ex-\nperience much, and the notes being very straightforward did not\nneed revising. Before leaving in the morning Miss Dallas asked,\nwould I like her to ask Mrs. Brittain if there was any message\nfor me ? I gladly fell in with her kind thought and the result is\nhere given.\nAfter receiving some evidential messages herself during a pause,\nshe asked :\n\" Is there any message for the friend I have just left ?\n\"\nThe answer came :\n\" She is better for your visit \" (which was very\ntrue). It went on :\nThere is a boy here who was killed flying. Such a lovely\nboy\u2014broad in figure but rather thin ; 19 to 23 years of age.\nI hear Mum and Mater. A brother with him slightly taller\nthan the other boy\u2014two\u2014brothers\u2014one jolly, loving, affec-\ntionate, the other more reserved. I also get a short name,\nlike Jim. They say they know their father better now.\nH. A. D. Can they send her a message ?\nGive their love. She did something for one that she did\nnot do for the other. They are so glad she has pulled herself\ntogether. There is another brother\u2014in the body\u2014they are\ncalling him the Kid\u2014very nice (Mrs. Brittain then said some-\nthing which gave her the impression they wanted to chaff\nhim and she added) : They would like to pull his leg.\nHer husband, two sons, and her mother who passed on\nrather suddenly.\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mat, 1928\n(A name Lily or Lizzie was then mentioned.) She is very\nwell in herself, and going on as they would wish. They are\nvery satisfied with what she is doing, that she has settled down\nafter being the Wandering Jew.\" (This was twice repeated,\nas if it were specially to be impressed on H. A. D.).\nNow I think these messages simply extraordinary in view of the\nfact that I was not there, nor anyone nor anything connected with\nme. Mrs. Brittaiu is I know a wonderful psychometrist, but this\ngoes beyond.\nTo take the messages in their sequence :\nMy eldest boy was not killed while flying, but he was in the\nflying corps at the time of his death, and his passing on was so\nsudden and unexpected that it was a very reasonable error to\nconclude that he was killed while flying.\n[This error was not due to thought transference from me, as I\nknew that both the sons died in their beds. H. A. D.].\nThe physical description though scanty was good, for he was\nremarkably broad for his height which was medium. He was 30\nwhen he died, but both he and his brother looked much younger\nthan his age.\nThe Mater too is good. Thousands of boys call their mothers\nMum, as my second boy did, but my eldest son invariably ad-\ndressed me and wrote to me as \" Mater,\" a rather uncommon\ntitle in these days.\nHis brother was slightly taller, and the character description of\nthe two is exact.\nJim \" was the name of my husband, and to understand the\nreference they made to him I must explain. There had been\nan estrangement for some years, though they always retained\ntheir afiection for him.\n[I was quite unaware of this, and of her husband's name.\nH. A. D.].\nI nursed one boy for nearly four years ; the other had pro-\nfessional nurses for the short time he was ill.\nThe other brother, in the body, is clearly my youngest son, and\n\" the Kid \" was one of their many titles for him ; their chaffing\nand leg-pulling at his expense when in his later teens is well\nremembered by all who knew them.\n[This detail and the nickname were quite unknown to me.\nH. A. D.].\n\fWay, 1928 Case 24,7\nThen their mutual satisfaction at my settling down after being\nthe Wandering Jew very clearly refers to the fact that we are\nnow settled in a house that is a real home, after living in flats\nand hunting about for a suitable house for many years ; so that\ntaken altogether I think this experience of Miss Dallas on my\nbehalf really remarkable.\nThe only error as far as I can tell was about my mother ; but\nas I was only two when she died Mrs. Brittain may be right about\nthat ; nor do I recognise \" Lily \" or \" Lizzie.\"\nM. John.\nIn reply to a subsequent enquiry by Mrs. Salter, Mrs. John\nwrote that her eldest son had died on February 26th, 1919,\nand the yoiinger on January 31st, 1923. Miss Dallas never\nmet either of these young men ; her acquaintance with Mrs.\nJohn began on April 17th, 1923.\nTHE CASE OF THERESA NEUMANN.\nWe print below a short history of the remarkable case of stig-\nmatisation which has recently occurred at Konnersreuth, and\nhas aroused widespread interest. This account is derived from\nvarious reports published from time to time in newspapers and\nperiodicals (chiefly foreign), for most of which we have to thank\nCoimt Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nThe subject of the experience is a Bavarian peasant girl,\nTheresa Neumann of Konnersreuth, now twenty-nine years old.\nA report of the case by the Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J.,\nappeared in The Month for June 1927 ; from this report, which\nis founded on a series of articles by Universitats-dozent Dr.\nJohn HoUnsteiner, contributed to Die Pforte of Nuremberg, we\nquote the following extract, giving the early history of the\ncase\n:\nDown to the time of the war [Theresa Neumann] is said to have\nbeen strong and healthy, and in the spring of 1918 she was doing\nheavy field work as a farm hand. At that date a fire accidentally\nbroke out in the homestead where she was employed, and to pre-\nvent this from spreading every available recruit was called upon\nto form a chain and pass buckets of water from hand to hand to\n\f24)8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1928\npour upon the threatened out-buildings. As a result of three\nhours spent in this strenuous exertion Theresa collapsed, sufiering\nintense pain in the lumbar region. She did not at once resign\nherself to the life of an invalid. On the contrary she struggled\non with her work till the autumn, doing odd jobs about the farm,\nbut another severe strain, incurred at this time, brought on an\nattack of paralysis, or at any rate something of that nature, which\nmade her a permanent cripple and confined her to her bed. In\n1919 an affection of the eyes supervened and she lost her sight.\n. . . She did not pray for the restoration of her health, but on\nApril 29, 1923, the day of the beatification of Sceur Therese of\nLisieux, whom she had always honoured with a simple childlike\ndevotion, her sight was quite unexpectedly given back to her.\nHowever, she still remained bedridden and a cripple. Two years\nlater, on the day of the canonization of the same holy Carmelite\n(May 17, 1925), as she seemed to be passing through some strange\ncrisis, the parish priest, her confessor, was called to her. He\nfound her entranced, her eyes immovably fixed upon vacancy, her\nhands outstretched, her face radiant. A few minutes later she\nsuddenly sat up in bed, a thing which for six years had been\nquite beyond her power. She stated positively that she would\nnow be able to stand and walk, and her mother found that her\nleft leg which had so long been doubled up under her had become\nnormal and was now extended like the other.\nAfter this there was for some months a general improvement\nin the girl's condition, although in November 1925 \" an acute\nattack of appendicitis was diagnosed which rendered it impera-\ntively necessary to operate that same evening.\" Of this she\nseems to have been cured in a few hours in response to prayer,\nand the doctor was \" able to satisfy himself that all trace of\ninflammation had disappeared.\"\nThe characteristic phenomena of stigmatisation did not occur\nuntil shortly after Shrove Tuesday 1926, when \" blood began\nto run from both eyes.\" Father Thurston notes\nthe rather curious coincidence that for some little time before\nthis the case of Elena Ajello, which was being studied patho-\nlogically by Professor Bianchi of the Naples University, had been\nmuch discussed in the Catholic newspapers. Tears of blood formed\none of the most striking features in the ecstasies of Elena, and\n\fMat, 1928 The Case of Theresa Neumann 249\nwhile we have no thought of hinting that Theresa was fraudu-\nlently, or in any way consciously, imitating the Italian ecstatica,\nthe whole subject of suggestion is so mysterious and the action of\nmind on body has been as yet so imperfectly investigated, that\nwe cannot exclude the possibility of some influence from this\nsource. Before Passion Sunday, without any assignable cause,\nthere appeared on the left breast, in the region of the heart, a\nwound which at times bled profusely but did not suppurate. But\nit was only on Good Friday itself that the climax was reached.\nOn that day she became a spectator, as it were in a vision, of\nall the scenes of our Lord's Passion, and, like so many other\nstigmatics, enacted them in some sense in her own person, suffering\nat three o'clock the very pangs of the death agony. Besides this\nshe felt cruel pains in her hands and feet, and since that time\nhands and feet have been marked with traces of wounds, normally\ncovered with a brownish scab, but in certain weeks in which she\npasses into ecstasy on the Friday, opening and discharging clear\narterial blood.\nIn December 1926 Dr. Hollnsteiner witnessed the phenomena\nof ecstasy, and his account of them is given by Father Thurston.\nSince that time the case has taken on another remarkable\nfeature in the shape of a long period of almost complete\nfasting. Numerous references to this development will be foimd\nin the various foreign publications quoted or described below.\n1. In the Vossische Zeitung (morning edition, August 17, 18, 19,\n1927) are three articles on Theresa Neumann by Dr. Wolfgang\nvon Weisl. Dr. von Weisl observed Theresa personally and at\nlength on one afternoon only, but he had the opportunity of dis-\ncussing the case with other persons who had observed it from the\nbeginning. He personally examined the wounds on the hands,\nwhich gave him truly the impression of having been produced by\nnails. Dr. von Weisl concludes his articles by proclaiming his\nbelief that conscious imposture is out of the question. He also\nrepudiates the explanation of the case by hysteria and admits the\ngenuineness of the stigmata, due in his opinion to the human will,\nstrengthened by a three years' illness, dominating the body\n(souverdne Beherrschung)\n.\nThe real difficulty in the case begins for Dr. von Weisl with the\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1928\nalleged fact that Theresa Neumann does not seem to have absorbed\nany food for about seven months. For fourteen days she was\nclosely watched in this respect by four Sisters of Mercy, whose\nconclusions were favourable to her claims. Still Dr. von Weisl is\ninclined to think that the girl takes some food at night in a\nsomnambulistic state, and recommends that in order to test this\nhypothesis, she should be transferred to a clinic, where she could\nbe effectively controlled. (The Germania, the leading German\nRoman Catholic organ, makes the same recommendation as Dr.\nvon Weisl. See an article on September 17, 1927, by Dr. Wun-\nderle of Wiirzburg.)\n2. The Frankfurter Zeitung for September 8, 1927, has an article\non the case by Herr Karl Wurzberger. This article, however, adds\nlittle to what has already been noted, and it need only be said\nthat Herr Wurzberger accepts the genuineness of the stigmatisation\nand regards the alleged fasting as the most remarkable feature of\nthe case.\n3. In the Kdlnische Zeitung of September 13, 1927, Dr. Rolf\nReissmann has an article on \" The Konnersreuth Occurrences,\" in\nwhich he asserts the genuineness of the phenomena, in particular\nof the stigmatisation. He gives an account of the ecstasies which,\nhe admits, produce a deep impression even on those familiar with\nintense pathological cases. He finds the explanation of the pheno-\nmena in auto-hypnosis conditioned by the religious surroundings of\nTheresa Neumann's existence. In this connexion Dr. Reissmann\nmentions the extraordinary precision with which the ecstasies begin,\nalso some muscular contractions common both to Theresa Neumann\nand to hypnotic subjects. He refers to the researches of Roth as\nproving that in the case of women when certain regular physio-\nlogical processes are violently disturbed (which has been the case\nnow with Theresa for some years), other bleedings begin regularly\nto take place.\nDr. Reissmann then discusses some aspects of the visions seen\nby Theresa in her ecstasies, which to him are evidence of their\nnot being connected with the traditional teaching of the Catholic\nChurch, e.g. the fork-shaped form of Christ's cross. He points-\nout the similarity existing on this point, as well as others, between\nTheresa's visions and those of Catherine Emmerich, and suggests\nas an explanation telepathy, Theresa tapping some mind in her\nentourage to whom Catherine's visions are familiar. The same\n\fMay, 1928 TJie Case of Theresa Neumann 251\ntheory is postulated to explain the Aramaic words pronounced by\nTheresa in the presence of Dr. AVutz.\nTheresa's fasts\u2014to him the most interesting fact in the whole\ncase from the scientific point of view\u2014Dr. Reissmann declines to\ndiscuss, though obviously inclining to admit their authenticity.\nHe concludes by recommending that Theresa should be transferred\nto a convent where her case could be studied at leisure by a\nCommission including both Roman Catholic and official men of\nscience.\n4. The Oberhirtliche Verordnungsblatt fur die Diozese Regensburg\n(Nov. 10, 1927) prints an official statement, dated October 4th,\nAvhich certifies that the ecclesiastical enquiry into the Neumann\ncase is \" quietly and firmly going on.\" It states that Theresa\nwas closely watched day and night for fifteen days by four nuns,\nwho had been sworn in and then specially instructed for two days\nby Dr. Seidl of Walsassen. Two nuns had Theresa under constant\nobservation ; she was regularly weighed ; various researches of a\nmedical and chemical character were also made. It was ascer-\ntained that Theresa had not taken any food at all during the\nperiod in question (except the Host and a small quantity of water\nto enable her to swallow it). The official statement records as a\npeculiarly enigmatic fact that in spite of this complete fast two\nconsiderable decreases in weight were followed by approximately\ncorresponding increases. At the end of the period of observation\nthe Franciscan nuns were sv.'orn in again. Theresa did not keep\nher bed during this period.\nDr. Seidl came to Konnersreuth nine times during the fifteen\ndays, two of these visits taking place unexpectedly at night.\nProfessor Ewald of Erlangen [see below] also attended occasionally.\nThe Bavarian Catholic clergy are authorised by the Bishopric of\nRegensburg to make such use of this statement as they think fit.\nOne of the most important and comprehensive statements of\nthe case which has yet appeared is by Dr. G. Ewald, professor\nof psychiatry at Erlangen, to whom reference is made above.\nA copy of this report, which appeared originally in the Mmichner\nMedizinische Wochenschrift, has been published in pamphlet form\nunder the title Die Stigmatisierte von Konnersreuth (J. F. Lehmarm,\nMunich), and may be seen in the S.P.R. Library. We print\nbelow a short abstract of some parts of it.\n\f252 Journal 0\/ Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1928\n5. Dr. Ewald gives a detailed account of the stigmata, and also\nof the ecstasy, as he himself witnessed it on July 29th, 1927.\nHe describes it as an \" impressive spectacle,\" even to the eyes of\na critical doctor. As to his general opinion of the case he refers\nto it as one of \" clearly defined, unusually severe Unfallhysterie.\"\nFrom 1920 to 1925 the girl remained without medical attendance\nunder the exclusive care of her parents and the village priest.\nHer thoughts became thus concentrated on religious subjects. On\nApril 29th, 1923, Theresa was suddenly cured of her hysterical\nblindness ; on May 17th, 1925, she had a vision of *S'\/. Therese de\nLisieux or de I'Enfant Jesus, canonised on that day, and was cured\nof her paralysis. In November 1925 she fell dangerously ill with\ninflammation of the caecum, but almost on the eve of the operation\nwas again suddenly cured, the abscess ('\" Douglas abscess \") unex-\npectedly bursting. In all this Dr. Ewald sees nothing miraculous.\nThe origin of the stigmata he considers to be of a \" clearly\npsychogenic nature, and to be sought in particularly intense auto-\nsuggestion.\" He admits that nothing like genuine stigmatisation\nhas ever been produced by hypnotic and experimental suggestion,\nbut points out that \" experiences experimentally induced from\nwithout are always inferior to a genuine inner experience in in-\ntensity and power of efEect.\"\nHe then comes to what he considers the crux of the whole\nmatter. Theresa claims not to have taken solid food since\nDecember 25, 1922, and not even to have taken any liquid, except\na very small quantity of water to enable her to swallow the Host,\nbetween December 23, 1926, and July 1927, when she was put\nunder special observation for a fortnight, that is to say, during a\nperiod of seven months. This claim Dr. Ewald regards as quite\nincomprehensible (scJilechterdings unbegreiflich) for medical reasons\nwhich he gives. With regard to the special period of observation\nDr. Ewald speaks very highly of the scrupulous care with which\nthe four nuns discharged their duties, and analyses the results\nobtained in detail. He detects no flaw in the investigation, and\nadmits that nothing suspicious was observed in the course of it ;\nhe still, however, maintains a sceptical attitude for the following\nreason : twice during the period of observation Theresa lost weight\nand twice recovered this loss.^ Such increases of weight, says\n^ The losses were of about 8 lbs. and 3 lbs. respectively during the times when\nshe experienced ecstasy ; the corresponding gains about 6 lbs. and 5 lbs.\n\fMat, 1928 The Case of Theresa Neumann 253\nDr. Ewald, are inexplicable (\" denn aus tiichts wird nichts \"), and\nhe therefore concludes by urging strongly that Theresa should be\nput under observation in a clinic, where her case could be in-\nvestigated without bias of any kind.\n6. In the Frankfurter Zeitung of November 25 and 26, 1927,\nthere is a report on Theresa Neumann by Dr. Richard Stephan,\nGhef-Artz der Medizinischen Klinik des St. Marienkrankenhaus.\nDr. Stephan accepts the authenticity of the phenomena and speaks\nhighly of the facilities for enquiry which were allowed him. He\nsays that the Regensburg Bishopric did all it could to have the\ncase investigated in a clinic and that Theresa and her parents\nhad\u2014though reluctantly\u2014given their consent, but withdrew it\n' owing to the awkwardness of a young physician.\" He appar-\nently accepts the phenomenon of fasting not only during the con-\ntrolled period, but for a time before and after this, for he refers\nto \"a complete cessation in the taking of food and drink for a\nperiod of nearly twelve months.\" He does not, however, see\nanything miraculous, even in such a fact. The Konnersreuth\nphenomena offer to biology, he says, facts unknown only from the\nquantitative, not the qualitative point of view. The marvel of\nthe human organism is only extended in an extraordinary way.\nThe domain of the supernatural \" which many seek and no one\nfinds \" has not been reached at Konnersreuth. The real expla-\nnation of the riddle seems to Herr Stephan to lie in the com-\nbination of childlike simplicity beyond the normal on the one\nhand, and on the other an intensity of faith unexampled for\ndecades.\n(As Count Solovovo points out in commenting on this article\n\" a scientist who admits as authentic a case in which a human\nbeing absorbs no food for a year, and yet sees in this only a\nquantitative, not qualitative, extension of our knowledge of the\nhuman organism, whilst flatly rejecting a supernatural or spiritistic\nexplanation, could hardly be brought to believe in any miracle\nwhatsoever.\")\nNo further startling developments appear to have occurred in\nTheresa Neumann's case up to the present time ; the usual\nphenomena of ecstasy and stigmatisation were observed in\nPassion Week of this year.\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1928\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\nThe following list of the more important pamphlets and articles\ndealing with the case has been sent to us by Herr Willy K.\nJaschke, of the Parapsychological Laboratory, Munich.\nAngerer, Albert :\n\" Das Phanomen von Konnersreuth,\" Wald-\nsassen, 1927. 90 pp.\nBunzen, Dr. L. van :\n\" Wunder und Ratsel der Stigmatisation,\"'\nPfuUingen. 28 pp.\nDiisseldorfer Tagblatt :\n\" Das Eatsel von Konnersreuth,\"\nDiisseldorf, 1927. 104 pp.\nEwald, Dr. Gr. :\n\" Die Stigmatisierte von Konnersreuth,\"\nSonderabdruck aus der Miinchner Medizinischen Wochen-\nschrift, Miinchen, 1927. 49 pp.\nFink, Pfarrer Joh. :\n\" Eine Fahrt nach Konnersreuth,\" Ludwigs-\nhafen, 1927. 63 pp.\nGeiger, Th. :\n\" Die Stigmatisierte von Konnersreuth, Ab-\nwehrgedanken zu den Gutachten von Dr. med.

Sinel's book, The Sixth Setise, in the\nJournal for November, 1927, I pointed out that his theory of the\nfunction of the pineal gland as an organ for receiving telepathic\ncommunications rested very largely on a number of remarkable\nexperiments which Mr. Sinel conducted some fifteen years ago, but\nthat he had produced no corroboration for his interpretation. I\nalso stated that Professor McDougall and I had gone over to\nJersey to witness these experiments in April, 1914, but had found\nourselves quite unable to endorse them, because Mr. Sinel's\nmethods were so careless that they permitted to the sensitive\nnormal perception of the pictures with which she was supposed to\nbe impressed telepathically. I was aware that my review was\ndamaging to Mr. Sinel's claims, but as I had informed him at the\ntime of the explanation we had adopted, and he had attempted\nno reply, I did not think he would contest it now.\nNeither has he sent any protest to the Journal, in which my\nreview appeared. But quite a little controversy has arisen about\nhis book in the Literary Guide, which is, I believe, the organ of\nthe Rationalist Press Association. Mr Sinel's book was sponsored\nby Dr. Macleod Yearsley, a constant contributor to the Literary\nGuide, and was very favourably reviewed in the October Number.\nIn the January Number there appeared a very temperately worded\nletter from Dr. Ivor Tuckett drawing attention to my adverse\nreview of The Sixth Sense and quoting relevant extracts. In the\nFebruary Number the Editor apologized to Messrs. Sinel and\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 19^8\nYearsley for publishing this letter. In the March Number he\npublished extracts from a longer document sent in by Sinel, in\nwhich he alleges that I was present at some very astounding\nsuccesses of his sensitive in April, 1914. I at once wrote a brief\nbut complete disavowal of Mr. Sinel's recollections ; but the Editor\nhas refused to publish it.\nIn order therefore that Mr. Sinel's experiments, endorsed as they\nseem to be in high Rationalist quarters, may not delude the un-\nwary, it seems necessary to state that my memory was totally\nblank as to happenings of the sort Mr. Sinel now describes, and\nthat it is quite incredible that if they had occurred, we should\nnot have been eager to go on with the investigation of his sensi-\ntive. Still it seemed possible that as the human memory is pro-\nverbially fallible, mine might be as destructive of what had\nhappened as his seemed to be creative of what hadn't ; so I\nobtained from the archives of the Society the contemporaneous\nReport on the case, dated 19th April, 1914, which I had sent to\nMrs. Sidgwick. There I found no mention whatever of most of\nMr. Sinel's successes ; the one exception was an experiment with\nthree Greek letters to which, according to Mr. Sinel, \" the reply\nwas exact.\" But my account of this was that \" nothing was\nproduced that the girl could not have seen, owing to the way he\n[Mr. Sinel] held the pictures, except some Greek letters (inter-\npreted as a scrawl) which I believe to have been an inference\nfrom the motions of my pencil.\" I had previously remarked that\nthe girl was \" as sharp as a needle, noticing everything and draw-\ning clever inferences from the movements of the pencil in writing,\"\nand explained in this way a subsequent partial success at\nmy last sitting, when I had to turn my back upon the lady, in\norder to draw a diagram. It is clear, therefore, that even at the\ntime the impression left on my mind was practically total failure.\nAnd it is obvious that even the best reproductions of pictures\nprove nothing, if the medium is allowed to see the originals.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\n\fMay, 1928 Correspondence 257\nCORRESPONDENCE\nConcerning the Annual General Meeting.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMarch 11 , 1928.\nMadam,\u2014In the account of the recent Annual General Meeting,\npublished in the Journal for March, 1928, I see that two words\nexpressly inserted in one of my questions at that meeting have\nbeen omitted in the published version (p. 212).\nMy second question was, \" How many physical mediums had\nbeen visited or investigated by the Hon. Officers during 1927 ?\n\"\nBy the omission of the words \" or visited,\" the fact that no\nattempt whatever was made to discover if any physical mediums\nwere worth investigating was suppressed. Now since from March,\n1927, until January, 1928, the Hon. Research Officer has had the\nfullest and freest opportunity to carry out his own policy, and that\npolicy is, according to his own statement at the General Meeting,\nto do nothing, may it not possibly explain the curious position of\nresearch during my last year's tenure of office in 1926, when as\nhe truly stated at the meeting, no physical mediums were in-\nvestigated ?\nFinally, lest it be thought that my own inactivity, which to\nthose who know me appeared so inexplicable, was carried over to\nmy private enquiries, may I add that in that period, when under\nthe control of Dr. V. J. WooUey, no physical mediums were in-\nvestigated by the Society, I had Willi Schneider staying in my\nhouse for seven weeks ; visited Braunau during my annual vacation\nin order to see Rudi Schneider, and, in company with persons\nkeener on research than the Society's Hon. Officers, obtained a\nsitting with a remarkable medium in London, whose exploits\nhave been the subject of a considerable literature.\nE. J. Dingwall.\nReply by Dr. V. J. Woolley.\nFrom the shorthand notes of the meeting it appears that both\nMr. Dingwall and the Editor are slightly in error. He actually\nused only the word \" visited \" with no mention of investigation.\nThe point, however, does not seem very important, because even\nMr. Dingwall would hardly contend that the Honorary Officers\nshould spend their time and the Society's funds in visiting mediums\n\f258 Journal of Society Jar Psychical Research May, 1928\nunless some sort of investigation, however perfunctory and in-\nadequate, was at least aimed at.\nNo statement that I made at the meeting could possibly be\ninterpreted as a statement of a policy of doing nothing, and I\nthink that Mr. Dingwall must have misunderstood me on this\npoint. I said that I did not consider it proper to use the\nSociety's funds in paying for occasional sittings in mixed circles\nwith the ordinary professional physical mediums, because such\nsittings would almost certainly be fruitless. To the best of my\nrecollection Mr. Dingwall, in all the time that I had the pleasure\nof working with him, never named one physical medium that he\nthought one of us should visit in such a way. If he had ex-\npressed a wish to visit one I am perfectly certain that neither I\nnor any other officer of the Society would have discouraged him\non financial or any other grounds.\nMy recollection on this point is I think borne out by the last\nparagraph of his letter. His own \" private enquiries \" did not\ninclude such visits as he thinks the Society's oflicers should make.\nWhen he has to consider how to spend his own time and money\nto the best advantage, he entertains one remarkable medium for\nseven weeks, he visits another in Austria for several sittings, and\nonly attends one sitting in London, and that one (if I have guessed\nhis medium correctly) only after receiving a preliminary report\nwhich made him consider it worth his while to go.\nIn his own private enquiries he has followed exactly and pre-\ncisely the policy which he so blames the Society's officers for\nadopting, the policy of spending comparatively large sums on a\nfew noted mediums rather than of scattering odd guineas among\nthe advertisers. The only difference lies in the fact that the\nreports of the Society's work are available for students either at\nthe office or in our publications, while Mr. Dingwall's results, if\nany, are not.\nV.

Many of these are known already to members of the\nS.P.R., from whose most valuable records the author abundantly\nborrows ; others are comparatively unknown or forgotten. To one\nof the two latter categories belong, e.g., the experiments conducted\nby Professor Richet with Stella in the presence of a young\nfriend of his whom he calls Martin,\"\" experiments which seem\nstrongly to tell in favour of telepathy from the latter (pp. 84-86) ;\nhis experiments with the hidden alphabet \"'\n(pp. 92-94) ; and the\nvery curious experiments made by MM. Heymans, Brugmans\nand Weinberg in the psychological laboratory of the University of\nGroningen with a young student called Vandam (pp. 153-156).\nM. Richet rightly says he does not quite understand why the\nlatter have been so little mentioned, and undoubtedly no less\nrightly suggests that this omission is due to the very scientific\ncharacter of the trials in question (p. 153).\nOf much interest is the chapter devoted to the author's own\nexperiments with Ludwig Kahn (pp. 178-192). I know what may\nbe urged against them. I confess that the results look suspicious\nboth on account of Ludwig Kahn's antecedents and because of the\nvery exactness with which the contents of the pellets are read.\nWe are not used to such exactness and accuracy in results\nobtained through \"second sight\"! Another suspicious circumstance\nis the close similarity which exists between the performances of\nLudwig Kahn and those of Bert Reese (to whom, it is true.\nProfessor Richet also thinks it worth while to devote a chapter,\ndoing him, in my humble opinion, too much honour) ; and again\nanother is the multitude of the pellets used. What happens to\none pellet only may probably be easily watched ; this watching\nbecomes singularly complicated when there are four. Of this the\nauthor involuntarily affords us a proof on p. 181 : he says he\nwrote four pellets, but gives us the whereabouts of only three\nof them. Nor is the evidence in this clairvoyant's favour much\nenhanced by the account of his successful performances before\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1928\nM. Maurain, the Paris Prefect of Police, given on the testimony\nof Ludwig Kahn himself (p. 188). And yet the categorical\ncharacter of Professor Richet's statements in favour of the\nlatter's genuineness impresses me. I urge that here is a prima\nfacie case for investigation, and I hope this clairvoyant (in whose\nperformances there is at least no room for that tiresome explanation,\nchance coincidence) may be tested before long under crucial test\nconditions.\nWhilst willing to admit telepathy, Professor Richet prefers to\npostulate as an explanation of most cases of supernormal know-\nledge vibrations du reel or vibrations de la realite. In such a case,\ne.g., as that of Mrs. Green, who, in London, sees her niece. Miss\nAllen, being drowned in Australia, he thinks it more probable\nthat a scene taking place at the Antipodes should impress\nMrs. Green's brain \" tout comme une onde hertzienne emise de\nSydney va se transmettre a un recepteur T. S. F. de Londres \" ;\nand prefers such an explanation to that of Miss Allen's thought\nmaking \" le tour de la terre pour aller frapper a Londres le cerveau\nde Mrs. Green\" (p. 219).\nProfessor Richet would prefer to explain by thought-transference\nonly those cases where an internal thought, an internal act of\nwill are transmitted, not manifesting themselves by any external\ngesture (p. 221). He mentions in this connection some experi-\nments of Dr. Ochorowicz's. It may be doubted, however, whether\nthese cannot be explained by unconscious whispering, coupled\nperhaps with hyperaesthesia in the sensitive. Professor Richet\ndoes not favour, it is true, the hypothesis of an enormously\nintensified hyperaesthesia (p. 230 ; such as that suggested by\nDr. R. Baerwald, I may add) ; but he is willing to postulate\nhyperacuity of audition to explain the telepathic experiments of\nProfessor Gilbert Murray (p. 200) : in both cases rightly, I think.\nThe chapter of Professor Richet's book devoted to Mrs. Piper\nsuggests the following remark. I do not think that the system\nof condensing into a few lines the results obtained by the sitters\nat a seance with a trance medium is likely to give us a faithful\npicture of what occurred, any more than if the same method\nwere applied, e.g., to a slate-writing seance. An instance of the\nmisleading character of this method is afforded us on p. 148. It\nis not true that the surname \" Rodney \" given by \" Uncle\nJerry \" to Sir Oliver Lodge as that of a boy thrashed by Uncle\n\fMat, 1928 Reviews 261\nJerry's brother Frank was subsequently ascertained to be the true\nsurname of the boy. As for the thrashing itself\u2014well, such un-\nfortunate incidents are so common in the lives of at least ninety\nout of ninety-one human boys that I for my part decline to\nattach to such \" tests \" any evidential importance.\nThe way in which Professor Richet condenses \" the late\nProfessor Hyslop's experiences with the Boston medium further\nexemplifies what I say. In the few lines he devotes to them\nmention is made of various incidents which may\u2014or must\u2014\n\u2022\nappear striking to the uninitiated reader (p. 151). As a matter of\nfact, I entirely agree with the late Mr. Podmore that neither the\nspirit hypothesis nor telepathy are required to explain the Hyslop\nrecords.\nIt is characteristic of Professor Richet's attitude that he does-\nnot say one word in Notre sixieme sens on the whole subject of\ncross-correspondences, as if the latter were entirely non-existent.\nThese cursory remarks\u2014and in particular the last one\u2014are cer-\ntainly not intended to detract anything from the value of a\nfascinating book by one of the fathers of modern \" metapsychics,\"'\nwhom we all respect and admire.\nP.\u2014P.\u2014S.\nII. Die Problems des Mediumismus. By Prof. Dr. J. M. Verweyen^\nStuttgart, F. Enhe. Pp. 224.\nSince the War German professors have evinced a growing interest\nin Psychical Research, and among them the philosophers have been\nconspicuously active. To Prof. Oesterreich of Tubingen and Prof.\nMesser of Giessen, Prof. Verweyen of Bonn must now be added\nas a contributor to the literature of Psychical Research. His\nwork shows good knowledge of the extant evidence, a com-\nprehensive view of the theoretic problems involved, with a full\nappreciation of the alternative interpretations, and a sound critical\nattitude, which comes out specially in the distinction he makes\nbetween being personally convinced by an experience (Erlebnis) and\nunderstanding it as a part of scientific knowledge (Erkenntnis).\nIn his very interesting and candid final chapter on his own ex-\nperiences describing sittings with Willy Schneider, Frau Silbert,\nEleonora Zugun and others, he admits that his experiences have\nimpressed and convinced him and hopes that they will pave the\nway to scientific knowledge. At the same time there are indi-\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat. 1928\ncations in his book that he is perhaps somewhat easy to impress.\nFor he considers that \" spirit-photography has raised the objec-\ntive reality of \" teleplasm \" above all reasonable doubt (p. 120),\nthinks that modern astrology deserves to be called an empirical,\nscientific study (p. 58), though he sees the difficulty of accounting\nfor the genesis of its doctrines in this fashion, and approves of\nthe dangerous argument that the detection of fraud need not shake\nthe belief of those who have already convinced themselves of the\nexistence of genuine mediums (p. 40). I call this argument\n\" dangerous,\" because there is always a possibility that there was\nan undetected flaw in the evidence which seemed convincing at\nthe time, and the subsequent detection of fraud may render this\nprobable or even certain, while the memory of the past experience,\nvery naturally, resists correction. It is important therefore to\nuphold the principle of scientific method that every case of scien-\ntific \" fact \" is for ever open to revision, alike whether this tells\nfor or against the alleged facts. No scientific hypothesis either\nproves or maintains itself save by continuing to be the best ex-\nplanation in the field. Lastly, it should be pointed out to Prof.\nVerweyen, as a case in point, that it is not now safe to base any\nargument for the reality of physical phenomena on Crawford's\naccounts of Kathleen Goligher (cf. p. 38, 109-10). Dr. Four-\nnier d'Albe's exposure was rendered crushing, not so much by\nhis own observations, as by the way in which the Goligher family\naccepted it.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nDr. R. Tischner has kindly sent me a copy of Number 1\/2 of\nhis attractive periodical Der OkkuUismus, now, alas, defunct. On\np. 26 we see the photographic reproduction of one of the\nZollner \" knots obtained with the late Russian medium Sambor.\nThe seance in question took place at Riga on Sept. 20, 1896.\nDr. Tischner, in whose possession the mysterious knot\u2014or rather\nIcnots : there are two of them on the string\u2014now is, reproduces\npart of the account by Frau Margarete Ehmke, in whose house\nthe sitting took place, from the Psyehiche Studien of 1904. As\ndescribed, the phenomenon is almost inexplicable by conjuring.\nFour persons are present, including the medium ; a candle is\n\fMat, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 263\nburning ; the medium's hands are held (throughout 1) \u2014I may men-\ntion that Sambor's hands were as a rule held quite satisfactorily\u2014\n;\nthe first knot is tied then and there, the visiting card, to which\nthe ends of the string had been fastened with sealing wax, visibly\nmoving under the eyes of the sitters ; the second knot is formed\nafter the visiting card and string have been taken by Frau Ehmke\ninto another room and placed there in a small toilet case. Sub-\nstitution seems difficult because six persons (of whom some at\nleast were physicians) had written their names upon the card, and\nalso because Frau Ehmke had impressed on the sealing wax a\nseal with her coat-of-arms. I may mention that this case of\n\" Zollner \" knots with the late Russian medium is not unique.\nOf course such accounts as Frau Ehmke's cannot carry conviction^\nand the whole case for the \"Zollner\" knots is made almost hope-\nless by the most suspicious reputation of their initiator\u2014Henry\nSlade. Still, after reading Frau Ehmke's narrative, I can only repeat\nthat if there is a physical medium who is entitled to be acknow-\nledged as genuine (should the authenticity of the physical pheno-\nmena be ever admitted) it is surely the late, much-lamented by\nme at the time, Stepan-Fomitch Sambor.\nIn Zeitschrift fiir Psychische Forschung for January Dr. E.\nMattiesen pursues his examination of trance-phenomena and Pro-\nfessor Dr. Christoph Schroder his description of Frau Rudlofi's\nPhdnomenik. The protocols embrace this time the period from the\n3rd of October, 1926, to the 9th of April, 1927. The character of\nthe incidents is the same as before ; it is spontaneous or at least\nsemi-spontaneous, thus by no means calculated to make observation\neasier. Herr J. Macourek's account deals with recent experiences\nwith Frau M. Silbert : I will refer to it when it is finished.\nIt is very satisfactory to see that the \" Institute for Meta-\npsychical Research \" of Berlin-Lichterfelde-Ost makes an urgent\nappeal through Professor Schroder to the readers of the Zeitschrift\nfor accounts of \" metapsychical experiences.\" One such account is\nalready printed, and it makes a praiseworthy attempt to make\nthe evidence satisfactory. We much hope that the appeal will be\nlistened to and that something may be done in Germany to save\nfrom oblivion at least a small part of those spontaneous cases\nfrom which we have so much to learn.\nMeanwhile Hofrat Prof. Max Selling prints a series of incidents\nfrom his own experience. One relating to a veridical dream ex-\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1928\nperienced by a gentleman who did not know him personally at\nthe time, but who noted at once in his note-book that on May\n19th he would have a talk with Hofrat Selling about his leaving\nthe Theosophical Society (which dream came true !) is very be-\nwildering indeed. My attention has been chiefly arrested however\nby another case in which a Frau Fordan relates to Herr Selling\nhow her step-brother appeared to her several months after his\nviolent death. In this case it is particularly interesting that Frau\nFordan saw on \" Hubert's \" body various marks which appeared\nthere\u2014unknown to her\u2014only after his death (his wife rubbing the\nbody much in the region of the heart, etc.). We are irresistibly\nreminded of a case printed in our Proceedings many years ago\n(vol. vi, p. 17) where a dead sister appears to her brother with a\nscratch on her face, which scratch had been involuntarily produced\nby the mother after the dead girl's body had been laid into the\ncoffin. In such cases telepathy from the living, not from the\ndead, is obviously suggested as an explanation\u2014at first sight at\nleast. The Seiling-Fordan case is however very remote (December\n1899) and given us at second-hand.\nRevue Spirite Beige, January and February, 1928.\nIn the January number the text of a lecture delivered by\nM. Fourie, a painter, at Baroness de Watteville's is published, the\nlecture describing the \" materialisations \" at Mantes-sur-Seine\n(Journal S.P.R., October 1927, p. 125). M. Fourie is very cate-\ngorical on the subject and claims to have recognised the form of\nhis son. The testimony of a M. Melusson is given, who says he\nsaw the medium and the apparition simultaneously, and the ques-\ntion of fraud is to some extent discussed.\nIn the February number M. J. Thiebault (cf. Journal S.P.R.,\nibidem, p. 126) has a paper on the same subject. Even a super-\nficial reading reveals suspicious circumstances, e.g. when M. Thie-\nbault mentions that \" Madeleine \" has her lips covered with a\ncordon blanchdtre and speaks of her masculine appearance. He\nadmits that there are too many sitters (M. Fourie speaks of 18-25)\nand mentions that the head of the alleged son of M. Fourie was\nnever seen. The most curious feature at these seances is the\ndouble recognition : of \" Madeleine \" by her parents, and of\n\" Daniel \" (Fourie) by his father. In this connection, however, I\nwould refer to the present Italian Canella-Bruneri case which clearly\nshows, I think, that extraordinary and persistent mistakes in\n\fMay, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 265\nrecognition are liable to occur, not only in the darkness or semi-\ndarkness of the seance room, but even in everyday life. From\nthis point of view this Italian imbroglio seems to me peculiarly\ninstructive.\nRevue Metapsychique. January-February, 1928.\nDr. Osty prints a second instalment of his paper on the \" Border-\nland of Classical Psychology and Metapsychical Psychology.\" This\ntime the case of M. Augustin Lesage is dealt with, a miner, born\nin the Pas-de-Calais Department in 1876, who paints without ever\nhaving learned painting, which fact is attested inter alia by a\ncertificate delivered by the Mayor of Burbure, where M. Lesage\nlives. Hitherto fifty paintings have been produced, of which\nnumerous reproductions (one coloured) are given. Dr. Osty admits\nthat the first picture only (all are of an ornamental character) has\nto be accounted for : all the others can be explained by \" the\nacquired technique.\" He sums up the problem as follows :\n\" A miner, without any artistic heredity which could be de-\ntected, who up to the age of 35 lived in surroundings devoid of\nevery artistic stimulus, believes himself under the suggestion of\ncertain incidents to have been chosen by a '\nspirit ' to be that\nspirit's living instrument of painting. After having made four\ndrawings with pencil and covered with paint four pieces of paper,\nhe scatters over nine metres of cloth a great diversity of beautiful\ndecorative subjects, of which the execution presupposes good know-\nledge of drawings and of colours as well as of the use of the\nbrush ; also rich power of invention in an ornamental genre\napparently archaic and not imitated\" (p. 31).\nM. Lesage believes himself to paint under spirit-influence ; at\nfirst his sister Marie, then Leonardo da Vinci, then Marius de\nTyane (unknown : Apollonius of Tyane was a well-known miracle-\nmonger of the first century a.d.).\nAn experiment in painting in the dark has. Dr. Osty tells us,\nfailed completely.\nM. Robert Desoille, an engineer, prints a valuable contribution\nto the study of the psychological effects of peyotl from personal\nexperience. Various aspects of the problem are described and dis-\ncussed, among others the effect of auto-suggestion and \" hetero-\nsuggestion.\" The connection of the whole subject with our re-\nsearches is, however, slender.\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1928\nProf. Charles Richet prints two fascinating pages a propos of\nKarl Th. Bayer's Grundprobleme der Astrologie and concludes\n:\n\" No, astrology is no science.\"\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie. March 1928.\nThe translation^ of Mr. Dingwall's report on \" Margery \" is\nbrought to an end. It is followed by Mr. Malcolm Bird's \" Present\nposition of the Margery mediumship \" (British Journal of Psychical\nResearch, November 1927).\nDr. Arthur Kronfeld brings to a close his discussion of the\n^'\nValue and Problematik of Mysticism.\"\nTwo papers follow dealing with Dr. Rosenbusch's accusation of\nCountess Wassilko-Serecki of connivance at Eleonore Zugun's alleged\nfrauds. The first informs us that two Munich courts of law have\nin succession declined to take into account the complaint lodged\nby the Countess against her accuser. From the judicial stand-\npoint the matter must be regarded as erJedigt. Thereupon the\nCountess takes up herself the pen and defends herself on some\ntwenty pages in a very matter-of-fact, energetic, and spirited way.\nThis plaidoyer certainly deserves attention. We are promised\nfurther and apparently more or less convincing evidence re the\nE. Z. alleged mediumship in the next number of the Zeitschrift.\nMeanwhile we note with satisfaction that the Countess is by no\nmeans such a \" defenceless woman \" as stated in the same review\nsomewhere last year.\nIn Kleine Mitteilungen Professor Dr. Ludwig calls attention to\nan article published in 1926 in a German missionary organ, Stern\nder Neiden, in which a certain Brother Wollseifer gives evidence as\nto telepathic and clairvoyant powers possessed by Australian\naborigines. This is of course very possible, though prudence in\ndrawing positive conclusions in this respect seems to me to be\nespecially desirable in view of what I will call the Central African\n(and in particular the Congo) precedent. In the latter case it is\nevident that the natives have at their disposal a wonderful system\nof signalisation which seems to me to deal a fatal blow to all\nsupernormal claims. General Lettow-Vorbeck, the defender during\nthe world-war of ex-German East Africa, relates that he was in-\nformed\u2014most obviously in this way\u2014of the approach of a German\ndirigible, which had; however, to turn back before reaching him.\n(Cf.

Some time\nsince the Neues Wiener Journal (quoted in the November number\nof the Z. f.

(Paris).\nThis review is strictly Eoman Catholic, almost all the contri-\nbutors being, I believe, Jesuits. It is the more interesting to note\nthe appearance in such an organ of an article by Henr}- de France\nentitled \" Dowsers of To-day.\" The \" sourciers \" in question are\nFrench priests of whom the author of the article speaks in words\nof the highest praise. The chief are : Abbe Bouly, cure at Hardelot ;\nAbbe Mermet (who seems to be the oldest of aU) of St. Prex,\nSwitzerland ; Abbe Lucchini (Corsica) ; Abbe Charle (Wismes, Pas\nde Calais), and others. The methods used are various : for in-\nstance Abbe Mermet is using a pendulum. Abbe Bouly two um-\nbrella haleines joined together, etc. In this way very extraordinary\nresults are said to be obtained, from the discovery of shells on\nbattle-fields to that of bodies of dead bishops in cathedrals, not\nto mention underground water, ore, etc. It should be stated at\nonce that the evidence as judged by our S.P.R. standards is in-\nadequate to substantiate all these claims, and that from the\nevidential standpoint the Etudes article can hardly be said to add\nmuch to our knowledge of the subject on the positive side.\nIt should be added that two of the priests mentioned in the\nfltiides article were recently tested in Belgium in sympathetic sur-\nroundings under ecclesiastical auspices, but, as I am told on good\nauthority, failed to vindicate their claims. The latter, judging by\nsome of their public pronouncements, may well be termed in some\nrespects almost preposterous. P.\u2014P.\u2014S.\nPsychic Science, Vol. vi. No. -i. January, 1928.

M. Sudre\npoints out that this whole question of human radio-activity haB\nfallen into doubt and disrepute because\nthe greater part of the existing research on human radiation\nhas been prosecuted by metapsychists who are not physicists,\nand who have not even had a very clear understanding of electro-\nmagnetic radiations. . . .

Mr. Bligh Bond inclines to the\nhypothesis that the case is one of the \" action of another intelli-\ngence working through the pony and using the brain mechanism\nof the pony in a mediumistic sense.\" The weak point of these\nexperiments is that Mr. Bligh Bond never succeeded in getting the\nanswer to any question, when it was provably unknown to Mr.\nBarrett.\nThis number also contains the first instalment (introductory) of\nProf. Christian Winther's \" Experimental Enquiries into Tele-\n\f270 Journal of Society \/o?'

Sudre concludes by designating as \" rubbish \" predictions\n\" founded upon the course of the stars, the properties of numbers,\nor the figures on playing cards.\" True prevision of the future\n\" is closely linked with the rest of metapsychics, that is to say,\nwith telepathy and clairvoyance. It depends upon the meta-\ngnomic faculty, which perhaps exists in a latent form in all\nmen.\"\nPsychic Research. February 1928. Monsieur Rene Sudre has\nan article on \" Clairvoyance and the Theory of Probabilities,\" in\nwhich he discusses the application of mathematics in determining\nwhether the result of any given experiment can or cannot be\nattributed to chance alone. He mentions in particular the\nexperiments with cards which Miss Jephson is at present carrying\nout in connexion with this Society, and indicates one or two\npoints which he considers important in the tabulating of results.\nThe conclusion to which M. Sudre comes is that the field of\npsychical research lies mainly in a region in which statistics play\nlittle or no part. \" As Bergson has remarked apropos of a\nphenomenon of the phantasm of the living type, statistics have\n' This paper was read at a Meeting of the S.P.R. on December 1, 1927.\n\fMat, 1928 JVotes on Periodicals 271\nno meaning here.

'\"\nIt will be seen,\" Mr. Bird concludes,\n\" from all this that experiments of apparently very simple subject\nmatter may turn out to involve psychological questions of extreme\ndifficulty.

He witnessed phenomena with all the mediums, but\nwas not successful in getting any under conditions affording\nevidence of supernormality.

The\nconditions under which the sittings were held were those laid down\nby the mediums and their friends.\nDr. Prince's detailed account of his experiences and observations\nand his discussion of them will be found of great value to anyone\nentering on investigation of the physical phenomena of spiritualism,\nwhether with these particular mediums or others.

Pp. 66.\nMarch, 1928.\nThe Bulletins of this Society are following each other with great\nrapidity. The present one consists of extracts by Mrs. Keene from\nher records of automatic writing and trance speaking in the years\n1919 to 1925 ; the automatists concerned being herself and \" Jane,\"\na friend and member of her household. Jane was the more\npowerful medium of the two and the only one who went into\ntrance, but it is an interesting point that \" except for an occa-\nsional short message it was necessary for [Mrs. Keene] to touch\nJane while she was receiving a communication.\" This experience\nresembles that of Mr. S. G. Soal, who I believe can write auto-\nmatically only when another automatist is touching his hand.\nThere was in these sittings no habitual control to act as an inter-\nmediary like Mrs. Leonard's Feda. But there were some frequent\ncommunicators who sometimes introduced others, and there were a\nconsiderable number of communicators, known and unknown, pass-\ning across the stage, as it were, in some cases only once or twice.\nThe characterisation of different communicators was very distinct,\nand was maintained with dramatic consistency.\nThe extracts published are selected either as in varying degrees\nevidential \" or in other ways interesting. There is also an im-\nportant chapter on the development of Jane's automatism from\nthe ouija board to writing with a pencil and then to visions and\ntrance speaking, together with the sensations of the automatists\nand the views expressed by communicators as to the process of\ncommunicating. The paper is an interesting and important one,\nand should certainly be read by all students of automatic writing\nand trance speaking.\nE. M. S.\nERRATUM.\nS.P.R.

W. Baggally.\nThe deeply-regretted death of Mr. W. W. Baggally on March\n14th, 1928, deserves more than the short note in which only\nit was possible to announce it in the April Journal. In him the\nCouncil have lost not only a valuable friend but a colleague\nwhose experience in the physical side of the Society's work\nwas unequalled by that of any other of its members.\nHis interest in the subject was, like that of probably the\nmajority of other serious investigators, based on a hope of\nbeing able to find an experimental proof of survival. With\nthis object he began upon the spiritualistic road, attending\ncountless private meetings and, with infinite patience, observing\nwhat took place. In this way he experimented with Eglinton,\nCecil Husk, Mrs. Corner, Miss Showers, Boursnell, Miss\nLydia Manks, Mrs. Wreidt, the Zancigs, the Thompsons and\n\fJune, 1928 Obituary 277\nmany others without, however, ever reaching conviction.\nHis quiet, patient and kindly methods seldom led to any\ndramatic exposure, and his conclusions were seldom revealed\nto any but his close associates, but were, as to 99 per\ncent., absolutely and positively hostile to any claim to the\nsupernormal quality in what he saw.\nIn 1896, dissatisfied with the standard of evidence ruling,\nat that time at all events, among the majority of spiritualists,\nhe joined the S.P.R., and in 1902, in consequence of his great\nexperience and of his exceptional quality as an investigator,\nowing to his knowledge of and practical proficiency in conjuring,\nhe was invited to join the Council. In 1909, doubts having\narisen regarding the justice of the claim to finality of the\nnegative conclusions of the Cambridge experimenters with\nEusapia Palladino, he was selected as one of a Committee of\nthree, the others being Dr. Hereward Carrington and Mr.\nEverard Feilding, to go to Naples to conduct further experi-\nments with that medium. His conclusions are contained in\nhis personal contributions to the committee's Report, but may\nbe summarized as stating his positive conviction (probably for\nthe first and only time in his life) that he had repeatedly\nwitnessed phenomena of a supernormal kind, i.e., that raps had\nbeen heard, objects moved and levitated, and lights produced\notherwise than by any fraudulent manipulation. These con-\nclusions, however, contributed little to the main interest of his\nlife, the search for evidence of survival. Some, even, of the\nspiritualistic adherents of Eusapia in Naples, while claiming\nthat her \" higher \" phenomena, such as telekinetic happenings\nof a prolonged purposive character, and materialisations, were\nobviously of spirit origin, expressed the belief that the pheno-\nmena which had so impressed the committee were probably due\nto a merely extra-physical faculty of the medium herself.\nMr. Baggally therefore turned more and more to the cross-\ncorrespondences as being more scientifically evidential of extra-\nmundane origin, and they became his sheet anchor for a\nbelief in a future existence.\nDuring a great part of his long association with the Council\nit was to him that recourse was chiefly had when occasion\narose for the investigation of a new medium or of a case of\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research junb, 1938\nspontaneous phenomena reported to the Society. It was seldom,\nthat such an appeal to his experience and skill was made in\nvain, and although of late years his increasing infirmities\nnecessarily put a term to his activities in this way, his\nattendances at Council meetings remained almost pathetically\nassiduous to the very end.\nTHE FIRE WALK.\nWe print below an account of a recent experience in fire-\nwalking. A discussion of this phenomenon by Andrew Lang,\nwith a number of first-hand statements from persons who had\nexperienced or witnessed it, was published in S.P.R. Proc.\nVol. XV., pp. 2-15. Also of interest in this connexion are the\n\" fire-tests \" observed at sittings with D. D. Home. It will\nbe remembered that Home claimed not only to be able to\ntouch red-hot coals himself without injury, but on occasion to\ntransfer this power to the sitters (see, e.g. Lord Dunraven's\n\" Experiences in Spiritualism with D. D. Home, Proc. S.P.R.,\nVol. XXXV., p. 135).\nThis case has come to us through Sir Oliver Lodge, to whom\nMr. E. A. C. Stowell, the father of one of the witnesses, wrote\non 26th December, 1927, enclosing a copy of letter received from\nhis son, Mr. V. E. Stowell, of the Imperial Bank of India.\nExtract from Letter dated Bombay, 2Qth November, 1927, written by\nV. E. Stowell:\nI had a peculiar experience the other day when I and the\nQuinns went along one evening to a fire-walking display. There\nwas a waste plot of land shut in by hoardings, and in the middle\nwe found a large bonfire and a \" fakir \" in a kind of dressing-\ngown. The show hadn't been advertised, but was in aid of the\nhospital and there were seats all round. In a short time the\nfire was raked level along a shallow trench about 12 feet long,\nand we were told we could walk through without getting burnt.\nSeveral \" wogs \" went through barefooted, and then Quinn and\nI took our shoes ofi and did bkewise, though in socks, and felt\nnothing. It seemed weird enough over blazing embers, but\n\fJune; 1928 The Fire Walk 279\nafterwards rushes were piled on and blazed up 2 or 3 feet and\nwe went through again. I had white trousers on but they weren't\nsinged even. While people were going across in single file the\nfakir was worked up in a terrific state of excitement, but every\nnow and then the power \" appeared to leave him and he\nwould shout out ' Bus Bus \" (enough). He shouted this once\nwhen Quinn hadn't quite got over, and before he could hop off\none of his feet was slightly scorched. We roared with laughter.\nThat alone shows it's genuine, but apparently the man has been\nexamined by scientific societies all over Europe, etc. We talked\nto an Indian who is well-known to Quinn and he said this fakir\nwas the only one in existence with this power, which was passed\nthrough his family each generation. The fakir was very emaciated\nand had nothing to eat all day. After the show he was pros-\ntrated, with rolling eye-balls. I had heard of fire-walking by\nfakirs themselves, but how he enables other people to do so is a\nmystery.\nIt sounds hard to believe, but I am certain there was no fake,\nand the fire was too hot to sit close to. There was a native band\nin attendance, and at the end they all went through the fire\nplaying quite gaily, and the drums weren't injured. I never saw\nanything so ludicrous as some of these fat Parsees solemnly\nmarching through with bare feet, and sometimes holding a child\nby each hand. I had woollen socks on, but they weren't even\nfrizzled.\nIt is all very mysterious, and, of course, we are accused of being\n' tight \" by people who weren't there.\nAfter quoting the above extract Mr. E. A. C. Stowell con-\ntinues thus :\n\" Quinn \" is tramway manager in Bombay. The writer lives\nas a paying guest with Mr. and Mrs. Quinn, who have been in\nIndia for a long time.\nFire-walking by a single individual seems intelligible as an\nexample of the mind's power over its own body, as illustrated in\nhypnotic phenomena, ''\nstigmata,\" etc. But that others, not\nhypnotised, and not even credulous, should be enabled to do the\nsame thing opens a new chapter.\nThe writer of the letter is a light-hearted youth in his twenties,\nis quite unimpressed, \" roars with laughter,\" etc. It is not\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jdne, 1928\nhis mind which produces the effects. Neither is it \" collective\nhypnotism.\" Children are dragged through the fire. Also, the\nfact that the last man's feet were instantly scorched when the\n\" power \" failed is undesignedly evidential.\nBut what \" mental power \" can prevent fire from burning ?\nIf it can, what do we begin to know of the relation of mind to\nmatter ?\nE. A. C. Stowell.\nOn receiving the above communications the Hon. Editor,\nMrs. Salter, wrote on 28t]i January, 1928, to Mr. V. E. Stowell,\npointing out that in. his original letter it was not clear whether\nthe fire-walkers had passed along the whole length of the\ntrench (given as about twelve feet) or had walked across it\n(width not given) ; it would be desirable to have a more exact\nstatement on that point. She continued : -\n. ,\nYou mention that your experience was shared by your friend\nMr. Quinn. We should be greatly obliged to Mr. Quinn if he\nalso would send an account of the experience, not only because\nit is interesting to have more than one independent report of these\ncurious events, but because Mr. Quinn had an experience, which\nyou did not share, when, owing to exhaustion on the part of the\nFakir, he suddenly became aware of the heat of the fire and his\nfoot was slightly scorched.\nWe should be especially glad to have Mr. Quinn's account of\nthat incident, mentioning whether he like yourself was wearing\nsocks, and, if so, whether he noticed any sign of scorching on\nthe sock afterwards.\nDo you remember the exact date of your experience ?\nH. BE G. Salter.\nIn reply to this letter Mr. Stowell wrote to Mrs. Salter as\nfollows :\nThe Imperial Bank op India,\nBombay, 22n(Z February, 1928.\nI have received your letter of 28th January regarding my fire-\nwalking experience of which I had given an account when writing\nhome. I am not in touch with Mr. Quinn at present, but have\nsent him a copy of your letter and you will no doubt hear from\nhim. Regarding the question you raise about the fire-trench.\n\fJune, 1928 The Fire Walk 281\nevidently I did not give a sufficiently clear account, as I meant\nto convey that I had walked along the length of the trench, not\nacross its width. As the trench was only 3^ feet wide and\n6 inches deep, it would of course have been possible to stride\nacross without touching the fire, but to walk along its length\ninvolved stepping on the embers three or four times, as the\ntrench was about 12 feet long. I myself went over twice, the\nsecond time when rushes had been strewn on the embers and\nflames about 2 feet high were caused. I walked quite slowly\nbut did not stand still at all, which I had not sufficient faith to\ndo!\nI found that after stepping ofi the fire-trench pieces of burning\ncinders were adhering to my socks, and a small hole was burnt in\none place before I could shake them ofi.\nMr. Quinn also walked over in socks, but had only gone about\nhalf way I believe when he jumped off hastily. Apparently too\nmany people had tried to go at one time, as the fakir's \" power\n\"\nlasted, I suppose, for less than a minute on each occasion. Mr.\nQuinn afterwards showed me the blisters he suffered from, but I\nthink no holes were burnt in his socks, which was very surprising.^\nI regret I cannot remember the date of this occurrence, nor\nhave I been able to find out. There were very few Europeans\npresent, as the performance took place at short notice and was not\nadvertised. V. E. Stowell.\nMrs. Salter has also received a letter from Mr. H. C. Quinn,\nTraffic Manager, Bombay Electric Supply and Tramways Co.,\nLtd., as follows :\n2nd March, 1928.\nYour letter of 28th January addressed to Mr. V. E. Stowell\nhas been handed on to me. I have pleasure in giving you a\nshort account of my experience of walking through the fire :\nThe trench was 12 feet by 4 feet. On the first occasion,\n22nd November last, when I walked through I went without my\nshoes, in socks only. We were told at the start to walk slowly,\nwhich we did. There was not the least mark of any scorching\non my socks, nor did I feel any discomfort. I may state that the\nfire was a fierce one, the embers being red hot, and the flames as\nI walked through curled round my body well above the knees.\n1 See Mr. Quinn's letter below.\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1928\nI walked across again the same evening, being the last of the\nparty that went over. As I got 3 parts across Mr. Syed Husein\nAtashi suddenly lost his power and falling down called out \" Stop,\nStop.\" I immediately felt a burning sensation through the feet\nand jumped off the fire to the side, when I found that both my\nfeet had been blistered and my socks scorched. On December\n19th I went again with my wife and a party, who all walked\nacross without shoes. None of the party were in any way burnt,\nneither were their socks or stockings marked. On this occasion\nthe crowd was very dense, and one was not able to walk across\nin comfort as on the previous occasion.\nI enclose copy of a letter on the subject, which Mr. P. D.\nMahaluxmivala, who was previously a member of your Society,\nI believe in 1921, addressed to one of the vernacular papers in\nBombay, which may be of interest to you.\nShould you publish these experiences I shall be obliged if you\nwill kindly send me a couple of copies of the publication.\nH. C. QuiNN.\nWith Mr. Quinn's letter was enclosed the following statement\nfrom Mr. P. D. Mahaluxmivala, J. P., Secretary, Bombay,\nElectrical Supply and Tramways Co., Ltd.\n29<\/; February, 1928.\nWalking through Fire.\nI was present on three occasions when, by virtue of the power\nover fire possessed by Syed Husein Atashi, many persons were\nable to walk uninjured through glowing embers and through\nflames.\nIn each instance a large number of spectators, including well-\nknown British and Indian ladies and gentlemen, witnessed the\nspectacle.\nThe Acting Police Commissioner, Mr. Healy, presided on the\nfirst occasion, which took place on the 17th of November, 1927.\nA trench 12 feet long by 4 feet wide and 1 foot deep had been\nfilled with glowing embers of about half a ton of burning firewood.\nImmediately on the arrival of the Acting Police Commissioner,\nSyed Husein Atashi, calling aloud repeatedly the word \" gulzar,\"\ninvited those present to walk through the trench without fear.\nTwo Mahomedans, apparently servants of his, then entered the\ntrench. \u2022\n\fJune, 1928 The Fire Walk 283\nTaking courage from this example several people, among whom\nwere a few Parsi ladies, followed bare footed from one end of\nthe trench to the other.\nNo one complained of hurt.\nI also took off my shoes and walked in my socks through the\nglowing embers, feeling only the sensation of treading on a slightly\nwarm rough surface.\nSyed Husein Atashi then had pieces of matting thrown on to\nthe embers, and, when these were burning, again asked any one\nwho desired to pass through the flames. Several spectators did\nthis without injury.\nLastly, pieces of matting were saturated with paraffin and\nflung into the trench. Again people walked unharmed through\nthe flames that literally reached their knees.\nA little Mahomedan girl about eight, and her brother about\nten years of age, both passed through the fire. The loin cloth\nof a young Hindu, who inadvertently placed his foot outside the\nlimits of the trench, caught fire, but his skin was not even scorched.\nA friend of mine, a doctor, who noticed the incident, assured me that,\nin the ordinary course of events, the youth would have been burned\nseriously enough to necessitate his immediate removal to the hospital.\nAt certain moments during the proceedings Syed Husein Atashi\nsank exhausted to the ground in a fainting condition, but re-\ncovered after his servants had administered hot tea to him.\nOn the second occasion, on the 22nd of November, Sir Dinshaw\nPetit, with a party of relations and friends, was among the\nnumerous onlookers. British and Indian ladies and many other\npeople walked through the fire.\nDuring the third occasion, on the 10th of December, when the\nCommissioner of Police, Mr. Kelly, was present, the rush of\nspectators to tread upon the glowing embers resulted in the feet\nof perhaps half a dozen persons being more or less blistered. A\nvery large number, upwards of one hundred, passed through the\ntrench, however, without mishap.\nSyed Husein Atashi, I was informed, is a native of Burmah.\nHe is a tall thin old man about eighty-seven years of age. He\nwas clad in a bright yellow robe reaching to his ankles.\nIn his hand he bore a flag, on which was inscribed a verse\nfrom the Koran, that he waved over the fire at intervals before\ninviting the spectators to walk through it.\n\f284 Journal 0\/ Society for Psychical Research June, 1928\nHe claims that one of his ancestors, hailing from Medina, who\nhad settled in Mandalay some four hundred and fifty years ago,\npossessed this power over fire. The gift, he avers, has been trans-\nmitted to the descendants of this ancestor from father or mother\nto son, and from mouth to mouth.\nOf the many testimonials that he holds, both from Englishmen\nand Indians of high standing, the following three are typical :\n1. From the British Resident of Gwalior State :\n\" Syed Hussein Atashi has given us an exhibition of his\nfire-walking performance. We were all much impressed by\nseeing immunity from injury which he and others enjoyed in\nwalking over a long trench of live coals.\" The Residency,\nGwalior, 2?,rd April, 1907.\n2. From the Divan (Minister) of the Junagadh State :\n\" I have seen the fire- walking performance of the bearer\nSyed Husain Atashi of Burma on two occasions\u2014one when\nHis Excellency Sir George Clarke was here and once with\nHis Highness the Navab Saheb. It is difficult to under-\nstand how the Syed manages to make so many men, appar-\nently not of his party, walk over burning charcoal.\" Juna-\ngadh, bth March, 1910.\n3. From the Private Secretary to Sir George Clarke (Lord\nSydenham) the then Governor of Bombay :\n\" In reply to his letter of the 12th inst. Saiyed Husain\nAtashi is informed that His Excellency and Stafi saw while\nat Junagadh his performance of walking bare-foot on live\ncoals and of enabling others to do so. It is a curious and\ninteresting spectacle and [it] seems difficult to find an explanation\nto it.\" \\Uh February, 1910.\nP. D. Mahaluxmivala.\nNOTES ON EECENT CASES.\nDuring the last few months the Society has been able to\ninvestigate an unusually large number of cases of alleged\nhaunted houses. In none of these cases was evidence obtain-\nable of anything of a supernormal nature taking place, and\nonly in the Battersea and Streatham cases did any of the\nalleged supernormal phenomena occur while the Society's\n\fJune, 1928 Notes on Recent Cases 285\nrepresentatives were on the premises. All that could be done\ntherefore was to obtain detailed accounts of what was alleged\nto have taken place. It is not possible to give any definite\nproof of their causation. The houses concerned were as\nfollows :\n1. Threapwood, Cheshire. An old farmhouse. lu this case\nthe phenomena reported consisted of rappings on an interior\nwall, hissing noises heard at night, an apparition coming down\nthe stairs, (this was not recognised, it was simply described as\na white figure), small objects were said to have been moved\nfrom one place to another when no one was near them and\nmarks, which the occupants took to be bloodstains, appeared on\nfurniture and woodwork in various rooms. The investigators\nspent two nights in the house, but nothing of a supernormal\nnature occurred while they were there. On one occasion they\nthought they heard the alleged \" hissing noise,\" but it was\ndiscovered to be the laboured breathing of a cat which was\nsuffering from asthma. Whether this was the \" hissing noise ''\nheard\nby the occupants it is impossible to say, but it might have been.\n2. Fulham, London. A room in a lodging house. The tenant\nof this room, a Frenchwoman, stated that for some months past\nshe had seen an apparition nearly every night. It was in the\nform of a male figure entirely black and carrying a glowiug\npitchfork. She said that it came through the closed door, stood\nover her bed for a few minutes and then seemed to vanish\nthrough the floor. She stated also that black smudges appeared\non her face from time to time when she was alone in the room\nand that sometimes after she had gone to bed and turned out\nthe light she saw curious writing on the ceiling and strange\ncrescent-shaped lights on the walls. Two visits were paid to\nthe house by different investigators, but nothing unusual took\nplace while they were present. There was no opportunity of\nfurther observation of this case as the occupant returned to France\nvery shortly after the second visit.\n3. Battersea, London. House in Eland Road. In this case\nthe phenomena alleged to have occurred consisted in the projection\nof missiles from outside the house in the form of stones, coal,\nsoda, etc., which broke some of the glass in the back doors and\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1928\nwindows. Inside the house furniture was said to have been\nthrown over and damaged and various small objects levitated\nfrom one place to another. Showers of coal and soda were\nsaid to have fallen in various parts of the house. By means of\ncareful and continuous observation extending over many days\nand nights a number of the alleged supernormal phenomena\ninside the house were witnessed by the investigators, and it\nbecame possible to say that all these were brought about by\nnormal means although the agent responsible could not possibly\nhave carried out all the previous phenomena of which we have\nonly hearsay evidence. It is unfortunate that the full details\nof the case involve confidential material which cannot well be\npublished, but it is probable that the disturbances were caused\nby several different persons acting independently with different\nmotives, a fact which rendered the case exceedingly difficult to\ninvestigate though of great interest to the psychological student.\n4. Lifton, Devon. This case was reported shortly after the\nBattersea case, but the disturbances did not continue long enough\nfor investigation. It was apparently of a similar type to the\nlatter, and the Society was able to obtain a trustworthy account\nfrom a local source.\n5. Wissenden, Kent. The disturbances here also occurred soon\nafter those at Battersea and Lifton, both of which had been given\ngreat prominence in the daily press, and there is little doubt\nthat they were due to the suggestion so conveyed. Although no\nphenomena occurred during the visit of the Society's representa-\ntives, they were able to obtain evidence relating to the disturbances\nand to form an opinion as to their causation.\n6. Netting Hill Gate, London. In this case one of the occu-\npants, a young man of about twenty-five years of age, stated that\non two occasions he saw a grey form going into a small room\nin the basement of the house. He did not recognise it nor\ncould he say whether it was male or female ; he states that\nonly the head and shoulders '\nwere visible. Other phenomena\nsaid to have taken place in this house consisted of whistling and\nsinging in an empty room and footsteps on the stairs which\ncould not be accounted for, also a door that was bolted over\nnight was several times found open in the morning. Six visits\n\fJune, 1928 Notes on Recent Cases 287\nwere paid to this house, but nothing unusual occurred at any\ntime in the presence of the investigator, and for some weeks no\nfurther disturbances have been reported.\n7. Adelphi Theatre. Disturbances in a dressing room. In this\ncase the alleged phenomena consisted in raps on the door, furni-\nture and underneath a couch in a room which was supposed to\nhave been occupied by William Terriss, who was murdered outside\nthe theatre some years ago. These raps always occurred between\nthe hours of 6 and 7.30 on matinee days while the occupant of\nthe room was resting for the evening performance. Three visits\nwere paid to the theatre, but nothing of a supernormal nature\nhappened while the investigator was present, and no further\ndisturbances have been reported during the last month.\n8. Streatham, London. Private house. In this case the alleged\nphenomena consisted of raps of an unknown origin which took\nplace in a certain room at night, usually after 11 o'clock. They\nwere heard by all the members of the family and purported to\nconvey messages from a deceased friend. Although several visits\nwere paid to the house and on one occasion the raps were heard\nby the investigator, nothing of an evidential nature was obtained.\nThe Society is keeping in touch with this case with a view to\nfurther investigation should the disturbances continue.\nKEVIEWS.\nI. Charles Nordmann, L'Au-Dela. Face au probleme de Vimmor-\ntalite. Librairie Hachette, Paris. 256 pages.\nM. Charles Nordmann is a well-known astronomer of the Paris\nObservatory, and the book in six chapters (with introduction and\nepilogue) is worthy of the very distinguished author and savant\nwhose name often appears in the columns of the Matin and in\nthe pages of that venerable fortnightly the Revue des deux Mondes.\nTo the psychical researcher the title of the present book is,\nhowever, somewhat misleading. The Beyond of which M. Nord-\nmann speaks is the Beyond of space and time, the solar system\nand its\n\"'\nexquisite miniature \" the atom, the Milky Way and the\nNebulae, the Eternal and the Infinite. Of human survival the\nauthor speaks very little, though admitting that \" among so many\nproblems the problem of survival is the one that especially\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1928\nimpassions most men \"\n(p. 253). To this problem by the way-\nhe gives no definite answer.\nTwo chapters of the book deal, however, with Psychical Research :\nthe first (\" Spiritism and Metapsychics \") and the second (\" The\nMystery of the Ectoplasma \"). The author strives to be impartial,\nand if he demolishes the evidence for the \" ectoplasma \" supposed\nby some to have been afforded by Einer Neilsen, Miss Goligher,\n\" Eva Carriere,\" Kluski and other mediums, few of us will be\ndisposed to question his negative conclusions. It may be men-\ntioned by the way that the last chapter at least is a little out\nof date (the book itself bears none !) : thus the name of Dr.\nGeley is repeatedly mentioned, but nothing is said as to his\ntragic death. It is not quite clear by the way why out of the\nwhole domain of Psychical Research the \" ectoplasma \" should\nhave been specially singled out : surely a discussion of the con-\ntents of mediumistic messages from the standpoint of human sur-\nvival or even supernormal knowledge pure and simple would have\nbeen more appropriate to a work dealing with the \" Au-dela.\"\nM. Charles Nordmann's knowledge of \" metapsychics \" appears to\nbe certainly limited by the way, otherwise he would hardly have\nwritten :\n\" To speak of unconscious thought is to use therefore\nwords devoid of meaning \" (p. 271). \" To speak of unconscious\nthought is therefore to make a petitio principii \"\n(p. 272). Even\nsupposing he means here something different from what we mean\nby the subconscious self and subconscious thought, M. Nordmann\nwould probably have expressed himself differently if he had been\nmore familiar with our researches.\nOn the whole the two chapters in question might have been\nomitted without modifying in any degree the character and the\nvalue of the book.\nIn the chapters dealing with the universe and its astronomical\nabyss we are overwhelmed with facts and numbers almost calcu-\nlated sometimes to make us feel dizzy. I have no authority\nwhatever to express on these subjects any doubts nor indeed any\nopinions. I cannot abstain, however, from uttering a very modest\ndesideratum. Could not that admirable science, Astronomy,\ndirect the greatest part of its tremendous effort to unravel the\nmystery of the Universe somewhat nearer home ? It is no doubt\nintensely interesting to hear so much about thousands of milliards\nof kilometers and hundreds of thousands, nay, millions of years.\n\fJune, 1928 Reviews 289\nBut\u2014what about the infinitely less remote in space canals of\nMars ? If I mistake not, about half a century has now elapsed\nsince Professor Schiaparelli's discovery. How is it that astrono-\nmers are still wrangling about these canals ? And by \" wrangling\n\"\nI do not only mean disagreement as to their origin : whether\nnatural or artificial, but also as to their objective or quasi-\nsubjective character.\nWill it be too audacious on the part of a layman humbly to\nsuggest that Astronomy might do well to begin, provisionally at\nleast, if not quite at home like charity, at least in the relative\nneighbourhood of the Earth ? And when the Mars problem has\nbeen definitely settled, nemine contradicente, there will be time\nenough to fathom the abysses of the Infinite\u2014where control of\nthe observations and calculations made is by the way (let it be\nsaid between ourselves) in all likelihood much more difficult.\nCharacteristically enough the Mars riddle is not even alluded to\nby M. Charles Nordmann, who prefers either hovering in the\nbottomless abysses of the vault of heaven or diving into the\nmysteries of the world of atoms and electrons. And yet are there\nriddles of more stupendous interest than those relating to what\nthe late Camille Flammarion called the habitabilite of planets ?\nMysteries where the natural and the (so-called) supernatural\nseem to merge into each other ;\nmysteries where dream and\nreality may become 07ie, and compared to which even the question\nof human survival seems to me to dwindle into relative insig-\nnificance ? P.-P.-S.\nII. Dr. Richard Baerwald, Okkultismus iind Spiritis7nus und\nihre weltanschauliche Folgerungen. Deutsche Buchgemeinschaft,\nBerlin, 1926. 404 pages.\nThis book is very attractive. It is full of valuable criticisms,\nobservations and facts. There are nine chapters in all. The\nfirst is devoted to considerations and conceptions of a general\ncharacter ; the second to the subconscious self ; the third to\nmediumship ; the fourth to automatic writing, crystal-gazing,\ntable-tilting and rapping and the sideric pendulum ; the fifth to\ntelepathy, both spontaneous and experimental ; the sixth to hyper-\naesthesia and telepathy \" in disguise \" ; the seventh to prophecy ;\nand premonitions ; the eighth to physical phenomena ; the\nninth to spiritism and the problem of immortality.\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1928\nThe standpoints of the learned editor of the Zeitschrift fiir\nKritischen Okkultismus are well known. He rejects the physical\nphenomena altogether and clairvoyance so far as the latter is\nregarded as supernormal knowledge which cannot be explained\nas hyperaesthesia, hypermnesia and thought-transference. On the\nother hand he fully admits telepathy, envisaged by him as a\nphysical emanation ; he even gives it an extension for which\n\u2014\nDr. Baerwald will, I am sure, excuse my stating my opinion\nplainly\u2014there is no justification in our present knowledge. The\nsubconscious self again becomes under his hands quite an arsenal\nwhere he finds plenty of resources for explaining apparently\nsupernormal occurrences in a '\nnatural '\nway (giving the word\n'\nnatural '\na '\npull ' which permits telepathy to fit into it). Hyper-\naesthesia again is given an extension which may well be called\ntremendous. No saying is truer than the French dictum : les\nextremes se touchent. The hypercritical Dr. Baerwald here again\nmakes admissions and postulates hypotheses for which there is\nno basis in fact, therefore his hypercriticism comes into close\ncontact with lack of criticism. To note this is not to disparage\na very valuable and fascinating work.\nOn pages 193-207 the author attempts to demolish the evidence\nfor thought-transference at close distances. Some of his remarks\nare certainly telling, and I for my part am willing to admit their\nhien-fonde. But, seeing that he believes in hypnosis and tele-\npathy at great distances, it is not quite clear to me why he\ninsists so much on unconscious whispering as an explanation of\nthe Nahversuche. He goes even to the extent of not excluding\nthis explanation in the case of the late Professor BekhterefE's\ndogs (p. 203 footnote).\nI do not think, generally speaking, that we have already reached\na stage in which in discussing such experiments as those with\nOssowiecki, with Dr. Chowrin's Russian clairvoyante, etc., we\nshould be justified in championing one supernormal explanation\nagainst another, e.g., thought-transference against clairvoyance.\nI am considerably impressed by some of the evidence, but I still\nthink we want more of it ; and meanwhile the alternative should\nnot be between clairvoyance and telepathy but between clair-\nvoyance or telepathy on the one hand and prosaic trickery (to use\nno uglier term) on the other. This is a circumstance which Dr.\nBaerwald seems to me somewhat to neglect.\n\fJune, 1928 Reviews 291\nI miss in his\u2014I repeat, most valuable\u2014work a chapter on\nPhantasms of the Dead. Such cases are very rare\u2014I speak, of\ncourse, of evidential ones only\u2014but they do exist, and Professor\nRichet has done them the honour of calling them somewhere\ntroublants. Dr. Baerwald's omission is the less comprehensible as\nhis theory of extended telepathy would have surely enabled him to\ndispose of such cases very easily, if not always quite satisfactorily.\nIn Chapter VII. the pages where the author explains away some\nprophecies of Nostradamus soi-disant bearing on the French\nRevolution will be read with peculiar interest (pp. 321-327).\nThe demonstration (by Prof. Richard Henning) leaves nothing to\nbe desired. I am far more sceptical with regard to the explana-\ntion by telepathy of such cases of apparent premonition as Mrs.\nSchweizer's dream of the impending death of her son (pp. 338-\n339). And I may add that it is very fortunate that for such\naction of telepathy as Dr. Baerwald here supposes there is no\nevidence whatsoever. Yes, this is indeed fortunate. For life\nis very complicated already. If, in addition to our usual troubles,\nwe are henceforward compelled carefully to control and suppress\nthe anxiety we may feel with regard to those dear to us, even\nwhen hundreds of miles away, lest this anxiety may by dint of\nsome telepathic impact d rebours start the very calamity we are\napprehending !\n\u2014our life may well become well nigh unbearable.\nI think chance-coincidence in Mrs. Schweizer's case (as in many\nothers) a much more plausible explanation than is usually sup-\nposed, and I also think that, generally speaking, Dr. Baerwald\nmight with advantage have availed himself of this hypothesis\nfar more than he has.\nThe last chapter contains a fine \" parable (pp. 385 sqq.). Dr.\nBaerwald will not admit that there is life after death. Like him\nI see nothing very frightful in total annihilation, and also think\nthe orthodox Christian conception in this respect far more terrible.^\n1 Sir 0. Lodge (Proceedings, Vol. XXXIV., p. 117) says that in the\nMiddle Ages the fear of post mortem torment \" must have given so much\npain that really those beliefs were hardly superior to the more ancient\nbeliefs of the Egyptians.\" It is not quite clear why he speaks in the past\ntense. Surely Sir Oliver knows that hundreds of millions of Christians\n(both Roman Catholics and Greek-Orthodox) still hold to the present day\nthe same conception which, by the way, seems to them\u2014and in my opinion\nrightly enough\u2014based on some of the most explicit and most unequivocal\nstatements of the very Founder of Christianity.\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research june, 1928\nBut even supposing annihilation to be true (as to which I am not\ncompletely certain) it may well be doubted whether the present\nday masses are ripe for such a\u2014supposed\n\u2014\" truth.\" In the\npresent phase of mankind can morality dispense with the sanction\nof a threat, be it transcendental ? I have on this subject some\ndoubts.

Malcolm Bird on \" Some Theoretical Aspects of\nPsychical Research,\" which is the text of a lecture given by\nMr. Bird at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research last\nautumn (also printed in the Brit. Jour, for Psych. Research.\nMonsieur Rene Sudre has an article on Professor Richet's book\n\" The Sixth Sense,\" in which he criticises this title on the ground\nthat the assumption of anything which can be called a sixth\nsense does not really help to explain psychical phenomena. M.\nSudre refers in particular to telepathy of the active and selective\ntype as being especially difficult to explain on any physiological\nbasis.\nThe Number contains a further instalment of Dr. Christian\nWinther's Report on Mrs. Anna Rasmussen.\nMr. Price contributes an interesting summary of the accounts\ngiven to him by various witnesses of events alleged to have\ntaken place at the \" haimted \" house in Battersea. The pheno-\nmena which he was able to observe on his own three visits to the\nhouse are also described with care, and seem to have differed\nsomewhat from anything that took place on other occasions. They\nconsisted chiefly in the discovery of small portable objects in\nplaces occupied a short time previously, and it is interesting\nto compare these phenomena with the rather similar ones which\noccurred during the visit of Eleonore Zugun to Mr. Price's\nLaboratory.\nThe British Journal of Psychical Research, Vol. i. No. 11 (Jan.-\nFeb. 1928) contains an article by Mr. J. Malcolm Bird on \" Some\nTheoretical Aspects of Psychical Research,\" in which the author\ndiscusses the possible bearing upon psychical phenomena of modern\n\fJune, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 295\ntheories of ether, hyperdimensionality, and Einstein's theory of\nrelativity.\nDr. R. J. Tillyard has an interesting article on \" The Normal\nProduction of Psychic Gloves,\" in which he describes how a wax\nglove similar to a psychic glove produced in his presence at a\nsitting with Margery on May 1st, 1926, was produced by applying\na tourniquet to the subject's arm, so that the hand and wrist\nwere swollen and engorged with blood when dipped into the hot\nwax ; after the glove had been formed, the tourniquet was removed,\nand with the consequent reduction of the hand and wrist to their\nnormal size the removal of the wax glove was easily effected. It\nis worth noting that this method was suggested to Dr. Jameson,\nof Nelson, N.Z., by whom it was carried out, by the turgid appear-\nance of a thumb-cast taken from the psychic glove obtained at\nthe sitting with Margery. Dr. Tillyard discusses the bearing of\nthis discovery on the Margery phenomena, and concludes that \" no\ncharge of fraud can be brought against any of the sitters at the\nseance of May 1st, 1926, but that the new knowledge here dis-\nclosed makes the whole performance of \" Walter \" at this seance\nof little evidential value in the establishment of the claim that\nparaffin-wax gloves can be formed only by supernormal means.\"\nThe British Journal of Psychical Research.

The central point of interest is the apparent knowledge\nof the Chinese language and of Chinese classical literature shown\nby the \" direct voice \" speaking at the sittings.\nThere is a statement by Mrs. McConnel concerning communica-\ntions received from her son David and a friend Rosalind, which\nMrs. McConnel believes to be connected with the \" White Case\n\"\n(reported in \" The Bridge \").\nMrs. Leaning has an article on \" Calculating Boys \" with special\nreference to the article on Louis Fleury by Dr. Osty in the\nRevue Metapsychique, Nov.-Dec. 1927.

Of these the most note-\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1928\nworthy is this medium's alleged supernormal flight (described in\nthe January number) from Trebian to St. Nicolai and back,\ntwelve kilometres as the crow flies, coinciding with Frau Silbert's\ndisappearance or absence of eighty minutes' duration. Herr\nMacourek's account is candid enough to permit the critical reader\nto detect in it traces of collusion, one other person besides the\nmedium, and perhaps two, being possibly implicated. The incident\ndoes not contribute favourably to the medium's reputation, and\nin my opinion points in the direction of deliberate and elaborate\npreparation beforehand of the whole performance. The alleged\nflight itself reminds us of similar claims advanced by Mrs. Guppy-\nVolckman in London in the seventies.\nProf. August Messer of Giessen has an interesting paper (un-\nfinished yet) on the \" Riddle of Konnersreuth.\" A long list of\npapers on this extraordinary case is given, and should be of value\nto the student. Of much interest is the description by Dr. von\nAretin of the stigmatica's ecstasies and visions of the Passion\nreproduced on pp. 74-76 (March number). A somewhat difierent\nimpression is, I think, produced on the reader by another quota-\ntion where Dr. Gerlich (id. p. 79), who repeatedly observed\nT. N. in September and October last, describes the mysterious\ndisappearance of a Host placed on the seeress's tongue by the\npriest who was giving her the Blessed Sacrament. To Prof.\nMesser it suggests telekinesis or dematerialisation {ibid.) ; I think the\nrepetition of such incidents is not desirable in the interests of\nthe voyante's reputation or prestige.\nA case of a supposed premonitory dream by Prof. Dr. C. is\ngiven and commented upon by Prof. Dr. Schroder on behalf of\nthe new Institut fur Metapsychikalische Forschung of Berlin-\nLichterfelde-Ost. I am not certain the amount of coincidence\nis sufficiently striking to justify us in looking for an explanation\nbeyond chance.\nThe same author concludes his account of the phenomena of\nFrau Rudloff. The February instalment begins by further \" pro-\ntocols,\" most of them at any rate quite inconclusive. I do not\nwish, however, to minimise the fact that there are a few\u2014\na\nvery few\u2014incidents in which explanation by trickery is at first\nsight more difficult. A report by Dr. Krallinger is then printed,\nwho investigated Frau Rudloii's \" metagenetic \" drawings on\nmirrors, and says they are identical, as to the substance, to human\n\fJune, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 297\nblood submitted when still in semi-liquid (feucht) state to high\ntemperature. Still it has not been possible to reproduce them\nartificially in all their forms and parts. The origin of the \" Meta-\naustriche \" in human blood submitted to the action of heat or\nof similar agents seems to Dr. Krallinger in the highest degree\nprobable. Whether this \" heat \" has an origin external to the\nsubstance or internal is wrapped in total darkness. The micro-\nscopic study of the \" Meta-austriche \" has revealed many interest-\ning facts which cannot however be given in detail. On the whole\nDr. Krallinger's report (the final sentences suggest that he is a\nbeliever in materialisation) is rather favourable to the authenticity\nof the '\"\nmirror-drawings.\" This fact is interesting and should be\nnoted ; it can hardly outweigh however the utterly suspicious\nappearance of the \" drawings,\" nor the circumstance that, judging\nby the \" Protocols,\" the way in which they come into being is\ncompletely inconclusive evidentially in nineteen cases out of twenty,\nunless we rely on the testimony of all the three Rudloffs (Herr,\nFrau and Fraulein).\nDr. Schroder is so convinced of the genuineness of the Rudlofl\nspiegelphdnomenik that by way of a challenge he ofiers 1,000\nmarks (to be raised under certain circumstances to 5,000) to any\none who will obtain the same Meta-austriche whatever the con-\nditions. Both the February and March numbers of the review\nare abundantly and excellently illustrated.\nDr. E. Mattiesen has the beginning of a paper on \" the White\nCase\" as described in Miss Nea Walker's The Bridge: A case for\nsurvival.\nZeitschrift fiir Psychische Forschung, April, 1928. Dr. Mattiesen\ncontinues his examination of the \" White Case \" (we shall return\nto it when finished). Dr. F. Harms has a paper on psycho-\nmetric experiments with Frau Lotte Plaat, daughter of Consul M. in\nOldenburg. The author's remarks show him to be by no means\ndevoid of some critical acumen, but the experiments narrated\nappear to me to be absolutely worthless so far as the possession\nby Frau Plaat of some \" supernormal \" power is concerned.\nProfessor Dr. August Messer discusses again Konnersreuth.\nVarious interesting incidents are mentioned, among them one\nnarrated by Dr. Gerlich, where Theresa Neumann seems to have\nmanifested clairvoyance so far as the contents of a silver crucifix\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1928\n(containing relics) were concerned. This clairvoyance may, how-\never, be explained by thought-transference from a Carmelite monk\nwho had brought the crucifix and presumably knew its contents.\nKonnersreuth again forms the subject of a short paper by Dr.\nEduard Aigner. In a footnote the editor of the Zeitschrift says with\nreference to statements which appeared in two Konnersreuth papers\nthat the Friday ecstacies and bleedings ceased towards the end\nof 1927 and that T.

These statements\nare in contradiction with information derived from other sources.\nProfessor Max Selling discusses \" Action at a Distance.\" Goethe\nappears to have believed in such Fernwirken between inaniinate\nobjects !

May I be\npermitted to utter a respectful caveat against dreams being used as\nevidence for supernormal perception, at least as a general rule ?\nZeitschrift filr Parapsychologie, April, 1928.

He rightly insists on the importance of some cases\u2014or\ncategories of cases\u2014where Zufall is only an apparent explanation\nand where the true explanation is of a different nature. But in\nmy ojDinion this is not the real question at issue. Will chance\ncoincidence explain some\u2014or many\u2014of the incidents which Psychi-\ncal Researchers are wont to put down to supernormal factors\n(in medium's utterances for instance) ?

Prof. Verweyen appears to have been thoroughly\nsatisfied with the results of her performances (of a clairvoyant\n\"\ncharacter) in a public hall, in the presence of an impresario,\"\nand considers quite natural her subsequent failure when tested\nat a private sitting.\nDr. Rudolf Tischner has a valuable- article, as usual, on Mesmer's\nimportance for \" metapsychics \" ; and a short paper by Dr. Aigner\nvery opportunely reminds us\u2014which some are apt to forget\u2014that\nthe problem of the divining rod has by no means been definitively\nsolved in the affirmative sense. He reproduces Prof. Marbe's\n(of Wiirzburg) suggestions that would-be professional dowsers\nshould be at first properly tested by competent official organs, and\nquotes sentences of this scientist which seem to imply a very\nsceptical attitude ; the latter is the more impressive as the Pro-\nfessor's impartiality seems particularly beyond doubt.\nThe Countess Wassilko-Serecki contributes the account of a\nsitting with her protegee Eleonore Zugun in Vienna on 16th May,\n1927. Several university professors and other savants were\npresent, among them Prof. Hans Thirring. The seance may be\ndescribed\u2014loosely speaking\u2014as rather a good one. The Countess\nwas absent part of the time, many of the (usual) phenomena \"\noccurring while she was away.\nStudienrat R.

The experiments with\nLudwig Kahn are discussed at\u2014relative\u2014length. To the physical\nphenomena and materialisations a little more than a page is\ndevoted. Insistence is laid on the Naples experiments with\nEusapia in 1908 by a \" committee of conjurers sent by the\nEnglish S.P.R.\" It is not the first time I have seen in German\npublications Messrs.

He begins by a work published by Porta\nin Naples in 1567 and by Reginald Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft\n(London, 1587), ending with some contemporary performances.\nOf peculiar interest is the case of the Hungarian couple K.\nexposed a few years ago by Drs.

Dr. Baerwald's\nposition is well known :\n\" Hellsehen \" does not exist, and apparent\nclairvoyance is to be explained by telepathy and acuity of sense-\nperception (both, he will permit me to point out, strained almost\nto breaking point). Before adopting either hypothesis I should\nlike to be more certain than, I confess, I am of the genuineness\nof the facts themselves.\nDr. Wendler (Erlangen) discusses the results obtained by an\nelectrician, E. K. Miiller, of Zurich, who has been investigating\nsupposed \" emanations \" from the human body. These investiga-\ntions have impressed him rather favourably, and he is willing to\nadmit such an \" emanation \" at least as a working hypothesis\n(pp. 73-77).\nDr. Hans Rosenbusch (who claims, as is known, to have ex-\nposed in Munich both Bleonore Zugun and the Countess Wassilko)\nvigorously criticises the Price report on the Roumanian peasant\ngirl (Proceedings of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research,\nVol. I., January 1927, Part I.) and the Zimmer-Korber-Bruck-\nKroner-Doblin report printed in the May number (1927) of Zeit-\nschrift fur Parapsychologie.\n\" Spirit-materialisations experimentally tested \" is the singularly\ninappropriate title of a paper by Prof. Dr. Anton Seitz of Munich.\nThe writer speaks in it chiefly of apparitions in human form and\nvery little of \" materialisation.\" He maintains that the animistic\nhypothesis combined with \" intuitional vision \" and \" radioidal\n\"\ncapacities is sufficient to explain \" all the facts.\" I do not\nknow . . . nor, strictly speaking, does Geheim-Regierungsrat Dr.\nSeitz.

Information Obtained at a Trance-Sitting on\nMatters Unknown to the Sitter.\nWe have received from Mr. A. G. Hoseason, who has been for\nmany years a Member of the Society, the following case in\nwhich veridical information was given to him at a sitting w^ith\nMrs. Leonard concerning matters of which he had no normal\nknowledge at the time. The sitting took place on February\n16, 1928, the purporting communicator being Mr. Hoseason's\nwife. The first report of the incident was contained in a letter\nfrom Mr. Hoseason to the Secretary, Miss Newton, as follows :\nAfHl 10, 1928.\n... I enclose you a resume of a test given me months ago by\nmy wife. I get them regularly, but this one might interest you.\nI might mention I have sat almost monthly with one of the best\nmediums in the world for now over eleven years (and many others\nin the meantime, say for the first six years since 1917), and have\nof course scores of notes and many wonderful private home\nrecords.\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1928\nThe letters I enclose are from my cousin Lizzie, who lives iu\nLame, North of Ireland, and my sittings are always in London. . .\nA. Gr. HOSEASON.\nWith this letter was enclosed the following statement\n:\nAfril 10, 1928.\nAt sitting on February 16, 1928, I asked my wife to give me\nsomething evidential, and the message was (as put in my notes) r\n\" Lizzie wants more towels\u2014also water is coming into room near\na bed.\"\nI immediately wrote off to Ireland, and I enclose you her letter\nto me. Of course I knew nothing of these things at all. I con-\nsider it a wonderful test. I have since had another one, which\nwas, \" Lizzie has broken an old blue plate,\" not in two, but in\nmany pieces. I wrote at once, received reply, \" Yes, almost uu-\nmendable.\" Simple things, but all the more convincing, at least\nto me.\nThese are merely tests asked for. The record of sittings I do\nnot mention, as it is all home life, and no interest to any one.\nPlease note my cousin lives 400 miles from London. A. Gr. H.\nWith this was also enclosed a letter to Mr. Hoseason from\nhis cousin in Larne, as follows :\nFebruary 20th, 1928.\nYour letter to hand on Saturday. What came through to you\nis truly marvellous, showing to us again how really and truly\nclose to us my dearly beloved cousin Lizzie is. Not an hour\nbefore your letter came in at midday on Saturday I had said to\nKathleen to bring a few towels from Hamilton's, where there is a\nsale going on. In our bedroom the paper round the top of the\nbay and down the side is quite wet. We have been waiting for\nthe McI. family . . . bringing home their long ladders to find out\nthe cause of the damp coming through. . . .\nCousin Lizzie.\nIn reply to the above communications the Hon. Secretary,\nMr. W. H. Salter, wrote to Mr. Hoseason on April 30th, put-\nting the following questions :\nWe should be very glad to know the name of the medium to\nwhom you refer, on the understanding that this will not be printed\n\fJuly, 1928 Gase 305\nwithout your previous consent. Would you also kindly say\nwhether you had been in Larne recently, and whether before the\nsitting in question you had any knowledge of the damp coming\nthrough your cousin's house ?\nAt previous sittings with the same medium had there been any\nreferences to your cousin Lizzie and her affairs, and have you at\nany time spoken to this medium, when out of trance, about your\ncousin Lizzie ? . . . W. H. Salter.\nIn reply to this letter IVIr. Hoseason wrote as follows :\nMay 3, 1928.\nIn reply to yours of April 30th :\n1. The name of the medium I have sat with for many years is\nMrs. Osborne Leonard. ...\n2. I have not been in Larne for 7 or 8 years.\n3. As I explained to you, in my letter, I had no knowledge of\nany damp coming through my cousin's house ; if I had, I should\nnot have sent it to you.\n4. In all sittings with Mrs. Osborne Leonard, for the past 11\nyears, I have never discussed anything I have had through ;\nmy\nonly comment to her at any time is very occasionally I may\nsay\u2014I have had a good sitting to-day or a poor one, nothing more.\n5. I have no recollection at any time mentioning my cousin's\nname to her.\nFeda always comes through for about 40 minutes, and then my\nwife controls Mrs. Leonard for about 20 minutes. Our conversa-\ntions are always on home matters, relations, and friends.\nAt the sitting sent you I asked my wife to give me a \" test,\"\nand that was the test I sent to you. I have since that sitting\nasked twice for tests, and have had one from Ireland {re blue\nplate), which came exactly, and one for a friend in Birmingham\nasked for 3 months ago.\u2014True.\nAnything further [I shall be] pleased to give you. I might\nmention I always take rough notes at the sittings, all of which I\nhave kept the last 10 years. A. 6. Hoseason.\nMr. Hoseason has also sent us a photograph (taken, he tells\nus, in March 1928) of the room in his cousin's house at\nLarne, showing the damp on the wall.\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1928\nNOTE ON THE GUNTHER-GEFFERS CASE.\nA YEAR ago, on May 12th, 1927, Frau Giinther-Geffers of Konigsberg,.\nEast Prussia, a professional clairvoyante and Kriminaltelepath, was\nacquitted on the charge of fraud by the Insterburg tribunal\n{erweiterte Schoffengericht)\n.\nThe Stadtsanwalt having appealed against this sentence, the case\nhas been tried again, also at Insterburg, and ended again with an\nacquittal on May 12th.\nMuch evidence attesting the clairvoyante's alleged powers in\ndiscovering thefts, dead bodies, etc., was produced before the\ntribunal and apparently considerably imjjressed the judges. Where-\nupon at a certain stage of the proceedings the Stadtsanwalt offered\nto Avithdraw his appeal against the previous sentence. To this\nFrau Gimther-GefEers' counsel objected, insisting on a complete\nvindication of his client, and\u2014apparently\u2014also hoping that the\ntribunal would assert in its sentence the reality of the clairvoyante's\npowers. This the tribunal has not done, but Frau G.-G. and a\ndetective closely connected with her have been acquitted once\nmore.\nMany interesting incidents happened in the course of the triaL\nTwice a regular experiment was instituted with the object of\ntesting Frau G.-G.'s alleged supernormal faculties. In the first case\nshe appears to have attained a certain\u2014possibly a considerable\n\u2014\nmeasure of success, but according to our standards the conditions\nof the experiment can hardly be called evidentially cogent, since\non the most vital point some doubt seems to prevail. Thus Dr.\nAlbert Hellwig of Potsdam (who is, I ought perhaps to add, pro-\nfoundly inimical to professional clairvoyants) asserts in the Frank-\nfurter Zeitung of May 17th (2nd morning edition) that it seems by\nno means proved that Frau G.-G. did give the name \" von\nReibnitz \" (the victim of a theft not cleared up at the time), as\nhad been alleged in some newspapers. If doubt is permissible on\nso crucial a point, the conditions of the experiment may well have\nbeen somewhat inadequate.\nA second and apparently flawless experiment instituted by Prof.\nDessoir was negative as to its result. Frau G.-G. failed to\n\"read\" any of the words written on slips of paper which had\nbeen put into a securely closed box, and the word vampyr which\nwas spelt out by her did not correspond to the contents of any\n\fJuly, 19i'8 Case 307\nof the slips. These contents, it should be noted, were unknown to\nthose present. This result would seem at first sight to strengthen\nthe position of those who\u2014like Herr Albert Hofmann in the\nKolnische Zeitung of May 17th, morning edition\u2014see in Frau G.-G.'s\nalleged clairvoyance only thought-transference, which according to\nHeir Hofmann is so common in the trance state (?)\nThe experts commissioned by the tribunal who examined Frau\nGiinther-CTeffers' condition preferred to abstain from expressing an\nopinion as to the genuineness or otherwise of her trance.\nThe present note, it should be added, is avowedly of a pre-\nliminary nature. The undersigned may be permitted, however, to\nexpress his satisfaction as to the result of the Insterburg trial,\nwhether Frau Gr.-G. is an authentic clairvoyante or not. Such\ntrials seem to me a manifestation of that \" grandmotherly legis-\nlation which is not invariably an unmitigated boon and are\nlikely\u2014as in the present instance\u2014to have consequences altogether\ndifferent from those originally contemplated. The lesson should\nnot be lost. P.-P.-S.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fiir kritischen Okkiiltismus, III. Band, 2 Heft. This\nnumber is, we are informed, the last one of this Review, but the\nhope is held out to us of the foundation of a German Society on\nthe model of our S.P.R., thus affording the basis of a truly\nneutral publication.\nMeanwhile the number begins with new evidence re the Schneider\ncase. This evidence first comprises an account of an exposure\nof Willi's\u2014hitherto unknown\u2014at Braunau in 1920. The case is\ncertainly a bad one, since it shows elaborate preparation (it was\nascertained that Willi wore .socks with openings at the ends\nallowing the toes free play !). An account of an exposure of\nRiidi's then follows, not quite as bad perhaps, after which Count\nKlinckowstroem narrates in detail Dr. Prince's most valuable\nexperiences with the same medium.\nThe next paper is entitled \" The Bisson Catastrophe,\" which\ntitle is perhaps a little exaggerated. As yet (April) there has\nbeen no cataclysm, though certain new facts have come to light\nwhich show us the protectress of Marthe Beraud (\" Eva Carriere \"),\nas playing a part still more puzzling than before. A concentric\nattack is made on her by Father Norbert Briihl of Trier and Count\n\f.308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1928\nKlinckowstroem. (For a reply by Prof. Ricliet, see Zeitschrift fiir\nParapsychologie for May 1928, reviewed below, -p. 309.)\nThe present writer has a paper on his curriculum vitae as a\nPsychical Researcher from 1887 to 1923. Among the positive\nincidents narrated the melting away of a \" spirit-hand \" in the\nlate F. W. H. Myers's grasp at a sitting with Williams (as re-\nlated to me by Myers in 1892) seems to me to be by far the most\nnoteworthy.\nDr. Otto Groldmann has a paper on two Saxon clairvoyantes\nto whom the German authorities have repeatedly applied to clear\nup crimes. Dr. Goldmann denies that there is clairvoyance, but\nadmits thought-transference, which he says may be dangerous as\napt to confirm false suspicions against innocent people.\nDr. Carl Bruck, of Berlin, discusses an alleged case of premoni-\ntion connected with a journey to Greece. The incident is de-\nscribed at very great length, but I am not sure that the coinci-\ndence is not fortuitous. Prevision of the future is so extra-\nordinary that we are morally entitled to have more stringent\ncanons of evidence for premonition than for alleged telepathy.\nDr. Rosenbusch replies to Countess Wassilko's defence in\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie. Many will regret that the decisions\nof two Bavarian courts of law have not permitted this instructive\ndispute to come up before an audience far more numerous than the\nreaders of a few German periodicals. A great pity the matter has\nnot thus been cleared up, but the fault lies not with the Countess.\nA series of short notes follows, chiefly by Count Klinckowstroem.\nIn one of them the public performances of a certain Paul Diebel,\nwho pretended inter alia to reproduce Therese Neumann's stigma-\ntisation, are discussed. (He has since confessed to obtaining these\nresults by \/ia\/[\/\"-conjuring methods.) In another note the same\nauthor deals with the alleged mediumship (physical) of Karl\nKraus, who, under the name of Karl Weber, was the subject of a\npaper by Dr. v. Schrenck-Notzing at the Paris Congress.^ It\nappears that Kraus is going to publish a pamphlet describing\nhow he bamboozled the Munich investigators. Of course con-\nfession of deception, unless supported by positive and concrete\nevidence, is of little value.\n^\n^S.P.B. Journal, November 1927, p. 133.\n^ From information received later it appears doubtful whether the book will be\npublished. This is much to be regretted.\n\fJULT, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 309\nAn account of a premonitory apparition printed in a Vienna\npaper prompts the same author (Count Kl.) to comment very\nsensibly on the evidential worthlessness of such narratives. A\nGerman \" sister-society \" should, he says, follow in this respect\nthe example of the S.P.R. We heartily concur in this wish. In\nthe spontaneous sphere alone such a society could do plenty of\nuseful work, and save from oblivion many remarkable facts.\nIt is to be wished also that it will abstain from personal polemics\nwhich, it must be confessed, were at times a little too conspicuous\nin the defunct Zeitschrift.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, May, 1928.\nThe piece de resistance of this number is\u2014to me\u2014Prof. Richet's\nletter to Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing in answer to Count Klinckow-\nstroem's Bissou article in the last number of the Zeitschrift fiir\nKritischen Okkultismus. In this letter Prof. Richet maintains the\ngenuineness both of the first series of his experiments with Eva\nCarriere\u2014Marthe Beraud\u2014(obviously those at Algiers are meant),\nand of the later. He also was present, he says, at some of the\nseances arranged by Dr. von Schrenck and Mme. Bisson, and\nmaintains that he can testify to the accurate character of the\nexperiments.^\nA further instalment of Dr. Pagenstecher's work on his Mexican\nvoyante is given.\nIn a long and interesting paper Dr. v. Schrenck-Notzing dis-\ncusses the Augustenstrasse Poltergeist (Munich, beginning of 1927).\nThe maid Therese Winklhofer (the supposed medium) subsequently\nmade a complete confession and was imprisoned by the police for\nfourteen days (without trial). Dr. v. Schrenck, Dr. R. Tischner,\nand Herr Hildebrandt, a writer, being members of a Commission\nappointed by the Munich Society for Metapsychical Research to\ninvestigate this Spul; assert that in spite of the confession some\nof the phenomena (in particular some throwings of objects wit-\nnessed by three persons in the morning of January 15th, 1927)\nremain inexplicable by fraud.\nSome other Poltergeist phenomena occurring at Dillingen, in Saar,\nare briefly narrated by Herr Kulas.\nProfessor August Messer has a paper on the theoretical basis of\nknowledge in the domain of \" parapsychological \" and \" para-\nphysical \" phenomena.\n^ We hope to print further notes on this controversy in the autumn.\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1928\nIn \" Kleine Mitteilungen \" (Prof. Richet's letter appears in this\nsection) mention is made of the death of Prof. Haraldur Nielsson\nof Iceland and of Eleonore Ziigun's return to Rumania, where,\nwe are told, thanks to the care bestowed on her by Countess\nWassilko, she will have an \"excellent position\" in a Frisiersalon.\nStudienrat Lambert reviews Parts 102 and 103 of the S.P.R.\nProceedings. Speaking of the One crowded hour of glorious life\ncross-correspondence, he says he agrees with Mr. Hall that this\ncross-correspondence proves absolutely nothing as to survival and\nhardly anything for telepathy. Nor does he see anything more\nthan fortuitous coincidences in the \" Master Builder.\"' Studienrat\nLambert is equally sceptical as to the result of the experiment in.\npseudo-scripts undertaken by Mr. Salter. \" It may be asked\nwhether Mr. Salter, whose wife takes part in the mediumistic cross-\ncorrespondences, has attempted to discover pseudo-correspondences\nwith the same zeal which Piddington manifests when on the hunt\nafter alleged mediumistic ones. Most probably this was not the\ncase. Mr. Salter's good faith (I value him highly) is not ia\nquestion, it goes without saying ; unconscious hindrances may have\nprevented him from finding out coincidences which Mr. Piddington.\nwould have detected in the case of so-called genuine cross-\ncorrespondences. This question cannot be settled, since all the\npseudo-scripts have not been published.\"\nRevue M'kapsychique, March-April, 1928.\nDr. Osty has a long and profusely illustrated paper on BL\nMarjan Gruzewski, a Pole, born in Wilno in September 1898, who\nwithout, it is asserted, having learnt either drawing or painting,\nhas shown himself to be both a painter and a draughtsman when\nin a somnambulistic state, revealing apparently an innate knowledge\nof various technical details to which he had never paid attention\nbefore. The case is striking and interesting, but seems to me to\nbe to some extent vitiated by the following consideration. Before\nbeginning to paint and draw in a state of trance M. Gruzewski,\nwe are told, gave a great many seances for telekinesis and ma-\nterialisation. The materialised hands, he says, which moved objects\nwere projected generally out of his arm (p. 87). I wonder if after\nsuch assertions we may logically accept such unverifiable state-\nments as M. Gruzewski chooses to make about himself. It is\nobvious, I think, that unverified assertions made by a man\n\fJuly, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 311\nhaving produced \" phenomena \" whose genuineness is open to\ngrave doubts are of little value evidentially. On the other\nhaiad, in the present case we have evidence (pp. 99, 100,\n119 footnote) that, unlike M. Augustin Lesage (May Journal\nS.P.R. p. 265) M. Gruzewski ccm draw, even paint, in total\ndarkness, and in justice to him this circumstance must not be\nlost sight of.\nIn the Chronique M. Maurice Maire speaks very warmly of Prof.\nDriesch apropos of the latter's sixtieth anniversary. In a note on\nthe Konnersreuth stigmatica he expresses the opinion that Theresa\nNeumann's phenomena have not yet been controlled in an ade-\nquately scientific way and suggests a twenty-eight days' observa-\ntion under stringent conditions of T. N.'s alleged fasting. M. Maire\nfurther analyses the Etude's article on dowsing (see May Journal)\nand draws the conclusion that the Roman Catholic Church now\nadmits clairvoyance, after which we may expect that this will be\nthe case for other metapsychical phenomena too. It would have\nbeen more exact to point out that two or three centuries ago such\nperformances as those of the French priests referred to would have\nbeen drastically \" discouraged,\" whilst now they are eulogised by\na strictly Roman Catholic review.\nM. de Vesme has the beginning of a long paper on the\n\" legend \" of collective hallucination in connection with the rope\ntrick. His attitude seems to be entirely negative. I propose to\nreturn to his interesting study when it is finished, contenting\nmyself meanwhile with the remark that I know at first hand of\nat least three cases of \" fakir \" performances which seem to ex-\nclude trickery, though obviously not hallucination.\nZeitschrift filr Psychische Forsckung, May, 1928.\nDr. Hohenwarter of Klagenfurt, Carinthia, Austria, has an\nenthusiastic paper on Frau Marie Silbert, whom he visited at\nEaster. Various phenomena are described of the usual Silbertian\ntype (raps, also touches and direct writing under the table). The\nidea that the latter \" manifestations \" might have been produced\nby the medium's feet apparently does not even occur to the\nwriter. Dr. Hohenwarter is, by the way, a Roman Catholic priest,\nand his enthusiastic attitude (he compares Frau Silbert and\nTheresa Neumann !) makes him a rarissima avis indeed. He quotes\nby the way a characteristic passage from Professor Verweyen's\n\fSI 2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1928\nProUeme des Mediumismus (p. 210), which shows that this lady\nhas warm friends among savants too : the learned Professor thinks\nthe fact that she was born on Christmas night symbolical of her\nlife ! That such admirers should profoundly resent any suspicions\ncast on the object of their admiration is of course but natural\n;\nbut of what value, it may be asked, is their evidence 1\nProfessor Dr. August Messer concludes his paper on the \" Kon-\nnersreuth riddle.\" A few pages are devoted to the \" scientific\n\"\nattempts at an explanation of the phenomena, many extraordinary\ninstances of auto-suggestion and suggestion are quoted (the evi-\ndential character of some of them leaves, I am afraid, much to\nbe desired), and the conclusion is drawn that even supposing all\nthe accounts about Theresa Neumann were to correspond with\nactual fact. Science is by no means bound to lay down its arms.\nThe attitude of the Roman Catholic Church towards \" miracles\n\"\nin general and the Konnersreuth occurrences in particular is then\ndiscussed. We are told (p. 147) that \" very influential voices\n\"\nare now heard anxious to induce that Church to modify its cautious\nattitude towards the Bavarian seeress. (That such voices should\nbe heard in the present stage of the controversy is surely charac-\nteristic.) As Prof. Messer justly points out, a decision would have\nbeen much easier for the Roman Catholic Church were Professor\nVirchow's famous alternative :\n\" Fraud or Miracle still up to\ndate. As the matter now stands, he maintains, it may be asked\nwhether a definition of .\nsuch phenomena however unusual as\n\" miracles \" will not be objected to by Science in principle. For\nsurely one ought to know all natural laws without any exception\nin order to state definitively whether a given fact can or cannot\nbe explained by them. Such knowledge seems, however, inaccessible\nto us.\nProfessor Verweyen has a paper on \"Materialistic and ' Idealistic\nMediumship,\" and Dr. Zeller prints a note on the late Professor\nHaraldur Nielsson of Iceland (died March 12th).\nZagadnienia Metafsychiczne, No. 17-18, 1928.\nDr. Switkowski has a paper on hypnotism and magnetism, being\na paper read before the Lwow Metapsychical Society.\nM.

Dr. Ochorowicz and the writers Przy-\nbyszewski and Raymont are the communicators.\nA long account is reproduced from the Gazeta Poranna describing\nsome spontaneous physical phenomena investigated in March last\nby M. Aleksander Kuczera, a judge of Sambor. The phenomena\noccurred at Skwarzawa Nowa, near Zolkwia, iu a peasant's house.\nThe phenomena were of the usual type : telekinesis, also apporfs,\nthe latter apparently also in accordance with the wishes expressed\nby the judge (a little money!). M. Kuczera, however, was ob-\nserving the phenomena under conditions which must have strongly\nresembled those prevailing during the Crawford investigation at\nBelfast. May we express the hope that the Polish \" metapsy-\nchical \" societies, seemingly so numerous, will investigate the case^\nbe it only retrospectively, so that we should have in our possession\nevidence seriously corroborative of Judge Kuczera's account in the\nGazeta Poranna\u2014or disproving it ?

M. Rene Sudre has a\npaper on the Paris Congress (September-October 1927). He\nthinks Herr Karl Krall's contributions to this Congress the most\nvaluable of all. He notes with apparent regret that in spite of\nthe wish of a minority of Congressists the Congress failed to\nfollow the example of that of Warsaw in establishing a clean-\ncut line of demarcation between \" metapsychics \" and spiritualism,\nto which, he thinks, the attitude assumed by Prof. Richet and\nOlivier Lodge {sic), \" the invisible leader of the English delegation,\"\nand Prof. Driesch chiefly contributed. M. Sudre still seems\nextremely anxious to segregate \" metapsychics \" from the spirit\nhypothesis, but in my opinion he is labouring under a miscon-\nception. I do not think that, as pointed out by M. Sudre, no\n\u2022other member of the French Universite than Prof. Richet took\npart in the Congress because \" metapsychics have not yet broken\n\u2022off deliberately from scenes of possession.\" A spirit hypo-\nthesis based on thoroughly established facts can be no deterrent\nto scientific men worthy of the name. It is such facts we want\n;\nand when we have got them\n\u2014\nif we have got them\u2014we need not\nbe afraid of the thesis of fost-mortem action. \" Metapsychics\n\"\nmay be much more comj^romised by thorough materialists or\nmonists operating with \" experiments \" or \" observations\n\"\"\nun-\nworthy of attention.

In this Bulletin, entitled \" Evidential Incidents,\" are\npublished accounts, gradually accumulated by the Boston Society,\n\u2022of a number of more or less \" evidential \" incidents of a very\nmiscellaneous character, recorded by twelve different persons\n\u2014\nsome of the recorders describing more than one incident.

They vary considerably\nin interest and in evidential value, and to give a full account, or\nuseful analysis, or detailed criticism, would take too much space.\nWe will only say, therefore, that in the case of most of them we\nfeel the B.S.P.R. has done well to publish them, and that per.sons\ninterested in psychical research will study them with profit.\nE.

Conan Doyle on\n\" Thomas Lake Harris : A Strange Prophet.\"' Mr. F. von Reuter\ndiscusses Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's views on the \" Origin of\nthe Phenomena of Materialisation.\" He gives a number of quo-\ntations from Dr. von Schrenck's report on the sittings with Eva\nC. to show that he \" inclines towards a rejection of the spiritistic\ntheory in favour of the psycho-dynamical conception.'\" The article\nis not concerned with the genuineness of the phenomena, which is\ntaken for granted. Mr. von Reuter also gives an account of some\nsittings in which he recently took part in Dr. von Schrenck's\nlaboratory with four mediums, the brothers Schneider, Blandina T.,\nand Oscar S. The writer is himself convinced of the absolutely\nfraud-proof nature of the conditions obtaining at these sittings ;\nhis report, however, is only a resume of what occurred, not suffi-\nciently detailed to enable those who have not witnessed the\nphenomena to form a conclusion.\nThe article ends with a note on the accusation of fraud brought\nagainst the Schneider brothers by Mr. Vinton.\nMr. Warwick has a further article on his experiments with Mrs.\nDeane, in which slate-writing phei;omena were obtained. The\narticle includes a description of two pieces of apparatus devised\nby Mr. Warwick for use at sittings for physical phenomena.

Rene Sudre has an article on \" The Psychic Faculty in the\nMedical Field,\" in which he gives an account of an investigation\nof the alleged cures effected by a professional magnetiser, Mme.\nG-ermaiae of Nancy. The conclusion to which M. Sudre comes is\nthat there is no evidence for the special \" emanation \" whereby\nMme. Germaine alleges that she effects her cures ; such success as\nshe obtains is probably due to suggestion. M. Sudre regards the\nquestion of the existence of some unknown form of human radia-\ntion as one which is still open, but can be proved only by labora-\ntory experiment. H. de G.

Rene Warcollier read a paper on \" L'accord tele-\npathique,\" which was illustrated by lantern slides. The whole\npaper is to be published in the Revue Metapsychique ; the\nabstract in English, which was distributed to the audience, is\nprinted below.\nABSTRACT OF MONSIEUR WARCOLLIER'S PAPER.\nImportance of ascertaining conditions favourable to telepathy.\nClassification of phenomena as experimental or spontaneous is too\nbroad. Telepathy may be (1) spontaneous on both sides, (2) ex-\nperimental on the agent's side, spontaneous on the percipient's\n(Example). (3) In experimental telepathy, involving a group of\npersons, spontaneous cases may arise. It might seem that sym-\npathy was one of the conditions favouring telepathy and in the\ngreat majority of spontaneous cases sympathy exists ; but it is\nnot a necessary condition (Example). Indifference and antipathy\nmay provoke telepathy (Example). Sometimes telepathy seems to\nhave a definite focus, sometimes to wander at random. We must\ntherefore conclude that a great number of factors are concerned.\nPART I.\n(1) When a number of persons share a perception, telepathic\nrapport may be established between them. This is the type that\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nmay occur spontaneously in the case of persons in churcli, at\nmeetings, etc.\nCorollary. When a group of persons are thinking of the same\nagent, rapport may be established between them (Examples).\nThese cases of \" mental contagion \" must be distinguished\nfrom cases of collective telepathy which are referable to the\nagent (Example). This fact of spontaneous rapport be-\ntween percipients was noted by the old magnetisers (Example\nfrom Carl du Prel). Possible instances of spontaneous rapport\nbetween animals. Experiments with horses ;\n\" the group mind \"\n;\napparent telepathy between insects ; the matter deserves syste-\nmatic study.\n(2) When several persons perceive objects different but resem-\nbling each other, telepathic rapport may be established between\nthem (Example). This kind of telepathic rapport is understood\nby savage peoples (Example from the Huichol Indians on pilgrimage).\n(3) Speaking generally, when several persons perceive objects\nwhich are generically but not specifically the same, telepathic\nrapport may occur between them. (Example of Mr. Marks\nwho, driven home by a summer shower, fell asleep and dreamt\nof his brother's shipwreck in a storm, an event which actually\noccurred at the time 200 miles away. Mrs. Sidgwick raises the\nquestion whether the summer shower and the storm offer enough\nresemblance to produce a community of ideas between the\nbrothers and facilitate telepathic rapport.)\n(4) When several persons have the same preoccupation or aim,\ntelepathic rapport may occur. (Example : M. Warcollier perceived\nan object not transmitted by the agent with whom he was\nexperimenting, but which another agent (of the group) was\nintending to transmit half an hour later.) An attempt was made\nto produce this rapport artificially by giving agent and percipients\na definite and common object upon which to focus their thoughts\nduring the experiment. (Examples (1) the curtain; (2) the knotted\nstring.) Difficulties owing to arousing ideas associated with the\nobject selected.\nPART II.\nAction of the Percipient on the Agent.\nThe simplest form of telepathy is when two minds accidentally\nchime together. We must now consider what part is played\n\fOctober, 1928 Meetivgs 321\nby the agent's will acting on the percipient, or vice-versa. The\npercipient appears to be the principal factor, though the agent\nis not negligible. A percipient who knows he is working\nwith several agents cannot direct his conscious and unconscious\nthoughts and is liable to fail. An agent working with several\npercipients may try to influence one to the exclusion of the\nothers, but rarely succeeds (Examples). In these cases the directing\nof the agent's thoughts had no effect ; the only effective factor\nwas the percipient's will to receive a message, i.e. to open a pre-\ndetermined door in his subconscious mind.\nVarious Objects of Transmission.\n(1) Attitudes; (2) tactile sensations; (.3) auditory sensations,\npossible hyperaesthesia ; (4) visual sensations.\nPART III.\nAction of the Agent on the Percipient.\nThis appears obvious in some spontaneous cases. In what\ncan it consist ? One agent in the group, M. de S., uses entirely\nthe method of willed action ; I myself often deliberately adopt the\ncontrary method, and yet I get as good results as M. de S.\nSome trained agents, when they have succeeded in focussing their\naction on a percipient, signify their awareness of their success.\nThis we call \" linking up \" ; it is the complement of what occurs\nwith trained percipients. But we ourselves have not acquired, at\nleast as agents, this valuable faculty, though we have had some\nencouraging results.\nReport on a Group of Ten Experiments between\nM. DE S. and Myself.\nThe distance between us varied from a few yards to 800 kilometres.\nThe results do not seem to have been affected by the distance.\n1 Expt. I. A. (3) Two glass globes full of stuffed birds sitting on a\ntree. \" The birds fly and flutter round your head.\"\nP. (3) \"A white bird like a sea-gull with M. de\nS.'s head, sweeping round on its left wing and\ncoming to ground near me.\"\nExpt. II. A. (2)\n\" I thought of a horse-hair glove on a bottle.\n(3) drew it, (4) thought of associated ideas : gym-\nnastics, hygiene, health,\" etc.\n1 In this abstract only successful results are given.\n\f322 Journal vj Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nP. (1) Man's arm, brown, hairy, hoeing the ground,\n(2) brown man turning backwards as on a trapeze,\n(3) child doing gymnastics ; (4) sailors jumping from j\none platform to another. :\nExpt. III. A. (2) Drawing; idea of geometry.\nP. (3) Flying buttress of masonry, supporting a wall\n;\na very high pillar of stone supporting a metal\nframework. (4) A man on all fours, recognised as\nM.

A. (2) A heap of manure, a boy with his apron full\nof grass, a peasant with two buckets ; (3) sketch\nof peasant ; (4) evening at the farm.\nP. (3) a man's head, unknown, frank and cheerful\naspect ; (5) a bundle of hay, a bound truss.\nKesume of results.\nConclusion.\nWhat we appear to get is a combination of thought-reading by the\npercipient and transmission of thought by the agent. The agent\nmust play some part, or we should not get good and bad agents.\nBoth agent and percipient must focus their thoughts outside their\nnormal consciousness, to meet, as it were, in a psychic world.\nThere is in the agent a kind of psychic illumination, which\n\fOctober, 1928 Meetings 323\nis unconscious, but may be voluntarily evoked by certain kinds\nof psychic training. It can also be discovered by a percipient\nwhose thoughts are focussed on the agent.\nEXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING.\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting for Members only was\nheld in the Rooms of the Society on July 18th, 1928, at\n3.30 p.m., to consider the Agenda annexed to the Requsition\nsigned by twelve members of the Society.\nThe President was in the chair. There were also present :\nMrs. Jessica Arnold, Mr. Theodore Besterman, Mr. W. R.\nBousfield, K.C., ]\\Irs. Brackenbury, Mrs. Bulley, ]\\Irs.

Tarpey, who was unable to be present\nherself. At the close of the statement Mrs. Bulley stated that\nshe wished to move a Resolution, but, in view of the provisions\nof the Companies Acts, the Chairman ruled that at that\nmeeting any Resolution not set out in the Agenda would be\nout of order. A discussion followed in which the following\nMembers took part : Miss Newton, ]\\'Ir. Summerson, Mr.\nBousfield, Mr. Piddington, ]\\Ir. Dingwall, Col. Maxwell Dick,\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octobee, 1928\nand Mrs. Salter. Mr. Dingwall put three questions, to which\nhe said he did not expect an answer at that meeting. The\nChairman said the Council would reply to the questions when\nthey had considered them.\nClauses 2 and 3 of the Agenda, setting out proposed\nResolutions to alter certain of the Society's Articles of Associa-\ntion, and to fix the hour of the Society's meetings, were then\nread. Mr. Dingwall said that the proposers named in the\nAgenda did not intend to move any of the Resolutions at\nthat meeting but to postpone the moving of them until after\nthe Committee appointed to consider the revision of the Articles\nhad reported. A member, Mr. H. E. C. Gatlifi (who was not\none of the proposers named in the Agenda), thereupon moved\nthe Resolutions in order to obtain the decision of the meeting.\nThe Chairman, notwithstanding certain protests, accepted the\nmotion. On a show of hands there appeared :\nFor the Resolutions, 3 votes.\nAgainst the Resolutions, 28 votes,\n22 members abstaining from voting. The Resolutions were\ntherefore declared lost.\nMr. Scott, as a member of the Committee above referred to,\ninvited suggestions from any member of the Society as regards\nthe revision of the Articles.\nThe meeting then proceeded to consider Clause 4 of the\nAgenda\u2014\" Inquiry arising out of the statement of the Hon.\nResearch Officer at the last Annual General Meeting that\nexperimental Research into physical phenomena is discontinued.\"^\nIn the discussion which followed, Mr. Dingwall, Dr. Woolley,\nMr. Salter, Mr. Piddington, Mrs. Sidgwick, and Mr. Lambert\ntook part.\nThe Council wish to thank those Members of the Society\n(274 in number) who responded to the Council's request by sending\nin proxies in their favour for the meeting of July 18th. One\nproxy was lodged in favour of the Requisitionists.\nSeveral Members who lodged proxies also attended the meeting.\n* The Council is not responsible for the wording of this clause, which does not\naccurately represent what Dr. Woolley said at the meeting.\n\fOctober, 1928 The Fire Walk 325\nTHE FIRE WALK.\nWe print below a group of communications we have received con-\ncerning the Report on the Fire Walk which appeared in the Journal\nfor June last, p. 278.\n(1) On p. 284 of the June Journal appeared a statement\nfrom Lord Sydenham's Private Secretary. We have now\nobtained through Lord Selborne a corroborative statement from\nLord Sydenham himself. Lord Selborne writes to Mrs. Henry\nSidgwick, as follows :\n'\nJuly 4, 1928.\nI have seen Lord Sydenham to-day. He tells me he was present at\nthe firewalking all the time, that the flames curled up the legs, so\nfierce was the fire, that he made his medical officer examine the\nfeet and legs of the firewalkers in his presence, and that his A.D.C.\ngave the testimonial on his authority. He says that the legs and\nfeet of the firewalkers were absolutely unscathed.\nSelborne.\nTo this letter was appended the following note by Lord\nSydenham :\n7.7.28.\nThis is absolutely correct, but it may be added that at first\nthese chelas walked over red-hot coals in a shallow trench. Then\nstraw was thrown on which caused a blaze.\nSydenham.\n(2) We have also received the following corroboration from\nMrs. Willock, a Member of the Society, who was an eye-\nwitness of the fire walk in 1900 :\nJune 17, 1928.\nThe account of the Fire Walking in the June Journal interests me\nmuch. I should like to add my testimony to that of the others. Evi-\ndently I saw the same fakir ; as you will see from the enclosed\ncircular which I have kept all these years among other Indian\ncuriosities. Of course the slight difference of spelling is nothing,\nsince the translation of Urdu letters into Roman is more or less\na matter of taste. In about 1902 I wrote an account of the\nfire walk for a little magazine\n\u2014\nThe Penny Magazine (Cassell)\n\u2014\nnow probably defunct. According to this . . . the trenches were\n*'\nabout 40 feet by 7 feet \" and in the form of a cross ; the\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nRishi (fakir) himself, taking some children with him, was the\nfirst to pass over the live charcoal, and a very large number of\nall sorts of natives followed his example. Some of our party\nwere anxious to try our luck, but it was not considered the thing\nfor us to do so. . . . However, my syce did go through without\nany sign of burning, and later when it was all over I threw his\ncummerbund\u2014a heavily stitched waistband made of several thick-\nnesses of coloured cloth to form stripes round his waist\u2014in the still\nburning trench. It smouldered slowly, curled up and turned\nblack, so that the intense heat we all felt when near the trenches\ncould not have been hypnotic. The preliminaries were distinctly\nreligious ;\nduring the prayers the Rishi threw a good deal of fluid\nabout from large earthen jars, and it was suggested that since\nthe believers splashed through the fluid as it lay on the ground it\nmight be some secret medium to prevent burning.

Craufnrd,\nR.N., F.R.S.A. :\nThe case of Fire Walking reported in the S.P.R. Journal for\nJune offers an interesting subject for pure psychic research.\nBy psychic research I do not mean the usual parade of pre-\nconceived opinion, but rather the examination of phenomena which\nare at present unknown to Science. Psychic Research, by a mere\nprocess of negation, leads nowhere. The exposure of some method\nof conjuring leads to nothing.\nThe question that we want to consider is this :\nSupposing the facts of the case are precisely as they have been\nreported, what exactly does the meaning of the phenomena\nobserved amount to ?\nBriefly it appears to be this :\nCertain human beings can be possessed of powers which render\nnot only themselves but others immune, for a limited period, to\nthe action of fire.\nLet us accept this as granted for an hypothesis and proceed\nto enquire what it implies according to our present knowledge.\nBurning coals, as we know, will scorch the feet of those\nwho walk over them unless the transference of heat energy is\nnullified.\nThere is a well-known trick which I personally have seen performed\nin an iron foundry. A man who knows the trick will place his bare\narm in a mass of molten iron. It is not so much a trick as the\nexhibition of knowledge. The man who performs, knows by\nexperience that the thing can be done. The explanation is that\nan insulating layer of perspiration is formed by the intense heat\nof the molten iron. The writer is unfortunately aware that\nnothing of the kind takes place in the case of a red-hot poker\nand prefers to believe rather than test the explanation.\nThis carries us nowhere in the case of the firewalkers, yet\nif we can get an explanation that will cover their case it may\nthrow another light on the molten iron experiment. Heat is a\n\f328 Jnnrvdl of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nmode of motion, as Professor Tyndall illustrated so admirably in\nhis popular lectures.\nFire is only a remarkable exhibition of heat ; the combustion\nof wood, coal or any other substance bursts into flame or a glow-\ning temperature when the motion is sufficiently intense. This\nintense motion, known as high temperature, always tends to spread\nin the direction of a lower temperature or less energetic exhibition\nof motion which by comparison we call cool. Thus if there be\nthree sources of heat, \" A,\" \" B,\" \" C,\" and if C is the cooler,\nwhile A and B are both in a high state of intense motion, A and\nB will endeavour to part with sufficient of their energy to raise\nC into an equal condition to themselves. C does not part with\nsome of its own particular energy ; on the contrary it absorbs\nenergy from A or B or both. This is what apparently occurred\nin the case of the firewalkers.\nA is the fakir, B represents the bystanders who borrowing some\nkind of energy from A, parted with it to the cooler substance in\nthe fire trench, C. We therefore have to imagine a form of\nenergy so intense, that by comparison the energy of glowing coal\nis feeble. If we turn to the Solar Spectrum we have an illustra-\ntion of such kinds of energy. At the red end are the heat rays,\nbut at the violet end the energy, not exhibited as sensible heat,\nis far more intense. The \" heat \" is there so far as being a mode\nof motion is concerned, but to our nerves it is cool. In ordinary\nlanguage it is light rather than heat.\nWe have now come to the question as to what would occur if\nA and B are radiating light energy in excess of the amount of heat\nenergy given out by C. I am not aware of any experiment that\ndirectly answers this question unless it be admitted that direct\nsunlight puts the fire out. Personally, after considerable observa-\ntion, I believe this is true.\nI submit as a theory for research that in the case of the\nfakir he creates an aura of intense but invisible light, that the\nauras of all human beings in his vicinity respond to this human\nform of energy, and that while it lasts in a very intense form it\ntends to overcome the energy known as heat. Now it is not\nbeyond our laboratory resources to create ultra-violet rays of\nlight and to bathe an object in this form of energy. It would\nbe interesting to experiment and discover whether under such\nconditions a body so illuminated would resist ordinary dull red\n\fOCTOBEE, 1928 The Fire Walk 329\nheat. Something of this kind is actually indicated in well-known\nphenomena, for a white object will remain cool in the direct\nrays of the sun much longer than a dark object. The whiter\nsurface can respond to the higher vibrations of light in a way\nthat the dark surface which will respond to the red end of the\nspectrum cannot do. The consequence is that the dark object\nabsorbs heat energy much quicker than the light object: it gets\nhot. Moreover, we are aware of certain kinds of flame or glow\nwhich give no sensible heat, they are phosphorescent. We know\nthis much at any rate.\nIt is the rate of absorption which counts in the transference of\nradiant heat, and if by any means the rate of absorbing heat\nenergy can be checked, very wonderful results are produced.\nConsider the following experiment so beloved by Professor\nTyndall : A piece of painted wood is taken and on it a design is\nmade in the thinnest gold-leaf. This is exposed to the heat of a\nfire until the paint is blistered and the wood charred. Under-\nneath the gilt letters, however, the wood is found to be quite\nunaffected. Why ? Merely because the thin gilt surface refused\nto accept the coarser form of energy known as heat, the gilt\nsurface reflects or turns back the destructive rays of heat. In\nthe language now popular for wireless radiation, we should say\nit is not \" tuned \" to the lower frequency. Space, of course, does\nnot admit of a closer reasoning, but I hope to have indicated a\nline of thought.\nREVIEWS.\nI. Bulletin No. V. of the Boston Society for Psychical Research,\nFebruary 1927. \" A Contribution to Experimental Telepathy,\"\nby G. H. EsTABROOKS, Ph.D. Pp. 28.\nWe did not review this important Bulletin, which describes\nexperiments conducted in the Psychological Laboratory of Harvard\nUniversity, at the time of its publication, because for some unex-\nplained reason\u2014possibly loss in the post\u2014it did not reach our\nlibrary till after the following four numbers, which have already\nbeen reviewed. When it did reach us we thought it might be\nbetter to wait for the promised publication of a similar series of\nexperiments which Dr. Estabrooks tells us were being carried out\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nby another experimenter at Springfield College, Mass., and consider\nthem together. However, as the report of the Springfield experi-\nments has still not reached us, we will not delay longer calling\nthe attention of our members to Dr. Estabrooks' results.\nHis aim was to conduct experiments under what he calls\n\" laboratory conditions \" with normal persons not known to possess\ntelepathic powers. By \" laboratory conditions \" he means, if I\nunderstand him rightly, conditions treating agent and percipient\nas much as possible as if they were machines\u2014endeavouring to\neliminate all emotions or sensory impressions or thoughts which\ncould have any influence on the guess made by the percipient.\nThere were three series of experiments, all made with playing cards.\nDr. Estabrooks was the agent and sat in one room, while the\npercipients\u2014one at a time\u2014sat in an adjoining room with closed\ndoors between. We cannot of course give here the full description\nof the experiments, but roughly speaking the agent drew cards at\nrandom at the rate of three a minute and for each drawing the\npercipient, timed by clockwork signals, wrote down the first card\nthat came into his head. Each percipient made 20 such guesses\nin succession, and only in a few instances was the same percipient\nused for a second set of guesses. The total number of guesses\nmade was 1660 (in 83 sets of 20), and of these 938 were right as\nto colour as against 830 to be expected by chance, and 473 right\nas to suit as against 415 to be expected by chance. This, added\nto the distribution of the successes, makes it practically certain\nthat something other than chance was in operation. The interest-\ning point about the distribution of the successes was that in each\nseries the first 10 guesses in each set of 20 showed in the aggre-\ngate a higher proportion of successes than the second 10, suggesting\nthat some capacity was at work which rapidly deteriorated with\nuse.\nA separate series of experiments was tried with agent and\npercipient in rooms still in the same building but separated from\neach other by a greater distance and by four closed doors. These\nwere tried on the same day and immediately following those of\nthe first of the three series already mentioned, and with the same\npercipients. In this series the result was negative\u2014no success\nbeyond chance was obtained. Dr. Estabrooks is inclined to\nattribute this \" largely to the distance factor with perhaps an\nelement of . . . some factor such as adverse auto-suggestion.\" The\n\fOctober, 1928 Reviews 331\nfirst hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with the facts of spontaneous\ntelepathy. The second was the explanation Mrs. Sidgwick and\nMiss Alice Johnson were inclined to think applied in the case of\nsimilar failures of their own to obtain experimental thought-\ntransference at a distance after succeeding at closer quarters (see\nProc. vol. viii. p. 147). It is to be hoped that further experi-\nments will help to clear up this obviously very important question.\nE. M. S.\nII. The Basis of Memory. By W. E. Bousfield, K.C, F.R.S.\nKegan Paul & Co., London. Pp. 132. 1928.\nMemory is a big subject and one that raises very difficult\nquestions. If we really knew all about memory we should prob-\nably have got a long way towards understanding the problems\nthat confront us in psychical research. Therefore when first\nasked to review this little book I hesitated, feeling that my\nknowledge of all that has been said and written about memory\nis not sufficient to entitle me to speak on the subject.\nHowever, Mr. Bousfield is mainly concerned to point out the\ninadequacy of a certain physiological\u2014or perhaps better, mech-\nanical\u2014theory of the basis of memory, and this he does with\nforce and clearness, so that his book may be recommended as a\nuseful statement of the particular theory and a suggestive con-\nsideration of it. The theory is briefly that memory depends on\npermanent impressions on the brain, some of which are inherited,\nbut others continually added through the senses (sight, hearing,\netc.). These impressions, called \" engrams \" by Professor Semon,\nwhose discussion of the subject Mr. Bousfield takes as his text,\nremain latent unless and until revived as a memory image of the\noriginal stimulus by some influence such as the operation of an\nassociated sensation or idea. The existence of \" engrams,\" it must\nbe noted, is purely hypothetical for, as Professor Semon says,\n\" We are at present quite in the dark as to the special morpho-\nlogical nature of that surviving alteration in organic substance\nwhich we call an engram.\" Granting the possibility that\n\" engrams \" may be produced through the senses, Mr. Bousfield\npoints out that in what we remember psychic factors are involved,\ne.g. it is a matter of common experience that we may remember\nthe meaning of a sentence heard or read without remembering\nthe exact words\u2014but the engram ex hypothesi is produced by the\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nsensory impression, the sound or sight of the words, not their\nmeaning. Again, we can select between contemporary sense\nimpressions which to remember, by attending to one and neglecting\nthe others ; but attention is an affair of the consciousness, not of\nthe senses ; the sound, or sight, or touch experienced is mechani-\ncally the same whether we attend to it or not. Further, we can\nand do remember thoughts and ideas which have not come to us\ndirectly through the senses at all. These and other points are\ndiscussed and illustrated at length, and it is thus made clear that\nmere engrams produced by impressions through the senses in the\nstructure of the brain, will not by themselves serve as a sufficient\nbasis for memory. Mr. Bousfield regards as a more plausible\nhypothesis that memory depends on what he calls \" psycho-\ngrams \" in the structure of the mind. Of what the structure of\nthe mind consists we are, of course, completely ignorant, but\nMr. Bousfield inclines to the view that such part of it, at any\nrate, as receives psychograms forming the basis of memory, is a\nphysical though not a material substance\u2014possibly an arrange-\nment of the ether which is supposed to carry the vibrations of\nlight and electricity. But we need not follow him in these\nspeculations, on which indeed he touches but lightly.\nI have not, of course, in my bald account of the book done\njustice either to Mr. Bousfield's statement of Professor Semon's\ntheory, or to his vigorous assault on it, but I hope I have said\nenough to show that readers will find in this book a suggestive\nanalysis of some part of the problem of the basis of memory.\nE. M. S.\nIII. Why I Believe in Personal Immortality. By Sir Oliver\nLodge. Cassell & Co., London, Toronto, Melbourne, and\nSydney. Pp. viii, 15L\nI suppose that Sir Oliver Lodge's title is a concession to the\npopular prejudice which is more impressed with the fact that an\neminent person believes a certain doctrine than with the reasons\nhe has for holding his belief ; but the book itself is free from all\nsuggestion of egotism and authoritarianism. It is a singularly\nsimple, lucid, and persuasive statement of the scientific grounds on\nwhich Sir Oliver finds the belief in personal immortality tenable\nand convincing. He is candid enough to dissociate himself\n\fOCTOBEE, 1928 Reviews 333\n\" respectfully \" (but quite unequivocally) from the very dubious\narguments which may be called that from theology, and that\nfrom desire, being respectively \" based on the postulate of the\ngoodness and reasonableness of a Creator \" and on \" man's in-\nstinctive revulsion from the idea of annihilation and on the\npostulate that evolved instincts must have some correspondence\nwith reality,\" and declares that his \" whole contention rests on a\nbasis of experience and on acceptance of a class of facts which\ncan be verified at first hand by others if they take the trouble,\"\nand that \" individual personal continuance is to me a demon-\nstrated fact \"\n(p. V.)- He is also careful to point out that \" im-\nmortality \" should not be taken to mean infinite existence, for\n\" survival of personality is all that we can hope to establish\n\"\n(p. vi.).\nLogically, his strategy seems to be very sound on all these\npoints. For whatever may have been true in the past, it seems\nclear that at present theology is very half-hearted and weak-kneed\nabout the belief in a future life. We need not inquire whether\nthe reason is that apologetics have lapsed into feeblemindedness\nor that the \" faith \" of theologians has been corroded by unavowed\nscepticism. The argument from desire plainly depends on the\nprior postulate that the world is too rational to disappoint our\n(present) desires, and moreover encounters the awkward fact that\nquite a large number of persons seem to be genuinely (though\nno doubt for good personal reasons) devoid of any craving for\nimmortality. Lastly, it is pretty clear that \" immortality \" is\nstrictly a misnomer for \" future life.\" When people ask for it\nthey mean survival of \" the wrenching experience \" which is death,\nand they would readily agree that they \" need at present take no\nthought \" of \" further adventures \" and greater \" discontinuities.\"\nIn detail, the book is composed of seven chapters, on a cosmic\nview of life and mind, on seven propositions on which the belief\nin immortality may rest, on the case for Psychical Research,\non psychical phenomena (which makes much of the remarkable\nChaffin Will case and of the prediction about Sir Oliver's present\nhouse seven years before he took it), on mediumship, on how to\ncommunicate with the departed, and a final summary.\nThroughout Sir Oliver speaks with no uncertain voice about\nwhat he rightly regards as an invaluable belief, while always\ndistinguishing clearly between its logical basis and the psycho-\n\f334 Joumal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nlogical inferences he feels entitled to draw. Thus on p. 41, he\npoints out that \" gradually the proof of personal identity is being\nestablished in a careful and systematic manner,\" and continues,\n\" to me the evidence is now virtually complete, and I have no\nmore doubt of the continued existence of surviving personalities\nthan I have of any deduction from ordinary normal experience.\"\nHe has no doubt that despite the usual obstruction of the con-\nservative opposition (p. 47) his belief will prevail. Even though\nat present \" to the Church a stumbling-block and to Science\nfoolishness \", it is \"to the bereaved a power and a comfort of\ninestimable value \"\n(p. 128).\nAs for criticism, there is little to be said. The backbone of\nSir Oliver's view is, of course, his interpretation of matter as\nmerely an instrument of mind, and mind as the natural denizen,\nnot of the material earth, but of the cosmic ether. This conception\nof the relation of mind to body is scientifically legitimate and\nirrefragable, because any evidence which can be alleged to show that\nmind depends on matter for its existence can be interpreted as show-\ning merely that it depends on matter only for its manifestation to\nour senses. Thus the theory is logically unanswerable ; so much so\nindeed and so awkward for materialistic physiologists and psycho-\nlogists that they have found no better way of dealing with it than\nto suppress all reference to it so far as they could. But William\nJames has named it the transmission theory of the relation of\nmind to matter, and psychical researchers have every reason for\nassociating it with his name and with his exposition in Human\nImmortality. It is a little strange, therefore, that Sir Oliver should\nquote for it from Prof. Lutoslawski, especially as he appeals to\nJames to sponsor Lutoslawski (p. 24). Personally, I should also\nlike to remark that I suspect that personality, survival, and\nindeed the whole field of Psychical Research, may turn out to be\nfar more complex and divergent from our present ideas than Sir\nOliver makes them out to be ; I anticipate also that the contri-\nbutions of psychology to their elucidation will be found to be far\nmore important, fertile, and in the end decisive, than those of\neither biology or physics. But though Sir Oliver may have\nsimplified overmuch, it can hardly be doubted that this fault, if\nsuch it be, has only added to the charm and effectiveness of his\nbook. F. C. S.

William James' hypothesis of a cosmic\nreservoir of memories, to which a medium may have access, though\nnot acceptable to Bergson himself, cannot be altogether ruled out\nin weighing evidence. The ChafRn Will case, being initiated by\na dream, is in a stronger category than mediumistic communica-\ntions, but even there memory cannot be entirely eliminated.\nI then told Bergson the following story, which greatly impressed\nhim. If true, he considered it the best evidence for survival that\nhe had heard, as it consisted in the correction of a mistake.\nNow a mistake is, philosophically speaking, nothing ; it cannot\nform part of any cosmic pool of memories.\nI had not, till now, realized the unique character of my story,\nso propose to put it on record in the hope that even now corro-\nboration may be forthcoming.\nAbout fifteen years ago my late brother, Herbert Jones, was\nBishop of Lewes and Archdeacon of Chichester. On one of his\ntours in W. Sussex he stayed with a rector who told him this\ntale, which I repeat from memory.\nAn elderly gentleman who had made a fortune in the East\ncame to live in the parish and shortly afterwards died. A hand-\nsome tombstone was set up over his grave, and the family went\naway and settled at some distance. One day the rector was\ncalled upon by the deceased's son-in-law, who said that his wife\nwas suffering from a recurrent dream, in which her father\nappeared to her and complained that his tombstone had been\nerected over the wrong grave. The sexton was sent for and asked\nif this were possible. \" Quite impossible,\" was the reply, \" as\nmy brother died just after Mr. X. and was buried in the next\ngrave, and I could not possibly have made any mistake when the\ntombstone was put up.\" The son-in-law was quite satisfied and\n\fOctober, 1928 Correspondence 337\ndeparted, but returned after a few weeks to say that the dreams\nwere worse than ever and that he feared his wife would go out\nof her mind. A Home Oifice permit to exhume was accordingly\nobtained, and when the grave was opened it was found that the\nmonument had been erected over the coffin of the sexton's brother.\nThe mistake was rectified and the hauntings ceased.\nNo corroboration could be obtained at the time, but in view of\nthe importance of obtaining evidence of survival, I hope that some\nreader may be able to assist in verification. Names of persons\nand places can be disguised, if so desired, for publication.\nLawrence J. Jones.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In the May, 1928, Journal there are one or two points\nwhich, I think, call for brief discussion. I shall consider them\nseriatim.\n(1) In the Case of Theresa Neumann, it is stated that increases\nin weight occasionally follow marked losses. Now, in fasting\ncases, this is occasionally noted. The patient may weigh more\nat the end of two or three days' fast than he does at the beginning.\nThis is due to the fact that the tissues of the body are, as we\nsay, \" obstipated,\" that is, dense\u2014like a sponge which is tightly\nsqueezed in the hand. Fasting relieves this condition, and the\ntissues soak up a certain quantity of water,\u2014just as the sponge\ndoes, when the grip of the hand is released. The result is that a\nnoticeable increase in weight is present. Of course, this is only\ntemporary, and water must be drunk freely in order for this effect\nto be noted. I do not pretend that this in any way accounts for\nTheresa's increase in weight\u2014especially as it is stated that she did\nnot drink water during her fasting periods. I merely suggest\nthat this fact should be taken into account,\u2014inasmuch as certain\nincreases are physiologically normal, while fasting.\n(2) In reviewing Professor Richet's book, Count Solovovo\nmentions Bert Eeese. I shall not enter into the disputed point\nas to the genuineness of his pellet readings\u2014though I have seen\nhim do some very remarkable things, which I could in no wise\nexplain\u2014but shall merely express my opinion that Eeese possessed\ngenuine psychic power of no mean order. Even assuming that the\npellets were read in a perfectly normal manner, the fact remains\n\f33S Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, if)28\nthat, ill replying to these questions, Reese often made predictions\nand asserted certain things which were subsequently proved to be\nabsolutely accurate. I knew Reese well, and I believe he con-\nsidered me a friend ; but only shortly before his death Reese told\nme confidentially that he often made statements without knowing\nin the least why,\u2014which turned out to be true. He said to me :\n\" I give you my word, Carrington, I don't know why I say these\nthings ;\nthey just '\ncome into my mouth,' and I say them.\" I\nhave always contended that Reese possessed genuine psychic\npower, and I believe so still.\nHereward Carrington.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, June 1928. A third and last\ninstalment of Dr. Pagenstecher's \" Clairvoyance in the past, present\nand future \" is printed. Dr. Gustavo Peter's (Mexico City)\ncritical letter dated September 3rd, 1925, will be read with\npeculiar interest.\nDr. R. Tischner describes two seances with Frau Silbert (March\n1927), and this account, couched in moderate and sensible terms,\nthoroughly deserves attention. Many of the remarks made are\nvery judicious and reasonable. Among the phenomena observed\nsome movements of a heavy table and two levitations of the same\nin good light seem to have particularly impressed the Munich\ninvestigator. As for me, I would have attached most importance\nto a case of bell-ringing under the table with Dr. Tischner observ-\ning the medium's four extremities, were it not that a nephew of\nthe medium was present at the sitting in question ; which circum-\nstance, as Dr. T. himself admits, may appear suspicious to sceptics.\nWith this observation I thoroughly agree. Frau S.'s reputation\nseems to me too doubtful not to admit that she may avail herself\noccasionally of the services of accomplices.\nDr. Wilhelm Neumann of Baden-Baden discusses some experi-\nments of the (late) Russian Professor BechterefE's on thought-\ntransference from man to dog described in Zeitschrift fur Psy-\nchotherapie und Medizinische Psychologic (8 Band), and concludes\nthat the results obtained are entirely due to unconscious indica-\ntions. I have the pleasure of knowing Dr. N., and his attitude in\nthe present instance strikes me the more as he is, I believe;\n\fOctober, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 339\nconvinced of the authenticity of Guzik's phenomena. I wonder\nwhat would happen to the latter were Dr. N. to apply to them\nthe same hypercritical criteria. Individual idiosyncrasies play a\nvery important part in the attitude assumed towards alleged\nsupernormal phenomena : very important and\u2014arbitrary.\nDr. G. Zeller makes a few \" religio-psychological and literary\nremarks \" a propos of the Konnersreuth case, and Frau Haase-\nBaudevia quotes from von Gorres' Christliche Mystik a case\nof investigation by a special commission of an instance of mass\npossession among nuns at Auxonne (France) in 1662. Among the\nphenomena recorded is a case of handling by one of the eighteen\nnuns of a live coal with impunity.\nCountess Wassilko-Serecki again energetically defends herself\nagainst Dr. H. Eosenbusch's imputations re the Zugun case. She\nalso mentions that Karl Kraus (\" Karl Weber \" : Journal of the\nS.P.R., November 1922, p. 133) admitted to her that all his\n\" phenomena \" both at Vienna and at Munich were fraudulent.\nThis admission was however made after the Paris Congress, she\nsays, not before.\n\" The Psychology of Exposure \" is discussed and commented on\nby Prof. Walter, of Graz. \" A young Englishman named Vinton\n\"\nis criticised very sharply (cf. Psyche, April 1927). Prof. Walter, it\nshould be remembered, is one of the staunchest upholders of the\ngenuineness of Frau Silbert's phenomena.\nA stenographic report on the recent Insterburg trial (Frau\nGiinther-Geffers) may, we are told, be obtained from Frl. Baader,\nUhlandstrasse 182-3, Berlin-Charlottenburg ;\nprice 30 marks (\u00a31 10s).\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, July 1928. Genera] Peter of\nMunich reproduces from Luce e Omhra of August and September,\n1927, an account by Signor Ernesto Bozzano of Physical Pheno-\nmena occurring in the castle of Marchese C.S. at Millesimo, Italy.\nThe phenomena consist of telekinesis, direct voices, apports, etc.\nThe editor of the Zeitschrift himself observes in a footnote that\nsince the seances in question take place in the dark, an adequate\ncontrol of the four mediums present is hardly attainable. With\nwhich observation we thoroughly agree.^ A description of a\n1 See Studienrat Lambert's very sensible comments on Signor Bozzano's\ncredulity in the present instance in the same number of the Zeitschrift\n(reviews), p. 472. .\n'\n\f340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nseance for Physical Phenomena is then quoted from a recently\npublished work of General von Bernhardi's. The General seems to\nhave been thoroughly satisfied of their genuineness. We are no\nless justified in doubting it.\nDr. Harms, of Oldenburg, has an article on the new psycho-\nmetric medium, Frau Lotte Plaat.^ An article from an Oldenburg\npaper describing a seance of Frau Plaat's is reproduced and\ncriticised ; still Herr Harms is of opinion that Frau Plaat very\nprobably possesses \" paranormal \" faculties.\nFraulein G. Walther, Phil.D., of Munich, criticises Dr. Walter\nPrince's \" alleged \" exposure of Rudi Schneider. The negative\nresult of the Stuttgart sittings is attributed (p. 407) to Dr. Prince's\nmental attitude distrust and suspicion \") and to the medium's\n\" illness.\" Fraulein Walther also insists that the conditions under\nwhich she observed phenomena with the same medium in Munich\nwere entirely different from the Stuttgart conditions. (The author\nis, we believe, Dr. v. Schrenck's \"scientific\" secretary.)\nDr. Richard Winterberg, who was Frau Giinther-Gefiers' counsel\nat the Insterburg trial,^ has a valuable article on this cause\ncelebre. (I may mention incidentally that the Insterburg Ober-\nstaatsanwalt has lodged an appeal against the sentence of acquittal,\nso that we may before long hear of another trial and\u2014Jet us\nhope\u2014a third acquittal.)\nAn article by Dr. Johannes Bauer, professor of Semitic philology\nat Halle, is then reproduced from a Munich paper. Dr. Bauer\nthinks it firmly established that Theresa Neumann did speak\nAramaic ; the time has not come yet, he thinks, for interpreting\nthis fact definitely.^\nIn \" Kleine Mitteilungen \" Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing makes\nmention of a letter sent him recently by Mme. Bisson in which\nshe told him that she was prevented from attending the Paris\nCongress (end of September 1927) by the consequences of a motor-\ncar accident. It must be admitted that this explanation of Mme.\nB.'s absence comes somewhat surprisingly late.\nZeitschrifl fur Parapsychologie, August 1928. Dr. Simsa of Prague,\na specialist for nervous diseases, describes the spontaneous Physical\nPhenomena observed by him at Prague and at Nikolsburg (see\niCf. June Journal, S.P.R., p. 297. ^ Cf. July Journal, S.P.R., p. 306.\n3 See also below, p. 342.\n\fOcTOBEn, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 341\nS.P.E. Journal, March 1928). The \" mediums \" are stated to have\nbeen two in number, an aunt and a niece, aged respectively\nthirty-two and fourteen, though I suspect that we are entitled\nto put at least occasionally into the same category a third person,\nsuch as the maid-servant, who is described as sharing on the\n20th-21st of October, 1927, the niece's bed in the kitchen, whilst\nvarious phenomena occur. Of these, it may be said in general\nthat they are as abundant as they are inconclusive ; there are\nhardly any exceptions to this inconclusiveness (for one apparent\nexception, see p. 459.)\nDr. W. Neumann of Baden-Baden has a paper on \" the so-called\nthinking animals,\" with special reference to the dog Rolf of Mann-\nheim. His conclusions are entirely unfavourable to ^oor Rolf's\nclaims (of which the latter may be entirely innocent !) and cast\na rather lurid light on the part played by the owners (the Mokel\nfamily), though\u2014rather illogically, I think\u2014Dr. N. attempts to\nexonerate the latter from conscious trickery.\nDr. Rudolf Tischner, of Munich, discusses in his usual moderate,\nsensible and attractive way Dr. Pagenstecher's recent work, The\nMysteries of Psychometry and Clairvoyance. I note his remark\n(p. 491) that he is now inclined to attach more importance to\ntelepathy as a possible factor in psychometric experiments than\nbefore.\nHerr Gustav Zeller comments with sympathy and admiration on\nProf Hans Driesch's new book, Die Sittliche Tat.\nHerr Otto Seeling narrates and discusses briefly the exposure\nof the miner Diebel, who professed to duplicate Theresa Neumann's\nstigmatisation in the Berlin Wintergarten and kindred places.\nA dream which may have been of supernormal origin is narrated\nby Prof. Kasnacich of Graz as having occurred to his wife (pre-\nmonition of death).\nA case of apparent thought-transference at a considerable\ndistance between native Moslems in what was once the Novibazar\nsandjak (now in Yugoslavia) is related by a Herr Emil Teeliger.\nReference is made to an article published in No. 5 of the\nReclams Unirersum for 1927 where a certain Fr. von Gagern de-\nscribes a stigmatica living near Laibach (Ljubljana in Yugoslavia).\nThe phenomena, which are stated to include stigmatisation, levita-\ntions, and apparent teleplasma, are said to be attested by a local\npriest.\n\f842 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nZeitschrift fur Psychische Forschmg, June 1928. A first instal-\nment of Dr. Walther Kroner's report to the Insterburg tribunal\nin the Giinther-Gefiers trial (where Dr. W. K. was one of the\nexperts) is printed. It contains hardly any facts, being chiefly\npolemical (against Drs. Moll and Hellwig) and of a theoretical\ncharacter. The two learned gentlemen mentioned above are said\nto play the same part as medieval inquisitors in heretics' and\nwitches' trials, and there are other amenities. Telepathy, both at\nclose quarters and remote, and clairvoyance (under the latter term\nthe author understands knowledge of things and events not con-\ntained in any human minds) are spoken of as undoubted facts\n;\nclairvoyance is however stated to be extremely rare.\nDr. Mattiesen brings to a close his exhaustive analysis of the\nWhite case.\nDr. Biscaborn joins issue with a statement in Dr. Signer's short\npaper on Konnersreuth in a recent issue of Zeitschrift fi'ir Psy-\nchische Forschmg, in which doubt was cast on the stigmatica\nhaving spoken Aramaic. A list of Aramaic words said to have\nbeen pronounced by her in the presence of Prof Wutz or Prof.\nBauer is quoted.\nThree cases of alleged prophecies are then narrated ; the two\nfirst are attested by the late Prof. Haraldur Nielsson, of Iceland\n;\nthe third has been communicated to Prof. Christoph Schroder by a\nHerr E. and a Prau H. In the first case a certain Thorlakur 0.\nJohnson had in June 1908 an abnormal experience (partly auditory)\nannouncing that King Frederick VIII. of Denmark would die in\n1912. The prediction came true. In 1912 the same gentleman\nhad, we are told, again a premonition that a great war would\nsoon break out in Europe in which Germany would be defeated.\nThere seems no reasonable doubt that in both cases the premoni-\ntions were told to several other persons before the fulfilment.\nIn the third and last case a widower is \" told \" by his deceased\nwife who visits him at night that he will die soon. As a matter\nof fact, he is killed soon afterwards in a motor accident, all the\nother passengers being unhurt.\nIn May 1914, that is before the Sarajevo murder, a certain M. B.\ntold a lady in my presence in St. Petersburg that \" the European\nwar would break out in June or July.\" There was no seance and\nB. is no medium and no clairvoyant. I may add that by the\nRussian calendar the war broke out on July 20th. This incident\n\fOCTOBKK, 1928 Notes 071 Periodicals 343\nshows us, I think, that chance coincidence, occasionally coupled\nperhaps with some sagacity, may bring about results at least just\nas striking as the episodes narrated by Prof. Nielsson and Prof.\nSchroder.\nZeitschrift fur PsycMsche Forschung, July 1928.\nDr. E. Mattiesen discusses the \" internal breathing \" of mystics.\nIn this connection such names are mentioned as those of Ch. J.\nPinney, Granade, Evan Roberts, Thomas Lake Harris, Edward\nMaitland and many others. Of course there seems to be nothing\nevidential in these experiences, however curious some of them\nmay have been.\nFrom the first instalment of a paper by Prof. Dr. Christoph\nSchroder, to which we shall return when finished, we learn incident-\nally that his challenge {Journal, S.P.R., June 1928, p. 297) has so\nfar remained unanswered.\nA second instalment of Dr. Walther Kroner's report on the\nInsterburg trial (see July Journal) is printed. Hitherto the only\nconcrete case mentioned seems to be the Kaschnicki case, where a\ndead body was found in a lake in the position (head downwards\nand hat on head) and on the spot indicated by the clairvoyante.\nStatistics are given by Dr. Kroner, whose very minuteness is likely\nto arouse some suspicion ; thus out of 308 data given by Frau\nGiinther-Geffers 221 are attributed by the writer to telepathy\nfrom those present, 69 to telepathy from absent persons, and 18\nto clairvoyance. Dr. Kroner believes that 50 per cent, of the\ninformation given by the clairvoyante was correct. But of course\nsuch statistics must be accepted cum grano salis at the very least.\nIncidentally, Dr. K. mentions that the S.P.R. has registered 120,000\nspontaneous cases (apparently of phantasms of the dying !) We\nhope the learned judges (Dr. Kroner was one of the experts at\nthe trial) were duly impressed !\nProf. Dr. Schroder prints a very interesting account of Physical\nPhenomena (raps, a bang, lights) coupled with prediction of death.\nNo person is specified, but an aunt of the narrator's (Fraulein T.)\ndies ten days later. One of the lights having been grasped by\nFrl. T.'s mother, the latter experiences a violent shock ; the next\nmorning the hand is much swollen and there is on it a dark\nbrown spot. The case is more than eight years old. Trickery\nseems to be out of the question, but of course everything depends\non the personality of the witnesses\u2014as to which we know nothing.\n\f344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Ootobee, 1928\nSiiddeutsche Monatshefte, October 1927 (Munich). This very well-\nknown monthly has a special number almost entirely devoted to\n\" Occultism and Spiritism.\" We note in it articles by Prof. Hans\nDriesch (\" Facts and Theories of Parapsychology \"), Dr. R. Tisch-\nner, Dr. R. Baerwald, Herr R. Lambert, Count Klinckowstroem\nand Herr Arthur Hiibsher (\" Occultism and Poetry \"). It is very\nsatisfactory to have in Messrs. Klinckowstroem and Lambert\neloquent exponents of\u2014respectively\u2014the contra and the pro in\nthe domain of Physical Phenomena, both positions being in my\nopinion almost equally defensible. On the whole this number\naffords excellent reading and can be recommended very heartily.\nUnsere Welt, July 1928 (Bielefeld). Count Klinckowstroem has\na short but trenchant article on the Bisson\u2014Eva C. case, dealing\nespecially with Professor Richet's letter in the May Zeitschrift fur\nParapsychologie (see July Journal). The Count thinks the letter\nunconvincing and maintains that Dr. Osty must have at his\ndisposal unpublished evidence bearing on the part played by\nMme. Bisson. I may be permitted\u2014without entering into details\n\u2014\nalso to express the wish that the matter be cleared up. The gist\nof Count K.'s letter seems to me to lie in the following lines :\n\" Osty as Director of an Institut Metapsychique, founded and sub-\nsidised by Jean Meyer, a spiritist, is in a dependent position and\nhas yielded. This is, humanly speaking, comprehensible. It is to\nbe regretted only from the stand-point of free scientific research\n\"\n(p. 216). Such a statement should not, in my opinion, be ignored\nby Dr. Osty but answered by concrete facts.\nRevue Spirite Beige, April, May, June, 1928. M. Thiebault,\npresident of the Mantes-sur-Seine spiritistic circle, brings k) a\nclose his account of the wonders at Mme. Alexandre's and solemnly\ncomments on them, quoting inter alia two Roman Catholic eccles-\niastical pronouncements at ten years' distance (1917-1927), the first\nbeing hostile to spiritism, the second friendly to \" metapsychics.\"\nMeanwhile an unexpected event has thrown additional and wel-\ncome light on the Mantes materialisations : M. Charles Quartier\nof the Paris Metapsychical Institute and a journalist friend (from\nthe Paris Journal) have exposed the fraud and detected the\nmedium (Blaise, a gardener) in playing the part of the mater-\nialised spirit Madeleine. The most characteristic feature of the\nincident seems to me the very brutal way in which the two\nexposers were handled by the believing members of the cenacle.\n\fOctober, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 345\nRevue Spirite Beige, July 1928. As was to be expected various\npersons protest against the Mantes exposure. M. Thomme, president\nof the Reims Spiritistic Union, M. Thiebault, president of the Mantes\nspiritistic circle, M. Melusson, vice-president of the Union spirite\nFrancaise. The latter in an open letter to M. Masson (one of the\nexposers) mentions a case where the \" materialised apparition\n\"\nhad a pair of lace-up boots on (brodequins) exactly similar to\nthose of the medium : \"I touched all the four boots at once with\nmy two hands.\" To M. Melusson this is a proof that a mater-\nialised spirit may also, occasionally, have materialised boots on\n;\nto me this incident, coupled with some others, is evidence that the\ngardener Blaise must have had accomplices, which fact may pos-\nsibly compel us to view the part played by Mme. Alexandre in\na somewhat new light. It is time I think to reconcile ourselves\nto the idea that with some spiritists\u2014as is most undoubtedly the\ncase with some religious fanatics\u2014intense conviction may well go\nhand in hand with connivance at deception if not direct deception.\nRevue Metapsychique, May-June 1928. M. de Vesme brings to a\nclose his exhaustive examination of the Indian rope-trick, begin-\nning with Marco Polo, Ibn Batuta (thirteenth century) and the\nEmperor Jahagueir (seventeenth century) and ending with some\nmore or less contemporary accounts. His conclusions are entirely\nnegative. In some cases, as for instance in his analysis of the\nEmperor Jahagueir's account (where he suggests an ingenious use\nof mirrors by Indian conjurers), I think his criticisms deserve\nconsideration ; in other instances I have the impression M. de\nVesme sometimes gets rid of the evidence in a somewhat ofi-hand\nfashion : so perhaps in the Edwin Goodell case and in the CO.\nSen case (March-April number, pp. 137-138, 140). The collective\nhallucination hypothesis he rejects. By the way, it can hardly\nhave had its origin in the narrative printed in 1890 in the\nChicago Tribune, since reference is already made to the same legend\n(photographing a fakir's performance) in Messrs. Barrett and\nMyers's review of Mme. Home's D. D. Home, his life and mission,\nprinted in the S.P.R. Journalm 1889.^\n*M. de Vesme mentions a case where the rope-trick was photographed and\nduly registered on the plate by Lieutenant F. W. Holms (p. 221). I may\nmention here that at the end of 190.5 a Russian naval officer told me he had\nbeen present at a fakir performance which was photographed, the plate\nremaining Mwaffected. I do not know, however, what the performance consisted\nof, and was never able to obtain from Captain Bylim Kolosovsky a written\naccount of his experience.\n\f346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\nM. Osty has a paper on the \" Sixth Sense \" a propos of Prof.\nRichet's book under the same name.\nDr. Budolf Reitler, Physician in Chief of the Laboratory of\nResearch on malaria, at Rosh Pinah, Palestine, describes a series\nof experiments tending to indicate an action of the human organ-\nisms (at a distance of 20 centimetres), also of the organisms of some\nreptiles, on preparations of female locusts of the Acrisiidae family\nin salt solution. The writer has obtained some positive results.\nProf. Richet prints two accounts of incidents supposedly super-\nnormal. In the second of these, the sister of a lady personally\nknown to Prof. Richet and living in Czecoslovakia hears in a\ndream a voice telling her that Marshal von Hindenburg has just\nbeen elected President of the German Republic. This monition\ncomes true. Of course, as we all know, the Germans had to\nchoose between Field-Marshal von Hindenburg and Dr. Marx only,\nbut M. Richet attaches some importance to this incident on account\nof the form of the dream being \" quite analogous to that of\nveridical dreams.\"\nIn the Chronique reference is made to the Mantes scandal.\nWe are promised further details. We are also informed of another\nexposure bearing on \" the Vallee seances,\" which seances had been\ngoing on in Paris since the beginning of the century. These\nsittings (at which various physical phenomena occurred) were by\nthe way gratuitous.\nWe are also told in the same Chronique that an important\nindustrial association of Italy whose name is given as Association\nfour les eaux potables d'ltalie, having become convinced that\ndowsing is a genuine faculty, have now several dowsers in their\ntechnical personnel. These rhabdomanciens selected from among\nthe most gifted candidates, give \"the most satisfactory results.\"\nP. P. S.\nPsychic Research, May 1928. This number opens with a first\ninstalment of Dr. Richardson's report on \" Experiments in Thought\nTransference (from the Margery Case).\" The experiments which\nbegan by an attempt to prove \" post-hypnotic influencing of\nMargery by Walter,\" developed later by the co-operation of\nvarious other persons, including the well-known medium George\nValiantine, into experiments in cross-correspondences of a type\nnot unlike the cross-correspondences between automatists published\nin the Society's Proceedings. Comment, which, if it was to serve\n\fI\nOctober, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 347\nany useful purpose, would exceed the usual limits of these notes,\nis at present deferred.\nProfessor Christian Winther brings to a close his report on\nexperiments in telekinesis with Anna Rasmussen. We hope later\nto review these experiments as a whole. The number includes a\nreport by Dr. Osty on the \" painter-mediums,\" Marjan Gruzewski\nand Augustin Lesage. More detailed reports on their phenomena\nhave already appeared in the Revue Metajpsychique and have been\ncommented on by Count Solovovo (cf. Jour. S.P.R., May 1928,\np. 265, July 1928, p. 310).\nM. Sudre has an article on \" More about Human Radiations,\"\nin which he discusses some experiments carried out by M. E. K.\nMueller, Director of the Salus Institute for electromagnetic treat-\nment of nervous disorders. M. Sudre describes the general\ncharacter of M. Mueller's experiments and compares some of his\nobserved results with an experiment made by M. Courtier with\nEusapia Palladino and with some of Ochorowicz's experiments\nwith Stanislawa T.\nMr. H. C. Wright has an article on \" The Phases of Mental\nAction.\" His article is mainly theoretical, but he gives an account\nof various personal experiences which are not without interest,\nalthough, as published here, they lack corroboration.\nPsychic Research, June 1928. This number opens with a first\ninstalment of a report by Geoffrey C. H. Burns, M.D., on \" A\nCase of Apparent Obsession and its Treatment on the Assumption\nthat the Obsessing Entities were to be taken at their Face Values.\"\nThe physician who treated the case was Dr. Titus Bull. We\npropose to give some account of this report later.\nM. Rene Sudre has an article on \" The Reality of Parapsychical\nPhenomena,\" in which he refers to the case of Eusapia Palladino\nand states that \" the experiments made at the General Psycho-\nlogical Institute in 1905 and 1909 stand in my judgment as an\nunassailable verification of telergy.\"\nAn article by Mrs. F. E. Leaning on \" The Indian Control\n\"\nincludes an account of some spiritualistic phenomena as observed\namongst North American Indians 300 years ago. The accounts are\nbased on the reports of Jesuit missionaries. The evidence for\nanything in the way of veridical phenomena appears to be scanty.\nThere is a second instalment of Dr. Richardson's \" Experiments\nin Thought Transference,\" and Mr. Harry Price gives specifications\n\f348 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1928\n(illustrated) for a specially constructed \" seance table for the study\nof telekinesis.\"\nAn interesting article on \" St. Augustine's attitude to Psychic\nPhenomena \" is reprinted from the Hibbert Journal, October 1926.\nPsychic Science, July 1928. This number is mainly occupied\nby reports on the Margery mediumship. The articles include a\ngeneral history of the case, \" Experiments in Thought Trans-\nference,\" by Dr. Richardson, \" Some Critical Aspects of the Margery\nMediumship,\" by Dr. Crandon (an address given at the British\nCollege of Psychic Science, December 8th, 1927). Dr. Crandon\ngives an account of various communications received by Margery\nin automatic writing. The \"Experiments in Thought Transference\"\ninclude a report on the writing by Margery of a large number of\nChinese characters (reproduced).\nThere is a short article by Mrs. McKenzie on \" '\nPatience Worth\n'\nand her Medium.\"\nNature, August 18, 1928. This number contains an article by\nDr. R. J. Tillyard, F.R.S., on \" Evidence of Survival of a Human\nPersonality.\" The evidence was obtained at sittings with Margery\nand the \" surviving personality \" is her control, Walter. The\nreport is divided into two parts : (1)\n\" Supernormal Cognition of\nUnknown Objects,\" and (2)\n\" Supernormal Production of Thumb-\nprints.\" The evidence is of much the same general type as has\nalready been reported in Psychic Research and elsewhere.\nIn the same number Dr. Tillyard's article is discussed and criticised\nin an interesting editorial article. Dr. Tillyard's article, we are told,\nwas printed in response to his plea \" for a wider and more generous\noutlook on the part of science towards psychical research.\" On this\nground at any rate all psychical researchers will find themselves in\nagreement with Dr. Tillyard and will welcome the response which\nthe Editor of Nature has made to his plea.

The apparition was seen by one\npercipient only, and beyond the fact that the figure seems\nto have borne some general resemblance to members of the\nfamily in whose possession the house has been for a long\ntime, there does not appear to have been anything veridical\nin the experience. Nevertheless, the incident is of a suffi- I\nciently unusual character to be worth putting on record. The\nj\ncase has been investigated by the Rev. W. S. Irving, a 1\nMember of the Society, and Mr. F. J. Summers, whose report \\\nis printed below.\nEnquiry into the alleged seeing of an apparition at Briery Hill,\nNewent, on, or about. Wed., April Wth, 1928.\nOn June 6th, 1928, Captain T. C. B. Hooke, of Briery Hill, i\nNewent, told me [W. S. Irving] that his House-keeper had recently |\nseen an apparition. On June 7th, 1928, I called at Briery Hill, '\\\naccompanied by Mr. F. J. Summers, and saw the House-keeper,\nMrs. Ind, who kindly gave me the following particulars as to\nwhat she saw : On an evening in April, which was afterwards\ncalculated by Captain Hooke to have been the evening of Wed.,\nApril 11th, 1928, Captain Hooke being out, Mrs. Ind went into\nhis sitting-room, about 9.0 p.m., to light the lamp. The room\nis rather a small one, about 13 feet by 13 ; and there is a large\ndining-room table to the left front against the wall. On entering\nthe room, Mrs. Ind placed the candle, which she was carrying,\non a small side table, on the right as you enter the room, and\nwas crossing to the dining-room table to light the lamp which\nwas on that table, when she saw the figure of a man, kneeling\nj\non the floor, in front of the table, with his head down as though\nhe was inspecting something on the floor. The figure had his\nback turned to her. He was dressed in a stone-grey tunic,\n|\nrather long and which hung full at the sides. It appeared to j\nbe fluted. He had knee-breeches, and coarse-ribbed stockings, \\\nboth of stone grey colour. On his head was a skull cap, and\nhe had long grey hair which lay on his shoulders, and turned\nup at the ends. The figure appeared to be solid, and Mrs. Ind\n\fNovember, 1928 Case 353\ncould not see Captain Hooke's slippers through him, though he\nwas kneeling over them. While Mrs. Ind watched, the figure\nslowly got up, and, still keeping his back to Mrs. Ind, walked\na few steps towards the left front corner of the room. He then\nlooked round at Mrs. Ind over his right shoulder, showing that\nhe had a grey, bony, face. His expression was worried, and not\npleasant, and he looked keen, and sharp. In height he appeared\nto be about 5 feet 3 inches. After looking round he disappeared\n\u2014faded out. Mrs. Ind described what she had seen to Captain\nHooke directly he got home,^ and Captain Hooke wrote an account\nof it to his wife in Town, at once. Mrs. Ind did not notice the\ntype of collar, or shoes, worn by the apparition, but said, \" I\nnoticed his calves which were very shapely.\" His hands were\nnot visible as they were in front. The exact time is fixed\nbecause Mrs. Ind looked at the sitting-room clock directly after\nthe disappearance of the apparition. It was dark outside, though\nthe shutters were not drawn, but the candle gave sufficient light\nfor the details to be noted. Mrs. Ind thought that the face\nresembled that of a cousin of Mr. Hooke's.\nW. S. Irving.\nF. J. Summers.\nThe above is a correct account of what I saw.\n, .\n, (Mrs.) F. Ind.\nNotes on the above.\nBriery Hill Farm is an old house about 2 miles from Newent.\nJudging by the style of architecture it is not likely to be less\nthan 200 years old. The grounds were, at one time, said to\nbe haunted by a White Lady,\" but the ghost was \" laid\n\"\nmany years ago, by several clergy, apparently successfully. Captain\nHooke is a descendant of the Hookes who have been Landowners\nin the district for centuries. He claims that they have been\nhere since the reign of Henry V. Captain Hooke has rented\nBriery Hill to Mr. and Mrs. Ind, who are farmers, retaining\nrooms for himself when down here, and Mrs. Ind acts as his\nHouse-keeper. Mrs. Ind is an elderly woman, fairly well educated\nfor a small farmer's wife. She told her story to us quietly, and\nwithout excitement, and we credit her with believing that she\n^ It appeared on further enquiry that Mrs. Ind told Captain Hooke of\nher experience on the following morning, April 12, 1928,\n\f354 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Novkmbee, 1928\nsaw what she declares she saw. Once before, twenty years\nago, Mrs. Ind saw what she thought was the ghost of some one\nthat she knew, but she was out of doors at the time, driving,\nand the circumstances were different altogether. In the present\ncase, it is interesting to note that Mrs. Ind has lived in the\nhouse for 14 to 15 years without having had any similar experi-\nence, and that she was carrying out her ordinary, normal duties,\nwhen she had this experience. She tells us that she was not\nfrightened, but felt cold, and clammy. The room is a bright\nroom with a light buff wallpaper. There was no heavy dark\nfurniture calculated to cause shadows ;\nand, although there would\nbe no moon at the time to give light through the window which\nhad not been shuttered, the light from the candle would be\nsufficient to give quite a good light, and to show such details\nas the expression on the face of the apparition. In this case,\nwe are unable to make any suggestion as to normal causes. The\npossibility of Mrs. Ind having been deceived by a reflection of\nherself in a mirror seems to be negatived by the details of the\ncase, and by the statement she has made that she was dressed\nin red, and wearing no hat, at the time. Her story, as told to\nus, does not seem to differ, in the way of exaggeration, from that\noriginally told to Captain Hooke.\nW. S. Irving.\nF. J. Summers.\nIt will be seen that on the plan given opposite, which is a\nplan of the room as seen by Mr. Irving and Mr. Summers,\na leopard-skin rug is marked at the point where the figure\nwas seen. As the leopard-skin was greyish in colour, it was\nthought that this might have given rise to an illusion of a\nfigure dressed in stone grey. The following question was\ntherefore put to Mrs. Ind :\nThe figure was kneeling on a leopard-skin rug which might\nhave looked stone-colour in the little light there was. Did Mrs.\nInd notice a difference between the rug and the apparition ?\nTo this question Mrs. Ind replied thus :\nIt was kneeling on the carpet not the rug. The rug was under\nthe sofa.\n[Signed] F. Ind.\n\fNovember, 1928 Case 355\nThe fact that the leopard-skin rug was not by the table\n(as marked on the plan) at the time of Mrs. Ind's experience\nis confirmed by Captain Hooke in a letter dated June 21st,\n1928.\nPlan of the Room\nSMALL\nDESK\nFI HE PL AC\u00a3\nilk DiSAPPEA REO\nLAKGE\nMAHOGANy\n'=\/GURE\nMEAD \/\nOEjSKl\/^\nL EOPARD SX\/N\nCANDLE\nM'i3 I NO\nSIDEBOARD\no\nTABLE\nP J S\nRoom approx. 13 x 13.

There is a tradition that one of the\nHookes hid family treasures at Boulsdon, one of the farms on\nhis estate, two-thirds of a mile from Briery Hill. It is, however,\npossible that Briery Hill may have been called Boulsdon in those\ndays. This tradition of buried treasure existing has more to\nbe said for it than most similar traditions. The story has been\nhanded down in the Hooke family ever since, and many Hookes\n\u2014including members of the present generation, have tried at\ntimes to find what they believe to be hidden somewhere, but\nit is a pretty hopeless task hunting without any definite clue to\nits whereabouts. Before his death Captain Hooke's father told\nhis son that he hoped that he would have more luck than he\nhad himself in the search.\nW. S. Irving.\nF. J. Summers.\nWhen questioned on this point Captain Hooke wrote :\n2lst June, 1928.\nI do attach some importance to the resemblance of the appari-\ntion to my cousin (who has the Hooke type of face) for it rather\ngoes to prove that the apparition was a Hooke ancestor.\nThe Crookes Estate of which Briery Hill forms part was given\nto my ancestors by Henry V., and many generations of the\nHooke family have lived there.\nT. C. B. Hooke.\nCaptain Hooke, as noted above, wrote an account of Mrs.\nInd's experience to his wife in London immediately after the\nmatter had been related to him. This letter has not been\npreserved, but subsequently Mrs. Hooke made a statement,\nas follows :\n^itli September, 1928.\nIn the month of April my husband Captain T. C. B. Hooke\nwrote me the following letter :\n\" I was out to dinner to-night, and on my return Mrs. Ind\nmet me and said she wished to speak to me alone. She told\nme that at about 9 to 9.30 p.m. she went into my sitting room\nto draw the curtains, etc., and light the lamp ready for my\nreturn. As she turned from the window she had a queer feeling\n\fNovember, 1928 Case 357\nof deadly cold, and looking towards the table she saw a small\nman bending on his knees, his hands groping under the table. He\nlooked up, and on seeing her, got up slowly, and with one hand\non the table he walked towards the fireplace ;\nthere, he turned\nhis head, looking at her over his shoulders and vanished. He was\na very small man, under 5 feet, dressed in long grey coat and\ntight fitting short trousers, long stockings, black shoes.^ His\nhair was white and rather long, also he was clean-shaven.\nI\\Irs. Ind did not seem nervous, but kept on repeating the\nfeeling of cold in the room.\"\nM. HOOKE.\nMr. Irving also made enquiries concerning Mrs. Ind's char-\nacter from Dr. W. L. Johnstone of Newent, who has known her\nfor many years and said that he \" considered Mrs. Ind to\nbe a very sensible, reliable sort of person, and the last person\nin the world to '\nsee '\nthings.\"\nCaptain Hooke was also questioned on this point, and\nwrote thus :\n10th June, 1928.\nWith reference to your enquiry as to Mrs. F. Ind's character,\nI have known her for 15 years, and always found her honest,\nstraightforward, and strictly sober, in fact most reliable. I would\nfurther say that she is level-headed and truthful, with plenty of\ncommon sense.\nT. C. B. HooKE.\nTHE REV.

Arthur Ford has been received from a member\nof the Society who prefers to remain anonymous.]\nA great deal has appeared in the press from time to time\nregarding the mediumship of the Eev.

Mrs. Ind told Mr. Irving and Mr.\nSummers that she did not notice the shoes (see above). She may have noticed\ntheir colour at the time and forgotten it.\n\f358 Jouriuil of Society Jor Psychical Research Novfmber, 1928\nof the first Spiritualist Church in America, and claims to have\nspent six years in the study of psychic matters and to have\nhad sittings with most of the well-known mediums, including\nMrs. Crandon.\nAfter reading in LigJit and other papers articles on his\nwonderful clairai;dient powers I attended a public meeting\nin London in June 1928, at which he was both speaker\nand medium. It seemed rather a strenuous task for one\nevening. The address was not very impressive, but his\ndemonstration of clairaudience given at the close of the\nmeeting, was, if genuine, quite remarkable. Before the\ndemonstration began the chairman explained the difference\nbetween clairaudience and clairvoyance, and asked everyone\nto remain perfectly silent so that Mr. Ford could hear plainly\nwhat the spirits said to him and pass on the messages to\nthose concerned. The audience was given to xmderstand that\nthe medium had no means of knowing who was likely to be\npresent at this particular meeting, and that therefore the\npossibility of confederates was ruled out.\nMr. Ford's method of procedure was as follows :\nMedium. Is Peter Ainsworth in the Hall ?\n(A gentleman raised his hand).\nMed. There is a whole group here for you, your Mother\nMary, your sister Kate, your brothers Robert and\nJohn and your son Ted. Do you recognise them.\nAns. Yes. (This meant of course that only the names\nwere recognised, there was no description given of\nany of the alleged communicators. A clairaudient\nmedium only hears what is said to him and does\nnot claim to see the spirits.)\nMed. They send their love and greetings.\n(Without waiting for any further remarks from the\nman addressed he passed on to another name.)\nMed. I'm hearing the name Annie Johnson, is she present ?\nAns. Yes.\nMed. Your daughter is here, she says her name is Ann. You\nare in trouble, are you not ?\nAns. Yes. ......\nMed. Well, she says go on, all will be well. I give you that.\n\fNovember, 1928 The Rev. Arthur Ford 359\nDuring the evening eight or nine people answered to their\nnames in this way, and recognised other names given to them\nas belonging to relatives or friends who had passed over, and\nmost of them received similar messages of love and greeting.\nApart from the names nothing of a really evidential natm-e\nwas given. In one or two instances Mr. Ford said to the\nmember of the audience whose name had been called, \" Do\nI know you personally ?\n\" or \" Have I ever seen you before ?\n\"\nand each time the answer was in the negative.\nAt the end of the meeting I asked Mr. Ford if he would\ngive me a private sitting. He handed me his card and asked\nme to write to him. I wrote the next day, and he replied\na week later giving me an appointment at the house where\nhe was staying. When writing to him I used my maiden\nname, knowing that it would be very difficult for anyone\nto obtain any information about me rmder this name as it\nis known to very few people in London. As far as I know\nhe had no knowledge of my married name, and I told no one\noutside the family of my proposed sitting with him.\nAt the beginning of the sitting, before going into trance,\nhe explained that the control was an old friend of his, a French\nCanadian named Fletcher, who had passed over some years\nago. He then leant back in his chair, tied a handkerchief\nover his face and appeared to go into deep trance.\nThe sitting lasted exactly 25 minutes, and was very im-\nsatisfactory from an evidential point of view. Fletcher asked\na great many questions, in fact nearly every statement he\nmade was put in the form of a question. He gave several\nnames, only one of which I recognised. This happened to be\n\" Arthur,\" the Christian name of my father and eldest brother,\nboth living. When the medium came out of trance he asked\nme whether Fletcher had given me good evidence, and whether\nI was convinced. I said that it would take more than one\nsitting to convince me, and he laughed and said he was not\nsurprised. It had taken six years of study to make him a\nspiritualist, and he did not expect anyone to be convinced\nby one sitting. We discussed the matter for a short time\nas he seemed anxious to know how much of what Fletcher\nhad told me was correct. Before I left he advised me to\n\f860 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1928\nattend his next public demonstration, and gave me the date,\nsaying that Fletcher would probably give me much better\nevidence there. I promised to do this. His fee for the\n25 minutes was one guinea. .\nIt should be noted that at the end of my private sitting\nFletcher had, with a considerable amount of help from me,\nascertained the following facts : That both my father and\neldest brother were named Arthur ; that they were both on\nthe earth plane ; that my youngest brother was killed during\nthe war ; that a young man I had been engaged to had\npassed over suddenly ;\nmy youngest brother's name and my\nown maiden name .\n(already known to the medium through\nmy letter).\nOn the following Sunday I attended a second public de-\nmonstration, and, as before, the audience were given to under-\nstand that they were all complete strangers to Mr. Ford.\nAfter several names had been called and answered in the *\nusual way, without hesitation or mistake, my own name, that\nis my maiden name, was called. I answered, and the medium >\nproceeded as follows :\nMed. There is a spirit here for you, a brother who passed\nover during the war, he is giving me the name\nArthur, I think he says it is a father or brother on\nthe earth plane. He passed over very suddenly.\nHe sends you greeting and love.\nThis was all the information I received. The medium\ndid not wait for any further corroboration from me after\ndelivering the message but passed quickly on to someone\nelse. I was very disappointed to find that his power was\nin most cases limited to names only and a few rather vague\nmessages. At the two meetings which I attended he did on\none or two occasions give further evidence which was accepted\nas correct, but it was usually a statement that the person\nconcerned was in trouble or required advice on certain private\nmatters, and those, after all, would be fairly safe statements\nto make about most people who attend Spiritualistic services.\nOf course, if one could have been certain that the medium\nand the control had absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of\n\fNovember, 1928 The Rev. Arthur Ford 361\nthe people whose names were called, it would have been a\nvery impressive demonstration. But, after my experience of\nthe private sitting, and knowing also that Mr. Ford\nholds an At Home every Wednesday which is open to any\none who cares to go and see him, I could not help wondering\nwhether some of the other people at the meeting might not\nhave had private sittings and been asked to attend the public\ndemonstration, as I was. When I answered to my name it\nwas naturally taken for granted by the other members of the\naudience that I was a complete stranger to Mr. Ford.\nIt certainly would not be fair to conclude that his medium-\nship is not genuine because on this occasion he gave informa-\ntion in public that his control had obtained in private, but\nsuch a proceeding is bound to rouse suspicion. It would be\nof great interest to know whether any one else has had the\nsame experience or whether I was unfortimate on this occasion.\nAnother thing which caused me to doubt Mr. Ford's\nsincerity was a statement made by him in the course of a\nlecture at Guildford, to the effect that he had had more fun\nand excitement as a Spiritualistic minister in New York\nCity in five years than he ever could have had as an authorised\nclergyman. This seems a curious point of view for a minister\nto take, and does not tend to increase one's confidence in\nhim. Of course, it has nothing to do with his powers as a\nmedium, but it does suggest that his motives for using those\npowers are not of a very high order.\nSince writing this article I have heard that Mr. Ford has\ngiven up his work in England and returned to America.\n'\nON SOME \" CRITICAL \" METHODS.\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nAmong the continental writers whose papers I have to read and\nreport on in my \" Notes on Periodicals \" in the S.P.R. Journal,\nDr. Emil Mattiesen of Rostock-Gehlsdorf, Germany, figures very\nfrequently. He is a convinced spiritist, a very prolific writer and\na wide reader. During nearly the whole of last year (1927) he\nwas publishing in the Hamburg spiritistic monthly, Zeitschrift fiir\n\f362 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Novbmber, 1928\nPsycJiische Forschung, a series of articles on trance phenomena with\na very minute, painstaking and detailed analysis of the contents\nof trance communications. The numbers of the same review from\nMarch to June 1928 also contained an exhaustive analysis of Miss\nNea Walker's book, The Bridge. A case for Survival (\" The White\nCase \").\nI contented myself in my \" Notes \" with very short references\nto Dr. Mattiesen's writings. I then got a letter from Dr. Mattie-\nsen expressing his dissatisfaction with the brevity of my references,\non the ground that the writer had furnished \" by the formal\nanalysis of trance utterances most important and entirely new\ngrounds \" for the spiritistic solution of the problem (as to the\norigin of those utterances.)\nIn answer to this challenge, I have decided to devote a short\npaper to Dr. Mattiesen's critical methods, the more so as this\nquestion seems to me to transgress the limits of the personal\nincident and to have a bearing on the infinitely more important\nproblem of the \" canons of evidence \" in Psychical Research (to\nuse an expression of the late Professor Henry Sidgwick's).\nContrary, I think, to most writers who have dealt with the\nsubject. Dr. Mattiesen pays no special attention to the contents\nof the trance messages, for, as he casually observes, given medium-\nistic \" omniscience \" we shall hardly be able ever to prove that\nthe messages have an external origin. It is in the form of these\nmessages\u2014their internal characteristics, the apparent independence\nof the trance personalities from each other, their critical attitude\ntowards each other, the apparent incomprehension by the \" con-\ntrol \" of what the communicator wants to say, the apparent\nplurality of autonomous personalities speaking through the entranced\nmedium\u2014that the author sees evidence of the spiritistic origin of\nthe communications.\nDr. Mattiesen's arguments seem to me open to two grave\nobjections. First of all they presuppose throughout the medium's\nbona fides. Now I have no wish to impute bad faith to people\na tort et d travers. I am quite willing to admit that a profes-\nsional medium may be perfectly honest. But it is one thing for\nA. to say point-blank that B. is a fraud, and another to suggest\nthat B.'s statements cannot be always accepted as gospel truth ;\nthat a certain caution with regard to them is entirely legitimate.\nThere can be no doubt that we (I mean psychical researchers)\n\fNovember, 1928 On Some ''Critical\" Methods 3G3\nshall refuse to accept evidence for telekinesis or ectoplasm if based\non the testimony of the medium producing the supposed pheno-\nmena. But is not transmission of messages to and from the\ndeparted much more contradictory of our everyday experience\nthan either ectoplasm or telekinesis ? The departed may exist,\nthey may be communicated with, but this has to be proved. We\nare therefore perfectly justified in saying to a person claiming to\nact as intermediary between the dead and the living :\n\" You may\nvery conceivably tell the truth. But this truth has to be demon-\nstrated.\"\nIt has been objected to me that a hundred years ago the idea\nof people being heard when speaking across the Atlantic may well\nhave been called preposterous ; and yet this idea has come true.\nTo this I answer that if transatlantic telephony had been advo-\ncated on the ground of such \" wholesale nonsense \" ^ as is furnished\nby automatic writing and trance speaking in thousands of experi-\nments, we should have been justified in remaining perfectly sceptical\nas to its possibility.\nTo return for a moment to telekinesis : every group of such\nexperiments (if worthy of the name) must be judged on its own\nmerits ;\nsuch is at least my opinion. It follows that if a tele-\nkinetic medium has been detected in fraud in a seance of the a\ngroup, groups h and c may remain entirely unaffected. Why ?\nPartly for the reason that the telekinetic medium's good faith\nplayed no part whatever in the sittings. But supposing a trance\nmedium be convicted of deceiving, of \" getting up \" his or her\nfacts, what then ? Obviously the whole fabric will tumble down\nwith the exception of those cases only where adequate precautions\nhad been taken against fraud.\nI wiU mention an incident out of my own experience. Some\nseven years ago I made a long series of experiments in what I\nwill call automatic clairvoyance (saucer and alphabet) with a\nRussian young lady in Finland and in Berlin. I have now little\ndoubt that she attempted to cheat me repeatedly if not syste-\nmatically. Had I relied all the time on her bonafides alone, I should\nhave to cast overboard the whole of the experiments. As a\nmatter of fact, at the very first sitting there occurred an incident\n^This expression is Prof. Richet's : Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxxiv., p. 110.\nQuod licet Jovi non licet bovi : by quoting this sentence I do not necessarily\nimply that I entirely agree with M. Richet's castigation.\n\f864 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1928\nwhich has preserved for me all its evidential cogency up to the\npresent day. This incident (the reading of the number of a page\nin a book opened at random under excellent conditions) remains\nentirely unaffected by all subsequent developments unfavourable\nto \" Nadia Y.\" ^\nOn the other hand let us turn to another incident in my\nexperience: the group of the \" Mainoff \" messages. ^ In these\nmessages we had what I considered, and am inclined to consider\nstill, excellent evidence of cryptomnesia. In particular \" Mainoff,\"\nin answer to a request for an identity test, wrote that he had\nattended Paul Broca's lectures. Neither M. Kasnakoff (\" C\")\nnor I (there were no other sitters) had any knowledge of this fact,\nbut I subsequently ascertained that it was mentioned in an\nobituary notice published in the biggest St. Petersburg newspaper\nimmediately after the Russian ethnologist's death in February\n1888. This notice may therefore have caught M. Kasnakoff's\neye or my own or both at the time, this impression remaining\nburied in our minds for upwards of twelve years up to the moment\nof the seance. I have not the slightest reason for suspecting\nM. Kasnakoff's lona fides; and yet I doubt whether in the present\nstate of our researches such an incident may be regarded as\nscientifically evidential. If I am inclined to adopt such a stand-\npoint in a case like M. Kasnakoff's, the more so in a case where\nthe medium is a professional one and interested in his or her\nmediumistic reputation being maintained. (This and not the ques-\ntion of remuneration seems to me to be the chief point at issue.)\nThis side of the problem is completely ignored by Dr. Mattiesen,\nwho, with the greatest care, analyses the trance-utterances of\nvarious professional trance-mediums but assumes throughout the\ngenuineness of these utterances.\nAmong the trance-mediums repeatedly mentioned by Dr.\nMattiesen (in fact he derives from her sittings some of his most\u2014\nto him\u2014valuable facts) is Mrs. Thompson. This shows how\nutterly precarious the whole ground is and how arbitrary the\nselections made. For the late Dr. Hodgson did not believe in\niCf. Zeitschrift fur Kritischen Okkullisyrm is .\nBand I., Heft 2, pp. 81-99.\n^Journal S.P.R., vol. x, p. 70, and Zeitschrift fur Kritischen Okhultismus,\nBand III., Heft 2, p. 123. It should be noted that so far as I can\nremember Broca's Christian name was not mentioned in the obituary notice,\nthough, of course, I might have learnt it from another source.\n\fNovember, 1928 On Some \"Critical\" Metliods 365\nMrs. Thompson's genuineness.^ Now this does not necessarily\nmean that he was altogether right. I am told that he had but\nsix seances with Mrs. Thompson who in the opinion of other\ninvestigators gave on several occasions evidence of supernormal\nknowledge and therefore cannot be said to have been altogether\ndiscredited with the S.P.R. So far so good. Still the fact\nremains that an investigator whom Dr. Mattiesen constantly\nquotes expresses, in a paper which Dr. M. has most undoubtedly\nread, grave doubts\u2014whether rightly or wrongly\u2014as to a trance\nmedium whom the German critic mentions over and over again.\nAnd yet these suspicions are passed over altogether in silence by\nDr. Mattiesen !\nThe following instance will show to what assumptions we are\ndriven at times by Dr. Mattiesen's analyses. Mrs. White dies on\nJuly 12th, 1924. On September 12th, that is exactly three\nmonths later, Miss Nea Walker has a sitting with Mrs. Leonard,\nwhich sitting is the first after the death. Dr. Mattiesen assumes\nwithout further ado that \" Feda \" \" naturally \" ^ knew nothing of\nthe death, and after an exhaustive discussion of the incidents of\nthe sitting based on so strange an assumption, observes that\nanother instance more conclusive of the spirit hypothesis could\nhardly have been quoted. Poor hypothesis indeed if unsupported\nby better evidence !\nThis extraordinary assumption of ignorance reminds one of such\na case as Mr. John Hart (George Pelham's friend) dying at Naples\non May 2nd, 1895, and of Dr. Hodgson having a seance with\nMrs. Piper on May 4th. At this sitting \" John Hart \" com-\nmunicates and speaks of his death ; but in order to attribute to\nthis message a supernormal origin we must assume that a notice\nof his demise which appeared the day before in a Boston paper\nhas remained unknown to Mrs. Piper.^ I am quite ready to\nbelieve that this may have been so, but nevertheless is it not\nobvious that the incident is perfectly worthless, scientifically\nspeaking ?\nI will quote but one more instance illustrative of Dr. Mattie-\nsen's methods. He is speaking of cases where the \" communi-\ncators \" are misunderstood in an \" acoustic-phonetic \" sense by the\n\"Proc. S.P.R., vol. xvii, pp. 138-162.\n^ Zeitschn'ft fur Psychische Forschung, June 1928, p. 182.\n^ Proc. S.P.R. , vol. xiii, pp. 353-357.\n\f366 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1928\ncontrols, in which circumstance he sees one of the many types of\nevidence of the independent existence of the trance-personalities.\nReference is made to a Piper sitting of February 15th, 1897,\nwhere \" Rector \" communicates and says he has been sent by\n\" Imperator \" \" to meet a man called Hogman.\" Dr. Hodgson\nsays his name is Hodgson. \" Rector \" apologises and gives to\nunderstand that he meant \" Hodgson.\" ^ To convinced spiritists\nsuch an incident may prove conclusive. To a psychical researcher\nof even moderately critical views it will appear of doubtful cogency.\nFor where is the proof that we have not to deal here with \" a\npiece of refined comedy \"\n\u2014an explanation Dr. Mattiesen himself\nsuggests but discards.\nThere is another aspect of Dr. Mattiesen's treatment of the\nsubject which is equally calculated to deprive his work of scientific\nvalue. Science is no plaidoyer. In a scientific treatise we must\nhave before us the pro and the contra. There is nothing of this\nsort in Dr. Mattiesen's analysis. He brings forth all the mastery\nof his dialectics to prove his theses\u2014and that is all. The opposite\nside is ignored. We read nothing^ of all the fishing, guessing, of\nall the discrepancies, contradictions, absurdities, etc., which abound\nin the records of trance-j^henomena, of \" spirits \" forgetting their\nown names and other particulars of which they could not be\nignorant if they were the personalities they pretended to be.\nA series of articles (November 1927-February 1928) is indeed\nentitled :\n\" Difficulties in trance-phenomena as a spiritistic argu-\nment,\" but these schwierigkeiten have nothing to do with the\nshortcomings of the trance-personalities. They deal with the\ndifficulties supposed to be encountered by them in manipulating\nthe medium's organism. Needless to add that in that most\nsuspicious circumstance, the avoiding of names. Dr. Mattiesen sees\nnothing suspicious at all and in fact dwells on it but very little.\nBut I may be permitted here a short digression.\nI am under the impression that this avoidance of names is of\nrather recent origin and must have coincided with the moment\nwhen names began to be particularly insisted on by obnoxious\nresearchers as \" tests.\" That sooner or later a quasi-\" scientific\n\"\nZeitschrift fur Psychische Forschung, June 1927, p. 175; Proc.

For Stainton\nMoses's \" controls \" simply pelted him at times with Christian\nnames, surnames, and dates (also disliked as a general rule), and in\nmy own experience in automatic writing (with friends) I have\nconstantly been submerged by names. These seem therefore to be\neluded chiefly when used as \" tests.\"\nTo return to Dr. Mattiesen : he is acquainted with Mrs. Sidg-\nwick's admirable paper in Vol. XV. of Proceedings (and in fact\nspeaks of her in the words of the highest praise). It is therefore\nthe more to be regretted that he completely ignores that part of\nthe paper in which she so forcibly brings forward those points\nwhich tell against the spirit hypothesis. Of it Dr. Mattiesen's\nreaders will know nothing. They will know nothing of Miss\nHannah Wild's \" spirit \" dictating to her sister (still \" in the\nflesh \") the contents of a sealed letter, which, when opened,\ncontains nothing of the kind. Dr. Wiltse communicates and\ninforms the sister that he is dead and that his body is in the\nwater. He subsequently proves to be alive and well.^ In 1895 a\ncertain Mr. M. communicates (also through Mrs. Piper), and Miss\nEdmunds, Dr. Hodgson's secretary, has two sittings on behalf of\nthe widow. The \" spirit \" is asked for his name, unknown both to\nmedium and sitter ; at first it is given correctly, but Miss E.\nhaving expressed some doubt, another\u2014and an incorrect one\u2014is\nwritten, and subsequently this error is persisted in.^ \" Eector,\"\n\" Imperator,\" etc., give through the Boston medium as having\nbeen theirs a string of names having nothing in common with\nthose given through Stainton Moses.

But it is a good, a typical instance\nof the other, the negative side of the problem, a side which\nDr. Mattiesen has comj^letely ignored.\nIt seems to me therefore that I have justified my position to-\nwards Dr. Mattiesen's writings in my \" Notes on Periodicals.\"\nFor these writings have but the appearance of science ;\nthey are\nin fact nothing of the kind, though I willingly admit that they\nhave other qualities which make them conspicuous in contemporary\nspiritistic literature. Now, in my criticisms in the domain of\nPsychical Research I strive to the best of my knowledge after a\nscientific standard, and it was for that reason that I attached little\nimportance to Dr. Mattiesen's argumentation. His challenge has\ncompelled me to modify my attitude, and I am much obliged to\nhim for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion on a\nquestion which seems to me by no means without general interest.\nNOTE ON AN EARLY EXPOSURE OF GUZIK.\nThe attention of psychical researchers of Western Europe having\nbeen called since some five or six years to the Polish medium\nJan Guzik, the following facts may be of interest. In 1904-1905\nI published a Russian translation of Mr. Podmore's Modern\nSfiritualism. To this I added a \" Supplement \" in two parts,\nthe second comprising a series of \" Sketches \" from the history\nof Spiritism in Russia. Among those sketches there was one\ndevoted to the late Sambor and Guzik. Accidentally it so happens\nthat I have now a copy of this \" Supplement \" in my possession,\nthough I left in Russia the whole of my excellent library. From\nthe pages of the \" Supplement \" dealing with Guzik it follows\nthat his name was mentioned for the first time in the Russian\nepiritistic press (Rebus) in 1898. I quote there two accounts of\n1 Proc. S.P.R., vol. xiii., p. 334.\n^ See Mrs. Sidgwick's paper in Proc. S.P.R., vol. xv.\n\fNovEMBEE, 1928 Note on an Early Exposure of Guzih 369\nseances with Guzik (1899 and 1902) and analyse them. I note\nthat his phenomena consist chiefly of \" touches,\" sometimes\nvery rough ones, and movements of chairs and tables along the\nfloor ; that movements of objects ajDparently produced by hands\nare mentioned more seldom ; that G.'s hands are by no means\nalways held in the strict sense of the word, and that the (very\nrare) accounts of visible forms appearing are eminently apt to\nmislead persons not having taken part in the sitting. I then\ndwell on the utterly inadequate character of the control consisting\nof luminous paint being applied to the objects to be (\" tele-\nkinetically '\") moved, instead of the medium's limbs, and call\nattention to the importance of the position of the latter's feet,\nwhich circumstance, I say, is generally passed over in silence.\nI insist on the unsatisfactory character of the control of feet by\nfeet, an instructive instance being quoted from my own experience\n(with G.). Two cases are then quoted by me from the Rebus\n(1899) where the identity of the \" mysterious organ or being,\"\ntouching the medium's neighbours, with G.'s own foot was proved\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt. Reference is then made to my\nown experiments with the Polish medium in the winter of 1901-\n1902 (in St. Petersburg), where the fixing of luminous stripes of\ncalico to the medium's trousers entirely stopped the phenomena.\nThe whole tone of my remarks is thoroughly ironical and sceptical,\nwhich is the more significant as at the time (1905) I was not by\nany means an out-and-out sceptic as to Physical Phenomena.\nSeveral years later I again exposed Guzik in at least one\narticle in the Rebus. So far as I can remember, I argued there\nthat G. will avail himself at his seances of any methods which\nare to him accessible. If inadequately held his hands will be\nused. If the hand-control is satisfactory, he will use his feet.\nIf the control is thoroughly good, he will give a blank sitting\n(an undoubted privilege a medium has over a conjurer). That\noccasionally G. will use his hand I knew already at the time\nby experience : at a sitting held in the beginning of 1910, the\nnotorious Chamberlain X. \" controlling \" G. on one side, the medium\nwas caught by the hand which X. had liberated (as to this\ngentleman see Proc. S.P.R., Vol. xxv, pp. 434-37, Journal S.P.R.,\nVol. xxi, p. 201, and Zeitschrift fiir Kritischen Okkultismus, II. Band,\n4 Heft, pp. 249-258).\nFrom the outset, however, my impression was that G.'s feet\n\f370 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 192S\nwere chiefly instrumental in originating the phenomena. In this\nhe undoubtedly upholds the tradition of Modern Spiritualism. The\nmedium's lower extremities were, I suspect, very active from the\nbeginning of the movement,^ and Frau Silbert's are, I believe,\nup to the present day (cf. Dr. Walter F. Prince's Experiments with\nPhysical Mediums in Europe, p. 79).\nThe chief point about Guzik is, I believe, this : not only\nare his \" manifestations \" most suspicious, but they are of very\nlittle interest. Other fraudulent mediums have at least pro-\npounded riddles to the researcher, have puzzled people, have had\na certain mysterious nimbus surrounding them. About this\nPolish ex-workman there is nothing of the kind. His phenomena\nhave been exposed over and over again : they cease altogether as\nsoon as adequate precautions against cheating are taken ; in the\nvast majority of cases what occurs can be explained without any\ndifficulty. There is no mystery about Guzik at all ; or rather\nthere is only one mystery : that he should have been able to\nenlist the interest of very distinguished representatives of the\nworld of Science. That is puzzling indeed !\nP.-P.-S.\nNote.\u2014Guzik has died since the above was written.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\n17 RoTHERwiCK Road,\nLondon, N.W. 11, 22,rd October, 1928.\nDear Madam,\u2014In the Notice of the Extraordinary General\nMeeting circulated by the Council in June 1928 there occurs a\n^ The late A. N. Aksakoff more than once told me that the raps I used to\nproduce by striking the floor with the toes of my left foot (cf. Jour. S.P.R.\n,\nvol. vi, pp. 120-22) were closely similar to those he had heard with\nKate Fox-Jencken. In Robert Dale Owen's Debatable Land the facsimile\nis given of a piece of \" direct \" writing obtained under the table with\nMrs. Underbill (the eldest of the Fox sisters) : that it was made by the\nfeet (or one foot) is obvious. That D. D. Home in at least one celebrated\ninstance used his foot to simulate the grasp of a spirit-hand and was caught\nin flagrante seems very probable. That he went on availing himself of the\nsame method later is also probable, and is repeatedly suggested by some\nof the incidents occurring at his sittings.\n\fNovember, 1928 Correspondence 371\nstatement that \" Mr. Grondahl has requested that his name be\nwithdrawn \" from the list of signatories.\nI am not aware of having at any time expressed the wish\nthat my name should be withdrawn, although I agreed with the\nsignatories that, since a Committee had been appointed to consider\nalterations in the Articles of Association, a postponement of the\nExtraordinary General Meeting was desirable. This postponement\nimplied that the requisition was not at the time being made, a\nfact brought out clearly at the Meeting itself when it was\nannounced that the Proposers of the Resolutions did not intend\nto move any of them until the Committee had reported.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. C. Grondahl.\n[We gladly give Mr. Grondahl this opportunity of explaining\nhis position. Any further comment seems superfluous.\n\u2014\nEd.]\nREVIEW.\nDie Prohleme der Einheit und der Spaltung des Ich. By T. K.\nOesterreich. Stuttgart, W. Kohlhammer, 1928. Pp. viii, 39.\nProf. Oesterreich tells us that his pamphlet on the unity and\ndissociation of the self is the first of a series of j^ublications on\nphilosophy and psychology which is to include the dissertations\nof his pupils, and that it represents the substance of papers\nread by him to the International Congress of Psychology at\nGroningen in 1926 and to the Paris Congress of Psychical Research\nin 1927. In the course of his discussions Prof. Oesterreich makes\na number of bold and interesting suggestions, such as that the\n\" dissociations \" may be creative changes in the real (p. 32), that\na truly radical empiricism must regard the selfhood of the psychic\nas evolved (p. 33), and that the counterpart to the dissociation\nof a mind is its fusion with another (higher or lower), and that\nof this process also empirical evidence may be found (pp. 28-9).\nHe also explains, very candidly, why he still prefers the \" animist\n\"\nexplanation of psychical phenomena to the \" spiritist,\" while\nadmitting the latter's superior simphcity. The belief in demonology\nand witchcraft did so much harm in the past that an academic\npersonage should be very careful before saying anything that\ncould be taken as an endorsement of spiritism (p. 25). True,\n\f372 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1928\ndoubtless, but what a light it throws on the element of humbug\nin academic life, for all its professions of a \" disinterested \"'\nsearch\nfor truth ! I agree with Prof. Oesterreich also in looking to\npsychical research for instruction as to the nature and constitution\nof the self or soul. The efforts of philosophy to deal with this\nproblem have so far resulted only in dismal and almost un-\nmitigated failure.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nWe have received two more pamphlets in the same series\n:\nDie psychologischen Grundlagen der Yogapraxis, by Eichard Rosel,\nand Ein Vergleich der Buddhistischen Versenkung mit den jesuitischen\nExerzitien, by Karl Schumacher.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fur Psychische Forschung, August 1928.\nDr. Mattiesen brings to a close his study of the \" internal\nbreathing \" of the mystics. No evidential facts are mentioned.\nDr. Walther Kroner's report on the Insterburg clairvoyance\ncase, in a further instalment, deals this time with three concrete\nepisodes : the Kudlig murder case, the Kaluza murder case\nand the Kaschnicki case. As presented these incidents seem\ncertainly very remarkable ; but one would like to know what the\nother side would say. In the Kaschnicki episode there seems\nto be no reasonable doubt that the dead body was in fact found\nin a lake at a spot pointed out by Frau Giinther-Geffers, or quite\nclose to it ; still Dr. Kroner admits that the case has not been\ncompletely cleared up. A very striking feature of Frau G.-Gr.'s\nbehaviour (in a trance-state) in connection with the \" clairvoyant\n\"\ndiscovery of crimes committed is its close similarity to the\nbehaviour of police dogs when on the track of a criminal and\nof other sensitives in such instances as those mentioned in the\nJournal, Nov. 1927, p. 145. (However, vide infra.)\nA case of alleged prophecy to a Fraulein K. is related and\ncommented upon at length by Prof. Dr. Christoph Schroder. To\nme it seems obvious that the explanation is due to a fortuitous\ncoincidence.\nProf. Max Selling prints an account of some supernormal\nexperiences by Baroness Anna von Peyron, a Swedish lady who\n\fXOTEMBEB, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 373\ndied in 1898 and who was personally acquainted with jVIrs.\nd'Esperance, the well-known medium : the latter has sent Hofrat\nSelling the MS. containing the account. The experiences of\na spontaneous character narrated are impressive. The Baroness\nalso claims to have recognised her deceased son at a materialisa-\ntion seance of j\\Irs. d'Esperance's. Such recognitions have always\nseemed to me rather ]Duzzling ;\nstill, as I said elsewhere, we have\nhere a psychological not a metapsychical riddle.\nProf. Dr. Christoph Schroder prints with lengthy comments\nselections from results obtained in the course of 68 seances\nAvith six different sensitives partly hypnotised, chiefly a certain\nHerr Max Rautenberg. The experiments described consisted\nmainly in the identification of plaving cards and visiting cards\non which the sensitive had been made (through suggestion) to see\na hallucinatory portrait or coin. The conditions seem to have\nbeen quite satisfactory so far as the exclusion of ordinary channels\nof perception was concerned, and the results of some sittings\nexceed enormously what chance could have produced. Strangely\nenough, however, no data are given in this respect as to the\nwhole series of experiments, and this leaves the critical reader\nsomewhat perplexed ; but possibly this gap will be fiUed up\nlater on.\nZeitschrift fiir ParapsycJiologie, September 1928.\nDr. von Schrenck-Xotzing has a paper on spontaneous Physical\nPhenomena (\" Spuk \"), with general considerations. A series of\ncases is reviewed beginning with the Ylojarvi case of 188-5. The\nwriter thinks we are much more backward in the study of these\nphenomena than in that of any other branch of \" Parapsychology.\"\nAn incident said to have occurred at a recent stance of Rudi\nSchneiders (p. 517), where the medium, it is alleged, became\naware of a sitter's first sceptical then friendly attitude, though\nnot expressed in words, has reminded me of an episode happening\nat one of Sambor's sittings in 1902. At a certain moment he\n( in trance \") asked me to sit next to him, after which a \" chair-\nthreading \" experiment which was proceeding succeeded brilliantly\n(on the other side of the medium). I was very anxious to see\nit succeed and Sambor knew it.\nDr. Romer of Leipzig has a paper on the religious convictions\n(said to be very intense) of a female medium of Hermannstadt\n\f374 Journal of Society for Psychical JResectrc^ Novembee, 1928\n(Transylvania, Rumania), and Dr. Otto Seeling, of Berlin, dis-\ncusses the recent evidence for the alleged clairvoyance of a Frau\nHessel (Leipzig), which evidence does not seem to him altogether\nadequate.\nHerr Florizel von Reuter relates briefly a series of striking\nepisodes (names given) connected with his mother's automatic\nwritings. Dr. Walter F. Prince is mentioned as a sitter. My\nonly comment will be : let Frau von R.'s alleged mediumship\nbe, if possible, scientifically investigated at once ; we must\nobviously suspend our judgment until this has been done.\nA brilliant lecture of Prof. Driesch's on \" Life-Death-Immorta-\nlity \" is reproduced verbatim.\nFrau M. Silbert, of Graz, is the subject of a polemic between\nProf. Seitz, of Munich (sceptic), and Prof. Walter, of Graz (ardent\nbeliever).\nDr. R. Tischner, of Munich, has an interesting paper on Dr.\nPaul Gibier's very old (1886) experiments with Henry Slade, and\nthinks the phenomena observed by the author of Le Spiritisme ou\nFakirisme Occidental may well have been authentic. It should\nbe noted in this connection\u2014a fact very little known\u2014that in\n1878, that is either immediately after or during the Zollner series\nof experiments, Slade entirely^ failed to convince M. AksakofE\nof the genuineness of at least his most striking phenomena. The\nlatter even arrived at the conclusion that the true medium\nin the Leipzig experiments was not Slade but Prof. Zollner,\nthe former being endowed with some \" catalytic \" power favourably\nreacting on Zollner's mediumistic faculties. As for the St. Peters-\nburg experiments, they produced in M. Aksakoff a feeling of\nprofound disappointment. No detailed account of them was\never published because M. Aksakofi, as he told me, wished to\nspare Slade's reputation after the prestige brought him by the\nLeipzig stances ! Of course, all this has but an indirect bearing\non both the Zollner and the Gibier sittings ; still it is of con-\nsiderable if not of decisive importance for appraising the Slade\nperformances at their true value.\nFrom a note on Therese Neumann in Kleine Mitteilungen we\nlearn that the phenomena have reappeared, and that she was\nvisited lately by several high ecclesiastical dignitaries ; from which\nit follows that the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church in\n1 Barring some relatively minor incidents.\n\fNOVEMBEE, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 2,1b\nthis question appears to have become decidedly favourable to\ntie seeress. P.-P.-S.\nThe British Journal for Psychical Research, July-August, 1928.\nThe Number opens with a report of a lecture given by Mr.\n^ E. Fothergill on \" The Curse of Tut-Ankh-Amen.\" The lecturer\nwith some cautious reservations is inclined to the belief that\nLord Carnarvon's death was in some sense a result of the ^-iolation\nof Tut-Ankh-Amen's tomb, and quotes, as offering some analogy,\nthe well-known incidents supposed to be connected with a\nmummy-case at the British Museum. No evidence is given\nwhich is likely to shake an unbeliever, and the Editor himself\nsuggests in a note on the lecture that in such cases we have to do\nwith a coincidence rather than a curse.\nMr. F. von Renter contributes an account of a sitting with\nEudi Schneider at Braunau. x4.ll that need be said here is that\nincluding the medium ten persons were present at the sitting, of\nwhom five were members of the Schneider family, a circumstance\nwhich\u2014however satisfactory the conditions may have been in other\nI respects\u2014almost completely destroys the scientific value of the\nevidence.\nJ\\lrs.

The incident, which occurred in Indiana in 1927,\nis interesting, but a much more detailed statement is required\nif the reader is to form any judgment as to what the evidence\nfor supernormal knowledge amounts to.\nPsychic Research, July 1928.\nThe Number opens with an article by Mr. Harry Price on\n^ \" Some Personal Experiences with j\\Irs. Anna Rasmussen.\" We\npropose to discuss Mrs. Easmussen's mediumship in a later issue.\nMonsieur Rene Sudre in an article entitled \" The Role of the\nForgotten in Psychical Research,\" discusses the experiments in\ntelepathy carried out by the Polish psychologist Abramowski.\nThe particular form of experiment devised by Abramowski is\nbased upon his conception of the close analogy existing between\nthe emergence into consciousness of a telepathic impression and\n\f376 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1928\nthe recovery of a memory, the chief difference consisting in the\nfact that the first comes originally from without, the second\nfrom within. One of Abramowski's experiments was to repeat\nto a large number of percipients three chosen words (an example\ngiven by M. Sudre is owl, moon, cross), and then to endeavour\nby mental concentration to induce them to name a particular\none of the three words. In the example given the success\nobtained seems to have been decidedly above chance, namely\n63 per cent. In some other cases in which a different kind\nof word was used, e.g. three proper names, the success obtained\nwas not above chance.^\nAn article by Dr. R. J. Tillyard on \" The Normal Production\nof Psychic Gloves \" is reproduced with abridgments from the\nBritish Journal of Psychical Research, Jan.-Feb. 1928. This article\nhas already been noticed (Joiir. S.P.R., Vol. XXIV. p. 295). Mrs.\nLeaning has an article on \" The Survival of Animals \" in which\nshe discusses a number of cases of apparitions or phantoms of\nanimals, many of which were reported originally in the Society's\nJournal. Mrs. Leaning's point of view is indicated in the following\nquotations :\nMy proposition is that within the limits inherent in the\nsubject the evidence for animal survival matches point for\npoint with the human. It corresponds so closely that if\nwe invalidate the one, we invalidate the other. . . . Consider-\ning that we cannot fix the limit where our own sub-human\nancestors may have developed a surviving principle, or even\n- just where the animal kingdom as a whole, shades off into the\nvegetable, we may excuse ourselves from an attempt to map\nthese dim borderlands of nature.\nThere are further instalments of Dr. Burns's \" A Case of\nApparent Obsession\" and Dr. Mark Richardson's \" Experime nts\nin Thought-Transference\" (the Margery Case).

Percy Wyndham of\nClouds, Wiltshire. A devoted mother, and a powerful friend\nto the distressed and sorrowful, she was the author of books\nabout peaceful village life, and a special lover of birds and\nanimals. She had a keen sense of beauty, an appreciation of\nall human relationships, and was adored by her family and\nneighbours. Of her eldest son killed in the war she wrote a\nmemoir entitled Echmrd Wy^idham Tennant by Pamela Glen-\nconner (John Lane) in which, as well as in a subsequent still\nmore personal volume The Earthern Vessel, she gave many\ntouching details of family life. In the memoir are included\nmany of her son's poems, one in facsimile which he wrote for\nher at the age of five ; and in an appendix is added a self-\nrevealing poem by herself, entitled Hester, which constitutes a\npermanent and beautiful representation of maternal feeling at\nthe coming and going of a late and longed-for child.\nLife for her was vivid, its cessation unthinkable ;\nneverthe-\nless she welcomed evidence for survival, and, through many\nchannels, evidence of a striking character was vouchsafed to\nher. The family shared her interest and respected her enthu-\nsiasm ; a kind of sober joy in her reunion with those she had\nlost, mingled with a sense of irretrievable loss for those left\n\fDecembkh, 1928 Obituary 379\nbehind, dominated tlie funeral service at Wilsford. Flowers in\nprofusion, friends in every rank of life, and an absence of\ngloom, were the prevalent features.

A Telepathic Dream.\nWe print below a report of dream of apparently telepathic\norigin, the dreamer being Mr. Dudley F. Walker, of 18 Shep-\nherd's Hill, Stoughton, near Guildford. The dream occurred\nlate on the night of Wednesday, June 27th, 1928, at about\nthe time of the railway disaster near DarUngton, and a short\naccount of it appeared in the Daily Mail of July 2nd. The\nRev. A. T. Fryer, an Honorary Associate of the Society, there-\nupon wrote to Mr. Walker, asking for further particulars, as\nfollows :\nJuly 2, 1928.\nIn the Daily Mail of this date there is an account of your\ndream of the Darlington railway accident last week.

I also inclose a full account of the\nletter I sent to the press, but which was only published in full\nby the local paper (the Daily Mail cutting some out).\nI also enclose signed statements from the persons to whom I\ntold my dream, my mother receiving the fullest account, while\nI had it fresh in my mind.\nThis is a perfectly genuine experience, and I am quite willing\nto relate personally my experience to anyone who cares to call\nand see me.\nI might mention it has made a deep impression on my mind,\nand although I have never given serious thought to this subject,\nI am now perfectly convinced that this was no ordinary dream.\nIt was so remarkably true to life that it seemed more like a\nvision of events taking place, than the average dream.\nEveryone seems firmly of the opinion that I actually witnessed\nthe tragedy at the time it happened, in some other form than\nmy physical body. I must confess that during the dream, at\nthe time the two trains met, I had an awful feeling of horror,\nand that it was my fault ; due to the fact no doubt, that I was\nunder the impression that I Avas the signalman who let the train\nthrough. I clearly did see the red signal light change to green\nas the train approached. In view of the strange evidence of\nthe signalman at the enquiry, it is all the more remarkable, for\nit would appear that, he too, had a feeling that something was\nwrong due to a clicking noise. I am certain this was no ordinary\naccident, and have felt considerable upset since. The main\nquestion which has puzzled me is : Why should I, out of all\nthe millions in England asleep at that time, be picked out to\nwitness this ghastly sight. There appears no answer to this.\nI shall be pleased to assist you further in any way I can.\nYours faithfully,\nDudley F. Walker.\n\fDecember, 1928 Case 381\nReplies to Me. Fryer's Questions.\nQuestion (1).\nWritten and signed evidence of persons to whom dream M^as\ntold before the news was known, are enclosed.\nQuestion (2). Have you ever had a similar dream ?\nNo. Never of an event which has actually taken place.\nQuestion (3). Do you hnoiv Darlington or persons living there ?\nNo. Have never been anywhere near this part. I know no-one\nliving there at all to my knowledge.\nQuestion (4). Was there an account of the dream written directly\nafter it happened ?\nNo ; not an account, until the news was known that there\nhad been an accident ; but there was a personal entry made\nin my diary directly after the dream, and also a small, rough\npencil sketch made showing how the two trains met, and the\nperspective at which I witnessed the collision (from above).\nThe first full written account was made immediately I saw how\nclosely my dream resembled the accident. This was sent at once\nto the Daily Mail and the local paper.\nQuestion (5). Have you had any experience of railway management?\nNo, nothing whatever. I have always taken a keen interest\nin our railways, and particular the Great Western, mainly due\nto the fact that I have travelled several long distance journeys on\nit. I have always admired our English railways, and they have\n.always had my sympathy and appreciation of their splendid\nefficiency. I enjoy travelling on long distance trains.\nQuestion (6). Had anything happened in your daily vocation the\nday before the dream to make you think of railway affairs ?\nNo\u2014nothing at all. I did not think, or read, or discuss\nanything to do with railway matters for at least three days\nbefore the dream. I have travelled by road for months past\nnow, and only have travelled by train twice since this time\nlast year. That being to London and back once in March\n(March 8th, 1928). In July 1927 I went to West Cornwall and\nback, for three weeks' holiday. I go there next week again.\nAll the above answers are true to the best of my knowledge\nand belief.\nDudley F. Walker.\nJuly 1928.\n\f382 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decembeu, 1028\nWith these statements by Mr. Walker was enclosed the\nfollowing account of his dream as sent to the Surrey Advertiser\non Thursday, June 28th, 1928 : .\n,\nI write this letter with extremely mixed feelings. I have just\nread in to-night's evening papers details of the terrible train\nsmash at Darlington.\nJudge my emotion when I tell you that I actually dreamed\nof the whole of this disaster, substantially accurate in all details,\nlast night, at approximately the same time it happened (between\n11 and 12 p.m.). So impressed was I with the dream that\nwhen I came down this morning I told my mother that had I\nbeen leaving immediately for a railway journey I should not have\ntravelled, as it seemed like a premonition. Little did I imagine\nit had actually taken place.\nI then related the details to my mother, for they were as clear,\nand true to life as a cinema film.\nThere were the significant features of my dream (omitting\ndetails) :\nI was in an overhead signal box, extending over a railway\nline 1 had never seen before. It was night, and I saw approach-\ning what I knew was an excursion train, full of people, returning\nfrom some big function. I knew it was my duty to signal this\ntrain through, which I did, but at the same time I had a feeling\nthat the train was doomed. (I have nothing to do with railway\nwork.)\nIn my dream I seemed to hover in the air, and follow the\nexpress, as it slowed to round a loop line. As it approached\na station I saw, to my horror, another small train on the same\nline. Although they seemed both travelling slowly, they met\nwith terrible impact. I saw the express and its coaches pitch\nand twist in the air, and the noise was terrible. Afterwards,\nI walked beside the wreckage in the dim light of dawn, vieAving\nwith a feeling of terror the huge overturned engine and smashed\ncoaches, I was now amid an indescribable scene of horror, with\ndead and injured people, and rescue workers everywhere.\nMost of the bodies lying by the side of the track were those\nof women and girls. As I passed with some unknown person\nleading me I saw one man's body in a ghastly state, lifted out\nand laid on the side of an overturned coach.\n\fDecembkk, 1928 Case '\n383\nI\n\u2014 \\\nI distinctly heard a doctor say :\n\" Poor chap, he's dead.\" Some\nother voice said : \"I believe I saw his eyelids move.\" Then\nthe doctor said :\n\" It is only your nerves ; he has been dead\nsome time.\"\nI was quite upset on getting up, and felt too unwell to eat\nany breakfast. All day at business I have been thinking about\nthis dream.\nOn coming home, you can imagine my feelings when I beheld\nthe placards ! I bought all the papers I could get and rushed\nhome with the news. In the whole of my life I have never\nhad, nor ever heard of anyone else having, such a realistic pre-\nmonition of what actually took place at the time it was dreamed ;\nand told to witnesses before any knowledge of the disaster was\nknown. I write, as my strange experience may be of interest\nto the general public. Can anyone explain this ?\nMr. Walker also enclosed the following statements from\npersons to whom he related his dream before he knew of its\nverification :\n18 Shepherd's Hill, Stoughton,\nNe. Guildfoed, July 2nd, 1928.\nI, the undersigned, hereby certify that my son Dudley F.\nWalker, of 18 Shepherds Hill, Stoughton, Nr. Guildford, Surrey,\nrelated to me early on the morning of Thursday, 28th June, 1928,\na full and vividly detailed account of a dream he had that\nnight experienced, in which he witnessed a railway accident which\naccurately resembled the subsequent description of the Darlington\ntrain smash which occurred about the same time as his dream.\nHe told me this long before it was known there had been an\naccident, and it was not until he returned that night with the\nevening papers that I knew an accident had taken place. The\naccount in the papers closely followed all the main details of\nhis dream as related to me. Maey Walkee.\nJuly ith, 1928.\nI, the undersigned, hereby certify that on the morning of\nThursday, 28th June, 1928, my Mother related to me details\nof a dream which my brother Dudley F. Walker had experienced,\nabout a serious railway accident previous to any knowledge by\neither of us about the train smash which had that same night\ntaken place at DarUngton. Elsie Mary Walkee.\n\f384 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1928\nI, the undersigned, hereby certify that Mr. Dudley F. Walker\ndid relate to me a full and detailed account of the dream which\nhe had exj^erienced prior to any announcement appearing in the\npress. From his description the dream appeared to closely\nresemble the actual train smash at Darlington, and as a respon-\nsible person in the company employing Mr. Walker, I can give\nevery assurance that he has made no attempt whatever to prevari-\ncate in the matter.\nli. A. Etherington,\nManaging Director,\nWalker Bros. (Guildford) Ltd.\nSubsequently Mr. Fryer wrote again to Mr. Walker, as\nfollows :\nJuly lOth, 1928.\nThe Secretary of the Psychical Research Society would like\nto know how you came to be aware of the exact time when\nyou had the dream of the accident. Sometimes people who have\nsuch a dream wake almost immediately and make a note of the\ntime. Others become aware of the dream when they wake at\nthe usual time of rising and then they make some memorandum\nof the experience. From your report the latter seems to have\nbeen what happened and if such a memorandum was made we\nshould like to have a copy of it. We should therefore be obliged\nif you will tell us (1) how you were able to fix the time you\nhad the dream ; (2) at what time you woke on this occasion,\nwhether it was the usual time or earher or later ; (3) whether\naccidents by rail or car had formed the subject of conversation\nwith your friends before you retired to rest, or had you read\nany story (magazine or novel) in which accidents in the course\nof travelling were described. The last question is important\nbecause our dreams are often mental, unconscious, constructions\nor re-arrangements of materials supplied by events or topics of\nconversation of the day before the dream. Sleeping or waking,\nour minds are constantly at work. Our questions are based\nupon what we have learnt of mental processes in the course of\nour inquiries. I shall be very grateful for a reply.\nYours faithfully,\nA. T. Fryer.\n\fDecember, 1928 Case 385\nTo this letter Mr. Walker replied as follows :\nJuly 21st, 1928.\nRegarding time of dream. This I am afraid I was only able\nto estimate in the following manner. The dream was divided\ninto two distinct sections, that is, the collision itself which I\nappeared to commence dreaming about soon after I fell to sleep,\nat about 10.0 to 10.30. I only partly awoke after this, and\ndid not remember much except that I felt very frightened and\nthat it was still dark. There was then a gap of time and it was\napparently much later that I dreamt about again being in the\nsignal box after having attended some sort of official inquiry\nin which I saw a number of men seated down each side of a\nlong table. I appeared to have returned to my post in the\nsignal box and remembering the smash I was in great trepidation\nin letting further trains through. I was still worrying over this\nwhen I awoke at about 7.30.\nI immediately came down and told my mother all I have\ntold you, only in greater detail, who later told my sister whilst\nI was dressing.\nI made no written account as of course I saw no sense in so\ndoing at the time, as this is the first dream of its kind I had\never had. On getting to business I made a short entry in my\npocket diary which is as follows. \" Thursday June 28th. 1928.\nDreamed of train smash.\" Later, on reading the evening paper\nI entered underneath\n\u2014\" Wrote to Mail and Surrey Advertiser re\ndream.\"\nDudley F. Walker.\nWe print below some extracts from the daily papers, giving\nan account of the disaster.\nThe Northern Echo, Thursday, June 28th, 1928.\nA terrible railway accident occurred just before midnight last\nnight outside Darlington Bank Top Station.\nA Newcastle-Scarborough excursion, returning to Newcastle,\ncollided at about 11.20 with an express goods train for London\nfrom the north. The excursion train was full of trippers.\nIt was learnt at 3.0 this morning that at least eight people\nwere killed and about 30 injured. The eight bodies are those\nof a man, six women, and one little girl. . . ,\n\f386 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1928\nThe trains crashed with great force. Two coaches of the\nexcursion train were telescoped and the engine of one of the\ntrains was completely derailed and lay broadside on to the track.\nThere were distressing scenes. . . . One gruesome sight was that\nof a man's body lying on top of one of the carriages. ...\nThe Daily Mail, Monday, July 2nd, 1928.\nCol. Sir John Pringle opened at Darlington on Saturday the\nMinistry of Transport inquiry into the collision, which was between\na parcels train and an excursion train from Scarborough. . . .\nThomas Walls, in charge of the Darlington South signal box,\nsaid that when he accepted the parcels train the excursion from\nScarborough was offered to him. . . .\nJames Garrett, assistant signalman in the South Junction box,\nestimated the speed of the excursion train at between 30 and\n40 miles an hour.\n\" Before the collision occurred,\" Garrett added, \" my attention\nwas drawn to a clicking sort of noise in the lever frame. I\nrealised there must be something wrong, so I threw the down\nmain signal to danger.\"\nWith regard to the time at which Mr. Walker's dream\noccurred, it will be seen from his letter to Mr. Fryer on\nJuly 21st, 1928, that the dream was divided into two parts,\nof which the first part seems to have occvured about the\ntime of the accident ; the second part of the dream was later\nin the night, certainly after the accident. On 26th November,\n1928, the Hon. Editor wrote a letter to Mr. Walker enclosing\nproof of this report of his experience ; the report as first\ndrafted included a statement, based on a misinterpretation of\nMr. Walker's letter to Mr. Fryer of 21st July, 1928, to the\neffect that \" not much recollection remained in Mr. Walker's\nwaking consciousness \" concerning the first part of his dream.\nIn her letter Mrs. Salter also asked whether Mr. Walker could\ngive some further information as to whether he had ever to\nhis knowledge dreamed of a railway accident before, and\nespecially whether he was subject to anything in the way of\nrecurrent nightmares, as this would obviously diminish the\nforce of the coincidence. To this letter Mr. Walker replied\nas follow^s :\n\fDecember, 1928 Case 387\nNov. 28th, '28.\nI am afraid in my letter of the 21st I did not quite clearly\nexpress myself, as I really meant that during the partial awaking\nduring the night I did not wake up then sufficiently to analyse\nthe details of what I had dreamt {i.e. the actual smash itself),\nbut went to sleep again at once and only remembered the first\npart of the dream properly when I fully awoke at 7.30, and came\ndownstairs.\nIn other words\u2014I partly awoke during the night (after having\ndreamed of the smash) with a feeling of fear over what I had\njust witnessed, but not being sufficiently awake to think it over\nor even to note the time, I fell asleep again to dream of the\nsignal box and letting further trains through in what was then\ndaylight in my dream.\nThis is a little difficult to explain, and I trust I have made\nmyself clear, but it would not be correct to say :\n\u2014\" not much\nrecollection remained in Mr. Walker's waking consciousness,\" as\nthis should only apply to the partial waking consciousness during\nthe night.\nUpon full waking consciousness, the whole thing was as clear\nas life, and it was of course only then that I distinctly remem-\nbered about the gap between the two dreams.\nReplying now to your P.S. asking if I frequently had dreams\nof this kind :\nI can most emphatically assure you that I have never before\ndreamed of either a railway smash or any other kind of violent\naccident, and as a matter of fact have all my life been a very\nrare dreamer. This has been a subject of remark in my family,\nfor I have often passed for months without ever dreaming at all\n\u2014or at any rate never having any remembrance of dreaming after\nwaking. ...\nDudley F. Walker.\nWith this letter Mr. Walker enclosed a page torn from his\ndiary, upon which the original record of his dream was made\n(see above), in the words \"Dreamed of train smash.\" The\ndiary page has the date \"Thursday, June 28, 1928,\" printed\nat the top.\n\f388 Journal of Society for Psychical Researck Deceubek, 1928\nREPORT OF A PSEUDO-SITTING FOR PHYSICAL\nPHENOMENA WITH KARL KRAUS.i\nBy Theodore Besterman.\nKarl Kraus is a young Austrian who for some years claimed\nto have mediuniistic powers. He was studied by Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing, who was, and remains, satisfied that Kraus\nproduced genuinely supernormal phenomena, and who read a\npaper on the subject of his experiments at the Paris Congress\nof 1927. After the reading of this paper, Kraus, having been\ndetected in trickery by a committee of investigation in Vienna,\ndeclared that all the phenomena produced by him were fraudulent.\nIn June 1928, Kraus, being then in London with his em-\nployer (he is a chauffeur), called on me at the Rooms of the\nSociety. The object of his visit was to interest me or the\nSociety in the purchase of the MS. of a book he had written\nabout his mediumistic imposture, and of a controlhng and\nrecording apparatus he had invented for use at mediumistic\nsittings. I may observe in this connection that Kraus was\ntreated throughout with the utmost courtesy and consideration,\nalthough his record as a self-confessed fraud might have\nexcused a somewhat harsher attitude. Kraus, however, did\nnot consider the treatment that he received any reason for\nacting honestly. Indeed, as I discovered later, at least half\nof what he said was either inaccurate or downright untrue.\nThe story of his negotiations in regard to his MS. has not yet\nbeen completely unravelled. In short, Kraus's whole attitude\nand behaviour show him to be very deficient in moral sense,\nto such an extent, indeed, as to make it doubtful whether he\ncan reasonably be held responsible for his actions.\nKraus, in his MS. and to me verbally, made many serious\nallegations against the conditions prevailing during his sittings\nat Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's. I therefore determined to\n1 This report was originally drafted as part of a paper on Kraus. While recentlj'\nin Munich I was informed by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing that he was preparing\nan exhaustive book on this subject. I therefore dropped my paper, and expanded\nthe draft into a report for use by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing. This was trans-\nlated into German by Fraulein Dr. Gerda Walther, and from this German transla-\ntion I have now put together the present report.\n\fDecember, 1928 Pseudo-Sitting for Physical Phenomena 389\ntake advantage of Kraus's presence in London to test these\nassertions, about which. I had previously heard from more\nthan one source. I invited him, with the approval of Dr.\nWooUey, to give a pseudo-sitting in the Society's Seance Room\nimder the same conditions and control as those prevailing at\nhis sittings in Munich. Kraus consented to this, undertaking\nto produce the same phenomena, and received a substantial\nfee for his services.\nIn order to give the pseudo-sitting a greater interest and\nimportance than would have attached to a mere demonstration\nof trickery, it was determined that some of the sitters should be\nleft mider the impression that they were to witness a genuine sitting.\nI attached considerable importance to the impressions they would\nreceive imder these conditions ; the sitters so deceived afterwards\nreadily recognised the value of the experiment. There were there-\nfore present at the sitting the pseudo-medium, Dr. WooUey and\nmyself as controllers, five sitters, of whom three were unaware of the\nreal nature of the performance, and the note-taker (Mrs. Bracken-\nbury).\nPrior to the sitting Kraus asked to be furnished with a common\npaper-clip, which he placed in his waistcoat-pocket. He also\ncomplained because he could not find a table of suitable\nweight and construction, suitable, that is, for lifting with his\nhead and shoulders. He was not, of course, searched, nor\nspecially dressed, merely removing his jacket. The soles of\nhis shoes were painted with a luminous preparation, and he\nput on the usual luminous bands, except those on the ankles,\nwhich he refused. The light during the sitting varied, but\nthe pseudo-phenomena were invariably preceded by a request\nfor darkness. Under these conditions the following pseudo-\nphenomena took place. They can be conveniently divided\ninto two classes, those occurring with Kraus in the cage and\nthose occurring while he was not in the cage.\nI. Phenomena ocmrring with the pseudo-mediu?n in the cage.\nThis cage is of net on a light wooden frame, and was con-\nstructed to contain a small table on which objects were placed\nin sittings for telekinesis. It may be as well to mention, in\nview of various rumours that have been circulated, that this\nis the only cage in the Society's Rooms. Kraus wished to\n\f390 Journal of Society for Psychical Research DscEwmB, 1928\ntake his seat in this cage, just large enough for this purpose,\nand was allowed to do so. The cage has an opening on one\nside, the relevant measurements of which are : 72.4 cm. wide,\n- 82.2 cm. high, 31.7 cm. from the floor to the bottom of the\nopening. Through this space Kraus extended his forearms,\nhis hands being held by Dr. WooUey and myself respectively.\nAbout 70-80 cms. in front of the cage stood a light table on\nwhich were placed the usual luminous objects, bands, pieces of\ncardboard, a trumpet, etc. Almost immediately the lights\nwere reduced to their minimum Kraus, who does not go into\ntrance, announced that he would produce movements of the\ntable. In this he was at once successful, the table being\nviolently overturned. After a brief interval Kraus asked for\nlight, and, as soon as the table had been set up again, for\nrenewed darkness, when he proceeded to produce movements\nof the individual objects on the table. This type of pheno-\nmenon occurred at intervals throughout the sitting. All these\nmovements were thus produced : Kraus agitated his hands\nuntil he had got himself into a position in which he was able\nto project one foot through the opening in the cage. On\nputting on his shoes after their soles had been painted, he\nhad been noticed to tie them very loosely so as to enable him\nto remove one or both without getting his hands out of\ncontrol.\nTowards the end of the sitting Kraus announced that he\nwould produce a different kind of phenomenon, and asked me\nto name a small object in the immediate neighbourhood. After\nthinking of a cigarette-case, but failing to remember the\nGerman for this, I said \" Bleistift \" [pencil]. Almost immediately,\ncertainly within a second, something was heard to fall at the\nother end of the room, the lights were turned up, and a pencil\nfrom the note-taker's table (which was quite out of the pseudo-\nmedium's reach) was found several yards from Kraus's place in\nthe cage. This phenomenon was thus produced : Kraus,\nbefore the formal beginning of the sitting, had taken the\npencil from the note-taker's table, placed it in his upper waist-\ncoat pocket, and, at the psychological moment, he extracted\nand threw it with his mouth.\nII. Phenomena occurring ivith the pseudo-medium out of the\n\f.\n\\\nDecember, 1928 Pseiido-Sitting for Physical Phenomena 391\ncage. These phenomena were all self-levitations. Kraus asked\nto be released from control and to be provided with a large\ncloth. With this he covered himself entirely in order to\n\" concentrate force.\" After a minute or so, in the dark, the\ncloth was thrown away, the control was renewed, and at once\nthe sitters facing Kraus saw the luminous feet of a pair of\nshoes which appeared to be floating in the air. This pheno-\nmenon, with variations into which I need not enter, was\nrepeated several times. It was thus produced : when covered\nwith the cloth Kraus removed one shoe, clipped it with the\n. previously supplied paper-clip to the other shoe, lifted the\nfoot which now bore two shoes, and waved it about.\nThe accidental turning on of a light brought the sitting to\nI a premature end by revealing the fraud. Only one of the\nthree innocent sitters felt able after this to give an honest\naccount of her impressions, and this one confessed that she\ntook the phenomena for genuine, relying on the control and\n^ on the search that she supposed had previously been made of\nEj-aus's person.\nThe following observations are to be made on this pseudo-\nsitting. The first is, that if Kraus is, and was, unable to\nproduce the above described phenomena otherwise than with\nthe conditions he laid down, it is impossible to imagine that\nhe could have deceived us if he had come before us as a\ngenuine medium. The same undoubtedly apphes to most\nserious investigators, and I am not in the least inclined to\nbelieve Kraus's repeated assertions that the conditions pre-\nvailing at our pseudo-sitting were those he worked under with\nBaron von Schrenck-Notzing. For the latter has since shown\nme the signed records, with diagrams, of several sittings in\nwhich certain phenomena were produced, and in which more\nstringent conditions prevailed. Without expressing any opinion\nas to the genuineness of these phenomena, the question of the\ncomparative reliability of contemporary records and of Kraus's\nmemory, even assuming him to be capable and willing to tell\nthe truth, can hardly arise.\nIn a scientifically conducted series of sittings Kraus would\nnot always have been allowed (at first, perhaps, by way of\nencouragement) to refuse luminous bands round his ankles, to\n\f392 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1928\nbe released from control in darkness and to cover himself with\na cloth, and to secrete a paper-clip and a pencil on his person.\nNor would he have been allowed the use of a cage which, not\nhaving been constructed for such a purpose, permitted the\ndescribed use of his leg. And it would soon have been\nnoticed that a given phenomenon only occurred when the\nappropriately favourable conditions were present.\nThe most noteworthy features of the sitting to the controllers,\nwere (1) the dexterity with which Kraus contorted his foot\nout of the cage, and (2) the way in which, in the levitation-\nphenomena, he hopped about on one foot, and then on to a\nchair, without putting any abnormal and suspicious strain on\nthe controlling hands. It is also an interesting illustration of\nthe possibilities of chance-coincidence that, Kraus having\nprepared himself with a pencil, I should have happened to\nname the same object. No doubt, if something else had been\nnamed, the test would have been put off again and again until\nsuccessful. And, if the pencil had not been recognised as\ncoming from the note-taker's table, how promptly it would\nhave been claimed as an apport\n!\nEEVIEWS.\nI. MetJiode und Ergebnisse des Berliner Rundfunkversuchs. By Dr.\nAlexander Herzberg. Offprint from the Zeitschrift fur\nangewandte PsycJioIogie, vol. 31. 1 (1928), pp. 66-106.\nIt is highly gratifying to find that the broadcasting experiment\nin telepathy of last year has already been imitated in Germany\nand that with a great parade of thoroughness and of psycho-\nlogical technicalities. Dr. Herzberg takes 40 pages to describe\nan experiment of which the prototype only required nine, because\nhe thinks it necessary to have an introduction, a chapter on\nmethod, one on Dr. Woolley's experiment, another of criticisms\non it, and four others before he comes to his results, which are\nelaborately illustrated with tables and graphs. Unfortunately\nhe is so taken up with the mechanism of scientific investigation\nthat he fails to satisfy his readers' curiosity about the actual\nresults : his tables all deal with percentages, a procedure for\n\fDecember, 1928 Reviews 393\nwhich one can suggest no reason except that the actual figures\nmay have been somewhat small. For the total number of\nparticipators was only 4563 (of whom 164 were ruled out) and\nhalf of these were sacrificed to a \" control \" experiment in which\nthe agents, Dr. Herzberg and Count von Arco, made no attempts\nat transmission. Nevertheless it would seem that there were\nactually 116 participators who got 2 answers right out of 6, and 11\nwho got 3 right ; in the \" control \" experiment (supposed to be\npurely fortuitous) 4 correct answers were recorded in 2 cases.\nDr. Herzberg finally declares that his inquiry was totally incon-\nclusive, neither proving anything for telepathy nor cogently dis-\nproving it.\nThe meticulous and rather acrid criticism to which he subjects\nDr. Woolley's procedure prompts to the comment that he is\nnot perhaps altogether free from blame for this failure. For as\nhe admits (p. 89) he assumed that any one could function as\nagent, and if this assumption is false and telepathy demands\nco-operation and a certain rapport between agent and percipient,\nnothing positive could result from his experiment.\nBut the most serious flaw in his method arises from his ob-\nsession with the idea of exactness. This leads him to reject\nany experiment which cannot be made \" exact \" and any method\nwhich cannot yield a final solution the first time it is tried, and\nmeans that he adheres to the superstition that a single experiment\ncan be conclusive. He thereby misses the most valuable logical\nlessons of these broadcasting experiments. For they show that\nsuch demands are fantastic and that the logic underlying them\nis false. They show that \u00abo experiments can be exact into which\na psychological factor enters and in which psychological preferences\ncan defeat mathematical probabilities. And since in actual experi-\nmenting there is a psychological factor, they show that mathe-\nmatical exactness is an impossible ideal. The utmost that could\nbe inferred from Dr. Woolley's experiments would be a certain\nprobability that telepathy occurred, and this hypothesis would\nhave to be confirmed by further experiments. Thus if a few,\nsay one in 10,000, of the answers were almost completely right,\nit would be worth while to test their authors further, to see\nwhether their success would continue. If it did, it would become\nmore and more j^robable that telepathy existed, and its rejection\nwould gradually become unreasonable. But there is no absolute\n\f394 Journal of Society for Psychical Besearch December, 1'J2S\nproof in experimental science, and even in mathematics exactness\nremains hypothetical. The moment we ajjply our mathematics\nexactness vanishes, and it becomes a problem how far the real\nwill conform to our calculations.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nII.

The last-named story, which\npurports to have been given to the world by \" Patience Worth \"\nthrough the mediumship of Mrs. Curran (now Mrs. H. Rogers),\nis certainly superior to the Cleophas script from a literary point\nof view, though Miss Cummins has achieved some success as\nnovelist and playwright, while Mrs. Rogers is a relatively un-\neducated woman with no pretence to culture and seemingly\ndevoid of aspirations to authorship of any sort.\nOne is sorry to seem to disparage an effort which has been\nmade in obvious good faith and which must have entailed upon\nthe transcriber a great expenditure of labour and time, however\nremarkable the rapidity with which the text was transmitted.\nBut I find it difficult to persuade myself that there is anything\nhere which affords a guarantee of new light upon the historical\nproblems of the past. It seems regrettable that in their \" critical\nintroduction,\" the anonymous \" editors \" have not thought it\nworth while to enter more fully into the reasons for the favourable\njudgment they have expressed. We are informed that \" The\nverifiable facts of geography, history, terminology and such\nlike, strewn up and down the following pages, have been to a\nconsiderable extent examined by experts and pronounced accurate\nand sound, and some examples will be given later in this Intro-\nduction.\" Not more than two examples, however, are supplied,\nand one of these two amounts only to this that whereas in the\nAuthorised Version of the New Testament the word politarchai\nnowhere occurs, this designation does apj^ear in the script to\ntransliterate the same term which is used in the Greek text of\n\fDecember, 1 928 Reviews 395\nActs xvii. 6. Surely it is not inconceivable that although Miss\nCummins's interests have not been centred in Few Testament\nstudy, she might subconsciously have picked up the information\nthat politarchai was the Greek name for the rulers in question.\nThe other example is a little more to the point. Referring to\np. 161 of the text, the editors note that the word archon is\nemployed to designate the head of the Jewish community in the\nSyrian Antioch, and they point out that this was the correct\nterm, since Augustus in a.d. 11 had substituted it for the previous\ntitle Ethnarch. Assuming the correctness of this statement, the\ncoincidence does not after all appear so very striking. Ardion\nwas the commonest designation for the rulers of a Jewish com-\nmunity throughout the Diaspora, and the editors seem to be\nbuilding upon a very slender basis when they go on to say :\n'\nThe use of the comparatively new title Archon is an example\nof that exact knowledge on the part of the writers which is to be\nfound in many other striking details, only noticeable perhaps to\nthose who are themselves authorities.\" It seems a pity that room\ncould not be found to illustrate these striking details a little\nmore convincingly\u2014the more so that in the publisher's advertise-\nment on the dust-cover of the volume we read :\n\" The internal\nevidence of the genuineness of what purports to be the recon-\nstruction of an old document destroyed during the time of the\nearly Christian persecutions is sufficiently strong to bear the strain\nof the keenest historical criticism.\"\nWhat renders me particularly sceptical regarding such pro-\nnouncements is the fact that I once spent much time in making\nacquaintance with the revelations of Anne Catherine Emmerich.\nThe editors, who refer to this visionary in their Introduction,\nsay that her account of the Passion is \" generally received by\nRoman Catholics as divinely inspired.\" Further, they declare\nthat \" eminent Catholic theologians and divines have examined\nthe work (of Anne Catherine) both as a record of fact and as\nclaiming to be a revelation, and the verdict is that the details,\nwhere they can be tested, are unquestionably correct and the\ninspiration indubitably genuine.\" Now, while it is quite true\nthat some few enthusiasts have claimed for Sister Emmerich an\nextraordinary understanding of the scenes and events of the\nNew Testament and have believed that such knowledge could\nonly have been imparted supernaturally, no Catholic now-a-days\n\f39G Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decemrkr, ih28\nwould dream of saying that the book was \" divinely inspired.\"\nMoreover, the \" editors \" are clearly unaware that what Brentano\npublished in Das bittere Leiden does not cover one-twentieth\npart of the matter which during the best part of four years he\nwas occupied in taking down from the visionary's lips. Most of\nthe German text of his notes has since been printed and we learn\nfrom them many strange things\n\u2014\ne.g. that Jesus Christ during\nHis public life sailed on a missionary tour to Cyprus, and that\nHe undertook a three months' journey eastward, as far as the\nTigris, returning by way of Egypt. The remarkable thing is\nthat Anne Catherine, though an uneducated woman, seems to\nhave possessed, at least intermittently, extraordinary intuitions\nregarding the geographical details, personal and place names,\nprevalent activities and popular customs of the scenes she de-\nscribes ; but it would be impossible to maintain seriously that she\nhad contributed anything reliable to the history of our Lord's\nlife. We are still, I fear, absolutely in the dark as to the sources\nof the information which comes to the surface in automatic\nwriting, trance utterances and similar communications. There is\nin most of these cases a strange mixture of truth and fiction,\nthe fiction predominating, and we can trust nothing as veridical\nuntil we understand more of the processes of subliminal telepathy.\nIn point of interest and verifiable detail Miss Cummins' disclosures\nstrike me as tame in comparison with those of Sister Emmerich.\nThe greater part of the Scripts of Cleophas amounts to no more\nthan a rather laboured expansion, such as any story writer might\ninvent, of the earlier chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.\nNeither has early Christian literature ^Jreserved the faintest allusion\nto any such document as that from which \" the Messenger\n\"\npurports to have derived his facts. Herbert Thurston, S.J.\nIII. Die Hellseherin, Betrachtungen eines ihrer \" geistigen Fi\/hrer\n\"\nzum Insterburger Hellseherprozess. Von Pelz, Kriminalkom-\nmissar a. D., etc. 1928.\nIn this pamphlet Herr Pelz, formerly Kriminalkommissar in\nthe Memel region (now in Lithuania), devotes 133 pages to an\nexposure of Frau Giinther-Geffers, the Konigsberg clairvoyante.\nHis conclusions are entirely unfavourable not only to her supposed\nsupernormal faculties but even to the genuineness of her trance.\n\fDeoember, 1928 Revieivs 397\nThese he bases on his personal experiences as well as on some\nof the e\\'idence produced at the Insterburg trial (see July Journal)\nand on a detailed analysis of Frau G.-G.'s performances in\ngeneral.\nThat his scepticism is in some respects justified I quite agree.\nAnd I would attach in this respect especial importance to two\nprotocols dealing with two different cases and reproducing the\nclairvoyante's statements verbatim (op. cit. pp. 35 and 59) ; also\nto some\u2014not all\u2014general remarks.\nOn the other hand, Herr Pelz's analysis of the Kaschnitzki\n(Kaschnicki) case (see Notes on Periodicals in the October and\nNovember Journal) appears to me inadequate. Apart from this,\nsome of Frau G.-6.'s statements made in connection with this\nepisode seem not even to have been controlled. Without such\nan attempt at verification the analysis is obviously and necessarily\nincomplete. I have also noticed some strainings in Herr Pelz's\nnegative line of argument.\nAgain : surely sceptics wishing\u2014^perhaps quite rightly\u2014to\nweaken the evidence for an allegedly supernormal fact, as in this\ninstance, ought not to contradict each other. This wise rule is\nnot always observed in the present case. Thus, when discussing\none of the two experiments made in the course of the Insterburg\ntrial in May last to test Frau G.-G.'s powers, Dr. Albert Hellwig\nhad asserted in the FranJcfurter Zeitung (see July Journal, p. 306)\nthat it seemed by no means proved that the dairvoyante did\u2014\nas had been alleged in some newspapers\u2014give the name \" von\nEeibnitz \" (the victim of a theft not cleared up at the time).\nBut in his account of the same experiment Herr Pelz says that\nFrau G.-G. wrote a name which was deciphered by those present\nas von Eeibnitz (p. 97). The fact that, as pointed out by\nthe writer, Frau G.-G. may well have known this surname has\nnothing to do with this discrepancy.\nThis circumstance notwithstanding, and the fact that Herr\nPelz's arguments are not invariably unassailable (also his too\nabundant use of big type where it suits him : a httle item not\ncalculated to enhance the impression produced by his little book\non the critical reader), I willingly agree that to a certain extent\nDie Hellseherin deals another blow to the Konigsberg lady's prestige.\nStill, in spite of all the suspicious circumstances carefully picked\nup by the ex-Kriminalkommissar, the whole matter may stiU be\n\f398 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1928\nconsidered, I think, as being sub judice.

W. Collins Sons & Co., Ltd., 1928. Pp. 296.\nThe author, who has had the advantage of a series of sittings\nwith Mrs. Osborne Leonard, extending over a number of years,\nhas selected extracts from his records and narratives of his\nexperiences, adding his comments and conclusions. He deals\nwith three main topics\u2014(1) the identity of the communicators\nwho claim to be his deceased father and sister, (2) the conditions\nof the after-life, (3) the modus operandi of trance communications\nthrough Mrs. Osborne Leonard. He gives his reasons for accepting\nas true the messages received on all three heads. He does not\nassign a separate Part of the volume to each head, but, as the\nContents shows, intermixes the chapters so as to make \" the\nevidence and the description alternate \" (Preface, p. 6). He has\nfollowed this plan to consult the taste of the general reader,\nand from this point of view may be successful. One can open\nthe book at random and find something of interest to read without\nhaving to go through the previous chapters to understand it.\nThe student would probably prefer three separate Parts with a\nfinal Summary showing how the three lines lead up to one ter-\nminus. There is no index, and the want of one is felt.\nThe material has been well selected. The communications are\ndistinctly above the average of mediumistic utterances. They\nare free from dogmatism and crude extravagances. The author's\ncomments and arguments are cautious and restrained. Though\nhe expresses decided opinions he discusses alternative explanations\nimpartially. He does not make unreasonable claims for the\nauthority of the teaching (see pp. 258, 259 for his remarks on\nthe source of spirit). His attitude towards mediumistic statements\nin general is set forth on p. 260 as follows :\n\" I do not accept statements as true merely because they\ncome to me through psychic channels. They may have been\n\fDecember, 1928 Reviews 399\nblurred during transmission, or mingled with fancies in the\nmedium's mind. \"When satisiied that they represent ^vhat\nthe communicator wishes to say, one should further consider\nwhether it is an opinion that is being expressed, or a personal\nexperience.\"\nHe makes out a strong case in favour of the identity of his\ncommunicators with his father and sister. The descriptions of\nthe spheres and of the modus operandi in trance communications\nare hardly so convincing. One sometimes doubts whether they\nought to be understood literally or symbolically, and there are\nsome passages which one suspects may have been distorted in\ntransmission by some question or thought of the sitter or even\nby the mind of the medium. Whatever views the reader may\ntake concerning the origin of the phenomena he will certainly\nfind interesting narratives of evidence and discussions affording\nfood for reflection.\nA. W.

On a certain Easter Monday\nMr. Smith committed suicide, and on the following Sunday he\nwas seen by the officiating clergyman and two members of the\ncongregation standing on the chancel steps when the offertory\nwas being presented by the two acting Wardens. In the second\ncase Mr. D. L. Dadirrian, who is almost completely blind, was\nsitting one evening on the porch of his house when he heard\nfootsteps approaching and then gradually dying away along a\ngravel path which stretched all along the front of the house ; he\nsupposed at the time that the footsteps were normally produced.\nHis cousin, who was with him on the porch, heard no footsteps,\nbut saw an apparition of Mr. Dadirrian's wife (lately dead) passing\nalong the path in the same direction as the footsteps. The\nspecial interest of the case lies, as the Editor points out, in the\nfact that \" the apparition, which was seen by the seeing observer,\nwas heard by the observer who relies upon the auditory sense for\nhis contact with the world.\"\n\fDecember, 1928 Notes on Periodicals 403\nMonsieur Rene Sudre has an article on \" The Phenomena of\nLevitation,\" in which he reviews Monsieur Olivier Leroy's recently\npublished book on this subject.

The explanation by chance coincidence would seem\ntoo far-fetched, I think ; on the other hand, the words of the\nclairvoyante are not reproduced verbatim, and it is possible that\nthe amount of coincidence was less impressive than reported. In\nthe beginning of the paper. Dr. Nagel gives characteristic details\nas to the attitude of the Austrian police and the Sanitdtskom-\nmission towards such performances (in public) as Dagma's ;\nthough\nprobably well meant, this attitude will strike all those who are\nnot enamoured of grandmotherly legislation as being of no very\ntranscendent intelligence.\nAt the end of the article an attempt at explanation of prevision\nof the future by the late Carl du Prel is quoted, briefly amounting\nto this.

The \" criminal-telepathic \" experiment\nwhich took place at this trial (quite possibly for the first time in\nthe history of modern law !) is narrated in great detail, the\noriginal protocol being reproduced verbatim though \" with some\nabbreviations.\" So is Countess Marie Eulenburg's sworn evidence\nas to the particulars of a theft (jewels stolen and subsequently\nrecovered), where Frau Giinther-Geffers seems to have attained,\nas far as the description of the jewels goes, a rather striking\nmeasure of success.\nCarlos Mirabelli is the subject of a short paper by Dr. Chr.\nSchroder. From it we learn that Professor and Frau Hans\nDriesch were present at a seance of this Brazilian medium's\non the 3rd of August last. The phenomena observed fell far\nshort of those narrated in the pamphlet referred to by me in\nthe S.P.R. Journal for October and November 1927 ; still the\nfact remains that Prof. Driesch has signed a statement not un-\nfavourable to the genuineness of some of them and mentioning\nas particularly impressive a door being closed at a distance of\n5 metres from Mirabelli. The light was good throughout.\nDr. Schroder prints the first of two articles on the \" Institute\nfor Metapsychical Research \" at Berlin-Lichterfelde Ost, which seems\nto have existed since May 1925. This Institute has inherited the\nmaterial, apparatuses, etc., left by the late Herr Fritz Grunewald.\nWe wish it success in its activity, but must note with regret that\nthe language used by its founder and leader (Herr Schroder)\ntowards those whom he considers as his opponents is hardly\ncalculated to promote that \" solidaire international cooperation\n\"\nwhich he thinks indispensable. Of this language the present\narticle affords evidence once more. (For other specimens see in\nparticular the pamphlet Pseudo-Entlarvungen. Members of the\nS.P.R. may be interested to hear that Herr Schroder accuses the\nSociety of being \" out to smash \" (sabotieren) Physical Phenomena,\nboycotting them and permitting its sceptical members to \" slander\n\"\nphysical mediums (p. 295).\nKriminalistische Monatshefte, August 1928.\nThis review is edited by Dr. Weiss, \" Police vice-president\n\"\nof Berlin. It contains an account bearing on Frau Giinther-\nGeffers and her alleged powers. Without entering into details,\n\f4)08 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1928\nit will be enougli to state that the Konigsberg clairvoyante seems\nto have failed completely in the attempt to imravel the mystery\nof a double murder committed on the 19th of June last near\nSoldin, Prussia, the victims of which were a Herr and Frau\nSchulz. The statements made by Frau G.-G. appear to have\nbeen either purely coujectural, or erroneous, or\u2014worst of all\n\u2014\nbased on information already published in the newspapers (includ-\ning \" Karl Lottes,\" the name of the soi-disant murderer). On\nthe whole a bad case for Frau G.-G.'s prestige as Kriminal-\ntelepathin ;\nthough no general conclusions can be drawn, of\ncourse, from an isolated instance.\nKriminalistische Monatshefte, October 1928 (Dr. Weiss, Vice-\nPresident of the Berlin police, editor). Kriminal-Direktor Her-\nmann discusses recent clairvoyant experiments at Iserlohn which\nhad the object of clearing up a murder committed as far back as\nSeptember 1911 at Griinmannsheide near Iserlohn (mysterious\ndisappearance of a girl 21 years old). The girl's lover had been\nat the time suspected, arrested, imprisoned and subsequently set\nfree, there being no evidence against him.\nIn July last an attempt was made, with the co-operation of\ntwo Iserlohn police officials acting as privatleute, to unravel the\nmystery through Frau Gerber-Wieghardt of Diisseldorf\n.\nThe clairvoyante gave a series of very precise statements and\ndescriptions as to the missing girl and her supposed murderer,\nbut there is good reason to believe that this information may\nhave been supplied to her by G., a journalist, who had had\naccess to the dossier of the case and who seems to have played\na somewhat ambiguous part in the affair.\nMeanwhile another experiment bearing on the same crime was\ngoing on in Berlin with Frau Giinther-Gefiers (now well known to\nreaders of the Journal). The Konigsberg clairvoyante described the\nmurder but mentioned an altogether different person as the\nmurderer, giving his Christian name, surname and address.\nBoth Frau G.-G. and Frau G.-W. stated that the girl had been\nstrangled and thrown into water. As to this point there seems\nto be some corroboration though of the vaguest kind.\nTo the author's general considerations a propos of the Iserlohn\ncase we hope to revert in course of time.\nP.-P.-S.\n\fJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nINDEX TO VOL.
