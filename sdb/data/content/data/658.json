Luntz.\r\n 1\/1, March 1935--1966(?)  $3.00 a year (1966).  8 1\/2 x 14 folded newsletter.\n\n This was a Theosophical journal edited by L.W. Rogers in its first two years.  Rogers announced the discontinuance of the journal with the issue for February 1937, but it endured into the 1960s under the editorship of Luntz (1890-1971), a British-born Theosophist and astrologer, who combined discussions of the current Theosophical internecine squabbles with astrological observations and lessons.  He was a leader of the St. Louis Theosophical Society, into which he introduced, over the fears of the Society at large, an astrological school in 1924, and later initiated similar schools in other lodges of the Society.  Contributions by Luntz, Geoffrey Hodgson, Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Fred Morgan, et al.  The Statement of Ownership for 1965 says that the paid circulation was 1765  -- a claim that may rest on the fact that Luntz send each member of the Theosophical Society in America a free copy of the journal.  On Luntz's retirement from the journal it became the lodge newsletter of the Society in St. Louis.
