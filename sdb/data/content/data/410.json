The thanks of the Council were requested to be given\nto the donors.\nThe usual cash account for the preceding month was presented.\nIt was confirmed that a General :\\Ieeting should be held at the\nRooms of the Society of British Artists, Suffolk Street, Pall }Iall, S.'V.,\non Friday, the 26th inst., the chair to be taken at 8.30 p.m. The\npapers to be read will be the second part of that on \"Some Higher\nAspects of Mesmerism,\" commenced at the last Meeting, and the con-\nclusion of the Final Report on Phenomena attested by Members of the\nTheosophical Society. Members and Associates will be at liberty to\ninvite friends.\nThe next meeting of the Council was fixed for Friday, the 26th\nJune, at 4.30 p.llI.\nREPORT OF THE GENERAL MEETING.\nA General Meeting of the Society was held on the evening of\nFriday, May 29th, at the Rooms of the Society of British Artists,\nSuffolk-street, Pall Mall.\nIn the absence of the President, and of any Vice-President, the\nchair was taken by Mr. F. W. H. 1lye1's.\nThe first paper on the agenda was by Messrs. E. Gurney and\nF. ,V. H. Myers, and dealt with \"Some Higher Aspects of\n~lesmerism.\" The part which was read related to the medical aspects\nof mesmerism. A brief sketch was given of the difficulties with which\nthis branch of the subject had had to contend, and of the sort of\ncriticism to which it had been exposed. It waS pointed out that, though\na very large amount of the testimony to mesmeric cui'es and to the\nbeneficial effects of mesmeric treatment was of a loose and uninstruc-\ntive kind, and though the whole subject was encumbered with wild and\nignor~nt theory, a certain residue of cases were on record which seemed\nto stand on a different footing, and which, whether they deserved careful\nattention or not, had certainly never receivedit. Esdaile's evidence as\nto his treatment of Hindoo patients was referred to; and a case was\nquoted to show that all the well-attested results could not be explained\nas merely hypnotic in character. An attempt was made to classify the\ncases in which mesmeric therapeutics appear at any rate worth a trial;\nbut at the same time the chance of any wide success in England was\nadmitted to be small-few operators seeming to possess the faculty in\nsufficient strength to produce specific effects on English patients.\n. Dr. Wyld remarked that he had listened with gl'eat pleasure to the\npaper which had been read, and that, as the result of 40 years' ex-\nperience, he could entirely corroborate all that it contained. He wished\nDigitized by Coog\n\fJune, 1885..~ Journal f!f Sociei.1J lor PS,Ilckical Rcseorcll.. 419\nto refer specially to the curative power of mesmerism in neuralgia, and\nto assure those who suffered from it that in the great maiority of cases\nmesmerism offered a speedy and often a permanent cure.\nl\\fr. Gurney then made a few remarks on the importance of having\nM. Richet's card experiments (Proceedings, Part VII., pp. 241.-3)\nrepeated on a wide scale. Any couple of persons, with a very small\nexpenditure of time and trouble, can make avaluable contributionto the\nvery large total of results required. It is best to use a pack from\nwhich the picture-cards of each suit have been removed. The remain-\ning 40 cards are held by A, who, for each experiment, brings a fresh\ncard to the surface of the pack by a random cut. He fixes his attention\non this exposed card, and B, sitting a little way off, out of sight of the\npack, makes a guess at the suit. Ifthe guess is wrong, A makes a small\nhorizontal mark on a sheet of foolscap in front of him; if the guess is\nright, he makes a perpendicularmark. After 50 such trials (which can\nbe made, according to Mr. Gurney's experience, in less than ten minutes),\nthere will be a column of 50 marks onthe paper. A then goes through\nthis column, making crosses of the perpendicular marks, and counting\nthe crosses.* This, of course, givea the total number of right guesses\nfor the day, ,lnd this total is recorded at the bottom of the\ncolumn. After the process has been gone through on 20 days, 1,000\nguesses will have been made; and the numhers at the bottom of the\ncolumns, being added together, will give the complete total of crosses\nor right guesses. The most probable number of guesses for pure\nchance to give is, of course, a quarter of the 1,000 (there being always\none chan:le in four of guessing the suit correctly), i.e., 250. The\npoint which it is desired to ascertain is whether in the whole, or in a\nlarge majority, of the sets of 1,000 guesses each, the number of right\nguesses will exce~d 250. If that proves to be the case, it will be a\nstrong argument for the operation of something beyond pure chance;\nin other words, it will tend to show that a certain number of B's\nright guesses have been due to the fact that the suit guessed was the\none on which A's attention was concentrated. A confident appeal is\nnow made to Members and Associates of the Society for Psychical\nResearchto give help in this direction. If a hundred of them would de-\nvote a fe,v minutes a day for three weeks to carrying out the 1,000\ntrials with some fri(md or rela.tive, a month would produce what is\nneeded. A hundred records of the sort described are urgently needed\nbefore the end of July.\n*The reason for not making a cross to begin with is that a cross requires\ntwo marks, and B may learn, by hearing the double sound of the pencil on some\noccasions and the single sound on others, when he has been right and\nwhen wrong. It is important that his mind should not be distracted by any\nknowledge of his successes and failures.\nDigitized by Google\n\f420 JOllrnal Qf Society\/or Psyckical Research. [June, 1880.\nThe Chairman, in introducing Mr. Hodgson to the meeting, explained\nthat the actual Report of the Committee appointed to investigate the\nevidence for marvellous phenomena connected with the Theosophical\nSociety was not yet prepared, but that the conclusions which\nMr. Hodgson was about to give as the result of his personal\ninvestigations commanded the general assent of the Committee.\nHe pointed out how very extensive and prolonged Mr. Hodgson's\ninquiry had been, and how absolutely necessary, if any satisfactory\nelucidation of the facts was to be reached. The evidence of the Coulomb.Ii\nwas, of course, worthless so long as it was unsupported, and the editors\nof the Christian College .Jfagazine (who had performed a delicate task\nwith much tact and temper) were, of course, unable to get at the\nTheosophic witnesses, and prove, or disprove, the Coulombs' statements\nby comparison with other evidence, with the actual localities, &c. Mr.\nHodgson, who had been very justly accepted by both parties as an\nimpartial inquirer, had had opportunities which no one else had enjoyed\nof learning the facts from every quarter. He had spent three months\nin India in this inquiry, not only investigating all the allegations made\nby the Coulombs, but other equally important points. The result\nof his investigations was one which could hardly give pleasure to\nany party. Noone interested in psychical research could ht'.ar with\nsatisfaction that so great a mass of apparently well-attested phenomena.\nwere, in fact, referable to fraud and credulity. And the matter was\nmade worse by the pain which would thus be given to many persons\nwho had believed that the noble philosophies of the East were being\nnow recommended to mankind by genuine evidences of power over\nnature. A scientific committee, however, could do no more than allude\nto considerations of this sort. Its duty was simply to examine the\nalleged facts without prejUdice, and to state its conclusions without\nreserve. Few, he thought, would .be disposed to refuse credit for\ncandour and acumen to the Committee's representative in this affair,\non whom he now called for an account of some of his investigations.\nMr. Hodgson began by stating that in November of last year he\nproceeded to India for the purpose of investigating on the spot the\nclaims of Theosophical phenomena, and that he went not indisposed\nto believe in their genuineness. He referred to the charges of\nfraud brought against Madame Blavatsky by the Coulombs, and sup\u00b7\nported by letters alleged by them to have been written by Madame\nBlavatsky, but asserted by the latter to be forgeries. It was important\nto determine whether these letters were genuine'or not. It was also\nof the utmost importance to determine the competency of the witnesses\nto phenomena in India, especially of Mr. Damodar, Mr. Babajee, and\nColonel Olcott.\nAfter a careful examination, Mr. Hodgson concluded that the dis-\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune,l885.] Journalot' Society \/01' PS!Jcltical Researcll. 421\nputed letters were written by Madame Blavatsky, and the well-known\ncaligraphic experts, Messrs. Netherclift and Sims, were also of the\nsame oplnIon. It appeared from these letters that a large number of\nthe alleged Theosophical phenomena were ingenious trickeries, carried\nout by Madame Blavatsky with the assistance chiefly of the Coulombs.\nRut further investigations were required to determine whether certain\nother phenomena not mentioned in these letters were fraudulent or not,\ne.g., the astral journeys of Mr. Damodar; and to determine also whether\ncircumstantial evidence confirmed the decision of experts as to the\ngenuineness of the disputed letters.\nMr. Hodgson stated that after a thorough survey of the evidence,\nhe had concluded that the Theosophical phenomena formed part of a\nsystem of fraud worked by Madame Rlavatsky, with the assistance of\nthe Coulombs and several other confederates, and that none of the\nphenomena were genuine. Mr. Damodar he found to be quite untrust-\nworthy, and was compelled to regard as a confederate in the fraud. Mr.\nBabajee was also involved as a confederate, but in a less degree.\nColonel Olcott's evidence, he thought, varied so greatly from fact that\nit became impossible for him to place any value upon it, and he stated\nthat Mr. Mohini's evidence would not bear comparison with the state-\nments of others. The witnesses generally in India, he found to be\nexaessively credulous, excessively bad observers, and many of them prone\nto culpable exaggeration. It was impossible, he said, to enter into all\nthe details of so complicated an investigation, and in the short time at\nhis disposal he could.give only a few instances by way of exemplification\nof the statements made. He then read a passage from one of the\nBlavatsky-Coulomb letters concerning the so-oalled Adyar Saucer, which\nshowed that Madame Blavatsky had made some arrangement with\nl\\Iaclame Coulomb for the performance of a phenomenon which should\nedify }Iajor-General Morgan. This saucer was placed in the\nShrine or cupboard leaning against the door, so that when\nMadame Coulomb opened the door, in Major-General Morgan's presence,\nthe saucer fell and was broken. The pieces were collected and placed\nin the Shrine, and after a short interval an unbroken saucer was found\ninstead of the pieces. Two accounts of the incident by General Morgan\nwere read. Madame Coulomb asserted that the broken pieces\nwere taken out through the back of the Shrine by M. Coulomb,\nand a whole saucer (the second of a pair) substituted. From General\n1Iorgan's accounts it appeared that this might easily have been done. Mr.\nHodgson then gave a brief history of the Shrine and its surroundings,\nexplaining his remarks by the help of various diagrams. It appeared\nthat letters and other objects might be taken out from or inserted in the\nShrine by means of a sliding panel and holes communicating between\nthe Shrine a.nd that portion of the adjoining room used by Madame\nDigitized by Google\n\f422 Journal ~f Societyfor P8.lIchical Re8earch. [June, 1885.\nBlavatsky as her bedroom. In consequence of the discovery of a sliding\npanel in the back of the Shrine, certain Theosophists removed the\nShrine secretly and destroyed it. Statements made by Mr. Damodar\nwere then commented upon by Mr. Hodgson, who showed that Mr.\nDamodar's evidence exhibited deliberate falsehoods, and that Mr.\nDamodar was morally untrustworthy.\nMr. Ifodgson then briefly instanced two statements from Colonel\nOlcott's deposition for the purpose of exemplifying how unreliable he\nwas compelled to regard Colonel Olcott's evidence.\nMr. Mobini, speaking for himself, and on his own private responsi-\nbility, said that he should not feel satisfied without explicitly asserting\nthat Theosophy was entirely independent of any phenomena. He\nobjected to the term \"Theosophical Phenomena.\" There were no\nphenomena which could be thus correctlydesignated. If anypersons were\nfound to be guilty of fraud they would be dealt with in a proper manner.\nReferring to what Mr. Hodgson had said of himself personally, Mr.\nMohini protested against being judged behind his back, and said that\nthe promised opportunity had not been afforded him of explaining\ncertain alleged discrepancies in statements he had made. Mr. Mohini\nspoke at some length of those higher principles of Theosophy, to the\nstudy of which he had devoted himself, which were among his cherished\nconvictions, and which did not rest on the truth or falsehood of any\nphenomena. (See p. 448.)\nThe Chairman said tbat the phrase \"Theosopbical Phenomena\"\nwould be avoided, and again explained that notI;Ung whatever beyond\nphenomena was being dealt with. He also promised that full\nopportunity would be given to Mr. Mohini for discussion and\nexplanation, and said that his not having yet had such opportunity was\ndue to the accident of Mr. Sinnett's being in Paris, so that Mr.\nHodgson'S attempt at an arrangement for a second private meeting in\n.London fell through. He had bad one meeting with Mr. Sil1l1ett, and\nwas to have had another, at which he hoped to meet Mr. Mohini. In\nfact, the Report itself was not yet drawn up.\nMr. Keightley explained to the meeting, on behalf of Mr. Sil1l1ett,\nthat he was in Paris, or he would have been present on this occasion.\nMr. Hodgson said that it was his desire that everything should be\ndone with the utmost possible fairness. He should be glad to afford\nMr. Mohini every opportunity either then, or at a private conference,\nfor discussion, and to fall in with any arrangements that might be\nsuggested.\nMr. C. C. Massey spoke warmly in defence of his friend Colonel\nOlcott. He had listened in vain for facts which would justify the\nremarks Mr. Hodgson had made. He .considered the two cases of\nColonel Olcott's inaccuracy which had been quoted to be very weak.\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1885.] Journal of Society.for Psyc\/dcal Reseal\u00b7ck. 423\nBut even if compelled to admit\u00b7 that Colonel Olcott was not a man of\nwhat he might call a strictly accurate mind, he should still believe him\nentirely incapable of any deliberate misstatement.\nMr. Hodgson, in reply, explained that Mr. Massey had misunder-\nstood him. He had distinctly not intended to impute any wilful mis-\nrepresentation to Colonel Olcott; merely to state that his evidence was\nin many cases unreliable. Mr. Hodgson proceeded to explain with more\ndetail, the two instances he had referred to.\nMr. Massey expressed himself satisfied if Mr. Hodgson did not im-\npute fraud, but it had appeared to him that no sufficient distinction had\nbeen drawn between Colonel Olcott and others.\nMr. Young, who stated himself to be acquainted with India, and\nwith many there who were interested in Theosophy, said that in his\nopinion these phenomena seemed to be a fundamental part of Madame\nBlavatsky's faith and an essential portion of her system. She was the\nfounder of the Theosophical Society, and he thought it was unfair to\nsay that Theosophy was unshaken by her exposure.\nMr. Mohini said that the last speaker appeared to misunderstand\nwhat Theosophy was. He referred to the rules of the Theosophical\nSociety, and said that Theosophists o.s a body had no creed, and that\nthere was no logical connection between Madame Blavatsky and\nTheosophy.\nDr. Wyld differed essentially from the views taken by Mr. Mohini,\nand contended that Madame Blavatsky possessed a grossly materialistic\nmind, and could have no claims to call herself a Theosophist in the true\nsense. She had, however, apparently With the assistance of several\naccomplices, concocted a system most illogically cltlled Theosophy; and\nhe held that the reliability of her teachings, wnatever they were,\ncollapsed with herself.\nMr. James A. Campbell spoke of Madame Blavatsky as being un-\nquestionably a powerful \"physical medium,\" and he thought that those\nwho could testify to this ought to come forward with what they knew.\nHe thought that in judging her, the nature of the influences with which\nshe had been surrounde(ought to he taken into consideration. There ap-\npeared no doubt as to frauds having been committed; but, on the other\nhand, Madame Blavatsky had devoted her life to the cause she pro-\nfessed to have at heart.\nl\\'[iss Arunelale inquired whether the exposure of alleged phenomena\nin India disproved phenomena here.\nThe Chairman, in conclusion, explained that in describing certainevi-\ndence as unreliable, no accusation of bad faith was implied. In matters\nof this marvellous kind the Society had always felt the need not only of\ngood faith, but of exactness of memory and some reasonable amount\nof acumen on the part of witnesses whose statements were to be\nDigitized by Google\n\f424 Jourllal C!f Societ,1I for Psycltical Rese\u00abrch. [June, 1885.\nconsidered of value. In the opinion of the Oommittee Oolonel Olcott's\nhonour could be saved at the expense of his intelligence. The list of per-\nsons whom Mr. Hodgson felt bound to accuse of complicity in fraud was,\nhe believed, a very short one, and in great measure composed of personal\ndependents of Madame Blavatsky's, attached to her by gratitude, and\nsome of them perhaps hardly realising the moral guilt involved. As\nregards Miss Arundale's question, the Oommittee undoubtedly felt bound\nto consider each phenomenon submitted to them on its own merits. At\nthe same time, if a large number of typical phenomena. were demonstrably\ndue to fraud, the Oommittee need hardly attach great importance to IJ.\nfew residual cases which still were difficult to explain. They would be\nvery happy to receive any further evidence which might be laid before\nthem, before the next meeting, which would b\u00a3 held on June 26th, ancl\nat which Mr. Hodgson would go into the question of the authorship of\nthe so-called \"Mahatma's letters.\" Recent Theosophy, as set forth in\n\"Esoteric Buddhism,\" apparently rested mainly on these letters;\nalthough, as Mr. Mohini had justly remarked, the truth 01' error of the\ngreat principles of ancient Eastern Philosophy was a question quite\nindependent of the genuineness or falsity of modern phenomena.\nThe meeting then assumed a conversational character, and was\ncontinued till a late hour.\nTHE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYOHICAL\nRESEAROH.\nIt would seem that the changes that have been recently made in the\nconstitution of our Society and especially in the relations uetween the\nOouncil and the Oommittees for experimental investigation, have not\nbeen altogether understood by all our Members; and that some of them\nare still disposed to regard the Society as holding, or bound to hold,\nopinions in its corporate capacity, and to consider the Oouncil as\nshirking its work if it does not officially pronounce on all important\nquestions that arise in any department of the researches which the\nSociety was formed to promote.\nFor instance, it has been said that\" the Psychical Society\" ought\n~ \"take up in a thorough-going manner\" the examination of a series of\nanswers to scientific questions said to have been marvellously made\nby a medium, that it ought \"to pledge its own credit and honour for\nthe result,\" and give \"a verdict after full investigation and in\nopen court.\" .\nNow an official\" verdict\" on such questions is just what the Society,\nas at present constituted, does not seek.to obtain, or authorise the\nOouncil to pronounce. What the Society, through its Oouncil, does,\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1885.] Journal of Societ!I\/or P8ychical Re8earclt. 425\namong other things, undertake to do is to publish reports of investiga-\ngations and speculations, and what it undertakes to judge is whether\nthe reports sent to it are worthy of publication. And in this it follows\nthe example of other scientific societies, and in particular of the Royal\nSociety. In the case of the Royal Society, individuals, or groups of\nindividuals, carry on investigations, and send in accounts of them to the\nCouncil of the Society, and if, after careful consideration, it appears that\nthe investigations were carried out with sufficient care and intelligence,\nand that the results are of sufficient interest, the papers are published;\nbut with a distinct statement that the Society does not pretend \"to\nanswer for the certainty of the facts or propriety of the reasonings\ncontained in the several papers so published, which must rest on the\ncredit or judgment of their respective authors.\" And this is what our\nSociety aims at doing in its own department, which at present lies to a\ngreat extent outside the range of subjects deemed worthy of scientific\ninvestigation by the Royal Society.\nltis, of course, desirable that the investigations so published should\nbe as thorough as possible, and that any conclusion arrived at should be\nfrankly and clearly stated, without any restraints or reserves, except\nsuch as may be imposed by due scientific caution; and if the facts\nrecorded can be adequately confirmed by repeated observations and\n,experiments, and the conclusions based on them duly sifted and tested\nby a full critical discussion, we may hope that gradually a body of\n-established and generally accepted truths may be arrived at in the\nsubjects with which we are concerned, as it has been in other depart-\nments of investigation.

[June, 18S1S.\nDublin, for the following \"narrative of mesmeric phenomena, which\nhave come under his own experience. l\\Ir. Glover used to take much\ninterest in mesmerism, and had considerable mesmeric power, whatever\nthat may be. His account of the performances of G. F. in the mesmeric\ntrance seemed to be worthy of preservation; accordingly, at my request,\nhe was good enough to write out for me the following narrath\u00b7e.\n'V. F. BARRETT.\n124, Stephen's Green, W. Dublin,\nFebrual,!\/ 9th, 1885.\nDEAR SIR,-Agreeable to promise, I hasten to give you as succinct an\naccount as possible of the case I was speaking to you about.\nIt is now about 15 years since I made mesmerism and its attendant\nphenomena my study, but during that time I was fortunate enough to have\nhad some very susceptible subjects on whom to experiment. One of these,\nGustave F., a young man of about 18, apprentice to al\\-Ir. Huggard, watch\u00b7\nmaker, of Tralee, was often used by me at private gatherings, and gradually\nbecame most plastic in my hands. Once on my way to dine at mymother's I\ncalled at the shop where Gustave F. was at work, and after a short conversa-\ntion with him and his master-an intimate friend of mine and who now\nresides in Dublin-he (Gustave F.) said that I had no further control over\nhim, inasmuch as he would resist any attempt I might make to bring him\nunder my influence. I answered, \"Don't be too sure; turn round.\" He\nobeyed, and I placed my hand on his head, and turning to the large regulator\nclock in the establishment told him to look at it. \"It is now 2 o'clock.\nGo on with your work; I'm going to my dinner; but at half-past 2 you must\ngo to sleep, whether you like it or no.\" \"All nonsense; I defy you.\"\n\" Very good; I say you must; good-bye.\" So I left him and went to my\nmother's house, about seven minutes distant. I had n:>tquite finished dinner,\nand was conversing on ordinary topics with my mother, having quite for\u00b7\ngotten my arrangement with Gustave F., when suddenly a painful recollection\nflashed across my mind-\" Wha\u20ac about Gustave 1\" I took out my watch.\nIt was half-past 2. Feeling alarmed, I made excuse to my mother for leaving\nso abruptly and hastened to Mr. Huggard's shop. Entering it I saw that\nGustave's seat was vacant. \"Where's Gus. 1\" \"He has gone outside,\nI think,\" was Mr. Huggard's reply. So without more ado I proceeded\nthrough the shop to the rambling back premises ; called \"Gus.\" repeatedly,\nImt received no answer; but after a search, to my great relief, found him\nliterally all of a heap in the corner of 110 disused outhouse and snoring\nstertorously.\nIt cost me more effort than ever I otherwise experienced to arouse him.\nI had to slap him on the shoulders and call out\" Gus. ; all right,\" loudly and\nrepeatedly. He awoke in about three or four minutes, and I made the upward\npasses and then asked him to narrate what had occurred since my departure.\n\" I went to work and forgot all about it,\" was his statement, \"till I felt a.\ndrowsiness and my eyelids closing, when I recollected your words, and looked\nround at the clock. It was half-past 2 to the minute, so I knew that you\nwerp. right, but I determined to fight off the oppressiveness stealing over me.\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1885.J Journal qf Society for PS!lcltic((.1 Research. , 427\nand for that purpose went out to the yard. I had only got to 'the door when\nI became uncons.cious, and remember no more.\" \"\nI must now mention that the shop where Mr. Huggard carried on his.\nwatchmaking business adjoined another owned by his brother-in-law, de-\nceased, but whose widow and sonstill continue the gunmaking then conducted\nin it. Mr. Edwards, the gunmaker, had an apprentice, who saw Gus. stagger\nin the yard, and naturally, not suspecting the true cause, concluded that the\nlad had taken drink, so very kindly went to his assistance, tried to rouse\nhim, and even went so far as to light a pipe and blow the tobacco smoke into-\nhis eyes and nostrils, but to no purpose. He slapped his face rather soundly.\nand roughly knocked him about, \u00b7but all without success. As he could not\nget him either to open his eyes or to speak, he considered him hopelessly\ndrunk, and, to save him from getting into trouble With his master, carried\nhim into the outhouse and placed him, sitting down in the corner, where I\nfound him.\nWhat I would ask your attention to in this account is, that both the subject\nand myself had forgotten the arrangement or test intended, and\"the infiuence\nappearing to operate independently of the volition of either of us, recalling\nboth of us from the ordinary business of life to act in obedience to some\nunknown power.\nOn another occasion, one. evening, about 8 or 9 o'clock, at a\nrather numerous party, I placed the young man,\u00b7 G. F., in the extreme\nhypnotic state, (md after several present had tesbed his insensibility by\nsticking pins in his arms and passing a lamp in frent of his eyes (the pupils\nremaining unaffected), I tried if I could obtain any of the phenomena of\nclairvoyance.\nAvoiding leading questions, he faithfully described the interiors of the\nsleeping rooms of many of those present, and to which he never had access,\nalso the show-cards and posters on the platform of the Tralee Station of the\nGreat Southern and Western Railway, but those he had often observed\nin his ordinary condition.\nSomeone now proposed to test him by asking for the description of a\nlocality which he had never seen, and Kingstown, near Dublin, was\nsugge~ted. He had up to this time never been farther from home than\nKillarney, some 20 miles distant. He gave a perfectly correct delinea-\ntion of Kingstown Harbour, piers, mail steamer at station. &c. Directing him\nto describe anything further, he answered, \"I see a large vessel coming\nin.\" I asked for more particulars, and he replied, \"She is too distant.\" I\nthen told him to take a b:>at or reach her by any means he liked. Seemingly\ngetting nearer he continued in a few minutes: \"It is a large ship, and she\n\u00b7has troops on board, I can see the soldiers.\"\nI requested him to ascert;:.in her name. \"The Himallah\" (sic) was his\nreply, adding that he could not see very plainly.\nI encouraged him to try again, and he repeated, \"The Himallyea, or\nHim-a-Ieyah.\" each time using a tri-syllabic word as nearly as possible\nresembling\" Himalaya.\"\nThe remarkable circumstance in this case is, that in two days afterwards\nI read in the Irish Times of the arrh'al in Kingstown Harbour, from India, of\n\"the troopship Himalaya, bringing soldiers, &c. It was utterly impossible for\nDigitized by Google\n\f428 Journal qj Society for PS.lJckical Researcll. [June, 1885.\nanyone present to have had the slightest inkling of this. Certainly I\nknew Kingstown well, and as well as I can recollect was aware that there\nwas such a vessel as the Himalaya, and that she was employed as a troop-\nship, but there all ai'dinary knowledge ceased.\nIf it was merely a haphazard thought of mine conceived spontaneously,\nand, in BOme way transferred to G. F.'s mind without contact or\nsuggestion, then the coincidence with actual fact was, to say the least,\nvery remarkable; but my own impression and that of all present was that;\nit was an undoubted instance of what is termed clairvoyance.\nIn the cases of the contents of rooms, &c., which he had never seen, it\nis possible that he became conscious of the thoughts of others through the\nmind of the operator, for by no means could anyone communicate by sign,\n.sound, or otherwise, any idea to him, unless through me, the operator.\nIn fact the ordinary theory of thought-transference fails to account satis-\nfactorily for aU of the phenomena that are here described. I may mention\nthat this was the last experiment I tried on G. F., inasmuch as his father\n(Jalled on me the next day and requested that I would discontinue further\ninvestigation; of course I complied.\nI had a very marked case of partial hypnotism brought under my notice\nabout this time, in the person of a Wesleyan clergyman, the Rev.. M.\nHynes, whom I often placed in this state, stiffening his arms, fixing him to\nthe fioor, &c., but whom I never could succeed in getting to disregard the\n.evidence ofhis senses. Giving hilll a book and telling him that it was a cat, he\nwould gravely look at it, rub it down, tum it over several tinles, and after a\nmost careful investigation, lasting some minutes, would, in the most solemn\nmanner, say, \"No, it's not a cat, it's a book.\"\nNo matter how strongly I tried to impress the idea on his mind, or how\n-often I tried, the result was always the same, never once did I succeed in\npersuading him to any but the correct realisation of an obJect in either form,\n.colour, taste, or smell, &c.-Yours truly,\nJ.

Regarding\nthe incident referred to in the report, viz., the sleep of the young man G. F.,\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1885.) Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 429\nI remember distinctly Mr. Glover, in the early part of the day, saying, in my\npresence and in the presence of my journeyman, \"You will go to sleep to-\nda.y at half-past 2 o'clock.\" We all laughed at Mr. Glover'sabsurdity,and\non my return from some outdoor business I was told that G. F. did actually\ngo to sleep, and that all the efforts mentioned in the report, and by all the\nparties therein referred to, had been resorted to in order to restore conscious-\nness, but without success, until Mr. Glover arrived.\nAs to the other incidents mentioned in the report, I remember G. F.\ngiving a true description of places he had never seen, and also of the show-\ncards at Tralee railway station. I was present when Mr. Glover sent him off\nto Kingstown, and asked him, among other questions, \"What vessels are in\nthe harbour 1\" He replied, \"There are lots of vessels there, and I see one.\njust now coming in.\" Mr. Glover next asked for the name of the vessel\ncoming in, when G. F. replied, \"I can't see the name distinctly, but I think\nit is the 'Helena.'\" Mr. Glover: \"Get closer, and ascertain the name.\"\nG. F. remained a few minutes as if intensely gazing through the distance, and\nthen replied, \"I can see now, the name is not' Helena,' but' Hemalaya.'\"\nMr. Glover: \"What cargo does she bring 7\"\nG. :F.: \"I can see no cargo on board, only a lot of soldiers walking up.\nand down the deck.\"\nAnother matter which I recollect distinctly, but which does not appear\nin Mr. Glover's report, and that is the fact of our meeting this same young\nman (G.

[June, 1885.\nON PHYSICAL TESTS, AND THE LINE BETWEEN THE\nPOSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE.\nI should like to offer some brief remarks on three errors, into which,\nas it appears to me, investigators into Spiritualistic phenomena are\nliable to fall.\nThe errors of which I speak are (1) mixing up in a confusing way\nmoral and 'physical evidence; (2) forgetting that the onus probandi\nlies entirely on the Spiritualistic side; and (3) overlooking the fact\nthat the liI).e between the possible and impossible is for practical\npurposes rarely a sharp and clearly defined one.\nBy moral evidence I mean evidence derived from knowledge of the\nmoral character or the intellectual capacities of the medium. To those\nintimately acquainted with him such evidence may be absolutely con-\nvincing, but it neither can nor ought to have much weight in such a\nmatter with others, and though at first sight to impose physical tests\nseems to imply doubts offensive to the medium, it. must be rememberE'.d\non the other side that when there are no such tests, he is left to bear\nalone before the world the whole responsibility for the genuineness of\nthe phenomena, a responsibility which ought to be shared by all the\ninvestigators, and which they cannot share except by applying such\ntests. And it is here that t~e confusion I speak of comes in. It is\nsometimes said that \"what WII.S done would have been almost impos-\nsible for a conjurer, and the medium was certainly too honest or too,\nstupid to do it.\" A test of which only this can be said is useless, since\nit really throws us back entirely on the moral evidence; and, as the\ninvestigator's conviction of the honesty or stupidity of the medium,\nhowever well founded, cannot be conveyed unimpaired to other people,\nthe world cannot be blamed for concluding that the medium cheated\nand that the investigators were duped. Whereas if the phenomena are\ndue to something beyond the recognised laws of nature, the investi-\ng'cl.tors should aim at driving the world to the alternative of either\nadmitting this, or accusing them as well as the medium of fraud.\nAnd this brings me to my second and third points, w~ich are closely\nconnected. In deciding on what is a test phenomenon, it must be\nremembered that, as I have just said, it will establish nothing, unless it\nis clear that it could not have been due to the operation of recognised\nlaws of nature. If we could accurately determine the point at which\npossibility ends and impossibility begins, it would be a comparatively\nsimple matter to find such tests, but because we cannot in most\neases be sure of knowing accurately all the circumstances, there\nis generally a large margin between the two, within which we\ncan neither prove impossibility nor possibility. And the whole\nof t.his margin, made as wide as we can, must be reckoned,\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1885.] Journal of Societ!l\/ol' P.sycTtical Research. 431\nfor the purposes of the investigation, as if it were 011. the possible\nside of the line. The tests, to be good, must bnng the phenomena\nout of this marginal region and place them clearly within the line\nof undoubted impossibility, so far as normal means are concerned. This\nis true, of course, of other scientific investigations. Margins must\nalways be allowed when there is any doubt as to all the conditions and\nquantities being known, and mistakes are often made from oVjlrlooking\nsome of these. But in most scientific investigations the experimenter\naims at simplifying his problem as much as possible; he can often take\nit in stages and reduce it at each point to a single alternative; and in\nthis way the margin is much diminished, and can, at any rate, probably\nbe clearly defined. In the Spiritualistic problem, however, as it is\npresented to us, the experimenter can very seldom secure really simple\nconditions. He is almost always embarrassed by a number of unknown\nquantities, and the possibilities are so numerous that he is peculiarly\nliable to overlook some of them altogether, and it is, therefore,\npeculiarly incumbent on him to allow the widest margin he possibly\ncan. Some fairly simple test phenomena have been suggested. For in-\nstance, it was proposed, a good many years ago, by Mr. Hensleigh\n'tVedgwood, I believe, that the passage of solid matter through solid\nmatter should be proved by means of two rings of leather. They were to\nbe cut or stamped out of a skin as rings, having, of course, no join in\nthem ; and by occult means they were to be linked into each other. The\nproblem would then be reduced to the simple question whether or not\nthere was any joining in either of the rings. If the rings had originally\nbeen broad ones, they might, after they were linked, have been cut\ninto a great number of thin strips, and each strip examined with\nmicroscope and solvents, and a joining, if there had been one, must have\ncome to light. But though attempts have been made to obtain this\nphenomenon, they have, I believe, been unsuccessful; and such pheno-\nmena as putting a ring on a medium's wrist have not the same\nsimplicity. For, apart from the ring itself .and the question of\nwelding it on the arm, we \u00b7are necessarily in doubt as to the circum-\nference of the medium's hand; the extent to which it varies at different\ntimes under different treatments, and the degree to which he can, by\nexerting his muscles, control the apparent variations. With so many\nunknown quantities a large margin in the apparent difference between\nthe circumference of the ring and of the hand must be allowed.\nI will give another illustration. 1\u00a3 a half sheet of note-paper can\nbe slipped into a locked secretaire without using any instrument to\nforce an opening, it should not be regarded as a sufficient proof of\nabnormal power should a thick sheet folded in four be found to have\nbeen inserted. The margin allowed would be far too small. After\ntrying what the skilful use of a wedge would do in forcing up the lid\nDigitized by Coog\n\f432 Journal f!f SOC1.\u00b7ei.1J for P8ycMcai Research. [June, 1885.\nof the secretaire, we should have to allow for the possibility of more\nskill than ours, of devices which we had not thought of, and perhaps\nfor the possibility that the wood might be more amenable to the bending\nrequired in some states of the atmosphere than in others. It would\nnot, however, be of much consequence making these experiments and\nallowances in the particular case of a secretaire, because the test could\nnever be a good one, owing to the almost irremediable uncertainties\nintroduced by the lock, and the possibility of opening it by a duplicate\nkey, or by a key accidenb\\lly left about.\nBut in reading accounts of physical phenomena attributed to extra-\nphysical agency, it really sometimes appears to me that the investigators\nhave not only omitted to allow the necessary margin beyrmd what can\nbe proved physically possible, but have even regarded as test phe-\nnomena things which can be proved physically possible by simple\nexperiment-things which they themselves could do if they tried.\nFor instance, writing on the ceiling has been regarded as a\ntest phenomenon, and the suggestion that it might be done with a\npencil attached to a broomstick treated with scorn. Well, I do not\nknow about a broomstick-I have not tried it-but I found no difficulty\nin attaching a pencil to a walking stick by two elastic bands,standing on\na table and writing on my own ceiling, which is eleven feet htgh. The\nwhole process-fastening on the pencil and writing a word or two-\ntook about two minutes.\nIt may be laid down as a rule that investigators should make a\npractice of trying themselves to reproduce, as nearly as they can, any\nphenomena that appear to them worthy of notice; especially when, as\nis so often the case, the 8oi-di,ant spirits choose the tests; for very\nmany things appear wonderful merely because they are beyond the\nrange of our ordinary experience. And I may add, that before finally\npronouncing what has been observed to be physically impossible, it\nwould generally be desirable to take the opinion of persons well versed\nin mechanical contrivances and prestidigitation.\nI will conclude by pointing out two classes of tests where it is\nespecially necessary to allow a very wide margin between the clearly\npossible and the clearly impossible. They are (1) tests such as I have\njust spoken of, selected, not by the investigators, but by the 8oi-disallt\nspirits, and not determined on beforeh~d; and (2) tests selected by\nthe investigators, but only once accomplished amid repeated failures.\nAnd the reason is the same in both cases, namely, that some entirely\naccidental, and therefore unsuspected circumstance, may have made the\nparticular phenomenon possible, by normal means, on the particular\noccasion.

Oue day, walking\nthrough a lane, I found the first wild violets of the spring, and took them\nhome to her.\nEarly in April I was attacked with a d3ngerous illn6l!8; and in June left\nthe place. I never t.old my wife exactly where I found the violets, nor, for\nthe reasons explained, did I ever walk with her past the place where they\ngrew, for many years.\nIn November, 1873, we were lltaying with friends at Houghton; and\nmyself and wife took a walk up the lane in question. As we passed by the\nplace the recollection of those early violets or 121 years ago flashed upon\nmy mind. At the usual interval of some 20 or 30 seconds my wife remarked,\n\" It's' very curious, but if it were not impossible, I should declare that 1\ncould smell violets in the hedge.\"\nI had not spoken, or made any gesture or movement of any kind, to indi-\ncate what I was thinking of. Neither had my memory called up the perfume.\nAll that I thought of was the exact locality on the hedge bank ; my memory\nbeing exceedingly minute for locality.\nThe following is Mrs. Newnham's account :-\nMaker Vicarage, Devonport,\nMay 28th, 1885.\nI perfectly remember our walking one day in November, 1873, at\nHoughton, and suddenly finding so strong a scent of violets in the air that I\nremarked to my husband,\"If it were not so utterly impoBBible I shoulddeclare\nI smelt violets!\" Mr. Newnham then reminded me tl1at he had found violets\nin that spot 12 years before, and said he had just been thinking of it.

I am not accustomed to dream. and am sure I speak far within\nthe mark when I say that I have not dreamed a dozen times since my\nmarriage, 23 years since. Dreams, too, are supposed to arise from\nsomething affecting one's mind, and producing some temporary strong\nimpression, and in this case there was nothing which could affect me in that\ndirection, but some qUIte the reverse.\n\" Our first horticultural show of the season took place on November 27th.\nI WOll several prizes; and after the show closed at 10 p.m., I had to take\nhome some of my smaller exhibits, and arrange for getting the others home\nnext morning. It was thus near midnight when I reached home, and the\nonly things talked about by -- and myself afterwards were the show and\nmatters of local interest. If anything, therefore, were likely to be on my\nmind when I fell asleep, it would probably be one or other of the above\nmatters. I do not know how long I slept, but my first sleep was over and I\nwas lying in a sort of half-awake, half-asleep state, when I distinctly heard\nour mother's voice say faintly, \u2022Harry, Harry!' and when daylight came\nand I thought the matter over, I wondered what could have possessed me to\nfancy such a thing. Our Uncle C. and his family called me Harry, and\nUncle B. sometimes did so, and the Do's also called me Harry, but with\nthese exceptions I was called Heury by all our relations. It is possible our\nmother may have called me \u2022Harry' during my very early childhood, but so\nlong as I can remember she Inways called our father' Papa' and me \u2022Henry.'\nIt seemed to me, therefore, so utterly absurd that I should fancy her calling\nme by a name that I never recollected to have heard her use, that I mentally\nlaughed at the idea and wondered how such a thing should have entered my\nhead. Still the circumstance struck me as so strange that I underlined the\ndata on the margin of my working diary in order that if anything should\noccur to corroborate it, I might be certail}. as to the time. Directly, there-\nfore, after I reached home with S.'s and your letters, I turned to the diary\nand found the underlined date was November 28th. It was evidently during\nthe afternoon of November 27th that our mother uttered my name (this\nwould have been so, A. F.); and allowing for the difference of longitude, the\ntime would be early morning of the 28th with us, so that I don't think there-\ncan be any question that the call actually reached my ear. I am only sorry\nthat I was not sufficiently awake to note the e:x;act time, but should fancy it.\nto have been between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, which would represent\na few minutes later on the previous afternoon with you. The whole-\ncircumstance, however, only adds another to the numberless .nes which\nprove that our minds or souls possess powers of which we have, as yet, a\nmost imperfect knowledge, and means of communication with each other\nwhich are beyond our finite comprehension. They are, in fact, the strongest.\nevidence, in my opinion, which we have of the existence of the soul; and I\nbelieve it is this feeling which leads the class of people who arrogate to\nthemselves the title of \u2022free-thinkers,' to try to explain them away or cast\ndoubt upon them, since it is perfectly certain that they cannot be accounted\nfor by the action of any materialistic portion of our being.\"\nI certify that the above is a correct extract from my brother's letter,\nwritten ~o me from Wanganni on the above date.

Adams, together\nwith a young cumpanion, Charles Tuell, aged about 12 years, went on the ice\nof our lake for the purpose of .skating. Merrily they passed along, exchang-\ning greetings with their young friends till they had reached the frozen waters\nof the lake, and there, allured as is supposed by the excitement of their\nsport, they passed from the solid ice nearest the village at the foot of the\nlake, to where the treacherous waters were thinly skimmed over by ice, and\nwhere the springs had left large air-holes. Into one of these the older\nbrother, \"Ry,\" as he was called, fell, and was rescued by the presence of\nmind and intrepidity of his younger brother, little\" Davie,\" who stretched\nhimself on the ice so that Ry could take hold of his feet, and then Charley\ntook hold of his hands and pulled Ry out. Chilled with the water with\nwhich his boots were filled and clothes 'saturated, Ry, with his companions, .\nstarted for the eastern shore towards an ice-hut to warm and dry himself. A\ncaution WIL& spoken by Charley, and IlcarcO had he spoken it when the ice\nagain gave way and precipitated Ry again in the water. Terrified and sur-\nprised at this new calamity, the courage of Ry, and the loving fidelity of\nDavie did not forsake them. Intrepidly did the brave and generous little\nDavie endeavour to save his belovedbrother, but as he approached him the\ntreacherous ice gave way, and\u00b7he soon sank, while Charley, powerless to save\nhis young companions, stood by in agonised terror. Bravely did Ry meet the\ndeath which awaited him-gallantly struggling to preserve himself from\nsinking, till his frozen hands fell powerless by his side, and he went down\neven when help was within a few rods distant. Mr. S. C.

Nothing, however, was thought of the matter at the time,\nthe mother simply saying that the little one was probably only rel'eating what\nit had heard from some one.\nA few hours later a telegram was received, announcing that at just about\nthe time these words were spoken, David, the child's cousin, with a. brother\na yea.r or two older, were drowned while skating 40 miles away.\nIn this case there was no premonition, no presentiment, no revival of a\nslumbering thought. The subject of the clairvoyance was of a tender age.\nbeing old enough to talk. It can hardly have known what death was, and\nstillless dreaming, for it is not known that the word had ever been used in\nthe child's presence.\nThe incident attracted considerable attention at the time, and a brief\naccount of it found its way into a local journal. Otherwise, it has never\nbeen made public. You are at liberty to make such use of itas you JIl!LY see\nfit.-I am, dear sir, faithfully yours,\nCHARLES B. CURTIS.\nDOCUMENT III.\nI here forward a statement of the incident narrated to you in my letter of\nNovember, and send you in this sheet a copy of the same. The\noriginal, signed by Mrs. 0., I have in my possession. I. also encluse a\nslip reprinted from a local newspaper.

[June, 18.'J5.\nSTATEJlENT.\nOn the afternoon of January 2nd, 1867, my little daughter, Augusta, aged\n3 years, was playing with her dolly, sitting near her aunt, who was spending\nthe day at my house in Genoa, New York. Her little cousins, Darius and\nDavid Adams, aged 11 and 9 years, to the younger of whom she was tenderly\nattached, were living in Penn Yann, New York, 25 miles away. The cousins\nhad not met since the preceding summer or early autumn.\nWhile busy with her play, the child suddenly spoke and said, \"Auntie,\nDavie is drowned!\" Her father, who was present, and I heard her dis-\ntinctly. I answered, \u2022\u2022 GUlIsie, what did you say 1\" She repeated the words,\n\" Davie is drowned! \" Her aunt, who was not familiar with the childish\naccent, said, \"GuBBie, I do not understand you\" ; when the child'repeated\nfor the third time. \"Auntie, Davie is drowned!\" I chanced to look at the\nclock, and saw it was jUllt 4.\nI immediately turned the conversation, as I did not wish such a painful\nthought fastened on the child's mind.\nI cannot recall that any allusion had been made to the boys that day,\nneither was I aware that my daughter even knew the meaning of the word\ndr()'!oned. She simply uttered the words without apparent knowledge of their\nimport.\nThat evening a telegram came from my brother saying, \"My little boys.\nDarius and Davie, were drowned at 4 o'clock to-day while skating on Kenka\nLake.\"\nE. M. O.\nKings Ferry, New York.\nL.-812-Ad P.\nStatement by the Rev. W. J. Ball, M.A., Cambridge.\nDuring my college days I had a very dear and intimate chunl, R. F.\nDombrain. We used to walk together,read together, pray together, and would\nhave thought it wrong to keep any secret from each other. We hoped to go\ntogether into the foreign mission field, but my friend was ready to go before\nI was, and it was while he was in London making arrangements about going\nabroad that he was seized with a very bad fever, and his life for some time\ndespaired of. At last he recovered and returned to Dublin, where I saw\nhim several times. He was not quite restored to health, but I hoped he would\nsoon be so. This was the state of things when I went down to the County\nLimerick, in the spring of 1853. I received a few letters from my friend\nwhich told me ofgradually improving health. I was busily occupied about\nmy mission work at the village of Doon, .and felt perfectly at ease about my\ndear friend's recovery. A few days had elapsed without any tidings reaching\nme, when on the morning of the 14th of April, I had the most vivid dream I\nremember ever to have seen. I seemed to be walking with young Dombrain,\namidst some beautiful scenery, when suddenly I was brought to a waking\ncondition by a sort e;f light appearing before me. I started up in my bed,\nand saw before me, in his ordinary dress and appearance, my friend, who\nseemed to be passing from earth towards the light above. He seemed to\ngive me one loving smile, and I felt that his look contained an expression of\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1885.] JOlt1'llal qf Societ\/Ilor P8ychical Re8earch. 439\naffectionate separation and farewell. Then I leaped out of bed, and cried with\na loud voice, \" Robert, Robert,\" and the vision was gone.\nIn the house there was sleeping a young servant boy, whose name was\nalso Robert. Be came running into my room, saying that my loud cry h'ld\nawakened him from sound sleep. and that he thought I was ill. The whole\nscene was so impressed upon my mind that I felt the death of my friend just\nas really as if I had been by his bedside, and seen him pass away. I had\nlooked at my wa.tch and found the time 3 minutes past 5. I knew that at\nthat moment my friend's spirit had passed from his body. I could think of\nnothing else. .A class of Scripture readers cam'il to me at 10 o'clock that\nmorning. I told them Icould not speak to them of the appointed subject,\nbut must tell them what had occulTtld, and for a long time I lectured them\nentirely on the subject of the future state, and the separation of the soul\nfrom the body. During the whole of the day the same sad gloom weighed\ndown my mind, which I should have felt had I been with my friend at his\ndeathbed. 1 wrotE.' to my sister asking for l>articulars, and I wished to\nknow the exact time the death had taken place. Never once did the slightest\ndoubt cross my mind that my friend had died.\nThe following morning I received a. letter from my sister stating that\nfor a few days Mr. Dombrain had not been so well, and that at 3 minutes\npast 5 in tho morning he had quietly passed away from this world. Since\nthen I have very often mentioned tlle circumstance to friends, and the deep\nimpression made by the event can never pass from my mind. I lately wrote\nto my sister asking her to tell me what she remembered about the dream. Her\nreply is dated 17th July, 1884; she says: \"I have not a distinct remembrance\nof the dream. I have heard you allude to it from time to time, and feel quite\ncQnfident of its reality.\"-S. P. BALL, 12, Upper Leeson-street.

It seemed like a succession\nof dissolving views. First I saw in a glimmer of light, a railway train and\nthe puff of its engine, as it were, in the corner of the room ; I thought\n\" What's going on up there 1\" \"Travelling 1\" \" I wonder if any of us are\ntravelling, and I dreaming of it.\" Then a voice of some one, unseen,\nseemed to me to answer ,. No ! something quite different.\" I felt unwilling to\nsee it. Then I saw, behind my head, my twin-brother William, the upper\nhalf of him, lying as it were half up, leaning back; eyes and mouth half\nopen. H is chest moved for a moment co,nvulsively ; he raised his right arm ;\nthen bent forward; muttering \"I suppose I should move out of this.\" I\nfelt somehow glad that he moved. Then I saw hinl lying flat on the ground\nat my side, the chimney of an engine behind him. I called out \"Oh that\nwill strike him.\" He seemed then leaning up on his elbow, startled. and say-\ning \"Is it the train, the train 1\" His right shoulder then shaking, and re-\nverberating as if struck rapidly from behind. He fell back ; his eyes rolled,\nan arm was thrown up. Then something like panelling of wood passed by,\nand the whole went off with a swish, leaving what seemed a faint gleam of\nmoonlight in the distance. Next,there appeared before me in very brightlight\na compartment of a railway carriage,and in the window of this a young clergy-\nman I had only seen once, the minister of the district where my brother had\nbeen residing. A porter went up to him and seemed to ask, \" Have you seen\nanything of. \u2022 1\" Mr. J. seemed to answer\" No!\" And the porter\nran off. After all this I saw the full figure of my brother at my side, standing.\nHe put his hand over his face and began slowly to move away. I seemed to\ncall out \"Is he going 1\" The voice that seemed to speak always from over\nmy head answered\" Yes\" ; and then seemed to moved along over my\nbrother's head. I saw then a pale face as of one figure and the back of another\nushering him, as it were, along.\nI then woke, as I have said, with a loud sigh; and my husband, waking\nup with the start, asked me what was the matter. I felt very unwilling at\nthe time to repeat what I had .seen, and only saying I had been dreaming\nDigitized by Coog\n\f442 Journal qf Soeiet!; for PS,Ilckical Researek. LJune, iSS!).\nabout a railway and asking him \"what was that light 1\" though there was\nnone in the room. I fell asleep at once, tired out.\nAt this time I had no anxiety about my brother; but a few days after this\ndream my husband received a letter from that saine clergyman, and telllllg\nof my brother being killed by a railway train on the night of the 18th July,\nand that the fatal accident must have occurred about half-past 9 or 10\no'clock. This clergyman was in the train that killed my brother!\nIt would seem that my brother had started in the cool of the evening\nfrom the village where he had been residing, with the intention of walking\nto a town about 15 miles off i that he had chosen, possibly as the nearest road,\nthe railway line; that he had felt tired and heated, taken off his boots, lain\ndown on the sloping bank, very likely dozed off; and, startled and confused\nby the rapid rush of the approaching train, tried, by a convulsive effort, to\nget up, and was struck while rising by some projecting part of the train. It\nwas on the head and the right shoulder that it struck him. I may add that\nI retired that evening in a strongly nervous state, and while undressing had\nthe sensation as if something or some presence was in the room! Perhaps I\nShould add that the scene of the fatal accident to my brother was some 400\nmiles distant from my own home at the time.\nThe following is from Professor Sidgwick ;-\nI had a personal interview with the writer of the above narrative, Mrs.\nS., and her husband, in April, 1884, and learnt that it was exactly\ntaken from the account in a diary written the day, or the day after, the news\ncame. Before this she had just mentioned the dream to her husband, but\nhad not described it. She desired not to think of it. She is, however, quite\nsure that it did not grow more definite in recollection afterwards.\nMrs. S. cannot regard it exactly as a dream. though she woke up\nfrom it. She never had a series of scenes in a dream at any other time.\nThey were introduced by a voice in a whisper, not recognised as her brother's.\nHe had sat on the bank as he appeared in the dream. The engine she\nsaw behind him had a chimney of peculiar shape, such as she had not at that\ntime seen i and Mr. S. informed her when he came back that engines\nof this kind were used in the place where her brother was-Victoria. (Mr.\nand Mrs. S. were in Tasmania at the time.) She had no reason to\nthink that any conversation between the porter and the clergyman actually\noccurred. The persons who seemed to lead her brother away were not\nrecognised by her, and she only saw the face of one of them.\nThe strongly nervous state that preceded the dream was quite unique in\nlIrs. S.'s experience. But as it appeared that, according to her recollection,\nit commenced about 8.30, with the occurrence of a small domestic annoy-\nance, and therefore, at least an hour before the accident took place, it must\nbe regarded as of no import.ance evidentially. Mr. S. recalls Mrs. 8.'s\nnervousness at supper about 9.30. The feeling of a presence in the room\nwas also quite unique. Mrs. S. never h&d anything like a hallucination.\nMr. S. confirms his wife's having said to him at the time of the dream,\n\" What is that light 1\"\nThey have special reasons of a private nature (which were mentioned to\nme) for thinking that her brother's last thoughts were likely to be of her.\nDigitized by Google\n\fJune, 1885.] JOI,rnal Qf Society\/01' Paycltical Reaearcl,. 443\nMrs. S. had never been aware of any community of sensation with him.\nShe has had dreams of other relatives, which there is reason to think coin-\ncided ,vith their death or illness.\nThe above is written out from notes made by me at the time of the\nconversation.-HENRY SIDGWICK.\nL.-1038-Ad pn\nFrom Miss Kate R.\nLondon, Octobel\u00b7, 1884.\nI was on a visit at Colnbrook, in Buckinghamshire, in 1878, and one\nnight when I went to bed, and while yet fully awake, I felt an influence as\nif someone was in the room. I sat up to see what it was, and saw my\ngrandmother, in the plaid cloak she usually wore, leaning upon my mother's\narm. I looked round the room to see whether the vision could have arisen\nfrom any reflection from the mirrors in the room, and while doing so I saw\nthe figures walk slowly round the room and disappear.

The exact time of the appearance clnnot be noted now, only that\non reflection my daughter thinks it would be later than 10.

I am a\nnative of a town in the North of England, and in my childhood had a friend\nof my own age whom I will call C.

When thus standing in doubt, a kind of shudder passed through\nme, accompanied by a most extraordinary feeling, which I can only compare\nto that of a jug of cold water poured on the nape of the neck and running\ndown the spine; and as this passed off. though I cannot sa.y I heard. a voice\nI was distinctly conscious of the words, \" Go to Z by this evening's train\"\nbeing said in my ear. There was no one at the time within l00yards of me.\nI was not very flush of money just then, and could not well afford the ex-\npense, besides not wishing to absent myself from duty so soon after taking it\nup.

I could not,\nhowever, settle to anything, read, write, or sit in comfort, till the time was\nelapsed when I could have caught the train, when the uneasy, restless feeling\ngradually went off, and in a few hours I was ready to laugh at myself.

[June, 1885.\nThursday she felt unable to go on with her work, and after a while, about\n1 o'clock, saw a vision of her father; that it turned out afterwards that her\nfather died at that very time, and that just before his death he had been\nspeaking of her; that a lettt'r sent to inform her of his being worse failed\nto reach her: and that though she knew he was ill she was not aware that\nhe was in immediate danger; but that she was 80 impressed with her vision\nthat she set off home the Saturday following, and \"'learnt on the way that\nher father was dead, and that his funeral was to take place that very day, so\nthat she arrived only just in time. Indeed, we must confeBS that the evidence\nfor \"apparitions\" at the time of departure is so strong that we cannot but\naccept it as more probably true than false, leaving, however, the philosophical\nexplanation of what an \"apparition\" may really be to the future. We have\nverified one subordinate part of the above narrative; for by reference to the\nparishregister we find that the burial took place on the 31st of May, 1823;\nand as the Sunday letter for that year was E, which is the letter for the\n1st of June, the burial turns out to have been, as stated, on a Saturday.\nOur informant was then, as shown by the register of hor baptism, 25\nyears old.\n[In sending the above Mr. Foxley writes on October 24th, 1884 :-]\nThe enclosed cutting from Ohw'ch Bells has the advantage of having been\nread over to Mrs. Pollard, and accepted by her as a faithful statement of what\noccurred to her. She was buried here, February 14th, 1884. She could read\nwell. The\" 1 o'clock\" mentioned was in the day-time. I recollect her\nmentioning dinner-time. The place was some out-building, I think a summer-\nhouse, but of that I am not certain. . . \u2022 She always told the story\nunder the impreBSion that she was wide awake.\n[In another letter Mr. Foxley adds :--]\nI cannot recollect whether she said she mentioned the apparition to any-\none befol'e the news of the death arrived. But she told me that the a.pparition\nwas one cause, if not the cause, of her asking leave to go home to see her\nfather.\nI cannot say in whose service she was.\nAll I can add is, that I cross-questioned Mrs. Pollard repeatedly, in\nevery way I could think of, and that I could not shake her story. But then\nshe may have told it 80 many times that it had become truth to her, like.\nGeorge the Fourth's presence at the battle of Waterloo.\nL.-I045--Ad pa\nFrom MiBB C--, known to Mr. F. Podmore (written in the\nautumn of 1884).\nWhen I was about 10 or 12 years old I was sitting one evening, towards\ndusk, at the piano practising, when I saw an old lady, the grandmother of\none of my schoolfellows, enter the room. I was in the habit of seeing her\n* At a wayside inn, now a cottage, at Arras, on the Beverley-road, about three\nmil81 fro~ Market WeightoD, but in the parish\u2022.,....J.

She was very old, and to the best\nof my belief had never entered our house at all, so that I was greatly\nsurprised to see her. I heard the next day she had died on the evening I saw\nhor.\nI never had any other hallucination.\nMARY C.\nNovember 6th, 1884.\nIn conversation Miss C. explained that she did not actually see the figur&\nenter the room. She looked up suddenly and found it standing by her side.\nThe figure was in ordinMy indoor dress, with, as she particulaTly noticed, a.\nlarg'3 white cap, of muslin and lace, such as the old lady usually wore. The\nfigure vanished suddenly as she looked at it. The room, though dusk, was\nnot dark, and she was able distinctly to recognise the features.\nMis~ C. cannot recollect whether she told anyone of what she had seen.\nShe probably told the friend from whom she heam next day that the old lady,\nher friend's grandmother, was dead. The time of the death she does not.\n'remember.\nMiss C. knew the old lady well ; she was in the habit of running in to see\nher nearly every day. But at this distance of time she cannot racollect.\nwhether the old lady's death was expected.\nMiss C. has lost sight ofher friend, and can get no further particulars.\nF.P.\n[The incident probably occurred some 25 years ago.-F. P.]\nL.-I046-Ad po\nFrom Mrs. B., known to Mr. Podmore and other members of the\nCommittee.\nOctober 30th, 1884.\nWhen I was about 16 years old [probably about 20 years ago.-F.P.] my\nfather came down to breakfast one morning, and, after saying he had been\nawake a long time, he said, .. and about 5 OT 6\" (I forget the exact time) \"I\nsaw old Mr. --; he came and stood by the bed a minute or two, and then\nwent.\" In the course of the day we hoam of the death of this old gentleman,\nof whose illness we had previously known, but whose death we had not\nanticipated, as it was not thought his complaint was one likely to cause death\nOn inquiry, we learnt that he had died at the hour that my father had said\nhe had had a visit from him.\nMy fathoT was a merry, strong-minded man, with a scientific tum of\nmind and a great scorn of superstition. He is, alas I dead now some years,\nand I don't think we any of us thought more of the circumstance than tllat\nit was odd, but I remembered it.\n[In answer to a request that she would allow her name to bo printed,\nMrs. B. says:-]\nI quite see all the reasons you give, but I have really good reasons for the\nrequest I make, though you lllay truly say that I will tell the story and give\nmy name to anyone who cares privately to ask it.\nDigitized by Google\n\f448 JOlIl'nal(!f Society lor P8.lIcltical Re8earch. [JllDe, 1885.\nMR. MOHINI'S EVIDENCE.\nWe ha\\\"e received the following remarks from Mr. Mohini M.\nChatterji, in reference to the report of his speech at the last General\nMeeting, which appears at p. 422 :-\n\" On looking over the enclosed proof, I notice an important omission in\nit. Besides what is given there I said in effect: The facts mentioned by\nMr. Hodgson were beyond my personal knowle(lge; as to the interpretation\nof the facts I did not accept Mr. Hodgson's opinion. But I declined going\ninto the subject, as the Council of the Society for Psychical Research had\npractically prejudged the case by declaring adherence to Mr. Hodgson's con-\nclusions, without hearing the other side. No opportunity had been given\nto all those who were affected by the Report to examine it before it was\nmade public. Whatever might now be said would not have an unprejudiced\nhearing.\"\nWe gladly give Mr. Mohini the opportunity of explaining his\nposition more fully than is done in our Report of his speech. But we\nfeel bound to point out that what he says involves a complete mis-\napprehension of the facts of the case.\nThe Council of the Society for Psychical Research has expressed no\nQpinion whatever. The Committee appointed (under the old constitution\nof the Society) to investigate the phenomena haa as yet made no Report,\nand has, as the Chairman said at the ;l\\Ieeting, only arrived at certain\ngeneral conclusions. These may be briefly stated as follows :-\n(1) That the letters which Madame Coulomb asserts that she received\nfrom Madame Blavatsky are genuine, and the phenomena referred\nto therein parts of an elaborate fraud and conspiracy.\n(2) That a strong presumption is thus raised against th~ genuineness of\nother marvellous phenomena, put forward in connection with,\nand in support of Theosophic doctrine; and\n(3) That after examining the evidence for these other phenomena they\nfind no part of it strong enough to overbear this presumption.\nThese conclusions could not be materially affected by any explana-\ntion which Mr. Mohini might offer of the discrepancies between his\nevidence and that of others, to which Mr. Hodgson referred.\nWe may further point out, in reference to Mr. Mohini's statement\nthat no hearing had been given to \"the other side,\" that Mr. Hodgson\nis in no sense an advocate against Theosophy, but a member of the\nCommittee who went out to India to conduct on the spot an investigation\nwhich it was impossible to carry out satisfactorily at this distance; and\nof whose impartiality and open-mindedness-and complete neutrality\nat the outset of the investigation-it was impossible for the Committee\nto entertain the slightest doubt.\nDigitized by Google\n\f","_id":410}
