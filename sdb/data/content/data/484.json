C'etait une religion terre-a-terre et sans\npo6sie comme la race qui la concevait et qui la repandait. Nean-\nmoins elle aurait faib son chemin comme tant d'autres dont les\norigines furent tout aussi modestes et tout aussi brumeuses : a ses\ndebuts elle chemina meme a pas de geant. Mais la froide raison,\nqui rfegne enfin quelque peu, lui coupa les ailes et le Spiritisme,\nquoi qu'en disent ses fervents, vegete malingre, empoisonne par\nI'Escroquerie et la Folie.\nQue se passa-t-il au juste a Rochester? Nous n'en saurons jamais\nrien. Peut-etre les so3urs Fox furent-elles I'occasion et le moyen de\nph6nomenes authentiques. Mais, fines mouches, que le sens moral\nne genait pas, elles virent tout de suite le profit qu'elles pouvaient\nen tirer : elles en firent de I'argent, travaillant au lieu et place des\nesprits, quand ceux-ci ne voulaient pas travailler pour elles.\n\f4 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. Jan., mi.\nNous sommes dans un monde vraiment etraiige, ou iion seulement\nles petites causes peuvent engendrer des effets immenses, mais encore\noil des causes peu morales ou franchement imniorales peuvent\nengendrer de tres grands biens. Le Bien nait du Mai, comme le\nMai nait souvent du Bien : le Mai ne pent etre d6truit, ce serait\ndetruire I'Univers. Troublant mystere !\nLa banale aventure des sceurs Fox etait en elle-meme si peu de\nchose que dix ans apres elle aurait du tout au plus eveiller I'atten-\ntion de quelque historien de la folie. Eh bien ! Elle a cre6 une\nagitation qui changera peut-etre la face de la Terre. Les Spirites,\ndupeurs et dupes, ont taut crie sur les toits qu'il existe tout un\nmonde de phenomenes du plus haut interet pour Fhomme, qu'on a\nfini par les entendre. Ces phenomenes sont tres nombreux et tres\ndivers, et peut-etre bien, en effet, qu'en eux est la clef de mysteres\ncomme : la Vie, I'Homme et sa destinee. Si vraiment la plupart\nsont authentiques, leur etude est le premier b6gaiement d'une\npsychologic digne de ce nom. II y a 20 ans on en riait; il y a\n10 ans on disait : C'est etrange ! Aujourd'hui on est serieux chez\nles vrais savants et, plus ou moins haut, on dit : Tout de meme\nc'est peut-etre vrai. Et si c'est vrai, surement rHumanit6 a double\nun cap sur la mer tempetueuse qu'elle parcourt.\nAvec et apres les scaurs Fox, I'histoire du spiritisme, c'est Thistoire\ndu Mensonge. Cependant au milieu de cette interminable liste de\nmediums indignes, il y a quelques figures troublantes, deux surtout\n:\nD. D. Home et W. Stainton Moses. On a pu soupconner le premier\nde fraude, on n'en a jamais fait la preuve. Mais ce qui fera\ntoujours reflechir les esprits sans parti pris, ce seront surtout les\nexperiences severes que William Crookes fit avec lui : la modification\ndu poids des objets par simple contact du bout des doigts du\nmedium, et le jeu d'un accordeon dans une cage. Les precedes\nd'experimentation employes ont ete a ce point irreprochables que\nles critiques les plus aigues n'ont pu en entamer le compte-rendu.\nNe pouvant rien objecter, Frank Podmore a mieux aime avoir Fair\nd'ignorer le dernier de ces deux phenomenes : cela ne lui fait pas\nhonneur.\nLa vie de Stainton Moses n'est pas moins troublante que celle de\nD. D. Home. Stainton Moses manquait assurement de sens critique.\n11 a pu se tromper lui-meme, il a pu tromper dans un etat second,\nmais il n'a pas trompe consciemment. Peut-etre n'a-t-il pas trompe\ndu tout. Suspendons notre jugement.\nQuoi qu'il en soit, du jour ou Crookes s'est occupe de ces\n\fJan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.li. 5\nphenomenes il a fallii les discuter serieusement. C'6tait un grand\npas.\nCe pas fut depasse quelques annees apres par un autre bien plus\nimportant: la f'ondation de la \"Societe des Recherches psychiques.\"\nII y avait a I'Universite de Cambridge quelques jeunes gens unis\nentre autres par la torturante inquietude du grand Inconnu. lis\nveoeraient particulierement un de leurs maitres, Sidgwick, ame\nloyale, bienveillante et noble s'il en fut. Les jeunes gens s'associerent,\nsous la presidence de ce maitre aime, pour rechercher par des\nmethodes rigoureuses ce qu'il pouvait y avoir de fonde dans les\nphenomenes etranges dont tout le monde parlait alors. Les adh6rents\nleur vinrent vite. Stainton Moses fut du nombre au d6but, mais\nI'esprit de ce pasteur anglican avait ete coule dans un moule tout\nautre que celui de la science. Les minutieuses et striates methodes\nadoptees I'irriterent : il ne comprenait pas qu'il lallut prouver mille\nfois encore ce qui a ses yeux I'etait surabondamment. II etait ne\npour precher, non pour critiquer et cribler : il se retira done. Ce\nfut dommage, car quel merveilleux sujet on avait la ! Je ne croix\npas cependant \u2014 et je I'ai dit plus haut \u2014 que Stainton Moses\ncraignit personnellement d'etre pris en faute, comme tant d'autres\nqui battent en retraite avec de grands airs indignes, quand on les\nserre de trop pres. Mais Stainton Moses n'etait pas de son temps.\nDisons un mot de ces premiers pionniers de la Societe, dont\nI'oeuvre, comme toutes celles qui sont hautes, grandira par le recul,\nau lieu de diminuer. Je crois qu'on parlera d'eux plus tard comme\non parle a present des Galilee, des Newton, des Descartes.\nGurney est mort jeune et ce fut une perte grave. C'est lui qui\na ete I'auteur principal de I'ouvrage maintenant classique : Fantdmes\ndes Vivants. II avait un esprit froid, clair, penetrant et sans parti\npris, largement ouvert. Tres sensible et tres delicat, les horreurs\nde ce monde le rendaient amer et I'idee d'un Dieu de boute lui\nseml>lait peu soutenable. Mais il voulait bien croire a un monde\nmeilleur, si I'existence de ce monde pouvait etre etablie par des\nfaits.\nGurney fut pessimiste par temperament, F. Myers fut tout le\ncontraire. Myers fut le poete, I'enthousiaste, celui qui a la foi.\nMais il fut aussi celui a qui la bonne vieille foi sentimentale ne\npeut pas suffire. II avait un coeur, mais aussi un cerveau aussi\nexigeant que le coeur. Son oeuvre est grandiose, mais un peu\ninforme ; dans son style il y a trop de recherche. Plus de sobriety,\nplus de nerf le feraient lire avec plus de piaisir. Myers a rassemble\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1911.\nles faits par milliers ; il a fait ce qu'il a pu pour separer le grain\nde I'ivraie. Malgre cela, tous ces faits impressionnent surtout par le\nnombre. Enfin Myers, obeissant a un besoin de son esprit, s'est\ntrop hate de syst6matiser.\nFrank Podmore n'est pas sympathique a tout le monde et\ncependant son ojuvre, plus ingrate, est tout aussi grande et tout\naussi utile, au point oil en etaient et oil en sont encore les\nrecherches psychiques, que celle des deux premiers. Sa vie d'ecrivain\net de savant pent se resumer en ce mot : il critiqua. II prit les\ntravaux de ses collegues et les fit sonner, pour savoir s'ils avaient\nune felure. II a peut-etre exagere quelquefois. Hypnotise par un\ndetail, il n'a pas toujours bien vu I'ensemble. Mais sans Frank\nPodmore la Societe des Recherches psychiques aurait peut-etre d6vie,\nau lieu de s'6lever toujours a plus de rigueur. Ses critiques aigues\net parfois mordantes ont toujours paru cote a cote avec les m6moires\nqu'il dissequait sans pitie. Et jamais on ne lui en a voulu.\nD6cid6ment nous ne sommes plus ici dans I'habituel milieu des\nsavants. Sous ses critiques on sent neanmoins que Podmore a un\nesprit plus ouvert a la verite qu'on ne serait tente de la croire.\nPassons a Richard Hodgson. Voici a mon avis le plus grand\nchercheur psychique qui ait encore exists ! II n'a pas seulement\nobserve, il a experimente. Avec lui le psychisme est entre dans\nle laboratoire. Hodgson a eu le bonheur de decouvrir, comme\nprincipal sujet, une femme presque aussi admirable que lui : M\u2122'^\nPiper. Ces deux noma R. Hodgson-M\"\"* Piper passeront entrelaces\na la posterite. Hodgson n'a couru ni apres I'argent ni apres la\ngloire : il a vecu pauvre et meme besogneux en un pays oil rien\nn'est estime que I'argent. II a cherch6 aprement le vrai dans la\npeine et dans la gene : il a prie la v6ritable priere de demain, la\nseule que Dieu aura pour agreable. Sa recompense\"? II est parti\ntout a coup de ce monde, sur de I'immortalit^, si svir que lui, le\nsceptique d'antan, disait ; \"J'ai peine a attendre la Mort. Quand\nelle viendra je I'accueillerai avec des fleurs a la main.\" II a eu la\nmort souhaitee de Tennyson\n:\n\" Sunset and evening star, '\n'\nAnd one clear call for me !\nAnd may there be no moaning of the bar,\nWhen I put out to sea.\"\nHodgson ne mourut pas, il franchit le passage d'un saut. Mais\nla mort de F. Myers fut lente et penible, et merveilleusement belle.\nII disait : J'ai les sensations de l'exil6 qu'on va rappeler dans la patrie.\n\fJan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.R. 1\nA ces noms il faiidrait ajouter encore ceux de M'\"' Sidgwick et\nd'Oliver Lodge. Mais tous les deux soiit encore parmi nous.\nMyers donnait a la Societe presque tout son temps et beaucoup\nd'argent ; sa mort porta un coup terrible a celle-ci : elle chancela\nun instant. Mais elle ne tarda pas a se ressaisir et aujourd'hui\nelle continue normalement sa marche glorieuse. Les principaux\nouvriers du jour sont : M\u2122\u00b0 Sidgwick, Sir Oliver Lodge, M^\"''\nAlice Johnson, M\"'' Verrall, M'' J. G. Piddington, M'' Feilding.\nJ'en oublie sans le vouloir.\nII serait tres injuste de dire que la Societe des Eecherches\npsychiques a fait tout le travail serieux qui a ete fait en matiere\nde recherches psychiques depuis 30 ans. De puissants cerveaux s'y\nsont appliques en dehors d'elle, un peu partout et d'une maniere\nplus ou moins suivie. Mais c'est cette Societe qui, par sa tenacite,\nson amour de la critique, son attitude toujours digne, son souci\nd'avoir recours aux methodes les plus strictes, a petit a petit\nconquis sinon les corps savants, du moins beaucoup de leurs\nmembres les plus eminents. II y a dix ans, par exemple, dans un\ncongres de psychologie, nul n'aurait ose presenter un cas de\npsychisme pur : aujourd'hui on ecoute avidement dans ces congres\nles voix les plus incompetentes en la matiere.\nQu'on me permette done de resumer a grands traits les travaux\nde la Societe des Recherches psychiques, du moins ceux dont je\nme souviens sans reflexions ni recherches prealables. N'oublions pas\nque le sujet est immense.\nTout d'abord les investigateurs voulurent savoir ce qu'il y avait\nde vrai dans les stupefiantes merveilles operees par les nombreux\nmediums payes, devant des naifs sortis de tous les milieux. Ce fut\nuna campagne decourageante : ils ne trouverent rien qu'impudentes\nmystifications d'une part et inguerissable niaiserie d'autre part. II\nfallut laisser de c6t6 les mediums et se rabattre sur les faits\nspontanes.\nAlors commen^a une enquete vaste et serree sur ces cas d'appari-\ntions, d'impressions estranges et intenses, cas nombreux signales en\ntout temps et en tout pays, se produisant chez certaines personnes\npendant que d'autres tres eloignees traversent, a I'insu des premieres,\nune crise aigue, surtout la crise derniere, celle d'avant la mort. Ces\ncas ne se produisent pas quand il plait a I'observateur. Seuls peu-\nvent les observer ceux a qui ils surviennent. On ne pent done\nqu'en recueillir des recits. Mais le recit vaut ce que vaut I'obser-\nvateur. Ce qu'il convient de peser ici, c'est done la valeur mentale\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., I9il.\ndu percipient. Guiney et ses collaboiateurs s'y attacherent avec\npassion : ils rejeterent tout ce qui a premiere vue paraissait insufE-\nsant : puis ils s'astreignirent a visiter individuellement les gens dont\nils avaient retenu les narrations, leur posant les questions les plus\nminutieuses et cherchant a se rendre compte de leur valeur morale.\nAinsi s'6difia le livre Fantomes des Vivants, k partir duquel on a\nconsidere la telepathie sinon comme scientifiquement etablie, du\nmoins comme tout a fait probable. On connait le succes de cet\nouvrage.\nOn essaya ensuite de faire la meme enquete a propos des fantfimes\ndes Marts. Car les vivants n'apparaissent pas seuls aux vivants\n:\nles morts apparaissent aussi. Les recits plausibles, dus a des\npersonnes dignes de foi, furent beaucoup moins nombreux. Et, fait\nreniarquable, les cas, assez frequents pendant les premieres semaines\nqui suivent la mort, deviennent de plus en plus rares au fur et a\nmesure que la date de la mort recule davantage ;\nquand la mort\ndate d'un an, il ne s'en pr6sente presque plus. Done la rarete\nrelative des faits fit que la societe ne put donner un pendant au\nlivre Fantomes des Vivants par le livre Fantomes des Morts. Les\nnarrations retenues apres passage au ciible furent simplement soumises\naux lecteurs des Proceedings de la Societe par la plume de M\u2122\" Sidg-\nwick. Cette enquete est a reprendre.\nLe magnetisme et I'liypnotisme firent I'objet de travaux nombreux.\nMais ici les psychistes n'ont plus le monopole.\nLe magnetisme conduisait tout naturellement aux experiences de\ntransmission de pensee. Dans les laboratoires d'abord, puis entre\ndes localites distantes, avec des sujets tres divers, les experiences\nproprement dites out ete multipliees. II est prouve maintenant que\nla pensee peut se transmettre d'un esprit a un autre sans I'inter-\nvention des organes du corps ; la distance et la matiere interposees\nne semblent pas constituer des obstacles. Certes nous ne conniiissons\npresque pas les modalites du phenomene. Pour connaitre ces\nmodalites il faudrait coiniaitre la nature de Fame : nous sommes\nloin de la. Mais le phenomene existe. Cependant on a pu se\nrendre j\ncompte tout de suite que ce qui se ti'ansmet est ind6pendant\ndes mots, signes ordinaires de la pensee. Transmettre un mot est\npresque impossible, a moins d'eveiller le souvenir de ce mot par\nune image. C'est l'id6e, dans le sens etymologique de ce terme,\nqui se transmet. Constatation tres instructive ! Souvent I'agent\nn'arrive pas a transmettre au percipient I'idee exacte qu'il a en\nvue ; mais ce dernier en per9oit nettement une foule d'autres, par-\n\fJan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.R. 9\nfaitement exactes, qu'oii n'a pas eu I'intention de lui envoyer. Tr^s\ncommunes sont les hallucinations du percipient, sous I'influence\nd'une idee transmise : il semble bien que les fantdmes dont il a\net6 question plus haut soient des hallucinations analogues. De\nmeme I'etude des seances de M'\"\" Piper, de M'\"\" Verrall etc. laisse\nI'impression qu'il s'agit ainsi d'une transmission de pensee. Apres\ntout on concoit tres bien (t priori que s'il existe des esprits humains\ndesincarnes, et que si ces esprits peuvent quoiqu'imparfaitement\ncommuniquer avec nous, ce soit par une transmission de pensee.\nMais cette pensee, pour parvenir a notre conscience normale doit\nfranchir I'epaisse barriere de la chair : la est I'obstacle. L'attention\ndes psychologues ne saurait trop se porter vers la transmission de\npensee.\nLes maisons hantees ont de bonne heure preoccupe la Societe.\nLa hantise semble bien etre un fait de la nature. Mais les\naspects en sont multiples, les causes peut-etre tres diverses. II\nfaudra de nombreux travaux et sans doute un temps tres long\navant que nous puissions en discourir en connaissance de cause.\nLe professeur Barrett \u2014 que j'aurais du ranger plus haut parmi\nles premiers et les plus actifs pionniers de la Societe \u2014 a tout\nspecialement etudie le cas des sourciers. II y a d'etranges individus\nqui, en passant au-dessus d'une nappe d'eau souterraine, que rien ne\ndecele aux sens, eprouvent des impressions revelatrices, impressions\nqui feront, par exemple, tourner entre leurs mains une baguette de\ncoudrier. Voici un phenomene alfirrae depuis les origines de\nI'humanite et bien propre a mettre au nombre des superstitions\nancestrales. On aurait tort de le faire. Barrett a demontre par\nI'experimentation que le phenomene est reel, quelque incomprehensible\nqu'il soit. Certains sourciers se pretendent capables de decouvrir aussi\nles metaux precieux caches sous terre : mais ceci est plus douteux.\nQuelques rares memoires ont paru aussi sur les delires, les hallu-\ncinations des mourants, certains phenomenes inexpliques et con-\ncomitants de la mort. Ces memoires montrent qu'il y a encore la\nun vaste champ a explorer, champ plein de promesses. Mais c'est\npour le moment terre inconnue.\nEnfin I'ceuvre capitale de la Societe est I'etude de la mediumnite\nde M\"\"\" Piper. Cette 6tude dure depuis plus de 20 ans deja et se\npoursuit toujours. Hodgson y a consacre presque exclusivement les\nquinze dernieres annees de sa vie : durant tout ce temps il n'a pour\nainsi dire pas perdu son medium de vue. Les premiers memoires\nsensationnels sur le sujet sont de lui. Mais d'autres nombreux ont\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., I9il.\nparu en outre : la bibliotheque de tout ce qui a ete publie sur M\"\"*\nPiper est deja fournie. Et on en publiera longtemps encore : le\nplus interessant est peut-etre encore a venir. Meme s'il fallait\nattendre un siecle I'apparition d'un autre sujet pareil, nous n'aurions\npas trop de temps pour mediter sur les documents accumules.\nQu'on m'excuse si je n'essaie pas de donner un apercu de cette\nmediumnit6 extraordinaire ! mais cela ne se pent pas dans ce\nsommaire raj^ide.\nII fut un temps oil Ton disait: \"s'il existe des etres humains\nayant depouille le lourd vetement de la chair et se communiquant a\nnous, que ne prouvent-ils leur identite en rappelant des incidents de\nleur vie sur terre 1 Que diable, ceci est elementaire et doit etre\nfacile !\n\" Eh bien ! on peut dire sans exagerer que plusieurs centaines\nde communicants ont prouve leur identite par I'intermediaire de\nM\"\" Piper, d'une maniere qui paraitrait plus que suffisante, s'il\ns'agissait d'liommes vivants. Mais une fois qu'on I'a tenu, ce criterium\nla'a plus paru suffire. Certes, pour attribuer a la telepathie tons les\nresultats obtenus, il faut 61argir le cadre de cette hypothese a tel\npoint qu'il u'en reste plus rien. Mais enfin notre esprit, entraine\ntrop loin de ses voies ordinaires, aime mieux admettre une in-\nvraisemblable telepathie que d'une hypothese plus transcendantale.\nEt puis ces seances ne sont pas une eau pure : c'est une eau trouble\ncharriant des quantites de choses, que nous ne demelons pas. L'esprit\ndu medium, quoique amen6 a une grande passivit6, n'est pas aneanti.\nOn le sent agir, broder malgre lui, deformer. Ceci n'est pas\netonnant, c'est le contraire qui le serait. Si on pouvait communiquer\nclairement et sans obstacle de ce monde au suivant, ce serait que ce\nraonde et le suivant n'en font qu'un. Or, certes, ils en font deux;\nils se touchent, mais ne se confondent pas.\nOr done, une complication heureuse s'est produite depuis la mort\nde F. Myers. On objectait sans cesse : \"Sans doute il y a dans\nvos compte-rendus une foule de details ayant appartenu en propre\nau communicant pretendu et que le medium n'a pu acquerir norma-\nlement. Nous accordons meme que le consultant les ignorait\njusqu'en sa subconscience. Mais ces details pouvaient se trouver\ndans la conscience normale, voire dans la subconscience de quelque\npersonne vivant quelque part sur la planete. C'est peut-etre la tout\nsimplement que le medium les a t6lepathiquement puises.\" Combien\nde fois en son vivant Myers s'etait trouve en face de ce raisonnement,\ndont on sent toute la faussete sans pouvoir le ret'uterl Eh bien, il\nsemblerait que Myers, maintenant qu'il est au dela du voile, a\n\fJan., 1911. A French View of the S.P.R. n\ntrouve un nioyen de rendre caduc ce raisonnement specieux, et ce\nmoyen est celui des \"messages fragmentes.\" ^ C'est en effet a Myers\nque les esprits de M\"\"^ Piper font I'honneur de la decouverte,\nQuand a nous pour qui la personnalite posthume de Myers est tout\njuste une hypothese, croyons-en ce qui nous plaira. Toujours est-il\nque les messages fragnientes existent, nombreux deja, et qu'ils sont\nun fait nouveau. Voici schematiquement en quoi ils consistent.\nLe communicant \u2014 disons Myers, si nous voulons \u2014 au lieu d'envoyer\nson message par un seul medium, I'enverra par trois, quatre, quel-\nquefois cinq mediums, n'en donnant a chacun qu'un fragment incom-\nprehensible pour lui. Mais ensuite un chercbeur \u2014supposons M'\"\"\nJohnson ou J. G. Piddington \u2014 rapprochera ces fragments, ces\ndetails en apparence incoherents et verra que, reunis, ils forment\nun sens parfaitement clair. Ainsi exposee, la chose est aussi simi)le\nque geniale; mais, dans la pratique, etant donnees les difificultes de\ntoute sorte, entre autres la grande difficnlte d'envoyer les mots\nmeme d'une phrase, celui qui etudie les textes doit avoir beaucoup\nde patience et de perspicacite. Quoi qu'il en soit un nombre deja\ngrand de ces messages a et6 publie et appartient a la critique. Ils\nont ete obtenus surtout par I'intermediaire de M\u2122\" Piper, de M'\"\nVerrall et de M\"\"= Holland. Cette derniere habite I'lnde, M'\"=\nVerrall habite Cambridge, M\u2122\" Piper est a Londres ou a Boston :\nces dames ne communiquent pas entre elles, de cela on est sfir.\nMais ces messages, formant un tout evident, n'ont pu etre coucus\nque par un seul et meme esprit. Lequel? Voici le point capital.\nSupposer que ce serait celui de I'un des mediums qui I'aurait\nconcu et communique subconsciemment aux autres confine a I'absurde.\nAlors ? Alors la seule hypothese raisonnable est que ces messages\nsont bien ce qu'ils affirment etre et que leur origine est dans I'esprit\nde Myers ou de Hodgson. Done Myers et Hodgson existeraient et\npenseraient encore tout en n'etant plus parmi nous.\nEn conclusion, j'ignore quelle sera la conviction des generations a\nvenir, quand elles auront cultive ces champs immenses du psychisme,\nou nous ouvrons a peine aujourd'hui quelques sentiers au milieu de\nla brousse. Mais pour I'instant une seule hypothese rend compte\nde tous les faits entrevus ou prouves : c'est que I'ame est une entite\ndiff^rente du corps, actionnant celui-ci pour un temps, mais pouvant\ntres bien exister sans lui. Que la personnalite humaine survit a la\nmort du corps est la premiere et la plus essentielle v^rite illuminant\n\u2022Je ue sais vrainient comment rendre le n^ologisme anglais \"cross-cor-\nrespondence \" qui, du reste, n'est pas lui-meme tres explicite.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan.,1911.\nnos yeux. Mais il y a dans ces phenomenes la clef de bien d'autres\nmysteres et un jour viendra oil tout le savoir humain evoluera\nautour d'eux.\nOn s'etonnera sans doute que je n'aie rien dit des phenomenes\nphysiques du psychisme ; coups frappes, passage de la matiere a\ntravers la matiere, materialisations, dematerialisations, et tant d'autres.\nBien que ces phenomenes soient les premiers qui aient attire I'atten-\ntion, ils sont encore les plus incertains de tous. Je sais, nombre\nd'hommes de valeur s'affirment convaincus de leur realite, mais\njusqu'ici la Societe des Recherches psychiques n'a trouve que fraude\nsur ce chemin. Le medium a effets physiques le plus celebre est la\nNapolitaine Eusapia Palladino. Feilding, Baggally et Carrington\netaient recemment revenus de Naples convaincus de la realite d'au\nmoins la plupart de ces phenomenes. Puis cette femme s'est rendue\nen Amerique ou elle s'est fait prendre en train de frauder avec une\nhabilete consommee : tout est remis en question. Au reste ces\nphenomenes ont en eux une part de grossierete qui ne les rend pas\nseduisants.\nEn tinissant j'exprime encore une fois ma conviction que le\npsychisme sera la grande preoccupation de demain. Mais nos savants\nactuels ne sont pas propres a ces recherches : a des recherches plus\nhautes il faut des hommes plus hauts. II faudra chercher comme\nTon prie, par un divin devoir, non pour gagner de la gloire ou de\nI'argent. Le vrai psychiste devra etre un savant et un saint. Or\ncette race n'est pas commune encore. Aujourd'hui le saint est tout\nautre chose qu'un savant et le savant n'est pas un saint.\nNOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nIn May, 1910, The Journal of Abnormal Psychology became the official\norgan of the newly-formed American Psycho-pathological Association.\nThis change in the status of the Journal will, it is anticipated, lead\nto the publication of articles of a more distinctly medical kind than\nthose which have hitherto appeared. At the present time consider-\nable activity is being shown by American investigators in regard to\nFreud's work in psycho-pathology and psycho-therapeutics, and it is\npromised that contributions dealing with the psycho-neuroses from\nthe point of view of the Freud school will appear from time to time.\nNo part of Freud's Avork is more fundamental than his theory of\ndreams ; but that his views are not going to be accepted without\nchallenge is shown by the appearance of a long article by Dr. Morton\nPrince on \" The Mechanism aud Interpretation of Dreams,\" in which\n\fJan., 1911. Notes on Current Periodicals. 13\nhe contests several of Freud's conclusions (Journal of Abnormal\nPsychology, Oct. -Nov., 1910). In the same number Dr. Ernest Jones\ngives an abstract of a paper contributed by him to the American\nJournal of Psychology, April, 1910, on \"Freud's Theory of Dreams.\"\nA brief examination of these two articles will bring out the main\npoints on which Dr. Prince differs from Freud and his followers.\nAccording to Freud every adult dream represents the fulfilment\nof a repressed wish. The wish has been repressed because it is\ninacceptable to consciousness, and the repressing force is regarded\nas a \"censor\" that prevents its subsequent re-emergence into con-\nsciousness. But during sleep the activity of the censor is so far\nrelaxed that the repressed wish is allowed to manifest itself in con-\nsciousness provided that the thoughts are so distorted as to be\nunrecognisable. The true meaning of the dream (the latent content)\nhas to be extracted from the dream as remembered by the dreamer\n(the manifest content), and this can be done only by an elaborate\nprocess of psycho-analysis. Distortion of the latent content is brought\nabout by four different mechanisms: (1) Condensation. Every element\nin the manifest content represents several in the latent thoughts, and\nvice versa. (2) Displacement. The psychical intensity of a given\nelement in the manifest content shows no correspondence with that\nof the associated elements in the latent content. (.3) Dramatization.\nThe manifest content depicts a situation or action, a fact that\nexercises a selecting influence on the mental processes to be pre-\nsented. (4) Secondary elaboration. This is the alteration undergone\nby the dream processes during the apprehension of them in conscious-\nness. It particularly affects parts of the dream that have been\ninsufficiently distorted during the dream making. Its action continues\nafter waking, so that the memory of a dream becomes more altered\nthe greater is the period that has elapsed since it was experienced.\nThe forgetting of dreams is, like the distortion of the latent content,\na manifestation of the activity of the censor. In every dream appears\nsome incident of the preceding da}'. This incident may be insignificant\nin itself, but it has obtained psychical significance by becoming, on\nthe day of its occurrence, associated with significant experiences or\nmemories. A recent or conscious wish is inadequate to cause a\ndream unless it is associated with a repressed unconscious one. It is\nprobable that the groundwork of every dream is of infantile origin.\nThe function of a dream is to protect sleep by stilling the activity\nof unconscious mental processes that otherwise would disturb it.\nDr. Prince's observations confirm those of Freud up to a certain\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1911.\npoint only. He finds that running through every dream there is an\nintelligent motive, but he does not think that every dream can be\ninterpreted as the imaginary fulfilment of a wish. On the contrary,\nhe finds that some dreams are rather the expression of the non-\nfulfilment of a wish, or of the fulfilment of a fear or anxiety. And\nwhen the dieam is the fulfilment of a wish, it is not of a repressed\nwish, but rather of an avowed and justified wish. He is unable to\nfind any evidence of repression or of a \"censor,\" and he cannot\naccept the view that the amnesia following the dream differs in\nprinciple from that observed for dissociated states in general. He\nadmits the distinction between the latent and the manifest content,\nbut he thinks that the latent content is merely a logically connected\nseries of memories, of which the manifest content is a symbolical\nrepresentation. The distortion of the true dream thoughts in the\nmanifest content is only such as is required by the conditions of\nsymbolism. Dr. Prince finds no evidence of the distortion being the\nwork of a \"censor,\" and he regards dreams as being only a j^articular\ntype of the phenomena of hallucinatory symbolism. As regards the\ncharacteristics of the symbolism he has found evidence of \"condensa-\ntion,\" \"dramatization,\" and \"secondary elaboration,\" but he has not\nobserved the \"displacement\" of the emotion pertaining to the true\ndream thought to an inconsequential element in the manifest dream\ncontent.\nFreud insists that in every dream some incident of the preceding\nday appears. Dr. Prince, working with a subject who could be put\ninto several hypnotic states, discovered that ideas which passed\nthrough the mind just before going to sleep invariably appeared in\nthe dreams. This conclusion does not invalidate that of Freud, and\nif it is corroborated by other observers it may prove an important\nadvance in our knowledge of the sources of the content of dreams.\nT. W. M.\nREVIEW.\nAn Introduction to the Study of Hypnotism : Experimental and llierapeutic.\nBy H. E. WiNGFiELD, M.D. (Bailliere, Tindall & Cox, London,\n1910. 5s. net.)\n\" This little book,\" says Dr. Wingfield in his Preface, \" is an attempt\nto supply a simple answer to the question, 'What is Hypnotism?'\n. . . It makes no effort to range itself with the many larger works\non the subject, but intends rather to serve as an introduction to\nthese. . . . Those who are already familiar with the subject will,\nI fear, find nothing new in these pages. It is intended solely for\n\fJan., liill.\n' ' ' ' 1 , > > > )\n>> > ) ) 1 \\i y > , )\n15\nthose who as yet kno,w iiathing-pf hypnctisifi, wd to such inquirers\nit may prove of some service.\" In spite of the author's modest\ndisclaimer, the book may, we think, prove of more service to a\nserious inquirer than some of greater pretensions. In any science,\nand especially one which is still in so rudimentary a state as hypno-\ntism, it is important that books intended for those who know little\nor nothing of it should be written by men who are entitled to\nspeak with authority as to what is known, what is only conjectured,\nand how the student may best approach the subject. We need\nliardly say that the book before us fulfils this condition.\nHypnotism still suffers from its long-time association with quacks\nand charlatanry of all kinds, \u2014an association which was in great\nmeasure forced on it through its treatment by the mass of scientific\nmen of former generations. During the last thirty years much has\nbeen done to raise its status, and we may claim that the work of\nour Society, of which Dr. Wingfield himself has long been a dis-\ntinguished member, has played a part in producing this result. \"It\nis to Myers,\" he writes, \"that we owe the recognition of the supreme\nimportance of the subconsciousness, and of the part it takes in producing\nthe phenomena of hypnotism\": and one notices here, as elsewhere,\nthat certain cases first published by the S.P.R. are now qtioted as\nclassic instances known to all the world, and affording a welcome\nrelief to the once ubiquitous, if mythical, Hebrew-speaking servant-\nmaid, without whom no gentleman's psychology could formerly be\nconsidered complete.\nMeanwhile the Psycho-Medical Society ^ has done, and is doing,\nmuch to spread enlightenment. But the advance, even within the\nmedical profession, is still confined to a comparatively narrow circle,\nas was shown by the recent discussions of faith-healing in the\nmedical press; and since experts in hypnotism are not\u2014speaking\ngenerally \u2014recognised by the profession as are experts in other\nbranches, it is still difficult for the ordinary medical practitioner to\nfind out where to apply for reliable information on the subject. Dr.\nWingfield's book will, we think, help to remove this difficulty by its\nclear, scientific and moderate statement of what has been attained,\nwhile its hopeful though sober view of possible developments should\nrouse interest in all who care for the progress of the healing art.\nHe gives a brief description of the main methods of hypnosis\nused by some of the most famous operators of the present day,\nexplaining to what types of patients and what kinds of disorders\nthey are likely to be best suited ; and describes some of the typical\nphenomena of hypnotism, illustrating them from his own experiments.\nThe medical aspect is only briefly considered, but this chapter has\nan interesting reference to the work of Freud, which is now attracting\nso much attention. It indicates further the types of cases that are,\nand those that are not, likely to benefit from hypnotic treatment.\nThe thorny subject of the dangers of hypnotism is dealt with in an\n^Formerly called \"The Medical Society for the Study of Suggestive Thera-\npeutics,\" the foundation of -which was announced in the Journal for January,\nJ 907.\n\f16 J-owrnul of ^Society for Psychical Research.

Other influences in addition\nto the special form of treatment are often required. Many patients\n\"owe their troubles to their unhealthy manner of life. Work they\nregard as an evil to be avoided as much as possible, and when they\nare sufficiently wealthy to be independent of it, . . . they have no\nregular occupation of anj- kind except pleasure-seeking. . . . Their\none hope of lasting cure lies in work and contact with the realities\nof life.

Veridical Dream.\nThk following account was sent to ns by Major Nelson :\nThe Manor House, Stoke D'Abernon,\nSurrey, Avgust 29th, 1910.\nPlaying golf last week I happened to mention to my opponent, a\nmember of the Psychical Research Society, a strange incident that\noccurred to me last Xmas Eve, or rather in the early hours of\nXmas Day.\nI ought to tell you that I never dream. I believe as a child\nI had nightmares like other children, but since then a dream has\nbeen to me an unknown quantity.\nWith this knowledge you will understand why Avhat occurred last\nXmas made so deep an impression. The whole of that day and the\nnext my mind was obsessed by the incident, but I kept it entirely\nto myself.\nOn the morning of the 27th I dreamed again, and at dinner the\nsame night the conversation turned upon dreams. Then for the\nfirst time I communicated my strange experiences to two ladies\nsitting on either side of me, Mrs. Rowan Hamilton, of Killyleagh\nCastle, Co. Down, and her niece by marriage, Mrs. Sidney Rowan\nHamilton.\nOn the 28th I wrote to Mr. Sandwith, the Rector of St. Bar-\ntholomew's, Smithfield, whom I had not seen for some considerable\ntime, and asked him if he had been worried about some child. He\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt. Feb., 1911.\nreplied by coming down to Stoke, and was amazed when I told him\nwhat had occurred, and proceeded to tell me what had been going\non in his parish.\nThere is no possible explanation of how I could liave been cog-\nnizant of the fact that Mr. Sandwith had been worried, for I had\nnever heard of the child or of the German.\nHis letter was written after his visit in reply to my question,\nand at my request he wrote setting forth the particulars. I enclose\nthe orio-inal documents. a \u2022\n\u00b0 A. Nelson, Major.\nP.S. \u2014I am, or rather was, by no means well acquainted with the\npassage from Scrijiture; yet it is verbatim correct.\nMajor Nelson sent us witli this letter the original records\nhe had made of his two dreams at the time, vi'hich were as\nfollows :\nThe Manor House, Stoke D'Abernon,\nSurrey, Xmas Day, '09.\nLast night I dreamed a dream so strange and vivid that I wisli\nto record the occurrence while I can remember the details.\nI dreamed that I was in the drawing-room of 12a, Chartei'honse\nSquare, alone. Suddenly the door opened and Sandwith came in\nand said: \"Look here. Nelson, you can help me\u2014I wish you would\ncome\u2014I am terribly distressed about this j^oor child, a soldier's\nchild too.\" I got up and followed him to the dining-room. He\nknelt down at the table and motioned me to kneel beside him.\nThen he said, \" Now, I want you to repeat every word I say after\nme.\" I cannot remember the exact words, but the gist was that\nGod would intervene to save some child\u2014whether from danger or\ndeath I know not\u2014for I cannot recall the words.\nSuddenly Sandwith stopped speaking English, and began to pray\nin German. I was unable then to repeat his words, for I know no\nGerman, and as I was telling him so, I awoke. T.-r\n'\no >\nNelson.\nDec. 27fh, '09.\nI have had another dream of startling significance, and record it\nat once.\nI dreamed that I asked myself what could possibly be the mean-\ning of so extraordinary a request on Sandwith's part.

Case. 19\nMr. Sandwith, after visitinp; Major Nelson and hearing of\nhis dream, sent him the following statement of the circum-\nstances, which he forwarded to us\n:\n12a Charterhouse Square, E.G.,\nDec. 30, '09.\nHere are the particulars. I have for a fortnight or so before\nChristmas been considerably worried over the marriage of a German,\nnot a naturalized Englishman, to a girl in this Parish.\nI spoke to the girl's father about it, and wrote to the Bishop\nof London asking whether the production of a licence would\nguarantee the validity of the marriage, if the contracting parties\neventually resided in Germany.\nThe Bishop said he thought so, but that I had better go to\nDoctors' Commons and state the facts, in case they had overlooked\nthe point of the man not being a naturalized Eng'lishman.\nI asked the father of the girl to accompany me, but he said\nhe felt satisfied. This added considerably to my worry, as I felt\nhe was the proper person to safeguard his daughter's future, and\nany interference on my part was a delicate matter. As the Bishop's\nletter was addressed to me personally through his Chaplain, \"you\nhad better go to Doctors' Commons,\" I regarded it as a personal\ndirection from my Bishop and went, and asked for a written\nstatement from the Chancellor of the Diocese that all was in order.\nThis I duly received, and the marriage was solemnized on\nChristmas Day at 10.20 a.m.\n^\\. F. G. Sandwith.\nWe have also received from Mrs. Eowan Hamilton, of Killy-\nleagh Castle, County Down, the following statement\n:\nNov. 9, 1910.\nWith reference to your letter dated 29th Oct., 1910, to Major A.\nNelson regarding the dream described by him, I wish to corroborate\nhis statement to you dated 29th August, 1910.\nLiNA PtOWAN Hamilton.\nA similar statement has been received from Mrs. Sidney Eowan\nHamilton, to whom Major Nelson also spoke of his dream.\nIn reply to questions tending to elicit what normal causes\nmight have produced the dream, Major Nelson states that he\nhad never helped Mr. Sandwith in any way in his parochial\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., mi.\nwork. He also says that Mr. Sandwith assured him that he\nhad not thought of him in connection with his difficulty.\nHe adds\n:\nNov. 4, '10.\nThe only connection that I can conceive between the fact of Mr.\nSandwith's being worried and my dream is the existence of some\nlines on the subject of prayer written in a iriend's Prayer Book,\nwhich I sent to Mr. Sandwith, before writing them in the book, to\nask whether the theology was sound, in September, 1909.\nThis statement of Major Nelson's is of psychological interest\nas possibly throwing light on the mechanism of the dream.\nIt seems as if the telepathic impulse had been the primary\ncause of the dream ; that the thought of the German and\nMr. Sandwith thus telepathically aroused had called up, through\na normal process of association of ideas with the latter, the\nadditional notion of prayer, and that the three conceptions\nwere combined into the dream idea of Mr. Sandwith reciting a\nprayer in Gierman.\nKEPOPtT ON A FURTHER SERIES OF SITTINGS\nWITH EUSAPIA PALLADINO AT NAPLES.\nI.\nGeneral Repokt.\nBy the Hon. Evekaed Feilding and W. Markiott.\nNaples, Dcccmher 5fh, 1910.\nWrrii a view to attempting to confirm either the favourable\nreport on Eusapia Palladino issued by Messrs. Feilding,\nBaggally and Carrington, published in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.\n(Part LIX., November, 1909), or the unfavourable one by\nMr. W. S. Davis in the American S.P.R. Journed for August,\n1910, a short series of five sittings was held in Naples in\nNovember and December, 1910. The sitters were as follows:\nSeances I. and II. \u2014Count and Countess Perovsky-Petrovo-\nSolovovo and Mr. Feilding.\nSeance III.\u2014Count Solovovo, Mr. W. Marriott, Mr. Feilding.\n\u201e IV.\u2014As in No. III. and Countess Solovovo.\nV.\u2014Mr. Marriott and Mr. Feilding.\nAt Stance I. the control was at the time considered so\nunsatisfactory that, although fraud was not specifically proved,\n\fi\"EB., 1911. Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. 21\nneither Count Solovovo nor Mr. Feilding is disposed to attach\nany evidential importance to the few small phenomena which\noccurred.\nSeance II. was the only one at which, with the possible\nexception of table levitations, any phenomena of the slightest\ninterest occurred. They were, however, of so insignificant a\ncharacter that, especially in the light of the possible fraud at\nthe first Seance, and the undoubted fraud in the last three,\nnone of the three sitters is disposed to draw any positive\nconclusions. Seances III., IV., and V. were in the opinion of\nall those present unquestionably mainly, and in the opinion\nof Mr. Marriott wholly, fraudulent. The medium evaded\nthroughout any effective control, frequently making it impossible\nfor the sitter on her left side to prevent her from releasing\nher left hand or foot, and took advantage of this to make\nconstant use of thetn, as well as of her elbow, for the\nproduction of spurious phenomena. Such phenomena con-\nsisted of (1) .shaking movements of the curtain, throwings of\nit over her shoulder, surreptitious pulliugs at it with her hands\nor elbow, kickings at it with her feet. (2) Touches with her\nleft foot on her neighbours. (3) Upsetting of the cabinet table\nwith her elbow. (4) Moving of a chair with her foot. (5)\nLifting of the cabinet table with her hand after effecting its\nrelease,\u2014not by substitution, but merely by removing it from the\nback of the controller's hand, this position being the only form\nof control she would usually permit. As regards this last effect^\nit may be added that though Messrs. Feilding and Marriott\ndistinctly saw the movement of the medium's hand and arm\nagainst a background of luminous paint, Countess Solovovo,\nwho was controlling the hand in question on the table and\nunder the curtain, had the distinct impression of its continuous\ngrasp. Count Solovovo is inclined to consider the hypothesis\nof some abnormal suggestive influence on the part of the medium\nto account for this impression.\nWith this tentative exception, all the sitters are agreed\nthat the whole of the above-named phenomena were entirely\nfraudulent. As regards the table movements, consisting, in the\nlast three seances, of only one total and two partial levitations,\nMr. Marriott is strongly of opinion that these also were\nfraudulent, inferring from the position of the hands that they\n\f22 Journcd of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., I9ii.\nwere accomplished by a balance of the table between the left\nhand and foot, and by an upward throw of her (E. P.'s) fingers\nrespectively. Mr. Feilding, who was actually observing the\nhands at the time, disputes the conclusion that these actions\ndid, in fact, take place, but is not disposed to lay any stress\nupon a few phenomena sporadically occurring among others of\nan unquestionably fraudulent character. He is further of\nopinion that the table movements were the only phenomena\nwhich in any way resembled the occurrences at the former\nNaples series of experiments, and states that the conditions of\ncontrol permitted were wholly different from those permitted\nin that series.\nThe seances in question appear identical with the seances\ndescribed by Mr. Davis. The medium pleaded illness and\nfatigue throughout, and although it had been intended to hold\na series of ten or twelve seances, it was not thought worth\nwhile to continue any longer in the circumstances.\nAt the termination of the series Eusapia was informed of\nthe negative conclusions which had been arrived at and of the\nspurious nature of the phenomena which had been presented.\nWhile not disputing the justice of these conclusions, she stated\nthat she had no recollection of anything that transpired after\nthe close of the table movements which usually occupy the\nfirst part of her sittings, after which the light is reduced for\nother phenomena. She pleaded her state of health as an\nexcuse for her failure to give satisfaction. She nevertheless\naccepted her full fee.\nIT.\nStatement by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nDecember, 1910.\nWhilst substantially agreeing with the above report, I feel\nbound to make the following reservations and observations\n:\nWith regard to Seance II. some of the things which happened\nimpressed me favourably. I was twice touched on my right\nside ; a little table in the \" cabinet \" was suddenly and violently\noverturned ; and one of the objects which then fell off it\nmoved along the floor for a very appreciable period of time.\nThe hand and foot control seemed to me very satisfactory ;\nat\nleast we repeatedly said so at the time, and 1 wrote so in my\n\fFeb., 1911. Farther Sittings tvith Eusapia Palladino. 23\nnotes the day after. I think in such incidents it is the im-\npression felt at the time of the occurrence (I am spealving of\nexperienced enquirers only) which must really count\u2014not the\none produced by subsequent unfavourable circumstances (unless\nrevealing sources of error hitherto unsuspected), or even merely\n\" as time goes on.\" Of course into my expressed conviction\nof the efficacy of the hand-control there entered even at the\ntime an appreciable element of uncertainty due to the fact that,\nas usual, E. P. did not allow her hand to be grasped (I will\nrevert to this point). In my note on the sitting in question\nI say also that \" the conviction I here express . . . does not\napply to the possible hypothetical use of an apparatus.\"\nWith regard to Seance III. and the incident in connection\nwith mv wife controllino- it should be noted that at the time\nthe table was lifted up as if by Eusapia's hand, lier right hand\ntvas linked with F.'s on. the table imcovered and dimly visible (as\nstated in my note written out on the next day), whereas her\nleft was under th.e curtain (also upon the table) and invisible.\nOur impression at the time (as expressed by F.) was that\nsubstitution was impossible \" (see my next day note). And to\nquote my wife's words in her written statement (made the\nnext day) :\n\" I positively deny having lost contact with E. P.'s\nhand a single moment durino; the incident described.\"\nI may mention that before our sittings had begun I had\nsaid to Mr. Feilding that it seemed to me very desirable to\nmake some decisive step in advance with regard to the con-\nditions of the \" phenomena,\" and in view of all the doubts\nand discussions to which the question of hand-holding with\nE. P. gives rise, I suggested tliat we should \" count\" only\nthose \" phenomena \" which should occur tvith at least one of\nthe medium's hands visible. Neither of us seemed afterwards\ninclined to adhere unreservedly to so high a standard ! But\nin the incident under consideration we seem to have come\nwithin measurable distance of it ! And thoufrh the unavoidable\nlack of information as to certain particulars\u2014for instance as\nto the exact distance separathig Eusapia's two hands\u2014is much\nto be regretted, this occurrence has on the whole seemed to\nme to be very instructive and tending to give support to the\ntheory that a \" medium \" is occasionally able\u2014whether con-\nsciously or unconsciously\u2014to induce in the person controlling\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1911.\nhim something like a tactile hallucination, for which view\nthere is to my mind very strong evidence on record in the\n\"chair-threading\" experiments with Samhor.^\nWith regard to the table movements, I agree with Mr.\nFeilding in thinking most of them inconclusive ; but I con-\nsider that one partial table-levitation (away from Eusapia) which\nwe witnessed at the end of the third sitting, in a bright\nlight, three persons (Mr. Feilding, Mr. Meeson, the stenographer,\nand myself) controlling E. P. and Mr. Marriott looking on, was\nrather remarkable, and I thought it difficult at the time to\nadmit that Mr. Marriott's explanation (as given in the report)\ncould be the true one. I may add that from what he told me\nI inferred that he had not actually seen E. P. throw up the table\nwith her fingers, but had concluded that this was her method.\nOn the whole, and though I am by no means absolutely\ncertain that any table movements and levitations we witnessed\nwere genuine, I think that here is matter for further investi-\ngation. The conditions under which these things occur make\nme think that they are or may be suitable for scientific\nenquiry and I hope they may be investigated again. Even an\nexposure of E. P.'s levitations so extremely damaging to her\nmediumistic reputation as W. S. Davis's does not explain\neverything, and gives us no right whatsoever to answer the\nquestion definitely in the negative.\nOn the other hand, E. P.'s \" cabinet phenomena,\" as I\nhave witnessed them (both in Naples in 1910 and in St.\nPetersburg in 1898), have left me under the impression\nthat here matters ought to be seriously mended before we in-\nvestigate them further. I agree with Mr. Marriott in thinking\n^ These experiments (at least those made with this special aim by myself and\nmy friends) have absolutely convinced me that either passage of matter\nthrough matter is a fact, or that a medium's hand, even when very well held\n(not in the least as Eusapia's hands are), can liberate itself, and afterwards\nreturn to its original position without the controller becoming aware of it.\nAnd after some conversations I had on the subject with Mr. Marriott (an\nexpert in conjuring) I am even more than before inclined to see in this \"chair-\nthreading\" some unusual form of \"supernormal suggestion,\" and shall not\nbelieve this to have been a trick in the ordinary sense of the word until I\nhave been shown the same thing by a regular conjurer.\nOn the other hand, I still maintain that we have no good evidence whatever\nof the possible production of collective hallucinations at spiritistic seances,\nvisual or other (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXI., pp. 436-482).\n\fFeb., 1911. Further Sittings tvith Eusapia Palladino. 25\nthat the hand control she usually admits when such \" pheno-\nmena \" occur is practically non-existent. She thi'ows every\nobstacle in the way of this hand control. In my experience,\nat least, she constantly objected to my holding even her thumb\nor her little finger. She constantly complained of my squeez-\ning her hand too much. She insisted on her hands being\ncovered (with the curtain), and even asked that they should\nbe brought nearer to one another, and this at the most\nsuccessful sitting of the series,\u2014the 2nd \u2022\nThe hand-sub-\nstitution I noticed repeatedly. Apart from this, she constantly\nchanges the respective positions of her limbs\u2014both feet and\nhands. The latter especially are a regular perijctuum mobile.\nNow this circumstance is extremely important, for as tlie\nconditions of the control are perpetually and ceaselessly\nchanging, illusions of memory as to the exact conditions under\nwhich something occurred are eminently apt to spring up.\nOf course the presence of a shorthand writer will to a great\nextent eliminate this source of error ;\nbut, seeing that no\nshorthand writer was present at the great majority of obser-\nvations in the case of E. P., my present impression is that the\ngreat bulk of the evidence re her \" cabinet-phenomena \" is of\nno decisive importance.\nIn my experience, then, with such control as E. P. admits,\ncomplete conviction in the trice sense of the word is strictly speahing-\nunattainable. And what, I ask, is the use of \" relative convic-\ntion \" like the one, say, I felt as to the efficacy of the control\nat Seance II. ? The fact that I had this impression at the\ntime is interesting ; but it does not carry us one step further.\nAt most we are driven to the \" supernormal suggestion \" theory.\nAt future scientific stances E. P. must either allow her hands\nto be plainly visible to all, or allow them to be grasped (as\nSambor invariably did, as I have said, during the experiments-\nwith the \" chairs,\" thus giving something amounting to absolute\nconviction). The foot-control, in which she places her foot\nupon that of her neighbour, should also be done away with.\nThese demands are eminently reasonable. It is simply prepos-\nterous to assert that they could act negatively on the \" pheno-\nmena.\" Enough time, money and work has already been spent,\nand strictly speaking to no avail. A new departure must be\nmade at last.\n\f26 Journal of Society fur Psychical Research. Feb., 1911.\nIf E. P. consents to the above conditions, well and good\n;\nif she does not, she must either be left alone ; or\u2014a course\nof action I should recommend\u2014in future experiments we should\nno longer investigate the \" cal)inet-phenomena \" themselves, hut\nthe conditions of tJic control at the time sticlh ''phenomena \" are\noccurring. Any \" manifestations \" taking place with both of\nE. P.'s hands invisible (supposing they are controlled as un-\nsatisfactorily as they are now) should not be taken into account\nat all. And particular attention should be given to making\nclear whether anything will happen with either one or hotli, of\nthe medium's hands risihle. In the former case we shall\nhave to give full weight to the \" supernormal suggestion\n\"\ntheory ; and only in the latter \u2014if positive results are obtained\n\u2014shall we really have to face the hypothesis of a new \" physical\nforce\" and the like. If, on the contrary, after a new series\nof experiments it is clearly shown that no \" cabinet-phenomena\n\"\noccur when both the medium's hands are visible, this negative\nconclusion will be also very important and will make it\nprobable that in former experiments too we need not look\nbeyond errors of observation, illusions of memory, etc. (coupled\nperhaps sometimes with some kind of \" suggestion \") to account\nfor the most puzzling of Signora Palladino's performances.\nOf course the question of the foot-control too is of vital\nimportance, since I, for my part, have little doubt, that the\nmedium's feet may more than once have played a fundamental\npart in \" spirit \" touches and grasps.\nIII.\nDetailed Account of the Table-Lifting Incident.\n(\u00ab) Extract from Mr. Feilding's Notes on Stances\nIII. and IV. {November 26 and 28, 1910.)\nDecember 1, 1910.\nIn the course of the two s\u00ab^ances the \" phenomena \" pro-\nduced consisted of a few raps of doubtful origin, apparently\nnofc in the table ; a few slides of the table of about an inch\nat a time, not shown to be fraudulent but under unsatisfactory\nconditions ;\nan upsetting of the cabinet table to all appearances\naccomplished by [E. P.'s] elbow; bulgings of the dress (quite unlike\n\fFeb., 1911. Further Sittings with Easapia Palladino. 27\nany bulgings which 1 have previously seen) and apparently\ndone with the foot ; a few movements of the curtain clearly\nseen to have been done with the hand after substitution had\nbeen effected; a movement of a chair close to tlie medium,\nevidently done by the foot after substitution had actually been\nnotified ; and the lifting of the cabinet table clearly seen by\nMarriott and myself against a card of luminous paint to have\nbeen done with the hand controlled by Countess Solovovo.\nAlso one total and two or three partial levitations, as to which\nthere is a difference of opinion between Marriott and the rest\nof us. It would be absurd to lay stress on small matters of\nthis kind following on a series of purely fraudulent phenomena.\nThe chief point of interest is the lifting of the cabinet table\nvisibly by Eusapia's hand, notwithstanding that the Countess\ninsisted on her not having lost control of the hand in question.\nNo substitution had been effected, her right hand being visible\nin mine, and the only apparent alternatives are either the\nformation of a tluidic hand on Countess Solovovo's (a theory\nput forward by Cavaliere Chiaja) to lift the table ; or else a\nmere lapse in her observation. Taking the case on its own\nmerits, the latter is of course the more reasonable assumption.\n(h) Note on Seaxce of November 28, 1910.\nBy Count Solovovo.\nNuvemhcr 29 fh, 1910.\nMy wife controlling all the time on E. P.'s left, E., Mr.\nMarriott, Meeson, then E. again on her right.\nThe seance may be safely put down as\u2014to say the least\u2014of\nan extremely suspicious character throughout, with, however,\none exception. At a certain moment when an attempt was\nbeing \" mediumistically \" made to pick up something in the\ncabinet from the floor, E., who was controlling E. P. on her\nright, saw against a luminous background E. P.'s left arm pro-\nducing the movement. Mr. Marriott, who was under the table\nholding E. P.'s feet, saw the same thing. The medium's right\nhand, linked with E.'s, was on the table uncovered and dimly\nvisible. The medium's left hand, which my wife controlled,\nwas also upon the table, but covered with part of the curtain.\nOn E. asking my wife whether she had not let E. P.'s hand\ngo, she emphatically denied it, stating that E. P., though not\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., I9ii.\nallowing her to hold her hand all the time in the proper sense,\ndid not withdraw it for a single moment, and repeatedly\nclutched at it.\nAs F. said at the time, substitution was impossible. I also\ndimly saw E. P.'s right hand linked with his over or on the table.\nMy wife's conviction that at the time she had not released\nthe medium's hand was absolute. But it is of course possible\nthat after being told over and over again by that cleverest of\nconjurers, Mr. Marriott, that she was mistaken, she may feel less\ncertain about the matter. But we should not allow such\nsuggestions to work\u2014whether one way or the other ; and in\njustice to E. P. my wife's original and complete conviction\nshould be put on record.\n(c) Note by Countess Solovovo.\nNovemher 29th, 1910.\nI positively deny having lost contact with Eus. P.'s hand a\nsingle moment during the incident described, and, as my hand\nwith her left one was under the curtain, on the table, whereas\nher right was visible, though it is true very dimly, and held\nby F., and not near enough to mine to touch me with it, she\nwas not able to make one of her hands do duty for two.\n[In reply to questions, the following further details of the\nincident were sent to us by Countess Solovovo.\u2014Ed.]\nJanuary IQtli, 1911.\n(1) I was holding E. P.'s hand very lightly, because she\ncomplained of being squeezed too tightly each time I tried to\nhold her hand fully in mine, and most of the time she had\nher hand on my hand and pressed it very strongly each time\na movement occurred, or was patting it, but not for a second\ndid I lose contact with it ; and when Mr. Feilding said :\n\" She\nis using her hand, because I saw it clearly trying to lift up\nthe little table,\" I did not think he was speaking of the hand\n\/ held (I was so sure of having had it on mine all the\ntime), and when he told me I must have let it go, I posi-\ntively denied it, and up till now I am as sure as one can\nbe of anything that she did not use the hand that was in\nmine (or on mine). . .\n.\n\fFeb., 1911. Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. 29\n(2) Her hand was not motionless, for, as I said before, she\nmoved it about over mine, patted me, pressed my hand very\nstrongly sometimes, sometimes let me hold hers fully in mine,\nthen would turn my hand down and put hers over, but all\nthe time without taking it off' entirely ; and when her hand\nwas over mine, I several times turned my hand and felt with\nmy fingers if her fingers were on my hand, and each time I\nfelt them I tried to do the same thing with my thumb, and\nI felt also that it was the same hand I held all the time.\nOur hands were on the table and covered by the end of the\nleft part of the curtain.\n(3) My attention was all the time concentrated on holding\nher hand, as I was sure of her foot, Mr. Marriott controlling\nboth feet under the table. He told me a few days later\nthat most likely my attention had been too much concen-\ntrated on holding her hand, and that on account of the\ntension of my mind I had not remarked when she had\nslipped away from me ; but I am sure that if I had said\nmy mind had been quite free during the time I held her,\nand that I was not entirely and only occupied in observing\nthe hand I held, Mr. Marriott would have said I had been\n\" distraite,\" and had not remarked when Eusapia took away\nher hand.\nI think also that, had she taken away her hand for a\nshort time and afterwards brought it back again, I should\nhave felt a difference in my sensations before and after she\nhad removed her hand, whereas I felt no difference at all,\nand continued feeling her hand in or on mine.\nThe little table was not lifted on to the table we sat at\n(as far as I remember, perhaps I am wrong); it seems to me\nit was lifted behind tlie curtain and then fell down again.\nBut it was only Mr. Feilding and Mr. Marriott who could see\nwhat was going on behind the curtain ; I could not, as I was\nnot sitting facing the opening in the middle of the curtain,\nbut just behind it ; that is, the left half of the curtain was\nopened in the middle, near E. P.'s head and shoulder, and, as\nI was sitting on her left-hand side, I could not see what was\ngoing on inside the cabinet unless 1 bent very much forward,\nand at that moment I was absorbed only in attending to the\nhand I held.\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1911.\nMy impression is that she did not use her left hand in\nlifting the little table, and during all the sitting it seemed to\nme she was trying very hard to move the objects, but not\nwith her physical hands, but with some inner power, and she\nseemed to suffer and to be very tired each time something\nhad moved.\nI think this is all I remember of the sitting ; it is very\nincomplete, but I have a very bad memory for details, and\nremember only my impressions.\nBarbara Perovsky-Soloyovo.\nIV.\nComments on the Above.\nBy Alick Johnson.\nCountess Solovovo's careful and detailed description of her\nsensations during this incident seems to me to show clearly that\nit was not, as Mr. Feilding suggests, through any \" mere lapse\nin her observation \" that she let Eusapia's hand go ; while\nthe fact that the hand had somehow become free was proved\nby the joint observations of Mr. Feilding and Mr. Marriott.\nA lapse of attention or observation is a thing that frequently\noccurs in ordinary life ;\neverybody must be familiar with the\nexperience of failing to notice an object directly within his\nview when he is thinking of something else. In some cases this\nmay almost amount to what is called a \" negative liallucination.\"\nBut this is quite different from what Countess Solovovo\ndescribes. Instead of failing to notice the presence of an\nobject, she had a clear perception of its presence while it was\nabsent : that is, she had a distinct and full-blown positive\nhallucination or illusion, lasting evidently for a perceptible\nperiod of time.\nI am especially interested in this, because I have long\nbeen convinced that a similar experience happened to me\nduring my second sitting with Eusapia at Cambridge in\n1895. On that occasion Eusapia was standing up, Mr.\nMyers standing on one side and holding her right arm and\nhand, and I on the other side holding her left arm and hand,\nmy right arm being interlaced with her left. The two other\npersons present were sitting on the floor behind her, so as to\nsee her dimly outlined against the white ceiling, the room\n\fFeb., 1911. Farther Sittings ivith Easapia Palladiiw. 31\nbeing extremely dark The.se witnesses saw an elongated\nobject proceeding from her body, moving about and often\nchanging in shape and length. It was too dark for them to\nsee how it was attached to her, or how the controllers were\nholding her ; but if her left arm had got free, it could easily\nhave executed all the movements, and in doing so would have\npresented just the appearance they described. The evidence\nthat the arm was not free depended solely on my conviction\nthat I was holding it. I was certain at the time that I was\nholding it ; but later, in view not only of the systematic\nfrauds discovered, but also of my observations of various illu-\nsions experienced at these sittings, I became convinced that\nmy impressions as to holding her arm on that occasion were\npurely hallucinatory.\nThe evidence for this is, of course, not so clear as in Countess\nSolovovo's case, since at the Cambridge sitting it was too dark\nfor the witnesses actually to see whether the elongated object\nwas Eusapia's arm or not ; and as they supposed at the time\nthat I was holding the arm, they took the object to be\nsomething else. At the Naples sitting there was more light,\nfor the background was of luminous paint instead of an ordinary\nwhite-washed ceiling, and here the arm that lifted the small\ntable was seen to be attached normally to Eusapia's left shoulder.\nIf it had been too dark to see this, the sitters would probably\nhave regarded the movement as supernormally performed, on\nthe strength of Countess Solovovo's conviction\u2014apparently so\nwell founded\u2014that she was holding Eusapia's left hand.\nIn my paper \" On the Education of the Sitter \" {Proceedings,\nVol. XXL, pp. 483-511) I brought forward evidence derived\nfrom various different sources in support of the hypothesis\nthat some mediums have an unusual power of imposing illusions\nand hallucinations on their sitters, and that this may account\nfor some of the most remarkable records of apparently telekinetic\nphenomena. The case described above tends to confirm this\nhypothesis. It does not, of course, explain all the phenomena\nreported on good evidence to have occurred in the presence of\nEusapia ; but it suggests that those which depend ibr their\nauthenticity on the testimony of one witness as to the control\nexercised\u2014and a considerable proportion of the best cases come\nunder this definition\u2014must be seriously discounted.\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb.,1911.\nV.\n\u2022\nNote on the Report. \u2022\n_\nBy W. W. BaCxGally.\nI should like to make a few remarks on the above Eeport.\nBoth the American sittings and those lately held with Eusapia\nPalladino differ materially in many respects, but principally in\nthe following, from those held by Mr. Feilding, Mr. Carrington\nand myself in Dec. 1908. In the American and in the\nrecent Naples sittings no phenoinena were obtained under the\nfollowing conditions :\n\" when both the medium's hands were\ndistinctly visible away from or quietly resting on the seance\ntable, or both hands clearly seen when being held by the\ncontrollers and at the same time her body was in view down\nto her feet.\" In these cases the supposition that the phenomena\nwere produced fraudulently through the substitution or release\nof one of her hands or feet could not be entertained.\nIt was the phenomena under the above test conditions,\nwhich we obtained at our seances in Dec. 1908, that greatly\nimpressed me, and I laid particular stress on them (and gave\nsome examples) in my final note in the Eeport of our Naples\nsittings. So far I have not met with any satisfactory explana-\ntion of how Eusapia could have produced these phenomena by\nnormal means. It is certain that no accomplice was present,\nand we had satisfied oui'selves by examination that no apparatus\nwas being used.\nI am afraid I cannot accept Miss Johnson's theory that\nEusapia possesses the power of inducing a continuous halluci-\nnation of the sense of touch in tlie minds of her sitters.\nExperienced investigators are well aware that a temporary\nhallucination of this nature can be induced when a medium's\nhand is surreptitiously removed for a moment from the con-\ntroller's hand. We were unceasingly on our guard against\nsuch an occurrence at our Naples sittings. It should be noted\nthat Mr. Feilding states that the conditions of control permitted\nin the recent sittings were wholly different from those permitted\nin the former Naples sittings. In a letter that I have received\nfrom Mr. Feilding, he says :\n\" Everything this time was different\n[from our previous seances] and exactly like the reports given\nof the American conjurers' sittings.\"\n\fNo. CCLXXVII.\u2014Vol. XV.

Arthur Smith in\nthe cliair.\nThe Chairman announced that Mr. Andrew Lang had been\nelected President of the Society for the year 1911.\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S., then read a paper on\n\" Poltergeists : Old and New,\" which will, it is hoped, be\npublished later in the Proceedings. The following is a summary\nof it:\nThe author remarked on the appropriate coincidence that\nthe announcement of Mr. Andrew Lang's acceptance of the\n\fMab., 1911. General Meeting. 37\nPresidency of the Society for the ensuing year synchronized\nwith the reading of a paper on a subject to which Mr. Lang\nhad devoted so much attention and historical research.\nThere was no exact English equivalent for Poltergeist, but\nas the German word foltcrcr meant a boisterous fellow, so\nfoltergdst was a boisterous ghost. It is a convenient term to\nexpress those apparently meaningless noises, disturbances, move-\nments of objects and ringings of bells (even when the wires are\nsevered) for which no assignable cause can be found. The\nphenomena are sporadic, breaking out unexpectedly, lasting a\nfew days or months and terminating as suddenly. They differ\nfrom hauntings, inasmuch as ghostly forms are not seen, and\nare associated not so much with a particular locality as with a\nparticular (and usually young) person in a particular room.\nThey appear to have some intelligence behind them, as response\nto a definite number of raps, or other sounds, asked for by\nthe investigator, can usually be obtained. The phenomena take\nplace equally well in broad daylight, under the searching gaze\nof investigators, or at night time. Of the genuineness and\ninexplicable nature of the phenomena there can be no manner\nof doubt, in spite of occasional attempts at their fraudulent\nimitation. This latter, the author pointed out, sometimes occurs\nafter the original phenomena have passed away, and usually\nwhen the psychic has been taken to a new locality.\nThe S.P.R. Journal for 1884, and the Proceedings for 1896\ncontain lengthy reports on \" Poltergeists,\" by the late Mr.\nPodmore, but these reports arrived, in the opinion of Professor\nBarrett, at contradictory conclusions, and hence the necessity\nfor a reconsideration of the whole subject.\nProfessor Barrett had been led to devote a considerable\ntime to the investigation of the subject owing to two remark-\nable cases of poltergeist occurring in Ireland, in one of which\nhe was a spectator of the phenomena, and in the other, a\nrecent case, he obtained the evidence of several trustworthy\neye-witnesses. This latter is\nTlic Enniscorthy Case.\nEnniscorthy is a town in Co. Wexford, and the phenomena\nbroke out in July, 1910, on the arrival of a young carpenter\nat some lodgings in the town. High testimony is borne to\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mak., I9ii.\nthe character and truthfulness of this young man, named J.\nEandall, by the rector of his parish, who had known him for\nseveral years. Eandall's account of the phenomena, which lie\nwrote at the request of the author, agrees with the evidence\nof two independent and intelligent eye-witnesses who were\npresent during part of the disturbances. Here the phenomena\ntook place after Eandall had retired to bed at night ; the bed-\nclothes were pulled off, a heavy bed dragged into the middle\nof the room, no one being near it, Eandall himself was lifted\noff the bed and deposited on the tloor in the presence of the\nwitnesses, a chair ran across the room, no one touching it,\nand loud knockings were heard in the room. These disturb-\nances continued for three weeks, until Eandall moved to another\nhouse, and have not recurred in his new lodgings.\nThe Dcrrygonnclly Case.\nDerrygonnelly is a hamlet some nine miles from Enniskillen,\nin the N.W. of Ireland. The phenomena here broke out in a\nsmall farmer's cottage in 1877, and consisted of objects being\nthrown down and out of the house, loud knockings, stones\ndropped in the room, etc. The author was able to visit the\nspot whilst the disturbances were in progress, and had the\nadvantage of two scientific friends who assisted him in the in-\nvestigation. No assignable cause could be found for the noises\nheard in their presence, though a careful watch was kept both\ninside and outside the cottage. In this case the knocks re-\nsponded to the given number requested, even when that number\nwas silently willed. A full report of these occurrences was\npublished by the author in the Dublin University Magazine\nfor December, 1877. The medium or centre of the disturbances\nwas in this case the eldest daughter of the farmer, a girl\nnearly 20 years old ; the phenomena ceased after two or three\nmonths.\nThe \" Atlantic Monthly \" Case.\nThis case, described in one of the best American Eeviews,\nthe Atlantic Montldy for August, 1868, is one of the most\nremarkable and evidential, if the testimony of the writer of the\narticle in the Atlantic Monthly is accepted. Here the pheno-\nmena broke out on the arrival of a young servant girl in the\nhouse of a family in Massachusetts, ceased when she was\n\fMar., 1911. General Meeting. 39\ntemporarily absent, returned on her return, and lasted some\nten weeks. The phenomena took place during the day, and\nalso in the bedroom at night, when the girl had retired to\nrest. They were such that she could not possibly have pro-\nduced them fraudulently. For instance, the bells of the house\nrang during the day repeatedly and for long periods, even\nafter the wires had been severed ; the clappers of the bells\nwere seen to be vigorously moving, no one touching them,\nand the bells suspended 11 feet above the floor. A heavy\nstone slab, no one touching it, was seen to rise off its\nsupport and fall back with such force as to break into\ntwo, and this in day-light under the eyes of witnesses,\nwhilst the servant girl was wringing out some clothes. Other\nstartling noises and movements of furniture occurred, and no\ndoubt whatever was left in the minds of the eye-witnesses of\nthe genuineness and inexplicable nature of the phenomena.\nProf. Barrett then briefly related the case of a poltergeist\noccurring on the Pacific coast at Portland, Oregon, fully detailed\nin the Journal of the American Society for Psycliiccd Rcsearcli\nfor September and November, 1910. Here, after the original\ndisturbances had ceased, and the psychic, a boy, had been\nmoved to another house, fraudulent imitation of the phenomena\noccurred, and the lad confessed to the fraud and even to some\nof the original disturbances. The confessions of children must,\nhowever, be received with caution, as shown in cases of children\naccused of witchcraft, where they often confessed to the per-\nformance of impossible feats, and were thereupon burnt to\ndeath.\nAmong historic cases the Cideville parsonage poltergeist,\n\u2022which occurred in 1850, is perhaps the best attested, the\namazing and voluminous evidence being given on oath at a\ntrial ; it is narrated in Dale Owen's Footfalls on the Boundary\nof Another World, as is also the famous Bealings bells case\nin Suffolk in 1834. The Epworth poltergeist at the Wesleys'\nparsonage in 1716, and the Tedworth poltergeist in 1661,\nwhen Mr. Mompesson's children were the nucleus of the\nphenomena, are well known, the latter being fully described\nand investigated by Glanvil, one of the earliest Fellows of the\nRoyal Society. A complete tabular statement of poltergeists\nold and new has been begun by the author. \u2022\n'\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., I9il.\nThe paper ends with a summary of the conclusions to which\nthe author had been led, the essentially weak, temporary and\nfugitive nature of the phenomena being pointed out. The dis-\nturbances resemble practical jokes by mischievous children in the\nunseen, and there are doubtless more such children there than\non earth. But no satisfactory explanation of the phenomena is\npossible at present ; our duty being to collect, scrutinize, and\nclassify evidential cases, and where possible promptly investi-\ngate the occurrences before they cease.\nEEPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1910.\nThe membership of the Society has, as usual, increased con-\nsiderably this year. 23 new Members were elected and 2\nAssociates became Members; 126 new Associates were elected\nand 4 Members became Associates. On the other hand, the\ntotal loss in numbers from deaths, resignations, and other causes\nwas 24 Members and 94 Associates, leaving a net increase of\n37. The total membership has now reached 1267, the numbers-\nbeing distributed as follows: Members, 301 (including 24\nHonorary and Corresponding Members); Associates, 966 (in-\ncluding 11 Honorary Associates).\nThe Society has suffered two great losses this year in the\ndeaths of Professor William James and Mr. Frank Podmore,\npapers in memory of whom, read at a recent meeting, will be\npublished in the next Part of the Proceedings.\nTwo Parts only of Procccdvnrjs were issued during the year, in\nMarch and August ; but their total bulk amounted to only a\nfew pages less than the three Parts issued last year. They\ngave the completed results of work, the progress of which\nwas referred to in last year's report, viz. accounts of Mr.\nDorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper in America, a second report on\nMrs. Holland's automatic writing, and Mrs. Verrall's paper on\na new group of automatic writers, the \"Macs.\"; also a report,,\nedited by Miss Verrall, of an earlier series of sittings with\nMrs. Piper, carried out under the supervision of Dr. Hodgson\nand completed only a few weeks before his death. The record\nof these sittings seems to constitute the most valuable part of\nthe voluminous material collected by Dr. Hodgson since his own\n\fMae., 1911. Report of the Council. 41\nlatest paper on Mrs. Piper, published in the Proceedings,\nVol. XIII.\nThe last Part of the Proccedvu\/s contained also Mr. H.\nArthur Smith's Presidential Address for tlie year, and a\nvaluable discussion of some of the recent developments in\npsychotherapy by Dr. Mitchell, to whom we are also indebted\nfor many of the \"Notes on Current Periodicals\" which appear\nfrom time to time in the Journal to inform our readers of\nimportant articles published elsewhere, bearing more or less\ndirectly on psychical research.\nThe general growth of work has made it necessary to add\nto the staff, and in June the Council appointed Miss Verrall\nas Assistant Eesearch Officer, the appointment to date from\nMichaelmas. Since then, Miss Verrall has, among other things,\nbeen occupied in organising some series of experiments, and\nhas helped in the investigation of cases by personal interviews\nwith the witnesses. She has further read papers on psychical\nresearch to two literary debating societies in London.\nMuch useful work of the latter kind has also been done by\nMr. Baggally, who during the year gave a lecture and read\nthree papers on Cross-Correspondences and other subjects ta\nvarious societies in Brighton. Mr. Baggally has also been\nindefatigable in rendering help in the investigation of some\ndifficult cases where expert assistance was especially wanted.\nMiss Miles and Miss Eamsden have been continuing the\nexperiments in thought-transference, which they have carried\non at intervals for some years, with each other and a few of\ntheir friends. Some of these were printed in the Journal for\nDecember, 1910, and we are hoping for further results in this\nimportant field.\nIt is interesting to note the extent to which psychical\nresearch is influencing contemporary thought all over the world.\nThus, a Turkish psychical review was founded about a year\nago, to which one of our Honorary Associates, M. Sage, was\nasked to contribute a sketch of the S.P.R. Slowly but surely\nalso its theories are permeating the more conservative field of\nEnglish science, as witness the serious and respectful treatment\nof the subject at the present day in such journals as Nature.\nThe medical profession too shows a growing appreciation of\nour work. Thus, the British Medical Journal for June 11th,.\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Mae., I9ii.\n1910, reports an address delivered to the Dorset and West\nHants Branch of the British Medical Association by its Presi-\ndent, Dr. T. F. Gardner, in which lengthy and emphatic\nreference was made to the great services rendered to psychology\nby the scientific treatment of it by the S.P.E.\nThe altered attitude of the profession is no doubt partly due\nto the efforts of the Psycho-Medical Society, some of the leaders\nof which were recruited from the ranks of our Council ; Dr.\nLloyd Tuckey having been elected as President in the first\nyear of its existence, Dr. Bramwell in 1908, and Dr. Mitchell\nin the current year (1911).\nBoth the production and the investigation of automatic scripts\nare steadily being continued, and some papers on the subject\nwill, it is hoped, shortly be published. Experience has shown\nthat it is necessary to study these scripts with great care\nand to compare them in a laborious and detailed way with\none another before their real significance can be made out.\nFor not only do later scripts often throw light on obscure\npassages in the earlier writings of the same automatist, but\nthe scripts of different automatists are sometimes found to-\nbe interrelated over a long period. The complicated nature\nof these cases and the variety of psychological factors involved\nmake it necessary to proceed with caution, and if the experi-\nments are interrupted by premature disclosure and hasty\npublication, much of their interest and value will inevitably\nbe lost. We hope that the results of the work will prove\nvalid for future generations as well as for ourselves ; but for\nthis they must be founded on the rock and not on the sand.\nSuch foundations cannot be hurried and must not be scamped.\nThe Account of Eeceipts and Expenditure for the year calls\nfor little remark. The total annual subscriptions\u2014our most\nimportant source of income\u2014amount to a little more than last\nyear. The legacy of \u00a3100 from Mr. Eobert Hannah was\nreceived this year. The sale of publications has slightly fallen\noiT in England but decidedly improved in America, with the\nresult that the total received is almost exactly the same as\nlast year. The Edmund Gurney Fund has, by resolution of\nthe Council, been merged in the general funds of the Society,,\nso that a separate account of it will no longer appear.\nOn the expenditure side we note a considerable increase in\n\fMab., 1911. Report of the Council. 45\nthe cost of printing\u2014about \u00a3116 more than last year\u2014which\nis the consequence of an increased literary output.\nSome welcome gifts to the Endowment Fund for Psychical\nEesearch have been received this year, as noted in the Account\nof that Fund, but it has not yet reached the point desired.\nTwo General and four Private Meetings of the Society (for\nMembers and Associates only) were held during the year.\nThe dates and subjects of the papers read were as follows\n:\n*January 31st. \"Seeing without Eyes,\" by Mr. Frank\nPodmore.\nMarch 15th. \"A Study in Hysteria and Double Person-\nality, with Eeport of a Case,\" by Dr. T.

Paris, 1908. 120 pp.\nDr. Viollet has set himself no easy task. Writing as an expert\nin mental diseases, he has attempted to set before the general\nthinking jniblic some account of certain mental disorders which he\nconsiders may be traced directly or indirectly to a belief in spiri-\ntualism or to taking part in spiritualistic seances.\nThe subject is approached in a broad-minded spirit, and hostile\ncriticism is disarmed by the author's sympathy with any scientific\ninquiry into supernormal phenomena, and by his willingness to\nadmit that there may be real facts underlying spiritistic theories,\nhowever grotesque. In the concluding paragraphs the author hopes\nthat the book will appeal to the conscientious inquirer; and there\ncan be no doubt that a knowledge of psychology, abnormal as\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae.,1911.\nwell as normal, is indispensable for any complete view of the\nwhole field of psychical research.\nDr. Viollet's description and classification of some of the types\nmet with at spiritualistic seances are in no way exaggerated.\nNothing is sadder than to see those who are mentally ill-equipped\nat best for the ordinaiy experiences of life, being specially attracted\nlike moths to a candle by the mysterious glamour of spiritualism^\nand coming away with their wings singed, more than ever unfitted\nto deal with objective realities.\nDr. Viollet j^oints out clearly why it is that occurrences at\nspiritualistic seances are of such danger to feeble types of mind\n;\nfor, from their very nature, such phenomena as rappings, phantasms,\nlevitations, Avhether or not fraudulent or hallucinatory, ^ produce\nsense impressions which come into consciousness without any apparent\nlogical sequence, i.e. apparently without any of the ordinary relation-\nships between cause and eff'ect which we are accustomed to expect in\nour ordinary perceptions of realities. The sitter may then jump to\nthe conclusion that he is surrounded by invisible and mysterious\nbeings with unlimited powers, who may at any moment produce\nresults of an entirely unpredictable and capricious kind. This\ncredulity and attitude of expectant attention, combined with emotional\nstress, may undoubtedly cause some dissociation of the higher cerebral\nfunctions, and thus lead to a breakdown of the reasoning and critical\npowers with which the sense perceptions are ordinarily interpreted.\nPassing from the consideration of spiritistic phenomena, Dr. Viollet\npoints out how a belief in spiritualistic doctrine may endanger the\nintegrity of the reason. He deals, indeed, chiefly with extreme forms\nof the doctrine, which are little, if at all, in vogue among English\nspiritualists. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the starting\npoint of insane delirium in many cases relates to spiritistic beliefs.\nDr. Viollet defines delirium as the holding of false ideas, but in\norder that a belief in false ideas can constitute an insane delirium\nit must also so afiect the conduct of the holder as to alter his\nrelations to objective realities.\nThe major portion of the book is taken up by classification and\ndescrij>tion of spiritistic insanities or insanities with spiritistic colour-\ning. From the alienist's point of view, however, the classification\n^ It is remarkable that in liis references to these phenomena the author\nmakes no attempt to discriminate between those for whose occurrence there is\nsome evidence, and those which are alleged to occur on the slightest possible\ngrounds, or have again and again been discovered to be fraudulent.\n\fMae., 1911. Notices of Books, etc. 47\nis open to criticism, and many of the illustrative cases are not of\ngreat value to the general reader.\nTwo clear warnings can nevertheless be drawn from the work under\ndiscussion. First, that the investigation of spiritistic phenomena is\ndangerous for any one of hysterical or psychasthenic constitution,\nand may cause such permanent mental dissociation as to constitute\nactual insanity. Secondl}', that some forms of actual insanity, notably\nparanoia or dementia proecox, may, through accidental circumstances,\nhave delusions or hallucinations of a spiritualistic nature. These cases\nare a danger not only to themselves, but also to others, if they are\nadmitted unawares into spiritualistic circles. It is very desirable\nthat they should not be encouraged, as they often are by well-\nmeaning but ignorant persons, to have to do with mediums.\nM. B. W.\nNew Evidences in Psychical Research. By J. Akthur Hill.\n(William Rider & Son, Ltd., London, IDIL 3s. 6d. net.)\nIn the opening sentence of his preface Mr. Hill remarks that \"it\nis desirable in the interests of psychical research that experiences\nof apparently supernormal nature should be put on record if they\nreach a fairly high evidential level.\" The greater part of his book\nconsists of some careful records of certain cases of this kind, which\nhave come under his own observation. They include various types\nof psychical phenomena, the most important contribution, both in\nquantity and quality, being the record of a series of sittings held\nby Mr. Hill himself and by various friends of his with Mr. Watson,\na professional medium. Mr. Watson is described as \"a ' normal\nclairvoyant ' who sees '\nspirit-forms,' describing them, giving names\nand various identifying details, and sometimes obtaining a con-\nsiderable amount of impressional or automatic script\"; he does not\ngo into trance. He knew the principal sitter, Mr. Knight (a\npseudonym) by his real name, Mr. Knight having written to make\nan appointment ; so far as was ascertained he knew nothing of\nthe other sitters, but there are several points in this connexion\nupon which Mr. Hill might with advantage have been more\nexplicit. It is not always clear, for instance, whether the sitters\nlived in the same town as the medium or in one which he was\naccustomed to visit. The communications received in these sittings\nconsist mostly of the names, age, place of habitation, etc., of various\nof the sitters' deceased relatives. The percentage of error is sur-\nprisingly small (these sittings, it seems, were above the level usually\n\f4S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., I9li.\nattained by the medium); name after name is given with hardly\na mistake. This absence of error, taken in conjunction with the\nfact that almost all the information is such as might by the\nexpenditure of sufficient labour be obtained by normal means, is\nundoubtedly a suspicious circumstance. On the other hand the\nsitters, though sceptically inclined, became convinced of the medium's\nhonesty ; he was never detected in any suspicious act ; it is not\neasy in some cases to see how he could have obtained the necessary\ninformation in the time and with the means at his disposal, and\nin other cases, judging from the details given, it seems hardly\npossible that he should have done so.\nIn discussing various explanations of these phenomena, Mr. Hill\nsays that he does not find the theory of thought-transference from the\nsitter wholly satisfying, and tentatively suggests the theory that\nthe mind of the medium is somehow put cn rapport with the person,\nalive or dead, about whom informatiou is given, by means of an\n\"object\" connected with that person, the \"object\" being sometimes\nthe sitter himself He mentions as an instance a case in which a\nmedical diagnosis, said to be accurate, was given by a trance medium\nfrom a lock of hair belonging to a patient about whose condition\nthe sitter knew nothing; he does not, however, state whether the\naccuracy of the diagnosis was corroborated by a medical man.\nIn the remaining chapters of the book, Mr. Hill records some\ninteresting cases of telepathy and veridical hallucinations. He also\nincludes \"a selection of cases giving an idea of recent S.P.R. in-\nvestigation,\" which he thinks will \" be useful to readers who have\nno time for the study of very length}^ reports.\" It is for such readers\nthat the book has been written, and it seems well adapted to\nthis purpose. H. DE G. V.\nThe \"Special Number\" of The Practitioner for January, 1911,\ndeals with the subject of Neurasthenia, and niany of our readers\nmay be interested in the article contributed by Dr. Lloyd Tuckey\non the \" Treatment of Neurasthenia by Hypnotism and Suggestion.\"\nThe disease is no doubt among those to which hypnotic or suggestive\ntreatment is especiall}' applicable, but unfortunately many patients\nonly seek it after they have tried everything else, and the more\nlong-standing is the case, the more difficult it is to cure. Neverthe-\nless, in the hands of skilled and experienced practitioners, a large\nnumber of cases have greatly benefitted. Dr. Tuckey gives a brief\naccount of several such in his own practice, explaining his methods\nand principles of treatment and urging other medical men to try the\neffect of it; for, he says, \"The good results I have gained, and perhaps\nbetter, are, I believe, attainable by any physician who will honestly\nand sympathetically make trial of hypnotism.\" His clear and\nmoderate statements add weight to this appeal, while his judicious\ncomments on various theories of suggestion, and in particular the\nstress he lays on the necessity for studying the psychological aspect\nof it, are interesting and instructive.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nPart LXII.\nERRATUM.\nOn p. 5, first line, for\n\"August 14th, 1901,\" read \"August 14th, 1910.\"\n\f1\n<\n]\n(\nT\n1\n(\n]\n1\nI\nc\nf\n\\\na\nI\nc\ns\nc\n\fNo. CCLXXVIII.\u2014Vol. XV.

OF PROCEEDINGS.\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\nThere are several striking things in the recent issue of the\nPi-occediwjs for March 1911. I will pick out two of them\nfor comment.\nOn page 43 there are seven sentences quoted by Professor\nPigou from Mrs. Verrall's script, all having some sort of\nreference, more or less direct, to Dr. Verrall's three Greek\nwords now commonly referred to among members of the S.P.E.\nas \" the one horse dawn.\" Wluit must strike anybody looking\nat those sentences is their apparently entire disconnexion from\neach other. If they had arrived through different automatists\nit would hardly have been possible to detect any connexion\nbetween them, and after it had been pointed out we could\nhardly have called it a cross-correspondence without a great\ndeal of emphasis on the word \" cross,\" and very little on the\nword \" correspondence.\"\nMr. Balfour indicates his perception of this fact at the\nbottom of page 48 ;\nbut the fact is so important as to be\nworthy of special attention. There is, I suppose we may say,\nan undoubted idea, or at least a unifying phrase, underlying\nall these fragments, yet not only would they be insufficient\nseparately to convey that idea, they fail to show that they\n\fApril, 1911. Notes on Part LXII. of Proceedings. 53\ncontain any common idea at all. Had they occurred in the\nscripts of separate automatists, in the customary way, they would\nhave been useless. I doubt if even a subsequent statement\nas to the underlying meaning would have sufficed to enable\nthe fragments to be picked out from a mass of other\nmaterial. Their fragmentary character is so complete that\nthe ingenuity of composing them would have been wasted\n;\nunless indeed, as is often the practice of our collaborators,\nsome clue or key-word, or other hint, had been associated\nwith each of the fragments, so as to enable them to be\nspecially picked out and subsequently compounded. The\nwhole discussion between Mr. Balfour and Professor Pigou is\nvery instructive from the point of view of a student of\nall such cryptic utterances, whose aim is to ascertain their\noriginating sources.\nThe other matter which excites my admiration is the\ningenious imitation of idea-conveying scripts, perpetrated by\nthe Piev. M. A. Bayfield on pages 85-87. In this excellent\nparody or parallel\u2014which surely is in every way legitimate\n\u2014\nthe idea latent in Mr. Bayfield's thought is expressed with\nwhat must be considered rather over-clearness for purposes of\na complex cross-correspondence, since the first four lines\nsupposed to be obtained by the first automatist suggested at\nonce the rats in Hamelin town botli to myself and to a\nfriend to whom I read those four lines. And a few lines\nfurther on the word \" Piper \" and subsequently the word \" Hamel \"\nclinch it. Hence, on the usual (overstrained) hypothesis,\ntelepathy from this first automatist to the others would have\nto be assumed ;\nthough indeed the others do not get it nearly\nso clearly.\nIt seems to me that this experiment of producing imitation\nscript is one which more of us ought to try, although it is\nunlikely that we could produce such good stuff as Mr. Bayfield\nhas produced. He speaks of being able to do it in five\nminutes, by abandoning all control of his thoughts. 1 have\njust tried myself to write three imitation scripts, such as might\nbe supposed to come through three different automatists, all\nbased upon a single idea which was not to be given clearly\nto any one of them and yet which was to be unmistakably\nthere when pointed out. The process of writing them, in my\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, I9ll.\ncase, can hardly be described as abandoning all control of my\nthouo'hts : I should describe it more like this. I sit in front\nof the fire with a pencil and pad, and keep one idea fairly\nbefore me, restraining it, however, from coming out too clearly,\nand not curbing but rather encouraging any side-issues or\nlateral deflexions of thought which may arise ; not referring\nto any book, of course, but merely jotting down reminiscences\ncarelessly and without any eftbrt to get them accurate.\nThe chief effort is not to get them too clearly ; the second\nis to allow and rather encourage wandering thoughts (this\nindeed is rather difficult) ; and third, to imitate roughly some\nof the familiar manner and ejaculations of authentic script.\nIt took me not five minutes but twenty minutes, and the\nresult is not at all brilliant. I ({uestion whether it is wortii\nprinting, but I append it because it enabled me to realise\nclearly the attitude of a hypothetical communicator attempting\nto convey in this manner an idea which in his mind was\n\u2022definite, but which he did not wish to express too clearly,\nand which could only be stated at all by selecting from such\nfragments of notions as semi-spontaneously cropped up in the\nminds he v\/as trying to influence ; the thoughts in that case\ngetting only too easily out of control because they would not\nbe his own thouglits at all but the thoughts of the several\nautomatists.\nAnd that brings me to the chief point of what I have to\nsay. Mr. Bayfield seems to think that the wanderings and\ndivarications in the scripts signify casual impulses of a sub-\nliminal self\u2014the subliminal self of the actual writer. I do\nnot of course know much about a subliminal self, but I suggest\nthat the vaguenesses and errors in script correspond very closely\nwith what we may imagine to be the difficulty of utilising\nand controlling another person's thoughts, in some telepathic\nmanner, for the purpose of conveying some idea which is not\nin his mind at all, and without putting it in his mind. The\ndifficulty of telepathic control of an automatist's hand, when\nthe automatist is not in the least entranced and has no idea of\nwhat is being communicated, must be very great ; and the\namount of wandering and vagueness and indistinct allusiveness\nwhich we perceive in real scripts seems to me entirely justified\nby the supposed and ostensible circumstances of the case.\n\fApril, 1911. Notcs on Part LXIL of Proceedings. 55\nMy three scripts, produced all at one sitting, are far too\ncoherent to be good imitations. If they are all to be produced\nthrough one person, they should be produced at different times,\nwhen that person was in different moods and amid different\nsurroundings. They would then have a better chance of\nbeing a fair imitation of the real thing ;\nthough even then\nthe method and design and difficulties are too artificial to\nbe satisfactory. The difficulties are self-constructed and not\nreal ones ; whereas in the production of real script\u2014on what\nis now my own working hypothesis in the Holland-Verrall\ncases\u2014where a surviving mind is trying to influence an alien\nterrestrial mechanism which is normally controlled by another\nmind, the difficulties are real.\nWith this prelude I subjoin the three imitation-scripts,\nthe result of my own mental activity.

Dual Personality in the Case of William Sharp. 57\nDUAL PERSONALITY IN TRK CASE OF\nWILLIAM SHARP.\nThe recently published Life of William Sharp (Fiona Macleod) ^\nby his wife, contains much of interest and instruction from a\npsychological point of view.\n\" My chief aim (says Mrs. Sharp in her preface) in writing\nabout my husband, and in giving a sketch of his life, has been\nto indicate, to the best of my ability, the growth and develop-\nment in his work of the dual literary expression of himself.\"\nIn two important respects the case differs from what is\ngenerally regarded as the normal type of multiple personalities :\n(1) The two personalities of William Sharp were in a sense\nco-ordinate : there was no clear and marked superiority\u2014either\nmoral or intellectual\u2014of one over the other, nor did the alter-\nnation between them appear to be associated with any\npathological element. Like most men gifted with genuine\nartistic powers, both were sensitive and highly strung; but\nneither seems to have shown any serious want of balance or\nof self-control. Both produced literary work of value ;\nthough\nFiona's far excels in originality and power of imagination.\n(2) The distinction between marked alternations of mood,\nwhich carry with them a greater or less degree of variation\nin character, and actual alternations of personality, is generally\nheld by psychologists to depend on whether or not there is a\nbreach of memory between the different mental states. Recent\nhypnotic work, however, such as that of Boris Sidis, is tending\nto throw doubt on these hard and fast distinctions and to show\nthat breaches in memory\u2014even if far-reaching in their effects\non character and action\u2014may be not an essential feature, but\nonly the result of training and suggestion. There was, at all\nevents, no breach of memory between William Sharp and Fiona\nMacleod, and the view that they were two personalities seems\nto turn on their own clear and unwavering impression that so\nit was\u2014an impression apparently never divorced from their\nbelief in their underlying unity.\n^ William Sharp (Fiona Macleod). A Memoir compiled by his wife,\nElizabeth A. Sharp. (William Heineiuann, London, 1910.)\n-A full and illuminating discussion of this subject is to be found in the\nchapters on \"Disintegrations of Personality\" and \"Genius,\" in F. W. H.\nMyers's Human Personality.\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, laii.\nThe whole case is well worth studying in full in the original. AVe\n\"ive here some extracts from the book to show its salient features.\n(P. 125.) During much of the .suffering and tedium of those long\nweeks [a serious illness which he went through in the spring of\n1886, being then in his 31st year] the sick man passed in a dream-\nworld of his own ; for he had the power at times of getting out\nof or beyond his normal consciousness at will. At first he imagined\nhimself the owner of a gipsy traveUing-van, in which he wandered\nover the to him well-known and rauch-ioved soHtudes of Argyll,\nresting where the whim dictated and visiting his many fisher and\nshepherd friends. Later, during the long crises of the illness, though\nunconscious often of all material surroundings, he passed through\nother keen inner phases of consciousness, through psychic and dream\nexperiences that afterward to some extent were woven into the\nFiona Macleod writings, and, as he believed, were among the original\nshaping influences that produced them. For a time he felt himself\nto be practically dead to the material world, and acutely alive \" on\nthe other side of things\" in the greater freer universe. He had\nno desire to return, and rejoiced in his freedom and greater powers;\nbut, as he described it afterward, a hand suddenly restrained him :\n\"Not yet, you must return.\" And he believed he had been \"freshly\nsensitised,\" as he expressed it; and knew he had\u2014as I had always\nbelieved\u2014some special work to do before he could again go free.\nThe illusion of his wanderings with the traveU'ing van was\ngreatly helped by the thoughtfulness of his new friend Ernest Rhys,\nwho brought him branches of trees in early leaf from the country.\nThese I placed upright in the open window ; and the fluttering\nleaves not only helped his imagination but also awoke \" that dazzle\nin the brain,\" as he always described the process which led him\nover the borderland of the physical into the \" gardens \" of psychic\nconsciousness or, as he called it, \"into the Green Life.\"\n(P. 223.) From [about 1893, when F. M. first began to write] till\nthe end of his life there was a continual play of the two forces in\nhim, or of the two sides of his nature ; of the intellectually observant,\nreasoning mind\u2014the actor\u2014and of the intuitively observant, spiritual\nmind\u2014the dreamer\u2014which differentiated more and more one from the\nothei-, and required diff'erent conditions, different environment, different\nstimuli, until he seemed to be two personalities in one. It was a\ndevelopment which, as it proceeded, produced a tremendous strain on\nhis physical and mental resources; and at one time between 1897-8\nthreatened him with a complete nervous collapse.\n\fApbil, 1911. Dual Personality in the Case of William Sharp. 59\nAnd there was for a time distinct opposition between these two\nnatures which made it extreme!}' difficult for him to adjust liis life, for\nthe two conditions which were eijually imperative in their demands upon\nhim. His preference, naturally, was for the intimate creative work\nwhich he knew grew out of his inner self; though the exigencies of life,\nhis dependence on his pen for his livelihood\u2014and, moreover, the keen,\nactive interest \" William Sharp \" took in all the movements of the day,\nliterary and political, at home and abroad\u2014required of him a great\namount of applied study and work.\n(P. 244.) [Extract from a letter to his wift^, written while staying\nalone in the Isle of Arran, and dated Feb. 20, 1895.] \"There is\nsomething of a strange excitement in the knowledge that two people\nare here : so intimate and yet so far-off. For it is with me as\nthough Fiona were asleep in another room. I catch myself listening\nfor her step sometimes, for the sudden opening of a door. It is\nunawaredly that she whispers to me. I am eager to see what she\nwill do\u2014particularly in The Mountain Lovers. It seems passing\nstrange to be here with her alone at last.\"\n(P. 275.) During his absence [in New York, in November, 1896],\nF. M.'s romance, Green Fire, was published. The title was taken\nfrom a line in \" Cathal of the Woods,\" \"0 green fire of life,\npulse of the world, 0 Love !\n\" And the deeper meaning of the\nexpression \"Green Life\"\u2014so familiar to all who knew \"Fiona\nMacleod \"\u2014is suggested in a sentence at the close of the book\n:\n\"Allan knew that strange nostalgia of the mind for impossible things.\nThen, wrought for a while fiom his vision of green life, and flamed\nby another green fire than that born of earth, he dreamed his\ndream.\"\n(P. 285.) [Extract from a letter to his wife, written in the spring\nof 1897.] \"More and more absolutely, in one sense, are W. S. and\nF. M. becoming two persons\u2014often married in mind and one nature,\nbut often absolutely distinct. I am filled with a passion of dream\nand work.\"\n(P. 292.) The production of the Fiona Macleod work was accom-\nplished at a heavy cost to the author as that side of his nature\ndeepened and became dominant. The strain upon his energies was\nexcessive ; not only from the necessity of giving expression to the\ntwo sides of his nature ; but because of his desire that, while under\nthe cloak of secrecy F. M. should develop and grow, the reputation\nof William Sharj) should at the same time be maintained. More-\nover, each of the two natures had its own needs and desires, interests\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1911.\nand friends. The needs of each were not always harmonious one\nwith the other, but created a complex condition that led to a severe\nnervous collapse. The immediate result of the illness was to cause\nan acute depression and restlessness that necessitated a continual\nchange of environment. In the early part of 1898 he went in turn\nto Dover, to Bournemouth, Brighton, and St. Margaret's Bay. He\nwas much alone, except for the occasional visit of an intimate friend\n;\nfor I could go to him at the week ends only, as I had the work in\nLondon to attend to. The sea, and solitude, however, proved his\nbest allies.\n(P. 297.) [From a letter to his wife, dated May, 1898.] \"To-day\nI took a little green leaf o' thorn. I looked at the sun tlirough it,\nand a dazzle came into my brain \u2014and I wished, ah ! I wished I\nwere a youth once more, and was '\nsun-brother ' and '\nstar-brother\n'\nagain\u2014to lie down at night, smelling the earth, and rise at dawn,\nsmelling the new air out of the East, and know enough of men and\ncities to avoid both, and to consider little any gods ancient or\nmodern, knowing well that there is only '\nThe Red God ' to think\nof, he who lives and laughs in the red blood. . . .\n\" There is a fever of the '\ngreen life ' in my veins\u2014below all the\nordinary littlenesses of conventional life and all the commonplace of\nexterior : a fever that makes me ill at ease with people, even those\nI care for, that fills me with a weariness beyond words and a nos-\ntalgia for sweet impossible things.\n\" This can be met in several ways\u2014chiefly and best by the\npractical yoking of the imagination to the active mind\u2014in a word,\nto work. If I can do this, well and good, either by forced absorp-\ntion in contrary work (e.g. Cajsar of France), or by letting that go\nfor the time and let the more creative instinct have free play : or by\nsome radical change of environment : or again by some irresponsible\nand incalculable variation of work and brief day-absences.\n\" At the moment, I am like a man of the hills held in fee : I am\nwilling to keep my bond, to earn my wage, to hold to the foreseen :\nand yet any moment a kestrel may fly overhead, mocking me with a\nrock-echo, where only sun and wind and bracken live \u2014or an eddy of\nwind may have the sough of a pine in it \u2014and then, in a flash \u2014there's\nmy swift brain-dazzle in answer, and all the rapid falling away of these\nstupiil half-realities, and only a wild instinct to go to my own.\"\n(P. 301.) During the years that F. M. developed so rajjidly her\ncreator felt the necessity pressing hard on him to sustain, as far as\nhe could, the reputation of W. S. He valued such reputation as he\n\fApril, 1911. Dual Personality in the Case of William SItarp. 61\nhad and was anxious not to let it die away ;\nyet there was a great\ndifference in the method of production of the two kinds of work.\nThe F. M. writing was the result of an inner impulsion ; he wrote\nbecause he had to give expression to himself whether the impulse\ngrew out of pain or out of pleasure. But W. S., divorced as much\nas could be from his twin self, wrote because he cared to, because\nthe necessities of life demanded it. He was always deeply interested\nin his critical work, for he was a constant student of Literature in all\nits forms, and of the Literature of different countries\u2014in particular\nof France, America and Italy. This form of study, this keen interest,\nwas a necessity to W. S. . . .\n[In 190'J an attempt was made by some of William Sharp's friends\nto have him put on the Civil Pension List. His limited means and\ncontinued ill-health made the matter a serious one from a financial\npoint of view ; but it appeared that the pension would not be granted\nunless he would allow his jealously guarded secret of the identity of\nFiona Macleod to be divulged to the House of Commons. The\nfollowing is an extract from the letter he wrote to Mr. Alexander\nNelson Hood, explaining that he could not accept the pension on\nthis condition :]\n(P. 346.) \"Rightly or wrongly, I am conscious of something to\nbe done-\u2014to be done by one side of me, by one half of me, by\nthe true inward self as I believe\u2014(apart from the overwhelmingly\nfelt mystery of a dual self, and a reminiscent life, and a woman's\nlife and nature within, concurring with and oftenest dominating the\nother) \u2014and rightly or wrongly I believe that this, and the style so\nstrangely born of this inward life, depend upon my aloofness and\nspiritual isolation as F. M. To betray publicly the private life and\nconstrained ideal of that inward self, for a reward's sake, would be\na poor collapse. And if I feel all this, as I felt it from the first\n(and the nominal beginning was no literary adventure, but a deep\nspiritual impulse and compelling circum.stances of a nature upon\nwhich I must be silent) how much more must I feel it now, when\nan added and great responsibility to others has come to me, through\nthe winning of so already large and deepening a circre of those of\nlike ideals or at least like sympathies in our own country, and\nin America\u2014and I allude as much or more to those who, while\ncaring for the outer raiment, think of and need most the spirit\nwithin that raiment, which I hope will grow fairer and simpler and\nfiner still, if such is the will of the controlling divine wills that\nabove the maze, watch us in our troubled wilderness.\n\f62\n',',T\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research. April, l9ll.\n\" That is why I said that I could not adopt the suggestion, despite\npromise of the desired pension, even were that tenfold, or any\nsum. As to 'name and fame,' well, that is not my business. I am\nglad and content to be a '\nmessenger,' an interpreter it may be.\nProbably a wide repute would be bad for the work I have to do.\nFriends I want to gain, to win more and more, and, in reason, '\nto\ndo well ' : but this is always secondary to the deep compelling\nmotive. In a word, and quite simply, I believe that a spirit has\nbreathed to me, or entered me, or that my soul remembers or has\nawaked (the phraseology matters little) \u2014and, that being so, that\nmy concern is not to think of myself or my '\nname ' or '\nreward,'\nbut to do (with what renunciation, financial and other, may be\nnecessary) my truest and best.\"\n(P. 409.) It was our habit, when talking to one another of the\n\" F. M.\" writings, to speak of Fiona as a separate entity. ... It\nwas William's habit also to write and post to himself two letters\non his birthday [_ie. one from W. S. to F. M., and one from F. M.\nto W. S.] \u2014letters of admonition and of new resolutions. On the\n12th September, 190.\"), he brought me the two birthday letters when\nthey reached him, and gave them to me to read, saying, with a\nsmile, \" Fiona is rather hard on me, but she is quite right.\"\n(P. 42.3.) In surveying the dual life as a whole, I have seen\nhow, from the early partiall}' realised twin-ship, \" W. S.\" was the\nfirst to go adventuring and find himself, while his twin, \"F. M.,\"\nremained passive, or a separate self. When \" she \" awoke to active\nconsciousness \"she\" became the deeper, the more impelling, the\nmore essential factor. By reason of this severance, and of the\nacute conflict that at times resulted therefrom, the flaming of the\ndual life became so fierce that \" Wilfion \" \u2014as I named the inner\nand third Self that lay behind that dual expression\u2014realised the\nimperativeness of gaining control over his two separated selves and\nof bringing them into some kind of conscious harmony. This was\nwhat he meant when he wrote to Mrs. Janvier in 1899, \"I am\ngoing through a new birth.\"\nFor, though the difference between the two literary expressions\nwas so marked, there was, nevertheless, a special characteristic of\n\"Wilfion\" that linked the dual nature together\u2014the psychic quality\nof seership if I may so call it. Not only did he, as F. M., \"dream\ndreams\" and \"get in touch with the ancient memory of the race\"\nas some of \"her\" critics have said; but as W. S. he also saw visions\nby means of that seership with which he had been dowered from\n\fApril, 1911. Dttal Personality in the Case of William Sharp. 63\nchildhood. And though, latterly, he gave expression to it only\nunder shelter of the Fiona Macleod writings\u2014as for instance in Tlie\nDivine Adventure, because he was as sensitive about it as he was to\nthe subtler, more imaginative side of his dual self\u2014a few of his\nfriends knew William Sharp as psychic and mystic, who knew\nnothing of him as Fiona Macleod.\n(P. 424.) It is true, as I have said, that William Sharp seemed\na different person when the Fiona mood was on him ; but that he\nhad no recollection of what he said in that mood was not the case.\nThat he did not understand it, is true. For that mood could not\nbe commanded at will. Different influences awakened it, and its\nduration depended largely on environment. \" W. S.\" could set him-\nself deliberately to work normally, and was, so far, master of his\nmind. But for the expression of the \"F. M.\" self he had to wait\nupon mood, or seek conditions to induce it. But, as I have said,\nthe psychic, visionary power belonged exclusively to neither ; it\ninfluenced both, and was dictated by laws he did not fully under-\nstand. For instance, \"Lilith,\" \"The Whisperer,\" \"Finis,\" by W. S.\nand \"The Woman with the Net,\" \"The Last Supper,\" \"The Lynn\nof Dreams \" by F. M. were equally the result of direct vision.\nI remember from early days how he \"would speak of the momen-\ntary curious \" dazzle in the brain \" which preceded the falling away\nof all material things and preluded some inner vision of Great\nBeauty, or Great Presences, or of some symbolic import\u2014that\nwould pass as rapidly as it came. I have been beside him when he\nhas been in trance and I have felt the room throb with heightened\nvibration. I regret now that I never wrote down such experiences\nat the time. They were not infrequent, and formed a definite\nfeature in our life.\nDUBLIN SECTION OF THE SOCIETY FOE PSYCHICAL\nRESEAECH.\nEepokt for the Year 1910.\nThe work of the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical\nEesearch during the past year in many respects shows con-\nsiderable progress when compared with the preceding year.\nThe annual general meeting was held on January 28th, 1910,\nand the first ordinary meeting of the session on February 10th.\nA series of ten meetings was arranged from February lOtli\nto June 2ord, and a programme of work for each meeting was\npreviously arranged by the Committee.

In this\nAutumn series of meetings the addresses of Dr. Doherty, Mr.\nHaslam, and Miss Miles were of special interest. Miss Miles\ngave a most interesting paper on \" Telepathy at a distance,\"\nwhich was all the more appreciated because she had taken the\ntrouble of coming from London to deliver it.\nThe success attending the plan of announcing beforehand the\nfull particulars of the programme for each meeting to the\nmembers has been so marked that the Committee will continue\nthis course for the present year.\nThe Committee desire to place on record the very great loss\nthat the Society has sustained by the sudden death of our\nVice-Chairman, Mr. .John Ellard Gore.\nDuring the past year there has been a notable increase in\nthe number of our members. At the beginning of the year the\nnumber of members on the roll of the vSociety was about 80,\nthe number is now over 110.\nSome private experimental work has been recently attempted\nby small sections of the members, Init the results, so far as\nbrought before the Section, though encouraging, have not been\nof a very definite character.\nThe Society is most fortunate in having the constant guidance\nand sympathetic assistance of its chairman.

Pigou.\nIn the Proceedings of last March Mr. Gerald Balfour con-\ntributed an elaborate and valuable article in criticism of\n^irguments put forward in a paper published by me in June,\n1909. I hope at some time to be able to reconsider the whole\nproblem of cross-correspondences in the light, both of the\ncriticisms which my paper has evoked, and also of the large\nmass of new evidence that has accumulated since it was\nwritten. There is, however, little prospect of my being able\nto do this in the near future, and I am unwilling to leave\nMr. Balfour's argument wholly unanswered for an indefinite\ntime. I venture, therefore, to ask for sufficient space in the\nJournal to permit of a brief provisional discussion.\nMr. Balfour begins by giving a summary statement of my\nthesis, which seems to me, if I may say so, to be entirely\njust. He then examines in turn each of the three principal\nstages of the argument, and decides that it \" fails at almost\nevery point.\" While frankly admitting that his criticism is\nsuccessful at several points, I am not inclined to cede my\nmain position. In this reply I will, as far as possible, follow\nthe order of the criticism, using in each case the summary\nstatement of my argument as given there.\nMy first proposition was :\n\" The Piamsden-Miles experiments\nshow that the production of a simple cross-correspondence is\nnot outside the known powers of the subliminal self.\" The\nargument ran as follows. In the experiments in question, the\nsupraliminal consciousness of one person endeavoured to trans-\nfer a particular impression to another person. It sometimes\nhappened, however, that a different impression\u2014one which had\npassed through the supraliminal consciousness of that person in\nthe course of the day-\u2014was in fact transferred. Nobody would\ndeny that the '\nagent ' in this case\u2014the question whether the\n'\nagent ' acted with intention I postpone\u2014was the subliminal\nconsciousness. Hence, we have experimental evidence that A.'s\nsubliminal consciousness may affect B. in a particular way when\nA.'s supraliminal consciousness is endeavouring to affect him in\n\fMat, 1911. Cross-Correspondences. 67\nquite a dijfcnmt way. This fact, I argued, nialccs it prohoMc\u2014\nI never put the case higher than this\u2014that A.'s subliminal\nconsciousness could affect B. when A.'s supraliminal conscious-\nness was not endeavouring to affect him in any way. Mr.\nBalfour replies that \" the attitude of A.'s supraliminal con-\nsciousness may have been a conditio sine quel non. of there\nbeing any thought-transference at all\" (p. 41). I admit the\nforce of this criticism, and I agree that, in order to establish\nmy proposition securely, we need to take account, not merely\nof the Eamsden-Miles experiments, but also of other psychical\nphenomena. Mr. Balfour, however, as I understand him, while\nrightly criticising my argument, does not deny the proposition\nwhich it was intended to support. He recognises that more\nconclusive evidence in its favour could easily be adduced. I\nhad referred to the existence of this evidence as a matter of\ncommon knowledge, but had mistakenly supposed that the\nargument from the Kamsden-Miles experiments could be made\nwater-tight without direct appeal to it.\nMy second proposition is summarised as follows. \" The\nresults of Dr. A^errall's attempts to get a certain Greek phrase\nreproduced in Mrs. Verrall's automatic script show that the\nsubliminal consciousness can also produce the complementary\nelement in a complementary correspondence.\" Apart from\ncertain general comments on my attitude towards '\nintention,'\nwhich will be discussed under the next head, Mr. Balfour's\nprincipal criticism consists in the suggestion that the comple-\nmentariness present in this correspondence may have resulted\ndirectly from the activity of Dr. Verrall's supraliminal con-\nsciousness. \"It might result incidentally from thought-trans-\nference from a consciousness which, without any deliberate\nintention to produce complementariness, dwells now on one,\nnow on another, aspect of the idea to be transferred, with\ncorresponding modification of the impressions produced \" (p.\n46). He supports this suggestion by reference to a particular\ninstance, where it would seerd that \" Dr. Verrall, from his\nexamination of the script, knew that something was wanting\nand tried successfully to supply it\" (p. 47). I had not\nthought of this explanation, and recognise that, in view of it,\na smaller part of the complementariness in Mrs. Verrall's script\nshould be attributed to subliminal activity than I had at first\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1911.\nsupposed. Mr. Balfour himself, however, does not contend that\nthe whole of the complementariness present should be attributed\nto supraliminal activity operating in the way described. Apart\nfrom the argument about intention, which I have postponed,\nhe would not, I think, deny that there is a sufficient amount\nof complementariness in the script, not susceptible of explan-\nation by reference to this activity, to justify my second\nproposition.\nIt is in connection with the third proposition that we reach\nthe fundamental point in dispute. Mr. Balfour states the pro-\nposition thus. \" The complementary element exhibited iu what\nfor shortness' sake we may call the A-^errall case, is comparable\nin all essentials with the complementary element in the best\ncross-correspondences recorded in the Froceedinr\/s up to the date\nof Professor Pigou's paper\" (p. 39). He rejects this proposition\nupon the ground that these cross-correspondences differ from\nthe Verrall case in the essential fact that their structure shows\nevidence of purpose, while the Verrall case does not show such\nevidence. In the course of his discussion of this point, and\nalso in earlier parts of his paper, he criticises the ambiguity,\nas he considers it, of my whole attitude towards the question\nof purpose or intention. On tliis matter there has, as it seems\nto me, been a certain amount of misunderstanding, and I will,\ntherefore, begin by trying to mal^e my position somewhat more\nclear.\nThe supraliminal consciousness is known to all of us, and\nwhat is meant by '\nintention '\non the part of such a conscious-\nness is well understood. Behind the supraliminal consciousness,\nand somehow connected with it, there exists a something that\nwe commonly call the subliminal consciousness or self, but\nwhich, since we do not know that it is conscious in any\nordinary sense, it would perhaps be better to call the sicbli\/ninal\nheing. Of the nature of this being we are almost entirely\nignorant. Throughout my paper I avoided the question whether\nit acts with '\npurpose ' or '\nintention,' because, in connection\nwith such an entity, I cannot attach any clear meaning to\nthese terms. To ask the question seems to me to imply a\ntacit assumption that A.'s subliminal being is a second '\ncon-\nsciousness '\nof the same kind as his supraliminal consciousness,\nendowed like it with conscious cognition and volition, acting\n\fMat, 1911. Cross- Corresponde n ces. 69\nthrough the same processes and differing from it merely\nnumerically. This, I may add in passing, is my answer to Mr.\nBalfour's question concerning the A^errall case : Why is the\nargument from absence of intention valid against origin in Dr.\nVerrall's conscious self, and not equally valid against subliminal\norigin?\" (p. 45). It is not equally valid for the same\nreason that it would not be equally valid against mechanical\norigin. We are not justified in speaking about the subliminal\nbeing as if it were merely an extra supraliminal consciousness,\nwhose structure we understand. It is to my mind a negative\nconcept\u2014that background of consciousness to whose unexplained\nand mysterious action we refer those psychical effects which\npersons produce but which they do not seem to produce by\nsupraliminal activity. Kegarding the matter in this way, I\nnaturally preferred to ask whether the cross-correspondences\nfor which discarnate origin is claimed differ in any marked\ndegree from the A^errall cross-correspondence where incarnate\norigin is admitted, rather than to ask whether either or both\nof the groups of cross-correspondences under review are probably\nthe result of purpose. I was simply avoiding a difficulty not\nrelevant to the matter in hand. If no marked difference appears\nbetween the Verrall cross-correspondence and these other cross-\ncorrespondences, and if the complementariness in the Verrall\ncross-correspondence is attributed to subliminal activity, then\nthe complementariness in the other cross-correspondences ought\nalso to be attributed to this cause. Of course, were we to\ndecide that the structure of the correspondences in the one\ncase points to intention on the part of the subliminal being,\nwe should be bound, having already argued that the structure\nin the two cases is similar, to decide that intention is pointed\nto in the other case also. But, in order to determine whether\ntwo structures are similar, it is not necessary to determine\nwhether a particular arrangement, which is common to both\nstructures, came by accident or came by design.\nIn the preceding paragraph I have been concerned to ex-\nplain and defend my method. I now turn to the issue of\nfact, Mr. Balfour holds that some of the recorded cross-corre-\nspondences do differ from the A^errall case in a marked degree,\nand he points out particular characteristics which, in his view,\nthey possess and the Verrall case does not possess. The\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9ii.\nquestion whether the alleged distinguishing characteristics are\nvalid evidence of design seems to me, as I have said, to be\nof secondary importance, but the question whether distinguish-\ning characteristics exist is, of course, fundamental. In the\nimaginary examples of extreme cases, which Mr. Balfour gives\non p. 52 of his paper, such characteristics undoubtedly do exist.\nThe complementary element is much stronger and much more\nexact than it is in the Verrall case. This, I imagine, nobody\nwould deny. Nor was it ever my intention to suggest that\nthe Verrall case could be regarded as analogous to any possible\ncross-correspondence. My thesis was much less ambitious.\nAfter examining a good number of the cross-correspondences\nthat have actually occurred, I came to the conclusion that, in\nstrength and exactness, the complementary element present in\nthem was not markedly superior to that present in the Verrall\ncase. Whether I was right or wroncf in this is an issue of\nfact upon which different people will naturally judge differently.\nIt is an issue, too, I need hardly say, upon which Mr. Balfour's\nopinion should carry great weight. Without a renewed and\nlengthy study of the published cases I could not at this time\nundertake a defence of the conclusion which I reached con-\ncerning it nearly two years ago\u2014and other work presses heavily.\nFor the present, therefore, I must leave the matter so.\nAN INCIDENT IN MRS. HOLLAND'S SCRIPT.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nIn my first report on the automatic writing of Mrs. Holland,.\nI quoted a piece of script produced by her in India on\nJanuary l7th, 1904,-' the concluding part of which was as\nfollows\n:\n\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers\"\u2014^ \u2022\nDear old chap you have done so much in the past three\nyears\u2014I am cognisant of a great deal of it but with\nstrange gaps in my knowledge\u2014If I could only talk with\nyou\u2014If I could only help you with some advice\u2014I tried\nmore than once did it ever come\u2014There's so much to be\nlearnt from the Diamond Island experiment\n\u2014\nwell meaning but very ignorant\u2014bound to be tinged by\nthe channels through which tliey are conveyed\u2014Help me\n\u2014give me the help if not yet of your belief of your\n^See Proceedings, Vol. XXI. p. 235. -Henry V., Act iv.

An Incident in Mrs. Holland's Script. 71\nsympathy \u2014Take the message to you all I cannot yet fully\nand [ending in illegible scribble].\nI stated in a foot-note to this script that I was unable to\nconjecture the meaning of the phrase \" Diamond Island experi-\nment ;\n\" and Mrs. Holland, who was accustomed to tell me of\nany facts within her knowledge that could throw light on the\nscript, had made no comment on it. Nor did it convey any-\nthing, as far as I could learn, to those who read the Proceedings.\nOn Nov. 24th, 1908, Mrs. Holland, being in England, came\nto see me and told me among other things that she thought\nthis phrase must be an allusion to wireless telegraphy, since\nDiamond Island (which she believed to be near Diamond\nHarbour at the mouth of the Hoogli river) had a wireless\nstation on it. Some time later Mrs. Verrall, hearing of this\ninterpretation, pointed out to me that it followed that the\nwhole of this part of the script was intended to be addressed\nto Sir Oliver Lodge, and I then perceived that most of the\nmessage evidently was intended for him. But on communi-\ncating with him on the subject, though he recognised the\nappropriateness of the general tone and substance of the message,\n'\nthe phrase \" Diamond Island \" awoke no chord in his memory.\nHe told me, however, that the Lodge-Muirhead system was at\nwork between Burma and the Andaman Islands, and he wrote\nto his friend and partner in this matter, Dr. Alexander Muir-\nhead, F.E.S., on Feb. 24, 1910, to ask:\nDo you remember whether anj' wireless experiments were conducted\nacross the mouth of the Hoogli or anywhere in that neighbourhood ?\nIf so, can you name the place 1 ... I should rather like to know\nwhether they tested the Andaman installation first at the Hoogli\n\u2014\nor wherever it was. They must have tried it somewhere ... Is\nthere a wireless station on the Hoogli, do you know?\nDr. Muirhead replied on Feb. 26, 1910:\nI believe Mr. Simpson, the man who put up the Andaman Wire-\nless, has been conducting some experiments between a pilot boat\n. . . and Calcutta. . . . The Andamans circuit is between Diamond\nIsland, at the mouth of the Irrawaddy in Burma, and Port Blair . . .\nThus it appears that Mrs. Holland's conjecture of a con-\nnection between Diamond Island and wireless telegraphy was\ncorrect, but that she had located it wrongly, viz., at the mouth\nof the Hoogli, whereas it is really situated at the mouth of the\nIrrawaddy, in Burma. From enquiries made with Sir Oliver\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9ll.\nLodge's help, I find that towards the end of August, 1904,\noperations were begun for linking up the Settlement of Port\nBlair in the Andaman Islands with the general telegraph system\nof India by establishing wireless telegraph stations at Port Blair\nand at Diamond Island, which was already connected by cable\nto the mainland. The distance to be spanned was o05\"2 miles.\nThe system chosen was the Lodge-Muirhead, with which pre-\nliminary experiments had already been carried on for three\nmonths in the early part of 1904; the 150 feet masts were\nmade in the Calcutta workshops, the scientific apparatus being\nsupplied by the Lodge-Muirhead Co. in England. The work,\nwhich was executed by the Indian Government Telegraph\nDepartment, went on for several months, the circuit being in\ncomplete working order first on Feb. 10th, 1905.\nThis installation was an event of some importance in the\nhistory of wireless telegraphy, for it was one of the first\ninstallations in the British Empire connecting different land\nstations ; the main developments of wireless telegraphy having\npreviously been for the purpose of connecting shore stations\nwith ships.\nSir Oliver Lodge of course knew of the Burma-Audamans\ninstallation, but had entirely forgotten that the Burma end of\nthe installation is on Diamond Island ^ (which is a very small\nisland, not marked on most atlases).\nWhen I questioned Mrs. Holland about her knowledge of\nthese matters, she told me that she had known at or about\nthat time that the Lodge-Muirhead system of wireless telegraphy\nwas being experimented with in India, but she could not say\nwhether it was before or after the date of the script, which\nhad conveyed no meaning to her when it was written.\nIn reply to a question what normal means of acquiring\ninformation about experiments on Diamond Island existed in\nIndia in January, 1904, Mr. M. G. Simpson, of the Govern-\nment Telegraph Department, who had superintended the setting\nup of the installation, wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge from Calcutta\non April 18 th, 1910 :\n... In 1902 I was at home, but some of my officers did some\nwireless experiments in July at Diamond Harbour.

I came out here in December 1902, and in 1903,\nJanuary, I put up a little temporary station at Sanger Island at the\nmouth of the river and another on a small Government steamer, the\n\"Guide,\" and we worked out to the Sandheads where the pilot\nvessel is stationed 40 miles from Sanger. This was reported in due\ncourse and found its way into the papers. During the whole of\n1903 there was a weekly financial paper. Capital, in Calcutta con-\nstantly jibing at Government for their dilatoriness with regard to\nwireless and urging them to come to terms with the Marconi Co.\nIn Jan., '04, apparatus began to arrive from Elmers End [Messrs.\nMuirhead & Co.'s works in Kent] and in February we started out\nfrom Calcutta to try and link up Diamond Island with the Andamans.\nI can't be quite certain now, but I think it is more than probable\ninformation of this intention appeared in the local press. At first\nwe established communication over a short distance. Elephant Point\nto Amherst, and it was not till April, 1904, any actual experimenting\nwas done on Diamond Island.\nThe script referring to the Diamond Island experiment was\nwritten, as stated above, iu January, 1904 ; but from\nMr. Simpson's letter it appears not impossible that Mrs. Holland\nmay already have seen references to the subject in one of the\nIndian papers. She herself knows nothing in detail of wireless\ntelegraphy, and she could not remember that any of the friends\nshe was accustomed to see at that time had spoken to her of the\nsubject or took any interest in it. It happened, however, that\nshe had heard a lecture by Marconi in 1901 or 1902, and had\nrather regretted that an Italian was (as she supposed) ahead of\nEnglishmen in the subject. Consequently she was pleased when\nshe heard of the Lodge-Muirhead system being used. She\nwrote to me on March 19th, 1910 :\nI am sorry that I cannot be certain, after the lapse of so many\nyears, if I heard or read any mention of the Lodge-Muirhead system\nbefore writing the script of Jan. 17th, 1904.\nMy impression is that I must have seen some newsj^aper reference\nto it, since I am as sure as I can be, when dealing with anything\nso far away, that I did not hear any conversation about it.\nI left India in April, 1904, and returned there more than two\nyears later.\nMy ignorance of the matter is shown b)'' my belief\u2014until just\nlately\u2014that Diamond Island was near Diamond Harbour in Bengal,\ninstead of in Lower Bui'ma, where it is really situated.\nIt is clear then that Mrs. Holland's reference to the \" Diamond\nIsland experiment \" cannot be regarded as strictly evidential,\nsince she may have had normal knowledge of it.\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 191i.\nThe script nevertheless is remarkably appropriate in several\nrespects as a message to Sir Oliver Lodge. It was written on\nJan. I7th, 1904, the third anniversary of Mr. Myers's deaths\nwhich was also the end of Sir Oliver Lodge's three years'\nPresidency of the S.P.E. I take the phrase\u2014\" you have done\nso much in the past three years \" to refer to this. The tone\nof affectionate intimacy running through the whole script is\nalso especially appropriate.\nMrs. Holland knew the date of Mr. Myers's death and that\nSir Oliver Lodge had been President of the S.P.Pi. in 1903;\nbut when I asked her if she knew in January, 1904, that\nhe was an intimate friend of Mr. Myers's and that he had been\nPresident for three years, she replied\n:\nFeb. 20th, 1910.\n... I did not realise then that Sir Oliver Lodge was an intimate\nfriend of Mr. Myers's. There were references to him, of course, in\n[Hitman Personalifii\\, especially in reference to early experiments with\nMrs. Piper; but I did not know there was a friendship of long\nstanding, and I certainly did not know in Jan., 1904, that he became\nPresident of the S.P.E. after Mr. Myers's death. I am surprised to\nhear that he held it for three years, \u2014I thought it had been for\ntwo ... It never struck me before that this message was to Sir\nOliver Lodge. . . .\nIt is further significant that, as Sir Oliver Lodge tells me,\nMr. Myers had been keenly interested in his work in wireless\ntelegraphy and it was while with Mr. Myers and stimulated\nby him that he devised the fundamental plan for \" tuning \" which\nin some form or another is necessarily used in all systems of\nwireless telegraphy and was first patented by him in 1897.\nThe term \" syntony \" was invented for him by Mr. Myers and Dr.\nA. T. Myers. Sir Oliver Lodge had, as is well known, been ex-\nperimenting for years on the theoretical side of the subject,\nand it was partly, or even largely, his discoveries between 1888\nand 1894 which, in the energetic hands of Mr. Marconi, in\n1896 and onwards, led to the development of wireless telegraphy\nfor practical purposes. Mr. Myers had been much interested in\nthis development and anxious that the results of his friend's work\nshould not be unduly exploited by others.\nWhile the script is thus thoroughly characteristic of the\nrelation between Mr. Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge, the fact\nthat it is connected in point of time with the first important\n\fMat, 1911.

(17) \" fato profugus \" (a Virgilian phrase meaning\n'\na man exiled by fate ') seems to be intended, by the altera-\ntion from profug?\/.s into the feminine profugrt, to refer to\nPhjedra's fateful fiight with Theseus from Crete. (See the\nplay, p. 4, middle.)\n(Scribe C.) (21), (22), (23) I cannot place; they do not occur\nin the poem. The \"Mistress\" addressed in (24) is Artemis;\nthat in (25), a misquotation for \"Mistress, a sharp swift terror,\"\nis Phaedra, a distinction pointed out by the script. \" To the\nfar red west\" {i.e. far west of Greece) leads up to \"Moray\nFirth no not the sea,\" by which the name \" Murray \" is\nsuggested ; and this interpretation is confirmed by the words,\n\" Look for it in the Dictionary,\" which follow, pointing\napparently to the Dictionary edited by another Dr. Murray.\nIf these admirably constructed scripts were genuine, they\nwould no doubt greatly strengthen the evidence for spirit\ncontrol in those we have from the autoniatists. Not from the\nabsence of any duplication of the quotations from the play\n\u2014\nfor that, as I have before contended, might easily happen on\nthe telepathic hypothesis in a subject of this extent\u2014but\nbecause of the apparently deliberate halving of the name\n\" Gilbert Murray \" between two automatists. If this striking\nfeature should occur as unmistakably in, say, half-a-dozen real\nscripts, it would be highly unreasonable to assign it either to\nchance or to any power which\u2014as yet at any rate\u2014we have\nany ground for supposing to be possessed by the subliminal\nconsciousness. But the only genuine cross-correspondences\nwhich present a similar apparently purposive apportionment\nare (so far as my memory serves me) the \"Ave Eoma Im-\nmortalis \" case, and the incident in Proc, Vol. XXIV., p. 297,\nwhere a short poem is halved between two automatists, and\neven in these cases the evidence of design is not so marked\nas in the scripts now before us.\nIt may be observed that these latter suggest a comparison\n{not, however, intended by their author, I believe) with the\nimaginary scripts which, as aclvocatns diaboli for the nonce, I\nventured to propound in Proc., Part LXII. If my own scripts\n\f80 Joarnal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9il.\ncan be considered to represent at all fairly the bulk of the\ngenuine correspondences\u2014I do not myself think they cover\nthe whole ground\u2014the obvious contrast between the two\nimaginary types may serve to give precision to the point at\nissue between the \" telepathists \" and the \" spiritists.\" Since a\nsubliminal self can, as we know, communicate to other auto-\nmatists such simple but suggestive messages as \" Ancient\nMariner \"\u2014\" Hamlet \"\u2014\" Excalibur,\" or \" cross-bow and alba-\ntross \"\u2014\" spectre ship \"\u2014\" Alas, poor ghost !\n\"\u2014\" white samite,\"\netc., etc., scripts of such a type as that which I offered, loith\ncomplementary features vjhicli vjoald only hy chance he identical,\nseem to be easily within the range of telepathy between the\nliving. On the other hand, such an explanation, though it\nmight be applied to one or two, would altogether fail to account\nfor a series of correspondences of Sir Oliver Lodge's type, with\nits arbitrary splitting of a composite expression (\" Gilbert\nMurray\"); and in proportion as the genuine correspondences\napproach this model, we are gently but surely pushed towards\na belief in the intervention of disearnate spirits. Any alternative\ntheory would seem to require\u2014if I may borrow a humorous\nsuggestion of Miss Alice Johnson's\u2014the assumption of periodical\ncommittee-meetings of subliminals.\nSupplementary Note bv Sir Oliver Lodge.\nOn Mr. Bayfield's remark concerning the evidential value\nwhich such an item as the distribution of the names of Gilbert\nand Murray would have had in a real case, I suggest that the\nnames Leo, Harold, Silvia, have actually been distributed among\nreal scripts (see Proceed inys, Vol. XXII., p. 278).\nNOTICE.\nCopies of Professor Barrett's paper \" On the History and\nMystery of the so-called Dowsing or Divining Rod,\" (reprinted,\nwith additions, from the Occult Peview for December, 1910),\nprice Is. prepaid ;\nalso of his pamphlet entitled Creative Tlioiajlit\n(published by John M.

C. Constable.\nTheee would appear to be a general iuipression that those\nwho refer cross-correspondences to telepathy are in direct\nopposition to those who explain them as referable to com-\nmunication with the disembodied or discarnate. I try to\nshow that this opposition is not real but apparent.\nI think our ordinary definition of telepathy is erroneous\nand that the terms, '\nsubliminal,' '\nsubliminal consciousness,'\n'\nsubliminal self,' are used very loosely in relation to telepathy :\nthis possibly is why the general impression referred to exists.\nMr. Podmore is held to be marked above others as relying\non telepathy,\u2014in contradiction to reliance on connnunication\nfrom the disembodied,\u2014for explanation of cross-correspondences.\nAnd, as I have good reason to believe that, had he remained\nwith us, his work would have been constructive and not\ndestructive, I try to show that his theory carries us farther\nthan it is believed to.\nNow Mr. Podmore accepted telepathy as a fact of human\nexperience so, with this assumption, let us consider what con-\nclusions follow directly, in human reason, the assumption made.\nWe may consider, very generally, the abnormal facts involved\nin telepathy.\nSomething happens to B in Australia and A in England\nsees what happened. He sees it not subject to the law of\nthe inverse square. B in Australia says something and A in\n1 See Journal for Ajiril, 1911, p. 52.\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1911.\nEngland hears what is said. He hears it not subject to the\nnormal law of hearing {not subject we may, roughly, say to\nthe law of the inverse square), and in neither case is A\naffected through his normal organs of sense. Indeed, the\nordinary definition of telepathy infers communication between\nman and man otherwise than through the normal organs of\nsense.\nNow I lind from these inherent ingredients of telepathy\ndirect proof that the percipient A is a personality 7iot subject\nto the law of the inverse square and not conditioned by the\nnormal organs of sense. For by no possibility can a normal\nhuman personality in England see what takes place in Aus-\ntralia : A, a normal human personality, subject to the laws of\n(our) space cannot by any possibility see what takes place\nthousands of miles distant as clearly and of the same apparent\nsize as if it were near him. In the same way A, a normal\nhuman personality, cannot hear at a distance beyond the\nnormal bounds of hearing.\nI do not pretend in any way to allege we can determine\n(deline the characteristics of) a personality free from the bonds\nof the inverse square and free from the limits of the normal\norgans of sense. But I do allege we have human experience\nof the existence of such personalities,\u2014the facts of telepathy are\nexplainable only if such personalities exist. We arrive at the\nfact of the existence of these personalities, but cannot determine\nthem, except so far e\/s they eire manifest to ns in our universe\nof s'pace emd tivie.\n1 would suggest, therefore, that telepathy is an expression\nfor communion Ijetween us as (relatively) spiritual selves,\nmanifest in communication between ns as normal human beings\nthrough our normal organs of sense. For if there be inter-\ncourse of any kind between A and B, where A and B are\nnot conditioned by the normal organs of sense, and are not\nsubject to tlie law of the inverse square (that is, are not\nconditioned by the space of our universe), they must be\npersonalities which, to us, are (relatively) spiritual. Bear in\nmind that both Gurney and Myers deny direct transference of\nideas (and feeling) between us as normal human beings : they\nrefer telepathic effects to impulses on us as normal human\nbeings which emerge (phenomenally ?) in audible, visual or\n\fJune, 1911. Note on Part LXII. of \" Proceedings.\" 85\ntactile ideas. Gerald Balfour, also, has pointed out that\nthe facts of telepathy can only be accounted for by the\nexistence of the self unconditioned as I have said,\u2014a spiritual\nself. And a great scientist\u2014whose name now escapes me\u2014\nhas said that telepathy is necessarily false because, if true, we\nmust exist as spiritual selves,\u2014and spiritual selves, he informs\nus, do not exist.\nWith the above definitions of telepathy, and of the mani-\nfestation to us of telepathic communion (definitions I have\ndeduced from Kant's reasoning), I think we can consider more\nclosely the relation between Podmore's theory and those based\non communion with the disembodied.\n\" With the development of cross-correspondences the problem\nbecame more complicated. In these Mr. Podmore recognizes\nthe directive action of an intelliijence other than that of the\nautomatists, but he fails\u2014as others of us have failed\u2014to find\nsufficient evidence for believino' the intellioence at work to be\nthat of a discarnate spirit\" {Proceedings, Part LXII., p. 77).\nMr. Podmore, I think, admits the '\ndirective force of an\nintelligence.' But this intelligence uses its directive force free\nfrom the conditioning of soace and of the normal organs of\nsense; it is not a normal material intelligence, a subject of\nhuman body and brain and one conditioned in our space. It\nis true he denies that the intellis;ence is discarnate, and so\nmakes it incarnate. But at the same time (for he accepts\ntelepathy) he makes it use its '\ndirective force ' free from the\nconditioning of its incarnation.\nThe point I make is this :\n\u2014If telepathy be a fact, there\nmust be communion between personalities unconditioned by\nthe normal organs of sense and free from the conditioning of\nspace,\u2014as shown in so-termed cases of clairvoyance. It\nfollows directly, I suggest, that the communicators (agents and\npercipients) must also be unconditioned by the normal organs\nof sense and not subject to the .(laws of the) space of our\nuniverse : they must be (relatively) spiritual selves. And from\nthis (following Gurney and Myers) we find what we term\n'\ntransference of ideas ' must result from this (spiritual) com-\nnmnion (these impulses, in Myers's words). The ideas emerge\nin the human understanding in phenomenal relation to the\n(relatively) noumenal impulses.\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1911.\nThe scientist above referred to is reasonable in denying\ntelepathy because, if telepathy be a fact of human experience,\nit proves the existence in each one of us of a (relatively)\nspiritual self. Human personalities are no more than partial\nand mediate manifestations in our universe of these (relatively)\nspiritual selves.\nBut what bearing has this argument on cross-correspondences ?\nI think it has a direct bearinfr.\nIf we refer back transference of ideas otherwise than through\nthe normal organs of sense to communion between ourselves\nas spiritual selves, we admit this communion between spiritual\nselves when incarnate. This, it is true, does not prove the\npossibility of communion between the incarnate and the dis-\ncarnate, but I think it constitutes evidence pointing to such\npossibility.\nWe find, therefore, that those who rely on telepathy do not,\nthereby, put the possibility of communion with the disembodied\nout of court,\u2014they, on the contrary, open the door for the\nadmission of evidence of such communion.\nIf, as I argue at length elsewhere, limits do not disappear\nin the limitless, but are suhsumed under it, so that human\nknowledge and human memory are not lost to us when dis-\nembodied, but merely subsumed under fuller knowledge, fuller\nmemory, then communion between the embodied and dis-\nembodied is possible. How prove it ? Some of us know (or\nfeel or intuit) the fact, but the knowledge (?) is useless to\nothers as evidence, for it is outside cognition. How, then,\nget human evidence in proof ? I think one method, now\npursued, of trying to find evidence of design, where the design\nitself cannot be referred to the embodied, is most hopeful.\nTake an extreme, probably impossible, instance. In 1912\nfive different scripts are obtained which are, each, meaningless\nin themselves, but related to one another by internal evidence:\n(1) June, (2) 1914, (3) England, (4) Birmingham, (5) Volcano.\nThe year 1914 arrives, and in June a volcano breaks out\nat Birmingham in England. I think in such a case, if the\nfive scripts were earmarked as from some one disembodied,\nmany would find definite evidence of communion from the\ndead,\u2014there is the evidence of design which originates with\nthe disembodied.\n\fJune, 1911. Note on Part LXIL of \" Proceedings.\" 87\nBut, assuming there be communion with the disembodied,\nthe evidential '\nscript ' is never pure : the communications from\nthe disembodied can never be more than plums or currants\nin a pudding of normal human ideas,\u2014we must have our\nPiddingtons and Johnsons for separation. So, even if relying\non design, we must rely also on the cumulative force of\nevidence. To prove his law of gravity the falling apple was\nnot enough for Newton : he had to wait six (fourteen ?) years\nto know that the moon imitates the apple.\nEeferring to imitation cross-correspondences Sir Oliver Lodge\nsays :\n\u2014\" . . . The writings do not solely represent the uncon-\ntrolled subliminal meandering of an automatist ;\nthey do\nrepresent vague and random thoughts coerced or guided into\nsomething like coherence by the action of one purposive in-\ntelligence \" {Journal for April, 1911, p. 56).\nWith this statement many, perhaps most of us, will agree.\nBut when Mr. Podmore recognizes '\nthe directive action of an\nintelligence other than that of the automatists,' is he not also\nin agreement? I think he is. And the admission (by those\nwho rely on telepathy) that there is action of one purposive\nmind, seems to me to constitute a definite step towards\nacceptance of communion with the disembodied.\nWhat we want is cumulative evidence that this purposive\nmind is a mind (?) of the disembodied. But I deny that we\never determine this mind. All we can do is to arrive at\nevidence proving its existence,\u2014we can '\nknow '\nit only so far\nas manifest in our Lilliputian universe.\n^\nCASE.\nL. 1184. Dream.\nThe following case of an apparently telepathic dream was\nreceived through Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of Caius College,\nCambridge, who collected all the evidence concerning it, and\nwrites on April 16th, 1911:\nThe following account was written out by myself and signed by\nMrs. Woollacott on October 2iid, 1910, after I had heard her\naccount of the case. Her husband subsequently wrote to his sister,\nMrs. Hewett, and she writes the letter dated October 4th con-\nfirming the fact of the accident. Subsequently Miss Poupard wrote on\nNovember 11th an account of her dream, and sent it to Mrs.\n\f88 Joitmal of Society for Psychical Researclt. Juxe, 1911.\nWoollacott for me. Miss Poupard also returned the postcard, which\nhad been sent her from Dubh'n and which was the only communication\nshe received from Mrs. Woollacott before her visit to Pinner.\nIf telepathy is present, the evidence suggests Mrs. Woollacott as\nthe agent, as she was aware of the accident before Miss Poupard's\ndream. ^\nMrs. Woollacott's account is as follows :\nWooDsiDE, Pinner Hill, Pinner.\nI was staying in Kingstown with my sister-in-law, Mrs. Hewett,\nfrom July 29tli to August 20th, 1910. My only communication\nwhile there with Miss G. Poupard was a postcard sent by me, saying,\n\"We are here. Where are you?\" I returned on August 20th, and\non Tuesday, August 30th (or Wednesday 31st), I received from\nMrs. Hewett a letter, saying that my nephew Stanlej', aged 11, had\nhad a narrow escape from drowning in the swimming baths (on\nTuesda}', August 23rd). As he was getting out up the steps he\nslipped and fell back, and had a struggle to get out, not being a\nswimmer. No serious results followed.\nOn September 11th Miss Poupard visited me at my home in-\nPinner, and told us of a curious dream she had had. She had\nseen in a dream in the stop-press column of a newspaper my name,\nWoollacott. As an unusual name she looked at it and saw that\nit referred to me and to my nephews, who seemed to be aged 17\n(correct) and 12. In her dream she seemed to be present near a\nbridge over some water, and my younger nephew fell into the\nwater and was drowned. .\nNanette Woollacott.\n111 reply to Mr. Woollacott's request for Mrs. Hewett s\ntestimony, she wrote to him as follows :\nMount Clarence, Kingstown, Co. Dublin, Oct. 4, 1910.\n... I really have forgotten near)}' all about Stanley's accident.\nHe was at the Baths and slipped coming up the steps, and fell into\nth(^ deep water, and seems to me to have been saved by a miracle.\nHe was really more frightened, I think, than anything else, and\nlooked like death when he managed to get home to me. His friend\nWilliam was with him.\nThis took place about 11.30 in the morning on the Tuesday\nfollowing the Saturday Nan went home. I can't remember the date.\nIt was not in the paper, but similar cases are happening every\nday, and there was a case very much like it, only worse, a few\n\fJune, 1911. Case. 89\nweeks before Nan and the boys were here, which was in the\npaper. Only yesterday a clergyman was drowned at Dalkey.\nStanley has not been bathing since\nMiss Poupard's account of her dream was as follows\n:\n41 G-EORGK St., Baker St., W.,\nNov. 11\/10.\nI had a dream in the first week of September, which impressed\nme very much at the time.\nIn my dream I was reading a newspaper, when the stop-pi'ess\nnews attracted my attention ; I read that an accident had happened\nto one of Mrs. WooUacott's nephews. As I read I seemed to see\nthe occurrence\u2014the boy appeared to fall from a bridge or other\nstructure into some water, being either killed in the fall, or\ndrowned.\nThe strange part of it was that I had no idea my friend Mrs.\nWoollacott had any nephews, yet in my dream there were distinctly\ntwo, their ages being about twelve and seventeen.\nThe dream was such a vivid one, that I related it to Mrs.\nWoollacott when I saw her a week or two later, and to my\nastonishment found that an accident practically identical to the one\nI described had happened to one of her two nephews.\nGertrude Poupard.\nThe postcard referred to by Mr. Stratton, addressed by Mrs.\nWoollacott to Miss Poupard, was sent to us with the other\npapers. It has the postmark \"Kingstown, Au. 7, 10.\"\nThe following are further questions put by Mr. Strattou to\nMrs. Woollacott, with her answers to them, which were in-\ncluded in a letter from her, dated May 8th, 1911:\n(1) What letters or messages, if any, passed between you and\nMiss Poupard between your return to Pinner and her visit to you\"?\nAns. Only an invitation to visit us.\n(2) Could the incident at the baths have been mentioned in such\na way as is suggested in the last cpiestion 1 Ans. No.\n(3) Did Miss Poupard know any of the Hewetts ? Ans. No.\n(4) Is it certain that Miss Poupard told you of her dream before\nshe heard from you of the accident? Ans. Quite cei'tain.\n(5) Did she in particular mention the seeing of the name before\nyou told her anything? Ans. Yes.\n(6) Is it certain that the accident was mentioned in no paper?\nAns. Yes.\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 191i.\n(7) If any one was present when Miss Poupard told you her\ndream, can he or she confirm your answers to (4) and (5) 1\nAns. No one present.\nThe following are questions put by Mr. Stratton to Miss\nPoupard, with her answers to them, dated May 10 th, 1911:\n(1) Did Miss Poupard know that [Mrs. Woollacott was] staying\nwith a sister-in-law 1 Ans. I knew that Mrs. AVoollacott was staying\nat Kingstown with a relative, but I did not know it was a sister-\nin-law.\n(2) Can Miss Poupard trace the dream of the accident to any-\nthing that she had been reading or hearing 1 Ans. No, I cannot\nrecall having read or heard of anything likely to lead up to such\na dream.\n(3) Has she ever had such a dream or impression before, whether\nverified or not? Ans. Yes, I have had some impressive dreams at\ndifferent times, but cannot usually recall them in detail, as in the\npresent case.\nCASE OF llECURRENT HALLUCINATIONS ASSOCIATED\nWITH ILL-HEALTH.\nThe following report of a series of hallucinations was com-\nmunicated to us by an Associate of the Society, Mr. Edward\nWight, M.R.C.S., of 9 Eegency Square, Brighton, who writes\nconcerning it :\nMaij 21, 1911.\nThe old lad3% \" Sister Agatha,\" who writes her experiences, is a\npatient of mine, a member of an Anglican sisterhood, and she was\nunder my care during the time she had the hallucinations in\nFebruary of this year. She used to tell me of her \" night visitors,\"\nas she laughingly called them, when I went to see her in the\nmorning, and when she got stronger I got her to write down the\nwhole story for me.\nI should mention that Sister Agatha is possessed of an eminently\nsane, well-balanced mind, as I think you would gather from the\nway in which she records her experiences, and her buna-fides is above\nreproach. During February last she was suffering from a weak\naction of the heart, and as this improved under treatment, her\nexperiences ceased.\nI think the hallucinations are of interest, and perhaps worthy of\nrecord in that\n\fJune, 1911. Halhicinatiovs Associated ivitlt lU-Hcaltli. 91\n(1) They only occur during ill-health, and always cease when\nhealth improves.\n(2) More than one special sense is involved, there being halluci-\nnations of sight, hearing, and touch at the same time.\n(3) They can all be referred back to definite past impressions on\nthe mind, and in one or two instances to impressions that had been\nforgotten for many years {e.g. the Markham's Hlstoyy illustration\nincident).\n(4) My patient is never tempted to give them an objective exist-\nence, nor is she frightened or upset by them.\nSince February she has been quite free from these experiences, as\nher health has improved.\nEdward Wight.\n\" Sister Agatha's \" own account of her experiences is as\nfollows :\nI have been asked to note a few cases of hallucination I have\nexperienced in illness with more or less of fever. They always\noccurred at night, and generally after a first sleep or doze.\nThe first I can remember was when I was about ten years old\n(1846) in intermittent fever. I had been made much worse by\nthe ringing of church bells near me all day, and remember my\nhead ached badl}' in the evening. I was awaked when it was\ndark by something, and saw a M'oman standing by my bed with a\nlittle child in her arms and a basket of flowers in her hand. She\nput the child down upon the bed. I don't think I was at all\nfiightened.\nWhen I was twenty-five I had a serious two years' illness\u2014an\nafi\"ection of the upper part of the spine from over-strain in nursing.\nI have never completely recovered from this, and over-exertion\nalways brings on a severe pain, which used to be treated with a\nblister at the back of my neck. I mention this because it was after\nthe pain and its remedy I had my next two experiences. In 1871,\nafter several days' suffering, a Sister came to me during the evening\nto consult me about some refractory girls in her department of the\nwork. We talked for a long time, and especially of one in whom\nI was particularly interested. It was dark when the Sister left me,\nbut my fire was not quite out. I dozed and was awakened to\nvivid consciousness by feeling my bed heaving up in the middle as\nif some one was under it. I sat up for a moment and thought of\nan earthquake, which had once shaken my bed, but no ! this was\nquite a different movement. I looked cautiously over the side of\n\f92 JotLrnal of Society for Psychical Research. June, l9ll.\nthe bed, and was startled to see the head and shoulders of the girl\n\\VQ had been talking about emerging from under it, almost witliin\nreach of my hand. The red glow of the dying fire showed her to\nme distinctly, her sunny hair, rosy cheeks, and snowy cap. She was\nlooking up at me, and I particularly noticed the shine of the two\njiins with which she fastened the bib of her apron to her\nshoulders. I said, \" Child, how dare you !\n\" and as I spoke sprang\npast her, and seizing a box of matches from a candlestick on the\nmantelpiece, I lighted the candle and a gas jet above it. Then I\nturned to face the girl. She was gone. I looked under the bed;\nthere was no one there, no one in the room. I went to the door ;\nit was locked.\nThe next hallucination was in enteric fever in South Africa, 1886.\nThe dear friend who was taking care of me and my household\ncame to say good-night. After she left me I was thinking lovingly\nof her devotion and goodness, and must have gone to sleep bless-\ning her name\u2014Marianne Browne, for by and Ijy I awoke to see three\napparitions in turn, each iiaving something to do with the name\nBrowne. First, there was Brown the carpenter busy at work\nplaning wood, with his big basket of tools beside him, on the floor\nbetween my bed and the wall, where, in fact, there was hardly\nroom for a mouse. Then small brown hens were running and peck-\ning about at the other side of my bed.\nThe third brown thing was, I think, a hare, but I don't distinctly\nremember. I know there were three brown apparitions with a doze\nbetween each.\nIn 1892 or 1893 I had an attack of low fever and extreme weak-\nness of the heart. It was about nine o'clock one evening, and my\nfire was fairly good. My bed was at some distance from it in a\nrather large room. I had been to sleep, and waked to see a child\nal)0ut two j^cars old standing in the ruddy glow between me and\nthe hearthrug. It had golden curls and a little white garment\nfalling off its shoulders; its face was towards me. I just said\ndrowsily \" 0, you sweet little thing !\n\" and went to sleep again. I\nawoke atrain with a start to see standing in the middle of the room\nthe exact counterpart of a figure I remember having seen at school\nin one of the illustrations of Mrs. Markham's History of England, a\nman in tights, with very long, pointed shoes, the points fastened,\nI think, with a button just below the knee. I didn't like this\nvisitor quite so well as the child, Itut I don't think I was exactly\nfrightened, and soon went to sleep again.\n\fJuke, I'ju. Hallucinations Associated tvith Ill-Health. 93\nThe next apparition startled me very much, chiefly, I think,\nbecause it was close to me\u2014a woman bending over me with a\nshawl over her head. This may have been the recollection of a real\nfright I had when ill with enteric fever in Natal.\nA veiled Sister, who paid me a visit during the night, thought I\nlooked too ghastlj', and bent over me closely to ascertain if I\nbreathed. I awoke with a terrible start, and I had somewhat of a\nreturn of it with this imaginary person.\nIn February of this year, 1911, my heart was very weak, and I\nhad alternate attacks of feverish restlessness and exhaustion. I had\nnot slept much for several nights when one night I was aroused\nout of sleep by hearing a knock at my door. My room is\nnever perfectly dark, because there is a lamp in the road outside,\nwhich shines a little through the Venetians. I said, \" Come in !\n\"\nraising myself to look at the door. As I did so it opened, and a\nlady, in black dress, jacket, and hat, walked in. She lield a little\nsatchel in her right liand, keeping the handle of the half-opened\ndoor in her left. I saw every detail of the dress, face, and figure\ndistinctly. The face was that of a friend who had lately called\nupon me, but the figure and dress were those of a person in the\nhouse. \" Who are you ?\n\" I asked, and receiving no reply, said\nrather imperiously \"Wait a moment,\" and, springing out of bed,\nlighted a candle on the mantelpiece and then turned I'ound. Tliere\nwas no one there, and the door was shut.\nI put out the candle, went back to bed, and was soon asleep\nagain.\nBy and by I opened my eyes and saw my landlady standing close\nto me with a pretty little black kitten in her arms. I was not in\nthe least alarmed until the kitten sprang away, running across the\nfender, rattling the fire-irons as she went. I didn't see her do this,\nI onlj' heard her.\nI did not light my candle this time, and said to myself as I\nturned to go to sleep, \" I don't suppose there will be anything\nmore.\" Almost immediately, as it seemed to me, I opened my eyes\nagain and saw my dear sister-in-law, who had lately stayed with\nme, quietly taking her tea at a little taVjle which usually stands\nclose to my bedside. It was not there then, but had been used as\na tea table by a caller once. Again the face and figure were of two\ndifferent people.\nI was quite complacent this time, but was roused again before\nlong with a violent start. I distinctly felt some one shake me by\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1911.\nthe shoulder. I looked up and saw the tSister who had frightened\nme so by her nocturnal visit in Natal, 1886, standing near me\nwith her arms full of branches of yellow flowers, and smilingly\noffering a bunch to me. These were the last peoi:)le I saw in this\nillness. The next night was rather a lively one, in quite a different\nway. Numberless inanimate things took life, or at least motion,\nand jumped upon my bed\u2014for instance, a parcel and my coal\nscuttle, filled with small but very good and bright-looking coals,\nquite different to those I use. These things did not alarm or liurt\nme. They only amused me, and I said to myself, as I always do\nwhen I have visitations, \"Fever!\"\nI have now related every incident of the kind that has occurred\nin my life of 75 years. They have each one made a vivid impres-\nsion upon me that has not faded in the very least ; but they have\nnever haunted me, indeed never recur to my mind, unless, as has\nseldom happened, I have related them to an intimate friend. I\nnever expect hallucinations, even when I know I am feverish, and\nwhen they come I am never alarmed beyond the occasional first\nstart. I was laughed at when I told my first childish experience,\nso did not mention it again for many years. The next, in 1871,\nwhen I felt the heaving of my bed and saw a figure emerging\nfrom under it, did startle me very much, and I think I should\nrecord my belief that I was spared a shock to my nei'ves then\nand a recurrence of nervous fright because I conquered it at once,\nin the only possible way, and then put out the lights and composed\nmyself to sleep. On subsequent occasions I have never kept a\nlight burning or called any one, or locked a door to save my\nnerves, so the nervousness has passed away.\nIn answer to questions as to the details of the appearances,\nand how far they compared in vividness witli the vision of\nreal objects, Dr. Wight replied :\n9 Regency Square,\nBrighton, Man 24, 1911.\nI put your question to Sister Agatha to-day, and she tells me\nthat the apparitions are not \"outlined in light,\" or in any way\ndifferent from ordinary living figures in appearance, when she sees\nthem ; but I don't think that she sees real objects in her room at\nthe same time as the apparition, as far as I can make out. Of\ncourse, in one hallucination she thought she saw her door open\n\fJune, 1911. Hallucinations Associated with Ill-Health. 95\nafter hearing a knock, and before the apparition appeared ; but as\nher door did not open, I take it that it was a visualised memory\nof her door, and not the real door that she was looking at.\nIn another hallucination that she records she thought she saw\na friend pouring out tea by her little round table by her bed,\nwhen all the time the table was really in another part of the room.\nBut it had been by her bed, and she had seen a different friend\npouring out tea by it a little time before. . . .\nShe tells me that at the time of the apparitions it has never\noccurred to her as being curious that she could see them so clearly\nin the dark, so though the apparitions are \"self-luminous,\" the\nlighting has no abnormal appearance. . . .\nEdward Wight.\nNOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nThe Journal of AhiGrmad Psychologij, Feb.-March, 1911, contains\nseveral papers bearing on the controversy between the followers of\nFreud and those neurologists who have not been convinced of the truth\nof Freud's views. Dr. Morton Prince's article on Dreams, referred to\nin the Notes on Current Periodicals in this Journal, January, 1911,\nhas brought forth some remarks from Dr. Ernest Jones, which are\nreplied to by Dr. Prince. Dr. Jones formally denies that there is in\nDr. Prince's article any evidence that he employed psycho-analysis\nat all. He says that the material that Dr. Prince offers as the\nresult of his studies, and which he terms the latent content of the\ndreams, is of a kind that ever}' psycho-analyst will recognise as\nbelonging to the first stages of any investigation into the sources\nof dreams, but which is cfuite unlike the latent content as revealed\nby psycho-analysis. Yet Dr. Jones accepts Dr. Prince's confirmation\nof \"a part, and by no means the least important part, of Freud's\ntheory of dreams.\" Dr. Prince, in his reply, points out that the\ncorrectness of this confirmation depends entirely upon whether he\nhad discovered the true underlying dream-thoughts. If he did\ndiscover these, then his psycho-analysis was sufficient; if he did not\ndiscover them his interpretations are valueless and should not be\nclaimed as confirming Freud's views.\nDr. Prince says that his investigation was not undertaken in\norder to test the validity of the Freud metliods, but in order to\nstudy the psychology of di'eams. He desired to make use of any\nand every method that might help in obtaining data from which\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, I9il.\nsound conclusions could be drawn, and he still thinks that his\ninterpretations of the dreams were logically sound and justified,\nAvhether he employed Freud's method or not.\nDr. Jones says that \"up to the present no one who has taken\nthe trouble to acquire the psycho-analytic method has failed to\nconfirm Freud's theory in all essential particulars.\" Dr. Prince re-\ntorts :\n\" No one who has shown by his writings that he is thoroughly\ntrained in and conversant from first-hand knowledge M'ith all the\nphenomena of abnormal, experimental and functional psychology has\naccepted Freud's theory.\"\nDr. A. Friedlander, of Frankfort, contributes a paper on Hysteria\nand Modern Paycho-analysis, in which he gives a useful review of the\nopinions of many continental workers both for and against Freud's\nviews. He also points out the harmful results which follow when\nscientific views are proclaimed to the world as established facts\nbefore thej' are tested and discussed by specialists in their special\njournals and periodicals. Such unwarranted popularisation, of which\nsome of Freud's followers have been guilty, causes harm to the\npatients, to the science, and to the representatives of the new\ndoctrine.\nIn tlie April-May, 1911, number of the same peiiodical there is\na short abstract of Dr. Savage's Harveian Oration on Experimental\nFsydiAiliKjy and Hyjmotism, delivered before the Eoyal College of\nPhysicians of London on October 18, 1909. The reviewer says \"Dr.\nSavage's oration is of interest to American science, not because the\naddress makes a substantial contribution to our knowledge of experi-\nmental psychology or of hypnotism, but because it may be regarded\nas indicative of the stage of development psychotherapy has\nattained in Great Britain.\" He concludes that \"the condition of\npsychotlieiajjy in Great Britain, judged by this oration, is nothing\nshort of deplorable. It is not that Di'. Savage is not sincere and\nopen-minded enough. The difficult}' is with the rank and file of\nthe profession, who are so conservative that a Harveian oration must\ndegenerate into a plea that scientific men should not reject new truth,\nsimply because it is new. May his sincerity fertilise the sterile\nsoil upon which he has strewn rather unpromising seed !\n\"\nT. W. M.\n\fNo. CCLXXXL\u2014Vol. XV.

W. Verrall read a paper on \" Cross-correspondence\nas a Vehicle for Literary Criticism,\" of which the following\nis an abstract\n:\nAssuming that tlie evidence previously presented (in Pro-\nceedings) has established the existence\u2014at least in certain cases\nof purposive supplementary cross-correspondence\u2014of intelligent\ndirection of the phenomena of concordant automatism, this\npaper is an attempt to determine some characteristics of the\ndirecting intelligence. If, as was suggested by Miss Johnson\nin a paper read in March last (and now published in\nProceedings, Part LXIIL), this intelligence contains a factor\nnot identifiable with the subliminal self of any one of the\nautomatists, though acting in concert with their minds, the\ndiscovery of its characteristics might carry us a step further\nby affording means of comparison with the known character-\nistics of the automatists concerned. Such an intelligence,\nhowever, manifested through the memories and associations of\nthe automatists, is thereby conditioned, and some similarity\nof mental processes may be necessary for the successful pro-\nduction of the phenomena. Still, if there is present in the\nintelligence a factor not identifiable with any of the living\nhuman factors with which it is combined, it is reasonable to\nlook for evidence of its possession of individual tastes,\ninterests, or capacity,\u2014for evidence, in short, of idiosyncrasy or\npersonality.\nFor this purpose in this paper the phenomena of cross-\ncorrespondence are isolated from all their accompaniments, and\n\fJolt, 1911. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 99\nan examination is made, not of the methods used in the\nseveral scripts for the emergence of the transmitted topic, but\nof the actual topics chosen for transmission.\nLiterary topics are numerous ; five cases are examined in\ndetail.\n(1) Mjytunes Trident. {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV. p. 177.)\nThis topic, originally emerging in Mrs. Piper's trance as one of\nseveral appropriate reminiscences of the Aeneid provoked by\nMr. Dorr's reading of the opening lines of Book I., was spon-\ntaneously selected by Myersp as the subject of a cross-\ncorrespondence. It had in fact appeared some sixteen days\nearlier in Miss Verrall's script. The cross-correspondence is of\nthe simple kind ;\nintelligence is shown in the choice of a topic\nalready associated by the control with a literary knowledge not\npossessed by the automatist through whom the choice was\nmade.\n(2) The Invocation to Sahrina in Milton's \" Comus.\" (Pro-\nceedings, Part LXIII. p. 253.) A few lines from this were\nread by Mr. Dorr to Myersp, who accepted Mr. Dorr's sug-\ngestion to use the subject for cross-correspondence. The second\nline appeared in Mrs. Holland's script, not long after Miss\nVerrall's script had contained a paraphrase of the concluding\nportion of the invocation, which had not been read to Mrs.\nPiper. Here the cross-correspondence is supplementary, and\nthe complete correspondence shows a knowledge of the context\nof the passage originally selected.\n(3) Sesame and Lilies. {Proceedings, Vol. XXIV. p. 264.) A\ncross-correspondence on Euskin's Sesame and Lilies was found\nto occur between the scripts of some new experimenters, Mr.\nand Miss Mac on the one hand, and on the other of Mrs. and\nMiss Verrall, a comparison between whose scripts had already\nled to the detection of an incomplete cross-correspondence on\ntliat subject. Both sets of scripts contained allusions unintel-\nligible to the automatists, but subsequently found to be\nappropriate and to show an acquaintance with Euskin's works\nexceeding that consciously possessed by them.\n(4) French Poems. {Proceedings, Part LXIII. p. 320.) A\ndouble and partly supplementary cross-correspondence on a\nFrench poem, each of its two stanzas being combined with a\nsecond topic\u2014a rose\u2014unconnected with the poem, was produced\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, I9ii.\nbetween the scripts of Miss Verrall, and of Mr. and Miss Mac.\nThe poem, \" La vie est breve,\" was known to the automatists\nconcerned. \"With both parts of the cross-correspondence were\nassociated allusions to other French poets : the Mac script\nalluded to a poem by Malherbe, the H.V. script referred to\nGautier and Hugo as presenting comparable types. This state-\nment, at the time unintelligible, was explained by the subsequent\ndiscovery of two poems, unknown to the automatists, by Hugo\nand Gautier respectively, which are appropriately combined\nin the one script with the double topic of the cross-corre-\nspondence which, in the other, had been associated with\nMalherbe. Thus the French poem, which was the subject of a\ncross-correspondence, was accompanied by allusions to parallel\nliterary passages outside the range of the automatists' reading.\n(5) Criticism of Rcnan. This case will, it is hoped, shortly\nbe published. It may be briefly summarised thus : A cross-\ncorrespondence between the scripts of Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\nWillett led to the discovery of an inaccuracy in Eenan's\naccount of the vision of St. Paul. Neither script alone was\nintelligible ; Mrs. Verrall's drew attention to \" what Eenan\nwrote \" about St. Paul's vision : Mrs. Willett's two days later\ngave instructions to send to Mrs. Verrall the words \" Eikon\nEenam (sic).\" Kenan's account was unknown to both automatists,\nbut reference to his book, Zes Apotres, showed that his\nrationalistic explanation depends on the seeing by St. Paul of\na visual image, an \" Eikon,\" which is not asserted in the\nnarrative of Acts, upon which Eenan bases his statement.\nFrom the examination of these five cases, it would seem\nthat one characteristic of the intelligence directing the cross-\ncorrespondence is a wide and deep interest in literature, the\nauthors laid under contribution being Virgil, Milton, Euskin,\nGautier, Hugo, Eenan. To none of the automatists were all\nthe selected passages known ; to all the automatists some\nwere unknown ; in one case was shown not merely knowledge\nof recorded facts, but literary judgment. If the directing\nintelligence is to be identified with the subliminal activities\nof the automatist, it must be credited with the power of\nproducing an original criticism of a subject, in which the\nnormal personality took no particular interest, contained in a\nbook which the normal personality had never read.\n\fJuly, 1911. Notes on Part LXIII. of \" Froceedings.\" 101\nNOTES ON PART LXIII. OF \" PROCEEDINGS.\"\nWe print below information and suggestions which have been\nsent to us by members of the Societj' on the literary sources\nof various passages in the scripts published in the last part\nof Proceedings. Any one who studies these scripts with care\nwill recognise that they do not by any means give a full\nrepresentation of the ideas existing at the time in the mind\nof the automatist and which are emerging, through the writing,\npartially and indirectly, and sometimes in a curiously veiled\nand symbolic form. The attempt to discover as far as we\ncan what is the complete idea which is struggling to emerge\nmay be compared with the methods of \" psycho-analysis \" used\nby Dr. Freud and his school to discover the hidden feelings\nand lapsed memories of their patients, \u2014the ideas which are\ndominant in their minds. \" These psycho-analytic procedures\n(writes Dr. Mitchell ^) are the most delicate instruments of\npsychical diagnosis which we at present possess\n;\n\" but he\npoints out that the procedures are diagnostic, rather than\ncurative. Somewhat similarly, our elaborate analyses of the\nquotations and allusions to literary topics in the scripts, which\nmay no doubt to many readers appear over-elaborated and\ntedious, are directed in the first instance to finding out the real\nthoughts of the intelligence guiding the script, irrespective of\nthe question of what that intelligence is.\nWillett Scripts of February, 1910.\n(p. 123) Haggi Babha. Mr. C. A. Goodhart suggests that\nthe phrase in Mrs. Willett's script of February 4, 1910,\n\" There was the door to which I found no key and Haggi\nBabba too,\" may refer to an episode in Chapter V. of James\nMorier's \" The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan.\" In this\nstory Hajji Baba, the son of a celebrated barber of Ispahan,\nbeing taken prisoner by the Turcomans, is forced to assist\nthem to invade his native city. Reaching the gate of the\nroyal caravanserai, he finds it locked, and the door-keeper\nrefuses to open till he gives his own name, pretending that\nhe is a messenger come to announce the return of Hajji Baba\n1 ProeeecZm<;s, Vol. XXIV. p. 678.\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, I9ll.\nwith a caravan. He thus effects an entry for the phmdering\nTurcomans. The incident is referred to again in Chap. XLIX.\nwhere the door-keeper speaking to Hajji, of whose part in\nthe affair he is ignorant, remarks :\n\" It was on account of\nyour name, which the dog's son made use of to induce me\nto open the gate, that the whole mischief was produced.\"\nThis passage in Mrs. Willett's script was interpreted as\nrelating to the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, in\nwhich \" Sesame \" was the magic word that caused the door\nto open ; for there are undoubted references in the same script\nto the cross-correspondence \" Sesame and Lilies.\" It is also\nconnected with the pun on Mr. Dorr's name. But there may\npossibly be a further reference, as suggested by Mr. Good-\nhart, to this adventure of Hajji Baba's, where the only key\nhe possessed to the gate of the caravanserai was his own name.\n(p. 123) \"The shining souls, shining by the river brim.\"\nMiss Dallas writes\n:\nWhen reading Mrs. Willett's script of Feb. 4, 1910, I have been\nstruck by a close resemblance between the ideas in that script from\nthe words, \"the shining souls,\" etc., to \"Peak,\" and the ideas in\nCantos XXX. and XXXI. of the Paradiso. I can best show what\nseems to me to be the connection by supposing that the thoughts\nof the control from this point ran in some such sequence as the\nfollowing\n:\nThe word \" Lethe \" suggests not only the passage in the Aeneid\nwhere the river is named, but also Cantos XXX. and XXXI. of the\nParadiso, because in the latter Dante borrows the imagery of Virgil\nand applies it in a slightly different connection.\nWhilst Virgil speaks of troops of ghosts fluttering as in meadows\non a serene summer day, when the bees sit on various blossoms\nand swarm around snow-white lilies, all the plain buzzing with their\nhumming noise, and tells us that they quaff' the streams of\noblivion, Dante tells us of angehc spirits who issue from a river not\nof oblivion but of light, and describes them as \"living sparks,\"\ndropping \"on every side into the blossoms, like rubies set in gold\"\n(Canto XXX.).\nThese \"shining souls, shining by the river brim\" are in the next\ncanto (XXXI. 7) compared to bees among the flowers. Thus \" the\npain forgotten \" is not the only appropriate thought called up by\nthe mention of the .river of Lethe ; there is \" another connection,\"\n\fJolt, 1911. Notes on Part LXIII. of \" Proceedings.\"\nwhich cannot perhaps be fully given, but which can be indicated in\ncertain words.\nOne of these is the word \" Rose.\" Immediately before Dante\nuses the comparison of the angels with bees, he speaks of the\nChurch triumphant under the symbol of a white rose, \"adorned\nwith so many leaves \" {i.e. souls of the blessed) ;\nthese souls are\nvisited by ascending and descending angels, \" che volando vede.\"\nThe memory of these cantos naturally leads on to the thought of\n\"Love the essential essence,\" for these cantos form the climax of\nthe whole Divine Comedy, of which the theme is Love, human love\nleading up to and becoming one with the Divine. Careful con-\nsideration of Dante's prayer and thanksgiving to Beatrice (XXXL\n79-90) will show the appropriateness of the reference to Tennyson's\nlines :\n\"Love's too precious to be lost,\nA little grain shall not be spilt.\"\nAfter a pause in the script comes the exclamation, \" Darien the\nPeak peak PEAK.\"\nIs there anything in Canto XXXI. which could naturally have\nled to this reference to Keats' sonnet, \" On first looking into\nChapman's Homer'\"? I think that there is. Canto XXXI. closes\nwith a description of the Mount of Paradise. Dante is bidden to\n\" look upon the circles, even to the remotest,\" and doing so he sees\nthe summit of the mountain aglow, and \" on this side and on that\nthe light is shorn away, so was that pacific oriflamme quickened in the\nmidst, on either side in equal measure tempering its flame.\" In\nother words he sees a perfect peak at the summit of the mountain.\nThe words \" pacifica oriafiamma \" may suggest a connection with\n\" Stout Cortez\u2014when with eagle eyes\nHe stared at the Pacific\u2014and all his men\nLook'd at each other with a wild surmise\nSilent, upon a peak in Darien.\"\nBut the connection is more than a connection in the sound of\nwords. Both Dante and Cortez were entering upon a new experience,\nand a new world of life.\nMyers urges that the occasion should be noted, \" Let him remember\nthe occasion\" (p. 12-1). The silence of the followers of Cortez finds\na correspondence in the Paradiso, for we are told that Dante did\nnot dare to try to express the delightsomeness of the vision which\nhe saw. '\n.\n\u2022 -\nWhether or not I am correct in supposing that these cantos of\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1911.\nthe Paradiso suggested the allusions in the script, it is certain that\nthe script has suggested to me the passages in the Paradiso ; and\nthis may perhaps be an argument in favour of the correctness of\nmy interpretation.\nH. A. Dallas.\nThe river alluded to by Miss Dallas was seen by Dante in\nthe highest of the heavenly spheres as \" a light, in river form,\"\nwhich, after he had bathed his eyes in it,\n''\ninto roundness\nseemed to change its length.\" This is interpreted ^ as the\nstream of Time, afterwards seen in its true shape as the circle\nof Eternity. It has no connection with the Lethe which flows\nthrough the Earthly Paradise on the Mount of Purgatory,\nDante's crossing of which is described in Furgatorio XXXI.\nSee Mrs. Verrall's comments (pp. 214-217) on the absence of\nany allusion to Dante's Lethe in the Willett scripts, and the\nsupplying of this omission in her own script of Feb. 15,\n1910.\n(p. 124) \"Not spilt like water on the ground.\"\nMiss A. E. Marten tells us that there is a hymn,^ the second\nverse of which is\n:\n\" Not spilt like water on the ground,\nNot wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,\nNot wandering in unknown despair.\nBeyond Thy Voice, Thine Arm, Thy Care\n;\nNot left to lie like fallen tree,\nNot dead, but living unto Thee.\"\nThe repetition of \" Not\u2014not \" in the script a few words after\nthe quotation is a further confirmation of this source.\n(p. 149) \"Which only I remember, which only you forget.\"\nThis was interpreted by Mrs. Verrall (see p. 206) as an\nallusion to the refrain of Swinburne's Itylus. Miss Verrall\nobserves that a closer verbal parallel is to be found in Christina\nEossetti's poem, \" One sea-side Grave,\" as follows\n:\n\" Unmindful of the roses,\nUnmindful of the thorn,\nA reaper tired reposes\nAmong his gathered corn :\nSo might I till the morn.\n^ ParadiiO, Temple Edition, p. 36.3.\n- Hyjnns Ancient and Modern : with Siqj'ple.mentary Hymns, No. 608.\n\fJDLY, 1911.

Cold as the cold Decembers,\nPast as the days that set,\nWhile only one remembers\n: And all the rest forget,\n\u2014\nBut one remembers yet.\"\nIn reference to this suggestion, Mrs. Verrall writes :\nI do not think that the quotation from C. Rossetti\u2014with which\nI was not acquainted\u2014is a certain source of the Willett script, though\nit may have contributed. Note in the first place that the name\nSwinburne emerges immediately after the \" remember . . . forget,''\nand that the two following allusions to his poems greatly add to\nthe likelihood of its being a poem of Swinburne's that suggested the\n\" remember . . . forget.\"\nAgain, the C. Rossetti poem does not (like Itylus) give the con-\ntrast between \/ and rjou, but only between \"one\" and \"the rest.\"\nOn the other hand, the rhythm of the script is that of the\nRossetti poem, and I think a recollection of this poem may have\ninfluenced the script ; but I think there is much more evidence that\nSwinburne's poem was intended than C. Rossetti's. I considered and\nrejected another poem of C. Rossetti's ^ on the ground that auf\nSwinburne aut nulhis was indicated by the script, since the passage\nis on the face of it ascribed to him, and it reproduces the double\ncontrast between persons (first and second) and actions (remember\nand forget) which he makes in Itylus.\nHolland Script of Nov. 10, 1909.\n(p. 241) \"Oh singer of Persephone from the far meadows\ndesolate\u2014Hast thou forgotten Sicily ?\n\"\nMiss Edith Moggridge tells us that this phrase is clearly\nderived from the first three lines of a villanelle by Oscar Wilde,\ncalled \" Theocritus,\" which opens thus\n:\n\" 0 singer of Persephone !\nIn the dim meadows desolate.\nDost thou remember Sicily ?\n\"\nMiss Moggridge adds that a phrase occurring later in the\nsame script\n:\n\" The torture of the whirling wheel wherein the power of the\nphilter lay\n'\n^ Song, \"When I am dead, my dearest.\"\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psycltical Researclt.

My magic wheel, draw home to me\n.\nthe man I love !\n\" ^\nThe last sentence is the refrain of the Idyll.\nSimaetha is a girl who, deserted by her lover, is using the\ncharm of the whirling wheel to bring him back. In this charm\na wry-neck was attached to the wheel and whirled round with\nit, it being supposed that the effect produced on the bird was\ntransferred to the faithless lover.\nThe discovery of this connection with Theocritus throws a\ncertain doubt on the interpretation of the script offered in\nProceedings, as alluding to Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone.\nIt seems not unlikely, however, that Mrs, Holland had botli\npoems in mind, and so produced a sort of composite represen-\ntation of them. Two further points may be noted: (1) \"The\ndim meadows desolate \" of 0. Wilde's poem are the Elysian\nfields, which brings Mrs. Holland's script into closer connection\nwith Miss Verrall's quoted on the same page ; (2) Mrs.\nHolland's misquotation :\n\" Hast thou forgotten Sicily ?\n\" seems\nintended to express that contrast between memory and forget-\nfulness which was shown to be an item in this complex of\ncross-correspondences {op. cit. pp. 271 and 286).\nOmar Khayyam.\nIn regard to the allusions to Omar Khayyam in Mrs.\nVerrali's \"Note on the Cross-Correspondence 'Cup'\" (pp.\n304-19), Miss Lucy M. Corry points out that for some of those\nin Mrs. Piper's script closer parallels are to be found in the\nfourth edition of the poem than in the hrst edition, with\nwhich alone Mrs. Verrall has compared them. Myersp's phrase\n(p. 310), \"No man ever came back from whence he has gone\nto tell us of the shore,\" suggests Stanza LXIV.

Dream.\nThe following case of a veridical dream was received through\nMr. F. J. M. Stratton, of Caius College, Cambridge. Dr. E. G.\nMarkham, now Assistant Medical Officer of Health at Burnley,\ngives an account of his dream as follows\n:\nApril 30th, 1911.\nDuring the night of Dec. 5th, 1909, I had a dream which was so\npeculiar as to impress itself on my memorj', and the next morning\nI mentioned it to the people with whom I was staying at the time,\nand also the same day wrote to my fiancie, and told her to remind\nme, on the following day, to narrate it to her, but gave her no\nparticulars.\nAs far as I can now remember, the dream was as follows\n:\nA physician. Dr. L., and I were standing at a bedside. I\nrecognised the patient to be a certain Nurse W. who was at that\n[time] a nurse at the Prince of Wales's General Hospital, Tottenliam.\nThe Doctor, after examining her chest, asked me to do so as well,\nand then asked my opinion about the disease present, stating that\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, I9li.\nhe himself thought that she was suffering from heart disease, but\ncertain other signs suggested more serious mischief.\nDuring my residence at this hospital, this particular nurse had\nalways been considered as one of the strongest, and it was this fact\nthat impressed the dream on my memory. The next day, Dec. 7th,\nI met my fiande and narrated the dream to her, and to my astonish-\nment found that the nurse about whom I had dreamt had actually\nbeen examined and advised to leave the hospital.\nR. G.

We met on the same after-\nnoon, and I then reminded him about the dream. It was to this\neffect :\n\u2014He dreamt that he was standing by the bedside of Nurse W.\n(a nurse at above hospital, well known to us both), and that the\nSenior Physician, Dr. L., was examining her chest.\nAt the conclusion of his examination, the Physician turned to\nDr. Markham and said :\n\" Yes, there is certainly some heart trouble there, and, in my\nopinion, something else even more serious, as there are all the\nsymptoms one would expect to find from a growth in that neighbour-\nhood.\"\nDr. Markham then remarked to me how singular it seemed that he\nshould have dreamed of that particular nurse, as she was apparently\none of the strontjest and most robust of all the nurses. When he\nhad finished telling me of his dream, I said :\n\" How very strange,\nfor Nurse W. is ill and has been sent off duty, and has actually\nbeen examined by Dr. L. He has expressed his opinion that her\nillness is due to heart trouble, and requires that she shall be\nX-rayed, as he suspects a growth also, somewhere in the chest.\"\nThe dates, as far as I can ascertain, are :\nI received the letter from Dr. Markham Dec. 7th, 1909.\nI met him on the same afternoon, Dec. 7th, 1909.\nDr. L. saw Nurse W. on Dec. 3rd, 1909.\nNurse W. finally left hospital about Dec. 12th, 1909.\nAlice E.

Mitchell, M.D.\nAn interesting address by Dr. van Renterghem of Amsterdam\non \" The Rehabilitation of the Family Physician,\" is reported\nin the Transactions of the Psycho-Medical Society, Vol. II., Part I.\nThe subject of Dr. van Eenterghem's discourse is one wliich he\nbelieves to be of great importance to physicians and to the\npublic. He points out that within recent times there has been\na diminution of the esteem in which the medical profession is\nheld by the public. He examines the causes that have led to\nthis evil, which more especially affects the general practitioner,\nand he proposes a remedy.\nHe says that at the present day the general practitioner has\nto fight for his very existence against the encroaching army of\nspecialists and a growing horde of quacks and charlatans. He\nthinks specialism tends to produce a class of men who are\nwanting in that broad outlook on life and disease which was\nso characteristic of the great physicians of former times, and\nhe is not surprised that the specialist often fails to cure the\npatients who consult him. But a patient who finds that the\nspecialists can do nothing for him is apt to lose all faith in\nofficial medicine and soon drifts into the hands of the charlatan\nor faith-healer. Not infrequently these succeed where the\nspecialist has failed. According to Dr. van Renterghem the\nspecialist's failure in these cases is due to his ignorance or\nneglect of the mental aspects of the disorders which he has\nbeen called upon to treat, and the success of the charlatan is\ndue to psychical influences consciously or unconsciously employed.\nHe believes that suggestion, direct or indirect, is the curative\nagency in all these cases, and he puts forward a strong plea\nfor such a reform of medical education as would ensure that\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, jply, I9li.\nevery qualified practitioner should have had adequate instruc-\ntion in the principles and practice of psychotherapeutics. The\nman who has been vioil grounded in medical psychology, and\nhas a practical knovfledge of psychotherapy in its various forms,\nwill thereby be better armed against the difficulties of his\nprofession, and will be able to replace the marvels of quackery\nby good and solid cures produced by conscious suggestion. In\nthis way Dr. van Kenterghem thinks the medical profession\nmay regain the place in the public esteem which it occupied\nin former times.\nIn the course of his address Dr. van Eenterghem gives an\ninteresting account of his own career. He tells how he took\nup the study of Hypnotism after reading Beaunis' La Sovi-\nnamhulismc Provoqu4. This work excited his interest so much\nthat he decided to go to Nancy to study under Liebeault. On\nhis return he made extensive use of hypnotism in his practice for\nsome months, and then, in conjunction with Dr. van Eeden, set\nup as a psychotherapeutic specialist in Amsterdam. He describes\nthe changes of method which he found necessary in the course\nof his experience of nervous patients, and gives an account of\nthe various psychotherapeutic pi^ocedures which he makes use\nof at the present time. In many cases he finds that sugges-\ntion alone is not sufficient, but has to be supplemented by\nmoral treatment, re-education, and the treatment known as\npsycho-analysis.\nDr. van Eenterghem is perhaps over sanguine as regards the\npossibility of restoring to the family physician his old status\nby means of the reform of medical education which he recom-\nmends, but his address as a whole is well worthy of perusal\nby all who are interested in psychotherapeutics. Medical men\nwho are ignorant -\nof the applications of suggestion as a cura-\ntive agent will find here a good introduction to this subject.\nEEVIEW.\nBeligion and Immortality. By G. Lowes Dickinson. (J. M.\nDent & Sons, London, 1911. pp. 88. Price Is. net.)\nThis little book, the third of a series by the same author,\nentitled Modern Problems, contains three essays, two of which have\nalready appeared in the Hihhert Journal, while the third, \" Is\nImmortality Desirable 1 \" was the Ingersoll Lecture delivered at\n\fJuly, 1911. Revietv. Ill\nHarvard University in 1909. The circumstances of its production\nhave involved some degree of repetition in the arguments of the\nbook, but there is a coherent thread running through the whole,\nwhich naturally gives a more lucid and complete presentation of\nMr. Dickinson's philosophical position than can be gathered from\nany of the essays separately, while his writings must always be\nread with pleasure for their style, even by those who are not\naltogether in sympathj' with his line of thought.\nThe subject matter of the book is not, of course, one with which\npsychical research is directly concerned, but it is interesting to see\nhow strongly the author is influenced by the root ideas that have\nalways inspired it. In his first essay, on \"Faith and Knowledge,\"\nhe observes that the leaders of free thought seem now to be both\nmore sceptical and more believing than they used to be ;\nthey\nquestion more and they affirm more. The Positivism adopted by\ntheir predecessors is now seen to be not a science, but a\nphilosophy, and a philosophy as little established, as open to\nquestion, as any other. \" Our knowledge, it may be admitted, is\nliut a flickering lamp sheltered by a paper shade from the winds\nof infinite space .... our experience is limited by our senses and\nby the structure of our mind ; and we have no philosophy that is\ndemonstrably true.\" Does it follow that we need preserve an\nattitude of pure agnosticism ? Of such an attitude Mr. Dickinson\nsays, \" If it gives no light or inspiration, neither does it foster\nsuperstitions or dreams. It is a shining brazen rampart against\nthe tides of human credulity.\" Nevertheless, it is not a desirable\nattitude, even for the chosen spirits of mankind, for it tends to\nstop all growth\u2014Imagination being defined by the writer as a\nprinciple of growth. He explains further that he means by\nimagination \"a tentative apprehension, not caring much about the\nintellectual forms in which it finds expression, but caring very\nmuch about the substance with which it imagines it comes into\ncontact\"; and he maintains that modern free thinkers are charac-\nterised by this imagination, or faith, though they are not satisfied\nwith any of the traditional forms of religion. He tries to formulate\nsomething of the content of a faith that will satisfy them. \"It\nmust (he says) be one which brings them into some kind of\nfriendly relation to the universe. . . . They must feel that human\nlife and human purposes .... contribute to and express some-\nthing of [the] essence [of the cosmic process].\" Then comes the\nquestion whether individuals have, as a matter of fact, any cosmic\nsignificance save as a means to something else. This question\neither cannot be answered at all, \"or it can only be answered by\nscience ; and in that case the only method to pursue is that which\nis being pursued, in the face of much discouragement from men of\nscience, by the Society for Psychical Eesearch.\"\nTo this point, the question of the significance of the individual,\nhe returns in his second essay, on \"Optimism and Immortality.\"\nOptimism, the conviction that life is worth living, seems instinctive\nin most men, but we cannot assume that they will continue\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, l9il.\nindefinitely to hold it. Nor have they always held it in the past.\nAt the beginning of the Christian era the Western world passed\nthrough a crisis. \"Not one man or two, here and there, but\nmany men everywhere, were asking that fatal and terrible\nquestion, \u2014Why 1 the question that, once it makes itself heard,\nshatters like a trump of doom the society that cannot give it an\nanswer. Roman society had no answer ; and if the West was\nredeemed, it was only by an influx of barbarians whose brutal\npassion for life was unable even to understand the question asked\nby the great civilisation they destroyed.\" Mr. Myers suggested\nthe same parallel between that era and the present age ^ that Mr.\nDickinson goes on to draw, though he did not attribute its\nredemption to the same cause. Mr. Dickinson discusses what hypo-\ntheses we ought logically to be able to accept if we are to justify\noptimism to our reason, and prominent among these he places the\nconviction of the importance of the individual. Optimism involves\na belief in the ultimate triumph of good on the whole. But the\ndoctrine of general i)rogress, so prevalent in the eighteenth century,\nfinds too little support in actual experience to hold the field. We\nsee that gains are often counter-balanced by losses, and it is hard to\nestimate the result. Even the conception of progress, so long as it\nis confined to the race and ignores the individual, ceases to satisfy\nour ethical needs. \" Optimism (says Mr. Dickinson) is doomed unless\nwe can believe that there is more significance in individual lives\nthan appears upon the surface.\" It is necessary then that science\nshould lay aside its prejudices, and consider with an open mind all\nevidence which may seem to bear on the question of survival after\ndeath.\nThe third essay, \"Is Immortality Desirable'?\" was noticed in the\nJournal (for June, 1909) when it was first published. Mr. Dickinson\nmaintains that the question is a practical one, which has a direct\nbearing on the pursuit of positive knowledge ; for unless men think\nit really important to know the truth, they will neither pursue it\nthemselves nor encourage those who do. He endeavours to show\nthat there is a kind of immortality which, if it were a fact, would\nbe a very desirable one, and he pleads for a serious consideration of\nthe evidence offered on this subject by the Society, especially that\ncontained in the automatic scripts produced during the last few\nyears.\nThe book culminates in a kind of epilogue, written in the poetic\nprose in which Mr. Dickinson excels, called \" Euthanasia : being\nLines from the Note-book of an Alpinist.\" The Alpinist, or\nphilosopher, who seems to sum up the whole thought of the book,\nrecords his impressions, first \"in the hut,\" and finally \"on the\nsummit\": \"I could not see the god, but I heard the music; and,\nhearing it, I overcame fear.\"\nA.

Le Mesurier Taylor.\nBy the death of Leutienant-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor on\nOctober 5th, the Society has lost an old and faithful member\n\u2014\none much interested in its work, and who has himself con-\ntributed not a little in various ways to its progress. Colonel\nTaylor joined the Society very early, and in 1888 became a\nmember of the Finance Committee, on which he continued to serve\ntill his death. He was elected a member of the Council in 1901,\nand was a most regular attendant until his health began to fail.\nBut Colonel Taylor's services were not confined to administra-\ntive work ;\nthey were always at the disposal of the Society for\ninvestigations, and he wrote excellent reports, most careful and\nmethodical, on the cases he looked into. Readers of the Pro-\nceedings and Journal are acquainted with some of these, but\nthere are many more in the archives of the Society, which,\ngiving negative or inconclusive results, have been relegated to\noblivion with the cases to which they refer. He also himself\nassiduously collected cases whicli have appeared from time to\ntime in the Journal and Proceedings. His most important piece\nof original work in connexion with psychical research is an\n\" Experimental Comparison between Chance and Thought-Trans-\nference in Correspondence of Diagrams,\" which was published\nin Proceedings, Vol. VI. The experiment was well devised and\ncarried out, and the recorded result is of permanent value.\nColonel Taylor inclined strongly to spiritistic hypotheses,\nthough he kept an open mind, and he had himself in a private\ncircle witnessed striking instances of movements of objects ap-\nparently without contact. He gave an account of some of these\nand of other experiences in a paper published in Proceedings,\nVol. XIX., under the title \" Report on Various Spiritualistic\nPhenomena.\" He for a long time has kept careful notes of\nthe trance speaking of a friend of his, Mrs. Home, who\nwas one of the autoniatists concerned in the cross-corre-\nspondences centring round \" seven,\" of which an account was\ngiven in Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.\nColonel Taylor's genial and sympathetic presence at business\nmeetings and social gatherings will be much missed by his\ncolleagues in psychical research.\n\fOct., 1911. Confessions of a \" Telepathist.\" 115\nCONFESSIONS OF A \"TELEPATHIST.\"\nWe think that those of our members who do not regularly\nsee the Daily News may be interested in reading the follow-\ning articles and letters, concerning some early experiments of\nthe Society, which appeared in tliat paper during September.\nWe therefore, with the kind permission of the Editor of the\nDaily News, reproduce them here. It may be remarked that\nthis is not the first time Mr. Blackburn has published his\nso-called \" Confession.\" He wrote similar articles in John Bull\nin 1908-9 and now returns to the charge. He writes in\nthe Daily News of Sept. 1st, 1911:\nFor nearly thirty years the telepathic experiments conducted by\nMr. G. A. Smith and myself have been accepted and cited as the\nbasic evidences of the truth of Thought Transference.\nYour correspondent \" Inquirer \" is one of many who have pointed\nto them as a conclusive reply to modern sceptics. The weight\nattached to those experiments was given by their publication in\nthe first volume of the proceedings of the Society for Psychical\nResearch, vouched for by Messrs. F. W. H. Myers, Edmund Gurney,\nFrank Podmore, and later and inferentially by Professor Henry\nSidgwick, Professor Romanes, and others of equal intellectual emi-\nnence. They were the first scientifically conducted and attested\nexperiments in Thought Transference, and later were imitated and\nreproduced by \" sensitives \" all the world over.\nI am the sole survivor of that group of experimentalists, and as\nno harm can be done to anyone, but possible good to the cause of\ntruth, I, with mingled feelings of regret and satisfaction, now\ndeclare that the whole of those alleged experiments were bogies,\nand originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how\neasily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when\nseeking for evidence in support of a theory they were wishful to\nestablish.\nAnd here let me say that I make this avowal in no boastful\nspirit. Within three months of our acquaintance with the leading\nmembers of the Society for Psychical Research Mi*. Smith and\nmyself heartily regretted that these personally charming and\nscientifically distinguished men should have been victimised ; but it\nwas too late to recant. We did the next best thing. We stood\naside and watched with amazement the astounding spread of the\nfire we had in a spirit of mischief lighted.\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1911.\nThe genesis of the matter was in this wise. In the hxte seventies\nand early eighties a wave of so-called occultism passed over\nEngland. Public interest Ijecanie absorbed in the varied alleged\nphenomena of Spiritualism, Mesmerism, and thought-reading; \"pro-\nfessors \" of the various branches abounded, and Brighton, where I\nwas editing a weekly journal, became a happy hunting ground for\nmediums of every kind. I had started an exposure campaign, and\nhad been rather successful. My great score was being the first to\ndetect the secret of Irving Bishop's thought-reading. In 1882 I\nencountered Mr. G. A. Smith, a youth of 19, whom I found giving\na mesmeric entertainment. Scenting a fraud, I proceeded to in-\nvestigate, made his acquaintance, and very soon realised that I had\ndiscovered a genius in his line. He has since been well known as\na powerful hypnotist. He was also the most ingenious conjurer I\nhave met outside the profession. He had the versatility of an\nEdison in devising new tricks and improving on old ones. We\nentered into a compact to \" show up \" some of the then flourishing\nprofessors of occultism, and began by practising thought-reading^\nWithin a month we were astonishing Brighton at bazaars and kin-\ndred charity entertainments, and enjoyed a great vogue. One of\nour exhibitions was described very fully and enthusiastically in\nLight, the spiritualistic paper, and on the strength of that the\nMessrs. Myers, Gurney, and Podmore called on us and asked for a\nprivate demonstration. As we had made a strict rule never to\ntake payment for our exhibitions, we were accepted by the society\nas private unpaid demonstrators, and as such remained during\nthe long series of s(^ances.\nIt is but right to explain that at this period neither of us knew\nor realised the scientific standing and earnest motive of the gentle-\nmen who had approached us. We saw in them only a superior\ntype of the spiritualistic cranks by whom we were daily pestered.\nOur first private seance was accepted so unhesitatingly, and the\nlack of reasonable precautions on the part of the \"investigators\"\nwas so marked, that Smith and I were genuinely amused, and felt\nit our duty to show how utterly incompetent were these \"scientific\ninvestigators.\" Our plan was to bamboozle them thoroughly, then\nlet the world know the value of scientific research. It was the\nvanity of the schoolboy who catches a master tripping.\nA description of the codes and methods of communication in-\nvented and employed by us to establish telepathic rapport would\nneed more space than could be spared. Suffice it that, thanks to\n\fOct., 1911. Confessions of a \" Telepathist.\" ' 117\nthe ingenuity of Smith, they became marvellously complete. They\ngrew with the demands upon them.\nStarting with a crude set of signals produced by the jingling of\npince-nez, sleeve-links, long and short breathings, and even blow-\ning, they developed to a degree little short of marvellous. To this\nday no conjurer has succeeded in approaching our great feat, by\nwhich Smith, scientifically blindfolded, deafened, and muffled in two\nblankets, reproduced in detail an irregular figure drawn by Mr.\nMyers, and seen only by him and me.\nThe value of a contribution such as this should lie not so' much\nin describing the machinery as in pointing out how and where\nthese investigators failed, so that future investigators may avoid\ntheir mistakes.\nI say boldly that Messrs. Myeirs and Gurney were too anxious\nto get corroboration of their theories to hold the balance impar-\ntially. Again and again they gave the benefit of the doubt to\nexperiments that were failures. They allowed us to impose our\nown conditions, accepted without demur our explanations of failure,\nand, in short, exhibited a complaisance and confidence which, how-\never complimentary to us, was scarcely consonant with a strict\ninvestigation on behalf of the public.\nThat this same slackness characterised their investigations with\nother sensitives I am satisfied, for I witnessed many, and the pub-\nlished reports confirmed the susspicion. It is also worthy of note\nthat other sensitives broke down or showed weakness on exactly\nthe same points that Smith and I failed\u2014namely, in visualising\nan article difficult to describe in words signalled by a code. A\nregular figure or familiar object was nearly always seen by the\npercipient, but when a splotch of ink, or a grotesque irregular figure,\nhad to be transferred from one brain to the other, the result was\nalways failure. We, owing to a very ingenious diagram code, got\nnearer than anybody, but our limitations were great.\nSmith and I, by constant practice, became so sympathetic that\nwe frequently brought off startling hits, which were nothing but\nfiukes. The part that fortuitous accident plays in this business\ncan only be believed by those who have become expert in the art\nof watching for and seizing an opportunity. When these hits were\nmade, the delight of the investigators caused them to throw otf\ntheir caution and accept practically anything we off\"ered.\nI am aware it may be reasonably objected that the existence of a\nfalse coin does not prove the non-existence of a good one. My\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., lOll.\nsuggestion as the result of years of observation is that the majority\nof investigators and reporters in psychical research lack that accu-\nrate observation and absence of bias which are essential to rigorous\nand reliable investigation. In fine, I gravely doubt not the bona\nfides, but the capacity, of the witnesses. I could fill columns tell-\ning how, in the course of my later investigations on behalf of the\nSociety for Psychical Research, I have detected persons of other-\nwise unimpeachable rectitude touching uj) and redressing the weak\npoints in their narratives of telepathic experiences.\nMr. Frank Podmore, perhaps the most level-headed of the\nresearchers\u2014and to the end a sceptic\u2014aptly puts it :\n'\u2022\nIt is not the\nfriend whom we know whose eyes must be closed and his ears\nmuffled, but the '\nMr. Hyde,' whose lurking presence in each of us\nwe are only now beginning to suspect.\"\nI am convinced that this propensity to deceive is more general\namong \" persons of character \" than is supposed.

This touching-up process in the\ntelepathic stories I have met again and again, and I say, with full\nregard to the weight of words, that among the hundreds of stories\nI have investigated I have not met one that had not a weak link\nwhich should prevent its being accepted as scientifically established.\nCoincidences that at first sight appear good cases of telepathic\nrapport occur to many of us. I have experienced several, but I\nshould hesitate to present them as perfect evidence.\nAt the risk of giving offence to some, I feel bound to say that\nin the vast majority of cases that I have investigated the principals\nare either biassed in favour of belief in the supernatural or not\npersons whom I should regard as accurate observers and capable of\nestimating the rigid mathematical form of evidence. What one\ndesires to believe requires little corroboration. I shall doubtless raise\na storm of protest when I assert that the principal cause of belief\nin psychic phenomena is the inability of the average m.'in to observe\naccurately and estimate the value of evidence, plus a bias in favour\nof the phenomena being real. It is an amazing fact that I have\nnever yet, after hundreds of tests, found a man who could accurately\ndescribe ten minutes afterwards a series of simple acts which I\nperformed in his presence.

Smith\n:\n\"Let me say at once,\" he began, \"that Mr. Blackburn's story is\na tissue of errors from beginning to end. In the first place I most\nemphatically deny that I ever in any degree, in any way, when\nworking thirty years ago with Mr. Blackburn, attempted to bam-\nboozle Messrs. Myers, Gurney and Podmore. Had such a thing\nbeen possible I had too much admiration and respect for them and\ntoo much respect for myself to try. These gentlemen, long before\nthey met us, had spent years in investigating psychic phenomena,\n\fOct., ]911. Confessions of a \" Telepathist.\" 121\nand were aware of every device and dodge for making sham\nphenomena. They were on the watch not only for premeditated\ntrickery, but for unconscious trickery as well. You could not\ndeceive them, and the quack mediums hated them in consequence.\nWere it not for the teaching of Myers and Gurney on\nthe unreliability of human evidence Mr. Blackburn could not say\nwhat he has said. He is merely repeating what they taught him.\nThe finest expositions of such unreliability are by Myers and\nGurney. They were so highly equipped for this work that the\nbest trick mediums could never do their tricks in their presence.\nI was most closely associated with both men, being private secretary\nto each in turn, and speak the things I know.\"\n\" Can you give me examples of the errors you allege in Mr.\nBlackburn's article 1\n\"\n\" Unfortunately it is only too easy. Let me detail a few. He\nsays Myers, Gurney and Podmore called on us and asked for a\nprivate demonstration. This is not so ; it was Blackburn who first\napproached the Psychical Research Society, and sent them an account\nof his experiments with me and offered a demonstration. He says\nhis first score was his detection of the secret of Irving Bishop's\nthought-reading ; where and when did he detect this and what\nrecord is there of his discovery 1 Prof. Barrett, whose judgment\nhe is now deriding, was the first to do this.\n\" He says we formed a compact to '\nshow up ' the professors.\nWe did no such thing. Blackburn at that time was a serious\ninvestigator, and assuredly I was. . . .\n\"He says I was the most ingenious conjurer he ever met outside\nthe profession, whereas I am the worst conjurer in the world. . . .\nHe says we had a code of signals. We had not a single one\n;\nwe never contemplated the possibility of coding until we learnt it\nfrom Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney themselves. He says we practised\ntogether and brought off startling hits. We never did anything of\nthe kind. He did once say what a journalistic sensation might be\nmade by pretending the phenomena were done by trickery. He\nhas waited, it appears, until he thought all were dead who took\npart in the experiments in order to pretend this.\"\n\"Do you recall, Mr. Smith, what Mr. Blackburn calls 'our great\nfeat,' by which you, scientifically blindfolded, deafened, and muffled\nin two blankets, reproduced in detail an irregular figure drawn by\nMr. Myers and seen only by him and Mr. Blackburn ?\n\"\n\" Yes, I recall it perfectly, and the discussion which followed,\n\f122 Journal of Society for PsyrMcal Research. Oct., loil.\nwhen Mr. Gurney said the only possible way of doing it by trickery\nwas to conceal the drawing in a pencil case and pass it into my\nhand. I was amused to read two years ago in a weekly paper\ncontaining some statements by Mr. Blackburn that he gave this\nvery explanation of how the '\ntrick ' was done !\n\" .\n\" It was no trick then, Mr. Smith ?\n\"\n\"No, it was a bona fide experiment, and the successful result was\neither due to chance or telepathy. I think it most unlikely it was\ndue to chance ;\nthe drawing so closely resembled the original. The\nconditions under which the experiment was carried out were at once\ntoo stringent and too simple to admit of conjuring, and the best\nanswer to those who deny it was telepathy is to ask them to repeat\nthe experiment in the presence of equally qualified observers and\nunder similar conditions.\"\nMr. Smith, when questioned as to the accuracy of Mr. Black-\nburn's statement that he had touched hira (Mr. Smith) eight\ntimes, '\nthat being the only way our code was then worked,'\ndenied that Mr. Blackburn had ever touched him.\n\"... We had no code,\" he said. \" The whole object of the\nexperiment was to obtain thought transference, and all touchings\nwere out of the question. Whenever there was any touching or\ncontact of any description it is always minutely recorded by the\nobservers \u2014see the records of the Psychical Research Society.\n\" Further\u2014and this is most important\u2014none of the experiments\nin which Blackburn was concerned have been put forward by the\nPsychical Eesearch Society in any authoritative work. So far from\nthis being the case the journals of the society ^ contain the following\nstatement made when Mr. Blackburn's '\nconfessions ' first appeared :\nThis so-called confession hid no relation to tlie facts. It would he a\nmistake to suppose that these experiments icere ever regarded, as Mr.\nBlackburn asserts, as the bed-rock foundation of all the later expteriments\nwhich are said to prove the existence of telepathy. On the contrary the\nexperiments in question were not reprinted (as otiiers were) in \" Phantasms\nof the Living\" nor in any other standard work of the kind. Nor is it\ntrue that the conditions tvere thoucjht ideal. In the first scries contact\nwas allotved, and as to the second the experimenters state that it would\nno doubt be an exaggeration to affirm, that the possibility of (auditm-y)\nsignals ivas absolutely excluded. We shall endeavour so to vary tlie con^-\nditions of subsequent experiments as to exclude this hypiothesis completely.\"\n1\nThe statement which Mr. Smith quotes was, as a matter of fact, contained\nnot in the Journal, but in a leaflet printed separately and issued to enquirers.\n\fOct., 1911. Covfessions of a \" Telepathist.\" 123\n\"... The council of the society discussed whether his articles\nshould be replied to, but decided to treat him and his confessions\nwith the contempt both merit. They thought it would be playing\nhis game to treat him seriously.\"\nMr. Blackburn wrote on the following day :\nThe fact that Mr. G. A. Smith is alive supplies another argument\nin support of my pet theory, that most human evidence is unreliable.\nI was informed of his death when I was in Africa, and since my\nreturn two persons who claimed to know him corroborated inde-\npendently, while a letter I addressed to him was returned \"not\nknown.\" Had I been aware of his existence I should not have\nopened up the subject, for I am aware that Mr. Smith, as he\ncon6rms in to-day's interview, spent many of the years that have\nelapsed since our acquaintance in close association with leading\nmembers of the Society for Psychical Eesearch in a fiduciary\ncapacity. I am also aware that that position was the legitimate\nreward for his services in connection with our telepathic \" experi-\nments \" and his undoubted power as a remarkable hypnotist.\nWhile pleased to learn that the bright, amusing, and ingenious\nconfrere of thirty years ago is in the prime of life, I am sorry that\nI should have unintentionally forced him into having to defend a\nposition he has occupied so long. I have been reproached for\npostponing my confession until after the death of the principals.\nI am satisfied that in doing this I showed my regard for those\ngentlemen\u2014Mr. Smith included\u2014and my desire to avoid giving\nthem pain. That Mr. Smith should have to bear the brunt of the\nattack is unfortunate, but quite accidental on my part.\nBut now to business. Mr. Smith gives a categorical denial to\nmy story ; declares that he was a genuine sensitive, and I also the\npossessor of psychic power. He could do no less, and I cannot\nblame him. He was a plucky controversialist in those younger\ndays, and I am prepared to see him put up a tough fight now.\nIn most controversies there is a tendency to obscure the main\nissue by the introduction of minor details. Let us clear the decks\nof unnecessary lumber, such as the question whether I first approached\nthe S.P.R., or they me. It is sufficient that we met. It is also\nagreed that Smith and I conducted many alleged telepathic experi-\nments. It is a fact that those experiments were considered of\nsufficient importance then to be given first place in the official\nreport. Mr. Smith also knows that they excited great interest,\n\f124=- Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1911.\nand that he and I were made much of by many men of scientific\neminence. To attempt to belittle the importance of those experi-\nments now is childish. No doubt greater things have been brought\noff since, but we were the pioneers, and I am satisfied that we\nunintentionally gave scores of subsequent exjjerimenters the cue how\nto become \"telepathic sensitives.\"\nMr. Smith denies that we employed a code. My reply is that\nwithout one it would have been impossible for me to convey to\nhim the figures drawn by the members of the committee for trans-\nference from my brain to that of the blindfolded, blanket-muffled,\nsensitive Smith. Let us dismiss all the other successful experiment5\n\u2014any one of which I will undertake to repeat to-day under identical\nconditions, with the aid of any intelligent confederate\u2014and confine\nourselves to \"our great feat,\" which Mr. Smith tells your inter-\nviewer he recalls perfectly. That feat, if genuine, would establish\ntelepathy beyond cavil. All others sink into insignificance in com-\nparison. It was a master stroke, and so great was the impression\nproduced by it, both upon the \" best trained and best qualified\nobservers in London \" and ourselves, that we decided to retire upon\nour laurels, feeling certain we could never hope to repeat or equal\nit. It was the best and last thing I did. As Mr. Smith repudiates,\nparticipation in the invention, I will take full credit or otherwise\nfor it. I ask that readers will note very carefully every detail in\nthe ensuing description of the trick, for it is they who will have ta\ngive the verdict.\nThe committee had realised the possibility of conveying by signals\na description of a regular figure or any object capable of being\ndescribed in words, and I would direct the attention of those who.\nhave access to the printed copies of the early figures Smith and I\nproduced. It will be noticed that so long as the figures were\ndescribable in words they were fairly accurate reproductions ; but\nthe more irregular and indescribable they became the greater and\nwider were the discrepancies between the original seen by me and\nthe copy produced by Smith. Now I put it as a fair question : If\nSmith could, see what I saw, as he professed, why is it that he\ncould see plainly an equilateral triangle, but fail to see it if one\nof the sides or angles was \"wobbly\" and out of shape? Again,\nif he could reproduce with reasonable accuracy the silhouette of a.\nman's head, easily described by a code, why did he fail when\nthat same head was touched up with black ink protuberances, with,\nthe nose under the chin, a big ear on the back of the head, and\n\fOct., 1911. Confessions of a \" Telepathist.\" 125\nso on 1 The reason was simple. Our code was confined to regular,\nor fairly regular, figures. It would have taken hours to spell out\na full description of that figure by the sounds, movements, intervals\nof time, bogus mesmeric passes that stirred his hair, and the\nnumerous, almost imperceptible, signals that formed perhaps the\nmost complex and efl'ective code ever used by conjurers. I doubt\nwhether any person could write at leisure a description of such an\nobject so accurately as to enable another one to reproduce the.\nfigure from that description.\nThis reasonable point of view occurred to the committee, and\nthey abandoned regular figures for complex indescribables. Need\nI say that we failed again and again ? In fact, we ceased any\nattempt to \"transfer\" them. I had a signal, which I gave Smith\nwhen the drawing was impossible. We made a pretence of trying\nhard, but, after a time, would give up on the stock explanation of\n\" absence of rapport.\" Mr. Smith is angry with me for holding in\nlight esteem the capacity of Messrs. Myers and Gurney for taking\nprecautions against deception. I confess that their irregular drawings\ncompletely snuiTed out the psychic power which, according to Mr.\nSmith, I possessed without knowing it. As a matter of fact, the\ncommittee were beginning to have grave doubts when the \"great\nfeat \" I shall now describe saved our reputations and enabled me at\nleast to carry out my bat.\nThese were the conditions : Smith sat in a chair at a large table.\nHis eyes were padded with wool, and, I think, a pair of folded kid\ngloves, and bandaged with a thick dark cloth. His ears were filled\nwith one layer of cotton-wool, then pellets of putty. His entire\nbody and the chair on which he sat were enveloped in two very\nheavy blankets. I remember, when he emerged triumphant, he\nwas wet with perspiration, and the paper on which he had success-\nfully drawn the figure was so moist that it broke during the\nexamination by the delighted observers. Beneath his feet and\nsurrounding his chair were thick, soft rugs, rightly intended to\ndeaden and prevent signals by feet shutHes\u2014a wise precaution, for\nin our early experiments my feet did marvellous things. Smith\nbeing rendered contact proof and perfectly insulated, my part\nbegan.\nAt the farther side of the room\u2014a very large dining-room\n\u2014\nMr. Myers showed me, with every precaution, the drawing that I\nwas to transmit to the brain beneath the blankets. It was a tangle\nof heavy black lines, interlaced, some curved, some straight, the\n\f1'2G Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., I9ii.\nsort of thing an infant playing with a pen or pencil might produce,\nand I am certain absolutely indescribable in words, let alone a code.\nI took it, fixed my gaze on it, pacing the room meanwhile and\ngoing through the usual process of impressing the figure upon my\nretina and brain, but always keeping out of touching distance with\nSmith. These preliminaries occupied perhaps ten or more minutes,\nfor we made a point of never hurrying. I drew and redrew the\nfigure many times openly in the presence of the observers, in order,\nas I explained and they allowed, to fix it on my brain. I also\ndrew it, secretly, on a cigarette jDaper. By this time I was fairly\nexpert at palming, and had no diflSculty, while pacing the room\ncollecting \" rapport,\" in transferring the cigarette paper to the tube\nof the brass protector on the pencil I was using. I conveyed to\nSmith the agreed signal that I was ready by stumbling against the\nedge of the thick rug near his chair.\nNext instant he exclaimed: \"I have it.\" His right hand came\nfrom beneath the blanket, and he fumbled about the table, saying,\naccording to arrangement: \"Where's my penciH\"\nImmediately I placed mine on the table. He took it and a long\nand anxious pause ensued.\nThis is what was going on under the blanket. Smith had\nconcealed up his waistcoat one of those luminous painted slates\nwhich in the dense darkness gave sufficient light to show the figure\nwhen the almost transparent cigarette paper was laid flat on the\nslate. He pushed up the bandage from one eye, and copied the\nfigure with extraordinary accuracy. It occupied over five minutes.\nDuring the time I was sitting exhausted with the mental eff'ort\nquite ten feet a^vay.\nPresently Smith threw back the blanket and excitedly pushing\nback the eye bandage produced the drawing, which was done on\na piece of notepaper, and very nearly on the same scale as the\noriginal. It was a splendid copy.\nI ask a discriminating public to compare my explanation with\nMr. Smith's. He says :\n\" It was a bona fide experiment, and the\nsuccessful result was either due to chance or telepathy. I think it\nmost unlikely that it was due to chance, the drawing so closely\nresembled the original. The conditions under which the experiment\nwas carried out were at once too stringent and too simple to admit\nof conjuring, and the best answer to those who deny it was telepathy\nis to ask them to repeat the experiment in the presence of equally\nqualified observers, and under similar conditions.\"\n\fOct., 1911. Confessions of a \" Telepathist.\" ' 127\nI do not wish to take advantage of an obvious slip, for Mr. Smith\ncan hardly mean what he says in the last few lines quoted. How\ncan those who doubt the experiment prove it? I will put it in the\nway Mr. Smith probably meant.\nI challenge Mr. Smith or any other person to reproduce that\nexperiment under the same conditions ; I to draw the figure and\ninsulate both the experimenters, also to examine their clothes, etc.\nI also stipulate that the experiment shall take place in an apartment\nnot known to the experimenters till they enter it. If under those\nconditions an irregular figure can be produced bearing a reasonable\nresemblance to the original I will not only admit that our great\nfeat was genuine, but will immediately proceed to cultivate that\npsychic power which Mr. Smith insists I must possess, but of which\nso far I am unconscious.\nIn conclusion, I wish to convey to Mr. Smith my sincere regret\nfor having unintentionally forced him into his present position. I\nhave always retained a pleasant recollection of our short association,\nand during a very variegjited life have been more than once able to\namuse and bewilder friends by practising some of the feats of leger-\ndemain he taught me, but which he now so modestly repudiates.\nDouglas Blackburn.\nA further interview with Mr. G. A. Smith was published\nin the Daily Neivs on Sept. 6th, in which he denies Mr.\nBlackburn's statement\n:\n\" It is the most amazing piece of invention ever brought to my\nnotice,\" [he] said. . . . \"All the essential points of Mr. Blackburn's\narticle are untrue, and I deny the whole story from beginning\nto end.\n\"There were in all 31 telepathic experiments in which Mr. Black-\nburn and I were concerned, and these are recorded in the '\nProceedings\nof the Psychical Research Society.' Mr. Blackburn has especially\ndirected attention to the experiment which produced what in the\n'Proceedings' referred to (Vol. I., Third Report on Thought Trans-\nference) is known as Figure 22. Let me Cjuote from that report,\nwhich is signed by Mr. Gurney, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Mr. Podmore,\nand Professor Barrett.\nWe have noiv to consider- u-hethcr it was jmsible that any information\nof the character of the designs drawn could have reached Smith through\nike ordinary avenues of sense.

There remains the sense of hearing, which\nwas hut partially interfered, with bij the bandage over the eyes and the ears.\nBut the iiformation can certainly not have been conveyed by speech; our\nears were as near to Mr. Blackburn as Mr. Smith's, and our eyes would\nhave caught the slightest moveivmt of his lips.\nAlluding to the hypothesis of a code of audible signals other than\noral speech, the report continues :\nLet our readers, who may he familiar with the Morse or any other code\nof signals, try in some such ivay to convey a description of some of our\ndrawings to a friend who is blindfolded, and has not seeji the original;\ntue venture to assert that, even if audible signs were allowed, several\nminutes at least would be required to convey the notion of the figures\ncorrectly. It is probably no exaggeration to say that several scores, if\nnot hundreds, of precise signs would be required to convey an idea\nas exact as that implied in many of Mr. Smith's representations,\n. , . and since our attention, during this part of the experiment, was\nconcentrated on the relation between Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Smith we\nare at a loss to conceive hoiv any signalling, sufficient in amount to\nconvey the required ideas, could have passed undetected. . . . However,\nwith the view of removing all doubts that might arise as to possible\nauditory communications, we on one occasion stopped Mr. Smith's ears\nwith putty, then tied a bandage round his eyes and ears, then fastened\na bolster-case over the head, and over all threw a blanket which enveloped\nhis entire head and trunk. Fig. 22 was now draicn by one of us and\nshown outside the. room to Mr. Blackburn, who on his return sat behind\nMr. Smith, and in no contact with him whatever, and as perfectly still\nas it is possible for a human being to sit who is not concentrating his\nattention on keeping motionless to tite exclusion of every other object.

Even had\ntrickery, as Mr. Blackburn alleges, been involved, there was no neces-\nsity for a luminous slate. I had quite sufficient light to see to draw\nwhat I wanted to draw.

He claims to possess '\nthe most complete and effective\ncode ever used by conjurers.' Further, he undertakes to repeat\nto-day, with the aid of any intelligent confederate, any one of the\nthirty-one drawings of experiments in thought transference published\n\u2022in 1882 by the Psychical Research Society, in which he acted as\nagent. Let him substantiate his claims. . . . You have only to\nlook at the drawings drawn by me and reproduced in Vol. I. of\nthe Psychical Research Society's Proceedings to see that it is most\ndifficult to describe them in speech or writing. It is for Mr. Black-\nburn to do what he claims he can do. He has appealed to demon-\nstration; let demonstration decide.\"\nIn the same issue is published a brief interview with Pro-\nfessor Barrett, in which he gives \" an emphatic verdict i'or Mr.\nSmith.\"\n\"Mr. Blackburn,\" he said, . . . \"thought Mr. Smith was dead\nand apparently he thought I was dead too, for he described himself\nas the sole survivor of those who were present at the experiment.\nNow I was present at that experiment, and yon may say that not only\nI, but Myers and Gurney, had the most absolute confidence in Mr.\nSmith. . . . After the experiment Mr. Smith visited me in Dublin,\nand I carried out there a series of extremely drastic tests with him.\"\nProfessor Barrett denied that the theory of thought-transfer-\nence rested largely on the Smith-Blackburn case. His own\nexperiments, he said, began years before, and in those experi-\nments he was joined by many other researchers. He concluded\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

As Mr. Smith has replied effectively to what he mildly\ncharacterises as Mr. Blackburn's \" tissue of errors,\" I need add little\nexcept that all communication of the leading workers in psychical\nresearch with Mr. Blackburn ceased not long after the experiments in\nquestion, and that, on the other hand, the connection of Mr. G.

He took\npart not oidy in experiments, but in inquiries, investigations, and\nclerical work, and acted for some considerable time as Mr. Gurney's\nvalued private secretary and assistant.\nMr. Blackburn may have been, as he seems to imply, engaged in\npsychical research, whether honestly or dishonestly, for many years,\nbut it has not been in connection with the Society for Psychical\nKesearch. I should doubt his having made any investigations for\n\fOct., 1911. Confessions of a \" Telepathist.\" 131\nthe society, or having ever attended any experiments published in\nits \"Proceedings\" except those in which he now asserts that he\nplayed the part of fraudulent telepathic agent. What are we to\nthink of a man who makes a virtue of withholding a confession till\nhe believes (fortunately erroneously) that all who could contradict\nhim are dead 1\nI may add that the experiments in which Mr. Blackburn was\nconcerned form but a very small part of those on which the case\nfor telepathy rests. Anyone may convince himself of this by studying\nthe numerous volumes of the \"Proceedings\" of the Society for\nPsychical Research. There have been many experiments by different\nagents and percipients.\nStill, as Mr. Smith points out, but little is yet known of the process\nor of the conditions that ensiu'e success ;\nand, in the opinion of\nmyself and my colleagues, further experiments in transferring\ndiagrams or other definite images or ideas are much to be desired.\nThe Society for Psychical Research is always glad to hear of experi-\nments being tried, and its officers are always willing to give any\nadvice and assistance to would-be experimenters that they can.\nE.

Journal.)\nAugust Ibth, 1911.\nMay I be allowed to make a few observations on Professor\nBarrett's article, \" Poltergeists Old and New,\" in this month's\nProceedings 1\nI shall confine my remarks to the first two cases, viz. those alleged\nto have happened at Enniscorthy and Derrygonnelly respectively, as\nthe first of these was specially reported for Prof Barrett, and the\nsecond was personally observed by him. Let us take the Ennis-\ncorthy case first, as investigated by Mr. N. J. Murphy, whose report\nProf Barrett designates as \"admirable.\" If this merely means that\nthe report is that of an educated and conscientious eye-witness, who\nhas given us his experiences in a temperate and convincing manner,\nI, for one, thoroughly agree with Prof. Barrett's description. I\nhave no doubt whatever that Mr. Murphy saw what he describes.\nBut if I am asked if Mr. Murphy's report helps us to account for\nthe causes of what he saw, and particularly in the direction of the\nexclusion of human agency, I am afraid I shall have to say that it\nfalls somewhat short of excellence in this respect. I submit that\nbefore we can call the \"Poltergeist\" to our aid in this particular\n\fOct., 1911. Correspondence. 133\ncase, we must place it beyond all reasonable doubt that the\nmanifestations were not due to human agency alone. As far as I\nam concerned, while I cannot positively assert that Randall was\nthe agent, the investigation of the occurrences being such as it\nis, I cannot say that I am any farther on the road to believing\nthat \" Poltergeists \" do or do not exist than I was before I read\nProf. Barrett's observations on this case.\nMr. Murphy, by his own account, knew pretty well what par-\nticular phenomena to expect. They may be roughly stated as raps,\nremoval of Randall's bedclothes, and the moving of Sinnott's heavy\nbedstead.\nNow, one would imagine that anyone on the point of setting\nforth to investigate the causes of certain unexplained happenings\nwould make up his mind to keep a particular look-out for any loop-\nhole for human agency, especially on the part of the subject of the\nmanifestations. For instance, one might imagine him saying\n:\n\" Randall's bedclothes are liable to sudden removal. Well, then, if\nI insist on seeing the bedclothes laid over him piece by piece when\nhe gets into bed, the clothes then tucked in, Randall lying with his\narms outside, so that I can see his hands, and if I sit so near the\nbed that I can detect any stealthy or sudden movement of his\nbody or lower limbs\u2014then, if the bedclothes glide off him and\nunder the bed, I shall have to report that no human agency,\ndirected in any ordinary channel, was the cause.\" On the other\nhand, what do we find in Mr. Murphy's report 1 It is true that\nthe bedclothes and room are examined before Randall gets into bed,\nbut this is all. For anything the report says to the contrary,\nRandall lies down, disposing the bedclothes as he likes, and possibly\ncompletely covered by them, except his head. If he did so, what\ncould prevent him from passing a loose bottom end of the upper\nsheet along the far side of the bed, and pulling it, aided by stealthy\nmovements of his feet, until it gradually glided off him over the\nfoot of the bed, drawing with it the superincumbent blankets, etc. 1\nOn July 29th bedclothes would probably be fairly light. Personally\nI cannot help feeling amused at the apparent importance attached\nby Mr. Murphy to the way in which the bedclothes \"appeared to\nbe actually going back under the bed much in the same position\none would expect bedclothes to be if a strong breeze were blowing\nthrough the room at the time.\" I may say I also think this im-\nportant, though probably for reasons different from those of Mr.\nMurphy. If the occupant of the bed were himself drawing the\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., I9il.\nbedclothes over the foot of the bed, by holding a loose lower end,\nthe clothes would naturally tend to go under the bed towards the\nunseen hand reaching down over the far side and underneath the\nbedstead. No doubt Randall would have scorned the action, but a\npin inserted at the top of the bedclothes would have materially\nassisted their passage together off the bed, and could have been\ninstantly withdrawn from the clothes while Mr. Murphy was\nmaking a \" thorough search under the bed for strings or wires.\"\nAfter this, Mr. Murphy \"adjusted the clothing again properly on\nthe bed.\" This time, as Randall had not had the disposing of the\nbedclothes, there would be no opportunity of drawing them off the\nbed, unless he himself accompanied them, and it is a great pity\nthat a light was only struck \"just in time to see Randall slide\nfrom the bed,\" i.e. just when gravity might be expected to take up\nwhat the \"Poltergeist\" had so ably begun. Any process of\nwriggling, or working body and bedclothes downwards, that might\npossibly be supposed to have occurred under cover of pretended\nstruggles to resist the force which was drawing him from the bed,\nif any such wriggling, etc., occurred, would have been hidden\nor obscured by the partial darkness. Anyhow, I confidently deny\nthe existence of any merely visual indication by which anybody\ncan tell whether a man who is sliding gradually oft' a couch, at\nthe same time professing to resist the force that is compelling him,\nis doing so voluntarily or not.\nAgain, it is significant that no movement of the other heavy\nbedstead took place under Mr. Murphy's observation. According\nto the servant, the only movement of the bedstead of which she\nhad heard occurred when it was occupied by \"the two young men\"\n(p. 385), i.e. Sinnott and the third lodger. Randall himself is our\nonly authority for the assertion that it moved with three men in\nit, including himself (p. 388). This, of course, would practically\nexclude his agency, but, in face of the servant's story, who, one\nwould think, would have mentioned the greater rather than the lesser\nmarvel, had she ever heard of it, and having regard to the fact\nthat no statement of any kind from Randall's room-mates is at\npresent forthcoming, I prefer to reserve my opinion on this point.\nI can only say that if the bed with the two men in it moved while\nRandall was in his own bed, I do not see why he should not have\nmoved it by a stout cord passed round a leg near the floor by its\nmiddle. At any moment, by releasing one end, he could have\ndrawn away and hidden the cord. No doubt the bedstead was a\n\fOct., 1911. Gorrespondence. 135\nheavy one, but one can move by traction objects which appear beyond\none's strength when only a combination of lifting and pushing is\napplied.\nI regret that I am unable to see why Randall's \"terribly frightened\ncondition precludes any supposition that he was privy to any human\nagency being employed to effect the manifestation.\" If a sweeping\nassertion like this is to hold good, I do not see why the law should\nnot at once determine the precise amount of guilty or innocent\nbearing necessary to \"preclude any supposition\" that an accused\nperson is or is not guilty of the crime. I maintain that it is equally\nopen to us to argue that Randall's fright might be due to the fact\nthat, having previously made a great fuss about his abnormal\nexperiences, and knowing these to be of his own contriving, he\nviewed the introduction of an investigator of superior calibre to\nthe former witnesses of his marvels with considerable trepidation.\nAs regards the Derrygonnelly case, we are, I think, on firmer\nground, as Prof. Barrett was himself a witness of the manifestations.\nI can only say that while Prof. Barrett's brief summary does not,\nto my mind, exclude the possibilit}' of human agency for the\nphenomena, any difficulties I may meet with would possibly be\ncleared up had I access to the fuller account in the Dublin University\nMagazine.\nI will only make one observation. It is on the test applied\npersonally by Prof. Barrett to the \" Poltergeist \" or other agent.\nHe says, \"I mentally asked it, no word being spoken, to knock a\ncertain number of times, and it did so. To avoid any error or\ndelusion on my part,^ I put my hands in the side pocket of my\novercoat and asked it to knock the number of fingers I had open.\"\nI can only say how much I regret that Prof Barrett did not keep\non with his first test. He could easily have avoided \" any error or\ndelusion \" by asking his friend to count the raps given in answer to\nhis mental invitation. If the \"agent\" had given, say, 15, 3, 26, 9 raps\non four separate occasions in response to Professor Barrett's four\nseparate mental invitations, the fact that some other than human\nagency must be concerned would be practically established. Instead\nof doing this, Prof. Barrett, to my mind most unfortunately, abandons\nthe test after one successful result, which might, of course, be due to\npure chance, and adopts another, which can be easily seen to be far\nmore open to error.\nHad Prof Barrett written, \" In order to increase the chance of\n. . . - . . ^The italics are mine. \u2014H. G, A. M,\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt. Oct.,1911.\nerror or delusion on my part, I,\" etc. I think his words would have\nsuited his action better, for the following reasons\n:\n(\u00ab) He at once limited the agent to a choice from among ten\nnumbers, by employing his ten fingers, thus lessening the value of\nthe test.\n{h) He set himself to do two things at once, i.e. to inhibit any\nmuscular action of his fingers which would increase or diminish the\nnumber held out in his pockets, and at the same time to count the\nraps given by the agent.\nNow, let anyone lie in bed uncertain of the time, and try to\nresolve not to clasp or unclasp any of his fingers, so that he may\nbe absolutely certain whether he has moved one of them or not, and\nat the same time listen to a neighbouring clock and tell the time.\nI am certain that the result would be either that he would know\nhe had not moved a finger but be not quite sure whether it was 11\nor 12 that struck, or that he would have heard the clock correctly but\nwould have some doubt about the absolute immobility of his fingers.\nNow, in the first test, he would only have to think, say 41, and\nstow it away in his memory, perhaps with the aid of some\ntag, e.g. \" My brother's age\u201441,\" and then set himself to count the\nraps. In this case the act of deciding upon the number thought of\nis over and irrevocable. In the second test, the act of fixing and\nmaintaining a certain number of fingers in position is coincident with\nthe counting of the raps, a most potent incentive to unconscious\nself-deception, either in opening or closing an extra finger to meet\nthe number of raps, or miscounting the raps to suit the number of\nfingers. \u2014I am, Madam, Your obedient servant,\nH. G. A. Moore, Assoc. S.P.R.\nFulford Barracks, York.\nSept. 13th, 1911.\nThe Editor having kindly sent me a proof of the above letter, I\ndesire to remove a misconception which Major Moore appears to\nhave formed in reference to my experiments with the Derrygonnelly\npoltergeist. The number (from 1 to 10) which I wished rapped was\nsilently thought of in each case, and the corresponding lumiber of\nfingers opened simply as a record in place of pencil and paper. To\nhave selected a high number, such as Major Moore suggests, would\nhave given rise to uncertainty in counting and have been less\ndesirable on other grounds.\nAs regards the Enniscorthy poltergeist Major Moore's criticisms\nwill, I hope, be answered by the observers who were present. I\nwill only state that his hypotheses appear to me quite as incredible\nas any supernormal theory. W, F. Barrett,\n\fNo. CCLXXXIII.\u2014Vol. XV.

Verkall.\nThe latest issue of the Proceedings of the American Society\nfor Psycliiccd^ Eesearch (Vol. V., Part 1., April, 1911) contains\nan interesting report by Professor J. H. Hyslop, on \" A Case\n\fNov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 141\nof Hysteria.\" The subject, Anna Burton,^ a girl about twenty\nyears old, produces physical phenomena of the usual medium-\nistic type ostensibly under spirit control. None of the\ninvestigators\u2014none at least of those who had any opportunity\nfor a prolonged examination of the case\u2014have any doubt that\nin her normal condition Miss Burton is perfectly honest, and\nshe has freely submitted herself to every suggested test. The\ndevelopment of the case is thus described by Mrs. Milton, with\nwhom Miss Burton lives :\n\" Being greatly interested in spirit\nphenomena, ... I decided to make some experiments in my\nown home, ... a very favourable opportunity having presented\nitself. A child of thirteen summers\u2014Miss Anna Burton\n\u2014\ncame to make her home with me. She seemed gifted with\noccult powers, as little raps indicated during her sleeping hours.\nFeeling that the child was too young to sit for development,\nI gradually interested her in the phenomena, and after two\nyears of play and study we decided to sit for development.\"\nMrs. Milton was present at all the sittings referred to in\nthis report, with one exception. On that occasion the\nphenomena took place as usual and they were also unaffected\nby any precautions taken against the possibility of fraud on\nher part. It is, therefore, almost certain that she is in no\nway concerned in their production : nevertheless it appears to\nme that it would be desirable in case of further investigation\nto exclude from the sittings all persons except those having a\npurely scientiiic interest in the observation of the phenomena.\nThe seances were held at first in a dim light, but soon\ninstructions were given by raps that they should be held in\nthe dark. Shortly afterwards, in accordance with further in-\nstructions, music was provided in the shape of a phonograph.\nThe phenomena produced under these circumstances include raps,\nlevitation of a table weighing about 100 lbs., movements of\nvarious small objects such as a bell and tambourine, ostensibly\nwithout contact, the tying of the medium to her chair with a\n38 foot clothes-line, whistlino- and siniiing in various voices.\nAt these sittings the medium's hands were sometimes held,\nbut there was no attempt to impose rigorous test conditions.\nIn June, 1908, the case came under the observation of two\n1 All names given in the Report, except Professor Hj-slop's, are pseudonyms, as\nit has been thought desirable to conceal \"Miss Burton's\" identity.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1911.\nmedical men, Dr. Smyth and Dr. Hamilton. In the course\nof a long series of sittings they were able to prove, by means of\nflashlight photographs, that some, at any rate, of the phenomena\nwere produced by the direct agency of the medium. In one\nphotogj-aph she appears holding the tambourine in her hand\n;\nin another she has it in her teeth and is evidently in the act\nof tossing it into the air. But these discoveries did not destroy\nthe psychological interest of the case, since the experimenters\nsatisfied themselves that the phenomena were not to be\nexplained by conscious and deliberate fraud, but were produced\nby the medium when she was in a condition of \" hysteria,\"\ndefined by Professor Hyslop as \" physiological and mental\nconditions that limit or eliminate normal consciousness.\"\nIt was at this stage of the proceedings that Professor Hyslop's\nown investigation of the case began. In conjunction with Dr.\nSmyth and Dr. Hamilton he held a large number of sittings,\nwith a view to ascertaining more exactly the nature of the\nphenomena, the method of their production, and the physical\nand mental condition of the medium. By means of \" severe\ntests for anaesthesia \" the experimenters convinced themselves\nof the genuineness of Miss Ikirton's trance. The anaesthesia\nappears to have varied in regard to the area affected, being\nsometimes confined to one arm, sometimes extending over the\nwhole hoily from the neck downwards. In view of the\nimportance of this question in its bearing on the psychological\naspect of the case, it is unfortunate, 1 think, that the report\ndoes not state more precisely the nature of the tests applied\nand the degree of anaesthesia that was observed. Upon the\nquestion of \" motor dissociation,\" as Professor Hyslop calls it,\ngreater precision would also have been desirable. It frequently\nhappened that one of Miss Burton's hands was held, the other\nbeing left free for the production of phenomena. Under these\ncircumstances the experimenters sometimes failed to observe any\nsympathetic muscular action in the hand under control corre-\nsponding to such movements of other parts of Miss Burton's\nbody as would have been necessitated by the nature of the\nphenomena (assuming, as the experimenters now did, that these\nwere piodiiced by her direct agency). But where the muscular\nforce which Miss Burton needed to exert was not great, it is\nsurely possilile that any sympathetic muscular action which was\n\fNov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 143\nset up would be too slight to be perceptible without some much\nmore delicate test than was supplied by merely clasping the\nmedium's hand in complete darkness. On one occasion, when\nan attempt was made to levitate the table\u2014an action requiring\nconsiderable muscular effort\u2014Professor Hyslop observed \" con-\nvulsive muscular movements of the right hand,\" which he was\nholding.\nBut apart from the question of anaesthesia or motor dissocia-\ntion, there is evidence in the nature of the phenomena to\nshow that Miss Burton is not in a normal state during the\nseances. She then appears to possess faculties which ostensibly\nshe does not possess at other times, and which it is difficult\nto suppose she has had any means of acquiring. She displays, for\nexample, a delicacy and accuracy of touch, which seem to amount\nalmost to a faculty of \" seeing in the dark.\" Dr. Hamilton\nrelates how, on one occasion \" with the room in total darkness,\nand while sitting at the right of the medium, I was made\naware of the presence of a foreign body in my left eye, which\nbegan paining me very much and caused me to speak about\nit. Immediately a hand came out of the darkness and began\nstroking my eye in a very unusual manner, with unusual\ndelicacy of touch. The invisible hand placed the tips of the\nindex and middle fingers on the upper eyelid at the outer\ncanthus, and by a delicate stroke with an inward and rolling\nmotion carried the finger tips to the inner canthus, and then\nbeginning over again repeated the act several times until the\nforeign body was removed. The hand that carried out the opera-\ntion seemed to know the moment that the object was removed\nfrom the eye. The skill in handling the eye was very striking\nand impressed me very much. I had years before made a\npractice of eye surgery, and my impressions about the skill\nused were based upon considerable experience with manipula-\ntions of the eye.\" At another time Dr. Hamilton asked \" the\ncontrol,\" when the room was in darkness, \" to touch the\nextended tip of his right forefinger pointed straight up in the\nair, and this she did several times with unerring accuracy,\neven when he placed his other fingers and thumb around it,\nwith the purpose of seeing whether she would touch around\nor feel for the finger.\" Drs. Hamilton and Smyth \" tried to\naccomplish this test with each other, but found that, when\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1911.\nthe forefinger which was to be touched was moved a number\nof inches from where it had been located before, it was impos-\nsible to touch the forefin\u00a3;er without touchino- some of the\nother fingers surrounding it.\"\nIn the trance-singing and whistling there seems also to be\nevidence of some extension of faculty. It is impossible to prove\nthat the medium does not possess the required skill in her\nnormal state, but the presumption is strongly against it. Unless\nin trance, she has never been known to whistle \" except to call\na dog,\" but the trance-whistling shows considerable technical\nskill. In the trance-singing the extension of faculty is not so\nmarked, but in the case of both singing and whistling the observers\nfound a curious difficulty in localising the sound. That it is\nproduced by her throat and lips may be inferred from the\nfact that movements of her larynx have been observed during\nthe singing, and all attempts to produce whistling whilst her\nlips were held have failed. But the sound often appeared to\ncome from a place about three or four feet from the ascer-\ntained position of the medium's head. Of this phenomenon\nthe experimenters have no explanation to offer. It may be\ncompared with the difficulty experienced in localising raps\n(see below).\nAnother phenomenon which frequently occurs is the appear-\nance of lights. Of these no satisfactory explanation is at\npresent forthcoming. As they always appear in close proximity\nto the medium and only when her hands are not controlled,\nand as a smell of phosphorus has been observed, the pre-\nsumption must be that, like the other phenomena, they are\nproduced by normal means. But attempts to trace the material\nemployed have so far failed, nor have the experimenters been\nable to reproduce the effects observed by means of such pre-\nparations of phos^jhorus as Miss Burton might be supposed to\nhave at her disposal On several occasions Miss Burton was\ncarefully searched ^ before the seance, she was dressed in clothes\nspecially provided, and her hands were washed. Nothing sus-\npicious was discovered and the lights occurred as usual. The\nonly incident which appears to offer any indication as to how\nthis phenomenon is produced occurred at one of the earlier\n^ The method of searching, which was thorough, is described in detail ; Mrs.\nMilton took no part in it.\n\fNov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 145\nsittings. \" Dr. Smyth suspected that she might have matches in\nher mouth, and suddenly seized her and forced her mouth open,\nfinding the saliva saturated with phosphorescent light, and it\nran out into her lap, still showing the light in her lap. But\nhe did not find a trace of a match in her mouth and no\nevidence that anything else had been prepared for the situa-\ntion.\" On the occasions when Miss Burton was searched, her\nmouth also was examined and nothing suspicious was found.\nBut the examination presumably took place in the light. It\nwould have been interesting to examine her mouth in the\ndark both before the seance and during the production of lights\nto see whether any trace of phosphorescence could be found.\nAnother phenomenon upon which the experimenters came to\nno certain conclusion is the production of raps. These were\nvery frequent, instructions as to the manner of conducting the\nseance being given in this way. Professor Hyslop is inclined\nto think that they are supernormal in origin on account of\n\" the versatility with which they were produced and apparently\nlocated in different places, either spontaneously or at request.\"\nHe relates that once raps were heard, which he and Mrs.\nMilton independently located at a distance of ten or twelve\nfeet from the medium, and on another occasion whilst he was\nstanding by the window, six feet from Miss Burton, raps\nwere located on the sill ; he could see Miss Burton distinctly,\nand detected no motion of her hands or feet. He experi-\nmented with raps normally produced under similar circum-\nstances, and found no such error of location as must be\nassumed in the case of the trance raps, unless we ascribe\nthem to some supernormal physical agency. The presumption\nmust be that the effect was due to some sensory illusion on the\npart of the observers as to the locality of the sound. But as\nthe case stands at present no certain inference can be drawn.\nMiss Burton has also produced whilst in trance a considerable\namount of automatic writing, some of which is of interest from\na psychological aspect, but not provably beyond wdiat may be\nexplained by coincidence and subconscious memory.\nIf we accept the conclusion of the investigators as to the\ngenuineness of Miss Burton's trance\u2014and it seems hardly possible\nthat they should have been mistaken on this point\u2014the case\nraises several interesting psychological problems. It is evident\n\f14G Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., I9il.\nthat wheu in trance Miss Burton is perfectly aware of the\nfraudulent nature of her phenomena. On one occasion '\nthe\ncontrols ' were asked to stop and start the phonograph \" under\ntest conditions;' that is to say, when Miss Burton's hands and\nfeet were held. After some unsuccessful attempts this was\ndone, whereupon Professor Hyslop called for the light, \" and at\nonce there began a vigorous struggle on the part of Miss\nBurton to get free. I managed to hold her, and when the\nlight was turned up . . . there on the key of the machine\nwas one of the pieces of rope which usually lies on the\ntable, tied in a knot, and probably put under the armpits\nfor pulling and relaxing it suitably to start and stop the\nmachine.\" Miss Burton's left hand had been free for a short\ntime just before the phenomenon occurred, and she had evidently\nused this opportunity to attach the rope. Her struggle to\nfree herself makes it almost certain that she was aware of\nwhat she had done, and wished to remove the rope before\nit could be seen. Again, if we suppose that the lights are\nproduced by any normal means, preparations must be made\nbefore the sittings. There is some reason for thinking that\nMiss Burton occasionally lapses into trance at unexpected\ntimes, and it may be then that she procures the required\nmaterials.\nBut the whole question of the relation between Miss\nBurton's various mental states is by no means clear at present.\nProfessor Hyslop thinks that there is evidence of what he\ncalls \" subliminal honesty.\" He mentions as an indication of\nthis that, although when Miss Burton's hands were held,\n\" there were constant automatic efforts to obtain their release,\"\nthe hands would be voluntarily restored to control \" It is\ncertain,\" he says, \"from the repeated efforts to do things\nhonestly and under test conditions, that at least one, or some\nof her secondary personalities, are perfectly honest, and we can\nescape the hypothesis of outside agencies inspiring automatic\nactions to do them only by supposing that one of these\nsecondary personalities is tricky wlien the others are honest.\"\nIt appears to me that such expressions as Professor Hyslop\nuses suggest a much more complete \" differentiation of\npersonality \" than there is evidence to show exists in the\npresent case. Phenomena similar to that which Professor\n\fKov., 1911. The Case of Anna Burton. 147\nHyslop describes in regard to Miss Burton's hands, may be\nobserved in the case of persons whose psychological condition\nis normal, when they are trying to break themselves of an\nacquired habit. In proportion as the attention is concentrated\nor relaxed, the habit will be checked or will assert itself.\nNow, ex hi\/pothcsi, Miss Burton, when in a \" hysterical\" condition,\nhas formed a habit of producing physical phenomena fraudu-\nlently, but her normal self is honest. According to the\nreport of the investigators, the depth of the trance varies,\nand sometimes during the sittings the medium appears not\nto be in trance at all. Under these circumstances, it is to\nbe expected that there should be alternations between \" normal\n\"\nhonesty and \" hysterical \" fraud. Professor Hyslop's theory\nseems to imply that there is a complete separation between\nMiss Burton's normal self and the \" trance personalities.\" If he\nhas evidence to prove this supposition, which, from the nature\nof the case, seems an unlikely one, this is not apparent from\nthe report.\nBut however that may be, the phenomena are certainly\nworth careful study, as an instance of the way in which faculties\nmay be subconsciously developed. It is unfortunate that\nthere was no opportunity for scientific investigation of the\ncase during its early stages. It would have been interesting\nto note the process of development. Would it not be possible\nto repair this omission to some extent by suggesting new types\nof phenomena to be produced, and noting what response, if\nany, is obtained ?\nProfessor Hyslop calls attention in his report to the many\ndifficulties which beset investigators in such a case as this,\nand if we take these difiiculties into account it is not surpris-\ning that many questions should be left unanswered. But\nit is greatly to be hoped that further investigation may be\npossible, especially with a view to determining the precise\nnature and extent of the hyperaesthetic faculties possessed by\nMiss Burton in trance, and, secondly, to determine whether\nthere is any evidence of supernormal physical powers, e.g.\nin regard to the production of raps or lights. A clear answer\nto these questions might be of great interest as throwing\nlight upon the various problems presented by other alleged\nmediumistic phenomena.\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Price Is. net).\nAt this era, it is extremely pertinent that a little book on Psychical\nResearch, written by a man of high repute who is a veteran Re-\nsearcher and has had exceptional opportunity of acquiring first-hand\nacquaintance with the subject, should find a place in the \"Home\nUniversity Library of Modern Knowledge.\" In Professor Barrett's\nopinion the Society has reached a definite and critical point in its\nhistory, and it is well that some information as to its jjurpose should\nonce more be presented in a popular shape to a public which still\nhas but a confused notion of its aims and work.\nPerhaps for serious educative purposes the earlier chapters are the\nmost useful and admirable in the note they strike ; the average man\nor woman takes no observation, has piobably no suspicion of the\npowers which lie beneath the surface within the personality, and of\nwhich, in these chapters, examples and demonstrations are given ; the\nresult of this ignorance being that inexplicable occurrences are dismissed\nwith a shrug of the shoulders by the incredulous, and by the credulous\nare promptly relegated to the agency of spirits\u2014^just as do races of a\nlow degree of development, with whatever in the physical world they\ncannot understand. To have it proved that a part of these events, at\nleast, certainl}^ spring from unrecognised faculties within ourselves is,\neven wlien only simple things such as the jjenchde and planchette are in\ncpiestion, a step on the way towards a point of view at once more\nintelligent and more interested. At the same time, the philosophic\nattitude of mind, which in face of mystery sets about first and fore-\nmost to seek a cause within the realm of nature, is not likely to be\nacceptable to all. There are many who, separating habitually the\nsupernatural from the sphere of human activity, find in that division\nitself support to their religious faith. That the great need in average\nmen and women is an education in the nature of proof may be\nobvious ; but unfortunately there are many who do not desire that\nthings which appear obscure and miraculous should be brought into\nthe light of every day ; on the contrary, as the Jews of yore, they\ndemand a \"sign.\" That wonder may lurk close to them in the\nfield and on the roadside, in the street and hy the hearth, is not\nnative to their ideas ; the \" sign \" must be something outside the\ncourse of nature, and in their estimation would fail of its purpose if\nproved not to be supernatural and tamely brought into order under\n\fNov., 1911. Revieiv. 149\nlaw. For that word supernatural, Professor Barrett would substitute\nsupernormal, \u2014the term, originated by Mr. Myers, which is generally\nused in the publications of the Society ;\nindeed, a minor, yet most\nexcellent, work of the Society lies in the correction of loose and\nmisleading expressions, stereotyped into our tongue by an original\nignorant misuse of a good word.\nA chapter in the book specially interesting is that on Thought-\ntransference, particularly in reference to the Misses Creery. In this\nconnection, Professor Barrett remarks that \" freshness of interest . . .\nappears essential to success,\" and that \"the best results Avere obtained\n. . . when there was no weariness or anxiety for success.\" [The italics\nare added.] This is an important statement. May we not enlarge\nits meaning and extend its application ? More than once it has\noccurred to the present writer that any conscious attempt towards\nthe exercise of uncommon psychical power may be gradually de-\nstructive of it, and mislead the mind. To discover in oneself an\noccult gift tends almost inevitably towards efforts that perhaps over-\nstrain it. Perhaps this might lend an initial explanation of the frauds\nof mediums, of the apparently irreconcilable facts in the histories of\nsome of them. It is the experience of the present writer that in\nthese gifts is something elusive, furtive, delicate and shy\u2014something\nthat giving itself slips away again and will endure no constraint.\n\"Life loves no looker-on at her great game.\"\nAnd those who think to steal a march upon her, should beware.\nOught not all habitual experimenters, in spite of unimpeachable moral\ncharacter, to proceed warily, holding themselves a little in suspicion ?\nAn eagerness and \" anxiety for success \" grows with success ; and\npossibly this anxiety once admitted into the mind may vitiate the\nresult, without coming within measurable distance of \"collusion on\nthe part of those concerned.\"\nIf a small criticism on a delightful little book may be permitted,\nit would seem that, here and there, Professor Barrett forsakes his\nown vigilant standard and the unbiassed mind. As, for example,\nwhen he speaks of something, appearing in the script of an automatic\nwriter, of a type which was \" wholly alien to the character of my\nfriend.\" This is a warm-hearted tribute which we entirely respect\nand credit. But is it not set down a little too lightly 1 For after\nall, what is a \"character\"? Is it anything more than an uncertain\nshape thrown up into relief from an immense incalculable background\nunknown even to the possessor and in itself unfathomable by human\npowers? It is not only \"clouds of glory\" we trail with us when we\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., i9ii.\ncome. An element of sturdy .scepticism is not to be despised or\nresented. We human beings are too much the victims of unguessed\ninfluences, of unforeseen impulse and incredible negligences, to venture\nto be certain of ourselves\u2014or of others.\nE. F. B.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThk Enniscorthy Poltergeist.\n{To the Editor of the S.P.R. Journal.)\nEnniscorthy, October 23rd, 1911.\nIn the issue of your Journal for October a letter appears over the\nsignature of Major H. G. A. Moore, in which the writer endeavours\nto cast doulit on the Poltergeist theory put forward by Pro-\nfessor Barrett in accounting for the phenomena in Enniscorthy,\nattested to by Mr. Devereux and myself, in July, 1910. He says:\n\" Mr. Murphy knew pretty well what phenomena to expect.\" I\nconfess I did expect to witness some phenomenal occurrence, but I\nalso went to the house in Court Street convinced that I would\ndetect fraud or trickery of some kind, and that I might possibly be\nthe means of exposing it. My companion, Mr. Owen Devereux, was\neven more full of this idea than I was, he being up to that night a\nconfirmed unbeliever in the possibility of producing sounds or mani-\nfestations by any other than the ordinary human or scientific agencies.\nMajor Moore must have a poor opinion of my powers of observation\nif he believes that I could be imposed upon in the simple way he\ndescribes. He takes it for granted that I would sit in the room\nwithin three feet of Randall's bed and not detect the gyrations\nnecessary for removing the clothing by the method assumed by him.\nAgain the Major assumes that \" Randall lies down in bed disposing\nof the bedclothes as he likes.\" Now Randall did not \"dispose of\nthe bedclothes as he liked.\" My first act on entering that room\nthat night was to pull everything off the bed and scatter them\nabout the floor. We [Mr. Devereux and myself] even turned up\nthe mattress. We then \" dressed \" the bed in the ordinary way,\nlaying on sheet, blankets, pillow, etc., just as a housemaid would do.\nThe boys got into bed without ever disturbing the clothes from the\nway we disposed of them. Every one knows that there is no real\ndarkness at that time of year ;\nany twisting or convulsions of the\nbody or movements of the hands would have been too easily dis-\n\fNov., 1911. Correspondence. 151\ncernible. Another point : the silence (after the candle was extin-\nguished and conversation ceased) was intense. I defy any one, even\nMajor Moore himself, to lie in bed in a still room and even only\nmove his toes beneath the bedclothes without making sufficient noise\nto attract the attention of a watcher sitting three feet from his\nbed. Again the clothes did not actually \" go over the foot of the\nbed \" as described by Major Moore. They went off diagonally, as I\nexplained to Professor Barrett the day he visited Enniscorthy. The\nMajor says I attach too much importance to the fact that \" the\nclothes were actuallj' going under the bed, as if the wind was\nblowing them under it.\" The loose ends of the sheets or blankets\nwere never at any time within reach of RandalVs hands, even if he sat\nripright in bed, a thing he could not possibly do without attracting\nthe attention of my companion and myself. The clothes went off\nthe bed diagonally, that is over the left-hand bottom corner ; and\ninstead of going under the bed from the bottom, they went under\nfrom the side, going about two feet from the point perpendicular\nto the edge of the bed. From this it will be apparent that if\nRandall was the agent, he should reach over the right-hand side of\nthe bed and pass his hand along the bottom to within two feet of\nthe outer edge or half under the bed. [But] the right-hand side of\nPumdalVs bed was pushed uj) close against the ivall that divided Mr.\nRedmond's room from that of his lodgers. The \" pin \" theory is too\nridiculous to give it a moment's thought. Whilst I was \"searching for\nstrings or wires,\" my companion was watching every movement on\nthe part of Randall.\nAgain, on the second occasion, the Major says that when Mr.\nMurphy had the adjustment of the clothes on the bed, Randall could\nnot repeat the first performance. [He could do it] just as easily,\nbecause, as stated already, it was I who adjusted the clothes on\nboth occasions. Now the Major is driven to resort to another cause\nto account for the effect of Randall being removed from the bed.\nHe says any wriggling that might possibly have occurred to effect\nthis would be concealed by the partial darkness. I think I disposed\nof this argument in my challenge to Major Moore to lie in bed in\na still room and larely move his toes without making sufficient noise\nto attract a watcher.\nAs to Randall moving [the bedstead] with a cord or rope, I am\na fairly strong man of average physique, and I would not be able\nto move a bed with two boys in it in the way Major Moore suggests.\nRandall is a mere stripling\u2014how could he do it? One of the\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1911.\ncastors was missing, and the uncastored leg tore a little rut along\nthe boards in its movement round the room. I myself saw this\nmark on the boards of the floor of the bedroom.\n[In regard to] Randall's apparent nervousness, \u2014I may call it sheer\nterror, \u2014if [he] were carrying on [such] a scheme that night, it is\nmuch more likely that his condition would cause him to bungle\nthe whole thing rather than that he should successfully accomplish\nit. Nothing short of sheer fright could produce the profuse per-\nspiration and trembling, frightened condition in which I saw Randall\non that night.\nRandall and Sinnott were two simple youths just up from the\ncountry ; never previously (to use a favourite expression in this part\nof the country) \" away from their mothers' apron strings.\" This\nis especially true of Randall. He is a candid, straightforward youth\nwith a good countenance denoting intelligence. Is it probable that\n[he] could carry out a system of scheming and deceive two men\nin their sober senses who went there extremely suspicious of him?\nI may add that Mr. Devereux and myself are life-long total abstainers.\nNicholas J.

Vereall.\nIn criticisms of recent reports on automatic writing, it is some-\ntimes contended that too much ingenuity has been exercised\nin the discovery of supposed cross-correspondences, and that by\nan exercise of similar ingenuity similar connexions could be\nfound in any group of such rambling and disjointed writings\nas those with which these reports are concerned. In that case\nchance alone might be sufficient to account for the resemblances\nbetween the scripts. A careful and unprejudiced examination\nof the evidence could not fail, I think, to convince any reader\nthat this explanation will not cover the whole ground. Neverthe-\nless, it seemed to us worth while to try the experiment of\nproducing some pieces of writing in imitation of automatic script,\nwith a view to seeing what connexions, if any, could be dis-\ncovered between them.\nThe method of experiment made it practically certain that\nany connexions that occurred must have been purely accidental,\nand two questions arose in regard to them: (I) How many\ninstances could be found in which the same topic occurred in\ntwo or more scripts produced at approximately the same time ;\nand (2) whether these coincidences were such as to suggest the\nsame sort of deliberate purpose or design in the selection and\nfitting together of topics as has been claimed for the more\ncomplex of the cross-correspondences.\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, lOil.\nThe result of a single experiment could not in any case\nbe conclusive, but if several connexions suggestive of design\nhad been found under circumstances in which there was good\nreason for thinking that design had played no part, we should\nhave had to reconsider our interpretation of the complex cross-\ncorrespondences. Apart from this possibility, it seemed that in\nother ways also a comparison between scripts produced auto-\nmatically and non-automatically might be of interest.\nThe experiment was conducted on the following lines : I chose\nas subjects six people, none of whom had any reason to suppose\nthemselves endowed with automatic faculty. In our present\nignorance of the conditions under which telepathic and kindred\nmental phenomena occur, it is obvious that we cannot with\ncertainty exclude the influence of a supernormal agency, but in\nthis case the probability of such an influence has been so far\nreduced that it may reasonably be ignored. Three of the writers,\nA, B and C, were more or less familiar with tlie recent publica-\ntions of the Society, the other three, D, E and F, were not.\nAll remained ignorant of one another's identity, until the con-\nclusion of the experiment. To all I gave the following instruc-\ntions :\nClioose any literary work with wliich you are familiar. Open it at\nrandom. Choose from the pages at which the book opens any phrase\nor word which you think suggestive. Starting from this point write\ndown whatever thoughts occur to you. Let your mind range as widely\nas possible, so that a variety of topics may be introduced. Put down\nanything that comes into your mind, even if it has no apparent\nconnexion with your preceding thoughts. If what occurs to you is\nobviously suggested by some external circumstance, e.g. a sudden\nnoise, an explanatory note should be added.\nPlease repeat this experiment on six different occasions with six\ndifferent books.\nEach piece of writing should cover about half a sheet of foolscap\npaper, and should be fuUii dated (see specimen).\nIn the case of quotations, plea.se give references when known, and add\nnotes on such points\u2014-if any\u2014-as seem to you to require them, c.ij. if\nthere is some personal association between two apparently disconnected\nthoughts.\nPlease do not show your writing to any one or talk of the experi-\nments until they are concluded.\n\fDec, 1911.

I hud, in my own case, that, when\nI switch off my attention, so to speak, my mind \" wanders\n\"\nnaturally, and it will sometimes light in succession upon topics\nbetween which 1 can detect no association. The connecting\nlinks, supposing that they exist, must be purely sub-conscious.\nBut it seems that all minds do not work on these lines. The\nwriter whom I here call C evidently had great difficulty in\ngetting her mind away from the original starting-point. Her\nscripts almost all revolve closely about this leading idea ; to one\nof them she appends a note, \" unless I cudgelled my brains a\n'Tennyson, Maud. \"Tennyson, Maud.

Hill, who has lately tried a similar\nexperiment, says that two friends of his, although \" well-\nacquainted with the form of genuine script,\" could get no\nresults whatever :\n\" Somehow they seem to be watching their\nown minds too closely and the mind shuts itself up.\" Perhaps\nin these cases there is, as it were, a more complete barrier between\nthe conscious and subconscious mind, so that ideas cannot emerge\ninto consciousness except by an effort of tlie will, which, having\nonce seized upon an idea, clings to it.\nIf we compare these imitation scripts, as I shall call them,\nwith real, i.e. automatic, script, several differences may be\nobserved.\n(1) In the imitation scripts, the association between one idea\nand another is usually apparent, i.e. having been formed in one\nconscious mind it can be instantly perceived by another conscious\nmind. But in automatic script this is not the case. There is\nfrequently no apparent connexion between the various topics\nalluded to in a single piece of writing.\n(2) This predominance of the conscious mind explains also the\nfact that the imitation scripts are more clearly traceable to the\ncontemporary thoughts of the writers. Allusions are made to\nbooks which they have lately read, or to approaching public\nevents, e.g. the Coronation, the Parliament Bill, etc. It is\nnoticeable that automatic writing as a rule shows little or no\ntrace of what may be occupying the conscious mind of the\nautomatist at the moment, and allusions to public events are\nrare. These characteristics may be partly due to self-suggestion,\nas obviously such allusions would be of little use for evidential\npurposes.\n(3) In the imitation scripts, although the range of ideas is\nequally wide, there is much less variety of form. They have\nrather the effect of a summary or of rough notes.\nWith many of the variations of form which are to be found\nin real scripts we need not here concern ourselves, but some\nare important, because they involve variations in emphasis.\nParticular words or phrases may be emphasised\n(a) by repetition (see e.g. Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXII., p. 97,\nwhere the idea of laurel is repeated in various forms\neight times in Mrs. Verrall's script).\n\fDec, 1911.

Numerous illustrations of this\nmay be found, especially in Mrs. Piper's script.\nEmphasis of one kind or another, especially of the last\nkind, has therefore been an important factor in the evidence\nfor design in cross-correspondences. In her second report on\nMrs. Holland's script {Proc. S.P.P., Vol. XXIV., p. 203) Miss\nJohnson says :\n\" in most of the cases which I have here\ncounted as cross-correspondences, the passages in the scripts\nare marked out by some phrase which seems meant to call\nattention to them, such as '\nEemember the word and the\ndate '\n; or by some device such as the repetition of a word,\nor its being written in specially large letters. It is here as\nif the intelligence guiding the script\u2014whether it be the sub-\nliminal self of the automatist or some external intelligence\n\u2014\nis putting up a signal to apprise us of its intentions ; and\nthe signal greatly reduces the probability that the coincidence\nis only due to chance.\" In the imitation scripts, on the other\nhand, we find no emphasis except by repetition, and of that\nonly a few clear instances. Each word or topic has an almost\nequal claim to consideration, and the probability of chance-coin-\ncidences is thereby increased. This increase it is impossible\nto estimate exactly, a rough comparison being all that the\ncase admits, but evidently the larger the field of material,\nthe larger the scope for coincidence must be.\nCross-correspondences, again, vary immensely in their com-\nplexity, and I have found nothing in the imitation scripts\nwhich can be compared with the more complex, e.g. \" Light\nin West\" (Proc. S.P.B., Vol. XXIL, p. 24:1) or \"Sevens\" (Proc.\nS.P.P., Vol. XXIV, p. 222). Even in cross-correspondences\nof the simplest type there is always at least one other factor\nin addition to a coincidence of topic. This factor may be\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, l9il.\n(1) coincidence of date (see e.g. Froc. S.P.B., Vol. XXIV., p. 215,\n\"The Blue Flower\"), (2) coincidental allusions to a second\ntopic not connected with the first by any obvious association\nof ideas (see e.g. Froc. S.F.F., Vol. XXIV., p. 186, \"Exile and\nMoore \"), (3) the intervention of a third automatist (see e.g.\nFroc. S.F.B., Vol. XXIV., p. 207, \"Yellow\"), (4) the fact that\nother cross-correspondences have occurred in the same pieces\nof script, though not necessarily between the same automatists\n(see e.g. Froc S.P.B., Vol. XXII., p. 87, \"Giant and Dwarf\").\nIn so far as it was possible I have applied this two-factor\nstandard in the analysis of the imitation scripts. With this\nlimitation I have included every coincidence that seemed at all\nworth counting. If I also am accused of showing too much\ningenuity, I shall willingly plead guilty to the charge, for of\ncourse my object is to weight the evidence for chance in\nthe case of the cross-correspondences.\nAnalysis of Scripts.\nAs I have stated above, the whole number of scripts pro-\nduced was thirty-six. All those which I discuss are given in\nfull in the Appendix, including at least one specimen from each\nwriter, so that the varieties of style, etc., may there be judged.\nHere I only quote relevant extracts, but wlierever any omissions\nhave been made they are marked. The whole period covered\nby the experiment was about two months and a half, from the\nfirst script on April 5, 1911, to the last on June 21, 1911.\nAs might have been expected, I found in the scripts several\nallusions to the same matters of contemporary interest; e.g. four\nwriters refer to Women's Suffrage. Such coincidences are\nobviously produced by the same normal cause acting on several\ndifferent minds ;\ntherefore, since they are not to be attributed\neither to chance or to a supernormal agency, they do not\nconcern us here. I also found many rather vague coin-\ncidences of topic, such as we might expect between people\nsharing, to some extent, the same literary interests. If, in\naccordance with the scheme that I had adopted, some corro-\nborative factor were to be sought, the most obvious to look\nfor here was a coincidence of date. There are six coin-\ncidences of date, two pieces of script having been produced by\ndifferent writers on April 9, 1.3, 21, and 30, and May 4\n\fDec, 1911. Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 159\nand 9. Between the scripts of Ap. 9 I can trace no con-\nnexion, nor between those of Ap. 13. The scripts written\non the four remaining dates exhibit certain coincidences which\nI will now describe. For convenience of reference I have\nnumbered the scripts A 1 to 6, B 1 to 6, etc. The opening\nphrase of each script, i.e. the phrase selected by the writer\n(see above, p. 154), is printed in italics. For the purposes of\nthis paper these phrases may be regarded as an integral part of\nthe script. For, since there was no communication between\nthe writers during the experiment, the fact of selection does\nnot add in any way to the probability of coincidences.\nI.

The allusion to Virgil is further emphasised by\nreference to '\nbees round the lilies.' We have here a coin-\ncidence of date and a double coincidence of topic, '\nHell ' and\n'\nVirgilian hexameters.' The coincidence of the allusion to\nVirgil is weakened by the fact that A and B are both\nclassical scholars. On the other hand, the closing words of\nB's script, \" College days.

Possibly\nA's remark that \" it is entirely a question of polyschematism\n(multiplicity of form) and polypragmosyny (meddlesomeness) will\nnot be an efficient substitute \" is intended to indicate an\nintelligently-devised, complex cross-correspondence !

Death\nis not alluded to, unless we consider it implied in the two\nquotations from Adoncds, the secondary title of which is A71\nMegy on the Death of John Keats. Since dawn and sleep\nare ideas which might naturally occur in conjunction, the\ncoincidence would have been hardly worth mentioning, if no\nconfirmation of it could be found.

The\ncoincidence is perhaps slightly strengthened by the fact that\nC 2 is the first piece of script written by C after Ap. 30,\n1 Browning, Pauline.\n-Euripides, Medea; \"Stepping delicately through serenest air.\"\n''The quotation from Pauline in the earliest script contains implicitly the\nidea of dawn, explicitly alluded to in the next script ; the second quotation\nleads up to the idea of sleep.\n^Tennyson, In Memoriam, LXVII.-LXIX.

There is no further\nconnexion between these two scripts, but E4 (May 4) contains\nthe words \" A gipsy with fair hair. Gipsy dress,\" and C's next\nscript (C 3, May 10) opens with a quotation from Borrow's\nLavengro and turns entirely on the idea of gipsies. I should\nnot have thought this last coincidence worth mentioning at all\nif it had not been for the strong emphasis on \" gipsies \" in\nC's script. The word \" moonlight \" - only occurs in one other\nscript, D 2, where it occurs twice.\nD2. Ap. 13, 1911.\n. . . People driving home by moonlight. . . . What does moon-\nlight do to people ?\nThe question with which this script closes is appropriately\nanswered by the opening phrase of E 4 on May 4, \" Moonlight\ncold which maketh mad.\" The only other connexion that I can\nsee between D 2 (Ap. 13) and E 4 is that E 4 contains the\nphrase \" a road in Sussex,\" and D 2 was written in Sussex,\nas were all D's scripts. There is no other allusion to Sussex\nin any of the scripts.\n1 Browning, Paracelsus.\n\" The word '\nmoon ' occurs in two of B's scripts, which do not appear to be\notherwise connected with the scripts discussed iu this section.\n\fDec, 1911. Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 163\nSumming up then, we have in B 6 (Ap. 30) an allusion\nto \" Death and his brother Sleep,\" which forms part of a\ncorrespondence with E's script of the same date. On May\n4, C, in the next piece of script written by her after\nAp. 30, alludes to \" Sleep, Death's twin brother,\" and this\nscript is connected through the idea of \" moonlight \" with\nE's script of the same date. Or, putting it in another way, B 6\nand C 2, which are connected with one another by the allusion\nto \" Death and his brother sleep,\" are each connected with\na contemporary script by E. \" Moonlight \" which forms the\nconnecting link between C and E is also referred to in D 2,\nthe closing words of which are in the form of a question\nappropriately answered by the opening words of E 4.\nIV. \" OxE OF OUR Conquerors.\"\nE5.

The two quotations are\nnot from the same part of the book, and there is no connexion\nof thought between them. The only other link between these\ntwo scripts\u2014a slight one\u2014is that E's quotation turns on the\nnotion of satire upon England, the idea of satire being repeated\nin the allusion to Juvenal. E refers to L'Me des Pingouins,'^\nan example of satire, and in particular of satire upon France.\nE 5 opens and closes with a quotation from Meredith, the\nopening quotation being from Bcauchamp's Career. This novel\nis also mentioned in E's first script, part of which has been\nalready quoted (see p. 160). It ends with the words \"The\nlove scene in '\nLord Ormont and his Aminta.' Sailor Nevil\nBeauchamp. A midshipman.\" E 1 may therefore be regarded\n1 Meredith, Beauchamp's Career.\n\"Meredith, One of Our Conquerors, chap. xiv.\n^Meredith, One of Our Conquerors, chap. xix.\n^By Anatole France.\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, l9il.\nas connected by internal evidence with E 5. The only possible\nconnexion I can trace between E 1 and F 4 is that they both\nrefer implicitly to Henry VIII., E 1 in the words\n:\n. . .

Both writers make other allusions to the sea and ships.\nThere is perhaps a further connexion through the idea of suicide.\nIn F's script suicide is mentioned with some emphasis\n:\n. . . suicide. The man who meets me periodically in Holborn and\nasks the way to the river. '\nOne more unfortunate '\ni\netc. Is it\nright to rescue a suicide 1 . . .\nA's script contains two allusions which might easily be\nassociated with the idea of suicide.\n(a) \"The hemlock. Socrates.\"\nThe fact that the suicide was in this case compulsory weakens\nthe connexion of thought with F.\n(b) Troutbeck.\nMr. John Troutbeck is well known as the Coroner for West-\nminster. If F's acquaintance in Holborn had drowned himself\nin the river (clearly F credited him with this purpose) it would\nmost probably have fallen to Mr. Troutbeck's lot to hold the\ninquest over his remains.\nConclusion,\nThe above are the only coincidences which seem to me worth\nrecording. Other very slight connexions occur, but they do not\neven approximate to the standard of the simplest cross-corres-\npondences. The question now arises : is there anything in these\ncoincidences which could possibly be interpreted as indicating\nintelligence or design ?\nIn the Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Script {Proc. S.P.R.,\nYol. XXIV., pp. 258 ff.) Miss Johnson divides cross-correspond-\nences into two kinds : those of the target-type, where we find\nmore or less successful shots at the same idea in several scripts,\nand those in which the scripts \" present the appearance ... of a\nmosaic, . . . showing unmistakeable traces of a pattern, and that\n^ The poem describes a girl who has drowned herself.\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, I9ii.\npattern tilled in by several different hands, whose efforts overlap,\nbut each of whom contributes something different from that\ncontributed by any of the others.\" Miss Johnson goes on to\npoint out that \" we find a number of gradations between [these\ntwo types].\"\nAs I have already indicated, cross-correspondences of the most\ncomplex type, where we have \" strong evidence of the design or\nagency of some intelligence which was cognisant of the whole\nscheme, as finally revealed,\" and where it is \" difficult to attribute\nso complete a knowledge of [the scheme] to the subliminal con-\nsciousness [of any one of the automatists concerned],\" are not to\nbe found in the imitation scripts. In their case the connexions\nare mostly of the simplest \" target type.\" The best shots perhaps\nare the two allusions to One of Our Conquerors. It is a curious\ncoincidence that two writers should quote fi^om the same not\nvery widely-read novel on the same day, but it does not\nsuggest anything beyond chance, especially when we take into\naccount that both the writers in question\u2014as is shown by their\nscripts\u2014have Meredith often in their thoughts. There is more-\nover a lack of design shown in the absence of any connexion\nbetween the two quotations, and what we may call by analogy\nthe attempt to introduce a second connexion through the idea of\n'\nsatire ' must be considered a coup vicmepii. Again in the scripts\nwhich I have analysed in \u00a7\u00a7 I., II. and V., there are coincidences,\nsometimes fairly close coincidences, of topic, but there is no\nevidence of design, and the scripts are in no way complementary\nto one another ;\nthey do not contain utterances incomplete in\nthemselves, but forming, when united, an intelligible and coherent\nwhole.^\nThe incident most deserving the name of a cross-corre-\nspondence is the one described in \u00a7 III. p. 161, centring round\nthe idea of '\nmoonlight.' I do not claim for this '\ncross-corre-\nspondence '\nthat it is an ambitious effort, but it is successful\nso far as it goes. Assuming, for the moment, a supernormal\nagency, this agency may with some plausibility be found in\nthe subconscious mind of D, as a consideration of dates will\nshow. On Ap. 13 D's script closes with the question \"What\n1 Unless we admit the allusions to suicide (see above). There is no apparent\nsignificance in the name Troiitbeck in A's script, unless it is to be considered in\nconnexion with F's script.\n\fDec , 1911. Element of Chance in Cross-Correspondences. 167\ndoes moonlight do to people ?\n\" On May 4 C and E both\nbegin their scripts with allusions to moonlight. Design might\nbe argued from the following considerations: (1) the form of\nE's allusion to moonlight, which supplies the answer to D's\nquestion ; (2) the position of the question and answer, the one\nat the end, the other at the beginning of a script; (3) the\nfact that the allusion to moonlight in C's script (again in the\nopening words) is made through a quotation, which includes\nthe phrase \" Sleep, Death's twin brother,\" one of the elements\ncontributing to a coincidence between two scripts of B and E\non Ap, 30; (4) the fact that the word 'moonlight' does not\noccur in any other of the thirty-six scripts under consideration,\nand therefore we have no irrelevant allusions to discount.\nI assumed here, for the sake of argument, the intervention\nof a supernormal agency ;\nsetting aside this assumption, as we\nare bound to do according to the hypothesis upon which this\nwhole experiment is founded, the conclusion to be drawn from\nthis incident is that pure chance will occasionally give us a\nfairly good '\ncross-correspondence ' of a simple type. But after\nall necessary discount for this possibility has been made, the\nevidence for the intervention of some supernormal agency in\nthe production of automatic script remains but little affected.\nAppendix.\nA. 4.

With\na view to testing this interpretation, I shall be glad if any readers\nof the Journal (not only the six writers) will let me know if they\nfind in the scripts here printed phrases that seem to have a\nspecial appropriateness to themselves. It is clear that if the\nscripts fit the circumstances of several persons equally well,\nas is perhaps not unlikely to be the case in such various and\ndiscursive productions, this would increase the probability tliat\nthe appropriateness in any one case is accidental.\nCASE.\nP. 282. Dream.\nThe following case of a fulfilled prediction of death was\nsent to us by Mr. Severin Lauritzen, an Associate of the\nSociety. The fact that Mr. Lauritzen knew of his friend's\nwish to die, and often recalled the latter's remark that he\n\" would soon be free,\" detracts from the evidential force of\nthe premonition ; but we print the case as an instance of a\nremarkable coincidence, unusually well attested.\nMr. Lauritzen writes :\nHoLTK, Denmark, October list, 19 IL\nI had a friend, Mr. F. F., who once in conversation said to me :\n\" Well, it canuot be long uow before I shall be free,\" meaning,\n\"before I shall die.\" About a year later I dreamt that he said to\nme; ''Well, in four years I shall be free,\" giving no date in my\ndream. He died February 11th, 1911, 11.30 a.m., from heart and\nkidney trouble, 61 years old, very nearly four years and four days\nafter my dream.\nI enclose a leaf cut from a memorandum book in which I wrote\na note of my dream a few days after its occurrence. The first few\nwords I translate literally :\n\"Sunday, February 10th, 1907. \u2014About three days ago I dreamt\nthat F. F. full of joy told me that he should be free in four years.\" ^\n'Of this contemporary note, sent to us by ]\\lr. Lauritzen, we obtained au\nindependent translation, as follows: \"Sunday, Feb. 10, 1907. About three\ndays ago I dreamt that F. F. expressed his joy at the prospect of being fiee\nfrom this life in four years. There was nothing remarkable in this dream,\nbecause F. F. had last summer quite quietly let fall the words that he hoped\nsoon to be set free, or something like it. . . .\n\f174 Joxivnal of Society for Psychical Research. Uec, I9ii.\nThe rest of the note says only that the dream would not seem\nvery remarkable, because F. F. last year had remarked that he should\nsoon be free ; ihat another acquaintance from our college days, who\ndied many years ago, also appeared in the dream ; that this man\nlooked very strong and healthy, though when living he looked very\nfrail and delicate ; and that I never felt specially attached to him\nand very seldom thought of him.\nMy dreams are of the common vague and blurred kind, but the\nmore I thought of this dream the more I felt impressed by it, so\nin a few days it became quite clear to me that I ought to take it\ndown on paper. Having done this, I at once made one of my\ndaughters, Miss Helga Lauritzen, and my son-in-law, Mr. J. A. Kemp,\nread the note and sign it. At the foot of it you will find written\nBead 10\/;2 07. [Sigried] Helga Lauriten. J. A. Kemp.\nThe point that impressed me most was the vivid distinctness of\nthe information about \"the four j'ears.\" I remember that I was\nstartled\u2014even in the dream \u2014with this distinctness, because I had\noften recalled F. F.'s utterance the year before my dream, that he\nshould soon be free, and whenever it came into my head I found\nmyself adding \"I wonder when.\"\nMr. F. F., a lonely man of ample means, never married, and lived\nin a big villa at the sea shore some seventeen miles in a straight line\nfrom my residence. He was a deep thinker, keen and witty, and\nlived only for his philosophy. This was of a very original sort,\nvoid of all prejudices, following no old grooves, and he would\nprosecute his ideas \" to the bitter end \" in all its logical con-\nsecpiences. He often astonished me with the results of his pure\nthinking, because they coincided in many respects with my own,\nonly arrived at by studying facts from psychical research. This is\na vert\/ uncommon thing, I believe. Still he hated\u2014curiously\nenough\u2014what he called Spiritism, though he knew next to nothing\nof it and absolutely nothing of psychical research. He was rarely\nill and never called a physician himself. In his last illness, when\nhis friends forced one upon him, he treated him rather de haul en\nlas, to tell the truth. He astonished this physician by saying :\n\" I\nam most curious as to finding out soon what the next life is really\nlike.\" Once he said to me and other friends assembled :\n\" If you\ntold me I was to die in ten minutes, I should die in five for joy.\"\nOf course, I could not but think of Dr. Hodgson, who could \" hardly\nwait to die,\" hut he was a psychical researcher, F. was not. From\nthis you will understand that Mr. F. was no common man. I and\n\fDec, 1911. Case. 175\nmy family were the only people in all the world he felt really\nattached to.\nI only mention these circumstances because some will think,\nperhaps, that it is somewhat significant that just this man should\nfigure in, or impress me in, the only dream in mij life I ever deemed\nvmihij of being written down, and that this dream should turn out\nto be veridical.\nI add a fresh corroboration from Miss H. L. and Mr. J. A. Kemp.\nS. Lauritzen.\nHOLTE, October 2lst, 1911.\nWe corroborate the above. The signatures on the note-book leaf\nare ours. We never heard that Mr. Lauritzen ever wrote down\nany other dream.\nHelga Lauritzen.\nJ. A. Kemp.\nMr. Lauritzen sent us part of a Danish newspaper, the\n'\nNcitionaltidencle, of Feb. 15, 1911, which contains an announce-\nment of the death of Mr. F. F. on Feb. 11, 1911. In reply\nto a question, he wrote\n:\nOctober iSth, lOlL\nYou ask me whether Mr. F. knew anything about my dream.\nNo, nothing whatever. In more than one respect it would not\nhave been expedient or wise to tell him, so I took care not to do\nit. And nobody else could tell him, not even the two witnesses\nwho signed the note in my note-book, because when I had\nwritten the note I presented it to them in a casual way, simply\nasking them to read and sign it. They thought so little of it that\nthey forgot all about it until I again presented it to them when\nMr. F. got dangerously ill. Only then they remembered that they\nhad read and signed it themselves. And in his last illness Mr. F.\nadmitted none of his friends to his bedside ;\nonly the doctor and the\nwomen who nursed him were there. In fact I was somewhat re-\nbuked by all of my family that I never mentioned my dream ; if I\nhad, they said, they might possibly have been able to do more for\nhim during the last years of his life. But I don't think it would\nhave made any difference\u2014\" Wenn die Herren vom Rathhause\nkommen, sind sie am kliigsten!\" as the Gei-mans say.\nS.

BARRETT, F.Ii.S.\nDuring a visit to Sweden last September, Dr. Sydney Almtz\n\u2014\nwho is lecturer on p.sychology at the University of Upsala, an\nHon. Associate of the S.P.E., and Hon. Sec. of the Swedish\nInstitute for Psychological Eesearch\u2014kindly invited me to spend\na day or two with him in order to witness some experiments\non a good hypnotic subject who had been under his treatment.\nAccordingly I went to Upsala, and heard from Dr. Alrutz\nthat nearly twelve months before he had cured, by means of\nhypnosis, a labouring man, who had for some time previously\nbeen incapacitated from work by a complication of hysteria and\nneurasthenia with other disorders. The man was so grateful\nfor the wonderful and complete cure of the distressing nervous\nsymptoms which had been wrought and for his restoration to health\n\fJan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 179\nand work, that he placed himself at the disposal of Dr. Alrutz\nfor experimental investigation, and for several naonths Dr.\nAlrutz had hypnotised the man regularly.\nIn the course of these experiments Dr. Alrutz was led to\nreconsider the theory of the older mesmerists that the analgesia,\nor entire freedom from pain, which could be locally induced in the\nsubject, was not necessarily due to suggestion but to some specific\nemanation from the fingers of the mesmeriser. Furthermore,\nDr. Alrutz believed that he had discovered that certain materials\nwere more or less opaque and intercepted this emanation, whilst\nothers were transparent and permitted it to pass freely. Metal\nand glass sheets he found transparent, whilst paper, cardboard,\ncotton wool, etc., were more or less opaque.\nIn the afternoon of September 13th Dr. Alrutz took me to\nhis well-equipped laboratory in the University, where he had\narranged for his subject to attend. The subject, a heavily-built\nand intelligent labouring man of middle age, was placed in a\nreclining chair, and Dr. Alrutz gazed into his eyes, pointing\nhis fingers to them, and made a few passes down the body.\nIn two minutes the subject was sound asleep, but in what is\ncalled the nloi stage of hypnosis. He could hear my voice, and\nanswered questions Dr. Alrutz put to him ; but he did not\nunderstand a word of English, in which language Dr. Alrutz\nand I conversed.\nBefore being hypnotised the man had removed his coat and\nturned up the shirt sleeves over each arm, and when hypnotised\nDr. Alrutz asked me to test each of his arms to see if they\nwere sensitive to heat and cold, pricking, etc. This I did\n;\nboth arms appeared to be normal, and responded to these tests,\nas shown by the man rubbing the spots that had been pricked\nor touched with a hot body. A thick, large, black velvet\ncloth, through which 1 found nothing could be seen, was then\nthrown over the man's head, face and shoulders, and tucked\nin so that nothing, could be seen by the subject, even if his\neyes had not been closed as they were during the hypnotic\nstate. Without speaking, Dr. Alrutz then fixed, by means of\na strong stand and clip, a curved sheet of zinc over the subject's\nright arm ;\nand, with another stand and clip, a curved sheet of\ncardboard was fixed over the subject's left arm. Passes were\nthen silently made by Dr. Alrutz for a minute and a half from\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.\nthe shoulder to the fingers of the subject's right arm, over the\nzinc shield. I was then asked to test the arm again ; it was\nnow completely analgesic, not the slightest sensation appeared\nto be experienced by the subject from pricking, tickling, or the\napplication of heat to his bared right arm. The left arm, which\nhad not been stroked, was also tested, and seemed somewhat\nmore sensitive than normally. Dr. Alrutz told me he usually\nfound that as one member of the body became analgesic, the\nother corresponding member appeared to rise in sensitiveness.\nEeverse passes from fingers to shoulder were then made by\nDr. Alrutz over the subject's right arm. A curious thing was\nnow witnessed. The subject began rubbing his arm, and said\nhe now felt various pricks and other sensations, apparently\nfrom the tests made some little time before, which he had not\nfelt at the time. Dr. Alrutz has found the emergence of these\nsensations follows a definite order: not according to the sequence\nin which the tests wei'e made. The pain sense emerges first,\nthen follows the cold sense, and lastly the warmth sense emerges;\nand this order is followed quite independently of the order in\nwhich the tests were previously made.\nIn order to test the degree of sensitiveness of the subject\nto the pain sense, Dr. Alrutz has invented an ingenious instru-\nment which he terms the \" Algesimeter,\" or measurer of pain.\nHe has sent me one of the instruments to exhibit to-day, and\nit may be useful for our medical section. It consists of a\nneedle point protruding from what looks like a small silver\npencil case. The point is pressed forward by a light spring,\nthe pressure of which can be accurately adjusted by means of\na screw. This pressure can be made to vary from 2 grammes\n(about 30 grains), which produced no sensation of a prick on\nmy own arm, to a pressure of 6 grammes or more (about 100\ngrains), which caused a painful jDrick.\nThe left arm encircled by the cardboard shield was now\nstroked for one and a half minute by Dr. Alrutz, the passes\nbeing made as before in silence, from the shoulder to the fingers,\nand about two inches above the encircling screen. Testing\nthis arm after the passes had been made, I found it retained\nits normal sensitiveness to the various tests applied.\nAccording to Dr. Alrutz, this showed that the metal screen\nwas transparent to some force that passed from his fingers to\n\fJan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 181\nthe subject, and produced analgesia, whilst the cardboard screen\nwas opaque, as no such effect was produced by similar passes\ndown the left arm. Unknown to the subject, I quietly changed\nthe position of the two screens, and asked Dr. Alrutz to repeat\nthe experiment. On testing each arm again I found the results\ncorresponded to the changed position : the left arm was now\nanalgesic, and the right arm having the cardboard over it was\nsensitive.\nBy reverse passes, and blowing on the arms, Dr. Alrutz\nreduced both to a similar condition, and a glass screen was\nsubstituted for the metal. This also appeared to transmit the\nforce, for the arm beneath was rendered analgesic. Dr. Alrutz\nthen asked me to make the passes down the subject's arm, and\nnote the results obtained ;\nthey corresponded to those previously\ndescribed.\nThe subject was then awakened, and as he had to return\nto his work, we postponed further experiments till the evening,\nwhen he came to Dr. Alrutz's house about 9 p.m. He was\nfirst allowed to have a long hypnotic sleep on the sofa, and after\nsome three-quarters of an hour was awakened greatly refreshed.\nHe was then placed on an arm-chair and rehypnotised by\nDr. Alrutz, an opaque, large black velvet cloth being again\nthiown over his head and shoulders. To avoid any possible\ninformation being conveyed by air currents or warmth, a thick\npiece of plate glass was now fixed over his extended right\nhand, and above the glass Dr. A. stroked his middle finger silently,\nthe subject being quite unaware of what he was doing. Testing\neach finger by Dr. Alrutz's needle (algesimeter), I found every\nfinger sensitive, except the middle finger which had been stroked.\nThis was absolutely analgesic to the most severe tests. Upward\npasses were then silently made over the finger, sensitiveness\nwas at once restored, and the subject began rubbing his finger.\nIt was very curious to observe the apparent emergence of\nsensations caused by pricks made perhaps two or three minutes\npreviously. Again we tried the metal and cardboard screens,\nwith precisely similar results as in the earlier experiments.\nDr. Alrutz considered that this established the transparency\nof certain substances and the opacity of others to the mesmeric\ninfluence, and as a proof stuck a strip of card nearly four\ninches wide on to the middle and upper surface of the metal\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.\nscreen.^ On stroking the arm over which the metal screen\nwith cardboard strip had been fixed, Dr. Alrutz showed me\nhow completely the strip of card had shielded that part of the\narm, which under the card remained sensitive, whilst the rest\ncovered by the metal alone was insensitive. The subject of\ncourse could not see what was being done, and was unaware\nof the nature of the experiment.\nI was, however, extremely doubtful of Dr. Alrutz's theory,\nand believed the results he had shown me were really due to\nsome suggestion unconsciously conveyed to the subject. Accord-\ningly I asked Mrs. Alrutz, who had been present at our last\nexperiments, to take the metal screen outside the room and\nfix the cardboard strip in some fresh position, on the under\nside of the metal screen, so that neither Dr. Alrutz nor\nI should know where it was. This was done, and the screen\nfetched by me from outside, Mrs. Alrutz meanwhile having\nretired to her own room at another part of the house. The\nscreen was again fixed over the arm of the subject and stroked\nas before. It was then removed laterally so as to expose the\narm, which was then tested as before with the needle. No\ndifference in sensitiveness was found in any part of the arm ;\nthe screen was now turned up and the position -of the card\nnoted ; the part of the arm below where it had been fixed was\nin exactly the same insensitive state as the rest of the arm.\nThe result even of this single experiment apparently negatives\nthe hypothesis of the variable transparency of different screens,\nwhen their position is unknown to both hypnotist and subject.\nSome other explanation must, I think, be found, and we may\nassume as the most probable explanation that when the nature\nof the screen is known to the operator, a telepathic impression,\nor some faint sensible impression, of the expected result is\nunconsciously conveyed to the subject, and self-suggestion\nresults. Dr. Alrutz, however, has been so long and assiduously\nengaged in these experiments that it is somewhat presumptuous\non my part to differ from the conclusions he may have\narrived at, in consequence of a single experiment. Hence I\nawait the pubhcation of his results with interest.^\n^\nDr. Alrutz informs me it was not a piece of card, but a collection of\nsome twenty strips of filtering paper.\n-Dr. Alrutz, to whom I submitted a copy of this paper, adds a note iiere\nstating that possibly the result obtained in my experiment may be due to the\n\fJan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 183\nThe foregoing experiments on the production of local\nanalgesia by passes, avoiding as far as possible all self-\nsuggestion on the part of the subject, and excluding any\nconscious suggestion from the operator, are a confirmation of\nthe numerous experiments recorded in the Eeports of the\nCommittee on Mesmerism which were published in the early\nyears of our Society. Of that Committee I was an active\nmember, and took part with Mr. Gnrney in nearly all the\nexperiments. We were strongly convinced that conscious or\nunconscious suggestion could not explain the results, and that\na prima facie case on behalf of the older mesmeric theory of\na specific influence appeared to be established.\nSubsequently Mr. Gurney continued the investigation, and\n\"by his masterly treatment raised the difficult problems of\nhypnotism to a higher scientific standing than ever before\nattained. I wish to draw special attention to Mr. Gurney's\npaper on \" Hypnotism and Telepathy \" published in the fifth\nvolume of our Proceedings. He there discusses the evidence\non behalf of a specific mesmeric influence, especially in thera-\npeutical cases, citing the conversion of Dr. Liebeault of [N^ancy\nto a belief in such an influence, mainly from the therapeutic\nresults obtained upon hypnotising forty-six children under four\nyears of age, the majority under three years. Dr. Liebeault\nconsiders various hypotheses, and concludes that \" the organic\nchanges produced must have been due to a transmitted nervous\ninfluence.\" It is true he largely modified or even abandoned\nthis conclusion, in later years.^\nProfessor and Mrs. Sidgwick took part in similar experiments\na few years later, the subject being in the normal state, and\nspreading of the effect in the cerebral centres (see his article \" Halbspontane\nErscheinungen in der Hypuose,\" Zeitschri\/t filr Psychologie, 1909), or more\nprobably to the subject falling into a deeper hypnotic sleep, when complete\nanalgesia spontaneously occurs. Certainly it was difficult, as Dr. Alrutz points\nout, to keep the subject in the light hypnotic sleep. Or the result, he\nsuggests, may have been due to telepathic action from my mind counteracting\nthe assumed physical effect.\n1 Miss .Johnson has pointed out to me that Mr. Gurney knew only of Dr.\nLiebeault's earlier experiments, published in 1883. In consequence of later test\nexperiments Dr. Liebeault, I understand, gave up the effluence theory and con-\ncluded that the results were due to suggestion alone, and published his\nconclusion in his Th&rapeutique Suggestive in 1891. Mr. Myers in his Human\nPersonality, Vol. I., p. 444, refers to this; but on p. 484 Mr. ilyers, returning to\nthe problem of the influence of mesmeric passes, remarks on two different lines\nof observation \"which point to the probability of their possessing some specific\npotency . . . some specific sensibility to human proximity per se.''\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.\nin the eighth volume of our Proceedings in 1890 Mrs. Sidgwick\nand Miss Johnson published an important paper, the latter\npart of which records and discusses numerous experiments\nsomewhat similar to those by Dr. Alrutz. In this lengthy\nand valuable investigation by Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Johnson,\n107 experiments were made on the production of local analgesia\nin a subject in the normal state, the operator being Mr. Smith.\nAs in the earlier experiments made by Mr. Gurney and myself,\nthe subject sat behind an opaque screen, with his hands spread\nout on a table, and could not see either his own hands or\nthose of the operator. In twenty-five cases Mr. Smith merely\npointed to the selected finger ; in nineteen of these the linger\nwas rendered absolutely insensitive to pain. In twenty-one\nfurther experiments a glass screen was placed over the subject's\nhand to prevent any possible sensory detection of the finger\nMr. Smith pointed to, and of these eighteen were completely\nsuccessful ; the mere pointing of the operator to a particular\nfinger rendering it quite anaesthetic. Furthermore in 57 other\ntrials, Mr. Smith did not even point to the finger but only\nlooked at it from a greater or less distance, and of these\ncases 22 were successful.\nAfter discussing various explanations Mrs. Sidgwick and\nMiss Johnson state that \" they believe the true explanation of\nthe results is thought transference, or mental suggestion received\nin some unconscious or subliminal manner by the subject's\nmind and acting on his organism in the same way that an\nordinary verbal suggestion may act.\" Certainly this appears\nto be the explanation of hypnosis induced at a distance, and\nit may be the true explanation of local analgesia. On the other\nhand, I do not know of any experiments where mere verbal sug-\ngestion by the operator to a subject in the normal state causes\nthe finger, or other part suggested, to become absolutely insensi-\ntive to pain.^ It is most desirable that experiments should\nbe made to settle this question, and I hope Dr. Alrutz, who\nhas at his command a suitable subject, will carefully examine\nMrs. Sidgwick's and Miss Johnson's conclusion. Mr. Gurney,\nwe know, was opposed to it, though his untimely death occurred\nlit is true Dr. Wingfield has shown (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 281) that his\nsubjects produced not only muscular rigidity, but sometimes local anaesthesia,\nin their arms, by the subject himself gazing at, or stroking, or even intently\nthinking of, his own arm.\n\fJan., 1912. Some Recent Hyjmotic Experiments. 185\nbefore the important experiments were made upon which Mrs.\nSidgwick's conclusion was based.\nMr. Myers, in his admirable review of the facts of\nhypnotism in the fifth chapter of his Human Personality,\nthinks that Mrs. Sidgwick's experiments \" removed Gurney'\u00bb\nmain objection to the telepathic explanation \"; ^ but he adds\nlater on on the same page :\n\" It is by no means improbable\nthat effluences,\u2014as yet unknown to science, but perceptible by\nsensitive persons as the telepathic impulse is perceptible,\u2014\nshould radiate from living human organisms \" ; hence he con-\ncludes :\n\" I see no reason to assume that the varied and con-\ncordant statements made by patients in the Zoist and early\nmesmeric works merely reflect subjective fancies.\"\nFurther, there appears to me indubitable evidence of some\nsupernormal means of detection by a sensitive of any inanimate\nobject over which passes have been made, or which has been\npointed at by the mesmeriser. Time will not allow me to\nnarrate the experiments which I and others have made on thi&\npoint, and which Gurney corroborated long ago at Deans Yard.\nThey are referred to in Vol. I. of our Proceedings, pp. 260-\n262, and also are recited by Mr. Gurney in his paper in\nVol. V.\nAt Upsala last September I asked Dr. Alrutz to let me\nrepeat some of his experiments when he was not in the room..\nThis I did, and the results obtained were the same. Then he\nbegged me to try an experiment the effect of which I did not\nknow, and see if my result accorded with that he himself had\npreviously obtained. The experiment was as follows: On\nrestoring the arm of the subject to its normal sensibility by\nreverse passes, to continue those reverse passes for a minute\nor two after sensibility had returned, and note the result.\nDr. Alrutz having left the room I hypnotised the patient by a.\nfew passes, his eyes closed, and his vision appeared insensitive.\nThe black velvet cloth was thrown over his head and shoulders\nand carefully adjusted so that all normal vision was impossible.\nThe arm was rendered insensitive to pain by downward passes^\nand restored to sensitiveness by a few upward passes, all made\nin absolute silence and without any contact with the patient,\nthe metal screen being over the bared arm. Then the reverse\n1 Human Personality, Vol. I. , p. 208.\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.\npasses were continued for another minute or more. I expected\nto find it unchanged, and was much surprised to discover it\nwas now in an extremely hyperaesthetic state. Tested with\nthe lowest pressure of Dr. Alrutz's needle, pain was evidently felt\n;\nthe touch of any light object, even a feather, produced discomfort\nand irritation in the subject. I recalled Dr. Alrutz, and he\ntold me I ought to have obtained exactly the results observed,\nas again and again he had found similar hyperaesthesia, induced\nby a continuance of the reverse passes.\nHere neither myself nor the subject knew what the result\nwould be, for the subject was unaware of what I was going to\ndo. Dr. Alrutz having spoken to me in English, and I took\nspecial care not to communicate any information through the\nsenses to the subject during the experiment. We may, of\ncourse, assume that extreme hyperaesthesia in the subject\nenabled him to detect when my fingers were moving up or\ndown his arm ; but this seems as improbable as the theory of\na specific effiuence.\n\u2022\nIf there be such an ettluence it would appear to have a\npolarity like magnetism. Stroking a knitting needle with the\none end of a bar magnet induces magnetic polarity in the\nknitting needle, a couple of reverse strokes demagnetises it, but\ncontinuing the reverse strokes it is remagnetised with the\nopposite polarity. Ts the common knowledge of this fact, in\nthe subliminal depths of the hypnotist, the cause of the some-\nwhat similar effects produced in an ignorant subject ? We need\nmore experiments made, with wider knowledge, scrupulous care,\nand above all, with an open mind, one freed from the tyranny\nof false or inadequate hypotheses.\nHow injurious to the progress of knowledge, and yet how\npersistent, hasty generalisations and inadequate hypotheses have\nbeen, is seen in the pages of history. Throughout the fifteenth\nand sixteenth centuries the doctrine of symimtliy, the alleged\nattraction between certain animate and inanimate bodies, para-\nlysed scientific progress. Every inexplicable occurrence was\nput down to this doctrine. Then in the seventeenth and part\nof the eighteenth century Descartes' theory of vortices became\nthe learned rationalistic philosophy. Then came the turn of\nelectricity, always still the refuge of the ignorant. Then we\nhad the doctrine of a purely material evolution, and now\n\fJan., 1912. Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments. 187\nvitalism is again besiinnino; to be heard. Has not the doctrine\nof suggestion in hypnotism\u2014true as it undoubtedly is \u2014been\npushed too far ? Have not the therapeutic results of the\nmodern hypnotists using this doctrine lamentably fallen short\nof those obtained by the older mesmerists ? How far is this\ndue to an inadequate view of the facts ? And in our own\nranks are we not in danger of pushing too far the doctrine\nof telepathy and of the subliminal self, pervasive and true as\nthey both are ? Let us remember the warning long ago uttered\nby Francis Bacon against the danger of worshipping the \" idol\nof the tribe,\" i.e. \" the tendency to support a preconceived opinion\nby neglecting all that is opposed to it.\" The secrets of Nature,\nas Bacon tells us, can only be discovered by receptivity and\nobedience, keeping the eye steadily fixed on the facts of Nature,\nand receiving the images of those facts simply as they arc\nwithout distortion through preconceived ideas.\nP.S.\u2014In returning the MS. of this paper, which I had sent\nto Dr. Alrutz, he wishes me to add that his experiments have\nextended over a somewhat wider range than those hitherto\nrecorded in our Proceedings. He informs me he has carefully\nexamined the motor phenomena produced by passes, the power\nof cold to restore sensitiveness, the order in which the different\neffects return, the effect of telepathy without passes or pointing,\nend of passes without any knowledge of what would occur, the\naffect of rcqjport between the subject and the operator, and\nthe varied problems which belong to the analgesic condition of\nthe subject. These, and other experiments which time prevented\nDr. Alrutz demonstrating to me, must of course be taken into\nconsideration before arriving at a conclusion. Meanwhile, in a\nletter just received from Dr. Alrutz, he says that for the\npresent he does not wish to commit himself to any theory,\nor even any definite explanation of the facts, but desires to\nkeep an open mind. Nevertheless, he adds that, as different\npersons, without knowing what to expect, get the same results\nwith the same kind of passes,\u2014even when he is not in the\nroom, and is unaware of the experiments that are being made,\n\u2014\nhe fails to see how unconscious telepathic suggestion can\naccount for these cases. He admits that it is a vera causa,\nbut not the only cause.\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1 912.\nWriting to me in a letter dated Dec. 1, 1911, Dr. Alrutz\nsays :\nI showed the hypnotic experiments you witnessed to the Society\nof Physicians of Upsala last week. The sight of the crowded hall,\nmany members of the faculty of medicine being present, made the\nsubject nervous ;\nhowever, he went to sleep all right, though he\nwas disagreeable the whole hour my demonstration lasted. Never-\ntheless, most of the experiments were more or less distinctly\nsuccessful. At last I put him into the deep sleep, to show that\nanalgesia and anaesthesia then occur spontaneously. Then I threw\nthe black cloth over his head, and wrote \"Wake up\" on a piece of\npaper, and silently willed him to wake up and get up, \u2014a rash thing\nto try in the presence of these seventy to eighty strange nervous\nsystems! I had to wait about one and a half minutes, when he threw\noff the black cloth, got up wide awake, and left the room. I had\nmade this experiment several times before, even from an adjoining\nroom. \u2014Yours sincerely,\nSydney Alrutz.\nCASE. \u2022 \u2022\nL. 1186. Impression.\nThe following account of an v\/iifvJfilled premonition was sent\nto us by Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of Gonville and Cains College,\nCambridge. In estimating what evidence exists for any real\nforeseeing of the future (apart from normal inference from\nknowledge of the present), it is, of course, necessary to take\ninto account premonitions that are not fulfilled. These are\nobviously much more likely to be forgotten than those which\nappear to be fulfilled. But the interest of the present case\nlies in the fact that Mr. Hutchinson's foreboding was shared\nby his little son, who apparently had no normal means of\nknowing anything about it. We therefore classify the case\nprovisionally as one of telepathy between the father and child.\nMr. Stratton writes in sending it : .\nNovember 20th, 1911.\nProf, and Mrs. Newall, from whom I heard the story, both\nassured me that the written account (dated Nov. 10) agreed en-\ntirely with the story told them when Dr. Hutchinson was visiting\nthem on Oct. 14.\n\fJan., 1912. Case. 189\nMr. Hutchinson's account is as follows :\nSt. Anne's, Lowestoft,\nNov. Wth, 1911.\nDear Mrs. Newall,\nI forward you the few notes you wish for, but I trust you\nwill forgive me for having been so long in sending them. I plead\nthe usual excuse of overwork.\nOn the kind invitation of Professor Newall to see the Observatory\nat Cambridge, I decided to motor over from Lowestoft on Saturday,\n14th October.\nOn Friday\u2014the day previous to the trip\u2014I had an unaccountable\nrestless feeling that some disaster would take place on the journey.\nSo strong did this feeling become that I decided to insure myself\nand car against all risk before undertaking the trip. I had some\ndiflBculty in effecting this insurance, as the time was short ;\nhowever,\nthe agents were able to put the matter through for me, and I had\nmy policy complete by 8.30 p.m. the same evening.\nAs I only had a very short time to spend in Cambridge, I decided\nto start from my house at 5 o'clock in the morning.\nI awoke at 4.15 a.m., and immediately started to dress, but before\ncompleting my toilet I heard my son (a little fellow of six years\nold) crying for me in a most piteous manner.\nI went upstairs to see him\u2014as he sleeps in a room by himself\nat the top of the house\u2014and he immediately threw his arms round\nmy neck, hugging me tightly and begging me not to undertake\nthe journey. I told him not to be foohsh, as I shuuld be back with\nhim the next day. I was unable to comfort him, so I brought him\ndown to his mother, and I understand from her that soon after\nmy departure he went off to sleep.\nI might state here that it was a most unusual thing for the boy\nto wake up at that hour of the morning, nor had he been told\nanything very much about my intended trip.\nAs regards my journey to Cambridge and back, it was entirely\nuneventful, and I am unable to account in any way for the curious\nand persistent feeling I had that a calamity of some kind would\ntake place during my absence from home.\nI might point out that I have driven a motor-car for over ten\nyears and have never taken out an insurance policy before, and\nwould not have done so now except for the above related facts.\nDuring the past ten years I have driven all over England and\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.\nScotland and have never met with an accident, nor had the same\npeculiar apprehension before undertaking a journey.\nYours very sincerely,\nDonald Hutchinson.\nIn reply to Mr. Stratton's enquiries Mr. Hutchinson wrote\nto him :\nNov. mh, 1911.\n. . . With regard to your query re my son, I can say unhesitatingly\nthat he knew nothing whatever regarding my forebodings, as I\nhad been particularly careful not even to mention them to my\nwife. ...\nDonald Hutchinson.\nTHE BUPtTON CASE.\nBy Professor J. H. Hyslop.\nMiss Verrall's summary of this case ^ presents a few inquiries\nto which an answer is perhaps due. The first is whether the\nstruggle between her two hands is sufficient evidence of the\nmotor dissociation alleged in the case. I would say that this\nwas not the only evidence and not the most important evidence\ngiven to sustain that claim. Far more important were the two\nor three instances in which her hands were used without any\nknowledge that they were so used. Twice she put her own hand\nagainst her face and thouglit it was some one else touching\nher face, the face beino' sensitive and the hands anaesthetic.\nOn another occasion she observed the lights which had been\nmade by her own hand without conscious knowledge of the\nsame. The struggle between the hands was only a constant\nphenomenon illustialing the case and not the only evidence of\nit. Besides, the phenomenon is quite commonplace in psycho-\npathology. Dr. Boris Sidis describes it quite fully in the Hanna\nCase. I have often remarked it in automatic writing when\nnormal consciousness existed. I have seen it here in more than\none form. First, I have seen it when the subject did not know\n^ See Journal, November, 1911, p. 140.\n\fJan., 1912. The Burton Case. 191\nwhat the hand was writing, but knew that it was writing.\nSecondly, I have seen it when the subject knew consciously\nwhat the hand was writing, though not knowing that it was\nwriting. That is, there was no sensation of the writing, and no\nrevelation of the contents by sensation at the time. Thirdly, I\nhave seen cases of it where the subject knew the contents\nbefore the writing was done, and yet wrote them out auto-\nmatically. The phenomenon is thus a very frequent one, and\nthe only interest of the case of Miss Burton is that it was\nconnected with physical phenomena of the orthodox type.\nThe query regarding the examination of the mouth in the\ndark for phosphorus as well as in the light does not take account\nof the fact that we had shown that she could not have produced\nthe lights if she had had any amount of phosphorus. We did\nnot examine her mouth so much for phosphorus as for other\napparatus. We should have been willing, but for the conjurer's\nill-directed objections, to have given her all the matches desired\nand yet she could not have produced the lights with them, or\nwith phosphorous oil. Besides, what would have enabled her to\nproduce the lights four feet distant when both hands were held ?\nOr the large light behind her when the hands were held ?\nThe lights of the fire-tly and glow-worm are exactly like those\nproduced by Miss Burton, or perhaps better, hers were like\nthose, and science, I believe, conjectures that they are due to\nsome form of oxydization of phosphorus. But they have no\nresemblance to the lights produced by matches or phosphorous\noil.\nThe analogy of the person struggling in temptation, or the\nphenomena of conversion, does not apply to the case of motor\ndissociation unless you assume that one of the terms in the\ncompeting impulses is subconscious. What we usually assume,\nrightly or wrongly has not been determined, is that in conversion\nboth impulses to do and to resist a thing are conscious. This\nwas not the case with Miss Burton, and is not the case\nwhere the struggle is between subconscious and conscious\nimpulses. We take for granted here that we understand the\nstruggle in conversion and similar phenomena, when the fact\nis that a whole group of such phenomena has not been studied\nat all from the point of view of abnormal psychology. Much\ntalk about subconscious processes has been indulged in, but little\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1912.\nor nothing done to make them intelligible. We can just as\nwell turn them round and ask whether they are not due to\nthe same influences as the automatism associated with the\nsupernormal, though not affording the crucial evidence of this,\nand though they might afford this if rightly studied. The\ncomparison may be just, but the explanation implied by it\nmay not be so apparent.\nMiss Verrall's summary makes no mention of the incidents\nof mental phenomena that were quite as striking as the raps\nand lights. They were particularly the name of Professor\nNewbold, those of Imperator and Hector, not known by Miss\nBurton, and the interesting cross-reference with Whirlwind, to\nsay nothing of a few others less striking. Then there was the\nchecking of these claims by the admissions and supernormal\ninformation regarding the case as obtained through Mrs.\nChenoweth. These are very important features of the case,\nwithout taking any account of the subconscious mental states\nthat illustrate so well the conditions affecting the transmission\nof anything supernormal at all.\nThe query regarding the tests for anaesthesia I would answer\nby saying that our reason for not describing them in detail\nwas simply that no test will ever satisfy the layman in this\nmatter. Anaesthesia is a very simple matter for the psycho-\npathologist to determine, and the conjurer would not accept\nthat authority. We applied severe tests many times, but we\nourselves did not attach any value to them, as we know that\nfaked anaesthesia is the suspicion of all who do not know how\neasy it is to determine it. Our tests were not simple ones.\nThey rested primarily upon a complicated system of reactions\nextending over long periods, and these are manyfold better\nthan any such tests as were applied to Mrs. Piper, and that\nastonish the layman. Our tests were of a kind that it is best\nnot to reveal, as it would only help to prepare other cases\nfor protection against them.\n\fNo. CCLXXXVI.\u2014Vol. XV. .\n\u2022 \u2022 FEBRrARY, 1912.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nCONTENTS.\nPAGE\nReport on Sittings witli diaries Bailey, the Australian Apport Medium.

Baggally.\nEOR some years past accounts have appeared in the Spiritualistic\nPress of alleged wonderful apports brought about through the\nmediumship of Mr. Charles Bailey in Australia. In these\naccounts it is stated that tablets and cylinders covered with\ncuneiform characters have been instantly transported from\nmounds on the site of ancient Babylon into the room where\nBailey was, also ancient coins from Egypt, live animals from\nIndia, Africa and other parts of the world.^ These accounts\nhave drawn the attention of some European savants interested in\nthe investigation of so-called spiritualistic physical phenomena, and\nat their invitation Bailey has given seances in Milan and Eome.\nOnly last year he gave a series of seances under the auspices\nof Professor Willy Eeichel at Grenoble, France. Amongst the\nmembers of the committee on this occasion were Mons. Guillaume\nde Fontenoy, Colonel de Eochas, several doctors and engineers.\nThis committee issued a report, in which it is stated that Bailey\nresorted to fraud.\" Immediately after his sittings at Grenoble\nBailey came to England, and in the month of May this year\n(1911) he commenced to give public seances in London.\nThe first time I attended one of his seances was on the\n14th of June, 1911. These seances were held at the furnished\nflat occupied by Mrs. Foster Turner, who in her circulars styles\nherself the Australian World-famed Psychological Demonstrator\nand Court Clairvoyante. I went unaccompanied. A lady and\nI were evidently the only strangers present ; the other sitters\nconsisted of a gentleman who calls himself Professor Abbott (and\nhas the management of Bailey's and Mrs. Foster Turner's stances,\nacting as a kind of secretary to receive the fees from the sitters,\netc.), Mrs. Foster Turner and some members of her family or\nfriends who apparently resided in the same flat. We all waited\nin the drawing-room till the medium should arrive. In a short\ntime we were told that he had come and was waiting in another\nroom. We were then asked to go into the seance room before\nBailey entered it. I found that a large cage stood in the middle\nof the room, large enough to admit of the medium standing up\n1 For reports of these phenomena and evidence of fraud practised by Bailey in\nconnection with them, see Journal S.P.R., Vol. XII. pp. 46, 77-88, 109-118.\n\"See Annahs des Sciences Psychiques, March, 1910, and Light, April, 1910.\n\fFeb., 1912. Report on ^ittivgs loitli Charles Bailey. 195\nin it, and giving room for him to move about. Tiie base of the\ncage measured about five feet square, and the height about six\nfeet ; the cage was made of wooden supports on which had been\nnailed with tacks some kind of netting with a small mesh\nthrough which the medium could be well seen. I had no\nopportunity at the first seance of examining this cage, as the\nsitters had hardly entered the seance room when they were\nrequested to take their seats by Mrs. Foster Turner, who pointed\nto a chair which she informed me I should occupy, and then\nshe pointed to another chair next to mine which she asked\nthe lady visitor to occupy. I made no demur on occupying\nmy seat, as I intended at first simply to watch the proceedings,\nand to be present at several subsequent seances. It struck\nme as a suspicious circumstance that the lady and I, the only\nstrangers present, should be asked to take seats away from the\nopening of the cage. One side of the cage hung on hinges and\nserved as a door.\nOwing to my position, it would have been difficult for me\nto be aware (in the complete darkness that prevailed during\nthe time that apports were supposed to be brought by the\nalleged controls) whether the door had been opened by a\nconfederate to hand objects into the cage to Bailey. After\nwe had taken our seats the medium entered the room and sat\non a chair in the cage. I made the observation that he had\nnot been examined. He thereupon took off his coat, and com-\nmenced slapping himself over his body to show that there was\nnothing hidden about his person, making at the same time the\nremark that if he had a live bird concealed about him it would\nbe killed. He asked me to enter the cage and examine him.\nI proceeded to feel over his body, but as several ladies were\npresent I could not thoroughly examine him. It was not my\nintention to submit him at my first seance to a thorough\nexamination, as I wished him to believe I was satisfied\nwith my imperfect one, and I desired that he should gain\nconfidence in me. I attended the seance under a pseudonym\nand assumed ignorance of spiritualistic physical phenomena.\nAfter the examination I was requested to lock the cage with\na padlock which was handed to me, and to keep the key in\nmy possession. I proceeded to do this, and resumed my seat.\nAlmost immediately after the medium appeared to go into a\ntrance\u2014said, \" Good evening, friends.\" Several persons present\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.\nreplied :\n\" Good evening, Dr. Whitcomb.\" This Dr. Whitcomb,\nI was informed, was a spirit who had taken control of the\nmedium. The medium then stood up, and the alleged Dr.\nWhitcomb proceeded to deliver a long speech which purported\nto be an explanation (for the benefit of those of the sitters\nwho were not acquainted with spiritualistic phenomena) of the\nmethod used by the Hindoo spirits for the transportation of\nthe objects from Australia, India, etc. We were told that the\nHindoo controls first etherealized or dematerialized the objects,\nand then by means of vibrations in the intervening ether they\ntransported the objects to the seance room. The objects being\nin a dematerialized condition, passed through the walls of the\nseance room ; the place in the wall through wliich they passed\nbeing also dematerialized. After the objects had entered the\ncage, the Hindoo controls re-materialized them. Light caused\nvibrations in the ether, and interfered with the vibrations\nnecessary for the re-materialization, hence the necessity for\ndarkness at the time the apports took place. \" Dr. Whitcomb \"\nhaving concluded his lucid explanation, another alleged control,\nnamed Professor Denton, addressed a few words to the sitters.\nThe medium then sat down, and requested that the light\nshould be put out and that the sitters should sing. The extin-\nguishing of the light resulted in total darkness. After one or\ntwo hymns had been sung the medium asked for light ; on it\nbeing obtained he made a movement in the air with his left\nhand as if trying to catch something\u2014he then opened his hand,\nand in it was a live bird. He informed us that it had been\ntransported from Australia. The bird was a very small one\n;\nit rested on the palm of his hand motionless, evidently in a\nbenumbed condition, as if it had been, for some time previously,\nin a constrained position. The alleged control said that the\nbird did not move because it had been hypnotized by the\nHindoo spirits who had brought it\u2014they always hypnotized\nthe birds before they dematerialized and re-materialized them.\nAfter a short time the bird flew from the medium's hand and\nclung to the netting on one side of the cage. Bailey then\nbecame controlled by an alleged Hindoo spirit named Abdullah,\nwho sang a love song in what purported to be Hindustani, and\nwhich he translated into broken English. Abdullah's broken\nEnglish presented a curious feature ; at a moment of forgetful-\nness he uttered a long sentence in quite correct English, quite\n\fFeb., 1912. Report on Sittings ivitli Charles Bailey. 197\nout of keeping with his previous language. At the request of\nAbdullah the light was put out again, another hymn was sung\nby the sitters, and when the light was again raised a nest with\na small egg rested in both of the medium's hands. Abdullah\ninformed us that the egg and nest had come from India, and\nthat the nest was an edible one. After this Bailey remained for\na short time on his chair inside the cage in an alleged state of\ntrance. He then came to himself, and we were informed that\nthe seance was at an end.\nDuring the seance I stood up in the darkness and\nleaned forward, placed one hand on the part of the cage\nwhere the hinges of the door were, and my other hand on\nthe top of the cage. I did not feel the door open, but I\ndid feel a sudden thump on the woodwork of the cage, and I\ncame to the provisional conclusion that a side of the top of\nthe cage had been slightly lifted up and then let down, and\nthat the apports had been introduced in this manner by a\nconfederate. By my subsequent experiences, however, at further\nseances, I have formed the opinion that the apports were\nhidden about Bailey's person, and I will proceed to give, later\non, my reasons for this conclusion.\nThe next sitting was to be a test one, under the control\nof a committee formed by Dr. Abraham Wallace, who kindly\ninvited me to join it.\nAmoncrst the members of this committee were the Hon.\no\nEverard Feilding, Dr. Abraham Wallace, his son, a friend of\nDr. Wallace who is a professor of Oriental languages, a well-\nknown conjurer, and some medical men, friends of Dr. Wallace.\nMrs. Foster Turner and Professor Abbott were also present.\nThe test seance took place on July the 6th. Mr. Feilding\nand I, before the seance began, thoroughly examined the cage.\nWe found no evidence of its being a trick one. The netting\nin several places was rather loosely tacked to the wooden\nsupports and could have allowed of very small objects being\npassed into the cage. But all these defects were remedied\nby re-tacking the netting where it had not been properly\nnailed. I thoroughly examined the carpet upon which stood\nthe cage : it had been screwed to the floor by means of screws\nthrough the carpet, and I found no openings in the carpet\nexcept those made by the screws. I also examined the chair\non which Bailey was to sit : it was a plain, cane chair with\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.\nnothing secreted about it. After I had finished my inspection\nwe were informed that Bailey had arrived and was in an\nadjoining room. A committee of examination consisting of\nDr. Abraham Wallace, the well-known conjurer and myself\nwas appointed. Professor Abbott was also present at the\nexamination. We proceeded to the room where Bailey was,\nand requested him to remove his clothes. He at once com-\nplied. Dr. Wallace, in the presence of the other members of\nthe examining committee, felt all over his naked body. Bailey\nthrough an accident has broken his left rib ; this rib stands out\nin a lump and any person examining him by feeling over his\nclothes would easily take this lump to be an object concealed\nabout his person. I proceeded to thoroughly examine his\nclothes as they lay on the floor, including his stockings and\nboots, carefully taking note that the heels were not hollow\nscrew heels in which any small object could be concealed.\nThe interior of his watch was also examined. All the pockets,\nlining of his clothes, etc., were submitted to careful scrutiny.\nEvery part of the clothing was pressed strongly by me against the\nfloor, so that a live bird or egg (if it had been concealed there)\nwould have been destroyed. The examination was a thorough\none so far as it went, but it was not complete as it was not\na surgical one, and to this Bailey said he had never submitted\nnor would he submit to it on this occasion. The examination\nwas, therefore, not an absolutely complete one.\nAfter Bailey was dressed J)r. Wallace and I led him into\nthe cage in the seance room, taking care that he should not\nlay hold of any object on his passage from the room where\nhe had been examined to the cage. Bailey having seated\nhimself in the cage the same order of procedure followed as at\nmy first seance. He went into an alleged trance ; the supposed\ncontrols, Dr. Whitcomb and Professor Denton, made speeches,\nand the Hindoo control began to speak in what purported to be\nHindustani. Dr. Wallace at this point said to the professor\nof Oriental languages, who was sitting by his side, \" Now, you\nspeak to him in Hindustani.\" This gentleman addressed a few\nwords in that language to the supposed Abdullah, who imme-\ndiately ceased to address us in his alleged Hindustani and\nbegan to talk in broken English. This looked rather suspicious.\nAbdullah then asked that the light should be put out, and\nthat the sitters should sing. I had been appointed to lock\n\fFeb., 1912. Report on Sittings with Charles Bailey.\nthe door of the cage, to keep the key of the padlock in my\npossession, and to sit close to the opening of the cage. At\nthe time of intense darkness, when the apports were supposed\nto come from India or Australia, etc., I stood up, placed one\nhand on the part of the cage where it opened and one hand\non the top. This time I felt no motion in the wooden frame-\nwork, altliough both Mr. Feilding and I heard on two occasions\nsounds like the creaking of wood, probably produced by Bailey\nwri\"crlino- about in his chair. That he was moving could be\ndistinctly heard, notwithstanding the sound ot the singing.\nAbdullah requested that the electric light should be put up.\nOn this being done the sitters saw what appeared to be a\nnest held by the medium in both his hands, and within the\nnest was a small blue egg and a blackbird's egg. Bailey took\nthese eggs out of the nest one at a time, and placed them\nclose to\" the netting for us to see them better. On a doubt\nbeing expressed whether they were real eggs and not made\nof chalk or marble, Bailey asked me to open the cage; he\nthen broke one of the eggs between his fingers and the other\non the palm of one of the medical gentlemen. He then handed\nthem out. They were undoubtedly real eggs, and the contents\nsmelt quite fresh. Bailey said that it was not the custom\nof the Hindoo controls to destroy the eggs they brought, as\nthey objected to destroy life in any form, and that they\nreturned them to the nests of the parent birds after the\nseances, but on this occasion the controls consented to have\nthem broken, as it was a test seance. One of the gentlemen\npresent remarked that blackbirds' eggs were not laid at this\ntime of the year. Bailey replied that the small blue egg\nhad come from Africa and the blackbird's egg from an island,\nthe name of which he gave, but which I do not remember.\nSome of the members present remarked that the eggs were\nfresh, and it was curious that the blackbird's egg, if it had\nbeen laid some time ago, should not be addled. One of the\nmembers of the committee thereupon remarked that he knew a\nmethod by which eggs could be preserved fresh for a long time.\nI obtained possession of the nest, which consisted of\nfine palm fibres. I had noticed that while Bailey had it\nin his two hands he kept his hands together so that they\nformed a hollow in which the nest rested. The medium gave\nme the impression that he kept the nest in the hollow of\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.\nhis hands in order that it should not lose its form\u2014in fact,\nwhen I obtained it I found the fibres loosely held together,\nand soon lost the form of a nest. I flattened the fibres between\nthe palms of my hands : they presented so slight a thickness,\nand were so pliant, that they could have been placed within\nthe lining of any part of the medium's clothing, and that\npart of the lining could have been squeezed and rumpled\nabout without the fibre being felt. We might have verified\nwhether any part of the lining of Bailey's clothes had become\nunstitched, but subsequent events prevented our doing so.\nAfter he had handed out the nest and eggs, he remained\nfor a very short time within the cage in a state of alleged\ntrance. He soon came to himself, and straightway left the\nroom. The committee then discussed the results. The opinion\nof the majority of the members was that inasmuch as Bailey\nhad not been submitted to a surgical examination, the phenomena\ndid not offer sufficient evidence of their being of a supernormal\nnature. We then proceeded to call Bailey back to the seance\nroom to discuss the results with him, but it was found that\nhe had left the house. His sudden departure gave the\nimpression that he was reluctant to discuss the matter.\nAfter this disappointing test seance Dr. Wallace and I left\nMrs. Foster Turner's house together. I then suggested to Dr.\nWallace that it would be advisable to put Bailey inside a bag,\nthe bag to be of such a form as to cover the whole body\nincluding the head ; the part of the bag above the medium's\nneck, and covering his head, to be of fine meshed netting sa\nthat he could breathe freely. This bag would preclude the\nnecessity of submitting Bailey to the severe examination which\nhe had informed us he had never undergone, and to which he\nsaid he would never submit. If Bailey obtained live birds\noutside the bag, and within the cage, without the bag or the\ncage showing at the end of the seance any defect or any\naperture through which the birds could have been thrust,\nthen the phenomena would be worthy of serious considera-\ntion. Dr. Wallace and I arranged that we should take such\na bag to a subsequent seance. Bailey was not informed by\nus that we intended to do so. I set to work and had a bag\nmade at my own home : it consisted of black satinette, except\nthe part which was to cover the medium's head, which was\nof mosquito netting\u2014the holes in the meshes being so fine\n\fFeb., 1912. Report on Sittings luith Charles Bailey. 201\nthat they would not admit of small objects being passed through\nthem. Had a blade of very fine grass or an object of any such\nshape appeared at this seance and been claimed by the medium\nto be an apport, we should not have attached any evidential\nvalue to it. 1 superintended the making of the bag myself.\nI took care that the parts which required to be sewn together\nshould be doubled over each other several times, and then twice\nsewn through along their lengths with very strong thread.\nDr. Wallace and I attended the seance of the 13th July. I\nhad the bag ready in a leather hand-bag which I placed by\nmy side in the seance room. Bailey entered the room and\ntook a seat within the cage. I then suggested in a low voice\nto Dr. Wallace that we should show the satinette bag to Bailey,\nand ask him whether he would consent to be put into it.\nDr. Wallace thought it would be better to wait till the medium\nwas controlled by the alleged Dr. Whitcomb. On Bailey being\ncontrolled by this supposed spirit I took the bag out of the\nleather hand-bag. Dr. Wallace then asked \" Dr. Whitcomb \"\nwhether he would allow the medium to be put into it, at the\nsame time pointing out that the test seance had not been a\nsatisfactory one, as the examination on that occasion had not\nbeen an absolutely complete one, but that if Dr. Whitcomb\nconsented, and live birds were produced within the cage and\noutside the bag without any injury to the bag or cage, the\nnecessity of the severe examination would not be required.\nWe also said that if the apports of live birds were supernormal,\nthey would be phenomena of such an important nature that\nthey required to be carried out under scientific tests. The\nalleged Dr. Whitcomb absolutely refused. Thereupon there\nfollowed for about an hour a heated discussion between Dr.\nWallace, myself, and the alleged control, but no amount of\nreasoning would convince Dr. Whitcomb. His refusal was\nwhat I had anticipated. Amongst his reasons for not allowing\nthe medium to enter the bag he stated that the material of\nthe bag would not allow the animal magnetism to pass\nthrough it. I fail to see why the bag would act in this\nmanner, while Bailey's clothes, which were of a thicker texture\nthan the bag, allowed the so-called animal magnetism easily to\npass through them. Professor Abbott made the suggestion that\nthe part of the netting which was intended to cover Bailey's\nhead should be removed, and that the bag should be tied only\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.\nround the medium's neck. We pointed out that this would\nnot prevent small objects from being passed through the aperture\nof the bag where Bailey's neck was. Some of the sitters present,\nwho evidently were earnest spiritualists, were greatly disap-\npointed at Dr. Whitcomb's refusal to allow the medium to be\nplaced in the bag. At one moment Dr. Wallace and I decided\nto leave the house, as it appeared useless for us to continue\nthe investigation. We, however, changed our minds and re-\nmained in the seance room. The alleged Professor Denton\nthen controlled Bailey. This control, at the end of his speech,\nstated that the experiment of putting Bailey in a bag made\nwholly of mosquito netting might be tried at a future seance;\nhe did not know that anything would take place, but we might\ntry. The sitters at this seance had so far obtained no\nphenomena for their fees of 10\/6 for each person, but only\nthe benefit of hearing a long, heated discussion between Dr.\nWallace, myself, and the alleged Dr. Whitcomb, and a speech\nfrom the so-called Professor Denton.\nIt was getting late when Abdullah, the Hindoo control, took\npossession of the medium, repeated a few words which sounded\nlike. Hindustani, and then asked that the light should be put\nout. A hymn was sung by the sitters, during which a rattling\nsound was heard within the cage as if pebbles were being thrown\nabout on the floor. On the light being obtained it was found\nthat several small pieces of copper ore were lying on the carpet\ninside the cage. This copper ore, the medium said, had come\nfrom Australia. Shortly after. Bailey came out of his supposed\ntrance and retired into an adjoining room. The pieces of copper\nore were collected. Dr. Wallace and I found that when held\nin our hands they did not make more than one small handful.\nIt will be observed from the description of the seances, that I\nattended, that the apports were on each occasion few in number,\nand that they could occupy, when placed together, a small\ncompass. In the advertisements in Light respecting the Bailey\nseances it was stated that no fees would be charged unless\nresults were obtained, but I noticed that Professor Abbott\ngenerally collected the fees from the sitters before the seances\nbegan ; he evidently was sure that results would be obtained\non every occasion.\nAfter the above seance was over, Dr. Wallace and I had a\nconversation with Bailey, and he consented to be placed at the\n\fFeb., 1912. Report on Sittings with Charles Bailey. 203\nnext seance of the 27tli of July in a bag of fine meshed\nmosquito netting which was to envelop his body and head.\nI also had this bag made under my supervision at my house.\nI so planned it that Bailey should in no way be constrained\nwithin it. The base consisted of a piece of carpet three feet\nsquare, the borders of which were doubly and securely sewn\nto the mosquito netting. The carpet served as a base on\nwhich to place the medium's chair. The bag was nine feet in\nheight, thus giving sufficient material for its mouth to be tied\nat different places above the medium's head with strong cords,\nand to be then attached to the central upper wooden bar of\nthe cage, and allowed complete freedom to Bailey's feet, and\nalso allowed him to stand up if he so desired.\nDr. Wallace and 1, provided with this bag, attended the\nseance on the 27th of July. \"We placed it in the cage with\nthe medium's chair resting on the said piece of carpet ; this\nwas done before Bailey entered the cage. When he entered\nand sat down it took only a short time to draw the bag up\naround his body and above his head. We then made a knot\nin the material of the bag itself above the medium's head, and\nalso tied the mouth in several places with strong cord and\nattached it to a nail in the upper wooden bar of the cage.\nAgain at the beginning of this sitting the proceeding follows\nthe same order as at previous seances ; the medium goes into\nan alleged trance, a speech is made by the supposed Dr.\nWhitcomb, followed by one from the so-called Professor Denton\n;\nthen some words are spoken by the alleged Hindoo control in\nbroken English and in what sounds like Hindustani. The\nsupposed spirit asks that the light be put out ;\nhymns are\nsung, and we await tlie promised apport\u2014but this time we\nwait patiently, as the test conditions are severe and are new\nto the controls. One hymn after another is sung, and no\napport comes. A considerable time elapses, the patience of the\nsitters is exhausted ; the light is put up\u2014no apport is to be\nseen. The seance is, in fact, a complete failure. The supposed\nDr. Whitcomb again takes control, and says the reason of non-\nsuccess is that too much material of the bag hangs about the\nhead of the medium : the natural explanation being, that Bailey\nhad been unable to get an object outside the bag which he\nmight have had concealed about his person. This was, I under-\nstand, the first of Bailey's seances in England at which the\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.\nHindoo controls had been unable to produce an apport. I\nspoke to the supposed Dr. Whitcomb, and in formed him that\nthe inconvenience caused to the medium by the material of\nthe bag being close to liis head could be easily overcome, and\nthat I should arrange the bag in such a manner at a future\nseance that no part of it should come in contact with Bailey's\nbody. We arranged to have the next seance on the following\nevening, the 28th of July.\nPrevious to this seance I called on Dr. Wallace at his\nprofessional residence, and we tied four cords to the upper\npart of the bag at a height of about five and a half feet from\nthe base of the bag at places which corresponded to the four\ncorners of the square of carpet, which, as I have said, formed\nthe base. We then drove to the residence of Mrs. Foster\nTurner and arrived there about half an hour before the seance\nbegan. I had ample time to again thoroughly examine the\ncage and re-taek the netting that covered it at those places\nwhere there was any possibility of a very small object being\nintroduced by a confederate from outside. I also tested the\nscrews by which the cage was fixed to the floor. We then\nplaced the bag on the floor within the cage and placed the\ncane chair on the piece of carpet ready for Bailey's use. I\nmust not omit to say that I again carefully examined the\ncarpet of the seance room ; found no holes or unsewn seams.\nThe cane chair I also re-examined, and found nothing secreted\nin it. There were several sitters at this seance. After they\nhad taken their seats Bailey entered the room and took his\nseat in the cage. Dr. Wallace and I then raised the sides\nof the bag and fastened the four corners where the cords were\nattached to nails in the four corner supports of the cage. We\nthen securely tied up the mouth of the bag in different places,\nand fastened it to the nail in the upper transverse wooden\nbar of the cage. I then locked the cage, put the key in my\npocket, and took my chair and guarded the door. Bailey was\nthen absolutely unconstrained ; no part of the bag touched his\nperson, he was free to move or stand up within the bag\u2014in\nfact, it was as if Bailey were sitting in two cages, one within\nthe other. We had thus met every condition which the supposed\ncontrols had said were unfavourable to the manifestations.\nI need not repeat in detail the order of the procedure : it was\nthe same as the previous seances. Speeches from the alleged\n\fFeb., 1912. Re])ort on Sittings xvith Charles Bailey. 205\nDr. Whitcomb and Professor Denton, a few words in broken\nEnglish and supposed Hindustani from the so-called Abdullah,\nand then the light was put out. We had previously strongly\nimpressed on Bailey the seriousness of the test, and told him\nthat if an apport of live birds took place between the net\nbag and the cage without any defect being found in the bag\nor cage, it would be of great scientific value, and would lead\ngreatly to his pecuniary interest, as we should then publish\na favourable report. He had not sat for more than five\nminutes in the darkness when we heard what sounded like\nthe chirping of a bird. The supposed control said, \" Put up\nthe light at once,\" and there, outside the net bag and within\nthe cage, was a live bird. This bird appeared rather high up\nin the cage in the anterior left side ; it then flew to the back\nof the cage and clung to the netting. Abdullah said, \" Put\nout the light again, there is another bird coming.\" In a very\nshort time he asked for the light to be raised, and we then\nsaw another live bird clinginGf to the interior surface of the\nnetting of the cage, and outside of the bag. This manifestation\nimpressed us all a good deal, as neither the netting of the\ncage nor of the bag, which was clearly seen through the\nnetting of the cage, showed any defect. Both Dr. Wallace\nand I then said to Abdullah, \" Take the greatest care that the\nmedium does not inadvertently make a rent in the netting of\nthe bag, as then all will be spoilt and the evidential manifes-\ntation which we appear to have obtained will not then count.\"\nWe had been informed by Professor Abbott that on a previous\noccasion a live tish had been obtained as an apport, and Bailey\nhad told us that growing plants had been transported at his\nAustralian seances which, on each successive occasion that the\nlight had been put out and relit, had been found to have grown\nlarger and larger. In the hope of getting these apports a pot\nof earth and a basin of water had been placed by Dr. Wallace\nin the space between the bag and the cage. Dr. Wallace asked\nAbdullah to try and obtain these apports. Bailey thereupon\nstood up and began to address, in excited tones in alleged\nHindustani, another imaginary Hindoo personality, as if he\nwere trying strongly to induce him to bring these apports.\nBailey was standing up at the time that the fierce altercation\nwas taking place between the two supposed Hindoo spirits.\nHe suddenly fell flat on the floor in what purported to be a\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.\nfainting iit. His feet tore a large rent in the front of the\nbag. Now, inasmuch as this rent did not exist before the\nbirds had appeared, Dr. Wallace and I agreed that, provided\nthere were no other defect or hole in the netting of the bag^\nor of the cage, we should not consider this rent as militating\nagainst the evidence for the supernormality of the phenomena.\nWe untied the mouth of the bag and cut the four cords which\nheld it to the upper parts of the four supports of the cage.\nWe got Bailey out of the bag, and Dr. Wallace carried him\nand placed him on a bed in an adjoining room. I remained\nin the seance room, and proceeded to examine very carefully\nthe netting of the bag, and found that Bailey had made a\nhole at the top right-hand anterior corner of the bag, through\nwhich he had evidently thrust the two small birds. I noticed\nthat the feathers of the birds were rufHed, and, in fact, some\nof the tail feathers of one of the birds were broken. The hole\nhad been artfully made where it could not be readily seen,.\ni.e. near to the cord which tied the bag at the upper right-hand\nanterior corner. The tying of the bag with this cord had formed\nsome folds in the netting, and hidden amongst the folds I\nfound the hole. This was doubtless the reason we had not\ndetected it after the two birds had appeared and before Bailey\nhad made the large rent at the time of his falling on the floor in\nhis alleged fainting fit. The hole was shown to Dr. Wallace on\nhis return to the seance room. He and I then came to a defi-\nnite adverse conclusion as to the genuineness of Bailey's apports.\nThe circumstantial evidence obtained at this and the\nprevious seances which I have described points to deliberate\nfraud. I will recapitulate the evidence and state the motives\nwhich, in my opinion, actuated Bailey's conduct during the\ncourse of the seances. When Bailey knew that he was not\nto be thoroughly examined by a committee at the first seance,\nhe got the apport of a live bird. At the test seance, when\nhe was aware that a committee would examine hira, he did\nnot get live birds, but only two small eggs, which together\noccupied a small space. He informed the committee that he\nwould never submit to an absolutely complete examination.\nThe supposed nest obtained at the test seance was made of\npalm fibres, which fibres could have been flattened out and\ncould have been easily hidden in the lining of his clothes.\nUnknown to the committee Bailey hastily left the house after\n\fFeb., 1912. Report on Sittings with Charles Bailey. 207\nthis seance was over ;\nconsequently his clothes could not be\nexamined in order to ascertain whether any part of their\nlining had been unsewn. At the next sitting, when he was\nunexpectedly confronted with the satinette bag, he absolutely\nrefused to be placed in it. The pieces of copper ore which\nwere supposed to have been an apport were found, when put\ntogether, to occupy only a small space. The heated discussion\ncarried on by Dr. Wallace and myself with the supposed\ncontrol, Dr. Whitcomb, when we pointed out how damaging\nto Bailey's reputation would be our disclosure that he would\nnot submit to proper tests, evidently impressed Bailey ; he\ntherefore consented to be put in a mosquito net bag at a\nsubsequent seance. Professor Abbott, who had the management\nof the sitting, tried to induce us to apply an imperfect test,\ni.e. that the bag should be tied only round the medium's\nneck and not over his head. On July the 27th, when Bailey\nwas put in the mosquito net bag which enveloped his whole\nbody and head, the seance was a complete failure ;\nevidently\nbecause the medium did not risk making a hole in the bag\nto pass the apports through. The reason given by the sup-\nposed spirit, Dr. Whitcomb, for the non-appearance of an apport\nwas, as I have stated, that too much material of the bag\nenveloped Bailey's head. I pointed out that, if that was the\ncause of the difficulty experienced by the alleged Hindoo controls\nin producing an apport, 1 could easily overcome it, and that\nthe netting of the bag would be arranged at the next sitting\nso that no part of it would touch the medium's body or\nhead. Bailey was then apparently unable to think of any\nfurther reasons for not being placed in a bag, and saw that\nDr. Wallace and I were determined that proper tests should\nbe applied, and that if he did not consent to them his reputation\nwould be damaged amongst the members of the spiritualistic\nbody, from whom he obtains his living. There was also a\nstrong incentive for him to produce the phenomena, which,\nif not detected to be fraudulent, would redound to his repu-\ntation, as Dr. Wallace, who holds a prominent position in the\nspiritualistic world, had informed him of his intention to publish\na favourable report if the results were good. Bailey was thus\nbrought to bay ; he therefore consented to be put in the bag\non the following evening of the 28ih of July; and determined\nto produce apports between the bag and the cage. He did so\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1912.\nby artfully making a hole at the time of darkness in a corner\nof the bag between the folds of the netting, which hole he\nhoped would not be detected, and through which he thrust\nthe two birds. After the exclamations of amazement and\nsatisfaction made by many of the sitters at the appearance of\nthe birds, and when he thought that the sitters had come\ndefinitely to the conclusion that the apports were of a super-\nnormal nature, he deliberately fell on the floor in a pretended\nfainting fit, hoping thereby to tear the bag to pieces by the\nweight of his body, and thus confuse the issue ; but he only\nsucceeded in makins; a rent in the front of the bag.\nI must now make mention of another suspicious circum-\nstance. Bailey at the time that the apports take place, is sup-\nposed to be sitting quietly on his chair. At the time that\nthe light was put out at the last sitting I stood up and placed\none hand on the part of the opening of the cage, and my other\nhand on the top. I felt the wooden framework of the cage\nmove as if tugs were being given to it\u2014this was no doubt\nthe moment when Bailey was making the hole in the bag for\nthe two birds to be put through. The cords attaching the\nbag to the cage caused the framework to move.\nThe most incriminating circumstance, however, is the following:\nOn my return home with the bag, I most carefully examined it,\nand in the interior I found pieces of down from birds' feathers.\nI emphasize the fact that these pieces of down were in the\ninterior of the bag and not on the exterior. This shows\nthat the birds were with Bailey inside the bag before they\nappeared outside and between it and the cage. I submitted\nthese pieces of birds' down to the Public Analyst for Bourne-\nmouth, Mr. Eichard A. Cripps, and the following is his report\n:\nSt. Stephen's House, Westminster,\nNovember 4th, 1911.\nDear Sir,\nI have carefully examined the specimens which you left with\nme and have detected one small mass of birds' feather fluff and a\nfew isolated strands of the same.\nYours faithfully,\nE. A. Cripps.\nThe circumstantial evidence which I have laid before my\nreaders undoubtedly points to fraud having been practised by\nBailey at the sittings which I attended. ,\n\u2022\n\fNo. CCLXXXVII.\u2014Vol. XV. \" Mabch, 1912.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nCONT\nPAGE\nNote as to the March Meeting of the\nSociety, 210\nNew Members and Associates, - - - 210\nAnnual General Meeting of Members, - 210\nMeeting of the Council, - - - - 211\nGeneral Meeting, . . . . . 212\nENTS.\nPACE\nReport of the Council for the year 1911, - 2I5\nAccount of Receipts and Expenditure\nfor 1911, 220\nEudowmeut Fund for Psychical Research,\nAccount for 1911, 221\nReview: Mr. F.

L. Forbes Winslow read a paper on \" The Need for\nAdvance in P.sychology,\" of which the following is an abstract\n:\nDr. Winslow referred to the work of his father, the dis-\ntinguished alienist. Dr. Forbes Winslow, who in 1848 started\nthe Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mented Pathology,\nwhich he edited for sixteen years, after which it was continued\nunder the editorship of the writer for eight years. He was a\npioneer in the application of psychology to the medical treatment\nof the insane, and especially in pointing out the importance\nof the question of possible insanity in criminal cases. In\n1842 he published a little treatise on The Plea of Insanity in\nCriminal C((scs, which had considerable iniiuence in altering\nand humanising legal procedure, and his whole life-work and\n\fMak., 1912. General Meeting. 213\nwritings gave a great impetus to the scientific study of mental\ndisease.\nDr. Winslow laid stress on the importance of the mental\nfactor and the efficacy of suggestion in the treatment also of\nthe greater number of physical disorders, especially those of\nnervous and neurasthenic origin, and he reiterated the view\n\u2014\nnow so generally recognised\u2014that many patients are cured\nmerely by faith in their physician. This, he said, was\nemphatically the case in his own experience, and he thought\nit unfortunate that many doctors still tried to deter their\npatients from trying the effect of suggestive treatment.\nHe also lamented the absence of any definite instruction\nand training for medical students in the subject, such as\ncan now be obtained in a certain number of foreign medical\nschools. He went on to treat of individual cases to which\nsuggestion could be applied, and referred to fifteen cases of\ninveterate stammering which\u2014after other methods had been\ntried in vain\u2014had been placed under his care. These were\ntreated by \" indirect suggestion,\" the device used being that\nthe symptoms of the patient were induced by suggestion in\nanother hypnotised person, who exhibited them in hypnosis,\nbut was free from them as soon as he awoke from the hypnotic\ncondition. The patient, seeing his symptoms apparently trans-\nferred to another person, imagined that they had passed away\nfrom himself, and the effect of this idea on him was actually\nto prevent their recurrence.\nDr. Winslow said that his attention had been originally\ndrawn to this plan by Professor Lombroso, in a case of \" Folic\nde doute,\" at which they had met in consultation. Further\ndevelopments of the method, however, in dealing with other\nforms of nervous disorder, and especially with cases of stam-\nmering, were based on his own personal investigations. He\nhad met with great success, for instance, in the case of\na father and sou, the latter aged fifteen, both stammerers.\nThe boy was cured at the first attempt, after three minutes,\nand the father was improved. The first case, said Dr. Winslow,\nwhich he had tried was that of a boy of twelve, who, after\nan attack of scarlet fever five years ago, had not been able\nto speak, but could only make painful efforts to articulate.\nHe put the boy in a chair, opposite to the so-called \" medium \"\nto whom his symptoms were to be \" transferred,\" the two\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1912.\nholding each other's hands. He then hypnotised the \" medium,\"\nand asked the boy his own name, to which he replied in his\nusual unintelligible manner. He then repeated the question\nto the \" medium,\" who imitated the boy's attempt exactly,\nmaking the same grimaces. Dr. Winslow next asked the\n\" medium \" to speak as the boy ought to have spoken, and\nthe \" medium \" gave the boy's name clearly and distinctly.\nTurning suddenly to the boy, Dr. Winslow then asked, \" What\nis your name ?\n\"\nand he replied in a perfectly clear way.\nAfter the \" medium \" was awakened, the boy again gave\nhis own name clearly and properly.\nThe cure was permanent and twenty other cases of the same\nkind were brought to him for treatment. Out of the first\ntwelve of these, nine made a complete recovery. These cases,\nwith many others treated by the writer, were proof of the\nefficacy of suggestion, which no doubt was also the explanation\nof the remarkable results obtained by the early mesmerists.\nTo-day it is applied with increasing success to an even wider\nrange of cases than those with which they dealt.\nDr. Winslow again expressed the view that the medical pro-\nfession in England were comparatively backward in availing\nthemselves of the methods of psycho-therapy, which had made\nfurther advance in France, Belgium and America than in\nEngland.\nIn regard to the use of hypnotism or suggestion to relieve\npain, he stated that he had the records of twenty cases, in ten\nof which suggestion had been tried to assist the effect of an\nanaesthetic used for an operation, while in the other ten the\nanaesthetic was used alone. Suggestion proved helpful in two\nrespects: (1) the time taken to produce complete anaesthesia\nwas reduced from 19 to 10 minutes; (2) the shock of the\noperation to the patient was considerably lessened.\nAt the close of the paper, Dr. Winslow gave a demonstration\nof the method of \" transference \" to which he had referred. The\nboy who had been cured of stammering, as described, was brought\non to the platform with the man\u2014also a former hypnotic\npatient of Dr. Winslow's\u2014who played the part of \" medium.\"\nIt was shown that the boy could repeat his name quickly and\nclearly and answer questions without stammering ; while the\nman, when hypnotised, imitated his former way of speaking.\nDr. Winslow then offered to try the effect of this method\n\f31AE., 1912. General Meeting. 215\nof suggestion on members of the audience ; he asked that any\nperson present who had a headache or rheumatic pains, etc.,\nshould come forward and he would try to cure it. In response\nto this invitation, three ladies in turn came forward. The\nman, after being hypnotised, appeared to suffer the pains\n\u2014\nin the throat, the forehead and the shoulder\u2014which they\nrespectively mentioned, and they were instructed to look at\nhim and imagine that the pain was passing from them into\nhim. After a few minutes he was awakened and declared\nhimself free from pain. Two of the ladies said they felt no\nfurther pain after this experiment, while the third said she\nfelt better than before.\nThe audience were greatly interested in seeing these\n\u2022experiments.\nTtEPOET OF THE COUNCIL FOE THE YEAE 1911.\nThe total membership of the Society has slightly diminished\nthis year. 21 new Members were elected (including one\nHonorary and 3 Corresponding Members), and 4 Associates,\nbecame Members; 69 new Associates were elected, and 4\nMembers became Associates. On the other hand, the total\nloss in numbers from deaths, resignations, and other causes\nwas 25 Members and 85 Associates, leaving a net decrease of\n12. The total membership is now 125 5, the numbers being\ndistributed as follows : Members, 301 (including 2 8 Honorary\nand Corresponding Members); Associates, 954 (including 11\nHonorary Associates).\nDuring the four previous years, 1907-1910, the total\nnumber of persons belonging to the Society has been respec-\ntively 1138, 1190, 1230, 1267. Thus it will be seen that\nthe present figures exceed those of any other year except\n1910, so that the slight falling off shown in 1911 does not\nseem a matter for any anxiety.\nThree Parts of Proceedings were issued during the year, in\nMarch, June, and August, with an Appendix to the last Part,\npublished in December, completing Vol. XXV.\nOne of the most important events of the year has been\nthe formation of a Medical Section of the Society, which was\ninstituted by the Council in March and announced in the\nJournal for April. There is already a considerable increase\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1912,\nin the number of medical members, the list of accessions\nincluding more than one distinguished American and Con-\ntinental name, and it is hoped that, as the Section and its\nwork become better known, and as medical men become more\ninterested in the study of suggestion and the psychological\nside of medicine, many more will join it. The problems of\nsuggestion and of multiple personality and minor dissociations\nof consciousness are of far-reaching importance in psychical\nresearch ;\nthey press on us, indeed, more and more urgently\nas our work advances, and especially in relation to the growing\nevidence obtained through automatic writing relating to the sur-\nvival of personality after death. In automatic phenomena, as\nMr. Myers long ago pointed out, the normal types and the\nabnormal or pathological types throw light on one another ;:\nin both cases we see certain extensions and certain restrictions,\nof faculty, and it is conceivable that further knowledge may\nlead to a more complete control over the whole field of\nmental life, which will enable us to cultivate the favourable\nand check the injurious processes of automatism.\nThe first meeting in connection with the Medical Section\nwas held in October, when Dr. Mitchell, the Hon. Secretary\nof the Section, read a paper on \" Types of Multiple Per-\nsonality,\" which is shortly to be published in a special Medical\nPart of the Proceedings.\nThe production of automatic scripts by the various auto-\nmatists whose names are familiar to the Society has continued\nduring the year, and two reports on the subject were read at\nPrivate Meetings, one of which has appeared since in the\nProceedings, and the other will, it is hoped, be published\nlater. This year also was published the first report, by Sir\nOliver Lodge, of the work of a new automatist, Mrs. Willett,.\nwhose script shows many features of interest. All the scripts\nare being carefully studied and analysed, and there is much\nimportant matter in them which will be reported to the\nSociety in the course of time ;\nbut, as explained last year, a\ngreat deal of time and labour must be spent on them before\ntheir full significance can be either perceived or expounded in\nan intelligible form.\nIn regard to the important question of what part may be\nplayed by chance in the production of cross-correspondences\nbetween the scripts, a series of experiments was carried out\n\fMae., 1912. Rei^ort of the Council. 217\nby Miss Verrall to test what de.^ree and kinds of similarity\nwould appear between a number of writings produced by\ndifferent persons, independently of each other, and under\ncircumstances in which it was unlikely that telepathy between\nthe writers would exert any influence. These experiments, an\naccount of which was printed in the December Journal, had\nsome analogy to certain others tried many years ago by\nColonel Taylor to test whether chance would produce any-\nthing like the results found in a successful series of tele-\npathic experiments in reproducing diagrams or drawings.^ In\nboth cases, as might have been expected, a few marked\ncoincidences appeared in the course of the whole series. But\nit was found that they were considerably rarer, and\u2014in the\ncase of Miss A^errall's experiments\u2014considerably less detailed\nand therefore more easily explicable by chance than in those\ncases where there was reason for thinking that some super-\nnormal agency was at work.\nOther experiments tried by Miss A'errall with various\nmembers of the Society during the year in automatic writing\nand other forms of automatism, with a view to finding evidence\nof telepathy, have not so far produced any results of interest.\nWhile it is extremely important to obtain further evidence\nof telepathy,\u2014both in order to contirm that obtained by the\nSociety during its early years, and to throw much-needed\nlight on the nature of telepathy,\u2014it seems that the faculty,,\nin a form sufficiently marked for purposes of evidence, is\nby no means common. It is therefore very desirable that\nit should be cherished wherever it appears, and that as many\npersons as possible should make a serious effort, through fairly\nprolonged trials, to discover if they themselves possess it.\nThe Council hope that many members of the Society will\nmake the attempt, and, in case of a fair measure of success,,\nwill communicate with the Secretary.\nThey wish also to impress on members the fact that it is\nas desirable as ever to collect well-authenticated cases of spon-\ntaneous telepathy, and of veridical apparitions, such as those\nseen at the time of death, when the death is unknown to the\npercipient. Cases of this kind have been within recent years\nvery rarely reported to the Society. This can hardly be\nbecause they have ceased to occur ; it is more probably because\n1 See Proceeding.'^, Vol. VI. pp. 398-405.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1912.\npeople imagine that their occurrence is so far established that it\nhas ceased to be a matter of importance or interest. But, as\nin the case of experimental telepathy, though there is strong\nevidence for the facts, we are ignorant of their real nature\nand meaning,\u2014of the laws and conditions governing them ; and\nwe cannot hope to advance in knowledge unless we are con-\nstantly accumulating more facts to work on.\nSo much attention has of late years been concentrated on\nthe automatic scripts, the raw material of which, from the\nnature of the case, can only be studied by a comparatively\nsmall number of persons, that members of the Society in\ngeneral may have felt that their active co-operation in its\nwork was less needed than before. The Council wish to assure\nthem that this is by no means their view, but that much\nremains to be done in the collection and investigation of\nphenomena, especially of the more simple and straightforward\ntypes which many members may have opportunities of meeting\nwith.\nMuch assistance has, as usual, been rendered during the year\nby Mr. Baggally in following up and investigating a number\nof different cases reported to the Society. His experiments\nwith the Australian apport medium, Mr. Bailey, were de-\nscribed at a recent meeting of the Society, and have since\nbeen reported in the Journal. Apart from their importance\nin throwing light on this particular case, these experiments,\ntlnough the ingenuity with which they were devised and the\nthoroughness with which they were carried out, may well\nserve as a model to future investigators in similar cases.\nMr. Baggally has also been engaged in a lengtliy and laborious\ninvestigation of an alleged Poltergeist, the phenomena in con-\nnection with which are said to have been going on for\nseveral years. They appear to be of an unusual and remark-\nable character, and we hope to complete the evidence for the\n-case later.\nA considerable advance has been made during the year in\ndealing with the mass of accumulated records of Piper sittings.\nA large selection of these was published in the Proceedings\nlast year ; most of the others do not seem to be of sufficient\nimportance to warrant their publication ; but a type-written copy,\nwith certain omissions, is being prepared, which will be acces-\nsible to serious students of the subject at the Eooms of the\n\fMar., 1912. Report of the Council. 219\nSociety. The preparation is a lengthy matter, because the\nrecords include many private details relating to the personal\naffairs of some of the American sitters, who are not willing\nthat these should go beyond the individuals to whom the\noriginal records were entrusted. It is therefore necessary to\nhave all these details cut out from the type-written copy\nreferred to. The Council believe, however, that this will not\ndetract much from the interest of the records, whether from\nthe evidential point of view or as a psychological document.\nThe Society has suffered a great loss during the year by\nthe death, on October 5 th, of one of its earliest and most\nzealous members, Lieutenant-Colonel Gr. L. Le M. Taylor.\nColonel Taylor spared no time and trouble in the work in\nwhich he was so deeply interested, and his reports were a\nmodel of clearness, scientific accuracy and impartiality. An\naccount of his work was printed in the October Journal. It\nwas announced later that he had left to the Society a legacy\nof \u00a3300, which has since been received.\nIt has already been reported that the Society has been\nfortunate enough to benefit considerably under the will of one\nof its former members, Mr. H. A. Kay. This gentleman, who\ndied in January, 1908, devised and bequeathed to the Society\nhis residuary real and personal estate.

The sale was effected,\npartly by auction, partly by private contract, in December\nlast. By reason of the necessity of procuring the concurrence\nof the Charity Commissioners in the conveyances, the contracts\nhave not yet been completed, but no difficulty is anticipated\n;\nand the Society may expect very shortly to receive between\n\u00a32000 and \u00a33000 for investment from this source. The\ntotal net benefit may be estimated as considerably over \u00a33000.\nFor the successful carrying through of the long and com-\nplicated business connected with this bequest, through which\nit has now been brought into the most convenient practical\nform, the Society is greatly indebted to the labours of our Hon.\nTreasurer, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, and our legal member of\nCouncil, Mr. Sydney C. Scott.\nThe Council are of opinion that the Library is not made\nuse of so much as it might advantageously be by students of\nPsychical Research. The accommodation for readers is at\npresent, perhaps, somewhat cramped, and the Council are\nlooking out for opportunities of making more commodious\narrangements.\nWe may add that an interesting and significant event of\nthe. year has been the inclusion of a book by Professor, now\nSir William, Barrett, on Psychical Besearch in the \" Home\nUniversity Library of Modern Knowledge.\" It is a notable\nadvance that the promoters of such a series should recognise\nthat the public both need and desire instruction on the subject.\nTwo General and four Private Meetings of the Society (for\nMembers and Associates only) were held during the year.\nThe dates and subjects of the papers read were as follows\n:\n*January 31st. \"Poltergeists, Old and New,\" by Pro-\nfessor W.

London, 1911. 330 pp. 7s. 6d. net.}\nMr. Constable's theory is that human personality, as we know it\nin this Avorld, is a partial manifestation of a spiritual self existing\nout of time and space and called by him the intuitive self. Thi&\ntheory he deduces from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Part L\nof his book is mainly occupied in justifying this, and in\nattempting to show that memory is a function of the intuitive self,\nwhich, in relation to the human personality, stores up intuition in\ntime, so that the human personality has potentially a full storage\nof ideas of its past experiences to M^ork with. Readers who do\nnot care for abstruse discussions are told that they may omit this\npart and confine themselves to Parts IL and IIL, and perhaps\ntherefore we maj^ be pardoned for not attempting in this brief\nnotice to deal with it further.\nThe main purpose of the whole book is to prove that we, as\nincarnate beings, or, as Mr. Constable expresses it, as human per-\nsonalities, can know from experience in this world that the intuitive\nself exists. He makes a special point, it must be observed, of\nlimiting the expression \" human personality \" to mean the partial\nmanifestation of the intuitive self in our universe. This is of\ncourse a mere Cjuestion of definition, and no doubt the definition is\na convenient one for the statement of Mr. Constable's arguments.\nBut it is rather confusing to give a new meaning to an expression\nalready in common use. The readers of Mr. Constable's book, for\ninstance, who are familiar with Mr. Myers's Human Personality and\nits Survival of Bodily Death must constantly bear in mind that,\nwhen Mr. Constable speaks of human personality, he does not\nmean what Mr. Myers does. Mr. Myers means a conscious entity\nwhich, though in the body here survives, as he endeavours to show,.\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1912.\nthe death of the body. Mr. Constable means a conscious entity\ncompounded as it were of soul and body, the self as incarnate and\nsubject to the conditions of this world, so that by definition it\ncannot as a human personality survive bodily death. Mr. Myers, in\nusing the phrase, wishes to emphasize the persistence of the real\nself through the death of the body. Mr. Constable, on the other\nhand, wishes to emphasize the limiting nature of the conditions\nbelonging to this world, among which he includes, as already said,\nspace and time. His intuitive self may\u2014he believes it does\u2014survive\nthe dissolution of the body and brain, but this dissolution necessarily\ninvolves, according to his definition, the death or destruction of\nwhat he calls the human personality (p. 90).\nTelepathy is another word used by Mr. Constable somewhat\ndifferently from most of us, for he includes in it potentially pure\nclairvoyance\u2014the perception of material phenomena otherwise than\neither through the senses or through other minds. He defines\ntelepathy as in the first place the timeless and spaceless communion\nbetween intuitive selves and between intuitive selves and the\nexternal, and in the second place, when manifested in incarnate\nhuman Ijeings, as communication between them or between them\nand the external otherwise than through the normal organs of\nsense.\nThat telepathy is a fact he holds to be sufficiently proved by\nthe investigations of the Society for Psychical Research, and using\nchiefiy the material collected by the Society, Parts II. and III.\nof his book are mainly occupied in showing how it carries with\nit evidence of the existence of the intuitive self, and how obseiwed\nfacts fit into his theory. In experimental cases telepathy can be\nmanifested only in limited and particular ways, while among spon-\ntaneous cases we should expect to find all possible manifestations of\ntelepathy in operation. Spontaneous cases, therefore, as (in his\nview) theoretically more important, take precedence in his book, and\nthe discussion of them occupies Part II., while Part III. deals with\nexperimental telepathy and other psychical phenomena in which\nvolition is an element.\nIt is evident that there is much in common between Mr. Constable's\nnotion of an \"intuitive self\" and Mr. Myers's \"subliminal self,\"\nas Mr. Constable himself admits. It is therefore not surprising to\nfind that Mr. Constable's interpretations of the phenomena he deals\nwith are to a great extent similar to those already familiar to readers\nof the Proceedings and of Phantasms of the Living and Mr. Myers's\nbook. He has, however, thought the questions out for himself,\nwhich gives a certain freshness and originality to his way of looking\nat things, and therefore, though we cannot say the book is easy\nreading, we think that thoughtful readers may find it suggestive,\neven when they are not disposed to accept the author's philosophical\ntheories.\nE.

Ajbil, 1912..\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nCONTENTS\nA Poltergeist Ciise, -------\nA POLTERGEIST CASE.\nThe following case was reported to us by a gentleman who\ncalled at the Eooms in October, 1911, to consult the Secretary\nwith regard to an investigation of the disturbances described.\nThese were occurring in a house in a London suburb, and had\nbeen brought to his notice by a girl, hereafter referred to as\n\" C,\" who was employed by his mother as a daily servant.\nC. lived in the \" haunted \" house as the ward of the tenant,\nMr. H., and shared a bedroom with his daughters, A. and B.,\nbut for reasons which will be shown in the appended accounts,\nour informant, here called Mr. Henry Brown, wishes her identity\nto be concealed. We therefore substitute assumed names for the\nreal names and addresses, which were sent to us, of all the\npersons concerned.\nThe Secretary fully discussed the case in conversation with\nMr. Brown on two or three occasions. Immediately after the first\ninterview, on October 13th, 1911, he wrote, at her request, the\nfollowing account\n:\n[The house] has been tenanted by the present family for fourteen\nvears, and no trouble was experienced until a month ago. Then\nbegan the knockings, which I shall presently describe, and they have\ncontinued with more or less regularity ever since. Mr. H., the\nhouseholder, is quite at a loss to account for them, nor have I yet\nheard any explanation other than a supernatural one from any one\nelse. The diagram below [representing the top floor of the house]\nwill dve some idea of where the \" srhost \" is located. He has made\nhis home in a small six-roomed house of the ordinary London type,\nand, ordinarily, haunts the top back room. To the rear of the\nPAGE\n225\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

In front of it is the bedroom occupied by the parents. In\nthe corner of the \" haunted \" room is a bed, in which three girls\nsleep (ages about IG) [C, however, was about 19]. The letters A,\nB, and C mark the position of the pillows [and of the girls referred\nto by the corresponding initials], the eldest girl occupying A. A\nfireplace juts out from the middle of the western wall, and there is\nsome odd furniture round the western corners of the room. The\nwindow is at The arrows in the diagram point itpstairs. The\nhouses on either side of the \"haunted\" one are occupied.\nThese knockings began, as I say, about a month ago. At first\nthe parents thought it was imagination on the part of the girls, and\n\fApril, 1912. A Poltergeist Case. 227\nridiculed their fears. In course of time they became convinced that\nsomething was wrong, and took up the floor. I understand that no\ntrace of vermin or mechanical instruments was found. The knock-\nings continued even when the floor was up, and a few days later\nthe parents called in the police. By this time the floor had been\nrelaid. According to one of the girls, the policemen made them\nhold up their hands. They placed a mirror so as to reflect from\nunder the bed. And they saw the boards tremble, but only that.\nThey were quite at a loss to account for the noises, and were unable\nto end the nuisance. The information up to this point was given\nme by one of these girls [C], who works for my mother as a daily\nservant. Her story is corroborated by Mrs. H.\nAs matters had become serious, I, who do not believe in spiritualism,\nagreed to visit the house with a friend who does (Mr. F. W.). I\nmust confess that I, being a student of physics (among other things),\nwas decidedly sceptical. I was convinced in my own mind that the\naffair was a practical joke. However, I was anxious to see the\ntrouble ended, and we arranged to visit the room on Tuesday last.\nIt is significant to note that the phenomena now ceased for a few\ndays.\nLast night, however, about half-past eleven, we were sent for\nin post haste. The \" ghost \" was on the war path. We hurried\ndown, and were fortunate enough to hear the entertainment. My\nfather accompanied us and witnessed the business as well. The\nknockings came intermittently as on previous occasions. When we\nlooked under the bed we heard them still, but saw nothing. But,\nwhen my father actually got under the bed, the noises ceased. The\n\" ghost \" would talk no longer. But he promptly resumed conversa-\ntion when his sphere of influence was left undisturbed.\nI was bound to confess, of course, that there was something here\nthat I could not explain in terms of physical science, for the girls\nwere absolutely still during many of the knockings. The boys were\nin the middle of the room with nothing in their hands. Nothing\nwas to be seen, but my father says he felt vibrations. I personally\ndid not, and did not try to do so. I quite believe, nevertheless,\nthat a disturbance which would produce so large a volume of sound\ncould easily give rise to perceptible vibrations. As the matter was\naltogether beyond me, I left it to my spiritualistic friend, Mr. W.\nHe began by telling the spirit that he wished to speak to it.\nHe said the code would be : one knock = no ; two knocks = doubtful\n;\nthree knocks = yes. The \"spirit\" answered promptly and decisively\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1912.\n\"yes\" or \"no\" to every question, never giving two knocks for\ndoubtful, and never leaving a question unanswered.\nHere follows a detailed account (of which the original con-\ntemporary notes were afterwards sent to us) of communications\nmade by raps in response to Mr. W.'s questions. The com-\nmunicator, after purporting to be the spirit of a . man named\nJack Morgan, who was, however, known to be living, claimed\nidentity with his younger brother, who had died two years ago,\nand asserted, as his reason for causing the disturbances, that he\nwished the three girls to sleep apart. The communications are\nof a trivial nature ; the correct statements that were made\nreferred to the age of Mr. Henry Brown, the number of persons\nbearing his surname in the I'oom, and the initial of the\nsurname of one of his friends, Mr. E., who was present.\nMr. Brown continues : \u2022 . .\n\u2022\n. ;. .\nI may add that the \"ghost\" is not only candid in regard to\nhis misleading statements (admitting that he is a fraud), but very\nready with his answers. He has, moreover, been taught a comic\nsong, and he will rap out an accompaniment to some of the lines\nin fine style. He can now manage it unassisted. He imitates the\nroll of a kettledrum with marvellous reality, and can make a noise\nlike sawing wood. He will knock on the floor, the wall, or the\nunderneath part of the mattress, on request. Thus lie combines\nwith his versatility an obliging disposition. I forgot to mention\nthat he confessed himself unable to rap anywhere except under the\nbed, and in answer to my question whether he was willing that\nhis noises should have scientific investigation, he said \" N^o.\" How-\never, I have so far disregarded his wishes as to relate his doings\nto Miss Newton.\nSome of the noises are quite loud, some feeble. Some are sharp\nand distinct, some slightly muffled. The thuds on the floor are,\non the whole, much louder than the taps on the wall. I cannot\naccount for them m3'se]f, and I keep an open mind in regard to\ntheir possible supernatural nature.\nI quite understand that my statements may be discredited b}'\nsubsequent investigation, but I am absolutelj^ convinced of the\naccuracy of what I have related. The girl who works for my\nmother [C] told me that after we had left, the noises continued\nuntil 5.0 a.m., and that they saw wisps of straw floating in the\nair. I do not, of course, make myself responsible for other people's\n\fApril, 1912. A Poltergeist Case. 229\nstatements. I have, indeed, tried to distinguish between what I\nhave investigated for myself and what is merely report, and between\nwhat I know to be correct and what I merely believe to be correct.\nIf the girls can be persuaded to sleep together to-night, I hope,\non Miss Newton's suggestion, to sprinkle flour under the bed to\ntry and detect signs of mechanical knocking. I will do my level\nbest to ensure that the girls be not given any idea that they are\nunder suspicion. I am willing to do everything in my power to\nunravel the mystery, and cordially welcome any assistance whatever.\nHenry Brown.\nThe following day Mr. Brown wrote :\nOctober lith, 1911.\nI did not last night visit the house ...\nOur maid [C] tells me this morning that the three girls slept\nlast night in the same room but in three separate beds. All they\nheard was a few small taps in the same corner of the room. They\nwill, however, sleep together to-night, and send for me if anything\nis heard. Their father tore up the mattresses yesterday, but found\nno sign of anything suspicious. She says that occasionally the\nsounds are much louder than any 1 heard the night before last.\nOn one occasion [the] father burnt brimstone in the corner, and the\nfollowing night some tremendous bangs were heard. Perhaps the\nbrimstone was an unhappy choice. One can quite understand any\nself-respecting evil spirit taking it as an indelicate hint.\nI must confess that the more I consider the phenomena, the more\ndifficult I find it to accept your theory that it is the girls. It\nwould want something as heavy as an ordinary flat iron to make\nsome of these sounds, and such an instrument could not be\nmanipulated as delicately as the \"roll of the drum,\" for instance,\nwould seem to suggest. Indeed, it is not merely a roll, but a\nregular tattoo. Of course, various instruments may be in use. I\nforgot to mention, too, that the visitant can knock on the under-\nneath part of the mattresses. A girl in bed could hardly do that.\nAt the same time, I willingly recognise that your experience of\nthis sort of thing is worth more than my convictions, and I will\naccordingly investigate along the lines you have suggested. Still, I\nfeel I ought to keep a very close watch on other members of the\nhousehold.\nI regret to say that the news of this affair is spreading all over\nthe neighbourhood. It has not yet, however, reached the papers.\nI would fui'ther add that the noises did not come at unexpected\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1912.\ntimes when no one was on the look-out. Whenever a question was\nasked on Thursday night, it was always promptly answered, save\nwhen some one was under the bed.\nThe following day Mr. Brown wrote\n:\nmh October, 1911.\nReferring to the mysterious noises at the house in ... , I have\nmade a further investigation and, I believe, got to the bottom of\nthe mystery. Of course, I will not claim to be certain, but I will\nask you to consider the subjoined remarks and to favour me with\nyour opinion in the matter. . . .\nI went down to the house at 12.0 midnight Saturday, with Mr.\nW., my father, my sister, and another friend, hereinafter named as\nMr. E. We took down a large mirror and a powerful acetylene\nlamp, to show us what was going on under the bed ; also a supply\nof flour. The girls had not gone to bed when we arrived. Outside\nthe house was a large and excited crowd, engaged in furious\ndiscussion. I went in, had a quiet talk with Mr. H., telling him\nwhat we were going to do, and asked that the girls might go to bed.\nThey had scarcelj' settled down when the knocking began. Mr.\nW. had started putting questions to the \" ghost \" before I was able\nto get upstairs, as I first made an examination of the other rooms.\nI had wished to reserve this questioning as a last resource, since\nyou had said that nothing reliable usually came of it. But Mr. W.\n. . . forestalled me. He announced that he would put to the ghost\na series of questions. Would it answer them? Yes! The questions\nwere of such a nature that we could verify the accuracy of the\nanswers.\nWe oinit the details that follow. The first question was\nambiguously answered ; the rest referred to personal matters\nconnected with Mr. W., who was a stranger to Mr. H.'s\nhousehold. Mr. Brown continues :\nOut of the nine questions one, the first, may have been answered\neither correctly or wrongly. We do not know. The remainder\nwere either answered incorrectly or not answered at all, either one\nway or the other. Obviously our ghost was not so well informed\nas on last Thursday evening. Meanwhile, we had been experiment-\ning. We found that when any one looked under the bed, or shone\na light under it, the knocking ceased. So we sprinkled the flour\nunder there.\n\fApril, 1912 A Poltergeist Case. 231\nIn reply to further questions we were told that the visitant died\na natural death, but would give no particulars of it. That he was\nnot now happy, but some day hoped to be. He agreed this\nknocking would make it longer before he was happy, and that it\nwould be to his advantage not to come and knock. He admitted\nwe knew something about it, and believes it would be better for\nhimself if he did not come. But he will not go away. He under-\nstands he is acting again.st his own interests, and he is making\nhimself unhappy. He has a reason for doing so. It is not to\nannoy the girls but to send a message. This will satisfj' him, and\nhe will promise to send a sensible one and not such a one as last\ntime. The message [was] Be careful, B. Do please.\nHe answers further questions to the effect that he has a special\ninterest in B., and if she promises to be careful he will not worry\nany more. She understands what he means. If another lady took\nthe place of one of those in the bed he could not come. (Note ! I\nhad arranged beforehand for my sister to take the place of these girls\n\u2022one by one, and see what effect it had on the knocking.) He said\nthat this banging made him tired. That he was not so fresh after it.\nDuring this second lot of questions, I kept a very close eye on\nthe girls. They were all absolutely still. The one in position\nmarked A had both hands showing. B. had\none hand showing, but was lying on her back\nin such a way that I could have detected\nthe slightest movement of either arm. C.\nwas lying on her right side, with her back\ntouching the wall, her right arm underneath her\nand her left arm under the bedclothes, but\nin such a position that I could have detected\na small movement. (I will not, in this case,\n.say the slightest movement.) Well, we carried\n\u2022on the spirit conversation to the point which\nI have reported. I then tuld the girls to put their hands together.\n\u2022C. was the only one who demurred. She said, \" What ! Have we\ngot to hold our hands together ? Oh Lor !\n\" She had considerable\ntrouble in getting her right hand from underneath her. As she did\nso, I noticed a tinge of colour cross her face. But this may have\nbeen due to exertion and not necessarily to a guilty conscience.\nWhen her hand appeared, I noticed she wore a ring on the finger\nnext to the little one [on] the right hand.\nNow after we had their hands together we could get no more\nABC\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Mr. W. suggested\nthat the spirit had said all he wanted to say and was now sati.sfied.\nSo far as I could see, every one else accepted this view. I next\nhad the bed moved. In the far corner, . close up to the walls, the\nflour bore marks of having been pressed or beaten down. Its\nappearance was consistent with the supposition that the girl C. had\nknocked on it with her ringed finger, the sharp clear taps being\ncaused by the ring, . but the muffled ones by her knuckles. I now\nexamined the wall at the side of the bed. It apparently had some\ntraces of flour on it. My father pointed out that the plaster there\nhad been scraped, and this was probably some of the debris. But\nthe scrape appeared to be an old one. The debris would have been\nbrushed away by now. And even allowing that only the finest of\nthe plaster dust would have stuck to the wall, I think this powder\nwas too fine to be that. I next had to consider whether it was flour\nscattered there while my father was sprinkling. Well, it was only\non the wall [by the side of the bed] ; there was none on the wall\n[at the head]. And again, it was close up to the corner and nowhere\nelse. I therefore concluded that in all probability it was flour brushed\nup to this particular area b}^ the sleeve of a nightdress, especially as\nsome of the dust was ahove the scoreil mark on the distempered\nwall.\nTo return to the tlooi-, the flour had been shaken away from a\ncircular area of about 10 ins. diameter, about 8 ins. from each wall.\nThe flour had been compressed in the position indicated in the diagram\n[not reproduced]. I next examined the under side of the mattress,\nfor, after the flour was put down, most of the knocks were made\non the under side of the mattress. I found some flour there, well up\nin the corner. It was too thick, I am sure, to be accounted for by\nsupposing that it had lodged there when the floor was sprinkled.\nI think it was first caked slightly on the floor by pressure, and then\ntransferred to the corner of the mattress. In short, the evidence of\nthe flour seems to point almost exclusive!}' to the guilt of the girl C.\nI believe she did the \" sawing \" by scraping the ring backwards and\nforwards along the floor. The kettledrum could also be caused by\nthe ring, but that would not be so simple. Still, she has had five\nweeks' practice. The ring is of this pattern.\nIt is all metal\u2014no stone.\nWell, I left the house with my mind pretty\nwell made up. But I said nothing of my suspicions. For during\nSaturday I had read Chap. V. of Mr. Podmore's book. Studies in\n\fApril, 1912. . A Poltergeist Case. 233\nPsychical Research, and the article on Poltergeists in the 7th edition\nof the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and I formed a strong opinion that\nthe people who do this sort of thing do it not out of cussedness, but\nbecause they cannot help themselves. Therefore they ought not to be\nmade to suffer for it. So I thought it urgently necessary to keep\nthe culprit's identity secret, while it was not urgently necessary that\nall the rag-tag and bob-tail of . . . should know all about it. . . .\nI decided on this course of action before I left the house last night.\nI returned [home] and found that my sister had similar suspicions\nto my own, though on different grounds. She said that just before\nwe left, the girl C. came to her in great agitation and concern, with\nbloodshot eyes, and tremulously asked \"What have they found out?\n\"\nAnd she was the only one of the family who did not come down to\nthe door to see iis out. I therefore took my sister into my confidence\nand availed myself of her help.\nOur next step' was to test whether a girl lying in this position could\nmake so much noise with a ring like this. We found it would be not\nonly possible but easy, which possibly accounts for the fact that the\nnoises have been heard for so many weeks. . . .\nMr. Brown here explained that he tried to obtain a private\ninterview with C, in the hope of inducing her to confes.s, but\nin spite of his efforts to see her, she managed to avoid him.\nHe continued :\nIn the forenoon I had revisited Mr. H. to test the accuracy of\nsome of her statements. And I found that the tale about two police-\nmen having come in to investigate was an entire fabrication. I\ntherefore cannot accept any of her statements, but I have enough\nfirst-hand information to pint [her] under grave suspicion. Indeed, I\nmight fairly say I have found her guilty, but on circumstantial\nevidence.\nLater he adds :\nI have just been down to see the girl's guardian. . . . We told him\n(for Mr. E. was with me) that we were pretty sure we understood\nthe cause of all we had seen and heard. But we could not explain\nto him without casting suspicion on some one, and this we cuuld not\ndo. We warned him against anything in the nature of a dramatic\nexposure, as this might cause a nervous breakdown or worse.\nFor the future, I made the following recommendations: (1) If\nnothing more happens, do nothing, say nothing, reveal nothing, be\nwary. (2) If the knocking recurs, shift the positions of the girls in\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1912.\nthe beds. Make them change places. (3) If this does not stop it,\npush the bed right close up against the wall, but do this only as a\nlast resource, as it might give rise to suspicions. (4) If the knock-\ning still continues, send me a note at once. He quite approved of\nthis . . .\nIn response to our request for the several vpitnesses' inde-\npendent statements, Mr. Brown vs^rote :\nOctober 22nd, 1911.\nMr. W. told me he was making out a report, but I understood\nit was because he differed from the rest of us, believing that a\nspirit made the noises. I think you can trust him for a faithful\naccount of the matter from the spiritualistic point of view, and he\nmay quite likely throw further light on the subject. Unfortunately\nwe have all been discussing the pros and cons of the case together,\na,nd have more or less modified each other's views. But, broadly,\nmy father and sister and Mr. E. incline to my own views, and Mr.\nW. holds to his own.\nI am asking the others of us to furnish accounts of the matter.\nAs for Mr. H., I doubt if I can get much out of him, ... he knows\nless of the happenings on the nights when we were there than we\nourselves do, as he was not present at the investigations. I think\nI shall do best to ask him for an account of what happened previous\nto our coming, and for some information about the girls. . . .\nI doubt if the affair has quietened down sufficiently to make it\nadvisable to approach the suspected girl for a confession. It has not\nyet reached the local papers. But rumours of the affair are still\nrife in . . . and, needless to say, very much garbled and highly\ncoloured. For example, the \"ghost\" is credited with making\nthe floor jump up and down, breaking an iron bedstead in two, and\nso on and so forth. Indeed, there seems to be no limit to what\nsome people are capable of believing.\nDiscussing the difticulties of explaining the deception, he\nadds\n:\nThe whole of the difficulties are only disposed of by supposing\nthat a spirit took possession of the girl's mind and caused her to\ndo these things. But then, at once, another difficulty arises. For,\naccording to Podmore, this would imply a state of secondary con-\nsciousness. And I can say, most emphatically, that the girl was\nnot only quite herself during both investigations, but very much\nherself. Henry Brown.\n\fApril. 1912 A Poltergeist Case. 235\nWe received corroborative accounts from Miss Dora Brown\nand Mr, Edward Brown on October 27 th, 1911. Miss Brown\nwrites as follows\n:\nMy brother, Mr. H. Brown, has asked me to write you my\naccount of the knocking we heard at a house in . . . I believe\ntny brother has already mentioned that the girl C, whom we\nsuspected to be the perpetrator of the knocking, is in service\nat our house. For three weeks she came to work every morning\nwith tales of mysterious knocking, which she said commenced\ndirectly she, and the two girls with whom she slept, went to bed.\nApparently these noises were not heard except when the three\ngirls were in the bed, and when heard continued for anything from\none to three hours.\nThe girl seemed very upset, and began to look ill. This my\nmother put down to fright and insufficient sleep, and so sent her\nto bed one Friday afternoon. She slept from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and\nmy father and brother promised to go to the house to try and\naccount for the knocking. However, nothing was heard for the next\nfew nights.\nOn the following Thursday, when the girl came to work, she\nsaid the knocking had come again and had lasted from 11.30 p.m.\ntill 4 a.m. Also, there was a sawing noise and the mattress was\ntorn. It appeared that many of the neighbours had been in and\nheard the noises, and the bed tipped when a woman sat on it;\nalso, there was something said about the police being called in, but\nmy brother proved the latter to be incorrect. When the girl left\nto go home on Thursday evening, she promised to send word if the\nknocking was heard that night. She sent about 12.30, and my\nfather, brother, and two gentlemen friends went to the house. On\ntheir return they told me they had heard the noises themselves,\nand all except my brother, Mr. H. Brown, seemed to think they\nwere due to a spirit, as Mr. AV. had received answers to questions,\nwhich he put in a code recognised by spiritualism. My brother\ndeclined to agree with the spirituabsm idea, but said he could not\nat that stage give a theory. On the night following (Friday) the\ngirls slept apart, and nothing was heard. It was then arranged\nthat they should again sleep together, and the four gentlemen and\nmyself should go to the house the next night (Saturday), as my\nbrother, since the Thursday, began to think one of the girls must\nbe making the noises, so wished to experiment by dusting the flour\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil, 1912.\nunder the bed, and thought he might find me useful. My own\nreason for going, however, was as follows: Mr. W., who has some\nbelief in spiritualism, had accounted for the knocks only occurring\nwhen three girls were in the bed by saying that a spirit obtained\nits power to knock from the three girls, the energy from two being-\ninsufficient.. He apparently thought this explained the tale of the\nbed tipping when a fourth female sat on it. Myself, I thought it\nwould be interesting to note if the bed tipped when I made the\nfourth person. It did not do so, and I have now come to the con-\nclusion that, with only two occupants in the bed, the guilty party\ncould not lie close enough to the wall to knock without exciting\nsuspicion.\nThe above were the only reasons which induced me to join the\nparty on the Saturday, for until then I felt (luite convinced that the\nspirit theory was the correct solution to the mystery, and on\narriving at the house I was surprised to find there seemed nothing\nsupernatural about the sounds.\nWhen I entered the room I noted the three girls lying on a double\nbed in one corner of the room. The bed was against the wall, and\nour servant C. lay next to the wall, B. in the centre, and A. on\nthe outside. Immediately I glanced at the bed my brother's theory\ncame to. my mind, and I decided to watch C, not because I thought\nher guilty, but because I saw she was the only one whom my\nbrother could fairly accuse as such. I then sat on a chair facing\nthe bed, and Mr. H., jun. (it was evident the H. family believed a\nspirit to be responsible for the noises) asked several questions and\nreceived a satisfactory number of taps in reply. Then Mr. W.\nasked several questions, mostly questions which our maid, the girl\nC, would be in the position [to answer] correctly; these were\nanswered correctly, but of the questions which touched things she\nwould not be likely to have an intimate knowledge of, the majority\nof the answers were wrong. During these questions, I noticed C.\nremained in one position on her right side, slightly turned from\nthe wall, her left hand outside the counterpane. From her position\nI did not think her able to do more than knock on the wall, but,\non lying in the same position on different beds at home, I found I\nwas able to make all the sounds that I heard on the Saturday,\nincluding the sawing noise, which can be done with either a thimble\nor a ring. The girl C. was wearing a ring on her right hand. One\nof the questions asked by Mr. W. required a number for an\nanswer. The taps commenced steadily, but suddenly stopped short,\n\fApril, 1912. A Poltergeist Case. 237\nand C. raised herself a little in bed^ saying at the same time:\n\"Oh, get up, Sid j\nyou know it won't go if any one gets on the\nfloor.\" Sidney H. replied: \"I'm not on the floor.\" At which the\ngirl lay down, and the tapping continued. The boy S. H. was\nsitting in a corner where it would be difiicult for C. to see him,\nbut I should think the Misses H. could see him more easily from\nwhere they lay. After a few more questions, my father went under\nthe bed to sprinkle down the flour ; but the girls understood that\nthis was to see if the noise went on with him under the bed. It\ndid not do so, and having finished with the flour Father came out,\nand further questions were asked and replies given. Finally, the\nsupposed spirit was asked to give a message, which I believe you\nare already acquainted with, and after which nothing more could\nbe got from it.\nThe gentlemen then left the room. I remained while the girls\ndressed to see that the flour was not tampered with. When the\ngirls got out of bed they remarked about the flour, and A. and\nB. H. were a trifle curious and amused ;\nC, however, seemed a\ntrifle concerned. AYhen dressed the girls were sent into an adjoin-\ning room by themselves. The gentlemen then came back to the\nbedroom, moved out the bed, and inspected the floor and wall, the\nresults of which my brother has communicated to you. Having\nfinished their investigation, the gentlemen again left the room, and\nthe girls leturned to complete their dressing. C. immediately rushed\nto me and exclaimed: \"Oh! Miss Dora, what have they found out?\"\nHer manner was so agitated, and she seemed so upset, that my\nsuspicions were considerably aroused. The other girls seemed quite\ncalm ; but C. was pale, trembling, and her eyes slightly bloodshot.\nI told her we couldn't make anything of it, and she seemed relieved.\nFor several days after the above occurrence nothing was heard,\nand then one morning the girl had been in about two hours, and\nfor several minutes stood looking into the fire. She then looked\nup, and said they had heard the raps the previous night ; three\nsoft knocks on one occasion. I should think this untrue, judging\nfrom her manner and from the fact that she usually spoke of the\nknocking immediately she arrived in the morning ;\nalso, she spoke\nto no other member of the family about it, and I thought she\nseemed glad that I let the matter drop. About a week after, I\nvisited [the house]. She again told me she had heard knocking. She\ntold no one else, and she this time said it [was] under the chest of\ndrawers. I questioned her as closely as possible without arousing\nher suspicions, but could get nothing very definite from her ; but\nfrom what I gather [from] the other girls she (C.) was seated on a\nchair near the chest of drawers sewing.\nThe above remarks are correct to the best of my recollection.\nDora Brown.\nThe following account is signed by Mr. Edward Brown and\nMr. E.:\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1912.\nOn Thursday, Oct. 12th, about midnight, I went to . . . with\nMr. W. and my son. The house in question was a small one of six\nrooms, including the back addition. We were at once asked upstair*\nto the back room, in which were several people, besides the three\nyoung women in the bed. We were given every facility to-\ninvestigate.\nI had at first assumed that the affair was a fraud, but the trick\nwas worked so neatly that I became convinced that some super-\nnatural power was at work. Several questions were put in a code\nof knocks, and answers were given which were mostly right. But\nthere is nothing mysterious about that, as the girl C, who slept\nnext to the wall, had been daily maid to my wife for some months,\nand most of tlie questions were about family affairs. No communi-\ncation could be got from what I will term the spirit when I went\nunder the bed, where the knocking appeared to be done. Neither\ncould we get any knocks, either on the wall or on the floor, if I\nlooked under, which roused my suspicions again. But, as I said\nbefore, it was so well worked that for the time being we were\nbewildered, and we left promising to come again if sent for.\nWe called again, accompanied by Mr. E. and my daughter, on\nSaturday, October lith. The girls had not yet retired, so we\nwaited awhile. As soon as they got into bed the knocking began.\nI made a careful examination of the adjoining rooms, and found\nnothing suspicious. I then joined the party. Mr. W. was com-\nmunicating with the \" spirit \" as before, but directly I got under\nthe bed all was quiet, so I sprinkled the floor with flour. After\ncommunicating for two hours we made the girls dress, and my son\nexamined the bedding and floor. We found a circle of about ten\ninches cleared away as if by force of air, and three marks, evidently\nwhere the tips of the fingers had struck the floor. There was a\nsmall irregular patch of flour about three-quarters of an inch wide\non the underneath part of the mattress, not far from the corner.\nAnd there was some white powder on the lower part of the wall\nnear the corner, which may have been flour or may have been\nplaster scraped down in moving the bed. AVe felt there was nothing,\nfurther to lie done, for the messages had stopped coming directly\nthe girls were told to hold their hands together.\nWhen we announced that the disturbance would now cease, the\ngirl C. came to my daughter in an agitated manner and asked what\nwe had found out. I think it has been hinted to her clearly that\nit must not occur again, and it has now ceased.\nEdward Brown.\nI agree with the above account.\nArthur Everett.\nMr. W.'s account, which was sent to Mr. Brown on October\n31st, 1911, is as follows:\nOn Thursday, the r2th October, I proceeded to the house in...\nStreet, and made my way to a room on the first floor, in which the\n\fApril, 1912. A Poltergeist Case.\nknocks -were said to be heard. Arrived there, I found some ten\nor twelve people who had congregated to hear the knocks. In a\nbed in this room were three young ladies, the gas was full alight,\nand no secrecy maintained. Upon our entering, one of the party\nalready in the room asked the author of the knocks (which throughout\nthis paper I shall refer to as the spirit for the sake of clearness\nand brevity) to knock, whereupon I heard four very loud knocks.\nIt was then requested to saw, and I heard a sound which was an\nexact representation of a hand-saw at work. This knocking was in\nclose vicinity to the bed. Directly after knocking was heard on the\nopposite side of the room, and one of my companions asked if there\nwas anybody in the next room. He was informed that it was the\nnext house, and was the children's bedroom. The knocking then\nsounded from various parts of the room, once hitting the mattress\nfrom underneath, then knocking on the frame of the bed, sometimes\nalso on the wall. I then proceeded to put questions to the spirit.\n(As some time has lapsed since the above happened, I do not\nguarantee that the order in which I now state the facts was the\norder in which I heard them on the said night.) My first remark\nwas, \" I want you to answer me some questions ; if your answer is\nyes, knock three times ; if no, knock once ; if you are doubtful,\nknock twice.\" I then said, \"Do you understand and three knocks\ncame in response. (When I speak of the answer being yes throughout\nthis paper, I mean that three knocks came, similarly no or doubtful.)\nI then asked if this spirit was a male spirit. The answer came\n\"Yes.\" In reply as to whether it claimed to be anything super-\nnatural, the answer was \"No.\" By questions I then obtained the\nfollowing information. It said it was the spirit of a person who died\ntwo years ago at the age of eighteen by a natural death, that it\nknew the three girls who were the occupants of the bed, had an\ninterest in them and refused to refrain from knocking. It stated\nthat it was aware that it was annoying people, but gave a decisive\n\" No \" when asked to desist. In answer to my question as to\nwhether it would refrain from annoying the girls, it gave a very\nemphatic NO. I asked if it could continue to knock if there were\nonly two girls in the bed, and the answer was NO. I therefore\nadvised that two girls should sleep in the bed and the other by\nherself. TMs was done, and I was afterwards told that no knocking\nwas heard. Among the answers to my questions it told us the age\nof one of my friends which nobody in the room knew except his\nfather] how many people they had left in their house and how\nmany people I had left in my home. The answer to the latter\nquestion was not known by anybody in the room other than myself,\nas three people who usually slept in my home were not in the\nhouse on that night. All the questions were answered correctly.\nOn leaving the room with my friends four very loud knocks were\nheard, and I went back and said \"Good-night,\" when the four\nknocks again came as loud as before. The knockings that I heard\ndid not come from one place only, sounding from the wall at the\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apeil, 1912.\nend of the room, sometimes from the wall at the side of the bed,\nonce from the wall on the opposite side of the room from the bed,\nseveral times on the bed itself, when I felt the bed shake, and one\nknoi^k was on the under side of the mattress, apparently about the\ncentre.\nOn one occasion the eldest girl sat up affrighted, the knock being\nright against her head. On first enquiring whether it had a message\nit wished to communicate, it replied -\"No,\" but when we afterwards\nasked it for a message, it sent the following :\n\" Devil is,\" when I\nrefused to take any more of the message and accused it of sending\nnonsense, to which it agreed.\nIt gave its name as Morgan.\nI think it was arranged with one of the girls by one of my friends\nthat they should again sleep together on the Saturday night to\nsee if the knocking came again, and I arranged to go round on\nthat evening.\nI went round to the house about midnight, and found that the\ngirls had not retired to bed. They did so, however, while I was\nthere, and the knocking commenced directly.\nI at once went up to the room, while my friends investigated the\nroom adjacent and underneath this bedroom.\nWhen I entered the room I believe all three girls were sitting up\nin bed. The brothers of the girls commenced to ask it questions\n[and answers were given as before by ra]3s]. My friend then told the\ngirls to put their hands together, and I again asked it a question.\nIt did not answer, and after they had again resumed their natural\npositions, it still did not knock in answer to our questions, and has\nnot, I believe, again been heard. We afterwards examined the floor,\nand found that the floor was clear of flour in a circle of about\nten inches, when I remarked that this\u2014meaning the floor clear of\nflour\u2014showed the knock was a material one, there being no marks\non the flour to show that the knock had come from the top of\nthe boards.\nFred.

Baggally.\nJust previously to my departure for the Continent for my\nsummer holiday in July last (1911) I received a letter from\nthe Secretary of the S.P.E. to the effect that she had had a\ncommunication from Mr. J. E., of Lewes, saying that he was\ndesirous that the Society should investigate his powers as a\ndowser, and that he had successfully located the spot where\na spring of water was afterwards found in a garden in the\nneighbourhood of Lewes. The Secretary wrote to me to ask\nwhether, as I resided in Brighton, not far from Lewes, I would\nundertake the investigation of the case. I replied that I should\nbe pleased to do so. I wrote to Mr. E. and asked him whether\nit would be convenient for me to visit him in September on\nmy return to England, and on the 16th of September I received\na reply from him as follows\n:\nPlease excuse my long delay in replying to yours of the 29th\nof July, as I have been away from home since the time you\nmentioned that you would be away. I shall be at liberty during\nnext week, and after that I shall again be away for a week or so.\nIf we can arrange a time, I shall be very pleased to meet you and\nshow you what I can do [in the way of dowsing]. The garden in\nquestion is enclosed and locked, and in the occupation of Mr. W. W.,\ngrocer, of , Lewes. He will let us have the key if he knows\nwhat day you are coming, and no doubt will tell you how he\nobtained the water and the quantity.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1912.\nI replied that I should do myself the pleasure of calling on\nhim on the 22nd of September. I accordingly went to Lewes\nearly in the afternoon of that day. On enquiry I found that\nMr. E.'s residence is situated on the outskirts of the town. I\nwas enquiring at a shop for the way to Mr. E.'s house when\na passer-by informed me that he was Mr. W. W., the owner\nof the garden where the spring of water had been found, and\nthat he knew that I was coming to Lewes that day. I arranged\nwith him to have a preliminary view of the garden before I\ncalled on Mr. E. He accompanied me to the garden. This\ngarden is about two acres in extent. It is used by Mr. W.\nas a market garden, and it forms part of what is known as\nthe Landport Allotments.\nOn examining the spot where the water was located by\nMr. E., I found that the water did not spring from the ground,\nbut that a pump had been placed over the spot, and by means\nof this pump the water is obtained. In reply to my questions,\nMr. W. informed me that Mr. E. was not a professional dowser,\nbut a man of means, who had retired from business, and who\nhad, he believed, made his money by farming. Mr. W. had\nheard that Mr. E. had the dowsing faculty, aird as he had been\ninconvenienced by the want of water in his garden, he had\nrequested Mr. E. to try his dowsing powers. Mr. E. had\nlocated water in several parts of the ground, amongst them in\nthe one where the pump stood. His men had dug for the\nwater at this spot, as it was conveniently situated in the middle\nof the garden, and they had found the water at the depth of\nten feet from the surface of the ground. When digging, the\nmen had found that the ground was loam, with veins of flint,\nand at the depth of ten feet, when they came to the water,\nthere was sand. Mr. W. had had no other experiences of Mr.\nE.'s dowsing powers, and it was the first time that water had\nbeen found in the garden. On my enquiry whether there were\nany springs of water in the neighbourhood, Mr. W. informed\nme that there was one on the other side of the hedge on the\neast of the garden. This spring had been there a long time,\nand it was at a distance of about a hundred yards from where\nthe pump stood. ,\n\u2022\nThe market garden is at the bottom of a valley surrounded\nby hills of chalk formation. The chalk formation is about two\n\fMat. 1912 Dou'sing Experiments with Mr. J. E. \u2022245\nhundred yards away on the west side of the garden, and on\nthe east side the chalk hills are at a distance of about a mile.\nThe Eiver Ouse runs through the valley, and is situated about\na quarter of a mile from Mr. W.'s garden towards the east.\nThe following sketch will show roughly the position of the\nmarket garden relatively to the surrounding hills, and also to\nthe river\n:\nMr. W. told me that the surface of the ground where the\nwater stood was ten feet above the level of the river.\nAfter I had made these preliminary enquiries and examina-\ntion, Mr. W. accompanied me to Mr. E.'s residence, which is\nnot far from the garden and on the side of the hill on the\nwest of the valley. Mr. E., in the course of the conversation\nI had with him, imparted the following information.\nThe first time he discovered he had the dowsing faculty was\nwhen he accompanied the late Mr. Joseph Long (who, I under-\nstood, was a professional dowser well known in Lewes) over\nthe property which a friend was about to purchase. Mr. Long\nwas proceeding to go over the property for the purpose of\ndiscovering water, and he had previously given a twig to\nMr. E. to hold, when to the latter's surprise the twig turned\nsimultaneously with that held by Mr. Long. I asked Mr. E.\nwhether, when this took place, he was watching Mr. Long. He\nreplied that he was not quite sure, but to the best of his\nrecollection he was not doing so. Mr. E. informed me that\nhe did not often use his dowsing powers, but at Wopsbourne\nFarm, Shettield Park Estate, near Newick, he had located water\nat places where Mr. Long had previously located it. He did\nnot know at the time the places where Mr. Long had dis-\ncovered the water. Mr. E. had also been successful in finding\nwater at Mr. Gaston's house, Westlands, top of Chailey Common,\nMid-Sussex.\nChalk hill:\nLevel of ri^er and of\nMater ijuder pump\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1912.\nI formed a very favourable opiuioii as to Mr. E.'s honesty.\nWe held an interesting conversation as to whether the dowsing\nfaculty in certain persons was due to their being influenced by\nthe electrical condition of the ground, which might presumably\nbe diflerent where water or metals lay below from that of other\nground where they were absent ; or whether it was due to the\npossession of a clairvoyant faculty by the dowsers. The late\nMr. Long held to the theory that it was due to electrical action,\nas when he wore india-rubber soles to his boots he lost the\npower. Mr. E., however, found that his wearing india-rubber\nsoles made no difference. He had noted that the twig rose\nwhen he passed over water, but it bent downwards when he\npassed over iron, as in the case of an iron pipe concealed\nunderground. He had formed no opinion as to the cause of\nthe twig's motion. He thought that a holly twig was the\nmost sensitive.\nWe discussed the manner in which the force acted. Mr. E.\npointed out that if it were electrical, its strength would be\ninversely as the square of the distance from the underground\nstream. Therefore a twig would begin to be affected before the\ndowser arrived at the spot directly over the stream. He had\nfound that this was not tlie case. The twig became suddenly\naffected only when he came to the spot immediately over the\nstream.\nAfter our conversation Mr. E. volunteered to try some ex-\nperiments. He proceeded to walk down the inclined path\nwhich led from his house to Mr. W.'s market garden, holding\nat the time the ends of a forked twig of hazelwood, one end\nin each hand. I followed him. The twig did not rise till he\ngot to within a few yards of the garden. He then told me\nthat there was water under that spot. As I was following him\ndown the path I hid, unknown to him, a sovereign under a\nstone. I did this with the object of trying whether he possessed\nthe clairvoyant faculty of discovering hidden gold coins, which\nProfessor Barrett has reported to our Society that Miss Clarissa\nMiles possesses. Before entering the garden I asked Mr. E.\nto retrace his steps, not informing him what object I had in\nview. He was holding the twig, as previously described, in\nhis hands. He passed over the spot where the sovereign was\nwithout the twig moving. One experiment of this nature is\n\fMat, 1912. Dousing Experiments %vith Mr. J. E. 247\nnot, of course, sufficient to test whether or not Mr. E. possesses\nclairvoyant powers. I hope to try some further experiments\nwith him on these lines. He has consented to try them with\nme.\nOn again descending the garden path, Mr. E., at his own\nsuggestion, closed his eyes. When he came to the spot under\nwhich he had previously said that water existed, he passed\nover it and the twig did not move. There was a sheet of old\niron lying at the side of the path. To show me that iron\ncaused the twig to bend downwards, he approached it, and\nwhen he stood over it the twig bent down. I told him that\nexperiments of this nature were unevidential, and that unless\nlie dowsed for water or metals at places where the water or\nmetals were concealed and afterwards the places were dug to\nprove to me that he had dowsed correctly, there was no evidence\nof anything supernormal. He quite agreed with me.\nWe then entered the garden. It is nearly square in form\nand has paths running at the four sides. He proceeded to\ndowse along the west path. The twig indicated the presence\nof water at two places. When the twig rose Mr. E. marked\nthe place by drawing a line across the path with his boot.\nHe then proceeded a step or two, and when the twig resumed\nits normal position he made another line with his boot. The\nplace between the two lines indicated, he said, the width of\nthe stream. He marked in this manner the width of streams\nin two places.\nI asked him to trace the course of one of the streams. He\ndid so walking diagonally across the garden, the twig remaining\nraised in his hands as he stepped over the vegetables which\nlay in his path. While he was on the other side of the garden\nwith his back turned to me (I remaining on the west path),\nI, unnoticed by him, erased with my foot the four lines which\nhe had made to mark the width of the two streams. I then\nmade four other lines at different parts of the paths and then\ncalled him back and requested liim to go over the west path\nagain and verify the width of the streams. He acceded to my\nrequest, but instead of the twig rising over the places under\nwhich he had previously said water existed, it missed them and\nrose over the new places which I myself had marked with\nfresh lines.\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1912.\nI will now state the conclusions I arrived at as to the\nexperiments I witnessed on this occasion ; but before doing so,\nI will make a few brief observations as to the position and\nnature of the ground of the garden and its relation to the\nsurrounding country.\nAs shown in the sketch, the soil on which the garden stands\nis alluvium. The garden is in a valley at the foot of chalk\nhills, down the surface of which the rain water would naturally\ndescend to the valley and accumulate under the ground. The\nEiver Ouse runs through this valley. The level of the water\nof this river is ten feet below the surface of the ground where\nthe pump stands. Now the depth that had to be dug to\nreach the water in the garden was ten feet, so that the level\nof the river and that of the water under the pump correspond.\nIn my opinion it would not have mattered at which spot\nMr. E. had indicated the existence of water, as it would have\nbeen found in any part of the garden. I was confirmed in\nthis conclusion by the fact that (as Mr. W. told me) when the\nliiver Ouse is up, the water in the pump rises correspondingly.\nThe old spring on the outer east side of the garden, which I\nwas told existed there, was not flowing when I was shown the\nspot. This was due to the dry weather that prevailed this\nsummer, in consequence of which rain water had not descended\nfor some time down the surface of the hills into the valley below.\nWithout forming an opinion whether Mr. E. possesses genuine\ndowsing powers or not, I came to the conclusion that the\naction of the twig in his hands in these experiments was due\nto auto-suggestion on his part. With his eyes open he passed\nover a place under which he said water existed, and the twig\nthen moved ; but when he closed his eyes and passed over the\nsame place the twig failed to move. The turning down of the\ntwig when he stood on the iron sheet was due to the latter\nbeing in his view, and he then through unconscious self-\nsuggestion caused the twig to move downwards. In the same\nway the four new lines which I had made in the garden path,\nwhich lines he saw and thought that he had made himself,\ncaused him by auto-suggestion to miss the places under which\nhe originally had declared there was water, and also caused\nhim to move the twig over the new places marked out by me.\nI have only one more observation to make. On one occasion.\n\fMay, 1912. Doivsing Experiments tcith Mr. J. E. 249\nafter the twig had risen in Mr. E.'s hands and he still ilrnily\nheld the two ends, he asked me to watch one end of the twig\nas he gradually opened his hand. On his doing so I saw the end\nof the twig which had been in his hand give one or two turns\nas if unrolling itself. He remarked that this was a proof that\nhe had not raised the twig himself, but that the twig had done\nso of its own accord. In fact, he said, when he used a slender\ntwig, the two ends had sometimes been broken off' flush to\nhis two hands. I immediately tried an experiment with one\nof the twigs which he had asked me to carry when we started\nfrom his house. I held it firmly in the same manner as he\nheld his twig, and I caused the forked end to rise upwards.\nI found that this action caused the two ends to remain in a\ntwisted condition in my hands, and as I held them firmly, they\ncould not untwist till I loosened my hold. I can well conceive\nthat the two ends of a slender twig could be broken off' by\ntwisting up the forked end. This breaking off' of the ends of\nthe twig has been put forward as evidence by dowsers that\nthey do not move the twig themselves. But neither the twisted\ncondition nor the breaking off of the ends of a twig, when the\nforked end is raised, offers to my mind any evidence of inde-\npendent action on the part of the twig.\nI would not imply by what I have written that I am of\nopinion that the dowsing power does not exist ; for I have\nnot had sufficient experience to come to any conclusion on\nthis subject, either adverse or favourable.\nCASE.\nG. 286. Collective.\nThe following account of a supposed apparition of a cat was\nsent to us on March 4tli, 1912, by an Associate of the Society,\nto whom the principal witnesses are personally known. The\nnames and addresses of all those concerned have been given to\nus, but since allusion is made below to matters of private family\nhistory, pseudonyms are used here. It will be observed that\nthe case was recorded within a week of its occurrence.\nJuhj \\2th, 1909.\nMy sister, H. L. Green, had a very favourite cat called Smoky, a\npure-bred blue Persian of peculiar shade and small. There was no\n\f250 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research. May, 191l'.\nother cat in the village in the least like her. This spring she\nbecame ill, and died about the middle of June, 1909. The gardener\nburied her, and planted a dahlia over her grave. Shortly before\nSniok}' died she had been worried by a dog, and had her ribs\nbroken, so that she walked quite lame. This injury was the final\ncause of her death.\nOn Tuesday, July 6th, 1909, my sister and I were at breakfast, and\nI was reading a letter aloud to her. I was sitting with my back to\nthe window, v.'hich was on my sister's left. Suddenly I saw her\nlooking absolutely scared, and gazing out of the window. I said\n\"What is the matter^\" and she said \" There's S\/ho\/j\/\/, walking across\nthe grass!\" We both rushed to the window, and saw Smoky, look-\ning very ill, her coat rough and staring, and walking lamely across\nthe grass in front of the window, three or four yards from it. My\nsister called her, and as she took no notice, she ran out after her,\ncalling her. I remained at the window, and saw the cat turn down\na path leading to the end of the garden. My sister ran after her,\ncalling her, but to her surprise, Smoky did not turn nor take any\nnotice, and she lost sight of her among the shrubs. About ten\nminutes afterwards, my sister and a friend living with us saw\nSmoky again, going through a hedge in front of the window. My\nsister again went out after her, but could not find her. She was\nnext seen about half-an-hour afterwards by the servant, in the\nkitchen passage. She ran to get her some milk and followed her\nwith it, but the cat walked away, and from that moment she dis-\nappeared completely. We made every enquiry of the neighbours,\nbut no one had seen her, or any cat like her. Of course we\nthought there had been some mistake about her death, though our\nfriend, the gardener, and the boy had all seen her dead. The\ngardener was so indignant at the supposition that he had not buried\nthe cat, that lie went to the grave, took up the plant, and dug up\nthe body of Smoky.\nWe are quite mystified at the occurrence, which was witnessed\nby four people, namely B. J. Green, H. L. Green, Miss Smith, and\nKathleen B. (servant). When last seen the cat was walking towards\nHouse, next door, where she had lived all the winter and\nspring. But when my sister went over there, the people at\nHouse had seen nothing of her. When my sister frst ran out after\nher, the cat nm away in front of her, moving fast, but on one side,\nas she did before she died.\nB. J. Green.\n\fMay, 1912. Case.\nThe account is also signed by Miss H. L. Green and Miss\nD. W. Smith. Miss B. J. Green says in a letter :\n\" We did\nnot ask tlie little maid to sign it, as we did not wish her to\ndwell on the occurrence.\"\nThe difficulty in such a case is to exclude the possibility\nthat what was seen was a real cat ; the percipients were\nevidently aware of this difficulty, and, as stated above, at once\nmade enquiries amongst their neighbours, but with a wholly\nnegative result. The peculiar appearance of the cat and the\nnature of the surroundings in which it was seen make it\nimprobable that in a small country place a real animal could\nhave escaped all previous and subsequent observation. In reply\nto our enquiries ^liss Green writes :\nMarch 9tli, 1912.\nOur garden is a fairly large one, over half an acre, and is eutirelj'\nsurrounded by a wall. The high road runs on two sides of it, and\non the other sides are our own house and Uvo houses with gardens,\nboth belonging to relations. Neither of these houses had any cat\nin the least like ours, nor had the people seen one in their gardens.\nThere is a \"spinney\" about 100 yards up the road, but none nearer,\nand each time the cat was seen it was going in the opposite direction\nto this wood\u2014-once towards tlie end of our own garden, where it\nseemed to go into a beech hedge which screens the stable, etc. (My\nsister examined all this part, but could see nothing.) The last time,\nit was going towards the wall separating our garden from that of\nHouse (my cousin's house, in which my sister had lived for nine\nmonths while the owners were away ;\nthey had lately returned to\nit). It did not jump upon the wall, but seemed to disappear as\nit got near it. A tree on the other side of the wall shades this\npart of the garden. . . .\nWhen I saw it, I was at a large window, which reaches within\nhalf a foot of the floor. Outside is a verandah, with glass tiles,\nabout two yards in width ;\nbeyond this a grass-plot with flower-\nbeds. When my sister and I saw the cat, she was on the grass,\njust beyond the verandaii, in full sight from the window. I stood\n\u2022at the window, while my sister ran out after her, and I saw the\ncat walk slowly across the grass towards a path which bounds\nthe grass-plot. My sister says she rem down this path, but I could\nnot see this, as a holly- hedge hid the path from me.\nI may add that I have never in my life seen anything super-\nnormal, nor had our friend, Miss Smith ; but my sister has twice\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1912.\nseen curious \" visions \" or apparitions, though she is the most practi-\ncal, \"common-sense\" person imaginable. Our father was Scotch\n(Gallowa}'), our mother English.\nI have wondered sometimes whether my sister's sight of the cat\ncould have been conveyed to the other percipients telepathically, so\nthat they saw what was present to her vision.\nIn reply to a letter asking for a further account of her\nsister's visions Miss B. J. Green writes\n:\nMarch Uth, 1912.\nIn reply to your enquiry about my sister's experiences, I will\nwrite down (from her dictation) exactly what they were.\nAs a young girl of eighteen to twenty she spent two or three\nyears with cousins at C- . [The] house was supposed to be\nhaunted by an old lady, but nothing was said to my sister about this,\nand it was only after her expeiience that she was told of the\nsupposed haunting.\nMy sister was in the habit of sitting up late in her room, studying\nor reading. One night when she was doing so, she heard, as she\nthought, her cousin coming along the passage to her door, which\nwas open. She hastily blew out her light and kept quiet, fully\nexpecting a scolding ! But the steps returned down the passage\nagain. Next morning she said laughingly to her cousin, \" You\nnearly caught me last night ; I suppose you saw me blow out my\nlight.\" Her cousin said, \"I never came down your passage at all;\"\nbut made no further remark, and my sister supposed it must have\nbeen a servant, but, feeling a little nervous, she took care to go\nto bed in good time. Some time afterwards she woke up with\nthe feeling of a \" presence \" in the room, and, looking up, saw a\nfigure bending over her. She was really alarmed, and hid her face\nin the bed-clothes. When she looked up the figure was gone. This\ntime my sister was both alarmed and angry, and at breakfast next\nmorning she told the story, and said she was going to cjuestion the\nnurse and other servants about it. Then our cousin begged her not\nto do so, and told her that the house was said to be haunted, and\nthat queer things had often been heard there. After this my\nsister locked her door ; but she was a very sensible, non-imaginative\ngirl, and she heard nothing further of the \"ghost.\" At the end\nof two or three years she came home, and did not visit C\nagain for several years. Then she stayed in the same house, but\non the lower floor, and though she remembered the story, and half\nexpected to see the old lady, she saw and heard nothing whatever.\n\fMat, 1912 Case. 253\nThe third time she stayed there she had a very curious experience.\nThis was two years later. She slept on the upper floor, but in a\ndifferent room, and as she had seen nothing on her last visit, she\nexpected no apparition at all. One night she woke up quite sud-\ndenly. She looked up, and there, over her shoulder, against the\nwall, was a man's head\u2014the head only. It was quite clearly seen,\nas if it were lighted in some way, though the room was dark. It\nwas a young face, with short beard^ and very sad eyes, as if they\nhad tears in them. She was so startled that she called out \"Go\naway, go away !\n\" and hid her face for a moment. When she\nlooked up the face was gone.\nShe has always said, since, that she is very sorry she was not\nbrave enough to speak to the apparition.\nHer next (and last) experience was, I think, the most curious of all.\nShe went, a year or two later, to stay with a married half-sister\nnear B who was in very great trouble and in some personal\ndanger. After staying with her about a month my sister was anxious\nto come home, and had almost decided to do so. Early one morn-\ning (it was getting quite light enough to see plainly) she woke up\nwith the same sensation of a \" presence,\" and saw kneeling by her\nbedside, with eyes fixed on her with an entreating expression and\nhands clasped, a woman's figure. She recognised the likeness in the\nface, partly to a picture of my half-sister's own mother (which hung\nin another half-sister's house), and partly to my eldest half-sister (not\nthe one she was staying with). She felt quite certain, in a sort of\nflash, she says, that it was my half-sister's own mother who was\nthere, and asking her to remain with her daughter. The figure\ndisappeared almost directly (my sister thinks she started up, or i)ut\nher hands up, she is not quite sure wliich), and it just went. But\nshe took it as a real request, and stayed on as long as she was\nneeded. (The reason she thought of leaving was because her presence\ndid not seem to benefit my half-sister as she had hoped.)\nThese are all the things she has seen. But please do not imagine\nthat she is hysterical or nervous. She is a trained nurse, very\naccurate, and particularly calm and quiet in manner. She is the only\none of our family who has \"seen anything\" (except for my share\nin \"Smoky's\" apparition), and I think any one who knew her would\nsay that she was a most unlikely \" ghost seer.\" But she is a person\nof strong will and has much influence over others, and it was this\nquality which made me think that my vision of \"Smoky\" might\nhave been telepathic from hers.\n\f2-54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1912.\nMy father's first wife died more than two years before he married\nagain, and about six years before my sister was born.\nB. J. Greex.\nI have read over this account and can vouch for its accuracy.\nHelen L. Green.\nIn a subsequent letter Miss B. ' J. Green writes:\nMarch 29th, 1912.\nThere is one more observation I should like to make re the\n\" Smoky \" story. My sister is not sentimental about animals, and\nthough very sorrj' for the cause of Smoky's death, she was rather\nrelieved when the suffering was ended, as she knew the cat could\nnot recover from her injuries. She had certainly not fretted over\nher death. I note this lest any one reading the account should\nimagine that my sister was in any hysteiical grief over the cat's\ndeath.\nMiss H. L. Green's earlier experiences, whether subjective in\norigin or not, add to the probability that her vision of the cat\nwas hallucinatory, since they show that she is subject to vivid\nvisual hallucinations. It should be noted that she was the\nfirst person to see the \" apparition \" of the cat, which lends\ncolour to her sister's suggestion that we may have here a case\nof collective hallucination resulting from suggestion ;\n\u2014verbal\nsuggestion, however, rather than telepathic, seeing that the i\nthree subsequent percipients all knew, when they saw the cat,\nthat it had been seen by Miss H. L. Green.\nThe same explanation does not necessarily apply to each of\nthe three appearances of the cat. The hypothesis that what\nwas seen was a real cat mistaken for Smoky is most plausible\nin regard to the servant and least plausible in regard to the\nMisses Green ;\ninversely, the evidence for collective hallucination\nand suggestion is in their case strongest. It is difficult to\nthink that two persons, having good normal eyesight, could be\ncompletely mistaken as to the identity of an animal presenting\nseveral marked peculiarities, with which they were perfectly\nfamiliar and which they had on this occasion an excellent\nopportunity of observing. On the other hand it may well be\nthat Miss H. L. Green, having experienced, as on previous\noccasions, a vivid subjective hallucination, was able to convey\nit to her sister. The case gains much in value from the fact\nthat those concerned are thoroughly competent observers, as\nmay be judged from the reports printed above.\n\fMat, 1912. Dublin Section. 255\nDUBLIN SECTION OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL\nEESEARCH.\nReport for the Year lOlL\nSince the last Annual General Meeting on January 26th,\n1911, the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research\nhas had another year of fairly successful work, taking into\nconsideration that definite results and advances in positive\nknowledge of occult phenomena are so dilficult to obtain. But\nincreased interest has been displayed by the Members in all\nbranches of the subject, and there has been an increased\nattendance at the meetings. There are now 105 members on\nthe list after writing off the names of a few who have resigned,\nand of several others who had not paid their subscriptious\nfor the previous year. The Committee note with pleasure\nthat the more recent members who have joined appear to\nbe just as keen in their interest in the subject of Psychical\nResearch as the older members. Since last year we have\nchanged our place of meeting, and our new quarters at No.\n8 Dawson Street appear to be most suitable for our purposes\n;\nwe find the Secretary of the Y^M.C.A. most obliging and\nanxious to meet our wishes and always ready to assist person-\nally in making arrangements for the comfort of our meetings.\nThe Committee are pleased to observe that our Library\nhas been fairly well patronised by the members and several\nnew books have been added during the year. During the\nyear j>ist closed, we have had thirteen sectional meetings\n(besides the Annual General Meeting) at which addresses and\npapers were given by the Members, always followed by general\ndiscussion. Of these thirteen papers and addresses, three were\ngiven by Sir William Barrett, the subjects being (1) Polter-\ngeists, (2) Recent work in connection with Psychical Research,\nand (3) Mesmeric Effluence versns Hypnotic Suggestion. Some\nof these papers received prominent notice in the public press.\nIt is a matter for congratulation that at the end of the\nfinancial year ending December olst, 1911, the Dublin Section\nwas in a state of financial prosperity, the Hon. Treasurer having\nreported that he had a balance of \u00a312 6s. 2d. in hand after\ndischarging all our liabilities.\nThe Dublin Section received with very great pleasure the\nannouncement that its highly-esteemed chairman. Professor\nBarrett, had had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him.\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

London, 19n. 400 pp. Price 7s. 6d. net.)\nThis book is disappointing. A rumour\u2014perhaps false\u2014preceded it\nthat Dr. Tuckett considered that he had demolished the work of\nthe S.P.R. We therefore awaited the appearance of the book with a\nlittle anxiety and a good deal of curiosity, thinking he might have\ndiscovered weak points in our treatment of psychical research which\nhad escaped our own notice. It turns out, however, that he mainly\naddresses himself to readers of such works as Mr. Beckles Willson's\nOccidtism and Common Sense or the popular psychic treatises of Mr.\nThomson Jay Hudson, and his treatment of his subject is corre-\nspondingly superficial.\nDr. Tuckett does not appear to have much acquaintance at first\nhand with the work of our society, but he has devoted a long\nappendix to criticism of the first Report on Mrs. Piper\u2014that in\nVol. VI. of the Proceedings, which gives an account of her English\nsittings in LS89\u2014which he selected for careful reading. He\nclassifies and discusses weak points which he observes in the evidence\ngiven in this report, but they are weak points which we have\nnever overlooked and therefore add nothino; to our knowledge. The\nnewest thing in his treatment of S.P.R. evidence is an attempt in this\nappendix to show that bias in the estimation of evidence has been\nexhibited by tlie founders of the Society generally, and by Mr. Mj'ers,\nProfessor William James, Dr. Hodgson, Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr. Leaf,\nMr. Piddington and Mr. Podmore in particular. Whether he succeeds\nin this we must leave his readers to judge, but we may readily agree\nwith him (p. .354) that \" However much we may think we are on\nour guard against the fallacies connected with [bias], we are still\nliable to be its victims. This is true of every human being \"\n\u2014\nincluding, as Dr. Tuckett would fully admit, himself.\nHe concludes his review of Mrs. Piper's case by \" a few remarks\nabout cross-correspondences,\" although, as he admits, he has \" not\nmade any detailed study of the subject.\" His limitation of his\nstudy of Mrs. Piper to her earlier sittings has led him into an amus-\ning slip, for he assumes that as there was contact in these there\nwas also contact later, so that muscle-reading will explain some\ns\\;ccesses in 1907. This is typical of his somewhat loose method of\ndealing with the evidence.\nDr. Tuckett's main aim is to show that supernormal explanations of\nphenomena are often adopted on insufficient grounds. This naturally\nleads him to choose weak cases as illustrations ; but unfortunately\nhe then seems sometimes to confuse them with strong ones. With\nthe aim itself the S.P.R. has no quarrel, but it is to be regretted\nthat a man with a scientific training which might have enabled him\nto deal usefully with the subject should have undertaken the task\nwithout adequate information. In the absence of this his criticisms\nfail to have any real value. E. M. S.\n\fNo. CCXC\u2014Vol. XV.

Eeciprocal.\nThe following case of a reciprocal telepathic impression occurring\nto two persons at the same time has been communicated to us\nby Mr. W. W. Baggally. Both Miss Emma Steele and Mr.\nClaude Burgess, the lady and gentleman concerned in the\ncase, are known personally to Mr. Baggally.\nMiss Steele writes as follows\n:\n16 & 17 SillWOOD Place,\nBrighton, March Ulh, 1912.\nMr. Claude Burgess, who is an invalid, had been staying at\nmy private hotel, at the above address, for some months. He left\non February 15th to take up his residence at No. 10 Belgrave\nPlace, Kemp Town, Brighton. In the interval between the date of\nhis leaving and the night of the 5th inst., when I had the remark-\nable dream (if it can be called a dream) which I am about to relate,\nI had not seen Mr. Burgess and nothing had occurred to cause me\nto think particularly about him.\nOn the above night I retired to rest at my usual time. I awoke\nfinding myself standing in the middle of my room and answering,\n\"All right, I'm coming,\" to Mr. Burgess, who, I thought, called\nthree times :\n\" Miss Steele ! Miss Steele ! Miss Steele !\n\"\nBy the time I had put on my dressing gown and lighted the gas\nI was fully awake. I then remembered Mr. Burgess was no longer\nin the house. I looked at the clock and noticed it was exactly\n3 a.m. When I came downstairs next morning, I told my cook\nmy dream, and remarked I hoped nothing had happened to Mr.\nBurgess. During the next day, Wednesday, 6th March, in the after-\nnoon, a man called while I was out and left a note from Mr.\nBurgess, which I enclose. I was much surprised by its contents.\nIt struck me most forcibly getting it from him, as he is paralysed\nand has to write with great difficulty with his left hand. He veiy\nseldom writes now, so it must have made a great impression on him\nseeing me as he relates in his letter. Emma M. Steele.\nThe letter from Mr. Burgess to Miss Steele referred to\nabove, which is now in our possession, was as follows\n:\n10 Belgrave Place, Brighton.\nMy dear Emma,\nI had a funny dream about you last night. I dreamed\nthat you appeared at about 3 a.m. Just a glimpse of you. It's\nfunny, isn't it 1 Yours, Claude Burgess.\n\f260 Jouimal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.\nMiss Steele's cook made the following statement to Mr\nBaggally :\nMarch 13\/\/t, 1912.\nOn Wednesday morning, the 6th March last, Miss Emma Steele\ncame down from her bedroom at 8.30. I saw she was looking pale.\nI asked her if she were not well. She replied that she had had a\nstrange dream. She heard Mr. Burgess call her three times. She\ntold me that she suddenly jumped np and put her dressing gown\non. By the time she had put on her dressing gown and lit the gas\nshe remembered Mr. Burgess had left the house. She said it was\nabout 3 o'clock a.m. when she heard Mr. Burgess call.\n(Signed) Sarah Pollard.\nThe following statement was written by Mr. Baggally on\nMarch loth, 1912, from Mr. Claude Burgess's dictation:\nOn Tuesday night, 5th March, 1912, I woke up at about 3 a.m.\nwith a start. I saw Miss Emma Steele standing at the door of\nmy bedroom. I had closed the door, but she appeared to have\nopened it. She was attired in her ordinarj' dress.\nI was much surprised. It was an absolutely distinct apparition.\nI had not been thinking of her the previous day and I cannot tell\nwhy she appeared to me.\nThe apparition lasted about five seconds. I was not at all\nfrightened and went to sleep immediately after.\nI was so struck by what I had seen that, next morning, the\n(jtli March, at about 11 o'clock, I wrote a letter to Miss Steele\nwhich I handed to Mr. WilHam Watkins, the proprietor of the\nestablishment where I now reside, for him to send to Miss Steele.\nIn this letter I told Miss Steele that I had dreamed that she had\nappeared to me on the previous night.\n(Signed) Claude Burgess.\nIn reply to Mr. Baggally's personal enquiries, Mr. Claude\nBurgess stated that it was the first time that he had had a\nhallucination of this kind, and he had not had one since.\nStatement hij Mr. Williavi Watldns.\n10, Belgrave Place,\nBrighton, March IWi, 1912.\nMr. Claude Burgess delivered to me a letter which he had written\nto Miss Steele, at about 11 a.m. on March 6th, which I handed to\na man of the Church Army Labour Home to take to Miss Steele.\nThe same morning at 8 a.m. Mr. Burgess told me he had dreamt\nof Miss Steele. William Watkins.\n\fJune, 1912 Gases. 2G1\nStatement hy Mr. Bagijcilly.\nI called on the afternoon of the 13th March, 1912, at the offices\nof the Church Army Labour Home, St. James Street, Brighton, and\nsaw the Secretary, who showed me an entry in their books confirming\nthe fact that, at the recjuest of Mr. William Watkins, a man in\ntheir employ had delivered a letter to Miss Emma Steele of\n16 Sillwood Place, Brighton, in the afternoon of 6th March, 191:2.\nI have interviewed all the persons connected with this case and\nthey confirmed their respective statements. W. W. B2\\GGALLY.\nIn reply to our further questions as to whether Mr. Burgess's\nexperience was a dream or a waking hallucination, Mr. Baggally\nwrote to us on April 1st, 1912 :\nI had an interview with Mr. Burgess to-day, and the following\nis the information I received from him respecting the points you\nraise. He said to me :\n\"(1) I used the word dream in my letter to Miss Steele for\nwant of a better word. (2) I woke up and then had the vision of\nMiss Steele. (3) I did not notice anything in the room at the\ntime I had the vision. The room appeared dark. (4) Miss Steele\nappeared to me in a bright light, not self-luminous or phos-\nphorescent, but just as she would have appeared in daylight. She\nappeared to me in the part of the room where the door was.\"\nMrs. Baggally sends us the following statement enclosed in\na letter dated April 27th, 1912:\nI was in the drawing-room of Miss E. Steele's sister on the\nevening of Wednesday, March Gth, when Miss Emma Steele came\nin, saying in an excited manner, \" Where is Mr. Baggally ^ He will\nbe so interested in this.\"\nShe held in her hand a letter from Mr. Burgess, and proceeded\nto tell me that the previous night she had heard, as she thought,\nMr. Burgess fall on the floor of the bedroom over her own. She\nsprang out of bed. Finding herself in the middle of the room she\nheard him call \" Miss Steele \" three times. She then suddenly\nremembered that Mr. Burgess was no longer living in her hotel.\nShe struck a light, looked at the clock and found it was 3 o'clock.\nThe following morning she felt so tired that when giving orders to\nher cook, the latter noticed her fatigue and commented upon it.\nShe told the cook the reason was that she heard Mr. Burgess\napparently calling her at 3 o'clock.\nMiss Steele proceeded to say that Mr. Burgess had, curiously\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, June, 1912.\n[enough], sent her that afternoon the note which at that moment\nshe held in her hand and in which he told her that he dreamt\nshe had appeared to him at 3 a.m. the previous night.\nMiss Steele appeared much impressed and wondered if anything\nhad happened to Mr. Burgess. I informed my husband that same\nnight on his return home, [of] what Miss E. Steele had told me.\nLaura E. Baggally.\nOn my return home on the evening of March 6th my wife\nrelated to me what appears in her statement above.\nW. W. Baggally.\nA LETTER oivinii' a short account of the two foUowino- cases\nappeared in lAnht on March 16, 1912. The Editor kindly\nfoi'warded a letter of enquiry addressed by us to his correspondent\nand we are now able to print a more detailed report of the\nincidents together with several corroborative statements. The\nnames of those concerned have been submitted to us, but by\ntheir request pseudonyms are used here.\nL. 1188. Reciprocal Dreams.\nMrs. Barnard writes on Feb. 21, 1912, in a letter to a\nfriend, which has been sent to us\n:\nFrancis and George have had measles at school. I was anxious\nabout them.... On Sunday, Feb. 11, we were up nearly all night;\nGrace, aged three, had croup and Baby Betty had influenza. D.\n[Mrs. Barnard's husband] looked after Grace and I the baby. My\nthoughts were often with Francis ; twice during the night I lay down\non my bed and slept a little ; each time I woke up telling Francis\nto be careful of Betty. I thought he could not sleep and wanted\nto put his head on my shoulder and could not because of Betty.\nTo-day [Feb. 21 i]\nhe writes, \"I only had two nights when I could\nnot sleep. You seemed quite close all night, only Betty would come\nbetween. You would not put her down. Do tell me what you did\nall Sunday night. You and Betty were with me all night. Were\nyou thinking of me? You ought to have been asleep.\"\nUpon the evidence of this letter alone, it might seem that the\ndate referred to by Francis Barnard was Sunday, Feb. 18, not\nFeb. 11, but his statement, printed below, makes it clear that\nthe earlier date is meant, when his illness was at its height.\nIn reply to a request for his corroboration of Mrs. Barnard's\n^ The letter was received on Fel). \"21, 1912.\n\fJune, 1912. Cases. 263\nstatement Mr. Barnard writes in a communication received by\nus on April 2, 1912 :\nOn Feb. 11 we were both up with sick children the greater part\nof the night. L. [Mrs. Barnard] had Baby Betty in her arms all\nnight, sometimes in bed. We were both worried about the two boys\nat school with measles. L. v\/as under the impression that Francis'\nhead ached. She wanted him to put his head on her shoulder, but\nwas afraid he would hurt the hahy. Francis' next letter said that\nhis mother was with him all night, but the baby was in the way.\nI am very sorry we burnt the letter for fear of infection of measles.\nWe have also obtained a statement from Francis Barnard\n(aged 13) as follows :\nJpril 15, 1912.\nIn February, 1912, George and I had measles at school; on\nSunday, Feb. 11th, I felt very bad and worse as night came on and\nwhether sleeping or waking I felt my mother was close beside me\nand Baby B. was in her arms and much in the way. Afterwards I\nfound she had been up all that night with baby, who was ill, and\nthought and dreamt of me all night. She thought I wanted to put\nmy head on her shoulder and could not because of B. She woke\nDaddy up saying \"Mind B. You Avill hurt her.\" When I came home\nI was very surprised, for this was just what had happened. The\nsecond thing that surprised me was that mother knew that I was in\nthe big dormitory the third bed from the door. This was just where\nI was. No one could have told her. I could not write and no one\nelse did. I was moved when I was ill in there and was not in my\nown room. [Signed] Francis Barnard.\nIn regard to the last part of Francis Barnard's statement\nMrs. Barnard writes on April 15, 1912:\nNo one told me he [Francis] was not ill in his own room. I\nall the same knew he was in the big Dormitory and his bed was\nthe third on the door side. This I told him the day he returned\nand he was astonished. I know his own room so well and I have\nonly once been in the big Dormitory.\nL. 1189. Dream.\nIn her letter of Feb. 21, 1912, quoted above, Mrs. Barnard\nalso writes\n:\nAnother curious dream happened last Friday [Feb. 16]. I\nilreamed my aunt Miss R. was being pulled up and down in a lift\n;\nthe lift was not painted and looked like zinc. Miss W. was pulling\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.\nher up and down. My mother told me it was silly of Miss W. to\ntry to do it, she nearly had an accident the week before ; she hoped\nneither I nor Uncle J. would ever pull her up.\nI have not seen this aunt for fourteen years ; I never hear from\nher. She is living in a hut in the New Forest, which is built on\nthe ground floor. Miss W. ... I have not seen for twenty years.\nNow I told D. [Mr. Barnard] about it and he made great fun of a\nlift being wanted on a ground floor house. Monday [Feb. 19]\nUncle J. writes: \"Your aunt has had built a sky parlor and has a\nlift to pull her up and down. Miss W. is now living with her and\ncan manage the lift, which went quite wrong last week.\"\nThe letter from the uncle, Mr. E., was not preserved, but\nMr. Barnard corroborates Mrs. Barnard's statement. In the\ncommunicatiou referred to already, received by us on April 2,\n1912, he writes:\nL. [Mrs. Barnard] told me of the dream of the lift two days\nbefore Mr. E.'s letter came. I chaffed her about requiring a lift on\na ground floor. Two days afterwards Mr. E 's letter came, which\nshe showed me M'ith great triumph.\nOwing to various circumstances ifc has not been possible to\nobtain any iuformation as to whether Mrs. Barnard's impression\nin regard to the appearance of the lift was correct.\nP. 283. Premonitory Dream.\nThe following case of an apparently prophetic dream was sent\nto us by the percipient, the Hon. J. Connon Middleton.\nMr. Middleton writes on April 17, 1912:\nWinchester House,\nOld Broad Street, London, E.G.\nIt may be of some interest to you to learn that on the 23rd\nMarch I booked my passage to New York on the White Star liner\n\"Titanic.\" About ten days before she sailed I dreamt that I saw\nher floating on the sea, keel upwards, and her passengers and crew\nswimming around her.\nAlthough I am not given to dreaming at all, I was rather im-\npressed with this dream, but I disclosed it to no one, as my friends\nbesides my wife and family knew that I was about to sail on the\n\"Titanic,\" and I did not want to cause them any possible uneasiness.\nThe following night, however, I had the A^ery same dream, and I\nmust admit that then I was somewhat uncomfortable about it. Still\n\fJune, 1912. Cases. 265\nI said nothing to any one and liad all my trunks packed, business\naffairs arranged, had given up my room at the hotel, and in fact\nhad completed all my plans to sail on the 10th instant. I merely\nawaited the receipt of a cable from some business friends about\ncertain matters which would require my presence in America. The\ncable came a few days before the date of sailing (on the 4th April,\nto be exact), but it suggested that I should postpone my sailing for\na few days. I thereupon cancelled my ticket, and then\u2014that is,\nmore than a week before the sailing of the \"Titanic\"\u2014I told my\nwife and several friends of the vivid dreams I had had on two\nconsecutive nisihts.\nI may mention that, previous to cancelling my passage, I felt\nmost depressed and even despondent, but ascribed this feeling to\nthe fact of my having to leave England\u2014home-sickness, in fact !\nParenthetically I may mention that my brother, whom I had not\nseen for twenty-five years, was to arrive from the East on the\nevening of the 10th, and I would thus have missed seeing him by\na few hours, and, as things have turned out, never [seen] him again.\nBeyond a few passing remarks very little was said or thought\nabout my dreams, and you may imagine the state of my mind (not\nto mention my deep gratitude for my personal escape) and that of\nmy friends when the wireless message of the disaster flashed to this\ncountry. Among the friends to Avlioni I told my dreams days before\nthe 10th was the inventor of submarine signalling.\nI have my ticket, cables, etc., in support of what I have written,\nbut I do not know whether what I have said is of any interest to\nyour Society, but if it is, I shall be glad to send you any copies\nyou may wish or show you the originals.\nI may add that crossing the Atlantic is nothing new to me, as I\nhave crossed it a dozen times during the past few years, and I never\nremember having any feeling of uneasiness when about to do so or\nduring the passage.\nThe followiug corroborative statements from the friends to\nwhom Mr. Middleton related his dream have been sent to us :\n10.45 a.m., AiJril loth, 1912.\nI, William James Feddon, Merchant, in the City of London,\nE.G., hereby declare that a fortnight ago a friend of mine Avho was\nto be a passenger on board the s.s. \"Titanic,\" advertised to sail\nfrom Southampton on the 10th April, said to me that he was glad\nhis intended voyage thereon was not to take place, for the reason\nthat he had on two occasions dreamt that the ship was being\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.\nwrecked. The cause of his not going was owing to the fact that\nhe had received cable instructions to postpone his saihng, and as a\nconsequence the ticket taken for the \" Titanic \" was cancelled.\nWm. Jas. Feddon.\nmil April, 1912.\nDear Mr. Middleton,\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th inst. I beg to say that\nI recall that, about ten days previous to the \"Titanic\" disaster, you\ntold me at breakfast that you had had a dream for two consecutive\nnights of seeing a large vessel bottom up and people swimming\nabout it. I remember remarking to you that, according to tradition,\nif you had the same dream for three nights, the incident must come\nto pass. This is all I recall.\nYours A'ery truly,\nLuciEN L Blake,\n(Consulting Engineer, Submarine Signal Company).\nApril 23rd, 1912.\nMr. Middleton told me, about April the 5th or 6th, on more than\none occasion, that he had had a most curious dream about the\n\"Titanic\" being wrecked and going down in mid-ocean. He said\nhe saw most distinctly the ship sinking and on her side, and all the\npeople in the water struggling. He said it was an awful sight and\nhad quite unnerved him. I asked him several questions about it\nat the time, as I was rather impressed by the way it had got on\nhis nerves, as he is a strong-minded man, and especially as I did not\nbelieve in dreams myself. I asked him where he was ; and he said\nhe seemed to be floating in the air just above the wreck, and said he\ncould see all the people in the water, all around. He said he had\ncancelled his ticket. I thought a great deal of what he had told\nme, and I told others about it at the time.\nJesse H. Curling.\nOn May 2, 1912, Mrs. Middleton came to 20 Hanover\nSquare and saw Miss Newton. Miss Newton's report of the\ninterview is as follows\n:\n[Mrs. Middleton] said that her husband told her that on two\nconsecutive nights he had dreamed of a ship \" turned turtle \" and\nnumbers of people struggling in the water, he himself floating above\nbut not in the water. She asked him not to sail in the \" Titanic,\"\nbut he laughed and said how foolish it would seem if he postponed\nhis business on account of a dream. He telephoned during the\nmorning that he had received a cable to delay his departure, and\n\fJune, 1912. Cases. 267\nthat consequently he had cancelled his berth on the \" Titanic.\"\nMrs. Middleton describes him as a sensible business man, who has\nnever attached importance to dreams, premonitions, impressions, etc.\nShe said, \"he never dreams,\" and, most emphaticallj', that he had\nnever had a dream of this kind before.\nIn a letter written on May 1, 1912, Mr. Middleton, referring\nto the date at which he related his dream, says\n:\nI did not tell my wife about [the dream] until I had cancelled\nmy ticket, which was on the 4th, as I felt sure that had I done so\nit would have caused her a great deal of worry, and in fact it was\nnot my intention to tell her anything about it at all, had I not\nreceived the cable which altered my plans. I am positive of the\nfact that on April 4th I told my wife, because that was the day\non which I received the cable. I had previously told my friends,\nFeddon, Curling and Blake, and while I cannot recall the exact date\nof this, I think it was about four or five days before I had received\nthe cable from America.\nIt will be seen that there is some discrepancy in these\nstatements as to the exact date at which Mr. Middleton\nrelated his dream. In his original letter of April 17, 1912,\nhe says that he told no one of his dream until after he had\nreceived the cable (April 4), but on May 1 he writes that he\nhad told three friends of it before that date. The statements\nfrom Mr. Feddon and Mr. Curling imply that Mr. Middleton\nhad cancelled his passage at the time when he spoke to them\nof his dream, and therefore corroborate Mr. Middleton's original\nstatement ; Mr. Blake's statement leaves this C|uestion open.\nThere is also a discrepancy between the statements of Mr.\nand Mrs. Middleton. Both agree that April 4 was the day\non which Mrs. Middleton heard of the dream, but whereas Mr.\nMiddleton maintains throughout that he did not mention the\nmatter to his wife until he had decided to cancel his passage,\nMrs. Middleton says that she heard of the dream on the\nmorning of April 4 before the cable had been received. All\nthe witnesses, however, are agreed that they heard of the dream\nsome time before the wreck of the \" Titanic,\" which, it will\nbe remembered, happened on the night of April 14-15, 1912,\nand the above discrepancies are only worth pointing out as\nan instance of the difficulty of getting exact testimony in a\nmatter of this sort, even in regard to quite recent events.\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.\nMr. Middleton has also submitted to us the cable which\ncaused him to delay his departure, marked with the date of\nreceipt, 9.4:0 a.m., April 4, 1912, and his ticket for the\n\" Titanic.\"\nA SITTING WITH ZENO.\n[The following report of a sitting with a Bond Street clairvoyant,\nwho describes himself as \" Professor Carl Zeno, Japanese Psycho-\nTelepathist,\" was given by a member of the Society in a letter\naddressed to Sir Oliver Lodge.\n\u2014\nEd.]\nI had a sitting with Zeno last Thursday. It was a long\nsitting, and I had a very good opportunity of detecting the\nmethod by which he ascertains the contents of the folded\npapers which are placed on the table by his clients. It is by\nsubstitution. He notes carefully the colour of the paper on\nwhich the question is written and the manner in which it is\nfolded. He then leaves the room and provides himself with\nanother piece of paper of a similar colour, and folded in a\nmanner to resemble that on the table. He then returns to\ntlie room with his piece of paper concealed in the palm of one\nof his hands. This paper he substitutes for the client's paper.\nIn your case I have not the slightest doubt that the substitution\ntook place, as you suspected (after you had placed your paper\non your forehead) when he put it on the table, \" quickly taking\nit from your forehead to the table.\"\nMy main object in visiting Zeno was not to ascertain\nwhether he possessed supernormal powers, but to find out\nwhether he resorted to fraud. I, therefore, did not insist on\nhaving the piece of paper constantly in my possession, as this\nwould have prevented his carrying out his tricks, but followed\nhis instructions when he told me to place my finger on the\npaper, to hold his hand when the paper was in it, etc.\nHe resorted to two substitutions with me, and only answered\nthe questions on two of my papers.\nIn the first case, after I had written two questions on a\npiece of paper which he handed to me\u2014which questions I, of\ncourse, took care he should not see, he asked me to fold the\npaper, and I placed it on the table in front of me (this paper\nI will call No. 1). He then, not having touched the paper,\n\fJune, 1912. A Sitting luith Zeno. 269\nleft the room. I then placed on the table another folded\npiece of paper, on which I had written a question before I\nwent to Zeno. This paper had a slight yellow tinge and its\nsiirface was of a crinkly nature, but not too noticeable. I\nplaced this last paper (which I will call jSTo. 2) by the side\nof the other paper, about eight inches away from it.\nZeno returned to the room, took his seat, and began writing\non his large pad, making at the same time a series of remarks,\nsome of a fishing nature and some of a vague, general nature\nas to the contents of the two papers which lay on the table.\nHis guesses were all wrong. He then told me to keep my\nmind away irorn what I had written. When he thought my\nattention was distracted, he placed his left hand for a second\non paper No. 1, took it up, and left in its place the piece of\npaper which had been concealed in his left palm. On his\nlifting his hand up, the substituted paper was not in the same\nposition as paper No. 1 had been, but about two inches nearer\nto his wrist. He then took hold, with his left hand, of the\nlarge pad, which he held with its back to me. I was able,\nfor an instant, just as he was lifting the pad up to this\nposition, to glance over it, and I saw my piece of paper under\nhis left thumb and between it and the pad. The pad when\nin a vertical position served as a screen, and while he was\npretending to write he opened my paper, read the two ques-\ntions, then folded the paper and concealed it in his right hand.\nOn his lowering the pad, my paper was, of course, no longer\nto be seen. He then, with his right hand, gave a push to the\nsubstituted paper on the table, and at this moment he must\nhave changed it for No. 1, which he had concealed in his\nright hand. This was so cleverly done that I confess I did\nnot actually follow the process. He now knew the nature of\nmy questions in paper No. 1, and was able to develop them.\nMy questions were: (1) \"Shall I sell my rubber shares?\"\n(2) \"Have I done well in taking a house in Bradford?\" Zeno\nsaid, \" This is something of a business nature. It has to do\nwith a liquid. It is rubber. Do not sell the shares. They\nwill go down, but there will be a rise in value, and you will\nnot suffer a loss.\"\nI replied, \" It is about rubber. Thank you. I will take\n'\nyour advice.\"\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1912.\nHe then said, \" There is a B. Do you connect it with\nanything ?\n\"\nI replied, \" Yes. It is Bradford.\"\nZeno then said, \" It is something about a house. You will\nmake a profit.\" He evidently thought I had bought a house\nin Bradford, whereas I have only rented one.\nI exclaimed, \" Mr. Zeno, you are a wonderful man. When\ndid you first become aware that you possessed these great\ntelepathic powers?\"\nHe did not reply to my question, but by the expression of\nhis face I saw that he was gratified.\nHe then attacked the question on paper No. 2. He\nrequested me to put my finger on it, while he also put one of\nhis fingers on it. He proceeded to make a number of wrong\nguesses. He said the question had to do with a business\npromoter, of whom I was to beware.\nMy question was, \" How shall I cure my persistent\nindigestion ?\"i\nHe asked me to give him an inkling of the contents of the\npaper. I replied that it had to do with a person.\nAfter a series of unsuccessful fishing questions on his part,\nhe left the room. I then verified that the paper had not\nbeen changed.\nZeno re-entered the room, recommenced to talk and to write\non his pad, which lay flat on the table. He placed two of\nhis right-hand fingers on paper No. 2, and appeared to be en-\ndeavouring to read its contents clairvoyantly. On his lifting\nhis hand, I became aware that he had made a substitution.\nHis right hand remained closed. I also noticed that the folded\npiece of paper on the table was not mine. It was of a lighter\ncolour, white and not slightly ,\nyellow, and had not the crinkly\nsurface. I made no remark.\nAfter a short time Zeno lifted the substituted paper, which\nhe had placed on the table, with his left hand. He closed his\nhand over the paper, and asked me to hold his left hand with\nthe paper in it in both of my own hands. I followed his\ninstructions. He made the remark that he felt I was highly\nmagnetic. I said I had been told that before. He asked\nme to take my mind away from the question. I said I\n1 1 had written this question on the spur of the moment, not because it\nrepresented my state of liealth.\n\fJune, 1912. A Sitting with Zeno. 271\nwould look at some object in the room and think of it. I\nturned my head slightly to tlie right, away from where Zeno\nsat, but I did not lose sight of him. I noticed him lower\nhis right hand, which held my paper, behind the table, so that\nI could no longer see his hand. I then heard the crinkly\npaper being opened, and saw him bend his eyes down and\nread the question on my paper. He kept his eyes down a\nconsiderable time. I was surprised that he failed to take the\nprecaution of talking to drown the sound of the paper at the\ntime of its being opened. After this manoeuvre he was, of\ncourse, able to tell me that my question had to do with a\npersonal matter. He advised me to consult a medical man.\nIf he did me no good he would himself prescribe some herbal\nremedy. The way that he replaced my paper on to the table\nwas simple enough. He refolded my paper under the table,\nhid it in the palm of his right hand, which he brought above\nthe table. He then with the fingers of his rio-ht hand laid\nhold of the paper in his left hand, which he had held rather\nhigh above the table. On briniiinq' his rioht hand down on\nto the table he concealed the substituted paper and let my\npaper go free from his palm.\nI saw Mr. F. before I called on Zeno. He thought\nthat the trick might have been effected by means of a con-\nfederate who spied the contents of the papers through a peep-\nhole in the little room when Zeno left it and Mr. Y. and\nyou [Sir Oliver Lodge] (at his request) opened the papers to\nrefresh your memories of their contents.\nI had heard that Zeno used tablets on which the questions\nwere to be written. It occurred to me that he resorted, possibly,\nto the Baldwin trick of having tablets with carbon paper con-\ncealed in them which would record the writing.\nI took precautions to meet both these eventualities, but found\nthat neither of them occurred at my sitting.\nA PROPOSED HYPNOTIC CLINIC AT LIVEEPOOL.\nBy C. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D.\nLiVEKPOOL has always taken an important part in pioneer work\nof all kinds, and so we need not be surprised to learn from\nthe accompanying circular that the physicians of that city who\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Arthur Smith in the chair.\nThe Rev. M. A. Bayfield read a paper on \" Some Cases\nof the Relief of Pain by Non-hypnotic Suggestion,\" which will\nbe printed later in the Journal.\nAn account was also read of a case of sudden cure by self-\nsuggestion of a long-standing malady, apparently of hysterical\norigin. The patient, who had been bedridden for five years,\nheard a voice which told her to get up and walk at certain fixed\nhours. This case, which will shortly be printed in the Journal,\nwas compared with one recently published by Dr. Edwin Ash,\nin his book. Faith and Svggcstion, in which the patient, who\nseemed to be in a dying condition, made an even more sudden\nand complete recovery after seeing a vision of an angel who\npredicted it. In both these cases the hallucination took a\ndefinitely religious form, which was probably the one best\nfitted to appeal to the subliminal self of the patients.\nON THE ALLEGED EXPOSURE OF D. D. HOME\nIN FRANCE.\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nThe question whether the famous medium D. D. Home was ever\nexposed in the fifties or sixties, in the course of his sittings\nat the Court of Napoleon III., and even expelled from France\nin consequence, though it has, strictly speaking, no bearing on\nthe question of the genuineness of his \" phenomena \" in general,\nhas always seemed to me an interesting one from the historic\npoint of view. Hitherto it had remained an open question. In\ntheir review of Mme Home's D. D. Home, his life and mission,\nMessrs. Myers and Barrett say {H.V.U. Journal, June, 1889, Vol. IV.,\np. 102) that they \"have tried in France to get at the fountain-\nhead of the story but without success \" ; and they suggest that\nthe narrative above referred to may have been \" a form of the\nreport spread in 1858 {Life, p. 106) [and undoubtedly false]\nthat Home was then in a French prison.\" If so, they thought\nit refuted by the fact that five years later Home presented to\n\fJuly, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 275\nthe Empress of the French a copy of one of his works, and\nreceived a letter of thanks from M. Hinard, the Empress's secre-\ntary, the original of which Messrs. Barrett and Myers saw\u2014as\nthey did see most of the documents so profusely reproduced in\nD. D. Home, his life and mission, and, presumably, in The gift\nof D. D. Hovbc (by the same author).-' In Modern Sjyiritualisiii,\nVol. II., p. 230, foot-note, Mr. Podmore thinks \"no testimony\nhas ever been adduced which even remotely approaches first-\nhand for the alleged exposure.\" It has been asserted to have\ntaken place sometimes at the Tuileries, sometimes at Biarritz\nor Compiegne, the date always remaining utterly vague. Still,\nit was an extremely vivacious legend, and used to creep up\nagain and again from time to time, only to be disproved once\nmore. As M. Guy de Fontenay wrote lately in the IntermMiairc\ndes cherchetirs et curieux, Vol. LXIV., No. 1306, col. 454:\n\" Eeserve faite des personnes qui s'interessent a I'histoire des\nphenoinenes dits psychiques. Home n'est guere connu que pour\n'\nle coup des Tuileries,' ou, durant une seance obscure, le\nfameux medium aurait mis son pied nu dans la main de\nrimperatrice afin de simuler une poignee de main d'outre-tombe !\nCent fois dementie et jamais prouvee, cette galegeade merite\nde survivre au meme titre que toutes les legendes pittoresques,\nlesquelles, a force de passer de bouche en bouche, finissent\nquoique fausses par devenir plus vraies qu'une verity impopulaire.\nToutefois les gens avertis et serieux n'y ont jamais cru.\"\nSuch being tlie case, I was not a little interested when I\nsaw in the Paris Temps of September 4th, 1911, an article\nreferring to a very detailed account of Home's exposure printed\nin a recently published book by Comte Fleury and M. Louis\nSonolet : La 8ociM6 ehi Second Umpire; 1851-1858. I hastened\nto order the book, and found in it some six or seven pages\n(179-186) dealing with Home's (then called Huvic) sijour in\nParis \"in the winter of 1857-58,\" and ending as follows:\nII y aurait encore nonibre d'histoires a raconter sur Hume et\nses mystifications, qui troublerent tant de gens a I'epoque. Le baron\nMorio de I'lsle, prefet du palais, qui le surveillait depuis longtemps,\n^ By the way, hardly anything is said in either of these books about the alleged\nepisode\u2014a circumstance perhaps the more worthy of notice, as much space is\ndevoted to recounting and ridiculing the many often grotesque and absurd\nrumours and racontars circulated about the most celebrated of physical\nmediums.\n\f276 Journal oj Society for Psychical Research. Joly, 1912.\nse chargea un soir a Biarritz de dessiller les yeiix de TEmpereur et\nde rimperatrice et de montrer a tous que le pretendu surnaturel de\nHume, auquel les apparences pretaient parfois una vraisemblance,\nn'etait que de la pure charlatanerie,\nUn soir, a Biarritz, Hume proposa a I'Imperatrice d'evoquer I'esprit\nde la duchesse d'Albe. La souveraine s'y refusa.\nUne des personnes presentes demanda alors a un ami mort de\nvenir lui serrer la main.\nHume, renverse sur le dossier de son fauteuil, agite de mouve-\nments convulsifs, ne se doutait guere qu'il etait I'objet d'une attention\ntoute particuliere.\nLe baron Morio de I'lsle s'etait place de facjon a suivre les moindres\ngestes du medium et, en se baissant pour tacher d'apercevoir sous\nla table I'apparition de I'Esprit, il fut saisi de surprise en voyant, a\ncote de la place occup6e par Hume, un Soulier vide.\nUn Soulier d'homme remarquablement etroit et qui avait dll etre\nfurtivement abandonne par son proprietaire.\nAussitot il fit un signe au general de Waubert de Genlis et, sans\nechanger une parole, il lui designa sous la table cette singuliere\ndecouverte.\nAu moment meme, le prodige s'operait, et la personne interessee\ndeclara qu'elle avait senti sous la table la pression d'une main glacee.\nHume se calma. Ces messieurs, qui ne le perdaient pas de vue, le\nvirent se redresser et glisser doucement son pied dans la chaussure vide.\nImmediatement, M. Morio de I'lsle alia trouver I'Empereur\n:\n\u2014 Sire, lui dit-il, on joue ici une com6die qui a trop longtemps\ndure. Qu'on rapporte les lumieres, je vous en supplie, et faites dire\na Hume de se retirer. Je vous expliquerai tout.\nL'Empereur acquiesca a ce qui lui 6tait demande. II pretexta que\nla soiree s'etait suffisamment prolong^e et on congedia Hume.\nLe baron Morio de I'lsle, alors, expliqua la petite scene qu'il avait\nsurprise. On n'eut pas de peine a comprendre que, grace a une\nconformation particuliere, Hume sortait de sa chaussure son pied\ngante, sans doute, d'une peau moite, et offrait cette pression peu\nsympathique aux plus jolis doigts du monde.\nDans la nuit meme, on lui fit dire que ses ruses etaieut decouvertes\net qu'il eut a quitter immediatement la France, avec I'ordre exprfes\nde n'y jamais rentrer.\nLe medium etait en proie a une violente attaque de nerfs. Les\nEsprits troubles, pretendait-il, se vengeaient sur lui. Mais, des qu'il\neut compris, il se calma et decampa.\nII s'embarqua pour I'Amerique et on ne le revit plus.\n\fJuly, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 277\nIt seemed to me very desirable to try at once to establish\nthe truth of so comparatively circumstantial a story, if truth\nthere were. I therefore wrote to Miss Johnson, who agreed and\nsuggested that I should communicate on the subject with M.\nSage, an Hon. Associate of the Society, 33, rue de Coulmiers,\nParis.\nI complied with this suggestion, and here wish to express\nto M. Sage my most cordial and best thanks for the very great\nhelp he has afforded me.\nThe first thing to do was, of course, to write to the authors\nof La Societe du Second Umpire, asking them on what authority\nthey made so categorical a statement. This I did. Count\nFleury has never replied, but M. Sonolet has sent me the two\nfollowing letters\n:\n56, EuE Notre Dame des Champs,\n[no date].\nMonsieur,\nVous m'avez demande sur quelles bases mon collaborateur\nle comte Fleury at moi nous etions appuyes pour raconter dans\nnotre ouvrage \" La Societe du Second Empire \" de quelle facon fut\ndemasque le medium Hume, un soir qu'il donnait une seance de\nspiritisme aux Tuileries [sic].\nLes sources dont nous avoiis tire ce recit sent surtout orales.\nMon collaborateur tient le recit de la scene de plusieurs temoins, soit\ndirectement, soit par I'entremise de son pere, le general comte Fleury,\ngrand-ecuyer et ami de Napoleon III, bote assidu des soirees des\nTuileries. C'est par lui que nous sont venus les noms du Baron\nMorio et du general de Genlis, etc.\nEn outre, nous avons consulte les memoires de Mme Carette et\nde Mile de Tascher, qui furent, de par leurs fonctions a la Cour,\nfamilieres des Tuileries.\nVeuillez agreer, etc.,\nLouis Sonolet.\n56, Rue Notre Dame des Champs,\n[no date].\nMonsieur,\nJ'ai re(('u de votre part la visite de Monsieur Sage qui s'est\nmontre fort aimable et avec qui j'ai eu grand plaisir a causer. Je\nn'ai fait aucune difficulte pour lui avouer que le comte Fleury et\nmoi ne pouvions fournir aucune preuve veritablement absolue de\nA 2\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.\nla fourberie du medium Hume dans I'afFaire de Biarritz. En effet,\ndeux seuls temoins ont vu ou cru voir la supercherie : ce sont\nM. Morio de I'lsle et le general Waubert de Genlis. Or, tons deux\nsont morts et nous ne pouvons plus avoir que des temoignages de\nseconde main.\nVeuillez agreer, etc.,\nLouis Sonolet.\nOn the other hand, M. Sage vs^ent to see Count Fleury, who\nv^^as also unable to give him any precise information, saying\nthat bis book \" vv^as not a work of science, but a work of\nvulgarisation\"; that he had heard the \"exposure\" talked\nabout in his family and in his \"milieu\"; that his father believed\nin it ; and referring M. Sage to memoirs of the time (see\nfurther on). An interview with M. Sonolet was equally barren\nof results. M. Sage wrote to me on December 11th, 1911:\nM. Sonolet ... a recueilli I'incident qui nous occupe de la\nbouche du Comte Fleury, mais il n'a jamais eu le moindre docu-\nment ecrit. II croit meme pouvoir affirmer qu'il n'en existe pas,\nd'imprime tout an moins. Et . . . il ajoute :\n\" Peut-etre existe-t-il\ndes lettres privees : il faudrait vous adresser aux families.\" \" Mon-\nsieur,\" lui ai-je repondu, \" il n'y avait pas de texte ecrit, vous en\navez ciee un et soyez sur que les historiens de I'avenir n'oublieront\npas de s'y referer. Plusieurs journalistes I'ont deja fait. . .\n.\"\nM. Sonolet n'a jamais In nuUe part que Home fut revenu en\n1864, et il convient que si tel etait le cas, cela infirmerait fort\nI'incident de Biarritz.\nCount Fleury having in his conversation with M. Sage also\nreferred him, among other memoirs, to those of Madame\nCarette, M. Sage went to see this lady. She said to him she\nknew the incident of the exposure very well, had heard it\nrelated by her friends, and had been very intimate with\nMadame Morio de I'lsle (apparently the widow of the \" Prefect\nof the Palace \"), who died three years ago. She was, however,\nunable to supply details, and advised M. Sage to look through\nher memoirs. This he did thoroughly, but found nothing of\ninterest. He therefore concludes that Mme Carette's memory\nis at fault. He also looked through the memoirs of Mile\nTascher de la Pagerie (to which Count Fleury had also\nreferred him) ; of Count Hilbner, Austrian Ambassador in\n\fJuly, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 279\nParis from 1851 till 1859; of the Duchesse de Dino ; but\ndid not find anything about the \" demasquage \" in any of them.\nOn the whole, therefore, it appeared that our little enquiry\nwas taking a turn rather favourable to Home's reputation. It\nseemed plain that the two author's of La SocUtd du Second\nEmiyirc had made a series of precise and categorical statements\nrather on hearsay than on any positive evidence ; and I was\nalready looking forward to framing my conclusions in some\nway such as that in the future the story of Home's alleged\nFrench exposure should be entirely ignored, unless some quite\nnew and satisfactory testimony were brought forward, when it\nturned out that hitherto unknown and contemporaneous refer-\nences to the incident were to be found in some letters of Dr.\nBarthez, physician to the Emperor Napoleon III., published in\nthe Bevuc dc Paris under the title of \" La famille Imperiale a\nSaint-Cloud et a Biarritz.\" Here are the passages which\ninterest us (1912, No. 1, pp. 80-84):\n5 se])temhre 1857.\nJ'ai vu M. Hume, ce fameux medium qui 6voque les esprits. J'etais\ntres curieux de le connaitre. Aussitofc que son arrivee a Biarritz a\nete sue, I'Imperatrice I'a envoye chercher et nous a cause de lui. La\ncroyance entiere qu'elle a en lui, ranimation, la violence avec lesquelles\nelle en parle m'ont fait de la peine. La evidemment est I'un des\ncotes faibles de cette femme, si remarquable d'ailleurs par ses qualites,\nphysiques, morales et intellectuelles.\nJ'ai compi'is de suite le cote dangereux de cette faiblesse et tout\nle parti que les ennemis de Leurs Majest6s peuvent tirer de cette\ncroyance en repandant I'opiuion qu'elles consultent les esprits et les\nrevenants pour la direction des affaires de I'Empire. Cette crainte\nest d'ailleurs celle de bien des personnes de la societe du chateau.\nTout cela m'avait done fort attriste et fort mal dispose au sujet de\nM. Hume. Aussi des qu'il entra, me deplut-il souverainement. Son\nair simple, timide, demi-gauche me parut cacher un savoir-faire tres\nhabile. Je voyais entre ses yeux et sa bouche une contradiction\nd'expression qui lui donnait uu air de faussete tres desagreable : en\nun mot sa figure appelait une paire de claques plutot que de\nI'enthousiasme ;\naussi, profitant de quelques paroles de Sa Majeste\nsur I'obstacle que la presence d'incredules met a Taction des gens de\nI'autre monde, je me suis retire sans rien dire, et n'ai pas assiste a\ncette soiree qui d'ailleurs n'eut rien de bien interessant.

July, 1912.\nI'ai bien vu, et bien examine et je suis reste convaincu que son air\ndemi-simple cache une leelle faussete. Cej^endant cette seconde\nimpression a ete moins mauvaise que la i^remiere.\nApres diner, on s'est mis en seance, et d'apres quelques paroles\nqui m'avaient ete dites, j'ai compris que je devais rester. Je me\nsuis done mis, avec tous, autour de la table, les mains dessus, et de\nsuite j'ai senti la table remuer et se tremousser ;\npuis on a frappe\nsous la table, repoudant a des coups par d'autres coups dictes evi-\ndemment par une intelligence; on a gratte, grataille a droite et a\ngauche, on a tire la robe de Sa Majeste ; on a enleve une sonnette\nde la main d'un monsieur qui etait a cote de moi pour la porter\nailleurs ; un accordeon maiuteuu par une seule main de M. Hume\na joue un air ravissant et tres juste ; tout cela se passait sous la\ntable ;\nmais, au bout d'un quart d'heure, tout s'est arrete, I'esprit a\nfait entendre qu'il voulait s'expliquer au moyen de coups frappes\nsous la table ; il a fait ecrire une phrase qui voulait dire que nous\netions trop nombreux ; il a designe les personnes dont il ne voulait\nplus la presence ;\nje me suis trouve du nombre, ce qu'expliquait\nnaturellement I'expression narquoisement inciedule que je sentais\nexister sur ma figure ; et je dus m'eu aller. J'ai su ce matin que le\nreste de la soiree n'avait rien presente de plus remarquable, sinon\nC[u'une table avait saute de ses quatre pieds.\nTu vas me demander ce que je pense de cela. Ces faits je les ai\nvus et entendus, ils sont vrais, comnie il est vrai que je sors de\ndejeuner ; ils sortent de la regie commune et de ce que je puis juger\npar les connaissances physiques que je possede : c'est-a-dire que je ne\npeux pas les expliquer. Mais de la a conclure qu'ils sont le produit\nd'un sortilege ;\nque des esprits, des revenants sortent de leurs tombeaux\n))0ur venir faire de telles farces sur une table, tu me permettras de te\ndire qu'il y a loin Entre ces faits et I'explication qu'on en donne,\nil y a un abime qu'il m'est absolument impossible de franchir quant\na present.

L'lmperatrice en\nest reduite a dire que le Hume d'aujourd'hui n'est plus le Hume\nd'autrefois, qu'il a perdu son pouvoir, et qu'il cherche a le reraplacer\npar des subterfuges. La chose est fort simple. M. Hume a des\nsouliers fins, faciles a oter et a remettre ; il a aussi, je crois, des bas\ncoupes qui laissent les doigts libres. Au moment voulu il ote un de\nses souliers, et avec son pied tire une robe par-ci, une robe par-la, fait\ntinter une sonnette, cogne d'un cote ou d'un autre, et la chose une\nfois faite remet prestement sa chaussure. Cela a ete vu par M. Morio\nqui en a fait une belle relation ecrite et signee avec tons les details\nnecessaires pour etablir I'authenticite de sa decouverte. Hume a vu\nqu'on devinait son aff'aire et il faisait, je t'assure, piteusc figure. II est\nsorti se disant malade, et, toute la nuit, il a eu des attaques de nerfs\net des visions, a ete entoure d'esprits.

She related two incidents that had occurred during\nHome's sittings\n:\n(1) In one of the salons of the Tuileries a heavy arm-chair\nhad begun to jump about by itself in the middle of the room\nwhen no one was near it ;\n(2) On another occasion Home raised himself in the air with\nthe chair he was sitting on, to about the height of a table,\nand the Empress sitting next to him touched the feet of the\nchair when it was in the air, and consequently felt sure that\nthere was no trickery.\nWith this letter I consider the enquiry to have been carried\nas far as it can be, and that it must now be regarded as\nclosed.\nNow let us briefly discuss the new evidence before us.\n\u2022\nI will first give M.

II donne\na entendre que I'lmperatrice \u2014 et peut-etre I'empereur \u2014 ne fut pas\nsi convaincue que cela du demasquage : ce fait expliquerait le retour\nde Home en 1863. Mais si Home \"s'expulsa\" de lui-meme, c'est\nque sa conscience n'etait peut-etre pas tres nette.\nf)\\ II faudrait trouver le \"beau rapport\" de M. Morio de I'lsle.\nMais oil le prendre, s'il existe encore? La publication des lettres\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.\ndu Dr. Barthez fera peut-etre sortir de I'ombre d'aiities documents^\nsi tant est qu'elles attirent quelque attention.\nIt certainly seems extremely probable that there was no\nexpulsion. Here are the reasons for it. Let us note, first,\nthat the date of September, 1857, assigned to the exposure\nby Dr. Barthez, is entirely in accordance with a passage of\nMme Home's Life, where she says (p. 99) that in September,\n1857, the French court was at Biarritz, and that an Imperial\ninvitation telegraphed to Home at Baden-Baden cut short his\nstay there. The agreement is even more complete, for a little\nfurther on Mme Home prints a letter signed \" Ch. Lavigerie,\npriest. Professor of the Faculty of Theology in Paris \" (pre-\nsumably identical with the future Cardinal and Archbishop of\nAlgiers), and dated September 24th (1857), whereas Dr.\nBarthez, as we have seen, speaks of the exposure and of\nHome's real or supposed illness on September 25th. Father\nLavigerie's above-mentioned letter begins as follows\n:\nSir\u2014I learn from the vicar of Biarritz that your health is in a\ncritical condition, and although I have not the honour of being\npersonally known to you, I nevertheless take the liberty of coming\nas priest to offer you the consolations of my office, etc.\nFrom which it undoubtedly follows that Mme Home's\nchronology appears to be quite sound in a particularly striking\nand interesting instance, and vfe are therefore, so it seems to\nme, entitled to give it credit in general. And accordingly we\nsee that from Biarritz Home went to Bordeaux {Life, p. 100),\nthen to Paris, then to the Chateau de Eambures, the resi-\ndence of the Marquis and Marquise de Fontenelles, then to\nParis again till the end of the year. In January, 1858,\nMme Home says. Home \" accepted a royal invitation to the\ncourt of Holland\" (p. 101). He then returned to Paris, and\nearly in 1858 left for Italy (pp. 105, 106).i\n1 Meanwhile \"Paris and the Paris journals,\" Mme. Home says, \"were lend-\ning ready credence to an infamous falsehood concerning him. He had been\narrested on\u2014the scandal-mongers knew not what charge\u2014and was in the\nprison of Mazas. \" Baron de Pontalba, one of Home's friends, wrote to him\nat Rome to apprise him of this calumny. (The Baron's letter is given in full\non p. 106 of the Life.) Home in the meantime had written from Rome to some\nof his friends in Paris, and one of them, M. Henri Delaage, \"a well-known\nauthor,\" showed the letter he had received to the Paris correspondent of Le\nNord, which newspaper contradicted the story of Home's imprisonment, and\nthereupon \"the spread of the Mazas slander was stopped\" (Life, p. 107).\n\fJuly, 1912. On the alleged Exposure of D. D. Home. 285\nI do not quite see where the expulsion could be located.\nIn any case, when Messrs. Fleury and Sonolet say (p. 186)\nthat after the Biarritz exposure Home \" s'embarqua pour\nI'Amerique et on ne le revit plus,\" they are completely mis-\ntaken. Home did not start for America\u2014at least, did not do so\nthen. But it is interesting to note that Madame Home speaks of\na journey he made to America in March, 1857,\u2014i.e. before the\n\"exposure\"-^ {The gift of D. D. Home, p. 199 and elsewhere)\nto bring to France a young sister whom the Empress had\noffered to take under her protection and educate at her expense.\nThis Miss Christine Home, Madame Home says, was placed in\nthe Sacre Co3ur convent {Life, p. 83). I have tried to verify\nthe fact independently, but have been unable to do so.\nWe see further that, whatever the \" exposure \" may have been.\nHome came back to France and had intercourse with the Court\ncircles and the Imperial couple, and also gave sittings, several times\nin the course of later years. In spite of Messrs. Sonolet and\nFleury's assertion that after 1858 \" he was seen no more,\" we find\nhim in France, not only that very year, in May {Life, p. 109), after\na visit to Eome where he had become engaged (pp. 107-108 )>\nbut again in the autumn of 1859 (p. 118). In the interval\nhe had gone to Eussia, where (in St. Petersburg) he had married\nMile Kroll, sister of Count Koucheleff-Besborodko (p. 115).\nOn that occasion he received a wedding-gift from the Emperor,\nAlexander II., to whom he had given seances. Among the\nKussians of distinction whose acquaintance he then made was\nthe celebrated poet Count Alexis Tolstoy (then A.D.C. to the\nEmperor). Their friendship was of long duration and is a well-\nknown fact. Then we find Home in France again in July,\n1860 {Life, p. I7l : at the Chateau de Cergay, near Paris); in\nSeptember, 1860, at Biarritz (p. 174); in February, 1862, \"in\nthe South of France\" (p. 193), where the first Mrs. Home\ndied; in 1863 in Paris (p. 199), where, the second Mrs. Home\nsays, he holds seances at the Tuileries in obedience to a sum-\nmons from the Empress. Be this as it may, he sends Her\nMajesty in March of the same year a copy of his work,\nIncidents in my Life, and receives a letter of thanks\u2014given in\nfull\u2014from the Empress's secretary (p. 199, see above). In\nNovember, 1863, Home went to Eome only to be expelled a\n^ He sailed for America a second time in 1864 [Life, p. 232).\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.\nfew weeks later by order of the Papal Government. (Was not\nthis undoubted fact, which was discussed in the British House\nof Commons, the origin of the later rumour as to his expul-\nsion from France?) In April, 1864, Mrs. Home says, he was\nagain in Paris giving seances at the Tuileries (p. 209). Mrs.\nHome quotes a letter he then received from ISTubar Pasha, the\nfamous Egyptian statesman, who was also in Paris at the time.\nShe says more sittings were given at the Tuileries during\nHome's stay of three weeks in Paris in the summer of 1865\n(p. 239). (See on same page two letters sent to Home by\nPrincess Caroline Murat by command of the Empress Eugenie\nin July, 1864, and June, 1865 \u2014the latter making mention of\nHome's sister\u2014from which it undoubtedly follows that he was\nthen continuing to enjoy the Imperial favour.) All this tends to\nshow that the Empress's present favourable opinion is no isolated\nfact suddenly springing up into existence after the lapse of\nmany years, but seems to be, so far as one can judge, in\naccordance with Her Majesty's past attitude.\nThese circumstances undoubtedly show that in any case there\nare in the \" exposure \" story features almost certainly belonging\nto the domain of legend ; also that this \" exposure \" can hardly\nhave been of an utterly crushing nature.\nStill, there was undoubtedly something in it. And much as\nI disapprove of the inaccuracies to be found in the narrative\ngiven in La SocUU du Second Empire, and of the slip-shod\nway in which its authors have approached a serious subject, I\nfeel compelled to admit that the general accordance of Messrs.\nFleury and Sonolet's account with that of Dr. Barthez seems\nto call for reflection. It does not appear that the latter's\nletter (which at any rate was published only several months\nafter the appearance of the first work) supplied them with the\ninformation about the Biarritz episode. (Note in this connec-\ntion the absence of General W. de Genlis's name from the\nBarthez account.) The coincidence is therefore the more\nremarkable.\nAnother feature to be borne in mind is that the character\nof the trickery attributed to D. D. Home appears to tally so\nwell with the suspicions which enter one's mind when reading\ndescriptions of some of his performances. From the days of\nmy early youth, when I was still something of the enthusiastic\n\fJuly, 1912. On the alleged Exjwsure of D. D. Home. 287\nneophyte, it had always seemed to me that action by Home's\nfeet was often not a very improbable hypothesis, though, T\nadmit, ludicrously inadequate as a general explanation. I there-\nfore used to look for detailed descriptions of the way in which\nHome's lower extremities were controlled, but generally found\nnothing.^ Even such observers as Sir William Crookes were,\nas a rule, very reticent on this subject. And now we find\nthat it is precisely his feet which the sceptics incriminate as\nfar back as 1857, at the very height of his \"powers.\" Surely\na painful coincidence\n!\nIt might also be urged that\u2014as everyday evidence in\ngeneral and in the domain of \" Modern Spiritualism \" in\nparticular abundantly shows\u2014people will often cling to a\ncherished delusion through thick and thin and will refuse to\ngive it up in the face of overwhelming proof; and that from\nthis point of view too much importance should not be attached\nto persistence in the belief in Home's mediumship\u2014whether\nimmediately after the Biarritz incident or half a century later.\nApparent contradictions in this respect might also perhaps be\npointed out, tending to show that, in particular cases, as years\n' Let tlie reader consider, for instance, the following passage from one of\nAksakofFs works (\nThe Precursorf; of Spiritism [in Russian], p. 485, foot-note) :\n\" Sometimes at Home's seances (Home's hands being upon the table and a candle\nburning) I would hold under the table some object : a pencil, a bell or a\nhandkerchief and would feel how something began to touch, to take and to\npull it : if I let it go it would not fall down ; I once put my hand under\nthe table with a ring on one finger in order that it should be taken away, as\nI hoped thus to know the operating agency better ; all at once tender but firm\nfingers began to work, trying to take off the ring ; in so doing they naturally\nand unavoidably touched my hand, and I was fully convinced these were\nliving, warm, thin, human fingers. \" Professor Boutleroff who witnessed similar\nincidents mentions, it is true, that Home's feet \"were dressed in bottines,\nwere controlled and did not move\"; but M'e are not told whether this \"con-\ntrol\" was uninterrupted, what it consisted of and whetlier the \" bottines\" were\nnot of such a kind that they could be slipped off' and put on again without\ndifficulty. In his \" Notes of Seances with D. D. Home \" (S.P.R. Proc, Vol. VI.,\np. 123) Sir W. Crookes describes a case of \"direct writing\" also under the\ntable, which he calls \"as striking a manifestation as I have ever seen.\" In\nthis case again no mention whatsoever is made of Home's feet\u2014just as in the\npassage of Aksakoff's above quoted. All these omissions are very unfortunate.\nI am very well aware, of course, that against such passages many others could\nbe adduced where action of the feet was absolutely out of the question ;\nbut this is no decisive objection. And an out-and-out sceptic might naturally\nretort that \" il faut toujours avoir deux cordes [if not more] a son arc.\"\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.\nrolled by, impressions produced at the moment were obliterated,\nand ultimately evaporated and left no trace in later attitudes.\nThis I am not prepared to dispute.\nOn the other hand, impartiality compels us to note that\nour chief witness on the negative side was undoubtedly strongly\nprejudiced against Home, as he himself admits; that such may\nhave been the case with others ;\nthat, apart from this, ignorance\nconcerning the supposed \" phenomena,\" their conditions, and their\ncharacter seems to have been universal in France at the time.\nFinally, it does not seem certain, in spite of Mme Pouquet's\nassertion, \" il en avait etc lui-meme temoin,\" that Dr. Barthez\nwas present at the decisive seance ; so that our evidence may\nbe only second-hand on one hand and possibly third-hand on\nthe other.\nI will therefore thus sum up my conclusions\n:\n(1) The famous legend as to the French exposure of Home\nhas at last been \" hunted down.\" It resolves itself into a real\nincident which happened in the course of Home's sittings at\nBiarritz airmt Septemlcr '30th, 1857, and which, there is good\nreason to believe, consisted of an attempt at trickery on\nHome's part. Contrary to one version of the legend, it had\nnothing to do with the person of the Empress.\n(2) The sort of trickery used was precisely of a kind sug-\ngested to an attentive reader by a certain category of Home's\nperformances.\n(3) The evidence for the alleged exposure, though impressive,,\ncannot, however, be considered altogether satisfactory.\n(4) Home's connections with his regular clientele all over\nEurope and with the French Imperial couple in particular\nwere not, so far as one can judge, affected\n\u2014\nat least ^jer-\nmancntly\u2014by the incident in question.\n(5) There is no foundation for the rumour that Home was\nexpelled from France in consequence.\nOn the whole, a fairly good instance, I think, of the partial\ntruth of the saying: \" \/\/ ruy a ^?\u00ab.s cle fumic sans fev..\"\n\fJULT, 1912. Case. 289\nCASE.\nL. 1190. Collective Apparition.\nWe have received the following case from Professor Macneile\nDixon, of Glasgow University, a member of the S.P.E. It is a\ncase of two patients (men) in a London hospital seeing the matron\nin their ward at a time when she was asleep in bed. The\npatients have been lost sight of. The accounts we have are\nfrom the nurses to whom they mentioned the experience\nimmediately after it occurred. These accounts are fully signed,\nbut we are requested not to print the names.\nNurse C writes :\nJune 10, 1912.\nI am a nurse in a London hospital, and one morning early in\nMarch, 1912\u20141 do not remember the exact date, but it was at the\nbeginning of the coal strike\u2014a patient said to me Matron was in\nthe ward about 1 o'clock this morning. I said I had not seen\nher, and the patient said, \"No; you were in the next ward at the\ntime.\" I then told the nurse in the adjoining ward that Matron had\nbeen in the ward during the night. When the night sister made\nher last round she was told that Matron had been in the ward about\n1 a.m., but she said she knew that was not the case, for she had\nseen her in bed at 12.30. I then told the patient that he was mistaken,\nas Matron had not been in the ward, and it must have been some\none else; but he persisted that he had seen her, and described her\ndress and cap, and said she had come in at the door and looked at\nthe fire and gone out again; and he appealed to the other men in\nthe ward to know if they had seen her, and one man said Yes, he\nhad been awake, and saw her when she turned to leave the ward.\n(Signed) F C .\nThe night sister referred to writes\n:\nJune 10, 1912.\nI am the night sister in a London hospital, and one night the\nMatron rang her bell, and asked me to bring her a cup of tea as\nshe could not sleep. She said the coal strike had given her so\nmuch to think about, and she had been making arrangements all\nday and planning how coal could be saved. I brought her the tea\nat 12.30 a.m., and she told me next morning that she had fallen\nasleep almost immediately afterwards, and I then told her that two\nof the patients had seen her in a ward at 1 a.m.\n(Signed) E S\n{Niffht Sister).\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.\nMrs. Sidgwick paid a visit to the Hospital in order to collect\nall the available evidence, and writes as follows :\nJnlij 1, 1912.\nI have just been to call on the matron of Hospital, Miss\nA , about the supposed apparition of herself to two patients\nin a ward of the hospital. What had interested her in the\ncase was the coincidence of her being seen coming into the ward\nand looking at the fire at a time when the necessity of saving coal\nseemed to be great, and when therefore the hospital fires were\nvery much on her mind. But she said the incident had not\nstruck her as important till she spoke of it to Professor Dixon.\nIt was, I gathered, at his request that she wrote out the account\nof what Nurse C and the night sister told her, and they\nsigned the accounts. The patients have been entirely lost sight of\nand could nut now be traced.\nI saw the ward, which is a small one with only nine beds\u2014\na\nmen's ward. The fireplace is at one end, and the door by which\nshe was seen to enter is near the other end of one of the side\nwalls. The beds are ranged with their heads against the wall, as\nusual in hospitals, and on both sides of the room. The men who\nthought they saw the matron were one on one side of the room and\nthe other on the other, and their beds were both rather near the\nfire. The room is lighted at night by an electric light with a green\nglass shade, which is drawn down near the table so that the light\nmay be shaded from the patients' eyes.\nI saw Nurse C . She is very different in appearance from\nthe matron, but what is more important is that their caps are\nextremely different, and it was by the cap that the patient identified\nthe matron. Her cap is made of a large sc^uare of cambric or other\nwhite material pinned on in folds, so that it hangs like a v eil\nbehind, a considerable way down the back. The nurse's cap has\nnothing hanging down at all ; it is fastened at the back of the\nhead, where the hair starts from the neck, by a little bow without\nany ends. Their dresses are both of a bluish grey colour, but the\nnurse's is very much covered by a white apron. I am told that the\nnight sister's dress is dark navy blue, and looks almost black at\nnight. No one in the hospital wears a cap in the least like the\nmatron's. It is diflncult, therefore, to suppose a case of mistaken\nidentity.\nIt was when she was washing the patient in the morning that he\ntold Nurse C that the matron had been in and looked at the\n\fJuly, 1912. Case. 291\nfire in the night. She was not surprised, because they had been\ntold to be economical of coal, and she supposed the matron might have\nbeen round to see if her instructions had been carried out. It was\nonly when she learnt from the night sister that the latter had seen\nthe matron in bed at 12.30 that she realised the patient must have\nbeen mistaken.\nI do not think it is possible now to make sure that the second\npatient's testimonj- was really independent\u2014given, I mean, before\nthe men had talked over the matter among themselves.\nMiss A is not aware of her phantasm having appeared\nto any one on any other occasion. She has herself on more\nthan one occasion had what seemed to be telepathic or otherwise\nsupernormal experiences. On the day of her apparition in the\nhospital she had been very much occupied with the question of\ncoal supply and coal saving. In thinking over the whole question,\nthe small wards, in one of which she appeared, had been the subject\nof thought, and she had decided that in any case the fires must be\nkept up there ; but she cannot say whether she had thought of\nthese wards in that connexion on this particular day.\nEleanor Mildred Sidc4\\vick.\nCOINCIDENCES IN PSEUDO-SCEIPTS.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nIn a paper printed in the Journal for December, 1911, Miss\nVerrall gave an account of a series of imitation scripts produced\nfor experimental purposes by six friends of hers, with a view\nto seeing how the coincidences that might occur between them\ncompared with the cross-correspondences found in genuine scripts.\nTo this paper was appended a note saying that one of the six\nexperimenters, the writer C, after reading all the scripts, had\nsuggested that some of the coincidences detected might possibly\nbe due, not to chance, but to telepathy from her. Owing to this\nidea of C.'s, we asked any readers of the Jowrnal who could\nfind in the scripts phrases that seemed specially appropriate to\nthemselves to let us know what these were and in what their\nappropriateness consisted. For it was clear that if the scripts\nfitted the circumstances of several different persons equally well,\nthe probability in any one case that this appropriateness was\nmerely accidental would be greatly increased.\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.\nIn view of the great variety of topics and general dis-\ncursiveness of the scripts, it seemed not at all unlikely that\nmany other people could find in them some coincidences with\ntheir own circumstances, and we received several communications\ndescribing such. There was nothing, however, at all remark-\nable in any of their coincidences, nor anything to suggest\nthat they were not due to chance.\nIt will be remembered that Miss Verrall had found among\nher pseudo-scripts five coincidences of topic which seemed to her\nworth noting. Only one of our correspondents included any of\nthese topics in his list of coincidences, but he included two of\nthem, viz. Hell\u2014not, however, as in the pseudo-scripts, in\nconjunction with the idea of Virgilian hexameters\u2014and Moon-\nlight. He wrote as follows :\nI find a few things in the scripts that are more or less in touch\nwith my circamstances :\n\u2014 ^ ^\n(A 4) Dislike of the barking of dogs.\n(A 4, A 5, B 3) Mention of Hell.

The sun's track on the sea. . . .\nHere, as Miss Verrall pointed out, there is a composite\ncoincidence : {a) two writers, C. and E., on the same day begin\ntheir scripts with a sentence containing the word \" Moonlight \";\n{h) E.'s first sentence provides an answer to the question with\nwhich a third writer, D., ends her script on April 13th:\n\"What does moonlight do to people?\" and so aftords a\nsimulation of design, such as we have claimed for the cross-\ncorrespondences.\nIt is to be noted that in three out of the five cases where\n\" Moon \" or \" Moonlight \" is mentioned, the word occurs in the\nopening sentence of the script, which, according to the plan just\ndescribed, was chosen by the writer from two pages opened at\nrandom in a selected book and used as a starting-place for the\nwriting. There is thus a large element of chance and a small\nelement of deliberate choice in the selection of the first sentence\nof each pseudo-script. It is in this respect entirely unlike the\nsucceeding sentences, and, on account of the limitation of pos-\n.sibilities, obviously much less likely to be telepathically inspired.\nIf we consider further the frequency of references to the Moon\nin poetry and the great likelihood that, if any one opened\non a page and found the word Moonlight in a sentence, he\n\f294 Jour7ial of Society for Psychical Research. July, 5912.\nwould choose that sentence on account of the large number of\nassociations with the word ;\nalso that the coincidence between\nE. and C.'s scripts merely consists in their having chosen\non the same day two different sentences from different poets,\nboth containing the word \" moonlight,\" it will be clear that\nthere is no sufficient reason so far for supposing that this\ncoincidence was produced by anything but chance.\nThere remains the odd fact that E.'s first sentence affords\nan answer to the last sentence of D.'s script three weeks\nearlier, as in a cross-correspondence a sentence in one\nscript may fit into a sentence in another. In the case of\nE. and D., however, there is absolutely nothing else to link the\ntwo scripts together besides the appropriateness of the answer\nto the question ; there is no coincidence of date and no personal\napplication is suggested in either of them to the other.\nBut, as already said, the writer C, on reading the proofs of Miss\nVerrall's paper on November l7th, 1911, was struck by what\nappeared to her odd coincidences between certain expressions in\nthe scripts and her occupations and thoughts at the time. C.'s\noccupations are chiefiy of a literary kind ; she is a person of\nwide reading and possesses, I think, an unusual degree of\nsensibility to literary excellences. It chanced that in July,\n1911, she had written for her own use a series of rough notes\nabout subjects in which she had been specially interested\nduring the preceding three months. She brought me the whole\nseries of these original notes. C. has been greatly interested\nin the work done by the S.P.R. during the last few years, and\nin its bearings on philosophy and religion, the question of\npersonal survival, etc., and these topics were conspicuous in\nher notes. Special reference is also made in them to certain\npassages of poetry (not quoted in the pseudo-scripts) which\ncontain references to the moon.\n\/ No doubt, as C. observed in her notes written in July, 1911,\n\" references to the moon are common enough in poetry and else-\nwhere \" ; but she took special pleasure in these, because she had\nchosen to represent the Moon to herself as a symbol of some-\nthing else in which she was strongly interested. The reasons\nfor and the appropriateness of this symbolism were explained\nfully in the notes and in her subsequent conversation with\nme, but they are so much mixed up with other personal\n\fJuly, 1912. Coincidences in PsevAo-Scri'pts. 295\nmatters that it is impossible to state them here.^ I can only\nsay that the Moon, through these literary associations and the\nsymbolism that it had pleased her fancy to attach to it, had\nundoubtedly been a frequent and conspicuous topic in C.'s\nmind during April, May and June, 1911.\nNevertheless, it seems to me very doubtful whether C.'s\nliterary preoccupations had any telepathic influence on the\nscripts ; there is no suggestion in them of any connection with\nher ; and the fact of her being one of the six writers is the\nsole reason for supposing that she more than any one else\nshould be telepathically concerned in the matter. On the\nwhole it seems probable that the correspondence between her\nthoughts and the scripts in regard to the topic of the Moon\nwas only another coincidence, due to chance alone.\nShe has since then tried experiments in thouglit-transference\nwith the writer E., but there has been so far no definite evidence\nof telepathy between them.\nStill, it is perhaps worth noting that in regard to the one\ncoincidence between the pseudo-scripts which Miss Verrall\n\u2014\nin ignorance of C.'s circumstances\u2014picked out as most closely\nsimulating a cross-correspondence, it should turn out that there\nis possibly some slight evidence of telepathic agency.\nThe main distinction, I think, between the coincidences\nin these pseudo-scripts and the cross-correspondences between\ngenuine scripts is that the subjects between which the coin-\ncidences occurred had no characteristics whatever to mark them\nout from the other subjects between which there was no coin-\ncidence. In those cross-correspondences to which we attach\nany value, there are always at least two factors of connection.\nFurther, as a general rule, either there is a definite statement\nthat a cross-correspondence on a particular topic is to be\nlooked for, or some special mark or signal is attached to the\ntopic in one or more scripts, suggesting that it is intended to\nform the subject of a cross-correspondence.\nNothing of this kind is to be found in the pseudo-scripts ;\nin no single case is it explicitly stated that a certain topic\n1 There were also a few other minor details in the scripts corresponding to\ntrivial events in C.'s life about this time; but these were of so ordinary a\nkind that they might have applied equally well to a good many other\npeople.\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1912.\nis to be looked for in another script, nor is there in any\ninstance any suggestion of such a thing. jSTo one who read\nthe pseudo-scripts could put his finger on a phrase or idea as\nthe one marked out by internal evidence to coincide with\nsomething in another script. The only topics which we should\nexpect prima facie to appear in more than one script are\nmatters of common and general interest at the time which it\nwould be natural for any one to think of, such as women's\nsuffrage, to which four out of the six writers refer. None of\nthe cross-correspondences in genuine scripts can be accounted\nfor by any such connection with contemporary events.\nApart from this slight preoccupation with public matters,\nall the topics in the pseudo-scripts seem to be equally\nimportant and equally prominent. The mind of the writer\ndwells on an idea for a longer or shorter time\u2014generally\nfor a very short time ;\nhe does not play round it and return\nto it and work it up with additional touches as an automatist\nso often does. To deal thus with an idea is of course by\nitself evidence of nothing more than subliminal activity. But\nit is just in relation to ideas marked out in this or in\nsome other way from an indifferent mass that, as a rule,\ncross-correspondences occur.\nThese facts strongly militate against the probability that the\ncross-correspondences may be due to chance alone. Never-\ntheless it is very important that we should test as far as\npossible what can be done by chance, and Miss Verrall is now\nengaged on a further series of experiments arranged on some-\nwhat similar lines to her first series, but varied in such a\nway that everything but chance in the production of such\ncoincidences as may occur would seem to be absolutely\nexcluded.\n'\nISSUE OF PROCEEDINGS.\nPart LXV. of the Proceedings, which should have been ready\nto appear this month, has been unavoidably delayed ; but it is\nhoped that it will be published in August.\n\fNo. CCXCII.\u2014Vol. XV. .

Oct., 1912.\nSOME CASES OF THE EEMOVAL OF PAIN AND\nINDUCTION OF SLEEP BY NON - HYPNOTIC\nSUGGESTION.\nBy the Eev. M. A. Bayfield. ^\nI HAVE tlie honour to bring before you three cases in which,\nto my great surprise, I have been successful, as it would appear,\nin banishing pain and inducing natural sleep by mere suggestion\nwithout the use of hypnotism. Indeed, of hypnotism I have\nno practical experience whatever, having never attempted or\neven witnessed any hypnotic experiment.\nThe cases are all quite recent, and represent my first efforts\nin this direction. After embarking on these cases I made\nattempts in three others : of these attempts one was a failure,\nand the other two were inconclusive. In two of these last\nthree cases, however, only a single experiment was made.\n(1) The first case is that of a widow of 84, who still has the\nuse of all her faculties. She may be called Mrs. Bennett.\nShe is a deeply religious woman, and absolutely sincere and\ntruthful. As you will see, she is suggestible to an extra-\nordinary degree. I visited her last June year (1911), when\nshe was beginning to get over an attack of bronchitis, and\nfound her in bed, very weak and, as she said, unable to sleep\nproperly. She seemed to be breaking up, and I thought\u2014as\ndid those about her\u2014that she could not last long ; in fact, a\nfew days after this I left orders that if there were any change\nfor the worse I was to be summoned at once at any hour of\nthe day or night\u2014so serious did her condition seem to be.\nWhile we talked her face was suddenly drawn with pain, and\nwhen I asked her where the pain was, she indicated the right\nlumbar region, saying that some pain there was constant, and\nthat she had several severe spasms each day. It afterwards\nappeared that she had some renal trouble, not, however, of a\nserious nature. When she told me of the pain T said some-\nthing to this effect :\n\u2014\" Well, we must drive it away. It has\nbeen discovered that your inmost self has extraordinary power\nover the body, and can tell the pain to go. We will talk to\nthis inmost self, and then I think you'll have no pain. Do\nyou believe me ?\n\" She is very trustful, and she answered,\n^\nThis paper was read at a meeting of the Society on July 8th, 1912.\n\fOct., 1912. Removal of Pain hy Non-Hypnotic Suggestion. 299\n\" Yes, I do.\" I then placed my hand under her back, on the\nseat of the pain, and repeated over and over again very solemnly\nand with strong concentration of thought and will for perhaps\ntwo minutes, \" This pain is to go away, and not come back\nfor weeks.\" The phrase was sometimes varied slightly, but the\nmeaning was always the same. When I stopped she said with\ngreat delight that the pain was quite gone. It was then\n3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I said, \" Now you are to go to\nsleep. Arrange yourself comfortably, and shut your eyes.\" She\ndid this, and I repeated for some two minutes, \" Go to sleep,\nand wake for your tea at 6 o'clock, and sleep well to-night.\nSleep, sleep, sleep.\" In about half a minute her fingers began to\ntwitch, and I think she was asleep in about a minute. I then left\nher, and told her people downstairs that she was not to be dis-\nturbed, and would wake at 6 o'clock. She woke at five minutes\nto 6.0, and slept well through most of the night. In about a\nfortnight she had recovered from the bronchitis, and though still\nweak was downstairs. During this fortnight she was several\ntimes sent to sleep in the daytime by suggestion, and the in-\njunction to sleep well at night was repeated at every visit,\ni.e. every three or four days. She continued to have good\nnights, and the lumbar pain did not return for three weeks.\nSoon after she came downstairs, however, she complained of\nanother pain which (as she said) gave her much discomfort,\nand made her feel wretched\u2014a pain which, judging from its\nposition, was no doubt caused by indigestion. I said, \" Oh,\nthat's a small matter ; we've sent away the first pain, and\nwe'll send off this one too.\" I laid my hand on the front\npart of her apron-band, and the injunction this time took the\nform :\n\u2014\" This pain is to go, and not come back at all ; and\nyou are to digest your food properly.\" In about half a minute\nthe pain was completely gone, and her relief was evident from\nher manner. As a reminder to the subliminal self, she also\nnow began to wear a tape tied round the waist next the skin.\nHow long she wore it I do not know, but I do not recall that\nshe mentioned to me further serious pain from indigestion until\nthree weeks ago.\nAbout three weeks from the first-mentioned visit the lumbar\npain returned ; as before, she had the same constant dull pain\nwith occasional spasms. It was banished in the same manner\nas at first, but I abstained from mentioning any definite period\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.\nfor its exile. She had now perfect confidence in the treat-\nment, and after the success of the previous experiments it\nseemed undesirable to risk any failure even in a point of\ndetail. Moreover, being as much a novice in the matter as\nmy patient, I had no idea how long the effects of such sugges-\ntion might be expected to last. The pain did, in fact, return\nat the end of a week, but was again immediately dismissed,\nand, I think, told to be gone altogether.\nHitherto I had made no attempt to explain the modus\noperandi to the patient, beyond the statement about the inmost\nself already mentioned. But I now remembered that an\nobstinate ancestor, who would insist on proclaiming what he\nbelieved to be the truth, had been burned at the stake at\nSmithfield, and it seemed about time to put matters, so far\nas might be, on a scientific basis, lest I myself be burned on\nthe village green, if only in effigy, as a witch and dabbler in\nblack arts. This fear, I may say in parenthesis, was not alto-\ngether groundless ; for though the patients have blessed me\nand the villagers take it all quietly, and are far from imagining\nthat the Prince of Darkness has any finger in the business,\nthere are others whose attitude recalls the days of Matthew\nHopkins and Co., and also King Knut's little adventure with\nthe incoming tide.\nHowever\u2014to get back to my story\u2014I now gave to Mrs.\nBennett such an explanation as she could receive of the sub-\nliminal self (avoiding, of course, the word \" subliminal \"), and\nthe same explanation was subsequently given to the other two\npatients. It was shockingly imperfect, but it appears to have\nbeen adequate. At the same time I impressed upon them that\nthe beneficial results of such suggestion were as much God's\ndoing as if He had healed them with His own immediate\ntouch.\nAbout this time I went away for my holidays. Before\nleaving I gave Mrs. Bennett a paper on which were written\nthese words, \" You are to sleep through the night every night,\nand you are to feel no pain. Jesus the great Healer knows,\nand He will help you.\" This I told her to read every night\nwhen she went to bed. She not only obeyed the instruction\nbut improved upon it ; for she made it a habit to go to sleep\nwith the paper in her hand, and, I believe, does so still. The\nlast sentence on the paper took strong possession of her, and\n\fOct., 1912. Removal of Pain hy Non-Hypnotic Suggestion. 301\nher frequent subsequent references to it make it certain that\nfrom that time she has been relying on immediate Divine\nhelp no less than on the suggestion treatment. Only three\ndays ago she told me that when the pain in her back came\nshe now uttered a prayer, and the pain at once departed\n;\nand she added, \" It is because I have faith.\" It was necessary\nto mention this, because it is a fact in the case, and may seem\nto introduce a complication into the operative causes. I must\nforbear to discuss the point now, and will only observe that,\nto my own mind, the complication is rather apparent than\nreal.\nOn my return in the middle of September I found Mrs.\nB. extraordinarily well, though hot weather does not suit\nher ; she seemed to have taken a new lease of life. She had\nslept well, and been free from pain. This happy condition\ncontinued for the rest of the year. She had occasional returns\nof the lumbar pain, which suggestion was always able to remove\nat once. Indeed, my mere presence seemed to produce some\nbeneficial physical change ; she said more than once that the\nsight of me at the door made her feel stronger and \" as light\nas a feather.\" In January she caught a rather bad cold in\nthe head, which pulled her down a good deal, and my note of\nJan. 20\u2014when I had not seen her for more than a week,\nprobably having had a cold myself\u2014states that she appeared\nmuch weaker than I had ever known her ; her face was thin\nand worn, and the wrinkles were much deeper and very notice-\nable. She was lethargic and deeply depressed, and seemed to\nbe more certainly breaking up than in the previous June. I\nthink she must have been suffering pain, though there is no\nrecord of it, for my note says that orders were given that she\nwas to continue always sleeping well and to feel no pain. On\nthe 22nd\u2014two days after\u2014there was a positively amazing\nchange. She was looking ten years younger ; her face was\nfilled out to plumpness, and she was extraordinarily lively and\ntalkative, and oddly excited at her improved condition, which\ndominated all her thoughts. On Jan. 26\u2014four days later\n\u2014\nshe had fallen back to a more normal condition, and had a\nnew pain near one of the shoulder blades. This was imme-\ndiately relieved. She was continuing to sleep well.\nOn Feb. 7\u2014twelve days later (T had, of course, seen her\nin the interval, for my practice was to visit her at least twice\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.\na week)\u2014she was still having good nights and looking well.\nAt this visit she had a swelling on the upper part of the\nabdomen, about the level of the hip on the right side. It\nwas plainly to be felt through her clothes, and appeared to\nbe about the size of a duck's egg. She had had it for over\na week, and it was attended by a dull pain\u2014due, as I supposed,\nto the renal trouble. I laid my hand on the swelling, and for\nabout a minute, or a minute and a half, repeated a sentence\nto the effect that both pain and swelling were to disappear.\nThe pain departed at once, and the swelling had disappeared\nby mid-day next day, and neither pain nor swelling have\nreappeared. I left her after repeating the injunction to sleep\nwell.\nOn Feb. 13 she had a cold, but was otherwise well and free\nfrom pain. She said, however, that though warmly clothed she\nfelt cold in the middle of the back, as though cold water\nwere trickling over it. I laid my hand on the place, and\nsaid it was to feel warm. In about two minutes she said it\nwas warm, and that she felt the warmth tingling through to\nthe front of her body, indicating a spot about the level of\nthe heart.\nThree weeks later, on March 7, she was suffering, and had\nbeen for two or three days, from the original lumbar pain.\nIt was banished in about two minutes.\nThe history of the case in the interval between this date\nand June 18, during which I saw her at least once a week,\nhas no special features. Occasional pains in the lumbar region\n\u2014never acute\u2014and pains from indigestion were successfully\ntreated. As is, I suppose, natural, considering her age, her\ngeneral strength varied a good deal from time to time.\nOn June 18 she was lying on the sofa, as she had been\ndoing for two or three days, and was very weak. The hand-\ngrip was feeble, and she was dull and listless, and disinclined\nto talk. For several days she had been suffering severely from\nindigestion, and the stomach was much and quite conspicuously\nswollen. She told me she could not make her gown or petti-\ncoats meet at the waist. There was considerable pain, and\nthe body was so tender that she could not bear the slightest\npressure. I laid my hand lightly on the waist-band of her\napron, and both pain and swelling were bidden to disappear\n;\nthat same night there was no trace left of either. Six days\n\fOct., 1912. Removal of Pain by Non-Hyimotic Suggestion. 303\nafter I found her very well, alert, talkative, and she had\nresumed her habit of strolling in and out of her neighbour's\ncottage. She looked much better, and the hand-grip was un-\nusually strong.\nThis brings the case up to date, and only one remark need\nbe added. Since pain is nature's alarm-bell, there must be\ncases in which to banish the pain without removing the cause\nwould possibly be unwise and even dangerous. In this case\nthe indigestion was banished as well as the pain. With regard\nto the renal trouble, I more than once begged her earnestly to\nlet me summon her doctor, but she persistently refused.\n(2) The next case can be told very briefly. It is that of\na widow of 93, whom we will call Mrs. Barton. She is of a\nlively, whimsical temperament ; her intelligence is still alert,\nand she has full use of all her senses. Towards the end of\nJanuary of this year she had a fall and hurt her shoulder,\nand naturally was put to bed. When I saw her on Jan. 29\nshe was very weak, and, considering her age, seemed little\nlikely to get up again, though, as her doctor tells me, she was\ncertainly in no immediate danger. There was no definite malady,\nbut she was\u2014as she put it\n\u2014\"full of aches and pains all over\";\nshe could not lie comfortably even on her feather bed, and\ncould not sleep. At night her mind wandered, and she would\nwake from her broken slumbers and cry out. A continuance\nof this lack of sleep could, of course, only end in one way.\nHer daughter, Mrs. C, lived in the adjoining cottage, but\nnow slept in a second bed in her mother's room. I said\nMrs. Barton was to have no aches and pains, but feel com-\nfortable in bed and sleep well through every night. Two days\nlater I found she had slept well, and was quite comfortable\nand had less pain. The change in her condition at night was\nso great that her daughter told me she was wondering whether\nshe need continue to sleep with her mother, and in answer to\nrepeated questions she assured me that she could not doubt\nthat this sudden and remarkable improvement\u2014dating, as it\ndid, from my visit\u2014was due to the suggestion treatment. The\nsuggestions were repeated at this visit. After this date I\nvisited her about once a week, repeating the suggestions on\neach occasion. The improvement continued steadily, and all\nher pains had disappeared a fortnight or so after the first\nsuggestion, and she took to calling me her doctor. After\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.\nremaining in bed about four months, she is now walking\nabout and sitting out of doors. She, too, seems to have taken\na new lease of life.\n(3) The third case is that of an old man of 85, who has\nnow passed away, and who was suffering from senile gangrene\nin the left foot. It will perhaps be best to begin the account\nof it by reading a brief rSsitmS of the case, which has been\nkindly furnished to me by Mr. Gurth Eager, who attended him.\nIt runs as follows :\n\u2014\n\" Resume of Case of Senile Gangrene : William Reed, aet. 85.\nHertford,\nJime, 1912.\nPatient first seen early in Jan., 1912, with acutely sj^reading\nmoist gangrene involving big toe. When seen on Jan. 28 the\ngangrene had spread to dorsum and heel. Pain during this period\nhad been acute, patient crying out and having no sleep, \u2014odour\nvery offensive. Relief obtained only by fairly large and repeated\ndoses of Liq. Opii Sed. (opium), sufficient to place him deeply under\nits influence. Since Jan. 26 practically no pain, very good nights,\ngangrene spreading with uniform rapidity. By March 1, whole foot\ninvolved, but still no pain, patient sitting on bedside and smoking,\nwith foot resting on the ground. Sleeping very well. Gradually\ngot weaker, and died on May 12. The pain during whole illness\nwas very marked, except for the opium, until Jan. 26, after which\ndate the drug was stopped, the patient complaining of no pain,\nexcept on two occasions, from thence till death. It was undoubtedly\na case where pain was a marked symptom until Mr. Bayfield saw\nhim for the first time on Jan. 26, when the patient passed into\ncomparative comfort and remained in that condition to the end.\nIt is my conscientious opinion that the relief of pain was due to\nMr. Bayfield's influence, which, I should like to point out, was exer-\ncised for 10 weeks. From the condition of the patient I do not\nconsider it possible for the sudden cessation of pain to have been\ndue to his toxaemic state.\n(Signed) Gurth Eager.\"\nI should explain that the last sentence means that the\nwound was septic, but the poisoning of the blood, though it was\nthe cause of the excessive pain (unusual in such cases), was not\nso severe as to account for a cessation of it.\nEeed was an intelligent man, of strong character, and before\nthis illness given to being overbearing and impatient. On Jan.\n26 I heard in the morning that he was ill, and went to see\nhim in the afternoon. Before I got to the cottage no thought\n\fOct., 1912. Removal of Pain by Non-Hypnotic Suggestiov . 305\nof employing suggestion in so serious a case entered my mind,\nbut when he told me that he suffered, both in the foot and the\nleg as far as the hip, acute pains which drove him to distrac-\ntion, and that the doctor had been compelled to give him\nopium, I obeyed a sudden impulse to make an experiment. It\nseemed such a horrible thing that this poor old man should\nhave to spend the few months of life that remained to him\nwith no alternative but either to suffer a long-drawn agony or\nbe continually stupefied by a drug. I told him I had driven\naway Mrs. Bennett's pains, and that if he would believe in the\nmethod\u2014of which I gave him a brief explanation\u2014probably\nhis pains also would disappear. I then laid my hand on the\nshin of the affected leg, and said, he muttering the words after\nme, \" You are to feel no pain in foot or leg, and you are to\nsleep well through every night. The gangrene is to get better\n;\nit is not to spread.\" This last order I suspected to be folly\nwhile I uttered it, but was not quite sure. Anyhow, the order\nseemed likely to stimulate the old man's interest, and so it was\ngiven. The same day I wrote to Mr. Eager^\n\u2014with whom I\nwas not then acquainted\u2014and asked if I might talk to him about\nthe case. He kindly called on the 28th, having visited Eeed\nand examined his foot that same morning, and we discussed\nthe matter. Mr. Eager is much interested in hypnotic and\nsuggestion treatment\u2014though he practises neither\u2014and after\nexplaining the nature of the disease, which is such that cure\nor arrest is impossible, he encouraged me to go on with the\nattempt to remove the pain and induce sleep.\nOn the 29th\u2014the third day after the first experiment\u2014\nI\nvisited Eeed, and learned that he had slept well and had had\nno pain since the 26th. The treatment was renewed every two\nor three days. On Feb. 7 \u2014twelve days after the first experi-\nment\u2014the leg was still free from pain, and he felt \" nothing\nto call pain \" (as he put it) in the foot. He was also sleeping\nwell through the night. Up to the 2 6 th his nights had been\nvery restless, and the change from that date was so marked\nthat both he and his niece, Mrs. D., a woman of mature years,\nwho was nursing him, had no hesitation in ascribing it to the\nnew treatment. He solemnly blessed me for it.\nHe was at this time in the habit of getting up every day,\nso that it was with some surprise that I found him in bed\nat noon on Feb. 13. He had slept well till the previous night,\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.\nwhen he had been very restless, though not from pain. He\nhad for the last two days suffered an intolerable thirst, and\nMrs. D. was giving him oranges and barley water to assuage\nit. The usual orders were repeated, with the addition that\ntlie thirst was to disappear. All the orders were obeyed, the\nthirst disappearing in a few hours. He felt drowsy at tea-\ntime, and went to bed and slept well and quietly through the\nwhole night, with one brief interval of waking. When seen\nnext day he was much livelier than usual.\nA frequent renewal of the suggestions seemed to be neces-\nsary in this case. On March 4 (owing partly to absence from\nhome and partly to a severe cold, which seemed to preclude\ncycling a mile in heavy rain) I had not seen him for five days,\nwhen a message reached me saying he was in great pain. I\nwent immediately, and found he had been very restless on the\ntwo previous nights, suffering much pain both in foot and leg.\nHe appeared lethargic and weaker. The usual orders were\nrepeated, with the result (to quote Mrs. D.) that he slept\nthrough the night \" like a baby.\" The poor woman, who was\nherself almost worn out with her own need of sleep, expressed\nherself as amazed at the suddenness of the change. There was\nno return of pain, but the second night after this he slept\nonly fairly, being troubled by the foot feeling hot. He looked\nworn and older, and the face was thinner, sallow, and much\npuckered with wrinkles. He was told to go to sleep every\nnight at 10 o'clock, and the foot was bidden to keep cool. That\nnight he went to sleep punctually at 10 o'clock, and though some-\nwhat restless, slept satisfactorily ; the foot was without pain, or\neven discomfort. On the third day, a Saturday, he was looking\nextraordinarily well ; the face was rosy and plump, with all the\nnew wrinkles smoothed out. He had slept all night from\n10.30 on the Thursday, and most of the day on Friday, so\nthat it was not surprising that he did not sleep through the\nFriday night, during which he woke several times and smoked\na pipe. There had been no pain, but some discomfort in the\nheel.\nIt is unnecessary to trouble you with further details. With\nthe exception of one attack, he continued without pain to the\nend, and that attack\u2014like the former one\u2014coincided with\nanother interval when, being confined to the house with a\nsevere cold, I had not seen him for about a week. The\n\fOct., 1912. Removal of Pain by N'on-Hyjmotie Suggestion. 307\nsuggestions were renewed with success. He gradually became\nweaker and weaker, and the pulse\u2014owing, as I understand, to\nthe increasing potency of the poison in the blood\u2014rose to over\n100. Four attempts were made on ditfei'ent days to lower the\npulse by suggestion, but they were unsuccessful. Perhaps they\nwere bound to be. He was conscious almost to the end, and\ncould hear and understand me when I prayed, but for the last\nweek or so his will power seemed too feeble to allow suggestion\nto be effective, and no suggestions were made. He passed\naway peacefully on May 12, eleven weeks after the first\nexperiment, having been free from pain all the time, e.xcept\non the two occasions mentioned, when no suggestion had been\nmade for about a week. This period of tranquil respite he\nmade use of\u2014effective use, as I believe\u2014to prepare himself for\nhis passing, which he knew could not be long delayed. A\nneighbour tells me that they had reason to believe that the\nstrange success of the new treatment had counted for much in\nthe change which came over his character during the illness.\nAfter these experiences, it seems impossible to resist the\nconclusion that the operating cause in the banishment of pain\nand induction of sleep in each case was, in fact, the simple\nnon-hypnotic suggestion treatment employed\u2014the suggestions\nbeing followed on several occasions, as you will remember,\neither immediately or almost immediately by the appropriate\nresult. I have no reason to suppose that I have any hypnotic\npower whatever, and since that power is in some cases appar-\nently unnecessary for the relief of pain, it would follow that\nsimilar success might be expected to attend the efforts of\nalmost any one in whom the patient had confidence. Prophets,\nas we know, are as a rule without prestige in their own house-\nhold, and domestic experiments in the family circle might be\ndisappointing, but\u2014to say nothing of medical men, who (as\nthose of them present will testify) are employing the method\nin steadily increasing numbers\u2014a wide field is certainly opened\nfor the parish priest. In the country, at any rate, he would\nprobably be able to find the time necessary for the frequent\nvisits which the parish doctor could hardly be expected to\nmake for such a purpose. And the clergy surely need have\nno scruple in regarding such services as part of their work, if\nthey will only recall how much time and interest was expended\nin the healing of bodily disease by their Divine Master.\n\f308 Journal of Society for PsycJdml Research.

After two suggestions\non successive days she continued to sleep properly without\nsuggestion.\nTHE CASE OF EDITH BALLAED.\nOf the following case of a sudden cure of functional disorders,\nsensational accounts appeared in the newspapers at the time.\nWe print it here because the psychological factors leading to\nthe cure wei'e manifested in an unusually definite form, which\nprobably added to their healing efficacy. The case may be\ncompared with one recorded by Mr. Fryer in the Journal (Vol.\nXII., pp. 184-188) where a somewhat similar hallucination\nhad a healing effect on the patient.\nThe following account was received from Mr. Charles Hiogs,\nwho wrote to us on behalf of the Eev. H. Kilner Woodward,\nof Gillingham, Kent\n:\nBatchelor Farm, Gillingham Green,\nGillingham, Kent, Nov. 10 [1911 J.\nI desire to bring to your notice a case which will doubtless be\nof interest to you and your Society. The subject, Edith Ballard,\nage about twenty-five, of 52 King Edward Road, Gillingham, has\nfor the last five years been a completely bedridden invalid, suffering\nfrom spinal complaint, asthma and fits. A few days ago she\ndeclares that while she slept she saw a vision, or rather a very\nbright light, and heard a voice saying, \" Arise and walk.\" She\nwas then informed that she should have various manifestations as\na reward for her unflinching faith during her hours of pain. She\nwas told that during five days she should walk at certain periods,\nviz. 6.0, 9.0 a.m. and p.m. This she has done, the last manifes-\ntation being at 9.0 p.m. yesterday. She is now to have rest for\nfive days, after which there are to be further manifestations. The\nfollowing [account of the manifestations] may be interesting. About\ntwo minutes before the given time she puts down whatever she\nmay have in her hands, and prepares herself Her shoulders then\nbegin to twitch, and later she raises her back from the bed perfectly\n\fOct., 1912. The Case of Edith Ballard. 309\nstiff to the hips. Her e)'es roll upwards, and she raises her right\nhand above her head. In this position she gets out of bed and\nwalks three times round it. When she has done this, she crosses\nher hands on her breast, bows slightlj' and returns to bed. While\nshe is in this state she is quite unconscious. As soon as she recovers\nfrom these trances she is quite exhausted and her limbs rigid. I\ndo not know whether the coming manifestations are of the same\nor a different order. In any case it would seem to be just such an\nevent as would claim your attention, and admission to the house is\nperfectly easy. In fact the room has been crowded at the various\nmanifestations, and it is becoming a topic of local talk. The ultimate\nresult is to be, so she declares, her complete cure.\nCharlks Higgs.\nThe period, of rest mentioned in this letter lasted until\nNovember 15, 1911. On iSTovember 21, 1911, Mr. Higgs\nwrote to us to say that the manifestations were again taking\nplace, and on November 23 Miss Verrall went to Gillingham\nto see Edith Ballard and to make further enquiries.\nMiss Verrall's report is as follows\n:\nNuremher 21, 1911.\nOn Thursday, Nov. 23, 1911, I went down to Gillingham. I\nwent to Mr. Woodward's house, and he told me what lie knew of\nEdith Ballard. He had had no personal knowledge of her except\nduring the last ^^ear or two. During that time he had visited her\nregularly. Last summer her health had become worse : so much so\nthat he had hardly expected to find her alive after his summer\nholiday. She hardly ever spoke, and lay in bed quite still and\nrigid.\nAbout 3 o'clock in the afternoon I went with Mr. Woodward\nto Mrs. Ballard's house.\nEdith Ballard read out to me the following statement (supple-\nmented by answers to a few questions I put) ; the statement had\nbeen written by herself.\nOn Thursday night (Nov. 2, 1911), she said, she saw a light\nand heard a voice. (I could not make out clearly from her account\nwhether she was asleep or awake at the time. She spoke of being\nasleep, but objected to the word '\ndream ' in connection with her\nexperience.) The voice said: \"To-morrow is Friday, and you will\npass through a fire, and when you have lain here five years you will\narise from this bed, for your time is not yet.\"\nOn Friday (Nov. 3, 1911) she lay 'in a fit' for twenty hours.\nOn Sunday, Nov. 5, 1911, she was awakened at about 5.45 by a voice\nwhich said to her :\n\" Edie, you have borne your sufferings with\ngreat patience ; and through the temptations and weariness which\nyou have passed you have kept faitli. Now I want you at the\nsixth hour to walk round this bed three times, also at the ninth\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.\nhour in the morning, and the same at night, and I will guide you\nwith my eye. Do this for five days, and one day will count for\none year, and when the five days are passed those will be the five\nyears that you have lain here. The day after you will pass\nthrough another fire, and you will be healed, for your time is\nnot yet.\"\nA few minutes after this, at 6 o'clock, she saw a bright\nlight like a moon above her head. The light spread and came\ndownwards until it reached the ground on either side of her. She\nthen felt as though she were lifted out of the bed and her hand\nwere drawn up above her head and clasped by another hand. After\nthat she was not conscious of anything more until she found herself\nagain on the bed.\nMrs. Ballard told me that she was in the room on Sunday\nmorning at 6 o'clock, and was astonished and terrified to see\nher daughter get suddenly out of bed and walk. She thought that\n\" her time was come,\" and followed her round the bed, ready to\ncatch her if she dropped. The girl walked round the bed three\ntimes and then got into bed again. She took no notice of her\nmother whilst she was walking. After returning to bed, she told\nher of the 'vision.'\nIn accordance with what the voice had told her, Edith Ballard\nwalked at the appointed hours for five days (Sunday, Nov. 5 to\nThursday, Nov. 9). After the last manifestation (9 p.m. on Thurs-\nday) she received an intimation (again by a voice, as I understood)\nthat she should walk once more, because there were several people\noutside who had not been able to see her. The people were brought\nin, and she walked again.\nOn Friday morning, Nov. 10, she also walked twice; after the\nsecond time she went into a fit which lasted nine hours. During\nFriday night she heard the voice again, telling her to remain in\nbed for a few days and then to walk for fifteen days more. She\nbegan walking again on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 1911 ; the fifteen\ndays will be up on Nov. 29, 1911. After that she says that she\nhas been told she will be able to walk whenever she pleases. She\ndeclares that now she can only walk at the stated times. I noticed\nduring my interview with her that she several times moved her\nlegs under the bedclothes.\nAt a few minutes before 6 p.m. I went to the house again. We\nwere shown into Edith Ballard's room, in which a considerable\nnumber of people were assembled. At 6 o'clock she folded her\nhands across her breast and raised her eyes as though looking at\nsomething above her and to her left. She then raised herself up\nin bed. I was struck by the complete absence of effort with which\nshe appeared to do this. She was rigid from the waist upwards,\nand her arms being folded, she could not use tbem in any way.\nHer legs remained stretched straight out. When she had got into\na sitting position, she pulled her legs up out of the bedclothes and\nstood by the side of the bed, then she raised her right hand above\nher head as though holding something ; her left hand was pressed\nagainst her left hip. She walked round the foot of the bed and\n\fOct., 1912. The Case of Edith Ballard. 311\nback again three times. The space between the bed and the people\nstanding round was verj' narrow, but she never hesitated or struck\nagainst anything, although her eyes were all the time turned\nupwards and, so far as I could see, Cjuite fixad. When she reached\nthe side of the bed after the third perambulation she dropped her\nright arm along her side and her head drooped forward. She then\nlay down on the bed, stretched straight out, and crossed her hands\non her breast again. Her mother drew up the bedclothes over her.\nShe then blinked her eyes and returned to a normal condition. I\nhad no opportunity of testing her own statement that she was\nunconscious during the walking.\nH. DE G. Verrall.\nIn the following March we were able to obtain a report\nof the case from a medical point of view by the doctor who\nhas attended Edith Ballard for the last three years. At his\nown request his name, which was given to us, is withheld.\nHe wrote :\nMarch Utli, 1912.\nThis case, which has aroused considerable interest lately, has\nbeen under my care for a little over three years ; I now have much\npleasure in giving a short account of her life histor}', and also my\nopinion as to the nature of her ailment, and its progress up to the\npresent time.\nMiss Ballard was born 24 years ago last August 1st, and during\nher infancy was, her mother informs me, subject to fits. Her\nmother describes them as not convulsions, but very slight fits, which\nonly lasted for a brief period of time ; she has always suffered from\ntorticollis, the right sterno-mastoid muscle being very rigid and\ncontracted. As a child she was never strong, always weakly and\ndelicate, and never able to attend school regularly, being continuallj',\nher mother informs me, having to be excused from attendance\nby her medical adviser. At about the age of 17 years she developed\nsevere pain in the side ; she describes it as very severe, and in\nthe ovarian (right) region ; she then developed what was considered\nto be pleuris)^ and symptoms of pulmonar}' tuberculosis. For this\nshe lived out of doors as much as possible, until, about the age of\n19 years, severe vomiting and obstinate constipation set in which\ncompelled her to take to her bed. This weakened her to such a\nconsiderable extent that she was unable to get up, and it was after\nremaining in bed for about two years, when she would be about\n21 years old, that they applied to the parish for relief, and I was\ncalled in to treat her, and have been in attendance ever since.\nHer condition, when I first saw her, was one of extreme debility,\nintense ansemia, great wasting, and practically no use in her lower\nlimbs. This went on getting v\/orse and worse in spite of all treat-\nment, and when she was about 22, or a little over two years ago,\nsevere convulsive seizures set in, accompanied at times with violent\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1912.\ntremors. These would last sometimes for hours together, and were\nvery painful to witness, the body and limbs being twisted in all\nsorts of curious positions. Her lower limbs would become very rigid,\nand her mother had to pad the insides of her knees to prevent the\nskin being rubbed off; the slightest touch of her hand, even feeling\nher pulse, would at times set up these violent tremblings ; the\nconstipation and flatulent dyspepsia were also still great troubles\nwith her.\nThis state of things existed up to the time when, a few months\nago, she stated that she heard a voice telling her she was to get\nup and walk at the sixth and ninth hour, morning and evening ;\nthis she carried out to the letter, walking round the bed and then\ngetting back again, and relapsing in the intervals to her former\ncondition. This was to go on for five days. At the end of this\ntime the voice told her she would go through a fire (probably a\nfit, which she had), then she had to rest a few days longer, and\nwould then be cured, for the voice said her time was not yet.\nDuring these walking turns she stated that a light seemed to encircle\nher and a soft hand lifted her up and guided her round the room,\nwhich hand she says she knows was Jesus's hand. These periods,\nwhen she temporarily regained the use of her limbs, only took\nplace when the hand of the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to six\nand nine. (I suggested removing the clock, but this they would\nnot hear of.) It was a loudly ticking clock.\nThis all happened, I think it would be the end of last November,\nand since then she has been gradually improving. I saw her\nyesterday and she was greatly improved in appearance. She has\nwalked a mile or more at a time, and although quite unable to do\nheavy laborious work, is well able to do light work. She is picking\nup flesh, colour returning to her cheeks, and much brighter, the\nonly thing that troubles her now being constipation and accompany-\ning flatulent dyspepsia. I may say both her mother and herself are\nof an intensely religious temperament.\nTo sum up my opinion of the case, I should say undoubtedly it\nis one of functional or hysterical paralysis, cured by auto-suggestion\nor self-hypnotism. The voices and visions I look upon as halluci-\nnations conjured up in her own antemic brain. I may add, nothing\nwould induce the mother or daughter to allow any psychic influence\nto be used, as they thought that that would be distinctly interfering\nwith the Divine manifestations, and I had to use considerable per-\nsuasion before they would consent for Dr. Forbes Winslow to see\nher, who veiy kindlj' came down and saw her with me. The\noriginal pain in the side, vomiting, etc., I look upon as probably\nall being hysterical in their nature. The case is certainly of very\ngreat interest from a psychological point of view. I have never been\nable to detect any phthisis.\nThis case presents many points of comparison with that of\nDorothy Kerin, recorded in Dr. Edwin Ash's recent book.

The\nletter printed below explains the circumstances of the case, and\nwe have since learnt that the gift of the fund has been formally\naccepted by a vote of the President and Fellows of Harvard\nCollege at a meeting held in August, 1912.\nThis is the first time in our history that the work of the\nSociety can be said to have been formally recognised by a\nUniversity of the first rank, and the Council have determined\nto mark their sense of the occasion by a donation of five\nhundred dollars to the Fund.\nAny further contributions, from members of the Society or\nothers, will be gladly received, and should be sent to\nHenry James, Esq., Jr.,\n84 State Street,\nBoston, Mass., U.S.A.\n84 State St., Boston.

(Melbourne),\nM.A. (Cambridge), who was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1855,\nand who served as Secretary of the American Society for Psychical\nResearch and of the American Branch of the English Society for\nPsychical Research successively from 1887 until his death in Boston\nin 1905, devoting throughout those years a generous character and\nrare abilities to the investigation and study of i^henomena which\npurported to furnish evidence of human immortality.

Nothing herein shall be construed to\nrequire the expenditure of income annually.\nIt is the hope of the contributors, this statement of which shall\nnot limit or restrict the discretion of the President and Fellows,\nthat a preference will be given in the expenditure of income to the\nendowment of investigation and research as distinguished from\nlectureships, and that, unless and until the fund reaches such pro-\nportions that its income is sufficient to justify the permanent appoint-\nment of an instructor or investigator, the income will be accumulated\nfor such reasonable periods as shall be necessary to make possible\nits expenditure in amounts adequate for important uses.\nThe contributors, for whom I thus transmit the amount above-\nnamed, are the following :\nMrs. William G.

The real point is that, before Mrs.\nVerrall knew of any attempt being made in America at\ncommunication, .she, by certain signs given her through automatic\nwriting, assumed she had received a message which meant\nthat \" the seeing of a sphere effected a mysterious '\nco-reception '\n\"\nand that she \" associated this statement with a spear.\" There\nis direct evidence that this was in her mind : there is written\nrecord.\nIn America what was attempted to be communicated was\nevidently confusion between spear and sphere. The relation,\nevidentially, between the message received as interpreted by Mrs.\nVerrall and the message despatched is apparent. There was\nconfusion between spear and sphere in the message despatched\n;\n1 Proceedings, Part LXV. , p. 59.\n\fNov., 1912. Notes on \" Proceedings,\" Part LXV. 319\nthere was a '\nco-reception ' of spear and sphere in the message\nreceived.\nThere was coincidence. Was it undesigned ? (Cf. Personcdity\nand Telepcdhy, p. 204, where I consider the coincidence as,\nhumanly, necessarily undesigned.) The coincidence may have\nresulted from chance. But, if Dr. Maxwell so thinks, can he\ngive any like extraordinary undesigned coincidence ? The\ncoincidence is triple : spear, sphere and the confusion between\nthe two, spear and sphere.\nThe case proves nothing, is not offered as proving anything\n:\nthe strongest '\npsychical ' case cannot be offered as proof It\ncan only be offered as strong evidence towards proof.\nThe case in question is of value only in offering strong\nevidence. The improbability of '\nchance ' coincidence appears,\nto some of us, so strong that the probability of some abnormal\nmeans of communication is opened.\nII.\nAn Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question.-^\nCertain difficulties rise in my mind in reading Mr. Piddington's\npaper, and as these difliculties may probably have troubled\nothers I will state, as succinctly as possible, what they are.\nI detail, first, the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Piddington\nfrom the scripts in question.\nScripts 136, 171 and 178 {op. cit. p. 186). Mr. Piddington\nfinds a connecting link in these scripts in the word '\nGleam.'\nScripts 171, 176 and 178 {op. cit. p. 187). Mr. Piddington\nfinds that these scripts are also connected together, the link\nin this case being made by means of common allusions in all\nthree to the description of the Heavenly Jerusalem in the\n21st chapter of The Eevdation of St. Jolun the Divine.\nScripts 176, 178 and 180 {op. eit. p. 189). Mr. Piddington\nfinds a connexion between these scripts and a poem of Myers's\nentitled Venice.\nMr. Piddington then finds '\nThe object of the reference to\nVenice and the meaning of that Poem.' He finds what he\nhopes '\nwill seem to be not only a plausible but a convincing\nanswer.'\n'^Proceedings, Part LXV., pp. 174 et seq.\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.\nThis answer is that the suite of scripts in question refers\nto the Horace Ode.\nMr. Pidclington considers,\u2014by an evolutionary process,\n\u2014\nfour links between these scripts: (1) G-leani, (2) The Eevelation\nof St. John, (3) The Poem Venice, (4) The Horace Ode.\nNow I think I am correct in stating that by this process\nhe assumes to find evidence that Myers disembodied has been\nattempting to give us evidence of his continuing personality.\nMy difficulty, then, is this : The links exist because they\nhave been created by Myers himself: this applies to each\nindividual link. It is Myers himself who has chosen the\nform of these links.\nWhat is the form of these links ?\nEecondite symbolisms and disconnected signs which are\nincomprehensible to the vast majority of human beings and\nthe very existence of which would have remained unknown\nbut for the chance existence of a man of Mr. Piddington's\nherculean powers of labour and almost diabolical nimbleness\nof wit.\nIt appears to me that, when all the circumstances of the\ncase are fully considered, these links might, perhaps, be\nexplainable by '\nchance coincidence.' But let us admit they\nowe their existence to Myers. What follows ? They owe\ntheir existence to Myers as a continuing intclleetucd ^personality:\nthey result from intellectual operation. Is it not strange,\nthen, that a disembodied intellectual personality, full of desire\nto prove to us in the flesh that his personality still exists,\nshould deliberately choose so extraordinary a method of proof ?\nFor this method of proof\u2014unless we accept Mr. Piddiugton\nas a Dcm ex Machind\u2014appeals to humanity in general in no\nway. Those who have read, marked, learned and inwardly\ndigested Mr. Piddington's proof might possibly be counted on\none's iingers and toes. If the proof be accepted it is good\nand useful only for a very, very small number of human\nbeings. The lyrofamim vulgiis will never accept proof of life\nafter death on the intellectual deductions of a few.\nI make no attack on the study of cross-correspondences.\nBut there is danger of too close refinement : Dr. Maxwell is\nlaughing at us already. Eecondite symbolisms and far-fetched\nlikenesses between '\nsigns ' must be guarded against.\n\fNov., 1912. An Experiment in Interpretation. 321\nOne point more : suppose there were three Piddingtons, not\nmerely one, in the field ? And suppose Piddington II. set\nout to tind evidence in the script that '\nchance coincidences\n'\naccount for all the apparently abnormal links, while Piddington\nIII. set out to prove that telepathic communion between\nthe '\nsubliniinals ' of the agents explains all? Could they\nnot make out strong cases ? Mr. Piddington has confined his\nattention to the unearthing of evidence in support of Myers's\nintervention. Is it astonishing, when all the surroundins,'\ncircumstances are considered, that he finds some evidence ?\nHis own summing up of the case {op. cit. p. 210) is perhaps\nnot very conclusive.\nI AN EXPERIMENT IN INTERPEETATION.\nI\ni\nBy Alice Johnson.\nI A NUMBER of important and interesting questions are raised\nin Mr. Constable's comments on the \" Horace Ode \" case,\u2014too\nimportant and too numerous to be dealt with immediately in\nthe Journal, but which I hope may be discussed later. Mean-\nwhile it may be worth giving here an account of a specific\nexperiment made with a view to testing the validity of Mr.\nPiddington's methods of interpretation of the scripts.\nIn February, 1911, Mr. Bayfield, who has made a very\nthorough study of all the published reports on Cross-corre-\nspondences, sent me a copy of three imitation scripts, containing\nan imitation Cross-correspondence, composed by himself after\nthe style of the real scripts\n\u2014\ni.e. with many quotations derived\nfrom all sorts of sources, and apparently vague and allusive\nremarks susceptible of various interpretations. The subject of\nthe Cross-correspondence was Browning's Pied Piper of Hamiclin.\nThese sham scripts afterwards appeared in a review by Mr.\nBayfield of Mr. Podmore's last book, in ProccccUngs (Vol. XXV.,\npp. 85-87).\nJust before this, Mr. Andrew Lang had uttered some rather\nsevere criticisms of our reports\u2014in particular of Mr. Pidding-\nton's\u2014to the general effect that by such methods of interpre-\ntation any phrase might be taken to mean anything we liked.\nNow there is always this difficulty in regard to the real\nscripts, that\u2014from the nature of the case\u2014we cannot ask their\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.\nostensible authors whether the interpretation we have put on\nthem is correct. So, when I got Mr. Bayiield's sliam scripts,\nit occurred to me that here was an unusually good opportunity\nof testing Mr. Piddington's methods,\u2014since we slrould be able\nto say for certain whether they had or had not led him to\nthe right conclusions in this particular case.\nI therefore made copies of the three sham scripts, adding to\neach the name of an automatist, as if they had really been\nproduced by her, and sent them to Mr. Piddington, saying\n:\n\" I consider this rather an interesting cross-correspondence.\nSee if you can find the references to X. in it ;\nthey are not\nvery obvious. Ask Mr. Balfour if you can't find them, and\ntell me your results without mentioning them to any one else.\"\nIt must be explained that \" X.\" was a topic,\u2014which I do\nnot specify, because it has not yet been published,\u2014in which\nMr. Piddington and I were very much interested at that time,\nhaving found, as we thought, a good many references to it in\nthe scripts of several different automatists. It was a topic\nwhich had gone on for a considerable time and had many\ndifferent subdivisions and ramifications ; the supposed refer-\nences to it included passages from classical, medieval and modern\nauthors, and allusions to works of art, and to history and\ngeography ; in fact, the associations with different items of the\ntopic were so numerous and varied that one might have\nsupposed that almost anything could be interpreted as an\nallusion to it.\nI knew for certain that Mr. Bayfield could not have in-\ntended to introduce any allusion to the topic X. in his three\nscripts, because he was entirely ignorant of it. Therefore, if\nMr. Piddington had found any allusion to it, this would show\nthat there was sonrething wrong about his methods\u2014if, that is,\nthey had led to a conclusion which could be proved to be\nincorrect. But in order to test his methods as severely as\npossible, it was necessary that he should suppose the allusions\nwere there, so that he might make a serious effort to find\nthem.\nHe was completely taken in by my letter ; it never occuiTed\nto him that the scripts were not written by the automatists\nwhose names I had attached to them, and he worked hard to\nfind the allusions to X. in them.\n\fNov., 1912. An Experiment in Interpretation. 323\nAfter a few days he wrote to say that perhaps he might\nfind them if he knew the sources and context of all the quota-\ntions in the scripts ; so I sent him elaborate information on\nthese points.\nHe then noted two coincidences :\n(\u00ab) One of the sham scripts had the phrase\n:\n\"His eyes were green as leeks,\"\nwhereas a real script of Miss Verrall's containing\nallusions to the topic X had ^\n\" Tiger tv'er burnino' britrht\nGreen eyes in the darkness.\"\n(h) The initials of a person associated with one of the poems\nquoted more than once in the sham scripts were the\nsame as two of the initials of a person historically\nconnected with the X topic.\nBut he thought it would be absurd to attach any importance\nto coincidences so slight as these, and he found nothing that\nin his view could be counted as allusions to X.\nI wrote to him :\n\" Try once more and tell me your final\nconclusion, and I will then tell you my own view.\"\nHe struggled on, feeling\u2014as he afterwards told me\u2014a good\ndeal annoyed at the idea that my ingenuity in discovering the\nallusions to X. had so far exceeded his own ; but he found\nnothing more.\nAfter he had worked at it for 13 days, I told him the\nwhole story, and my reasons for making the experiment.\nI wish to add a few words on the ethics of this experi-\nment. I should think it quite unjustifiable to try such a\ntest with any one but a friend and fellow investigator, and one\nwho was not an automatist. In this case I was actually as\nmuch concerned as Mr. Piddington himself, for we had worked\ntogether on the same general lines and used the same general\nmethods of interpretation. I applied the test to him because\n\u2014\nknowing the facts\u2014I could not apply it to myself. But if\nhe had failed under it,\u2014if, that is, he had found allusions to X.\nwhere they did not exist,\u2014it would have been a severe blow\nto me as well as to him ; it would very seriously have shaken\nmy confidence in a great part of our results. Nevertheless,\nit seemed to me worth while to run the risk.\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.\nThe fact that Mr. Piddington did not find allusions to X. in\na place where there were none is not, of course, by itself\npositive proof that in other places where he had found them\nthey did actually exist. But the experiment, as far as it goes,\ndoes, I think, tend strongly to show that our methods are\nright ;\nnot, that is, that they are always and in every particular\nright, but that our general principles of interpretation of the\nscripts are in the main sound.\nCASE. ' \u2022\nP. 284. Impression.\nThe following case was sent to us by Mr. H. Arthur Smith, who\nis well acquainted with the ladies concerned\n:\nMiss Howard writes :\nDOBROYD, WeSTGATE AvENUE,\nBolton, Aiujust ifh [1912].\nOn the 29th of April of this year I visited a Mr. Gr., in the\nhope of getting into communication with an aunt who had died\nfour years ago.\nThe sitting was a private one, and took place in the afternoon.\nMr. G. described a spirit whom he perceived to be present, and\nseemed anxious to establish its identity with my aunt. He asked\nseveral questions, which I answered ; and he described her appear-\nance, and gave details of her last illness, generally quite correctly.\nHe then asked if I would like to hear her speak, and said quite\nsuddenly, without leading up to any such remark: \"She (meaning\nmy aunt) says, '\nOh, poor Lillie, but never mind, she'll soon get\nover it.' \" He asked me who \" Lillie \" was, and if she was ill.\n\" Lillie \" is another aunt, who was at that time on her way from\nSouth Africa to England, and from whom we had not heard for\nsome weeks. I knew she was due to arrive in England in ten\ndays' time, but no thought of her had been in my mind for some\ndays previous to this interview.\nThis remark about \"poor Lillie\" had no meaning whatever to\nme, until a fortnight later, when my Aunt Lillie landed in England,\nand I learned that on the 8tli of May, te)i days after my consulta-\ntion with Mr. G., she had had a fall on deck, which had shaken\nand bruised her severely, but from which she recovered with re-\nmarkable rapidity.\nMarian Howard.\n\fNov., 1912. Case. 325\nMiss Howard's sister writes\n:\nDoBROYD, Bolton, August Uh, 1912.\nIll a letter from my sister written on May 2nd, she recounted tu\nme her experiences at her interview with Mr. G. on May 1st. I\ncould make nothing of the remark about \"poor Lillie \" at the time,\nbut when I met my aunt at Southampton on the 10th, I was not\nsurprised to see the marks of bruises on her cheek and forehead,\nwhich were the results of her accident.\nAlice Howard.\nThe lady who met with the accident writes :\nAmblesidk, August 5fh, 1912.\nOn May 8tli of this year, on my voyage from Africa, I had a\nbad fall on the deck of the \" Braemar Castle,\" then on her way\nfrom Madeira to Southampton. I had had no communication with\nany one in England for some weeks previously, and no one in\nEngland knew of my accident until I landed there on May 10th.\nI recovered from the eflects of my fall with remarkable quickness,\nand have suffered no permanent bad results.\nLillie Egwe.\nOn its being pointed out to Miss Alice Howard that her\naccount differed from her sister's as to the date of the inter-\nview with Mr. G., she wrote on August 9th, 1912 :\nI made a mistake in saying that my sister's interview with Mr.\nG. took place on May 1st ; it was on the afternoon of Monday,\nApril 29th.\nWe enquired whether the original letter describing the inter-\nview had been preserved, but they were not able to find it.\nIn answer to other questions, Miss Marian Howard wrote :\nA^igust 22?wZ, 1912.\nIn relation to my interview with Mr. G., I can truly say that I\nhad not had Aunt Lillie in my mind at all that afternoon. She had\nnever been mentioned, and of course no questions had been asked\nabout her. At the moment when Mr. G. said the words \"Poor\nLillie,\" etc., he really appeared to be in a trance, and purported to\nbe seeing my (late) aunt. Miss Jane Rowe. After saying, ''She\n(Miss Eowe) says, 'Poor Lillie,'\" he turned to me and said, \"Is\nLillie ill 1\n\" I merely said \" No, she is not,\" and did not say she\nwas on the sea. It at once came to my mind that something had\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.\nhappened to her on the boat, and I thought, \" Now I shall wait\nand see what this means.\" I quite saw all through the interview\nthat I could easily help Mr. G. by any reaiark I might make or in\nan answer to a question, so I tried my best not to do so. I was\nfully aware that I might be taken in. . . .\nMarian Howard.\nTHE CASE OF EDITH BALLAED.\nTo complete the account of this case, which appeared in\nthe Journal for Oct. 1912, p. 308, we print the following letter,\naddressed to Miss Verrall, from the doctor whose report was\nthere given :\nOct. im, 1912.\nIn reply to your card of the 9th inst. I have recently been\nattending Miss Ballard's father for an injury. I called to see him\non Thursday last. He informed me his daughter was staying at\nNottingham for a fortnight in connection with some religious meet-\nings being held there. She has improved sufficiently to enable her\nto walk two Or three miles at a stretch, and ride a bicycle. She\nis quite able to perform ordinary light household duties, but quite\nincapable of doing hard work. I should say she has improved as\nmuch as she will, and, according to her mothei', she is now in just\nabout the same condition as she was previously to her illness, as\nshe has never been what you would call strong.\nCOERESPONDENCE.\n(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psyclncal Eesectrch.)\nGONVILLE AND CaIUS COLLEGE,\nCambridge, Sep. 24, 1912.\nIn Mrs. Verrall's paper entitled \"A Month's Record of Auto-\nmatisms\" (Pruc. S.P.I!. Vol. XXVI., p. 48) an account is given of a\nveridical statement concerning a comet. The search for a probable\nnormal source for the information given by the table of \" a meteoric\nsian in the east at dawn \" was in vain. I write to suarsrest that in\no 00\nall probability one of the automatists might have had access to the\npages of the Atheiucnm and have there found all the necessary\ninformation. In the column headed \"Science Gossip\" for June 22,\n\fNov., 1912. Correspondence. 327\n29, July 6, 13, 20, and Aug. 3, 1907, references to Daniel's comet\nwill be found. I quote two only :\nJuly 20 : The comet \" will probably become visible to the naked\neye earl}' next month.\"\nAug. 3 : The comet \" is now at its nearest to us . . . throughout\nnext week will be distinctly visible to the naked eye.\"\nThe number for Aug. 10th, which might possibly have been in\nthe hands of either automatist immediately before their sitting at\n9 p.m. on the 9th (the Athenceum reaches Cambridge on Friday),\nhas the following passage : The comet \" has been for some nights\nvisible to the naked eye moving in a nearly easterly direction and\nrising at Greenwich a little before midnight.\"\nIf any stress is to be laid on the interpretation of the \"meteoric\nsign \" of the script as being Daniel's comet, I think that all the\nnecessary information might have been accessible to the automatists\nthrough the Jtlieiueum.\nHowever, a more natural interpretation seems to me to be that\nthe meteoric sign refers to the well-known shov\/er of Perseid meteors\nwhich comes on the nights Aug. 10, 11. The well-known lines,\n\" In August t\\vo stars sliine through heaven\nOn nights between nine and eleven,\"\nmust surely have been heard at some time or other by one of the\nautomatists. Here, again, the Athenceum of Aug. 3, 1907, supplies a\nhint :\n\" The Perseid meteors will be most conspicuous abot;t the end\nof next week,\" and probably other refeiences to the meteor shower\nappeared in the daily papers.\nThis suggested interpretation would explain naturally the date\non which the meteoric reference emerged in the script, and would\nremove any reason to search for any supernormal source.\nF. J. M. Stratton.\nThe enquiry suggested by Mr. Stratton having been put to\nthe two automatists concerned in the case, they reply as\nfollows :\n\u2014\nIt is of course impossible for us at this distance of time to assert\npositively that we had not in August, 1907, read anj' notes about\nthe comet in the Athenceum. All that can be said is that :\n\u2014\n(1) There was no copy of the Aihencemn at 5 Selwyn Gardens,\nCambridge, where the table tilting took place.\n(2) Neither of us was in the habit of reading the Athenceum, or\nof frequenting libraries or clubs where it might be found.\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1912.\n(3) The allusion to the \"meteoric sign\" did not revive in either\nof our minds the smallest recollection of anything we had\nrecently read or heard about. M'^e both know vaguely that\nAugust is a good month for meteors, but we are not\nconsciously acquainted with the verses which Mr. Stratton\nquotes.\nJoan Riviere.\nH. DE G. Verrall.\nWithout insistino- too much on the evidential value of this\ncase (which must, of course, be judged only as one of the\nseries described in Mrs. Verrall's paper), it may be worth\nadding that the phrase \" meteoric sign \" should perhaps be\ninterpreted in accordance with the literary and classical pro-\nclivities of the automatists rather than with scientific associa-\ntions with which they would be less familiar, and from Mrs.\nVerrall's report there seems no doubt that the phrase \" meteoric\nsign,\" combined with the Latin phrases tilted out at the same\ntime, suyuested to all of them a comet and not meteors. Also\n\" a meteoric sign in the east at dawn \" was more appropriate\nto the comet than to the Perseid meteors seen \" on nights\nbetween nine and eleven.\"\nOBITUARY.\nJOHN R. HOLLOND.\nWe regret to announce the loss by death of one of our Vice-\nPresidents, Mr. John R. Hollond. Mr. Hollond, who has been\na Vice-President since 1882, was one of those whose interest\nin psychical research was aroused\u2014indirectly, if not directly\n\u2014\nby Sir William Crookes's investigations in the early seventies.\nEven before our Society was founded he took an active part\nin the experiments of some of those who were most largely\nconcerned in starting it, and he was one of its earliest\nmembers. He continued afterwards to give valuable assistance\nto our work in various ways, and in particular by allowing\nseances to be held at his house. Unfortunately for many\nyears past all active co-operation in psychical research has\nbeen prevented by the increasing ill-health which terminated\nfatally on October 19 th last.\n\fNo. CCXCIV.\u2014Vol. XV. .\n\" December, 1912.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research,\nCONTENTS.\nPAGE\nThe Divining Rod in Germany.

Barrett brought the C[uestioa of\nthe diviniiin; rod as far back as 1897 and 1900 to a remarkable\npoint of evidence, it was generally regarded in Germany as a\nridiculous superstition for several years later than this. We\nowe it to the late Government official, v. Biilow-Bothkamp, that\nthe attention of all Germany was drawn to this matter in the\nwell-known weekly scientific publication Pronicilicus, in December,\n1902, the interest in which has not waned since, but rather\nincreased. Numerous more or less objective debates in one\ntechnical paper after the other followed the first publication\nand succeeded in interesting many scientists in the phenomenon.\nFor instance. Privy Councillor George Franzius, formerly Director\nof the ' Kiel Dockyard, became an enthusiastic adherent of the\ndowsing rod, and he it was who first suggested sending the well-\nO ' CO o\nknown dowser, Mr. v. Uslar, to German South-West Africa for\nthe purpose of finding water. After the fiood of bitter con-\ntroversy had ebbed considerably in 1907, the battle which had\nup to then been undecided, received a new impetus through\nthe intervention of the Munich physician. Dr. Eduard Aigner,\nthe Secretary of the Monistic Association, and especially known\nas an antagonist of the so-called healing miracles of Lourdes.\nSince then (1909) the literature of the divining rod has grown\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.\nimmensely,^ and at the present time\u2014with the exception of\nProf. Dr. L. Weber in Kiel, its old adversary\u2014the Geological\nInstitute of Surveyors of Berlin and the Berlin well-sinkers\nare almost the only ones who still oppose it.\nThe most important event in the recent history of the\ndowsing wand is the foundation of the Verhand zur Kldrung\ndcr Wiinschdrutenfrage. In Autumn, 1911, Privy Councillor\nFranzius had invited a number of gentlemen interested in\nthis question in order to bring them by discussion into more\nintimate touch with each other. Simultaneous experiments were\nundertaken in the mines of Hanover under the control of ex-\nperienced mining officials. The results of these experiments\nwere so convincing that the participators formed themselves\ninto a Society, with Professor Dr.-Ing. Eobert Weyrauch at its\nhead. The Society has now more than 350 members, of all\nnationalities, and has shown its scientific tendency and testified\nits efficiency in the three pamphlets already published.\" Two\nothers are shortly going to press. In the first number the\npoints of view are formulated which give the tendency of the\nSociety's work, and which will probably be of interest to\nthe members of the S.P.R., although we on the Continent regard\nthe problem as from a physico-physiological rather than from a\npsychological standpoint. The introductory lines of the pamphlet\nare as follows : ii.\nThe want of any essential clues to the working of the powers\nwhich influence the dowser has, up to the present, led to great\nincertitude in judging of successes, which can be alone removed by\nsystematic investigation and undoubted statistics. But the water-\nfinders themselves often need guidance, so that they may learn clarity\nof vision free from self-deception, as to their sensations, and thus them-\nselves help towards the elucidation of the question.\n1 See my Bihiioi\/ruphie der Wiiriachelrute, Miinchen (0.

The Divining Rod in Germany. 331\nIn order to bring lucidity and system into the explanations of the\nphenomena, which have hitherto been tried from the most contra-\ndictory points of view, the members in the above-mentioned congress\nunited themselves in founding the Society. The following gentlemen\nform the working committee : Dr. med. Ed. Aigner (Munich), Dr. F.\nBehme, Judge of the Common Court (Hanover), Privy Councillor G.\nFranzius (Kiel), and Prof. Dr.-Ing. E. Weyrauch (Stuttgart). The\nlast-named gentleman, Professor of Hydraulics at the Technical\nUniversity of Stuttgart, accepted the presidency. All enquiries and\nsubscriptions should be sent to him.\nThe yearly subscription is 5 marks until further notice (which\nwill be increased for 191.3). Each member will receive a copy of each\npublication. The chief aims of the Society may be defined as follows :\n1. The material collected by the dowsers and other observers is to\nbe submitted to the Central Committee for the necessary controb\nfor undertaking testing experiments and for publishing the same.\nFurther, an Archive will be established in order to make as com-\nplete a collection as possible of the literature on the subject. We\nmay hope in time by these means to approach more nearly the\nexplanation of the problem.\n2. The Society will endeavour to clear up the much discussed\nquestion without bias. The members' subscriptions and other voluntary\ncontributions will serve to defray the costs of publication and necessary\nexpenses (correspondence, literature, etc.) incurred by the central office.\n3. Apart from these purely business objects the Society hopes to\nawaken the interest of scientists for the divining rod, to encourage\ninterchange of news, in order to fathom the still mysterious powers\nin the phenomena of the dowsing rod which influence the human\norganism, and gradually to find to which laws of nature these\nphenomena may be referred.\nThe experiments hitherto undertaken seem to imply that the\nhuman organism, given the individual inchnation, possesses the\ncapability of reacting on conditions such as appear to exist in the\nvicinity of water-currents or certain objects organised chemically and\nphysically in a special manner. There is nothing improbable in\nthe fact that this inclination, as it is revealed in the motion of the\nrod, should find expression in such a special manner. It is therefore\nnecessary to trace the physical and physiological processes entirely\nwithout prejudice, not to find any reason for adopting a sceptical\nattitude in the inexpHcability hitherto of the observed phenomena,\nbut to try to gain wider circles for the ideal and material support\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.\nof our efforts. Only in this way can incertitude and mysticism be\neliminated from the question of the divining rod, and in time the\npossibility of replacing the dowser by a physically based apparatus\nbe considered.\nI should here make the additional statement, that in the\nmeantime the famous geologist, Privy Councillor Hippolyt Haas,\nProfessor at the Kiel University, has joined the Committee of\nthe Society in place of Dr. Behme.\nI think it may interest English readers to learn briefly, on\nwhich bases of observation the defenders of the divining rod\nin Germany chiefly rely ;\n^ for the successes often quoted by\npapers as having been attained by water-wizards are not\ngenerally usable as scientific proofs, as they are very rarely\ncontrolled in a satisfactory manner by experts, and always\nleave open many questions chiefly appertaining to hydrology.\nIt is for this reason also that no great weight can be laid on\nthe statistics collected by ordinary practical dowsers. Such\nconsiderations do not apply to the method such as has been\nin use during the last few years at the Munich Municipal\nWaterworks. The chief mechanic, Kurringer, an excellent\ndowser, is officially employed by the Board of Works to allo-\ncate the points of rupture of burst water-pipes, which was till\nnow\u2014in the asphalted streets\u2014only possible by complicated\nand lengthy excavations. Although there have been non-\nsuccesses now and then with this method\u2014partly caused by\nindisposition of the dowser\u2014we must admit that the results\nobtained in the examination of burst pipes can only be\ncharacterised as bewildering. On the occasion of the last\ncongress of the Society of German Gas and Water Experts in\nMunich in June, 1912, the entire statistics of these experi-\nments have been exhibited by the Director of the Municipal\nWaterworks in about fifty plans and drawings. This material\nis to be published almost immediately by the Vcrhand\nztir Kldrung der Wilnschclrutenfrarjc.

We read, e.g.:\n\" Biirklein St. 13. Notification: Eushing in all junction-\nlines heard over 220 metres of the lines of pipes, proving\ndefect of tube. Statements of the dowser : turning of the\ndivining rod at 4 \"8 metres from the boundary of the house.\nDiscovered result: point of rupture of the pipe i'S metres from\nthe boundary of the house.\" Another example: \" Bogen St. 1.\njSTotification : Hushing in the cellar-pipes. Statements of the\ndowser: action of the divining rod at two points, 1'75 metres\nand 2'25 metres from the wall of the house. Discovered\nresult: Point of rupture 2'17 metres from the wall of the\nhouse.\" Several interesting cases in the official report of such\nan investigation have been published first by the Miinchner\nNeiiestc Nachriclitcn, and then by Di'. Aigner (\/oc. cit?j. We\ngive one of these typical cases.\nOn the ground of the Munich Gasworks crossed by, several\nstreets, the surface between the buildings is strewn with gravel.\nThere are no unevenesses. One line of rails is laid. The\nwarm-water supply of the Institute runs parallel to this\nline at a depth of 1 metre. One day the water reservoir\nshowed continued loss of water. When artificial pressure was\nbrought to bear on the system of pipes, the intensity of the\npressure decreased in such a manner, that a defect in the\nsupply appeared indubitable. None of the engineers or other\nexperts knew of any remedy but digging up the ground metre\nafter metre to look for the damage. The dowser, who was\ncalled in, while walking over the ground above the pipes,\ndesignated two points which were 40 centimetres from each\nother, and which marked the boundaries of the purlieu of the\ndefect. In the excavating it was discovered that exactly under-\nneath one of the two places indicated by the dowser there\nwas a defective socket, which proved, on further examination,\nto be the sole cause of the disturbance. This supply has a\nlength of 30 metres. The calculations, according to chance\nand probability, give a very favourable result for the dowser.\nAmongst others who were eye-witnesses of the experiments and\npositive results were the chief engineers of the Institution.\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.\nAnother case which shows in a manner perfectly free from\nobjection, a notable success of the divining rod, has been\ncommunicated by the Municipal Government Surveyor, Goette\n(Plauen).i A dike across the valley had been constructed in\nTambach, near Gotha, the working of which had been under-\ntaken by Municipal Government Surveyor, Goette. The\nreservoir had a loss of 216 litres per second, which pierced\nthrough the rock around the abutment of the wall. By aid\nof continued caulking, which was undertaken systematically by\nexperiments in boring and dyeing, the escape could be\ndiminished to 120 litres per second. But after this every\nother coign of vantage was wanting. \" I stood there helpless\nand could not advance.\" A water-finder then came and\noffered his services. Mr. Goette made a few tests capable of\nbeing controlled, and was startled at the correctness of the\nstatements. The man now received the order to settle the\nunknown leakages with his divining rod, and acting on his\ndirections, a number of bore-holes were sunk. \" I can assure\nyou with the utmost certainty that not one of these state-\nments has failed,\" the reporter asserts. In fact, the entire loss\nof water was, with the help of the dowser, diminished to\nbetween 8 and 10 litres per second.\nThe subject-matter here given, which could be greatly\naugmented, may suffice to show readers on the other side of\nthe channel that we in Germany have considerably advanced\nthe problem of the dowsing rod during the last few years.\nIndeed, we may maintain that the evidence of the facts in\nquestion can no longer be doubted, even though the explanation\nof the phenomena alluded to is still an open question. Still,\nwe do not believe that the fundamental principle of a solution\nto the problem lies in a supernormal psychical gift of the dowser,\nbut in the physical influence of the soil acting on him. It\nwould take up too much space here now to enter into a\ntheoretically detailed discussion. The literature mentioned\noffers exhaustive information also on this point.\n1 In the Journal fiir Gasheleuchluwj and Wasserversorguvy, Miincheii, 1910, No.\n39, and 1912, No. 24.\n\fDec, 1912. Dowsing and Unconscious Muscular Action. 335\nDOWSING AND UNCONSCIOUS MUSCULAE ACTION.\nBy Sir William F. Bap.kett, F.K.S.\nThe accompanying interesting letter to me from Professor Hyslop,\nthe Secretary and Editor of the Amei'ican Society for Psychical\nEesearch, illustrates the need of further investigation on the\nquestion of the involuntary and unconscious muscular action\nwhich, I have assumed in my papers, gives rise to the sudden\ntwisting of the dowsing rod. It is true,\u2014as will be seen from\nmy Report in Proceedings, Vol. XV., pp. 276 ct seq., and in\nsubsequent papers in the Journal,\u2014that the hypothesis of\nunconscious muscular action needs to be stretched to almost\nincredible limits in some cases, and amongst dowsers themselves\nit is universally discredited. But what other hypothesis can\ntake its place ?\nNew York, November 9th, 1912.\nI had occasion to visit a gentleman whose daughter did automatic\nwriting, for an experiment with her. I learned from him that, owing\nto scarcity of water in his well, he had been doing some dowsing\nto find more water. He suggested that I should try it. I had\ntried it many times in my life, without success. In my youth I\nhad tried it, and the rod turned occasionally, as it did with a regular\ndowser whom I knew. But I could never satisfy myself that uncon-\nscious muscular action, combined with gravity and the peculiar strain\non the arms of the rod, were excluded from the cause. But this\nturning of the rod was so rare (in my case) that the failures loomed\nhigh in the estimate of the cases. I had not tried it for years,\nwhen this gentleman asked me to see what I could do.\nHe gave me a maple rod, forked as usual, not witch hazel or\npeach, and pointed out the ground over which I should go. He\ncarefully concealed from me where he had found water. This,\nhowever, I did not learn until after my experiment, because the\ndirections he gave me led me to infer that he had found water near\na certain tree. I was firmly convinced that he had given himself\naway, and that my experiment would be worthless. But I tried it.\nThere was no evidence of water about. The Merrimac River was\nabout six hundred feet away, and his house and yard were on a\nbluff or slope about thirty feet high. There were no hollows on\nthe ground over which I was to go, and no one would suspect\nwater in one place more than another. . . .\n,\nBut with a certain tree and its locality firmly in miud as the\n\f336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.\nspot at which the rod had supposedly indicated the possibihtj^ of\nfinding water, this spot being about one hundred feet from where I\nstarted, I went to work. I held the rod with the point or apex\ndirectly in the upright position. I did not expect it to turn at all,\nbut also did expect that, if it did turn, it would move forward\nfrom me, as it had always done with the dowsers I had observed,\nand as it had done in the few cases in which I seemed to be\nsuccessful. I assumed, too, that my belief that the spot was near\nthe tree would influence its action, if influenced at all, as I approached\nthe tree. But to my astonishment, it began to turn backward toward\nme, and actually pushed on my breast till I had to stretch my hands\nout to let it pass, when I had gone to about thirty-five feet from\nthe tree. The gentleman then suggested that I should try it over\nagain, and hold the rod as he did, which was in a horizontal\nposition, so that when it turned down it would pass over 90\ndegrees of an arc. But I held the rod at an angle of about 45\ndegrees, expecting that gravity would prevent it from going anj'\nother way than downward. To my surprise, it rose to the vertical\nposition, and then over against my breast as before, and at the same\nspot as before. ... I went back and tried it again with the arms at\n45 degrees from the perpendicular, and resolved to hold the arms as\ntightly as I could to prevent their turning. But the rod again rose\nto the vertical and over against my breast, though I strove with all\nmy might to prevent it by squeezing my hands on the rod as tightly\nas its size would permit. The gentleman then told me that this\nwas the place where he had found the water, or rather where the\nrod had indicated it would be found. I had been firmly convinced\nthat it had been indicated at a spot thirty-five feet farther on.\nIt is not necessary to explain the facts. The primary point is\nthat neither expectation nor unconscious muscular action is the most\nnatural explanation. From the point of view of expectation the\nrod should not have turned until I was near the tree, but it turned\nwhere I had not even surmised the spot, this having been concealed\nfrom me. As to the second point, the most natural direction for\nthe stick to take, when it was held at an angle of 45 degrees from\nthe perpendicular, was forward and downward. Gravity would most\nnaturally predetermine that direction, and this was aided by expectation^\nunder the condition that any motion at all should occur. So we have\nhere action directly the opposite of expectation and what would be\nmost natural where gravity has any influence. All this is strengthened\nby my determined effort to hold the rod and prevent its turning. . . .\nThe primary interest of the experiment is not whether we were\n\fDec, 1912. Gases. 337\nreally successful in locating water. It is in the facts that we coincided\nin the locality involved, and that the rod behaved peculiarly, against\nexpectation and gravity. The gentleman was far behind me, and\ndid not precede me in movement. He remained stationary thirty\nfeet awaj' and behind me. Hence, no suggestion came from his\nposition. It would be of interest to ascertain whether water could\nbe found there, but that does not aftect the problem with which we\nare here concerned. James H. Hyslop.\nCASES.\nL. 1191. Dream.\nIn the following case a friend of Miss Verrall's had a dream,\napparently relating to a script produced by the latter two or\nthree weeks earlier, which had been seen by no one except\nherself and her mother.\nMiss Verrall gives the first account of it, as follows :\n5 Selavyn Gardens,\nCambridge, Nov. 17, 1912.\nOn Saturday, Nov. 9, 1912, I went to Cambridge for the week-end\nwith a friend here called Miss Jones, arriving at about lunch time.\nMiss Jones had never stayed in our house before.\nOn Sunday, Nov. 10th, when we first met at breakfast and before\nI had spoken at all, Miss Jones said: \"I want to tell you about\nmy dream. I dreamt that I was writing script, and that there was\nan important message in it for you or Mrs. Verrall. I woke up and\nremembered part of the message. I thought of making a note at\nonce, but was too sleepy to get out of bed. As I remember the\nmessage now it was :\n'\nTell her she is looking in the wrong place.\nShe ought to look in Verona.' The message was somehow connected\nwith Dante. In my dream I saw the bust of Dante, which we saw\nat Newnham yesterday.\"\nOn Saturday, Nov. 9, 1912, Miss Jones and I had visited the library\nat Newnham College, where there is a bust of Dante. No allusion\nhad been made to this bust at the time nor had our attention been\nspecially attracted to it in any way.\nHelen de G. Verrall.\nMrs. Verrall writes :\n5 Selwyn Gardens,\nCambridge, Ahrv. mii, 1912.\nOn Saturday, Nov. 9th, 1912, the lady here called Miss Jones, came\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1912.\nwith my daughter and another friend to spend the week-end at\nCambridge, this being the first time that Miss Jones had stayed at\nour house.\nOn Sunday, Nov. 10th, I did not breakfast with my daughter and\nour guests, but immediately after breakfast my daughter told me\nwhat Miss Jones had reported about her dream of the night before,\nand of her own impression that it referred to the H. V. script of\nwhich she and I had spoken a week before.\nI then saw Miss Jones, who repeated the dream to me in much the\nsame terms as it is recorded in my daughter's note. I wrote down the\nleading words at the time, and report them in \" \" below. I\nunderstood Miss Jones to say that there were two sentences : of these\nthe first, of which she had no clear recollection, concerned \"Dante\";\nthe second sentence ran: \"Tell her not to look there, but to try at\n{or go to) Verona.\" Miss Jones added that she had an impression\nthat this message was to be conveyed to my daughter or preferably\nto me, and that it was intended to suggest that some one was \" on\nthe wrong tack.\"\nOn October 22, 1912, my daughter's script contained the phrases,\nin juxtaposition :\n\" The Lombard poplar\u2014the Florentine's fierce love\n\u2014\n\"\nThis script was seen l)y me on Nov. 2, and suggested to me that\nthe combination of Lombardy with Dante might refer to Dante's stay\nat Verona. Dante at Verona is the title and subject of a poem by\nD. G. Rossetti.\nOn November 7 I began annotating this H. V. script, but left my\nnotes incomplete for further investigation of its literary or classical\nallusions.\nFurther investigation, after the hint given by the dream, makes it\nclear that the allusion in the script is to Dante at Verona. In\nParadiso, XVII. 71, Dante calls Bartolomeo della Scala, Lord of\nVerona, and his first host there, il gran Lombardo. Bartolomeo was\nthe elder brother of Can Grande, with whom Dante stayed on his\nlast visit to Verona. It is to this last visit that Eossetti's poem\nrefers, and the motto prefixed to the poem is a translation of\nParadiso, XVII. 58-60, with a line from the Purgatorio.\nMiss Jones knew that my daughter and I were automatic writers,\nbut had no knowledge of the H. V. script of Oct. 22, 1912.\nM. DE G. Verrall.\n\fDec, 1912. Gases. 339\nMiss Jones writes :\nNov. 21, 1912.\nOn the night between Saturday and Sunday, November 9 and 10\n(1912), I was awakened from a rather confused dream, in Avhich I\nwas either writing script myself or watching people write, by a voice\nwhich gave me a very urgent message to the effect that \" They \"\nwere to be told to look at Verona, or to go to Verona, as \" They \"\nwere now on the wrong tack. I was sufficiently awake to know\nwhere I was, and I asked, \"Whom shall I tell\u2014Helen \"Tell H.\nto tell her mother,\" was the reply. It seemed to me that the\nmask of Dante, which I may have seen that afternoon in Newnham\nLibrary, was floating in the darkness. There was more of this\nmessage, and I was urged to write it down there and then, but,\nfeeling disinclined to get up for a light and writing materials, I\nsatisfied myself by repeating the whole message. In the morning,\nhowever, I had forgotten all but wliat I told Miss Verrall, and have\nhere set down. I am not Cjuite sure that I was myself writing\nscript in the dream.\n[Signed] Ann Jones.\nMiss Verrall adds :\nMiss Jones told me to-day, Nov. 21, 1912, that what she saw in\nher dream was the death mask of Dante, with which she is familiar,\nnot the bust of which there is a copy in the Newnham Library ; but\nshe thought the one might have reminded her of the other.\nHelen de G. Verrall.\nP.S.\n\u2014\n{Dec. 2, 1912.) Although I have often discussed questions\nof psychical research with Miss Jones, I am absolutelj' certain that\nI never told her anything of the contents of my unpublished scripts\n(except that I once quoted to her an automatic poem which I wrote\nsome years ago) until after she had told me of her dream on Nov.\n10, 1912. I then said that I had recentl}' had a script containing\nreferences to Dante and Verona.\nH. de G. V.\nL. 1192.

It will be seen\nthat the circumstances of the case preclude the possibility of any\nconfirmatory evidence, but I am confident that Miss Jones's testimony\ncan be relied upon.\nHelkn de G. Verrall.\nMiss Ann Jones writes\n:\nMay 15, 1912.\nTwo years ago, as the result of a riding accident,^ my sister L.\nwas ill with concussion of the brain and a slisrht frontal fracture.\nShe was under the charge of Sir Victor Horsley and our own doctor\nfor a year, and is now completely recovered. For five days she did\nnot speak, and she did not recover full consciousness for three\nweeks. I saw her, by the doctors' orders, for a few minutes each\nday, and took careful note of what she said. There were several\nchanges in her speech and in her personality, which were recog-\nnised or expected by the doctors. From the first she recognised\nme, and though she has absolutely no memory of anything during\nthat time, my appearance invariably stirred in her some anxiety\nimmediately connected with whatever business I had in hand at the\ntime. In a good many instances this was not remarkable, as we\nlive together, and she knew of all my engagements for that period.\nShe also seemed aware of any steps I took from day to day in con-\nnexion with her own afl'airs.\nOne or two incidents, however, cannot be so readilj^ accounted for.\nThe first I noticed occurred about a week after the accident. My\nmother was away at the time visiting friends in Yorkshire. She\ndid not return for various good reasons, but naturally wrote daily.\nOne letter contained an account of a visit she had paid to an old\ncook of ours, who had married about twenty years ago, when my\nsister was quite a young child. When I went into L.'s room that\nmorning she said, \" Baa-see is so glad you've come,\" using a baby-\nname by which that cook had always called her, and which went\nout of use when she left us.\nThe next day I had among my letters one from a cousin, who\noff'ered to come to stay with me, saying that as L. was in a nui'sing\nhome she could occupy her room and be of no trouble. I had\ncompletely forgotten the project when I reached L. Her first words\n^The accident occurred in May, 1910. \u2014H. de G. V.\n\fDec, 1912. Cases. 341\nas I entered the room were, \" You won't let Dora (the cousin) sleep\nin my bed, will you ?\n\"\nAfter these speeches she relajjsed into incoherence or unconscious-\nness, and, of course, I never attempted any explanation or discussion.\nThe third instance may only be coincidence.\nA friend of mine, who occasionally assists me in my work, had\ncalled on me one evening in connexion with some work of mine he\nwas doing to help me during her illness. She and I often spoke of\nhim as \"The Publisher.\" The next morning, when I got there, L.\nsaid, \"How was he killed?\" I said, \"Who?\" L., \"The Pub-\nlisher.\" \"Ohl\" I said, thinking she had had an inkling of my\nvisitor, \"he's alive!\" \"Well, then,\" she asked, \"is it Mr.\nM. ?\n\" naming another publisher of our acc^uaintance. I never\nattempted to follow up any of her questions, and thought at the\ntime she was delirious. This happened about 10 a.m. When I got\nto Fleet Street, a little before 11, the first evening paper placards\nwere out with \" Death of a well-known Publisher.\" This turned\nout to be Mr. Alfred Nutt, who had been drowned in Paris early\nthat morning.\n1\nAs she recovered consciousness she lost this habit, though on the day\nof Sir George Newnes's death in June, when she was much better, she\nasked me constantly what news I was keeping from her, and kept\nreferring to the hour of his death, saying she knew something had\nhappened at that time.-\nShe is not in any way remarkable for this kind of thing in her\nnormal state, though one of our sisters has occasionally had prophetic\ndreams.\n[Signed] Ann Jonbs.\nMiss Jones wrote later\n:\nThe doctor's instructions were that I was not to speak to her at\nall except in short and soothing answers to her questions. She\nalways asked me about something I had just done before I had\nspoken a word. It was an instantaneous thought-reading. Many of\nthe instances were verj' trivial, and I have forgotten them. One I\ncan remember. She and I were to have trone with a friend to a\nperformance of Tristan and Isolde. I forgot all about it until the\nday after the performance, when I returned the unused tickets with\na letter of apology and explanation to the friend who had sent them.\n^ See my statement below. \u2014H. de G.

L. was very ill that day and quite incoherent, but during the\nfive minutes I was with her slie talked of Wagner and of the young\nman, a singer, who was to have taken us to the opera. We did not\nknow him well enough for her mention of his name to be natural.\nStatement by Miss Verrall.\nThis last instance might be a case of subconscious memory, since\nthe patient had known of the proposed visit to the opera before her\naccident.\nIn regard to the death of Mr. Nutt, he was drowned in the Seine\nat Meluii on the evening of Saturday, May 21, 1910. The news\nof his death was contained in a Renter telegram, which appeared\nin the IFestminster Gazette of Monday, May 23, 1910, and in the Times\nof Tuesday, May 24, 1910. It did not appear in the Times of May\n2.3, and therefore probably not in any morning paper of that day.\nAt the same time it is impossible to be absolutely certain that the\nnews was not subconsciously known to Miss A. Jones before she saw\nher sister. But in any case Miss L. Jones cannot have been aware\nof it, as she was at that time completely cut off from the outside\nworld. Unless we regard the episode as a chance coincidence, we\nmust suppose that Miss L. Jones's information was telepathically\nacquired either from her sister or more probably from some other\nexternal source.\nHelen de G. Verrall.\nL. 1193.
