The journal proclaimed that the \"scientific aspect of astrology is that which appeals to us very strongly, and it is our intention to make a special effort to keep to this side of the science.  The fortune-telling element, which has for so long been the curse of the science, and this entirely from the sordid tendencies of its supposed professors and advertisers, who were concerned more with the 'shekels' than the 'truth,' will be rigidly eliminated and opposed.\"  This was in contrast to its predecessor which had given considerable attention to the \"sordid tendencies\" now condemned.  Regular articles by Vivian Robson \"and other leading writers,\" and Sephariel's (William Richard Gorn Old's) \"The Kaleidoscope\" column, that appeared for 22 years.  Noted in William C. Hartmann's Who's Who in Occult, Psychic and Spiritual Realms (1925), and in L'Astrosophie, April 1929.
