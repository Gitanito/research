Succeeds: Almanach du magiste\r\n  1\/1, 1905-1910.  64 pp., 1 franc.\n\n In 1910 the title changed to Almanach de la Chance et de la Vie Mysterieuse.  This was intended as a sequel to Papus's Almanach du magiste, which ceased in 1899.  Professor \"Donato\" was obviously intended to be taken for the famous stage magnetist Alfred Edouard d'Hont, who had died in 1900, and may have been another stage magician by the name of Leonard-Chaumont (1848?-1927).  See the note under La Vie Mysterieuse.  Popular occult almanac, with visions, magical calendar, horoscopes, graphology, mesmerism, occult stories, etc., and a daily prognostication of favorable and unfavorable dates.  In 1906, notably, it published \"le main de fatime, une clef de la kabbale orientale,\" with a plate, which was said to show Cagliostro's infallible method of determining character through manipulation of numbers.
