I.\nBeing an Introduction to the whole Work.\n1\nDoubt not but the title of this book will\namufe fome of my reading friends a little at\nfirfl j they will make apaufe, perhaps, as they\ndo at a witch s\nprayer, and be fome time a re-\nfolving whether they had bed look into it or no,\nleft\nthey fhould really raife the Devil by reading\nhis ftory.\nChildren and old women have told thcmfelves Co\nmany frightful things oftheDevil^ and have form M\nideas of him in their minds, in fo\nmany horrible\nand monftrous fhapes, that really it were enough\nto fright the JDmVhimfelf, to meet himfelf in the\ndark, drefs\ndup in the feveral figures which imagi\nnation has form d for him in the minds of men 3\nand as for themfelves, I cannot think by any\nmeans that the Devil would terrify them half\nB fo\n\f2 The HISTORY\nfo much, if they were to converfe face to face\nwith him.\nIt mud certainly therefore be a moil ufeful un\ndertaking to give the truehiftory ofihisTyranfof\nthe air, this God of the world, this terror and aver-\nfion of mankind, which we call Devil; to {hew\nwhat he is, and what he is NOT, where he is, and\nwhere he is NOT, when he is IN us, and when he\nis NOT j for I cannot doubt but that the Devil\nis\nreally and bona fide in a great many of our ho\nned weak-headed friends, when they themfelves\nknow nothing of\n^ie\nmatter.\nNor is the work fo difficult as fome may ima\ngine. The Devil s\nhiftory is not fo hard to come\nat, as it feems to be ; His original and the firft rife\nof his family is-\nupon record, and as for his con\nduct, he has acted indeed in the dark, as to me\nthod in many things j but in general, as\ncunning\nas he is, he has been fool enough to expofe hitn-\nfelf in fome of the moil coniiderable tranfa&ions\nof his Life, and has not {hewn himfelf a politi\ncian at all: Our old friend Mdtcbiavcl outdid him\nin many things, and I may in the procefs of this\nwork give an account of feveral of the fons of\njlclam) and fome focieties of em too, who have\nout-witted the Devil, nay, who have out-fin d\nthe Devil, and that I think may be call d out-\n{hooting him in his own bow.\nIt may perhaps be expected of me in this hi-\nftory, that imce I feem inclined to (peak favoura\nbly of Satan, to do him juflice, and to write his\nilory impartially, J fliotild take fome pains to tell\nyou what religion he is of3 and even this part may\nnot be fo much a jclt, as at firft fight you may\ntake it to be 3 for Satan has fomething of reli\ngion in him, I aflure you j nor is he fuch an un\nprofitable Devil that way, as fome may fuppofe\nhim to be 3 for tho , in reverence to my brethren,\n.\ni t will\n\fof the DEVIL. f\n1 will not reckon him among the Clergy 5 No not\nfo much as a gifted Brother, yet I cannot deny,\nbut that he often preaches, and if it be not pro\nfitably to his hearers j tis as much their fault,\nas it is out of his defign&amp;gt;\nIt has indeed been fuggefled that he has taker!\norders, and that a certain Pope, famous for being\nan extraordinary favourite of his, gave him both\ninftitution and induction 5 but as this is not up\non record, and therefore we have no authentic\ndocument for the probation, I ihall not affirm it\nfor a truth, for I would not {lander the Devil.\nIt is faid alfo, and I am apt to believe it, that he\nwas very familiar with that holy father Pope Sifaef-\nter II. and fome charge him with perfonating Pope\nHildebrand on an extraordinary occafion, and him-\nfelf fitting\nin the chair apoftolick, in a full con\ngregation j and you may hear rriore of this here\nafter : But as I do not meet with Pope Diabolus\namong the lift 5 in all father PlatincCs lives of the\nPopes, fo I am willing to leave it as I find it.\nBut to fpeak to the point, and a nice point it is\nI acknowledge j namely, what religion the Devil\nis ofj my anfwer will indeed be general, yet not\nat all\nambiguous, for I love to fpeak pofitively and\nwith undoubted evidence.\nI . He is a leliever. And if in faying fo it fhould\nfollow, that even the Devil has more religion\nthan fome of our men of fame can at this\ntime be charged with, I hope my Lord -\nand his Grace the of and fome of\nthe upper clafs in the red-hot club, will not\nwear the coat, however well it\nmay fit to\ntheir fhapes, or challenge the Satyr, as if it\nwere pointed at them, becaufe tis due to\nthem : In a word, whatever their Lordfhips\nB a arc,\n\f4 The H I S T O R Y\nare, I can allure them that the Devil is no\nInfidel.\n2. He fears God. We have fuch abundant evi\ndence of this in facred Hiftory, that if I were\nnot at prefent, in common with a few others,\ntalking to an infidel fort of Gentlemen, with\nwhom thofe remote things call d Scriptures\nare not allow d in evidence, I might fay it\nwas fufficiently prov d \\ but I doubt not in\nthe procefs of this undertaking to {hew, that\nthe Devil really fears God, and that after ano*\nther manner than ever he fear d Saint Prances\nor Saint Dunftan ; and if that be proved, as\nI take upon me to advance, I {hall leave it\nto judgment, who s the better Chriitian, the\nDevil who believes and trembles, or our mo\ndern gentry of who believe neither God\nmr DeviL\nHaving thus brought the Devil within the Pale,\nI {hall leave him among you for the prefent j not\nbut that I may examine in its order who has the\nhefl claim to his brotherhood, the Papifts or the\nProteftantS} and among the latter the Lutherans or\ntheCalviniftsj and fodefcending to all thefeveral\ndenominations of churches, fee who has lefs otthe\nDevil m them, and who morej and whether lefs\nor more the Devil has not a feat in every fyna-\ngogue, a pew in every church, a place in every\npulpit, and a vote in every fynodj even from the\nSanhedrim of the Jews, to our friends at the\nBull and Mouth, &c. from the greateit to the\nleaft.\nIt will, I confefs, come very much within the\ncompals of this part of my difcourfe, to give an ac\ncount, or at leaft make an effay toward it,\nof the\nfliare the Devil has had in the fpreading religion\nin the world $ and efpecially of dividing and fubdi-\n4 viding\n\ftftfo DEVI L. 5\nviding opinions in religion 3 perhaps, to eke it out\nand make it reach the farther &amp;gt;\nand alfo to fhew\nhow far he is or has made himfelf a miffionary of\nthe famous clan de propaganda fide\n-\n9 it is true, we\nfind him heartily employed in almofr,\nevery cor\nner of the world adpi opagandum errorem : But that\nmay require a hiflory by it felf.\nAs to his propagating religion, tis a little hard\nindeed, at firit\nfight, to charge the Devil with\npropagating religion, that is to fay, if we take it\nliterally, and in the grofs ; but if\nyou take it as\nthe Scots infilled to take the oath of fidelity, viz.\nwith an explanation^ it is\nplain Satan Ms very\noften had a fhare in the method, if not in the\ndefign of propagating the chriftian faith : For ex\nample.\n1 think I do no injury at all to the Devil, to fay\nthat he had a great hand in the old holy war^ as\nit was ignorantly and enthufiailically called $\nflirring up the chriflian princes and powers of\nEurope to run a madding after the Turks and Sara-\ncens^ and make warwith thofe innocent people above\na thoufand miles off, only becaufp they entred in\nto God s\nheritage when he Kad forfaken it&amp;gt;\ngrazed upon his ground when he had fairly ttirn d\nit into a common, and laid it\nopen for the next\ncorner^ fpending their nation s treafure, and embark\ning their kings and people, (I fay) in a war above\na thoufand miles off, filling their heads with that\nreligious madnefs, call d, in thofe days, holy zeal\nto recover the terra fancla^ the fepulchers of thrift\nand the Saints, and as they call d it\nfalily, \\\\\\eholy\ncity^ tho true religion fays it was the accurfed city,\nand not worth fpending one drop of blood for.\nThis religious Bubble was certainly of Satan^\nwho, as he craftily drew them in, fo like a true\nDevil he left them in the lurch when they came\nthere, fac d about to the Saracens^ animated the\nB 3 immor-\n\f6 The HISTORY\nimmortal Saladln againft them, and manag d fq\ndexteroufly that he left the bones of about thir\nteen or fourteen hundred thoufond Chriftians there\nas a trophy of his infernal politicks &amp;gt;\nand after the\nchriftian world had run a In fanta terra^ or in\nEnglijh) a faunfring-jfobutz. hundred year, he dropt\nit to play another game lefs foolifh, but ten times\nwickeder than that which went before it, namely^\nturning the cruiadoes of the Chriftians one againit\nanother} and, as Iludibras foid in another cafe,\n&quot;\nMade them fight like mad or drunk\ntt For dame religion as for punk.\nOf this you have a compleat account in the\nhiftory of the Popes decrees againft the Count\nde Ihoukufe^ and the Waldenfes and A.lbigenfes^ with\nthe crufiidoes and maffacres which followed upon\nthem, wherein to do the Devir$ politicks fome\njuftice, he met with all the fuccefs he could de-\nfire &amp;gt;\nthe zealots of that day executed his in\nfernal orders moft punctually, and planted religi*\non in thofe countries in a glorious and triumphant\nmanner, upon the deftruction of an infinite num\nber of innocent people, whole blood has atten d\nthe foil for the growth of the Catholick faith, in\na manner very particular, and to Satan s full fatis-\ntac~l:ion.\nI might, to compleat this part of his hiftory,\ngive you the detail of his progrefs in thefe firft\niteps of his alliances with Rome; and add a long\nlift of mafllicres, wars, and expeditions in behalf\nof religion, which he has had the honour to have\na vifible hand in ; fuch as the Pariftan maflacre, the\nFkmijh war under the Duke d Aha^ the Smitfy-\npdd fires in the Marian days in England, and the\nmaflacres in Ireland; all which would moft effec\ntually convince us that; the Devil has not been\nidle.\n\fof the DEVIL; 7\nidle iti his bufinels j but I\nmay meet with thefe\nagain in my way, tis enough, while I am upon\nthe generals only, to mention them thus in a fum-\nmary way j I\nfay, tis\nenough to prove that the\nDevil has really been as much concerned as any\nbody, in the methods taken by fome people for\npropagating the chriftian religion in the world.\nSome have rafhly, and I had almoil fatd mali-\ncioufly charg d the Devil with the great triumphs\nof his friends the Spaniards in America,\nand would\nplace the conqueit of Mexico and Pent to the cre\ndit of his account.\nBut I cannot join with them in this at all, I\nmufl (ay, I believe the Devil was innocent of that\nmatter j my reafon is, becaufe, Satan was never\nfuch a fool as to fpend his time, or his politicks,\nor embark his allies to conquer nations who were\nalready his ownj that would be Satan againit\nBeelzebub^ making war upon himfelf, and at lead\ndoing nothing to the purpofe.\nIf they fhould charge him, indeed, with de\nluging Philip II. of Spain into that prcpofterous at\ntempt call d the Armada^ (anglice^ the Spanijh Inva-\nfionj I fhould indeed more readily join with them j\nbut whether he did it\nweakly, in hope, which was\nindeed not likely, that it fhould fucceed j or wick\nedly, to deflroy that great fleet ofthe Spaniards, and\ndraw them within the reach of his own do\nminions, the elements j this being a queftion which\nauthors differ exceedingly about, I fhall leave it\nto decide it felf.\nBut the greater! piece of management, which we\nfind the Devilhzs concerned himielf in of late, in the\nmatter of religion, fecms to be that ofthe mhTion\ninto China j and here indeed Satan has afted his\nmailer-piece: It was, no doubt, much for his fer-\nvice, that the Chinefes fhould have no infight in\nto matters of religion, I mean, that we call chrifc\nB 4\n\fS The HSITORY\ntian j and therefore, tho Popery and the Devil arc\nnot at fo much variance as fome may imagine, yet\nhe did not think it fafe to let the general fyilem\nof Chriftianity be heard of among them in China.\nHence when the name of the chriftian religion\nhad but been received with fome feeming appro\nbation in the country of Japan^ Satan imme\ndiately, as if alarm d at the thing, and dread\ning what the confequence of it\nmight be, arm d\nthe Japonefes again ft it with fuch fury, that they\nexpelPd it at once.\nIt was much fafer to his\ndefigns, when, if the\nflory be not a fiction, he put that Dutch witicifm.\ninto the mouths of the States commanders, when\nthey came to Japan j who having more wit than\nto own themfelves Chriftians in fuch a place as\nthat, when theqncftionwasput to them, anfwer-\ned negatively, nat they were not^ but that they\nwere of another religion call d Hollanders.\nHowever, it feems the diligent Jefuits out-wit-\nted the Devil in Cbina^ and, as I faid above, over-\nihot him in his own Bow 5 for the million being\nin danger by the Devil and the Chinefe Emperor&quot;?,\njoining together^ of being wholly expelFd there\ntoo, as they had been in Japan^ they cunningly\nfell in with the ecclefiafticks of the country, and\njoining the prieftcraft of both religions together,\nthey brought Jefus Chrifl and Confucius to be fo\nreconcilable, that the Chinefe and the Roman ido\nlatry appeared capable of a confederacy, of go\ning on hand in hand together, and confequent-\n]y of being very good friends.\nThis was a matter- piece indeed, and, as they\nfay^ almofl frighted Satan out of his wits; but\nhe being a ready manager, and particularly fa\nmous for ferving himfelf of the rogueries of the\npriefts,\nfac d about immediately to the miffion,\nand making a virtue of neceflity, clapt in, with\n\fof the DEVIL 9\nall\npoffible alacrity^ with the propofal\n*\n&amp;gt;\nfo the\nJejuitszndi\nheform d ^hotch-potch of religion made\nup of Popery and Paganifm^ and calculated to leave\nthe latter rather worie than they found it, blind\ning the faith of Chrift and the philofophy or mo\nrals of Confucius together, and formally chriften-\ning them by the name qf religion j by which means\nthe politick intereft of the mrflion was prefer-\nved j and yet Satan loft not one inch of ground\nwith the Chinefes, no, not by the planting the\nGofpel it felf, fuch as it was, among them.\nNor has it been fuch difadvantage to him that\nthis plan or fcheme of a new modelled religion\nwould not go down at Rome,\nand that the Inqui-\nfition damn d it with Bell, Book and Candle 5 dif-\ntance of place ferv d his new allies, the mifliona-\nries, in the Head of a protection from the Inqui-\nfition &amp;gt;\nand now and then a rich prefent well plac d\nfound them friends in the congregation it felf5 and\nwhere anyNuncio with his impudent zeal pretended\nto take fuch a long voyage to oppofe them, Satan\ntook care to get him fent back re infeffa, or in-\nfpir d the million to move him off the premifles,\nby methods of their own (that is to fay, being\ninterpreted) to murther him.\nThus the miffion has in it felf been truly devilifh^\nand the Devil has interefted himfelf in the planting\nthe chriftian religion in China.\nThe influence the Devil has in the Politicks of\nmankind, is another efpecial part of his hiftory,\nand would require, if it were poffible,\na veryexad:\ndefcription; but here we fhall neceflarily be obli\nged to inquire fo nicely into the Arcana of circum-\nitances, and unlock the cabinets of ilate in fo many\n\\\n* N.

For example, What if he has had any\nconcern in the late affair of ttorn ? What need\nwe put it\nupon him, feeing his confederates the\nJefuites with the Affefforial tribunal of Poland\ntake it\nupon themfelves? I fhall leave that part\nto the ifTue of time. I wifh it were as eafy to\nperfuade the world that he had no hand in bring\ning the injur d Proteftants to leave the juflice due\nto the cries of proteftant blood to the arbitrament\nof a popiili power, who dare fay that the Devil\ntnuft be in it, if juftice\nfhould be obtained that\nway : I ihould rather fay, the Devil is in it, or\nelfe it would never be expe&ed.\nIt occurs next to enquire from the premises,\nwhether the Devil has more influence or lefs in the\naffairs of the world now, than he had in former\nages 5 and this will depend upon comparing, as\nwe go along, his methods and way of working in\npaft times, and the modern politicks by which\nhe acts in our days 5 with the differing reception\nwhich he has met with among th^e men of fuch dif-\ntant ages.\nBut\n\fof the DEVIL. n\nBut there is fo much to enquire of about the\nbefore we can bring his (lory down to\nour modern times, that we muft for the pre-\nfent let them drop, and look a little back to\nthe remoter parts of this hiftory &amp;gt;\ndrawing his\npicture that people may know him when they\nmeet him, and fee who and what he is, and whap\nhe has been doing ever fince he got leave to ab in -\/\n!\nthe high ftation he now appears in.\nIn the mean time, if I might obtain leave tg#\nprefent an humble petition to Satan^ it fhould be&quot;,\nthat he would according to modern ufage oblige\nus all, with writing the hiflory of bis own times j\ntwould,, as well as one that is\ngone before it, be\na Deviliih good one &amp;gt;\nfor as to the fincerity of the\nperformance, the authority of the particulars, the\njuftice of the characters, &V. if they were no bet\nter vouch d, no more confiftent with themfelves,\nwith charity, with truth, and with the honour of\nan hiftorian, than the laft of that kind which\ncame abroad among us, it mud be a reproach to\nthe Devil himfelf to be the author of it.\nWere Satan to be brought under the leaft ob\nligation to write truth, and that the matters of\nfact, which he fhquld write, might be depended\nupon, he is\ncertainly qualified by his knowledge\nof things to be a compleat hiftorian 5 nor could\nthe Bimop himfelf, who, by the way, has given us\nalready the Devil of a hiftory^ come up to him :\nMilton s\nPandemonium^ tho an excellent drama-\ntick performance, would appear a meer trifling\niing-fong bufinefs, beneath the dignity of Chevy-\nchafe : The Devil could give us a true account\ncf all thje civil wars in Heaven j how and by\nwhom, and in what manner he loft the day there,\nand was oblig d to quit the field : The fiction of\nhis refufing to acknowledge and fubmit to the\nupon his being, declared Generaliffimo of\nthe\n\f13 The HISTORY\nthe Heavenly forces, which Satan expected him-\nlelf, as the elded officer -\n9 and his not being able\nto brook another to be put in over his head j I\nfay,\nthat fine-fpun thought of Mr. Milton would, ap\npear to be ftrain d too far, and only ferve to con\nvince us that he (Milton) knew nothing of the mat\nter. Satan knows very well, that the Mejffiah was\nnot declared to be the Son of God with power till\nby and after the refarreftion from the dead^ and\nthat all\npower was then given him in Heaven and,\nearth, and not before j io that Sat&quot;an s rebellion\ninuft derive from other caufes, and upon other\n.occafions, as he himfelf can doubtlefs give us an\naccount, if he thinks fit, and of

Heaven, wrought by a\nfupernatural power in the way of miracle? or\nwhether, according to Mr. Burners Theory^ it was\na confequence following antecedent caufes by the\nmeer neceffity of nature 5 feen in conftitution,\nnatural pofition, and unavoidable working of\nthings, as by the Theory publiih d by that learned\nenthufrail it feems to be ?\nSatan could eafily account for all the difficul\nties of the Theory^ and tell us whether, as there\nwas a natural neceffity of the Deluge, there is not\nthe like neceffity and natural tendency to a Con\nflagration at laft.\nWould the Devil exert himfelf

came\nvoluntier to him to go into the ark, or whether\nhe went a hunting for feveral years before, in or\nder to bring them together.\nHe could give us a true relation how he wheed\nled the people of the next world into the abfurd\nridiculous undertaking of building a Babel &amp;gt;\nhow\nfar that ftupendous flair-cafe, which was in ima\ngination to reach up to Heaven, was carried, be\nfore it was

have been made fince that, by which\nmeans very few of God s creatures, except the\nBrutes, underftand one another, or care one far\nthing whether they do or no.\nIn all thefe things Satan^ who, no

lurkifb Hegbira^ the\nChinefe fictitious account of the world s duration,\nas our blind Julian and Gregorian accounts, which\nhave put the world, to this day, into fuch confu-\nfion, that we neither agree in our holy-days or\nworking days, fafts or feafts, nor keep the fame\nfabbaths in any part of the fame globe.\nThis great Antiquary could bring us to a certain\nty in all the difficulties of

It is true indeed, the Devil^ who we\nhave reafon to fay is no fool, ought to know better\nthan to fuppofe that if he Aiould feduce the whole\nrace of mankind, and make them as bad as him-\n(elf, he could, by that fuccefs of his wickednefs,\nthwart or difappoint the determined purpofes\nof Heaven j but that thofe which are appointed\nto inherit the Thrones, which he and his fol\nlowers abdicated, and were depofed from, fhall\ncertainly be preferv d in fpite of his Devices for\nthat inheritance, and {hall have the pofTeffion fe-\ncur d to them, notwithftanding all that the\nDtvil and all the Hoft of Hell can do to pre\nvent it.\nBut, however he knows the certainty of this,\nand that when he endeavours the feducing thecho-\nfen fervants of the moft High, he fights againft\nGOD himfelf, ftruggles with irrefiftible grace, and\nmakes war with infinite power\n-\ny undermining the\nchurch pf God, and that faith in htm which is\nfortified\nwitji\nthe eternal promifes ofJefus Chrifr,\nthat the gates of Ifellj that is to fay, the Devil and\nall his power, fhall not prevail againft them 3 I\nfay, however he knows the impofilbility there is\nthat he fhould obtain his ends, yet ib blind is his\nrage, fo infatuate his wifdom, that he cannot re\nfrain breaking himfelf to pieces againft this moun\ntain, and fplitting againft the rock. qui Jupiter\n&amp;lt;vult\nperdere bos dementat.\nBut to leave this ferious part, which is a little\ntoo folemn, for the account of this rebel 5 feeing\nwe are not to expect he will write his own Hi-\nflory for our information and diverfion, I fhall fee\nif I cannot write it for him : In order to this, I\nfhall\n\fof the D E VI L. 17\nfhall extraft the fubftance of his whole (lory, from\nthe beginning to our own times, which 1 iliall col\nlet out of what is come to hand, whether by\nrevelation or infpiration, that s\nnothing to him -\ny\nI fhall take care fo to improve my intelligence, as\nmay make my account of him authentick, and,\nin a word, fuch as the Devil himfelf fhall not be\nable to contradict\nIn writing this uncouth (lory I {hall be freed\nfrom the cenfures of the Criticks, in a more than\nordinary manner, upon one account efpeciallyj\n(viz. ) that my ftory fhall be fo juft and fo well\ngrounded, and, after all the good things I fhall\nlay of Satan, will be fo little to his fatisfoclion, that\nthe Devil himfelf will not be able to fay, I dealt\nwith the Devil in writing it : I might, perhaps,\ngive you fome account where I had my intelli-\nfence,andhowall\nthe Arcana of his\nmanagement\nave come to my hands 5 but pardon me, Gentle*\nmen, this would be to betray converfation, and to\ndifcovcr my agents, and you know ftatefmen are\nvery careful to preferve the correfpondences they\nkeep in the enemy s\ncountry, left\nthey expoie\ntheir friends to the refencment of the Power\nwhofe councils they betray.\nBefides, the learned tell us, that minifters of ftate\nmake an excellent pica of their not betraying their\nintelligence, againil all\nparty inquiries into the\ngreat fums of money pretended to be paid for fe-\ncret\nfervice &amp;gt;\nand whether the fecrct fervice was to\nbribe\npeople to betray things abroad or at homej\nwhether the\nmoney was paid to fome body or to no\nbody, employed to eftablim correfpondences abroad,\nor to eftablifh families and amafs treafure at home&amp;gt;\nin a\nword, whether it was to ferve their country\norfervethemfelves,it has been the fame thing, and\nthe fame plea has been their protection: Like-\nwile in the important affair which I am upon, tis\nC hoped\n\fis The HISTORY\nhoped you will not defire me to betray my Corre-\nfpondents 5 for you know Satan is\nnaturally cruel\nand malicious, and who knows what he might do\nto fhew his refentment? at lead it\nmight endanger\na flop of our intelligence for the future.\nAnd yet, before I have done, I {hall make it\nvery plain, that however my information may be\nfeciet and difficult, that yet I came very honeftly\nby it, and fhall make a very good ufe of it $ for\ntis a great miftake in thofe who think that an ac\nquaintance with the affairs of the Devil may not\nbe made very ufeful to us all :\nThey that know no\nevil can know no good &amp;gt;\nand, as the learned tell us,\nthat a flone taken out of the head of a Toad is a\ngood antidote againft poifonj fo a competent\nknowledge oftke Devil, and all his ways, may be\nthe beft help to make us defie the Devil and all\nhis works.\nCHAP.

25\ndenies one, generally denies both ; and he that be\nlieves one, neceflarily believes both.\nVery few, if any of thofe who believe there is a\nGOD, and acknowledge the debt of homage which\nmankind owes to the fupreme Governor of the\nWorld, doubt the exiftence of the Devil, except\nhere and there one,whom we call practical Atheifts -,\nand tis the character of an Atheift, if there is fuch\na creature on Earth, that like my Lord Duke^ he\nbelieves neither GOD or Devil.\nAs the belief of both thefe (lands upon a level,\nand that GOD and the Devil feem to have an\nequal {hare in our faith, fo the evidence of their\nexiftence feems to ftand upon a level too&amp;gt;\nin many\nthings j and as they are known by their Works\nin the fame particular cafes, fo they are difcover d\nafter the fame manner of demonftration.\nNay, in fome refpe&s tis\nequally criminal to\ndeny the reality of them both, only with this\ndifference, that to believe the exiftence of a GOD\nis a debt to nature, and to believe the exiftence of\nthe Devil is a like debt to reafon j one is a demon\nftration from the reality of vifible cauies, and the\nother a deduction from the like reality of their\neffets.\nOne demonftration of the exiftence of GOD,\nis from the univcrfal well-guided confent of all\nnations to worfliip and adore a fupreme Power ;\nOne demonftration of the exiftence of the Devil^\nis from the avow d ill-guided confent of fome na\ntions, who knowing no other GOD, make a GOD\nof the Devil, for want of a better.\nIt may be true, that thofe nations have no other\nIdeas of the Devil than as of a fuperior Power $ if\nthey thought him a fupreme Power it would have\nother effects on them, and they would fubmit to\nand worfhip him with a different kind of fear.\nC 4 But\n\f24 T^HSITORY\nBut tis\nplain they have right notions of him as a\nDevil or evil\nSpirit, becaufe the beft reafon, and in\nibme places the only reafon they give for worfhip-\ning him is, that he may do them no hurt 3 having\nno notions at all of his having any power, much\nlefs\nany inclination to do them good $ fo that in\ndeed they make a meer Devil of him, at the fame\ntime that they bow| to him as to a GOD.\nAll the ages of Paganifm in the World have\nhad this notion of the Devil: indeed in fome parts\nof the World they had alfo fome Deities which\nthey honoured above him, as\nbeing fuppofed to be\nbeneficent, kind and inclin d, as well as capable\nto give them good things &amp;gt;\nfor this reafon the\nmore polite Heathens, fuch as the Grecians and\nthe Romans, had their Lares or houfhold Gods,\nwhom they paid a particular refpect to j as being\ntheir Protectors from Hobgoblins, Ghofls of the\nDead, evil jSpirits, frightful Appearances, evil Ge\nnius s and other noxious Beings from the invi-\nfible World 5 or to put it into the language of\nthe day we live in, from the Devil, in whatever\nfhape or appearance he might come to them, and\nfrom whatever might hurt them : and what was all\nthis but fetting up Devils againft Devils, fupplica-\nting one Devil under the notion of a good Spirit,\nto drive out and protect them from another, whom\nthey calFd a bad Spirit, the white Devil againft\nthe black Devil?\nThis proceeds from the natural notions man\nkind neceflarily entertain of things to come; fupe*\nrior or inferior, GOD and the Devil, fill\nup all fu\nturity in our thoughts ^ and tis\nimpoflible for us\nto form any images in our minds of an immor\ntality and an invifible World, but under the no\ntions of perfect felicity, or extreme mifery.\nNow as thefe two refpect the Eternal ftate\nof man after life, they are refpeftively the object\n\fof the DEVIL #\nof our reverence and affection, or of our horror and\naverfionj but notwith {landing they are plac d thus\nin a diametrical opposition in our affections and\npaffions, they are on an evident level as to the cer\ntainty of their exiftence, and, as I faid above, bear\nan equal {hare in our faith.\nIt being then as certain that there is a Devil, as\nthat there is a GW, I mud from this time forward\nadmit no more doubt of his exiftence, nor take\nany more pains to convince you of it 5 but {peak\ning of him as a reality in Being, proceed to enquire\nwho he is, and from whence, in order to enter\ndirectly into the detail of his Hiftory.\nNow not to enter into all the metaphyfical trum\npery of his Schools, nor wholly to confine my\nfelf to the language of the Pulpit ; where we are\ntold, that to think of GOD and of the Z)m7, we\nmuft endeavour firft to form Ideas of thofe things\nwhich illuftrate the defcription of rewards and\npunifhments &amp;gt;\nin the one the eternal prefence of\nthe higheft good, and, as a neceflary attendant, the\nmoft perfect, confummate, durable blifs and felicity,\nfpringing from the prefence of that Being in whom\nall\npoffible Beatitude is\ninexpreflibly prefent, and\nthat in the higheft perfection : On the contra\nry, to conceive of a fublime fallen Arch-angel,\nattended with an innumerable hoft of degenerate,\nrebel Seraphs or Angels caftout of Heaven toge\nther -\ny all\nguilty of inexpreffible rebellion, and all\nfuffering from that time, and to fuffer for ever\nthe eternal vengeance of the Almighty, in an in\nconceivable manner ; that his prefence, tho blefled\nin it felf, is to them the moft compleat article of ter\nror 9 That they are in themfelves perfectly miferablej\nand to be with whom for ever, adds an inex-\npreffible mifery to any ftate as well as\nplace j and\nfills the minds of thofe who are to be, or expect to\nbe\n\f26 The HIS TORY\nbe banifh d to them with inconceivable horror and\namazement.\nBut when you have gone over all this, and a\ngreat deal more of the like, tho lefs intelligible\nlanguage, which the paffions of men colled to\namufe one another with ; you have faid nothing\nif you omit the main article, namely, the perfonality\nof the Devil y and till\nyou add to all the reft fome\ndefcription of the company with whom all this is\nto be fuffer d, viz. the Devil and his Angels.\nNow who this Devil and his Angels are, what\nihare they have either\nactively\nor paffively in the\neternal miferies of a future ftate, how far they\nare Agents in or Partners with the fufferings of\nthe place, is a difficulty yet not fully difcover d\nby the moft learned j nor do I believe tis made\nlefs a difficulty by their medling with it.\nBut to come to the perfon and original of the\nDevi^ or, as I faid before, of Devils j I allow him\nto come of an ancient family, for he is from Hea\nven, and more truly than the Romans could fay\nof their idoliz d Numa, he is of the race of the\nGods.\nThat Satan is a fallen Angel, a rebel Seraph,\ncaft out for his Rebellion, is the general opini\non, and tis not my bufinefs to difpute things uni-\nverfally receiv d ; as he was try d, condemn d, and\nthe fentence of expulfion executed on him in\nHeaven, he is in this World like\natranfportcd Fe\nlon never to return; His crime, whatever par\nticular aggravations it might have, tis certain,\namounted to High-treafon againft his Lord and Go\nvernor, who wasalfo his Maker j againft whom\nhe rofe in rebellion, took up arms, and in a word,\nrais d a horrid and unnatural war in his domini\nons ;

And as I fhall be oblig d\nto do Satan juftice when I come to that part of\nhis Hiftory, Mr. Milton s admirers muft pardon me,\nif I let them fee, that tho I admire Mr. Milton as\na Poet, yet that he was greatly out in matters of\nHiftory, and efpecially the Hiftory of the Devil$\nin fhort, That he has charged Satan falfly in fe-\nveral particulars ; and fo he has Adam and Eve\ntoo : But that I lhall leave till I come to the Hi\nftory of the Royal Family of Eden\\ which I re-\nfolve to prefent you with when the Devil and I\nhave done with one another.\nBut not to run down Mr. Milton neither, whofe\npoetry, or his judgment, cannot be reproached\nwithout injury to our own j all thofe bright Ideas\nof his, which make his poem fo juftly valued,\nwhether they are capable of proof as to the fact,\nare\nnotwithstanding, confirmations of my hypo-\nthefis i and are taken from a fuppofition of the\nPerfonality of the Devil^ placing him at the\nhead of the infernal hoft, as a fovereign ele\nvated Spirit and Monarch of Hell &amp;gt;\nand as fuch it i$\nthat I undertake to write his hiftory.\nBy the word Hell I do not fuppofe, or at leaft\nHot determine, that his residence, or that of the\nwhole\n\f*s The HISTORY\nwhole army of Devils, is\nyet in the fame local\nHELL, to which the Divines tell us he fliall be\nat lad chain ddovvn j or at lead that he is\nyet con-\nfin d to it, for we fhall find he is\natprefenta pri-\nfoner at large: of both which circumfiances\nof Satan I fhall take occafion to fpeak in its\ncourfe?\nBut when I call the Devil the Monarch of \/&\/\/,\nI am to be underftood as fuits to the prefent pur-\npofe; that he is the Sovereign of all the race of\nHell, that is to fay of all the Devils or Spirits of\nthe infernal Clan, let their numbers, quality and\npowers be what they will.\nUpon this fuppofed peribnality and fuperiority\nof Satan^ or, as I call it, the fovereignty and go\nvernment of one Devil above all the reft -\ny I fay,\nupon this notion are form d all the fyftems of the\ndark fide of futurity, that we can form in our minds :\nAnd fo general is the opinion of it, that it will\nhardly bear to be oppos d by any other argument,\nat leaft that will bear to be reafon d upon : All\nthe notions of a parity of Devils, or making 3\ncommon-wealth among the black Divan, feem to\nbe enthufiaftick and vifionary, but with no con-\nfiftency or certainty, and is fo generally exploded,\nthat we muft not venture fo much as to debate\nthe point.\nTaking it then as the generality of mankind\ndo, that there is a Grand Devil, a fuperiorof the\nwhole black race j that they all fell, together with\ntheir General, Satan^ at the head of them 5 that\ntho he, Sat&n^ could not maintain his high fta-\ndon in Heaven, yet that he did continue his dig\nnity among the reft, who are call d his fervants,\nin Scripture his dngeh &amp;gt;\nthat he has a kind of do\nminion or authority over the reft, and that they\nwere all, how many million^ foever in number, at\nhis command &amp;gt;\nemploy d by him in all his hellifh\ndefigns.\n\fof the DEVIL. *&amp;lt;&amp;gt;\ndefigns,\nand in all his wicked contrivances for the\ndeftru&ion of man, and for the fetting up his own\nkingdom in the world.\nSuppofing then that there is fuch a iuperior\nMafter-Devil over all the reft, it remains that we\nenquire into his chara&er, and fomething of his\nHiftory j in which, tho we cannot perhaps pro\nduce fuch authentick documents as in the ftory of\nother great Monarchs, Tyrants, and Furies of the\nWorld &amp;gt;\nyet I ihall endeavour to fpeak fome things\nwhich the experience of mankind may be apt to\nconfirm, and which the Devil hirnfelf will hardly\nbe able to contradict.\nIt being then granted that there is fuch a thing\nor perfon, call him which we will, as a Mafter-\nDevil i that he is thus fuperior to all the reft in\npower and in authority, and that all the other evil\nSpirits are his Angels, or Minifters, or Officers to\nexecute his commands, and are employ d in his\nbufinefs 5 it remains to enquire, whence he came?\nhow he got hither, into this World ? what that\nbufinefs is which he is\nemploy d about? what\nhis prefent ftate is, and where and to what part\nof the creation of God he is limited and rcftrained ?\nwhat the liberties are he takes or is allow d to\ntake? in what manner he works, and how his in-\nftrumcnts arc likewife allow d to work ? what he\nhas done ever fince he commenc d Devil, what\nhe is now doing, and what he may yet do before\nhis J,aft and clofer confinement? as alfo what he\ncan\/iot do, and how far we may or may not be\n(aid to be cxpofed to him, or have or have not\nreaibn to be afraid of him?

But this wants\nfarther explanation.\nCHAP. III.\nOf the original of the DEVIL, who he isl\nand what be was before his expulfion out\nof Heaven, and in whatflate he wasfrom\nthat time to the creation of Man.\nTO\ncome to a regular enquiry into Satan s\naffairs, tis needful we fliould go back to his\noriginal, as far as hiftory and the opinion of the\nlearned World will give us leave.\nIt is\nscreed by all Writers, as well facred aspro-\nphane, that this creature we now call a Devil,\nwas originally an Angel oflight, a glorious Seraph 5\nperhaps the choiceft of all the glorious Seraphs.\nSee how Milton defcribes his original glory :\nSatan, fo call him now, his former name\nIs heard no more in Heaven : He of the firft,\nIf not the fir\nft Archangel -,\ngreat in power,\nIn favour and preeminence.\nlib. v. foL 140.\nAnd again the fame author, and upon the fame\nfubjeft :\n-Brighter\n\f32, The HIS TORY\nBrighter once amidft the hoft\nOf Angels, than that ftar the liars among.\nlib. vii. fol. i8p.\nThe glorious figure which Satan is\nfuppofed to\nmake among the Thrones and Dominions in Hea\nven is fuch, as we might fuppofe the highefl An\ngel in that exalted train could make ; and fome\nthink, as above^ that he was the chief of the\nArch-angels.\nHence that notion, (and not ill founded) namely ,\nthat the firft caufe of his difgrace, and on which\nenfued his rebellion, was occafioned upon God s\nproclaiming his SON Generaliflimo ,\nand with\nhimfelf fupreme ruler in heaven 3 giving the do\nminion of all his works of creation, as well al\nready finifh d, as not then begun, to him j which\npoft of honour (fay they) Satan expefted to be\nconferr d on himfelf, as next in honour, majefty\nand power to God the Supreme.\nThis opinion is foliow d by Mr. Milton too, as\nappears in the following lines, where he makes\nall the Angels attending all a general fummons,\nand God the Father making the following de\nclaration to them.\n&quot;\nHere, all ye Angels, prodigy of light,\n&amp;lt;c\nThrones,dominions5princedoms,virtues5 pow rs *\ncc\nHear my decree, which unrevok d ihall Hand.\n&quot;\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\n&quot;\nMy only S o N, and on this hill\n^ Him have anointed, whom you now behold\n&quot;\nAt my right hand j your Head I Him appoint:\ncc\nAnd my felf have fworn to him {hall bow\n&quot;\nAll knees inHeav n, and fhallconfefs him Lord,\n&amp;lt;\nc\nUnder his great vice-gerent reign abide\n4\n&quot;\nUnited^\n\fof the DEVIL. 33\n&quot;\nUnited, as one individual foul,\n4C\nFor ever happy : Him who difobeys,\n&quot;\nMe difobeys, breaks union, and that day\n&quot;\nCaft out from GOD, and bleffedvifion, falls\n&quot;\nInto utter darknefs, deep ingulph d, his place\nCc\nOrdain d without redemption, without end.\nSatan, affronted at the appearance of a new Ef-\n(ence or Being in Heaven, call d the Son of God &amp;gt;\nfor God, fays Mr.A\/\/7\/0#, (tho erroneoufly) declared\nhimfelf at that time, faying, This day have I be\ngotten him, and that he fhould be fet\nup, above all\nthe former Powers of Heaven, of whom Satan\n(as above) was the Chier^ and expe&ing, if\nany\nhigher poft could be granted, it\nmight be his due j\nI lay, affronted at this he rcfolv d\na With all his Legions to diflodge, and leave\n&quot;\nUnworfhip d, unobey d, the throne fupreme\n&quot;\nContemptuous.\nPar. lofti lib. v. fo. 140*\nBut Mr. Milton is\ngrofly erroneous inafcribing\nthofe words, This day have Ibegotten thee^ to that de\nclaration of the Father before Satan fell, and confe-\nquently to a time before the creation , whereas,\nit is\nby Interpreters agreed to be underftood of\nthe Incarnation of the Son of God, or at leafl of\nthe Refurre&ion :\n* fee Pool upon Atts xiii.\n33.\nD In\n* Mr. Pool*!

The truth is, all the anrient\nnames given him, of which the Scripture is full,\nfeems to be originals derived from and adapted to\nthe feveral fteps he has taken, and the feveral\nfhapes he has appeared in to do mifchief in the\nworld.\nHere he is called the Serpent) Gen. iii. i .\nThe old Serpent^ Rev. xii. p.\nThe great red Dragon, Rev. xii.\n$.\nThedccttfer ofthe Brethren^ Rev.xii. i o.\nThe Enerny^ Matt, xxiii. 2p.\nSatart) Job i.

Thus we are\ntold in Scripture of the works of the Devil, i\nJohn\niii. 8. of cafting out the Devil, Mark i.\n34. of\nrcfifting the Devil, fames iv. f. of our Saviour\nbeing tempted of the Devil, Mat. iv. 1 . of Si\nmon Magus, a child of the Devil, Acbs xiii. 10.\nThe Devil came down in a great wrath.

According to thisufage in fpeech\nwe go on to this day, and all the infernal\nthings\n\\ve converfe with in the world, are fathered upon\nthe Devil\nr\n,\nas one undivided fimple effence, by\nhow many agents foever working :\nEvery thing\nevil, frightful in appearance, wicked in its\nactings,\nhorrible in its manner, monftrous in its\neffects,\nis called the Devil; in a word, Devil is the com\nmon name for all Devils j that is to (ay, for all\nevil Spirits, all evil Powers, all evil Works, and\neven all evil things : Yet tis remarkable the\nDevil is no old Teftament word, and we never\nfind it ufed in all that part of the Bible but four\ntimes, and then not once in the fingular number, and\nnot once to fignify Satan as tis now underftood.\nIt is true, the Learned give a\ngreat many differ\ning interpretations of the word Devil ; the Eng-\nlijh Commentators tell us, it means a deftroyer,\nothers that it\nfignifies a deceiver, and the Greeks\nderive it from a Calumniator or falfe witnefs j for we\nfind that Calumny was a Goddefs^ to whom the\nAthenians built altars and offer d facrifices upon\nfome folemn occafions, and they call her Aia\/Bo^rj\nfrom whence came the mafculine Aidfiohos which\nwe translate Devil.\nThus we take the name of Devil to fignify not\nperfons only, but actions and habits 5 making ima\nginary Devils, and transforming that fubflantial\ncreature call d DEVIL into every thing noxious\nand offenfive : Thus St. Francis being tempted\nby the Devil in the fhape of a bag of money lying\nin the highway, the Saint having difcover d the\nfraud, whether feeing his Cloven-foot hang out\nof the purfe, or whether he diftinguifh d him by\nhis fmell of fulphur* or how otherwile, authors arc\nnot agreed ; but, I fay, the Saint having difco\nver d the cheat, and out-witted the Devilj took\noccafion to preach that eminent fermon to his\ndifciples,\n\f42, The H I S T O R Y\ndifciples, where his Text was, Money is THE\nDEVIL.\nNor, upon the whole, is\nany wrong done to the\nDevil by this kind of treatment, it\nonly gives\nhim the fovereignty of the whole army of Hell,\nand making ail the numberlefs legions of the bot-\ntomlefs pit lervants j or, as the Scripture calls them,\nAngels to Satan the grand Devil &amp;gt;\nall their ac\ntions, performances and atchievements are juftly\nattributed to him, not as the prince of Devils only,\nbut the Emperor of Devils -,\nthe prince of all\nthe princes of Devils.\nUnder this denomination then of DEVIL, all the\nPowers of Hell, all the Princes of the air, all the\nblack armies of Satan are comprehended, and in\nfuch manner they are to be underilood in this whole\nwork ; mutatis mutandi^ accoiding to the feveral\ncircurn fiances of which we are to ipeak of them.\nThis being premised, and rny authority being fo\ngood, Satan muil not take it ill, if I treat him\nafter the manner of men, and give him thofe titles\nwhich he is belt known by among us &amp;gt;\nfor indeed\nhaving fo\nmany, tis not very eafy to call him out\nof his name.\nHowever, as I am oblig d by the duty of an\nHiflorian to decency as well as impartiality, fo I\nthought it\nneceffary, before I ufed too much free\ndom with Satart) to produce authentick Docu\nments, and bring antiquity upon the ibge, to jufti-\nfy the manner of my writing, and let\nyou fee I\niliall defcribe him in no colours, nor call him by\nany name, but what he has been known by for\nmany ages before me.\nAnd now, though writing to the common\nunder{binding of my Readers, I am oblig d to\ntreat Satan very coarily, and to fpeak of him in\nthe common acceptation, calling him plain Devil^\na word which in this mannerly age is not fo.fono-\nrous\n\fof the &quot;DEVI L: 4j\nrous as others might be, and which by the error\nof the Times is\napt to prejudice us againft his Per-\nfonj yet it muft be acknowledg d he has a great\nmany other names and firnames which he might\nbe known by, of a lefs obnoxious import than\nthat of Devil) or Deflroyer, 8tc.\nMr. Milton* indeed, wanting titles of honour\nto give to the Leaders of Satan s\nHolt, is\noblig d to\nborrow feveral of his Scripture names, and beflow\nthem upon his infernal Heroes, whom he makes\nthe Generals and Leaders of the armies of Hell &amp;gt;\nand fo he makes Beelzebub, Lucifer, Belial, Mam\nmon, and fome others, to be the names of parti\ncular Devils, members of Satan s upper houfe or\nPandemonium \\ whereas indeed, thefe are all names\nproper and peculiar to Satan himfelf.\nThe Scripture alfo has fome names of a coar-\nfer kind, by which the Devil is\nunderftood, as\nparticularly, which is noted already, in the Apoca-\nlypfe he is call d the Great Red Dragon, \\hzBeafl,\nthe Old Serpent, and the like : But take it in the\nScripture, or where you will in\nHiflory facred or\nprophane, you will find that in general the De\nvil is,\nas I have faid above, his ordinary name in\nall languages and in all nations &amp;gt;\nthe name by which\nhe and his works are principally diftinguifli d : Alfa\nthe Scripture, befides that it often gives him\nthis name, fpeaks of the works of the Devil^\nof the fubtilty of the Devil, of cafting out De\nvils, of being tempted of the Devil, of being pof?\n(efs d with a Devil, and fo many other expreffions\nof that kind, as I have faid already, are made ufe\nof for us to underftand the evil Spirit by, that in a\nword. Devil is the common name of all wicked\nSpirits: For Satan is no more the Devil, as if\nhe alone was fo, and all the reft were a diminutive\nfpecies who did not go by that name&amp;gt; But, I\nfay,\neven in Scripture, every Spirit, whether under his\nDomi-\n\f44 The HIS TORY\nDominion or out of his Dominion, is called the\nDevil, and is as much a real Devil, that is to fay,\na condemned Spirit, and employ d in the fame\nwicked work as Satan himfelf.\nHis Name then being thus afcertain d, and hk\nExiftence acknowledged, it fhould be a little en-\nquir d what be is ; we believe there is fuch a\nthing,\nfuch a creature as the Devil, and that he has\nbeen, and may Hill with propriety of fpeech, and\nwithout injuflice to his Character be call d by his\nantient name Devil.\nBut who is he ? what is his\noriginal ? whence\ncame he ? and what is his prefent ftation and con\ndition? for thefe things and thefe enquiries are\nvery neceflciry to his Hiftory, nor indeed can any\npart of his Hiiiory be compleat without them.\nThat he is of an antient and noble original muft\nbe acknowledged, for he is\nHeaven-born, and\nof Angelic Race, as has been touch d already : If\nScripture-evidence may be of any weight in the\nqueftion, there is no room to doubt the genealogy\nof the Devil; he is not only fpoken of as an An\ngel^\nbut as a fallen Angel\\ one that had been in\nHeaven, had beheld the face of GOD in his full\neffulgence of glory, and had furrounded the\nThrone of the mod High j from whence, com\nmencing rebel and being expell d, he was caft\ndown, down, down, GOD and the Devil himfelf\nonly knows where $ for indeed we cannot fay that\nany man on Earth knows it j and wherever it\nis,\nhe has ever fince man s creation been a plague to\nhim, been a tempter, a deluder, a calumniator,\nan enemy and the objecl: of man s horror and a-\nverfion.\nAs his original is Heaven-born^ and his Race\nAngelic, fo the Angelic nature is\nevidently plac d\nin a clafs fupcrior to the human, and this the Scrip\nture is exprefs in alfp 3 when fpeaking of man,\nit\n\f*fthe DEVIL; 4.5\nit fays,\nhe made him a little lower than the An\ngels.\nThus the Devil, as mean thoughts as you may\nhave of him, is of a better family than any of\nyou, nay than the beft Gentleman of you allj\nwhat he may be fallen to, is one thing^ but what\nhe is fallen from, is another, and therefore I mud\ntell my learned and reverend friend J. W. LL. D.\nwhen he fpoke fo rudely of the Devil lately. That\nin my opinion he abus d his Betters.\nNor is the Scripture more a help to us in the\nfearch after the Devil s\nOriginal, than it is in our\nfearch after his Nature : it is true, Authors are\nnot agreed about his age, what time he was crea\nted, how many years he enjoy d his (late of blef-\nfednefs before he fell j or how many years he con\ntinued with his whole army in a ftate ofdarknefs,and\nbefore the creation of man. Tisfuppofed it\nmight\nbe a confiderable fpace, and that it was a part of\nhis punifhment too, being all the while una&ive, un-\nemploy d, having no bufinefs, nothing to do but\ngnawing his own Bowels, and rolling in the ago\nny of his own felf-approaches, being a Hell to\nhimfelf in reflecting on the glorious ftate from\nwhence he was fallen.\nHow long he remained thus, tis true, we have\nno light into from Hiftory, and but little from Tra\ndition 5 Rabbi Judah fays, the Jews were of the\nopinion, that he remained twenty thoufand years\nin that condition, and that the World {hall con\ntinue twenty thoufand more, in which he {hall\nfind work enough to fatisfy his mifchievous de-\nfires ; but he fhews no authority for his opi\nnion.\nIndeed let the Devil have been as idle as\nthey\nthink he was before, it muft be acknowledged that\nnow he is the moil bufy, vigilant and diligent,\nof all\nGOD S\n\f46 The HIST O RY\nGOD S creatures, and very full of employment too?\nfitch as it is.\nScripture indeed, gives us light into the en\nmity there is between the two natures, the Dia\nbolical and the Human 5 the reafon of it, and how\nand by what means the power of the Devil is re\ntrain d by the Mejffias , and to thofe who are wil\nling to truft to Gofpel-light, and believe what the\nScripture fays of the Devil^ there may much of\nhis Hiftory be difcover d, and therefore thofe\nthat lift\nmay go there for a fuller account of the\nmatter.\nBut to referve all Scripture-evidence of thefe\nthings, as a Magazine in ftore for the ufe of thofe\n\\vith whom Scripture- teftimony is of force, I mult\nfor the prefent turn to other enquiries, being now\ndirecting my flory to an age, wherein to be driven\nto Revelation and Scripture-afTertions is efleem d\nfiving\nup the difputej people now-a-days muft\nave demonftration $ and in a word, nothing will\nfatisfy the age, but fuch evidence as\nperhaps the na\nture of the queftion will not admit.\nIt is hard, indeed, to bring demonftrations in\nfuch a cafe as this: No man has feen GOD at any\ntime, fays the fcripture, i\nJohn iv. 12,. So the\nDevil being a fpirit incorporeal, an Angel of\nlight, and confequently not vifible in his own\nfubftance, nature and form, it\nmay in fome fenfe\nbe faid, no man has feen the Devil at any time 5 all\nthofe pretences of phrenziful and fanciful people,\nwho tell us, they have feen the Devil9 I {hall ex\namine, and perhaps expofe by themfelves.\nIt\nmight take up a great deal of our time here,\nto enquire whether the Devil has any particular\nfhape or perfonality of fubftance, which can be\nvifible to us, felt, heard, or underftood &amp;gt;\nand which\nhe cannot alter, and then, what fhapes or appear\nances the Devil has at any time taken upon him ;\ni and\n\fof the DEVIL; 4 ?\nand whether he can really appear in a body which\nmight be handled and feen, and yet fo as to know\nit to have been the Demi at the time of his ap\npearing 5 but this alfo I defer as not of weight in\nthe prefent enquiry.\nWe have divers accounts of Witches conver\nging with \/^? Devil; the Devil in a real body, with\nall the appearance of a body of a man or wo\nman appearing to them &amp;gt;\nalfo of having a Familiar,\nas they call it, an Incubus or little Devil, which\nfucks their bodies, runs away with them into the\nair, and the like : Much of this is faid, but much\nmore than it is\neafy to prove, and we ought\nto give but a juft proportion of credit to thofe\nthings.\nAs to his borrow d fhapes and his fubtle tranf-\nformings, that we have fuch open tefttmony of^\nthat there is no room for any queftion about it &amp;gt;\nand when I come to that part, I fhall be obliged\nrather to give a hiftory of the fact, than enter\ninto any difTertation upon the nature and reafon\nof it.\nI do not find in any author, whom we can call\ncreditable, that even in thofe countries where the\ndominion of Satan is more particularly eftablifh d,\nand where they may be faid to worfhip him in a\nmore particular manner, as a Devil &amp;gt;\nwhich fome\ntell us the Indians in America, did, who worihip d\nthe Devil that he might not hurt them j yet, Ijay9\nI do not find that even there the Devil appear d to\nthem in any particular conilant fhape or perfona-\nlity peculiar to himfelf.\nScripture and Hiftory therefore, giving us no\nlight into that part of the queftion, I conclude and\nJay it down, not as my opinion only, but as what\nall\nages feem to concur in, that the Devil has no\nParticular\nbody 5 that he is a fpirit,\nand that tho*\ne may, Proteus like, aflumc the appearance of\neither\n\f4 S The HI STORY\neither man or beaft, yet it muft be fome borrowed\nfhape, fome aflum d figure, pro hac vice, and that\nhe has no vifible body of his own.\nI thought it needful to difcufs this as a prelimi\nnary, and that the next difcourfe might go upon\na certainty in this grand point ; namely, that the\nDevil, however, he may for his particular occafions\nput himfelfinto a great many fhapes,and clothe him\nfelf, perhaps, with what appearances he pleafes,\nyet that he is himfelf ftill ameer Spirit, that he re\ntains the feraphic Nature, is not vifible by our eyes,\nwhich are human and Organic, neither can he\nact with the ordinary Powers, or in the ordinary\nmanner as bodies do j and therefore, when he has\nthought fit to defcend to the meannefles of di-\nCurbing and frightning children and old women,\nby noifes and knockings, diflocating the chairs\nand flools, breaking windows, and fuch like little\nambulatory things, which would feem to be below\nthe dignity of his character, and which in\nparti\ncular, is\nordinarily performed by organic Powers 5\nyet even then he has thought fit not to be\/een,\nand rather to make the poor people believe he had\na real fhape and body, with hands to act, mouth\nto fpeak, and the like^ than to give proof of it in\ncommon to the whole World, by mewing him\nfelf, and acting vifibly and openly, as a body ufu-\nally and ordinarily does.\nNor is it any difadvantage to the Devil, that his\nSeraphic nature is not confined or impriibn d in a\nbody or fhape, fuppofe that fhape to be what\nmonftrous thing we would j for this would, indeed,\nconfine his actings within the narrow fphere of the\norgan or body to which he was limited j and tho*\nyou were to fuppofe the body to have wings for\na velocity of Motion equal to fpirir, yet if it\nhad not a power ofinvifibility too, and a capacity\nof conveying it felfj undifcovcr d, into all the fe-\ncrct\n\fof the DEVI L. 49\ncretrecefles of mankind, and the fame fecretarto^\ncapacity\nof infinuation, fuggeftion, accusation, &V.\nby which his wicked defigns are now propagated,\nand all his other devices affifted, by which he de\nludes and betrays mankind $ I fay,\nhe would be no\nmore a Devil, that is a Dcftroyer, no more a De\nceiver, and, no more a Satan, that is, a dangerous\nArch enemy to the fouls of men &amp;gt;\nnor would it be\nany difficulty to mankind to ihun and avoid him,\nas I fhall make plain in the other part of his Hi-\nftory.\nHad the Devil from the beginning been embodi\ned, as he could not have been invifible to us, whole\nfouls\nequally feraphic are only prefcrib d by being\nembody d and encas d in fleih and blood as we are j\nfo he would have been no more a Devil to any\nbody but hirnfelf: Theimprifonmentina body, had\nthe powers of that body been all that we can con\nceive to make him formidable to us, would yet have\nbeen a Hell to him 5 confidjer him as a conquer d\ncxafperated Rebel, retaining all that fury and fwel-\nling ambition, that hatred of God, and envy at his\ncreatures which dwells now in his\nenrag d fpifit\nas\na Devil: yet fuppofe him to have been condemn d\nto organic Powers, confin d to corporeal motion,\nand reftrain d as a Body muft be fuppofed to re-\nftrain a Spirit; it muft, at the fame time, fuppofe\nhim to be effectually diiabled from all the me\nthods he is now allow d to makeufe of, for exert\ning his rage and enmity againft God, any farther\nthan as he might fuppofe it to afFeft his Maker at\nfecond hand, by wounding his Glory thro the\nfides of his weakeft creature, MAN.\nHe muft, certainly, be thus confin d, becaufe\nBody can only act upon Body, not upon Spirit ; no\nfpecies being empower d to aft out of the com-\npafs of its own fphere: He might have been em\npower d, indeed, to have a&ed terrible and even de-\nE flruftive\n\f50 The HISTORY\nftru6Hve things upon mankind, efpecially if this\nbody had any powers given it which mankind had\nnot, by which man would be overmatch d and\nnot be in a condition of felf-defence 3 for exam\nple, fuppofe him to have had wings to have flown\nin the air j Or to be invulnerable, and that no human\ninvention, art, or engine could hurt, erifnare, capti\nvate, or reftrain him.\nBut this is to fuppofe the righteous and wife\nCreator to have made a creature and not be able\nto defend and prefcrve him &amp;gt;\nor to have left him de-\nfencclefs to the mercy of another of his own\ncreatures, whom he had given power to deftroy\nhim j This indeed, might have occaiion d a gene\nral idolatry, and made mankind, as the Americans\ndo to this day, worfhip the D&vil^ that he might\nnot hurt them , but it could not have prevented\nthe deftruftion of mankind, fuppofing the Devil\nto have had malice equal to his power: and he\nmult put on a new nature, be compaffionate, ge\nnerous, beneficent, and fteadily good in fparing tfie\nrival enemy he was able to deftroy, or he muft\nhave ruin d mankind :\nInjhort^ he muft have ceas d\nto have been a Devil, and muft have re-arTum d his\noriginal, Angelic, heavenly nature 5 been fill d with\nthe principles of love to, and delight in the Works\nof his Creator, and bent to propagate his Glory and\nJntereft 5 or he muft have put an end to the race\nof man, whom it would be in his Power to deftroy,\nand oblige his Maker to create a new fpecies, or\nfortify the old with fome kind of defence, which\nmuft be invulnerable, and which his fiery darts\ncould not penetrate.\nOn this occafion differ me to make an excur-\nfion from the ufual ftile of this Work, and with\nibme folemnity to exprefs my Thoughts thus :\nHow glorious is the wifdom and goodnefs of\nthe great Creator of the World ! in thusrellrain-\ning\n\fof the D E V I L. 51\ning thefe feraphic OUTCASTS from the power of\nafluming human or organic bodies ! which could\nthey do, envigorating them with the fupernatural\nPowers, which, as Seraphs and Angels, they now\npoilefsand might exert, they would be able even to\nfright mankind from the face of vhe Earth, and to\ndeilroy and confound God s Creation 3 nay, even as\nthey are^ were not their power limited, they might\ndeitroy the Creation it felf, reverfe and over-turn\nnature, and put the World into a general confla\ngration : But were thofe immortal Spirits embodi\ned, tho they were not permitted to confound na\nture, they would be able to harrafs poor weak and\ndefenceleis man out of his wits, and render him\nperfectly ufelefs, either to his Maker or himfelf.\nBut the Dragon is chained, the Devil s Power\nis limited) he has indeed a vaftly extended Em\npire, being Prince of the Air, having, at leafl,\nthe whole Atmofphere to range in, and how far\nthat Atmofphere is extended, is not yet afcertain d\nby the niceft obfervations 3 I fay at leaft^ becaufe\nwe do not yet know how far he may be allow d\nto make excurfions beyond the Atmofphere of\nthis Globe into the planetary Worlds, and what\npower he may exercife in all the habitable parts of\nthe filarfyfletn$ nay, of all thetotlierfolarjyfowf9\nwhich, for ought we know, may exift in the\nmighty extent of created fpace, and of which you\nmay hear farther in its order.\nBut let his power be what it will there, we arc\nfure tis limited here, and that in two particulars j\nfirft, he is limited as above, from affuming body\nor bodily fhapes with fub fiance ; and fecondly, from\nexerting feraphic Powers, and a&ing with that fu\npernatural force, which, as an Angel, he was cer\ntainly veiled with before the fall, and which we\nare not certain is\nyet taken from him -\ny or at moir,\nwe do not know how much it\nmay or may not be\nE 2, dimininYd\n\f52 The H I ST O R Y\ndimininYd by his degeneracy, and by the blow\ngiven him at his expuldon : this we are certain,\nthat be his Power greater or lefs, he is reltrain d\nfrom the exercife of it in this World 5 and he, who\nwas one equal to the Angel who kill d 180000\nmen in one night, is not able now, without a new\ncommiffion, to take away the life of one Job^ nor\nto touch any thing he had.\nBut letusconfiderhim then limited and reflrain-\ned as he is, yet he remains a mighty, a terrible, an\nimmortal Being 3 infinitely fuperior to man, as well\nin the dignity of his nature, as in the dreadful\npowers he retains ftili about him 5 it is true the\nbrain-fick heads of our Enthufiafticks paint him\nblacker than he is, and, as I have faid, wickedly\nreprefent him clothed with terrors that do not\nreally belong to him &amp;gt;\nas if the power of good and\nevil was wholly vefted in him,and that he was plac\ned in the Throne of his Maker, to diftribute both\npuniiliments and rewards 3 In this they are much\nwrong, terrifying and deluding fanciful people a-\nbout him, till they turn their heads, and fright\nthem into a belief that the Devil will let them\nalone, if they do fuch and fuch good things &amp;gt;\nor\ncarry them away with him they know not whither,\nif they do not -,\nas if the Devil, whofe proper\nbufinefs is mifchief, feducing and deluding man\nkind, and drawing them, in to be rebels like him-\nfelf, fhould threaten to feize upon them, carry\nthem away, and in a word, fall upon them to\nhurt them, if\nthey did evil, and on the contrary,\nbe favourable and civil to them, if they did well.\nThus a poor deluded country fellow in our\nTown, that had liv d a wicked, abominable, de-\nbauch d life, was frighted with an Apparition, as\nhe calPd it, ofthe Devil;

In all which Satan could\nnot be fool enough not to know that lie ihould\nbe\n\f58 The HISTORY\nbe difappointed by the fame Power which had fo\neminently counter-a6ted his rage before.\nBut, I believe, the Devil went upon a much\nmore probable defign -,\nand tho he may be faid to act\nupon a meaner principle than that of pointing his\nrage at the perfonal glory of his Creator j yet I\nown, that in my opinion, it was by much the\nmore rational undertaking, and more likely to fuc-\nceed 5 and that was, that whereas he perceived this\nnew fpecies of creatures had a fublime as well as a,\nhuman part, and were made capable of pofleffing\nthe manlions of eternal Beatitude, from whence,\nhe (Satan) and his Angels were e^pell\nd and irre\ntrievably banifh d j envy at fuch a rival mov d him\nby all\npoflible artifice, for he faw him deprived of\ncapacity to do it by force^ to render him unworthy\nlike himfelf} that bringing him to fall into re\nbellion and difobedience, he might fee his Rival\ndamn d with him &amp;gt;\nand thofe who were intended\nto fill\nup the empty fpaces in Heaven, made fo by\nthe abfence of fo many millions of fallen Angels,\nbe caft out into the fame darknefs with them.\nHow he came to know that this new fpecies of\ncreatures were liable tor fuch imperfection, is beft\nexplained by the Devil s\nprying, vigilant difpofi-\ntion, judging or leading him to judge by himfelfj\n(for he was as near being infallible as any of God s\ncreatures had been) and then inclining him to try\nwhether it was fo or no.\nModern Naturalifts, efpecially fome who have\nnot fo large a chanty for the fair fex, as I have, tell\nus, that as foon as ever Satan faw the woman, and\nlook d in her face, he faw evidently that fhe\nwas the beft form d creature to make a Tool of^\nand the beft to make a hypocrite of, that could be\nmade, and therefore the moft fitted for his purpofe.\ni.

He has made fine Speeches\nboth ht- God and the Devil^ and a little addition\nmight\n\fof the DEVIL. 69\nmight have turnM it a la modern into a Harlequin\nDieu 6f Diable.\nI confefs I don t well know how far the do\nminion of Poetry extends itfelf 5 it feems the Buts.\nand Bounds of Parnaffus are not yet afcertaind ;\nfo that for ought I know, by vcrtue of their an-\ntienc privileges call d Licenlia Poetarum, there can\nbe no Blafphemy in Verfe &amp;gt;\nas fome of our Divines\nfay there can be no Treafon in the Pulpit. But\nthey that will venture to write that way, ought\nto be better fatisfy\nd about that Point than I am.\nUpon this foot Mr. Milton, to grace his Poem,\nand give room for his Towring Fancy, has\ngone a length beyond all that ever went before\nhim, fince Ovid in his Metamorphofis. Fie has\nindeed complimented GOD Almighty with a flux\nof lofty words, and great founds 5 and has made a\nvery fine Story of the Devil, but he has made a\nmeerje ne fcay Quoi of Jefus Chrift. In one line\nhe has him riding on a Cherub, and in ano\nther fitting on a Throne, both in the very fame\nmoment of action. In another place he has\nbrought him in making a Speech to his Saints,\nwhen tis evident he had none there &amp;gt;\nfor we all\nknow Man was not created till a long while after j\nand no body can be fo dull as to fay the Angels\nmay be called Saints, without the greateft abfar-\ndity in nature. Befides, he makes CHRIST him-\nfelf diftinguifh them, as in two feveral Bands,\nand of differing Perfons and Species, as to be fure\nthey are.\nStand ftill in bright array, ye Saints\n______ Here ftand,\n2? Angels.\nPar. Loft, lib, \\\\.fo. 174.\nF 3 So\n\f70 The HISTORY\nSo that CHRIST here is\nbrought in drawing up his\nArmy before the laft Battle, and making a\nSpeech\nto them, to tell them they fhall only ftand by\nin warlike order, but that they fhall have no oo\ncaflon to fight, for he alone will engage the Re\nbels. Then in embattling his\nLegions, he places\nthe Saints here, and the Angels there, as if one\nwere the main Battle of Infantry, and the other\nthe Wings of Cavalry. But who are thole Saints?\nthey are indeed all of Milton s own making -,\ntis\ncertain there were no Saints at all in Heaven or\nEarth at that time j GOD and his Angels fill d up\nthe place &amp;gt;\nand till fome of the dngels fell, and\nMen were created, had liv d, and were dead, there\ncould have been no Saints there. Saint Abel was\ncertainly the Proto-Saint of all that ever were feen\nin Heaven^ as well as the Proto-martyr of all that\nhave been upon Earth.\nJuft fuch another Mifhke, not to call it a Blun\nder, he makes about Hell; which he not only\nmakes LOCAL, but gives it a\nbeing before the Fall\nof the Angels &amp;gt;\nand brings it in\nopening its mouth\nto receive them. This is fo contrary to the na\nture of the thing, and fo great an abfurdity, that\nno Poetic Licenfe can account for it j for tho Poefie\nmay form Stories, as Idea and Fancy may furnifh\nMaterials, yet Pocty muft not break in upon Chro\nnology, and make things which in time were to\nexift, act before they exifled.\nThus a Painter may make a fine piece of Work,\nthe fancy may be good, the ftrokes mafterly, and\nthe beauty of the Workmanfhip inimitably curi\nous and fine, and yet have fome unpardonable im\nproprieties which marr the whole Work. So\nthe famous Painter of Toledo painted the ftory of\nthe three Wifemen of the Eafl coming to wor-\n{hip, and bring their prefents to our Lord upon his\nbirth at Bethlehem^ where he reprefents them as\nthree\n\f.of the DEVIL. 71\nthree Arabian or Indian Kings 5 two of them are\nwhite, and one black 5 ^But unhappily when he\ndrew the latter part of them kneeling, which to\nbe fure was done after their fac.es 5 their legs\nbeing neceflarily a little intermix d, he made three\nblack feet for the Negroe King, and but three white\nfeet for the two white Kings, and yet never difco-\nver d the miftake till the piece was preferred to\nthe King, and hung up in the great Church. As\nthis is an unpardonable error in Sculpture or Lim\nning, it muft be much more fo in Poetry, where\nthe Images muft have no improprieties, much lefs\ninconfiftencies.\nIn a word, Mr. Milton has indeed made a fine\nPoem, but it is the Devil of a Hiftory. I can ea-\nlily\nallow Mr. Milton to make Hills and Dales,\nflowry Meadows and Plains (and the like) in Hea\nven &amp;gt;\nand places of Retreat and Contemplation in\nHell; tho I muft add, that it can be allowed to no\nPoet on Earth but Mr. Milton. Nay, I will allow\nMr. Milton^ if you pleafe, to fet the Angels a dancing\nin Heaven^ lib. v. fo. 138. and the Devils a fing-\ning in Hell, lib. i.\nfo. 44. tho they are in ihort,\nefpecially the laft,moft horrid Abfurdities.

But we fhall find fo many more\nof thele things in Mr. Milton^ that really taking\nnotice of them all, would carry me quite out of\nmy way, I being at this time not writing the\nHiftory of Mr. Milton^ but of the Devil: befides,\nF 4 Mr.\n\f72 The HISTORY\nMr. Milton is fuch a celebrated Man, that who but\nhe that can write the Hiftory of the Devil dare\nmeddle with him ?\nBut to come back to the bufinefs. As I had can-\ntion d you againtl running to Scripture for fhel-\nter in cafes of difficulty, Scripture weighing ve\nry little\namong the people I am directing my\nSpeech to 5 fo indeed Scripture gives but very lit\ntle light into any thing ofthe Devil s\nStory before\nhis Fall, and but to very little of it for fome time\nafter.\nNor has Mr. Milton faid one word to folve the\nmain difficulty (viz.) How the Devil came to\nfall, and how Sin came into Heaven , how the\nfpotlefs feraphic Nature could receive infection,\nwhence the contagion proceeded, what noxious\nmatter could emit corruption there, how and\nwhence any vapour to poiibn the Angelick Frame\ncould rife\nup, or how it increased and grew up to\ncrime\/ But all this he paries over, and hurrying\nup that part in two or three words, only tells us,\n.\nhis Pride,\nHad caft him out of Heaven with all his Hoft\nOf rebel Angels, by whofe aid afpiring\nHe trufted to have equal d the moftHigh.\nlib. i.\nfo.

Here we muft bid Mr. Milton good night 5\nfor, In plain terms, he is in the dark about it, and\nfo we are all 3 and the mofl that can be faid, is, that\nwe know the fad is fo, but nothing of the nature\nor reafoh of it,&quot;\nBut\n\fof the DEVIL. 73\nBut to come to the Hiftory : The Angels fell,\nthey finn d (wonderful*!) in Heaven, and God\ncafl them out j what their fin was is not explicit,\nbut in general tis call d a Rebellion againftGoD j\nall fin mull be To.\nMr. Milton here takes upon him to give the Hi\nftory of it, as particularly as if he had been born\nthere, and came down hither on purpofe to give\nus an account of it $ (I hope he is better inform d\nby this time y) but this he does in fuch a manner,\nas joftles with Religion, and fhocks our Faith in fo\nmany points neceflary to be believ d, that we\nmull forbear to give up to Mr. Milton, or muft fet\nafide part of the iacred Text, in fuch a manner, as\nwill afllil fome people to fet it all afide.\nI mean by this, his invented Scheme of the\nSon s\nbeing declared in Heaven to be begotten\nthen, and then to be declar d Generalifiimo of all the\nArmies of Heaven 3 and of the Father s fummon-\ning all the Angels of the heavenly Hofl to fub-\nmit to him, and pay him homage. The words\nare quoted already, page 32.\nI mull own the Invention, indeed, is\nvery fine;\nthe Images exceeding magnificent, the Thought\nrich and bright, and, in fome refpecl:, truly fub-\nlime : But the Authorities fail mofl wretchedly,\nand the mifs-timing of it, is\nunfufferably grofs,\nas is noted in the Introduction to this Work 5\nfor Chrift is not declar d the Son of God but on\nEarth j tis true, tis\nfpoken from Heaven, but\nthen tis\nfpoken as perfected on Earth 5 if it was at\nall to be affign d to Heaven, it was from Eternity,\nand there, indeed, his eternal Generation is al-\nlow d 5 but to take upon us to fay, that On a da&amp;gt;}\\\na certain day^ for fo our Poet affiimes, lib. v.\nfbj. 137.\nc\nWhen on a day,\n-\n4\nOn fuch a day\n&amp;lt;As\n\f74 The HISTORY\nAs Heaven s\ngreat Year brings forth, the empy\nreal Hoft\nOf Angels by imperial Summons call d,\nForthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared.\nThis is, indeed, too grofs &amp;gt;\nat this meeting he\nmakes God declare the Son to be that day begot-\nten^ as before &amp;gt;\nhad he made him not begotten\nthat day, but declared General that day, it would\nbe reconcileable with Scripture and with fenfe 3 for\neither the begetting is meant of ordaining to an\noffice, or elfe the eternal Generation falls to the\nground 5 and if it was to the office (Mediator)\nthen Mr. Milton is out in afcribing another fix d\nday to the Work &amp;gt;\nfee lib. x. fo. 194.

And Milton can have no authority to tell\nus, there was any Declaration of it in Heaven be\nfore this, except it be that dull authority call d\nfoetlc Licenfej which will not pafs in fo folemn an\naffair as that.\nBut the thing was neceflary to Milton^ who\nwanted to affign fome caufe or original of the\nJDmTs Rebellion j and fo, as Ifaid above^ the de-\niign is well laid, it\nonly wants two Trifles call d\nTruth and Hiftory , fo I leave it to ftruggle for\nit felf.\nThis Ground-plot being laid, he has a fair field\nfor the Devil to play the Rebel in, for he imme\ndiately brings him in, not fatisfy d with the Ex\naltation of the Son of God. The cafe muft be\nthus 5 Satan being an eminent Arch-an^el, and\nperhaps, the higheft of all the Angelic Train,\nhearing this fovereign Declaration, that the Son\nvZ, Of\n\fof the DEVIL; 75\nof God wasdeclar d to be Head or Generaliflimo of\nall the heavenly Hoft, took it ill to fee another\nput into the high ftation over his head^ as the Sol\ndiers call it 3 he, perhaps, thinking himfelf the fe-\nni or Officer, and difdaining tofubmit to any but to\nhis former immediate Sovereign 3 in fhort, he threw\nup his Commiffion, and, in order not to be compel d\nto obey, revolted and broke out in open Rebellion.\nAll this part is a Decoration noble and great,\nnor is there any objection to be made againit the\ninvention, becaufe a deduction of probable Events j\nbut the Plot is\nwrong laid, as is obferv d above,\nbecaufe contradicted by the Scripture account,\naccording to which Chrift was declared in Hea\nven, not then, but from Eternity, and not declar\ned with power, but on Earth, (viz.) in his victory\nover Sin and Death, by the Refurre&ion from the\ndead : fo that Mr. Milton is not orthodox in this\npart, but lays an avow d foundation for the cor\nrupt Doctrine of Arius^ which fays, there was a\ntime when Chrift was not the Son of GOD,\nBut to leave Mr. Milton to his flights, I\nagree\nwith him in this part, viz. that the wicked or\nfinning Angels, with the great Arch-angel at the\nhead of them, revolted from their obedience, even\nin Heaven it felf 3 that Satan began the wicked\ndefection, and being a Chief among the heavenly\nHoft, confequently carry d over a great party with\nhim, who all\ntogether rebel d againft God 3 that\nupon this Rebellion they were (entenc d, by the\nrighteous judgment of GOD, to be expel d the\nholy Habitation 5 this, bcfides the authority of\nScripture, we have vifible teftimomes of, from\nthe Devils themfelves3 their influences and ope\nrations among us every day, of which Mankind\nare witneiTes 3 in all the merry things they do in his\nname, and under his prote&ion, in almoft every\nfcene of life\nthey pafe thro , whether we talk of\nthings\n\f76 The H I S T O R Y\nthings done openly or in Mafquerade, things done\nin or out of it, things done in earneft or in jell.\nBut then, what comes of the long and bloody\nWar that Mr. Milton gives fuch a full and parti\ncular account of, and the terrible Battels in Hea\nven between Michael with the royal Army of An\ngels on one hand, and Satan with his rebel Holt\non the other j in which he fuppofes the numbers\nand ilrength to be pretty near equal ? but at\nlength brings in the Devils Army, upon doubling\ntheir rage and bringing new engines of war into\nthe field, putting Michael and all the faithful Army\nto the Worfl &amp;gt;\nand, in a word, defeats them? For\ntho they were not put to a plain flight, in which\ncafe he mutt, at lead, have given an account of\ntwo or three thoufand millions of Angels cut in\npieces and wounded, yet he allows them to give\nover the fight, and make a kind of retreat &amp;gt;\nfo\nmaking way for the compleat vidory of the Son\nof GOD : Now this is all invention, or at leaft, a\nborrow d thought from the old Poets, and the\nFight of the Giants againft Jupiter, fo nobly dc-\niign d by Ovid, almort two thoufand years ago &amp;gt;\nand there twas well enough ; but whether Poetic\nFancy fhould be allow d to fable upon Heaven, or\nno, and upon the King of Heaven too, that I\nleave to the Sages.\nBy this expuliion of the Devils, it is allow d\nby moil z^uthors, they are, ipfofaffo, ftript of the\nRectitude and Holinefs of their Nature, which\nwas their Beauty and Perfection 5 and being in-\ngulph d in the abyfs of irrecoverable ruin, tis\nno matter where, from that very time they lolt\ntKeir Angelic beautiful Form, commenced ugly\nfrightful Monfters and Devils, and became evil\ndoers, as well as evil Spirits j fill d with a horrid\nmalignity and enmity againft their Maker, and\nwith a hellifh refblution to fhew and ex-\ni ert\n\fDEVIL; 77\ncrt it on all occafions , retaining however their\nexalted fpirituous Nature, and having a vail ex-\ntenfive power of Adion, all which they can ex\nert in nothing elfe but doing evil, for they are en\ntirely diverted of either Power or will to do good^\nand even in doing evil, they are under reflraints\nand limitations of a iuperior Power, which it is\ntheir Torment, and, perhaps, a great part of their\nHell that they cannot break thro .\nCHAP.

Si\nthe Earth^ &c, this, I fay, is\nplain, and if it be as\ncertain that Hell clofed upon them, I demand\nthen, how got he out? and why was there not a\nProclamation for apprehending him, as there uiual-\nly is, after fuch Rogues as break prifon ?\nIn fhort, the true Account of the Devil s Cir-\ncumftances, fince his Fall from Heaven, is much\nmore likely to be thus : That he is more ofa Vagrant\nthan aPrifoner, that he is a Wanderer in the wild\nunbounded Waft, where he and his Legions, like\nthe Hoords of fartary, who, in the wild Coun\ntries of Karakathay, the Deferts of Barkan, Kaffan,\nand dftracan, live up and down where they find\nproper 5 fo Satan and his innumerable Legions rove\nabout hie & ubique^ pitching their Camps (being\nBeafts of prey) where they find the moft\nSpoil j\nwatching over this World, (and all the other\nWorlds for ought we know, and if there are any\nfuch,) I fay watching, and feeking who they may\ndevour, that is, who they may deceive and delude,\nand fo deftroy, for devour they cannot.\nSatan being thus confin d to a\nvagabond, wan-\ndring, unfettl d Condition, is without any certain\nAbode j Fortho\n1\nhe has, in confequence of his An\ngelic Nature, a kind of Empire in the liquid Waft or\nAir \\ yet, this is\ncertainly part of his punifhment,\nthat he is\ncontinually hovering over this inhabited\nGlobe of Earth j fwellingwith the Rage of Envy,\nat the Felicity of his Rival, Man 5 and ftudyingali\nthe means poffible to injure and ruin him &amp;gt;\nbut ex\ntremely limited in Power, to his unfpeakable Mor\ntification : This is his prefent State, without any\nfix d Abode, Place, or Space, allowed him to reft\nthe Sole of his Foot upon.\nFrom his Expulfion, I take his firft View of\nHorror to be that, of looking back towards the\nHeaven which he had loll -\ny there to fee the\nChafrn or Opening made up, out at which, as at a\nG Breach\n\fS2, The HISTORY\nBreach in the Wall of the holy Place, he Wf:$\nthrall Head-long by the Power which expel d him *\nI fay, to fee the Breach repair d, the Mounds built\nup, the Walls garifon d with millions of Angels,\nand am d with Thunders 5 and, above all, made\nterrible by that Glory from whofe Prefence they\nwere expel d, as is\nPoetically hinted at before.\nUpon this fight, tis no wonder (if there was\nfuch a Place) that they fled till the Darknefs might\ncover them, and tha-t\nthey might be out of the\nView of fo hated a Sight.\nWherever they found it, you may be furc\nthey pitch d their fir ft\nCamp, and began, after\nmany a four Reflc6tion upon what was pafs d, to\nconfider and think a little, upon what was to\ncome.\nIf I had as much perfonal Acquaintance with\nthe Devil, as would admit it, and could depend\nupon the Truth ofwhat Anfwer he would give me,\nthe firft Queftion I would ask him, fhould be,,\nwhat Mealures they refolv d on at their firft AfTem-\nbly ? and the next fhould be, how they were em\nploy d in all that fpace of Time, between their fo\nflying the Face of their almighty Conqueror, and\nthe Creation of Man ? as for the Length of the\nTime, which, according to the Learn d, was\ntwenty thoufand Years, and according to the more\nLearned, not half a Quarter fo much, I would\nnot concern my Curioiky much about it $ tis\nmolt certain, there was a con fiderablc time between,\nbut of that immediately 3 firft let me enquire what\nthey were doing all that time.\nThe Devil and hisHoft, being thn?, I fay, call\nout of Heaven, and not yet confin d ftri&ly to\n7iW\/, tis\nplain they muft be (bme where : Satan\nand all his Legions did not lofe their Exiftcncc*\nno, nor the Exiftenee ofD^\/fr neither; GOD was\nib r;ir from annihilating him, that he ftill preferv d\nhis\n\fof the DEVIL. \/\nhis Being 5 and this not Mr. Milton only, but\nGob himfelf has made known to us, having left:\nhis Hi(lory fo far upon record &amp;gt;\nfeverai expreffions\nin Scripture alfo make it evident, as\nparticularly\nthe ftory of Job, mentioned before 3 the like in our\nSaviour s time, and feverai others.\nIf Hell did not immediately ingulph them, as\nMilton fuggefts, tis certain, I fay,\nthat they fled\nSomewhere, from the anger of Heaven,from the face\nof the Avenger j and his abfence, and their own\nguilt, wonder not at \/V, would make Hell enough\nfor them wherever they went.\nNor need we fly\nto the Dreams of our dflrorto*\nmers, who take a great deal of pains\nto fill\nup\nthe vafr.\nSpaces of the fhirry Heavens with in\nnumerable habitable Worlds &amp;gt;\nallowing as many\nfolar Syftems as there are fix d Stars, and that not\nonly in the known Conitcllations, but even inGW-\nlaxie it felf ; who, to every fuch Syftem allow a cer\ntain number of Planets, and to every one of thofe\nPlJnets fo many Satellites or Moons ,\nand all thefe\nPlanets and Moons to be Worlds &amp;gt; folid, dark, o-\nI\npaque Bodies, habitable, and (as they would have us\nbelieve) inhabited by the like Animals and rational\nI\nCreatures as on this Earth ; fo that they may, ac\nj\nthis rate, find room enough for the Devil and all\nI\nhis Angels, without making a Hell on purpofe j\nI\nnay they may, for ought I know, find a World\n|\nfor every Devil in all the Devil s\nHoft, and fo\n;\nevery one may be a Monarch or Mafter~Devil9\n\\\nfeparately in his own Sphere or World, and play\n; the Devil there by himfelf.\nAnd even if this were fo, it cannot be denied\nbut that one Devil in a place would be enough\nfor a whole fyftemary World, and be able, if not\nreftrained, to do mifchief enough there too, and\n;even to ruin and overthrow the t\nwhole body of\nPeople contain d in it.\nG z But,\n\f*4 The H I ST O R Y\nBut, I fay,\nwe need not fly to thefe fhifts, or\ncontult the Aftronomers in the decifion of this\npoint 5 for wherever Satan and his defeated Hoft\nwent, at their expulfion from Heaven^ we think\nwe are certain, none of all thefe Beautiful Worlds,\nor be they Worlds or no, I mean the fix d Stars,\nPlanets, &V. had then any exiftencej for the Be\nginning, as the Scripture calls it, was not yet\nBegun.\nBut to fpeak a little by the rules of Philofophy,\nthat is fo fay, fo as to be underflood by others,\neven when we fpeak of things we cannot fully\nunderfland ourfelves: Tho in the Beginning of\nTime all this glorious Creation was form d, the\nEarth, the (tarry Heavens, and all the Furniture\nthereof, and there was a Time when they were\nnot&amp;gt; yet we cannot fay fo of the Void, or that\nnamelefs no-tubere^ as I calPd it before, which\nnow appears to be zfome-where, in which thefe\nglorious Bodies are plac d.

So much for their Num\nber.\nHere alfo it would come in very aptly, to con-\nfider the date of that long interval between the\nTime of their Expulfion from Heaven^ and the\nCreation of the World ; and what the Poihirc\nof the Devil s Affairs might be, during that Time.\nThe horror of their Condition can only be con-\nceiv d of at a Didance, and efpccially by us, who\nbeing embodied Creatures, cannot fully judge of\nwhat is,\nor is not a Punifhment to Seraphs and\nSpirits-, But tis jud to fuppofe they fuffer d all\nthat Spirits\nof a Seraphic Nature were capable to\nfuftain, confident with their Exiftencej notwith-\nftanding which they retained dill the HeUiflmefs\nof their rebellious Principles 5 namely, their Ha\ntred and Rage againd God, and their Envy at\nthe Felicity of his Creatures.\nAs to how long their time might be, I fhall\nleave that Search &amp;gt;\nno lights being given me that\nG 4 arc\n\fS8 The H I S T O R Y\nare cither probable or rational, and we have fo\nlittle room to make a Judgment of it, that we\nmay as well believe Father M , who fuppofes\nit to be a hundred thoufand Years, as thofe who\njudge it one thoufand Years ; tis\nenough that we\nare fure, it was before the Creation, how long be\nfore is not material to the Devil s Hiftory^ unlcfs\nwe had fome Records of what happened\nto him,\nor was done by him in the Interval.\nDuring the wand ring Condition the Devil was\nin at that Time, we mayfuppofe, he and his whole\nClan to be employed in exerting their Hatred and\nRage at the Almighty, and at the Happinefs of\nthe remaining faithful Angels, by all the ways\nthey had power to iliew it.\nFrom this determin d Hated Enmity of Satan\nand his Hofl again ft GW, and at every thing that\nbrought Glory to his Name, Mr. Milton brings\nin Satan, (whenfirii hefaw Adam vti\nParadife^ and\nthe Felicity of his Station there) fwelling with\nRage and Envy, and taking up a dreadful Refo-\nlution to ruin Mam and all his Pofterity, meer-\nly to difappoint his Maker of the Glory of his\nCreation 5 I lhall come to fpeak of that in its\nPlace.\nHow Satan, in his remote Situation, got In\ntelligence of the Place whereto find Adam out,\nor that any fuch thing as a Man was created, is\nMatter of juft Speculation, and there might be\nmany rational Schemes laid for it: Mr. Milton\ndoes not undertake to tell us the Particulars, nor\nindeed could he find room for it ; perhaps,\nthe Devil having, as I have fiud, a Liberty to\nrange over the whole Void or Abyfs, which we\nwant as well a Name. for, as indeed Powers to\nconceive of; might have difcovered that the Al-\nmjghty Creator had form d a new and glorious\nWork, with infinite Beauty and Variety, filling\ni\nup\n\fof the DEVIL; S9\nup the immenfe Waft of Space, in which he,\n(the Devil) and his Angels^\nhad rov d for fo long\na time, without finding any thing to work on,\nor to exert their Apoftate Rage in againft their\nMaker.\nThat at length they found the infinite untrod\nden Space, on a Hidden fpread full with glori\nous Bodies, fhining in felf-exifting Beauty, with\na new, and to them unknown Luftre, cali d\nLight :\nThey found thefe luminous Bodies, tho\nimmenfe in Bulk, and infinite in Number, yet\nfixt in their wondrous Stations, regular and exact\nin their Motions, confin d in their proper Orbits,\ntending to their particular Centers, and enjoying\nevery one their peculiar Syftems, within which\nwas contained innumerable Planets with their\nSatellites or Moons, in which (again) a reciprocal\nInfluence, Motion and Revolution confpired to\nForm the mod admirable Uniformity of the\nwhole.\nSurprized, to be fure, with this fudden and\nyet glorious Work of the Almighty &amp;gt;\nfor the Cre\nation was enough, with its Luftre, even to fur-\nprize the Devils -, they might reafonably be fup-\npofed to ftart out of their dark Retreat, and with\na Curiofity not below the Seraphic Dignity 5 for\nthefe are fome of the things which the jfngels de-\nfire to look into, to take a flight thro all the ama\nzing Syflcms of the fix d Suns or Stars, which\nwe fee now but at a Diflance, and only make\nAilronomical Guefles at.\nHere the Devil found not fubject of Wonder\nonly, but matter to fwell his revolted Spirit\nwith more Rage, and to revive the Malignity ofhis\nMind againft his Maker, and efpecially againft\nthis new encreafe of Glory, which to his infinite\nRegret was extended over the whole Waft, and\nwhich he look d upon, as we fay in human Af\nfairs,\n\f90 The HISTORY\nfairs, as a Pays conquis^ or, if you will have it\nin the Language of the Devil, as an invafion up\non his Kingdom.\nHere it naturally occur d to them, in their\nState of Envy and Rebellion, that tho they could\nnot aflault the impregnable Walls of Heaven^\nand could no more pretend to raife War in the\nPlace of BlefFednefs and Peace &amp;gt;\nyet that per\nhaps they might find Room in this new, and\nhowever glorious, yet inferior Kingdom or Cre\nation, to work fome defpite to their great Crea\ntor, or to affront his Majefty in the Pcrfon of\nfome of his new made Creatures * and upon this\nthey may be jufHy fuppofed to double their Vi\ngilance, in the furvey they refolve to take of theie\nnew Worlds, however ercat, numbeiiefs and won\nderful.\nWhat Difcoverics they may have made in the\nother and greater Worlds, than this Earth, we\nhave not yet had an account 5 poffibly they are\nconverfant with other Parts or God s\nCreation,\nbcfidcs this little little Globe, which is but as\na Point in comparifon of the Rell j and with\nother of God s Creatures befides Man, who may,\naccording to the Opinion of our Philofophers, in\nhabit thofe Worlds ; but as no body knows that\nPart but the Devil^ we {hall not trouble our felves\nwith the Enquiry.\nRut tis\nvery rcafonable, and indeed probable,\nthat the Devils were more than ordinarily fur-\npriz d at the Nature and Reafon of all this\nglo\nrious Creation, after they had, with the utmoft\nCuriofity, view d all the parts of it 5 The Glories\nof the feveral Syftems; the immenfe fpaces iu\nwhich thofe glorious Bodies that were created and\nmade part of it, were allow d refpe&ively to move &amp;gt;\nthe innumerable fix d Stars, as fo many Suns in\n: Center of fo\nmany diftant Solar Syflems-, the\n(likewife\n\fof the DEVIL: 9I\n(likewife innumerable) dark opaque Bodies recei\nving light, and depending upon thofc Suns re-\nfpetively for fuch light, and then reflecting that\nlight again upon and tor the Ufe of one another ;\nTo fee the Beauty and Splendor of their Forms,\nthe Regularity of their Pofition, the Order and\nExactnefs, and yet inconcievable Velocity of their\nMotions, the certainty of their Revolutions, and\nthe Variety and Virtue of their Influences &amp;gt;\nand\nthen, which was even to the Devils themfelves\nmoil aflonifhing, That after all the red of their\nObfervations they fhould find this whole immenfe\nWork was adapted for, and made fubfervient to\nthe Ufe, Delight and Blefling only of one poor\nSpecies, in iticlf fmall, and in Appearance con\ntemptible -,\nthe meaner! of all the Kinds fuppo-\nfcd to inhabit fomany glorious Worlds, as appear\ned now to be form d -&amp;gt;\nI mean, that Moon call d the\nEarth, and the Creature call d Man 5 that all was\nmade for him, upheld by the wife Creator, on his\naccount only, and would necefTarily end an4\nceaie whenever that Species {hould end and be\ndctermin d.\nThat this Creature was to be found no where\nbut (as above) in one little individual Moon-,*. Spot\nleis than almofh any of the Moons, which were in\nfuch great Numbers to be found attendant upon,\nand prefcrib d with in every Syftem of the whole\ncreated Heavens 5 This was aftontfhing even to\nthe Devil himfelf, nay the whole Clan of Devils\ncould fcarce entertain any juft Ideas of the thing j\nTill at laft Satan^ indefatigable in his Search or En\nquiry into the Nature and Reafon of this new\nWork, and particularly fearching into the Spe\ncies of Man, whom he found God had thus\nplac d in the little Globe, call d Earth; he foon\ncame to an Eclairiciffement^ or a clear Underftand-\ning of the whole. For Example^\nFirft,\n\f9 z The HI ST O R Y\nHe found this Creature, call d Man,\nwas however mean and fmall in his Appea\nrance, a kind of a Seraphic Species j that he\nwas made in the very Image of God, endow\ned with reafonable Faculties to know Good\nand Evil, and poiTefs d of a certain thing till\nthen unknown and unheard of even in Hell it\nfelf ; that is,\nin the Habitation of Devils, let\nthat be where it would, (viz.)\n. That GOD had made him indeed of the low-\neft and coarfeft Materials, but that he had\nbreath d into him the Breath of Life, and\nthat he became a living thing call d SOUL,\nbeing a kind of an extraordinary heavenly\nand divine Emanation 3 and confequently\nthat Man, however mean and Terrefinal\nhis Body might be, was yet, Heaven-born,\nin his fpirituous Part compleatly Seraphic j\nand after a Space of Life here, (determined\nto be a ftate of probation) he fhould be tranf-\nlatcd thro the Regions of Death into a Life\npurely and truly Heavenly, and which fhould\nremain fo for ever 5 being capable of knowing\nand enjoying God his Maker, and (landing\nin his Pretence, as the glorified Angels do.\n. That he had the moll fublime Faculties infu-\nfed into him 5 was capable not only of know\ning and contemplating God, and which was\nilill more, of enjoying him, as above , but\n(which the Devil now was not) capable of\nhonouring and glorifying his Maker &amp;gt;\nwho\nnlfo had condeicended to accept of Ho\nnour from him.\n.\nAnd which was flill more, that being of an\nAngelic Nature, tho mix d with, and con-\nfin d for the prefent in a Cafe of mortal\nFlefli j he was intended to be removed from\nthis\n\fof the D E V I L. 9 j\nthis Earth after a certain time of Life here,\nto inhabit that Heaven, and enjoy that very\nGlory and Felicity, from which Satan and his\nAngels had been expell d.\nWhen he found all this, it\nprefently occur d\nto him, that God had done it all as an aft of\nTriumph over him (Satan,) and that thefe Crea\ntures were only created to people Heaven, depo\npulated or ftript of its inhabitants by his Expul-\nfion, and that thefe were all to be made Angels in\nthe Devil s ftead.\nIf this thought encreas d his Fury and Envy,\nas far jas Rage of Devils can be capable of being\nmade greater &amp;gt;\nit doubtlefs fet him on work to\ngive a Vent to that Rage and Envy, by fearching\ninto the Nature and Conftitution of this Crea\nture, calPd Man &amp;gt;\nand to find out whether he\nwas invulnerable, and could by no means be hurt\nby the Power of Hell, or deluded by his Sub-\ntilty 3 or whether he might be begun&quot;\nd and delu\nded, and fo, inftead of being prelerv d in Holi-\nnefs and Purity, wherein he was certainly crea\nted, be brought to fall and rebell as he (Satan)\nhad done before him &amp;gt;\nby which, inftead of be\ning tranfplanted into a glorious State, after this\nLife in Heaven, as his Maker had defign d him\nto be, to fill\nup the Angelic Choir, and fup-\nply the Place from whence he (Satan) had fallen,\nhe might be made to fall alfo like him, and in a\nWord, be made a Devil like himfelf.\nThis convinces us that the Devil has not loft\nhis natural Powers by his Fall; and our learned\nCommentator Mr. Pool is of the fame Opinion j\ntho he grants that the Devil has loft his moral\nPower, or his Power of doing Good, which he\ncan never recover. Tide Mr. Pool upon Afts\nxix. 17. where we may particularly obferve^\nwhen\n\f94 The H I S T O R Y\nwhen the Man poflefs\nd with an evil Spirit\nflew upon the feven Sons of Swua the Jew^\nwho would have Exorcis d them in the Name\nof Jeftts, without the Authority of Jefus9\nor\nwithout Faith in him &amp;gt;\nHe flew on them and maf-\nter d them, fo that they fled out of the Houfe\nfrom the Devil conquered, naked and wounded :\nBut of this Power of the Devil I fhall fpeak bv\nit felf.\nIn a Word, and to fum up all the Devil s\nStory\nfrom his firft Expulfion, it Hands thus : For fa\nmany Years as were between his Fall and the Cre\nation of Man, tho we have no Memoirs of his par\nticular Affairs, we have Reafon to believe he was\nwithout any Manner of Employment j but a cer\ntain tormenting Endeavour to be always expref-\nfing his\nRage and Enmity again ft Heaven 3 1 call\nit\ntormenting, Becaufe ever difappointed $ every\nthought about it\nproving empty j every attempt\ntowards it abortive j Leaving him only Light\nenough to lee ftill more and more Reafon to de-\nfpair of Succefs j and that this made his Condi\ntion ftill more and more a Hell than it was be\nfore.\nAfter a Space of Duration in this Mifery, which\nwe have no light given us to meafure or judge\nof, He at\nlength difcover d the new Creation of\nMan, as above, upon which he foon found Mat\nter to fet himielf to work upon, and has been\nbufily em ploy d ever fincc.\nAnd now indeed there may be room to fug-\ngeft a Local \/&\/\/, and the Confinement of Souls\n(made corrupt and degenerate by him) to it, as a\nPlace &amp;gt;\ntho he himfelf, as is ftill\napparent by his\nAftings, is not yet confin d to it -,\nof this Hell,\nits\nLocality, Extent, Dimenfions, Continuance\nand Nature, as it docs not belong to Satan s\nHiftory, I have a good excufe for faying nothing,\nand\n\fof the DEVIL; $*\nand.fo put off my meddling with that, which if\nI would meddle with, I could fay nothing of to\nthe Purpofe.\nCHAP. VIII.\nOf the &quot;Power\nof the Devil at the Time of\nthe Creation of this World ; whether it\nhas not been farther ftraitn d and limited\nJince that Time, and what Shifts andStra\ntagems he is obliged to make ufe ofto com-\npafs his ^Dejigns ufon Mankind.\nCUnning\nMen have fabled, and tho it be\nwithout either Religion, Authority or phy-\nfical Foundation, it\nmay be we may like it ne er\nthe worfefor that} that when God made the Stars\nand all the Heavenly Luminaries, the Devil, to\nmimick his Maker and infult his new Creation,\nmade Comets, in Imitation ofthe fix d Stars ; but\nthat the Compofition of them being combufti-\nble, when they came to wander in the Abyfs, rol\nling by an irregular ill-grounded Motion, they\ntook Fire, in their Approach tofome of thofe great\nBodies of Flame, the fix d Stars &amp;gt;\nand being thus\nkindled (like a Fire-work unskilfully let off) they\nthen took wild and excentrick, as alfo different\nMotions of their own, out of Satan s Dire&ion,\nand beyond his Power to regulate ever after.\nLet this Thought itand by it felf5\nit matters not\nto our purpofe whether we believe any thing of\nit, or no 5 tis\nenough to our Cafe, that if Satan\nhad any fuch Power then, he has no fuch Power\nnow, and that leads me to enquire into his more\nrecent Limitations,\nI am\n\f$6 The HI STORY\nI am to fuppofe, he and all his Accomplices\nbeing confounded at the Difcovery of the new\nCreation, and racking their Wits to find out the\nmeaning of it, had at lafl (no matter how) difco^\nver d the whole Syftem, and concluded, as I have\nfaid, that the Creature, caWd Man, was to be\ntheir SuccefTor in the Heavenly Manfions j upon\nwhich I fuggeft that the firft Motion ofHell was\nto deftroy this new Work, and, if poffible, to\noverwhelm it.\nBut when they came to make the Attempt, they\nfound their Chains were not long enough, and that\nthey could not reach to the Extremes ofthe Syftem :\nThey had no Power either to break the Order, or\nftop the Motion, diflocate the Parts, or confound\nthe Situation of Things 5 they traverfed, no doubt,\nthe whole Work, vifited every Star, landed upon\nevery Solid, and fail d upon every Fluid in the whole\nScheme, to fee what Mifchief they could do.\nUpon a long and full Survey, they came to this\nPoint in their Enquiry, that in fhort they could\ndo nothing by Force 3 that they could not dif-\nplace any Part, annihilate any Atom, or deftroy\nany Life in the whole Creation ; but that as Om\nnipotence had created it, fo the fame Omnipotence\nhad arm d it at all Points againft the utmoft Power\nof Hell, had made the fmalleft Creature in it invul\nnerable, as to Satan ; fo that without the Permiffion\nof the fame Power which had made Heaven, and\nconquered the Devil, he could do nothing at all, as\nto deftroying any thing that God had made, no,\nnot the little diminutive thing call d Man, who\nSatan faw fo much reafon to hate, as\nbeing created\nto fucceed him in Happinefs in Heaven.\nSatan found him placed out of his Power to hurt,\nor out of his Reach to touch 5 and here, by the\nway, appears the fecond Conqueft of Heaven over\nthe Devil; that having pluc d his Rival, as ic\nwere\n\fof the D E V I L. 97\nwere, juft before his Face, and fhew d the hate\nful %ht to him, he faw written upon his Image,\nTouch him if you dare.\n*It cannot be doubted, bur, had it not been thus,\nMan is fo fir from being a Match for the J)evil9\nthat one of Satan s leaft\nImps or Angels could deftroy\nall the Race of them in the World, ay World\nand all in a moment j\nAs he is Prince of the Power of the Air, taking\nthe Air for the Elementary World,\nhow eafily could\nhe, atoneBlaft, fweep all the Surface of the Earth\ninto the Sea, or drive weighty immenfe Surges of\nthe Ocean over the whole Plane of the Earth, and\ndeluge the Globe at once with a Storm ? Or how\neafily could he, who, by the Situation of the Em\npire, mull be fuppofed able to manage the Clouds,\ndraw them up, in fuch Pofition as fhould natu\nrally produce Thunders and Lightnings, caufethofe\nLightnings to blaft the Earth, dafli in Pieces all the\nBuildings, burn all the populous Towns and Ci\nties, and lay wait the World 5\nAt the fame time he might command fuited\nQuantities of fublimated Air to burft out of the\nBowels of the Earth, and overwhelm and fwailow\nup, in the opening Chafms, all the Inhabitants %L\nof the Globe?\nIn a Word, Satan left to himfelf as a Devil,\nand to the Power, which by virtue of his Sera\nphic Original he mult be veiled with, was able to\nhave made Devilifli Work in the World, if by a\nfuperior Power he was not reftrain d.\nBut there is no doubt, at haft to we, but that\nwith his fall from Heaven, as he loft the Recti\ntude and Glory of his Angelic Nature, 1 mean\nhis Innocence, fo he loft the Power too that he\nhad before -\ny and that when he fir ft commenced\nDevil, he received the Chains of Reftraint too,\nas the Badge of his Apoftacy, viz. a general Pro-\nH hibition,\n\f98 The HISTORY\nhibition, to do any thing to the Prejudice of\nthis Creation, or to aft any thing by Force or\nViolence without fpecial Permiffion.\nThis Prohibition was not fent him by a Mef-\nfenger, or by an Order in Writing, or proclaimed\nfrom Heaven by a Law ; but Satan^ by a ftrange,\ninvifible and unaccountable Imprefiion felt the\nReftraint within him ; and at the fame time that\nhis moral Capacity was not taken away, yet his\nPower of exerting that Capacity felt the Rc-\nftraint, and left him unable to do, even what he\nwas able to do at the fame time.\nI make no queftion, but the Devil is fenfiblc of\nthis Reilraintj that is to fay, not as it is a reftraint\nonly, or as an effeft of his Expulfion from Hea\nven ; But as it\nprevents his Capital Defign againft\nMan, who, for the Reafon I have given already,\nhe entertains a mortal Hatred of, and would de-\nftroy with all his Heart, if he might ; and therefore,\nlike a chain d MaflifF, we find him oftentimes\nmaking a horrid hellifli Clamour and Noife, bark\ning and howling, and frighting the People, letting\nthem know, that if he was loofe he would tear them\nin pieces ; but at the fame time his very Fury {hakes\nhis Chain, which lets them know, to their Satis\nfaction, he can only Bark, but cannot Bite.\nSome are of Opinion that the Devil is not re-\nftrain d fo much by the fuperior Power of his So\nvereign and Maker; but that all his milder Mea-\nfures with Man are the effeft ofa political Scheme,\nand done upon mature Deliberation ; that it was\nrefolved to aft thus, in the great Council or P 1\nof Devils, call d upon this very Occafion, when\nthey firft were informed of the Creation of Man;\nand efpecially when they confidered what kind\nof Creature he was, and what might probably\nbe the Reafon of making him, (viz.) to fill\nup\nthe Vacancies in Heavens I fay, that then the\n4 Devils\n\fof the DEVIL. 99\nDevils refolv d, that it was not for their Inte-\nreft to fall\nupon him with Fury and Rage, and\nfo deftroy the Species, for that this would be no\nBenefit at all to them, and would only caufe ano\nther original Man to be created 5 for that they\nknew GOD could, by the fame Omnipotence,\nform as many new Species of Creatures as he\npleafed 5 and, if he thought fit, create them in\nHeaven too, out of the Reach of Devils or evil\nSpirits, and that therefore, to deftroy Man would\nno way anfwer their End.\nOn the other hand, examining ftrictly the\nMould of this new made Creature, and of what\nMaterials he was form d &amp;gt;\nhow mixt up of a Nature\nconvertible and pervertible, capable indeed of\ninfinite Excellence, and confequently of eternal\nFelicity &amp;gt;\nbut fubjecl: likewife to Corruption and\nDegeneracy, and confequently to eternal Miferyj\nThat inftead of being fit to fupply the Places of\nSatan and hisrejefted Tribe (the expelPd Angels)\nin Heaven, and filling up the Thrones or Stalls in\nthe Geleftial Choir, they might, if they could but\nbe brought into Crime, become a Race of Re\nbels and Traytors like the reft &amp;gt;\nand fo come at laft\nto keep them Company, as well in the Place of\neternal Mifery, as in the Merit of it, and in a\nWord, become Devils inftead of Angels.\nUpon this Difcovery, I fay, they found it infi\nnitely more for the Intereft of Satan s infernal\nKingdom, to go another way to work with Man\nkind, and fee if it were poffiWe, by the ftrength\nof all their infernal Wit and Counfels, to lay\nfome Snare for him, and by fome Stratagem to\nbring him to eternal Ruin and Milery.\nThis being then approved as their only Method,\n(and the D*w7ihew d he was no Fool in the Choice)\nhe next refolv d that there was no time to be loft\n-\n9\nthat it was to be fet about immediately3\nbefore the\nH 4 Race\n\fioo The HISTORY\nRace was Multiplied, and by that means the\nWork be not made greater only, but perhaps the\nmore difficult too ; accordingly the diligent Devil\nwent inftantly about it, agreeably to all the Story\nof Eve and the ferpent, as before &amp;gt;\nthe belief of\nwhich, whether historically or allegorically, is not\nat all obftru&ed by this Hypothecs.\nI do not affirm that this was the Cafe at n*rn%\nbecaufe being not prefent in that black Di-van^\nat lead not that I know of, for who knows where\nbe was or was not in his pre-exiftent State ? I can\nnot be pofitive in the Refolve that pail there j\nbut except for fome very little Contradiction,\nwhich we find in the facred Writings, I fhouLd,\nI confefs, incline to believe it\nHiftorically j and I\nfhall fpeak of thofe things which I call Contra\ndictions to it more largely hereafter. &amp;gt;\nIn the mean time, be it one way or other, that\nis to fay&amp;gt;\neither that Satan had no Power to have\nproceeded with Man by Violence, and to have de-\nuroy d him as foon as he was made &amp;gt;\nor that he\nhad the Power, but chofe rather to proceed by\nother Methods to deceive and debauch himj \/\nfay^ be it which you pleafe, I am ilill of the Opi\nnion that it\nreally was not the Devil s Bufinefs\nto deftroy the Species 5 that it would have been\nnothing to the purpofe, and no Advantage at all\nto him, if he had done it j for that, as above,\nGOD could immediately have created another Spe\ncies to the fame end, whom he either could have\nmade invulnerable, and not fubject to the Devil s\nPower, or remov d him out of Satan s Reach,\nplac d him out of the Devil s Ken, in Heaven or\nfome other Place, where the Devil could not\ncome to hurt him ; and that therefore it is infi\nnitely more his Advantage, and more fuited to\nhis real\nDefign of defeating the End of Man s Cre\nation, to debauch hint and make a Devil of him,\nthat\n\fof the DEVIL. 101\nthat he may be rejefted like himfelf, and increafe\nthe infernal Kingdom and Company in the Lake\nof Mifery In sternum.\nIt may be true, for\nought I know, that Satan\n,-has not the Power of Definition put into his\nHand, and that he cannot take away the Life of a\nMan : and it feems probable to be fo, from the\nStory ofSatan and Job^ when Satan appeared among\nthe Sons of GOD, as the Text fays, Job i. 6. Now\nwhen God gave fuch a Character of Job to him,\nand ask d him if he bad confider d bis Servant\nJob, f. 8. why did not the Devil ,go immedi\nately and exert his Malice againft the good\nMan at once, to let his Maker fee what would\nbecome of his Servant Job in his Diftrefs? On the\ncontrary, we fee he only anfwers by ihewing the\nReafon of Job s\ngood Behaviour j that it was but\ncommon Gratitude for the Bleffing and Prote&ion\nhe enjoy d, f 10. and pleading that if his Eftate\nwas taken away, and he was exposed as he (Satan)\nwas, to be a beggar and a\nVagabond, going to and\nfro in the Earth, and walking up and down therein,\nhe fhould be a very Devil too, like himfelf, and\ncurfe God to his Face.\nUpon this, the Text fays, that Godanfwered ir.\n1 1 . Behold all that he hath is in thy Power &amp;gt;\nnow tis\nplain here, that God gave up Job s Wealth and\nEftate, nay his Family, and the Lives of his Chil\ndren and Servants into the Devils Power 5 and\naccordingly, like a true mercilefs Devil, as he is,\nhe deftroy d them all ;

103\namong them 3 and how Beneficent he is\n(or at\nlead negative in his Mifchiefs) when they Appeafe\nhim by their hellith Sacrifices.\nLikewife we fee a Teft of his wicked Subtilty\nin his Management of thofe dark Nations, when\nhe was more immediately worfhip d by them ;\nnamely, the making them believe that all their\ngood Weather, Rains, Dews, and kind Influences\nupon the Earth, to make it fruitful, was from Him 5\nwhereas they really were the common Bleflmgs of\na higher Hand, and came not from him, theZVi;\/\/,\nbut from him that made the Devi\/^ and made him\na Devil or fallen Angel by his Curie.\nBut to go back to the Method the Devil took\nwith the fir ft of Mankind 3 tis\nplain the Policy of\nHell was right, tho the Execution of the Re-\nfolves they took did not fully anfwer their End\nneither 3 For Satan fattening upon poor, proud, ri\ndiculous Mother Eve, as I have faid before, made\nprefently a true Judgment of her Capacities, and\nof her Temper 3 took her by the right Handle,\nand foothing her Vanity (which is to this Day\nthe fofteft Place in the Head of all the Sex)\nwheedl d her out of her Senfes, by prailing her\nBeauty, and promiiing to make her a Goddefs.\nThe foolifh Woman yielded prefently, and that\nwe are told is the Reafon why the fame Method fo\nflrangely takes with all her Pofterity (viz.) that you\nare fore to prevail with them, if\nyou can but once\nperfuade them that you believe they are Witty and\nHandfome 3 for the Devil, you may obfervc, never\nquits any Hold he gets, and having once found a\nway into the Heart, always takes care to keep\nthe Door open, that any of his Agents may en\nter after him without any more Difficulty: Hence\nthe fame Argument, efpecially the lair, has fo be-\nwitching an Influence on the Sex, that they rarely\ndeny you any thing, after\nthey are but weak\nH 4 enough\n\f104 The H I ST O R Y\nenough and vain enough to accept of the Praifcs you\noffeAhem on that Head; on the other hand you\nare fure they never forgive you the unpardonable\nCrime of faying they are Ugly or Difagreeable : It is\nfuggefled that the firfl: Method the Devil took to\ninunuate all thofe fine things into Eve s\ngiddy\nHead, was by creeping dole to her one Night,\n\\vhen fhe was afleep, and laying his Mouth to her\nEar^ whilpcring all the fine things to her, which\nhe knew would fet her Fancy a Tip-toe, and fo\nmade her receive them involuntarily into her Mind &amp;gt;\nknowing well enough that when fhe had form d\nfuch Ideas in her Soul, however they came there,\nfhe would never be quiet till fhe had work d them\nup to fome extraordinary thing or other.\nIt was evident what the Devil zim d at, namely,\nthat fhe fhould break in upon the Command of\nGOD, and fo having corrupted her felf, bring\nthe Curfe upon her felf and all her Race, as GOD\nhad threatn d &amp;gt;\nbut why the Pride of Eve fnould\nbe fo eafily\ntickled by the Motion of her exquifite\nBeauty, when there then was no profpect of the\nufe or want of thofe Charms ? that indeed makes\na kind of Difficulty here, which the Icarn d have\nnot determined. For,\nI . If fhe had been as\nUgly as the Devil, fhe had\nno body to rival her, fo that fhe need not\nfear Adam fhould leave her and ^et another\n&quot;Miflrefs.\nz. If fhe had been Bright and Beautiful as an\nAngel, flie had no other Admirer but poor\nMam, and he could have no room to be jea\nlous of her, or afraid fhe fhould cuckold\nhim 5 fo that in fhort, Eve had no fuch Oc-\ncafion for her Beauty, nor could fhe make any\nufe of it either to a bad purpofeor to a good,\nand therefore I believe the Devi^ who is too\ncunning\n\fof the D JE V I L. 105\ncunning to do any thing that fignifies\nNo\nthing, rather tempted her by the Hope of\nencreafing her Wit, than her Beauty.\nBut to come back to the Method of Satan s\ntempting her, viz.by whifpering to her in her ileep j\ntwas a cunning Trick, that s the Truth of it, and\nby that means he certainly fet her Head a madding\nalter Deifm, and to be made a Goddefs, and then\nback d it by the fubtle talk he had with her af\nterward.\nI am the more particular upon this Part, be-\ncaufe, however the Devil may have been the firft\nthat ever practifed it.\nyet I can aflure him the\nExperiment has been tried upon many a Woman\nfince, to the wheedling her out of her Modefty,\nas well as her Simplicity j and the Cunning Men\ntell us ftill, that if you can come at a Woman when\nfheis in a deep fleep, and Whifper to her clofe to\nher Ear, {he will certainly Dream of the Thing\nyou fay to her, and fo will a Man too.\nWell, be this fo to her Race or not, it was it\nfeems fo to her; for {he wak d with her Head fill d\nwith pleafing Ideas, and as fome will have it, un\nlawful Defires &amp;gt;\nfuch, as to be fure {he never had\nentertain d before , Thefe are fuppofed to be fatally\ninfufed in her Dream, and fuggeiled to her waking\nSoul, when the Organ Ear which convey d them\nwas doz d and infenfible; flrange Fate of fleeping\nin\nParadife ! that whereas we have Notice but of\ntwo Sleeps there, that in one a PFoman {hould\ngo out of him, and in the other, the Devil {hould\ncome into her.\nCertainly, when Satan fir ft made the Attempt\nupon Eve, he did not think he fhould have fo\nealily conquered her, or have brought his Bufinels\nabout fo foon 5 the Devil himfelf could not have\nimagined {he {hould have been fo foon brought\nto\n\fio6 The HIS TORY\nto forget the Command given,\nor at leaft who\ngave it, and have ventured to tranfgrcfs againil\nhim, and made her forget that GOD had told her, it\nfhould be Death to her to touch it j and above\nall, that {he fhould afpirc to be as wife as him,\nwho was fo ignorant before, as to believe it was\nfor fear of her being like himfclf, that he had for\nbid it her.\nWell might {he be faid to be the weaker Vei-\nfel, tho Adam himfelf had little enough to fay\nfor his being the ftronger of the two, when he\nwas over-perfuaded (if it were doneby Perfuafion)\nby his Wife to do the fame thing.\nAnd mark how wife they were after they had\nEaten, and what Fools they both acted like, even\nto one another 5 nay, even all the Knowledge\nthey attam d toby it was, for ought I fee, only to\nknow that they were Fools, and to be fenfible\nboth of Sin and Shame j and fee how (imply they\na6ted, I fay, upon their having committed the\nCrime, and being detected in it.\nc\nView them to Day converfing with their God,\nc\nHis Image both enjoy d and underftood,\nc\nfo Morrow skulking with a fordid Flight, ^\nc\nAmong the Buflies from the Infinite^ (Sight 5\n&amp;gt;\nc\nAs if that Power was blind^ which gave them J\nc\nWith fenfelefs Labour Tagging Fig- Leaf Veils,\n*\nTo hide their Bodies from the fight of Beails.\nc\nHark !

I fay, how came the Communication to\nbe fo entirely cut off between them, that except\nthe time, whenever if was, that People did at\nfirft reach from one to the other, none ever came\nback to give their Friends any account of their\nSuccefs5\nor invite them to follow? Nor did they hear\nof one another afterwards, as we have Reafon to\nthink: Did Satan politically keep them thusafun-\nder, left News from Heaven fhould reach them,\nand fo they fhould be recover d out of his Govern\nment ? We cannot tell how to give any other rational\nAccount of it, that a Nation, nay a Quarter of the\nWorld, or as fome will have it be, halfthe Globe,\nfhould be peopled from Europe or Africa, or both,\nand no body ever go after them, or come back\nfrom them in above three thoufand years after.\nNay, that thofe Countries fhould be peopled\nwhen there was no Navigation in ufe in thefe\nParts of the World, no Ships made that could\ncarry Provifions enough to fupport the People\nthat fail d in them, but that they mud have been\nilarved to death before they could reach the Shore\no America; the Ferry from Europe or Africa, in\nany Part ( which we have known Navigation to\nbe pradbifed in) being at leaft 1000 Miles, and in\nmoft Places much more.\nBut as to the Americans, let the Devi? and they\nalone to account for their\ncoming Thither, this we\nare certain of, that we knew nothing of them for\nmany hundred Years $ and when we did, when the\nDifcovery was made, they that went from Hence\nfound Satan in* faH and quiet PoiTeflion of them,\nruling\n\fof the D EVIL. 109\nruling them with an arbitrary Government, parti\ncular to himfelf-\ny He had led them into a blind Sub-\njedion to himfelf, nay, I\nmight call it\nDevotion, for\nit was all of Religion that was to be found among\nthem) worfhipping horrible Idols in his Name, to\nwhom he directed human Sacrifices\ncontinually to\nbe made, till he deluged the Country with Blood,\nand ripen d them up for the Deftru&ion that fol-\nlow d, from the Invalion of the Spaniards, who he\nknew would hurry them all out of the World as\nfaft as he (the Devil) himfelf could defire of them.\nBut to go back a little to the Original of Things,\nIt is evident that Satan has made a much better\nMarket of Mankind, by thus fubtilly attacking\nthem, and bringing them to break with their\nMaker as he had done before them, than he could\nhave done by fulminating upon them at firlr, and\nfending them all out of the World at once &amp;gt;\nfor\nnow he has peopled his own Dominions with\nthem, and tho a Remnant are fnatch d as it were\nout of his Clutches, by the Agency of Invinci\nble Grace, of which I am not to difcourfe in this\nPlace ; yet this may be faid of the Devil, with\nout Offence, that he has in fome Senie carried his\nPoint, and as it were forc d his Maker to be fa-\ntisfied with a Part of Mankind, and the lead\nPart too, inftead of the great Glory he would have\nbrought to himfelf by keeping them all in his\nService.\nMr. Milton, as I have noted above, brings in\nthe Devil and all Hell with him, making a Feu\nde Joye for the Viftory Satan obtain d over one\nfilly Woman &amp;gt;\nindeed it was a Piece of Succefs\ngreater in its\nConfequence than in the immediate\nAppearance 5 nor was the\nConqueft fo\ncompleat\nas Satan himfelf imagin d to make, fince the Pro-\nmife of a\nRedemption out of his Hands, which\nwas immediately made to the Man, in behalf of\nhimfelf\n\fno The HISTORY\nhimfelf and his believing Pofterity, was a great\nDifappointment to Satan, and as it were fnatch d\nthe beft Part of his Victory out of his Hands.\nIt is certain the Devils knew what the mean\ning of that Promife was, and who was to be the\nSeed of the Woman^ namely, the incarnate Son of\nGod) and that it was a fecond Blow to the whole\ninfernal Body 3 but as if they had refolved to\nlet that alone, Satan went on with his Bufi-\nnefs &amp;gt;\nand as he had introduc d Crime into the\ncommon Parent of Mankind, and thereby fecu-\nred the Contamination of Blood, and the De-\nfcent or Propagation of the corrupt Seed, he had\nnothing to do but to affift Nature in time to come,\nto carry on its own Rebellion, and act it felf in the\nBreads of Eve s tainted Pofterity &amp;gt;\nand that in\ndeed has been the Devil s Bufinefs ever iince his\nfirft Victory upon the Kind, to this Day.\nHis Succefs in this Part has been fuch, that\njye fee upon innumerable Occafions a general De-\n*&quot;\netion has followed &amp;gt;\na kind of a Taint upon Na\nture, call it what you will, a Blaft upon the Race of\nMankind ; and were it not for one thing,he had ruin\ned the whole Family; I fay, were it not for one\nthing, namely, a felected Company or Number,\nwhich his Maker has refolv d he fhall not be able to\ncorrupt, or ifhe does, the fending the promised Seed\nihall recover back again from him, by the Power of\nirrefiftible Grace 5 which Number thus feleftedor\nele&ed, call it which we will, are ftill to fupply\nthe Vacancies in Heaven, which Satan s Defe6tion\nleft open &amp;gt;\nand what was before filPd up with crea\nted Seraphs, is now to be reftor d by recovered\nSaints, by whom infinite Glory is to accrue to\nthe Kingdom of the Redeemer.\nThis glorious Eftabliihment has robb d Satan\nof all the Joy of his\nVictory, and left him juft\nwhere he was, defeated and difappointed &amp;gt;\nnor\ndoes\n\fof the DEVIL. in\ndoes the Pofleffion of all the Myriads of the Sons\nof Perdition, who yet fome are of the Opinion\nwill be fnatch d from him too at laftj I fay, the\nPolTeilion of all thefe makes no amends to him,\nfor he is fuch a Devil in his Nature, that the Envy\nat thofe he cannot feduce, eats out all the Satis-\nfa&ion of the Mifchief he has done in feducing all\nthe reft &amp;gt;\nbut \/ mujl not preachy fo I return to\nthings as much needful to know, tho lefs folemn.\nCHAP. IX.\nOf the Progrefs of Satan in carrying on his\nConqueft over Mankind, from the Fall of\nEve to the Deluge.\nI\nDoubt if the Devil was ask d the Queftion\nplainly, he would confefs, that after he had con-\nquer d Eve by his own wicked Contrivance, and\nthen by her Afliftance had brought Adam too (like\na Fool as he was) into the fame Gulph of Mifery,\nhe thought he had done his Work, compared the\nwhole Race, that they were now his own, and\nthat he had put an End to the grand Defign of\ntheir Creation $ namely, of Peopling Heaven with\na new Angelic Race of Souls, who when glori-\nfy d, (hould make up the Defection of the Hod\nof Hell, that had been expung d by their Crime j\nin a Word, that he had gotten a better Conqueft\nthan if he had deftroy d them all.\nBut in the midft of his Conqueft, he found\na Check put to the Advantages he expected to\nreap from his Victory, by the immediate Promifo\nof Grace to a Part of the Pofterity of ddam^\nwho, notwithftanding the Fall, were to be purcha-\nfed by the MeJJiah^ and fnatch d out of his (Satan s)\nHand?,\n\fThe HI ST O R Y\nHands, and over whom he could make no final\nConqueft 3 fo that his Power met with a new\nLimitation, and that fuch, as indeed fully\ndif\nap\npointed him in the main thing he aim d at, (viz.)\npreventing the Beatitudes of Mankind, which\nwere thus fecur dj (And what if the Numbers of\nMankind were upon this account cncreated in\nfuch a manner, that the fele6ted Number iliould,\nby Length of Time, amount to juffc\nas many as\nthe whole Race, had they not fallen, would have\namounted to in all?) And thus, indeed, the World\nmay be faid to be upheld and continued for the\nSake of thofe few, fince till their Number can\nbe compleated, the Creation cannot fall, any more\nthan, that without them, or but for them it would\nnot have flood.\nBut leaving this Speculation, and not having\nenquir d of Satan what he has to fay on that Sub-\n&quot;jecl:,\nlet us go back to the Antediluvian World :\nThe Devil to be furc, gain d his Point upon Eve^\nand in her upon all her Race : He drew her into\nSin j got her turned out of Paradife, and the\nMan with her: The next Thing was to go to\nwork with her Pofterity, and particularly with\nher two Sons Cain and dbel-\nAdam having, notwith ftand ing his Fall, repent\ned very fincerely of his Sinj receiv d the Promife\nof Redemption and Pardon, with an humble but\nbelieving Heart -,\nCharity bids us fuppofe that\nhe led a very religious and fober Life ever after &amp;gt;\nand efpecially in the firit Part of his Time, That\nhe brought up his Children very foberly, and gave\nthem all the neccflary Advantages of a Religious\nEducation,and a good Introduction into the World,\nthat he was capable of &amp;gt;\nand that Eve likewife\nafllfted to both in her Place and Degree.\nTheir two elded Sons Cain and Abel-, The one\nHeir apparent to the Patriarchal Empire, and the\n4 other\n\foftheVEVl L. 113\nother Heir prefumptive, I\nfuppofealfo, lived very\nlober and religious Lives &amp;gt;\nand as the Principles of\nnatural Religion dictated a\nHomage and Subjecti\non due to the Almighty Maker, as an Acknow\nledgment of his Mercies, and a Recognition of\ntheir Obedience 5 ib thereceiv d Ufage of Religi\non dictating at that Time that this Homage was to\nbe paid by a Sacrifice, they either of them brought\na Free-will-offering to be dedicated to God re-\nfpectively for themfelves and Families,\nHow it was, and for what Reafon that God\nhad refpect to the Offering of Abel^ which the\nLearn d fay, was a, Lamb of the Firfilings of the\nFlock, and did not give any Teflimony ofthe like\nRefpect to Cain and his Offering, which was of the\nfir ft Fruits of the Earth, the Offerings being equal\nly fuited to the refpective Employment of the\nMen, that is not my prefent Bufinefsj but this\nwe find made Heart-burnings, and raifed Envy\nand Jealoufy in the Mind of Cain 5 and at that\nDoor the Devil immediately entred&amp;gt; for he, who\nfrom the Beginning, was very diligent in his way,\nnever flip\nd any Opportunity, or mifs d any Ad\nvantages that the Circum fiances of Mankind of\nfered him to do Mifchief.\nWhat Shape or Appearance the Devil took up\nto enter into a Converfation with Cam upon the\nSubject, that Authors do not take upon them to\ndetermine &amp;gt;\nbut tis\ngenerally fuppofed he perfo-\nnated fome of Cain s Sons or Grandfons to begin\nthe Difcourfe, who attack d their Father, or per\nhaps Grandfather, upon this Occaflon, in the fol\nlowing manner, or to that Purpofe.\nD.

but\nI anfwer, tis not likely but that Abel^ as well as\nCain* being at Man s\nEftatelong before this, had\nfeveral Children by their own Sifters, for they\nwere the only Men in the World who were al-\nlow d the Marrying their own Sifters, there be\ning no other Women then in the World ; and as\nwe never read of any of Abel s\nPofterity, tis\nlikewife as probable they were all murther d, as\nthat they fhould kill Abel only, whofe Sons might\nimmediately fall upon Cain for the Blood of their\nFather, and fo the World have been involv d in\na Civil War as foon as there were two Families\nin it,\nBut\n\fof the DEVIL. 123\nBut be it fo or not, tis not doubted the Devil\nwrought with Cain in the horrid Murther, or\nhe had never done it 5 whether it was directly or\nby Agents is not material, nor is the Latter unlike\nly &amp;gt;\nand if the Latter, then there is no Improba\nbility in the Story, for why might not he that made\nUfe of the Serpent to tempt Eve^ be as well fuppo-\nfed to make a Tool of fome of Cain s Sons or\nGrandfons to prompt him in the wicked Attempt\nof murthering his Brother ? and why muft we\nbe oblig d to bring in a Miracle or an Apparition\ninto the Story, to make it\nprobable that the Devil\nhad any Hand in it, when twas fo natural to a de\ngenerate Race to act in fuch a Manner?\nHowever it was, and by whatever Tool the\nDevil wrought, tis certain that this was the Confe-\nquence, poor Abel was butcher d, and thus the Devil\nmade a fecond Conqueft in God s Creation j for\nAdam was now., as may be faid, really Childlefs,\nfor his two Sons were thus far loft, Abel was kill\ned, and Cain was curft and driven out from the\nPrefence of the Lord, and his Race blafted with\nhim.\nIt would be a ufeful enquiry here, and worthy\nour giving an Account of, could we come to a\nCertainty in it, namely, what was the Mark that\nGod fet\nupon Cain^ by which he was kept from\nbeing fallen upon by Abel s Friends or Relations?\nbut as this does not belong to the Devil s\nHiftory,\nand it was God s Mark, not the Dm\/ s, I have\nnothing to do with it here.\nThe Devil had now gain d his Point, the King\ndom of Grace, fo newly erected, had been as it\nwere extinct without a new Creation, had not\nAdam and Eve been alive, and had not Eve^ tho now\n1\n30 Years of Age, been a breeding young Lady,\nfor we muft fuppofe the Woman, in that State of\nLongevity, bare Children till\nthey were feven or\neight\n\f124 The HISTORY\neight hundred Year old : This Teeming of Eve\npeopled not the World fo much as it reftored\nthe blefled Race&amp;gt;\nfor tho Abel was kill d Cain\nhad a numerous Offspring prefently, which had\nSetb9 (Adam s third Son) never been born, would\nfoon have replenifh d the World with People,\nfuch as they were ; the Seed of a Murtherer,\ncurfed of God, branded with a Mark of Infamy,\nand who afterwards fell all\ntogether in the univerfal\nRuine of the Race by the Deluge.\nBut after the Murther of Abel^ Adam had ano\nther Son born, namely, Seth^ the Father of Enos9\nand indeed the Father of the holy Race * for du\nring his Time and his Son Enos9 the Text fays\nthat Men began to call on the Name ofthe Lord 5\nthat is to fay, they began to look back upon Cain\nand his wicked Race, and being convinc d of the\nWickednefs they had committed, and led their\nwhole Pofterity into, they began to fue to Heaven\nfor Pardon of what was paft, and to lead a new\nfort of Life.\nBut the Devil had met with too much Succefs\nin his firft\nAttempts, not to go on with his ge\nneral Refolution of debauching the Minds of Men,\nand bringing them off from God &amp;gt;\nand therefore\nas he kept his Hold upon Cain s curfed Race, em-\nbroiPd already in Blood and Murther $ fo he pro\nceeded with his\ndegenerate Offspring, till in a\nWord he brought both the holy Seed and the\ndegenerate\nRace to joyn in one univerfal Confent\nof-\nCrime, and to go on in it with fuch aggra\nvating Circumflances, as that it\nrepented the\nLord that he had made Man, and he rcfolv d to\noverwhelm them again with a general Deftruc-\ntion, and clear the World of them.\nThe Succeffion of Blood in the royal original \/\nLine of Adam^ is\nprefcrv d in the facred Hiflories\nand brought down as low as Noah and his three\nSons,\n\fof the DEVIL: 125\nSons, for a continu d feries of I4)*o Years, fay\nfome, 1640 fay others 5 in which Time Sinfpread\nit felf fo generally thro the whole Race, and the\nSons of God, fo the Scripture calls the Men of\nthe righteous Seed, the Progeny of Seth, came\nin unto the Daughters of Men, that is, join d them-\nfelves to the curs d Race of Cain, and married\npromifcuoufly with them, according to their Fan\ncies, the Women it fecms being beautiful and\ntempting j andtho the Devil could not make the\nWomen handfome or ugly in one or other Families,\nyet he might work up the Guft of wicked Incli\nnation on either Side, fo as to make both the\nMen and Women tempting and agreeable to one\nanother, where they ought not to have been fo *\nand perhaps, as it is often feen to this Day, the\nmore tempting for being under legal Rcftraint.\nIt is\nobjected here, that we do not find in the\nScripture that the Men and Women of either\nRace were at that Time forbidden intermarrying\nwith one another 5 and it is true, that literally it is\nnot forbid 5 but if we did not fcarch rather to\nmake doubts than to explain them, we might fup-\npofe it was forbidden by fome particular Command\nat that Time 5 feeing we may reafonably allow every\nThing to be forbidden, which they are tax d with\na Crime in committing\n-\ny and as the Sons of God\ntaking them Wives as they thought fit to choofe,\ntho from among the Daughters of the curfed\nRace, is there charg d upon them as a general\nDepravation, and a great Crime 5 and for which,\ntis faid, GOD even repented that he had made\nthem, we need go no farther to fatisfy our felves\nthat it was certainly forbidden.\nSatan no doubt too had a Hand in this Wick-\nednefs 5 for as it was his Bufinefs to prompt Men\nto do every Thing which God had prohibited, fo\nthe Reafon given why the Men of thofe Days\ni did\n\fThe HISTORY\ndid this Thing was, they faw the Daughters of\nMen, that is of the wicked Race or forbidden\nSort, were fair,\nhe tempted them by the Luft of\nthe Eye j in a word, the Ladies were beautiful\nand agreeable, and the Devil knew how to make\nlife of the Allurement $ the Men liked and took\nthem by the meer Direction of their Fancy and\nAppetite, without regarding the fiipreme Pro\nhibition &amp;gt; They took them Wives of all which they\nchofe^ or fuch as they lik d to choofe.\nBut the Text adds, that this promifcuous Ge\nneration went farther than the meer outward\nCrime of it, for it fhew d that the Wickednefs\nof the Heart of Man was great before God, and\nthat he refented it ; In hort,God perceived a Dege\nneracy orDefedk ofVirtue had feiz d upon the whole\nRace, that there was a general Corruption of\nManners, a Depravity of Nature upon them,\nthat even the holy Seed was tainted with it, that\nthe Devil had broken in upon them, and prevaiFd\nto a great Degree , that not only the Pra&ice of\nthe Age was corrupt, for that God could eafily\nhave reitrain d, but that the very Heart of Man\nwas debauch d, his Defires wholly vitiated, and\nhis Senfes engag d in it &amp;gt;\nfo that in a Word, it\nbecame neceflary to fhew the divine Difpleafure,\nnot in the ordinary Manner, by Judgment and Re\nproofs of fuch kind as\nufually reclaim Men, but\nby a general Deftru&ion to Yweep them away,\nclear the Earth of them, and put an End to the\nWickednefs at once, removing the Offence and\nthe Offenders all\ntogether ^ this is\nfignify d at large,\nGen. vi. f. God faw that the\nWickednefs of Man\nwas great in the Earth, and that every Imagination\nof the\nThoughts of his Heart was only evil continu\nally. And again ^ 1\n1, it.

And God looked upon the Earth, and be\nhold\n\fof the DEVIL: 127\nhold it was corrupt\n-\n3 for all Flejh bad corrupted\nhis Way upon the Earth.\nIt muft be confefs d it was a ftrange Conqueft\nthe Devil had made in the Antediluvian World,\nthat he had, as I may fay, ,\nbrought the whole\nRace of Mankind into a general Revolt from\nGod -\ny Noah was indeed a Preacher of Righte-\noufnefs, and he had preach d about foo Years\nto as little\nPurpofe as moil of the good Minifters\never did j for we do not read there was one Man\nconverted by him, or at leaft not one of them left,\nfor that at the Deluge there was either none of\nthem alive, or none fpar d but Noah and his three\nSons, and their Wives -\ny and even they are (\ntis evi\ndent) recorded, not fo much to be fav d for\ntheir own Goodnefs, but becatife they were his\nSons j Nay, without Breach of Chanty we may\nconclude, that at leaft one went to the Devil even\nof thofe three, namely, Ham or Cham for triumph\ning in a brutal Manner over his Father s Drunk-\nennefs 5 for we find the fpecial Curfe reached to\nhim and his Pofterity for many Ages 3 and whether\nit went no farther than the prefent State of Life\nwith them, we cannot tell.\nWe will fuppofe now that thro this whole i\nfoo\nYears the Devil having fo effe&ually debauch d\nMankind, had advanc d his infernal Kingdom to\na prodigious Height &amp;gt;\nfor the Text fays, the whole\nEarth ivasfilFd with violence; in a Word, Blood,\nMurder, Rape, Robbery, Oppreffion and Injuftice\nprevail d every where, and Man, like the wild\nBear in the Foreft, liv d by Prey, biting and\ndevouring one another.\nAt this Time Noah begins to preach a new\nDoctrine to them, for as he had before been a\nPreacher of Righteoufnefs, now he becomes a\nPreacher of Vengeance $ firft he tells them they\nftiall be all oyerwhelm d with a Deluge, thac\ni for\n\fThe HISTORY\nthat for their Sins God repented they were made,\nand that he would deftroy them all, adding, that\nto prevent the Ruin of himfelf and Family, he\nrefolv d to build him a Ship to have recourfe to\nwhen the Water fhould come over the Reft of\nthe World.\nWhat Jefting, what Scorn, what Contempt\ndid this Work expofe the good old Man to for\nabove a 100 Years? for fo long the Work was\nbuilding, as antient Authors fay &amp;gt;\nlet us reprefent to\nour felves in the moil lively Manner how the\nwitty World at that Time behav d to poor old\nNoah , how they took their Evening Walks to fee\nwhat he was doing, and paiTed their Judgment\nupon it, and upon the Progrefs of it 5 I fay, to\nreprefent this to our felves, we need go no far\nther than to our own Witicifms upon Religion^\nand upon the molt folemn Myileries of Divine\nWorfhip -y\nhow we damn the Serious for Enthu-\nfiafts, think the Grave mad, and the Sober me\nlancholy y call Religion it felf Flatus and Hyp-\npo -y\nmake the Devout ignorant, the Divine mer\ncenary, and the whole Scheme of Divinity a\nFrame of Prieflcraft j and thus no doubt the\nbuilding an Ark or Boat, or whatever they call d\nit, to float over the Mountains, and dance over the\nPlains,, what could it be but a religious Frenzy,\nand the Man that fo buried himfelf, a Lunatick ?\nand all this in an Age when divine Things came\nby immediate Revelation into the Minds of\nMen ! the Devil muft therefore have made a\nftrange Conquer! upon Mankind to obliterate all\nthe Reverence, which but a little before was fo\nftrangcly imprefs d upon them concerning their\nMaker.\nThis was certainly the Height of the Devtrs\nKingdom, and we fhall never find him arrive to\nfuch a Pitch again-, he was then truly and lite\nrally\n\fof the DEVIL. I2 p\nrally\nthe univerfal Monarch, nay the God of\nthis World 5 and as all Tyrants do, he governs\nthem with an arbitrary abfolute\nf\nSway &amp;gt;\nand had\nnot God thought fit to give him a Writ of\nEjectment, and afterwards drown him out of Pof-\nfeiHon, I know not what would have been the\nCafe, he might have kept his Hold for ought I\nknow till the Seed of the Woman came to bruife\nhis Head, that is to fay, cripple his Government,\nDethrone him and Depofe his Power, as has been\nfulfill d in the Meffiah.\nBut as he was, I fay, drown d out of the World,\nhis\nKingdom for the prefent was at an End j at\nleaft., if he had a Dominion he had no Subjects,\nand as the Creation was in a Manner renewed, fo\nthe Devil- had all his Work to do over again :\nUnhappy Man ! how has he, by his weak Reiif-\ntance, made the Devil^ recovering his Hold too\neafy to him, and given him all the Advantages,\nexcept as before excepted, which he had before?\nNow whether he retired in the mean Time, and\nhow he got footing again after Noah and his Fa\nmily were landed upon the New Surface, that we\ncome next to enquire.\nC H A P. X.\nOf the ^Devils fecond Kingdom, and how\nhe got footing in the renew d World by his\nVictory over Noah and his Race.\nTHE Story of Noah, his\nbuilding the Ark, his\nembarking himfelf and all Nature s Stock\nfor a new World on board it 5 the long Voyage\nthey took, and the bad Weather they met with,\ntho it would embellifh this Work very well, and\nK J\ncome\n\fi$o The HISTORY\ncome in very much to the Purpofe in this Place,\nyet as it does not belong to the Devtfs Story, for\nI cannot prove what fome fnggeft (viz.) that he\nwas in the Ark among the Reft, I fay, for that\nReafon I muft omit it.\nAnd now having mentioned Satan s being in\nthe Ark j as I fay, I cannot prove it, fo there are,\nI think, fome good Reafons to believe he was\nnot there : Firft^ I know no Bufinefs he had there $\nfecondly^\nwe read ofno Mifchiefdone there, and thefe\njoyn d together make me conclude he was ab-\n(ent } the la ft I\nchiefly infift upon, that we read ofno\nMifchief done there, which if he had been in\nthe Ark, would certainly have happened &amp;gt;\nand there\nfore I fuppofe rather, that when he faw his\nKingdom diflblv d, his Subjects all\ningulph d in\nan inevitable Ruin and Defolation, a Sight fuitable\nenough to him, except as it\nmight unking him for\na Time} I fay, when he faw this, he took care to\nfpeed himfcif away as well as he could, and make\nhis Retreat to a Place of Safety, where that was, is\nno more difficult to us, than it was to him.\nIt is\nfuggefled that as he is Prince of the Power\nof the Air, he retired only into that Region. It is\nmolt rational to fuppofe he went no further on\nmany Accounts, of which I fliall\nfpeak by and by :\nHere he ftay d hovering in the Earth s Atmof-\npherc, as he has often done fince, and perhaps\nnow does &amp;gt;\nor if the Atmofphere of this Globe\nwasafFcted by the Indraft oftheAbforption,asfomc\nthink, then he kept himfelf upon the Watch, to\nlee what the Event of the new Phenomenon would\nbe, and this Watch, wherever it was, I doubt not,\nwas as near the Earth as he could place himfelf\nperhaps in the Atmofphere of the Moon, or in\na Word, the next Place of Retreat he could\nfind.\ni\nFrom\n\fof the DEVIL; 131\nFroni hence I took upon me to irififtj that Sa\ntan has not a more certain Knowledge of Events\nthan we &amp;gt;\nI lay, he has not a more certain Know\nledge\n-\n9 that he may be able to make ftronger Con\njectures and tnore rational Conclufions from that\nhe fees, I will not deny\n-\ny and that which he moil\noutdoes us in is, that he fees more to conclude\nfrom than we can, but I am fatisfied he knows\nnothing of Futurity more than we can fee by Obfer-\nvation and Inference $ nor, for Example) did he\nknow whether God would repeople the World\nany more or no.\nI muft therefore allow that he only waited to\nfee what would be the Event of this flrange E-\nruption of Water, and what God proposed to do\nwith the Ark, and all that was in it.\nSome Philofophers tell us, befides what I hinted\nabove, that the Devil could have no Retreat in\nthe Earth s Atmofphere, for that the Air being\nwholly condens d intoWater, and having continual\nly pour d down its Streams to deluge the Earth, that\nBody was become fo fmall, and had fufFer d fuch\nConvullions, that there was but juft enough Air\nleft to furround the Water, or as might ffcrve\nby\nits PrefTure to preferve the natural Pofition of\nThings, and fupply the Creatures in the Ark with\na Part to breath in.\nThe Atmofphere indeed might fuffer feme ftrange\nand unnatural Motions at that Time, but not (I be\nlieve) to that Degree, however, I will not affirm that\nthere could be room in it, or is now for the Devil,\nmuch lefs for all the numberlefs Legions of Sa\ntan s Hoft j but there was, and now certainly is, fuf-\nficient Space to receive him, and a fufficient Body\nof his Troops for the Bufinefs he had for them -a c\nthat time, and that s\nenough to the Purpofe j cr\nif the Earth s\nAtmofphere did fuffer any particular\nConvulflon, on that Occafion, he might make his\nK i Retreat\n\f1 33 The HISTORY\nRetreat to the Atmofphere of the Moon, or

flue\nof Things &amp;gt;\ncertainly he did not go far, becaufe\nhis Buiinefs lay here, and he never goes out of his\nWay of doing Mifchief.\nIn particular, his more than ordinary Concern\nwas, to fee whnt would become of the Ark &amp;gt;\nhe\nwas wife enough doubtlefs to fee, that GOD, who\nhad directed its\nmaking, nay even the very Struc\nture of it, would certainly take Care of it, preferve\nit\nupon the Water, and bring it to fome Place\nof Safety or other &amp;gt;\ntho where it fhould be, the\nDevil with all his\nCunning could not refolve,\nwhether on the fame Surface the Waters draw\ning off, or in any other created or to be created\nPlace 5 and this State of Uncertainty being evi\ndently his Cafe, and which proves his Ignorance\nof Futurity, it was his Bufinefs, If*)-*\nto watch\nwith the utmoil vigilance for the Event.\nIf the Ark was (as Mr. Burnet thinks) guided\nby two Angels, they not only held it from foun\ndering or being fwallow d up in the Water, but\ncertainly kept the Waters calm about it, efpecially\nwhen the Lord brought a flrong Wind to blow\nover the whole Globe, which by the Way was the\nfirft, and, I\nfuppofe, the only univerfal Storm that\never blew, for to be fure it blew over the whole\nSurface at once 5 I fay, if it was thus guided, to be\nfurc the Devil faw it, and that with Envy and\nRegret that he could do it no Injury, for doubt\nlefs had it been in the Devil s Power, as God had\ndrown d the whole Race of Man, except what\nwas in the Ark, he would have taken care to have\ndifpatch d them too, and fo made an End of the\nCreation at once 5 but either he was not empowered\n4 to\n\fof the DEVIL. 135\nto go to the Ark, or it was fo well guarded by\nAngels, that when he came near it he could do\nit no harm : So it relied at\nlength, the Waters\nabating on the Mountains of Arrarat in Armenia^\nor fome where elfe that Way, and where they\nfay a Piece of the Keel is\nremaining to this Day ,\nof which, however with Dr. I fay, I be\nlieve not one Word.\nThe Ark being fafe landed, tis reafonable to\nbelieve Noah prepared to go on Shore, as the Sea\nmen call it, as foon as the dry Land began to ap\npear &amp;gt;\nand here you mufl allow me to fuppofe\nSatan, tho himielf cloth d with a Cloud, fo as\nnot to be feen, came immediately, and pearching\non the Roof, faw all the Heaven-kept Houmold\nfafely landed, and all the Hoft of living Creatures\ndifperfing themfelves down the Sides of the Moun\ntain, as the Search of their Food or other proper\nOccafions directed them.\nThis Sight was enough -,\nSatan was at no Lofs\nto conclude from hence that the Defign of God\nwas to repeople the World by the Way of ordi\nnary Generation, from thePofterity of thefe eight\nPerfons, without creating any new Species.\nVery well, fays the Devil\nr\n,\nthen my Advan\ntage over them, by the Snare I laid for poor\nEve,, is\ngood ftill -,\nand I am now juft where I was\nafter Adam s\nExpulfion from the

For\nwe are to fuppofe, he could plant no Trees or\nShrubs, but fuch as he found the Roots of in the\nEarth, and which no doubt had been there before\nin their higheft Perfection, and had confequent-\nly grown up and brought forth the fame lufci-\nous Fruit before.\nBefides, as he found the Roots of the Vines,\nfo he underftood what they were, and what Fruit\nthey bore, or elfe it\nmay be fuppofed alfo he\nwould not have planted them 5 for he planted\nthem for their Fruit, as he did it in the Provilion\nhe was making for his Subfiflence, and the Sub-\niiftence of his Family : and if he did not know\nwhat they were, he would not have fet them, for\nhe was not planting for Diverfion but for Profit.\nUpon the whole it feems plain to me he knew\nwhat he did, as well when he planted the Vines as\nwhen he prefled out the Grapes &amp;gt;\nand alfo when he\ndrank the Juice that he knew it was Wine, was\nllrong and would make him drunk if he took\nenough of it : He knew that other Men had been\ndrunk with fuch Liquor before the Flood, and\nthat he had reprehended them for it $ and there\nfore it was not his Ignorance, but the Devil took\nhim at forne Advantage, when his Appetite was\neager, or he thirfty, and the Liquor cooling and\npleafant ; and in fhort, as Eve faid, the Serpent be-\ngmldedher^ and ihe DID EAT, fo the Devil beguiled\nNoah, and be DID DRINK -\ny the Temptation was\ntoo llrong for Noab^ not the Wine$ he knew\nwell\n\fof the DEVIL. 137\nwell enough what he did, but as the Drunkards\nfay to this Day, it was fo good he could not for\nbear it, and fo he got drunk before he was aware j\nor as our ordinary Speech exprefTes it, he was over\ntaken with drink) and Mr. Pool and other Expo-\nfitors are partly of the fame Mind.\nNo fooner was the poor old Man conquer d, and\nthe Wine had lighten d his Head, but it\nmay be\nfuppofed he falls off from the Chair or Bench\nwhere he fate, and tumbling backward his Clothes,\nwhich in thofe hot Countries were only loofe\nopen Robes, like the Vefts which the Armenians\nwear to this Day, flying abroad, or the Devil fo\naffifting\non purpofe to expofe him, he lay there\nin a naked indecent Poiture not fit to be feen.\nIn this juncture who fhould come by but young\nCanaan^ fay fome $ or as others think,&quot;\nthis\nyoung\nFellow firIt attack d him byway of Kindncfs and\npretended Affection ; prompted his Grandfather\nto drink, on Pretence of the Wine being good\nfor him, and, proper for the Support of his old\nAge, and fubtilly let\nupon him, drinking dfo with\nhim, and fo (his Head being too ftrong for the old\nMan s) drank him down, and then, Devil like, tri-\numph d over him 5 boafled of his\nConqueir,, in-\nfulted the Body as it were dead, uncovered hi in\non purpofe to expofe him, and leaving him in\nthat indecent Poihire, went and made Sport with\nit to his Father Ham^ who in that Part, wicked\nlike himfelf, did the fame to his Brethren Japhet\nand Shew &amp;gt;\nbut they like modeil and good Men,\nfar from carrying on the wicked Infult on their\nParent, went and cover d him, as the Scripture\nexprelles it, and as may be fuppofed inform d him\nhow he had been abus d, and by whom.\nWhy elfe fhould Noah^ when he came to him\nfelf, {hew his Refentment fo much again ft Canaan\n}iis Grandfonj rather than\nag^inft\nHam his Father,\nand\n\fi 3 8 The HISTORY\nand who tis fuppofed in the Story the guilt chief*\nly lay upon? we fee the Curfe is\n(as it were) laid\nwholly upon Canaan the Grandfon, and not 3\nWord of the Father is\nmentioned, Gen. ix.\nif, 16,\n2.j, Curfed be Canaan, a Servant of Servants Jball\nhe be, 8cc.\nThat Ham was Guilty, that s certain from the\nHiilory of Fact, but I cannot but fuppofe his\nGrandlon was the Occafion of it ; and in this\nCafe the Devil fcems to have made Canaan the\nTnftrument or Tool to delude Noah^ and draw\nliim in to Drunkennefs, as he made the Serpent the\nTool to beguile Eve^ and draw her into Difobe-\ndience.\nPoffibly Canaan might do it without Defign\nat fir ft, but might be brought in to ridicule\nand make a Jeft of the old Patriarch afterward,\nas is too frequent lince in the Practice of our\nDays 5\nbut I rather believe he did it\nreally with a\nwicked Defign, and on Purpofe to expofe and in*-\nfult his Reverend old Parent 5 and this feems more\nlikely too, bccaufe of the great Bitternefs with\nwhich Noah relented it, after he came to be in-\nform d of it.\nBut be that as it will, the Devil certainly made\na great Conquer! here, and as to outward Ap^\npcarance no Ids than that which he gain d be\nfore over Adam-y nor did the Devil s\nVictory con-\nfid barely in his having drawn in the only righte\nous Man of the whole Antediluvian World, and fo\nbeginning or initiating the new young Progeny\nwith a Crime} but here was the great Oracle filenc d\nat once; the Preacher of Righteoufnefs, for fuch\nno doubt he would have been to the new World,\nns he was to the old, I lay, the Preacher was\nturn d out of Office, or his Mouth itopt, which\nwas worfe , nay, it was a flopping of his Mouth in\ncheworft kind5\nfar wprfc than Hopping his Breath,\nfor\n\fDEVIL; i^\nfor had he died, the Office had defcended to his\nSons Shem and Jafhet, but he was dead to the\nOffice of an Inftru6bor, tho alive as to his Being\n-\n9\nFor of what Force could his Preachings be, who\nhad thus fallen himfelf into the moil fharneful\nand bealHy Excefs?\nBefides fome are of the Opinion, tho I\nhope\nwithout Ground, that Noah was not only over\ntaken once in his Drink, but that being fallen\ninto that Sin it became habitual, and he continued\nin it a great while, and that it was this which is the\nmeaning of his being uncovered in his Tent, and\nthat his Son faw his Nakednefs , that is, he conti?\nnually expofed himfelf for a long Time, a hun^\ndred Years, fay they, and that his Son Ham^ and\nhis Grandfon Canaan having drawn him into it,\nJccpt him in it, encourag d and prompted it, and all\nthe while Satan ftill\nprompting them, joined their\nScoffs and contempt of him, with their wicked En-*\ndeavours to promote theWickednefsj and both with\nas much Succefs as the Devil himfelf could wifli for.\nThen as for his two Sons modeftly and decent\nly covering their Father, they tell us, that Repre-\nfents Shem and Japhet applying themfelves in an\nhumble and dutiful Manner to their Father, to.\nentreat and befeech him to confider his antient\nGlory, his own pious Exhortations to the late\ndrowned World, and to confider the Offence\nwhich he gave by his evilCourfes to God, and the\nScandal to his whole Family, and alfothat they arc\nbrought in effectually prevailing upon him 5 and\nthat then Noah curfed the Wickednefs of Ham s\ndegenerate Race, in\nTeftimony of his fincere Re\npentance after the Fact.\nThe Story is not fo very unlikely as it is cer\ntain that it is not to be proved, and therefore we\nhad better take it as we find it (viz.) for one fin-\ngle\nAt j but fuppqfe it was fo, tis ftill certain\nthat\n\fI 4o The HISTORY\nthat Noab s\nPreaching was fadly interrupted, the\nEnergy of his Words flatter d, and the Force of\nhis Pcrfuafions enervated and abated, by thisfhamc-\nful Fall 5 that he was effectually filenc d for an\nInftruc~bor ever after, and this was as much as the\nDevil had Occafion for 3 and therefore indeed we\nread little more of him, except that he lived three\nhundred and fifty Years after the Flood j nay, we\ndo not fo much as read that he had any more\nChildren, but the contrary, nor indeed could\nNoah have any more Children, except by his old\nand perhaps fuper-annuated Wife , who it was\nvery likely he had had four or five hundred Year,\nunlefs you will fuppofe he was allow d to marry\nfome of his own Progeny, Daughters or Gran*\ndaughters, which we do not fuppofe was allow d,\nno not to Adam himfelf.\nThis was certainly a Matter-piece of the Devil s\nPolicy, and a fatal Inftance of his\nunhappy Di\nligence, (viz.) that the Door of the Ark was no\nfooner open, and the Face of the World hardly\ndry from theuniverfal Deftruftion ofMankind, but\nhe was at work among them j and that not only\nto form a general Defection among the Race,\nupon the Foot of the original Taint of Nature,\nbut like a bold Devil he ftrikes at the very Root,\nand flies at the next general Reprefentative of\nMankind, attacks the Head of the Family, that\nin his Mifcarriage the Rife and Progrefs of a Re\nformation of the new World fhould receive an\nearly Check, and {hould be at once prevented;\nI fay, like a bold Devil, he ftrikes at the Root,\nand alas ! poor unhappy Noah^ he proved too\nweak for him, Satan prevaiPd in his\nvery fir\/ft At\ntempt, and got the Victory over him at once.\nNoah thus overcome, and Satan s Conqueft\ncarried on to the utmoft of his own Wiihes,\nthe Devil had little more to do in the World\nfor\n\fof the DEVIL. 141\nfor fome Ages, than to carry on an univerfal De\ngeneracy among Mankind, and to finilh it\nby a like diligent Application, in deluding the\nGenerality of the Race, and them as they came\non gradually into Life j this he found the lefs dif\nficult, becaufe of the firft Defection which fpread\nlike a Contagion upon the Earth immediately\nafter.\nThe firft Evidence we have of his Succefs in\nthis mifchievous Defign was in the Building that\ngreat ftupendious Stair-cafe, for fuch it feems it\nwas intended, calPd Babel^ which if the whole\nWorld had not been drunk, or otherwife infatua\nted, they would never have undertaken &amp;gt;\neven Sa\ntan himfelf could never have prevaiPd with them\nto undertake fuch a prepofterous Piece of Work,\nfor it had neither End or Means, Poffibility or\nProbability in it.\nI muft confefs I am fometimes apt to vindicate\nour old Ancestors, in my Thoughts, from the\nCharge it felf, as we generally underftand it, name\nly, that they really defign d to build a Tower\nwhich fhould reach up to Heaven, or that it\nfhould fccure them in cafe of another Flood ; and\nFather Cafaubon is of my Opinion, whether I am.\nof his or no, is a Queflion by it felf5 his opini\non is that the Confufion was nothing but a Breach\namong the Undertakers and Direftors of the\nWork, and that the Building was defign d chiefly\nfor a Store-houfe for Provinons, in Cafe of a fe-\ncond Deluge $ as to their Notion of its\nreaching\nup to Heaven, he takes the Expreffion to be alle\ngorical rather than little, and only to mean that it\nfhould be exceeding high ; perhaps they might\nnot be Aftronomers enough to meafure the Dif-\ntance of Space between the Earth and Heaven,\nas we pretend to do now , but as Noah was then\nalive,\n\fI4i the HISTORY\nalive, and as we believe all his three Sons were fo\ntoo, they were able to have inform d them how\nabfurd it was to fuppofe either the one or the other\n.(viz.) (i.) that they could build up to Heaven, or\n(2..) that they could build firm enough to refill:,\nor high enough to overtop the Waters, fuppofing\nfuch another Flood Should happen &amp;gt;\nI would ra\nther think it was only that they intended to build\na moft glorious and magnificent City, where they\nmight all inhabit together j and that this Tower\nwas to be built for Ornament and alfo for Strength,\nor as above, and for a Store- houfe to lay up vaft\nMagazines of Provifions, in Cafe of extraordinary\nFloods or other Events, the City being built in a\ngreat Plain, namely, the Plains of Shimar near the\nRiver Euphrates.\nBut the Story, as it is recorded, fuits better\nwith Satan s Mealurcs at that Time -\ny and as he\nwas from the Beginning prompting them to every\nThing that was contrary to the Happinefs of\nMan, fo the more prepofterous it was, and the more\ninconfifient with common Senle, the more to his\nPurpofe; and it fhew d the more what acornpleat\nConqueft he had gain d over the Reafon as well\nas the Religion of Mankind at that Time.\nAgain, tis evident in this Cafe, they were not\nonly aching contrary to the Nature of Things,\nbut contrary to the Defign and to the Command\nof Heaven j for God s Command was that they\nfhould replenifh the Earth, that is, that they fhould\nfpread their Habitations over it, and People the\nwhole Globe j whereas they were pitching in one\nPlace, as if they were not to multiply fufficient\nto take up any more.\nBut what car d the Devil for that, or to put\nit a little handfomer, that was what Satan aim\ned at 5 for it was enough to him, to bring Man\nkind\n\fbf the D E V I L; 143\nkind to ab juft contrary to what Heaven had di-\nre&ed or commanded them in any thing, and if\npoffiblc in every Thing.\nBut God himfelf put a flop to this foolifh Piece\nof Work, and it was time indeed to do fo, for\na madder thing the Devil himfelf never propofed\nto them 5 I fay, God himfelf put a flop to this\nnew Undertaking, and difappointed the Devil j\nand how was it done?

Virtue and a true\nGreatnefs in Spirit is rated now by Rules which\nGod never appointed, and the Standard of Ho\nnour is\nquite different from that of Reafon and of\nNature :\nBravery is denominated not from a fear-\nlefs undaunted Spirit in the jufl Defence of Life\nand Liberty, but from a\ndaring Defiance of God\nand Man, fighting, killing and treading under\nFoot his fellow Creatures, at the ordinary Com-\nmajad of the Officer, whether it be right or wrong,\nL i and\n\f14* The HISTORY\nand whether it be in a juft Defence of Life, and\nour Country s Life, that is\nLiberty, or whether\nit be for the Support of Injury and Oppreffion.\nA prudent avoiding caufelefs Quarrels is calFd\nCowardice, and to take an affront Bafenefs, and\nMeanncfs of Spirit ; to refute fighting,&quot;and putting\nLife at a Call on the Point of a Sword, a Practice\nforbid by the Laws of God and of all\ngood\nGovernment, is\nyet call d Cowardice -,\nand a Man\nis bound to die duelling, or live and be laugh d at.\nThis trumping upthefe imaginary Things call d\nBravery and Gallantry, naming them Virtue and\nHonour, is all from the Devil s new Management,\nand his fubtil influencing the Minds of Men to\nfly in the Face of God and Nature, and to act\nagainfl his Senfes j nor but for his Artifice in the\nManagement, could it be poflible that fuch In-\nconfidencies could go down with Mankind, or\nthey could pafs fuch abfurd Things among them\nfor reafoning ; for Example, A is found in Bed\nwith B s Wife, B is the Perfoninjur d, and there\nfore offended, and coming into the Chamber with\nhis Sword in his Hand, A exclaims loudly, Why\nSir^ you- won t murder me^ will you ? as you are a&amp;gt;\nMan of Honour let me rife and take my S-word.\nA very good Story indeed ! fit for no body but\nthe Devil to put into any Man s Head; But fo\nit is, B being put in mind, forfooth, that he is\na Man of Honcnr^ Harts back and muft ab the\nhonourable Part; fo he lets A get up, put on his\nClothes and take his Sword ; then they fight,\nand B is kill d for his Honour ; whereas had the\nLaws of God, of Nature and of Reafon taken\nPlace, the Adulterer and the Adulterefs fhould\nhave been taken Prifoners and carried before the\nJudge, and being taken in the Fab, fhould have\nbeen immediately fcntenc d, he to the Block and\nhe to the Stake, and the innocent abus d Hus-\n4 band\n\fof the DE VIL. 149\nband had no Reafon to have run any Rifque o^\nhis Life for being made a Cuckold.\nBut thus has Satan abus d the Reafon ofMan -\ny and\nif a Man does me the greateft Injury in the World,\nI mutt do my felf Juitice upon him, by venturing\nmy life\nupon an even Lay with him, and muft fight\nhim upon equal Hazard, in which the injur d\nPerfon is as often kill d as the Perfon offering the\nInjury :\nSuppofe now it be in the fame Cafe as\nabove^ a Man abufes my Wife, and then to give\nme Satisfaction, tells me, he will fight me, which\nthe French call doing me Keafon \\ No Sir^ (ay I, let\nme lie withyour PVife too^ and then ifyou defere it^1may\nfight you -,\nthen Iam upon even Terms with you ; but\nthis indeed is the Reafoning which the Devil has\nbrought Mankind too at this Day : But to go\nback to the Subject, viz. the Devil bringing the\nNations to fall out, and to quarrel for Room in\nthe World, and fo to fight in order to difpofTefs\none another of their Settlements : This began at\na Time when certainly there were Places enough\nin the World for every one to choofe in, and\ntherefore the Devil^ not the want of Elbow-\nroom, muft be the Occaiion of it j and tis carried\non ever fince, as apparently from the fame Intereft,\nand by the fame original.\nBut we (hall meet with this Part again very often\nin the Devil s\nStory, and as we bring him farther on\nin the Management of Mankind , I therefore lay it\nby for the Prefent, and come to the next Steps the\nDevil took with Mankind after the Confufion of\nLanguages, and this was in the Affair of Worlhip ;\nIt does not appear yet that ever the Devil was fo\nbold, as either,\ni. To fet himfelf up to be worftiip d as a God,\nor which was ftill\nworfe,\n^. To perfuade Man to believe there was no\nGod at all to worfhip.\nL Both\n\fI 5 o The HISTORY\nBoth thefe are introduced fince the Deluge, one\nindeed by the Der\noil^ who icon found Means to\nfet himfelf up for a God in many Parts of the\nWorld, and holds it to this Day 3 but the lafl is\nbrought in by the Invention of Man, in which\nit mull bcconfefs d Man has out-fin d the Devil ;\nfor to do Satan jutlice, he never thought it could\never pafs upon Mankind, or that any Thing fo\ngrofs would go down with them ; fo that, injhort^\nthcfe modern Cafuifts, in the Reach of our Days,\nhave, Ifay^ out-iin d the Devil.\nAs then both thefe are modern Inventions, Sa\ntan went on gradually, and being to work upon\nhuman Nature by Stratagem, not by Force, it\nwould have been too grofs to have fet himfelf up\nas an Object of Worihip at firlt, it was to be\ndone Step by Step 3 for Example.\nI. It was fufficient to bring Mankind to a\nNeglect of God, to worfhip him by halves,\nand give little or no Regard to his Laws,\nand fo grow loofe and immoral, indirect Con\ntradiction to his Commands &amp;gt;\nthis would not\ngo down with them at firft, fo the Devil\nwent on gradually.\nz. From a\nNegligence Mn worshiping the true\nGOD, he by Degrees introduc d the worfhip\nof falfe GODS j and to introduce this he be\ngan [with the Sun^ Moon, and Sfars, call d\nin the holy Text the Hoft of Heaven 5 thefe\nhad greater Majefty upon them, and feem d\nfitter to command the Homage of Mankind 5\nfo it was not the hardeft Thing in the World,\nto bring Men, when they had once forgot\nten the true God, to embrace the Worfhip\nof fuch Gods as thofe.\nJ. Having thus debauch d their Principles in\nWorfhip, and led them from the true and\nonly\n\fofthe DEVIL; 151\nonly Object of Wor\/hip to a falfe, it was the\neafier to carry them on $ ib in a few Grada\ntions more he brought them to downright\nIdolatry, and even in that Idolatry he proceed\ned gradually too 5 for he began with awful\nNames, fuch as were venerable in the\nThoughts of Men, as BAAL or BELL, which,\nin Chaldaick and Hebrew^ fignifies Lord or\nSovereign, or Mighty and Magnificent, and\nthis was therefore a Name afcrib d at firft\nto the true God&amp;gt; but afterwards they de-\nfcended to make Images and Figures to re-\nprelent him ,\nand then they were call d by\nthe fame Name, as Baal^ Baalim, and after\nwards Belly from which, by a p\nhellifh\nDege\nneracy, Saturn brought Mankind to adore\nevery Block of their own hewing, and to\nworshipping Stocks, Stones, Monfters, Hob\ngoblins, and every fordid frightful Thing,\nand at lall the Devil himfelf.\nWhat Notions fome People may entertain of the\nForwardnefs of the firfl:\nAges of the World, to run\ninto Idolatry, I do not enquire here 5 I know they\ntell us ftrange Things, of its\nbeing the Product of\nmeer Nature, one remove from its\nprimitive State -\ny\nbut I, who pretend to have ib\ncritically enquir d\ninto Satan s\nHiflory, can aflure you, and that\nfrom very good Authority, that the Devil did\nnot find it fo eafy a tafk to obliterate the Know\nledge of the true God, in the Minds and Con-\nfciences of Men, as thofe People fuggeft.\nIt is true he carried Things a great Length un\nder the Patriarchal Government of the fidl Ages,\nbut ftill he was (Ixteen hundred Years bringing\nit to pafs 5 and tho we have Reafon to believe\nthe old World, before the Flood was arrived to\na very great Height of Wickednefs, and Ovid\nL 4 very\n\fj 5 2 ^HISTORY\nvery nobly defcribes it\nby the War of the fitans\nagainft Jupiter^ yet we do not read that ever Sa\ntan was come to fuch a Length as to bring them\nto Idolatry 3 indeed we do read of Wars car\nried on among them, whether it was one Nati\non againft another, or only Perfonal, we cannot\ntell 3 But the World feem d to be fwallow d up in\na Life of Wickednefs, that is to fay, of Luxury\nand Lewdnefs, Rapine and Violence, and there\nwere Giants among them, and Men of Renown,\nthat is to fay, Men fanVd for their mighty Va\nlour, great A&ions of War we may fuppofe,\nand their Strength, who perfonally oppofs d\nothers. We read ofno confiderable Wars indeed,\nbut tis not to be doubted but there was fuch Wars,\nor elfe it is to be underftood that they iiv d (in\ncommon) a Life fomewhat like the Brutes, the\nStrong devouring the Weak 3 for the Text fays,\nthe whole Earth was filled with Violence, hunting\nand tearing one another in Pieces, either for Do\nminion or for Wealth, either for Ambition or for\nAvarice, we know not well which.\nThus for the ojd Antediluvian World went,\nand very wicked they were, there is no doubt of\nthat 3 but we have Reafon to believe that was no\nIdolatry, the Devil had not brought them to that\nLength yet :\nperhaps it would ibon have follow d,\nbut the Deluge intervened.\nAfter the Deluge, as \/ have faid^ he had all\nhis Work to do over again, and he went on by\nthe lame Steps 3 firft he brought them to Violence\nand War, then to Qppreffion and Tyranny, then\nto negle&of true Worfhip, then to falfe worfhip,\nand then Idolatry by the meer natural Confe-\nquence of the Thing 3 who were the firft Na\ntion or People that fell from the Worfhip of the\ntrue God, is\nfomething hard to determine 3 the De-\nyjl)\nwho certainly of all God s Creatures is beft able\n\fof the DEVIL; 153\nto inform us, having left us nothing upon Record\nupon that Subject, but we have Reafon to be\nlieve it was thus introduc d.\nNimrod was the Grandfon of Ham, Noah s\nfecond Son, the fame who was curfed by his Fa\nther for expofing him in his Drunkennefs: This\nNimrod was the firft who it feems Satan pick d\nout for a Hero : Here he infpir d him with am\nbitious Thoughts, dreams of Empire, and hav\ning the Government of all the Reft, that is to\nay^ univcrfal Monarchy\n-\n9 the very fame Bait with\nwhich he has plaid upon the Frailty of Princes,\nand enfnard the greateft of them ever fince, even\nfrom his moil Auguft Imperial Majefty KingM^-\nrod the firft, to his moft Chriftian Majefty Louis\nthe XIV. and many a mighty Monarch between.\nWhen thefe mighty Monarchs and Men of\nFame went off the Stage, the World had their\nMemories in efteem many Ages after j and as\ntheir great Aftions were no otherwife recorded\nthan by oral Tradition, and the Tongues and Me^\nmories of fallible Men, Time and the Cuftom of\nmagnifying the paft Aftions of Kings, Men\nfoon fabl d up their Hiftories, Satan affiftmg^ into\nMiracle and Wonder: Hence their Names were\nhad in Veneration more and more 3 Statues and Bu\nboes repreicnting their Perfons and great Actions\nwere fet up in public Places, till from Heroes and\nChampions they made Gods of them, and thus\n(Satan prompting) the World was quickly fill d\nwith Idols.\nThis Nimrod is he, who according to the re*\nceived Opinion, tho I do not find Satan s\nHiftory\nexactly concurring with it, was firft call d Eelus^\nthen Baal) and worfhip d in moft of the eaftem\nCountries under thofe Names -,\nfometimes with\nAdditions of Sir- names, according to the feveral\no^intries? or People, or Towps where he was\nparticu-.\n\f154 The HIS TORY\nparticularly fct\nup, as Baal Peor, Baal Zephon*\nBaal Phegor, and in other Places plain Baal^ as\nJupiter in after Times had the like Additions j as\nJupiter Ammon, Jupiter Capitolinus^ Jupiter Pif-\nt&amp;lt;jY, Jupiter FeretriuS) and about ten or twelve\nJupiters more.\n1 rnuft acknowledge, that I think it was a Maf~\nter-piece of Hell to bring the World to Idola\ntry fo foon after they had had fuch an eminent\nExample of the infinite Power of the true God,\nas was feen in the Deluge, and particularly in the\nEfcape of Noah in the Ark, to bring them (even\nbefore Noah or his Sons were dead) to forget\nwhofe Hand it was, and give the Homage of the\nWorld to a Name, and that a Name of a mortal\nMan dead and rotten, who was famous for no\nthing when he was alive but Blood and War -\ny I\nfay, to bring the World to fet up this Nothing,\nthis meer Name, nay the very Image and Picture\nof him for a God^ it was firfl a Mark of moil\nprodigious Stupidity in the whole Race of Men,\na monftrous Degeneracy from Nature, and even\nfrom common Senfe &amp;gt;\nand in the next Place twas\na token of an inexpreffible Craft and Subtilty in\nthe Devil) who had now gotten the People into\nfo full and compleat a Management, that in ihort,\nhe could have brought them, by the fame Rule, to\nhave worfhip d any thing j and in a little while more,\ndid bring many of them to worfhip himfelf, plain\nDevil as he was, and knowing him to be fuch.\nAs to the Antiquity of this horrible Defection\nof Mankind, tho we do not find the beginning\nof it\nparticularly recorded, yet we are certain it\nwas not long after the Confufion of Babel 5 for\nNimrod^ as is faid, was rio more than Noah s\ngreat\nGrandfon and Noah himfelf, I fuppofe, might be\nalive fome Years after Nimrod was born &amp;gt;\nand as\nNimrod was not long dead, before they forgot that\nhe\n\fof the DEVIL. 155\nhe was a Tyrant and a Murtherer, and made a\nBaal^ that is a Lord or Idol of him, I fay, he\nwas not long dead, for Nimrod was born in the\nYear of the World 1\n847, and built Babylon the\nYear 1\n879 5 and we find Terah the Father of A~\nbraham^ who liv d from the Year 1\n879 was an Ido\nlater, as was doubtlefs Bethuel, who was Terab s\nGrandfon &amp;gt;\nfor we find Laban, who was BethueFs\nSon, was fo, and all this was during the Life of\nthe firft Poft-Diluvian Family, for Terab was born\nwithin one hundred ninety three Years after the\nFlood, and one hundred fifty feven Years before\nNoah was dead ; and even Abram himfelf was\neight and fifty Years old before Noah died, and\nyet Idolatry had been then, in all\nprobability,\nabove an hundred Years pradifed in the World.\nN. B. It is worth Remark here, what a ter\nrible Advantage the Devil gain d by the de\nbauching poor Noah, and drawing him into\nthe Sin of Drunkennefs 5 for by this, as I\nfaid, he filenc d and flop d the Mouth of\nthe great Preacher of Righteoufnefs, that\nFather and Patriarch of the whole World,\nwho not being able for the Shame of his\nown foul Mifcarriage, to pretend to inftruft\nor reprove the World any more, the Devil\ntook hold of them immediately, and for\nwant of a Prophet to warn and admonifh,\nran that little of Religion which there might\nbe left in Shem and Japhet^ quite out of the\nWorld, and delug d them all in IDOLATRY.\nHow long the whole World may be faid to be\nthus overwhelmed in Ignorance and Idolatry, we\nmay make fome tolerable guefs at by the Hiftory\nof Abraham ; for it was not till God call d him\nfrom his Father s Houfe, that any fuch Thing as a\nChurch\n\fi 5 6 TfoHIS T O R Y\nChurch was eftablinYd in the World $ nor even\nthen, except in his own Family and Succeflors for\nalmoft four hundred Years after that Call ; and\ntill God brought the Ifraelites back out oF Egypt,\nthe whole World may be faid to be involved in\nIdolatry and Devil worfhip.\nSo abfolute a Conqueft had the Devil made\nover Mankind immediately after the Flood, and\nall\ntaking its Rife and Beginning at the fatal De\nfeat ofNoab, who had he liv d untainted and in\nvulnerable, as he had done for fix hundred Years\nbefore, would have gone a great way to have\nilem d the Torrent or Wickednefs which broke\nin upon Mankind &amp;gt;\nand therefore the Devil^ I fay,\nwas very cunning and very much in the Right\nof it, take him as he is a meer Devil^ to attack\nNoah perfonally, and give him a Blow- fo foon.\nIt is true, the Devil did not immediately raze out\nthe Notion of Religion and of a GOD from\nthe Minds of Men, nor could he eafily fupprefs\nthe Principle of Worfhip and Homage to be paid\nto a Sovereign Being, the Author of Nature and\nGuide of the World &amp;gt;\nthe Devil faw this clearly\nin the firft\nAges of the new World, and there\nfore, as I have faid, he proceeded politically and\nby Degrees : That it was fo, is evident from the\nStory of Job and his three Friends, who, if we\nmay take it for a Hiftory, not a Fable, and may\njudge of the Time of it\nby the Length of Job s\nLife, and by the Family of Eliphaz the femanite^\nwho it is manifeft was at lead Grandfon or Great\nGrandfon to Efau Ifaac s eldefl Son, and by the\nLanguage of Ablmilech King of Gerar to .Abra-\nhaW) and of Laban to Jacob^ both the Latter\nbeing at the fame Time Idolaters &amp;gt;\nI fay, if we\nmay judge of it\nby all thefe, there were ftill\nvery\nfound Notions of Religion in the Minds of Men 5\nnor could Satan with all his Cunning and Policy\ndeface\n\fof the D EVIL. 157\ndeface thofe Ideas^ and root them out of the\nMinds of the People.\nAnd this put him upon taking new Meafures\nto keep up his Intereft and prelerve the Hold\nhe got upon Mankind -,\nand his Method was\nlike himfelf, fubtle and politick to the lall De\ngree, as his whole Hiftory makes appear &amp;gt;\nfor fee\ning he found they could not but believe the Being\nof a God, and that they would needs worfhip fome-\nthing, it is evident, he had no Game left him to\nplay but this, namely, to fet up wrong Notions\nof Worfhip, and bring them toafalfe Worfhip in-\nftead of a True, fuppofing the Object worfnip d\nto be flill the fame.\nTo finifh this Stratagem, he firftinfinuates that\nthe true God was a terrible, a dreadful, unap\nproachable Being 5 that to fee him was fo fright\nful, that it would be prefent Death ;

XI.\nOf God s calling a Church out of the midjl\nofa degenerate World, and of Satan s new\nMeafures upon that Incident : How he\nattackd them immediately* and his Sue-\ncefs in thofe Attacks.\nSAtan\nhaving, as I have faid in the preceding\nChapter, made, as it were, a full Conqueft of\nMankind, debauch d them all to Idolatry, and\nbrought them at lead to worfhipingthe true God\nby the wretched Medium of corrupt and idola\ntrous Reprefentations &amp;gt;\nGod feem d to have no\ntrue Servants or Worfhippers left in the World,\nbut if I may be allow d to fpeak fo, was oblig d, in\norder to reftore the World to their Senfes again,\nto call a felect Number out from among the reft,\nwho he himfelfundertook iTiould own his Godhead\nor fupreme Authority, and worfhip him as he\nrequir d to be worfhip dj this, I fay, God was\noblig d to do, becaufe tis evident it has not been\ndone fo much by the Choice and Council of Men,\nfor Satan would have over-ruVd that Part9\nas by\nthe Power and Energy of fome irrefiftible and\ninvincible Operation, and this our Divines give\nhigh Names to 3 but be it what they will, it is the\nfecond Defeat or Difappointment that the Devil\n4 has\n\f160 The HI ST O R Y\nhe met with in his Progrefs in the World j the\nfirft I have fpoken of already.\nIt is true, Satan very well underftood what\nwas threatn d to him in the original Promiic to\nthe Woman, immediately after the Fall, namely,\ntboujhalt bruife his Head, Sec. but he did riot ex\npect it fo fuddenly, but thought bimfelf fure of\nMankind, till the Fullnefs of Time when the\nMeffiah fhould comej and therefore it was a great\nSurprize to him, to fee that Abraham being call d\nwas fo immediately received and eilablifh d, tho*\nhe did not fo\nimmediately follow the Voice that\ndirected him, yet in him, in his Loins was all\nGod s Church at that time contained.\nIn the calling Abraham, it is\neafy to fee that\nthere was no other way for God to form a\nChurch, that is to fay, to fingle out a People to\nhimfelf, as the World was then dated, but by\nimmediate Revelation and a Voice from Heaven :\nAll Mankind were gone over to the Enemy, ovef-\nwhelm d in Idolatry, in a Word, were engag d\nto the Devil-, God Almighty, or as the Scrip\nture diftinguifhes \\nm,the Lord, the true GOD, was\nout of the Queflion ; Mankind knew little or\nnothing of him, much lefs did they know any\nthing of his Worfhip, or that there was fuch a\nBeing in the World.\nWell might it be faid the Lord appeared to\nAbraham, 6en. xii.\n7. for if God had not ap-\npear d himlelf, he muft have fent a Meflenger\nfrom Heaven, and perhaps it was fo too, for he had\nnot one true Servant or Worihiper that we\nknow of then on Earth, to fend on that Errand j\nno Prophet, no Preacher of Righteoufnefs, Noah\nwas dead, and had been fo above feventeen Year j\nand if he had not, his\npreaching, as I obferved\nafter his great Mifcarriage, had but little Effet }\nwe are indeed told, that Noah left behind him\ncertain\n\fof the DE V IL. ist\ncertain Rules and Orders for the true\nWorfhip\nof GOD, which were call d the Precepts ofNoah,\nand remain d in the World for a\nlong Times tho*\nhow written, when neither any Letters, much\nlefs\nWriting were known in the World, is a\nDifficulty which Remains to be folv dj and this\nmakes me look upon thofe Laws call d the Pre\ncepts of Noab to be a modern Invention, as I do alib\nthe Alphabetttm Noachl^ which Eocbart pretends\nto give an Account of\nBut to leave that Fiflion, and come back to\nAbrahamiGod call d him, whether at firit\nbyVoice\nwithout any Vifion, whether in a Dream or Night\nViiion, which was very Significant in thofe Days,\nor whether by forne awful Appearance, we\nknow not ; the fecoiid Time, tis indeed faid ex-\nprefsly GOD appeared to him ; Be it which Way\nit will, GOD himfelf call d him, fhew d him the\nLand of Canaan, gave him the Promife of it for\nhis\nPofterity, and withal gave him fuch a Faith\nthat the Devil foon found there was no room for\nhim to meddle with Abraham. This is certain\nwe do not read that the Devil ever fo -much as\nattempted Abrahams. all&amp;gt;\nfome will\nfuggeft that\nthe Command to Abraham to go and offer up his\nSon Ifaac, was a\nTemptation of the Devil, if pof-\niible to defeat the glorious Work of GOD S call\ning a holy Seed into the World; for the \/fry? if\nAbraham had difobey d that Call, the new Fa\nvourite had been overcome and made a Rebel of\nor fecondly, if he had obeyed, then the promised\nSeed had been cutoff, and Abraham defeated 3 but\nas the Text is\nexprefs that GOD himfelf propofed\nit to Abraham, I {hall not ftart the Suggeftions\nof the Criticks, in Bar of the facred Oracle.\nBe it one way or other, Abraham fhew d a\nHero-like Faith and\nCourage, and if the Devil\nhad been the Author of it, he had feen himfelf\nM\n\f162 The HISTORY\ndifappointed in both his Views &amp;gt;\n(i.)by Abraham s\nready and bold Compliance, as believing it to\nbe GOD S Command 5 and (i.) by the divine Coun\ntermand of the Execution, juft as the fatal Knife\nwas lifted up.\nBut if the Devil left Abraham, and made no\nattack upon him, feeing him invulnerable, he made\nhimfelf amends upon the other Branch of his Fa\nmily, his poor Nephew LOT &amp;gt; who, notwit (land\ning he was fo immediately under the particular\nCare of Heaven, as that the Angel who was fent\nto deftroy Sodom^ could do nothing till he was\nout of it &amp;gt;\nand who, tho after he had left Zoar,\nand was retir d into a Cave to dwell, yet thefubtle\nDevil found him out, deluded his two Daughters,\ntook an Advantage of the Fright they had been\nin about Sodom and Gomorrah^ made them be\nlieve the whole World was burnt too, as well\nas thofe Cities, and that in fhort, they could\nnever have any Husbands, 6cc. and fo in their\nabundant Concern to repeople the World, and\nthat the Race of Mankind might not be deftroy-\ned, they go and lie with their own Father-, the\nDevil telling them doubtleis how to do it, by in\ntoxicating his Head with Wine 5 in all which\nStory, whether they were not as drunk as their\nFather, feems to be a Queition, or elfe\nthey could\nnot have fuppofed all the Men in the Earth were\nconfum d, when they knew that the little City\nZoar had been preferv d for their Sakes.\nThis now was the third Conqueil Satan ob-\ntain d by the Guft of humane Appetite &amp;gt;\nthat is\nto fay, once by Eating and twice by Drinking, or\nDrunkennefs, and {till the laft was the worft and\nmoft fhameful &amp;gt;\nfor Lot^ however his Daughters\nmanag d him, could not pretend he did not un-\nderfland what the Strength of Wine was 5 and\none would have thought after fo terrible a Judg\nment\n\fof the DEVIL.\nment as that of Sodom was, which was, as we may\nfay,\nexecuted before his Face, his Thoughts\nfhould have been too folemnly engag d in praif-\ning God for fparing his Life, to be made drunk,\nand that two Nights together.\nBut the Devil pJay d his Game fure, he fet his\ntwo Daughters to work, and as the Devil s In-\nftruments feldom fail, fo he fecur d his by that\nhellifh Stratagem of deluding the Daughters, to\nthink all the World was confum d but they two\nand their Father : To be fure the old Man could\nnot fufpecl: that his Daughters Defign was fo\nwicked as indeed it was, or that they intended to\ndebauch him with Wine, and make him drink till\nhe knew not what he did.\nNow the Devil having carried his Game here,\ngain d a great Point ; for as there were but two re\nligious Families in the World before, from whence\na twofold Generation might be fuppoled to rife\nreligious and righteous like their Parents, (viz.)\nthat of Abraham and this of Lot ; this Crime\nruin d the Hopes of one of them &amp;gt;\nit could no\nmore be (aid that juvt Lot was in Being, who\nvex d his righteous Soul from Day to Day with\nthe wicked Behaviour of the People of Sodom $\nrighteous Lot was degenerated into drunken in-\nceituous Lot) LOT fallen from what he was, to be\na wicked and unrighteous Man -\n9 no pattern of\nVirtue, no Reprover of the Age, but a poor fal\nlen Degenerate Patriarch, who could now no\nmore reprove or exhort, but look down and be\nafham d, and nothing to do but to repent &amp;gt;\nand\nfee the poor mean Excufes of all the three.\nEve fays, The Serpent beguiled me^ and I did eat.\nNoah lays, My Grand\/on beguiFd m^ or the\nWind beguird me^ and I did drink.\nM z Lot\n\fi64 The HISTORY\nLot fays.

he\nhad indeed but little to do, for all the reft of the\nWorld was his own, lull d alleep under the Witch\ncraft of Idolatry, and are fo ftill.\nBut it could not be long that the Devil lay\nidle j as foon as God call d himfelf a People,\nthe Devil could not be at Reft till he attacked\nthem.\nc\nWherever God fets up aHoufe ofPrayer,\nc\nThe Devil always builds a Chapel there.\nAbraham indeed went off the Stage free, and fo\ndid Ifaac too, they were a Kind of firft Rate\nSaints , we do not fo much as read of any failing\nthey had, or of any Thing the &quot;Devil had ever\nthe Face to offer to them 3 no, or with Jacob\neither, if you will excufe him for beguiling his\nBrother Efau, of both his Birthright and his Blef-\nfing, but he was bufy enough with all his Chil\ndren &amp;gt;\nfor Example,\nHe fent Judah to his Sheep-{hearing, and\nplaced aWhore (famar) in his Way, in the Po(-\nture\n\fof the DEVIL. 165\nture ofTemptation, fo made him commit In-\ncefr. and Whoredom both together.\nHefent inceftuous Reubenio lie with his Father s\nConcubine Billah.\nHe fent Dinah to the Ball, to dance with the\nSichemite Ladies, and play the Whore with\ntheir Matter.\nHe enrag d Simeon and Levi^ at the fuppofed\nInjury, and then prompted them to Revenge,\nfor which their Father heartily curfed them.\nHe fet them all\ntogether to fall\nupon poor\nJofeph^ fir ft to murther him intentionally,\nand then actually fell him to the Midia-\nnites.\nHe made them {hew the Party- coloured Coat,\nand tell a lie to their Father, to make the\npoor old Man believe Jofefh was kill d by a\nLion, &c.\nHe fent Potiphar s Wife to attack Jofeph s\nChaftity, and filFd her with Rage at the Dif-\nappointment.\nHe taught Jofeph to fwear by the Life of Pha*\nroab.\nIn a Word, he debauch d the whole Race, ex\ncept Benjamin^ and never Man had fuch a Set of\nSons, fo wicked and fo notorious, after fo good\nan Introduction into the World as they all of\nthem had, to be fure 5 for Jacob^ no doubt, gave\nthem as good Inftru&ion as the Circumitances\nof his wandring Condition would allow him\nto do.\nWe muft now confider the Devil and his Af\nfairs in a quite differing Situation: When the\nWorld firil\nappeared peopled by the creating\nPower of God, he had only Adam and Eve to\ntake care of, and I think he ply d his Time with\nthem to purpofe enough : After the Deluge he ha4\nM 5 Noah\n\f166 The HISTORY\nNoah only to pitch upon, and he quickly conquer d\nhim by the Inftigation of his Grand\/on.\nAt the Building of Babel he guided them by\ntheir acting all in a Body as one Man 3 fo that in\nfhort he managed them with eafe, taking them as a\n.Body politic j and we find they came into his Snare\nas one Man &amp;gt;\nbut Now, the Children offfrael multi\nplying in the Land oftheir Bondage, and God feem-\ning to fhew a particular Concern for them, the\nDevil was obliged to new Meafures, Hand at a\nDi(lance, and look on for fome Time.\nThe Egyptians were plagued even without his\nHelp, nor tho the cunning Artift, as I (aid, flood\nand looked on, yet he durfl not meddle ; nor could\nhe make a few Lice, the lead and meancil of the\nArmies of Infects raifed to afflict the Egyptians.\nHowever, when he perceiv d that God refolv-\ned to bring the Ifraelites out, he prepared to at\ntend them, to watch them, and be at Hand up\non all the wicked Occafions that might offer, as\nif he had been fully fatisfied fuch Occafions would\noffer, and that he fhould not fail to have an Op\nportunity to draw them into fome Snare or another,\nand that therefore it was his Bufinefsnot to be out\nof the Way, but to be ready (as we fay) to make\nhis Market of them in the befl Manner he could :\nHow many Ways he attempted them, nay, how\nmany Times he conquered them in their Journey,\nwe {hall fee\nprefently.\nFirft he put them in a fright at Baal-Zephon^\nwhere he thought he had drawn them into a Noofe,\nand where he tent Pharoah and his Army to block\nthem up between the Mountains of Piahiroth\nand the Red Sea j but there indeed Satan was\noutwitted by Mofes, fo far as it\nappeared to be\na humane Action, for he little\nthought of their\ngoing dry footed thro* the Sea, but depended up\non having them all cut in Pieces the next Morn\ning\n\fof the DEVIL. 167\ning by the Egyptians 5 an eminent Proof, by the\nWay^ that the Devil has no Knowledge of Events,\nor any Infight into Futurity j nay that he has not\nfo much as a fecond Sight, or knows to Day what\nhis Maker intends to do to Morrow j for had\nSatan known that God intended to Ford them over\nthe Sea, if he had not been able to have prevent\ned the Miracle, he would certainly have prevent\ned the Efcape, by fending out Pharoah and his\nArmy time enough to have taken the Strand be\nfore them, and fo have driven them to the Ne-\nceffity\nof travelling on Foot round the North\nPoint of that Sea, by theWildernefs of Etan, where\nhe would have purui d and harrafs d them with his\nCavalry, and in all Probability have deftroy d them :\nBut the blind fhort-fighted Devil, perfectly in the\nDark, and unacquainted with Futurity, knew no\nthing of the Matter, was as much deceived as\nPharoah himfelf, flood ftill\nflattering himfelfwith\nthe Hopes of his Booty, and the Revenge he\nfhould take upon them the next Morning j till he\nfaw the frighted Waves in an Uproar, and to his\nutter Aftoniihment and Confufion faw the Paf-\nfage laid open, and Mofes leading his vaft Army\nin full March over the dry Space ^ nay even then\ntis\nvery propable Satan did not know that if the\nEgyptians follow d them, the Sea would return\nupon and overwhelm them j for I can hardly\nthink fo hard of the Devil himfelf, that if he had,\nhe would have fuffer d, much lefs\nprompted Pha\nroah to follow the Chafe at fuch an Expence\n-\ny fo\nthat either he mufl be an ignorant unforefeeing\nDevil, or a very ungrateful falfe Devil to his\nFriends the Egyptians.\nI am enclin d alfo to the more charitable Opini\non of Satan too, becaufe the Efcape of the Ifraetites\nwas really a Triumph over himfelf5 for theWar was\ncertainly his, or at lead he was auxiliary to Pharoah^\nM 4 it\n\f168 The HISTORY\nit was a\nVictory over Hell and Egypt toge\nther, and he would never have fuffer d the Dif-\ngrace, if he had known it beforehand -&amp;gt;\nthat is to\nlay, tho he could not have prevented the Efcape\nof Ifrael) or the\ndividing the Water, yet he might\nhave wairn d the Egyptians, and cautioned them\nnot to venture in after them.\nBut we fhall fee a great many weak Steps\ntaken by the Devil in the Affair of this very Peo\nple\nand their forty Years Wandring in the Wil-\ntiernefsj and tho he was in fome things fuccefs-\nful, and wheedled them into many foolifh and\nmiferable Murmurings and Wranglings agajnft\nGod, and Mutinies againft poor Mofe^ yet the\nDevil was oftentimes baulk d and difappointed &amp;gt;\nand\ntis for this Reafon that I choofe to finifh the firft\nPart of his Hiftory with the particular Relation\nof his Behaviour among the Jews, becaufe alfo,\nwe do not find any extraordinary Things happen\ning any where elfe in the World for above one\nthoufand five hundred Years, no Variety, jio Re\nvolutions 5 all the Red of Mankind lay ft ill under\nhis Yoke, quietly fubmitted to his Government,\ndid jufl as he bad them, worfhip d every Idol\nhe fee\nup, and in a Word, he had no Difficulty\nwith any Body but the Jews, and for this Reafon,\nI\nfay, this Part of his Story will be the more life-\nful and\ninftru&ing.\nTo return therefore to M&fes and his\ndividing\nthe Red Sea , that the People went over or thro\nit., that we have the facred\nHiftory for;

Tis true the\nEgyptians Holt was lent to him in their Room, but\nthat was not what he aim d at 5 for he was fure\nenough of them his own Way, and if it was not\njuft at that Tiwe^ yet he knew what and who they\nwere -\ny but as he had devour d the whole Jfraelt-\ntijh Hoft in his Imagination, to the Tune of at\nleaft a Million and a half of Souls &amp;gt;\nMen., Wo\nmen and Children j it was, no doubt, a great Di\nappointment to the Devil to mifs of his Prey, and to\nfee them all\ntriumphing on the other Side in Safety.\nIt is true, Satan s Annals do not mention this\nDefeat, for Hiilorians are generally backward to\nregifter their own Misfortunes $ but as we have\nan Account of the Fa6b from other Hands, fo\nas we cannot queftion the Truth of it j the Na\nture of the Thing will tell us it was a Difappoint-\nment to the Devil, and a very great one too.\nI cannot but obferve here, that I think this\nPart of the Devil s\nStory very entertaining, ber\ncaufe of the great Variety of Incidents which ap\npear in every Part of it &amp;gt;\nfometimes he is like a\nhunted Fox, curvetting and counter-running to\navoid his\nbeing purfued&quot;\nand found out, while at\nthe fame time he is\ncarrying on his fecret Defigns\nto draw the People he pretends to manage, into\nfpme Snare or other to their Hurt 5 at another\ntime, tho the Comparifon is a little too low for\nhis Dignity, like a\nMonkey that has done Mil-\nchief, and who making his own Efcape fits and\nchatters at a Diftance, as if he had triump d in\nwhat he had done 5 fo Satan, when he had drawn\nthem in to worfhip a Calf, to offer\nftrange Fire,\nto (et up a Schifm, and the like j and fo to bring\nthe Divine Vengeance upon themfelvcs3 leaving\n3\n\fI 7o The HIS TORY\nthem in their Diftrefs, kept at a Diftancc, as i\nhe look d on with Satisfaction to fee them Burnt*\nfwallow d up, fwept away, and the like 5 as the\nfeveral Stories relate.\nHis indefatigable Vigilance is, on the other\nhand, a ufeful Caveat, as well as an improving\nView to us &amp;gt;\nno (boner is he routed and cxpos d,\ndefeated and difappointed in one Enterprise, but\nhe begins another, and, like a cunning Gladiator,\nwarily defends himfelf, and boldly attacks his Ene\nmy at the fame time. Thus we fee him, up and down,\nconquering and conquered, thro this whole Part\nof his Story, till at laft he receives a total De\nfeat -\n9 of which you fhall hear in its place : In the\nmean time, let us take up his Story again at the\nRed Sea9 where he receiv d a great Blow, inilead\nof which he expected a compleat Victory &amp;gt;\nfor\ndoubtlefs the Devil and the King of Mgypt too,\nthought of nothing but Conqueft at Piahiroth.\nHowever, tho the Triumph of the Ifraelites\nover the Egyptians muft needs be a great Morti\nfication to the Devil, and exafperated him very\nmuch, yet the Confequence was only this, viz.\nthat Satan^ like an Enemy who is baulk d and\ndefeated, but not overcome, redoubles his Rage,\nand reinforces his Army, and what the Egyptians\ncould not do for him, he refolves to do for him\nfelf5 in order then to take his Opportunity for\nwhat Mifchief might offer, being defeated, and\nprovok d, I fay, at the Slur that was put upon him,\nhe refolves to follow them into the Wildernefs,\nand many a vile Prank he plaid them there &amp;gt;\nas\nfirft, he ftraitens them for Water, and makes\nthem murmur againft GOD, and againft- Mofes^\nwithin a very few Days, nay, Hours, of their\ngreat Deliverance of all.\nNor was this all, but in lefs than one Year more\nwe find them, (at his Inftigation too) fetting up\n4 a golden\n\fof t^ DEVIL: 171\na golden Calf^ and making all the People dance\nabout it at Mount Sinai $ even when God himfelf\nhad but juft before appear d to them in the Ter\nrors of a burning Fire upon the Top of the\nMountain j and what was the Pretence ? Truly,\nnothing but that they had loft Mofes, who ufed\nto be their Guide, and he had hid himfelf in the\nMount, and had not been feen in forty Days, fo\nthat they could not tell what was become of him.\nThis put them all into Confufion $ a poor Pre\ntence indeed, to turn them all back to Idolatry !\nbut the watchful Devil took the Hint, pufh d the\nAdvantage, and infinuated that they (hould never\nfee Mofes again, that he was certainly devour d by\nventuring too near the Flafhes of Fire in the\nMount, and prefuming upon the Liberty he had\ntaken before j in a word, that God had deftroyed\nMofes,\nor he was ftarved to Death for want of\nFood, having been forty Days and forty Nights\nabfent.\nAll thefe were, it s true, in themfelves moft\nfoolifh Suggeftions, confidering Mofes was ad\nmitted to the Vifion of God, and that God had\nbeen pleafed to appear to him in the moft inti\nmate manner &amp;gt;\nthat as they might depend God\nwould not deftroy his faithful Servant, fo they\nmight have concluded he was able to fupport his\nBeing without Food as long as he thought fit $\nbut to a People fo eafy to believe any thing, what\ncould be too grofs for the Devil to perfuade them\nto?\nA People who could dance round a Calf, and\ncall it their God, might do any things that could\nfay to one another, that this was the Great JE\nHOVAH, that brought them out of the Land of E-\ngypt ; and that within fo few Days after God s\nmiraculous Appearance to them, and for them 5 I\nfay, fuch a People were really fitted to be im-\npofed\n\fThe H I S T O R Y\npofed upon, nothing could be too grofs for\nthem.\nThis was indeed his firft confiderable Experi\nment upon them as a People , or a as Body\n-\ny and\nthe Truth is, his Affairs required it, for &atanj\n\\vho had been a Succefsful Devil in moil of his\nAttempts upon Mankind, could hardly doubt of\nSuccefs in any thing after he had carried his Point\nat Mount Sinai : To bring them to Idolatry in the\nvery Face of their Deliverer, and juft\nafter their\nDeliverance ! It was more aftonifhing in the main\nthan even their paffing the Red Sea : In a Word,\nthe Devil s whole Hiilory does not furnifh us with\n3.

and indeed it was\naCommiffion fit for no body but the DeviI: Thou\njlmlt\n\f188 The HISTORY\njhalt entice him, and thoufloalt alfo prevail: Go out\nand do even fo, f.zi.\nEven good Jofiah himfelf, of wliom it is re\ncorded, that like him there was no King before himy\nneither after him arofe there any like him, 2,\nKings\nxxiii. 16. yet the Devil never left him with his Ma\nchinations, till\nrinding he could not tempt him to\nany Thing wicked in his Government, he tempted\nor mov d him to a needlefs War with the King\nof Egypt, in which he loft his Life.\nFrom the Death of this good King, the Devil\nprevailed fo with the whole Nation of the Jews,\nand brought them to fuch an incorrigible Pitch\nof Wickednefs, that God gave them up, for-\nfook his Habitation of Glory, the Temple, which\nhe fuffer d to be fpoil d firft, then burnt and de-\nniolinYd 5 deftroying the whole Nation of the\nJews, except a fmall Number that were left, and\nthofe the Enemy carried away into Captivity.\nNor was he Satisfied with this general Deftruc-\ntion of the whole People of Ifrael, for the tdn\nTribes were gone before &amp;gt;\nbut he folio w d them\neven into their Captivity 5 thofe that fled\naway to\nEgypt, which they tell us were feventy thoufand,\nhe firfl\ncorrupted, and then they were deftroyed\nthere upon the Overthrow of Egypt, by the fame\nKing of Babylon.\nAlfo he went very near to have them rooted\nout, young and old, Man, Woman and Child, who\nwere in Captivity in Babylon, by the Miniftry of\nthat true Agent of Hell, Haman the Agagite-, but\nthere Satan met with a\nDifappointment too, as in\nthe Story of \/&\/&amp;lt;?r,\nwhich was but the fourth that\nhe had met with, in all his Management fince the\nCreation 3 I fay, there he was difoppointed, and\nhis prime Minifter Haman was exalted, as he de-\nHaving\n\fEVIL. IS9\nHaving thus far traced the Government and\nDominion of the Devil^ from the Creation of Man\nto the Captivity &amp;gt;\nI think I\nmay call upon him to\nfet up his Standard of univerfal Empire, at that\nPeriod 5 it feem d juft then as if God had really for-\nfaken the Earth, and given the entire Dominion\nof Mankind up to his outrageous Enemy the De\nvil -\ny for excepting the few Israelites which were\nleft in the Territories of the King of Babylon, and\nthey were but a few &amp;gt;\nI fay, except among them,\nthere was not one Corner of the World left where\nthe true God was call d upon, or his Dominion\nfo much as acknowledg d $ all the World was\nburied in Idolatry, and that of fo many horrid\nKinds, that one would think, the Light of Rca-\nfon fhould have convinced Mankind, that he who\nexafted fuch bloody Sacrifices as that of Moloch^\nand fuch a bloody cutting themfelves with Knives,\nas the Priefls of Baal did, could not be a GOD, a\ngood and beneficent Being, but mutt be a cruel,\nvoracious and devouring Devil, whofe End was\nnot the Good, but the Deftruction of his Crea\ntures : But to fuch a Height wns the blind dement\ned World arriv d to at that Time, that in thefc\nfordid and corrupt Ways, they went on worfhip-\ning dumb Idols, and offering human Sacrifices\nto them, and in a Word, committing all the moil\nhorrid and abfurd Abominations that they were\ncapable of, or that the Devil could prompt them\nto, till Heaven was again put, as it were, to the\nNeceflity of bringing about a Revolution, in fa\nvour of his own forfaken People, by Miracle and\nSurprize, as he had done before.\nWe come therefore to the Reftoration or Re\nturn of the Captivity : Had Satan been able to\nhave afted any thing by Force, as 1 have obferv d\nbefore, all the Princes and Powers of the World,\nhaving been, as they really were, at his Devotion,\nhe\n\ftpo The HI ST O R Y\nhe might eafily have made ufe of them, arm d\nall the World againft the Jews, and prevented\nthe Rebuilding the Temple, and even the Return\nof the Captivity.\nBut now the Devil s Power manifeftly receiv\ned a Check, and the Hand of God appeared in it,\nand that he was refolv d to reeftabliih his People\nthe Jews, and to have a fecond Temple built :\nthe Devil) who knew the Extent of his own\nPower too well, and what Limitations were laid\nupon him, flood ftill as it were looking on, and\nnot daring to oppofe the Return of the Capti\nvity, which he very well knew had been prophe-\niied, and would come to pafs.\nHe did indeed make fome little\nOppofition to\nthe Building, and to the fortifying the City^ but\nas it was to no Purpofe, fo he was foon obliged to\ngive it over \\ and thus the Captivity being re-\nturn d, and the Temple rebuilt, the People of the\nJews encreafed and multiplied to an infinite Num\nber and Strength $ and from this Time we may\nfay, the Power of the Devil rather declin d and\ndecreased, than went on with Succefs, as it had\ndone before j It is true the Jews fell into Sects and\nErrors, and Divifions of many Kinds, after the\nReturn from the Captivity, and no doubt the\nDevil had a great Hand in thofe Divifions j but\nhe could never bring them back to Idolatry, and\nhis not being able to do that, made him turn his\nHand fo\nmany Ways to plague and opprefs them j\nas\nparticularly by Antlochus the Great , who\nbrought the Abomination of Defolation into the\nholy Place -,\nand there the Devil triumphed over\nthem for fome Time 5 but they were deliver d\nmany Ways, till at lail they came peaceably un\nder the Protection rather than the Dominion of\nthe Roman Empire : When Herod the Great go-\nvern d them as a King, and reedified, nay almoft\nrebuilt\n\fif the D EV IL.\n1\n191\nrebuilt their Temple, with fo great an Expence\nand Magnificence, that he made it, as fome fay,\ngreater and more glorious than that of Solomon s^\ntho^ that I take to be a great Fable, to fay\nno worfe of it.\nIn this Condition the Jewijb Church flood,\nwhen the Fullnefs of Time, as tis call d in\nScrip\nture, was come j and the DeviI was kept at Bay,\ntho he had made fome Encroachments upon\nthem as above 3 for there was a glorious Rem\nnant of Saints among them, fuch as old Zacha-\nrias the Father of John the Baptift, and old Si&quot;\nmeon^ who waited for the Salvation of Ifraeli I\nfay, in this Condition the Jewijli Church flood\nwhen the Mejpah came into the World, which\nwas fuch another mortal Stab to the Thrones and\nPrincipalities infernal, as that of which I\nhavefpo-\nken already in Chap. III. at the Creation of Man &amp;gt;\nand therefore with this I break off the Antiquities\nof the Devil s\nHiftory, or the antient Part of his\nKingdom ; for from hence downward we fhall\nfind his Empire has declin d gradually j and tho*\nby his wonderful Addrefs, his\nprodigious Applica\ntion, and the Vigilance and Fidelity of his Inftru-\nments, as well human as infernal and diabolical,\nand of the Human as well the Ecclefiaflick as\nthe Secular &amp;gt;\nhe has many Times retriev d what\nhe has loft, and fometimes bid fair for recovering\nthe universal Empire he once poflefs d over Man\nkind 5 yet he has been ftill defeated again, repulft\nand beaten back, and his Kingdom has greatly\ndeclin d in many Parts of the World 5 and efpe-\ncially in the Northern Parts, except Great Bri\ntain-, and how he has politically maintained his\nIntereft and encreafed his Dominion among the\nwife and righteous Generation that we cohabit\nwith and among, will be the Subject of the mo\ndern Part of Satan s Hiftory^ and of which we\nare next to give an Account. PART\n\f192 The HIS TORY\nP A R T II.\nO F T H E\nMODERN HISTORY\nOF THE\nD E V I L.\nCHAP. I.\nI\nHave examined the Antiquities of Satan s\nHiltory in the former Part of this Work,\nand brought his Affairs down from the Crea\ntion, as far as to our blefTed Chriftian Times -,\nefpecially to the Coming of the Me\/pah, v\/hen one\nwould think the Devil could have nothing to do\namong us. I have indeed but touch d at fome\nThings which might have admitted of a farther\nDefcripuon of Satan s Affairs, and the Particulars\nof which we may all come to a farther\nKnowledge\nof hereafter 5 yet I think I have fpoken to the\nmaterial Part of his Conduct, as it relates to his\nEmpire in this World: What has happened to\nhis more fublimated Government, and his Ange\nlic\nCapacities, I fhall have an Qccafion to touch\nat in feveral folid Particulars as we go along.\nThe\n\fof the DEVIL. 193\nThe Mejffiah was now born&amp;gt;\nthe\nFulnefs of Time\n*wa$ come, that the old Serpent was to have his\nHead broken, that is to fay, his Empire or Domi\nnion over Man, which he gain d by the Fall o r\nour firft Father and Mother in Paradife, received.\na Downfal or Overthrow.\nIt is worth observing) in order to confirm what\nI have already mention d of the Limitation of\nSatan s Power, that not only his Angelic Jtrength\nfeems to have received a farther Blow upon the\nComing of the Son of God into the World, but\nhe feems to have had a Blow upon his Intellects &amp;gt;\nhis Serpentine Craft and Devil-like Subtihy feems\nto have been circumfcrib d and cut Ihort $ and in-\nflead of his being fo cunning a Fellow as before,\nwhen, as Ifold, tis evident he outwitted all Man\nkind, not only Eve, Cain, Noah, Lot, and all\nthe Patriarchs, but even Nations of Men, and\nthat in their pubiick Capacity j and thereby led\nthem into abfurd and ridiculous Things, fuch as\nthe Building of Babel, and deifying and worfhip-\ning their Kings* when dead and rotten &amp;gt;\nidolizing\nBeafts, Stocks, Stones, any firing, and even Nothing ;\nand in a Word, when he manag d Mankind juit\nas he pleafed.\nNow and from this Time forward he appeared\na weak, foolifh, ignorant Devil, compared to\nwhat he was before j He was upon alrnoil every\nOccafion refifted, difappointed, baulk d and de\nfeated, efpecially in all his Attempts to thwart\nor croft the Miflion and Miniftry of the Meffiab,\nwhile he was upon Earth, and fometimes upon\nother and very mean Occafions too.\nAnd firft, how fooliih a Project was it, and\nhow below Satan s celebrated Artifice in like Cafes,\nto put Herod upon fending to kill the poor in\nnocent Children in Bethlehem, in hopes to deftroy\nthe Infant ? for I take it for granted, it was the\nO Devil\n\f194 the Modern HISTORY\nDevil put into Herod s\nThoughts that Executi\non, how fimpte and foolifh foever 5 now we mull\nallow him to be very ignorant of the Nativity\nhimfelf, or elfe he might eafily have guided his\nFriend Herod to the Place where the Infant was.\nThis iliev\/s that either the Devil is in general\nignorant as we are, of what is to come in the\nWorld, before it is\nreally come to pafs ; and con-\nfcquently can foretcl nothing, no not fo much as\nour famous old Merlin or Mother Shiptcn did, or\nelfe that great Event was hid from him by an im\nmediate Power fuperior to his, which I cannot\nthink neither, confidcring how much he was con-\ncern d in it, and how certainly he knew that it\nwas once to come to pafs.\nBut be that as it will, tis certain the Dtvil\nknew nothing where Chrift was born, or when 5\nnor was he able to direct Herod to find him out,\nand therefore put him upon that foolifh, as well as\ncruel Order, to kill all the Children, that he might\nbe fure to deilroy the MeJJtah among the reft.\nThe next fimple Step that the Devil .took^\nand indeed the moft foolifh one that he could\never be charged with, unworthy the very Dig\nnity of a Devil) and below the Underitanding\nthat he always was allow d to act with, was that\nof coming to tempt the MeJJiah in the Wilder-\nnefs -,\nit is certain, and he own d it himfelf after\nwards, upon many Occafions, that the Devil\nknew our Saviour to be the Son of God &amp;gt;\nand\ntis as certain that he knew, that as fitch he could\nhave no Power or Advantage over him 3 how\nfooliih then was it in him to attack him in that\nManner, if thou beeft the Son of GOD ?\nwhy he\nknew him to be the Son of GOD well enough j\nhe faid fo afterwards, \/ know thee who thou art^\nthe holy One of GOD j how then could he be fo\nweak a Devil as to fay, if thou art^ then do\/0 and fo ?\n3\nThe\n\fof the DEVIL, 195\nThe Cafe is\nplain, the Devil, tho he knew\nhim to be the Son of GOD, did not fully\nknow\nthe Myftery ofthe Incarnation $ nor did he know\nhow far the Inanition of Chrift extended, and\nwhether, as Man, he was not fubject to fall us\nMam was, tho his referv d Godhead might be\nftill immaculate and pure&amp;gt;\nand upon this Foot, as\nhe would leave no Method untried, he attempts\nhim three Times, one immediately after another &amp;gt;\nbut then, finding himfelf diiappointed he fled.\nThis evidently proves that the Devil was igno\nrant of the great Myftery of Godlinefs, as tie\nText calls \/&amp;gt;,\nGod manifeft in the Fleih, and there*-\nfore made that fooliih Attempt upon Chrift, think\ning to have conquer d his human Nature as ca\npable of Sin, which it was not&amp;gt;\nand at this Rc-\npulfe Hell groan d, the whole Army of regimen\nted Devils receiv d a Wound, and felt the Shock\nof it y twas a iecond Overthrow to them, they\nhad had a long Chain of Succefs, carried a devilijb\nConqueft over the greateft Part of the Creation\nof GOD 5 but now they were cut fhort, the Seed\nof the Woman was now come to break the Serpent*s\nHead, that is^ to cut fhort his Power, to con\ntract the Limits of his Kingdom, and in a Word,\nto dethrone him in the World : No doubt the\nDevil receiv d a Shock, for you find him always\nafterward, crying out in a horrible Manner, when\never Chrift met with him, or elfe very humble\nand fubmiffivc, as when he begg d leave to go into\nthe Herd of Swine, a Thing he has often done\nfince.\nDefeated here, the firft\nStratagem I find him\nconcern d in after it, was his entring into Judas,\nand putting him upon betraying Chrift to the\nChief Prieftj but here again he was entirely mif-\ntaken, for he did not fee, as much a Devil as he\nwas, what the Event would be 5 but when he\nO came\n\fI 9 6 The Modern HISTORY\ncame to know, that if Chrift was put to Death,\nhe would become a Propitiatory and be the great\nSacrifice of Mankind, fo to refcue the fallen Race\nfrom that Death they had incurred the Penalty\nof, by the Fall, that this was the fulfilling of\nall\nScripture Prophefy, and that thus it was that\nChrift was to be the End of the Law, I fay, as\nfoon as he perceiv d this, he ftrove all he could to\nprevent ir, and difturb d Pilate s Wife in her Sleep,\nin order to fet her upon her Husband to hinder\nhis delivering him up to the Jews\n-\ny for then, and\nnot till then, he knew how Chrift was to vanquifh\nHell by the Power of his Crofs.\nThus the Devil was difappointed and expofed\nin every Step he took, and as he now plainly\nfaw his Kingdom declining, and even the tem\nporal Kingdom of Chrift, rifing up upon the\nRuins of his (Satan s) Power , hefeem d to retreat\ninto his own Region the Air, and to confult there\n\\vith his fellow Devils^ what Meafures he ihould\ntake next to preferve his Dominion among Men &amp;gt;\nHere it was that he refolv d upon that truly hel-\nlifli\nThing calPd Perfecution, by which, tho* he\nprotfd a footijh Devil in that too, he flatter d him-\nfelf he fhould be able to deftroy God s Church,\nand root out its ProfefTors from the Earth, even\nalmoft as foon as it was eftablifli d &amp;gt;\nwhereas on the\ncontrary, Heaven counter-a6ted him there too,\nand tho he arm d the whole Roman Empire againft\nthe Chriftians, that is fay^ the whole World,\nand they were fallen upon every where, with all\nthe Fury and Rage of fome of the moft flaming\nTyrants that the World ever faw, of whom Nero\nwas the firft 9 yet in fpight of Hell, GOD made all\nthe Blood, which the Devil caus d to be fpilt, to\nbefimen Ecckfix,;\nand the DEVIL had the Morti\nfication to fee, that the Number of Chriftians en-\ncreafed even under the very Means he made ufe\nof\n\fof the DEVIL, 197\nof to root them out and defcroy them : This\nwas the Cafe thro the Reign of all the Roman\nEmperors, for the fir ft three hundred, Years after\nChriit.\nHaving thus tried all the Methods that bell\nfuited his Inclination, I mean thofe of Blood and\nDeath, complicated with Tortures and all Kinds\nof Cruelty, and that for fo long a Stage of Time\nas above 5 the Devil all on a iuddain, as if glut\nted with Blood, and fatiated with Definition,\nfits ftill and becomes a peaceable Spectator for n\ngood while; as if he either found himfelf unable,\nor had no Difpofition to hinder the Progrefs of\nChriftianity in the firft Ages of its Settlement\nin the World : In this interval the Chriftian\nChurch was eftablifh d under Conftantine^ Re\nligion flourifhed in Peace, and under the moft\nperfect Tranquillity : The Devil feem d to be at a\nLofs what he fhould do next, and Things began\nto look as if Satan s Kingdom was at an End 3 but\nhe foon let them fee that he was the fame indefa\ntigable Devil that ever he was, and the Profperi-\nty of the Church J\ngave him a large Field of Ac\ntion; for knowing the Difpofition of Mankind to\nQuarrel and Difpute, the univerfal Paffion rooted\nin Nature, efpecially among the Church-Men\nfor Precedency and Dominion, he fell to work\nwith them immediately j fo that turning rheTables,\nand reafluming the Subtilty and Cra^, which, I\nfay, he feem d to have loft in the former four\nhundred Years, he gain d more Ground in the\nnext Ages of the Church, and went farther to\nwards reftoring his Power and Empire in the\nWorld, and towards overthrowing that very\nChurch which was fo lately eftablifh d, than all\nhe had done by Fire and Blood before.\nHis Policy now feem d to be edg d with Re-\nfentment for the Miftakes he had made; as if the\nO 3 Devil\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\nDevil looking back with Anger at himfelf, to fee\nwhat a Fool he had been to expect to crufh Re\nligion by Perfecution, rejoyc d for having difco-\nver d that Liberty and Dominion was the only\nway\nto ruin the Church, not Fire and Faggot;\nand that he had nothing to do but to give tjie\nzealous People their utrnoft Liberty in Religion,\nonly fowing Error and Variety of Opinion among\nthem, and they would bring Fire and Faggot in\nfail enough among themfelves.\nIt mull be confeis d thefe were devilifli Poli\nticks 5 and fo fure was the Aim, and fo certain\nwas the Devil to hit his Mark by them, that we\nfind he not only did not fail then, but the fame\nhellifh Methods have prevailed ftill, and will do\nfo to the End of the World. Nor had the De\nvil ever a better Game to play than this, for the\nRuin of Religion, as we fhall have room to\nfhew in many Examples, befides that of the Dif-\nfenters in England^ who are evidently weaken d by\nthe late Toleration: Whether the Devil had any\nhand in baiting his Hook with an A of Parlia\nment or no, Hiftory is filent, but tis too evident\nhe has catch d the Fifh by it 5 and if the honeit\nChurch o England does not in Pity and Chriltian\nCharity to the Diflenters, itraighten her Hand\na little, I cannot but fear the Devil will gain his\nPoint, and the Diflenter will be undone by it.\nUpon this new foot of Politicks the Devil\nbegan with the Emperors themfelves :\nArlus^\nthe Father of the Hercticks of that Age, having\nbroach d his Opinions, and jftbamjius the ortho\ndox Bifhop of the Ealt oppofing him, the Devil\nno fooner faw the Door open to Strife and Inipo-\nfition, but he thriift himfelf in, and raifing the\nQuarrel up to a fuited\nDegree of Rage and Spleen.,\nhe involved the good Emperor himfelf in it firft,\nand Aihznafitts was bamfh d and recall d, and ba-\nnifh d\n\fof the D E VI L, 199\nniih d and recalled again, feveral times, as Error\nran high, and as the Devil either got or loll\nGround : After Conftantine^ the next Emperor\nwas a Child of his own, (Arlan) and then\nthe Court came all into the Quarrel, as Courts\noften do, and then the Arians and the Orthodox\nperfecuted one another as furiouily as the Pagans\nperfecuted them all before. To fuch a Height\nthe Devil brought his Conquefl in the very In\nfancy of the Queftion, and to much did he pre\nvail over the true Chriftianity of the Primitive\nChurch, even before they had cnjoy d the Li\nberty of the pure Worfhip twenty Years.\nFlufh d with this Succefs, the Devil made one\nPufh for the reitoring Paganifm^ and bringing on\nthe old Worfhip of the Heathen Idols and Tem\nples 5 but like our King James II. he drove too\nhard, and Julian had fo provok d the whole Ro\nman Empire, which was generally at that time\nbecome Chriftian, that had the Apoftate liv d,\nhe would not have been able to have held the\nThrone 5 and as he was cut off in his Begin\nning, Paganifm expired with him, and the Devil\nhimfelf might have cry d out, as Julian did,\nand with much more Propriety, Ficifti\nGali-\nleane.\nJovian^ the next Emperor, being a glorious\nChriftian, and a very good and great Man, the\nDevil abdicated for a while, and left the Chrifti-\nan Armies to re-eftabliili the Orthodox Faith;\nnor could he bring the Chriftians to a Breach\nagain among themfelves a great while after.\nHowever, Time and a diligent Devil did the\nWork at lad, and when the Emperors concern\ning themfelves one way or other, did not appear\nfufficicnt to anfwer his End, he chang d Hands\nagain, and went to work with the Clergy : To\nfet the Doctors effectually together by the Ears, he\n4 threw\n\f2oo The Modern HISTORY\nthrew in the new Notion of Primacy among\nthem, for a Bone of Contention 5 the Bait took,\nthe Priefts fwallow d it\neagerly down, and the\nDevil, a cunningcr Fifherman than ever St. Peter\nwas, ftruck them (as the Anglers call it) with a\nquick Hand, and hung them faft\nupon the Hook.\nHaving them thus in his Clutches, and they\nbeing now, as we may fay, his own, they took\ntheir Mcafures afterwards from him, and moil\nobediently followed his Directions &amp;gt;\nnay, I will\nnot fay but he may have had pretty much the\nManagement of the whole Society ever fince, of\nwhat Profeffion or Party foever they may have\nbeen, \\vith Exception only to the Reverend and\nRight Reverend among our felves.\nThe Sacred, as above, being thus hook d in,\nand the DEVIL being at the Head of their Af\nfairs, Matters went on moll glorioufly his own\nway , firft, the Biihops fell to bandying and Party-\nmaking for the Superiority, as heartily as ever\nTemporal Tyrants did for Dominion, and took as\nblack and devilifh Methods to carry it on, as the\nworft of thofe Tyrants ever had done before\nthem.\nAt la ft Satan declared for the Roman Pontiff,\nand that upon excellent Conditions, in the Reign\nof the Emperor Mauritius &amp;gt;\nfor Boniface^ who\nhad long contended for the Title of Supreme,\nfell into a Treaty with Phocasj Captain of the\nEmperor s Guards , whether the Bargain was\nfrom Hell or not, let any one judge, the Condi\ntions abfolutely entitle the Devil to the Honour\nof making the Contract, viz. That Phocas firft\nmurthering his Mailer (the Emperor) and his Sons,\nBoniface mould countenance the Treafon, and\ndeclare him Emperor j and in Return, Phocas\nfhould acknowledge the Primacy of the Church\nof Rim?) and declare Boniface univerfal Bifliop,\nA blcfr\n\fof the DEVIL; 201\nA blefled Compact ! which at once fet the Devil\nat the Head of Affairs in the Chriflian World,\nas well Spiritual as Temporal, Ecclefiaftick and\nCivil. Since the Conqueft over Eve in Para-\ndife, by which Death and the DEVIL, Hand in\nHand, eftablifh d their firft Empire upon Earth,\nthe Devil never gain d a more important Point\nthan he gain d at this time.\nHe had indeed profpered in his Affairs tolerably\nwell for fome time before this, and his Intereft\namong the Clergy had got Ground for fome Ages j\nbut that was indeed a fecret Management, was\ncarried on privately, and with Difficulty 5 as in\nlowing Difcord and Faction among the People,\nperplexing the Councils of their Princes, and fe-\ncretly wheedling in with the dignified Clergy.\nAlfo he had raifed abundance of little Church-\nRebellions, by fetting up Hereticks of feveral\nKinds, and railing them Favourers among the\nClergy, fuch as Ebion^ Cerintbius^ PelagiuS) and\nothers.\nHe had drawn in the BHhops of Rome to fet\nup the ridiculous Pageantry of the KEY &amp;gt;\nand\nwhile he, the DEVIL, fet open the Gates of Hell\nto them all, fet them upon locking up the Gates\nof Heaven, and giving the Bifhop the Key 5 a\nCheat which, as\ngrofs as it was, the DEVIL fo\ngilded over, or fo blinded the Age to receive it,\nthat like Gideon s\nEphod, all the Catholick World\nwent a whoring after the Idol $ and the Bifhop\nof Rome fent more Fools to the Devil by it than\never he pretended to let into Heaven, though he\nopen d the Door as wide as his Key was able to\ndo.\nThe Story of this Key being given to the Bi-\nihop of Rome by St. Peter^ (who, by the way,\niiever had it himfelf,) and of its\nbeing loft by\nSomebody or other, (the Devil it feems did not\n5\ntell\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\ntell them who) and its\nbeing found again by a\nLombard Soldier in the Army of King Antbaris^\nwho attempting to cut it with his Knife, was\nmiraculoufly forced to direct the Wound to him-\nfelf, and cut his own Throat j that King Antkarh\nand his Nobles happened to fee the Fellow do it,\nand were converted to Chriftianity by it, and that\nthe King fent the Key, with another made like\nit, to Pope PelagiuS) then Bifhop of Rome, who\nthereupon aflum d the Power of opening and\n(hutting Heaven s Gates &amp;gt;\nand he afterwards fet&amp;gt;\nting a Price or Toll upon the Entrance, as we\ndo here at paffing a Turn-pike 5 thefe fine things,\nI fay, were fuccefsfully managed for fome Years\nbefore this I am now (peaking of, and the Devil\ngot a great deal of Ground by it too 3 but now\nhe triumph d openly, and having fet up a Mur-\ntherer upon the temporal Throne, and a Church\nEmperor upon the Ecclefiaftic Throne, and both\nof his own choofing, the Devil may be faid to\nbegin his new Kingdom from this Epocha, and\ncall it the Reftoration.\nSince this time indeed the Devil s Affairs went\nvery merrily on, and the Clergy brought fo ma\nny Gewgaws into their Worfhip, and fuch devililh\nPrinciples were mixt with that which we calPd\nthe Chriftian Faith, that in a Word, from this\nTime the Bifhop of Rome commenced IVkore of\nBabylon, in all the mod exprefs Terms that could\nbe ipnagin d ;\nTyranny of the word fort crept\ninto the Pontificate, Errors of all forts into\nthe Profeffion, and they proceeded from one\nthing to another, till the very Popes, for fo the\nBifhop of Rome was now called, by way of Di-\nflan&ion $ I fay, the Popes themfelves, their fpi-\nritual Guides, profefs d openly to confederate with\nthe Devil, and to carry on a perfonal and private\nCorrefpondence with him at the fame time, tak\ning\n\fof the DEVIL; 20$\ning upon them the Title of ChrirVs Vicar, and\nthe infallible Guide of the Confciences of Chri-\nilians.\nThis we have fundry Inftatices of in fome merry\nPopes,who, if Fame lies &amp;lt;tf,were Sorcerers, Magici\nans, had familiar Spirits, and immediate Conver-\nfation with the Devil, as well vifibly as inviilbly,\nand by this means became what we call Devils\nincarnate :\nUpon this account it is that I have\nleft the Converfation that palles between Devils\nand Men to this Place, as well becaufe I believe\nit differs much now in his modern State, from\nwhat it was in his antient State, and therefore\nthat which moffc concerns us belongs rather to\nthis part of his Hiitory j as alfo becaufe, as I am\nnow writing to the prefent Age, I choofe to bring\nthe moil fignificant Parts of his Hiftory, efpeci-\nally as they relate to our felves, into that Part of\nTime that we are mofl concerned in.\nThe Devil had once, as I obferv d before, the\nuniverfal Monarchy or Government of Mankind\nin himfelf, and I doubt not but in that flourifh-\ning State of his Affairs, he governed them like\nwhat he is\n(viz.) an abfolute Tyrant &amp;gt;\nduring this\ntheocracy of his, for Satan is calTd the God of this\nWorld, he did not familiarize himfelf to Man\nkind fo much, as he finds Occafion to do now,\nthere was not then fo much need of it j he govern\ned then with an abfolute Sway&amp;gt;\nhe had his Ora\ncles, where he gave Audience to his Votaries\nlike a Deity, and he had his Sub-Gods, who un\nder his fevcral Difpofitions receiv d the Homage\nof Mankind in their Names 5 fuch were all the\nRabble of the Heathen Deities, from Jupiter the\nSupreme, to the Lares or Houfhold Gods of every\nFamily j thefe, I fay, like Refidents, received the\nProflrations^ but the Homage was all Satan s ; the\nDevil had the Subftance of it al!5 which was the\nIdolatry, During\n\f204 The Modern HISTORY\nDuring this Adminiftration of Hell, there was\nIe6 Witchcraft, lefs true literal Magick than there\nhas been fince $ there was indeed no need of it,\nthe DEVIL did not ftoop to the Mechanifm of\nhis more modern Operations, but rul d as a Deity,\nand receiv d the Vows and the Bows of his Subjects\nin more State, and with more Solemnity 5 whereas\nfince that, he is content to employ more Agents\nand take more Pains himfelf too 3 now he runs up\nand down Hackney in the World, more like a\nDrudge than a Prince, and much more trran he\ndid then.\nHence all thofe Things we call\nApparitions and\nVifions of Ghofls, Familiar-Spirits and Dealings\nwith the Devil, of which there is fo great a Va\nriety in the World at this Time, were not fo much\nknown among the People, in thofe firft\nAges of\nthe Devil s\nKingdom 5 in a Word, the Devil feems\nto be put to his Shifts, and to fly to Art and\nStratagem for the carrying on his Affairs, much\ninorc now than he did then.\nOne Reafon for this may be, that he has been\nmore difcover d and exposed in thefe Ages, than\nhe was before $ then he could appear in the World\nin his own proper Shapes, and yet not be known j\nwhen the Sons of GOD appeared at the divine\nSummons, Satan came along with them 5 but now\nhe has plaid fo many fcurvy Tricks upon Men, and\nthey know him fo well, that he is\noblig d to play\nquire out of fight and act in difguife $ Mankind\nwill allow nothing of his doing, and hear no\nthing of his faying, in his own Namej and if you\npropofe any Thing to be done, and it be but faid\nthe Devil is to help in the doing it, or if you fay\nof any Man he deals with the Devil, or the Devil\nhas a Hand in it, every Body flies him and fhuns\nas themoft frightful Thing in the World.\nNay,\n\fof the D E V I L; 205\nNay, if any Thing ftrange and improbable be\ndone or related to be done, we prefendy fay the\nDevil was at the doing it : Thus the great Ditch\nat Newmarket Heatb^ is call d the Devil s Ditch $\nfo the Devil built Cropland Abby, and the Whif-\npering-Place in Gloucefter Cathedral j nay, the\nCave at Caftkton^ only becaufe there s no getting\nto the farther End of it, is call d the Devil s A\nand the like: The poor People of Wiltjhire^ when\nyou ask them how the great Stones at Stonehengc\nwere brought thither ?\nthey ll all tell you theZte-\nv\/7 brought them : If any Mifchief extraordinary\nbefalls us, we prefently fay the Devil was in it,\nand the Devil would have it fo 5 in a Word, the\nDevil has got an ill Name among us, and fo he\nis fain to act more in fenebris^ more incog, than\nhe ufed to do, play out of fight himfelf, and work\nby the Sap, as the Engineers call it, and not open\nly and avowedly in his own Name and Perfon, as\nformerly, tho perhaps not with lefs Succefs than\nhe did before 3 and this leads me to enquire more\nnarrowly into the manner of the Devil s Manage\nment of his Affairs fince the Chriftian Religion\nbegan to fpread in the World, which manifeftly\ndiffers from his Conduct in more antient Times 5\nin which if wcdifcover fome of the moftconfum-\nmate Fool s\nPolicy, the mofl profound fimple\nCraft, and the moft fubtle ihallow Management\nof Things that can by our weak Underftandings\nbe conceiv d, we muft only refolve it into this,\nthat in fhort it is the DEVIL.\nCHAP\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\nCHAP. II.\nOf Hellas it is reprefented to us, and how\nthe Devil is to be underftood, as being per-\nfonally in Hell, when at the fame Time\nwe find him at Liberty ranging over the\nWorld.\nIT\nis true, as that learn d and pleafant Author, the\ninimitable Dr. Brown fays, the Devil is his own\nHell y one of the moft conftituting Parts of his In\nfelicity is, that he cannot ac~b\nupon Mankind brevi\nManu^ by his own inherent Power, as well as\nRage $\nthat he cannot unhinge this Creation, which, as I\nhave obfertfdin its Place, he had the uttnoft Averfi-\non to from its\nBeginning, as it was a flated Defign\nin the Creator to fupply his Place in Heaven with\na new Species of Beings calPd Man, and fill the\nVacancies occafion d by his Degeneracy and Re\nbellion.\nThis fill d him with Rage inexpreffible, and\nhorrible Refolutions of Revenge, and the Impof-\niibility of executing thofe Refolutions torments\nhim with Defpair &amp;gt;\nthis added to what he was\nbefore, makes him a compleat Devil^ with a Hell\nin his own Breaft, and a Fire unquenchable burn\ning about his Heart.\nI might enlarge here, and very much to the\nPurpofe, in defcribing fpherically and mathemati\ncally that exquifite Quality call d a devilijh Spi-\nrit) in which it would naturally occur to give you\na whole Chapter upon the glorious Articles of\nMalice and Envy, and efpecially upon that lufcious,\ndelightful, triumphant Paffion call d REVENGE*\nhow natural to Man, nay even to both Sexes ^\nhow pleafant in the very Contemplation, tho\nthere\n\f&fthe DEVIL: 207\nthere be not juft at that Time a Power of Exe\ncution 3 how palatable it is in it (elf, and how\nwell it relifties when difh d up with its\nproper\nSauces, fuch as Plot, Contrivance, Scheme, and\nConfederacy, all\nleading on to Execution: How\nk poflefles a human Soul in all the moft fenfible\nParts j how it empowers Mankind to fin in I-\nmagination, as effectually to all future Intents\nand Purpofes (Damnation) as if he had finned\nactually : How fafe a Practice it is\ntoo, as to Pu-\nnifhment in this Life, namely, that it\nempowers\nus to cut Throats clear of the Gallows, to (lan\nder Virtue, reproach Innocence, wound Honour\nand rtab Reputation &amp;gt;\nand in a Word, to do all\nthe wicked Things in the World, out of the\nReach of the Law.\nIt would alfo require fome few Words to de-\nfcribe the fecret Operations of thofe nice Quali\nties when they reach the human Soul j how ef\nfectually they form a Hell within us, and how\nimperceptibly they affimilate and transform us in\nto Devils, meer human Devils, as really Devils as\nSatan himfelf, or any of his Angels ; and that there\nfore tis not fo much out of the Way, as fome\nimagine, to fay, fuch a Man is an incarnate Devil j\nfor as Crime made Satan a Devil^ who was before\na bright immortal Seraph, or Angel ofLight 5 how\nmuch more eafily may the fame Crime make the\nfame DEVIL, tho every Way meaner and more\ncontemptible, of a Man or a Woman either? But\nthis is too grave a Subject for me at this Time.\nThe Devil being thus, I fay, fir d with Rage\nand Envy, in coniequence of his Jealoufy upon\nthe Creation of Man, his Torment is encreafed\nto the higheft by the Limitation of his Power,\nand his being forbid to act againft Mankind by\nForce of Arms &amp;gt;\nthis is, I fay, part of his \/&\/\/,\n\\vhich? as above, is within him, and which he\ncarries\n\f20S The Modern HI S TORY\ncarries with him wherever he goes j nor is it fo\ndifficult to conceive of He!\/9 or of the Z&amp;gt;m7,\neither under this juft Defcription, as it is\nby all\nthe ufual Notions that we are taught to enter\ntain of them, by (the old Women) our Inftruc-\ntors &amp;gt;\nfor every Man may, by taking but a com\nmon View of himfelf, and making a juft Scrutiny\ninto his own Paffions, on fome of their particular\nExcurfions, fee a \/&\/\/ within himfelf, and himfelf a\nmeer Devil as long as the Inflammation lafts &amp;gt;\nand\nthat as really, and to all Intents and Purpofes, as if\nhe had the Angel (Satan) before his Face, in his Lo\ncality and Perfonality ; that is to fay, all Devil\nand Monfter in his Perfon, and an immaterial but\nintenfe Fire flaming about and from within him,\nat all the Pores of his Body.\nThe Notions we receive of the Devil, as a Per&quot;\nfon being in Hell as a Place^ are infinitely abfurd\nand ridiculous j the firft we are certain is not true\nin Fact, becaufe he has a certain Liberty, (however\nlimited that is not to the Purpofe) is\ndaily vifible,\nand to be trac d in his feveral Attacks upon Man\nkind, and has been fo ever fince his firit\nAppear\nance in Paradife 3 as to his corporal Viiibility\nthat is not the prefent Queftion neither j tis\nenough that we can hunt him by the Foot, that\nwe can follow him as Hounds do a Fox upon a\nhot Scent : We can fee him as plainly by the Ef\nfect, by the Mifchief he does, and more by the\nMifchief he puts us upon doing, ffay, as plainly,\nas if we faw him by the Eye.\nIt is not to be doubted but the Devil can fee us\nwhen and where we cannot fee him : and as he\nhas a Perfonality, tho it be fpirituous, he and his\nAngels too may be reafonably fuppofed to inhabit\nthe World of Spirits, and to have free Accefs from\nthence to the Regions of Life, and to pafs and\nrepafs in the Air, as really, tho not perceptible to\nus.\n\f&f tke DEVI L. 209\nus, as the Spirits of Men do after their releafe\nfrom the Body, pafs to the Place (wherever that\nis)\nwhich is\nappointed for them.\nIf the Devil was confin d to a Place (Hell) as a\nPrifon, he could then have no Buiinefs here 3 and\nif we pretend to defcribe \/&\/\/, as not a Prifon,\nbut that the Devil has Liberty to be there, or not\nbe there as he pleafed, then he would certainly\nnever be there, or Hell is not fuch a Place as we\nare taught to underfland it to be.\nIndeed according to forne, Hell fhotild be a\nPlace of Fire and Torment to the Souls that are\ncall into it, but not to the Devils themfelves &amp;gt;\nwho we make little more or leis than keepers and\nTurnkeys to Hell, as a Goal 3 that they are\nfent about to bring Souls thither, lock them in\nwhen they come, and then away upon the Scent\nto fetch more : That one Sort of Devils are made\nto live in the World among Men, and to be bufy\ncontinually debauching and deluding Mankind\nbringing them as it were to the Gates of Hell;\nand then another Sort are Porters and Carriers\nto fetch them in.\nThis is, in JJjort^ little more or lefs than the old\nStory of Pluto, of Cerberus^ and of Charon 3 only\nthat our Tale is not half fo well told, nor the\nParts of the Fable fo well laid\ntogether.\nIn all thefe Notions of Hell and Devil^ the Tor- -\nments of the firft, and the Agency of the laft\nTormenting, we meet with not one Word of\nthe main and perhaps only Accent of Horror,\nwhich belongs to us to judge of about Hell, I\nmean the Abfence of Heaven 3 Expulfion, and\nExclusion from the Prefence and Face of the\nchief Ultimate, the only eternal and fufficient\nGood 3 and this lofs fuftain d by a fordid Neglect\nof our Concern in that excellent Part, in ex\nchange for the molt contemptible and juftly\ncon-\nP demn d\n\faio The Modern HISTORY\ndemn d Trifles, and all this eternal and irreco\nverable : Thefe People tell us nothing of the eter\nnal Reproaches of Confciencc, the Horror of Def-\nperation, and the Anguifh of a Mind hopelefs\nof ever feeing the Glory, which alone conftitutes\nHeaven, and which makes all other Places dread\nful, and even Darknefs it felf.\nAnd this brings me directly to the Point in\nHand, (viz.) the State ofthat Hell which we ought\nto have in view when we tpcak of the Devil as\nin Hell : This is the very Hell, which is the Tor\nment of the Devil; in ftiort, the Devil is in HELL,\nand HELL is in the Devil &amp;gt;\nhe is filPd with this\nunquenchable Fire, he is\nexpePd the Place of\nGlory, banifli d from the Regions of Light,\nAbfence from the Life of all Beatitude is his\nCurfe, Defpair is the reigning Paflion in his Mind,\nand all the little Condiment Parts of his Tor\nment, fuch as Rage, Envy, Malice, and Jealoufy\nare confolidated in this, to make his Mifery com-\npleat, (viz.) the Duration of it all, the Eternity of\nhis Condition &amp;gt;\nthat he is without Hope, with\nout Redemption, without Recovery.\nIf any thing can inflame this Hell and make it\nhotter, tis this only, and this does add an inex-\nprcilible\nHorror to the Devil himfelfj namely^ the\nfeeing Man (the only Creature he hates) placed\nin a State of Recovery, a glorious Eftablimment\nof Redemption form d for him in Heaven, and the\nScheme of it\nperfected on Earth 3 by which this\nMan^ tho even the Devil by his Art may have de\nluded him, and drawn him into Crime, is\nyet in a\nState of Recovery, which the Devil is not $ and\nthat it is not in his (Satan s)\nPower to prevent it :\nNow take the Devil as he is in his own Nature\nAngelic, a bright immortal Seraph, Heaven-born,\nand having tafled the eternal Beatitude, which\nthefe are appointed to enjoy j the Lofs of that\n4 State\n\fof the D E V I L. 21 r\nState to himfelf, the PofTeffion of it\ngranted to his\nRival tho wicked like and as himfelf3 I fay, cake\nthe Devil as he is, having a quick Senfe of his own\nPerdition, and a flinging Sight of his Rival s Fe\nlicity, tis Hell enough^ and more than enough,\neven for an Angel to fupport j nothing we can\nconceive can be worfe.\nAs to any other Fire than this, fuch and fo im\nmaterially intenfe as to Torment a Spirit, which\nis it felf Fire alfo 3 I will not fay it cannot be,\nbecaufe to Infinite every Thing is\npoffible, but\n1 mufl fay, I cannot conceive rightly of it.\nI will not enter here into the Wifdorn or Rea-\nfonablenefs of rcprefcnting the Torments of Hell\nto be Fire, and that Fire to be a Commixture of\nFlame and Sulphur \\ it has pleafed God to let\nthe Horror of thofe eternal Agonies about a loft\nHeaven, be laid before us by thofe Similitudes or\nAllegories, which are moft moving to our Senfes and\nto our Under(land ings ; nor will I\ndifpute the PofTi-\nbility 3 much lefs wr\nili I doubt but that there is to be\na Confummation of Mifery to all the Objects of\nMifery when the Devil s\nKingdom in this World\nending with the World it felf, that Liberty he\nhas now may be farther abridged 3 when he may be\nreturn d to the fame State he was in between the\nTime of his Fall and the Creation of the World &amp;gt;\nwith perhaps fome additional Vengeance on him,\nfuch as at prefent we cannot defcribe, for all that\nTreafon and thofe high Crimes and Mifdemeanours\nwhich he has been guilty of here, in his Convcr-\nfation with Mankind.\nAs his Infelicity will be then confummated and\ncompleated, fo the Infelicity of that Part of Man\nkind, who are condemned with him, may receive\na confiderable Addition from thofe Words in their\nSentence, to be tormented with the Devil and his\nP z\n\f2ii The A\/&amp;lt;^\/m* HISTORY\nAngels;

but I\nmuit own, that to me nothing can be more ridi\nculous than the Notions that we entertain and\n11 our Heads with about Hell^ and about the De-\n2\/Ts being there tormenting of Souls, broiling\nthem upon Gridirons, hanging them up upon\nHooks, carrying them upon their Backs, and the\nlike, with the feveral Pictures of \/&\/\/, repre-\nlented by a great Mouth with horrible Teeth, gap\ning like a Cave on the Sides of a Mountain j fup-\npofe that appropriated to Satan in the Peak^ which\nindeed is not much unlike it, with a Stream of\nFire coming out of ir, as there is of Water,\nand {mailer Devils going and coming continually\nin and out, to fetch and carry Souls the Lord\nknows whither, and for the Lord knows what.\nThcfe Things, however intended for Terror,\nare indeed fo ridiculous, that the Devil himfelf, to\nbe fure, mocks at them, and a Man of Senfe can\nhardly refrain doing the like, only I avoid it, be-\nc;aufe I would not give offence to weaker Heads.\nHowever,\n\fof the D E V IL. 213\nHowever, I muft not Compliment the Brains\nof other Men, at the Expence of my own, or\ntalk Nonfenfe becaufe they can underfland no\nother j I think all thefe Notions and Reprcfenta-\ntions of Hell and of the Devil, to be as prophane\nas they are ridiculous, and I ought no more to\ntalk prophanely than merrily of them.\nLet us learn to talk of thefe Things then, as\nwe fhould do &amp;gt;\nand as we really cannot deferibc\nthem to our Reafon and Understanding, why\nShould we defcribe them to our Senfes &amp;gt;\nwe had,\nI think, much better not defcribe them at all, that\nis to fay, not attempt it : The blefTed Apoftle St.\nPaul was, as he faid hirnfelf, carried up, or caught\nup into the third Heaven, yet when he came\ndown again, he could neither tell what he heard\nor defcribe what he was $ all he could lay of it\nwas, that what he heard was inuticralle, and\nwhat he faw was inconceivable.\nIt is the fame thing as to the State of the\nDevil in thofe Regions which he now potteries,\nand where he now more particularly inhabits &amp;gt;\nmy\nprefent Bufinefs then is not to enter into thofe\nfrave\nThings fo as to make them ridiculous, as\nthink molt People do that talk of them 5 but\nas the Devil, let his Refidence be where it will,\nhas evidently free Leave to come and go, not\ninto this World only 3 ( I mean, the Region of our\njftmofphere,) but for ought we know, to all the\nother inhabited Worlds which God has made,\nwhere-ever they are, and by whatfoever Names\nthey are or may be known or diftinguiflied j for\nif he is not confined in one Place, we have no\nReafon to believe he is excluded from any Place,\nHeaven only excepted, from whence he was ex-\npeird for his Treafon and Rebellion.\nHis Liberty then being thus afcertain d, three\nThings fecm to be material for us to give an Ao\nP 3 count\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\ncount of, in order to form this Part of his Hit\ntory.\ni .

III.\nOf the Manner of SatanV atiing and carry-\ning on his Affairs in this World, andpar\nticularly of his ordinary Workings in the\ndark, by Pofleffion and Agitation.\nTHE\nDEVIL being thus reduc d to ab upon\nMankind by Stratagem only, it remains to\nenquire how he performs., and which way he di\nrects his Attacks &amp;gt;\nthe Faculties of Man are a\nkind of a Garrifon in a ilrong Caftle, which as\nthey defend it on the one hand under the Command\nof the reafoning Power of Man s Soul, fo they\nare prefcribed on the other hand, and can t fally\nout without Leave j for the Governor of a Fort\ndoes not permit his Soldiers to hold any Corre-\nfpondence with the Enemy, without fpecial\nOr\nder and Direction. Now the great Enquiry be\nfore us is. How comes the DEVIL to a Parley\nwith us ? how does he converfe with our Senfes,\narid with the Underftanding ? How does he reach\nus, which way does he come at the Affections,\nand which way does he move the Pailions ? Tis\na little difficult to difcover this treafonable Corre-\nfpondence, and that Difficulty is indeed the Devil s\nAdvantage, and, for ought I fee, the chief Ad\nvantage he has over Mankind.\nIt is alio a great Enquiry here, whether the Devil\nknows our Thoughts or no? If I\nmay give my\nOpinion, I am with the negative &amp;gt;\nI deny that he\nknows any thing of our Thoughts, except of\nthofe\nThoughts which he puts us upon thinking,\nfor I will not doubt but he has the Art to injecl:\nThoughts, and to revive dormant Thoughts in us :\nIc is not fo wild a Scheme as fome take it to be,\n2. that\n\fof the DEVIL. 217\nthat Mr. Milton lays down, to reprefent the Devil\ninjecting corrupt Defires and wandring Thoughts\ninto the Head of Eve^ by Dreams, and that he\nbrought her to Dream whatever he put into her\nThoughts, by whifpering to her vocally when\nfhe was afleep 5 and to this End, he imagines the\nDEVIL laying himfelf clofe to her Ear, in the\nShape of a Toad, when fhe was fall\nafleep &amp;gt;\nI\nfay, this is not fo wild a Scheme, feeing even\nnow, if\nyou can whifper any thing clole to the\nEar of a Perfon in a deep Sleep, fo as to fpeak\ndistinctly to the Perfon, and yet not awaken him,\nas has been frequently tried, the Perfon fleeping\n{hall dream diftinctly of what you fay to him*\nnay, fliall dream the very Words you fay.\nWe have then no more to ask, but how the\nDEVIL can convey himfelf to the Ear of a fleep-\ning Perfon, and it.is\ngranted then that he may have\nPower to make us dream what he pleafes : But\nthis is not all, for if he can fo forcibly, by his\ninvifible Application, caufe us to dream, what he\npleafes, why can he not with the fame Facility\nprompt our Thoughts, whether fleeping or\nwaking ? To dream, is\nnothing elfe but to think\nfleeping j and we have abundance of deep-headed\nGentlemen among us, who give us ample Tefii-\nmony that they dream waking.\nBut if the DEVIL can prompt us to dream,\nthat is to fay, to think, yet if he does not know\nour Thoughts, how then can he tell whether\nthe Whifper had its EfFec~b ? The anfwer is\nplain,\nthe DEVIL, like the Angler, baits the Hook, if\nthe Fifh bite he lies ready to take the Advantage,\nhe whifpers to the Imagination, and then waits\nto fee how it works &amp;gt;\nas Naomi faid to Ruth^\nChap. iii.\nf, 18. Sit ftill^ my Daughter, until thou,\nknow ho W the Matter will fall, for the Man will\nwt be at reft until he have finijhed the thing. Thus\nwhen\n\f2U The Modern HISTORY\nwhen the DEVIL had whifper d to Eve in her\nSleep, according to Milton^ and fuggefted Mifchief\nto her Imagination, he only fat {till to fee how\nthe Matter would work, for he knew if it took\nwith her, he fhould hear more of it&amp;gt;\nand then\nby finding her alone the next Day, without her\nordinary Guard her Husband, he prefently con\ncluded flie had fwallowed the Bait, and fo at-\ntack d her afrefh.\nA fmall deal of Craft, and lefs by far than we\nhave reafon to believe the Devil is Mailer of, will\nferve to difcover whether fuch and fuch Thoughts\nas he knows he has fuggefted, have taken Place\nor no &amp;gt;\nthe Adbion of the Perfon prefently difco-\nvers it, at leaft to him that lies\nalways upon the\nWutch, and has every Word, every Gefture, e~\nvery Step we take fubfequent to his Operation,\nopen to him j it\nmay therefore, for ought we\nknow, be a great Miilake, and what moil of us\nare guilty of7 to tell our Dreams to one another\nin the Morning, after we have been diflurb d with\nthem in the Night &amp;gt;\nfor if the Devil converfes\nwith us fo infenfibly as fome are of the Opinion\nhe does, that is to fay, if he can hear as far as\nwe can fee, we may be telling our Story to him\nindeed, when we think we are only talking to\none another.\nThis brings me moil naturally to the impor\ntant Enquiry, whether the Devil can walk about\nthe World invidbly or no? The Truth is, this\nis no queilion to me} for as I have taken away\nhis Vifibility already, and have denied him all\nPrefcience of Futurity too, and have prov d he\ncannot know our Thoughts, nor put any Force\nupon Perfons or Aftions, if we ihould take away\nhis Invifibility too, we ihould undmil him quite,\nto all Intents and Purpofes, as to any Mifchief\nhe could do j nay, it would baniflihim the World,\nand\n\fof the DEVIL:\nand he might e en go and feek his Fortune fome\nwhere elfe , for if he could neither be vifible or\ninvifible, neither act in publick or in private, he\ncould neither have Bufinefs or Being in this\nSphere, nor could we be any way concerned with\nhim.\nThe Devil therefore mofl certainly has a Power\nand Liberty of moving about in this World, af\nterfome manner or another ; this is\nverify d as well\nby way of Allegory, as by way of Hiftory, in\nthe Scripture it felf 5 and as the firft\nftrongly\nfuggefts and fuppofes it to be fo, the laft\npofi-\ntively aflerts it-, and, not to croud this Work\nwith Quotations from a Book which we have\nnot much to do with in the Devil s\nStory, at\nleaft not much to his Satisfaction, I only hint his\nperfonal Appearance to our Saviour in the Wil-\nderneis, where it is faid, the Devil taketh him up\nto an exceeding high Mountain , and in another\nPlace, the Devil departed from him. What Shape\nor Figure he appeared in, we do not find men\ntioned, but I cannot doubt his\nappearing to him\nthere, any more than I can his talking to our Sa\nviour in the Mouths, and with the Voices of the\nfeveral Perfons who were under the terrible Af\nfliction of an a&ual PofTeflion.\nThefe Things leave us no room to doubt of\nwhat is advanced above, namely, that he, (the\nDevil) has a certain Refidence, or Liberty of\nredding in, and moving about upon the Surface of\nthis Earth, as well as in the Compals of the At-\nmofphere, vulgarly call d the Air^ in fome manner\nor other: That is the general.\nIt remains to enquire into the manner, which I\nrefolve into two Kinds\n.\nOrdinary, which I fuppofe to be his invi-\nfible Motions as a Spirit 3 under which Con-\niideration\n\fizo The Modern HISTORY\nfideration I fuppofe him to have an uncort-\njfin d, unlimited, unreftrain d Liberty, as to\nthe manner of a6Hng &amp;gt;\nand this either in\nPerfons, by PofMion&amp;gt; or in Things, by A-\ngitation.\nz. Extraordinary &amp;gt;\nwhich I underfbnd to be\nhis Appearances in borrowed Shapes and Bo\ndies, or Shadows rather of Bodies 5 afluming\nSpeech, Figure, Pofture, and fcveral Pow\ners, of which we can give little or no Ac\ncount 5 in which extraordinary manner of\nAppearances, he is either limited by a fupe-\nrior Power, or limits himfelf politically, as\nbeing not the Way moil for his Intcreit or\nPurpofe, to act in his Bufinefs, which is\nmore effectually done in his State of Obfcu-\nrity.\nHence we muft fuppofe the Devil has it\nvery\nmuch in his own Choice, whether to act in one Ca\npacity,\nor in the other, or in both} that is to\nlay, of appearing, and not appearing, as he finds\nfor his Purpofe : In this State of Invifibility, and\nunder the Operation ofthefe Powers and Liberties,\nlie performs all his Functions and Offices, as De-\ny\/7, as Prince of Darknefs, as God of this World,\nas Tempter, Accuier, Deceiver, and all whatfoever\nother Names of Office, or Titles of Honour he\nis known by.\nNow taking him in this large unlimited, or\nlittle limited State of Action, he is well calPd,\nthe God of this World^ for he has very much of\nthe Attribute of Omniprefence, and may be faid,\neither by himfslf or his Agents,\nto be every where,\nAnd fee every thing j that is to fay, every thing\nthat is vifible -,\nfor I cannot allow him any Share\nof Qmnifrisncz a: all.\nThat\n\fof the DEVIL, 221\nThat he ranges about every where, is with us9\nfcnd fometimes in us, fees when he is not feen,\nhears when he is not heard, comes in without\nLeave, and goes out without Noife, is neither\nto be fhut in or {hut out, that when he runs from\nus we can t catch him, and when he runs after us\nwe can t\nefcape him, is feen when he is not known,\nand is known when he is not feen j all thefe\nthings, and more, we have Knowledge enough\nabout to convince us of the Truth of them} fo that,\nas I have faid above, he is\ncertainly walking to\nand fro thro the Earth, &c. after fome manner\nor otherj\nand in fome Figure or other, vifible or\ninvifiblc, as he finds Occanon. Now in order\nto make our Hiflory of him complete, the next\nQueftion before us is, how, and in what man\nner he afts with Mankind ? how his Kingdom is\ncarried on, and by what Methods he does his Bu-\nfmefs, for he certainly has a great deal of Bufinefs\nto do 5 he is not an idle Spectator, nor is he walk\ning about incognito,and cloth d inMift and Dark-\nnefs, purely in Kindnefs to us, that we fhould\nnot be frighted at him 3 but tis in Policy, that\nhe may ab undifcover d, that he may fee and not\nbe feen, may play his Game in the dark, and not\nbe detefted in his Roguery ; that he may prompt\nMifchief, raife\nTempefts, blow up Coals, kindle\nStrife, embroil Nations, ufe Inftruments, and not\nbe known to have his Hand in any thing, when\nat the fame time he really has a Hand in every\nthing.\nSome are of Opinion, and I among the refi^\nthat if the Devil was perfonally and vifibly pre-\nfent among us, and we converfed with him Face\nto Face, we fhould be fo familiar with him in a\nlittle time, that his ugly Figure would not affecl\nus at all, that his- Terrors would not fright us,\nor that we fhould any more trouble our felves\nabout\n\f222 The Modern HISTORY\nabout him, than we did with the laft great Co\nmet in 1678. which appear d fo long and fo con-\nftantly without any particular known Event, that\nat laft we took no more Notice of it than of the\nother ordinary Stars which had appear d before\nwe or our Anceftors were born.\nNor indeed fhould we have much Reafon to be\nfrighted at him, or atleaft none of thofe filly Things\ncould be faid of him which we now amufe our\nfelves about, and by which we fet him up like a\nScare-Crow to fright Children and old Women,\nto fill\nup old Stories, make Songs and Ballads,\nand in a Word, carry on the low priz d Buf\nfoonery ofthe common People &amp;gt;\nwe fhould either\nfee him in his Angelic Form, as he was from the\nOriginal, or if he has any Deformities entail d\nupon him by the fupreme Sentence, and in Ju-\nilice to the Deformity of his Crime, they would\nbe of a fuperior Nature, and fitted more for our\nContempt as well as Horror, than thofe weak fan\ncied Trifles contrived by our antient Devil-raifers\nand Devil- makers, to feed the wayward Fancies\nof old Witches and Sorcerers, who cheated the\nignorant World with a Devil of their own mak\ning, fet forth, in terrorem, with Bat s\nWings,\nHorns, cloven Foot, long Tail, fork d Tongue,\nand the like.\nIn the next Place, be his frightful Figure what it\nwould, and his Legions as numerous as theHoftof\nHeaven, we fhould fee him ftill, as the Prince of De\nvils, tho* monftrous as a Dragon, flaming as a Co\nmet, tall as a Mountain, yet dragging his Chain\nafter him equal to the utmoft of his fuppofed\nStrength; always in Cuftody of his Jailors the\nAngels, his Power over-power d, his\nRage cow d\nand abated, or at leaft aw d and under Corre&ion,\nlimited and reflrain d \\ in a Word, we fhould\nfee him a vanquifh d Slave, his Spirit broken,\nhis\n\fof the D EVIL; 22\nhis Malice, tho not abated, yet Hand-cuff d and\noverpower d, and he not able to work any Thing\nagainft us by Force &amp;gt;\nfo that he would be to us but\nlike the Lions in the Tower, encag d and lock d\nup, unable to do the Hurt he wimes to do, and\nthat we fear, or indeed any hurt at all.\nFrom hence tis evident, that tis not his Bu-\nfinefs to be public, or to walk up and down in\nthe World vifibly, and in his own Shape &amp;gt;\nhis\nAffairs require a quite different Management, as\nmight be made apparent from the Nature of\nThings, and the Manner of our Actings, as Men,\ncither with our felves or to one another.\nNor could he be ferviceable in his Generation,\nas a public Perfon as now he is, or anfwer the\nEnd of his Party who employ him, and who, if\nhe was to do their Bufinefs in public, as he does\nin private, would not be able to employ him\nat ail.\nAs in our modern Meetings for the Propagation\nof Impudence and other Virtues, there would be\nno Entertainment and no Improvement for the\nGood of the Age, if the People did not all\nap\npear in Mafque, and conceal d from the com\nmon Observation j fo neither could Satan (from\nwhofe Management tbofe more happy AfTem-\nblies are taken as Copies of a glorious Original)\nperform the ufual and neceflary Bu finefs of his\nProfefSon, if he did not appear wholly in Covert\nand under needful Difguifesy how, but for the\nConvenience of his Habit, could he caft himfelf\ninto fo many Shapes, aft on fo many different\nScenes, and turn fo many Wheels of State in the\nWorld, as he has done ? as\/a meer profeiVd Zte-\nvil he could do nothing.\nHad he been oblig d always to aft the meer\nDevil in his own Clothes, and with his own Shape,\nappearing uppermoft in ail Cafes and Places, he\ncould\n\f224- The Modern HISTORY\ncould never have preach d in fo many Pulpits^\nprefided in fo many Councils, voted in fo many\nCommittees, fat in fo many Courts, and influenced\nfo many Parties and Factions in Church and State,\nas we have Reafon to believe he has done in our\nNation, and in our Memories too, as well as in\nother Nations and in more antient Times. The\nShare Satan has had in all the weighty Confufions\nof the Times, ever fince the firft\nAges of Chrifti-\nanity in the World, has been carried on with fo\nmuch Secrefy, and fo much with an Air of Ca*\nbal and Intrigue, that nothing can have been\nmanag d more fubtilly and clofcly, and in the fame\nManner has he a&ed in our Times, in order to\nconceal his Intereft, and conceal the Influence he\nhas had in the Councils of the World.\nHad it been potllble for him to have raifed the\nFlames of Rebellion and War fo often in this\nNation, as he certainly has done ? Could he have\nagitated the Parties on both Sides, and inflam d\nthe Spirits\nof three Nations, if he had appeared in\nhis own Dreis, a meer naked DEVIL? It is not the\nDevil as a Devil^ that does the Mifchief, but the\nDevil in Mafquerade, Satan in full\nDifguife, and act\ning at the Head of civil Confufionand Diitra6Hon.\nif Hiitory may be credited, the French Court at\nthe Time of our old Confufions was made the Scene\nof Satan s Politicks, and prompted both Parties\nin England wA in Scotland alfo to quarrel, and how\nwas it done ? Will any Man offer to fcandalize the\nDevil fo much as to fay, or fo much as to fuggeft\nthat Satan had no Hand in it all? Did not the Devil^\nby the Agency of Cardinal Richlieu^ fend 400000\nCrowns at one TimeJ and 600000 at another, to\nthe Scots, to raife an Army and march boldly into\nEngland? and did not the fame Devil, at the fame\ntime, by other Agents, remit 800000 Crowns to\nthe other Party, in order to raife an Army to fall\nupon\n\ftftk DEVIL. 225\ntip\nan the Scots ? nay, did not the Devil with the\nfame Subtilty fend down the ArchbifhopJs Order\nto impofe the Service-Book upon the People in\nScotland^ and at the fame Time raife a Mob a-\ngainft it,\nin the great Church (at St. Giles s)?\nNay, did not he actually, in the Perfon of an old\nWoman (his favourite Inftrument) throw the\nthree-leg d Stool at the Service-Book, and ani\nmate the zealous People to take up Arms for Re\nligion, and turn Rebels for God Sake?\nAll thefe happy and fuccefsful Undertakings,\ntho tis no more to be doubted they were done\nby the Agency of Satan, and in a very furpriz-\ning Manner too, yet were all done in fecret, by\nwhat I Call Pofleflion and Injection, and by the\nAgency and Contrivance of fuch Internments, or\nby the Devil in the Difguife of fuch Servants as\nhe found out fitted to be employ d in his Work,\nand who he took a more effectual Care in con\ncealing of.\nBut we {hall have Occafion to touch all this Part\nover again, when we come to difcourfe of the par\nticular Habits and Difguifes which the Devil has\nmade ufe of, all\nalong in the World, the better\nto cover his Actions, and to conceal his being\nconcern d in them.\nIn the mean Time the Cunning or Artifice the\nDevil makes ufe of in all thefe Things is in it felf\nVery considerable 5 tis an old Practice of hisufing,\nand he has gone on in diverfe Meafures, for the\nbetter concealing himfelf in it ; which Meafures,\ntho he varies fometimes, as his extraordinary Af\nfairs\nrequire, yet they are in all\nAges much the\nfame, and have the fame Tendency -&amp;gt;\nnamely, that\nhe may get all his Bufinefs carried on by the In-\nflrumentality of Fools -,\nthat he may make Man\nkind Agents in their own Deftruftion, and thac\nhe may have all his Work done in fuch a Manner\nQ_ as\n\f^26 The Modern HISTORY\nas that he may fccm to have no Hand in it ; nay he\ncontrives fo well, that the very Name Devil is\nput\nupon his oppofite Party, and the Scandal of the\nblack Agent lies all\nupon them.\nIn order then to look a little into his Conduit,\nlet us enquire into the common Miftakes about\nhim, fee what Ufe is made of them to his Ad\nvantage, and how far Mankind is\nimpofed upon\nin thofe Particulars, and to what Purpofe.\nCHAP.

and where he has met\nwith a little Check in his Politicks, has notwith-\nftanding, fo foon and fo\neafily\nrecovered himfelf,\nregained his loft Ground, or replaced himfelf in\nanother Country when he has been fupplanted in\none, that his Empire is far from being leflen d in\nthe World, for the laft thoufand Years of the\nChriftian Eftablifhment.\nSuppofe we take an Obfervation from the Be\nginning of Lutheri\nor from the Year 1420. and\ncall the Reformation a Blow to the Devil s\nKing\ndom, which before that was come to fuch a\nHeight in Chriflendom, that tis a Queftion not\nyet thorowly decided, whether that Medley of\nSuperftition and horrible Herefies, that Mafs of\nEnthufiam and Idols call d the Catholick Hierar\nchy, was a Church of God or a Church of the\nDevil; whether it was an AfTembly of Saints or\na\nSynagogue of Satan : I fay, take that Time to\nbe the Epocha of Satan s Declenilon and of Lu-\n4 cifer s\n\fof the D E V I L; 229\ncifer s\nfating from Heaven, that is, from the Top\nof his terreftrial Glory, yet whether he did not\ngain in the Defection of the Greek Church about\nthat Time and fince, as much as he loft in the\nReformation of the Roman, is what Authors are\nnot yet agreed about, not reckoning what he has\nregain d fince of the Ground which he had loft\neven by the Reformation, (viz.) the Countries of\nthe Duke of Savoy s Dominion, where the Re\nformation is almoft eaten out by Perfccution $ the\nwhole Faltoline and (bme adjacent Countries 3 the\nwhole Kingdom of Poland and almoft all\nHungary 5\nfor fince the laft War the Reformation, as it were,\nlies\ngafping for Breath, and expiring in that Coun\ntry, alfo feveral large Provinces in Germany, as\nAuftria^ Carinthia, and the whole Kingdom of\nBohemia, where the Reformation once powerful\nly planted, receiv d its Death s Wound at the\nBattle of Prague, Ann. 1617, and languifh d but\na very little while, died and was buried, and good\nKing POPERY reign d in its ftead.\nTo thefe Countries thus regain d to Satan s\ninfernal Empire, let us add his modern Conquefts\nand the Encroachments he has made upon the\nReformation in the prefent Age, which are, how\never light we make of them, very considerable (viz.)\nthe Electorate ofthe Rhine and the Palatinate, the\none fallen to the Houfe of Bavaria, and the other\nto that ofNeuburgh, both Popifh $ the Dutchy of\nDeux Fonts fallen juft now to a popilh Branch,\nthe whole Electorate of Saxony fallen under the\nPower of popifh Government by the Apoftacy of\ntheir Princes, and more likely to follow the Fate\nof Bohemia, whenever the diligent Devil can bring\nhis new Project in Poland to bear, as tis more\nthan probable he will do fo fome. time or other,\nby the growing Zeal as well as Power of ( that;\nHoufe of Bigots) the Houfe of A .\nBut\n\f230 The Modern HISTORY\nBut to fum up the dull Story 5 we mud add in\nthe Roll of the \/\/m\/ s\nConquefts, the whole King\ndom of France^ where we have in one Year feen,\nto the immortal Glory of the Devil s Politicks,\nthat his Meafures have prevailed to the total\nExtirpation of the Proteflant Churches without\na War &amp;gt;\nand that Intereft which for zoo Years\nhad fupported it felf in fpight of Perfections,\nMafiacres, five civil Wars and innumerable Bat\ntles and Slaughters, at lafl received its mortal\nWound from its own Champion Henry IV. and\nfunk into utter Oblivion, by Satan s\nmoftexquifite\nManagement under the Agency of his two prime\nMinilters Cardinal RiMieu and Lewis the XIV,\nwhom he entirely poflefs d.\nThus far we have a melancholy View of the\nDevil s new Conquefts, and the Ground he has re-\ngain d upon the Reformation, in which his fe-\ncret Management has been fo\nexquifite, and his\nPoliticks fo good, that could he bring but one\nThing to pafs, which by his own former Miflake,\n(for the Devil is not infallible) he has rendred im-\npoffible, he would bring the Proteflant Intereft\nfo near its Ruin, that Heaven would be, as It\nwere^ put to the Necefftty of working by Mira\ncle to prevent it ; the Cafe is thus.\nAntient Hiftorians tell us, and from good Au\nthority, that the DEVIL finding it for his Intereft -\nto bring his favourite Afoto^\/ upon the Stage, and\nfpread the victorious Half-Moon upon the Ruin\nof the Crofs, having with great Succefs, rais d\nfir ft the Saracen Empire, and then the Turkijh to\nfuch a Height, as that the Name of Chriltain ieem-\ncd to be extirpated in thofe two Quarters of the\nWorld, which were then not the greateft only,\nbut by far the moft powerful, I mean dfia, and Afri\nca ;\nhaving totally laid waft all thofe antient and\nflourifhing Churches of Afnca^ the Labours of\nSt.\n\fof the D E V I L, 231\nSt. Cyprian, fertullian, St. dugufline, and 670\nChriiiian Biihops and Fathers, who governed there\nat once, alfo all the Churches of Smyrna,\nPhila\ndelphia, Ephefus, Sardis, dnlioch, Laodicea, and\ninnumerable others in Pontus, Bithynia, and the.\nProvinces of the letter Afta.\nThe Devil having, I fay, finiih d thefe Con-\nquells fo much to his Satisfaction., began to turn\nhis Eyes Northward, and tho he had a confidera-\nble Intereft in the Whore of Babylon, and had\nbrought his Power by the Subjection of the Ro\nman Hierarchy to a great Height, yet finding the\nIntereft of Mahomet moil fuitable to his devilijh\nPurpofes, as moil adapted to the Deftruftion of\nMankind, and laying waile the World, he refolv d\nto efpoufe the growing Power of the Turk, and\nbring him in upon Europe like a Deluge.\nIn order to this, and to make Way for an eafy\nConquefl, like a true Devil he work d under\nGround, and fap d the Foundation of the Chriiii\nan Power, by (owing Difcord among the reigning\nPrinces of Europe 5 that fo envying one another\nthey might be content to (land ftill and look on\nwhile the Turk devoured them one by one, and at\nlail\nmight (wallow them up all.\nThis devilijh Policy took to his Heart s Con\ntent j the Chriiiian Princes ilood ftill, flupid,\ndozing, and unconcern d, till the Turk con\nquered Thrace, over-run Servia, Macedonia, Bui*\ngaria, and all the Remains of the Grecian Empire,\nand a,t lail the Imperial City of Conftantinople it\nfelf.\nFinding this politic Method fo well anfwer his\nEnds, the Devil, who always improves upon the\nSuccefs of his own Experiments, refolv d [from\nthat time to lay a Foundation for the making\nthofe Divifions and Jealouiies of the Chrifti-\nan Princes immortal &amp;gt;\nwhereas they were at\nCL4 firft\n\f232 The Modern HISTORY\nfirft only perfonal, and founded in private Quar\nrels between the Princes refpeftively ; fuch as\nEmulation of one another s Glory, Envy at the\nextraordinary Valour, or other Merit of this or:\nthat Leader, or Revenge of fome little Affront -,\nfor\nwhich notwithstanding, fo great was the Piety of\nChrittian Princes inthofe Days, that they made no\nScruple to facrifice whole Armies, yea, Nations,\nto their Piques and private Quarrels, a certain Sign\nwhofc Management they were under.\nThefe being the Caufes by which the DEVIL\nfirft fow d the Seeds of Mifchief among them,\nand the Succefs fo well anfwering his Defign, he\ncould not but wrfn to have the fame Advantage\nalways ready at his Hand -\ny and therefore he refolv d\nto order it fo, that thefe Divifions, which, how\never ufeful to him, were only perfonal, and con-\nfequently temporary, like an Annual in the Gar\nden, which muft be raised anew every Seafon, might\nfor the future be national, and confequently dura\nble and immortal.\nTo this end it was neceiTary to lay the Foundati\non of eternal Feud, not in the Humours and Paf-\niions of Men only, but in the Interefts of Nations :\nThe Way to do this was to form and {late the Do\nminion of thofe Princes, by fuch a Plan drawn in\nHell, and laid out from a Scheme truly political,\nof which the Devil was chief Engineer $ that\nthe Divifions fhould always remain, being made\na natural Confequence of the Situation of the\nCountry, the Temper of their People, the Na\nture of their Commerce, the Climate, the Man-\nner of living, or fomething which ihould forever\nrender it\nimpoffible for them to unite.\nThis, I lay, was a Scheme truly infernal, in\nwhich the Devil was as certainly the principal Ope\nrator, to illuilrate great Things by fmall, as ever\nwas of the High Dutch Rebellion,or\nSU\n\f.\n235\nSir John B \/ of the late Project, called the\nSouth-Sea Stock. Nor did this Contrivance of\nthe Devil at all difhonour his Author, or the\nSuccefs appear unworthy of the Undertaker 3 for\nwe fee it not only anfwer the End, and made the\nfurk victorious at the fame Time, and formidable\nto Europe ever after, but it works to this Day,\nthe Foundation of the Divifions remains in all\nthe feveral Nations, and that to fuch a Degree\nthat it is\nimpoffible they fhould unite.\nThis is what I hinted before, in which the\nDevil was miftaken, and is another inftance\nthat he knows nothing of what s is to come* for\nthis very Foundation of immortal Jealoufy and\nDifcord between the feveral Nations of Spain,\nFrance, Germany, and others, which the Devil\nhimfelf with fo much Policy contriv d, and which\nferv d his Interefts fo long, is now the only Ob-\nflruction to his Defigns, and prevents the entire\nRuin of the Reformation ; for tho the reform d\nCountries are very Powerful, and fome of them,\nas Great Britain and Pruffia is\nparticularly, more\npowerful than ever $ yet it cannot be faid that the\nProteftant Interefts in general are flronger than\nformerly, or fo ftrong as they were in 162,3.\nunder the victorious Arms of the Swede ; On\nthe other Hand, were it\npofTible that the Popifh\nPowers, to wit, of France, Spain, Germany, Ita\nly and Poland, which are intirely Popilh, could\nheartily unite their Interefts, and fhould join their\nPowers to attack the Proteftants, the latter would\nfind it\nvery difficult, if not impofTible,\nto de\nfend themfelves.\nBut as fatal as fuch a Union of the Popifh\nPowers would be, and as ufeful as it would be to\nthe Devil s Caufe at this time, not the Devil with\nall his Angels are able to bring it to pafs&amp;gt; no,\nwith all his Craft and Cunning j he divided\nthem.\n\f234 The Modern HISTORY\nthem, but he can t unite them 3 fo that evenjuft\nas tis with Men, fo tis with Devils, they may\ndo in an Hour what they can t undo in an Age.\nThis may comfort thofe faint-hearted Chniti-\nans among us, who cry out of the Danger of a\nreligious War in Europe, and what terrible\nThings\nwill happen when France, and Spain, and Ger\nmany, and Italy, and Poland fhall all unite 3 let this\nAnfwer fatisfy them, The Devil himfelf can ne\nver make France and Spain, or France and the\nEmperor unite 3 jarring Humours may be recon-\ncil d, but jarring Interefts never can :\nThey may\nunite fo as to make Peace, tbo* that can hardly\nbe long, but never fo as to make Conquefis toge\nther 3 they are too much afraid of one another,\nfor one to bear, that anyAddition ofStrength fhould\ncome to the other. But this is a Digreffion. We\nihall find the Devil miftaken and difapointed too\non feveral other Occafions, as we go along.\nI return to Satan s Intereft in the feveral Go\nvernments and Nations, by verttie of his Invifi-\nbility, and which he carries on by Pofleffion 3 tis\nby this\nInvifibility that he prefides in all the\nCouncils of foreign Powers, (for we never mean\nour own, that we always premife 3) and what tho\nit is\nalledged by the Criticks, that he does not\nprefide, becaufe there is\nalways a Prefident 3 I\nlay, if he is not in the Prefident s\nChair, yet if\nhe be in the Prefident himfelf, the Difference is\nnot much 3 and if he does not vote as a Coun-\nfellor, if he votes in the Counfellor, tis much\nthe fame 3 and here, as it was in the Story of\nJtbab the King of Ifrael, as he was a lying Spirit\nin the Mouths of all his\nProphets-\ny fo we find\nhim a Spirit of fome particular evil Quality or\nother, in all the Tranfa&ions and Tranfadors on\nthat Stage of Life we call the State.\nThus\n\ftftke DEVIL. 235\nThus he was a diflembling Spirit in Char.

But that Part I have much more to fay to\nin its Place.\nFrom Degrees of Perfons, to Profeffions and\nEmployments, tis the fame 3 we find the Devil\nis a true Poflure-mafter, he aflumes any Drefs,\nappears in any Shape, counterfeits every Voice,\nacts upon every Stage 3 here he wears a Gown,\nthere a long Robe 3 here he wears the Jack- Boots,\nthere the Small- Sword 3 is here an Enthujiaft^\nthere a Buffoon 3 on this Side he acts the Mounte-\nlank^ on that Side the Merry-Andrew 3 nothing\ncomes amifs to him, from the Great Mogul^ to\nthe Scaramouch 3 the Devil is in them, more or\nlefs, and plays his Game fo well that he makes\nfure Work with em all : He knows where the\nCommon Foibkt lies, which is UNIVERSAL PAS\nSION,\n\fSIGN, what Handle to take hold of every Man\nby, and how to cultivate his Intereft fo, as not\nto fail of his End, or miHake the Means.\nHow then can it be deny d but that his acting\nthus in tenebris^ and keeping out of the fight of\nthe World, is\nabundantly his Intereft, and that\nhe could do nothing, comparatively (peaking, by\nany other Method ?\nWhat would this publick Appearance have fig-\nnified ? Who would have entertain d him in his\nown proper Shape and Perfon ? Even B B\nhimfelf, tho all the World knows him to have\na foolifh Devil m him, would not have been Fool\nenough to have taken him into his Service, if he\nhad known him : And my Lord Simpleton alfo,\nwho Satan has fet\nup for a cunning Fool, feems\nto have it fit much better upon him now he\npafTes for a Fool of Art, than it ihould have done\nif the naked DEVIL had come and challenged\nhim for a Fool in Nature.\nInfinite Variety illuftrate the Devil s Reign\namong the Sons of Men &amp;gt;\nall which he manages\nwith admirable Dexterity, and a Slight particular\nto himfelf, by the mere Advantage of his preient\nconceaFd Situation, and which, had he been ob\nliged to have appeared in Publick, had been all\nloft, and he capable of juft nothing at all, or at\nleaft of nothing more than the other ordinary Po\nliticians of Wickednefs could have done without\nhim.\nNow, Authors are much divided as to the man\nner how the Devil manages his proper Inftru-\nments for Mifchief j for Satan has a great many\nAgents in the Dark, who neither have the DEVIL\nin them, nor are they much acquainted with him,\nand yet he ferves himfelf of them, whether of\ntheir Folly, or of that other Frailty call d Wit,\ntis all one, he makes them do his Work, when\nthey\n\f23$ The Modern HISTORY\nthey think they are doing their own j nay, fo\ncunning is he in his guiding the weak Part of\nthe World, that even when they think they are\nferving God, they are doing nothing lefs or more\nthan ferving the Devil; nay, tis fome of the\nniceft Part of his Operation, to make them be\nlieve they are ferving God, when they do his\nWork. Thus thofe who the Scripture foretold\nShould perfecute ChriuVs Church in the latter\nDays, were to think they do God good Service :\nThus the Inquifition, (for Example,) it\nmay be,\nat this time, in all the ah of Chriftian Cruelty\nwhich they are fo famous for (if any of them are\nignorant enough not to know that they are De*\nvils incarnate) they may, for ought we know, go\non for God s fake 5 torture, murther, ftai;ve to\nDeath, mangle and macerate, and all for God,\nand God s Catholic Church &amp;gt;\nand tis\ncertainly\nthe Devil s\nMatter-piece to bring Mankind to\nfuch a Perfection of Devilifm as that of the \/-\nquijition is &amp;gt;\nfor \/\/ the Devil bad not been in them^\ncould they chriften fuch a Hell-fire Judicature as\nthe Inquifition is, by the Name of the Holy Of\nfice ?

That two Pigeons flew out of\nThebes (N. E. it was the Egyptian Thebes) from\nthe Temple of Belus^ ere&ed there by the an-\ntient Sacrilts, and that one of thefe fled Eail-\nward into Lybia^ and the Defarts of Africk^ and\nthe other into Greece^ namely, to Dordona, and\nthefe communicated the divine Myfteries to one\nanother, and afterwards gave myitical Solutions\nto the devout Enquirers j firil the Dordonian Pi-\nfson\nperching upon an Oak fpoke audibly to the\neople there, that the Gods commanded them\nto build an Oracle, or Temple, to Jupiter^ in\nthat Place &amp;gt;\nwhich was accordingly done : The\nother Pigeon did the like on the Hill in Africa^\nwhere it commanded them to build another to\nJupiter Ammon^ or Hammon.\nWife Cicero contemned all this, and, as Authors\ntell us, ridiculed the Anfwer, which, as I have\nhinted above, the Oracle gave to Crcefus^ prov\ning that the Oracle it felf was a Liar, that it\ncould not come from Apollo^ for that Apollo ne\nver fpoke Latin: In a Word, Cicero reje&ed them\nall, and Demofthenes alfo mentions the Cheats of\nthe Oracles j when fpeaking of the Oracle of A-\nj\nhe faid, Pithin Philippiz d; that is,\nthat\nwhen\n\f250 The Modern HISTORY\n\\vhen the Priefts were brib d with Money, they\nalways gave their Anfwers in favour of Philip of\nMacedon.\nBut that which is moft ftrange to me is, that\nin this Difpute about the Reality of Oracles, the\nHeathen who made ufe of them are the People\nwho expofe them, and who infift moil pofitively\nupon their being Cheats and Impoftors, as in par\nticular thofe mentioned above -,\nwhile the Chri-\ntians who reje6t them, yet believe they did re\nally foretel\nThings, anfwer Queftions, &c. on\nly with this Difference, that the Heathen Authors\nwho oppofe them, infill that tis all Delufion and\nCheat, and charge it\nupon the Priefts ; and the\nChriitian Oppofers infift that it was real, but that\nthe Devi^ not the Gods, gave the Anfwers &amp;gt;\nand\nthat he was permitted to do it\nby a fuperiorPow*\n*,\nto magnify that Power in the total filcncing\nthem at laft.\nBut, as I (aid before, I am with the Heathen\nhere, againft the Chriftian Writers, for I take it\nall to be a Cheat and Delufion : I mud give my\nReafon for it, or I do nothing; my Reafon is\nthis, I infifl Satan is as blind in Matters of Fu\nturity, as we are, and can tell nothing of what is\nto come 5 thefe Oracles often pretending to pre-\ndi6r, could be nothing elfe therefore but a Cheat\nfbrm d by the Money-getting Priefts to amufe\nthe World, and bring Grift to their Mill : If I\nmeet with any thing in my Way to open my Eyes\nto a better Opinion of them, I {hall tell it\nyou as\nI go on.\nOn the other hand, whether the Devil really\nfpake in thofe Oracles, or fet the cunning Priefts\nto fpeak for him &amp;gt;\nwhether they predicted, or\nonly made the People believe they predicted;\nwhether they gave Anfwers which came to pafs,\nor prevailed upon the People to believe that\nwhat\n\fof the DEVIL; 251\nwas faid did come to pafs, it was much at\none, and fully anfwer d the Devil s End $ namely,\nto amufe and delude the World ; and as to do,\nor to caufe to be done, is the fame Part of Speech,\nfo whoever did it, the Devil s Intereft was carried\non by it, his Government preferv d, and all the\nMifchief he could defire was effectually brought\nto pafs, fo that every way they were the Devil s\nOracles, that s out of the Queftion.\nIndeed I have wonder d iometimes why, fince\nby this Sorcery the Devil performed fuch Won\nders, that is, play d fo many Tricks in the World,\nand had fuch univerfal Succefs, he fhould fet\nup\nno more of them j but there might be a great ma\nny Reafons given for that, too long to tire\nyou\nwith at prefent : &quot;Tis\ntrue, there were not many\nof them, and yet confidering what a great deal of\nBufinefs they difpatch d, it was enough, for fix\nor eight Oracles were more than fufficient to a-\nmufe all the World : The chief Oracles we meet\nwith in Hiftory are among the Greeks and the JR0-\nynanS) viz.\nThat of Jupiter Ammon, in Lylia^ as above.\nThe Dordonian^ in Epirus.\nApollo Delphicus, in the Country of Phocis\nin Greece.\nApollo ClavtuS) in Afia Minor.\nSerapis, in Alexandria in Egypt,\ntfrophomisi in Bteotia.\nSybitta Cumaea^ in Italy.\nDiana^ at Ephefus.\nApollo Daphneus^ at Antioch.\nBefides many of lefler Note, in feveral other\nPlaces, as I have hinted before.\nI have nothing to do here with the Story, men\ntioned by Plutarch, of a Voice being\nheard at\n\f252 The Modern HISTORY\nSea, fromfome of the Iflands calPd\nand calling upon one Thamuz^ an Egyytian^ who\nwas on board a Ship, bidding him, when he came\nto the Pakde^ other Jflands in the Ionian Seas,\ntell them there that the great God PAN was dead 5\nand when Thamuz perform d it, great Groanings,\nand Howlings, and Lamentation were heard from\nthe Shore.\nThis Tale tells but indifferently, tho indeed\nit looks more like a Chriftian Fable^\nthan a Pa\ngan 5 becaufe it feems as if made to honour the\nChriftian Worfhip, and blaft all the Pagan Ido\nlatry ; and for that Reafon I reje6t it, the Chri\nftian Profeflion needing no fuch fabulous Stuff to\nconfirm it.\nNor is it true in fat, tnat tne Oracles did\nceafe immediately upon the Death of Chrift^\nbut, as I noted before, the Sum of the Matter\nis this 5 the Chriftian Religion fpreading it felf\nuniverfally, as well as miraculouily, and that too\nby the Foolijhnefs of Preaching^ into all Parts of\nthe World, the Oracles ceas d 5 that is to fay,\ntheir Trade ceas d, their Rogueries were daily\ndetected, the deluded People being better taught,\ncame no more after them, and being afham d, as\nveil as difcourag d, they fneak d out of the\nWorld as well as they could j in ihort the Cu-\nftomers fell off, and the Priefts, who were the\nShopkeepers, having no Buflnefs to do, fhut up\ntheir Shops, broke, and went away j the Trade\nand the Tradefmen were hifs d off the Stage toge\nther j\nfo that theZ)^\/, who, it mult be confefs d,\ngot infinitely by the Cheat, became bankrupt,\nand was oblig d to fet other Engines at work, as\nother Cheats and Deceivers do, who when one\nTrick grows ftale, and will ferve no longer, arc\nfqrc d to try another.\nNor\n\fof the D EVIL: 253\nNor was the Devil to feek in new Meafures j\nfor tho he could not give out his delufive Trail*\nas he did before, in Pomp and State, with the\nSolemnity of a Temple and a Set of Enthufiafts\ncall d Priefls, who plaid a thoufand Tricks to\namufe the World, he then had Recourfe to his\nold Egyptian Method, which indeed was more\nantient than that of Oracles j and that was by Ma\ngic, Sorcery, Familiars, Witchcraft, and the like.\nOf this we find the people of the South, that\nis, of Arabia, and Chaldea were the firft, from\nwhence we are told of the Wife Men, that is to\nfay, Magicians, were call d Chaldeans and South*\nfayers. Hence alfo we find Ahaziah the King of\nJfrael fent to Eaalzebub the God of Ekron, to\nenquire whether he fhould live or die ? This fome\nthink was a kind of an Oracle, tho others think\nit was only fome over-grown Magician, who\ncounterfeited himfelf to be a Devil, and obtain d\nupon that Idol-hunting Age to make a Cunning\nMan of him $ and for that Purpofe he got him\nfelf made a Prieft of Baalzebub, the God of\nEkron, and gave out Anfwers in his Name.\nThus thofe merry Fellows in Egypt, Jannes and\nJambres, are faid to mimick Mofes and Aaron,\nwhen they work d the miraculous Plagues upon\nthe Egyptians ; and we have fome Inftances in\nScripture that fupport this, fuch as the Witch of\nEndor, the King ManaJJes, who dealt with the\nDevil openly, and had a Familiar ; the Woman\nmentioned dfts xvi. who had a Spirit of Divi-\nnation^ and who got Money by playing the Ora\ncle 5 that is, anfwering doubtful Queftions, &c.\nwhich Spirit, or Devil, the Apoftles caft out.\nNow tho it is true that the old Women in the\nWorld have filPd us with Tales, fome improba\nble, others impoffible ; fome weak, fome ridicu\nlous, and that this puts a general Discredit upon all\nthe\n\f154 The Modern M I S f O R Y\nthe graver Macrons, who entertain us with StcM\nries better put together , yet tis certain, and I\nmuft be allow d to affirm, that the Devil does\nnot difdain to take into his Service many Troops\nof good Old JVomen^ and Old Women-Men too5\nwho he finds tis for his Service to keep in conftant\nPay &amp;gt;\nto thefe he is found frequently to com\nmunicate his Mind, and oftentimes we find them\nfuch Proficients, that they know much more than\nthe Devil can teach them.\nHow far our antient Friend Merlin^ or the\nfrave\nMatron his (Satan s) moil trufty and weli-\neloved Coufin and Counfellor, Mother Shipton^\nwere commiffioned by him to give one their pro\nphetic Oracles, and what degree of Pofleflion he\nmay have arrived to in them upon their Midnight\nExcurfions, I will not undertake to prove ;. but\nthat he might be acquainted with them both, as\nwell as with feveral of our modern Gentlemen, I\nwill not deny neither.\nI confefs it is not very incongruous with the\nDevil s\nTemper, or with the Nature of his\nBufinefs, to fhift hands &amp;gt;\npoflibly he found that\nhe had tried the World with Oracular Cheats &amp;gt;\nthat Men began to, be forfeited with them, and\ngrew fick of the Frauds which were fo fre\nquently detefted $ that it was time to take new\nMeafures, and contrive fome new Trick to Bite\nthe World, that he might not be expos d to Con\ntempt &amp;gt;\nor perhaps he fa\\v the Approach of new\nLight, which the Chriilian Do&rine bringing\nwith it\nbegan to fpread in the Minds of Men j\nthat it would out-fhine the dim burning ignis\nfatuuS) with which he had fo long cheated Man\nkind, and was afraid to ftand it, left he fhould\nbe mobb d oft the Stage by his own People, when\ntheir Eyes fhould begin to open : That upon this\nfoot he might in Policy withdraw from tbofe old\ni Retreats\n\fof the DEVIL: 255\nRetreats the Oracles, and reftrain thofe Refponfes\nbefore they loft all their Credit ; for we find the\nPeople (eem d to be at a mighty Lofs for fome\ntime, for want of them, fo that it made them\nrun up and down to Conjurers, and Man-Gojfips^\nto brazen Heads, fpeaking Calves, and innume\nrable fimple Th ngs, fo grofs that they are fcarce\nfit to be named, to fktisfy the Itch of having their\nFortunes told them, as we call it.\nNow as the DEVIL is\nvery feldom blind to his\nown Intereft, and therefore thought fit to quit\nhis old way of impofing upon the World by his\nOracles, only\nbecaufe he found the World began\nto be too wife to be impofed upon that way 5 fo\non the other hand, finding there was 11 ill a Pof-\nfibilicy\nto delude the World, tho by other In-\nftruments, he no fooner laid down his Oracles,\nand the folemn Pageantry, magnificent Appear\nances, and other Frauds of his Priefts and Vota\nries, in their Temples and Shrines 5 but he fet up\na new Trade, and having, as I have faid, Agents\nand Inftruments fufficient for any Bufinefs that he\ncould have to employ them in, he begins in Cor\nners, as the learned and merry Dr. Brown fays,\nand exercifes his minor Trumperies by way of\nhis own contriving, lifting\na great Number of\nnew-found Operators, fuch as Witches, Magi\ncians, Diviners, Figure-caftcrs, Aflrologers, and\nfuch inferior Seducers.\nNow it is\ntrue, as that Doctor fays,\nthis was\nrunning into Corners, as if he had been expell d\nhis more triumphant way of giving Audience in\nForm, which for fo\nmany Ages had been allow d\nhim &amp;gt;\nyet I muft add, that as it feem d to be the\nDEVIL S own doing, from a right Judgment of\nhis Affairs, which had taken a new Turn in the\nWorld, upon the ihining of new Lights from\nthe Chriftian Doctrine, fo it muft be acknow\nledged\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\n*edged the Devil made himfelf amends upon Man\nkind, by the various Methods he took, and the\nMultitude of Inftruments he employ d^ and per\nhaps deluded Mankind in a more fatal and fenfi-\nble manner than he did before, tho not fo uni-\nverfally.\nHe had indeed before more Pomp and Figure\nput upon it, and he cheated Mankind then in a\nWay of Magnifience and Splendor 5 but this\nwas not in above eight or ten principal Places, and\nnot fifty Places in all, public or private j whereas\nnow fifty thoufand of his Angels and Inilruments,\nvifible and invifible, hardly may be faid to fuffice\nfor one Town or City j but in ihort, as his invi\nfible Agents fill the Air, and are at hand for Mif-\nchief on every Emergence, fo his vifible Fools\niwartn in every Village, and you have fcarce a\nHamlet or a Town but his EmifTaries are at Hand\nfor Bufinefs &amp;gt;\nand which is flill worfe, in all Pla\nces he finds Bufinefs, nay even where Religion is\nplanted and feems to flouriflij yet he keeps his\nGround and pufhes his Intereft according to what\nhas been faid elfewhere] upon the fame Subject,\nthat wherever Religion plants, the Devil plants\nclofe by it.\nNor, as I fay, does he fail of Succefs, Delufion\nfpreads like a Plague, and the Devil is fure of Vo\ntaries y like a true Mountebank, he can always\nbring a Croud about his Stage, and that fome\nTimes falter than other People.\nWhat I obferve upon this Subject is this, that\nthe World is at a ftrange Lofs for want of the\nDevil ; if it was not fo, what s the Reafbn, that\nupon the filencing the Oracles, and Religion tell\ning them that Miracles are ceas d, and that God\nhas done fpeaking by Prophets, they never enquire\nwhether Heaven has eftablinYd any other or new\nWay of Revelation, but away they ran with\ntheir\n\fof the DEVIL. 257\ntheir Doubts and Difficulties to thefe Dreamers\nof Dreams, Tellers of Fortunes, and perfonal\nOracles to be refolv d 5 as if when they acknow\nledge the Devil is dumb, thefe could fpeak $ and\nas if the wicked Spirit could do more than the\nGood, the Diabolical more than the Divine^ or\nthat Heaven having taken away the DEVI L S\nVoice, had furnifh d him with an Equivalent, by\nallowing Scolds, Termagants, and old weak and\nfuperannuated Wretches to fpeak for him j for\nthefe are the People we go to now in our Doubts\nand Emergencies.\nWhile this Blindnefs continues among us, tis\nNonfenfe to fay that Oracles are filenced, or the\nDevil is\ndumb, for the Devil gives Audience It-ill\nby his Deputies 5 only as Jeroboam made Priefls\nof the meaner! of the People, fo he is\ngrown a\nlittle humble, and makes life of meaner Inftru-\nments than he did before j for whereas the Priefts\nof Apollo, and of Jupiter^ were fplendid in their\nAppearance, of grave and venerable Afpec~b, and\nfometimes of no mean Quality 5 now he makes\nufe of Scoundrels and Rabble, Beggars and Va\ngabonds, old Hags, fuperannuated miferable Her\nmits, Gypfies and -Strollers, the Pictures of Envy\nand ill Luck.\nEither the Devil is\ngrown an ill Matter, and\ngives but mean Wages, that he can get no better\nServants 5 or elfe Common Senfe is\ngrown very\nlow prized and contemptible 5 that fuch as thefe\nare fit Tools to continue the SuccefHon of Fraud,\nand carry on the Devifs Inter-eft in the World &amp;gt;\nfor were not the Paffions and Temper of Man\nkind deeply pre-engaged in favour of this dark\nPrince, we could never fuffer our felves to accept\nof his Favours by the Hands of fuch contempt!-*\nble Agents as thefe !

whence it is\nbecome proverbial, when our Looks are very dif-\nmal and frightful,\nto fay, I look like a Witch, or\nin other Cafes to fay, as ugly as a Witch 5 in ano\nther Cafe to look as envious as a Witch j now\nwhether there is\nany Thing particularly requir d\nin the Looks of the DEVIL S modern Agents,\nwhich is\naffirting in\ntheDifcharge of their Offices,\nand which make their Anfwers appear more fo-\nlemn, this the Devil has not yet reveaPd, at leaft\nnot to me &amp;gt;\nand therefore why it is that he fingles\nout fuch Creatures as are fit\nonly to fright the\nPeople that come to them with their Enquiries,\nI do not take upon me to determine.\nPerhaps it is\nnecefTary they fhould be thus ex\ntraordinary in their Afpect, that they might ftrike\nan Awe into the Minds of their Votaries, as if\nthey were Satan s true and real Reprefentatives j\nand that the faid Votaries may think when they\nfpeak to the Witches they are really talking\nto the Devil , or perhaps tis\nneceflary to the\nWitches themfelves, that they fhould be fo ex-\nquifitely ugly, that they might not be fiu priz d\nat whatever Figure the Devil makes when he firft\nappears to them, being certain they can fee no\nthing uglier than themfelves.\nSome are of the Opinion that the Communica\ntion with the Devil, or between the Devil and\nthofe Creatures his Agents, has fomething af-\nfimulating in it, and that if they were tolerable\nbefore, they are, ipfo fattoy turn d into DEVILS\nby talking with him &amp;gt;\nI will not fey but that a\nS j Tremor\n\f262 The Modern HISTORY\nTremor in the Limbs, a Horror in the AfpecT:, and\na furpnzing Stare in the Eyes may feize. upon\nibme of them when they really fee the DEVIL,\nand that the frequent Repetition may make thofe\nDiitortions, which we io conftantly fee in their\nFaces becomes natural to them j by which if it\ndoes not continue always upon the Countenance,\nthey can at lead, like the Pofture-Mafters^ can:\nthemfelvcs into fuch Figures and frightful Dif-\nlocations of the Lines and Features in their Faces,\nand fo afiiime a Devil s Face fui table to the Occa-\nfion, or as may fervc the t urn for which they take\nit up, and as often as they have any ufe for it.\nBut be it which of thefe the Enquirer pieafcs,\ntis all one to the Cafe in Hand &amp;gt;\nthis is certain,\nthat fuch deform d Devil-like Creatures, moil of\nthofe we call Hags and Witches^ are in their Shapes\nand Afpecfo, and that they give out their Senten\nces and frightful Meflages with an Air of Re\nvenge for fome Injury received &amp;gt;\nfor Witches are\nfam d chiefly for doing Mifchief.\nIt feems the Devil has always pick d out the\nmofl ugly and frightful old Women to do his\nBufinefs 3 Mother Shifton^ our famous Euglifa\nWitch or Prophetels, is\nvery much wrong d in\nher Picture, if fhc was not of the moil terrible\nAfpecl: imaginable ; and if it be true that Merlin^\nthe famous Welch Fortune-Teller, was a fright\nful Figure, it will feem the more rational to be\nlieve, if we credit another Story, (viz.) that he\nwas begotten by the Devil himfelf, of which I\nfhall fpeak by it felf : But to go back to the De\nvil s Inftruments being fo uglyj it\nmay be ob-\nferved, I fay, that the Devil has always dealt in\nfuch fort of Cattle ;

VI.\nOf the extraordinary Appearance of the\nDevil, and particularly of the Cloven-\nFoot.\nSOme\nPeople would fain have us treat this\nTale of the DeviFs appearing with a Cloven-\nFoot with more Solemnity than I believe the\nDevil himfelf does 5 for Satan, who knows how\nmuch of a Cheat it is, mull certainly ridicule it,\nin his own Thoughts, to the laft\nDegree 5 but as\nhe is glad of any Way to hoodwink the Under-\nftandings, and bubble the weak Part of the World j\nfo if he fees Men willing to take every Scarecrow\nfor a Devil, it is not his Bufinefs to undeceive\nthem j on the other Hand, he finds it his In-\nterefl to fofter the Cheat, and ferve himfelf of\nthe Confequence : Nor could I doubt but the De\nvil, if any Mirth be allow d him, often laughs at\nthe many frightful Shapes and Figures we drefs\nhim up in, and efpecially to fee how willing we\nare firfl to paint him as black, and make him ap\npear as ugly as we can, and then flare and flart at\nthe Spectrum of our own making.\nThe Truth is, that among all the Horribles\nthat we drefs up Satan in, I cannot but think\nwe fhew the lead of Invention in this of a\nGoat, or a Thing with a Goat s Foot, of all the\nreft} for tho a Goat is a Creature made life of by\nour Saviour in the Allegory of the Day of Judg\nment, and is faid there to reprefent the wicked\nreje&ed Party, yet it feems to be only on Account\nof their Similitude to the Sheep, and fo to repre\nfent the juft Fate of Hypocrily and Hypocrites,\nand in particular to form the neceflary Antithc-\nfis\n\f266 The Modern HISTORY\nfis in the Story j for elfe, our whimjical Fancies ex-\ncepted, a Sheep or a Lamb has a Cloven-Foot as\nwell as a Goat ; nay, if the Scripture be of any\nValue in the Cafe, tis to the Devil s\nAdvantage,\nfor the dividing the Hoof was the\ndiftinguifhing\nCharacter or Mark of a clean Beaft, and how the\nDevil can be brought into that Number is\npretty\nhard to fay.\nOne would have thought if we had intended\nto have given a juft Figure of the Devil, it would\nhave been more appofite to have rank d him a-\nmong the Cat-kind, and given him a Foot (if he\nis to be known by his Foot) like a Lion, or like a\nred Dragon, being the fame Creatures which he is\nreprefented by in the Text, and fo his Claws would\nhave had fome Terror in them as well as his\nTeeth.\nBut neither is the Goat a true Reprefentative\nof the Devil at all, for we do not rank the Goats\namong the fubtle or cunning Part of the Brutes ;\nhe is counted a fierce Creature indeed of his Kind,\ntho nothing likethofe otherabovemention d 5 and\nhe is emblematically ufed to reprefent a luftful\nTemper, but even that Part does not fully ferve\nto defcribe the Devil, whofe Operation lies\nprin\ncipally another Way.\nBefides it is not the Goat himfelf that is made\nufe of, tis the Cloven-Hoof only, and that fo\nparticularly, that the Cloven Foot of a Ram or a\nSwine, or any other Creature, may ferve as well\nas that of a Goat, only that Hiltory gives us fome\nCaufe to call it the Goat s Foot.\nIn the next Place tis understood by us not as\na bare Token to know Satan by, but as if it were\na Brand upon him, and that like the Mark God\nput upon Cain,it was given him fora Punifhment,\nfo that he cannot get leave to appear without it,\nnay cannot conceal it whatever other Drefs or\nDifc\n\fof the DEVIL; 267\nDifguife he may put on ; and as if it was to make\nhim as ridiculous as poffible, they will have it be,\nthat whenever Satan has Occafion to drefs him-\nfelf in any humane Shape, be it of what Degree\nfoever, from the King to the Beggar, be it of a\nfine Lady or ofan oldlVoman^ (the Latter it feems\nhe oftencft arTumes) yet ftill he not only muft have\nthis Cloven-Foot about him, but he is\noblig d to\n{hew it too j nay, they will not allow him any\nDrefs, whether it be a Prince s Robes, a Lord\nCha--- r s Gown, or a Lady s\nHoop and long\nPetticoats, but the Cloven-Foot mufl be fhew d\nfrom under them &amp;gt;\nthey will not fo much as allow\nhim an artificial Shoe or a Jack-Boot^ as we often\nfee contriv d to conceal a Club-Foot or a ff^ooden-\nLeg-y but that the Devil may be known where-\never he goes, he is bound to ihew his Foot 5 they\nmight as well oblige him to fet a Bill upon his\nCap, as Folks do upon a Houfe to be let, and have\nit written in capital Letters, I am the DEVIL.\nIt muft be confefs d this is\nvery particular, and\nwould be very hard upon the Devil^ if it had not\nanother Article in it, which is fome Advantage\nto him, and that is, that the Fatt is not true; but\nthe Belief of this is fo univerfal, that all the World\nruns away with it ; by which Mittake the good\nPeople mifs the Devil many times where they\nlook for him, and meet him as often where they\ndid not expect him, and when for want of this\nCloven-Foot they do not know him.\nUpon this very Account I have fometimes\nthought, not that this has been put upon him by\nmeer Fancy, and the Cheat of a heavy Imagination,\npropagated by Fable and Chymny-Corner Divi\nnity, but that it has been a Contrivance of his\nown 3 and that, in fhort, the Devil rais d this\nScandal upon himfelf, that he might keep his Dif\nguife the better, and might go a.\nVifiting among\nhis\n\fThe ModernHlS TORY\nhis Friends without being known ; for were it\nreally fo, that he could go no where without\nthis particular Brand of Infamy, he could not\ncome into Company, could not dine with my\nLord Mayor, nor drink Tea with the Ladies, could\nnot go to the Drawing-R at ,\ncould\nnot have gone to Fountamblean to the King of\nFrance s\nWedding, or to the Diet of Poland^ to\nprevent the Grandees there coming to an Agree\nment j nay, which would be ftill\nworfe than all^ he\ncould not go to the Mafquerade, nor to any of\nour Balls &amp;gt;\nthe Reafon is\nplain, he would be al\nways difcover d, expos d and forc d to leave the\ngood Company, or which would be as bad, the\nCompany would all\ncry out the Devil and run\nout of the Room as if they were frighted &amp;gt;\nnor\ncould all the Help of Invention do him any Ser\nvice, no Drefs he could put on would cover him ;\nnot all our Friends at T&viftock Corner could fur-\nniih him with a Habit that would difguile or con\nceal him, this unhappy Foot would fpoil it all :\nNow this would be ib great a Lois to him, that\nI queltion whether he could carry on any of his\nmoll important Affairs in the World without it 5\nfor tho he has accefs to Mankind in his compleat\nDifguife, I mean that of his Inviiibility, yet the\nLearned very much agree in this, that his corpo-\njal Pretence in the World is\nabsolutely neceflary\nupon many Occafions, to fupport his Intercft and\nkeep up his Correfpondences, and particularly to\nencourage his Friends when Numbers are requi-\nlite to carry on his Affairs $ but this Part I mall\nhave Occafion to fpeak of again, when I come to\nconfider him as a Gentleman of Bufinefs in his\nLocality, and under the Head of vifible Appa*\nrition ; but I return to the Foot.\nAs I have thus fuggefted that the Devil him-\nfelf has politically fpread about this Notion corv*\nz cerning\n\fef the DEVIL: ;\n2&amp;lt;s$&amp;gt;\nearning his\nappearing with a Cloven-Foot, fo I\ndoubt not that he has thought it for hisPurpofe to\npaint this Cloven-Foot fo lively in the Imaginations\nof many of our People, and efpccially of thofe clear\nlighted Folks who fee the Devil when he is not to\nbe feen, that they would make no Scruple to fay, nay\nand to make Affidavit too, even before Satan him-\nfelf, whenever he fat upon the Bench, that they\nhad feen his\nWorfhip s FOOT at fuch and fuch a\nTime-, this I advance the rather becaufe tis\nvery\nmuch for his Intereft to do this, for if we had not\nmany WitnefTes, viva voce^ to teftify it, we fhould\nhave had fome obftinate Fellows always among\nus, who would have denied the Fac~b, or at leait\nhave fpoken doubtfully of it, and fo have rais d\nDifputes and Objections againft it, as impoffible,\nor at leaft as\nimprobable 5 buzzing one ridiculous\nNotion or other into our Ears, as if the Devil\nwas not fo black as he was painted, that he had\nno more a Cloven- Foot than a Pope, v\/hofe Apo-\nilolical Toes have fo often been reverentially kifs d\nby Kings and Emperors : but now alas this Part is\nout of the Queftion, not the Man in the Moon,\nnot the Groaning-Board, not the fpeaking of\nFryar Bacon s Brazen-Head, not the Infpiration\nof Mother Shipton, or the Miracles of Dr. Fau-\nJluS) Things as certain as Death and Taxes, cafi\nbe more firmly believ d : The Devil not have\na Cloven-Foot! I doubt not but I could, in a\nihort Time, bring you a thoufand old Women\ntogether, that would as foon believe there was no\nDevil at all 5 nay, they will tell\nyou, he could not\nbe a Devil without it, any more than he could\ncome into the Room, and the Candles not burn\nblue, or go out and not leave a fmell of Brimftone\nbehind him.\nSince then the Certainty of the Thing is fb\nwell eftabliih d, and there are fo many good and\nfubftan-\n\f270 The Modern HISTORY\nfubftantial WitnefTes ready to teflify that he has\na Cloven-Foot, and that they have feen it too 3\nnay, and that we have Antiquity on our Side, for\n\\ve have this Truth confirm d by the Teftimony\nof many Ages 3 why fhould we doubt it\nany lon\nger ? we can prove that many of our Anceflors\nhave been of this Opinion, and divers learn d Au\nthors have left it\nupon Record, as particularly\nthat learned Familiarift Mother Hazel^ whole\nWritings are to be found in MS. in the famous Li\nbrary at Pye-Corner 3 alfo the admir d Joan of^mes-\nbury, the Hiftory of the Lancajhire Witches,\nand the Reverend Exorciil of the Devil s of Lon-\ndon^ whole Hiftory is extant among us to this\nDay 3 all thefe and many more may be quoted, and\ntheir Writings referred to for the Confirmation\nof the Antiquity of this Truth 3 but there feems\nto be no Occafion for farther Evidence, tis e-\nnough, Satan himfelf, if he did not raife the Re\nport, yet tacitly owns the Fact, at leaft he ap\npears willing to have it believ d, and be receiv d\nas a general Truth for the Reafons above.\nBut beiides all this, and as much a Jeil as fome\nunbelieving People would have this Story pals\nfor, who knows but that if Satan is\nempower d\nto afiume any Shape or Body, and to appear to us\nviiibly, as if really fo fhap d 3 I fay, who knows\nbut he may, by the fame Authority, be allow d\nto aiiume the Addition of the Cloven-Foot, or\ntwo or four Cloven-Feet, if he pleafed? and why\nnot a Cloven-Foot as well as any other Foot, if he\nthinks fit? For if the Devil can ailume a Shape,\nand can appear to Mankind in a vifible Form, it\nmay, I doubt not, with as good Authority be ad-\nvanc d that he is left at Liberty to aflame what\nShape he pleafes, and to choofc what Cafe of Flejh\nand Blood he ll\npleafe to wear^ whether real or\nimaginary 3 and if this Liberty be allow d him,\nit\n\fof the DEVIL. ;27I\nit is an admirable Difguife for him to come gene\nrally with his Cloven-Foot, that when he finds it\nfor his Purpofe, on fpecial Occafions to come\nwithout it, as I faid above, he may not be iuf-\npecbed 3 but taks tins with you as you go, that all\nthis is\nupon a Suppofition that the Devil can af-\nfume a vifible Shape, and make a real\nAppear\nance, which however I do not yet think fit to\ngrant or deny.\nCertain it is, the fir ft\nPeople who beitow d a\nCloven- Foot upon the Devil, were not fo\ndefpicable\nas you may imagine, but were real Favourites of\nHeaven &amp;gt;\nfor did not Aaron fet up the Devil of a\nCalf in the Congregation, and fet the People a\ndancing about it for a God ?\nUpon which Occa-\nfion, Expofitors tell us, that particular Command\nwas given, Levit. xvii. 7. They Jhall no more offer\ntheir Sacrifices unto Devils, after whom they have;\ngone a Whoring -,\nlikewife King Jeroboam fee\nup\nthe two Calves, one at Dan and the other at Be~\nthe!, and we find them charg d afterwards with\nfetting up the Worfhip of Devils inilead of the\nWorfhip of God.\nAfter this we find fome Nations actually facri-\nficed to the Devil in the Form of a Ram, and\nothers of a Goat &amp;gt;\nfrom which, and that above\nof the Calves at Horeb&amp;gt;\nI doubt not the Story of\nthe Cloven-Foot firft derived &amp;gt;\nand it is\nplain that\nthe Worfhip of that Calf at Horeb is meant in\nthe Scripture quoted above, Levit. xvii. 7. Thou\nJhalt no more offer Sacrifices unto Devils : The Ori\nginal is\nSeghnirim 5 that is, rough and hairy Goats\nor Calves; and fome think alfo in this Shape the\nDevil moft ordinarily appeared to the Egyptians\nand Arabians-) from whence it was derived.\nAlfo in the old Writings of the Egyptians, I\nmean their hieroglyphick Writing, before the\nUfe of Letters was known, we are told this was\nthe\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\nthe Mark that he was known by \\ and the Fi\ngure of a Goat was the Hieroglyphick of the De\nvil j fome will affirm that the Devil was particu\nlarly pleafed to be fo reprefented -&amp;gt;\nhow they came\nby their Information, and whether they had it:\nfrom his own Mouth or not. Authors have not\nyet determined.\nBut be this as it will, I do not fee that Satan\ncould have been at a Lofs for fome extraordinary\nFigure to have banter d Mankind with, tho this\nhad not been thought of -,\nbut thinking of the\nCloven-Foot firft, and the Matter being indifferent,\nthis took place, and eafily rooted it felf in the\nbewildred Fancy of the People, and now tis ri\nveted too fail for the Devil himfelf to remove it\nif he was difpofed to try 5 but as I faid above, tis\nnone of his Bufinefs to folve Doubts or remove\nDifficulties out of our Heads, but to perplex us\nwith more, as much as he can.\nSome People carry this Matter a great deal\nhigher (till, and will have the Cloven-Foot be\nlike the great Stone which the Erafillan Conju\nrers ufed to folve all difficult Questions upon,\nafter having ufed a great many monitrous and bar\nbarous Geitures and Distortions of their Bodies,\nand cut certain Marks or magical Figures upon the\nStone $ fo, Ifay^ they will have this Cloven-Foot\nbe a kind of a Conjuring-Stone, and tell us, that\nin former Times, when Satan drove a greater\nTrade with Mankind in publick, than he has done\nof late, he gave this Cloven- Foot as a Token to\nhis particular Favourites to work Wonders with,\nand to conjure by, and that Witches, Fairies,\nHobgoblins, and fuch Things, of which the\nAntients had fevcral Kinds, at leaft in their Ima\ngination, had all a Goat s Leg with a Cloven-Foot\nto put on upon extraordinary Occafionsj it feems\nthis Method is of late grown out of Pra&ice,\nand\n\foftteDEVI L; 273\nand fo like the melting of Marble and the paint\ning of Glafs, tis laid alide among the various\nufeful Arts which Hiftory tells us are loft to the\nWorld j what may be practifed in the Fairy\nWorld, if fuch a Place there be, we can give no\nparticular Account at prefent.\nBut neither is this all, for other wou d-be-wife\nPeople tike upon them to make farther and\nmore confiderable Improvements upon this Doc\ntrine of the Cloven- Foot)\nand treat it as a moll\nfignificant Inftrument of Satan s\nprivate Opera\ntion, and that as Jofeph is faid to\nDivine^\nthat is\nto fay, to conjure by his Golden Cup which was\nput into Benjamin s Sack, fo the Devil has mana\nged feveral of his fecret Operations, and Pofle-\nlions, and other hellifh Mechanifms upon the Spi\nrits as well as Bodies of Men, by the Medium or\nInftrumentality of the Cloven- Foot ; according\nly it had a Kind of an hellifh Infpiration in it,\nand a feparate and magical Power by which he\nwrought his infernal Miracles j that the Clo\nven-Foot had a fuperior Signification, and was\nnot only emblematic and fignificative of the Con\nduct of Men, but really guided their Conduct in\nthe moil important Affairs of Life j and that the\nAgents the Devil employ d to influence Mankind,\nand to delude them and draw them into all the\nSnares and Traps that he lays continually for their\nDefinition, were equipp d with this Foot in Aid\nof their other Powers for Mifchief.\nHere they read us learn d Lectures upon the\nfovereign Operations which the Devil is at pre\nfent Mailer of, in the Government of human\nAffairs 3 and how the Cloven-Foot is an Emblem\nof the true double Entendre or divided AfpecTr,\nwhich the great Men of the World generally\nact with, and by which all their Affairs are di\nrected -\n} from whence it comes to pafs that there is\nT no\n\f274 The Modern HISTORY\nno fuch Thing as a fingle hearted Integrity, or\nan upright Meaning to be found in the World 5\nthat Mankind, worfe than the ravenous Brutes,\npreys upon his own Kind, and devours them by\nall the .laudable Methods of Flattery, Whyne,\nCheat and Treachery , Crocodile like^ weeping\noverthofe it will devour, deftroying thofe it fmiles\nupon, and, in a Word, devours its own Kind,\nwhich the very Beafts refufe, and that by all the\nWays of Fraud and Allurement that Hell can\ninvent 3 holding out a cloven divided Hoof, or\nHand, pretending to dive, when the very Pre\ntence is made ufe of to enfnare and deftroy.\nThus the divided Hoof is the Representative of\na divided double Tongue, and Heart, an Emblem\nof the moft exquifite Hypocrify, the mod fawn\ning and fatally deceiving Flattery &amp;gt;\nand here they\ngive us very diverting Hiftories, tho tragical in\nthemfelves, of the manner which fome of the\nDevil s\ninfpired Agents have managed themfelves\nunder the efpecial Influence of the Cloven- Foot -,\nhow they have made War under the Pretence of\nPeace, murthefd Garrifons under the moll: lacred\nCapitulations, maflacred innocent Multitudes af\nter Surrenders to Mercy.\nAgain, they tell us the Cloven-Foot has been\nmade ufe of in all Treafons, Plots, AlTaflinations,\nand fecret as well as open Marchers and Rebel\nlions. Thus Joab under the Treafon of an Em\nbrace, fhew d how dexteroufly he could manage\nthe Cloven- Foot ,\nand flruck Abner under the fifth\nRib: Thus David play d the Cloven-Foot upon\npoor Uriah, when he had a Mind to lie with his\nWife: Thus Brutus play d it\nupon Cxfar-y and\nto come nearer home, we have had a great many\nretrograde Motions in this Country by this magi\ncal Implement the Foot &amp;gt;\nfuch as that of the Earl\nof EJJexs Fate, beheading the Queen of Scots^\nand\n\fof the DEVIL. 275\nand diverfe others in Queen Elizabeth s Time : That\nof the Earl ofShrewsbury and Sir Thomas Over-bury^\nGondamor and Sir Walter Raleigh^ and many o-\nthers in King James the I.*s Time 3 in all which,\nif the Cloven-Foot had not been dexterouily ma-\nnag d, thofe Murthers had not been Ib dexterouily\nmanag d, or the Murtherers have fo well been\nskrcen d from Jufticej for which and the impre\ncated Juflice of Heaven unappeafed, fome have\nthought the innocent Branches of the Royal\nHoufe of Stuart did not fare the better in the\nAges which follow d.\nIt mult be confefs d, the Cloven-Foot was in\nits full Exercife in the next Reign, and the Ge\nneration that role up immediately after them, ar\nrived to the molt cxquiiite Skill for Management\nof it 5 here they failed and pray d, there they\nplundered and murther d $ here they rais d War\nfor the King, and there they fought againlt\nhim, cutting Throats for God s Sake, and depof-\ning both King and kingly Government according\nto Law.\nNor was the Cloven-Foot unemployed on all\nSides, for tis the main Excellency of this Inftru-\nment of Hell, that it a6rs on every Side, it is its\ndenominating Quality^ and is for that Reafon\ncali d a cloven or divided Hoof.\nThis mutilated Apparition has been fo publick\nin other Countries too, that it feems to convince\nus the Devil is not confin d to England only,\nbut that as his Empire extended to all the fub-\nlunary World, fo he gives them all Room to\nfee he is qualified to manage them his own\nWay.\nWhat abundant Ufedid that Prince of DiiTem-\nblers, Charles V. make of this Foot ? twas by the\nHelp ofthis Apparition ofthe Foot that he baited his\nHook with the City QtMilan, and tickled Francis I.\nT 2, of\n\f276 Tfo Modern HISTORY\nof France fo well with it, that when he pafs d\nthro France^ and was in that King s Power, he\nlet him go, and never get the Bait off of the\nHook neither &amp;gt;\nit ieems the Foot was not on King\nFrancis s Side at that Time.\nHow cruelly did Philip II. of Spain manage\nthis Foot in the Murther of the Nobility of the\nSpanijb Netherlands^ the Aflaffination of the Prince\nof Orange, and at lad in that of his own Son Don\nCarlos Infant of Spain ? and yet fuch was the\nDevil s Craft, and fo nicely did he beftir his C70-\nven-Hoof, that this Monarch died confolated (tho*\nimpenitent) in the Arms of the Church, and with\nthe Benedi&ion of the Clergy too, thofe fecond\nleft Managers of the faid Hoof in the World.\nI muft\nacknowledge, I\nagree with this Opinion\nthus far j namely, that the Devil acting by this\nCloven-Foot, as a Machine, has done great Things\nin the World for the propagating his dark Em\npire among us 5 and Hiftory is full of Examples,\nbefides the little low priz d Things done among\nus 5 for we are come to fuch a Kind of Degene\nracy in Folly, that we have even difhonour d the\nDevil) and put this glorious Engine the Cloven-\nFoot to fuch mean Ufes, that the Devil himfelf\nfeems to be afham d of us.\nBut to return a little to foreign Hiftory, befides\nwhat has been mention d above, we find flaming\nExamples of moft glorious Mifchief done by this\nWeapon, when put into the Hands of Kings and\nMen of Fame in the World : How many Games\nhave the Kings of France play d with this Cloven-\nFoot, and that within a few Years of one another?\nFirft, Charles IX. play d the Cloven-Foot upon\nGafpar Collgni Admiral of France, when he ca-\nrefs d him, complimented him, invited him to\nParis, to the Wedding of the King of Navarre,\ncall d him Father, kifs d him, and when he was\nwounded\n\fof the DEVIL. 277\nwounded Tent his own Surgeons to take Care of\nhim, and yet three Days after order d him to be\naflliifinated and murther d, ufed with a thouland\nIndignities, and at laft thrown out of the Win\ndow into the Street to be infulted by the Rabble?\nDid not Henry III. in the fame Country, play\nthe Cloven-Foot upon the Duke of Guife^ when\nhe call d him to his Council, and caus d him to\nbe murther d as he went in at the Door? The\nGuifes again plaid the fame Game back upon the\nKing, when they fent out a Jacobin Friar toafTaffi-\nnate him in his Tent as he lay at the Siege of Paris.\nIn a Word, this Opera of the Cloven-Foot has\nbeen acted all over the Chriftian World, ever fince\nJudas betrayed the Son of God with a Kifs &amp;gt;\nnay,\nour Saviour fays expreily of him, One of you is a\nDevil 5 and the facred Text fays in another Place,\nThe Devil entered into Judas.\nIt would take up a great deal of Time and\nPaper too, to give you a full Account of the\nTravels of this Cloven-Foot j\nits\nProgrefs into all\nthe Courts of Europe^ and with what mod accu\nrate Hypocrify Satan has made uie of it\nupon ma\nny Occafions, and with what Succefsj but as in\nthe elaborate Work of which I juft now gave\nyou a Specimen I defign one whole Volume upon\nthis Subject, and which I {hall call, The compleat\nHift ory of the Cloven- Foot 3 I fay,\nfor that Reafon,\nand diverfe others, I fhall fay but very little more\nto it in this Place.\nIt remains to tell you, that this merry Story\nof the Cloven-Foot is\nvery eflential to the Hiftory\nwhich I am now writing, as it has been all along\nthe great Emblem of the Devil s Government in\nthe World, and by which all his mofl confiderable\nEngagements have been anfwer d and executed j\nfor as he is faid not to be able to conceal this\nFqot?\nbut that he carries it\nalways with him, it\nT 3 imports\n\f27 S The Modern HISTORY\nimports moft plainly, that the Devil would be no\nDevil if he was not a DifTembler, a Deceiver, and\ncarried a double Entendre in all he does or fays 3 that\nhe cannot but fay one Thing and mean another,\npromife one Thing and do another, engage and\nnot perform, declare and not intend, and act like\na true Devil as he is,,\nwith a Countenance that is\nno Index of his Heart.\nI might indeed go back to Originals, and de\nrive this Cloven- Foot from Satan s\nprimitive State\nas a Cherubim or a celeftial Being, which Chc-\nrubims, as Mofes is faid to have (een them about\nthe Throne of God in Mount Sinai, and as the\nfame Mofes, from the Original reprefented them\nafterwards covering the Ark, had the Head and\nFace of a Man, Wings of an Eagle, Body of a\nLion, and Legs and Feet of a Calfj but this is not\nib much to our prefent Purpofe, for as we are to\nallow that whatever Satan had of heavenly Beau\nty before the Fall, he loft it all when he com-\nmenc d Devil, fo to fetch his Original fo far up\nwould be only to fay, that he retained nothing but\nthe Cloven-Foot, and that all the reft of him was\nalter d and deform d, become frightful and horri\nble as the DEVIL 5 but his Cloven-Foot, as we\nnow underftand it, is rather myftical and emble-\nmatick, and defcribes him only as the Fountain\nof Mifchief and Treafon, and the Prince of Hy\npocrites, and as fuch we are now to fpeak of\nhim.\nTis from this Original all the hypocritic World\ncopy, he wears the Foot on their Account, and\nfrom this Model they at : This made our bleffed\nLord tell\nthem, the Works of your Father ye will\ndo, meaning the Devil, as he had exprefs d it\njuft\nbefore.\nNor does he deny the Ufe of the Foot to the\nmeaner Clafs of his Difciples in the World, but\ndecently\n\fof the DEVI L. 279\ndecently equips them all\nupon every Occafion\nwith a needful Proportion of Hypocrify and De\nceit -,\nthat they may hand on the Power of pro-\nmifcuous Fraud thro all his temporal Dominions,\nand wear the Foot always about them as a Badge\nof their profefs d Share in whatever is done by\nthat Means.\nThus every Diflembler, every falfe Friend, every\nfecret Cheat, every Bearskin-Jobber has a Clo-\nwen-Foot^ and fo far hands on the Devil s Intereft\nby the lame powerful Agency of Art, as the\nDevil bimfelf ufes to aft when he appears in Per-\nfon, or would aft if he was juft now upon the\nSpot 5 for this Foot is a Machine which is to be\nwound up and wound down, as the Catife it\nap\npears for requires\n-\ny and there are Agents and En\ngineers to aft in it\nby Directions of Satan (the\ngrand Engineer) who lies ftill in his Retirement,\nonly ifTuing out his Orders as he fees convenient.\nAgain, every Clafs, every Trade, every Shop\nkeeper, every Pedlar, nay, that meaneft ofTradcf-\nmen, that Church Pedlar the Pope, has a Cloven-\nFoot, with which he Paw w^s upon the World,\nwiihes them all well, and at the lame time cheats\nthem y wifhes them all fed, and at the fame time\nitarves them j wiihes them all in Heaven, and at\nthe fame time marches before them direftly to\nthe Devil, alamode de Cloven-Foot.\nNay, the very Bench, the everliving Foun\ndation of Juflice in the World -\ny how often has it\nbeen made the Tool of Violence, the Refuge of\nOppreffion, the Seat of Bribery and Corruption, by\nthis Moniler in Mafquerade, and that every where\n(our own Country always excepted) ?\nThey had\nmuch better wipe out the Picture ofjudice

cannot\nform an Idea more fuitable, nor the Devil pro-\npofe an Engine more or better qualified for an O-\nperation ofJuftice,by the Influence of Bribery and\nCorruption &amp;gt;\nit is this\nmagnipotent Inflrument in\nthe Hands of the Devil, which under the clofeft\nDifguife agitates every Paffion, bribes every Af\nfection, blackens every Virtue, gives a double\nFace to Words and Aftions, and to all Perfons\nwho have any Concern in them, and in a Word,\nmakes us all Devils to one another.\nIndeed the Devil has taken but a dark Emblem\nto be diftinguifh d by, for this of a Goat wasfaid\nto be a Creature hated by Mankind from the begin\nning, and that there is a natural Antipathy in\nMankind againft them: Hence the Scape Goat\nwas to bear the Sins of the People, and to go\ninto the Wildernefs with all that Burthen upon\nhim.\nBut we have a Saying among us, in Defence\nof which wemuffc enquire into the -proper Sphere\nof Action which may be afTigned to this Cloven-\nFoot, as hitherto defcribed : The Proverb is this;\nEvery Devil has not a Cloven-Foot. This Pro\nverb, inilead of giving us fome more favourable\nThoughts of the Devil, confirms what I have\nfaid already, that the Devil rais d this Scandal up\non himfelfj I mean, the Report that he cannot\nconceal or difguife his Devil s Foot, or Hoof,\nbut that it muft appear, under whatever Habit\nhe fhews himfelfj and the Reafon I\ngave holds\ngood flill, namely^ that he may be more effeflu-\nally conceal d when he goes abroad without it :\nFor if the People were fully perfuaded that the\nDevil could not appear without this Badge of\n4 his\n\fof the DEVIL;\nhis Honour, or Mark of his Infamy, take it as you\nwill -\ny and that he was bound alfo to ihew it\nup\non all Occafions, it would be natural to con\nclude, that whatever frightful Appearances might\nbe feen in the World, if the Cloven-Foot did\nnot alfo appear, we had no Occafion to look for\nthe Devi^ or fo much as to think of him, much\nlefs to apprehend he was near us &amp;gt;\nand as this\nmight\nbe a Miftake, and that the Devil might be there\nwhile we thought our felves fo fecure, it\nmight\non many Occalions be a Miftake of very ill Con-\nfequence, and in particular, as it would give the\nDevil room to a6b in the Dark, and not be di\ncover d, where it\nmight be moft needful to know\nhim.\nFrom this fhort Hint, thus repeated, I draw\na new Thefis, namely, That Devil is moft dan\ngerous that has no Cloven-Foot 5 or, if you will\nhave it in Words more to the common Under-\nftanding, the Devil feems to be moft dangerous\nwhen he goes without his Cloven- Foot.\nAnd here a learned Speculation offers it felf to\nour Debate, and which indeed I ought to call a\nCouncil of Cafuifts, and Men learned in the De\nvil s Politicks, to determine :\nWhether is moft hurtful to the World, the\nDevil walking about without his Cloven-Foot, or\nthe Cloven-Foot walking about without the De*\nvil?\nIt is indeed a nice and difficult Queftion, and\nmerits to be well enquir d into 3 for which Rea-\nfon, and diverfe others, I have referr d it to be\ntreated with fome Decency, and as a Difptite of\nPignity fufficient to take up a Chapter by itfelf.\nCHAP.\n\f282 The Modern HISTORY\nCHAP.

This will neceffo-\nrily bring me to fome Debate upon the moft\nimportant Queftion of Apparitions,\nHaunt-\nings, Walkings, &c. whether of Satan in\nhuman\n\fEVl L. 28 j\nhuman Shape, or of human Creatures in the\nDevil s\nShape, or in any other manner what-\nibever.\n2, I mutt alfo be allow d to tell\nyou that\nSatan has a great deal of Wrong done him\nby the general embracing vulgar Errors, and\nthat there is a Cloven-Foot oftentimes with\nout a Devil; or, in fhort, that Satan is not\nguilty of all the fimple Things, no, or of\nall the wicked Things we charge him with.\nThefe two Heads well fettled will fully explain\nthe Title of this Chapter, anfwer the Query men\ntioned in it, and at the fame time\ncorrespond\nve\nry well with, and give us a farther ProfpecT: into\nthe main and original Defign of this Work,\nnamely^ the Hiftory of the Devil. We are fo\nfond of, and pleafed with the general Notion of\nfeeing the Devil^ that I am loth to difoblige my\nReaders fo much as calling in queftion his Vifi-\nbility would do. Nor is it\nmy Bufinefs, any\nmore than it is his, to undeceive them, where\nthe Belief is fo agreeable to them; efpecially fince\nupon the whole tis not one Farthing matter, ei\nther on one Side or on the other, whether &quot;it be\nfo or no, or whether the Truth of Fact be ever\ndifcovcred or not.\nCertain it is, whether we fee him or no, here\nhe is, and I make no doubt but he is\nlooking on\nwhile I am writing this Part of his Story, whe\nther behind me, or at\nmy Elbow, or over my\nShoulder, is not material to me, nor have I once\nturned my Head about to lee whether he is there\nor no &amp;gt;\nfor if he be not in, the Infide, I have fo\nmean an Opinion of all his extravafated Powers,\nthat it feems of very little Confequence to me\nwhat Shape he takes up, or in what Pofture he\nappears 5 nor indeed can I find in all\nmy Enquiry\nthat\n\f284 The Modern HISTORY\nthat ever the Devil appeared (Qua Devil} in any\nof the mod dangerous or important of his De-\nfigns in the World &amp;gt;\nthe moft of his Projects,\nefpecially\nof the fignificant Part of them, having\nbeen carried on another way.\nHowever, as I am fatisfied no Body will be\npleas\nd if I fhould difpute the Reality of his Ap\npearance, and the World runs away with it as a\nreceiv d Point, and that admits no Difpute, I\nfhall moft readily grant the General, and give\nyou fome Account of the Particulars.\nHiftory is fruitful of Particulars, whether In\nvention has fupply d them or not&amp;gt;\nI will not fay,\nwhere the Devil is\nbrought upon the Stage in\nplain and undeniable Apparition : The Story of\nSamuel being rais d by the Witch of Endor^ I\nfhall leave quite out of my Lift, becaufe there\nare fo many Scruples and Objections againft that\nStory 3 and as I fhall not difpute with the Scrip\nture, fo on the other hand, I have fo much De\nference for the Dignity of the Devil^ as not to\ndetermine rafhly how far it\nmay be in the Power\nof every old (Witch} Woman, to call him up\nwhenever fhe pleafes, and that he mud come,\nwhatever the Pretence is, or whatever Bufinefs\nof Confequence he may be engaged in, as often\nas tis needful for her to Pa &amp;lt;wa for half a Crown,\nor perhaps lefs than half the Money.\nNor will I undertake to tell\nyou, till I have\ntalk d farther with him about it, how far the\nDevil is concerned to difcover Frauds, detect\nMurthers, reveal Secrets, and efpecially to tell\nwhere any Money is hid, and fhew Folks where\nto find it ; tis an odd thing that Satan fhould\nthink it ofConfequence to come and tell us where\nfuch a Mifcr hid a Strong Box, or where fuch\nan old Woman buried her Chamber Pot full of\nMoney, the Value of all which is perhaps but a\nTrifle,\n\fof the DEVIL. 2*5\nTrifle, when at the fame time he lets fo many\nVeins of Gold, fo many unexhaufled Mines, nay,\nMountains of Silver, as, we may depend upon\nit, are hid in the Bowels of the Earth, and which\nit would be fo much to the Good of whole Na\ntions to difcover, lie flill there, and never fay one\nWord of them to any Body. Befides, how\ndoes the Devil s\ndoing Things fo foreign to him-\nfelf, and fo out of his way, agree with the reft\nof his Character ; namely, {hewing a kind of a\nfriendly Difpofition to Mankind, or doing bene\nficent Things ? This is fo beneath Satan s Quali\nty, and looks fo little, that I fcarce know what\nto fay to it j but that which is ftill more pun\ngent in the Cafe is, thefe Things are fo out of\nhis Road, and fo foreign to his\nCalling, that it\n{hocks our Faith in them, and feems to claih\nwith all the juft Notions we have of him, and\nof his Bufinefs in the World. The like is to\nbe faid of thofe little merry Turns we bring him\nin acting with us, and upon us, upon trifling and\nfimple Occafions, fuch as tumbling Chairs and\nStools about Houfe, fetting Pots and Veilels Bot\ntom upward, tofling the Glafs and Crokery\nWare about without breaking ^ and fuch like mean\nfoolifli Things, beneath the Dignity of the De-\ni\/\n\/V, who, in\nmy Opinion, is rather employ d in\nletting the World with the Bottom upward,\ntumbling Kings and Crowns about, and dafhing\nthe Nations one againft another j raifing Tern-\npelts and Storms, whether at Sea, or on Shore 5\nand, in a word, doing capital Mifchiefs fuitablc\nto his Nature, and agreeable to his Name, Devil;\nand fuited to that Circumftance of his Condition,\nwhich I have fully reprefented in the primitive\nPart of his exil d State.\nBut to bring in the Devil playing at Pufh-pin\nwith the World, or like Dvmitian catching Flies,\nthat\n\f186 The Modern HISTORY\nthat is to fay, doing nothing to the purpofe 5 this\nis not only deluding our felves, but putting a\nSlur upon the Devil himfelf$ and, I fay, I fhall\nnot dishonour Satan fo much as to fuppofe any\nthing in it :\nHowever, as I mufl have a care too\nhow I take away the proper Materials of Winter\nEvening Frippery, and leave the good Wives\nnothing of the Devil to fright the Children witfy\nI fhall carry the weighty Point no farther. No\ndoubt the Devil and Dr. Fauftus were very inti\nmate j I fhould rob you of a very fignificant\n*\nProverb, if I fhould fo much as doubt it j no\ndoubt the Devil fhew d himfelf in the Glafs to\nthat fair Lady who look d in it to fee where to\nplace her Patches j but then it ihould follow too\nthat the Devil is an Enemy to the Ladies wear\ning Patches, and that has fome Difficulties in it\nwhich we cannot fo eafily reconcile &amp;gt;\nbut we mull\ntell the Story, and leave out the Confequenccs.\nBut to come to nifere remarkable Things, and\nin which the Devil has thought fit to ac~b in a\nFigure more fuitable to his\nDignityj\nand on Oc-\ncafions confiftent with himfelf &amp;gt;\ntake the Story\nof the Appearance of Julius C*\/ar, or the Devil\nafluming that murthered Emperor^ to the great\nMarcus Brutus^ who notwithflanding all the good\nThings faid to juftify it, was no lefs than a King-\nkiller and an Aflaffinator, which we in our Lan\nguage call by a very good Name, and peculiar\nto the Englijh Tongue, a Ruffian.\nThe Spe6fcre had certainly the Appearance of\nC&amp;lt;efar^\nwith his Wounds bleeding freih, as if\nhe had juft received the fatal Blow &amp;gt;\nhe had re-\nproach d him with his Ingratitude, with a 70\nBrute! tu quoque, mi fill:\n&quot;\nWhat Thou Brutus!\n* As great as the Devil and Doftsr Fauftus. Vulg- Dr. Fofter.\nThou?\n\fof the D E V i L.\n&quot;\nThou, my adopted Son !\n&quot;\nNow Hiftory feems\nto agree univerfally, not only in the Story itfelf,\nbut in the Circumfiances of it\n-\ny we have only to\nobferve that the Devil had certainly Power to\naflame, not a human Shape only, but the Shape\nof Julius Ctffar in particular.\nHad Brutus been a timorous Confcience-harry ^\nweak-headed Wretch, had he been under the\nHorror of the Gailt, and terrify d with the Dan\ngers that were before him at that time, we might\nfuggeft that he was over-run with the Vapours,\nthat the Terrors which were upon his Mind dif-\norder d him, that his Head was delirious and pre-\npofTefs d, and that his Fancy only plac d Cafar\nib continually in his Eye, that it realiz d him to\nhis Imagination, and he bcliev d he faw him ;\nwith many other fuggefted Difficulties to inva\nlidate the Story, and render the Reality of it\ndoubtful.\nBut the contrary, to an Extreme, was the Cafe\nof Brutus ; his known Character plac d him a-\nbove the Power of all\nHypocondriacks, or fan\nciful Delufions ; Brutus was of a true Roman\nSpirit, a bold Hero, of an intrepid Courage ;\none that fcorn d to fear even the Devil, as the\nStory allows :\nBefides, he glory d in the Action &amp;gt;\nthere cou d be no Terror of Mind upon him &amp;gt;\nhe\nvalued himfelf upon it, as done in the Service of\nLiberty, and the Caufe of his Country 5 and was\nfo far from being frighted at the Devil in the\nworfl Shape, that he ipoke fir ft to him, and ask d\nhim, What art thou ? and when he was cited to\nfee him again at Philippi^ aniwer d, with a Gal\nlantry that knew no Fear, well I willfee thee there.\nWhatever |Se Devil s Bufinefs was with Brutus,\nthis is certain, according to all the Hiftorians\nwho give us the Account of it, that Brutus dif-\ncovcr d no Fear ; he did not, like Saul at Endor^\nfall\n\f288 The Modern HISTORY\nfall to the Ground in a Swoon, i Sam. xxviii. lo.\nThen Saul fell all along upon the Earth, and there\n&amp;lt;was no Strength in him, and was fore afraid. In\na word, I fee no room to charge Brutus with be\ning over-run with the Hyppo, or with Vapours,\nor with Fright and Terror of Mind j but he faw\nthe Devil, that s certain, and with Eyes open, his\nCourage not at all daunted, his Mind refolute,\nand with the utmoft Compofure fpoke to him,\nreply d to his Anfwer, and defy d his Summons\nto Death, which indeed he feafd not, as\nappeared\nafterward.\nI come next to an Inftance as eminent in Hif-\ntory as the other -,\nthis was in Char. VI. of France^\nfirnamed, The Beloved; who riding over the Fo-\nreil near Mans, a ghaftly frightful Fellow ( that\nis to fay, the Devil fo clothed in human Vizor)\ncame up to his Horfe, and taking hold of his\nBridle, ftop d him, with the Addition of thefe\nWords, Stop King) whither go you ? Tou are be-\ntrafd! and immediately difappear d. It is true,\nthe King had been diftemper d in his Head be\nfore, and fo he might have been deceived, and\nwe might have charg d it to the Account of a\nwhimfical Brain, or the Power of his Imagina\ntion 5 but this was in the Face of his Attendants,\nfeveral of his great Officers, Courtiers, and Prin\nces of the Blood being with him, who all law\nthe Man, heard the Words, and immediately, to\ntheir Aftonifhment, loft Sight of the Spe&re, who\nvanifli d from them all.\nTwo Witnefles will convict a Murtherer, why\nnot a Traitor? This muft be the Old Gentleman,\nemblematically fo called, or who muft it be? nay,\nwho elfe could it be? His Uglinefs is not the\nCafe, tho ugly as the Devil, is a Proverb in his\nFavour j but vanifhing out of fight is an Effen-\ntial to a\nSpirit, and to an evil Spirit in our Times\ncfpecially.\nThefe\n\fof the DEVILS\nThefe are fome of the Devil s Extraordinaries,\nand it muft be confefs d they are not the moil\nagreeable to Mankind, for fometimes he takes\nupon him to diforder his Friends very much on\nthefe Occafions^ as in the above Cafe of Cha. VI.\nof France 5 the King, they fay, was really de\nmented ever after 5 that is, as we vulgarly, but\nnot always improperly, exprefs it, he was really\nfrighted out of his Wits. Whether the malicious\nDevil intended it fo, or not, is not certain, tho\nit was not fo foreign to his particular Difpofition\nif -he did.\nBut where he is more intimate, we are told he\nappears in a manner lefs\ndifagreeable3 and there\nhe is more properly a familiar Spirit -,\nthat is, in\nfhort, a Devil of their Acquaintance : It is\ntrue,\nthe Antients underftand the Word, a familiar\nSpirit, to be one of the kinds of PolTeffion j but\nif it ferves our turn as well under the Denomina\ntion of an intimate Devil^ or a Devil vifitant,\nit muft be acknowledg d to be as near in the li\nteral Senfe and Acceptation of the Word, as the\nothers nay, it muft be allow d tis a very great\nPiece of Familiarity in the Devil to make Vifits$\nand fhew none of his Difagreeables, not appear\nformidable, or in the Shape of what he is, re-\nfpetfully withholding his difmal Part, in Com-\npaflion to the Infirmities of his Friends.\nIt is true, Satan may be obliged to make dif\nferent Appearances, as the feveral Circumfiances\nof Things call for it 5 in fome Cafes he makes\nhis publick Entry, and then he muft {hew him-\nfelf in his Habit of Ceremony ; in other Cafes\nhe comes upon private Bufinefs, and then he ap\npears in Difguife \\ in fome publick Cafes he may\nthing fit to be incog, and then he appears drefs d\na la Mafque j fo they fay he appeared at the fa\nmous St. Bartholomew Wedding at Paris^ where\nU he&quot;\n\f290 The Modern HISTORY\nhe came in drefs d up like a Trumpeter, danc d\nin his Habit, founded a Levet, and then went out\nand rung the Alarm-Bell (\nwhich was the Signal\nto begin the Maflacre) half an Hour before the\nTime appointed, left the King s Mind ihould al\nter, and his Heart fail him.\nIf the Story be not made upon him, (\nfor we\nfhould not flander the Devil) it fhould feem, he\nwas not thoroughly fatisfied in King Charles IX. s\nSteadinefs in his Caufe 5 for the King, it feems,\nhadrelax d a little once before, and Satan might be\nafraid he would fall off again, and fo prevent the\nExecution: Others fay, the King did relent im\nmediately after the ringing the Alarm-Bell, but\nthat then it was too late, the Work was begun,\nand the Rage of Blood having been let loofe a-\nmong the People, there was no recalling the Or\nder. If the Devil was thus brought to the Ne-\nceflhy of a fecret Management, it muil be owned\nhe did it\ndexteroufly &amp;gt;\nbut I have not Authority\nenough for the Story, to charge him with the\nParticulars, fo I leave it au croc.\nI have much better Vouchers for the Story\nfollowing, which I had fo folemnly confirm d by\none that liv d in the Family, that I never doubt\ned the Truth of it. There liv d, in the .Parifh\nof St. Bennet Fynk, near the Royal Exchange, an\nhoneft poor Widow Woman, who, her Husband\nleing lately dead, took Lodgers into her Houfe&amp;gt;\nthat is, fhe let out fome of her Rooms in order\nto leflen her own Charge of Rent &amp;gt;\namong the\nreft, fhe let her Garrets to a working Watch-\nwheel-maker, or one fome way concern d in\nmaking the Movements of Watches, and who\nwork dto thofe Shop-keepers who fell Watches j\nas is ufual.\nIt happened that a Man and Woman went up,\nto fpeak with this Movement-maker upon fome\nBufinefs\n\fof the DEVIL. 291\nBufinefs which related to his Trade, and when\nthey were near the Top of the Stairs, the Garret-\nDoor where he ufually worked being wide open,\nthey faw the poor Man (\nthe Watch-maker, or\nWheel-maker) had hang d himfelf upon a Beam\nwhich was left\nopen in the Room a little lower\nthan the Plaifler, or Ceiling :\nSuypriz d at the\nSight, the Woman flop d, and cried out to the\nMan who was behind her on the Stairs that he\nihould run up, and cut the poor Creature down.\nAt that very Moment comes a Man haflily\nfrom another Part of the Room which they\nupon the Stairs could not fee, bringing a Joint-\nStool in his Hand, as if in great Hafle, and fets\nit down jufl by the Wretch that was hang d,\nand getting up as haflily upon it\npulls a Knife\nout of his Pocket, and taking hold of the Rope\nwith one of his Hands, beckon d to the Woman\nand the Man behind her with his Head, as if to\nflop and not come up, fhewing them the Knife\nin his other Hand, as if he was jufl going to cue\nthe poor Man down.\nUpon this, the Woman flopp d a while, but\nthe Man who flood on the Joint-Stool continued\nwith his Hand and Knife as if fumbling at the\nKnot, but did not yet cut the Man down &amp;gt;\nat\nwhich the Woman cried out again, and the Man\nbehind her call d to her, Go up, fays he^ and help\nthe Man upon the Stool !\nfuppofing fomething\nhindred. But the Man upon the Stool made Signs\nto them again to be quiet, and not come on, as\nif faying, I {hall do it immediately &amp;gt;\nthen he\nmade two Strokes with his Knife, as if cutting\nthe Rope, and then flopped again ; and flill the\npoor Man was hanging, and confequently dying :\nUpon this, the Woman on the Stairs cried out\nto him, What ails\nyou ?\nWhy don t you cut the\npoor Man down? And the Man behind her,\nU 2.\nhaving\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\nhaving no more Patience, thrufts her by, and faid\nto her, Let me come, I ll warrant you I ll do it 5\nand with that runs up and forward into the Room\nto the Man 5 but when he came there, behold,\nthe poor Man was there hanging ; but no Man\nwith a Knife, or Joint-Stool, or any fuch thing\nto be fecn, all that was Spectre and Delufion, in\norder, no doubt, to let the poor Creature that\nhad hang d himfelf periih and expire.\nThe Man was fo frighted and furpriz d, that\nwith all the Courage he had before, he drop d on\nthe Floor as one dead, and the Woman at laft\nwas fain to cut the poor Man down with a Pair\nof Sciflars, and had much to do to effecl: it.\nAs I have no room to doubt the Truth of this\nStory, which I had from Perfons on whofe Ho-\nnefty I could depend, fo I think it needs very\nlittle Trouble to convince us who the Man upon\nthe Stool mufl be, and that it was the Devil who\nplac d himfelf there in order to finiih the Mur-\nther of the Man who he had, .D^v\/Mike, tempt\ned before, and prevail d with to be his own Ex\necutioner. Befides, it correfponds fo well with\nthe Devil s Nature, and with his Bufinefs, viz.\nthat of a Murtherer^ that I never queftion d it&amp;gt;\nnor can I think we wrong the Devil at all to\ncharge him with it.\nN. B. I cannot be pofitive in the remaining\nPart of this Story, viz. whether the Man\nwas cut down foon enough to be recover d,\nor whether the Devil carry d his Point, and\nkept off the Man and Woman till it was\ntoo late 5 but be it which it will, tis\nplain\nhe did his Devilifh Endeavour, and ftay d till\nhe was forc d to abfcond again.\nWe have many folid Tales well attefted, as\nWell in Hiitory as in the Reports of honeft Peo\nple,\n\fof the D E V I L. 293\npie, who could not be deceived, intimating the\nDevtfs perfonal Appearance, fome in one Place*\nfome in another j as alfo fometimes in one Habit\nor Drefs, and fometimes in another &amp;gt;\nand it is to\nbe obferved, that in none of thofe which are moil\nlike to be real, and in which there is leaft of\nFancy and Vapour, you have any Mention of\nthe Cloven Foot, which rather feems to be a mere\nInvention of Men (and perhaps chiefly of thofe\nwho had a Cloven Underftandingl I mean a {fol\nlow kind of Craft, the Effect of an empty and\nfimple Head, thinking by fuch a well-meant, tho\nweak Fraud, to reprefent the Devil to the old\nWomen and Children of the Age, with fome\nAddition fuitable to the Wcaknefs of their Intel\nlects, and fuited to making them afraid of him.\nI have another Account of a Peri on who tra-\nvell d upwards of four Years with the Devil in\nhis Company, and conversed moft intimately with\nhim all the while -,\nnay, if I may believe the\nStory, he knew moft part of the Time that he\nwas the Devil^ and yet conversed with him, and\nthat very profitably, for he perform d many very\nufeful Services for him, and conftantly preferv d\nhim from the Danger of Wolves and wild Reafts,\nwhich the Country he travell d thro was intole^\nrably full of. Where, by the way, you are to un-r\nderftand, that the Wolves and Bears in thofe\nCountries knew the Devil, whatever Difguife he\nwent in -\ny or that the Devil has fome Way to\nfright Bears and fuch Creatures, more than we\nknow of. Nor could this Devil ever be prevail d\nupon to hurt him or any of his Company. This\nAccount has an innumerable Number of divert\ning Incidents attending it ; but they are equal to\nall the reft in Bulk, and therefore top long for\nfhis Book.\nU J\nI End\n\f294- The Modern HISTORY\nI find too upon fome mofe ordinary Occafl-\nons the Devil has appear d to feveral People at\ntheir Call : This indeed {hews abundance of good\nHumour in him, confidering him as a Devil^ and\nthat he was mighty compliafant :\nNay fome, they\ntell u?, have a Power to raife the Devil when\never they think fit 3 this I cannot bring the De\nvil to a Level with, unlefs I fhould allow him to\nbe Servus Servorum, as another Devil in Difguife\ncalls himfelf ; fubjected to ever old Wizard s\nCall 3 or that he is under a NecerTity of appear\ning on fuch or fuch particular Occafions, who\never it is that calls him 5 which would bring the\nDevil s Circumftances to a pitch of Slavery which\nI fee no Reafon to believe of them.\nHere alfo I muft take Notice again, that tho*\nI fay the Devil^ when I fpeak of all thefe Appa\nritions, whether of a greater or lefler Kind, yet\nI am not oblig d to fuppofe Satan himfelf in Per-\nfon is concerned to {hew himfelf, but that fome\nof his Agents^ Deputies and Servants, are lent to\nthat Purpofe, and direfted what Difguife of Flefh\nand Blood to put on, as may be fuitable to the\nOccafion.\nThis feems to be the only Way to reconcile all\nthofe fimple and ridiculous Appearances which\nnot Satcin^ but his Emiflaries, (\nwhich we old\nWomen call Imps) fometimes make, and the\nmean and forry Employment they are put to:\nThus Fame tells us of a certain Witch of Qua\nlity, who calFd the Devil once to carry her over\na Brook where the Water was fwelPd with a\nhafly Rain, and lafh d him foundly with her\nWhip for\nletting her Ladyfhip fall into the Wa\nter before ihe was quite over. Thus alfo, as\nFame tells us, fhe fet the Devil to work, and\nmade him build Croivland Abbey, where there\nwas no Foundation to be found, only for dif-\nturbing\n\fof the DEVIL. 295\nturbing the Workmen a little who were firft fee\nabout it. So it fcems another laborious Devil\nwas oblig d to dig the great Ditch croft the Coun\ntry from the Fenn Country to the Edge of Suf\nfolk and Effex &amp;gt;\nwhich who ever he has preferv d\nthe Reputation of, and where it crofles New-\nMarket Heath, tis call d Devil s Ditch to this\nDay.\nAnother Piece of Punifhment no doubt it was,\nwhen the Devil was oblig d to bring the Stones\nout of Wales into Wiltfoire, to build Stone-heng ;\nHow this was ordered in thofe Days, when it\nTeems they kept Satan to hard Labour, I know\nnot y I believe it muft be regiftred among the an-\ntient Pieces of Art which are loft in the World,\nfuch as melting of Stone, painting of Glafs, &V.\nCertainly they had the Devil under Correction\nin thofe Days &amp;gt;\nthat is to fay, thofe lefler Sorts\nof Devils y but I cannot think that the muckle\nfhief Devil, as they call him in the North, the\nGrand Seignior Devil of all, was ever reduced to\nDifcipline. What Devil it was that Dunftan\ntook by the Nofe with his red hot Tongs, I have\nnot yet examin d Antiquity enough to be certain\nof, any more than I can what Devil it was that\nSt. Francis play d fo many warm Tricks with,\nand made him run away from him fo often : How\never, this I take upon me to fay, in the Devil s\nBehalf, that it cou d not be our Satan, the Arch\nDevil of all Devils, of whom I have been talk*\ning fo long.\nNow is it unworthy the Occafion, to take no\ntice that we really wrong the Devil, and fpeak\nof him very much to his Difadvanrage, when we\nfay of fuch a Great Lord, or of fuch a Lady of\nQuality, \/ think the Devil is in your Grace : No,\nno, Satan has other Bufinefs, he very rarely pof-\nfeifes F Is ; Befides, fome are fo far from hav-\nU 4 ing\n\f396 The Modern HISTORY\ning the Devil in them, that they are really tranft\nmigrated into the very EfTence of the Devil them-\nfelves 3 and others again not tranfmigrated, or af-\nfimilated, but Indeed and in Truth {hew us that\nthey are to have mere native Devils in every Part\nand Parcel of them, and that the reft is\nonly\nMafque and Difguife.

I\ncould run you a Length beyond all thofe Exam\nples, and give you fuch a Lift of Devils among\nthe gay Things of the Town, that would fright\nyou to think of 3 and you would prefently con\nclude, with me, that all the perfect Beauties arc?\nDevils, mere Apparitions 5 but Time and Paper\nfails, fo we muft only leave the Men the Caution,\nlet them, venture at their Peril. I return to the\nSubject.\nWe\n\fof the DEVIL. 311\nWe have a great many charming Apparitions\nof like kind go daily about the World in com-\npleat Mafquerade, and, tho we mull not lay fo,\nthey are in themfelves mere Devils, wicked dan\ngerous murthering Devils, that kill various Ways,\niome, Bafilisk-like, with their Eyes &amp;gt;\nfome Sy\nren-like, with their Tongues 5 all Murtherers,\neven from the Beginning : It is true, tis\npity\nthefe pretty Apparitions fhould be Devils, and be\nfo mifchievous as they are &amp;gt;\nbut fince it is fo, I\ncan do no lefs than to advertife you of it, that\nyou may ihun the Devil in whatever Shape you\nmeet with him.\nAgain, there are fome half Devils, they fay,\nlike the Sagittarii^ half Man, half Horfe, or ra\nther like the Satyr^ who, they fay\nr\n,\nis half Devil,\nhalf Man &amp;gt;\nor, like my Lord Bifhop, who, they\n\/3} ,was half-headed 5 whether they mean half- wit-\nted or no, I do not find Authors agreed about\nit : But if they had voted him fuch, it had been\nas kind a thing as any they cou d fay of him, be-\ncaufe it would have cleared him from the Scandal\nof being a Devil, or half a Devil, for we don t\nfind the Devil makes any Alliance with F- Is.\nThen as to merry Devils, there s\nmy Matter\nQ } he may indeed have the Devil in him,\nbut it muft be faid, to the Credit of Pofleffion in\ngeneral, that Satan would have fcorn d to have\nentred into a Soul fo narrow that there was not\nroom to hold him, or to take up with fo difcord-\ning a Creature, fo abject, fo fcoundrel, as never\nmade a Figure among Mankind greater than that\nof a Thier^ a Moroder^ moulded up into Quality,\nand a Raparee drefs d up a-U-Mafque, with a Robe\nand a Coronet.\nSome little\nDog-kennel Devil may indeed take\nup his Quarters in or near (him, and fo run into\nand out of him as his Drum beats a Call j but\nX 4 to\n\f312 The Modern HISTORY\nto him that was born a Devil, Satan, that never\nacts to no purpofe, cou d not; think him worth\nbeing pofleis d by any thing better than a Devil\nof a dirty Quality ; that is to fay, a Spirit too\nmean to wear the Name of Devil^ without fome\nBadge or Addition of Infamy and Meannefs to\ndiftingufh it\nby.\nThus what Devil of Quality would be con-\nfin d to a P ........ ,\nwho inheriting all the\nPride and Infolence of his Anceftors, without\none of their good Qualities , the Bully, the Bil*\nlingsgate^ and all the hereditary ill\nLanguage of\nhis Family, without an Ounce of their Courage 5\nthat has been refcued five or iix times from the\nScandal of a Coward, by the Bravery, and at the\nHazard of Friends, and never faiFd to be un\ngrateful 5 that if ever he committed a Murther,\ndid it in cold Blood, becaufe no body could prove he\never had any hot 3 who pofTefs d with a Poltroon\nil^ was always wickeder in the Dark, than he\ndurft be by Day-light 5 and who, after innumer\nable paffive Sufferings, has been turned out of hu\nman Society, becaufe he could not be kick d or\ncufPd either into good Manners or good Hu\nmour.\nTo fay this was a Devil^ an Apparition, or\neven a half Devil ,\nwould be unkind to Satan\njiimfelf, fince tho he (the Devil) has fo many\nMillions of inferior Devils under his Command,\nnot one cou d be found bafe enough to match him,\nnor one Devil, found but what would think him-\nfelf difhonour d to be employ d about him.\nSome merry good-for-nothing Devils we have\nindeed, which we might, if we had room, (peak\nof at large, and divert you too with the Relation,\nfuch as my Lady Haft s Devil in E\/ex, who up\non laying a Joiner s Mallet in the Window of 3\ncertain Chamber, would come very orderly and\nknock\n\fof the DEVIL. 313\nknock with it all\nNight upon the Window, or\nagainft the Wainfcot, and difturb the Neighbour\nhood, and then go away in the Morning, as well\nfatisfied as may be 3 whereas if the Mallet was\nnot left, he would think himfelf affronted, and\nbe as unfufferable and terrifying, as poffible,\nbreaking the Windows, fplitting the Wainfcot,\ncommitting all the Diforders, and doing all the\nDamage that he was able to the Houfe, and to\nthe Goods in it. And again, fuch as the Drum-\ning Devil in the Well at Oundle in Northampton&quot;\nJlrire^ and fuch like.\nA great many antick Devils have been feen al-\nfo, who feem d to have little or nothing to do,\nbut only to allure us that they can appear if they\npleafe, and that there is a Reality in the thing\ncall d Apparition.\nAs to Shadows of Devils, and imaginary Ap\npearances, fuch as\nappear, and yet are invifible at\nthe fame time, I had thought to have beftow d a\nChapter upon them by themfelves, but it may be\nas much to the Purpofe to let them alone, as to\nmeddle with them j tis faid our old Friend Lu\nther ufed to be exceedingly troubled with fuch\ninvifible Apparitions ,\nand he tells us much of\nthem, in what they call his Table-talk -\ny but with\nMatter Luther s leave, tho the Devil pafTes for\na very great Lyar, I could fwallow many things\nof his own proper making, as foon as fome of\nthofc I find in a Book that goes by his Name,\nparticularly the Story of the Devil in a Basket,\nthe Child flying out of the Cradle, and the\nlike.\nIn a word, the walking Devils that we have\ngenerally among us, are of the female Sex j whe\nther it be that the Devil finds lefs Difficulty to\nmanage them, or that he lives quieter with them,\nor that they arc fitter for his Bufinefs than the\n2 Men9\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\nMen, I fliall not now enter into a Difpute about\nthat -, perhaps he goes better difguis d in the fair\nSex than otherwife $ Antiquity gives us many\nHiftories of She-Devils, fuch as \\vc can very\nfeldom match for Wickedneis among the Men &amp;gt;\nfuch now as in the Text, Let s\nDaughters, Jo-\nfepb s Miftrefs, Sampfon s\nDalilah, Herod s Hero-\ndias^ thefe were certainly Devils, or play d the\nDevil fufficiently in their Turn j one Male\nApparition indeed the Scripture furnifhes you\nwith, and that is\nJudas ; for his Matter fays ex-\nprefly of him, One of you is a Devil ; not has the\nDevil, or is\npofiefs d of the DEVIL 5 but really is\na DEVIL, or is a real DEVIL.\nHow happy is it, that this great Secret comes\nthus to be difcover d to mankind ?\nCertainly the\nWorld has gone on in Ignorance a long time,\nand at a ftrange rate, that we ihould have fo\nmany Devils continually walking about among us\nin humane Shape, and we know it not.\nPhilofophers tell us that there is a World of\nSpirits, and many learned Pieces of Guefs-work\nthey make at it, representing the World to be\nfo near us, that the Air, as they defcribe it, muft\nbe full of Dragons and Devils^ enough to fright\nour Imaginations with the very Thoughts of\nthem ; and if they fay true, tis our great\nFelicity that we cannot fee any Eirthcr into it\nthan we do, which if we could, would appear as\nfrightful as Hell itfelf &amp;gt;\nbut none of thofe Sages\never told us, till now, that half the People who\nconverfe with us MZ Apparitions^ efpecially of the\nWomen &amp;gt;\nand among them efpecially this valu\nable Part, the Woman of Figure, the fair, the\nbeautiful, or patch d and painted.\nThis unufual Phenomenon has been feen but a\nlittle while, and but a little way, and the general\nPart of Mankind cannot come into the fame No\ntions\n\fof the DEVIL. 315\ntions about it j nay, perhaps they will all think it\nftrange 5 but be it as\nftrange as it will, the Na\nture of the Thing confirms it, this lower Sphere\nis full of Devils j and fome of both Sexes have\ngiven ftrange Teftimonies of the Reality of their\npre-exiflent Devilifm for many Ages part, tho\n1 think it never came to that Height as it has\nnow.\nIt is true, in former times Satan dealt much in\nold Women, and thofe, as I have obfcrv d alrea\ndy, very ugly, Ugly as a Witch, Black as a Witch^ \/\nlook like a Witch^ all\nproverbial Speeches, and which\nteftify d what Tools it was Satan generally work d\nwith 5 and thefe old Spec~bres, they tell us, us d\nto ride thro the Air in the Night, and upon\nBroomfticks too, all\nmighty homely Doings &amp;gt;\nfome fay they us d to go to vifit their Grand\nSeignior the Devil) in thofe Nocturnal Perambu\nlations : But be that as it will, tis certain the\nDevil has chang d hands, and that now he walks\nabout the World cloth d in Beauty, cover d with\nthe Charms of the Lovely, and he fails not to\ndifguife himfelf effectually by it, for who would\nthink a beautiful Lady could be a Mafque to the\nDevil? and that a fine Face, a divine Shape, a\nheavenly Afpec~r, ihould bring the Devil in her\nCompany, nay, fliould be herfelf an ^pparition^\na mere DEVIL.\nThe Enquiry is indeed worth our while, and\ntherefore I hope all the enamoured Beaus and\nBoys, all the Beauty-hunters and Fortune-hunters,\nwill take heed, for I fuppofe if they get the DC-\nvil, they will not complain for want of a For\ntune 3 and there s\nDanger enough, I allure you,\nfor the World is full of Apparitions, non rofa\nfine fpinis 5 not a Beauty without a Devil^ the\nold Women Spe6bres, and the young Women\nApparitions 5 the ugly ones Witches, and the\nhandfome\n\f3 i6 The Modern HISTORY\nhandfome ones Devils &amp;gt;\nLord ha Mercy, and a\n&amp;gt;J&amp;lt; may be fct on the Man s Door that goes a\ncourting.\nCHAP. VIII.\nOf the Cloven- Foot walking about the World\nwithout the Devil, (viz.) of Witches\nwaking Bargains for the Devil, and par\nticularly of felling the Soul to the Devil.\nI\nHave dwelt long upon the Devil in Mafque\nas he goes about the World incog, and efpe-\ncially without his Cloven-Foot, and have touch\ned upon ibme of his Difguifes in the Manage\nment of his Intereft in the World 5 I muft lay\nfome of his Difguifes only, for who can give a\nfull account of all his Tricks and Arts in fo nar\nrow a Compafs as I am prefcrib d to ?\nBut as I laid, that every Devil has not a Clo\nven-Foot, fo I muft add now for the prefent\nPurpofe, that every Cloven-Foot is not the Devil.\nNot but that wherever I fliould meet the Clo\nven-Hoof, I fliould expect that the Devil was not\nfar off, and fliould be apt to raife the PofTe againft\nhim, to apprehend him j yet it\nmay happen other-\nwife, that s certain &amp;gt;\nevery Coin has its Counter\nfeit, every Art its Pretender, every Whore her\nAdmirer, every Error its Patron, and every Day\nhas its DEVIL.\nI have had fome thought of making a full and\ncompleat Difcovery here of that great Doubt\nwhich has fo long piizzl d the World, namely,\nwhether there is\nany fuch Thing, as fecret making\nBargains with the Devil, and the firft positive\nAflurance I can give you in the Cafe, is,\nthat if\nthere\n\fof theDE VIL; 317\nthere is not, tis not his Fault, tis not for want\nof his Endeavour, tis\nplain, if you will pardon me\nfor taking fo mean a Step, as that of quoting\nScripture j I fay, tis evident he would fain have\nmade a Contract with our Saviour, and he bid\nboldly (give him his due} namely, all the King\ndoms of the World for one bend of his Knee : Im\npudent Seraph ! To think thy Lord fhould pay\nthee Homage ! How many would agree with him\nhere for a lefs Price !\nThey fay, Oliver Cromwell\nftruck a Bargain with him, and that he gave\nOliver the Prote&orfhip, but would not let him\ncall himfelf King, which (luck fo clofe to that\nFuriofo) that the Mortification fpread into his\nSoul, and tis faid, he dy d of a Garigreen in the\nSpleen. But take Notice and do Oliver Juftice ;\nI do not vouch the Story, neither does the Bi-\niliop fay one Word of it.\nFame us d to fay, that the old famous Duke of\nLuxemburg [made a Magic compact of this Kind 5\nnay, I have heard many an (old Woman) Officer\nof the Troops, who never car d to fee his Face, de\nclare that he carry d the Devil at his Back. I re\nmember a certain Author of a News Paper in Lon\ndon was once taken up, and they fay, it coft him\nfo\/. for printing in his News, that Luxemburg\nwas Humpbacked. Now if I have refolv d the Dif\nficulty, namely, that he was not hump d, only\ncarry d the Devil at his Back 5 I think the poor\nMan fhould have his fo \/.\nagain, or I fhould have\nit for the Difcovery.\nI confefs, I do not virell underfland this com\npacting with fach a Fellow as can neither write\nnor read j nor do I know who is the Scrivener\nbetween them, or how the Indenture can be exe\ncuted j but that which is worfe than all the reft\nis, that in the firft Place, the Devil never keeps\nArticles j he will contract perhaps, and they fay\nhe\n\f|is The Modern HISTORY\nhe is mighty forward to make Conditions 5 but whd\n{hall bind him to the Performance, and where is the\nPenalty if he fails? if we agree with him, he\nwill be apt enough to claim his Bargain and de\nmand Payment \\ nay, perhaps before it is due $\nbut who fhall make him fland to his.\nBeiides, he is a Knave in his\nDealing, for he\nreally promifes what he cannot perform j wit-\nnefs his impudent Propofal to our Lord mention\ned above, All thefe Kingdoms will I give thee !\nLying Spirit ! Why they were none of thine to\ngive, no not one of them j for the Earth is the\nLords and the kingdoms thereof, nor were they\nin his Power any more than in his Right : So ( I\nhave heard that) fome poor difmal Creatures have\nfold thcmfclves to the Devil for a Sum of Money,\nfor fo much Cafh, and yet even in that Cafe,\nwhen the Day of Payment came, I never heard\nthat he brought the Money or paid the Purchafe,\nfo that he is a Scoundrel in his Treaties, for you\nihall trufl for your Bargain, but not be able to\nget your Money 5 and yet for your Part, he\ncomes for you to an Hour :\nOf which by it\nfelf.\nIn a Word, let me caution you all, when you\ntrade with the Devil, either get the Price or quit\nthe Bargain &amp;gt;\nthe Devil is a cunning Shaver, he\nwill wriggle himfelf out of the Performance on\nhis Side if poffible, and yet expect you fhould\nbe punctual on your Side. They tell you of a\npoor Fellow in Herefordjhire^ that offer d to fell\nhis Soul to him for a Cow, and though the De~\nvii promifed, and as they fay, fign d the Wri\ntings, yet the poor Countryman could never get\nthe Cow of him, but flill as he brought a Cow\nto him, fome body or other came and challeng d\nit, proving that it was loft or ftolen from them &amp;gt;\nfo that the Man got nothing but the Name of a\nCow-itcaler, and was at laft carried to Hereford\nGoal\n\fvfthe DEVIL, 319\nGoal, and condemned to be hang d for\ndealing two\nCows, one after the other : The wicked Fellow\nWas then in the greateft Diftrefs\nimaginable, he\nfummon d his Devil to help him out, but he fail\ned him, as the Devil always will $&amp;gt;he\nreally had\nnot ftolen the Cows, but they were found in his\nPoiTefHon, and he could give no Account how\nhe came by them -,\nat laft he was driven to confefs\nthe Truth, told the horrid Bargain he had made,\nand how the Devil often promised him a Cow,\nbut never gave him one, except that feveral Times\nin the Morning early he found a Cow put into his\nYard, but it always prov d to belong to fome of\nhis Neighbours : Whether the Man was hang d\nor no, the Story does not relate -,\nbut this Part is\nto my Purpofe, that they that make Bargains\nwith the Devi^ ought to make him give Secu\nrity for the Performance of Covenants, and who\nthe Devil would get to be bound for him, I can t\ntell, they muft look to that who make the Bar\ngain :\nBefides, if he had not had a Mind to cheat\nor baffle the poor Man, what need he have taken\na Cow fo near home ? if he had fuch and fuch\nPowers as we talk of, and as Fancy and Fable fur-\nniih for him, could not he have carried a Cow\nin the Air upon a Broom- Hick, as well as an old\nWoman ? Could he not have flole a Cow for him\nin Lincoln\/hire^ and fet it down in Hereford\/hire^\nand fo have performed his Bargain, faved his Credit,\nand kept the poor Man out of Trouble ? fo that\nif the Story is True, as I really believe it is, either\nit is not the Devil that makes thofe Bargains, or\nthe Devil has not fuch Power as we bellow on\nhim, except on fpecial Occafions he gets a Per\nmit, and is bid go, as in the Cafe of Job^ the\nGadaren Hogs^ and the like.\nWe have another Example of a Man s\nfelling\nhimfelf to the Devil, that is\nvery remarkable, and\nthat\n\f320 The MoJernHIS TORY\nthat is in the Bible too, and even in that, I do\nnot find, what the Devil did for him, in Payment\nof the Purchafe Price. The Perfon felling was\nAhab) of whom the Text fays exprefly, there\nwas none like him, who did fell himfelf to work\nWickednefs in the Sight of the LORD, i\nKings xxi.\n20, and the ^$. I think it\nmight have been ren-\ndred, if no tranflated in Spight of the Lord^ or\nin Defiance of God; for certainly that s the Mean\ning of it ^ and now allowing me to preach a lit\ntle\nupon this Text, my Sermon {hall be very\nfhort. Ahab fold himfelf, who did he fell him\nfelf to ? I anfwer that Queftion by a Queftion j\nwho would buy him ? who, as *we fay^ would\ngive any thing for him ? and the Anfwer to that is\nplain alfo, you may judge of the Purchafer by\nthe Work he was to do 5 he that buys a Slave in\nthe Market, buys him to work for him, and to do\nfuch Bufinefs as he has for him to do : Ahab was\nbought to work wickednefs, and who would buy\nhim for that but the Devil ?\nI think there s no room to doubt but Ahab\nfold himfelf to the Devil 5 the Text is\nplain that\nhe fold himfelf, and the Work he was fold to do\npoints out the Mafter that bought him 5 what\nPrice he agreed with the Devil for, that indeed\nthe Text is filent in, fo we may let it alone, nor\nis it much to our Purpofe, unlefs it be to enquire\nwhether the Devil ftood to his Bargain or not,\nand whether he paid the Money according to A-\ngreement, or cheated him as he did the Farmer at\nHereford.\nThis buying and felling between the Devil and\nus, is, I rnufl confefs, an odd kind ofStock-jobbing,\nand indeed the Devil may be faid to fell the Bear-skin^\nwhatever he buys $ but the flrangeft Part is when\nhe comes to demand the transfer 5 for as I hint\ned before, whether he Performs or no, he expeclrs\nhis\n\fof the DEVIL. 3Jt\nhis Bargain to a Tittle 5 there is indeed fome Dif\nficulty in refolving how and in what Manner\nPayment is made 5 the Stories we meet with in\nour Chimney-Corner Hifiories, and which are\nfo many Ways made Uie of to make the Devil\nfrightful to us and our Heirs for ever, arc general\nly fo foolifh and ridiculous, as, if true or not true,\nthey have nothing Material in them, are of no\nSignification, or elfe fo impoilible in their Na\nture, that they make no Impreilion upon any\nbody above twelve Years old and under ieventy\n*\ny\nor elfe are fo tragical that Antiquity has fabled\nthem down to our Tafte, that we might be able\nto hear them and repeat them with lefs Horror\nthan is due to them.\nThis Variety has taken off our Relifh of the\nThing in\ngeneral, and made the Trade of Soul-\nfelling, like our late more eminent Bubbles, be\ntaken to be a Cheat and to have little in it.\nHowever, to (peak a little more gravely to it,\nI cannot fay but that fince, by the two eminent\nInflances of it above in Ahab^ and in Chrift him-\nfelf, the Fa6t is\nevidently afcertain d &amp;gt;\nand that\nthe Devil has attempted to make fuch a Bargain\non one, and actually did make it with the o-\nther. The Poffibility of it is not to be difpu-\ntedj but then I mult explain the Manner of it\na little, and bring it down, nearer to our Under-\n{landing, that it may be more intelligible than it\nis 5 for as for this felling the Soul, and making a\nBargain to give the Devil PofTeffion by Livery\nand Seifin on the Day appointed, that I cannot\ncome into by any Means; no nor into the other\nPart, namely, of the Devil coming to claim his Bar\ngain, and to demand the Soul according to Agree\nment, and upon Default of a fair Delivery, taking\nit away by Violence Cafe andall^ ofwhich we have\nmany hiftorical Relations pretty current among\nY usj\n\f32* The Modern HISTORY\nus j fome of which, for ought I know^ we mignt\nhave hop d had been true, if we had not been lure\nthey were falfe, and others we had Reafon to fear\nwere falfe, becaufe it was impoffible they fhould\nbe true.\nThe Bargains of this Kind, according to the\nbed Accounts we have of them, ufed to confift\nof two main Articles, according to the ordinary\nStipulations in all Covenants; namely,\n1. Something to be perform d on the Devil s\nPart, buying.\n2. Something to be perform d on the Man s\nPart, felling.\ni . The Devil s Part : This was generally fome\npoor Trifle, for the Devil generally bought good\nPenny-worths, and oftentimes like a compleat Shar\nper, agreed to give what he was not able to procure $\nthat is to fay, would bargain for a Price he could\nnot pay, as in the Cafe of the Hereford Man and\nthe Cow 5 for Example, i.\nLong Life: This tho*\nthe deluded Chapman has often had folly enough\nto contract for, the Devil never had Power to\nmake good $ and we have a famous Story, how\ntrue 1 know not, of a Wretch that fold himfelf\nto the DEVIL on Condition he, Satan, fhould\nallure him (i.) That he fhould never want Victu\nals 5 (i.) That he fhould never be a cold * (3,)\nThat he fhould always come to him when hecalFd\nhim \\ and (4.) That he ihould let him live one and\ntwenty Years, and then Satan was at Liberty to\nhave him 5 that is, I\nfuppofe, to take him where-\never he could find him.\nIt fecms, the Fellow s defire to be aflur d of 2.x\nYears Life, was chiefly, that during that Time,,\nhe might be as wicked as he would, and fhould yet\nbe fure not to be hang d, nay, to be free from\nall Punifhment ; upon this Foot tis faid he com-\nxnenc d Rogue, and committed a great many Rob*\nc beries\n\fDEVIL; 323\nberics and other villanous Things 5 now it feems\nthe Devil was pretty true to his\nBargain in feveral\nofthofe things 5 particularly, that two or three times\nwhen the Fellow was taken up for petty Crimes,\nand call d for his old Friend, he came and fright\ned the Constables fo, that they let the Offender\nget away from them : But at\nLength having\ndone fome capital Crime, a Set of Conflables, or\nfuch like Officers, feiz d upon him, who were\nnot to be frighted with the Devil, in what Shape\nfoever he appear d 5 fo that they carry d him off,\nand he was committed to Newgate or fome other\nPrifon as effectual.\nNor could Satan with all his Skill unlock his\nFetters, much lefs the Prifon Doors j But he\nwas try d, convicted, and executed. The Fel\nlow in his Extremity, theyfay, expostulated with\nthe Devil for his Bargain, the Term of 2.1 Years\nit fecms not being expir d. But the Devil^ it\nis faid, fliufH d with him, told him a good while,\nhe would get him out, bid him have Patience and\nflay a little, and thus led him on, till he came\nas it were within Sight of the Gallows5\nthat, is\nto fay, within a Day or two of his Execution &amp;gt;\nwhen the Devil cavuTd upon his Bargain, told\nhim, he agreed to let him live zi Years, and he\nhad not hindred him, but that he did not Co\nvenant to caufe him to live that Time &amp;gt;\nthat there\nwas a great deal of Difference between doing\nand fufferingj that he was to fuffer him to live,\nand that he did 5 but he could not make him live\nwhen he had brought himfelf to the Gallows.\nWhether this Story were true or not, for you\nmuft not expect we Hiftorians fhould anfwer for\nthe Difcourfe between the Devil and his Chaps,\nbecaufe we were not privy to the Bargain : I fay,\nwhether it was true or not, the Inference is to\nour Purpofe feveral Ways.\nY z *. It\n\f324 The Modern HISTORY\ni. It confirms what I havefaid of the Knavery\nof the Devil in his Dealings, and that when\nhe has Stock -jobb d with us on the bed\nConditions he can get, he very ieldom per\nforms his Bargain.\nz. It confirms what I have likewife faid, that\nthe Devifs Power is limited 5 with this Addi\ntion, that he not only cannot deltroy the\nLife of Man, but that he cannot preferve it *\nin foort) he can neither prevent or bring on\nour Deftrution.\nI may be allowed, I\nhope, for the Sake of the pre-\nfent Dilcourfe, to fuppofe that the Devil would\nhave been fo juft\nto this wicked, tho foolifh Crea\nture, as to have fav d him from the Gallows if he\ncould &amp;gt;\nbut it feems, he at laft acknowledged that\nit was not in his Power 3 nay, he could not keep\nhim from being taken and carry d to Prifon, af\nter he was gotten into the Hands of a bold Fel\nlow or two, that were not to be fcar d with his\nBlufter, as fome fooliili Creatures had been before.\nAnd how fimple, how weak, how unlike any\nThing of an Angelick Nature, was it to attempt\nto (live the poor Wretch, only by little Noifes\nand fham Appearances, putting\nout the Candles,\nrufhing and jofleling\nin the Dark, and the like !\nIf the Devil was that mighty Seraph,which wehave\nheard of, if he is a God of this World, a Prince\nof the Air, a Spirit able to deftroy Cities and\nmake Havock in the World 5 if he canraifeTem-\npefts and Storms, throw Fire about the World,\nand do wonderful Things, as an unchain d Ztavtao\nDoubt could do j\nwhat need all this Frippery ? and\n\\vhat need he try lo many ridiculous Ways, by the\nEmptinefs, nay, the filly\nnonfenfical Manner, of\nwhich, he {hews, that he is able to do no better,\nand\n\fof the DEVI L. 325\nand that his Power is\nextinguiuYd ?

It feems he comes with Rage and\nFury upon fuch Occafions, pretending he only\ncomes to take his own, or as if he had leave giv\nen him to come and take his Goods, as we fay^\nwhere he could find them, and would ftrike a\nTerror into all that ihould oppofe him.\nThe greater! Part of the Terror we are ufually in\nupon this Occafion, is from a Suppofition, that\nwhen this Hell-Fire Contract is once made, God\nallows the Devil to come and take $e wick\ned\n\f3 *s The Modern HISTORY\ned Creature, how and in what manner he thinks\nfit, as being given up to him by his own Act and\nDeed $ but in my Opinion there s no Divinity\nat all in that $ for as in our Law we punifh a\nFelo defe^ or Self-murtherer, becaufe, as the Law\nfaggefoi he had no Right to difmifs his own Life ;\nthat he being a Subject of the Common-wealth,\nthe Government claims the Ward or Cuftody of\nhim, and fo twas not Murther only, but Robbery,\nand is a Felony againlt the State, robbing the\nKing of his Liege-Man, as tis\njuftly caWd-\ny fo\nneither has any Man a Right to difpofe of his\nSoul, which belongs to his Maker in\nProperty and\nin Right of Creation : The Man then having no\nRight to fell, Satan has no Right to buy, or at beft\nhe has made a Purchafe without a Title, and con-\nfequently has no juft Claim to the PofTeffion.\nIt is therefore a Miftake to fay, that when any\nof us have been fo mad to make fuch a pretend\ned Contract with the Devil, that God gives him\nleave to take it as his Due 5 V\/V no fuch thing $ the\nDevil IMS bought, what you had no Right to fell,\nand therefore, as an unlawful Oath is to be re\npented of, and then broken $ fo your Bufinefs is\nto repent of the Crime, and then tell the Devil^\nyou have better confider d of it, and that you\nwon t Hand to your Bargain, for you had no\nPower to fell &amp;gt;\nand if he pretends to Violence\nafter that, I am miftaken &amp;gt;\nI believe the Devil\nknows better.\nIt is true, our old Mothers and Nurfes have\ntold us other Things, but they only told us what\ntheir Mothers and Nurfes told them, and fo the\nTale has been handed down from one Generation\nof old Women to another ; but we have no Vou\nchers for the Fact other than Oral Tradition, the\nCredit of which, I confefs, goes but a very\nlittle Way with me$ nor do I believe it one Jot\nthe\n\fof the DEVIL: $ 5i\nthe more for all the frightful Addenda which they\ngenerally join to the Tale, for it never wants a\ngreat Variety of that Kind.\nThus they tell us the Devil carried away Dr.\nFauftus,and took a Piece of the Wall of his Gar\nden along with them : Thus at Salisbury the De-\n*uil) as it is\nfaid, and publickly printed, carried\naway two Fellows that had given themfelves up\nto him, and carried away the Roof of the Houfe\nwith them, and the like; all which I believe my\nShare of 5 befides, if thefe Stories were really\ntrue, they are all\nagainfl the Devil s true Interefr,\nSatan muft be a Fool, which is indeed what I\nnever took him to be in the Main 5 this would\nbe the Way not to encreafe the Number of Defpe-\nradoes, who fhould thus put themfelves into his\nHand, but to make himfelf a Terror to them -,\nand this is one of the moft powerful Objec\ntions I have againfl the Thing, for the Devil,\nI fay, is no Fool, that muft be acknowledg d 3 he\nknows his own Game, and generally plays it\nfure.\nI might, before I quit this Point, ferioufly re\nflect here upon our Beau mondfoiz.) the gay Part of\nMankind, efpecially thofe of the Times we live in,\nwho walk about in a Compofure and Tranquillity\ninexpreffible, and yet as we all know, muft certain\nly have all fold themfelves to the Devil, for the\nPower of a&ing the fooliftieft Things with the\ngreater Applaufe $ it is true, to be a Fool is\nthe mofl pleafant Life in the World, if the Fool\nhas but the particular Felicity, which few Fools\nwant, (viz.) to think themfelves wife : The\nlearned fay, it is the Dignity and Perfection of\nFools, that they never fail trufting themfelves &amp;gt;\nthey\nbelieve themfelves fufficient and able for every\nThing &amp;gt;\nand hence their want or wafte of Brains is\nno Grievance to them, but they hug themfelves\nin\n\f3)4 The Modern HISTORY\nin the Sat;iety t\nof their own Wit ; but to bring\nother People to have the fame Notion of them^\nwhich they Have of themfelves, and to have\ntheir apifti and ridiculous Conduct make the fame\nImpreflion on the Minds of others, as it does on\ntheir own; this requires a general Infatuation, and\nirmft either be a Judgment from Heaven, or a\nMift of Hell ;\nnothing but the Devil can make\nall the Men of Brains applaud a Fool, and can\nany Man believe, that the Devil will do this for\nnothing? no, no, he will be well paid for it, and\nI know no other Way they\nhave to compound\nwith him, but this of Bargain afid Sale.\nTis the fame thing with Rakes and Bullies, as\ntis with Fools and Beaus ; and this brings me to\nthe Subjcft of buying and felling it felf, and to\nexamine what is underftood by it in the World,\nwhat People mean by fuch and fuch a Man felling\nhimfelf to the Devil : I know the common Ac\nceptation of it is, that they make fome Capitula\ntion for fome Indulgence in Wickednefs, on Con\nditions of Safety and Impunity, which the Devil\npromifes them ; tho as I laid above, he is a\nBite in that too, for he can t\nperform the Con\nditions ; however, I fay, he promifes boldly, and\nthey believe him, and for this\nPrivilege in Wick-\ncdneis, they confent, that he (hall come and fetch\nthem for his own, at fuch or fuch a Time.\nThis is the State of the Cafe in the general\nAcceptation of it ; I do not fay\ntis\nreally io, nay\ntis even an Inconfiftency in it felf; for one would\nthink, they need not capitulate with the Devil to\nbe fo, and fo, fuperlatively wicked, and give him\nfuch a Price for it, feeing, unlefs we have a wrong\nNotion of him, he is\nnaturally enclin d, as well as\navow dly willing to have all Men be as fuperlative\nly wicked as\npoflibly they can, and muft neceflarily\nbe always ready to ifTue out his Licenfes gratis,\nas\nfar\n\fbf the D E V I L: 35 j\nfar as his Authority will go in the Cafe 5 and there-\nFore I do not fee why the Wretches that deal\nwith him, fhould article with him for a Price 5\nbut fuppofe, for Argument fake, that it is fo, then\nthe next Thing is, fome capital Crime follows\nthe Contract, and then the Wretch is\nforfaken,\nFor the Devil cannot protect him, as he promi-\nfedj fo he is Trttft up^ and like Cokman at the\nGallows, he exclaims that there is no frutb in\nDevils.\nIt may be true, however, that under the power\nful Guard and Protection of the Devil, Men do\nfometimes go a great Way in Crime, and that per\nhaps farther in thefe our Days of boafted Morals\nthan was known among our Fathers 5 the on\nly Difference that I meet with between the\nSons of Belial in former Days, and thofe of our\nAges, feems to be in the Devil s\nManagement,\nnot in theirs 5 the Sum of which amounts to this,\nthat Satan feems to act with more Cunning,\nand they with lefs j for in the former Ages of\nSatan s Dominion, he had much Bufinefs upon\nhis Hands, all his Art and Engines, and Engineers\nalfo, were kept fully employed, to wheedle, allure,\nbetray and circumvent People, and draw them into\nCrimes, and they found him, as we may fay, a full\nEmployment j I doubt not, he was call d the\nTempter on that very Account ; but the Cafe\nfeems quite alter d now, the Tables are turned j\nthen the Devil tempted Men to fin, But now,\nin flsort) they tempt the Devil 3 Men pufh into\nCrimes before he puihes them j they out fhoot\nhim in his own Bow, out run him on his own\nGround, and, as we fay of fome hot Spurs who ride\nPoll, they whip the Poft-Boy &amp;gt;\nin a Word, the\nDevil feems to have no Bufineis now but to fit\nand look on.\nThis,\n\f336 The Modern HISTORY\nThis, I muft cofefs, fcems to intimate fome\nfecrct Compact between the Devil and them 5 but\nthen it looks, not as if they had contracted with\nthe Devil for leave to fin, but that the Devil had\ncontracted with them, that they fhould fin fo and\nfo, up to fuch a Degree, and that without giving\nhim the Trouble of daily Solicitation, priratc\nManagement, and artful fcrewing up their Pal-\nfions, their Affections and tUeir molt reur d Fa\nculties, as he was before oblig d to do.\nThis alfo appears more agreeable to the Na\nture of the Thing , and as it is a mofh exquifite\npart of Satan s\nCunning, fo tis an undoubted\nTeftimony of his Succefs$ if it was not fo, he\ncould never bring his Kingdom to fuch a height\nof abfolute Power as he has done $ this alfo folves\nfeveral Difficulties in the Affair of the World s\nprefent Way of finning, which otherwife it would\nbe very hard to underitand y as\nparticularly how\nfome eminent Men of Quality among us, whofe\ntipper Rooms are not extraordinary well furnifh-\ned in other Cafes, yet are fo very witty in their\nWickednefs, that they gather Admirers by hun\ndreds and thoufands -\ny who, however heavy, lutn-\npifh, flow and backward, even by Nature, and\nin force of Conftitution in better things, yet in\ntheir Race Devil-wards they are of a fudden\ngrown nimble, light of Foot, and outrun all\ntheir Neighbours &amp;gt;\nFellows that are as empty of\nSenfe as Beggars are of Honefty, and as far from\nBrains as a Whore is of Modefty ;

No, no, he is too wife for that 5 I can\nnever doubt a fecret Compact, if there is fuch a\nthing in Nature i when I fee a Head where there\nwas no Head, Senfe in Pojft where there is no\nSenfe in EJfe, Wit without Brains, and Sight\nwithout Eyes, tis all Devil-Work : Could G\nWrite Satyrs, that could neither read Latin orfpell\nEnglijh, like old Sir William Read, who wrote a\nBook of Opticks, which when it was printed,\nhe did not know which was the right Side upper-\nmoft, and which the wrong ? Could this eminent\nuninformed Beau turn Atheift, and make wife\nSpeeches againft that Being, which made him a\nFool, if the Devil had not fold him fome Wit in\nexchange for that Trifle of his, call d Soul? Had\nhe not bartered his Infide with that Son of the\nMorning, to have his Tongue tip d with Blafphe-\nmy, he that knew nothing of a God, but only\nto fwear by him, could never have fet up for a\nWit, to burlefque his Providence and ridicule his\nGovernment of the World.\nBut the Devil, as he is God of the World, has\none particular Advantage, and that is, that when he\nhas Work to do he very feldom wants Inflruments j\nwith this Circumftance alfo, that the Degene\nracy of human Nature fupplies him 5 as the\nlate King of France faid of himfelf, when they\nZ told\n\f338 The Modern HISTORY\ntold him what a Calamity was like to befal his\nKingdom by the Famine: Well, fays the King,\nthen I {hall not want Soldiers &amp;gt;\nand it ivas\n\/0, want\nof Bread (applied his Army with Recruits 5 fo\nwant of Grace fupplies the Devil with Repro\nbates for his Work.\nAnother Reafon why, I think, the Devil has\nmade more Bargains of that Kind we fpeak of,\nin this\nAge, is, becaufe he feems to have laid by\nhis Cloven-Foot &amp;gt;\nall his old Emiflaries, the Tools\nof his Trade, the Engineers which he employed\nin his Mines, fuch as Witches, Warlocks, Ma\ngicians, Conjurers, Aflrologers, and all the hellifh\nTrain or Rabble of human Devils^ who did his\nDrudgery in former Days, feem to be out of\nWork : I fhall give you a fuller Enumeration of\nthem in the next Chapter.\nThefe, I\nfay, fecm to be laid aiide , not that\nhis Work is abated, or that his Bufineis with\nMankind, for their Delufion and Deftruction is\nnot the fame, or perhaps more than ever 5 but the\nDevil feems to have chang d Hands j the Tem\nper and Genius of Mankind is alter d, and they\nare not to be taken by Fright and Horror, as\nthey were then : The Figures of thofe Creatures\nwas always difmal and horrible, and that is it\nwhich I mean by the Cloven-Foot -\ny but now Wit,\nBeauty and gay Things, are the Sum of his Craft,\nhe manages by the Soft and the Smooth, the\nFair and the Artful, the Kind and the Cunning,\nnot by the Frightful and Terrible, the Ugly and\nthe Odious. :\nWhen the Devil for weighty Difpatches,\nWanted Meflengers cunning and bold,\nHe pafs d by the beautiful Faces,\nAnd pick d out the Ugly and Old.\nOf\n\fof the DE VIL; 339\nOF thefe he made Warlocks and Witches^\nTo run of his Errands by Night,\nTill the over wrought Hag- ridden Wretches,\nWere as fit as the Devil, to\nfright.\nBut whoever has been his\nAdvifer,\nAs his\nKingdom encreafesin Growth -,\nHe now takes his Meafures much wifer,\nAnd Trafficks with Beauty and Youth.\nDifguis d in the Wanton and Witty,\nHe haunts both the Church and the Court,\nAnd fometimes he vifits the City&amp;gt;\nWhere all the beft Chriflians refort.\nThus drefs d up in full\nMafquerade,\nHe the bolder can range up and down*\nFor he better can drive on his Trade,\nIn any one s Name than his own.\nCHAP. VII.\nOf the Tools the Devil works with, (viz.)\nWitches, Wizards or Warlocks, Conjurers,\nMagicians, Divines, Aftrologers, Inter\npreters of T&amp;gt;r\nearns, Tellers of Fortunes $\nand above all the reft, his particular mo\ndern Trivy-Counfel\/ors call d Wits and\nFools.\nTHO\n, as jl have advanc d in the\nforegoing\nChapter, the Devil has very much chang d\nHands in his modern Management of the World,\n2* and\n\f34o The Modern HISTORY\nand that inftead of the Rabble and long Train\nof Implements reckoned up above, he now walks\nabout in Beaus, Beauties, Wits and Fools j yet\nI mufl not omit to tell\nyou that he has not dif-\nmifs d his former Regiments, but like Officers\nin Time of Peace, he keeps them all in half Pay,\nor like Extraordinary Men at the Cuflom-Houfe5\nthey are kept at a Call, to be ready to fill\nup\nVacancies, or to employ when he is more than\nordinarily full of Bufmefsj and therefore it\nmay\nnot be amifs to give fome brief Account of them,\nfrom Satan s own Memoirs, their Performance\nbeing no inconfiderable Part of his Hiftory.\nNor will it be an unprofitable Digreifion to\ngo back a little to the primitive Inftitution of all\nthefe Orders, for they are very antient, and I af-\nfure you, it\nrequires great Knowledge of Antiqui\nty, to give a Particular of their Original j I mail\nbe very brief in it.\nIn order then to this Enquiry, you mufl: know\nthat it was not for want of Servants, that Satan\ntook this Sort of People into his Pay 5 he had,\nas I have obierv d in its Place, Millions of dili-\nfent\nDevils at his Call, whatever Bulinefs, and\nowever difficult, he had for them to do$ but as\nI have faid above, that our modern People are\nforwarder than even the Devil himfelf can defire\nthem to be j and that they cd?me before they are\ncall d, run before they are fenr^ and crowd them-\nfelves into his Service $ fo it feems it was in thofe\nearly Days, when the World was one univerfal\nMonarchy under his Dominion, as I have at large\ndefcnb d in its Place.\nIn thofe Days the Wickednefs of the World\nkeeping a juft Pace with their Ignorance, this in\nferior Sort of low priz d Inftruments did the\nDevil s work mighty well &amp;gt;\nthey drudg d on\nin his Black-Art io laborioufly, and with fuch\ngood\n\fof the DEVIL. 341\ngood Succefs, that he found it was better to em\nploy them as Tools to delude and draw in Man\nkind, than to lend his invifible Implements a-\nbout, and oblige them to take fuch Shapes and\nDrefles as were neceffary upon every trifling Oo\ncafion$ which, perhaps, was more Coft than Wor-\nfhip, more Pains than Pay.\nHaving then a Set ofthefe Voluntiers in his Ser\nvice, the true Devil had nothing to do but to\nkeep an exaft Correfpondence with them, and\ncommunicate fome needful Powers to them, to\nmake them be and do ibmething extraordinary,\nand give them a Reputation in their Bufinefs j\nand thefe, in a Word, did a great Part of, nay\nalmoft all the Devil s Bufinefs in the World.\nTo this Purpofe gave he them Power, if we\nmay believe old Glanvilk^ Baxter^ Hlcks^ and other\nlearn d Confultors of Oracles, to walk invifible,\nto fly in the Air, ride upon Broom- (licks, and\nother Wooden Gear, to interpret Dreams, an-\nfwer Questions, betray Secrets, to talk (Gibbe-\nrifh) the univerfal Language, to raife Storms,\nfell Winds, bring up Spirits, difturb the Dead, and\ntorment the Living, with a thoufand other need\nful Tricks to amufe the World, keep themfelves\nin Veneration, and carry on the Devil s\nEmpire\nin the World.\nThe firfr. Nations among whom thefe infernal\nPractices were found, were the Chaldeans j and\nthat I may do Juftice in earneft, as well as in\njeft, it muft be allow d that the Chaldeans, or\nthofc of them fo calPd, were not Conjurers or\nMagicians, only Philofophers and Studiers of\nNature, wife, fober and fhidious Men at firfr, and\nwe have an extraordinary Account of them &amp;gt;\nand\nif we may believe fomc of our belt Writers of\nFame, Abraham was himfelf famous among\n{hem for fuch Magick, as Sir Walter Raleigh\nZ 5 expreffes\n\f342 The Modern HISTORY\nexprefles it, g)ui Contemplations Creaturarum Cog\nnovit Greatorem. .\nNowgranting this, it is all to my Purpofe, name\nly, that the Devil drew thefe wife Men in, to\nfearch after more Knowledge than Nature could\ninftrucT: them in &amp;gt;\nand the\nKnowledge of the true\nGod being at that Time funk very low, he de-\nbauch d them all with Dreams, Apparitions, Con\njurers, &c. till he ruin d the juft Notions they\nhad, and made Devils of them all, like himfelf.\nThe learned Senenfisy fpeaking of this Chaldean\nKind of Learning, gives us an Account of five\nSores of them 5 you will pardon me for being fo\ngrave as to go this Length back.\ni.

The Afaphim or Magi, or Magicians j\nSixtus Senenfis fays, they were fuch as\nwrought\nby Covenants with Devils, but turn d to it\nfrom their Wifdom, which was to ittidy the\npractical Part of Natural Philofophy, work\ning admirable Effects by the mutual Appli*\ncation of Natural Caufes.\nJ.\nThe Chartumim from being Rcafoners or\nDifputers upon difficult Points in Philofophy,\nbecame Enchanters and Conjurers. So,\n4. The Mecafphim or Prophets, they turn d to\nbe Sorcerers, Raifers of Spirits, fuch as\nwounded by an evil Eye, and by bitter Curfes,\nand were afterwards fam d for having familiar\nConverfe with the Devil^ and were called\nWitches.\ny. The Gazarim, from the bare obferving of\nthe good and bad Omens, by the Entrails\nof Beails, flying of Birds, &c. were turn d\nto Sacrifts or Priefls of the Heathen Idols\nand Sacrificers.\nThus, I fay, firft or laft the Devil engrofs d\nall the Wife-Men of the Eaft, for fo they are\ncalPd j made them all his own, and by them he\nwork d Wonders, that is, he filPd the World\nwith lying Wonders, as if wrought by thefe\nMen, when indeed it was all his own, from Be\nginning to the End, and fet on Foot meerly to\npropagate Delufion, impofe upon blinded and\nignorant Men j the God of this World blinded\ntheir Minds, and they were led away by the Sub-\ntilty of the Devil^ to fay no worfe of it, till\nthey became Devils themfelves, as to Mankind j\nZ 4 for\n\f344- The Modern HISTORY\nfor they carried on the Devil s Work upon all\nOccafions, and the Race of them flil) continue\nin other Nations, and fome of them among our\nielves, as we {hall fee prcfently.\nThe Arabians follow d the Chaldeans in this\nStudy, while it was kept within its due Bounds,\nand after them the Egyptians j and among the\nLatter we find that Jannes and Jambres were\nfamous for their leading Pharaoh by their pretend\ned magic Performances, to reject\nthe real Miracles\nof Mofes y and Hiflory tells us of flrange Pranks\nthe Wife-Men, the Magicians and the Southfay-\ners plaid to delude the People in the mofl early\nAges of the World.\nBut, as I\nfay, now, the Devil has improved\nhimfelf, fo he did then j for the Grecian and\nRoman Heathen Rites coming on, they outdid\nall the Magicians and Southfayers, by eflablifh-\njng the Devil s\nlying Oracles, which, as a Maf-\nter-Piece of Hell, did the Devil more Honour,\nand brought more Homage to him, than ever he\nhad before, or could arrive to fince.\nAgain,\nas by the fetting up the Oracles, all the\nMagicians and Southfayers grew out of Credits\nfo at the ceafing of thofe Oracles, the Devil was\nfain to go back to the old Game again, and take\nup with the Agency of Witches, Divinations,\nInchantments and Conjurings, as I hinted before,\nanfwcrable to the four Sorts mentioned in the\nStory of Nebuchadnezzar, (viz.) Magicians, Af-\ntrokgerS) the Chaldeans and the Southfayers : How\nthefe began to be out of Requeft, I have men-\ntion d already; but as the Devil has not quite\ngiven them over, only laid them afide a little for\nthe prefent, we may venture to ask what they\nwere, and what Ufe he made of them when he\ndid employ them.\nThe\n\f345\nThe Truth is, I think, as it was a very mean\nEmployment for any thing that wears a human\nCountenance to take up, fo I muft acknowledge,\nI think, twas a mean low priz d Bufinefs for\nSatan to take up with j below the very De\nvil-, below his\nDignity as an Angelic, tho con-\ndemn d Creature 3 below him even as a Devil;\nto go to talk to a parcel of ugly, deform d, fpite-\nful, malicious old Women 5 to give them Power\nto do Mifchief, who never had a Will, after they\nenter d into the State of old Pieman-Hood^ to do\nany thing elfe: Why the Devil always chofe\nthe uglieil old Women he could find 5 whether\ntFizardifm made them ugly, that were not fo\nbefore, and whether the Ugliaefs, as it was a\nBeauty in Witchcraft, did not encreafe according\nto the meritorious Performance in the Black-\nTrade? Thefe are all Queftions of Moment to\nbe decided, (if human Learning can arrive to fo\nmuch Perfection) in Ages to come.\nSome fay the evil Eye and the wicked Look\nwere Parts of the Enchantment, and that the\nWitches, when they were in the height of their\nBufinefs, had a powerful Influence with both;\nthat by looking upon any Perfon they could be\nwitch them, and make the Devil, as the Scots\nexprefs \/f, ride through them booted and fpurr d $\nand that hence came that very fignificant Saying,\nto look like a Witch.\nThe flrange Work which the Devil has made\nin the World, by this Sort of his Agents call d\nWitches, is fuch, and fo extravagantly wild, that\nexcept our Hope that mod of thofe Tales .happen\nnot to be true, I know not how any -crrie could\nbe eafy to live near a Widow after fhe was five\nand fifty.\nAll the other Sorts of Emiflaries which Satan\nemploys, come fhort of tjiefe Ghoftsj and Appa\nritions\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\nritions fometimes come and {hew themfelves, on\nparticular Accounts, and fome of thole Particu\nlars refpc&amp;lt;5b doing Juftice, repairing Wrongs,\npreventing Mifchief j fometimes in Matters very\nconfiderable, and on Things fo neceflary to pub-\nlick Benefit, that we are tempted to believe they\nproceed from fome vigilant Spirit who wifhes us\nwell &amp;gt;\nbut on the other Hand, thefe Witches are\nnever concern d in any thing but Mifchief ; nay9\nif what they do portends good to one, it ifTues\nin hurt to many &amp;gt;\nthe whole Tenour of their\nLife, their Defign in general, is to do Mifchief,\nand they are only employ d in Mifchief, and no\nthing elfe : How far they are furnifli d with Abi\nlity\nfuitable to the horrid Will they are veiled\nwith, remains to be defcrib d.\nThefe Witches, tis faid, are furnifh d with Pow\ner fuitable to the Occafion that is before them,\nand particularly that which deferves to be confi-\nder d, as Prediction, and foretelling Events, which\nI infift the Author of Witchcraft is not accom-\nplifh d with himfelf, nor can he communicate it\nto any other : How then Witches come to be\nable to foretel Things to come, which, tis faid,\nthe Devil liimfelf cannot know, and which, as I\nhave {hewn, tis evident he does not know him-\nfelf, is yet to be determin d} that Witches do\nforetel, is certain, from the Witch of Endor,\nwho foretold Things to Saul, which he knew\nnot before, namely, that he ihould be flain in\nBattle the next Day, which accordingly came to\npafs.\nThere are, however, and notwithftanding this\nparticular Cafe, many Inflances wherein the De\nvil has not been able to foretel approaching Events,\nand that in Things of the utmoft Confequence,\nand he has given certain foolifh or falfe Anfwers\nin fuch Cafes $ the DEVJL S Priefts, which were\nfummon d\n\fof the D EVIL; 347\nftmmon d in by the\nProphet Elija, to decide the\nDifpute between God and Baal, had the Devil\nbeen able to have inform d them of it, would\ncertainly have received Notice from him, of what\nwas intended againft them by Elija 3 that is to fay,\nthat they would be all cut in pieces\n-\ny for Satan\nwas not fuch a Fool as not to know that Baal\nwas a\nNon-Entity, a\nNothing, at beft a dead\nMan, .penfli d and\nrotting in his Grave* for Baal\nwas Bell or Belus anantient King of the Jffyrian\nMonarchy, and he could no more anfwer by Fire\nto confume the Sacrifice, than he could raifc him-\niclt from the dead.\nBut the Priefts of Baal were, left of their\nMatter to their juft Fate, namely, to be a Sa\ncriface to the Fury of a deluded People; hence\ninfer his\nInability, for it would have been very\nunkind and ungrateful in him not to have anfwer d\nthem, if he had been able. There is another\nArgument raifed here moft juftly againft the De\nvil, with Relation to his\nbeing under Refiraint,\nmd that of greater Eminence than we imagine\nand it is drawn from this\nvery PafTage, thus!\ntis not to be doubted but that Satan, who has\nmuch of the Element put into his Hands, as\nPrince of the Air, had a\nPower, or was able po\ntentially fpeaking, to have anfwer d Waal s Prietfs\nby Fire 5 Fire\nbeing in Vertue of his airy Prin\ncipality a Part of his Dominion ; but he was\ncertainly withheld by the Superior Hand, which\ngave him that\nDominion, I mean withheld for the\nOccafion only: So in another Cafe, it was plain\nthat\nBalaam, who was one of thofe Sorts of\nChaldeans mentioned above, who dealt in Divi\nnations and\nInchantments, was withheld from curf-\ning Ifrael.\nSome are of Opinion that Balaam was not a\nWitch or a Deafer with the Devil, becaufe tis\n\f348 The Modern HISTORY\nfaid of him, or rather he fays it of himfelf, that\nhe faw the Vifions of God, Numb. xxiv. \\6.\nHe hath faid) who heard the IVords of GOD, and\nknew the Knowledge of the moft High, which faw\nthe Vifions of the Almighty, faUinginto TRANCE,\nbut having his Eyes open : Hence uiey alledge he\nwas one of thofe Magi, which St. Auguftin\nfpeaks of, de Divinatione^ who by the Study of\nNature, and by the Contemplation of created\nBeings came to the Knowledge of the Crea\nture j and that Balaam s Fault was, that being\ntempted by the Rewards and Honours that the\nKing promifed him, he intended to have curs d If-\nraeh, but when his Eyes were open d, and that he\nlaw they were God s own People, he durfl not\ndo it 5 they will have it therefore, that except,\nas above, Balaam was a good Man, or at leaft\nthat he had the Knowledge of the true God,\nand the Fear of that God upon him, and that\nhe honeftly declares this. Numb. xxii. 18. If\nBalak would give me his Houfe full of Silver and\nGold, I cannot go beyond the Word of the Lord\nMY GOD : Where tho he is calPd a falfe Pro\nphet by fome, he evidently owns God, and af-\nfumes a Property in him, as other Prophets did ;\nMY GOD, and I cannot go beyond his Orders^\nbut that which gives me a better Opinion of Ba\nlaam than all this is, his plain Prophefy of Chrift,\nChap. xxiv. 17. where he calls him the Star of\nJacob) and declares, I jhall fee him, but not now,\nI Jhall behold him, but not nigh 5 there Jhall come\na Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter Jhall rife out\nof Ifrael, and Jhall fmite the Corners of Moab,\nand dejlroy all the Children of Seth, all which\ncxprefs not a Knowledge only, but a Faith in\nChrift} but I have done preaching, this is all\nby the by, I return to my Bufincfsa which is the\nTherq\n\fof the DEVI t: 349\nThere is another Piece of dark Pra&ice here,\nwhich lies between Satan and his particular\nAgents, and which they mult give us an Anfwer\nto, when they can, which I think will not be\nin hafte j and that is about the obfequious Devil\nfubmitting to be call d up into Vifibility,\nwhenever an old Woman has her Hand crofs d\nwith a white Six-pence, as they Call it : One\nwould think that inilead of thefe vile Things\ncall d Witches, being fold to the Devily the De\nvil was really fold for a Slave to them &amp;gt;\nfor how\nfar foever Satan s Refidence is off of this State\nof Life, they have Power, it feems, to fetch\nhim from home, and oblige him to come at their\nCall.\nI can give little Account of this, only that\nindeed fo it is j nor is the Thing fo ftrange in its\nfelf, as the Methods to do it are mean, foolifh,\nand ridiculous &amp;gt;\nas making a Circle and dancing in\nit, pronouncing fuch and fuch Words, faying\nthe Lord s\nPrayer backward, and the like $ now\nis this agreeable to the Dignity of the Prince of\nthe Air or Atmofphere, that he fhould be command\ned forth with no more Pomp or Ceremony than\nthat of muttering a few Words, fuch as the old\nWitches and he agree about ? or is there fome-\nthing elfe in it, which none of us or themfelves\nunderftand ?\nPerhaps, indeed, he is\nalways with thofe Peo\nple call d Witches and Conjurers, or at lead:\nibme of his Camp Volant are always prefent, and\nfo upon the leaft call of the Wizard, it is but\nputting off the mifty Cloak and Showing them\nfelves.\nThen we have a Piece of mock Pageantry in\nbringing thofe Things call d witches or Conju\nrers to Juftice, that is, firft to know if a Wo\nman be a Witch, throw her into a Pond, and if\nfhe\n\f3 50 The Modern HISTORY\nfhe be a Witch, {he will fwim, and it is not in\nher own Power to prevent it 5 if fhe does all fhe\ncan to fink her fell-; it will not do, fhe will fwim\nlike a Cork.

X.\nOf the various Methods the Devil takes\nto converfe with Mankind.\nHAving\nfpoken fomething of Perfons, and\nparticularly\nof fuch as the Devil thinks fit\nto employ in his Affairs in the World, it comes\nnext of courfc to fay fomething of the Manner\nhow he communicates his Mind to them, and\nby them to the reft of his Acquaintance in the\nWorld.\nI take the Devil to be under great Difficul\nties in his Affairs on his Part, efpecially occa-\nfion d by the Bounds which are fet him, or which\nPolicys oblige him to fet to himfelf, in his Ac-\ncefs to the converfing with Mankind ; tis evi\ndent he is not permitted to fall upon them with\nForce and Arms, that is to fay, to mufter up his\ninfernal Troops, and attack them with Fire and\nSword j if he was not loofe to aft in this Manner\nas he was able, by his 9wn feraphic Power to\nj have\n\fof the DEVIL; 353\nhave deftroy d the whole Race, and even the\nEarth they dwelt upon, fo he would certainly,\nand long ago have effectually done it ; his parti*-\ncular Interefts and Inclinations are well enough\nknown.\nBut in the next Place, as he is thus reftrain d\nfrom Violence, fo Prudentials reftrain him in all\nhis other Actings with Mankind 5 and being con*\nfin d to Stratagem, and fdft ftill Methods, fuch\nas Perfuafion, Allurement, feeding the Appetite,\nprompting, and then gratifying corrupt Defires,\nand the like &amp;gt;\nhe finds it for his Purpofe not to\nappear in Perfon, except very rarely, and then in\nDifguife &amp;gt;\nbut to ab all the reft in the Dark, un\nder the Vizor of Art and Craft, making Ufe of\nPerfons and Methods conceal d, or at leaft not\nfully underftood or difcover d.\nAs to the Perfons whom he employs, I have\ntaken fome Pains you fee to difcover fome of them ;\nbut the Methods he ufes with them, either to\ninform and inftriict, and give Orders to them,\nor to converfe with other People by them, thefeare\nvery particular,\nand deferve fome Place in our\nMemoirs, particularly\nas\nthey may ferve to remove\nfome of our Miflakes, and to take off fome of\nthe frightful Ideas we are apt to entertain in Pre\njudice of this great Manager j as if he was no\nmore to be match d in his Politics, than he would\nbe to be match d in his Power, if it was let\nloofe 5 which is fo much a Miftake, that on the\ncontrary, we read of feveral People that have\nabufed and cheated the Devil, a Thing, which\nI cannot fay, is\nvery honeft nor juft,\nnotwith-\nftanding the old Latin Proverb, Falkre fallentem\nnon eft fraus, (which Mert conftrtie, or rather\ni-ender, by way of Banter upon Satan) tis no Sin\nto cheat the Devil, which for all that, upon the\nwhole I deny, and alledge, that let the Devil\nA a aft\n\f354 The M^mzHISTORY\nad how he will by us, we ought to deal fairly\nby him.\nBut to come to the Bufmefs, without Cir\ncumlocutions &amp;gt;\nI am to enquire how Satan iflues\nout his Orders, gives his Inftruftions and fully\ndelivers his Mind to his Emiflaries, of whom I\nhave mention d fome in the Title to Chap. IX.\nIn order to this, you muft form an Idea of the\nDevil fitting in great State, in open Campaign,\nwith all his Legions about him, in the height of\nthe Atmofpherej or if you will, at a certain Di-\nftancc from the Atmofphere, and above it, that\nthe Plan of his Encampment might not be hur\nried round its own Axis, with the Earth s di\nurnal Motion, which might be fome Difturbance\nto him.\nBy this fix d Situation, the Earth performing\nits\nRotation, he has every Part and Parcel of it\nbrought to a diredk Opposition to him, and con-\nfequently to his View once in twenty four Hours:\nThe laft time I was there, if I remember right,\nhe had this Quarter of the World, which we\ncall Chriftendom, juft under his Eye &amp;gt;\nand as\nthe Motion is not fo fwift, but that his piercing\nOpticks can take a ftrift View of it tnfaffant}\nfor the Circumference of it\nbeing but twenty\none thoufand Miles, and its circular Motion being\nfull twenty four Hours performing, he has fome-\nthing more than an Hour to view every thou\nfand Miles, which, to his fupernatural Penetration,\nis not worth naming.\nAs he takes thus a daily View of all the Cir\ncle, and an hourly View of the Parts, he is fully\nMafter of all Tranfaftions, at leaft fuch as are\ndone above Board by all Mankind j and then he\ndifpatches his Emiffaries or Aid du Camps to every\nPart with his Orders and Inftruftions : Nowthefe\nEmiflaries, you are to underftand, are not the\nWitch*\n\fof the DEVIL. 555\nWitches and Diviners, who I\nfpoke of above, for\nI call them allb Emiflaries 5 but they are all\nDevils or (as you know they are call cl) Devil s\nAngels 5 and theie may, perhaps, come and con-\nverfe\nperfonally with the Sub-em ifTaries I men-\ntion d,to be ready for their\nSupport and Affiftance\non all Occafions of Bufinefs: Thefe are thofc De\nvils which the Witches are faid to raifej for we\ncan hardly fuppofe the Matter Devil comes him-\nfelf, at the Summons of every ugly old Woman.\nThefe run about into\nevery Nook and Corner,\nwherever Satan s Bufinefs calls them, and are\nnever wanting to him -,\nbut are the moil diligent:\nDevih imaginable 5 like the Turkijh Chaiux, they\nno fooner receive their Errand, but they execute\nit with the utmoft Alacrity ; and as to their\nSpeed,\nit\nmay be truly written as a Motto, upon the\nHead of every individual Devil,\nNon indiget calcarlbus.\nThefe are thofe, who they tell us our Witches,\nSorcerers, Wizards, and fuch Sorts of Folks con-\nverfe freely with, and are therefore call d their\nFamiliarS y and as\nthey tell us, come to them in\nhuman Shapes, talk to theift with articulate plain\nVoices, as if Men, and that yet the faid Witches,\n&fr. know them to be Devils.\nHiftory has not yet enlighten d us in this Part\nof ufeful\nKnowledge, or at lean: not fufficiently\nfor a Defcription of the Perfons or Habits of\nthefe Sorts of Appearances 5 as what Shapes they\ntake up, what Language they fpeak, and what\nparticular Works they perform, fo we mutt re\nfer k to farther Enquiry; but if we may cre\ndit\nHiftory, we are told many famous Stones of\nthefe\nAppearances 5 for Example, the famous\nMother Lakland^ who was burnt for a Witch\nA a & at\n\f35* The Modern HISTORY\nat Ipfwicb) Anno 164(5, confefTed at the Time of\nher Execution, or a little before it, that ihe had\nfrequent Converfation with the Devil himfelf j\nthat ihe being very poor, and withal of a devi-\nlifhpaflionate, cruel and revengeful Difpofition be\nfore, ufed to wiih fhe had it in her Power to do\nftich and fuch mifchievous Things to fome that\nfhe hated j and that the Devil himfelf, who, it\nfeems, knew her Temper, came to her one\nNight\nas ihe lay in her Bed$ and was between fleeping\nand waking, and fpeaking in a deep hollow\nVoice, told her j if ihe would ferve him in fome\nThings he would employ her to do, ihe ihould\nhave her Will of all her Enemies, and fhould\nwant for nothing: That ihe was much afraid at\nfirftj but that he folliciting her very often, bad\nher not be afraid of him, and ftill\nurg d her to\nyield, and as ihe fays, ftruck his Claw into her\nHand, and tho it did not hurt her, made it bleed,\nand with the Blood wrote the Covenants, that is\nto fay, the Bargain between them :\nbeing ask d\nwhat was in them, and whether he required her\nto curfe or deny God or Chrift ? She faid no.\nN. B. I do not find ihe told them whether\nthe Devil wrote it with a Pen, or whether\non Paper or Parchment, nor whether ihe\nfign d it or no, but it feems he carry d it a-\nway with him. I\nfuppofe, if Satan s Re-\ngifter were examin d, it\nmight be found a-\nmong the Archives of Hell, the Rolls of his\naffa PuUlca ; and when his Hiffcoriographer\nRoyal publiflies them, we may look for it\namong them.\nThen he furniih d her with three Z)w;7r,to wait\nUpon her (I fuppofe) for ihe confefs d they were\nto be employ d in her Service &amp;gt;\nthey attended in\nthe Shapes of two little Dogs and a Mole: The\n3\nfirft\n\fof the DEVIL: $$?\nfirft flie bewitched was her own Husband, by\nwhich he lay a while in great Mifery and died j\nthen fhe fent to one Captain Beal and burnt a\nnew Ship of his juft built, which had never been\nat Sea 5 thefe and many other horrid Things fhe\ndid and confefs d, and having been twenty Years\na Witch, at lafl the Devil left her, and fhe was\nburnt as fhe deferv d.\nThat fome extraordinary Occafions may bring\nthefe Agents of the Devil, nay, fometimes the\nDevil himfelf, to afTume human Shapes, and ap\npear to other People we cannot doubt &amp;gt;\nhe did thus\nin the Cafe of our Saviour as a fempter^ and fome\nthink he did fo to Manaffes as a Familiar, who\nthe Scripture charges with Sorcery, and having a\nFamiliar or Devil &amp;gt;\nFame tells us that St. Dunflan\nfrequently convcrft with him, and finally, took\nhim by the Nofe , and fo of others.\nBut in thefe modern Ages of the World, he\nfinds it much more to his Purpofe to work under\nGround as I have obferv d, and to keep upon\nthe Rcfervej fo that we have no authentick Ac\ncounts of his perfonal Appearance, but what are\nvery antient or very remote from our Faith, as\nwell as our Enquiry.\nIt feems to be a Queflion that would bear fome\ndebating, whether all\nApparitions are not Devils\nor from the Devil j but there being fo many of\nthofe Apparitions which we call Spirits, which\nreally aflame Shapes and make Appearances in\nthe World, upon fuch Accounts as we know\nSatan himfelf (corns to be employed in, that I\nmufl difmifs the Queftion in favour of the Devil}\nafTuring them, that as he never willingly did any\nfood\nin his Life, fo he would be far from giving\nimfelf the Trouble of fettihg one Foot into the\nWorld, on fuch an Errand; and for that Reafon\nwe maybe aflur d thofe certain Apparitions, which\nA a 3 we\n\f358 The Modern HIST DRY\nwe are told came to detect a Murther in Gkucejter-\nJbire,\nand others who appear d to prevent the ru\nining an Orphan for want of finding a Deed, that\nwas not loft, was certainly fome other Power equal\nly concerned, and riot the Devil*\nOn the other Hand, neither will it follow that\nSatan never appears in human Shape 5 for tho\nevery Apparition may no* be the Devil, yet it\ndoes not follow that the Devil never makes an\nApparition : All I {hall fay to it is, as I have men-\nt ion d before, that generally fpeaking, the Devil\nfinds it. more for his Purpofe, to have his Tntereft\nIn the World propagated another Way &amp;gt;\nnamely,\nin private, and his peribnal Appearances are re-\nferv d for Things only of extraordinary Confe-\nquence, and, as I may fay, of evident Neceffity,\nwhere his Honour is conccViVd, and where his Inte\nl-eft could be carried on no other Way 5 not for\ngetting\nto take Notice that this is\nvery feldom.\nIt remains to enquire, what then thofe Things\nare which we make fo much ftir about, and\nwhich are call d Apparitions, or Spirits afiiim-\ning human Shapes, and {hewing themfelves to\nPeople on particular Occafions? whether they are\nevil Spirits or good ? and tho , indeed, this is out\npf my Way at this Time, and does not relate at\nall to the DeviFs Hiftory, yet I thought it not\namifs to mention it , (i.) Becaqfe^ as I have (aid,\n1 do not wholly exclude Satan from all Concern\nin fuch Things j and (i.) Becaufe-4-{hall difmifs\nthe Quellion with fo very fhort an Anfwerj\nnamely, that we may determine which are and\nwhich.are not the Devil s, by the Errand they come\nupon 5 every one to his own Bufmefs; if it comes\nof a good Errand, you may certainly acquit the\nijDtatf\/\nof it, conclude him innocent, and that he\nhas no hand in it 5 if it comes of a wicked and\ndeviliih Errand, you may e en take him up upon\nSu(picion?\n\fof the D E VI L: 359\nSufpicion, tis ten to one but you find him at the\nBottom of it.\nNext to Apparitions, we find Mankind difturb d\nby abundance of little odd referv d Ways which\nthe Devil is\nfhrewdly fufpefted of having a Hand\nin, fuch as Drearns, Nozfes, Voices&amp;gt;\n8cc. fmells of\nBrimftone, Candles burning blue, and the like.\nAs to Dreams, I have nothing to fay in Satan s\nPrejudice at all there &amp;gt;\nI make no Queftion but\nhe deals very much in that Kind of Intelligence,\nand why fhould he not ? we know Heaven it felf\nformerly converft very often with the greater! of\nAden, by the fame Method, and the Devil is\nknown to mimick the Methods, as well as the\nActions of his Maker &amp;gt;\nwhether Heaven has not\nquite left off that Way of working, we are\nnot certain &amp;gt;\nbut we pretty well know the Devil\nhas not left it, and I believe fome Inftances may\nbe given where his Worfhip has been really feen\nand talk d to in fleep, as much as if the Pcrfon\nhad been awake with his Eyes open.\nThefe are to be diftinguifh d too, pretty much\nby the Goodnefs or Badnefs of the Subject\n-\ny how\noften have Men committed Murther, Robbery\nand Adultery in a Dream, and at the fame time\nexcept an extraordinary Agitation of the Soul,\nand exprefs d by extraordinary Noifes in the\nSleep, by violent Sweating and other fuch Ways,\nthe Head has never been remov d from the Pillow,\nor the Body fo much as turn d in the Bed ?\nWhether in fuch Cafes, the Soul with all the\nPaffions and Affections being agitated,\nand giving\ntheir full affent to the Facts, of whatever Kind\nfoever, the Man is not as guilty as if the Sins fo\ndream d of his committing, had been actually\ncommitted ? tho it be no Doubt to me, but that\nit is fo, yet as it is foreign to the prefent Affair,\nuncj not at all relating to the Devil s Hiftory5\nI\nA a .\n\f166 The Modern HISTORY\nleave it to the Reverend Doftors of the Church,\nas\nproperly belonging to them to decide.\nI knew a Perfon who the Devil fo haunted\nwith naked Women, fine beautiful Ladies in\nBed with him, and Ladies of his Acquaintance\ntoo, offering their Favours to him, and all in hi$\nSleep 3 fo that he feldom flept without fome fuch\nEntertainment 3 the Particulars are too grofs for\nmy Story, but he gave me feveral long Accounts\nof his Night s Amours^ and being a Man of a\nvirtuous Life and good Morals, it was the great-\neft Surprize to him imaginable 3 for you cannot\ndoubt but that the cunning Devil made every\nthing be a&amp;lt;5bed to the Life with him, and in a\nmanner the moft wicked 3 he own d with Grief to\nme, that the very firft Attack the Devil made upon\nhim, was with a very beautiful Lady ofhis Acquain\ntance, who he had been really fomething freer than\nordinary with in their common Converfation *\nThis Lady he brought to him in a Pofture for\nWickednefs, and wrought up his Inclination fo\nhigh in his Sleep, that he, as he thought, a6tu~\nally went about to debauch her, {he not at all\nrefitting 3 but that he wak d in the very Moment^\np his particular Satisfaction.\nHe was greatly concerned at this Part, namely,\nthat he really gave the Confent of his Will to the\nFaci, and wanted to know if he was not as guilty\nof Adultery, as if he had lain with her 3 indeed he\ndecided the Queftion againft himfelf, fo forcibly,\nthat I, who was of the fame Opinion before, had\nnothing to fay againft it 3 however, I confirmed\nfairn in it, by asking him thefe Queftions.\n$. Whether he did not think the Devil had\nthe chief Hand in fuch a Dream? he an-\nfwer d, it could certainly be no body elfr?\nij;\nmud be thejpwi\/.\nZ.I\n\fof the DEVIL:\n2. I then ask d him what Reafon the Devil\ncould have for it, if his Confent to the Fa6b\nin Sleep had not been criminal ? That s true\nindeed^ fays he, \/ am anfwer d : But then he\nask d another Queflion, which, I confefs, is\nnot fo eafy to anfwer, namely, How he fhould\nprevent being ferv d fo\nagain.\nNor could all\nmy Divinity or his own keep the\nDevil from attacking him again 5 on the other\nHand, as I have faid, he worried him to that De\ngree, that he injur d his Health, bringing naked\nWomen to him, fometimes one, fometimes ano\nther, fometimes in one Poflure of Lewdnefs, fome\ntimes in another, fometimes into his very Arms,\nfometimes with fuch Additions as I am not mer\nry enough, and fometimes fuch as I am not wick\ned enough to put into your Heads 3 the Man,\nindeed, could not help it, and fo the Devil was\nmore Faulty than he j but as I hinted to him, he\nmight bring his Mind to fuch a ftated Habit of\nVirtue, as to prevent its\naflenting to any wick\ned Motion, even in Sleep, and that would be\nthe Way to put an End to the Attempt; and this\nAdvice he reliftfd very well, and pra&ifed, I be\nlieve, with Succefs.\ny this fame Method, the fame Devil injects\npowerful Incentives to other Crimes, provokes\nAvarice, by laying a great Quantity of Gold in\nyour View, and no body prefcnt, giving you an\nOpportunity to fteal it, or fome of it, at the fame\ntime, perhaps, knowing your\nCircumflances to\nbe fuch as that you are at that Time in a great\nwant of the Money.\nI knew another, who being a Tradefman, and\nin great Diftrefs for Money in his Bufinefs,\ndrcam d that he was walking all alone in a great\nWood?\nand that he met a little Child with a Bag\nof Gold in its Hand, and a fine Necklace of\nDiamonds\n\f36i The Modern HISTORY\nDiamonds on its Neck, upon the Sight, his\nWants prefently dictated to him to rob the Child 5\nthe little innocent Creature, (juft fo he dream d)\nnot being able to refift j or to tell who it was, ac\ncordingly he confented to take the Money from\nthe Child, and then to take the Diamond Neck\nlace from it too, and did fo.\nBut the Devil) (a full\nTeflimony, as I told him,\nthat it was the Devil, not contented with that,\nhinted to him, that perhaps the Child might fome\ntime or other know him, and {Ingle him out, by\ncrying or pointing, or fome fuch Thing, efpeci-\nally if he was fufpe&ed and ihew d to it, and\ntherefore it would be better for him to kill the\nChild, prompting him to kill it for his own\nSafety, and that he need do no more but twift\nthe Neck of it a little, or crufli it with his Knee 5\nHe told me he flood debating with himfelf, whe\nther he ftiould do fo or not &amp;gt;\nbut that in that In-\nilant his Heart {truck him with the Word Mur-\nther, and he entertain d a Horror of it, refus d to\ndo it, and immediately waked.\nHe told me, that when he wak d, he found\nhimfelf in fo violent a Sweat as he never had\nknown the like 5 that his Pulfe beat with that\nHeat and Rage, that it was like a Palpitation of\nthe Heart to him, and that the Agitation of his\nSpirits was fuch, that he was not fully compo\nled in fome Hours $ tho the Satisfaction and Joy\nthat attended him, when he found it was but a\nDream, affifted much to return his Spirits to\ntheir due Temperament.\nIt is neither my Bufinefs or Inclination to turn\nDivine here, nor is the Age I write to Effici\nently Grave to relifti a Sermon, if I was difpofed\nto preach, though they muft allow the Subject\nwould very well bear it j but I {hall only ask\nif\nthey think this is not the Devil, what\nthey\n\ftftbe DEVIL;\nthey think it is ? If they believe it is the Devil9\nthey will ab accordingly I hope, or let it\nalone,\nas Satan and they can agree about it.\nI fhould not oblige the Devil over much, what\never I might do to thofe that read it j if I\nfhould enter here upon a Debate of Interefts,\n(viz.) to enquire whether the Devil has not a\nvail Advantage upon Mankind this\nWay, and\nwhether it is not much his Intereft to preferve it $\nand if I prove the Affirmative, I leave it to you\nto enquire whofe Intereft it is to difappoint and\niiipplant him.\nIn fhort, I take Dreams to be the fecond Beft\nof the Advantages the Devil has over Mankind 5\nthe fir ft, I fuppofe, you all know (viz.) the\nTreachery of the Garrifon within ; by Dreams\nhe may be faid to get into the Infide of us with\nout Oppofition 5 here he opens and locks with\nout a Key, and like an Enemy laying fiege to a\nfortified City, Reafon and Nature, the Governor\nof the City, keep him out by Day, and keep\nthe Garrifon true to their Duty 5 but in the Dark\nhe gets in and parlees with the Garrifon (the Af-\nfe&ions and Paffions) Debauches their Loyalty,\nflirring up them to Difloyalty and Rebellion, fo\nthey betray their Truft, Revolt, Mutiny, and go\nover to the Befieger.\nThus he manages his Intereft, I fay, and infi-\nnuates himfelf into the Infide of us, without our\nConfent, nay, without our Knowledge &amp;gt;\nfor\nwhatever Speculation may do, tis evident De-\nmonflration does not affift us to difcover which\nWay he gets Accefs to the Soul, while the Or\ngan tied up, and dozed with Sleep has lock d it\nup from A6tion$ that it is fo is clear, but how\nhe does it is a Secret which I do not find the\nAntients or Moderns have yet made a Difcovery of.\nThat;\n\fThe Modern HISTORY\nThat Devil of a Creature, Mother\nwhofe Story I mentioned above, acknowledged\nthat the firft Time the Devil attempted to draw\nher in to be a Witch was in a Dream, and even\nwhen {he confented, {he faid, {he was between\nfleeping and waking 5 that is, Hie did not know\nwhether flie was awake or afleep, and the cun\nning Devil it feems was fatisfied with her Aflent\ngiven fo, when {he was afleep, or neither afleep\nor awake, fo taking the Advantage of her Inca\npacity to a&amp;lt;5b\nrationally.\nThe Stories of her bewitching feveral People,\nand the manner in which they died, are fo formi\ndable and extravagant, that I care not to put any\none s Faith to the ftretch about them, tho pub-\nlilh d by Authority, and teftified by Abundance\nof Witnefles ; but this is recorded in particular, and\nto my Purpofe, whether from her own Mouth or\nnot, I do not fay, namely, the Defcription of a\nWitch, and the Difference between Witches,\nand thofe other of Satan s\nAcquaintance who aft\nin his Name,\n1. They have confulted and covenanted with a\nSpirit or Devil.\n2. They have a Deputy Devil^ fometimes feve\nral to (erve and afliit them.\n3. Thefe they employ as they pleafe, call them\nby Name, and command their\nAppearance in\nwhatever Shape they think fit.\n4. They fend them abroad to or into the Per-\nfons who they defign to bewitch, who they\nalways torment, and often murther them, as\nMother Lakland did feveral.\nAs to the Difference between the feveral De\nvils that appear, it relates to the Office of the\nPerfons who employ thqm j as Conjurers, who\nfeem\n\fdf the t) E V I L:\nfcern to command the particular Devil that waits\nupon them with more Authority, and raife them\nand lay them at Pleafure, drawing Circles, cafting\nFigures, and the like ; but the Witch, in a more\nfamiliar manner, whifpers with the Devil, keeps\nthe Devil in a Bag or a Sack, fometimes in her\nPocket, and the like, and like Mr. Faux fhews\nTricks with him.\nBut all thefe Kinds deal much in Dreams, talk\nwith the Devil in their Sleep, and make other\nPeople talk with him in their Sleep too ; and tis\non this Occafion I mention it here ; in fhort, the\nDevil may well take this Opportunity with Man\nkind, for not half the World that came into his\nMeafures would comply, if they were awake j\nbut of that hereafter.\nAnd yet his thus insinuating himfelf by Dream,\ndoes not feem fufficient, in my Opinion, toanfwer\nthe Devil s End, and to carry on his Bufinefs j and\ntherefore we muft be forced to allow him a Kind\nof actual PofTeflion, in particular Cafe?, and that\nin the Souls of fome People, by different Methods\nfrom others 5 Luther is of the Opinion that\nthe Devil gets a Familiarity with fome Souls\njuft at, or rather before their being embodied 5\nas to the Manner and Method how he gets in,\nthat is another Qucftion, and may be fpoken of\nby it felf j befides, why may not he, that at\nSatan s\nRequeft to enter into the Herd of Swine,\nfaid 0, give the fame Commiflion to poilefs a\nfort of Creatures fo many Degrees below the\nDignity of the Gaderenian Swine, and open the\nDoor too ? but as for that, when our Lord faid\ng0, the Devil never enquired which Way he ihould\nget in.\nWhen then I fee Nations, or indeed Herds of\nNations fet on Fire of Hell, and as I may fay,\nenflam d by the Devil \\ when I fee Towns, Par-\ntics\n\f3 66 The Modern HIST O.R Y\nties, Fa&ions and Rabbles of People vifibly pof-\nfefs d &amp;gt;\ntis\nenough to me that the great Matter of\nthe Devils has faid to him, GO&amp;gt;\nthere s no need to\nenquire which Way he finds open, or at what\npoitern Gate he gets in j as to his appearing,\ntis\nplain he often gets in without appearing, and\ntherefore the Queftion about his appearing ftill\nremains a Doubt, and is not very eafy to be re-\nfolv d.\nIn the Scripture we have fome Light into it,\nand that is all the Help I find from Antiquity^\nand it\ngoes a great Way to folve the Phenomena of\nSatan s\nappearing $ what I mean by the Scripture\ngiving fome Light to it, is this &amp;gt;\ntis faid in feve-\nral Places, and of feveral Perfons, God came to\nthem in a Dream, Gen. xx. j.\nGod came to Abi-\nmejcch in a Dream by Night^ Gen. xxxi. 14. And\nGod came to Laban the Syrian in a Dream^ Matt,\nii.\n13. The Angel of the Lord appeared to\nJofeph\nin a Dream-, fhort Comments are fufficient to\nplain Texts, applying this to my Friend when he\nwanted to be facisfied about the How, relating\nto his Dream (viz.) how he fhould come to Dream\nfuch wicked Things? J told him, in fhort, the\nCafe was plain, the Devil came to him in a Dream\ntry Night : How and in what manner he form d\nthe wicked Reprefentations, and fpread debaucrTd\nAppearances before his Fancy, by real Whifpers\nand Voice, according to Milton, or by what other\nMethods, the Learned are not arriv d to any Cer\ntainty about it.\nThis leads me neceflarily to enquire whether\nthe Devil or fome of his Agents are not always\nin our Company, whether they make any vifible\nAppearances or no ? For my Part I make no Que\nflion of it, how elie could he come at the Know\nledge of what we do j for as I can allow him no\nPrcfcience at all, as for many Reafons I have ob-\nj f j\nfervd\n\f*f tt&amp;gt;e DEVIL:\nferv d already, he mufl be able to fee and know\nus, and what we are about when we know\nnothing of him, or elfe he could know nothing of\nus and our Affairs ,\nwhich yet we find otherwife $\nand this gives him infinite Advantage to Influ\nence our Actions, to judge of our Inclinations,\nand to bring our Paffions to clafh with our Rea-\nfon, as they often do, and get the better of it too.\nAll this he obtains by his being able to walk\nabout invisible, and fee when he is not feen, of\nwhich I have fpoken already j hence that moil\nwife and folid Suggestion, that when the Candles\nburn blue the Devil is in the Room, which\ngreat Secret in Nature, that you may more fully\nbe convinc d of its\nimaginary Reality, I muft tell\nyou the following Story which I faw in a Letter\ndirected to a particular Friend, take it Word for\nWord as in the Letter j becaufe I do not make\nmy felf accountable for the Fads, but take them\nad referendum.\nSIR,\nWE had one Day, very early in the Morn\ning, and for the moil Part of the Day a\ngreat deal of Rain with a high Wind, and the\nClouds very thick and dark all Day.\nIn the Evening the cloudy thick Weather con\ntinued, tho not the Rain, when being at a Friend s\nHoufe in Lane London^ and feveral Ladies\nand fome Gentlemen in the Room, belides two\nor three Servants (for we had been eating) the fol\nlowing Interlude happen d for our Entertainment :\nWhen the Cloth was taken away, two large Can\ndles were brought upon the Table and plac d\nthere with fome Bottles and GlafTes for the Gen\ntlemen, who, it feems, were intending to drink\nand be very merry j two large Wax-Candles were\na alfo\n\f5 68 The MotternHIS TORY\nalfo fet on another Table, the Ladies being going\nto Cards, alfo there were two large Candles in\nSconces over or near the Chimney, and one more\nin a Looking-Glafs Sconce, on a Peer by the\nWindow.\nWith all this Apparatus^ the Company feparat-\ning fat down, the Gentlemen at their Table, and\nthe Ladies at theirs, to play as above; when after\nfome time the Gentleman of the Houfe faid ha-\nflily to a Servant, what a P ails the Candles ?\nand turning to the Servant raps out an Oath or\ntwo, and bids him fnitff the Candles^ for they\nburnt as if the Devil was in the Room.\nThe Fellow going to fnurF one of the Candles,\n(huffs it out, at which his Mafter\nbeing in a Paf-\nfion the Fellow lights it\nagain immediately at the\nother Candle, and then being in a little\nhurrfr,\ngoing to fnurF the other Candle fnuffed that out\ntoo.\nThe firft Candle that was relighted (as is ufual\nin fuch Cafes) burn d dim and dull for a good\nwhile, and the other being out, the Room was\nmuch darker than before, and a Wench that\nflood by the Ladies Table, bawls out to her Mif-\ntrefs, Law Madam! the Candles burn blue; an\nold Lady that fat by fays, ay Betty ! fo they do j\nupon this one of the Ladies flans up, Mercy upon\nus, fays flie, what is the Matter! In this unlucky\nMoment another Servant, without Orders, went\nto the great Peer Sconce, and becaufe, as he\nthought, he would be fure to fnuff the Candle\nwell, he offers to take it down, but very unhap\npily, I fay, the Hook came out and down falls the\nSconce Candle and all, and the Looking-Glafs\nbroke all to pieces, with a horrible Noifej how\never, the Candle falling out of the Sconce\ndid not go out, but lay on the Floor burning\ndully, and as it is ufual on fuch Cafes, all on one\nSide,\n\fof the DEVIL: 369\nSide, Betty cries out again. Law Madam^ that\nCandle burns blue too j the very Moment fhe\nfaid -this, the Footman that had thrown down\nthe Sconce, fays to his fellow Servant, that came\nto his Affiftance, I think the Devil is in the Candles\nto Night, and away he run out of the Room, for\nfear of his Mailer.\nThe old Lady, who, upon the Maid Betty s\nNotion of the Candles burning blue, had her\nHead jiift\nfull of that old Chimney-Corner Story ,\nthe Candles burn blue when the Spirits are in the\nRoom, heard the Footman fay the Word Devil,\nbut heard nothing elfe of what he faid 5 upon this\nfhe rifes up in a terrible Fright, and cries out that\nthe Footman faid the Devil was in the Room 5 as\nfhe was$ indeed, frighted out of her Wits, fhe\nfrighted the Ladies moft terribly, and they all\nftarting up together, down goes the Card Table,\nand put the Wax- Candles out.\nMrs. Betty^ that had frighted them all, runs\nto the Sconce next the Chimney, but that hav\ning a long Snuff, fhe cried out it burnt blue too,\nand fhe durft not touch it\n-\ny in fhort, tho there\nwere three Candles left Hill\nburning in the Room,\nyet the Ladies were all fo frighted, that they and\nthe Maids too run out of the Parlour fcreaming\nlike mad Folks. The Matter in a Rage kick d\nhis firft Man out of the Room, and the fecond\nMan was run out to avoid, as I faid before, the\nlike, fo that no Servant was to be had, but all\nwas in Confufion.\nThe two other Gentlemen, who were fitting at\nthe firft Table, kept their Seats compofed and\ncafy enough, only concerned to fee all the Houfe\nin fuch a frights it was true, they faid, the Can\ndles burnt dim and very oddly, but they could\nhot perceive they burnt blue, except one of thofe\nover the Chimney, and that on the Table, which\nB b was\n\f370 The Modern HISTORY\nwas relighted after the Fellow had frmfFt it\nout.\nHowever, the Maid, the old Lady and the\nFootman that pull d down the Sconce, all infill\nthat the Candles burnt blue^ and all\npretend that\nthe Devil was certainly in the Room, and was the\nOccafion of it j and they now came to me with\nthe Story, to deiire my Opinion of it.\nThis put me upon Enquiry into the Notion\nof Candles burning blue when Spirits are in a\nRoom, which upon all the Search into\nThings,\nthat I am able to make, amounts to no more than\nthisj that upon any extraordinary Emiffion of\nfulphureous or of nitrous Particles, either in a clofe\nRoom, or in any not very open Place, if the\nQuantity be great, a Candle or Lamp, or any\nfuch little Blaze of Fire will feem to be, or to\nburn blue j and if then they can prove that any\nfuch Effluvia attends or is emitted from a Spirit,\nthen when SATAN is at Hand it\nmay be fo.\nBut then tis\nbegging the Queftion grofsly, be-\ncaufe no Man can aflure us that the Devil has\nany fulphureous Particles about him.\nIt is\ntrue, the Candles burn thus in Mines and\nVaults, and damp Places ; and tis as true that\nthey will do fo upon Occafion of very damp,\nilormy and moift A&quot;*3 when an extraordinary\nQuantity of Vapours are fuppofed to be difpers d\nabroad, as was the Cafe when this\nhappen d j and if\nthere was any Thing of that in it on that Monday\nNight, the Candles might, perhaps, burn blue\nupon that Occafion 5 but that the Devil was\nabroad upon any extraordinary Bufinfes that Night,\nthat I cannot grant, unlefs I have fome better\nTefHmony than the old Lady that heard the Foot\nman s\nout-cry but by halves, or than Mrs. Betty^\nwho firft fancied the Candles burnt blue j fo I\nmuft fufpend my Judgment till I hear farther.\nThis\n\fof the DEVIL; 37l\nThis Story however may folve a great many of\nthofe Things which pafs for Apparitions in the\nWorld, and which are laid to the Devil s\nCharge,\ntho he really may know nothing of the Matter $\nand this would bring me to defend Satan in many\nThings, wherein he may truly be faid to fuffer\nwrongfully &amp;gt;\nand if I thought it would oblige\nhim, I might fay fomething to his Advantage\nthis Way j however, Til venture a Word or\ntwo for an injur d Devil^ take it as you will.\nFirft, it is\ncertain, that as thislnviiibility of the\nDevil is very much to our Prejudice, fo the Doc\ntrine of his Vifibility is a great Prejudice to him,\nas we make Ufe of it.\nBy his Invifibility he is\ncertainly vefted with\ninfinite Advantages againft us -,\nwhile he can be\nprefent with us, and we know nothing of the\nMatter, he informs himfelf of all our Mcafures,\nand arms himfelf in the beft and moft fuitable\nmanner to injure and aflault us, as he can counter\nact all our fecret concerted Defigns, difappoint all\nour Schemes, and except when Heaven apparent\nly concerns it felf to over-rule him, can defeat all\nour Enterprises, break all our Meafures, and do\nus Mifchief in almoft every Part of our Life, and\nall this, becaufe we are not privy to all his Mo\ntions, as he is to ours.\nBut now for his Vifibility and his real Appear\nance in the World, and particularly among his\nDifciples and Emiflaries, fuch as Witches and\nWizards, Demonaifts, and the like :\nHere, I think\nSatan has a great deal of Lofs, fuffers manifeft\nInjury, and has great Injuftice done him $ and,\nthat therefore I ought to clear this Matter up a\nlittle, if it be poffible, to do Juftice to Satan, and\nfet Matters right in the World about him, accord\ning to that ufeful old Maxim of fetting the Saddle\nupon the right Horfe, or giving the Devil his due.\nB b i Pirft,\n\fThe Modem H I S f O R Y\nFirft, as I have faid) we are not to believe\nevery idle Head, who pretends even to converfc\nFace to Face with the Devil) and who tells us,\nthey have thus feen him, and been acquainted\nwith him- every Day :\nMany of thefe Pretenders\nare imnifeft Cheats 5 and, however, they would\nhave the Honour of a private Interest in him, and\nboaft how they have him at their Beck, can call\nhim this Way, and fend him that, as they pleafe,\nraife him and lay him when and how, and as often\nas they find for their Purpofe 5 I fay, whatever\nBoafls they make of this Kind, they really have\nnothing of Truth in them.\nNow the Injuries and Injufticedone to theZV*\nvil) in thefe Cafes, are manifeft j namely, that\nthey entitle the Devil to all the Mifchief they\nare pleated to do in the World 5-\nand if they\ncommit a Murther or a Robbery, fire a Houfe,\nor do any A6b of Violence in the World, they\nprciently&quot;\nare laid to do it\nby the Agency of theZ&amp;gt;^\nvi!) and the Devil helps them &amp;gt;\nfo Satan bears the\nReproach, and they have all the Guilts this is,\n(i.) a grand Cheat upon the World, and (2.) a\nnotorious Slander upon the Devil &amp;gt;\nand it would\nbe a public Benefit to Mankind, to have fuch would-\nbe-Devils as thefe turn d infide out, that we might\nknow when the Devil was really at work among\nus, and when not ; what Mifchiefs were of his\ndoing, and which were not 5 and that thefe Fel\nlows might not flip their Necks out of the Hal\nter, by continually laying the Blame of their\nWickednefs upon the Devil.\nNot that the Devil is not very willing to have\nhis Hand in any Mifchkf, or in all the Mifchief\nthat rs done in the World -\n9 but there are fomelow\npriz d Rogueries that are too little for him, be\nneath the Dignity of his Operation, and which\ntis\nreally a Scandal to the Devil to charge upon\nhim*\n\fof the DEVIL: 37$\nturn. I remember the Devil had fuch a Cheat\nput upon him in Eaft-Smithfield once, where a\nPerfon pretended to converfe with the Devil Face\nto Face, and that in\nopen Day too, and to\ncaufe him to tell Fortunes, foretel Good and\nEvil, &c. dilcover ftollen Goods, tell where\nthey were who Hole them, and how to find\nthem again, nay, and even to find out the Thieves j\nbut Satan was really flandered in the Cafe, the\nFellow had no more to do with the Devil than\nother People, and perhaps not fo much neither:\nThis was one of thofe they call d CUNNING-MEN,\nor at leaft he endeavoured to pafs for fuch a one?\nbut twas all a Cheat.\nBefides, what had the Demi to do to deteel:\nThieves, and reflore ftollen Goods? Thieving and\nRobbing, Trick and Cheat, are part of the Craft\nof his Agency, and of the Employments which it\nie hi$ Buiinefs to encourage; they greatly miftake\nhim, who think he will arlift\nany Body in fup-\npreffing and detecting iiich laudable Arts and fuch\ndiligent Servants.\nI won t\nfay, but the Devi!, to draw thefe Peo*\npie we call Cunning-Men, into a Snare, and to\npufh on his farther Defigns, may encourage them\nprivately, and in a manner that they themfclves\nknow nothing of, to make ufe of his Name, and\nabufe the World about him, till at laft they may\nreally believe they do deal with the Devil, when\nindeed tis\nonly he deals with them, and they know-\nnothing of the Matter.\nIn other Cafes he may encourage them in thefe\nlittle Frauds and Cheats, and give them leave,,\nas above, to make ufe of his Name to bring\nthem afterwards, and by Degrees to have a real\nAcquaintance with him ; fo bringing the Jeft of\ntheir Trade into Earnefr,, till at length prompt\ning them to commit fome great Villany, he fe-\nB b 5 cures\n\f374 The Modern HISTORY\ncures them to be his own, by their very Fear of\nhis leaving them to be expofed to the World j\nthus he puts a Jonathan Wild upon them, and\nmakes them be the very Wretches they only pre\ntended to be before : So old Parfons of Clithroe,\nas Fame tells, was twenty five Years a Cunning-man^\nand twenty two Years a Witch &amp;gt;\nthat is to lay, for\nfive and twenty Years, he was only pretending to\ndeal with the Devil^ when Satan and he had no\nmanner of Acquaintance^ and he only put his\nLegcr-de-wain upon the People in the Devil s\nName, without his leave j but at length the\nDevil s Patience being tir d quite out, he told\nthe old Counterfeit, that in fhort, he had been\nhis ilalking Horfe long enough, and that now, if\nhe thought fit to enter himfelf, and take a Com-\nmifHon, well and good 3 and he mould have a\nLeafe to carry on his Trade for fo many Years\nmore, to his Heart s content 5 but if not, he\nwould expofe his\nKnavery to the World, for that\nhe mould take away his Peoples Trade no lon\nger ^ but that he (Satan) would fet up another in\nhis Room, that mould make a meer Fool of him,\nand carry away all his Cuftomers.\nUpon this, the old Man confider d of it, took\nthe Devil s\nCounfel, and lifted in his Pay -,\nfo\nhe, that had plaid his Pranks twenty five Years\nas a\nConjurer, when he was no Conjurer, was\nthen forc d really to deal with the DEVIL, for\nfear the People mould know he did not : Till now\nhe had ambo dexter^ cheated the Devil on one\nHand, and the People on the other 5 but the De\nvil gain d his Point at lafl, and fo he was a real\nWizard ever after.\nBut this is not the only way the Devil is in-\njur d neither, for we have often found People\npretend upon him in other Cafes, and of nearer\n.\nConcern to him a great deal, and in Articles more\nz Wcightyj\n\fof the DEVIL;\nWeighty, as in particular, in the great Bufinefs\nof PofTeilion 5 it is true this Point is not thoro ly\nunderflood among Men, neither has the Devil\nthought fit to give us thofc Illuminations about\nit, as I believe he might do&amp;gt;\nparticularly that\nfeat\nand important Article, is\nnot, for ought\ncan fee, rightly explained, namely j whether\nthere arc not two feveral Kinds of PoflefTion,\n(viz.) fome wherein the Devil poflefTes us, and\nfome in which we really poflefs the Devil 5 the\nNicety of which I doubt this Age, with all its\nPenetration, is not qualified to explain, and a Dif-\nfertation upon it\nbeing too long for this Work,\nefpecially fo near its Conclufion, I am obHg^i to\nomit, as I am alfo all the practical Difcourfes up\non the Ufefulnefs and Advantages of real Poflef-\nfion, whether confider d one Way or other to\nMankind, all which I muft leave to hereafter.\nBut to come back to the Point in Hand, and\nto confider the Injuftice done to the Devil, in\nthe various Turns and Tricks which Men put up\non him very often in this one Article (viz.) pretend\ning to Pofleflion, and to have the Devil in them,\nwhen really it is not fo$ certainly the Devil mufl\ntake it\nvery ill, to have all their demented, luna-\ntick Tricks charg d upon him 5 fome of which,\nnay, moft of which are fo grofs, fo fimple, fo\nempty, and fo little to thePurpofe, that the Devil\nmuft be aiham d to fee fuch Things pafs in his\nName, or that the World Ihould think he was\nconcern d in them.\nIt is true, that Pofleffion being one of the\nprincipal Pieces of the Devil s Artifice in his\nmanaging Mankind, and in which, with the moflr\nexquifite\nskill he plays the Devil among us, he\nhas the more Reafon to be affronted when he\nfinds himfelf invaded in this Part, and angry that\nany Body fhould pretend to poflefs, or be poflefs\nd\nB b 4 without\n\f57&amp;lt;5\nThe Modern H 1 S T Q R Y\nwithout his leave ,\nand this may be the Reafon\nfor ought we know, why fo\nmany Blunders have\nbeen made, when People have pretended to it\nwithout him, and he lias thought fit not to\nown them in it 3 of which we have many Ex\namples in Hiftory, as in Simon Magus^ the Devil\nof London, the fair Maid of Kent, and feyeral\nothers, whofe Hiftory it is not worth while to\nenlarge upon.\nIn ihort, Pofieffions, as I have faid, are nice\nThings, as it is not fo eafy to mimick the Devil\nin that Part, as it\nmay be in fome other &amp;gt;\ndefign-\ning Men have attempted it\noften, but their man\nner has been cafily diiiinguifh d, even without the\nDevil s Afliftance.\nThus the People of Salem in New-England\npretended to be bewitch d, and that a black Man\ntormented them by the Inftigation of fuch and\nfuch, whom they refoly d to bring to the Gal\nlows : This black Man they would have be the\nDevil) employed by the Perfon who they acciis d\nfor a Witch : Thus making the Devil a Page or\na Footman to the Wizard, to go and torment\nwhoever the faid Wizard commanded, till the\nDevil himfclf was fo weary of the foolifh Part,\nthat he left them to go on their own Way, and\nat laft they over-acted the\nmurthering Part fo far,\nthat when they con fefs d themfelves to be Witches^\nand poflefs d, and that they had Correfpondence\nwith the Devil, Satan not appearing to vouch\nfor them, no Jury would condemn them upon\ntheir own Evidence, arid they could not get\nthemfelves ha-ng d, whatever Pains they took to\nbring it to pafs.\n^Thus you fee the Devil may be wrong d, and\nfalfely accus d in many Particulars, and often\nhas been fo ; there are likewife fome other forts\nof counterfeit Devils in the World, fuch as Gyp-\n\fDEVIL; 377\nJf.es9 Fortune-Tellers^ Foretellers of good and bad\nLuck, Sellers of Winds, Raifers of Storms, and\nmany more, fome pra&is d among us, fome in\nforeign Parts, too many almoft to reckon up ;\nnay I almofl doubt whether the Devil himielf\nknows all the Sorts of them 5 for tis evident he\nhas little or nothing to do with them, I mean\nnot in the Way of their Craft.\nThefe I take to be Interlopers, or with the\nGuinea Merchants leave, feparate Traders, and\nwho act under the Skreen and Protection of Sa\ntan s Power, but without his Licenfe or Autho\nrity 5 no doubt thefe carry away a great deal of\nhis Trade, that is to fay, the Trade which other-\nwife trie Devil might have carried on by Agents\nof his own&amp;gt; I cannot but fay, that while thefe\nPeople would fain be thought Devils, tho they\nreally are not, it is but juft they ihould be real\nly made as much Devils as they pretended to be,\nor that Satan fhould do hitnfelf Juftice upon\nthem, as he threaten d to do upon old Parfons of\nClithroe abovemention d, and let the World know\nthem.\nCHAP. XL\nOf Divination, Sorcery, the Black-Art,\nTawawing, and fuch like ^Pretenders to\n&amp;lt;De&amp;lt;vilifm,\nand how far the Devil is or is\nnot concerned in them.\nTHO\nI am writing the Hiftory of the De\nvil,. I have not undertaken to do the like of\nall the Kinds of People, Male or Female, who\nfet up for Devils in the World : This would be\na Task for the Devil indeed, and fit\nonly for him\nto\n\f378 The Modern HISTORY\nto undertake, for their Number is and has been\nprodigious great, and may, with his other Legi\nons be rank d among the Innumerable.\nWhat a World do we inhabit ! where there is\nnot only with us a great Roaring-Lyon-Devil\ndaily feeking whom of us he may devour, and in\nnumerable Millions of letter Devils hovering in\nthe whole Atmofphere over us, nay, and for ought\nwe know, other Millions always invifibly moving\nabout us, and perhaps in us, or atleaftin many of\nus&amp;gt;\nbut that have, befides all\nthefe, a vaft\nmany\ncounterfeit Hocus Poms Devils; human Devils, who\nare vifible among us, of our own Species and Fra-\nternity,converiing with us upon all Occafions 5 who\nlike Mountebanks fet up their Stages in every\nTown, chat with us at every Tea-Table, converfe\nwith us in every Coffee- Houfe, and impudently\ntell us to our Faces that they are Devils, boaftof it,\nand ufe a thoufand Tricks and Arts to make us\nbelieve it too, and that too often with Succefs.\nIt muffc be confefs d there is a ftrong Propen-\nfity in Man s Nature, efpecially the more igno\nrant part of Mankind, to refolve every ftrange\nThing, or whether really flrange or no, if it be\nbut ftrange to us, into Devilifm, and to fay every\nThing is the Devil, that they can give no Ac\ncount of.\nThus the famous Doftors of the Faculty at\nPari^ when John Fauftus brought the firft\nprint\ned Books that had then been fcen in the World, or\nat leaft feen there, into the City, and fold them for\nManufcripts :\nThey were furpriz d at the Perform\nance, and queftion d Fauftus about it ; but he af\nfirming they were Manufcripts, and that he kept\na great many Clarks employed to write them, they\nwere fatisfied for a while.\nBut looking farther into the Work, they ob-\nferv d the exacb Agreement of every Book, one\nwith\n\fof the DEVIL. 379\nwith another, that every Line flood in the fame\nPlace, every Page a like Number of Lines, every\nLine a like Number of Words $ if a Word was\nmif-fpelt in one, it was mif-fpek alfo in all, nay,\nthat if there was a Blot in one, it was alike in\nallj they began again to mufe, how this fhould\nbe ? in a Word, the learned Divines not being able\nto comprehend the Thing (af^d that was always\nfufficient) concluded it muft be the Devil, that\nit was done by Magick and Witchcraft, and that\nin fhort, poor Fauftus (who was indeed nothing\nbut a meer Printer) dealt with the Devil.\nN. B. John Fauftus was Servant, or Journey\nman, or Compofitor, or what you pleafe to\ncall it, to Kofter of Harlem, the firlt inven\ntor of Printing $ and having printed the\nPfalter, fold them at Paris as Manufcriptsj\nbecaufe as fuch they yielded a better Price.\nBut the learned Dofbors not being able to un-\nderfland how the Work was perform d, concluded\nas above, it was all the Devil, and that the Man\nwas a Witch $ accordingly they took him up for a\nMagician and a Conjurer, and one that work d by\nthe Black Art, that is to fay, by the help of the\nDevil; and in a Word, they threatened to hang\nhim for a Witch, and in order to it, commenc d a\nProcefs againft him in their criminal Courts, which\nmade fuch aNoife in the World as rais d the Fame\nof poor John Fauftus to a frightful Height, till\nat laft he was oblig d, for fear of the Gallows, to\ndifcover the whole Secret to them.\nN. B. This is the true original of the famous\nDr. Fauftus or Fofter, of whom we have\nbeliev d fuch flrange Things, as that it is\nbecome a Proverb, as mat as the Devil and\nDr.\n\f3SO The Modem HIS TORY\nDr. Fofter : Whereas poor Fauftus was no\nDo&or, and knew no more of the Devil\nthan another Body.\nThus the Magiftrates of Bern and Switzerland,\nfinding a Gang of French Acbors of Puppet-fhew\nopen d their Stage in the Town, upon hearing\nthe furpraing Accounts which the People gave\nof their wonderful\nPuppets,\nhow they made them\nIpeak, anfwer Questions, and dilcourfe, appear\nand disappear in a Moment, pop up here, as if\nthey rife out of the Earth, and down there, as\nif\nthey vanifh d, and Abundance more Feats of\nArt, cenfur d them as Demons &amp;gt;\nand if\nthey had\nnot pack d up their Trinkets, and difappeared ai\nmed as dextroufly as their Puppets, they had\ncertainly condemned the poor Puppets to the Flames\nfor Devils, and cenfur d, if not otherwife pu-\nniflied their Mailers.

The\n\fEi: 381\nThe Scripture fpeaks of a Spirit of Dtoination,\nxvi. 16. and a Wench that was pofTefs d by\nthis Spirit Brought her Mafter much Gain by South-\nfaying^ that is to fay, according to the Learned,\nby Oracling or anfwering Queftions &amp;gt;\nwhence\nyou will fee in the Margin, that this\nfouthfaying\nDevil is there call d Python, that is, Apollo, who is\noften calPd Python, and who at the Oracle of Del-\n$hos gave out fuch Anfwers and double Entendres,\nas this Wench poffibly did 5 and hence all thofe\nSpirits which were call d Spirits of Divination,\ntvere in another Senfe call d Pythons.\nNow when the Apoflle St. Paul came to fee\nthis Creature, this Spirit takes upon it to declare\nthat thofe Men, meaning St. Paul and Timo-\ntheus, were the Servants of the moft high God,\nwhich Jhewd unto them the Way of Salvation-, this\nWas a good turn of the Devil, to preferve his\nAuthority in the poflefs d Girl j fhe brought them\nGain by Southfaying, that is to fay, relblving dif\nficult Queftions, anfwering Doubts, interpreting\nDreams, &c. Among thefe Doubts, he makes\nher give Teftimony to Paul and Timotheus, to\n\\vheedle in with the new Chriflians, and perhaps\n(tho very ignorantly) even with Paul and Tirno-\ntheus thernfelves, fo to give a Kind of Credit and\nRcfpecl: to her for fpeaking.\nBut the Devil, who never fpeaks Truth, but\nwith fome finifler End, was difcover d here and de-\nte&ed -\ny his flattering Recognition not accepted, and\nhe himfelf unkenneled as he deferv d &amp;gt;\nthere the De-\nvil was over-fhot in his own Bow again.\nHere now was a real Pofleflion, and the evil\nSpirits who pofiefs d her, did ftoop to fimdry lit\ntle Acts of Servitude, that we could give little\nor no Reafon for, only that the Girl s Mafter might\nget Money by herj but perhaps this was a par\nticular Cafe, and, prepar d to honour the Au-\nl thority\n\f3*2, The Modern HISTORY\nthority and Power the Apoftles hud over evil Spirits-\nBut we find thefe Things carried a great Way\nfarther in many Cafes, that is to fay, wfcere the\nParties are thus really poffefs d &amp;gt;\nnamely, the De\nvil makes Agents of the poffefs d Parties to do\nmany Things for the propagating his Intereft\nand Kingdom, and particularly for the carrying\non his Dominion in the World : But I am for\nthe prefent not fo much upon the real Poffeffion\nas the pretended, and particularly we have had\nmany that have believed themfelves poffefs d, when\nthe Devil never believed it of them, and perhaps\nknew them better j fome of thefe are really poor\nDevils to be pitied, and are what I call Diabks\nImaginaire 5 thefe have notwith {landing done the\nDevil good Service, and brought their Mailers\ngood Gain by Southfaying.\nWe find Pofleflions acknowledged in\nScripture\nto be really and perfonally the Devil^ or accord\ning to the Text, Legions of Devils in the Plu\nral. The Devil or Devils rather, which poflef-\nfed the Man among the Tombs, is\npofitively af-\nfirm d to be the Devil in the Scripture &amp;gt;\nall the\nEvangclifts agree in calling him fo, and his very\nWorks fliew it 5 namely, the Mifchief he did,\nas well to the poor Creature among the Tombs,\n\\vho was made fa fierce, that he was the Terror\nof all the Country, as to the Herd of Swine and\nto the Country in the Lofs of them.\nI might preach you a I^e&ure here of the\nDevil s Terror upon the Approach of our Saviour,\nthe Dread of his Government, and how he ac-\nknowledg d that there was a Time for his Tor\nment, which was not yet come : drt thou came to\ntorment us before our Utme? It is evident the De\nvil\napprehended that Chrift would chain them\nup before the Day of Judgment $ and therefore\nfome think the Devil here, being, as it were,\ncaught\n\f385\ncaught out of his due Bounds, poflefling the poor\nMan in fuch a furious manner, was afraid, and\npetition d Chrift not to chain him up for it, and\nas the Text fays, They befought him to\nfuffer them\nto go away, &c. that is to fay, when they fay,\nart thou come to torment us before the Time?\nthe Meaning is, they begg d he would not caft\nthem into Torment before the Time, which was\nalready fix d 5 but that if he would caft them out\nof the Man, he would let them go away, &c.\nThe Evangelift St. Luke fays, the Devil be-\nfought him that he would not command them to go\nout into the Deep : Our learned Annotators think\nthat part is not rightly rendered j adding, tshat they\ndo not believe the Devil fears\ndrowning j but with\nSubmiffion, I believe the meaning is, that they\nwould not be confin d to the vaft Ocean, where\nno Inhabitants being to be feen, they would be ef\nfectually imprifon d and tied down from doing MiP\nchief, which would be a Hell to them , as to their\ngoing into the Swine, that might afford us fome\nAllegory j but I am not difpofed to jefl with the\nScripture, no nor with the Devil neither, farther\nthan needs muft.\nIt is evident the Devil makes Ufe of very mean\nInftruments fometimes, fuch as the Damfel pofTefs d\nwith a Spirit of Divination, and feveral others.\nI remember a Story, how true I know not, of\na weak Creature next Door to an Ideot, who\nwas eftablilli d in the Country for an Oracle, and\nwould tell\nPeople ftrange Things that fhould be,\nlong before they came to pafs ; when People were\nlick, would tell them whether they fhould live\nor die $ if People were married, tell how many\nChildren they fhould have 5 and a hundred fuch\nThings as fill d the People with Admiration, and\nthey were the eafier brought to believe that the Girl\nwas poflefs dj but then they were divided about\nher\n\fThe\nher too, and that was the fineft\nfpun Thread thfi\nDevil could work, for he carried a great Point in\nit 5 fome faid fhe had a good Spirit, and fome a\nbad, fome faid fhe was a Prophetefs, and fome\nthat fhe was the Devil.\nNow had I been there to decide the QuefKon,\nI fhould certainly have given it for the latter 5 if\nit were only upon this Account, namely, that\nthe Devil has often found Fools very neceflary\nAgents for the propagating his Intereft and King\ndom, but we never knew the good Spirits do fo &amp;gt;\non the other Hand, it does not feem likely that\nHeaven fhould deprive a poor Creature of its\nSenfes, and as it were take her Soul from her,\nand then make her an Inftrument of Initru&ion\nto others, and an Oracle to declare his Decrees\nby 5 this does not feem to be rational.\nBut as tar as this kind of Divination is in Uie\nin our Days, yet I do not find room to charge\nthe DevilVith making any great Ufe of Fools,\nunlefs it be fuch as he has particularly qualified\nfor his Work, for as to Ideots and Naturals^ they\nare perfectly ufelefs to him &amp;gt;\nbut a fort of Fools\ncall d the Magi, indeed, we have fome Reafon to\nthink he often works with.\nWe are not arrived to a certainty yet, in the fet\ntling this great Point, namely, what Magick is ?\nwhether a diabolical Art or a Branch of the Ma-\nthcrnaticks? Our moft learned Lexicon Technicum\nis of the latter Opinion, and gives the Magic Square\nand the Magic Lantern^ two Terms of Art.\nThe Magic Square is when Numbers in Arith\nmetical Proportion are difpos d into fuch Parallels\nor equal Ranks, as that the Sums of each Row\nas well Diagonally as Laterally ihall be all equal j\nfor Example, 2, 3, 4, f, &amp;lt;5, 7, 8, p, 10. Place\nthefe Nine in a Square of three, they will direft-\nly and diagonally make 1 8. Thus^\nThis\n\fr 1\njPLjJ_\nof the DEVIL; 335\n\/\nThis he calls the Magic Square,\nbut gives no Reafon for the Term,\nnor any Account of what infernal\nOperations are\nwrought by this Con\ncurrence of the Numbers &amp;gt;\nneither\ndo I fee that there can be any fuch\nUfe made of it.\nThe Magic Lantern is an optic Machine, by the\nMeans of which are reprefented, on a Wall in\nthe Dark, many Phantafms and terrible Appear\nances, but no Devil in all this, only that they are\ntaken for the Effects of Magic, by thofe that are\nnot acquainted with the Secret.\nAll this is done by the help of feveral little\npainted Pieces of Glafs, only ib and fo fituated,\nplac d in certain Oppositions to one another, and\npainted with different Figures, the moil formida\nble being plac d foremoft, and fuch as are moil\ncapable of terrifying the Spectators\n-\ny and by this\nall the Figures may be reprefented upon the op-\npoilte Wall, in the Inrgeit Size.\nI cannot but take Notice, that this very Piece\nof optic Delufion feems too much akin to the\nmock PofTeffions and infernal Accomplishments,\nwhich mod: ofthe PofTeflionifts of this Age pretend\nto, fo that they are mod of them meer Phantafms\nand Appearances, and no more 5 Nor is the Spirit of\nDivination, the Magic, the Necromancing, ard\nother Arts which were call d Diabolical, found\nto be of any Ufe in modern Practice, at lead, in\nthefe Parts of the World 5 but the Devil feems to\ndo moft of his Work himfelf, and by fliorter Me\nthods 5 for he has fo compleat an Influence among\nthofe that he now Lifts in his Service, that he\nbrings all the common Affairs of Mankind into a\nnarrower Compafs in his Management, with a\nC c Dexte-\n\f3*6 The Modern HISTORY\nDexterity particular to himfelf, and by which he\ncarries on his Interefl filently and furely, much\nmore to the Detriment of Virtue and good Go\nvernment, and confequently much more to his\nSatisfaction, than ever he did before.\nThere is a Kind of Magic or Sorcery^ or what\nelfe you may pleafe to call it, which, tho un\nknown to us, is yet, it feems, flill\nvery much en-\ncourag d by the Devil} but this is a great Way off,\nand in Countries where the politer Inftruments,\nwhich he finds here, are not to be had j namely, a-\nmong the Indians of North-America j This is call d\nPawawing} and they have their Divines, which\nthey call Pawaws or Witches, who ufe ftrange\nGefhires, Diflortions, horrid Smokes, Burnings,\nand Scents, and feveral fuch Things which the\nSorcerers and Witches in antient Times are faid\nto ufc in cafting Nativities, in Philtres, and in\ndetermining, or as\nthey pretended, directing the\nFate of Perfons ; by burning fuch and fuch Herbs\nand Roots, fuch as Hele&ore9 Wormwood, Storax,\nJDevilworty Mandrake^ Nightjhade, and Abundance\nmore fuch, which are call d noxious Plants, or the\nProduct of noxious Plants -\ny alfo\nmelting fuch and\nfuch Minerals, Gums, and poifonous Things,\nand by feveral hellifh\nMutterings and Markings\nover them, the like do thefe Pawaws-y and the\nDevil is\npleafcd, it feems, (or is\npermitted) to fall\nin with thefe Things, and as fome People think,\nappears often to them for their Affiflance upon\nthofe Occaiions.\nBut be thai as it will, he is eas d of all that\nTrouble here &amp;gt;\nhe can Patvaw here himfelf, with\nout their aid, and having laid them all afide, he\nnegotiates much of his Bufinefs without Ambaf-\nfadors j he is his own Plenipotentiary, for he finds\nMan fo\neafy to come at, and fo eafy when he is come\nat, that he flands in no need of fecret Emiflaries,\nor at Icail not fo much as he ufed to do. Upon\n\fof the DEVIL; 337\n^ Upon the whole, as the World, within the\nCompafs of a few pafs d Years is advanced in all\nKinds of Knowledge and Arts, and every ufeful\nBranch of what they knew before improv d, and\ninnumerable ufeful Parts of Knowledge, which\nwere coriceal d before are difcover d j why fhould\nwe think the Devil alone fhould fhnd at a flay,\nhas taken no Steps to his farther Accomplifh-\nment, and made no ufeful Difcoveries in his Way?\nThat he alone fhould ihnd at a Stay, and be juft\nthe fame unimprov d Devil that he was before ?\nNo, no, as the World is\nimprov d every Day, and\nevery Age is\ngrown wifer and wiferthan their Fa\nthers &amp;gt;\nfo, no doubt, he has beftirr d fiimfelf too,\nin order to an encreafe of Knowledge and Difco-\nvery, and that he finds every Day a nearer Way\nto go to work wirh Mankind than he had before.\nBefides, as Men in general feem to have aher d\ntheir manner, and that they move in a higher\nand more exalted Sphere, efpecially as to Vice\nand Virtue 5 fo the Devil may have been oblig\ned to change his Meafures, and alter his Way\nof working j particularly, thofe Things which\nwould take in former Times, and which a ftupid\nAge would come eafily into^ won t\ngo down\nwith us now : As the tafte of Vice and Virtue alters,\nthe Devil is forc d to bait his Hook with new\nCompetitions ; the very Thing calPd Temptation\nis alter d in its\nNature, and that which ferv d\nto delude our Anceftors, whofe grofs Concep\ntions of Things caufed them to be manageable\nwith lefs Art, will not do now 5 the Cafe is\nquite\nalter d j in fome Things, perhaps, as I hinted above,\nwe come into Crime with eafe, and may be led\nby a Finger &amp;gt;\nbut when we come to a more\nrefin d Way of finning, which our Anceftors ne\nver underftood, other and more refin d Politics\nxnufi be made Ufe of, and the Devil rws been put\nC c z upon\n\f3SS The Modern HI STORY\nupon many ufeful Projects and Inventions, to\nmake many new Difcoveries and Experiments\nto carry on his Affairs $ and to (peak impartially,\nhe is\nftrangely improved either in Knowledge\nor Experiment, within thefe few Years j he has\nfound out a great many new Inventions to\nfhorten his own Labour, and carry on hisBuiinefs\nin the World currently, which he never was\nmatter of before, or at lead we never knew he\nwas.\nNo wonder then that he has chang d Hands\ntoo, and that he has left of pawawing in thefe\nParts of the World $ that we don t find our\nHoufes difturb d as they tifed to be, and the Stools\nand Chairs walking about out of one Room into\nanother, as\nformerly -,\nthat Children don t vomit\ncrooked Pins and nifty flub Nails, as of old,\nthe Air is not full of Noifes, nor the Church-\nYard full of Hobgoblins &amp;gt;\nGhofls don t walk\nabout in Winding-Sheets, and the good old\nfcolding Wives vifit and plague their Husbands\nafter they are dead, as\nthey did when they were\nalive.\nThe Age is\ngrown too wife to be agitated by\nthefe dull fcare-crow Things which their Fore-\nFathers were tickled with &amp;gt;\nSatan has been oblig\ned to lay by his Puppet-fhews and his Tum\nblers, thofe things are grown dale 5 his morrice-\ndancing Devils, his mountebanking and quacking\nwon t do now$ thofe Things, as they may be fup-\npofed to be very troublefome to him, (and but\nthat he has Servants enough would be chargeable\ntoo) are now of no great Ufe in the new Ma\nnagement of his Affairs.\nIn a Word, Men are too much Devils them-\nfelves, in the Senfe that I have calPd them fo?\nto be frighted with fuch little low priz d Ap\npearances as thefe 5 they are better acquainted with\nthe\n\fof the DEVIL. 389\nthe old Arch-Angel than fo, and they Teem to\ntell him they muit be treated after another man\nner, and that then, as they are good-natur d and\ntraceable, he may deal with them upon better\nTerms.\nHence the Devil goes to work with Mankind\na much ihorter Way ; for inftead of the Art of\nWheedling and Whining, together with the la\nborious Part of Tricking and Sharping, Hurry\ning and Driving, Frighting and Terrifying, all\nwhich the Devil was put to the Trouble of be-\nfore; in fhort, he acts the GRAND MANNER as\nthe Architects call it (I don t know whether our\nFree-Mafons mayunderfcand the Word) and there\nfore I\nmay hereafter explain it, as it is to be Diabo\nlically as well as\nmathematically underftood.\nAt prefent my meaning is, he a&amp;lt;5ts with them\nimmediately and perfonally by a magnificent Tranf-\nformation, making them meer Devils to them-\nfelves, upon all needful Occafions, and Devils to\none another too, whenever he (Satan, has Need of\ntheir Service.\nThis Way of embarking Mankind in the De-\nviTs particular Engagement, is\nreally very mo\ndern} and tho the Devil himfelf may have been\nlong acquainted with the Method, and as I have\nheard, began to practife it towards the Clofe of\nthe Roman Empire, when Men began to act up\non very polite Principles, and were capable of\nthe moft refin d Wickednefs, and afterwards with\nibme Popes, who likewife were a kind of Church\nDevils, iuch as Satan himfelf could hardly expect\nto find in the World; yet I do not find that he\nwas ever able to bring it into Praftice, at leaft, not\nfo univerfally as he does now : But now the Cafe\nis altered, and Men being generally more expert\nin Wickednefs than they were formerly ; they\nfuffer the fmaller Alteration of the Species,\nin\nC c J being\n\f3&amp;lt;&amp;gt;o\nThe Modern HISTORY\nbeing tranfmigrated -,\nin a Word, they turn into\nDeviIs)\nwith no trouble at all\nhardly, cither to\nthe Devil or to themfelvcs.\nThis Particular would want much the left Ex\nplanation,\ncould I obtain a Licenfe from Sir Hel\nlebore WormwoodJ*&amp;gt;M\\..\nor from my Lord Ih wart-\ncver^ Baron of Scoundrel Hall in the Kingdom\nof Ireland^ write the trueHiilory of their own\nConduct^ and how early, and above all, how ca-\nfily they commenc d Devils^ without the leaft\nImpeachment of their Characters, as wife Men,\nand without any Diminution of that Part of their\nDenomination which eftablifh d them for Fools.\nHow many mad Fellows appear among us every\nDay in the critical Juncture of their Tranfmi-\ngration, juft when they have fo much of the\nMan left as to be known by their Names, and\nenough of the Devil taken up to fettle their Cha\nracters ? This Eaiinefs of the Devil s accefs to\nthefe People, and the great Convenience it is to\nhim in his general Buiinefs, is a Proof to me\nthat he has no more Occafion of Diviners, Magi\ncians, Sorcerers, and whatever elfe we pleafc to\ncall thofe People who were formerly fo great with\nhim ; for what Occafion has he to employ Devils\nand Wizards to confound Mankind, when be is\narriv d to fuch a Perfection of Art as to bring\nMen, at leaft in thefe Parts of the World, to do it\nall themfelvcs j upon this Account we do not find\nany of the old Sorcerers and Diviners, Magici\nans or Witches appear among us $ not that the\nDevil might not be as well able to employ fuch\nPeople as\nformerly, and qualify them for the Em\nployment too, but that really there is no need of\nthem hereabout, the Devil having a fhorter Way,\nand Mankind being much more eafily poflefs dj\nnot the old Herd of Swine were fooner agitated,\ntho there was full 2000 of them together &amp;gt;\nNa\nture\n\fof tfo DEVIL: 391\nture has open d the Door, and the Devil has egrefs\nEnd regrefs atPleafure, fo that Witches and Divi\nners are quite out of the Queftion.\nNor let\nany Man be alarm d at this Alteration,\nin the Cafe as it ftands between Mankind and the\nDevil, and think the Devil having gain d fo\nmuch Ground, may in time, by Encroachment,\ncome to a general PofTeffion of the whole Race,\nand fo we fhould all come to be Devils incarnate j\nI\nfay, let us not be alarm d, for Satan does not\nSet\nthefe Advantages by Encroachment, and by\nis infernal Power or Art, no not at all 5 but tis\nthe Man himfelfdoes it\nby his Indolence and Neg\nligence on one Hand, and his Complaifance to\nthe Devil on the other 5 and both Ways he, as it\nwere, opens the Door to him, beckons him with\nhis\nvery Hand to come in, and the Devil has no\nthing to do but enter and take PofTeflion : Now\nif it be fo,and Man isfo frank to him 3 you know\nthe Devil is no Fool not to take the Advantage\nwhen tis offer d him, and therefore tis no won\nder if the Confequences which I have been juft\nnow naming follow.\nBut let no Man be difcourag d by this, from\nreafluming his natural and religious Powers, and\nventuring to fruit the Devil out 5 for the Cafe is\nplain he may be fhut out 5 the Soul is a ftrong Caf-\ntle, and has a good Garrifon plac d within to\ndefend it 5 if the Garrifon behave well, and do\ntheir Duty, it is\nimpregnable, and the cowardly\nDevil muft raife his Siege and be gone ; nay, he\nrnufl fly, or, as we call it, make his Efcape, left\nhe be laid by the Heels, that is, left his Weak-\nnefs be expofed, and all his Lurking, lying in\nWait, ambufcade-Tricks j this Part would bear a\ngreat Enlargement, but I have not room to be\nwitty upon him, fo you muft take it in the\nGrofsj the DEVIL lies at Blye Bujhy asourCoun-\nC c 4 try\n\f39* The Modern HISTORY\ntry People call it, to watch .your coming out of\nyour Hold j and if you happen to go abroad un-\narm d he feizes upon and mafters you with eafe.\nUnarm d, you ll\nfay, what Arms fhoulcl I take?\nwhat Fence againft a Flail ?

Is there no dealing\n&amp;lt;\nwith him in a Way of human Nature ? This?\nwould require a long anfwer, and fome Philofo-;\nphy might be aclcd ?\nor at leaft imitated, and fome\nMagic, perhaps 5 for they tells us there are Spells\nto draw away even the Devil himfelfj as in fome\nPlaces they nail Horfe-Shoes upon the Threfhold\nof the Door, to keep him out 5 in other Places\nold pieces of Flint, with fo many Holes and fo\nmany Corners, and the like : But I mull anfwer\nin the Negative, I don t know what Satan might\nbe fcar d at in thofe Days, but he is either grown\ncunninger iince or bolder, for he values none of\nthofe Things now j I queftion much whether he\nwould value St. Dunflan and his red hot Tongs,\nif he was to meet him now, or St. Francis or any\nof the Saints, no not the Hoft itfelf in full Pro-\nceffion j and therefore, tho you don t care I\nihould preach, yet in fhort, if you are afraid he\nfhould charge upon you and attack you, if you\nwon t make Ufe of thofe Scripture Weapons I\nfhould have mention d, and which you may hear\nof, if you enquire at Efb. vi. i&amp;lt;5.\nyou muft looJk\nfor better where you think you can find them,\ni But\n\fof the DEVIL. 395\nBut to go on with my Work, the Devil, I\nfay,\nis not to be fcar d with Maukins, nor docs he\nemploy his old Inflruments, but does much of his\nWork himfelf without Internments.\nAnd yet I muft enter a Caveat here too, againft\nbeing mifunderftood in my faying the Devil itands\nin no need of Agents ; for when I fpeak fo, I\nam to be taken in a limited Senfe -\ny I don t\nfay\nhe needs them no where, but only that he does\nnot need them in thofe polite Parts of the World\nwhich I have been fpeaking of, and perhaps not\nmuch here 5 but in many remote Countries tis\notherwife ftillj the Indians of America are par\nticularly (aid to have Witches among them, as\nwell in thofe Countries where the Spaniards and\nthe Engtiflj) and other Nations have planted them-\nfelves, as among-fl thofe where the European Nati\nons feldom come :\nfor Example^ the People of Ca\nnada, that is, of the Countries under the French\nGovernment of Qjiebeck, the Equimeaux, and\nother Northern Climates, have Magicians, Wizards\nand Witches, who they call Pilioatas or Pillo-\ntoasy thefe pretend they fpeak intimately and fa\nmiliarly with the Devil, and receive from him\nthe Knowledge of Things to comej all\nwhich,\nby the Way, I take to be little more than this &amp;gt;\nthat thefe Fellows being a little more cunning\nthan the reft, think, that by pretending to fome-\nthing more than human, they fhall make the\nilronger Impreffions on the ignorant People ; as\nMahomet amus d the World with his Pigeon, uf-\ning it to pick Peas out of his Ear, and perfuaded\nthe People it\nbrought him fuperior Revelations\nand Infpirations from Paradife.\nThus thefe Pillotoas gaining an Opinion among\nthe People, behave like fo many Mountebanks\nof Hell, pretending to underftand dark Things,\ncure Difeafes, praclife Surgery, Phyfick and\nNccro.\n\f394 The Modern HISTORY\nNecromancy altogether; I will not fay,\nbut Sa\ntan may pick out fuch Tools to work with, and\nI believe does in thole Parts, but I think he has\nfound a nearer Way to the Wood with us, and\nthat is fufficient to my prefent Purpofe.\nSome would perfuadc me the Devil had a great\nHand in the late\nreligious Breaches in France,\namong the Clergy, (viz.) about the Pope s Confli-\ntution UnigenituS) and that he made a fair\nAttempt\nto fet the Pope and the Galilean Church together\nby the Ears, for they were all\njuffc upon the Point\nofbreaking out into a Church War, that for ought\nwe knew might have gone farther than the Devil\nhimfelf car d it fhould ; now I am of the quite\ncontrary Opinion, I believe the Devil really did not\nmake the Breach, but rather heal d ir, for fear it\nfhould have gone fo far among them as to have\nfet them all in a Flame, and have open d the Door\nto the Return of the Hugonots again, which it was\nin a fair Way to have done.\nBut be it one Way or t other, the hiftorical\nPart feems to be a little\nagain!! me; for tis cer\ntain, the Devil both wanted and made Ufe of Le-\nfions\nof Agents, as well human as infernal, vifi-\nle and inviiible in that great and important Af\nfair, and we cannot doubt but he has innumera\nble Inftrurnents ftill at work about it.\nLike as in Poland^ J make no Queflion but the\nDevil has thouiands of his Banditti at work at\nthis Time, and in another Country not far from\nir, perhaps, preparing Matters for the next Gene\nral Diet, taking care to prevent giving any Re\nlaxation to the Proreftants, and to juflity the mo\nderate Executions at ^born, to excite a Nation\nto quarrel with every Body who are able to fight\nwith no body ; to erect the Apoftate Race of\nS- y upon a Throne which they have no Title\nto, and turn an eleftivc Throne into an heredita\nry, in favour of Popery. I might\n\fof the DEVIL. 395\nI might anticipate all your Obje&amp;lt;5Hons, by\ngranting the bufy Devil at this Time employing\nall his Agents and Inftruments (for I never told\nyou they were idle and ufelefs) in (hiving to en-\nflame the Chriftian World, and bring a new War\nto cverfpread Europe \\ I might, perhaps, point\nout to you fome of the Meafures he takes, the\nProvocatives which his State Phyficians admini-\nfter to the Courts and Counfellors of Princes, to\nfoment and ferment the Spirits,\nand Members of\nNations, Kingdoms, Empires and States in the\nWorld, in order to bring thefe glorious Ends of\nBlood and War to pafs j for you cannot think\nbut he that knows fo much of the Devil s Af\nfairs, as to write his Hiilory, muft know fome-\nthing of all thefe Matters more than thofe that\ndo not know fo much as he.\nBut all this is remote to the prefent Cafe, for\nthis is no Impeachment of Satan s new Methods\nwith Mankind, in this Part of the World, and\nin his private and feparate Capacity j all this only\nfignifies that in his more general and national Af\nfairs, the Devil acts ftill by his old Methods 3 and\nwhen he is to feduce or embroil Nations, he, like\nother Conquerors, fubdues them by Armies, em\nploys mighty Squadrons of Devils, and fends out\nflrong Detachments, with Generals and Genera-\nliflimos to lead them, fome to one Part of the\nWorld, fome to another 3 fome to influence one\nNation, fome to manage and direft another, ac\ncording as Bufinefs prefents,\nand his Occaflons\nrequire,\nthat his Affairs may be carried on cur\nrently, and to his Satisfaction.\nIf it were not thus, but that the Devil by his\nnew and exquifite Management, of which I have\nfaid fo much, had brought Mankind in general\nto be the Agents of their own Mifchiefs, and\nthat the World were fo at his Beck, that he\nneed\n\f596 The Modern HISTORY\nneed but command them to go and fight, declare\nWar, raiie Armies, deftroy Cities, Kingdoms,\nCountries and People 5 the World would be a\nField or&quot; Blood indeed, and all\nThings would run\ninto Confufion prefcntly.\nBut this is not the Cafe at all. Heaven has not\nlet go the Government of the Creation to his\nfubdu d Enemy, the Devil &amp;gt;\nthat would overturn\nthe whole Syitem of God, and give Satan more\nPower, than ever he was or will be vefted with &amp;gt;\nwhen, therefore, I\nfpeak of a few forward Wretches\nin our Day, who are fo warm in their Wicked-\nnefs, that they anticipate the Devil, lave him the\nTrouble to tempt, turn Devils to themfelves, and\ngallop Hellward fafter than he drives 3 I\nfpeak of\nthem as iingle Perfons, and a&ing in their own\nperfonal and private Capacity, but when I fpeak\nof Nations and Kingdoms, there the Devil is\noblig d to go on in the old Road, and ac~b\nby Stra\ntagem, by his proper Machinery, and to make\ntile of all his Arts, and all his Agents, juft as he\nhas done in all\nAges, from the beginning of his\npolitic\nGovernment to this Day.\nAnd if it was not thus too, what would become\nof all his nurabcrlefs Legions, of which all\nAges\nhave heard fo much, and all Parts of the World\nhave had fo much fatal Experience? They would\nfeem to be quite out of Employment, and be\nrendered ufelefs in the World of Spirits, where\nit is to be fuppofed they refide; not the Devil him-\nfelf could find any Bufinefs for them, which by the\nWay, to bufy and mifchievous Spirits, as they\nare, would be a Hell to them, even before their\nTimej they would be, as it were, doom d to a\nState of Inactivity, which we may fuppofe was\none Part of their Expullion from Bleflednefs and\nthe Creation of Man j or as\nthey were for the\niurprifing Interval between the Deftruction of\nMankind\n\f.\n397\nMankind by the Deluge and Noah s\ncoming out\nof the Ark, when indeed they might be laid to\nhave nothing at all to do.\nBut this is not Satan s Cafe, and therefore let\nme tell\nyou too, that you may not think I treat\nthe Cafe with more Levity than I really do, and\nthan I am fure I intend to do -\ny tho it is too true\nthat our modern and modiih Sinners have arriv\ned to more exquifite Ways of being wicked,\nthan their Fathers, and really feem, as I have\nlaid, to need no Devil to tempt them &amp;gt;\nnay, that\nthey do Satan s Work for him as to others alfo,\nand make themfelves Devils to their Neighbours,\ntempting others to crime even falter than the\nDevil defires them, running before they are fenr,\nand going of the Devil s Emndsgratis 5 by which\nMeans Satan s Work is, as to them, done to his\nHand, and they may be faid to fave him a great\ndeal of Trouble , yet after all, the Devil has\n{till a great deal of Bufinefs upon his Hands,\nand as well himfelf as all his Legions,\nfind them\nfelves a full Employment in dilturbing the World,\nand oppofmg the Glory and Kingdom of their\ngreat Superior, whofe Kingdom it is their whole\nBufinefs, however vain in its End, to overthrow\nand deftroy, if they were able, or at leaft to en\ndeavour it.\nThis being the Cafe, it follows of courfe that\nthe general\nMifchiefs of Mankind, as well national\nand public, as family Mifchiefs, and even perfonal,\n(except as before excepted) lie all (till at the Dmfs\nDoor, as much as ever, let his Advocates bring him\noff of it if they can ,\nand this brings us back again\nto the manner of the Devil s Management, and\nthe Way of his working by human Agents, or\nif you will, the Way of human Devils, working\nin Affairs of low Life, fuch as we call Vi~\ntion, Sorcery, Black- Art, Necromancy, and th\nluce\n\f3ps The Modern HISTORY\nlike&amp;gt;\nall which I take to confifl of two material\nParts, and both very neceflary for us to be right*\nly inform d of.\nI . The Part which Satan by himfelf or his infe\nrior Devils empowers fuch People to do, as\nhe is in Confederacy with here on Earth $ to\nwhom he may be laid, like the Mailer of an\nOpera or Comedy, to give their Parts to\nact, and to qualify them, to ac~b it &amp;gt;\nwhether\nhe obliges them toaRehearfal in his Prefence,\nto try their Talents, and fee that they are ca\npable of performing, that indeed I have not\nenquired into.\ni. That Part which thefe empowered People do\nvoluntier or beyond their Commiffion,to ihew\ntheir Diligence in the Service of their new\nMailer, and either (i.) to bring Grifl to their\nown Mill, and make their Market of their\nEmployment in the beil manner they can $ or\n(z.) to gain Applaufe, be admir d, wonder d\nat, and applauded, as if they were ten Times\nmore Devils than really they are.\nIn a Word, the Matter confifts of what the\nDevil does by the Help of thefe People, and what\nthey do in his Name without him j the Devil is\nfometimes cheated in his own Bufinefs j there are\nPretenders to Witchcraft and Black-Art, who\nSatan never made any Bargain with, but who he\nconnives at, becaule at leall they do his Caufe no\nharm, tho their Bufinefs is rather to get Money,\nthan to render him any Service, of which I gave\nyou a remarkable Inftance before.\nBut to go back to his real Agents, of which\nI reckon two.\ni.Thofe\n\fof the DEVIL. 399\nI . Thofe who aft by Dire&ion and Confede\nracy, as I have faid already many do.\nz. Thofe whom he acts in and by, and they (per\nhaps) know it not, of which Sort Hiftory\ngives us plenty of Examples, from Machia-\nvers firft\nDifciplc to the famous Car\ndinal Alberoni, and even to fome more mo\ndern than his Eminence, of whom I can\nfay no more till farther Occafion offers.\nI. Thofe who a&amp;lt;5t\nby immediate Direction of\nthe Devil, and in Confederacy with him) thefeare\nfuch as I mention d in the beginning of this Chap\nter, whole Arts are truly black, becaufe really\ninfernal ) it will be very hard to decide the Dii-\npute between thofe who really a6b thus in Con\nfederacy with the Devi^ and thofe who only\npretend to it) fo I fhall leave that Difpute where\nI find it&amp;gt;\nbut that there are, or at leaft have been,\na Set of People in the World, who really are of\nhis Acquaintance, and very intimate with him &amp;gt;\nand\ntho , as I have faid, he has much alter d his\nSchemes and chang d Hands of late ) yet that\nthere are fuch People, perhaps of all Sorts ) and\nthat the Devil keeps up his Correfpondence with\nthem&amp;gt; I mutt not venture to deny that Part,\nleft I\nbring upon me the whole PofTe of the con\njuring and bewitching Crew, Male and Female,\nand they fhould mob me for pretending\nto deny\nthem the Honour of dealing with the Devil^\nwhich they are fo exceeding willing to have the\nFame of.\nNot that I am hereby oblig d to believe all the\nftrange Things the Witches and Wizards, who\nhave been allow d to be fuch, nay, who have been\nhang d for it, have faid of themfelves) nay, that\nthey have confefs d of themfelves, even at the\nGallows; and if I come to have an Occafion to\n{peak\n\f400 The Modern HISTORY\nfpeak freely of the Matter, I may perhaps con*\nvince you that the Devil s\npofleffing Power is\nmuch leflen d of late, and that he either is limit\ned, and his Fetter fliorten d more than it has\nbeen, or that he does not find the old Way (as I\nfaid before) fo fit for his Purpofe as he did for\nmerly, and therefore takes other Meafures, but I\nmult adjourn that to a Time and Place by itfelf :\nBut we are told that there are another Sort of Peo\nple^ and, perhaps, a great many of them too, in\nwhom and by whom the Devil really acts, and\nthey know it not.\nIt would take up a great deal of Time and\nRoom, too much for this Place, fo near the Clofe\nof this Work, to defcribe and mark out the in-\nVoluntary Devils which there are in the World ;\nof whom it\nmay be truly faid, that really the\nDevil is in them, and they know it not :\nNow,\ntho the Devil is\ncunning and managing, and\ncan be very filent where he finds it for his In-\ntereit not to be known j yet it is\nvery hard for\nhim to conceal himfelf, and to give fo little Di-\nitiirbance in the Houfe, as that the Family fhould\nnot know who lodg d in it 5 yet, I fay, the De\nvil is fo fubtle and fo mifchicvous an Agent, that\nhe ufes all manner of Methods and Craft to refide\nin fuch People as he finds for his Purpofe, whe\nther they will or no, and which is more, whether\nthey know it or no.\nAnd let none of my Readers be angry or think\nthemfelves ill tifed, wlien I tell them the Devil\nmay be in them, and may act them, and by them,\nand they not know it , for I muft add, it\nmay,\nperhaps, be one of the greater!:\nPieces of human\nWifdom in the World, for a Man to know when\nthe Devil is in him, and when not j when he is a\nTool and Agent of Hell, and when he is not 5 in\na Word, when he is\ndoing the Devil s Work, and\nunder his Direction, and when not. It\n\fDEVIL: 40I\nIt is true, this is a very weighty Point, and\nmight deferve to be handled in a more ferious\nWay than I feem to be talking in all this Book*\nbut give me leave to talk of Things my own\nway, and withall, to tell\nyou, that there is no\nPart of this Work fo\nfcemingly ludicrous, but\na grave and well weigh d Mind may make a fe\nrious and folid\nApplication of it, if they pleafe*\nnor is there any Part of this Work, in which a\nclear Sight and a good Senfe may not fee that the\nAuthor s\nDefign is, that they fhould do fo \\ and\nas I am now fo near the End of my Book, I\nthought it was meet to tell you fo, and lead you\nto it as far as I can.\nI fay, tis a great Part of human Wifdom to\nknow when the Devil is\nafting\nin us and by us, and\nwhen not 5 the next and ftillgreateft Part would\nbe to prevent him, put a Stop to hisProgrefs, bid\nhim go about his Bufinefs, and let him know he\nfhould carry on his\nDefigns no farther in that\nmanner 5 that we will be his Tools no longer;\nin fhort, to turn him out of Doors, and bring a\nftronger Power to take PofTeffion j but this, in\ndeed, is too folid a Subject, and too great to be\ngin with here.\nBut now, as to the bare knowing when he is at\nwork with us, I fay this, tho it is confiderable,\nmay be done, nor is itfo very difficult &amp;gt;\nfor Example,\nyou have no more to do but look a little into the\nMicrocofm of the Soul, and fee there how the\nPaflions which are the Blood, and the Affections\nwhich are the Spirit, move in their particular Vef-\nfcls; how they circulate, and in what Temper the\nPulfe beats there, and you may eafily fee who\nturns the Wheel &amp;gt;\nif a perfect Calm pofTeflcs\nthe\nSoul} if Peace and Temper prevail, and the Mind\nfeels no Tcmpefts rifing j if the Affections are\nregular and exalted to vertuous and fublimc Ob-\nD d\n\f402 The\n^e6ts,\nthe Spirits cool, and the Mind fedate, the\nMan is in a general Re6Htude of Mind , he\nmay be truly faid to be his own Man-, Heaven\n{bines upon his Soul with its\nbenign Influences,\nand he is out of the Reach of the evil Spirit j for\nthe divine Spirit is an Influence of Peace, all\ncalm and bright, happy and fweet like it felf, and\ntending to every Thing that is\ngood both pre-\nfent and future.\nBut on the other Hand, if at any Time the\nMind is ruffled, if Vapours rife, Clouds gather, if\nPaffions fwell the Breaft, if Anger, Envy, Re\nvenge, Hatred, Wrath, Strife j if thefe, or any\nof thefe hover over you, much more if you feel\nthem within you $ if the Affections are poflefs d,\nand the Soul hurried down the Stream to em\nbrace low and bafe Objects j if thofe Spirits, which\nare the Life and enlivening Powers of the Soul,\nare drawn off to Parties, and to be engag d in a\nvicious and corrupt manner, fhooting out wild\nand wicked Defires, and running the Man head\nlong into Crime, the Cafe is eauly refolv d, the\nMan is\npoffefs d, the Devil is in him j and having\ntaken the Fort, or at lead the Counterfcarp and\nOut-Works, is\nmaking his Lodgment to cover\nand fecure himfelf in his Hold, that he may not\nbe difpoflefs d.\nNor can he be eafily difpofiefs\nd when he has\ngot fuch hold as this j and tis no wonder, that\nbeing lodg d thus upon the Out-Works of the\nSoul he continues to fap the Foundation of the\nreft, and by his inceflant and furious AiTaults, re\nduces the Man at laft to a Surrender.\nIf the Allegory be not as juft and appofite as\nyou would have it be, you may, however, fee by\nit in a full View, the State of the Man, and\nhow the Devil carries on his Defigns\n-\ny nothing\nis more common, and I believe there are few\nthh&ing\n\fif the DEVIL; 4o 3\nthinking Minds but may reflecT:\nupon it in their\nown Compafs, than for our Paffions and Affefti-\nons to flow out of the ordinary Channel 5 the\nSpirits\nand Blood of the Soul to be extrayafated,\nthe Paffions grow violent and outragious, the\nAffections impetuous, corrupt and violently vi&quot;\ncious: Whence does all this proceed ? from &quot;Hea\nven we can t\npretend it comes j if we muft not\nfay tis the Devil, whofe Door muft it lie at?\nPride fwells the Paffions j Avarice moves the\nAffedions} and what is Pride, and what is Ava\nrice, but the Devil m the Infidc of the Man Pay,\nas\nperfbnally and really as ever he was in the Herd\nof Swine.\nLet not any Man then, who is a Slave to his\nPaffions, or who is chain d down to his Covet-\noufnefs, pretend to take it illj when I fay he\nhas the Devil in him, or that he is a Devil :\nWhat elfe can it be, and how comes it to pals\nthat Paffion and Revenge fo often difpoflels the\nMan of himfelf, as to lead him to commit Mur-\nther, to lay Plots and Snares for the Life of his\nEnemies, and fo to third for Blood ? How comes\nthis but by the Devil s\nputting thofe Spirits of\nthe Soul into fo violent a Ferment, into a Fever? *\nthat the Circulation is\nprecipitated to that Degree,\nand that the Man too is\nprecipitated into Mifcnief,\nand at laft into Ruin &amp;gt;\ntis all the Devily tho the\nMan does not know it.\nIn like manner Avarice leads him to rob, plun*\nder and deftroy for Money, and to commit fome-\ntimes the word of Violences to obtain the wick\ned Reward. How many have had their Throats\ncut for their Money, have been murther d on the\nHighway, or in their Beds, for the Defire of\nwhat they had ? It is the fame Thing in other\nArticles, every Vice is the Devil in a Man j Luft\nof Rule is the Devil of great Men, and that Am-\nD d 2 bidon\n\f404- The Modern HISTORY\nbition is their Devil as much as whoring is Fa-\nthcr *s Devil; one has a Devil of one\nClafs acting him, one another, and every Man s\nreigning Vice is a Devil to him.\nThus the Devil has his involuntary Inftruments,\nas well as thofe who act in Confederacy with him &amp;gt;\nhe has a very great Share in many of us, and acts\nus, and in us, unknown to our felves tho* we\nknow nothing of it, and indeed tho we may not\nfufpeft it of our felves j like Hazael the jiffyrian^\nwho when the Prophet told him how he would\nact the Devil upon the poor Ifraelites^ anfwer d\nwith Deteftation, is thy Servant a Dog that he\nfhould do this Thing^ and yet he was that Dog,\nand did all thofe cruel Things for all that ; the\nDevil afting him, or a&ing. in him, to make him\nwickeder than ever he thought it was poffible for\nhim to be.\nThe CONCLUSION.\nOf the Dcvil j laft Scene of Liberty, and\nwhat may befnppofed to be his End, with\nwhat we are to underfland of his being\ntormentedfor ever and ever.\nAS\nthe Devil is a Prince of the Power of the\nAir, his Kingdom is mortal, and muffc\nhave an End 5 and as he is call d the God of this\nWorld, that is, the great Ufurper of the Homage\nand Reverence which Mankind ought of right\nto pay to their Maker, fo his Umrpation alfo,\nlike the World it felf, mud have an End :\nSatan is call d the God of the World, as Men\ntoo\n\fof the DEVIL:\ntoo much proftrate and proftitute themfelves to\nhim, yet he is not the Governor of this World\nand ^\ntherefore the\nHomage and Worfhip he has\nfrom the World is an Ufurpation j and this will\nhave an End, becaufe the World it felf will have\nan Endj and all\nMankind, as they had a\nbegin\nning in Time, fo muft expire and be remov d be\nfore the End of Time.\nSince then the Devil s\nEmpire is to expire and\ncome to an End, and that the Devil himfelf and\nall his Hoft of Devils are immortal Seraphs, Spi\nrits that are not embodied and cannot die, but\nare to remain in being j the Queftion before us\nnext will be, what is to become of him ? what is\nhis State to be? whether is he to wander, and in\nwhat Condition is he to remain to that\nEternity\nto which he is ftillto exift ?\nI\nhope no Man will miftake me fo much in\nwhat I havefaid as to Spirits, which are all\nFlame,\nnot being affe&ed with Fire, as if I fuppofed there\nwas no Place of Punifhment for the Devil^ nor\nany Kind of Punifhment that could affecl: them $\nand fo of our Spirits alfo when transformed into\nFlame.\nI muft be allow d to fpeak there of that mate\nrial Fire, by which, as by an Allegory, all the Ter\nrors of an eternal State are reprefented to us in\nScripture, and in the Writings of the learned\nCommentators, and by which\\he Pain of Senfe\nis defcrib d &amp;gt;\nthis, perhaps, I do not underftand\nas they feem to do, and therefore have faid,\nWhen we re all Flame (that is all\nSpirit) we\nlhall all Fire (that is, all fuch Fire as this) defpife.\nAnd thus I claim to be underftood.\nIt does not follow from hence, neither do\nI fugged, or fo much as think that infinite Power\ncannot form a fomething (tho* inconceivable to\nus here) which ih.aU be as tormenting, and as in-\nfupportablc\n\f406 The Modern HISTORY\nfupportable to a Devil, an apoftate Seraph, and\nto a Spirit, tho exalted, unembodied and ra-\nrified into Flame, as Fire would be to other Bo\ndies &amp;gt;\nin which I think I am orthodox, and do\nnot give the leaft Occafion to an Enemy to\ncharge me with profane Speaking, in thofe\nWords, or to plead for thinking prophanely him-\nfelf.\nIt muft be Atheiftical to the laft\nDegree to fug-\ngeft, that whereas the Devil has been heaping\nup and amaffing Guilt ever fince the Creation of\nMan, cncreafing in hatred of God and Rebellion\nagainfl him, and in all\npoffible endeavour to de\nthrone and depofe the Majefly of Heaven j that\nyet Heaven had not prepared, or could not pre\npare a juft Penalty for him 3 and that it fhould\nnot all end in God s entire Victory over Hell,\nand in Satan s\nopen Condemnation: Heaven could\nnot be juft to its own Glory, if he fhould not\navenge himfelf upon this Rebel, for all his fuper-\nlative Wickednefs in his modern as well as an-\ntient Station 5 for the Blood of fo many millions\nof his faithful Subjects and Saints whom he has\ndeftroy dj and if\nnothing elfe ofFer d it felf to\nprove this Part, it would appear undoubted to\nme 5 but this, I confefs, does not belong to Satan s\nHiflory, and therefore I have referv d it to this\nPlace, and fhall alfo be the {hotter in it.\nThat his Condition is to be a State of Punifh-\njnent, and that by Torment, the Devil himfelf\nhas own d, and his calling out to our blefled Lord\nwhen he caft him out of the furious Man among\nthe Tombs, is a Proof of it, What have we to do\nwith tbee, and art thou come to torment us before the\n3*ime? Luke viii. 28. where the Devil acknow-.\nledges four Things, and three of them are dire&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;\nly to my prefent Purpofe, and if you won t believe\nthe Word of God, I hope you will believe the\n\fof the DEVIL: -\n407\nDevil i efpccialiy when tis an open Confeffion\nagainft himfelf.\n1 . He confer* Chrift to be trie Son of God (that\nby the Way) and no Wanks to himy for that does\nnot want the Devil s Evidence.\n2. He acknowledges he may be tormented.\n3.
