The model of it is, as the prophet Ezekiel defcribes it, in the\nform of a wheelt; with many wheels .within the fame, involved one\nwithin another: And thus we find it by mathematical demonftration;\nfor the earth is a wJieel or globe of fea and land, circumfcribed by the at-\nmofphere, as within a greater wheel, which is globous too; and furrounded\nby the heavens, as by many wheels involved one within another, encircling\nthe fun, moon, and ftars, and all the hoft of them.

There is a certain lucky time in\nman's life, wherein if he go out to battle, though with but few men, yet\nhe carrieth the victory; and there is another time wherein, though he go\nout \u00b7with ever fo complete an army, yet 1hall he gain nothing but difgracet.\nSo alfo there is a time wheg, overtures ofmarriage 1hall be fuccefsful, but a\nman's defire\u00a3 anfwer it not, and again there is a time when defires of mar-\nriage fhall ftrongly urge, and all overtures yrove ineffectual ; but there is\na time alfo when defires and overtures 1hal exactly correfpond, and fuit\ntogether. In .like manner, there is a time when profperity and riches 1hall .\noffer themfelves, and be .attained, whether a man fieep or wake ; and by\nand by, though he purfue them with wings, yet fo unlucky a time occurs,\nas renders all his endeavours fruitlefs. Some men come into the world\nin a lucky hour, fo that let. them be wife or fooli1h, they !hall be buoyed\nup on the wings of fate in all matters of wealth or honour, and fucceed in\nall that they take to; while wifer and better men, fmitten with an un-\nlucky time of birth, 1hall be as undefervedly difparaged, and all their un-\ndertakings 1hall prove unfuccefsful and unhappy. Some 1hall be lucky\nin the van of their enterprizes, and as unfortunate in the rear ; and others\nagain contrariwife. And thus time feems to mock and fport with the\nmen of this life, and to advance, or counteract, all their ikill and contri-\nvances, even to a d~gree infinitely beyond whatever we could reafonably\nconceive or expect. And yet time of itfelf is but a dead thing, and a .\nmere inftrument; but the wheels of the heavens turning upon it, imprint\nriddles in its face, and carve and cut oqt the .various iliapes of profperity\nandadverfity, upon the minuteft portion thereof.

Yet all times\n.are !uautiful.in theirflafom, if men could hit them; but through the ma-\nlignity of fin, and an intemperate purfuit of worldly pleafures, we often\nlofe the favourable .time afforded us, of embracing the moil: fubftantial\nb.appinefs\u2022\n.f:_ \u00b7The fecond great lord over human inventions, is Chance. And thefe\n)(ithances proceed from a great variety of rare and fecret operations of hea-\ni ' v.~n, which throw in the way of men thofe. ftrange and fortuitous turns of\nfortune, that furpafs all human fGrelight or conception. And yet there\nis really no fuch thing as chance in nature; much lefs can there be any\nthing that comes by chance, in refpeel: of God ; but all thofe curious hits\nthat {trike in between the caufe and its effeCt, we call Chances, as heft fui t-\ning human ideas, beca.ufe of the undefcribable properties of them. For\n.in 1huffiing a pack of cards, or in calling the dice, it feems to us a meer\n.chance what call: 1hall happen uppermofi, or what card will go to the\n\u00b7bottom of the pack, and yet it is evident by experience, that there is a\n.certain luck in nature, which pre.fi.des over all thefe adventures, fo that a\nman iliall either win Dr lofe in a methodical courfe. . It alfo happens in the\ntime of battle_, and in every purfuit after wealth and honor, that chances\nfall in upon us, and turn the .fcales by a fecret kind of fate, beyond all\nthat .could reafonably have been expeCted; and thus heaven breathes into\nall human actions, an infinity of thefe _chances, that overturn the wifdom\nand power, and all the greatnefs of man. Thefe chances are uniformly\nmanaged by a certain kind of Juck, either good or bad, which drives the\nnail; and this, by fome heavenly influence, that infufes a fccret virtue or\npoifon into our aCtions, as courage into their hearts on one fide, or difmay\non .the other; and ik.ill into fome mens heads to purfue the right courfe\nto be rich, or fc>lly into others, whereby they run headlong to mifery and\nwant; or e1fe fortunateth or infortunateth by miftake of words, fignals,\nor acts, that turn to the heft or worft advantage, by ftrasge hits or mif-\ncarriages ; and thus it happens that a flight mifr.ake in battle begets an utter\nro~t,af.ter a victory made almoftcomplete, by the meer utterance of a wrong\nword, or i}:eering an improper courie\u2022. But which way foever it happens,\nthe whole mattec is wrought by a good or ill luck, and the hand of God\nis at the bottom of it ; not by anv new contrived act, but by the fame\nregt,~lar courfe ofnature, ordained from the beginning of the world\u2022\nThus\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nThus both Time and Chance are the fervants of nature, under whofe\n\"COmmands they fway the World, and Worldly men; but by her laWS are\n-both of them difpofed. Time .meafures out the extent ofmens lives7 and\n.fets bounds how long they may live by flrength of nature, and how much\nof that time {hall be e\u00abtenuated by means of fin; and it alfo carves out\nlimits to the particular fates of all mankind; and Chance aCts in obferv-\nance of thofe limits, and brings about the good and bad fuccefs of every\nfate. And thus by the fervice of Time and Chance, nature performs all\n.her great and.fecret operations, whether upon colleCtive bodies, or places,\n<Or ~perfons. It may be thought firange that nature ilio'uld bring forth men\n.and women at a great difiance of years, hours, and places, all defl:ined to\n\u00b7-die at one time, and by the fame manner of death, either by war, plague,\n\u00b7 ~pefrilence; or thipwreck; and that time and chance '{hould pick them up,\n.and draw them together, from a variety of different purfuits, to partake\n:at lafr in .one and the fame defrruetive fate. Yet this is no more frrange\nthan true; for thefe things frequently happen, and that by the imper-\nceptible influences of thofe heavenly afpeCts and ftars, which in their\ncfJurfts fought againfl Siftra*. And by the fame rule, as many men, wo-\nmen, and children, are, on the other hand, gathered together by a fimi-\nlar force and virtue, to enjoy great and good fortune\u2022\n\u2022\nSome perhaps will contend, that thefe operations of nature are incom-\npatible with the free agency of man's will. But if what has already\nbeen premifed b~ attentively confidered, this fuppofition will immedi-\nately vani{h ; for God, who ordained the courfe of nature, certainly\nforefaw the minutefr turn of .every man's will, and eventually contrived\nhis fate to correfpond therewith, fo as to admit its free and uncontrouled\n-choice. And whoever denies this antecedent principle, or prefcience of\nGod in the confiruCl:ion of the world, denies one of his mofr e1fential\n.attributes. The Will of man, without doubt, in a variety of infiances,\nmakes great ftruggles and wrefrlings with the ftarry influences, both\nin good and in evil purfuits, and often prevails over them cxceedingly;-\nfor though a perfon be born under fuch benevolent or malignant afpeets,\nas {hall point out his natural temper and difpofition, and indicate the\nprincipal tranfattions, fortunate or unfortunate, that are likely to be the\ndifringuilhing marks of his life; yet does it depend entirely upon the\nfree uncontrouled will of that man, whether all thofe circumftances, fo\npointed out in his nativity, {hall come to pafs, or not; becaufe the free\nwill in every man, when fortified by habits of virtue and \\vifdom, often\n-enable him to over-rule thofe evil afpeCl:s, fo as to avoid the commif-\nd!on of any criminal offence, and to guard him againft the misfortunes or\n~ Judg. v, :zo.\n.toifes\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f20- AN ILLUSTRATION\nlofi'es impending over- him; while men of a profligate and brtle(s\nhabit, not only lofe the advantages of a promifing nativity, p.ut, ~f\nborn under malevolent afpeets, are often reduced to the laft ftage of di-\nftrefs, atld perHh under the very fame ftrokes of nature, w:hich: wifer\nand better men, porn in the fame inaufpicious moments, have endured\nwith much eafe.

Let us confider the account given by Mofes, of\nthe creation of the heavenly bodies. God faid, \" Let there be lights in\nthe firnament of heaven, to divide the day from the night J the greater\nlight-to rule the elay, and the le1fer light to rule the night, and let them\nbe for. figns, a.nd for feafons, and for days and years.\"-Thefe then were\nthe purpofes for\u00b7 which they were ordained, andirrevocably fixed by their\ngreat Creator--.firft for lights; for had .they not a place in\u00b7the firmament,\nbr were- we deprived of their illuminating \u00b7rays, we lhould be inftantly\noverwhelmed with impenetrable darknefs.

There-\n,fore when God faith, Let them he for figns, be muft fpeak in reference \u2022\nto man whom he formed a rational creature, capable of diftinguilhing one\nfign from another, and-of improving by them. Nor are we to look upon\nthem as mere figns, like beacons upon a hill, or as only fetting bounds to\ndays, months, and years ;_but we are to confider them as figns and tokens\nof thofe hidden events of futurity, which it concerns every wife and good\nman to know; and which be may always forefec, by avirtuous and fober\nftudy of thefe intelligent figns, placed by God for that purpofe in the fir-\nmament of heaven. And that this was the intent of them, is clearly de..\nmonftrated by the words of our Saviour, when he foretold the deftruction\nof Jerufalem, and the final confummation of all things. His apoftles\nafked him, What fuall the fign of tbefe things be? He replies, \u00b7Earth-\nquakes, famines, and peftilences; fearful fights in the heavens, and figns in\nthe fun, in the moon and in the \u2022 fiars. Such alfo was the fign by which\nthe Eall:ern Sages difcovered the birth of our Saviour, and the place of\nhis nativity; and num~rous other inftances may be adduced, both from\n{acred and profane hiftory, in fupport of this doCtrine.-The fourth ufe\nof thefe celeftial luminaries, is for feafons. This is allo obvious; for we\n.find that heat and cold, and drought and moifture, are all guided and go-\nverned by the heavenly bodies; and that not only fpring and autumn,\n~nd fuminer and winter, bear teftimony of it; but we have it confirmed by\nthe evidence of our own conftitution and feeling; for when the weather\nis heavy and lowering, we fin\u00b7d ourfelves dull and languid ; when bright\nand radiant, we are s:hearful and merry; and, when unfettled and untea-\nfonable, we feel it by indifpofition and melancholy; and this is all brought\nabout by the operation of thefe luminaries upon the feafons of the year,\nin the due courfe of nature. The next ufe allotted them is fifthly for\ndays, and fixthly for years; and that thefe are meafured out, and governed\nby them, is every way apparent; by the fun's circqit, and the moon's\nenergy.-The fun, like a ftrong man, rejoices to run his race; he rifeth\nout of the chambers of the eaft, and with golden rays difpels the morn-\ning_ clouds, and exhales the pearly dew; chearing and refreiliing all na-\nture ~ith his prefence. Hence it is evident that thefe luminaries were\nnot only placed in the heavens to give light upon the earth, to govern.\nthe feafons, and to fet bounds to time; but alfo to communicate figns\nand tokens to mankind, of things to come. We fuall now confider how\nfar it is fcripturaJ, and confonant to reafon, to. allcw them thofc infiu-.\ncnces att.ributed to them by Aftrology. ~\n~ Luke xxi. 61 7, aa, as, &c\u2022.\nThat\nDigitized b~Google\n...\n\u2022\n\f- .\n.\n- \u2022 \"! \u2022\nOF ASTRQLOGY\nThat the fun, moon, and all the planets, have a direCt and obwous- influ...\nupon earthly fubftances, no man of common obfervation will pretend\ndeny. The fun is the fountain of heat, and that heat is the nurfe o\u00a3\n; and the moon is the fountain of moifture, which tempers the vio ~\nlent heat of the fun, and modifies all his operations. But the fun and\nmoon, and all the planets, have each of them a particular fpecific pro-\nperty, according to their own innate quality, and according to the nature\nof that fign\u00b7 or band of fiars under which they happen to be pofited..\nThis is a -fact eftablHbed by repeated obfervation and experience; for\nwhen the fun enters the equinoCtial fign A1\"ies, the fpriog begins to 1hew\nherfelf, and aJl vegetative nature, by the moon's humidity and the fun's\ntemperate heat, feems to revive and flourifu, and, as it were, to rife from\nthe dead; whither the cold blafis of the hyemnal air, had before configned\nit.. So, when his radiant beams enter the fign Taurus, they fi:ir up the\"\"\nbenign influences of the Pleiades and Hyades; Ha:di being.then to the\nnorth, and Orion to the fouth, and ArEturus finking below the horizon-;\nand their cold and tempefiuous effdls begin to ceafe, as they are fuc\u00b7\nceeded by thefe benevolent confiellations which produce warm fouthern\nwinds, and gentle lhowers, repleni.fhing the earth, and caufing vegetation.\nAgain, when the fun rifes with the Dog-fiar, we find an influence which\n\u00abeaufes.vebemency of heat, contagion, and infirmity. Medicaments ad..\nminiftered under this conftellation,. prove hard and obnoxious; and we\nfind dogs at this time are apt to run mad; the fea is troubled without any\napparent caufe, and all nature feems mere or lefs oppre1fed by it; and\nyet thefe effeCts are never found to be equally violent in any two fummers,\nwhieh clearly proves an influence in the fi:ars, as well as in the fun. And\nagain, though the \u00b7fun. keeps the fame conftant. and invariable courfe\nthrough the twelv~ figns of t-\nhe Zodiac, for an-infinity of annual revo-\nlutions, yet we never _find the feafons and weather exadJy correfpond,\nwhich they doubtJefs would do, were it not that cold and heat, and wind\nand rain,.are governed by the configurations the fun has with the planets\nand fix.ed fiars; and this.alfo evidently proves the force of their influence.\nIt is likewife manifeft, that, whenever the planet Saturn is pafiing out ot\none fign into-anothc:r,. the weather. is.mor.e or lefs. turb.ulent.and.~nfettled.\nBut it is not the weather only, nor the inanimate part of the creation\nalone, that is affeCted by the influences of the fun, moon, and planets;.\n!or we find they operate upon the human fpecies, and upon all animate\nnatnre, in every part of the world. The fun,. and the quality of the\nheavens about the torrid zone, naturally occafwn thole men who are born\nand liv.e under it \u00b7to be quite black, with iliort crifped hair, of a mean.\n.ftature, and.hot conftitution, imbibing a fierce- and favag~ fpirit ;. and\nthis\nr\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\u2022\nA N\u00b7 I L L.

So likewife the inhabitants of the north are\na ftrong body, but of rude mannars and condition, becaufe their vertical\npoint is placed at a great diftance from the fun's courfe; and therefore they\nabound with cold ~nd moifture, and are of a phlegmatic conftitution, of\na fair complexion, taU, courageous, and ingenuous. Europe, being\n.iituated in the north-weft part of the earth, is uhder Mars in Aries; and,\nby reafon of this planet ruling in that triplicity, its inhabitants are na-\nturally of a noble and magnanimous fpirit, given to martial exploits, and\n.feats of war; of a generous mind, and courteous manners. And thus the\n{uq, modified by the different figns and conllellations through which he\npaffes, regulates the climates, and lheds his influence upon all mankind,\nleaving behind him evident marks of his government and fway. Some,\nindeed, have.attempted to account for the fwarthy and black complexion\n.of the favage race, by a variety of other plaufible conjeCtures ; but none\nare to be relied on, that do not attribqte its caufe to the intenfe heat and\npower of the fun in thofe climates ; than which nothing can be more\nconfonant to reafon, fince we find, even in this country, that if we remain\nlong together in the fun, in the heat\u00b7offummer~ our complexions change,\nand we become in a degree tanned.and fwarthy. \u00b7\nConfpicuous as are the influences of the fun, thofe of the moon ~re no\nlefs fo. This is evinced by a confideration of that wondeJ-ful and never\u2022\nceafing operation ofthe moon upon the ocean, fo as to occafion that per-\npetual flux and reflux of the fea, which we call tides. Here we\u00b7fee the\nwaters of the vaft ocean, forgetful, as it were, of their natural reft, move\nand roll in tides obfequious to the ftrong attraCtive power of the moon,\n.and with an increafe or diminution of force, in proportion as the appears\nin firength, or want of afpetl. This is an influence fo univerfally ad\u00b7\nmitted, and fo peculiar to \u00b7that luminary, that it eftablithes at once the\ndoctrine we contend f9r. But there are ~umerous other infrances of\nthe effefls .of the moon, no lefs common than extraordinary, and perfed:ly\nwell known. Thofe unhappy perfons who labour under a deprivation of\nfenfe, and are affliCted with lunacy, have their fits more violent and ter\u2022\nrib1e, in proportion as the moon increafes or diminilhes in light and mo~\ntion ; and, in all chronic and acute difeafes, her power and influence arc\nvifibly and forcibly felt. Indeed every fubjeet of the creation is more or \u00b7\nlefs etfetled by the moon's energy ; the eyes of cats are obferved to fwell\nor fall at the full and change of the moon; and even the thell-fi.th at the\nbottom\n.,. \u2022 >\n. \\\n..\n' .. ~\n... .\u2022 ... \u2022 I\nI\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f...\n,\nj 0 F A S T R 0 L_ 0 G Y. - 25\ni -- 1e ocean, are known to feel the weight of her influence.\nwho fleep in the fields, or in any place expofed to the open air, by\nght, find their heads oppre1fed with water, and their fenfes inert\n\u2022 ' heavy; and butcher's meat hung up, and expofed to the. moon-light,\nH foon putrify.

Thefe\neffeCts and influences of the moon are fo com\u00b7mon, and fo generaJly known,\nthat it were almofi needlefs to repeat them here, but for the purpofe of\ndrawing this conclufion, that, as one planet has a known and forcible ac-\ntion upon fublunary things, it is natural to believe that all the others\nare endued in fome degree with a fimilar fo\u2022ce and virtue. Indeed moft\nphyficians know that the planet Saturn rules all climac1erica1 years, as the\n1un doth critical days, and the moon the crifis of all acute difeafes; and\nthat every ftventh year Saturn comes to the fquare or oppofition of his\nplace in the radix of every man's nativity; and that. after the re\\'olutioil\nof the: fun, he becomes the chid.ruler of criticJl days, and is.._often ob-\nferved, by his configurations with the moon, to fet afide the fatal crifis\nof thofe defperate dilorders, over which the patient was not expected to\n\u00b7Jive. From thefe phyfical reafons, we may fafely conclude that Saturn\nis by nature cold and melancholy, as the fun is hot and chearful; and,\nbeing thus oppofire to the i~n in quality and effeEl. fo is he in relation to\nthe figns and manfions of the heavens where he bears rule, an-\nd therefore\ninclines always to cold, as the fu\u00b7n does to .heat., Hence it follows, that\nwhen the fun is in Aquaries, which is the proper fign of Saturn, and op..\npofite to his own fign Leo, the weather inclines more to cold than to heat;\nand, at every conjunction, fquare, or- oppofition, of Saturn with the two\ngreat luminilries, we always .fin.l the weather cold, moift, and lowering,\nevt:n in the midft of the: fum mer, unle(s the rays of Jupiter or M.1rs inttr-\npofc, in whkh cafe thtfe cftt:Cts. are fomewhat \u00b7lefs vifi b:e.

The Lord, who ga\nthe fun for a light by day, gave the ordinances of the moon and fiars alfo\nfor a light by night; and to thefe fiars hath he committed a certain rule\nor dominion\u2022 over the day and night, and that promifcuoufiy. Now the.\nfiars have no vifible operation upon us, befides that little Jight they ad-\nminifter to our eyes in ;1 dark and clear night; and that i5 fo very fmall,\nthat all the fiars in heaven, befides the fuo and moon, are not to be com-\npared, in this refpeCl:, with the fmallell wax-light; and this little light\ntoo is only to be had when the nights are ferene and unclouded. Can it\nthen be fuppofed that God made thefe glorious bodies, many of which\nare bigger 'than the whole \u00b7earth, and move in their orbs as fo many other\nworlds in the heavens, merely for a twinkle in the night, and that only\nwhen the weather permits? lo! every little dJify that grows upon the cold\nground has a fecret and infentible virtue wrapt in its leaves and flowers;\nand have thefe celefiial bodies no injluences but what we now and then\ncatch with our eyes, as they occafionally fparkle their. dim glances upon\nus? Yes, they have each of-them a fecret power and virtue, wherewith\nthey act upon all earthly things, as well by day as by night, and in cloudy\nas well as in.clear weather. But, as their operations are not performed by\nfenfible and palpable means, it follows that\u00b7 they have a fecret and hidden\nway of rule, whereby the influences are imperceptibly infufed into every\nconcern\u00b7of this life. And, as h avt: the fiars, fo alfo have the fun and\nmoon, a fecret and imperceptible aCtion, peculiar to themfelves; for it is\nnot the mere heat that gives life, nor the mere moifture that fufiains it;\nfor, if that were the cafe, then might man make living creatures artificially.\nIt is true that heat may hatch the eggs, but all the ingenuity of man can-\nnot make an egg that can be hatched ; for there is a fecret operatioQ. of\nthe fun and moon, independent of heat and moifture, neceffary to the pro-\nduCtion of life, both in vegetive and fenfitive animals. And in thefe\nfecret and infenfible operatiens, befides the light that they give, confifts\nthat rule which the fun, moon, and fiars, were ordained to exercife over\nall the fons of day and night ; and herein are written all thofe ordinancu\nof the moon and ftars, which are to be a law unto mankind, and to the\nwhole body of nature, fo long as the world t endures. Thus the ftars\nhave their natural influences, afligned to them in the frame of nature,\nfrom the beginning of the world; and thefe influences are dift\"ufed upon all\nearthly things, as far as day and night extend their limits.

Here, when there was nothing but earth and water, and\ndarknefs overfpread all, the fpirit of God maintained that chaotic mafs,\nand managed- the earth by the water, and the water and darknefs by\nh.imfelf.

That there is an intelled:nal\npower informing the whole world, a_\ns the foul does the bod)', i& not to be\ndoubted ; for othcrwife the whole frame of nature would be inert and\nmotionlefs; but then, if we admit the foul of the world to carry this-in..\ntelled: in its own brain, it will follow, that this foul is a God; for an\nintelleClual being, filling heaven and earth with its prefence, is an attri-\nbute\u00b7of \u2022 Gods. Hence I conclude there is an univerfal. foul in the\nworld, but. that it is only vegetive, and not\u00b7intclled:ual; and that in &Ilia -\nfoul dwells the fpirit of Almighty God, who filleth the heavens and'the\nearth with his prefence, and from hence garnilheth the heavens, and\nc:aufeth the precious influences of the fun, moon, and ftars, to be diftri-\n. buted into all parts pf the \u00a7 world. And thus God rules immediately in\n\u00b7 &he heavens, but rules the world mediately by the heavens. lt is true,\nindeed,. that God is equally well able to govern and maintain the world\nwithout means, as he was at firft to conftitute and create the frame of na-\nture; but {uch is His divine will and pleafure, that he has thought fit to\nbring all things to pafs by virtue of means, as ordained from the beginning\nof the world. It is a com111on and tr.u~ maxim, that .God and nature-\nhave made nothing in vain;. and yet it is as true, that grafs and herba\ngrow where no- creatures liye to eat t them.

And fuch\nwas the work of God, when tbe fea made a lane for men to pafs through\n.on dry ground; and when the fire had no power to fcorch nor tQ burn\nthofe who walked in the midft of t it. Thefe miracles, it is true, had\nno immediate dependance upon the works \u00b7of nature;\u00b7 and yet, as God\nfrom the beginning faw the nec~ffity of them, and the occafion upon\nwhich .they would be required, it is- reafonable to fuppofe he fet down in\nhis eternal mind the contrivance of thefe miracles, and fo ordained them\nto keep pace.with the works of nature, and to come to pafs at \u00b7their ap-\npointed Leafons,. without difturbing or deranging that univerfal frame of\nthe world, out of which all natural things proceed, and from whence all\n-the hoft \u00b7of heaven derive their faculty of influencing earthly fubfiances.\nAnd that the heavenly bodies poffefs .thefe influences, in an infinitely\npowerful degree, I bdieve will not be denied, fince both fcripture and\nreafon, as we have now feen, fubftantially prove them. .

We\nhave already feen that Adam, previous to his expulfion from Paradife, was\ninftruetcd in a foreknowledge of futurity, by the.exprefs command of\nGod, as a means of enlarging his mind, and alleviating his diftrefs, upon'\nbeing turned adrift into the wide world. Jofephus, an hiftorian of cha-\nrader and em~nence, who quotes the moll ancient authors of refpeClability\nfor what he a1ferts, confirms the fame thing, and further informs us, that'\nAdam, before his death, inftruCted his fon Seth in this fcience, who after-\nwards engraved th~ rudiments of it upon permanent pillars of ftone, which\nendured through many generations, and were not entirely effaced tlJI fome\ntime atter the \u2022 deluge. We have it from the fame authority, that th'e\nart was taught by Enos and Noah, who preferved it to the days of Abra-.\nham, and he increafed the knowledge of it by divine aids, teaching it to\nthe Chaldeans and Egyptians. Jofeph is alfo faid to have patronifed and\n\u00a7 I would recommend a Cerious and attentive pe~ufal of thefe [c,riptures to every perfon . who\nhas doubts concerning the doctrine ?f A~rology. It is here pointed out, to the underfianding\nof the moft unlettered part of manktnd, that the great and terrible day of the Lord, the day of\njudgment, will moft affuredly come. Our Saviour's difciples enquire of him, When this day\nlliall be ? He replies, '' Of that''day and hour knoweth no man, no not the ~ngels which are\n\"in heaven, neither the Son).. but the father only.\" They alfo afic, Whatfuall be the figns\nhereof? They are told, \" 'J. here fhall be figns in the furt, in the moon, and in the ftars; the\n\" fun (ball be darkened, and the moon lhall not give her_\nlight J \u00b7and upon the earth \u00b7difirefs of\n\" nations, with perplexity; the fea and the waves roaring ; with great earthquakes in divers\n\" places, and famines, and peftilences; fearful fights and great figns fhall there alfo be in tl1c\n\" heavens. Watch, therefore, far in an hour when ye think not filall thefe things COIJle ;.far\n\" as, in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinkiog, marrying and giv.-\n\" ing in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark; and they knew not, until the ftood\n\" came and took them away ~ fo alfo fhall the comint of the Son _of mari be. Then ihall be\n\" fend forth his angels, and fhall -\ngather together his elect from the four winds, from the utter-\n\" moft part of the earth, to the uttermoft part of heaven ; then fhall two be in a field, the one\n\" fhall be taken, and the other left ; two women thall be grinding at the mill\u2022. the .one\u00b7 ihall be ta,.\n\" ken, and the other left. Therefore be ye ready, left, coming, he find you fleeping ; and what\n\" I fay to you, I fay unto all, WATCH.\" Now it is clear, from the above, that figns of great\n\u00b7 )lnd direful events are di{coverable not only by the celeftial bodies, but alfo by fearful fights in\nthe heavens ; by tremendous earthquakes; by total eclipfes of the two great luminaries, which\ndeprive them? for a time, of the power of giving light ; and by other extraordinary phenomena.,\nwhich ihould always be attended to witb reverence and awe. Thefe figns our Saviour lnformet\nhis difciples iliould precede the defiruelion of Jerufalem ; and aftrologers, and other liiftorians;\nhave born record of the exact completion of this prophecy ; and it muft be {elf-evident to eve-\nry thinking mind, that the laft day will come to pafs exatlly in the way our Saviour ha5 dc-\n.fcribed it. Thofe, therefore, who watch the heavenly configurations, and Jearn\u00b7 to underftand\nthe figns our Saviour fpeaks of, will be timely informed of the approach of this direful day, and\nfound prepared; by repentance -a1.1d humility of heart, to be gathered with God's ele8; ; while on-\nbelievini and impenitent mei!J given up to fenfual and care~fs habits, will be found lleeping\nwhen the avenger.cometh. \" In that day the ftouteft heart wall tremble, and the countenance of\nthe proudefi man will fall, befor.e the face of. an incenfed Deity.\" See Matth. xxiv.\nMark xui. andLukexx:. \u2022 See JoC.

Mofes afterwards\ntaught and profeffed it, independent of the gift of prophecy, which al-\nways came by divine infpiration, and confequently was \u00b7only exercifed\nupon certain extraordinary occafions. From Mofes, we are told, the pro-\nphets _\nand feers had it; and that it was afterwards particularly taught\namong the tribe of Iffachar, \u00b7who are on that acco~nt fiiled in the facred\nwritings, Men who had underjlanding in the t times, and were expert at re-\nfolving all queftions concerning futurity; and as this tribe were neither\npriefis nor Levites, nor endued with the fpirit of prophecy, it follows\nthai their underflanding in the timn, and their ability in foretelling future\nevents, arofe entirely from an acquired knowledge of the figns and influ-\nences of the heavenly bodies. For the fame reafon the Perfian aftrologers\nwere called mages, or wife men, who were fk.illed in the times; and the\nChaldeans termed their young ftudent\"s in aftrology, Men jkilled in wffdom\nand cunning \u00a7ftience, to learn the\/earning ifthe Chaldeans. And, after the\nChaldean method -\nof fiudying the fciencc of aftroJogy, Daniel, and Shad-\nrach, and Mcfech, and Abednego, were infiruCl:ed by their tutor Melzar,\nand became ten times more learned in all matters qfwffdom and undeij\/atzding\n\u00b7 than all the ajlrologers in the realm, in confideration of which they were\nelected members of the public \u2022 fchools at Babylon, which were founded\nfor the fiudy of this art; and Daniel was made, by the, king's decree,\u00b7\nmafter over_the Chaldean U afirologers~ \u00b7\n-\nIn the days of Samuel, it appears to have been a common cuftom to go\nto\u00b7the feers, or men of underftanding in the times,_ not only to be inform-\ned concerning future contingencies, but alfo to enquire after lofi goods\u2022.\nTo this effect \u00b7we find Saul and his fervants difcourfing, when they were\nfent _\nout to find the firayed affes of Kith, Saul's father; and, not being able\nto find them, the fervant propofes to go and enquire of the leer, which way\nthe affes were gone, and where they may be found. Saul agrees to this, but\nfk.s, What have we to give him? we have no bread left, nor have we any \u00b7\ntifjicient prifent. The fervant r~plies, I have a fourth part ofa jhelul'if\n.filver; 1'1\/ give him that. Saul anfwers; Well foid; let \u2022\u2022 us go. This\npaffages enables us to difiinguifu between the gift of \u00b7prophecy, for the\npurpofcs of efiablilhing God's true rfligion, and the art of anfwering ho-\nrary queftions, and predicting future events.

And being informed they would\nbetray him into the hands of the enemy, who, were feeking his \u00b7life, he\nfled into the wildernefs of Ziph, and efcaped the danger that was im..\npending over t him. And in the New Teftament alfo, we have fre -\nque~t c?nfirmations o~ the.meteoro]o~ical p~rt of this f~ience, from our\nSav10ur sown words, 1n h1s converfat1on With the phanfees, who wer~\nall verfed in afirology.

And now, if we impartially c.ontemplate the\norigin and antiquity of this fcience, and recollect that the betl: and wifefr\nmen in every age of the world were pr:ofeffors of it,_we muft admit its\npr~ctice to be highly confiftent \u00b7with all our moral and religious duties\u2022.\nThat the human undettl:anding is alfo capable of attaining to a very\nhigh degree of knowledge in the hidden works of futurity, and in the\nfecret operations of nature~ is likewife to be proved, beyond the power\nof contradiaion.

'I he Emperor Domitian required the profe1for Largius Proculua\nto calculate his nat.ivi.ty, from the fuppofed time of his birth,_which was.\n.done; and_ delivered into the emperor's own hands..

The fame writers add, that Apollonius Tyaneus\nwas at that infiant of time at Ephefus, fianding in the prefence of the -\nmagi(lrates, and in a kind of ecftacy cried out, 0 Stephanus, ll:rike the\ntyrant; and after a paufe added, 'Tis well, thou haft killed him.

But, when the fatal ap-.\npointed hour arrived, he faw the folly of his own conceits; recanted his\nopinion, and fealed by his death a ftanding memorial of the inerrabiJity\nand truth of this fcience. Many\u00b7 other extraordinary circumftances of\nthe kind might be related from different authors, were .it not already\nfufficiently ob\\'ious that the intellectual faculties of man, when culti-\nvated by fludy, and improved by obfer:vation and experience, are capable\nof attaining a very extenfive degree of knowledge and 1kill in this art.\nWe will therefore difinifs this argument, and endeavour to ex9lain what <\nthe fubjeCls are that the fcience of Aftrology naturally comprehends. ..\nAftrology is compounded of a~n~r, jlar, and >.e\/Ou d!foouife, and literaUv \u00b7\nimplies, 'Ihe doCirine if the)Iars; teachingbow to judge of their effcds,\nand fecret influences, and to foretel future events, by the order of.'their\ndifferent afpeds, qualities, and pofitions; and alfo how to difcover their\nenergy and furce upon earthly fubftances, in rhe wonderful and abftrufe\noperations of the nature. It\u00b7comprehends the moft excellent part of that\nnoble fcience called Phyfiology, or natural Philofophy, which is the doc-\ntrine of natural bodies in the conftrutl:ion of the works of nature. The\nbody natural may be conceived either generally.. as one perfeCl and entire\nbody; or fpecially, as it .may be divided into two, or fubdivided into\nmany thoufand component parts.

But, if it difcourfes.of a movabLe:being in matter,\nand that as it is perfealy material, it is then called Natural Phi1ofophy.\nOr, if it fpeaks ofthings converfant in matter intelljgiblc, but not fen-\nfible, as they are the abftratls of matter, .it is named Mathematical or\nAbftraa Philofophy. . Of this fort of fcicnce:the fubjetl is ~antity,\n\u00b7 and is either continued, or difcrete. .If,of' (COntinued quantity, it is\n.ca11ed Geometry, or its fubordinate, PerfpeCl:ive 1 but if the quantity be\n.difcrete, it is then termed Arithmetic,.orits {ubordinate, Mufic. Na-\ntural Philofophy properly fo called, ,treats of terreftrial bodies, either\nfimple or mixed. The fimple ~bodies confift of the four elements,\ncalled Fire, Air, Earth, and Water, which occupy all places, from the\nutmoft and inferior bodies .of {the heavenly matter unto the inmoft ccn-\n\u00b7trc of the earth; \u00b7fo that \u00b7,vacuum no where e:rifts under the cope of\nheaven. The mixed .\\>odies are compounded of thefe four clements, and\n.are divided into animate .-and inanimate bodies. And all animate bodies\nare endued either .with a,vegctivc, .fenfitivc, or rational, faculty. Now,\nwhile we ftudy the.dotlrine of \u00b7this earthly body natural, the fciences of\nGeography, ~Hiftory, and Chronology, naturally flow from it: the firft\nof which defcrib~s .the fituation and boundaries of the different parts of\n-the earth,; ;\u00b7the fecond relates the hiftory of whatever bas been fecn or\ntranfacted ,upon it; and the third computes and adjufts\u00b7all the different\n,zras and _\nportions of time, from the creation of the world to the pre-\u2022\nfent\u00b7bour.

And thefe arc fcverally diftioguia1ed by as many fig-\nnificant Terms as there arc occupations or employments, by the inven-\ntion and ufe of which all thefe things are produced.\nUranology is a Science which treats of the natural body of Heaven\u2022\nafter the fame manner as Geology defcribes that of the Earth ; and fpeak\u2022\neither generally, of the whole Heaven; or fpecially, of fomc particular\nor diftinCl: part of it.

It hath\nalfo affeCtions internal, as Motion and Reft, and Finity and Infinity J\nand the fame external, as Time and Place. Uranology is alfo either\nfpeculative or praclical. Speculative Uranology confifts in the fimplo\nknowledge of the Heavens, either in whole or in part, and of their\nvarious Principles and AffeRions ; and to this purpofe it fpeaks of thefc\nthings either mathematically or naturally. \u00b7 Mathematically, it treats\nof Aftronomy, or Uranometry, which is a fcience that points out the\nmagnitude, meafure, and motion, of the heavens, and of the ftars there-\nin ; aad naturally, it defines the qualities, motions, afpects, and opera-\ntions, of the heavenly Bodies, and all their apparent and infenfible in-\nfluences. PraRical Uranology is that fublime Art, which, being once\nperfeCtly known and rightly underftood, enables a man, by his fkill in\nthe affedions of the Heavens and heavenly Bodies, to unbofom there..\nmoteft tranfactions of futurity, and to trace the myfterious and mod\nobfcure operations ofNatu.re to their fource; whence be defines the in-\nnate principles and virtues of all animal, vegetable, and mineral, fub-\nftances, and- points their refpective ufes, for the lafting profit and, ad\u00b7\nvantage of mankind.\nHaving thus lhcwn what the word Aftrology imports, and arranged its\ncomponent parts by the rules of Science, it will be feen that its colla-\nteral branches are fo extcnfive and multitudioous, that moft men, ofany\n3 learning\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f54 AN ILLUSTRATION\n\u00b7 Jearni:lg or ingenuity at all, are Come way or other converfant in allro-\nlogy, without appearing to know it.

This world com\u00b7prehends both the Heaven and\u00b7\nthe Earth, and is\u00b7compounded of three feparate and diftind: parts, which\nare alfo called Worlds, namely, an Elementary world,. which is the lo.w-\neft in dignity; a Celeftial world, . which is next above the \u00b7elementary l\nand an Etheria.I world, which ia the higheft of all\u00b7; and thefc three lefs\u00b7\nworlds, make the one entire Great World. In the ord~r of Nature, the-\nail-wife and fupreme Being has ordained that every inferior iliould be\ngoverned by its fuperior; and by \u00b7this .eternal decree, the Intellectual\nworld aCluates and governs the Celefiial, which conufts of the fun,\nmoon, and ftars, and all the boil: of heaven ; and the Cclcftial world\nactuates and governs the Elementary world, aod all elementary bodies,\nwhether animal, mineral, or vegetable. .. \u00b7\nThe Elementary world is compofed of the four elements, Fire, Air,\nEarth, and Water, of which all things peculiar to the elementary world\nare generated; but thefe elements, in the fiate wecommonly iind them, are \u00b7 .\n_not pure, bu~intermixed with each other; and they often change one into\nthe other by nature, as fire turns into fmoke, and fmoke into air, and air.\njnto water, &c. Each of thefe elements has likcwife two fpecific qua.\nlities, viz. fire is hot and dry, water is cold and moitl, air is hot and\nmoifi, and the earth is cold and dry ; fo that fire is inimical to water,\nand air to earth. Thefe elements alfo po1fefs three e1fcntial proper-\nties inherent in themfelves, viz\u00b7. air has motion, thinnefs, and darknefs;\n.fire has motion, brightnefs, and thinnefs ; water has motion, darknefs,\nand thicknefs; and earth b\"lS darknefs, thicknefs, and quietnefs ; {o that\nfire is twice more thin than air, thrice more moveable, and four times\nn1ore bright ; air is twice more bright, three times more thin, and four\ntimes more moveable, than water; water is twice more bright, thrice\nmore thin, and four times more moveable, t}lan earth ; as thereforefire is\nto air, fo is air to water, and water to earth; and 'Vice vujiz, as earth is to\nwater, fo is water to air, and air to fire. Three of thefe dements have\nmotion, and are active; but the earth is fixed and paffivc, aod only {up-\nplies matter for the other elements to act upon; for as nothing can be\nproduced unlefs matter be fubminiftered, .fo of neceffity one element\nmuft fubminifter that matter for the operation of the others : and no\ninfluence could be difpenfed by the heavens, unlds there were elementary\nbodies\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f() _\nF A S T ll 0 L 0 G Y. 51\nbodies to receive their infl'uence; therefore every ad:ive principle muft of\nneceffity be in motion, and -every paffive principle muft be at.refi:. And\naccordingly, as the aCtive clements find the earth that thc=y act upon\nto be pure, or impure, fo\u00b7 will the work be that is produced. The\nearth can bring forth nothing of itfelf, but is t-\nhe womb or ~latrix: into .\nwhich the other elements difi:il or projeCt their feminal virtues ; and in\nproportion as it is impregnated by their force and energy, it brings forth,\naccording to the due courfe of nature. The Earth alfo receives the ce4\nJefi:ial rays and influences of all the heavenly bodies, as ordained by God, .\nto be the obj.cd:, fubject, and receptacle of them; whereby it not only\nbrings forth what i-s intended to be produced, but alfo multiplies what,\nit receives, and feparates\u00b7 the good from the bad, and the pure from the\nimpure. It likewife contains the feeds or feminal virtues of all elemen-\ntary bodies, and hath a triplicity in itfelf, viz. mineral, animal,. and ve;. .\ngetiYe. It is the common fountain or mother from whence all things\nfpring, whofe fruitfulnefs is produced by the three-fo!d operation of fire, .\nair, and water. And, \u00b7as thefe elementary bodies poffefs moft extraordi-\nnary qualities, it will be proper to confider each of them diftinttly, and,\nto expJaih their feveral proper_\nties more at large. \u00b7\nFire, the firft active element, is an ehftic body, compofed of infinite..,\nly fmall particles, fcarcely, if at all, adhering.to each other, and a body in.\nmotion. It is in e1fc:Et, the univerfal inftrument of all the motion and_.\naCtion in the univerfe; without fire, all bodies would become immove-\nable, as !n a fevere winter we actually fee our fluids become folid for want.\nof it. Without fire a man would harden into a ftatue, and th\u00b7e very air\nwould cohere into a firm rigid mafs. Fire then is the fole caufe of all.\nmutation or change ; for all mutation is by motion; and all motion by\nfire. -Upon the abfence of only a certain degree of fire, all oils, fats,.\nwaters, wines, ales, fpirits of wine, vegetables, and animals, become,.\nbard, rigid, and inert; \u00b7and the lefs the degree of firt\", the Cooner is this\ninduration made. Hence, if there were the greateft degree of cold, and.\na11 fire was abfolutely taken away, all nature would grow into one con-\ncrete body, folid as gold,. and hard- as diamond; bu,t upon the re-ap-\nplication of fire, it would recover its former mobility. So that upon\nthis one element of fire, depends all fi:uiditf of humours and juices; alfo\nall vegetation, putrefaRion, fermen.ra~ion, animal heat, and a thoufand.\nother things. Fire is in itfelf but one, though it centers in divers places.\nIt centers . in the heavens, and is boundlefs, where it guards and pre--\nferves- nature, aad enlivens all the creation, giving life, light, and mo-\nti<>n, to all creatures, and fUrs theiJl up tQ te~undity and fruitfulnefs.

To afcertain the force and power of fire, the learned Boerhaav.\ne\n\u00b7made innumerable curious experiments, which enabled him to divide it\n\u00b7into fix degrees.. The .fidl degree is that by which nature performs,the\n\u00b7 . \u00b7 office of vegetation in plants, and by which chemiftry imita.tes ami doea\n\u2022the like. This commences f-rom the higheft degree of cold, which in.\nFahrenheit's thermometer is denoted by one~ and ends at eighty degrees.\n<.f,nce .in this. wbo]e interval vegetables of one kind or other give indication\n-of life and .growth\u00b7; fo that if all plants be examined by ,the degrees of\n'heat contained within thefe limits; we flull find all of them come to ma-\n;turity in one or.other of .thefe intermediate degrees. This heat is fuited\n.to extrad:ing \u00b7the native fpirits of.odorifcrous vegetables with oils, as that\n_.\u00b7 of rofes, jeffamio, and \u00b7the like.

This degree 'is alfo\nemployed by chemiO::s to prepare elixirs, volatile alkaline faits, and. tinc-\ntures. The third degree of fire is that which extends from ninety-four\ndegrees of the thermometer to 212 ; at which Jaft, water u(ually boils.\nThis degree is req.uired in. the di(lillation of fimple and compound wa-\nters~ the effential oils of vegetables;. and will coagulate or confolidate the\nferuin, blood, and other animal juices, and confequently deftroy life.\nThe fourth degree of heat may by reckoned from the degree 2 12 to 6oo;.\n\u00b7within which limits all oils,, faline lixivia, mercury, and oil of vitriol, are\u00b7\ndifiilled; lead and tin will alfo melt and mix together., The oils, fahs.,\nand faponaceous Juices,.of animals and vegetables, are rendered volatile and\nacrid, and become more or lefs alcalefceot ;. their folid,parts are calcined.\nand lofe their diftinguHhing qualities :and proper vi,tues;. and with this.\ndegree of fire, foffil fulphur and fal armoniac are fublimed.

For the fenfual, ce-\nldl:ial, part of man, is that whereby we move~ fee, feel, tafle, and fmell,\n.and have a commerce with all material objed:s ; and through thefc the\ninfluences of the divine Nature are conveyed to the more refined and\n{enfible organs. This celeftiel fpirit aHuates and influences the elemen-\ntary dfence, aod flirs it up to the propagation ofits like, and to every other\npurpofe for which Nature defigned it. And this fpirit is evt-n difcoverab!e\nin herbs and ftowers, which open when -the fun rifes, and clofe when he\nfets ; which motion is produced by the fpirit being fenfible of theapproach\nand departure of the fun's influence. Next to thefe, in Man, fuines that\n.pure, etherial, angelic part, called the rational foul; which is a divine\n.light or fiream Bowing immediately from the Great Creator, uniting .\n.Man with God, and raifing him above all other parts of animated na-\nture. This Soul, when once it enters the body, runs parallel \u00b7with\neternity ; ~nd joins in with the celeftial fpirit, through the fphere of the\nplanets; and is conduCted by a divine genius, to an hypoftatical union\nwith the elementaty body ; fo that there exill: two active principles in\nthe body of man to one paffive J and, as the Superior Rules in the celef~\nti~l world are fituated at the time of man's nativity, fo will his conll:i-\nt'Ution and difpofition be framed. And here we derive the caufe of all\nthofeaftonithing variations of temper, difpofition, andconftitution, which\nare.JlOl only peculiar to different fubjeCls, but even to one and the fame\nperfon ; for every o\u00b7ne will bear teftimony of this fact, th'at we find our-\n.{elves fometimes chearful, and at other times melancholy; to-day in perfect\n\u00b7health, and .to-lllPJrow in pain and angui!h; this hour compofed, affa-\n_\nble, and compltlllht, and the next auftere, petulant, and peremptory;\nand thefe contrarieties are evidently produced by the continual refiftance\nand oppofition of the four elements in man's body, which alternately dif- .\n.pofe him tq the various affeCtions difcoverable in human nature. The\n.caufe of this is induced from the natural enmity of the elementary mat-\n.ter.- viz. heat and cold, and drinefs and moifture; each of which occa-\n_fionally predominates in. man's body, according to the motion and infiu-\n.cnce of thofe heaven}y bodies_\n, that rule, govern, and modify, the operation\n.of the four elements, in and upon every terreftrial fubfiance.- Thus it is\nevident, that the underftanding and intelleCtual faculties of Man are form-\ned of the ethereal world; the fenfitive powers of life and aCtion are derived\n-from the celeftial world; and the grofs and corruptible part, the fiefirand\nblood, confifts of the elementary world ; which are all fubordinate the\n\u00b7one to th~ other.

It is only from the primary'Or eKential\n'qUalities of body, its extenfion, and folidity, th~t we form any idea of\nit; and why may we ne>t form the complex idea of a foul or fpirit, frGill\nthe operations of thinking, underftanding, willing, and the like, which\nare experiments in ourfelves ? This idea of an immaterial fubftance is as\nclear as that we .have of a -material one ; for, though the notion of imma.\nterial fubftances may be attended with difficulties, we have no more\nreafon to deny or doubt of its truth, than we have to deny <>~\" doubt\n10f the cxiftence of the body. That the foul is an immaterial fub-\nftancc, a.ppears from hence-that the primary operations of willing and\ntthinking are not only unconnetl:ed with the known properties of body,\n-but (~m \u00b7plainly inconfiftent with fome of its moft effcntial qualities\u2022\n.For :the mind not only difco\\'ers no relation between thinking and the\n\u00b7moti0n and.arrangement of parts; but it' Jikewife perceives, \u00b7thatconciouf-\n.nefs, a fimple ad:, can never proceed from a compounded {ubftanca. c~\npablc of being \u2022divided into many parts.

Hence all machines, ho,vever aruul-\nly \u00b7their parts a:re put toge\u2022her, and however complicated their ftruc-\n\u00b7ture, though we\u00b7conceive innamerable dii\"erent motions, varioufly com-\n\u00b7bined, and running one into another with en endlefs variety, yet ne..\nver produce any thing bu-t figure\u00b7and motion.

Through the medium of this celeftial world, and the. heavenly\nbodies therein contained, the fupreme Being rules, governs, and actuates,\nthe elementary world ; and this is apparent, becaufe that thing which we\nterm obe~ience is only to be found in elementary bodies. And fince mo-\ntion is the caufe of all mutation and change, and as all mo~ion originates\nwith the heavenly bodies, by the revolutions of which even Time itfelf\nis meafured out and divided, fo we find thefe celefi:ial influences prodl:lce\nall the variations of heat and cold, drinefs and moifture, generation and\ncorruption, increafe and decreafe, life and death, and all the. viciflitudes\npf natnre, without even vary'ing themfelves, or being fubjeCl: to the Jeaft\nchange or alteratjon; whilll the elementary bodi,es are perpetually chang-\ning, and never continue in one fray. Hence it is apparent that thecelef-\ntial bodies are a8ive, and the elem~ntary paffive; fo that the celeftial bo-\ndies give the form and fiamp to all the productions of nature, and the ele-\nmentary bodies fubminifier matter to receive this form. And as the pofi-\ntions and affecti-ons of the-heavenly afpects are whc;n this form or framp\nis giYen., and as the quality of the elementary matter 1ha11 be when fubmi-\nniftered, fo will the nature and quality of the fubjeCJ: be, -that receives this\nceleftial form or ftamp. Aod, were it not for this active and paffive prin-\ncip_]e, then would all elementary things be alike, without a poflibility of\nexifiing. It is, therefore, a perfeCl: knowledge of this mediate or celef-\ntial world, its various affections and difpofitions, the nature, tendency,\nand effect, of the luminaries, their motions, afpeds, and pofitions, which -\nenable us to judge of future contingencies, and to difcover the fecret and\n.abftrufe 9perations of nature. \u00b7 But, to attain this knowledge in any com-\npetent degree, we muft trace thefe heavenly intelJieencers through,eut_thc\nwh.ole celeftial\u00b7 regions, and acquaint ourfdves with their general and\n. - e1fential\n,'Ju,.IJ,.-,,~lf) m-f' .\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\u00b7\n,. \u00b7o F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.'.\ndentiat qualitie~.

As much, however, as the human comprehenfion is ab)e to con-\ntain, the Almighty has been gracioufly pleafed to reveal to us in the Scrip-\ntures, by the infpired writers, particularly lfaiah, Ezekiel, and St. John\nthe Divine, who have given us very magnificent defcriptions of the hea-\nvenly manfipns, their ftruClure, apparatus, and angelic attendance.

The felf-exifti\u00b7\n.~nt and original caufe of all things is not a nece1fary agent, but a b~ing en-\ndued .with liberty and choice. , Liberty is a nece1fary coofequent of intel-\nligence.; without liberty, no being can be faid to be an agent, or caufe of\n.any thing; fince to aH necdfarily, is really and properly not to ad: at all,\n_but to be aCted upon.

The will of a being, infinitely knowing and wife, independent and\nall-powerful, can never be influenced by any wrong affection, and can ne-\nver be mifled or oppofed from without; and, therefore, he muft do. al-\nway,s what we know fitteft to be done; that is, he muft _act always ac\u00b7\ncording to the ftritl:eil rules of infinite goodnefs, juftice, and truth, .and\nall other moral perfeCtions; and more particularly, being infinitely and\nneceffarily happy and all-fufficient, he mufi be unalterably difpofed to do\nand to communicate good or \u2022happinefs.\nTo this more abftrufe argument apriQri, for the exiftence of God, we\nmay add another, more generally obvious, and carrying irrefiftible con-\nviction, which is deduced from\u00b7 the frame of the world, and from the\ntraces of evident contrivance and fitnefs of things foe one another that\noccur through all the parts of it. Thefe confpire to prove, that the ma-\nterial worlel, which in its nature is originated and dependent, could not\nhave been the effetl: of chance or neceffity, but of intelJigence and defign.\nThe beautiful, harmonious, and beneficial, arrangement ofthe various bo-\ndies that compofe the material !yftem; their mutual dependence and fub-\nferviency ; the regularity of their motions, and the. aptitude of thefe mo-\ntions for producing the moft beneficial etfed:s ; and many other pheno-\nmena refulting from their relation, magnitude, fituation, and ufe, afford.\nunqueftionable evidences of the creating power and wife difpofal of an in-\ntelligent and almighty agent. The power of gravity, by which the ce-\nleftial bodies perfevere in their revolutions, deferves our particular confi\u2022\nderation. This power penetrates to the centres of the fun and planets,\nwithout any diminution of its virtue, and is extended to immenfe dif-\ntances, regularly decreafing, and producing the moft fenfible and impor-\ntant effects. Its aEtion is proportional to the quant-ity of foJid matter in\nbodies, and not to their furfaccs_. as is ufual irwomechanical caufes; and,\ntherefore, feems to furpafs mere mechanifm. But however various the\nphenomeWl that depend on this power, and may be explained by it, no\nmechanical principles can account for its etfd:ts; much le(s could it have\nproduced, at the beginning, the regular fituation of the orbs, and the pre-\nlent difpofition of things. Gravity could no' havedetermined the planets ,\nto move from weft to eaft, in orbits nearly Qir.~.~lar, almoft in the f~me _\nplane; nor could their power have projeCted t. comets, with all the va-\nriety of their direCtions. If we fuppofe the. matter of the fyftem to be\naccumulated the centre . by its gravity, no mechanical principles, with\nthe affiftance of this power, could feparate the huge and unwieldy mafs\ninto fuch parts as the fun and planets ; and, after CMrying them to their\nditfc;rent diftances, projetl: them in their feveral diredions, preferving fiill\nth~ equality ofaction and re-action, or the ftate of the centre of gravity of\n\u2022 See Clarke's Demonftration of the Being and Attributes of God.\nNo. 4\u00b7 p the\n-oigitized by Coogle\n\f-\n76 .

The fame powers, therefore, which at prefent govern the\nmaterial world, and conduct its various motions, are very different from\nthofe, which were neceffary to ,have produced it from nothing, or to have_\ndifpofed it in the admirable form in which it now proceeds.\n. But we lhould exceed the limits of our plan, if, confining our obferva-\ntion to the earth, our own habitation, we were to enumerate only the\nprincipal traces of defign and wifdom, as well as goodnefs, which are\u00b7dif-\ncernible in its figure and conftituent parts, in its diurnal_\nand annual mo-\ntion, in the pofition of its axis with regard to its orbit, in the benefit\nwhich it derives from the light and heat of the fun, and the alternate vi-\nciffitudes of the feafons; in the atmofphere which furrounds it, and in\nthe different fpecies and varieti('s of vegetables and animals with which\nit is repl~ni.fued. No one can furvey the vegetable produaions of the\nearth, fo various, beautiful, and ufeful, nor the various gradations of ani-\n.mal life; in fuch a variety of fpecies, all preferved diftinet, and propa-\ngated by a fettled law,-each fitted to its own element, provided with pro-\nper food, and with inftinets and organs fuited to its rank and fituation,\n~nd efpecially with the powers of fenfation and felf-motion, and all more\nimmediately or remotely fubfervient to the government and ufe of man,\nwithout admiring the fkill and defign of the original Former. But thefe\nare more fignally manifefted in the ftrueture of the human frame, and in\nthe noble powers and capacities of the human mind; more efpecially in\nthe -moral principles and faculties, which are a diftinguilhing part of our\nconftitution, and lead to the perception and acknowledgement of the ex-\niftence and government ofGod. In thofe inftances that have now been\nrecited, and a variety of imilar inftances fuggeiled by them, or naturally\noccurring to the notice of the curious and retletling mind, contrivance is\nmanifeft, and immediately, without any nice or fubtle reafonin&, fuggefts\na contriver~ It ftrikes us like a fenfation ; and artful reafonings againft\nit may puzzle us, without \u00a3baking our belief. No perfon, for example,\nthat knows the principles o~ optics, and the ftructure of the eye, can\noelieve that it was formed without fkill in that fcience; or that the ear\nwas formed without the knowledge of founds; or \u00b7that tile male and fe..\nmale, created and preferved in due proportion, were not formed for each\nother, and for continuing the fpecies. All our a~counts of nature are full\nof inftances of this kind. The admirable and beautiful ftruclure of\nthings for final caufes exalts our idea of the contriver; and the unity of\ndefign iliews him to be one. The great motions in the fyftem, performed\nwith the fame facility as the leaft, fuggeft his ~}mighty power, which\ngave motion to the earth and the celeftial' bodies with equal eafe as to\nthe minuteft particles; the fubtility of the motions and a..:tions in the\ninternal\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\u00b7 0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\n'\n77\ninternal parts of bodies, Olewt that his influence. penetrates-the inmoft\nrecdfes of things, and that he is equally aclive and prefent ev~ry where.\nThe fimplicity of the laws that prevail in the world, the excellent difpo-\nfition of things, in order to obtain the heft ends, and the beauty which\nadorns the works of nature, far fuperior tc;\u00bb any thing in art, fuggeft his .\nconfummate wifdom.

We know\nthat the higheft c<;>nceptions we are able to form of them are lUll beneath\nhis real perfections; but his dominion o.ver us, and our duty towards him.\narc abundantly \u2022 manifeft.\nAnother fubftantial argument to prove the exiftence of God, as the\ncreator and governor of the univerfe, may be deduced from the univerfal\nconft:nt of mankind, and the uniform tradition of this belief through\nevery nation and every age; it is impoffible to conceive, that a fallacy.\nfo perpetual and univerfal, thould be impofed oa the united rcafon of man- .\nkind. No credible and fatisfactory account can be given of this univerfal .\nconfent, without afcribing it to the original conftitution of the human\nmind, inconftquence of which it cannot fail to difcern the exiftence of a\nDeity, arid to the undeniable traces of his being, which his works afford.\nFear, ftate- policy, and the prejudices of education, to which the concur- \u00b7\nrenee ofmankind in this principle bas been fometimes refolved, are founded\non this univerfal pFinciple, {uppofe its being an influence, and are actuated\nby it. It is much more reafonable to imagine, that the belief of a God\nwas antecedent to their operation, than that it thould have been produced\nby .them; and that it was didated by reafon and confcicnce, independent\nof the paffion and policy of men. The uniform and univerfal tradition\nof this belief, and of the creation of the world by the divine power, af-\nfords concurring evidence both of the principle and of the tact\u00b7.

In proof\nof this, the hifiory of Mofes, cpnfidered merelyas the moft ancient hifto-\nrian, deferves particular regard. His tefiimony is confirmed by the moft\nancient writers, among the heathens, both poets and hiftorians. It may\nbe alfo fairly alledged, that we have no hiftory or tradition more ancient\nthan that which agrees with the received opinion of the world's begin-\nning, and of the manner in which it was produced ; and that the moft\nan_fient hiftories were wr~tten long after that time. And this confidera-\ntion is urged by Lucretius, the famous Epicurean, as a ~lrong prefump-\ntion that the world had a beginning: t..-w\n...\u00b7---\n- Si nulla fuit genitalis origo .\nTerrar-\num-& c~li, femperque :,Eterna fuere:\nCur fupra bellum Thebanum, & funera Trojre)\nNon alias alii quoque res cecinere poetre?\nBefides, the origin and progrefs of learning, and the moft ufeful arts,\nconfirm the notion of the world's beginning, and of the common :era of\nits creation ; to which alfo may. be added, tpat the ~orld itfelf, being\nmaterial and .corruptible, muft have had a beginning; and many pheno-\nmena occur to the obfervation of the aftronomer and mathematician,\nwhich furnith a ftrong prefumption, that it could have had no long du-\nration, and that it now gradually tends to dHfolution. From thefe con-\n:fiderations we may infer the abfolute being and providence of God;\nwhich alfo detnonftrate the exiftence of his angels and miniftring fpirits,\nwho are the meffengers of his will, and tb\u00b7e proper inhabitants of the\nethereal wo~ld, ahd confequently the next fubjeds of our enquiry.\nAn Angel is. a fpiritual intelligent fubftance, and the firft in rank and\ndignity of all created beings; though the word .Angel, A'n\u2022'-oc, is not pro-\nperly a denomination of nature, but of office; denoting a mejftnger, or\nexecutioner of the wiJl of fome fuperior power or authority. In this fenfe\nthey are frequently mentioned in Scripture, as miniftring fpirits fent by\nthe Almighty to declare his will, and to correCt, teach, rewove, and com-\nfort. God alfo promulgated the law to Mofes, and appeared to- the old\npatriarchs by the mediation of angels, who reprefented him, and \u00b7fpoke\nin his name\u00b7~ The exifi:ence of angels is admitted iq all religions ; the\nGreeks and ~atins acknowledged them under the names of genii .and\ndemons; and in the Alcoran we find frequent mention of them; the\nprofeffors of the Mahometan religion affigned them various orders and\ndegrees, as well as different employments, b_oth in heaven and on earth.\nThe Sadducees alfo admit their exiftence: witnefs Abufaid, the author of\nan Arabic verfion of the Pentateuch; and Aaron, a Caraite Jew, i~ his\ncomment ~n the Pentateuch; both extant in manufcrip_\nt in the king of\nFrancc'\"s library. The heathen philofophers and poets were alfo agreed as\nto the exiftence of intelligent beiogs, fuperior to man; as it iliewn by\nSt.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S\u00b7 T R '() L 0 G Y. 19\n~st. Cyprian, in his treatife on the vanity of idols, from the tefi:imonies\n.of Plato, Socrates, and TrifmegHlus. Authors are not fo unanimous\nabout their nature as of their exiftence ; Clemens Alexandrinus believed\nthey \u00b7bad bodies, which was alfo the opinion of Origen, C:efarius, Ter40\ntu11ian, and feveral others; but Athanafius, Batil, Gregory, Nicene,\nCyril, and Chryfoftom, hold them to be mer.e fpirits. Authors\nare alfo divided as to the time of the creation of angels ; fome will have\nit to have been before the creation of our world, or ever from eternity;\nwhile others maintain that they were created at the fame time with our\nworld. The moll: probable conjetlure is, that they were created at dif..\nferent periods, whenever it pleafed the Almighty to call thein into ex:..\ni'ftence. But, though we cannot (o clearly demonftrate the precife nature\nand duration of angels, we may neverthelefs conclude, that, though they\nare of an order highly fuperior \u00b7to that of men, yet are they not complete\nand perfect; for, had they been created thus originally, they could not\nhave fallen, as Adam did, nor have finned, which the fcriptures inform\nus fome of them did, by rebelling againft the Almighty, and in contend40\ning with him for fupreme authority. For this reafon, as they are them..\nfelves imperfeH beings, they can in no one refpetl be confidered proper\nobjects of human adoration, which we are bound to pay alone to that\nONE SuPREME, who is omnipotent, immortal, infinite, the fource and\ncentre of every thing that is great, _\nand good, and perfect.\nTheo1ogi11:s hav~ divided angels into different ranks or fubordinations,\nwhich they term Hierarchies, from uco,, holy, and \"'PiC'I\u2022 rule, 6gnifying,\nholy command, or to rule in boly things. Dionyfius and other ancient\nwriter& have efi:ablithed nine choirs or orders of thefe ce1eftial fpirits,\nnamely, feraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers,\nvirtues, angels, and archangels; and thefe they form into three Hierarchies,\nappointing them .their refpeaive offices in the performance of adoration\nand praife, and in executing the word and will of God. The Rabbins\nand JewHb writers, who had obvioutly a more immediate knowledge of\nthe angelic hoft, by the infpiration of their prophets, and the revelation \u00b7\nof God's tr.ue relig\u00b7ion, have defined one rank of angels, or intelligent\nbeings, fuperior to all the foregoing, which anfwer to or are contained in\nthe ten diftinguHhing names of God, and are the pure effences of his\nfpirit~ or ftream though which his will and pleafure is cornmnnicated\nto the angels and bletfed fpirits, and through which his providence extends\nto the care 3nd proteaion of all his works. The firft of thefe divine ef40\nfences is denominated mrr, jehovah, and is peculiarly attributed to God\nthe Father, being the pure and fimple effence of the Divinity, flowing\nthrough Hajotb Hakados to the angel Metratton, and to the minifi.ering\nfpirit Refchith Hagalalim, who guides the primum mobile, and beftows\nthe gift of being upo.n all things.

A T I 0 N\nAN ASTRONOMICAL SURVEY of the CELESTIAL WORLD~\nwith the Places, Order, and Motions, of the HEAVENLY BoDIEs.\nIT was formerly a fubjed: of difpute among Pbilofophers, whether the\nearth or the Sun was the centre of the celeftial fyftem ; but the latter\nopinion has been generally received fince the time of Copernicus, who aboU't\nthe year 1543 publitbed his fix books De Orbium Cwleftium Revolu-\ntionibus, wherein he proves the Sun to be very near the centre ofgravity of\nthe whole fyftem, and in the common focus of. every one of the planetary\norbits. Next the Sun, Mercury performs his revolution around him 1\n. next to Mercury is the orbit of Venus; and next to Venus, our earth,\nwith its attendant or fecondary the Moon, perform a joint courfe, and by\ntheir revolution meafure out the annual period. Next to the earth is\nMars, the firft of the fuperior planets: next to him it Jupiter; and, Iaft\nof all, Saturn. Thefe and the comets are the conftituent parts of the\nCppernican or folar fyftem, which is now received and approved as the\nonly true one, becaufe moft agreeab,le to the tenor of nature in all her ac-\ntions; for, by the two motions of the earth all the phenomena of the\nheavens are refolved, which by other hypothefes are inexplicable without\na great number \u00b7ofother motions contrary to philofophical reafoning. It\nis alfo more rational to \u00b7fuppofe that the earth moves round the Sun, than\nthat the huge bodies of the planets, the ftupendous' body of the Sun, and\nthe immenfe firmament of ilars, ihould all move round the earth ever1\ntwenty-four hours. The harmony which runs through the folar fyftem\n\u00b7wonderfully confirms this hypothefis, viz. that the motions of all the\nplanets, both primary and fecondary, are governed and re~ulated by one\nand the fame law, which is, that the fquares of the per1odical times of\nthe primary planets are to each other as th~ cubes oftheir diftances from\nthe Sun; and likewife the fquares of the periodical times of the feconda\u00b7\nries of any primary are to each other as the cubes of their diftances froru\nthat primary. Now the Moon, which.., in the Copernican fyftem, is a fe.\ncond.ary of Jhe earth, in the other hypothefis is confidered as a primary\n\u00b7one; and fo the ru)c cannot take place, becaufe the periodical time ftated\nas that ofa primary one does not agree therewith. But this fingle confi-\nderation is fufficicnt to eftabliih the motion of the earth for ever! viz. if\nthe earth does. not move round the Sun, the Sun muft move with the\nMoon round the earth. Now, the diftance of the Sun to that of the\n\u00b7 Mo.on being as Io,ooo to 46, and the Moon's period being lefs than twen-\u00b7\nty-eight days, the Sun's period wouJd be found no lefs than two hundre-\naod forty~two years; whereas, in fad, it is but one year. The Sun altv\nbeing the fountain of light and heat, ~hich it irradiates through all the\n1 . !yftcm\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\ntyll:em, it mull: of courfe be placed in the centre, in order that the planets\nmay at all times have it in an uniform and equable manner. For, if the\nearth be fuppo-fed in the centre, and the Sun and planets revolve about it,\nthe planets would then, like- th~ comets, be fcorched with heat when\nneareft the Sun, and frozen with cold in their aphelia, or gre~teft diftance;\nwhich is not to be imagined. But, if the Sun be fuppofed in the centre\nof the fyftem, we then have the rational hypothefis of the planets being all\nmoved round the Sun, by the univerfal law or power of gravity arifing\nfrom his vaft body, and every thing will anfwer to the laws of circular\nmotion and central forces; but otherwife we are wholly in the dark, and\nknow not how to define thefe operations of nature. Fortunately, however,\nwe are able to give not only reafons, but demonA:rable proofs, that the Sun\ndoes poffefs the centre of the (vftem, and that the planets move about\nhim in the order above-mentioned. The fir(\\; is, that Mercury and Ve-\nnus are ever obferved to have two conjund:ions with the Sun, but no op-\npofition, which could not happen unlefs the orbits of thefe planets lay\nwithin the orbit of the earth. The fecond is, that Mars, Jupiter, \u00b7and\nSaturn, have each their conjunctions and oppofitions to the Sun alternately\nand fucceffively, which could not be unlefs their orbits were exterior to\nthat of the earth. In the third place, the greateft elongation or diftance\nof Mercury from the Sun is about twenty degrees, and that of Venus\nforty-feven degrees; whiCh anfwers exaHiy to their diftance in this fyf.\ntem; but, in the other, they would be feen one hundred and eighty de-\ngrees from the Sun, in oppofition to him. Follrthly, in this difpofition\nof the planet~, -they will all of them be fometimes much nearer to the earth\nthan at others; the confequence of which is, that their brightnefs and\nfplendour. and alfo their apparent diameters, will be proportionally grea-\nt-\ner at one time than another; and this we obferve to be true every day.\nThus, the apparent dia~tcr of Venus, when greateft, is near fixty-fiJ:\nfeconds, but, when leaft, not more than nine and a half; of Mars, when\ngreatefi, it is twenty-one feconds, but, when leaA:, no more than two fe-\nconds and a half; whereas, by the other hypothefis, they ought always\nto be equal. The fifth is, that, when the planets. are viewed with a goon.,.\ntelefcope, they appear with diffi:rent phafes, or with different parts of\ntheir bodies enlightened. Thus Venus is fometimes new, then horned,\nand afterwards dichotomized, then gibbous, afterwards full, and {o en-\ncreafes and decreafes her light in the fame manner as the Moon, and as\nthis fyftem requires. Th~ fixth proof is, that the planets, all of them,\ndo fometimes appear direct in motion, fometimes retrograde, and at other\ntimes ftationary. Thus, Venus, as 1hc paffes from her greateft elongation\nweftward to her greateft elongation eaftward, will appear direct in mo-\ntion, but retrograde as 1he paffes from the latter to the former; and,\nwhen the is in thofe points of greateft diftance from tae Sun, the feems\nNo. 4\u2022 .. \u00b7 \u00b7 R for\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAN\u2022 ILLUSTRATION\nfor fame time fiationary; all which is neceifary upon the Copernican by..\npothefis, but cannot happen in ~ny o,ther. The feventh is, that the ~a\u00ad\ndies of Mercury and Venus, in their low conjunCtions with the Sun, are\nhid behind the Sun's body, and in the upper conjunCtions are feen. to\np~fs over the Sun's body, or difk., in form ofa black round fpot, which is\nneceffary in the Copernican fyft~m, but impoGible in any other. The\neighth is, that the times in which thefe conjuntlions, oppofitions, fta..\ntions, and retrogradations, of the planets happen a.re not fuch as -they\nwould be ifthe earth were at reft in its orbit, but precifely fuch as\nwould happen were the earth to move round the Sun, and all the other\nplanets i~ the periods affigned them; and therefore this, .and no .other,\ncan be the true fyftem of the world.\nBut, the better to determine the ph~es of the celeftial bodies, end to\nunderftand the conftitution of the heavens more clearly, afi:ronomers have\nconceived Qr defcribed feveral circles, called the circles of the .fphere, by\nwhich the cclefi:ial world is divided and meafured out. Sam\u00b7e of thefe\nare called great circles, as the equinotl:ial, ecliptic, meridian, &c. and\nothers fmall circles, as the tropics, parallels, &c. The equinoctial line\nis a circle which we imagine to invefi: the whole world, and is fo caJied,\nbecaufe, whenever the Sun, in his progrefs through the ecliptic, come~ to\nthis circle, it makes equal days and nights all round the globe, as he\nthen rifes due eaft, and fets due weft, which he .never docs at any other\ntime of the year. This equinoCtial line is conceived .to be three hundred\nand' fixty degrees in its whole circumference ; and each of thefe degrees\nr\njs divided into fixty minutes, or fixty equal parts of a degree, and thefe\nagain into as many teconds. The meridian is another great circle, con-\nfifting alfo ofthree hundred and uxty degrees, extending from one polar\npoint to the other, and twice cutting the equinuctialline, compaffing the\n.whole world from north to fouth, as the equinoB:ial does from caft to\nweft, and terminates at the fame point where it began. The equinottial\nline is fixed and immutable, and is of neceffity always conceived to be\nin one and the fame place; but the meridian. is mutable, and may circle\n:the world in any or in all degrees of the equator, as we may bav.e occa6on\nto conceive or imagine; it muft, however, uniformly divide the fphere\ninto two equal parts, which are called hemifpheres. The. polar -points\nare thofe two points in the immenfe ball of the world which are equi-\ndiftant from the equinoaial line,..the one in the utmoft northern, and the\nother in the utmoft fouthern, point. The three hundred and flxty degrees\n.ofthe equinodialline are called the longitude of the world, becaufe they\n.are in order as -the Sun and ftars move in their circuits throagh the fpaci-\n\u00b7ous heavens in their refpeHive orbs. But the three hundred and fixty de-\n,grees .of the meridian .are called the latitude of the world, becaufc\" they\n\u00b7. mete\nDigitized by GoogI\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nmete out that diftance wherein the Sun and all the ftars, in a certain\nbreadth one -from another, move in their circuits from eaft to weft.\nNow the Sun, in his annual progrefs from weft to eaft, does not keep\nthe equinoCtial line, but declines from it at one part of. the year to the\n\u00b7 north, and at another part of the year to the fouth; and the planets alfo .\nobferve the fame order in their progrefs, except that the Sun always keeps\nthe fame conftant t~ack, whereas the planets often vary in their declina-\ntions from the equinoflial Jine. Hence another great circle is conceived\nin the heavens, called the Zodiac, which is likewife divided, as all the\ngreat circles are, into three hundred and fixty degrees ; but this circle\u00b7\nbeing as it were the high road of the planets, and comprehending fo much\nof the heavens as the Sun and planets fwerve in their declinations, is con-\nceived to be twenty degrees\u00b7broad; and it is confined to this fpace, be-\ncaufe none of the planets ever reach beyond ten degrees north, or ten de-\ngrees fouth, from the equinoClialline; and the Sun's path or track in the\nZodiac is caJled the ecliptic line, becaufe the eclipfes only happen when\nthe Moon is alfo in this line.\nThe Zodiac is alfo divided into twelve equal parts, called the twelve\nSigns, or hot!fts o\/hetrVen ; and, thefe beginning where the Sun enters the\nequinoctial to the northward, the firft fign is named Aries, and the reft\nin order are called Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio11\nSagittarius, Capricornus, Aquaries, and Pifces. Thefe figns confift of\nthirty degrees each; and, being all of them divided into four equal parts,\ndetermine the four {eafons of the year. Now, when the Sun enters into\nthe 6gn calJed Cancer, he is in his greateft north declination, and at that\ntime is diftant from the equinoctial line twenty-three degrees to the\nnorth; which occafions another circle to be defcribed, calle~ the tropic .\nof Cancer, the centre of which being the no\u00b7rth pole, it comprehends\nas much of the extremity of the round .world as falls under twenty-\nthree degrees and a half from the equator to the northward. And, when\nthe Sun enters the fign Capricornus, he is in his utmoft fouth decli\u2022\nnation, and occafions another cir~le to be defcrib.ed, called the tropic\nof Capricorn, as many degrees from the equator to the fouth as the\notlier tropic is to the north. At the difiance of forty-five degrees from\neach of thefe tropics two other circles are imagined, called the artlic,\nand antarctic circles, which, being but little more than twenty degrees \u00b7\ndiftant from each pole, \u00b7do likewife encircle Come fmall portion af the\nextremities of the world. The inferior circles, called parallels, run\nfrom eafr to weft, a~d ferve to divide the heavens into f~veral tpaces :be-\ntween the greater circles.\nAndent\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\u2022\n86 AN ILL-USTRATI-ON\nAncient tradition has handed down to us the origin of that important\ncircle called the Zodiac, with the reafon why it is fo named, and the inge-\nnious method which the firft men made ufe of to know exactly the line\nwhich the Sun defcribes under the heavens in the perpetual chang.ings of\nits place, and to divide the year into equal portions. This tradition 6\nfound in two ancient authors, the one Roman, the other Greek. The\nfirft attributes it to the Egyptians; the other, to the firft inhabitants of\nChaldea. They every day faw the Sun and the whole heavens turning\nand, paffing from eaft to weft. In the mean time they obferved that the\nSun, by a mt tion peculiar to it, from day to day receded from fome cer-\ntain ftars, and took its place under others, always advancing towards the\neaft. Whilft the Moon was making twelve times that revolution, the\nSun made it only once; but file began the thirteenth again before the\nSun had as yet completed its own. The habit of dividing the year into\npretty near twelve lunations made them wi(h :that they had twelve divi-\nfaons of a year perfeCtly equal, or.twelve months, which might be exaClly\n\u00b7equivalent to the year itfelf, and which might, as it were, be pointed at\nwith one's finger in the heavens, by !hewing fome certain ftars under which\nthe Sun paffes during every one of thefe months. \u00b7 Here is then the me\u2022\n\u00b7thod in which they divided the courfe of the Sun in twelve equal portions\nor colleEHons of fiars, which are called afterifms or conftellations. Our\n.aftronomers took a couple of brafs open ve1fels,\u00b7 the one pierced at the\nbottom, and the other without any orifice below. Having ftopped the\n. hole of the firft, they filled it with water, and placed it fo as that the wa-\n.ter might run out into the other vefl\"el the moment-the cock fuould be\n\u00b7opened. This done, they obferved in that part of the heaven where the\nSun has its annual courfe the rifing of a fiar remarkable either for its\n.magnitude or brightnefs; and, at the critical inftant it appeared on the\nhorizon, they began to let the water flow out of the upper ve!fel into. the\nother during the reft of the night, and the whole following day, to the\nvery moment when the fame ftar, being come to the eaft again, began to\n.appear anew on the horizon. The inftant it was again feen, they took\naway the under veffel, and threw the water that remaineci in the other\non 'the ground. The obfervers were thus fure of having one revolution\n\u00b7of the whole heaven between the firft rifing of the ftar and its return.\nThe water, which had flowed during that time, might then afford them\na means of meafuring the -duration ot one whole revolution of the heaven,\nan'd pf dividing that duration into feveral equal portions,; fince, by dividing\nthat water itfelf into twelve equal parts, they were fure of having the re-\nW:~Iution of a twelfth part of the heaven during the efHux of a twelfth\npart of the water; they then divided the water of the under vdfd int0\ntwelve parts perfeClly equal, and prepared two other fmall ve1fels capable\nof containing exaaly one of tho\u00a3'e portions, and no\u00b7 more. They again\n1 ' _poured\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f-o F A S T R. \u00b7o L G 0 Y.\npoured into the great upP.er velfel the twelve parts of water aU at once,\nkeeping the vefTels thut. Then they placed under the cock, 1\\ill ibut,\none of the two fm'llll ve1fels, and another near it to fucceed the Iirft as\nfoon as it lhould be full.\nAll thefe preparations being 'Peady, they, the next night, obferved that\npart of the heaven towards which they had for a long while remarked that\nthe Sun, the Moon, and the planets, took their courfes, and (hid for the\nrifing of the conftellation which is fince calJed Aries. The Greeks, per-\nhaps, gave that name to fome ftars different from thofe which went by lt\nbefore the flood; but this enquiry is not nece1fary at prefent. The in-\nftant Aries appeared, and they faw the firft ftar of it afcending, they lefl\nthe water run into the little meafure. As foon as it was full, they re\u2022\nmoved it, and threw the water out. In the mean time they put the other\nempty meafure under the fall. They obfetved exad1y, and fo as to re-\nmember very weU, all the ftars that rofe during all the periods which the.\nmeafure took in fiJJing ; and that part of the heaven was terminated in\ntheir obfervations by the ftar which appeared the laft on the horizon the\nmoment the meafure was juft full: fo that, by giving the two little vcil\"els\nthe time nece1fary to be alternately filled .to the brim three times each\nduring the night, they h3d, by that means, one half of the .courfe of the\nfun in the heaven, that is, one half of the heaven itfelf; and. that half\nagain was divided into fix equal portions, of which they might ihew at1d\n\u2022 \u00b7 diftinguilh the beginning, the dliddle, and the en){, by ftars, which, fran\\.\ntheir fize, humber, or order, were rendered tiiftinguiihable. As to the\n6ther half of the be;tven, and the fix other ~;c>nftelladons whi~h the fuai\nruns over therein, they were fbrced to defer the obfervation of them to\nanother feafon. They waited till the fun, being placed in the midtlle oF\nthe now known and obferved conftellations, lhould leave them at liberty\nto fee the other during the night. \u00b7\n.\nDotibtlefs, fome precautions were neeeffary, not to iriifta1te 4a to the\n\u00b7 fall of the water, which mull: flow more flowly in ptopdrtion as itS mafs\nis lefs high\u2022.

When men, after the fctting\nof the Sun, faw the ftars of the \u00b7fign Aries afcend the oppofite horizon,\n. and diftant from the Sun by one halt\u00b7 pf the h~avcn, they ~h:n knew that .\n\u00b7 ilie\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAN tLLUSTR.AT'ION\nthe fun was under the fign Lib~ which, being the feventh of the celef..\ntial figns, was diftant from ,the fidl: by one whole half of the Zodiac.-\nWhen at the approach of day they faw in the middle of the heaven, and\nat an equal difi:ance from eafi: and wefi:, the fineft ftar of the fign Leo, they\neafity underftood that the fun, then ready to rife, was at the diftance of\nthcee fign' from Leo, and removed towards the eaft one quarter part o'f its\ncircle. Thus, without feeing the \u00b7ftars which the fun drowned\u00b7 by his\nhrightnefs as he came under them, they {aid, with a perfect a1furance, that\nthe fun is now in Scorpio ; two months hence we fuaU have the lhorteft\n' day. 1 hey could, on fight of a fingle confte1lation, placed in the eaftern,\nor middle, or we(lern, part of the heaven, immediately fay where the fl!n\nwas, how far the year was advanced, and what kind of work it was fit\nthey ibould bufy themfc:lves about. After this manner fuepherds and\nfarmers ftill regulate their works; and, if we at prefent are now ignorant\nof the ftars, if we are not able to determine the diftance between one\n.eoniellation thewn us and the aaual place of the fun, it is becaufe we\ncan read and write. The firft men perufed the \u00b7heavens for want of writ-\ning; and it is on account _of tbe conveniency of writing that the gene-\nrality of men now difpenfe with looking among the ftars for the know-\u00b7 .\nledge of the operations and order of the year. But writing itfelf, that\nfo ufeful inventi~n, is one of the produCts of afironomy; and it may be\n.. eafily {hewn alfo, that the names given the twelve celefiial figns gave birth\nto the in-vention both of painting and writing. The hiftory of the heavens\nftill promifes further novelty, and it will continue to inform us of the\nhelps Jor which we are indebted to the ftudy of nature.\nNow, merely to know and to under~nd thofe divifions of the heavens\nis nothing more than fpeculative aftrology, commonly called Aftronomy;\nbut, t~ attain to the knowledge of t\\.ftrology in general, we muft be con-\nve,.nt i~ ':he ajfdlions and qualities ofthe heavenly matter, and of the pla-\nnets and fixed tlars. It is generally imagined that the fixed ftars are faft.\nened in the eighth orb of the celeftial heaven, and only mo.ve as that orb\ndoth, and uniformly together, about one minute's fpace in a. whole year;\nbut reafon has not abfolutely determined this point, fo as to leave it quite\nf.ltisfactory, or incontrovertible. The fixed frats are ob{erved t~ differ\nfrom the planets by their twinkling or !parkling; whence philofophers\nhave conceived them to thine with their own innate light, the fame as the\nfun\u00b7 does. The number of ftars difcoverable in either hecnifphere is\nnot above a thoufand. This at firft may appear incredible, becaufe they\nfcem to be without number; but the deception arifes from our looking\nconfufedly upon them, without reducing them into any order\u2022.

The Britilh catalogue, which, befides the ftars vilible\nto the naked eye, includes a great number which cannot be feen without\nthe affifiance o'f a telefcope, contains no more than three thoufand in both\nhemifpheres.

The nearer they are fituated to the ecliptic line, and\nthe zodiac. fo much the apter are they to operate in the common acts\nof nature; and fo much the m,pre eafily allured into the opportunities\nof our acquaintance. Of the firft magnitude we \u00b7have extraordinary in..\nfiances of that fiar in Leo, called Cor Leoni's, in twenty-five degrees of the\nfign, to be of the nature of Mars and Jupiter mixed together .; and is a\nftar greatly contributing to noble qualifications, and kingly favour. Fa-\nmous alfo is the knowledge of Spica Pi'rginis, a ftar of Virgo by conftella-\ntion, but in thefign Libra: this ftar partakes both of the nature ofVenus\nand Mars, and contributes greatly to ecclefiaftical preferments. After\nthefe are very well known the ftars called .4\/Jeoarr;n in Gemini, and\n\u00b7 J!ntare1\n\/\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fI\n94 AN ILLUSTRATION\nAntares in Sagittary, both ftars of the nature of Mars, provoking to\ncourage and magnani'mity, but inclining to violence and cruelty. Of\nthe fecond magnitude are the \u00b7South Balanct, and the Head qf Pollux,\nboth ftars of a furious and violent nature. Of the third rnagnitud~,\nthe Head qfMedtiftl, or Algol, is famous for its mifchievous inclinations ;\nand fo are the two 4\/fes, ftars of the fourth magnitude. Of the fifth\nmagnitude are the Pleiades, ftars of remarkable influence, and celebrated\nfor their fweet and benevolent nature. Stars of the fixth magnitude\nare very fmall ; yet, notwjthll:anding this, they are 'not withuut their\noperations upon earthly things ; as in the breafi: of the Crab, called\nPrteflpe, are feveral little ftars which appear only like a white cloud,\nand yet the force of this confte1lation has been often felt in the affairs\nof mankind. Thefe fixed fi:ars alfo often prove thei-r force in the change.\nof weather, as they happen to riie, culminate, or fet, with the fun,\nmoon, and planets.\nBut the conftellations which form the twelve figns of the zodiac have\nobvioufly the moil: powerful and mofr immediate operation upon man;\nand the reafon is, becaufe they form the pathway of the fun, moon, and\nplanets, in all their peregrinations, and thereby receive from them a\nmore forcible power and energy. And, as thefe .figns 'f.orm a confiderable\npart of the Science of Aftrology, we ihall confider .them under all their.\nvarious qualities and atfeBions, both with refped to\u00b7their operations upon\nman's body and upon the four feaf.ons of the year. Theie figns are\nknown or dittinguifhed by the following characters : ..\n\"\" Aries !!l5 Cancer ~ Libra IJ:t> Capricornus\n~ Taurus .n. Leo nt Scorpio = Aqua-ries\nn Gemini 191. Virgo .t Sagittarius * Pifceb\"'\u00b7\nThey are placed in this order, and divided. into fo;Pr equal parts, an-\n{wering to the four quarters of the year, becaufe the equator cuts and\ndivides the circle of the zodiac at the point beginning with Aries, and ar\nthe oppofite point of Libra, dividing the .whole into two equal parts,\nconfill:ing of fix northern and fix fouthern figos. But the renfon why\nthe fun's courfe be-gins and is reckoned from Aries is, as tradition in-\nforms us, becaufe the fun, when fidl: brought into exill:ence, was\nplaced in this fign. And this is not an onreafonable conjeCture, fince\nthe fpring quarter ~begins when the Sun enters Aries, and brings with\nit increafe and length of drty.s, ana all nature begins .to .wulti,ply and\nflo.urilh, and, as it were, to rite into new life. The fix nor.thern figns\nterminate with Virgo, and the .\nfix fouthern commence wit)l Libra; but\nthe northern figns <\nhave always been c:;Qllfidered of a more etlicac.ious and\nnoble nature than the fouthern.\nPhilofophers\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f. \\\n0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 9S\nPhilofophers have alfo affign~d another reafon for this order and di-\nvifion of the twelve figns ofthe zodiac, namely, That Nature works by\noppofition and contrariety, and thus brings about the four ftates of all\nelementary bodies, viz. generation, confervation, corruption, and anni-\nhilation. As therefore generation is the firft ftate, and is produced and\nnourHhed by beat, they begin with the fiery flgn Aries. The next\nquality being confervation, or durabiHty, they fignify the fame by\nplacing an earthy fign next in order, fince earth gives permanency and\nfixation to corruptible bodies. The third quality being corruptible,\nit is reprefented by an airy fign, becaufe air is known to be the fourcc\nof putrefaaion. The laO: ftate of an elementary body is its final end,\nor diffolution ;\u00b7 and, as wat~r di1folves all corruptible bodies, fo have\nthey defcribed it by placing a watery fign the laft of all. In this ar-\nrangement of the figns of the zodiac we may further obferve, that two\n\u00b7 paffive principles are placed between two aCl:ivc ones; and, as our all-\nwife .Creator hath fo conftructed. nature, that the oppofition of one\nthing 1hould occafion the exiftcnce or duration ofa~other, fo we may\nobferve it in the divifions of the zodiac ; .for infrance, Aries, a fiery fign,\nis placed oppofite to Libra, which is an airy fign; and in all refpects\nrefembles a man fitting before afire with a pair of bellows in his hands,\nblowing to keep it burning: for, without air, fire is foon cxtingui1hed.\nIn the fame mann~r it is with the water and the earth J but, to make\nthefe obfervations more ~pparent, we will arrange the figns of the zodiac\nunder all their different qualities and forms.\nThe Divifions of the Twelve S I G N S of the Z 0 D I A C.\nSigns oppofitc arc the{\u00a5 ~ u \u2022 a tiJt Northern and commanding.\nlirft fix to the laft fix: 6 \"1. .t J:t =M Soutnocn and obeying.\nThey are divided alfo accordingl~ie~~ \u00a5a~ ~~~an~ddry.\nto their four 'Triplicities and A~r Y lS fiJI.

The ufe of which is; that. if\nthe principal fignificator in a nativity be pofited in the degrees and .figns\nrnafculine, be the native male or female, it argues, that be or 1he lhall\ninherit a more mafculine temper and refolution than ordinary. But, if\nthe fignificator be in. feminine figns and degrees, then the native will be\nmore effeminate, timid, and lefs robuft.

The fifth column lhews that there are degrees termed dark or\nolfcure; and, whenever thefe happen to be horofcopical in a nativity, they\ndeclare the native to be of a.dark or fallow complexion, and, if he lhould\nbe bor.n deformed, his d~formity will be confiderably greater. The fixth\ncolumn thews which degrees of the zodiac are called Jmoky; and, if any\nof them arife on the eall:ern fineter at the .time of birth, they declare the\nnative of a mixed complexion, neither fair nor fwarthy, but partaking of-\nboth ; and .fimilar to his complexion will be his underftanding. The\nfeventh column lhews which of the degrees of the zodiac are called void;\nand, if the afcendant in the radix of any nativity be pofited in them, it\ndel~res an imbecility in the judgment and underftanding of the native;\nand, the farther he enters into converfation or bufinefs, the more obvious\nwill this defeCt appear. The eighth column points out what degrees in\neach of the twelve figns are called deep and pitted; and the(e, in a nativity,\nfignify, that if the afcendant, his lord, or the moon. be fitu.ated in any of\nthem, the native will be of a hafty and imperfeCt fpeech, incapa~le of ex-\npreffing his defi.res, o.r .of ~eclaring h_\nis fentiments; a.nd will be ~Iway~ in-\nYolved in vexatious httgatwns and d1fputes ; and, like a man 1n a prt or\nfnare, will want tbe affiftance of another to help him out. The ninth\ncolumn difiinguifi1es the azimene, lame, or dffici'ent, degrees; and, if in a\nnativity any one of thefe afcend, or the lord of the afcendant, or the moon,\nbe in any \u00b7of them, the n:atiyc will be crooked, lame, or deformed, or in\nfome manner vitiated in ~he member or part of the body that the fign\ngoverns in w~ich fuch a~imet~e degrees ~all happen to. be. This rule\nis \u00b7fo unexcepuonable and mvanable; that 1t ought to be V{ell confidered\nin the judgment of every nativity. The ten~h column points out all the\ndegrees in the twelve figns that are augmentors or increafers of fortune;\nand the knowledge to be derived from them is, that if, in a nativity,~the\ncufp of t~e fecond houfe, o~ lord of the fe~~nd, Jupiter, or part of for-\ntune.. be 10 degrees augment1ng, they 'hen 'f:.-come arguments of much\nwealth ; and prefage that the native lhall, according to his capacity or\nfituation iR life, attain to ftill greater hoo(i)ur, riches, and preferment.\nBut, befides thefe general -properties, each of the figns polfefs a parti-\ncular efficacy and\u00b7\u00b7virtue peculiar to themfelves, or to that part of the hea-\nvens wherein they bear .rule. For, as upon earth all ground will oot\nbring forth the fame fq~it, fo in the heavens all places or parts thereof\n~ill not produc~ the fattl'\\, effecl:s.

This\nplanet is furrounded by a thin broad ring, fomewhat refembling the ho-\nrizon of an artifi<;ial globe ; and it appears double when feen through a\ngood telefcope. It is inclined thirty degrees to the ecliptic, and is about\ntwenty-one thoufand miles in breadth ; which is equal to its difiance\nfrom Saturn on all fides. There is reafon to believe that the ring turns\nround its axis, becaufe, when it is almoft edge-ways to us, it appears feme-\nwhat thicker on one fide of the planet than on the other; and the thickeft.\nedge has been feen on different fides at different times. But, Saturn ~av\u00ad\ning no vifible fpots on his body, whereby to determine the time of his\nturning round his axis, the length of his days and nights and the pofition\nof his axis are wholly unknown to us. He has two degrees forty-eight\nminutes north, and two degrees forty-nine minutes iouth, latitud~. He\nNo. S\u2022 Z is\noigi.ized by Coogle\n\fIo8 \u00b7 AN ILLUSTR.ATION\n\u00b7 is retrograde one hundred and forty days, and ftationary five days b-\nefore\nand five days after his retrogradation. \u00b7\nSaturn is in nature col<l and dry, occafioned by his being fo far re-\nmoved from the heat of the fun ;\u00b7 abounds in moift vapours~ and is a me-\nlancholy, earthy, mafculine, folitary, diurnal, malevolent, planet; and\nthe greater infortune. His effe8s, when lord of the afcendant, or prin-\ncipal ruler of a natiyity, with all his qualities, are as follow: he produces\na middle fiature, with a dark, fwarthy, or pale, complexion, fmallleer-\ning black eyes, brqad forehead, lean face, lowering brow, thick nofe\nand lips, large ears, black \u00b7or brown hair, broad ilioulders, thin beard,\nwith fmall lean thighs and legs. If this planet is well dignified at the\ntim'e of birth, the native will be of an acute and penetrating imagination;\nin his conduct, au(tere; in words, referved ; in fpeaking and giving, very\nfpare j in labour, patient; in arguing or difputing, grave; in obtaining\nthe goods of this life, ftudious and -felicitous; in his attachments, either\nto wife or friend, conftant and unequivocal; in prc:judice or refentment,\nrigid and inexorable. But, if this planet be ill dignified at the time of\nbirth, the native will be naturally fordid, envious, covetous, miftruftful,\ncowardly, O.uggith, out~ardly di1fembling, falfe, ftubborn, malicious,\nand perpetually diffatisfied with himfelf, and .with all about him. When\nSaturn is oriental, the human ftature will be lhorter than ufua), and, when\noccidental, thin, kan, and Jefs hairy. If his latitude be north, the na-\ntive will be hairy and corpulent ; if without any latitude, he will be of\nlarge bones and \u00b7mufcl'es; and, if metidional, fat, fmooth, and fte(hy ; in\nhis firft ftation, ftrong and well-favoured ; and, in his fecond ftation,\nweak and ill-favoured. Thefe remarks likewife hold good with refpect\nto all the other planets. It is aJfo to be remarked, that, when Saturn is\nfignificator of travelling, be betokens long and laborious journeys, peril-\nous adventures, and dangerous imprifonment. Saturn governs the fpleen,\nright ear, bones, teeth, joints, and retentive faculty, in man; and rules\nevery thing bitter, lharp, or acrid.

Libra; and his fall takes place in that fign where\ncold \u00b7is diminilhed and heat increafed, viz. Aries; which are quite con-\ntrary in nature to the Sun.\nJupiter is exalted in Cancer, and has his fall in Capricorn; for Jupiter\ndelights in the northern part of the heavens, where he ftirs up northern\nwinds, which increafe fertility and vegetation; and, his greateft declina-\ntion nortbwards being in .Cancer, _he is therein exalted.

Thefe figns apply to each other\nin a trine, in the fame manner as a planet in a fiery fign applies to another\nplanet in a fiery fign (if in the fame number of degrees) in a trine; and\n, 2 thus \u00b7\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f. \u00b7 0 F A S T R. 0 L 0 G Y. 1\u00b7as\nthus a planet in an airy fign beholds- another planet in an airy fign with\na trine; and fo the watery and earlhy figns apply in the lame manner;\nand each of thefe trine afpeCl:s con~fts of one hundred and twenty degrees.\nThe Sun and Jupiter have dominion over the fiery triplicity; the Sun\nby day, and Jupiter by night. The Sun by <lay, becaufe he is hot and\nfiery, and of the nature of thefe figns; and Jupiter by night, becaufe he\u00b7\nis temperate, and moderates the extremity of heat. This is called the\neaftern triplicity.\nSaturn and Mercury have aominion over the airy triplicity, which is\nweftern; Mercury by night, and Saturn by day. But as Libra is the\nexaltation of Saturn, and Aqu!lries the boufe and ,fign wherein he has moil\njoy; and as Gemini is only the'houfe of Mercury ; it follows that Sa-\nturn has the principal government in this triplicity.\n\u00b7 Mars both night and day governs the watery triplicity, which is nor-\nthern; and it feems that Mars ~as appointed to this triplicity to tem-\nper and abate his violent heat; for we find he is more powerful in his\nmalignant effeCl:s in the fign Leo than he is in Cancer; therefore he has\nhis fall appointed him in Cancer, though h~ is peregrine in Leo.\nVenus and the Moon bear rule over the earthy triplicity, which is fe..\nminine and fouthern, cold and m~i~.., producing fouth-eaft winds, and\ncold moift air; hence this triplicity js affigned to the care of feminin~\nplanets. \u00b7\nThe TERMS \"of the .PLANETS.\nA Term is a certain number of degrees, in each boufe or fign of the\nZodiac, wherein the planets Saturn,. Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury,\nhave a certain priority; but ,the Sun and Moon have no terms. Tbefe\ndegrees are called terms, ends, or bounds ; for the planets have each their\nproportions fo allotted therein, that at the en.d of a certain number of\ndegrees, the terms .of one planet ceafe, and thofe of ahother begin~\nFor inftan'ce, from the firft degree of Aries to the fixth, are the terms\nof Jupiter; from the fixth to the .fourteenth, are the terms of Venus; -\nand fo of all the reft. Ptolemy, Albumazer, and Bonatus, have all\n1hewn that the greater years of the planets are difcovered by their feve\u2022\nraJ terms or bounds through the Zodiac J which is done by finding what\nnumber of degrees each of the planets have allotted them in each fign;\nand then, by adding them together, the fum will be the number of each of\ntheir great years, as will appear more obviou11y by the following example:\nNo-. 7\u00b7 Gg TERM.S.\nDigitized by 00gle\n\fs3s AN ILLUST .RATION\nT E R M s.\nlJ;: ~ ' I : ' ~ : I!\nIn the Sign ~cit; .4. 6 5 8 7\nrt~l 2 7 6 8 7\n[n: 4 6 6 7 7\n- 8 7 6\nz 7\n;\n6 6 s 7\n{ll\n,.\n,..., 6 .s 6 '6 7\nI\"A\n!.a. 6 8 6 5 5\n:nt\n~\n8 6 7 6\nf.tl 8 5 6 5\n:J:t> 6 7 5 6 6\n,_. 6 s s 8 6\n~, -\n' )E\n5 6 s 8 6\n~ \\oO\n- - - -\nGreat years 57 79 66 82 76 \u2022\/\n- - - -\nThefe great years being added together, make juft three hundred and\n:fixty degrees, being the whole extent or circumference of the Zodiac. \u00b7\n'\n. \u00b7 The degrees are. in this manner divided into terms, to 1hew what pla-\nnet has moft dignities in \u00b7a fign, wltether b,t eJCaJt.ation and houfe, tripli-\n. city and houfe; or houfe, exaltation, or triplicity, alone; and to that\ndf.planet which . has two or mo.re dignities, we affign the .firll: term, whe-\nther he be a fortune or an infortune. If an infortune has not two dig-\n\/ , nities in a fign, be is .placed laft, and the firft term is given either to the\n1 lord or the exaltation, or to the lord of the triplicity, or to the lord\nof the .houfe, uniformly preferring that planet which has two \u00b7dignities\nto th'ofe that have only one. But an e~ception to this rule extends to the\n1igns Cancer and Leo; for Cancer being the oppofite fign to the exalta-\ntion of Mars, which is in Capricorn, occafions the firtl: term of C-ancer\nto be affigned to Mars; and, becaufeLeo is theoppofite fign to the boufe\nand joy of Saturn, the firft term of Leo is for this reafon given to Sa-\nturn. To the infortunes are allotted the laft degrees of all the figos, ex-\ncepting thofe of Leo, wh!ch are given to Jupiter. The quantity of terms\nare divided according to the following met~od; when Jupiter and. Ve-\nnus have not two dignities in the fame fign, nor in the fecond:, third; or\nfourth, houfe, they have feven degrees allotted for their terms-. Saturn\nand Mars, becaufe they are infortunes, (except in their own ho~:~fes,) have\nbut five, and fometimes only four, three, or two, degrees each. Mercu-\nry, becaufe he is of a mixed nature; has ufually fix degrees allotted him;\nbut, when any of the planets are e1fentiallydignified, they claim each one\ndegree more; as Venus in the firft term of Taurus has eight degrees, and\nSaturn\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R .0 L\u00b7 0 G Y.\nSaturn in the firft term of Aquaries claims fix. But, becaufe Venus ha~\neight degrees in Taurus, Saturn has only two, being very weak in Tau.\nrus; and again, in Sagittary, Jupiter is increafed one degree, becaufe he\nis 11:rong, and Mercury is diminitbed one degree, becaufe he 'is weak; {o\nthat Jupiter takes\u00b7eight degrees, and leaves Mercury but :five.\nIt is alfo nece1fary to obferve, that a planet in his own term is (l:rong;\n.and that, the more dignities he gains therein, the fironger will his influ-\nence be; for .example, Jupiter in the firft term of Sagittary is ftronger\nand mor~ powerful than in the firft term of Aries, though they are\nboth equally his terms ; and the reafon of this is, becaufe the fign Sa-\n,gittary is both his houfe and triplicity,\u00b7 and Aries is his triplicity only,\nwherefore be has the firft eight degrees <;>f Sagittary fqr his term, and\nonly fix in Aries. Hence it becomes apparent, that, the nearer a planet is\nin nature to the, place of his term, the fironger will his influence be\ntherein. Jupiter, being hot and moift, has but five degrees for his term\nin Virgo, which is a cold and dry fign; but in Gemini, which is hot\nand moifi, he has fix degrees, becaute it agrees with his nature; and yet\nin Cancer, which is cold and moift, he poffe1f-:s feven degrees, although\nit does not agree with his nature; and the reafon is, Cancer is the houfe\nof Jupiter's exaltation, and therefore the greater term is allotted him.-\nIn like manner, if a planet that is cold and dry be pofited in a term of\nthe fame temperature, his coldnefs anq drynefs will be greatly increafed\nthereby, and he will opera~e the more powerfully in. his influences. The\nfame rule holds good in refpea fo all the other qualities of the planets;\nand it muft be remembered, that a planet is always increafed in ftrength\nby being fituated in hoafes or places of his own temperature and quality.\nThus a planet that is hot and dry lofes much of his natural vigour in a term\nthat is cold and moifi~ and a planet that i~ cold and moift lofes confi-\nderably of its nature in a term that is hot and dry. And in like manner,\nif a plan~t that is a fortur1e be pofited in a fortunate term, his beneficent\neffects are the more increafed, and he is fortified with greater power and\nfirength to operate upon whatever fubject he is the Jign~ficator of. And\non the contrary, ifan evil and malevolent planet be in an evil ilgnand term,\n\u00b7 its eff.:{ts will be therebv rendered ftill more mifchievous. And the lord\nof a term when pofitcd \u00b7in that term, be the fign what it may, has more\npower therein than the lord of the fign, or thim the planet that has the\nfign for its exaltation. Again, if the l9rd of any term be pofited in his\n. term; and the lord of the i1gn be fituated in another fign in afpect with\nhim, the lord of the term will have more power in the fi~n- where he is\nthan the lord of the fign, and thall be the principal fignificator; but, if\n.the lord of the term be pofited in his own term and iign alfo, then his\nfirength and energy will be fiill more confiderable. It may alfo be ob-\n2 ferved,\nDigitized by Coogle \u00b7\n\f--\nA N I L L U S T R A' T I 0 N\n\u00b7fc:rved, that, when a planet is weak in a fign, his debility would be very\nmuch ]e1fened lhould he chance t? be fituated in that part of the fign\nwherein he bas terms. Whenever a planet is pofited in a term and fign\nboth of his own nature, it is a very thong and fortunate afped:.\nThe P H A SE S of the PL A N E T S.\nThe planets' Phafes confift of the twelve figns of the Zodiac, divided\neach into three equal parts ; fo that one phafis contains ten degrees, and\nevery fign three phafes. They are called phafes, becaufe they fignify or\nI reprefcnt the forms, natures, and inclinations, of the feveral planets ap-\npropriated to them. A planet's term divides a phafis.J a phafis divides a\niign; a fign divides a triplicity; and a triplicity divides the whole Zodiac.\nTo afcertain the' proper phafes of each planet, we begin with Mars,\nin the equinoctial fign Aries, becaufe it is the houfe of this planet;\nwherefore the fir.ft ten degrees confl:itute the phafis of Mars; the fecond\nten degrees are the phafis of the Sun; and the third, which make up the\nwhole thirty degrees of Aries, confiitute the phafis of Venus. .

The fextile is termed an afpect: of imperfett Jove,\namity, or friendiliip; becau_fe when two planets, or fignificators, are in\nfextile to each other, they import that any matter in difpute, treaty of\nmarriage, or other fubject of enquiry, may be happily terminated, or\nbrought about, by the intervention of friends; or that for want thereof,\nthe contrary may happen. And, though the fextile afpetl is fometimes\nover-ruled by the more powerful influences of malignant ones, yet it\nis generalJy confidered. an omen of the favourable kind.\n\u00b7 By a quartile afped: o , 'two planets' aro underfiood to be pofited at\n.Qinety ~egrees, or one fourth part o~ the circJe of the Zodiac, fr~m each\u00b7\nother; 1s confidered an afpea of Jrnperfett hatred, and ad.s 'l)tCt 'Vt':fo\nwith the fextile, inclining rather to malignancy, contention, and mis-\nfortune, as the other does to friend1hip, harmony, and good fortune.\nA trine afpeel: A, imports the planets to b~ fituated at the difiance of\none hundred and twenty degrees, or one tbird part of the circle of the.\nZodiac, from each other; and is fometimes called a trigonal afpect, or\na trigonocrater, implying rule or dominion in a certain trigon or tripli-\ncity. This is an afpett of the moft perfett unanimity, friendlhip, and\npeace; and it is fo conlidered, becaufe when the planets are in a A afpea,\nthey are pofited in figns precifely of the fame triplicity and nature; that\nis to\u00b7fay, they are both in an earthy, airy, fiery, or watery, fign; and\nconfequently both col)tribute the f~e influences unimpeded. .Qut in a\n'*, which is ~an afpea of imperfetl amity~ the planets are pofited in\nJigns of only a partial nature, viz. fiery with an airy, or an earthy with a\nwatery, fign; and as the fiery fign is hot and dry, and the airy hot and moifl;\n- the earthy cold and dry_, and the watery cold and mDt]l, fo the planets\nthus pofited, agreeing only in one point out of two, give but an imperfect\ninfluence. Thus the diftipctions between a* and a A afpcet, and between\na o and 8 , are founded in.rcafon and experience\u2022\n. The oppofition 8 of two planets, lignifies .their being pofited at one\nhundred and eighty degrees, or juft half the diftance of the Zodiac, apart.\nwhich places them in a diametrical radiation. This is confidered anafped:\nof perfect hatred, or of inveterate malice and enmity, as malignant in\nits effeas, as the trine is benevolent; and of double the deftructive ten-\ndency of the i:l afped:. To infiance this, let us fuppofe two kingdoms,\nftates, focieties, or private gentlemen, at variance, and it is enquired whe-\nther the caufc o( difputc may be amicably adjufted?

But, i the fignificators are found in\naCl:ual oppofition, the difpute in quefiion would mpft probably occafion\nhoftility,. war, litigation, or duel, or be attel)ded with fome alarming con..\nfequences, before the matter would fubfide. Wherefore an 8 is juftly\ntermed an afpeCl: of perfca: enmity.\nThefe afpeets arc all divided, for the fake of pe~fpicuity, into partik\nand platic afpetl\"s. A partile afpeet confiders two planets exactly fo many\ndegrees from each other as make a perfect afpeCt; that is, if Venus be\nin nine degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in nine degr-ees of Leo, they are in\npartile trine afpect. Again, if t~e Sun be in OQe degree of Taurus, and\n. the Moon in one degree of Cancer, they are in a partile fextiJe a.fpetl; fo\nthatall perfea: afpea:s are partile, and imply the matter or thing threat-\nened, whether g9od or evil, to be near at hand. .\n\u00b7 By a platic afpetl, we are'to underftand two planets fo pofited, \u00b7 as to\nadm.it half the degrees of each of their own rays or orbs; for mftance,. ,_\nif Saturn be pofited in fixtccn degrees of Aries, and Jupiter 'in twenty- \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nfour degrees of Gemini, then Saturn would be in a platic !extile afpect \u00b7\nto Jupiter, becaufe Saturn would be fituated within the moiety pf both\ntheir orbs, which are nine degrees each. The fame circumfiance ap- . \u00b7\nplies to the afpeets of all the planets; for jf their diftance from each other\nbrings them within one halfof each of their orbs or radiations, when add...\n\u00b7 ed together, they will then form a platic afpect. It muft alfo be care- \u00b7\nfully obferved in \u00b7thefe platic afpecl:s, whether the co-operation of the\ntwo planets ie going off, or coming on. In the above example, the ef..\nfed: of Satu.rn'.s platic fextile afpect with Jupiter was $Oing \u00b7off'J but if\nwe reverfe t.heir fituations, and place Saturn in twenty-four degrcee of\nGemini, and Jupiter in fixteen degrees of Aries, then the afpeCt would\nbe comiQg on with all its force and infiucace, and would proportionably\naffeCt the iubjea, whatt'Yer it be, under confideration.\nTo enable the reader to find the platic afpects more readily, I fubjoin\nthe following table of the planets' orbs, mean motion, and latitude.\nTABLE\n\u2022\nDigitized by Go&\n\u00b7gle\n\f\u2022\n0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G .Y. 145\nTABLE of the ORBS and MEAN MOTION of the PLANETS.\nORBs.

Direction is\u00b7alfo a cal-\nculus, whereby to find the time of any accident or remarkable event that\nwill .happen to the perfon who propounds a quefiion, or has his nativity\ncafi. For infiance, a perfon enquires how many years he may Jive, by\nthe courfe of the planets at the time of birth?. Having\u00b7e!lablilhed the\nSun, Moon, or afcendant, as fignificators of life, and Mars or Saturn as\npromittors or portentors of death, the diretlion is a calculation of the\nlength of time in which the fignificator will be in meeting the promittor;\nand this refolves the quefiion. In thefe calculations, the fignificator is\nfometimes termed apheta, or giver of life, and the promittor anareta, or\ngiver of death\u2022. The directions of all the principal points of the heavens,\nplanets, and fixed fiars, as the afcendant, mid-heaven, Sun, Moon, arid\nPart of Fortune, are worked by the fame rule.\nSTATIONARY is underftood of a planet, when, to the eye or.fenfes of\na beholder here on earth, it appears to fiand frill, without any progreflive\nmotion in its orbit. Not that a planet ever is or can be naturally in this\nftate, but is only rendered fo in appearance, by the inequalities which\narife from the po.fitions and motions of the earth; for, were the plane~s\nto be viewed from the Sun, or centre of the fyftem, they would always\nappear uniform and regular.\n\u00b7RETROGRADATION implies an apparent \u00b7motion in the planets,\nwhereby\u00b7tbey feem to go backwards in the ecliptic, and to move in ante-\ncedentia, or towards the antecedent figns, viz. from eaft to weft, contrary\nto the order of direction and to the fucceffion of the figns of the Zodiac.\nThis alfo is a\u00b7n appearance produced by an oppofite motion of the earth to\nthat of the planets. \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2022\nAPPLICATION lignifies the approach of t-wo planets together,_either\nby conjunction or afpeCl, and is of three kinds: the firft is, when a pla-\nnet, fwif m otion, applies to one of flower progrefs; for example, fup-\npofe Mercury pofited in fixteen degrees of Gemini, and Mars in twenty\u2022\none ~rees of the {ameilgn, both being direct in motion; Mercury, by\nhavin t -e greater apparent projectile force, would overtake and form a.\nNo. \u2022 K k con\u2022\n~igitized by Coogle\n\fAN,ILLUSTRATION\nconjunB:ion with Mars, which is termed a direel application. The fe.\ncond kind is formed by two retrograde planets; as, fuppofing M~rcury\nin fixteen degrees of .Gemini, and Saturn in fift.een degrees of the fame\nfign, both retrograde, Mercury, being the lighter planet, applies to the\nbody of Satu.rn, a more ponderous planet, by retrogradation; and this is\ntermed a retrograde afplication. . The third kind is occafioned by one\nplanet going direct in motion, and meeting another planet that is retro-\ngrade; for inftance, fuppofe Mercury retrograde in fixteen degrees of\nGemini, and Saturn \u00b7 direa in twelve degrees of the fame fign; here\nMercury, being the lighter planet, applies to a conjunction of Saturn by\na retrograde motion; and thefe two laft are deemed evil applications. It\nmuft alfo be obferved that the fuperior planets never apply to the inferior\nbut by a retrograde motion; whereas the inferior planets apply both ways.\nSEPARATION .is rinderftood of two planets that have either been in\npartite conjunction or afpeCt, and arc juft departed or feparated from\nJt. \u00b7 Thus, if we fuppofe Saturn in twelve degrees of Sagittary, and Ju-\npiter in thirteen degrees of the fame fign, Jupiter will be then feparated\none degree from a perfect or partite conjunction with Saturn~ but they\nwould ftill be in a platic conjunction, bec;aufe they are within the moiety\nof each other's radiations, which is four degrees and a half each, confe-\nquently thefe planets would continue in platic conjunCtion until they\nwere feparated nine degrees, and then the afpect would entirely ceafe\u2022 .\nThe exatl knowledge of every degree of the feparations of thefe afpcfls\nis of the utmoft confequence in. giving judgment upon various impor-\ntant occafions. \u00b7For inftance, fuppofe it were demanded whether a cer-\ntain treaty of marriage would take place or not? When all the -afpects\nare. collected upon t~e horofc,ope, and the two planets, that are fignifica..\ntors of the parties, are found applying to each other in a conjuncti~n,\nand in common or fixed figns, the marriage may probably take place in\nfome length of time. If the fignificators are pofited in moveable figns,\nangular, and approaching fwift in motion to a conjunction, it may then\nbe confummated in a very ihort time; but, if the fignificators are fepara-.\nted from a conjunction only a few minutes of a degree, one may fafely\nconclude that there has been great probabili~y, only a few days .befoce,\nthat the wedding_would have taken place; but by this afpea the parties\nappear to be hanging in fufpence, and fome diflike or change of fenti-\nment feems to have taken place : and, as the fignificators gradually. (epa-\nrate from the partile and\u00b7 platic conjunCtions, in \u00b7the fame gradation will\nthe treaty and affeCtions of the parties alienate and wear . \u00b7\nthe c_ompara~ivc time that the afpefl: will occupy ~fife it\nfo wdl the t1me be fo many weeks, months, or yearn\nthall wholly rclinquilh the connexion. ~:>\n2\n,.\noigitizedby Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nPRoHIBITION indicates the fiate of two planets that are fignificators\nof fome event, or the bringing of fome bufinefs to an iffue or conclufion,\nand are applying to each other by conjunction; but, before fuch conjunc-\ntion can be formed, a third planet, by means of a fwifter motion, inter-\npofes his body, and defiroys the expected conjunaion, by forming an\nafpeet himfelf; and this indicates that the matter under contemplation\nwill be greatly retarded, or utterly prevented. For example, fuppofe\nMars was pofited in feven degrees of Aries, Saturn in twelve degrees,\nand the Sun in fix degrees, of the C1me fign; Mars is the fignificator of\nthe bufinefs in hand,_and promifes the ilfue or completion of it fo foon \u00b7\nas he comes to a conjunction with Saturn; but the Sun, being fwifter in\nmotion than Mars, pa1fes him, and prevents their conjunction, by forming\nthe afpea himfelf. This indicates, that whatever was expected from the\napproaching conjunction of Mars and Saturn is now prohibited by the\nSun's firft impediting Mars and then Saturn; and this is termed a conjunc-\ntional or bodily prohibition. There is alfo\u00b7 a prohibition by afpea, either\nfextile, quartile, trine, or oppofition; and this happens when two pla-\nnets are going into conjunCtion. Suppofe Mars to ,be in feven degrees of\nAries, Saturn in thirteen degrees of the fame fign, and the Sun in five\ndegrees of Gemini; the Sun, being fwifter than Mars in his diurnal mo-\ntion, will quickly overtake him, and pafs by the fextile dexter of Mars,\nand form a fextile dexter with Saturn, before Mars can reach him; by\nthis means their conjunaion is prohibited.\nFRUSTRATioN imports a fwift or light planet approaching to an\nafpea with one more flow and ponderous; but, before they can approach\nnear enough to form that afpect, the weig~ty planet is joined to fome\nother, by which the firft afpect is fruftrated. i To inftance this. fuppofe\nSaturn pofttcd in fixteen degrees of Gemini, ]upiter in fifteen degrees of\nLeo, and Mars in eleve~ degrees of the fame fign; here Mars applies to\na conjuntlion with Jupiter, but, before he can reach it, Jupiter meets\na fext)le afpea from Saturn, which fruftrates the conjunCtion of Mars~\nand, in pradice, utterly deftroys whatever was promi{ed by it.\nREFRANATION is the ftate of a planet in direct motion, applying to\nan afpcct or conjunBion with another planet, but before they can meet\nbecomes retrograde, and thus refrains to form the afpeCl: expeaed.

This happens when a light\n'\\i{ planet feparates from a weighty one, and joins with another more pon-\n~ derous, and is effeaed in this manner: let Saturn he placed in twenty\n'l. 1 .degrees of Aries, Jupiter in thirteen degrees, and Mars in fourt~en de-\n)~ ~ grees, of the fame fign; here Mars feparates from a conjunCtion with Ju-\n~ piter, and tranflates the light and nature of that planet to Saturn, to whom\n\" he next applies. The effect of this in practice will be, that,. if a matter or\n\u00b7 ~ thing be promifed by Saturn, then whoever was reprefented by Mars\n~ . iliall procure all the affiftance that the benevolent planet Jupiter could\n~ befrow, and tranflate it to Saturn, whereby the bufinefs in hand would be\n~,\n:~\n~ the better effe?l;ed, and more happily concluded; and this, being a very\n\\~ fortunate pofition of the planets, is very proper to be known, fince it pro..\nJDifes much ~n law-fuits, marriages, and all other queftions of the kind.\n....\nRECEPTION is when two planets, that are fignificators in any queftion\nor nativity, are pofited'in each other's dignity, as the Sun in Aries, and\nMars in Leo, which is a reception by houfes, and is deemed the mofi:\n~werful and efficacious of all receptions. But reception may be by ex-\nchange of tripJicity, term, or phafe, or by any effential dignity; as Venus \u00b7\nin Aries, and the Sun in Taurus,.is a reception by triplicity, if the quef-\ntion Ot\" nativity happen by day. Or if Venus be in the twenty-fourth\ndegree of.Aries, and Mars in the fixteenth .degree of Gemini, it is are-\nception by terms. The u{e of thefe pofitions, in praCtice is confiderable .i.\nfor, fuppofe the event of any queftion required be denied by the afpeCts;-\nor the fignificators arc in no afpeCt with each other; or it is doubtful\nwhat may happen from a quartile or oppofition of the fignifi.cators; yet.\nif the pr~ncipal fignificators are found in mutual receptio~, th~ .thing\ndefired w1ll fhortly come to pafs, and probably to the fattsfacbon and\ncontent of all the parties concerned. \u00b7\nP~REGlUNATlON defcribes a planet to be fituated in a fign; or in\nfuch certain degrees of a fign, where it has no effential dignity, either\nby houfe, exaltation, triplicity, term, or phafe; as Saturn in the tenth\ndegree of Aries, is peregrine; and the Sun in any part of Cancer, is\nperegrine, having no dignity whatever in that fig'n. In all quefi:ions of\ntheft, it is very material to know the peregrine.planet; for it has been\nuniformly found, by almoft every regular profeffor of this Art, that the\n!hief may be al~oft conftantly _\ndifcovered by the peregr\u00b7n met pofited\n'ln an angle, or 1n the fecond boufe.\nCoMBUSTION is the ftate of a planet, hen fituated wit11n dght e-.\ngrees ~irty minutes of the body of the Sun, either be~J\u2022.!< \u00b7h'~\"vC him.\nSuppofe Mercury jn the twenty-firft degree, the Sun in the y-fifth\"\ndegree.:\n\f_\n\\\nc\n0 F' A \u00b7s T R 0 L 0 G Y.\ndegree, and Venus in the twenty-(cventh degree of Aquaries; here\nMercury and Venus would be both combuft; but Venus would be\nmore affeth:d by it than Mercury, becaufe the Sun applies to or moves\ntowards Venus, and recedes from Mercury, whereby his rays affiitt her\nmore forcibly on his nearer approach, and become weaker upon Mercury\nby his reeds from him.\nCAZIMI reprefents a planet in the heart of the Sun; that is, if a planet\nbe only feventeen minutes before or after the Sun, as if the Sun were in\nfifteen degrees thirty minutes of Taurus, and Mercury in fifteen degrees\ntwenty minutes of the fame fign, Mercury would be then in cazimi, or\nin the heart of the Sun. All authors agree that a planet in dzimi is for-\ntified thereby, and is of greater efficacy; whereas a planet in combuftion\nis of a malignant nature.

This rule holds good from the, tenth houfe to the\nfeventh; the feventh to the fourth, and fo on through the whole; but\nit fuould always be remembered that planets in angles, that is, \u00b7thofe\nwhi!=~ are feated in the angular houfes. are the moft forcible andpotent in\ntheir operation. \u00b7\nThe firft houfe,.. which is denoted by the figure I, is called the afi:en-\nJant, becaufe, the point of its angle being level with the horizon, what-\never planet afcends from under the earth muft afcend upon this line, and\nbecome vifible firft in this houfe. The line upon which the planets\na{cend, or move, is.caiTed the cufp of the 4oufes; and that of the afcen-\ndant is generalJy rec ed o extend about five degrees above the earth\nand twenty-five degrees beneath, ready to afcend.

The point, which we term the Part of. Fortune,\nis the diftance of the Moon's place from the Sun's, added to the degrees\nof the afcendant; and the nature of it is, as conftant obfervation afcer-\ntains, that, if this point falls among fortunate ftars, or in afortunate part\nof the heavens, theh it promifes great fuccefs in health or.wea~th, honour\nor <?ffspring, or any other fpecies of profperity, according as it is feated .\neither in the firft, eleventh, or fifth, houfes, or in any others.. The rea-\nfon of this appears to be, that the Sun, Moon, and Afcendant, being tbe\nprime conduits through which the ftream of life flo~s, this feat of the\nPart of Fortune is the harmony o! all three concentering and uniting in\nthe fame aCts of benevolence.\nNow, befides thefe, there are yet other qualities, accidentally affected,\nwhich concern either particular perfons or times. Thus, the places of\nSaturn, or Mars, or the Tail of the Dragon, in the vernal figure, are un-\nfortunate in the higheft degree for the whole of that year; or, if they\nhappen in any of the quarter figures, they portend afHiCl:ion and mif- -\nfortune for that quarter. But the places of Jupiter and Venus in aver-\nnal figure are as fortunate as the others are unfortunate for the fame time.\nThe places of an eclipfe of the Sun or Moon, and of the \u00b7comets, arc alfo\nfortunate or unfortunate, as their fituation may be, or as perfons, coun-\ntries, or ftates, may be concerned in them. The place of Saturn or Mars\nin a man's nativity proves unfortunate to him all the days of his life; and\nthe place in either of them in a revolutional figure is equally bad for that\nyear. .But the place of Jupiter or Venus in a nativity, or in a revolu-\ntional figure; is always as fortunate, either for a man's life-time, or for\nthe year, as the other is unfortunate. Alfo the places of the twelfth\nhoufc, or eighth, or fixth, as they were in the native fchome, have always\nbad fignifications unto a man, whenfoever they come up upon any of his\nconcerns. And the places of the tenth houfe, of the eleventh, of the\nafcendant, and of the fccond houfe, generally promife as much good ~s\nthe other houfes do evil upon all the\u00b7common occafions of life.\nThus far we have feen the operations of the twelve houfes of heaven,_\nas they appertain to the time and circuanftances of a nativity. We fuall\nnow explain their .properties in that fyftem of nature upon which the\ndoilrine of horary queftions is grounded. And fuch has been the induf-'\ntry :md indefatigable labour of our forefathers, in bringing this fcience to\nmaturity, and in difcovering and diftinguifuing the particular fignifications\nand effeCts of all pofitions of the plagets in thefe twelve houfes of bc;aven.,\nthat whoever takes\u00b7the pains to inform himfelf fufficicntly of them will\n1 on\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOF A S -T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nnot be in want of competent grounds whereon to judge, or give ration~l\nanfwers to every interrogation or quefiion on the common occurrepces of\n, life, or any contingent accidents or uqdertakings, with the confequ~:nces\nand fuccefs of them.\nThe 'fidl: houfe bears lignification of the life of man, and \u00b7of the fta\u2022 .~\nture, colour, complexion, form, and lhape, of him who propound's a q uef- ~\ntion; and, as all the viciffitudes\u00b7 of nature depend upon the periods of\nman's life, fo all queftions are refolved by this houfc that relate to fick- ~\nnefs, health, or long life; and alfo all accidents by which life may be en. \"-~\ndangered or impaired; what part of one's days will be the moll: happy ~.\nCJnd profperous; whether any abfent friend or relation be living or dead;\"-.~ '\nor whether any journey, voyage, or lhip at fea, will he attendtd with fuc- ~\ncefs and fafety, or meet with any accident fatal to life, or defirutl:ive to\nthe ihip. In lhort, all quefi:ions relating to circumft,,nces that\natfeet life are to be anfwered from the firft houfe. In ftate-afirology,\nand jn eclipfes, great <\n:onjunCtions, appearances of comets, and other lu-\nminous and extraordinary phenomena in the heavens, and upon the Sun'~\nannual ingrefs into the equinoClial fign Aries, the firfi hou'e bears figni.:\nfication of the community at large, or of that ftate, empire, or kingdom,\nwhue the figure is ereBed. Of colours, \u00b7the firfi: houfe gives a white; -\nfrom which is to be underfiood, that, if a plan\u00b7et be pofited in this houfe\nthat-governs a light colour, and a qu::fiion be propounded from any party\nrelative to a perfon, matter, or thing, where colours are concerned, and\nthis planet be the ugnificator thereof, then the perfon's complexion and\nhair, or, if cattle, then their colour, lhatl be of a white, pale, or lightilh,\nkind; and, though this may appear ridiculous and infignificant. to the un-\nderfianding of fame readers, yet the fact fi:ands unlhaken in practice. Now,\nas every one of the twelve houfes of heaven have their fignificators, (()\nhave they alfo their co-fignificators, which have frequent ope'ration, and\ntherefore ought to be confidered. A co-fignificator is a planet either\nfallen into-conjunction or joined in afpeCl: with the principal fignificator;\nin which cafes the planet either affifis or oppofes in the matter under con...\n\"1ideration; if it be joined with a benevelent planet) it imports good; -\nbut, if it h~ppens to the contrary, it either deno~es deftrud:ion to the fu\u00b7b-\njett of enquiry, or great difturbance in the effeCling it. The co-fig-\nnificators of this houfe are Saturn and Aries; and, if Saturn is moderately\nwell dignified in this houfe, and in any benevolent afpei:l with ] upiter,\nVenus, or the Sun or Moon, it promifes a good faber conll:itution cff body,\nand generally gives long life.

But I cannot di(mifs this\nfubjeet, without giving my readers the definition of the twelve houf~s of\nheaven, from the works of the learned and much-elleemed philofopha and\naftrologian, Morinus; and in doing this, I fhall adhere as much to the\nfpii-it and letter of. the author, as the nature of a tranfiation will admit.\n\" It is a faCt, fays this excellent author, which preponderates in the ba-\nlance of reafon, and highly claims our fober confideration, that the life of\nman is refolvable into four difiintt periods or ages; namely, infancy,\nyouth, maturity, and old age; though it may be faid with firitt truth,\nthat' fcarcely half the human race attain to the conclufion ofonly tqeir third\nperiod. In the conftruclion of man therefore, we difcover four afft:tl:ions,\ninto which all other things appear to be reducible, as it were ta their firft\nbeginning; namely, life, aCtion, marriage, and paffion. Theie agree with\nthe rife, perfeCtion, declination, and termination, of all things, and com-\nprife the whole effects and operations of nature. For man is truly f.aid,\nto rjfe into the world the moment he receives refpiration and life; to be\nin perfeRion when he attains to manhood and maturity~ and to the pro-\npagation of his fpecies; to decline, when he begins to Jofe the innate\nradical principle of heat and moifture; and to fullain the lall paffion of\nlife, when he ceafes to breathe, and filently finks into the grave. The\n\u00b7life, action, marriage, and paffions, of men, are therefore governed by the\nfame celeftial principle, which regulates the birth, perfection, declina-\ntion, and diffolution, of all other things. Wherefore life, in the fyll:em.\nof nature, is regulated by the eall angle of the heavens, called the ~fccn\u00ad\ndant ; action, by the fouth angle, or. midheaven; marriage, by the weft\nangle; and pa11ion, by the north angle of the \u00b7heavenly frame. And henc~\nNo.\u00b78. P p arif,;\n~igitized by Coogle\nI\n\fJ68 A N ILL U S T R A T.I 0 N\narife f~ur triplicities of the fame genus or generital nature, and twelve\nhoufes, as heretofore defcribed. The fidl. triplicity is of the eafi.ern an-\ngle, or afcendant, attri~uted to infancy, and called the triplicity of life,\nand includes the firft, ninth, and fifth, houfes, which behold each other.\nin a partite trine in the equator, where this rational divifion of the twelve\nhoufes is made.\n\" Man either does, or ought to, live in a three-fold refpeel, in himfelf,\nin God# and in his pofterity; for the great ends for which he was created,\nare to wodhip and glorify his Maker, and to propagate his fpecies. The life\nof man in himfelf is therefore the firft and prime objeCt in the order of\nnature; for, without this, all other parts of the creation would be vain,\nbeing madefor man's ufe and benpt. For this caufe, the life of man ap-\npertains to the firft and principal houfe in the divifion of the heavens.\nBut man's life in God, confifiing ~n his image of the Divinity, in the ra-\ntionality of his foul, and in the purity of his morals, claims, for this rea-\nfan, the ninth houfe, according to the motion of the equator, which is\nthe hou(e of piety and religion. And as man's life is continued in his\npofierity, according to one and the fame unchangeable law prefiding over\nall nature, fo the houfe of infancy and children, which is the fifth houfe,\nis appropriated for this purpofe. And thefe three concerns being con-\nfeffedly the grand objeH of man's life, the three houfes of heaven, under\nwhich they are refpettively nourithed and foftered, form a trine with each\nother, in a chain of mutual harmony and concord.\n\" The fecond triplicity confifis of the angle of the midheaven with\nthe fixth and fecond houfes. This triplicity wholly appertains to the\nfecond fiage of man's life, namely, that of vigour and ad:ion; and there-\nfore comprehends all worldly attainments, with the advantages flowing\nfrom them; for every thing that worketh phyfically worketh for fome\nphyfical good; and, as the motion of the equator is from the eaft angle to\nthe midheaven, fo is the progrefs made in all our earthly acquifitions.\nThe higheft degree of man's elevation in thi~ world, is to that of majefty,\npower, honour, dignity, preferment, or magifiracy, or to any of thofe fi-\ntuations by which he acquires fuperiority and affiuence. Thefe confill:-\n.ing of immaterial matter, and forming the firft order of earthly dignity.\nclaim the angular houfe of this triplicity, or the midheaven. The fc:-\ncond degree of worldly honour, is conceived to arife from fubjet.l:s, {er-\nvants, tenants, vaffals, and domefiics; and thefe, being formed of mat-\nter material and animated, are placed under the fixth houfe. The \u00b7third\nadvancement to earthly grandeur, is by matter material and animate, fuch\nas gold, jewels, and other valuable effects, accumulated by induftry and\nJweat qfthe brow; which being under t~e fecond houfe, thefe three houfes\n2 are\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nare alfo joined by fympathy in a partite trine, applying to each other in\nconcord and unanimity.\n\" The third ~riplicity comprehends worldly connections, whether by\nmarriage, cocfanguinity, or friendlhip, and thefe holding on in the or-\nder of J)ature, even .as the progrefs is made from the midheaven to the\nwefiern angle, apply to the progreffive tendency of youth to manhood and \u00b7\nmaturity. In this ftage of life, man is joined in a three-fo'ld tie or obli-\ngation; in body, in blood, and in friendfilip. Firll:, he is joined in body,\nby \u00b7the molr facred of all earthly ties, matrimony; (andioned under the\nfeal of God's primary command, \"increaje and multipiy.\" Secondly, he\nis joined in confanguinity, not only by the propagation of his like, but\n. by all orders of his kindred in blood. Thirdly, he is joined in friend-\nfhip under that facred bond of benevolence and love, which the Almighty\ncommands every man to exercife towards his neighbour. This is the\nvery cement of fociety, and medicine of life, performing thofe good offi..\nces in c'ivil life which the tree of life promifed in our more perfect fiate;\nand thefe are the fentiments of friendihip which alone can give a true\nreliili to every enjoyment of this world. The moft important of thefe\noblioations, being marriage, is for that reafon placed under fanction of the\nang~lar or fuperior houfe; the fecond tie, being that of blood, claims the\ngovernment of the third houfe; and the eleventh houfe, which perfects\nthis triplicity, is facred to friendiliip. Thefe three houfes, from an\nunion of nature, behold each other in a partile trine, according to the mo-\ntion of the cqu~tor.\n\" The fo.urth and ]aft triplicity -is. that of paffion, which comprehends\nthe three clatfes of human afflictions. The firft or angular houfe of this\ntriplicity, in allufion to its pofition in the lower horizon, is termed the\ndark angle, the depth of night, and bottom of heaven; the den and cave\nof the ftars and planets. To this houft: is committed the firft order of our\nwoes, agreeable to the courfe of nature. Thefe are, infupportable mif-\nfortunes, and vifible decline of life; the firfi: confequences of original\nfin, by which man is devoted to corruption and decay, and to all the infir-\nmities of nature. The fecond order of human affiidions, is tribulation,\nforrow, and difeafe; arifing either from tbe treachery and perfecution of\nenemies, from the chains of fervitude and bondage, or from poverty and\nwant. Thefe, with a long train of confequent miferies, are appropriated to\n. _. the twelfth houfe. The laO: !hock that can be fufiained by human na-\nture!, is death, the final end of all men. This is under government of\nthe eighth houfe,. termed, on this account, the houfe of death. And thefe\nboufes Hkewife, from the conformity of their nature and qualities, con-\nftitutc a partile trine in the equator. \u00b7\n\"Thus\noigitiz~d by Coogle\n\fAN ILLUSTRATION\n\"Thus the termination of this temporal life is the beginning of life\neternal.

Monday,\nMars Tuefday, Mercury Wednefday, Jupiter Thurfday, Venus Friday,\nand Saturn Saturday. Each planet begins his rule the moment the Sun\nappears above the horizon; and continues for one planetary hour, at the\nexpiration of which the next planet in order commences his rule, and con..\ntinties.the fame portion of time, and then the third planet in order governs,\n.and fo on through the whole week. So that, ifI want to know what planet\nrules in any particular hour of the day or night, I take the plan-et which\nbegint rule that day, and reckon in order till I find it. For example, on\nSunday the Sun rules the firft hour, Venus the fecond, Mercury the thirdr\nthe Moon the fourth, .Saturn the fifth, Jupiter the fixth, Mars the feventh,\nthe Sun the eighth, Venus the ninth, and fo on through the whole day\nand fucceeding night, till the Sun riCes again, by which mode of reckon.\ning it will be uniformly found, that each planet will begin\u00b7his govern-\nment at Sun rifing, according to the order above defcribed, to the end~\nof the world. This alfo.evidently appears by the table; for if we begin\nwith the firil column, and reckon down the whole twenty-foar ho~srs,.\nwe find the Moon begins her governm~t at the top of th~ fecond column'\non Monday morning, when the Sun rifes. If we reckon down the fecond\ncolumn, in the fame order, we find Mars begins his rule at the top\u00b7\n, of the third column, on Tuefday morning. So the planets will be found\nto obferve the fame regular order throughout aU the other columns,.\nwhich take in the hours of every day and night throughout the week;\nand for the enfuing week the\u00b7table begins ag.ain in the fame order, and\nwill {o continue without alteration or error, to the end of time..

But, fince no information can be obtained in the\npraCtical part of this fcience wo\nithout them, it is proper to caution all my\nreaders again\u00a3\\: this much miftaken notion; for every pc;rfon who can make\nI\n_ufe of a Ready Reckoner, or 'I'ratjer's Sure Guide, may with equal eafe un-\nderftand all the tables calculated for this work.\no\/\nI\nThe ufe of the Ephemeris, in fetting a figure, is to point out the places\nof the planets at noon, whenever required. For this purpofe, we refer\nto the given day of the month, in the firft column of the right-hand page,\n\u00b7 and oppofite to it, in the fecond column, is the Sun's place or longitude\nthat day at' noon. So alfo, in the fame line of the fucceedi~g columds\nthrough the whole table, are the places of the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter,\nMars, Venus, and Mercury, as fpecified at the top of each diftinti co-\nlumn ; and thefe are the true -places of the Sun, Moon, and planets, \u2022\nevery day throughout the year, precifely at twelve o'clock at noon.\nTherefore, ifthe :figure be erected before that time, the diurnal motion\nof the planets muft be deduCted in hours and minutes, in proportion to\nthe rate they move at per hour; but, if it be ereCted after noorl; then .fo\nmany. hours or minutes mull be added as w~ll bring them to the precife\ntime of erecting the figure. \u00b7\nThe twelve tables of Hou{es are next to be referred to ; and tbefe ar~\ncalculated t<? thew what degrees of each fign poffds the cufps of the\ntwelve houfes of heaven when the figure is erected.

In the fore..\ngoing figure of the heavens, I obferve feventeen degrees one minute of \u00b7\u2022\nupon the afcendant; then, looking down the twelve figns in order in the\nfecond column of fixed fiars, I find 'lR 18. 32, and even with it in the fidl:\ncolumn, the tail of the Lion, which thews that this fiar is a)fo afcend- ,\ning within five degrees of the cufp of the firfi houfe, or afcendant; and\ntherefore I place it in the firft houfe of the figure, under the fign \"l.

But, to make it mons eafy,\nit is nec~ilary to explain what we mean by the poles pofitions, and the\nequations of time. If we imagine twelve great circles, one of which ia\nthe meridian of any given place, to interfea each other in the two poles\nof the earth, and to cut the equator in every fifteenth degree, they will be\ndivided by the poles into twenty\u00b7four femicircles, which divide the equator\ninto twenty\u00b7four equal parts; and as the earth turns on iu axis, the pl~nes\nof tbefe femicircles come fucceffively after one another every hour to the\nfun. And, as in an hour of time there is a revolution of fifteen degrees\nof the eqaator, in a minute of time there will be a revolution of fifteen\nminutes of the equator, and in a fecond of time a revolution of fifteen\nfeconds. Thus, to every place fifteen degrees eaftward from any given\nmeridian, it is noon an hour fooner than on that meridian, bccaufe their\nmeridian comes to the Sun -an hour fooner. And to all places fifteen de-\ngrees weftward, it is hour later, becaufe their meridian comes an hour\nlater to the Sun ; and fo on, every fifteen degrees of motion caufing an\nhour\u2022s difference of time. Therefore they, who have noon an hour later\nthan we, have their .meridiaA, that is, their Jongitude, fifteeft degree&\nweftward from as ; and they1 who have noon aa hour fooner than we,\nhave their meridian or longitude fifteen degrees \u00b7eaftward from ours ; and\nfo, for every hour's difference of time, fifteen degrees difference of longi-\ntude.

That enry 6gn, planet, and fixed ftar, bath a fpecific and particu-\nlar dftB: 'in one houfe, or part of the heavens, difFerent from what they\n\u00b7have in another.\nII. That the Sun by himfclf in any houfe ef. a figure hath one eft\"ea.\n\u00b7the Moon another, Saturn another, Jupiter another, and fo on through\nthe whole. And that this holds good alfo in refped to the figns and\n\u00b7fixed ftan.\nIll. Th-at, as a planet bath one effet't in himfclf, fo hath he another\n\u00b7when joined in conjunction with another planet.; and by a fcxtile, quar-\ntile, trine, and oppofition. \u00b7\nIV. That the quartile and oppofition of Saturn and Mars have oaie e\u00a3-\nfct't; and the quartile and oppofition of Jupiter and Venus another.\nV. That a planet hath one fpecial or fpecific eff'ed: when lord .of th.e-\nfirft houfc or afcendant ; another when lord of the fecond houfe; ano\u2022\nther when lord of the third houfe; and, when lord of the fourth, -\nftill\nanother; and fo on through all the twelve boufes of heaven.\nVI. That whatever-point of the heavens retains the San as figpi6cator\nin any nativity retains a folar force and influence in refpcd to that native\n\u00b7as long as he lives. The fame rule extends to the Moon, and to Sa-\n.turn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus~ &c. wherefore the horofcope or afccndant\n. in every geniture hath and doth contain a radical iniuence over the na-\n.tive's life; the' mid-heaven over his at'tions and occupation; and each of\nthe other houfes over thofe particular events and viciffitudcs to which\nthey refped:ively appertain.\nVII. 'That the fame poil)t in the heavens, which in one nativity is the\nplace of the Sun, may in another nativity be the place of Sat-urn, J upi-\n. ter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, or the Moon. .\nVIII. That every agent, acting by itfelf, acl:s only according to its own\n. peculiar form and virtue. \u00b7\nIX\u00b7. That every patient fufFers according to its own proper nature; \u00b7and\nthat whatever is received is received only in proportion to the capacity of\nthe receiver.\nX.

So that\nfrom a queftion feriou11y propounded almoft as much fatisfaCl:ion may b\u20ac:\ngiven the querent, upon many fubjetls of enquiry, as if his nativity were\nactually known.

Therefore, to afcertain their fincedty ort\nthe one hand, and their fitnefs or unfitnefs on the other, the following\nJules moft be obfcrved. \u00b7\nEreCt the figure as before direCl:e~; and, if the fign afcending ant! the\nplanet in the afcendant defcribe exacHy the perfon of the querent, . the\nquefi:ion is radical, -and fit to be judged. But, if either the very begin-\nning or extreme end \u00b7only of the ftgn afcends, it wilt not be prop~r te\ngive judgment; for it denotes the querent to be a knave, and the queftion\n. a forgery, propofed merely out of ridicule and intemperate mirth\u2022 . This \u00b7_#.\nrule I have often verified in praBice, by dired:ly charging the querent with ?\/\n(uch defign; ond the\u00b7etfeet this unexped.ed difcovery had upon them has\nufually produced \u00b7an acknowledgment of it. .The fame thing is indicated\nby the quartile or oppofition of the Moon with the lord of the feventh\nhoufe; or by the Moon being void of courfe, or combuft; which pofitions\nlikewife denote the queftion to be improperly and incorreClly ftated.

But, whenever, the tef-\nhmon~es or figmficato-rs 10 the :figure are found equally fl:rong for \u00b7and\nagainft the matter propounded, it ought not.to be adjudget;l J for the.artift\nknows not which way the balance may yield, and therefore judgement\n1hould be deferred to a future time. \u00b7\nThere is one rule by which the radicaJnefs of.a quefl:ion may be afcer-\ntained with gr~ater \u00a2crtainty, or at leaft with lefs probability of mif\n..\ntake, thi~ by any other ; and this is by the moles with which every ,\nperfon is more or lefs marked\u2022. It is really an aftonifuing fa~ and no\nlefs extraordinary than true, that thefe moles or marks are aU uniformly\ndiftin&uifued by the figna and planets which pr~vaU at the tim~ of birth,.\n'if not abfoluteJy produced by them. It was the truth and univcrfality\nof this obfervation which firtl led to the \u00b7difcovery of that aft\"edion and\n. government which the cdeftial fig~s have opon the different members of\nmao's hody ; a faa fo obvious, that, notwithftanding all endeavours to\nrefute\u00b7 the idea ~f planetary influence, yet this fact is annually recorded\u00b7\nin etery almanac, and finds a place in almoft every other aftronomical\n\u00b7publication.\nAccording to this rule, whenever a perfon comes to propouoq a quef-\ntion, let a figure of the twelve houfe& be erected for the querent: \u00b7then\nnote what fign is upon the cufp of the afcendant, and in the part of the\nquerent's body which that fig~ governs, if the queftion be radical, the\nquerent will have a mole. For inftance, if Aries be .the fign afcending\nat the time, the mole will be on the head or face; if Taurus, on the neck\nor throat; if Gemini, pn the arms odhoulders; ifCancer, on tht breath\nand fo UpOn any other part of the body which the fign afcending thall\ngovern. Obferve next, in which of the twelve houfcs the lord of the\nafcendant is pofited, and in that part of the body the fign governs which\nbappt:os to fall upon the\u00b7cufp of that houfe will the qucrent have another\nmole. Next Qbfcrve the tign defcendiDJ on the cufp of the fixth houfe,\nand in whatever part of the body that J1gn\u00b7 governs the querent will find\nanother mole ; and upon that member alfo which is ugnified by the fign\nwherein the lord of the tixth houfe is pofited will be found another.\nObferve alfo what ftgQ tbe Moon is pofitcd in, aad io.that part of the .\nbody which is governed \u00b7by it fuall tbe,nativc or querent find ~nother\nmole.

And, if the planet which gives the mole be much :impeditc.d or\nafffict\"ed-r thcr mark:. or mole will be larger .and more vifible.\nIf the fign and planet which gives\u00b7 the mark or mole be mafc~1line; it\u00b7\nis then ntuatcd on the\u00b7 right ude of the body; but if feminine, on the .\n~ft fide. If the fignificator. or planet which gives the mole be found\u00b7~\u00ad\nbove the hori30n, that is,. from the cufp of the afcendant .to the cufp of\u00b7\nthe feventh, either\u00b7 in the twelfth,. eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, or\u00b7fe-\nventh, houfe, the mark\u00b7 or mole will be Qn \u00b7the fore part of the body; but\u00b7\nif !he fignifieator be under tlie earth,. th~t is,. in ; either the. firft, kcond,\nthird, fourth,. fifth, or 6xtb,, houfe, it\u2022 wdl be fituatod on the back:.\nor hinder part of the body. If only a few degrees ofthofign afcend upon.\ntile horofcope, or defcend on tbe fixth ; or if the lord' ofthe\"afcendant,\nlord of the fixth, or the Moon, be pofited in the beginning of any fign J\nthe mole or mark will be found upon the upper part of the member thofe\nfJgns govern. If half th~ degrees of a fign afcend, or the fignificators be\npofitcd in the middle of any fign, the mark\u00b7or mole will be in the middle\nof-the member; but, if the laft degrees of a fign afcend, or the figninca-\u00b7\ntors are in the latter degrees of a fign, the mark or mole wiU then be \u00bb\u00b7\u00b7\ntuated on the lower part of the member fuch fign governs. . .\nIf the queftion be radical, the time rightly taken, and the querent fin..:\neere, and of fufficien~' age, this rute will feldom or ever be fouod to fail. : \"'\nIa afcertaining the exaCt time-of any perfon's nativity, I have found it of\nexcellent ufe; never having been once deceived by it in the fmaJieft de- \u00b7\ngree. In company I have frequently tried the experiment upon a llr.an-\nger, and ever found it correfpond, to the aftoni~ent of all perfons\nprefent ; and it is an experiment which any reader may eafily make upon\n))imfelf.or friends. B'ut in the months of November and December, .\nwhen figns of Jhort afcenfions are upon the afcendant, great care mull; be\ntaken to be exaa in point_of time ; for in thofe months the Sm1 is f~\u00ad\nqoently not. vifible, and clocks are not always to \u00b7be depended upon; ;\ntherefore without proper care the right afcendant may eafily be miffed,\nfor Pifces\u00b7aad Aries both afcend in the fpace of fifty minutes, 'GDd Aqua-\nries and Taurus in little more than an hour; but, if the time be taken ex.: \u00b7\nad:, no one need ever miftruft the certainty of thefe rules, and the\u00b7 exatt\nconf~rmily of the marks or moles to tile figns and planets which tepee\u00b7\n\u00b7 fent\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f190 A N \u00b7 I L L U \u00b7S T It .A T I 0 N\nfent them.

If you would fpeak with a perfon that you have f-a-\nmiliar and confiant dealings with, but no way related, take the feventh\nhoufe and his lord to fignify him, th<lt is the feventh from the afcend~ntl\nfor the afcendant always fignifies the querent. If the lord of the fe-\n~entb be.in any of the fo&Jr angles, viz. in the firft, fourth, feventb, or\nJenth, houf~s, the perfon you would fpeak with is certainly at home. If\nthe lord of the feveoth be in any of the{ucccdent houfes, viz. in the fc..\ncond, fifth,. eighth, or eleventh, he is not then at home, but is near it,\nand may with a little diligence be f.s>und; but if the lord of the feventh\nhe in any one of the. cadent houfcs, viz. the third. fixtb, ninth, or\ntwelfth, the party is far from home, and confequently cannot be fpoken\nwith if fought for. If the lord of the afcendant apply to the lord of the\nfeventh by a friendly afpeet at the time of enquiry, the querent may per-\nhaps meet the quefited, or accidentally hear of him by the way. Or, if\nJbe Mo~n or any other planet transfer the light of the lQrd of the fevcn:h\n.to t~ lo~d of the afc:endant, it denotes the fame thing.

But, if the perfon enqui-\nred after be a relation, then the lord of the feventh is not to be taken,\nbut the lord of that houfe which fignifies fuch relation; as, if it be a\nbrother, then the lord of the third muft be referred to; if a father, re-\ngard muft be had to the lord of the fourth; if a fon or daughter, obferve\nthe lord of the fifth, .and fo on; and, according to their poiitions, Judge\nas above fpecifi.ed.\nlf the Party lrmg a\/'.fent !Je ~eat\/ or alive 1\nHerein alfo muft be confidered what relation the querent hath to the\nparty quefited, and take the figni6cator accordingly. But, if there be no\nrelation between them, then take the afcendant, his lord, and the Moon,\nto fignify the party that is abfent; and judge thus: If the lord of the\nafcendant, or the Moon, be in conjunction with the lord of the eighth, .\nor a planet in the eighth, and no benevolent tt\"fl:imonies concur, the ab-\nfent party is certainly dead. Or when the Moon, and the lord of the\nafcenda.nt, 1hall be in oppofition to the lord of the eighth, from the fe-\n. cond and eighth, or from the fixth and twelfth, houfes, the abfent party\n\u00b7 is likewife dead.\u00b7 If the lord of the afcendant be in the fourth, and the\nMoon in the feventh, \u00b7iri quartile to him, it iliews great danger to the\nquefited, if not abfolute death. When an evil planet iliall tranilate the\nlight of the lord of the eighth unto the lord of the afcendant, or of the\nlo.rd of 'the afcendant to the lord of the eighth, it is moft probable the\nabfent party is dead. If the lord of the afcendant and the Moon be in\nthe fourth houfe from the afcendant, or in the boufe of death, and either\ncombuft, or in their fall, or joined with the lord of the eighth, the par-\nty quefited is undoabtedly deceafed;; but if none of thefe pofitions -hap-\npen, and on the contrary you find -the Moon, and the afcendant, and its\nlord, ftrong and well fortified, the abfent party is alive and well. If the\nlord of the afcendant, or the Moon, feparate from the lord of the fixth,\nthe abfent party has been lately fick s if from the lord of the eighth,\nhe .has been in danger of death; if from the lord of the twelfth, he has\nbeen in prifon, and fuffered much anxiety of mind.

But, if none of thefc poutions hap-\npen, then note Jupiter, the natural fignificator of fubfrance_\n; or Venus,\nwho alfo is a fortune; or the Dragon's head, which always portends\ngood; and if they be free from the ill beams of the infortunes. or happen.\nto be ,polited in the houfe of fubfiance, the querent will moft certainly be\nrich, and will bear great (way in the place where he lives. When Saturn,\n.Mars~ or the Dragon's tail, are pofited in the fecond houfe, or affiid: the\nlord of the fecond, Jupiter, Venus, or part of fortune, it is an argument\nthat the quereot will not attain riches; or, if he were in a good capacity,\nhe will be reduced to a very mean fituation.

When\na fortunate planet is in the afcendant, and the lord of the afcendant be..\n. holds the cufp of the third, or applies friendly to the lord of the third, it\nis an argument of agood difpofition in the querent, and fpeaks him willing\nto accord with his brethren, kindred, and neighbours. And if a fortune\nbe in the third, and the lord of the third apply in harmony to the lord of\nthe afcendant, the brethren, kindred, or neighbours, are moil indulging.\nThofe perfons whofe fignificators do not apply are m0ft imperious, and\napt ta dif.1gree; and thofe, whofe fignificators make application, are flexi-\nble, willing, and yielding, and defirous of agreement and concord. When\nSaturn, Mars, or the Dragon's Tail, in fuch a queilion, thall be in the ,\nafcendant, it denotes the perfon enquiring to be obfiinate, and averfe\nto a fr-\niendly agreement; but if they, or either of them, are pofited in\nthe thir-d houfe, the brethren, neighbours, and kindred, are of a malicious\ndifpofition. And, if it happens that Saturn or Mars be peregrine, re-\ntrograde, or combuft, the malice and mifchief they threaten will be the\nmore dangerous. When Saturn or the Dragon's Head are in the third,\nthe neighbours are obfiinate, and the kindred covetous and fparing. If\nMar~. ~he kindred are treacherous, and the neighbours dithoneft. And\nthis is more certain, when they are out of their eifential dignities.\nOf the Conditton and Ejlate qf an abfint Brother?\nTo refolve this queftion, confider the lord \u00b7of the third houfe, for that\nhath lignification of brethren; and the houfe where he is pofited, becaufe\nthat {hews the ftate and condition of the quefitcd.

But if he be found\nin any of the obfcure puts of the figure, which are naturally evil, as the\nfixth, eighth, or twelfth, houfes.. the abfent brother is not well, nor in\na \u00b7profperous fituation. Wh!n the lord of the third is found in the eighth,\neither in conjunCtion, fextile, or trine, of one of the fortunes, the abfent\nbrother is not well; or if the lord of the third be joined to evil planets\nin the fixth houfe, or in conjunction with the lord of the fixth, he is\nthen in an infirm and fickly condition; and if the lord of the fixth be in\nthe third, except tho lord of the third be well difpofed, it denotes the\nfame. Then note whether the lord of the third be in conjunCl:ion with\nthe lord of the eighth, or in combufiion; .for fuch a configuration\u00b7 de..\nclares he will die of the infirmity. But, if the lord of the third be in the\nfeventh, the brother is in the fame country he went into at firfi, and con-\ntinues there; and his condition is neither well nor ill. If the fignificator\nbe in the eighth, the abfent brother is in danger of death, particularly\nif he be combufi, or in conjunClion with the lord of the eighth, in con-\njunction or afpeCl: of the infortuoes; for thefe are ll:rong arguments of\ndeath. When the lord of the third is in the ninth, it denotes that the\nabfent brother is removed from the place he firfi went to, and is gone\ninto a more remote country. And if he be in tl;le tenth, in conjunci:.ion\nor good afpeCl of the fortunate planets, and with receptiqn, it denotes\nhim to have acquired fome honour, office, or preferment, in the place\nwhere he lives. But, if he be in conjunction, quartile, or oppofition,\nof the infortunes, combufi, or any other way infortunated, it is to be\nfeared the abfent brother is dead.

When Saturn, Mars,\nor the Dragon~, are pofited in the third houfe, or afflict the lord\nthereof, or the Moon, it portends an unlucky journey to the querent, and\nvery ill fuccefs therein. Saturn fuews the querent to be melancholy and\npenfive in his journey J Mars and the Dragon's Head lhcw him to be in\ndanger of thieves and robbers; and, if they are in human figns, oc fiery,\nir denotes him to be lamed or wounded in his journey.\u00b7 When the lord\nof the afccndant is retrograde, the qucrent will return again before he\nhath gone to the place he intended ; and, if the fignificators be 11ow, ho\nmakes but little bafte or fpecd in his journey.

If the fignificator of the meifenger applies to an infer-\ntune by quartile or oppofition, and this before he can\u00b7 feparate from the\nlord of the feve1;1th, it .fignifics that the meffenger has met with fame\nimpediment in the bufinefs he went about from the party to whom he\nwas feot.

I then fought the\nMoon's latitude, and found it one degree thirty\u00b7three minutes fouth,\nwhich, added to the above, make thirteen degrees thirty-two minutes;\nand, as the fignificators are in moveable figns, I computed the time by\nweeks and \u00b7 days, and predicted this illnefs would befal him about the\n.2oth of July following; and that, after he ihould be reftored to health\nagain, he would go on, without fuftaining any other ferious indifpofition,\nuntil the fixty-ninth year of his age J about which time I conceive the\nfunctions of life will be naturally extinguHhcd, by a ~;omplication of in\u00b7\nfirmides.\nI have lately had the pleafure of converfing with the gentleman on the\nfubjetl: of this queftion.

Now Saturn, the gcnt.Je~aa's figai.\nficator, is .-emarkably well J>Qfiecd in tbc fifth houfe, and has Venw\nwithin his or~, applying lO him by conjunCtion ; which is a .very p~w...\nerful ~nd.cation that his aifed:ions are fincere and honourable, aAd that\nhis mind is fully b~nt to tho marriage-ftate. The Sun likewife, being\nin a fextile afpeet wi~h Mars, the lady's fignificator o( marriage, plaialy \u00b7\nthews her inclination to matrimony to be ftrongly fixed, and her affec..\ntions perfetl:l,y 1incerc. \u00b7\nThe next thing to be confidered, is, whether there be any fruftra.tion,\nor impediting afped: between thefe fignificators; and, I find t.he Moon\nand Venus, the gentleman's fignificators of marriage, are applying to a\nquartile afpea. with each other. This is an evident proof th~.t the mar-\nriage is prolonged by the interference of fome other woman, of this ge.o.-\ntleman's intimate acquaintance, becaufe the afpeet is mad<: in a feminiQC\nfign .; but as the Moon, in feparatin~ from Ven~, ~ppl.i.es to a perft.Ct\ntrine with Mars, the querent's. principal fignifica,tor of m.arriage, and\n\u00b7 alfo to a fextile of the Sun, her natural fignificator in the figure, it totally\nremoves the evil effeas of the malefic afpeCt, aQd leaves th_e path free anci\nunobftrud:ed to th,e gates of Hymen~ This opinion is gre~tly firengthen-\ned by confidering the mode iri which their fignificators ar~ feverally dif..\npofed. Saturn difpofes of the Sun, who is pofited in the term of Venus\u2022\nand Venus, Saturn, a~d the Moon, are all difpofed of by the benevol.~nt\nplapet Jupiter, who is himfelf difpofed of by Mars, the principal figni-\nficator of this lady's marriage, and who thus triumphs over every obftacle\nto the celebration of their nuptials. I therefore could not hefitate in de-\nclaring to the lady, in the fulleft and mofi fatisfactory terms, that the\ngentleman who courted her bad a fincere and tender regard for her; and\nthat, though fome circttmftances might have happened rather unfavour-\nable to her withes, yet the might refl perfectly a1fured that he was the\nman allotted to be her hu1band.\nApparently well fatisfied with thefe declarations, the proceeded to en-\nquire in what length of time this defirable circumfiance might come to\npafs. To gratify her withes in this particular, I referred again to the\nfigure, where the Moon, the gentleman's principal fignificator of mar-\n'iage, wants upwards of eleven degrees of forming il perfect fex_\ntile afpect\n' 2 with\n\u00b7, Digitized by Coogle\n\fI\n.\n' \u00b7 ' r\n..\nAN ILLUSTRATION\n..\nwith tbe Sun..(the lord of \u00b7the \u2022afcendant~and the fame to Mars, her figni..\nficator of marriage ; and therefore, by converting the degrees into_\n_\n_\nt~j~ ,\nby the rule heretofore given, I fixed her marriage at about the end of\nthree months, \u00b7affuring her it would not exceed that tiO)e. The event\nhas fully proved the truth of the predidion; the lady and gentleman have\nboth done me the hoaour of a call fincc the celebration of their nuptials.,\nand I found they \u00b7were married precifely at the time I had predicted ; I\nhave likewife the additional .pleafare .to find, that my a1furances to the\nlady wer~ productive of frefh efteem and clofer attachment to the man of\nher hearr, and they now live a pattern of conjugal felicity.\nQ._U E ST I 0 N XI.

The pofition of Mercury in the firft,\nwhere Saturn is fituated, plainly indicates thefe winds to be highly con..\nducive to'the fafety of the enemy, but of dangerous tendency to the\nBritHh fleet, in cafe of a purfuit.\nAfter duly weighing the natural influences and eff'ects of the configu-\nrations in, this figure, which are the true and genuine ftate of the hea-\nvens at the time of the engagement, I hefitated not to declare, that both\ncommanders had a ftronger inclination to preferve peace than to break it,\nand that a clofe connected and decifive aB:ion was Aot to happen, owing\nto Saturn being in the afcendant on the fide of the Englith, with two\nmuch thought and deliberation; and to Mars being in his fall in the\n2 digniti~\u2022\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\ndignities of Jupiter, on the part of the French, which declares their\nwatchfulnefs to run away.

Wherefore the ancient profeffors. of this art, to remove the\nerrors in the cornmon or eftimate time of birth, have contrived \u00b7fe- .\nveral ways of rectifying a nativity; and have given fuch rules for this\npurpofe, that the true time of birth may be thereby correctly afcertain..\ned. This rectification may be effected three different ways ; firft, by\nthe Tr11tina\u2022 Hermetis, or Trutine of Hermes; fecondly, by the Ani-\nmoder of Ptolomy; and,\u00b7 thirdly, by the natural accidents ifthe native.\nThefe three methods I iliall explain fully, when I come to treat of the\nrectih.cations of nativities; futlice it here to fay, that t4e method moftly\nin .ufe, and which is found liable to the le~ft error, particularly i!l the\n\/ \u2022 p~~\nI\nDigitized b~Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\ngeniturei of grown\u00b7 perfons, i.s that .'of rea~fying by fuch accidents as\nmight have befallen them dunng the1r paftl1fe.\nAs the doarine of nativities is the very effence of Aftrology, and the\nprincipal criterion by which mankind will judge of the utility and rea-\nfonablenefs\u00b7 of the fcience, it will be requifite for me in this place to be\nas plain and circumftantial as poffible. It cannot be unentertaining, nor\nwholly ufelefs, even to a common reader, mqoh lefs to tbofe who mean to\nftudy the heart, to know the true grounds upon which this part of the\nfcience is founded ; together with thofe afpecb or configurations at\nbirth, from which our predictions are framed ; and the time alfo when\ntheir influence and effeas will vifibly operate upon the body or affairs\nof the native. In elucidating this fubjett, I ihall be principally guided\n_ by the ~adripartite of the great Ptolomy ; the truth and excellency\nof wbofc doctrine the experience of many ages, and the obfervations of\nthe mofi: intelligent profeffors of this art, have fully eftablilhed and\nconfirmed.\n'\nlt is manifeft to the mofi: fuperfjcial obfcrver, that a certain fecret\npower is diffufed through all things that are near the earth, according\u00b7\nto the nature and properties of the firmament, and circumambient\nair, and to the power and influence of the luminaries and other ce-\nlefiial bodies. The Sun being the {uperior Luminary and the foun-\ntain of life, governs all things that bear relation to the earth, not only\nby varying the feafons, and bringing to perfeCtion the feeds of animals,\nand the fruitfulnefs of plants, the flowing 'of waters and the mutation\nof bodies, but alfo the changes of the day, of heat ~nd moifture, of\ndrincfs and CQld, as it hath . refpeCl to the meridian, or mid-beaven.-\nThe Moon ~lfo, being ncareft to the earth, diftils down an amazing in-\nfluence, by which things animate and inanimate are affected and changed.\nRivers arc augmented and dimini\u00a3hed according to her light; the tides\nvary as fue rifes and fets; plants and animals, in whole or in part, ic-\n.- creafe and decreafe with her. In the fame manner the fiars, fixed and\nerratic, as they keep on their uniform courfe, caufc many appearances\naround us, for they produce cold and heat, and wind and rain, by\nwhich alfo things on earth arc fuitably governed; and their mutual con-\nfigarationa...as..their influences co-operate with or oppofe one another,\nproduce variations accordingly. .\nThe power of the Sun is on all hands admitted to be moft prtvalmt,\nas it is obvioufiy mofi: univcrf~l.

This hap-\npens moft frequently, and moll: forcibly, with the Moon, at all the\nchanges. But thefe affections in the fiars operate more oQfcurely, and\nemploy longer time, according to their declination, or as they appear or\ndifappear in our horizon. Hence then, by the rules of nature, _\nand the\ntefiimony of our own reafon and experience, it mufi be admitted, that\nof all the planets, the influ\u00abJnce of the Sun is the moft powerful; and\nthat the influence of the other planets have moft energy, when the\nbeams \u00b7of the Sun co-operate with them. The Moon likewife, by rea-\nCon of her {wiftnefs, and proximity to the earth, modifies and conveys\nthefe influences to fublunary bodies, with a force fuperior to all the\nother ftars. And thefe influences are always moft powerful, and moll:\nvifible in their effeCts, when this mediation of the Moon is exercifed in\ncohveying the influences of the ftars to the Sun, or of tbe Sun to the\nother ftars, and thence to the earth. But, in defining thefe varying pro.\nperties and effects, particular regard muft be had to the latitude, decli-\nnation, riling, and fetting, of the ftars, both fixed and erratic, efpecially\nthofe which approach neareft to the ecliptic.\nWhoever contemplates thefe premifes, and attentively obferves the\nafpefrs, will find that not only conjoined bodies are fnbject to the confi-\ngurations of the ftars, but alfo the buddings and perfection of feeds arc\nframed and formed according to the quality with which the heavenly\nmatter and circumambient air is endued. The obfervant hutbandman\nand lhepherd preconjecture the proper feafons for feed-Cowing, planting,\nand procreation of animals, by confulting the ftate of the winds and\nthe face of the fky. The fkilful mariner likewife prepares againft the\ndangers of an approaching ftorm by fimilar obfervations ; but they are\nfrequently deceived for want of better experience, and an adequate know-\nledge of the .courfes and effeCl:s of the heavenly bodies, which, when ex-\nacHy underftood, conduce to an almoft certain prefcience herein. For\nit is found, that he who correCtly knows the motions of the ftars, and\ntheir configurations with the Sun and Moon, and is not ignorant of the\ntimes, nor the place, nor the afpecti, and is well lkilled in the fimple\nways of nature, can admirably foretel, in any feafon, the proper ftate\nand temperature of the air; as that it will be hotter an\"g:ai0''J or colder dlj.vt\nor drier, according to the nature and properties of t e refpective rays\nof the ftars and Moon configurated with t~e Sun. And, as tbefe fpecula-\n.tions are founded upon the moft\u00b7 umple principles of nature, as that the\nSun is hot and dry, and the Moon is cold and moift, and the obferva-\ntiona\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 893\ntiona deduced herefrom are feldom known to vary ; fo, by fimilar qua-\nlities and obfervations, and by rules equally well founded, we obtain a\nlegal and an extenfive prefcience refpeRing man. For; from the natural\nftate of the ambie.nt and heavenly matte-\nr at the time of: the conftruction\nof the body, it is eafy to know in general, the quality and temparature of\neach perfon born ; that fuch 1hall be the formation of his body, and\nfuch the difpofition of his mind, and fuch the future events, advantage-\nous or difadvantageous, of his life, according to the ftate of the heavens\nat that particular time, whether qualified for the production of fuch a\ntemper, or whether inimical to it. Thus, a prefage is not only poffible\nby the laws of nature, but proper and nece1fary to the wifdom and well-\nbeing of focieqr.\nThe errors of thofe who do not underftand the fundamental princi\u00b7\nples of this learning have doubtlefs afforded ftrong and plaufible reafons\nto the bulk of mankind for difcarding it altogether, and for confidering\nthofe events which others have more fuccefsfully afcertained, to be the\neffeCts of mere chance. But furely a doHrine is not to be rejected, be\u2022\ncaufe fome of its followers are vicious or ignorant. In this !peculation,\nabove all others, reafonable allowances \u00a3hould be made, as well for the\nweaknefs of human comprehenfion, as for the great and undefinable ex-\ntent of the contemplation. Much depends upon the ability of the phy-\nfician, in modifying and proportioning his prefcription, no~ only to cor-\nrefpond with the ftate of the difeafe, but alfo with the temperature and\nconftitution of the patient. In the fubject under confideration, a judg-\nment no lefs fagacious is abfolutely nece1fc1ry; becaufc:: the quality of the\nheavenly matter is often conjectural, and the mixtures of different af..\npects and influences are fometimes fo_complicated, that the brighteft\nunderftanding can fcarcely arrange them with precifion. \u00b7\nBut the confideration of Nativities, in points which relate to the par-\nticular temper and difpofition of refpective perfons, hath other caufes-\nin nature too apt to be forgotten, or perhaps lightly paffed over as cir-\ncumftances of no moment. But it is undeniably true, and muft be ad-\nmitted on all hands, that the place of birth will often make confldera-\nble difference in thofe who are born ; and though the feed be the fame\nfr.:>m which they are procreated, and though the conftitution of the\nheavens be the fame, yet the diverfities \u00b7of countries wherein they\u00b7 arc\nborn will naturally produce a difference in their bodies and minds. Be-\nfides this, a different education and cuftom will form a different difpo-\nfition and manner of life; as does alfo the different fituation or cla1fes\n1 m\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f39+ AN ILLUSTRATION\nin which mankind are brought up, .and to which they are accuftomed.\nTherefore he who does not attentively confider each of thefe diftinEHons,\nand un~te them judicioufiy with the caufes produced by the ambient and\nheavenly matter, will meet with great uncertainty in his concJufJons.\nFor, although the power of heaven is confeffedly the grearefi, and with\nthefe all the others are conceived as adjuvant caufes, yet they do not al-\nways aifume the circumambient matter as a concaufe ; confequently\nthofe who attempt to predict from the motion of the heavenly bodies\nalone, without-due reference tO' thefe confiderations, will entail contempt\nupon themfelves, and difgrace upon the fcience.\nBut that afirological preditlions are poffible, and to be defined with\ngreat precifion, when properly managed, is an atfertion moll: true,\nand which, I flatter myfelf, I have already made manifdl. It remains,\ntherefore, that we fpeak of the advantages of this benevolent difpenfa-\ntion of Providence; for, if a foreknowledge be advantageous or necef..\nfary to the fafety and future happinefs of the foul, what can be more fo in\nrefpeel of the body, fince it affords not only temporal .delight, happinefs,\nand pJeafure, but ~nables us to underftand things both divine and hu-\nman? Whatever happens in the courfe of nature, either neceffarily, or\naccidentally that materially affeds our profperity or adverfity, and either\nprolongs life or defiroys it, if they happen fuddenly -and unexpectedly,\nconfound with fear, or tranfport with joy; but, if they are foreknown,\nthey fortify the mind by fuch foreknowledge, and prepare it for fufl:ain-\ning the heft or worfi occurrences with ca1mnefs and ferenity. In what\nrctpect therefore is man fuperior to the irrational part of the creation, if he\ncannot bear to know the hour of his diffolution ? The terms of our ex-\nifience, as every day's experience repeatedly thews, are that we muft\nfuffer death. Where then, to minds fraught with reafon and integrity,\ncan be the horror, the diffrefs, or calamity, of knowing the time when\nthat certain event ihall take place? To men of a virtuous habit, {uch\na knowledge muft be invaluable ; and to thofe of lefs fcrupulous prin-\nciples, it cannot be unwelcome, provided reafon or philofophy make up\nany part of their coptliturion. To men of the moll: exemplary conduct,\nit affords fit opportunity of adjufiing their temporal concerns, and re-\nlieves them under the diftreifes and afflictions of this life, by afcertain-\ning the period of their fu1ferings, and by giving them hopes of retribu.. -\ntion and reward in that which will fucceed. To the inconfiderate and\n, worldly minded, it not only gives the fame advantages, but begets in\nthem a proper fenfe ofthe more important concerns of that endlets ftate\nof exiftence, \" from whence no traveller returns.\" For thefe grand\npurpofea\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. \"395\npU1\"pofes c:biely, the all-wife and benevolent hand of .Provideece -feemt\nto baYe pointed out to mankind the Art of Prefcience and PrediRion J\nnot to fay any thing of the innumerable lefs important concerns of bu..\nman affairs, which may oftentimes afford fingular advantage and happi-\nnefs to individuals, as well as to ftates and focieties, by being thus time\u00b7\nly forewarned of what thall hereafter come to pafs. And furely I need\nnot mention a ftronger inftance of the advantages of prefcience, tban\nwh:at will naturally arife from the obfervation of every man of experience\nwhen he looks back upon the occurrences of his paft life, and recolleCts\nbut half the lotfes and inconveniences he has fuftained, only for want of\nthat foreknowledge in worldly aff'airs which the art of prediction fupplics.\n.. We are not however to believe, that the accidents and events of life -:rr\nfo befal men, as though a law were fet over them by fomc inditfolublc\neaufe from above, by which they are of neceffity brought to pafs, no\nother caufe being able to oppofe or prevent them. It were unphilofo.\nphical and abfurd thus to imagine ; for the motion of the heavenly bo..\ndiet is immutable by divine Jaw, and the mutation of earthly thiags is\nclifpofed of and revealtd by a natural ,generation and order, which the fu\"\nperior caufe follows by accident. It is alfo to be obferved, that many\nthings happen to man, not only by reafon of the natural and proper qua..\nlity of the heavenly matter, but alfo by the operation of fome more uni-\nverfal caufes; as by great mutations and mixtures of the elements, plagues\nand pefiilences, and floods and con.ftagrations, are produced, by which\nmultitudes are at once {wept away, and perith under one common fata-\nlity. Thus greater caufes always overcome the lefs, and the ftron~r\nthe weaker; and, whenever the ftronger power.prevails in any grea~ mu-\ntation, the more general eff'etl:s we have been fpeakiog of happcn.--\nOther things likewife happen to individuals; becaufe the natural proper-\nty of each is overcome by the contrariety of the circumambient matter,\nwhether the antipathy thereof be fmall or fortuitous. Now, this being\nadmitted, it becomes apparent that of thofe things which happen gene-\nrally and particularly, be the accident whatever it may, whofe firft\ncaufe is ftrong and irrefiftable, and no other caufe having power to with-\nftand it, come to pafs wholly by neceffity. But thofe accidents\nwhich have a weaker caufe are overthrown, if any other caufe, able to\nwithftand it, is found ; and, if fuch a refilling caufe appears not, then\nthofe accidents happen agreeable to the nature and impulfe of their firft\ncaufe; and they are produced, not through the fi:rength of the caufe, nor\nby 'Deceffity, but becaufe the antipathy by which it might have been\ndefiroyed is neither known nor \u00b7 to be defined. Thus it happens to\nall things \u00b7that have a natural caufe and beginning, as metals, ftones,\nNo. 20. 5 C plants,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f.396 A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N.\nplants, animals, wounds, ficknefs, affecHons, &c. fome of which work\nnece1farily, and others not, except when fomething is found of fuffici-\nent frrength to oppofe their efficient power. Hence it is demonftrable,\nthat, though fimple caufes have natural properties peculiar to themfelves,\nyet there are other caufes equally fimple, which\u00b7opcratc in contad with \u00b7\nthofe of the former, and by which the bare fimple nature of each is\nchanged by mutation into a third quality which differs in nature from\neither of -the former; according to which fuch fimple natural proper~\nties are either partly or wholly changed, or otherwife frufi:rated or ai\"':'\nverted. As for example, in the weather, the Sun, in his own- fimple\nnature, is the fountain of light and heat; but, being joined with Saturn~\nnever fails, if not prevented by fome other apparent caufe, both in win-\nter and fummer, to produce cold and cloudy weather. But, ifMars\u00b7hap-\npcns to be joined in configuration with them, the cafe is . altered, and,\ninfi:ead of cold, the weather will not fail, in fummer, to be hot and ful-\ntry, though at the fame time cloudy, corrufcuous, and diforderJy; and,\nin winter, remarkably clofe and warm, though lowering and turbulent;\nmore efpecially if attended with a new or full Moon. Thefe are facts\nfounded upon a rational hypothefis, and proved by long experience and\nconftant obfervation.\nThefe preliminaries being laid down, and confidered as the ground-\nwork of Aftrology, it fo1lows that thofe, who would wi\u00a3h to be proficient\nin it, lhould learn topredid futurities after a natural way, by fuch prefd-\nence as nature .has pointed out, and not by an inconfiderate or vain opi-\nnion that this fhall happen, becaufe it hath many great and efficient\ncaufes which it is impoffible to refift; or that this lhall not happen,\nbecaufe it.hath refifting affections. Calculators of nativities, therefore,\nwhen th6y fpeak of thofe things which may come to pafs, can do it\u00b7in\nno other way, conformable to truth and nature, but by the power and\neffeHs of the circumambient matter or afpeas, which, being more or\nlefs incJined to fuch a temperature, will produce fuch an accident, fta-\nture of body, or difpofition of mind. As when a phyfician a1ferts that\nan ulcer will eat away or putrefy, or a naturalift that the loadftone will\natrraft iron ; not becaufe it is neceffary that the ulcer 1bould eat away\nor. putrefy, or the loadfione attract; but, if the contraries are not known\nnor their effeCts prevented, thefe circumfta.nces will alfure~ly _\nhappen,\naccording to the caufe and confequences of things, as they have been\nfrom the beginning of the world. Thus it happens~ and thus we ought\nto jooge, in the.calculation of nativities; for thofc events which per-\npetually fall in upon all human affairs, are produced according to the\n1~-ceffion of natur~l order, either becaufe things that may oppofe and\nprevent\noigi~ized by Coogle\n\fOF ASTROLOGY.\u2022 397\nprevent- are not found, or bccaufe they arc not\u00b7\u00b7known. And again,\nevents known naturally, and according to order, and thofe things being\nfound which difagree and oppofe, they are then either wholly prevented.\nor elfe come to pafs with very fmall effeCt, and are fcarcely vifible in\ntheir operation.\n\u00b7 Now,\u00b7feeing there is both in generals and particulars fuch a confe.\nquence, it is curious to remark, that -though many people believe in \u00b7\ngenerals, and allow it is poffible to prognofticate upon that' fyftem, and\nalfo think it advantageous towards prefervation and health; yet in par-\nticulars tney will not allow the fame operations to have any force. For\nmany confefs they know the proper feafons, and the fignification of the\nfixed fi:ars, and the afpecb of the Moon, and they obferve them for the\neftabli\u00a3hment of their health, and to reduce their conftitutions to a good\nand regular temperature, in fummer by cooling medicaments, and in\nwinter by beating. They alfo obferve the fignifications of the fixed\nftars, for the purpofes of navigation; and they plant, and fow, and for-\nward vegetation, by obferving the different afpects of the Moon; and\nno one fuppofes thefe general effeas either impoffible \"Or ufelefs. But\nin particulars, as of cold or heat, which increafe and decreafe in their\nproper temper, and by the properties and mixtures of other matter, they\nneither believe it poffible to foretel, or conceive that we may be pre-\nferved from, the confequences attending them. But the caufe of this\nopinion, is the difficulty of knowing particulars, and the management\nof them, with precifion and truth ; and becaufe men are feldom found of\nfo penetrating a comprehenfion, that none of the contraries be hidden\nfrom their view ; hence, the oppofing power of influence for the moft\npart not being joined with a foreknowledge in the effe:t. produced by firft\ncaufes without impediment, they judge of things fimply, as though\nimmutable and impoffible to be prevented. But as in the art of predic-\ntion its poffibility appears worthy of confideration, although it is not\naltogether infallible, this prefervative part is certainly worthy of parti.\ncular regard, fince it may bring relief to many, though not a perfect cure\ntoaJI. For this reafon the Egyptians, finding the efficacy of this art,\nevery when~ joined phyfic to prognoftic aftronomy; and hence it is ap\u00b7\nparent, tha\u2022, if they had thought futurities could not be removed or di-\nverted, they would never have prefcribcd certain remedies and perfcrva.\ntives againtl the effcel: of the ambient, prefent or to come, whether in\ngeneral or particular cafes ; they therefore fought out a method at once\nadvantageous and profitable, that by aftrology the quality of the fubja-\ncent tempe~aments, and the accidents which come to pafs by the influ-\nence of the heavenly bodies, might be difcovered and known; but\nJ the\n\u2022\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f. 8\n-39\n\u2022\nAN IL. ~USTRATION\nthe -medic-al art, to difi:IngnHh the 6mpatbies and antipathies of each.\nand to underftand the natural cure of prefent difeafes, and the true\nmode of prefervation from future. For without this fpecits of aftro-\nnomic knowledge the medical art is found in many cafes to fdi) ; though\n.J am ready to allo~ that there are not remedies to be found for aU bodies\nand difeafes.\nThefe obfervations become clear and obvious, from a confideration\nof the planets and their afpech. The Sun is found by nature to caufe\nheat and drinefs in a moderate degree. His power and influence is moft\nvifible to our fenfes, by reafon of his magnitude, and the manifeft mu-\ntation of the feafons; fer, by how much the nearer he approaches to\nour vertical point, by fo much tile more he flirs up heat in us, and\nfubjetts us to his nature. But the nature of the Moon is chiefly ~oHl\u00ad\nening; for, being nearer the earth, the exhales the Yapours of all moift\nbodies, and thus evidently affeCts ,all moifi: things, and putrefies them;\nbut, becaufe of her analogy with the Sun, fue moderately participates of\nheat. The planet Saturn cools and dries, becaufe he is far diftant from\nthe heat of the Sun and vapours of the earth ; but he cools moft abun..\ndantly, and dries mofi: moderately. The other planets alfo receive\nvirtue according to the configurations they make with the Sun and\nMoon. Mars ddeth much, and burns, becaufe of his hot and fiery na-\nture\u00b7; but the infiuence of Jupiter is temperate, becaufe he moves be-\ntween the coldnefs of Saturn and the heat of Mars. Venus hath nearly\nthe fame temperature, but in a different meafure, becaufe of her vicini-..\nty to the Sun ; fue moifi:ens moft, as does the Moon, through the great~\nnefs of their light, by which they a1fume the moifture of the vapours of\nthe earth. Mercury fometimes dries, and fometimes moiftens, according\n\u2022to his pofition and configuration with other fi:ars. Hence arife the four\nprincipal humours, from whence all bodies are engendered. Two of\nthem are generative and at1ive, the hot, and the moift; for by thefe are\nall things joined together, and increafed; and two are corruptive and\nhurtful; the dry, and the cold; for by thefe all things are dHfolved,\nand deftroyed. Wherefore two of the planets, viz. Jupiter and Venus, are\ndefined to be benefics, becaufe of their -benevolent temperature, and\nbecaufe heat and moifture equally abounds in them; and likewife the\nMoon, for the fame reafons. But Saturn and Mars, being of an oppo-\nfite nature, are defined to be of a malevolent and deftruetive influence, by\nreafon of the extreme cold of the one, and the violent heat of the other.\nBut the Sun and Mercury, being of a controvertible nature, are found to\nproduce both thefe influences, according to the nature, force, and quality,\nof the afpeets or configurations they make with other bodies.\nAs\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T ll 0 L 0 G Y. 399\nAs there are fo.ur diftiacft llumours or qualities incident to the }'lancte.\n(o are there two primary foxes )ly which they are diftinguHhed, namely,\nthe mafculine and the feminine.

But, when the conftitution is\ncontrary, they are weaker, by reafon of the temperament and mixture of\ncontrariety, atrctled by the heating ftars in cold conftitutions, and by\nthe moift in dry. In the fame manner each of the other conftitutions\nhave power, according to the proportions of their mixtures. To thefe\nwe may join the mutual properties of the twelve figns of the zodiac ;\nfor their general temp~ratures are agreeable to the feafons fubjea to each\nngn J and they obtain fome other qualities arifing from their analogy to\nthe Sun, Moon, and ftars ; and thefe confiderations of the agreement or\ndifagreement of the natures and mixtures of the various influences of the\nftars, figns, and parts of heaven, are of no {mall confequence in aftrolo-\ngical contemplations. \u00b7\nOf the twelve figns, fome are termed tropics, fome equinoCtial, fome\nfixed, and others bicorporal. The tropics are two; the firA: from the\n{qmmer folA:ice, the thirty degrees of Cancer ; and the other from the\nwinter folftice, the thirty degrees of Capricorn. Thefe are called tro-\npics, becaufe, when the Sun is pofited in the beginning of thefe figns, he\nturns back out of the courfe of latitude or declination to the contrar.ies,\nmaking fummer by his entering into Cancer, and winter by his patfagc\ninto Capricorn. There are alfo two of the figns equinoCtial; one from\nthe vernal equinox, which is Aries ; the other from the autumnal\nequinox, which is Libra. Thefe are fo termed, becaufe, wheneveYer the\nSun enters the beginning of them, he makes the days and nights equal\nall the world over.\nOf the other eight figns, four are fixed and four bicorporal.

Thefe afped:s are of two\nforts, or cla1fes; viz. zodiacal and mundane. The principal zodiaeal\nafped:s are the fextile, quartile, trine; and oppofition; and, though the\nconjund:ion cannot properly be termed an afpeCl:, yet it may come un-\nder the more general name of a familiarity, common to all the afpeCle.\n1'he conjund:ion is formed by two planets being bodily joined, or meet-\ning in the fame degree and minute of a fign. The fextile is formed by\ntwo planets when they are two figns, or fixty degrees, afunder ; thcf\nquartile, when three figns, or ninety degrees, afunder J the trine, when\nfour figns. or one hundred and twenty degrees, afunder; and the. oppo-\nfition. when fix figns. or one hundred and eighty degrees, afunder;\n\u00b7 which\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 P A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\n~hich being jutl one half of the great cirde, places the planets exactly\nfacing one another. The fmaller or inferior zodiacal afpeas are the\n{eriliquadrate of forty--\nfive degrees; the quintile, of feventy-two degrees;\n\u00b7 the fefquiquadrate, of one hundred and thirty-five degrees; and the\nbiquintile, of one hundred and forty-four degrees. And thefe are either\npartile or platic; partile, when the conjuntHon or afped is made in\nthe fame degree and minute, and platic when. not configurated in the\nfame degree and-minute, but only within the orbs of the afpecting pla~\nnet. Moreover, thefe afpech are either dexter or finifter; dexter, when\ncontrary to the fucceffion of the figns, as a planet in Leo cafts a fextile\ndexter to another planet in Taurus. Sinifter afpeds are according to\nthe fucceffion of the figns; agreeable to which, a planet in Aries calls\nhis trine finifter to another in Leo; or one in Leo cafts a trine finifter\n\u00b7to another in Sagittarius.\nMundane afpetls are thofe which are made in the meridional circle,\nin reference t~ the earth, and confift of only the fextile, quartile, trine,\nand oppofitiofr; though there are other familiarities which we call pa-\nrallels, and thefe both muhdane and zodiacal. Of thefe familiarities,\nthe conjunction is good with benevolent ftars; but with malevolent bad.\nThe quintile, biquintile, ft:xtile, and trine, are alfo good and fortunate;\n\u00b7but \u00b7the femiquadrate, fefquiquadrate, quartile, and oppofition, are evil\nand unfortunate. Thefe good and evil influences proceed more from the\n\u00b7 nature and quality of the ftars, than from the nature of the figns they\npoff'efs ; for it is found that even good afpeas of malefic planets will pro-\nduce mifchief, though not in fo great a degree as the evil configurations.\n'\u00b7: Zodiaca\u00b7l parallels are what are commonly called Antifcians, and are\nnothing more than paraiJels of declination, or two points in the hea- '\nvens at equal diftances from the beginning of any of the tropics, or\nequinotlial points. For example; one planet in ten degrees of Aries.\nand another in twenty degrees of Pifces, are in zodiacal parallel to each\nother; or, in other words, one planet in twenty degrees of Pifces cafl:s\nits antifcian, or one parallel, to .cen degrees of Aries, and its contra-anti-\nfcian, or another parallel, to ten degrees of LibrJ, But, in taking thtife,\nparticular attention mufl: be had to each of the planets latitude, for want\nof which, great errors have been frequently made. For, fuppofe the\nMoon to be pouted in twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five 'degrees\nof north latitude, her antifcian, or zodiacal parallel, taken in the com-\nmon way, would fall in eight degrees of Leo, and her contra-antifcian\nin eight degrees of Aquaries \u00b7; whereas the true antifcian falls in ten\ndegrees of Cancer, which is no lefs than twenty-eight degrees from that\nNo. 20. 5 E obtained\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAN ILI.;USTRATION\nobtained in the common way, for there is exactly 'that difference be-\ntween the eclipticallongitude of twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with-\nout latitude, and twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees of\nnorth latitude.\nA planet thus confidered, as having latitude, hath four zodiacal paral-\nlels ; one at its body, one at its antifcional point, and the other two at\ntheir oppolite points. And hence, ac_cording to the example above\nfratcd, the Moon's parallels at her body fall in twenty degrees of Ge-\nmini, and at the antiici-onal point in ten degrees of Can<.:er; and their\noppofite points or contra- antifcians,_ f..dl in twenty degrees of Sagitta-\nrious, and in ten degrees of Capricorn. Thefe antifCians, and contra-\nantilcians, are always of a benign and friendly nature, when formed by\nthe benefic planets; but they are equally unbenign and unfortunate, when\nmade by violent and malevolent ftars. \u00b7\nAs zodiacal parallels are only equal difiances from the tropical and\neq uinoB:ial circles, fo mundane parallels, by a parity of reafon, are no-\nthing more than a like equal diftance from the horizontal or meridional\npoints or circles. For example, a planet on the cufp of the twelfth\nhoufe is in parallel to the cufp of the fecond houfe, becaufe it is exaCtly\nat the fame diftance from the afcendant or horizon that the twelfth is ;\nand likewife in parallel to the eighth houfe, as being exaCtly the fame\ndiftance from the tenth houfe or meridian that the twelfth i&. And, as\nthe zodiacal parallels are meafured by the circle of the zodiac, fo the\nmundane parallels are meafured by the diurnal or nocturnal arches; for\njuilio long as the Sun or any other planet will be in proceeding from\nthe cufp of the twelfth houfe to the cufp of the tenth, jufi: fo long the\n\u00a3une Sun or other planet will be in proceeding, on the fame day, from\nthe cufp of the tenth to the cufp of the eighth houfe; and juft fo many\nhours and minutes of time as there are between the fun-riling and noon,\njufi fo many hours and minutes are there, the fame day, between noon and\n_ fun-fetting; hence the diftance between the Sun's riling and fetting is nc-\nthing but the diurnal arch, which the meridian, or Sun's place at noon,\ncuts into two equal parts; and the diftance between the Sun's fetting and\n\u00b7 rifing confi:itutes the nocturnal arch. Thefe mundane parallels have a\ntwo-fold conlideration in directions; firft fimple, and according to natural\norder ; and fecondly, according to the rapt motion of the earth, or pricnum\nmobile, both ofwhich muft be attended to in the calculation of nativities.\nNow there arc ftgns. di1fociatc and feparate; and thefe are fuch as\nhave no familiarity by any of the. ways before mentioned; for they nei-\nther\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R\u00b7 0 L 0 G Y.\n. ther command nor obey, nor mutually behold each other, nor are of\n\u00b7equal power; but they are configurated by one or five figns, and do not\nat an partake of the afpects, either by oppofition, trine, quartile, or\nff'xti)e. Hence they are termed injuCI; for, being confisurated by one\nfign's dill:ance, they are as it wae diftorted from each other; and thofe\nwhich behold by five figns divide the wh >le circle of the zodiac into\numqual parts. The figns under this defcription, arc Ari .~s, G~mini,\nLibra, and Sagittarius, which have no familiarity or afpects with Taurus\nor Scorpio; and the figns, Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and Pifces, have\nno familiarity with Leo or Aquaries. \u00b7\nBut the planets have familiarity .with all' parts of the zodiac by\nHoufes, Trigons, Exaltations, and Terms~ Cancer and Leo; approaching\n\u00b7 nearer to our vertical point than either of the others, and thereby pro- \u00b7\nducing heat and warmth, are for that reafon defined to be the houfes of\nthe two great and primary lumin.lries : Leo is attributed to the Sun as\nmafculine, and Cancer to the Moon as feminine. Hence the femi-\ncircle of the zodiac from Leo to Capricorn is termed folar, and from\nAquaries to Cancer lunar, in order that each planet lhould polfds one\nfign for its houfe in each of its femicircles; the one bearing configuration\nto the Sun, and the other to the Moon, according to the motion of the\nfphere of each, and to their natural qualities. Saturn, therefore, beino-\nin nature cold, and inimical to h~::~t, occupying the higheft orb, and\nbei.ng at the greateft diftance fmm the luminaries, takes for his houfes\nthe figns which are oppotite to Cancer and Leo. namely, Aquaries and\nCapricorn, becaufe thefe figos are by nature cold and wintery, and the\nafpec1s which are made by oppofition do not co..'llbine to any good 0 r\nbenevolent purpofe. Jupiter, becaufe his orb is next below that of\nSaturn, a1fumes for his houfes the two next figns, Sagittarius and Pi(ces\nwhich are windy and fruitful, by reaJon of their trigonal refpeH to th~\nluminaries, which is a fituation proper for the production of good.'\nMars, being next in order to Jupiter, and dry by nature, takes for his\nhoufes the two next figns, Aries and Scorpio, which are 6milar in their\neffeCts to Mars, by having malefic and mifchievous radiations with the\nluminaries. Venus, being temperate, has for her houfes the two next ,\n1igns, Taurus and Libra, which are of a fruitful and prolific nature\nand correfpond with the luminaries by a fextile ray, and is never mor;\nthan two fign~ ditlant from the Sun. ~erc~ry, being circumtcribed by\nthe orbs_. of aU the other planets, takes for h1s houfes Gemini and Virgo .\nand !s r.\u2022.\u2022er more than one fign diftant from the central Sun, being th;\nfi;ft planet next him.\nTho\nDigitized by Coogle\n,\n\f~o6 \u00b7 A N I L L U S T l\\ A T t 0 N\n. .\nThe familiarities by triplicity are next to.be confidered by calculator\u2022\nof nativities J for ~hereas a triplicity and figure of equal fides ob,ains\nan agreement, fo the circle of the zodiac is circumfcribed by three\ncircles, the equinottial and the two tropics, and is divided into four\nequilateral triangles, which confi:itute thefe triplicities. The firfi: is\nformed by the three mafculine figns, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius J and\nit has for its lords, the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars; but Mars being of-a\ncontrary nature to the folar influence, he is excluded froin bearing any\ngovernment in this triplicity, and therefore the Sun has the rule by\nday, and Jupiter by night. Aries occupies the equino&ial circle, Leo\nthe efiival, and Sagittarius the winter. This trigon is principally\nnorthern, by reafon of the dominion of Jupiter; and it is windy and\nfruitful. It is alfo north-weft, and receives a mixture of the north-weft\nwinds, becaufe it is the houfe of Mars, which planet fiirs up and governs\nthofe winds.\nThe fecond triplicity, which confi\u00a3h of Taurus, Virgo, and Capri-\ncorn, is under the government of the Moon and Venus. The Moon\n-governs by night, and Venus by day. Taurus is in the efi:ival circle,\nVirgo in the equinoCtial, and Capricorn in the winter. This triplicity,\nbecaufe of the dominion of Venus, is fouth; for this fiar, being endued\nwith a warming and moifiening power, produces fouth winds; and be-\ncaufe Saturn has his houfe in Capricorn, in . this triplicity, it likewife\n\u00b7partakes of a mixture of the eaft winds ; for Saturn, being familiar to the\noriental parts, by reafon of the condition of the Sun, produces and go-\nverns the eaft winds.\nThe third triplicity is formed of the figns Gemini, Libra, and Aqua..\nries, three mafculine figns, and is placed under the government of\nSaturn and Mercury; Saturn rules by day, and ~ercury by night;\nGemini is fituate in the fummer circle, Libra in the equiilotlial, and\nAquaries in the winter. This triplicity is chiefly eaftern, on ac..\ncount of the government of Saturn; but it becomes partly north-eaft,\nby the influence of Jupiter, on which account it affumes a mixture of the\nnorth-eaft winds.\nThe fourth triplicity, confifting of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces, is\n_\nchiefly under Mars, who derives an influence here, on account of\nhaving his houfe in Scorpio ; bat, becaufe the figns in this triplicity are\nfeminine, the Moon by night, and Venus by day, rule jointly wirh\nMars, and intermix their qualities and influence together. Cancer is\nfituate in the cftival circle, Scorpio in the winter, and Pifces in the\n3 cquinoetial.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nThis triplicity is weftern, becaufe of the dominion of Mars and the\u00b7\nMoon ; but, aff'uming a mixture by the rule of Venus, it becomes in\nfome meafure fouth-wefr.\n':fhe familiarities by exaltation are thus occafioned ; the Sun, when\nhe enters Aries, makes his tranfit into the high and northern femicircle;\nbut, when he enters Libra, he paff'es into the low and fouthern fcmicir-\ncle. For this reafon, the Sun has his exaltation in Aries, in which the\ndays begin to lengthen, and the heating nature of the Sun begins to in-\ncreafe; and for the contrary reafon he receives his fall in Libra. Saturn,\nbeing of an oppofite nature to the Sun, has an exaltation in Libra, and\nhis fall in Aries; fo'r, wherefoever heat is increafed, cold is diminilhed ;\nand, where there is an augmentation of cold, heat is leff'ened. So the\nMoon, becaufe lhe makes her conjuntlion with the Sun in Aries, and\nmakes the beginning of the increafe of her light in the firft fign of her\ntriplicity, _which is Taurus, that is affigned for her exaltation. So 1u-\npiter, the producer of northern and fruitful winds, when in Cancer, be-\ncomes more northerly, and acquires a greater increafe of power; he\ntherefore takes Cancer for his exaltation, and Capricorn for his fall. And\n.fince Mars is chiefly of a burning nature, and becomes moft heatin~ in\nCapricorn, becaufe he is then in his moft fouthern declination, he hath\nhis exaltation in Capricorn, oppofite to that of 1upiter, and his fall in\nCancer. Again, Venus is naturally moiftening, but mofily fo when in\nPifces ; for which reafon ilie atfumes her exaltation in that\u00b7 fign, and\ntakes her fall in Virgo. But Mercury being of an oppofite nature, and\nmoftly dry, takes the oppofite fign Virgo for his exaltation ; for then\nautumn, the drieft part of the feafon, appears; and h~ has his fall in the\nfign Pifces.\nFamiliarities by terms have been already largely ex'plained in the\nformer part of this work. But it is neceff'.1ry to remark, that the be-\nginning of the figns, and of the terms alfo, ought to be made from the\nbeginning of the equinotlial and tropical figns; and this is manifefr, be-\ncaufe we fee t:heir natures, and powers, and familiarities, have not any\nother caufe, \u00b7but from the tropics and equinoxes ; for, if other begin-\nnings are ~ppointed, we iliall either be neceffitated to ufe the nature of\nthe figns no longer in the theory of judgments, or, if we do admit them,\nwe fhall commit error by corrupting the diftances, and dividing thofe -\nfrom which influences are afforded them.\nBetides thefe familiarities of the tl:ars and figns, they alfo poff'efs what\nare called their faces, thrones, and the like.

They\nare alfo faid to be in their thrones, when they have a power in the place\nthey po1fefs, according to the foregoing prerogatives, by two or more\ntefiimonies; for then their energy and influences are increafed, becaufe\nthe familiarity of the ambient twelve figns co-operates therewith.

This\nobfervation likewi(e holds good in direaions; for, the nearer any pla-\nnet is to the ecliptic line, the greater will his influence be. Moreover,\ntheir effeas are either ftrong or weak, in refpect of the horizon ; for,\n\u00b7when they are pofited in the mid-heaven, or pafs into the place fucce-\ndent to the mid-heaven, they are very {hong and powerful ; the fame\nalfo if they are.in the horizon itfelf, or in any of the fuccedent houfes,\nand more particularly when in oriental parts. But, when they are in the\nimum cceli, or otherwife pofited under the earth, their influence is very\nweak, and of but little effect. \u00b7\n1 From\nDigitized by GoogIe\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nFrom all the foregoing confiderations, it is evident that the efficient\npower of the ftars is deduced from their peculiar and natural afpeCls.\nor proportional diftances, confidered in refped: of the Sui1, the angles,\nand the quality of the ambient figns; and by the power and influence of\nthefc afpeCls are all aftrological fpeculations governed. But how thefc\nafpects were firft difcovered, and their virtues and proportions afcertained,\ndoes no where app~ar; though it might be no difficult taik to account ~\nfor both upon philofophical and mathematical principles, fincc nature\nevery where, as well in the motions and effects of the heavenly bodies,\nas in all other arithmetical and geometrical refpeCls, particularly cele-\nbrates thofe proportions above all others.o Picus, fpeaking of the afped:s,\nthinks mankind were led to the knowledge of them by obferving the\ndifferent phafes of the Moon ; for, when the is new, horned, in her\nquarters, gibboffity, or at full, her forms arc frill changed at thefc\nproportioned diftances from the Sun ; betides which, it is to be obferved,\nthat in her annual revolutions the is conftantly found about the trine of\nher own place in the beginning of the former year.\nOther aftronomers, of eftablilhed reputation, have likewifc obferved,\nthat nature particularly points to every configuration, while w~ confider\nthe motions of the other planets. Abohazer judiciou.fly affirms, that\nthe two inferior planets, in their ftations, defcribc the arch proper to a\nquartile afpea ; and Pliny alfo recommends to our obfervation the trine\nafpett, conftantly formed by the ftations of three fuperior planets.\nBut, above all, it cannot be confidered without great admiration, how\nwonderfully nature hath nobilitated all the afpeds in the motions of\nSaturn and Jupiter. For, as their conjunctions are rare, and bappen but\nonce in twenty years, fo hath nature evermore difpofed thefe\u00b7 conjunc-\ntions in the moft remarkable parts of the zodiac, that is, in fuch figns\nonly as behold each other in an equilateral triangle infcrib~d. For, be-\ntween any two great conjunCtions of Saturn and Jupiter, there are nine-\nteen Egyptian years, three hundred and eighteen d:iys, and thirteen\nhours, in which fpace of time thofe planets are moved from the place\nof their former conjunCtions eight figns and almofi: three degrees; which\nexcefs of three degrees is the caufe why, after ten conjunctions, they pafs\nfrom one triplicity to another, and one triplicity continues one hundred\nninety-eight equal years, two hundred fixty-five days, (the intercalary\nday ofevery fourth year omitted,) and ten hours. But the revolution of\nall the triplicities is finilhed only once in feven hundred ninety-four\u00b7\nequal years, three hundred thirty-one days, and fixteen hours; or other-\nwife in feven hundred ninety-four Julian years, one hundred thirty-\nthree days, and fixteen hours ; which, being doubled, amounts to \u00b7one\nthoufand\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f410 A. N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N\nthoufand five hundred and eighty-eight, which number of years \u00b7 thofe\nauthors are thought to have refpeCted who confiaere~ the year 1588\nfrom the birth of Chrift would prove fo fatal.\nFrom hence therefore it is, and not without fufficient caufe, that\n-they are termed great conjunCtions, both happening rarely, and abiding\nin one triplicity almoft two hundred years together, and not compleat-\ning all the triplicities of t~e zodiac in much lefs than eight hundred\nyears: confequently they have not yet gone through all the triplicities\neight times fince the beginning of the world. Neither are the other\nafpeBs formed by thefe planets to pafs unnoticed ; for whoever obferves\nwhen Saturn and Jupiter behold each other by an oppofition or quartile\nafpect, they will evidently perceive that they fiill carry fuch a regard\nto the figns or plac~s of their preceding and next conjunctions, as ever-\nmore to irradiate the one and the other with an oppofition, fextile,\nquartile, or trine afpect; which I think is a fufficient proof that nature\nhath allured us to the confideration of the archs formed by thefe afpects\nin the particular motion of each refpective planet.\nTo confirm the virtues and efFects of thefe afpects, we need only con-\n, fider what phyficians are taught by experience, namely, that the crifis\n.-\"' of all acute difeafes has a .palpable and extraordinary fympathy with\n~ all thefe five configurations of the Moon, made to her place at the be-\nginning of the difeafe. Or, as a further proof, we need only refer to\nwhat has already been faid relative to the tides, which conftantly\nobfefve the motions of the Moon~ their fpring and higheft floods al-\nways concurring with their conjunction and oppofition to the Sun, as\nthe neaps and lowell: tides always do to her quarters. And it is\nequally remarkable that the feas, in their daily ebbing and flowing upon\nevery co.1ft, have refpect only to fuch azimuthal circles, as are in a\nquartile pofition when the Moon patfes by them. Again, the Sun \u00b7moil:\nevidently manifefts great effects by the quartile afpect, fmce he modi-\nfies and governs \\he viciffitudes of feafons, or four quarters of the\nyear, by his ingrefs into the four equinoCtial and tropical points of\nthe zodiac.\nThe power of thefc afpects is not injudicioufly fiated by Julius\nFirmicus, in the arithmetical obfervation which he makes of the num-\nber offigns agreeable to the afpects, 1, 2, a, 4t 6, anfwering in pro-\ngreflive order to the conjunction, fextile, quartile, trine, and oppofi-\ntion ; for thefe numbers only, and no others, will divide the zodiac,\nconfifting of twelve figns.; for which reafon he makes th~m the only .\naliquot\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 411\naliquot parts of a circle. Ptolomy alfo added hot a little to the dignity\nof thefc irradiations, when he firft difcovered the geometri.c,,J proper-,\ntion which the fubtenfcs of each of thefe archs bear in retpel1 to the\ndiameter of a circle. Others again, with no lefs ingenuity, \u00b7 have .ob-\nferved, that, .amongll: all regular or ordinate figures that may be inicrjbed\nin a cir~le, though tht:.fame be infinite, there are none whofe fides and\nangles carry away the prerogative at the circumference and centre, hut\nthote whofe fides and angles are anfwerable to the fubtenfes and archs\nof their afpeCts. For, amongft all ordinate planes that may be infcribed,.\nthere are no two whofe fides joined together have pre-eminence to oc..\ncupy a femicircle, but the hexagon, quadrate, and equilateral triangle,\nanfwering to the. fextile., quartile, and trine irradiated. \u00b7 The fubtenfe\ntherefote of a fextile .a(ped confifts of two fig.ns, and, joined to the fub-\ntenfe of a trine, CQmpokd of four, being regular aod equilateral, take\nup fix .figns, which is a complete femicircle. In like manner, the\nfides of a quadrate infc.ribed, fubtending three figos, and, twice reckoned,\nalfo occupy the moiety .of a circle;. And what the foregoing figures are\n- faid .to perform., either doubled or joined together, may alfo be found\nin the afpeCt of oppofition..; for the .diametrical Jine which patfes from\nthe place of conjunCtion to the oppotite poin.t, divides a circle into two\nequal parts, a ~ircumftance which cannot be found in any other infcripts.\nFor example, the fide of a .regular pentagon fubtends feventy-two de-\ngrees; of an octagon .but forty-five; the remainders of which archs, viz.\none hundred and eight, and one hundred and thirty-five, degrees, are not\nfubtended by the (ides of any ordinate figure.\nAnd thus, as the fubtenfes of thefe .afpel1s are the ferne with the fides\nof the foregoing infcripts, and . only take up the circumference of a\ncircle; fo it is evident, that the angles at which they concur are the\nfame wherewith the ordinate planes take up the whole fpace about the\ncentre. For, if we confider the angle of a fexti'le afpeet at the earth, it\nis all the fame with that of an equilateral triangle confifting of fixty\ndegrees, and contains two-thirds of a rig~t angle; but fix times two\nthirds of a right angle make four right angles; wherefore fix fextiles,\nequal to fix equilat~ral triangles, fill the whole fpace about a point,\nwhich is equal to four ,right .angles. Secondly, every angle 'Of a\nquartile is a right angle, and the fame with the angle of a rettangle\nquadrilater figure, four of which fill a whole !pace. Thirdly, the angle\nwhich two ftars in a trine make at the centre of the earth, is meafured\nby an angle of one hundred. and twenty degrees, which is equal to the\nangle of a regular hexagon, confifting of a right angle and one-third;\nand, tckcn three. times, makes four right angles; whereof three equila-\nNo. 21. 5 G teral\nDigitized by Coogle\nI\n\fAN ILLUSTRATION\nteral hexagons, or three trine afped\u2022, alfo fill the whole fpace about the\ncentre. To thefe we may likewife add the afped: of oppofition; which\nconfifl s of two right angles, and therefore being doubled will perform\nthe like operatiOn with the refi; whilft any other figure of many angles,\n_however joined together, will either fall fhort _\nof four right angles, or\nelfe exceed them. For infiance, the angle of a pentagon contains a right\nangle and one fifth over, wherefore three fnch angles placed about a point\nwill fall fhort of four right angles by two fifths of a right angle; whilft\non the other hand fout fuch angles will exceed four right angles by\nfour-fifths. \u00b7\nThefe fpecu1ations-rlrerefore duly confidered, it were fenfelefs to ima.\ngine that nature hath fo many ways diftinguiilied thefe remarkable .irra-\ndiations of the ftars in vain, or admonithed us to a particular regard of\nthem, by fo many rare and fecret operations, as welt in the motion of\nthe planets, as in their eff~as and pmportibns, if they were not endued\nwith more force and virtue than any of the others. Hence it has. given\nfcope to the ingenuity and abilities of the learned to affign a caufe, why\nthefe fc:w configurations, above all the others, iliould be endued with\nfuch extraordinary efficacy. Nor has any reafon yet been given, with\nmore apparent probability, than that thefe proportions. whereof the\nafpeBs are-found to confift, are precifely the fame with thofe which are\nfound in harmonicaI concords; for which reafon it is fuppofed no lefs\nprobable, that the rays of the ftars in thefe proportioned diftances, lhould\npowerfully affect the matter of aU fublunary things, by the fame rule\nthat the like geometrical fymmetry in founds and voices iliould ftir up\nthe fenfe and paffions of the hearer. And it is an efi:ablifhed obfervation\nthroughout the produdions of nature, that, where due proportion is\nnot wanting, there the never fails to endue all her effects wilh fuch an\nheight of perfeCtion, as cannot but firike the fenfe and underftanding of\nevery obferver. And thus it is even in artificial compofitions, and in\nmedicines ; for we know thefe only to be mofi: kind and fovereign,\nwhich obferve a competent fymmetry or temperature of the active and\npaffive qualities. With great propriety, therefore, and with every ap-\npearance of truth, moft of the learned agree with Ptolomy, that the caufe\nof this wonderful efficacy in the foregoing afpeas. proceeds in a great\nmeafure from harmonica! proportion.\nBut more clearly to demonftrate this fimilitude or affinity between\nthe proportions of the afpeHs, and the like diftances obfetved in mufical\nconcords, we muft underftand that all harmony whatfoever originally\n\u00b7fprings from three fuch terms gf numbers as refpeEt each other in fuch a\nmanner,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R o\u00b7 L o\u2022G Y.\n\" manner, that their differences invariably retain the fame proportion as \u00b7\nis found between their extremes.. F\u2022r inftance, in thefe three numbers,\n6, 4, 3\u2022 anfwering to the figns of the oj>pofition, trine, and quartile\nconfigurations, it is evident, if we compare the extremes with the mean,\nthat 2 will be the difference between 6 the fidl, and 4 the fecond,\nnumber; and 1 is in like manner between 4' the middle or fecond,\nand 3 the third, number; but 2 being\u00b7double in proportion to 1, there..-\u00b7\nfore 6, the firft number, refpeCts 3\u2022 the third number, with the like\nproportion. The analogy\u00b7 of which proportions, as before ftated, is\nfound to be the bafis of all mufic,. arHing wholly from thefe three\nflmple concording 'diftances, which by muficians are termed diape.nte\u2022\nconlifting of a fefquialter proportion, as 6 to 4 ; or, which is all the\nfame, of three or two; diatdfaron, compounded of a fefquitertia, as 4\nto 3; and diapa.fon, confifting of a double proportion, as 6 to 3\u2022 or 2 to\nI ; and is equal to the two \u00b7firft diftances and proportions put together.-\u00b7\nFor a fefquialter added to a fefquitertia, according to the rules of pro-\nportion, will prod~ce a diapafon, or double proportion, exactly fuch as\nis found between the former extremes cempared together, viz\u2022 .as 6 to\n3\u00b7 In like manner, by comparing the diapafon with beth thefc: parts,\nthat is, with the fefq~ialter and fefquitertia, according to the cuftomary\nmanner of fupputating proportions, we are brought\u00b7to the two other\ncompounded or imperfect concords, fo conftituting the five firft' and na-\ntural diftances i~ barmonical founds, that, being diverfiy and judicioufiy\nvaried between themfelves, produce an infinite variety of all kinds of\nmelody.\nAfter the fame manner we 'find it with regard to the light and in-\nfluence of the heavens. For, although there are other afpe!:ts attributed\nto the ftars, both zodiacal and mundane, yet thefe five were anciently, and\nare even now. obferved as being moft apt to attion, and moll: powerful in\ntheir effects, namely, the conjunCtion, oppofition, trihe, quartile, and\nfextile; and there is nothing more certain, than that by the harmonica}\nmixture of thefe proportioned beams, the generation and corruption of\nthis mortal world is infinitely varied and governed. Wherefore, as the\nforce of all harmony, fo likewife the effectual reafon of aU aCtion in the\ninfluence of the ftars, is properly deduced from the aforefaid fymmetry\nof thefe diftances. But, more fully to illuftrate that the angl& of th~\u00b7\nafpech, compared between themfelves, concur with thefe harmonic pro.;.\nportions in mufic, let it be remembered, that ftars in an oppofite or dia-\nmetrical afpeH are disjoined by the fpace of two right angles, which\nare meafured with the arch of fix figns, or one hundred and eighty de \u2022\n~:rees of circumference; and that the trine, confilling of four tigns, or\u00b7.\nOJlC~\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\\-\n1\nit_~\nK\n'-l\n-\n:t\"<\n~~+ AN ILLU\u00b7ST,ltATION\nCll~ hundred and tWenty degrees, confl:ituteS one right angfe and One\nthird of another; alfo, that the quartile afpect takes up one entire right\n.u~ gle, and is fubtended with the arch of three figns, or ninety degrees ;\na~;d likewifc that a fcxtile is confiituted but of two figns, or fixty de.\u2022\n;,rces, which is two thirds -of a right angle. , This being admitted, if\n~e no\\v compare the two right angles of the opp.ofition, ta~en toge-\nther with the angles \u00b7of the reO: of the af~ects, and e1tber the.tnne placed\nbetween the oppofition and the quarule, or the quartile between\nthe oppofition and the fextile, we fuall find . either way three num-\nbers which admit all the laws of harmonic propor~ion, as becomes evi.\ndent by the following figures \u2022.\n8\n180\nA\n120\n0 8\nJ80 *\n6o\n~ The firft figure fufficieotly~~xplains itfelf; but in t.Jle fecond, Jet the\n. oppofition be compared with'the fextile, aod it will be found to have a\n~ triple proportion to the fame, compounded of a double and fefquialter\n\u00b7 \" proportion, as diapente is with diapafon in mufic; and hence it is found;\n-4 J - no fimple or perfeCt afpect, but exaCtly anfwerable to B flat,- the tirft\n' T imperfect or compounded concord in mufic, being a fixth from G .fol re\nut; which is neverthelefs \u00b7in fome refpeels efteemed perfea, becaufe it\nbears the fame divifion, compared to D.folre, as the perfect concords do;\nfor it is half a fifth, dpd\u2022fituate in the centre between r ut and D .foln.\nAgain, th.e fextile aipea compared with the trine, is juft one half there-\nof, whi,c:h has1\nbeen already proved to be in a fefquialter proportion to\nthe oppofi'tion, as D .fol re is tor ut, \u00b7and therefore exaaJy correfponds\nwith th~ diapente io mufic, which I here take occafion to mention\n~ '-\u00b7'\n\u2022 The firft figure proves the three concords to have three perfeCt: afpecb; and the fecond\n{hews the fextile to be an imperfeCt afpeCt, agreeable to diapentf'um diapnfon, that is, a triple pro--\nportion, as 6o is to So.\nagain\noigitiLd by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nagain, becau(c I may hereafter allude to it lVhen I come to fpeak of the\nnew afpects. What I have lllready faid will fuffice to fuew the p~ilo..\n{ophical (peculation of thofe who have afcribed the efficacy of the pl.t-\nnetary irradiations to the harmonica! proportions which are found b~tween\nthem; and, fince it is obvious that thefe afpects do really bear the fame\nmutua) refpect one towards another as all h~rmonical concords ~refound\nto retain among themfclvcs, what reafon can be affigned, why nature'\u2022 \u2022\noperations in the lights and influences of the heavenly bodies fuould not\nbe governed by this_fymmetry of proportion, in the fame maQner as we\n\u00a3.nd to be univerfally admitted_in the fcienc.e of mufic ?.\nBut all this rather ferves to illul\\:rate a fimile, and to prove that nature \u00b7\nhas indeed\u00b7 diftinguiilied thefe proportions with extraordinary virtues.\nabove any other, than to fatisfy the miQd w!;y, in the infinite variety of\nfounds and lights, thefe proportions only fuould cortefpond fo fweetly\nin mufic, and be moft effectual in the'operations of nature. Kepler,\nwith a fuew of plaufibility, has endeavoured to demonftrate, that God, in\nthe creation of the world, obferved the fame propPrtion in the magni-\ntude and dtftance of the celeftial fphcres that is found in the regular\nfolids which in geometry have thqr origin from the ordinate planes ;\nand therefore concludes, that the fll.Otions of the lleavenly bodies cor.-\nrefpond mot\\: fweetly, \u00b7and co-opcra~e moft powerfully together, wh~a.\nthe nature of fublunary thi~gs, cn4u\u00a2d, as he fuppofes,. with a fenfitive\nfaculty, ~pprehends and r~ceives ~he beams Qf the ftars by their con-\ncunence at the centre of t~ cart~ ; wl)ich anfwers to the ordinate\nplanes, from whence the regularity of thefe proportions is derived. as\nthe impreffed characters of that admirable fymmetry which God is faid\nto have obferved in the creation of the world. And hence he fuppofes,\nthat, as often as any earthly fubftance meets with thefe proportions, it is\naffected as it were by this idea, and exercifed in fuch a manner, that\nwha.t it but ordinarily performs at other times it will now produce\nwith much mo,re effect. Not that thefe proportions work any thing of\nthemfelves; for, in Qlufic, it is neither the founds, nor the proportion\nof the concords, .that work any thing of themfelves,. or beget any de-\nlight in the he~rer; but the foul, approaching to' the organs of fenfe.\nthere firft entertains th~ founds inwardly, then regards th~ir proportions,\nand, finding the fame good and geometrical, )aftly exhilarates itfelf, and\nmoves the body wherein it is as with an object wherein it takes delight.\nSuch alfo is the fympathy between the heavenly influences and all fublu\u00b7\n,nary matter, animate, or inanhnate. \u00b7 \u00b7\nNo. 21\u00b7 sH\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f.(t6 A N I L L U S T R A ,T I 0 N\nBut, be this conceit of Kepler's as it may, we are not without {pffi-\n.cient geometrical demonftration, to thew the reafon why thefe propor.\ntions or irradiations of the ftars are more effeBual than any others. For.\nfince it is admitted that an union of beams affords the greateft influence,\n{o it is allowed that the conjunction and oppofition are, for this reafon, \u00b7\nthe moft potent and powerful configurations of all ot~rs, as is lhewn\nby the following figure, where we fiDd the beams, as well incident as re-\nfl.ected, to be united.\nP.or, Jet A be fuppofed in conjunction with B, it is lirft manifeft that\nall the beams flowing from G and E, .the points of touch in the circum-\nference of A, fhall unite themfelves with the beams that are fent from\nB to C, the earth's c.entre. Secondly, we are alfo to obferve, that in\nthis cafe the beams A C, or B C, coming from the centre of the llars\u2022.\nrefteCl only into itfelf, as being perpendicular ; whereas thofe beams\u00b7\nwhich are fent from the points E and G make an acute angle at C, and\nretlect the one into the other at equal angles ; as G C reflect from C to.\nE, and E C from C to G. LaftJy, the union that' happens in an oppofi-\ntion is manifeft without any illuftration, where the beams fent from the\u00b7\nopp.ofite ~oints make but one ftrair. line, as G F, and E H, in the\nforegoing figure. .\nIn\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G 't. 41\u00b71\nIn 1ike manner, in my contemplation, the configurations of the (ex-\ntile and trine have a concurrence of their beams at the earth, .and a mu:.\ntual reflection of the one into the other, and fo an union by refleCtion, .aa\nill the following figure is manifeft. \u00b7\nA\nFor, admit ABC to be three ftars, A and B in a fextile configuration,\nand A C in a trine; then, for fo much as B F, the beam incident of the\nfextile~ falls obliquely in refpect of A F, and makes an acute angle there-\nwith, it is evident, to any one who has the fmalJeft underftanding in\noptics, that B F fuall reflect to C, and fo be united to C F, -the inci-\ndent of the ftar C, which is in a trine configuration with A. For the\nfame reafon, C F fuaJl reflect to the ftar in B, and be alfo united with B\nF, \u00b7the incident of the ilar at B. And hence arife the grounds of th.1t\nfamiliarity in thefe arcbs of heaven, which Ptolomy has laid down as the\nmoft apt for the apheta of life; or the houfes of the figure.\n-\nBut the quartile afpec.t, whofe beams only cut each other ad angulos\nreSos, and fo reflect into themfelves, derives its principal virtue from\nthe exact proportion of its angles in taking up the centre of the earth ;\nand hence the myftery of thefe configurations wholly conlifts in this, that\nthefe irradiations only, and thofe that are derived from them,. are pro..\nportionable unto all patible matter, and therefore moft effectual. For\nthat thefe irradiations only are every way proportionable, has been al-\nready abundantly proved, whether we refpect their taking up the circum-\nference, the power, and proportion, of their fubtenfes, unto the diameter,\nor, laftly and principally, their occnpying of place at the centre of the \u00b7\nearth by their angles, whereby they muft need& thine upon an\u00b7etement 1ry\nmat:er\n.:6F\u00b7\n\f.-f18 \u00b7A\u00b7 \u00b7N l L L U S T It A T I 0 N\nmatter with a due and even mixture of light and influence. And, nneo\nno other archs, fubtenfes, or angles, are found to enjoy thefe preroga..\ntives, it is evident that thcfe, above all others, have that fymmctry of\nproportion\u00b7which is neither defective, interrupted, nor redundant ; bu,t\nfuch are the archs, fubtenfes, and angles, ofthefeirradiations, that thefe,\nand no other, are exactly proportionable. Now as that which is defeCtive,\nand wants equality of proportion, leaves the action fruftrate and with-\nout effect ; fo that, which on the other band offends in excefs, muft needs\nincnr the contrary fault, and overcharge that which either nature or art\nintended to perform; whereby it wiJl necefi'arily follow, that, wherever\nthere is no defect, nor excefs\u00b7, but an equal and juft mixture of the in-\nfluence of the ftars in tbefe irradiations, thcfe onJy can be apt and pro..\nper to produce perfect and agreeable effects in the formation and tempe-\nrature of all {ublunary things. For it happens in thefe effects which arc\nproduced by the mixture of light and heat, juft the fame as in chemi-\ncal operations, where a defect of heat produces nothing ; while, on the\ncontrary, excefs will deftroy the whole, either by fublimation, vitrifica..\ntion, eruption, or the like. \u00b7\nHaving thus fatisfactorily fuewn how the points of the ordinate planes.\nwhereunto thefe cqnfigurations have been compared, often reiterated, do\ntake up pJace, I D:iall now fet forth how the beams of any two ftars in\nany one of the former configurations fhall occupy more (pace than that\nwhich is comprehended between theirincidents or beams oftrue motion;\nand how by their beams, either incident, reflected, or oppofite, they\noccupy and pofi'efs the whole centre of the earth at one inftant with pro-\nportionable angles. To demonftrate this, in refpect to the conjunction\nand oppofition. whofe force rather depends upon union than proportion,\nI need only refer the reader to a view of the laft diagram but one, where\nhe wiJJ find that the united beams of fucb ftars as are in conjunction and\noppofition furround the centre, and all elementary matter whatfoever,\nfubject to the actions of heaven. With regard to the quartile, whofc\nbeams incident and oppofite traverfe the centre of the earth at four right\nangles, viz. at A F G, G F I, A F H, and H F ~; and feeing four\npoints of a rectangle quadrilater figure hath been already proved to occu.\npy place; I likewife,nced no other proof, io this configuration, than that the\nreader will in the ]aft figure obferve how thefe four right angles, made\nby one quartile afpect, take up the,centre of the earth. But, concerning\nthe trine and fcxtile afpects, we have yet more to confider; for, fuppofe\ntwo fiars, A and B, in the laft diagram, irradiate the earth with their\nfexti1e beams; although it be true, _that, by protracting the oppofite\nbeam from B to F, the centre of the earth feems occupied with propor-\n3 tionablc\n'\u00b7\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\ntionable angles, B F A being fubtend.!d by the ark of fixty degrees,\nwhich is before declared to be the angle of an ordinate equilateral trian-\ngle, arid fo leaves the outward angle B F I equal to the angle. of an ordi-\nnate hexagon, fubtended here by the ark of one hundred and twenty de-\ngrees, which is the ark of a trine ; and the like being alfo found in the\nangles made by the oppofite beams ad verticem ; yet, neverthelefs, we\nrnuft here confider how the incident beam of B, viz.

In like manner, if we fuppofe C to be in\na triangular configuration with A, it is evident that as the oppofite beam\nof A, viz. F I, makes a fextile with the incident beam of a ll:ar at C, viz.\nC F; fo C F, being the beam incident of the ftar at C, refletls a) fo to\nthe point B, and fo makes the fame three fextile afpech wherewith .the\naforefaid whole femicircle is occupied, as above demonll:rated. Thefe\nconfiderations wi11 undoubtedly fatisfy the reader how any two ll:ars, in\neither of the afpech above alluded to, proportionably occupy the whole\ncentre of the earth in the fame moment of time, without reiterating th~.\nfame angle.\nI have hitherto only fpoken of what are termed the old configurations,\nwhich are indifputably the moft excellent; but I !hall now mention\nwhat are called the new ones, as introduced by the ingenious Kepler,\nnamely, the quintile confifting of feventy-two degrees ; the biquintile,\nof one hundred and. forty-four degrees ; and the flfquiquadrate, of one\nhundred and thirty-five degrees ; which afpects, being added to the for-\nmer, make eight configurations, anfwering to the eight confonant fiopa\nin a monochord. Thefe new additions are by no means improperly made,\nfince many eminent praCtitioners of this fcience have experienced their uti-\nlity in fpeculations on the weather and meteors ; as weJl as in bringing\nup the acciden~s of a nativity. Neither is there any want of philofophi-\ncal or mathematical demonfi:rations to fupport them; for as in mufic\nthere are but three perfect concords, nan~ ely, the diapafon, diapeote,\nand diateffaron ; fo in aftrology there are but three perfect afpeets anfwera-\nble to them, viz. the oppofition, the trine, and the quartile; the fextile\nhaving already been proved an imperfeCt afpect, anfwering exactly to B\nfiat, the firft among the imperfect and compounded concords. Where-\nfore, confidering that the firfi: three perfect concords are found to have\ntheir perfect afpects anfwerable unto them, and that B flat, being an im-\nperfe~t concord, is alfo found to agree exactly in proportion with the\nfextile, being an imper-fect afpect, this undoubtedly gave Kepler fuffici-.\nent reafon to conceive that the other harmonica} proportions contained in\nthe fame monochord. might alfo have their afpects, namely, the quin-\nNo. .21. 5 I \u00b7 tile,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f..20 AN .ILLUSTRAT ..ION\ntile, biquintile, and fefquiquadrate, which are precife1y found t() cor-\nrefpond with them, and are in a fimilar degree effectual in their mode of\noperation.\nThus having explained what the afpects or configurations of the pla-\nnets really are, and proved that their power and influences are grounded\nupon philofophical and mathematical principles, I fhall now proceed to\nfhew their applications in the iffues of human life, fr-om the conception\nto the grave.\nIt is, I believe, univerfally admitted, that the beginning of human\ngeneration takes place at the time of conception ; and therefore we ought\nto be exact in afcertaining this time, and in confrdering the effective\npower of the configurations of the fiars, as they then happen to be pofited,\nand from thence contemplate the qualities of the mind and 'body. For\nin the beginning, although the feed at once affumes a quality by the\ncommunication of the circumambient matter, which at other times of\nits formation and increafe becomes different ; yet naturally, as it in-\ncreafes, it retains its own proper matter, and is rendered more like the\npeculiar nature of the firft quality, with which it was impreifc::d at the\ntime of conception. But, if it be of fome impcrtnnce to know the time\nof conception, it is infinitely more fo to know the true time of birth ;\nfor by the firft, the accidents only before birth are known; but by the\nfecond, thofe incident to our whole lives are to be difcovered. Where-\nfore one may be called a beginning, and the other 11n after-beginning;\nthe firft, the generation of human feed; the fecond, that of man. For\nin this ftate the infant aifumes many things which it had not when in the\nwomb, and thefe peculiar to human nature alone, and the formation of\nthe body. And although the properties of the celefiial and elemen-\ntary matter feems to confer nothing at the time of birth in refpect to the.\nformation ofthe child, yet it operates moft forcibly upon it in other re-\nfpects ; for nature, after perfecting_the formation, difpofes the enfuiag\neffect according to the ftate pf the former at the beginning. Hence it\nis reafonable, in thofe whoie time of conception is unknown, that the\nconfigurations of the fiars formed at their birth, fhould ~e fignificative ;\nnot that it wholly contains an effective power, but becaufe it neceffarily\nhath a power by nature fimilar to the effective. But i't is always bell:, if\nthe time of conception can be had, to compare it with the time of birth;\nfor the time 6f conception fhews what \u00a3hall happen t~ the infant while in\n\u00b7the \\'I'Omb; as whetherit \u00a3hall be firong or weak, firm or infirm, perfect or\nimperfect, male~r female, fingle or twins ; or whether it fhall arrive to\nthe full and perfect time of birth. But the occurrencesoflifeafterbirth\n\u00b7are to be coniidered from the pofi tion of the heavens at the birth only.\n2 Now\nDigitized by G ogIe\n\fOF \u00b7ASTROLOGY,.\u00b7\nNow, fince nothing can be prediaed in aftrology without this funda-\nmental guide, namely, the radix, or lrue time of birth, Vi:\\rious me-\nthods \u00b7bave been invented, in 'di1feretrt ages, for the purpofe -ef af~rtain\u00ad\ning this point with precifion, after the eftimate or fuppofed time is\ngiven.

If Saturn and Veri us.be ori~\nentally pofited, or angular, they forelhew happinefs according to the par-\nticular circumilance~ of each parent. If the luminaries are void ofcourft,\nand in no good afpect with the fortunate ftars, a low condition, or an\nignoble life, is prenoted: but, if the luminaries are varioufiy configu-\nrated with good and evil .ftars, a mediocrity and in'equality in the fortunes\nof the parents is. thereby demonftrated; as when . Mars afcends to the\nSun, or Saturn to the Moon, and the benefics in different conditions.\nAgain, if the part of fortune in the nativity is found in a good pofition,\nwith the ftars configurated with the Sun and Moon, the. affairs of the\nparents will be profperous; but, if it be difcordant, and fituated in a bad\nplace of the figure, with mal~fic ftars, their concerns will turn out inju-\nrious and unprofitabl~. \u00b7\nThe length and thortne'fs of life mull: be confidered from other confi-\nguratioos.

But if\nthefe pofitions are found weak, with Mars dignified above the Suo, and\nSaturn in quartile or oppofition, the father. will be taken off in the early\npart of his life.

Thus from the nativity of\na child may the principJl concerns of the father and mother be fought\nout, and alcertained; and fuch is the fympathy exilling by this bond of\nnature and confanguinity, that little difference will be found, if com-\npared with the proper nativity of each parent\u2022.\n\u00b7 But, to give judgment in fuch cafes with corre8nefs, {epar~te fchemes\nmuft be eretted for the father and mother, by the following rule. In\u00b7\nthe figure ereHed for the f:.ther, if the nativity be diurnal,, note the\ndegree in which the Sun is pofited in the child's nativity, and make that ,\nthe degree afcending upon the horotcope for the father; and conforma-\nble to that order the cufps of all the other houfes, by the rules hereto-\u2022\nfore laid down. If the figure be erected for the mother, then take the\ndegree of Venus, inllead of the Sun, and proceed in all other refpeets\nthe fame. But, if the nativity be nocturnal, take the degree of Saturn \u00b7for\nthe filther, and that of the Moon for the mother. And in all thefe cafes\nit muft be obferved, that the nativity .of the firft-born is to be pre-\u00b7\nferrc:d, then that of the feconc!, and fo on. And that whatever is pre-\nnoted in relation to the parents from thefe figures, is only futh as lhall\nhappen to them after the birth of the child, and not to any thing before.\nThe time in which any or each of ' thefe events will happen, is to be\nfought out by \u00b7the archs of direHion, or difiances of that llar which hath\nthe dominion in refpeCt of .the Sun and the angles of ,the world; and\nthis I thall make perfeCtly eafy to the meaneft underfianding, when I\ncome to treat of directions in general.\nNow the next confideration in the native's geniture is the place of\nbrethren, and this ~s taken from the fign on the mid-heaven, and the\nmaternal place, which is the pofition of Venus by day, and ~he_ Moon by\nnighr; for, as this can only relate to children born .of the fame mother,\nthis flgn, ar.d that. which fucceeds it, being maternal, naturally confii-\ntutes the place of brethren.

For it happens through the mixtures ,\nwhich are occafioned when thefe potfefs bicorporal figns, or when the\nToling planets are fituated in them, and many prolific ftars call their rays\nco the fame, that it will be a plural conception. The number then\ngenerated is known from the ftar which induces the propriety of the\n\u00b7number; but the fex is determined by the ftars configurated with the\nSunh, Mhoo\n1n, ~nd ~orofco.Pe\u00b7 h For.dwhe find fcon~ obfc:rvation, thdat; whhen ft.\nbot t e ummanes are m t e mt - eaven, twms are procreate ; w en\nSaturn, Jupiter, and Mars,. have configuration with the affigned places\nin bicorporal figns, three males are generated; but three females, when\nVenus, Luna, and Mercury, are confifurated in the fame manner. Saturn,\nJupiter, and Venus, \u00b7thns difpofed, produce two males and one female; but\nVenus, Luna, and Mars, two fe~ales and one male. Thefe configu..\nrations but rarely happening at the time of conception, render it a kind\ncf phenomenon whenever they occur; and hence we generally find the\nbirths that follow in confequence are ranked amongft the wonders of\nthe day in the public prints, though the caufe has a radical foundation\nin nature. And hence too it is, that, as thefe configurations are more or\n\u00b7Jefs imperfeCl:ly made, fo will be the quality of the conception, either\n\u00b7bringing all into life uniform and perfect at the birth, or elfe bringing\n\u00b7one with good conformation, and another with puny, imperfect, or mon-\n.ftrous, members.\nThere are alfo certain configurations of the ftars, which abfolutely pro..\nduce moles or monfters in every conception that takes place under\nthem. Thus it happens when the luminaries decline from angles, and\nfall cadent, without any kind of afpea to the afcendant, and when the\ncardinal houfes are \u00b7occupied by the malefic planets. But, to defcribe\nthe fpecies of unnatural birth, it is necelfary, in thefe configurations, to\nobferve the place of the )aft full Moon preceding the time of conception,\ntogether with the ruler thereof, and the lord of \u00b7 the luminaries ; fur, if\nthe places of thefe fignificators have no familiarity with the place of the\n-{aid preceding full Moon, what is then generated will be of unnatural\nconformation. If the luminaries are at the fame time pofited in four..\nfooted figns, and the two malefic planets in angular houfes, what is\nthen conceived will not be \u00b7in human thape; but, if Jupiter or Venus in-\nterpofe their benevolent rays, and give teftimony to the luminaries, then\n\\vhat is conceived will be of human conformation, but of a fierce and\nfavage nature. If Mercury correfponds with the luminaries, the dif..\npofition will \u00b7be agreeable to \u00b7nature, hut the forr:i1 of the body will be\nNo. 22. 5 M unnatural;\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f43\u00b7\u2022 A N I L L U S T It A T I 0 N\nunnatural; or, if the luminaries be in human figns, and the ruling planet\n-difcordant, then the offspring will be of proper conformatioon, but mon-\nftrous in quality. I( one of the maldic ftars give teftimony in any of\nthe foregoing pofitions, what is then generated will be irrational, or of\nungovernable qualities; but, if Jupiter or Venus give teftimony, the\n()ffspring will naturally poffefs the mental accomplilhments, with an her-\nD1aphroditical conformation. If Mercury alone gives teftimony to the\naforefaid pofitions of the luminaries, that which is procreated will be\ndeaf, and perhaps dumb, though intelleaually well qualified, and in-\ngenious. Thefe.Jpeculations are doubtlefs abftrufe, becaufe fuch con-\nfigurations feldom happen, and the refult of them is very little known;\nbut, to confirm their effect, I have only to recommend to thofe who\nhave their doubts, to be guided by obfervation, and to decide by there-\nfult; for, the more we enquire into the pathlefs ways of nature, the more\nreadily we deduce a radical caufe for all her produaions.\nBut here I muft not omit to remark, that the time of conception, and\nthat only, is to be referred to for the conformation or accidents of the\nchild in the womb; and the time of birth for what \u00a3hall happen after;\nnotwithfianding there is always fuch a concurring. agreement between\nthe conception and birth, that whatever is produced by the former is\nin a great meafure to be difcovered from the latter, though not wholly\ncorreCt, or to be relied upon as infallible. Thofe therefore, who are\nborn in their natural lhape, and afterward become crippled and lame,\neven to a monftrofity, yet, fince not brought into the world with the na-\ntive, they fall under the defcription of blemilhes, or .bodily infirmities,\nrather than the refult of monftrous and unnatural conformations.\nDiftinet from this fpecies of conception, is that which, though per-\nfeCtly natural and well conformed, yet is void of ftamina, and hence -\ntermed an embryo not nourijhed. This kind of conception happens when\none of the luminaries, in an angular pofition, is joined with a malefi~\nftar, and that luminary giver of life. So likewife, if the parallel of\nlongitude between the malefic planet and the luminary be partile, or\naccording to a figure of equal fides, and none of the fortunes correfpond-\ning, and at the fame time the lord of the luminaries be pofited in a dif-\ncordant place, what is then generated cannot be nourilhed, but decays\nin the womb, or expires foon after the birth. Or, if they are not equi-\nlaterally configurated, but the two malefic planets nearly irradiate the\n\u00b7places of the luminaries, a.ffiiding both, or only one of them, no matter.\nwhether the malefics be fuccedent or oppofite, fo one or both of them be\nin partile configuration with the lqminaries; .for whatever is born under\n3 f~ch\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R. 0 L 0 G Y.\n(uch \u00b7iniluenc~s will be of no duration, \u00b7fince the greatncfs of the power\nof the malefics will deftroy wh~t lhould necelfarily conduce to the nou--\nrilhment of life.\nIt is particularly to be ob{erved, that Mars afllias the Sun by fue-\nceffions,.and Saturn the. Moon ; but by oppofitions the contrary hap-\npens; for in thefe the Sun is aflliaed by Sat urn, and the Moon by. Mars;\nand this aflliaion is the more eminent when the malefic fiars are fignifi-\ncators, and by that means become fu perior both to the luminaries and\nthe horofcope. From thefe obfer:vations, fubordinate effects have been\nafcertained; for, when there are two oppofitions of the tnalefic fiars, and\nthe luminaries fituated in angles, whatever follows that conception will\nbe ftill-born. But ifat this time the luminaries are feparating from the\nbenefic planets, or are in any other afpect with them, cafting their\nbeams at that time in a converfe direaion, the fretus will obtain anima-\ntion, and be found alive and perfect at the birth; but will live only fo\nmany months, days, or hours, as there are degrees, minutes, or feconds,\nof the folar motion, between the beams of the Apheta and the neareft\nmalefic planet. But i( the malefics caft their beams to the parts preced-\ning the luminaries, and the benefics to the degrees following, what is\nborn will futfl!r great afflictions, and firuggle much with infirmities, but\u00b7\nlhall recover and live.\nAnd hence the confideration that naturally follows regards the dura~\ntion or fpace of life, which, taking in the whole compafs of human pur-\nfuits, and the duration and viciffitudes of them, doubtlefs becomes the\nmofi interefiing part of the doctrine of the fiars. The mode of afcer-\ntaining this important point, .namely, the fpacc or duration of the na-\ntive's life, is de!fined from a comparifon of the aphetic, hylegiacal, or\nprorogatory, places, with the killing oranaretical places in thegenethliacal\nfigure, at the time of birth. The aphetic place is the fituation of the\nApheta, Hyleg, Prorogator, Significator, or giver of life, for they have\nall the fame meaning; and, the anaretic place is the fituation of the\nAnareta, or killing planet ; and, whenever thefe !hall meet together, or\nbe conjoined in a bodily afpect, the native will find a termination of life;\nconfequently the length of time, in which the Apheta and AnaretJ,\nas pofited in each refpective figure of a nativity, will be in forming a\nconjunction, or coming together in the fame point of the heavens, is the\nprecife length of the native's life; and this period is afcertained hy what\nwe term arches of direction, equated by the folar motion, and reduced\nto common time.

The parts of the body are formed\nbefore the foul ; and, becaufe it is infinitely more grofs, hath a connate\n.and almotl apparent endowment of temper. _ But the foul, not being\ncommunicated to the body till the entire conformation thereof be wholly\nperfetl:ed, ma.nifefts by degrees an aptitude proceeding from the firfi:\n.cauf\" but much later than thofe of the external accidents ; and -\ntherefore\nit requires fome length of time be~ore the nature and progrefs of this\nmental aptitude can be known. As to the form and temperature; of the\nbody, that is generally defcribed from the oriental horizon, and from\nfuch of the planets as bear rule in it, or have, the dominion thereof;\n'-\ntogether with their particular and refpective configurations with the\nMoon ; for according to the quality of thefe two places, and the nature of\nthe ruling ftars, the formative virt~e, and the temperament in each fpe..\ncies, with reference to the declination of the afcending fixed ftars, is the\nparticular formation of bodies defined.\nTo what has been already faid, concernin\u00b7g the effects of each planet\nrefpectively, in giving fhape to fuch infants over whofe nativities they\nprefide, we muft likewife add the peculiar force and operative faculty of\ntheluminaries, with which they may then happen to be configurated.-\nIf the Sun co-operates, it contributes much towards the production of a\nmore comely and majefiic perfonage, and of a mild and good habit ;\u2022 and\nthe Moon, when the withholds her defluxion, caufes a more propor-\ntionate, .O.ender, and moift, temperament; but varioufly, according to the\nnature and qualities of her feveral quarters. Again, if the luminaries\ncorrefpond with oriental rays, they add to comelinefs and fiature; or, if\nftationary, they make the native firong and robuft. But, when they\noccidentally concur, difproportionate formatio!ls and evil temperaments\nare commonly the refult. \u00b7\nIn this fpeculation, the different effects of the four quadrants are\nlikewife to be confidered i that from the vernal equinox to the fummer\ntropic\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f. 0 ,!1 A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 4lS\ntrop1c gives the native an excellent complexion, comely, of a good\nfi'ature, abounding with heat and moiflure. But the quadrant from the\n{ummer tropic to the autumnal equinox gives but an indifferent com..\nplexion, though the body is well proportioned, healthy, and vigorous,\nabounding with heat and drinefs. That from the autumnal equinox to\nthe wineer tropic gives a fanguine complexion, with a flender, lean,\nand fickly, habit, abounding with drinefs and cold. The quadrant from\nthe winter folflice to the fpring equinox gives a dark complexion, witn\na moderate flature, fquare and !hong, abounding with cold and moif-\nture. .This is to be underfiood in reference to the figns afcending, and\nin which the Moon and other fignificators refpetlively bear rule. But\nit is more particularly to be obfervc:d, that the figns which are of hu-\nman form, both in the zodiac and without it, make bodies of a moll:\nexcellent fymmetry and proportionJ while thofe which are not of hu..\nman form aCl contrariwife, deranging the proper rules of proportion,\nand influencing from the properties efi\"ential to an elegant fuape to that\nof difproportion and deformity.\nOf the radical Caufe of B L E M I S H E s- and B 0 D I L Y\nDISEASES.\nFrom a fimilar hypothefis to the above, we derive the obfervation of\nexternal blemHhes and bodily difeafes, with all the common accidents\nofthe human frame, to which the native is expofed during the courfe of\nhis life. The mofl approved mode of afcertaining and diftinguilhing \u00b7\nthefe is by regarding the eaftern and weftern angles of the horizon, but\nparticularly the weflern, and the part preceding, which is the fixth\nhoufe, for that is inconjunCl with the oriental angle. Thefe angles\nbeing properly taken, we fuould next obferve the malefic ftars, and how\nthey are configurated; for, if both or either of them are pofited upon tho\nafcending parts of the faid angles, either bodily or by quartile or oppo-\nfition, there will be external blemilhes, or bodily infirmities, infe-\nparable from the perfon then born. Or, if both the luminaries, or only\none of them, be angular, as above defcribed, either in coojunCtion or\noppofition, with a malefic ftar afcending, they will produce fuch infir-\nmities or blemilhes as the particular places of the horizon and figns then\nafcending, and as the nature of the malefic and ill-affected ftars, lhall\nrefpeElively manifeft; for in this cafe, as in all fimilar ones, the degree's\nof the ligna which arc upon the affiicted part of the horizon will thew\nthe particular part of the body wherein the infirmity is, whether it be a\nblemilh or difeafe, or both; and the nature of thofc ftars will likewifc\npoin't out the caufc and quality of the fymptom. \u00b7\nNo. u. 5 N BlcmHhea\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\u00b7\u00b73~ A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N\n\u00b7Biernilhes and bodily hurts for \u00b7the moft .part ba'p\u00b7pcn when the m~\"'\n\u00a3cs are oriental; but difeafes wheri occidental.

The fame\nmisfortune happens when Saturn or Mars~ being oriental, af~e.nd .to the\nMoon, pofited in an angle; but, \u00b7whenever they are thus configurated to\nboth the luminaries; either in o\nthe fame \u00b7fign or in the oppofite, and\norientally pofited in refpectof the Sun, but occidental in retpea: of the\nMoon, they caufe blindnefs in both the ey~. Mars ufually denotes\n. blindnefs by the effeets of a blow or thruft, and by lightning, burning,\n&c. but, if configurated with Venus,\u00b7it generally proceeds from an ac-\ncident in play or e.xercile, or from -the; (udden attack -of a1faffins or def-\nperadoes.\n. Saturn produces blindnefs by catarath -and colds, or by pin and web.\nand by fuch like accidents; but,\u00b7ifVenus be pofued in any of the above-\nmentioned angles, particululy in the weft,. configurated or joined with\n\u00b7 Saturn, and Mars at the fame time elevated, or in oppofition, the males\nthen born will be incapable of propagaticsg their fpecies, and the females\neither wholly barren, or fubjeet to abortion, or to the bringing forth of\nftill-born children, or to fuch as adhere to the womb, and are obliged to\nbe feparated by manual operation, or brou.ght away in pieces. This rnoft\ncommonly happens in the figns Cancer, Virgo, and Capricorn. But if\nthe Moon be at the fame time in the afcendant, configurated with Mer-\ncury or Saturn, and applying to Mats, what are then born will partici-\npate in the natore of both fexes, and perhaps be void of a ,natural paf..\nfage. lt is Jikewife found, that, if the Sun be config~ratcd 'with Mer-\ncury, and both the luminaries difpofed after a mafculine manner, the\nMoon decreafing, and the malefic ftars afcendi~g in the following de-\ngrees, the males will be deprived of the members proper for generation.\nor be irreparably blemi1hed or infufficient in them, particularly in the\nfig\u00b7ns Aries, Leo, Storpio, Capricorn, and Aquaries; and the females will\nhe\u00b7naturally barren all their lives.\n3 Impedimenta\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fO- F AS T R 0 L 0 0 Y. 437\nimpediments or blemHhes in the fpeech are found to ariCe from \u00b7the\nconfigurations of Saturn and Mercury with the Sun, in the aforefaid\nangles; particularly when Mercury is pofited in the weft, and beholds\nthe Moon either by an oppofition or quartile afpeet. And, if thefe con~\nfigurations happen to be made in mute fign~, as in Cancer, Scorpio, or \u00b7\nPifces, the impediment will prove confiderably greater. Again, if the\nmalefic ftars are pofited in angles, and the luminaries afcend to them\neither hy conjunHion or oppofition; or if the malefics afcend to the\nluminaries, and the Moon be in her nC!Jde in hurtful figns, as Aries,\nTaurus, Cancer, Scorpio, or Capricorn, the defeCts of the body will be\nby lamenefs, gibbofity, diftortion, or luxation. .If the malefic ftars are\nin conjunRion with the luminaries, thefc a-Kettions will .take plaee from\nthe birth ; but, if they are fituated in the mid-heaven, elevated above the\nluminaries, or in oppofition to them, they will ari1e from the c,oncur...\nrenee of various accidents, fuch as falls, blows, wounds, and the like,\nduring their progrefs through life.\nBlemilbes happen for the moft part when the Moon is in tropical or\nequinoRial figns. In the vernal figns they are .chiefly occafioned by\nmorphew; in the fummer, by tetters; in the autumn, by the fcurvy;\nand, in the winter, by biles and other morbid eruptions. But difeafes\nmofily happen,wlien the malefic fiars are configurated in the aforefaid\nangles, but contrarily as to the luminaries, viz. occidental to the Sun,\nand oriental to the Moon. In thefe pofitions Sa~a induces to unufual\ncoldnefs in the belly and reins, and fubjecb the native to phlegmatic\nhumours, bloody fluxes, jaundice, and the whole train of hyfterical\naffeCtions. Mars occafions melancholy, difeafes \u00b7of the lungs, fiftulas,\nLot ulcers, and putrefactions. If Mercury co-operates with either of\nthefe ungracious planets, it is for the increafe of evil, addiag frelh vio-\nlence to the diforder, and perhaps fooner inducing a fatal determination.\nBut the properties of fomc bodily difeafes arife from.the variety of\nfigns.which po1fefs the foregoing.configurations upon the two ,angles.-\nFor infiance, Cancer, Capricorn. and Pifces, caufe difeafes from putre-\nfafrion, tetters, {curvy, or k.1.ng's.evil ; but Sagittarius and Gemini by\nfalls, epilepfies, falling ficltnefs, and the like. If the planets are in the\nlatter degrees:e>fthefe6gns, they produce bodily difeafesand blemilhes in.\ntheextremitics, .by-reafon of lux:ations or injuries, from whence arife\nclephantiafis, gouts, cramps, and rheumatic complaints. And here it\nmufi: be carefully noted, \u00b7that, if none of the benevolent planets are con..\nfigurated with the.ma.lcfics which:po1fefs lh~ caufe of theie yarious difor-\n. den,\nDigitized ~y GoogIe\n\f438 A N I L L U S T It A T I 0 N\nders, nor to either of the luminaries in angular pofttions, then the(s\nbodily difeafes will be wholly incurable, and the blemilh~s never to be\nremoved ; but, if the benefics potfefs a confiderable lhare in the configu...\nrations which induce the caufe, or overcome the malefic rays by an equal\nor fuperior power, then the difeafes will be much more moderate, and\nthe blemilhes not fo obvious, ifmore than barely difcernible. It muft\nhere, as in all other cafes of the like kind, be .obferved, that the flronger\nany ruling planet is, whether benefic or ma.leftc, the more eminent and\npowerful its etfeas will be; and alfo that a planet is ftronger when ori-\nental than when occidental ; wherefore a malefic planet orientally pofited\ngives blemi!hes J but an occidental, dffeafes. It is likewiie to be re-\nmarked, that, if the pofition of the planet inducing the caufe be very\n~hong, the defed: will be from the birth; but, if weak, it will arifc\nfrom fome accidc;nt after birth.\n. .\nOf the natural BENT and Q.U ALITY of the MIND.\nSuch is the doarine of bodily accidents, as deducible from the face of\na genethliacal figure; but the qualities of the mind, as rational and\n-mental, are judged of from the confi:itution of Mcrcary with regard to\ndifferent iigns and planets. That which appertains to the fenfe alone,\n,or that renders it irrational, is conftdered from the more corpOt\"eal fi:ate\n.of the luminaries; that is, of the Moon and ftars configurated by fepa-\nr~tion or application. But,. fince the aaimal inclination is various, this.\n{peculation is contemplated from many and divers obfervations, accord-\ning to the diverfity of figns -which contain Mercury and the Moon, or\nthe ruling fi:ars which have dominion in them, and that confer their in-\nfluences to the temper and quality of the mind; together with the con-\nfigurations of thofe fiars which have refped: to the Sun and the angles\nconfidered as to the .proper and difiina nature with which each of\n1hem ad: upon the mental motions of each individual. It is there-\nfore generally tound that tropical figns render the native's mind highly\ningenious, full of invention, eager in the purfuit of moral and political\nknowledge, and of great fortitude and perfeverance. Double-bodied\nligns agitate \u00b7the mind with a variety of whimfical and very ufelefs pur-\nfuits, _\nlead the tongue to loquacious habits, and induce to negligence and\nfolly. Fixed figns fortify the mind with prudence and virtue, and give\na bias to ceconomy, chaftity, and temperance. Again, oriental confi-\ngurations produce mental qualities of a ftrong and ingenious nature', free,\nopen, and undiffembled, quick of apprehenfion, conA:ant, judicious,\nbenevolent, and chafte s but the occidental ones act upqn the mind\nin\nDigitizedbyGO gle\n\f\u00b7. o J1 \u00b7 A\u00b7s-T\u00b7;.R. :0 ..~ Q:G Yt\u00b7I ~. c1J.9\n\u00b7jn I Yeiyl)ppdite manner, \u00b7indining .,~iare.to ~jaQ4 . intem\u2022\n.poruce, ,aftd impliriag.the:intell~ by a:n~tUTplly vici~Aiwo~t;p~. .\nli.is likowife a\u00b7 juft abfc~v-'i~n\u00b7,\u00b7that if.t~ tia~s ~~i~~.~~~ 4~tPipiop\nue poftted in good placet of ~c figure, &Sld ~U \u00b7~OD~r~, t~)' .r~*\n\u00b7tho mcnt$tlendewmonu.exquafitcly, perfeCt, and af.lP~e W. ~ gcqeral ~\nfortune. ~his \u00b7it\u00b7\u00b7moll: reillarkablf \u00b7d>vious. in ..tllqfp Jf,Dit.ure\u2022 wllicJt\nhave Metc~ry welt conngufl.atcd, and joined wi\u2022\u2022 Jhe feP.~r\u2022ti;q~ qr IJl.-\n.plication of the Moe\u00bbn.\u00b7 \u00b7Bqt, if.

For,\nwhen the is found in the oriental quadrants at the time birth* fhe\ninfluences the native to the confummation of marriage at an e<lrly period\nof his life J but, if pofited in the occidental quadrants, he will probably\nlive fingle till the approach of old age, and then marry a very young\nwoman. If the Moon be afHitled by 'the Sun-beams, and in configura-\ntion with Saturn, in either of thefe pofitions the native will n::ver marry\nat all. If lhe be found in a fign of one form, and making applicJtion to\none planet only, the native will marry but once; but, if pofited in a hi-\ncorporal or fign of many forms, and making application to feveral ftars\nin the fame fign, he will be feveral times married. And, if the ftars\nwhich receive the Moon's application, either by a conjun:iion, fexti-le, or\ntrine, are benefic, the wives will be good and virtuous; but, if the ap-\nplication be made to malefic planets, and by evil configurations, they\nwill be altogether of an oppofite defcription. Therefore, if Saturn re-\nceives the Moon's application, it indicates a laborious, but fullen, fro-\nward, and ungovernable, wife. If it be made to Jupiter, \u00a3he will be free,\nopeo, and generous, truly virtuous, and a good houfewife. If to Mars,..\nfuc\n~ -\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f454- A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N \u00b7\nfile will be bold, ftubborn, and refrntlory. If to Venus, chearful,\ncomplacent, affable, and chafle-. If to Mercury, wife, prudent, loving,\nand confhnt.. But, if Mars irradiates the place, ~will be furly, ~:.\nflonate, talkative, and unfi:eady.\nFor t~e particulars of marriage in refpeCl: of women, we are to confider\nthe pofitions of the Sun, inftead of the Moon ; for, if he be fituated in\nthe oriental houfes, at the time of birth, the native will either marry very\nyoung, or elfe ~t an advanced time of life to a young mao ; but, if the\nSun be found in the occidental houfes, \u00a3he will marry late, or to a .man\nfar advanced in years. And alfo, if he be fituated in a fign of one form,\n~e will marry but once; but, if in a tign of many forms, or configurated\nto many oriental ftars, ihe will have more hulhands than one, who will\npartake of !he fame natur~ and qualities as the ftars to which the confi..\ngurations are made. Thus, Saturn, if configurated to ,the Sun, will\nindicate fober, grave, and laborious~ hufbands, but cold and phlegmatic.\njupiter difpofcs them to more opennefs of mind, and generofity. Mara\nmakes them violent, warm, unruly, pa.Gionate, and arbitrary. Venus\nforeLhews them to be indulgent, fond, good-natured, and haodfome.\nMercury difpofes them to be careful, .prudent, induftrious, and faithful.\nBut, if Saturn be joined with Mercury, they will be churlilh and rc-\nferved; if with Venus, they will be dull, four, and inconfi:ant: if with\nMars, quick, lively, luftful, and fond of variety. Thofc are here to be\nconfidered the oriental quarters in refpelt of the Sun, which precede the\noriental and \u00b7occidental fign of the zodiac ; and, in refpetl of the Moon,\nthofe from her new and full to her other quarters ; and the occidental\nhoufes arc thofe which fall oppofite to the foregoing.\nAs to events .that occur after marriage, that is a different (peculation,\nand requires great attention to the following particulars. Wnenever the'\ngeniture of both \u00b7huiliand and wife have the luminaries configurated in\nmutual .agreement, that is, in trine or fextile to each other, they will\nlive together in comfort and harmony, and for a long continuance of\ntime, if the luminaries happen to be in mutual reception. And this du-\nration will ftill be more firm and lafi:ing, if the potition of the hulband\u2022s\nMoon agrees with that of the Sun in the wife's geniture. But, if tho\npofitions of the luminaries are placed in figns inconjunH, and configu-\nrated by quartile or oppolitioo, they will either live together in difcord\nand enmity, and be rent by violent jealoufiea and contention, or elfe be\nfully and finally eftranged from each other.\n\u2022\nAgain,\noigHized.by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 4SS\nAgain, if the benefic ray\u2022 of the fortunate planets behold the configu-\nrations of the luminaries in mutual reception, the marriage will be\ndurable, conftant, happy, and profitable; but, if the 'malefic planets\nirradiate tbofe places, the marriage will be unhappy, contentious, and\n\u00b7 miferable. If the luminaries \u00b7are not configurated in mu.tual reception,\nyet if the benefics give tcftimony to them, the marriage will be mode-\nrat-ely happy and durable; and, when ftrife and difagreements happen,\nthe fame will wear ofF, and reconciliation will take place between them ;\nbut, if the malefics give tetl:imony to the difcordant pofitions of the lu-\nminaries, inconftancy and infidelity will en!ue, and the marriage will\nbe dHfolved with fcandal and difgrace. If Mercury be joined with the\nmalefics, the feparation will be for hatred and diflike, and by mutual\nconfent; but, if Venus gives teftimony to them, it will bo a divorce, by\ndue courfe of law, for infidelity and adultery.\nMarriages, in other refpecb, are confidered from the familiarities \u00b7and\nconnexions of Venus, Mars, and Saturn. For, if thefe are all three\nconfigurated with the luminaries~ the marriage will be good, domeftic,\nand profitable; by reafon of the affinity which the benefic planet Vent~s\nhath with Mars and Saturn J with Mars, becaufe of youth and florid coun-\ntenance, feeing they have .exaltation in mutual trigonal figns, as Mars in\nCapricorn the triplicity of Venus, and Venus in Pifces the triplicity\nof Mars ; or Mars in Pifces the exaltation of Venus, -and Venus in\nCapricorn the exaltation of Mars. So likewife Capricorn and Libra are\ncommon to Saturn and Venus; for Venus in Libra hath houfe, and Sa-\nturn triplicity; and in Capricorn Saturn hath houfe\u00b7, and Venus tripli-\ncity; and hence file bears relation to Saturn by an older complexion,\nfeeing they have their boufes trigonal to each other. Wherefore Venus\nwith Mars conduces to make the inclinations more fond and amorous;\nand Mercury, giving te{Hmony to them, qualifies the paffions, and keeps\nthe fenfual appetite within rational bounds. If Venus be found in any\nof the above familiar and promifcuous figns~ the indicates marriages be-\ntween kinfmen and-relations ; or, if the be witp the Moon in a mafcu-\nline geniture, it prediCts that two fifters, or near relations, will be mar\u00b7\n.ried to the fame man; but, if 1be be thus configurated to Jupiter, or the\nSun, in a feminine geniture, it fuews the woman will marry two bro-\nthers,. or two men that are .nearly related.\nIt is likewife obfervable, that, in aU cafes where Venus is thus cori.\nfigurated to Saturn, in the place of marriage, the connubial ftate\nwill be blifsful and happy to the native ; and, if Mercury be joined\nwith them, he adds profperity i but, if Mars be f~bftituted in his place,\nNo. 23. \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 5 S the\nDigitized by Coogle\nI'\n\f456 A N I L L U S T R .A T I 0 N\nthe marriage will be altogether wretched, contentious, and unhappy.\nIf Mars be configurated to Venus, Saturn, and Mercury, the\u00b7native\nmarries with a perfon nearly of an equal age; but, \u00b7if he be pofited in an\noriental or eaftc:rly ftation, the native marries with a perfon .much youn-\nger; and, if in an occidental or wefterly ftation, with a perfon much older.\nIf VemlS and Saturn be found in promifcuous figns, fuch as Capricorn\nor Libra, the native will marry among his own kindred ; ~ut, if this\n\u00b7 configuration is made upon the cufps of the horofcope or mid-heaven, -\nirradiated by the Moon, and the geniture be mafculine, the native will\nluft after his own fifter, aunt, or mother-in-law; or, if the geniture be\nfeminine, the will have defire unto her own brother, uncle. or daugh-\nter's hufband. Should the Sun irradiate the place, inftead of the Moon,\nthen the males will have defire toward their daughters, or.{on's wife;\nand the females to their fons, nephews, or fifter's hu\u00a3band.\nObfervation likewife proves, \u00b7that, if Venus and Saturn are confign--\nrated neither in a mafculine nor feminine fign, but in thofe of an oppo-\n1ite quality, which are alike in fex, but contrary in nature; or in thofe\nthat are ruled by places \u00b7of a contrary nature, as Capricorn is ruled by\nSaturn.a~d Mars, and Pifces by Jupiter and Venus; the native will be\nprone to .luft, of a loofe converfation, and immodeft carriage; more par-\nticularly if the configuration be made in the firft or latter degrees of\nAries, near the Hyades, in the latter degrees of Leo, -or upon the face\nof Capricorn. And, if thefe planets. occupy the two principal angles,\nnamely, the afcendant or mid-heaven, thefe libidinous affetlions will be\nthe more firong, open, and oftenfive, making the party gtory, as it were..\nin lafcivioufnefs and debaucheries; but it is a moft extraordinary cir-\ncumftance, that the fame afpech in the northern and weftern angles not\nonly conduce to an oppofite difpofition, but render the native either\nbarren, deficient, or of evil conformation, in refpeC\\ to the parts necct.\nfary to generation. \u00b7\nThe difpofition o( men, as to modeft or vicious habits, very much de-\n\u00b7pends on the pofition and configuration~ of ~ars ;. for, if he be feparat-\nJng from Saturn and Venus, and applymg to Jupner, men bora at that\ntime will be difcreet and modeft, decent in their iatercoutfes with the\nother fex, and difpofed only to the natural cfe. If Jupiter and Venus be\nconfigurated to Saturn and Mars, the native will be eafily moved on, and\nhave a fecret d.efire to ad:a of venery; but will have an external thew of\nchaftity. and labour to avoid the thame. If Mars and Venns are aloQe\nconfigurated toaother, or if Jupiter bears tcftimony, the native will be\nopenly lafcivious, and indulge in the ofoft luxuriant enjoyments of the\noppolite\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f\u00b7o F A S T R \u00b70 L 0 G Y. 457\noppofite (ex. If one of thefe planets be ori~ntal, and the other occi-\ndental, he will be difpofed towards men as well as ~omen; but, if both\nare found configurated in the occidental quarters, the native's company\n1hould be avoided, for he will burn with unnatural defires after men or\u00b7\nboys; more particularly if the afped falls in mafculine figns, in which\ncafe the inclination is moft aftonHhingly moved towards this infamous\nand 1hocking practice. It is likewife to be remarked, that, if Venus be\nalone in an occidental pofition, the native will for the moft part have\nintercourfe with none but the meaneft and moft proftituted part of the\nfex; but, if Mars be alone in this pofition.t he influences to greater delicacy\nand faftidioufnefs, and marks the charaCter with a de1ire after married WO\u2022\nmen, or to the more continent and modeft among the fingle ones.\nSuch are the caufes which vary the fenfual appetites of men; we will\nnow confider thofc peculiar to womcn.-If Venus be configurated to\nJupiter, and Mercury gives tefiimony, the native will be fober, pure,\nand moderate in her defires after men; but, having familiarity with Mer-\ncury alone, lhe will privately give herfelf up to fenfual embraces, though\nremarkably coy and referved in public. So likewife, if Venus be con-\n.figurated to Mars alone, the native will be wanton and lafcivious ; and, if\nMercury bas familiarity with them, ilie will be wholly given up to luft..\nful plcafures and proftitution. If Jupiter concurs in this afpetl, and\nMars be .combuft of the Sun, the native will be mean and abjea, fub-\nmitting to the ufe of the moil. vulgar and lowcft clafs of mankind; but,.\nif Venus be combuft intl:cad of Mercury, \u00a3be will fubmit with more re-\nferve and caution, and moftly with decent and genteel perfons. If the~\nplanets be configurated after a feminine manner, the fenfual appetite of the\nnative will be only pafiive; but, if.difpofed after a mafculioe manner, it\nwill be a&ive alfo. Saturn, having familiarity with tbefe configurations\u2022.\nadds to the great~r luft and licentioufnefs; but Jupiter to a greater ihare\nof modefty. decency, and external decorum. \u00b7\nOf C H I L D R E N.\nAfter the confideration of marriage follows that of children. This fpe\u00b7\nculation is deduced from the ftars configurated in the midheaven, or\n{uccedent, which is the eleventh houfe; but, if none of the planets are\nfound in thefe places, then the oppofite ones are to be confidered. The\nMoon, Jupiter, and Venus, are rbe given of children; but the Suo,\nMars, and Saturn, occafion ftcrility, or paucity of ~hildren. Mercury,\nas in all other cafes, contributes his influences according to the nature\nand quality of that ftar or planet with which he is configurated; ad~ing\nto the increafe of children when in the eaft, but to fterility and barren-\nnels\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAN ILLUSTRATION\nnefs when occidental, or in the weft. Wh~n therefore thefe ftars which\nare givers of children, are thus pofited, and by themfelves, they fore-\nthew only one child to the native; but, if they are formed in double-bo-\ndied or feminine figns, they caufe the generating of twins : Co likewife, in\nfruitful figns, as Pifces, Cancer, or Scorpio, they will produce two or\nthree children at a birth. If they are of a mafculine nature, by being\nconfigurated to the Sun, and in mufculine figns, they caufe males ; but,\n\u00b7if they are difpofed after a feminine nature, they give females. If they\nare overcome by malefic planets,. and pofited in barren places or figns.\nfuch as Leo or Virgo, they will give children, but not of any ftability\nor duration; they will be naturally weak and puny, by being void of a\nproper thare of vital heat and nourHhment. If the Sun and malefic ftars\njointly poff'efs the midheaven or eleventh houfe, in mafculine or fterilo\ntigns, without either of the benefics concurring, they .indicate perpetual\nbarrennefs to the native, and thew an utter want of children? but, if they\nbe in feminine or fruitful figns, or aided by the benefics, they foreiliew\nthe 'produClion of children, but fuch as are either hurt or blemithed in\ntheir bodies, or of a ihort and unhealthy life.\nIn all thefe cafes it muft be remembered, that whenever the malefic\nfiars have the dominion, and .the benefics give teftimony, being configu-\nrated in, or having refped to, proHfic figns, there will happen a rejeCtion\nof children according to the excefs w.hich the ftars giving teftimony have\n_\nin each condition, either of all the children, or of a few, or moft, as they\nare found more powerful, by being more oriental or angular, or moreele-\nvated or foccedent. If therefore the lords of thofe figns, being givers of\nchildren, are orientally po-fited, or in good places of the figure, the chil\u2022\ndren will be fortunate and afpiring, anc! will arrive at fingular fame and\nhonour.: but, i~ the pofition be occidental, ~r in evil pl~ces of the figure,\nthe cbJldren wtll be altogether mean and obfcure. Moreover, if they\nagree with the part of fortune an4 horofcope, they forethew mutual love\nand confidence, and a good underftanding always to exift between the\nchildren and parents, and that they ~ill become the heirs and inheritors\nof their fortunes; but, if thefe be found unconjoined ~nd difagreeing, the\nchildren will be Yicious and incorrigible, lofing the efteem, and wearing\nout the patience, of their parents, and thereby perhaps miffing the inhe-\nritance of their fubftance. If the ftars which a1fume the dominion of\nchildren are agreeably configurated among themfelves, theyfore1hew love\n, and harmony among brothers and fifters, and that they will help and\naffift one another during their lives. But, as to other particulars rela-\ntive to the fortunes and general purfuit of children, they are to be fought\nout by placing the fign and degree in which the fignificator of children\n1 h\nolgitized by Coogle\n\f. 0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nis Found, upon the a{cendant, and making the figns upon the cu{ps of\nall the other hou{es agreeable thereto, in the fame manner as if it was\nthe proper nativity of each child, and then judge of the difpofition of\n\u00b7 the figure, according to the rules heretofore laid down. .\n. -Qf F R I E N D S and E N E M I E S.\nThe things which relate to friendfuip and enmity are confidered by\nobferving the principal places of the geniture wherein the fignificators\nthereof have familiarity or afpect, together with the weak~efs or ftrength\nof them. The great and more durable familiarities or differences of thefc\nftars arc termed fympathies and enmities; and the fmall and temporary\nfamiliarities are called focieties and contentions. To difcover thefe, we\nmuft carefully obferve the pJaces of the S~n and Moon, in refpea to the\nhorofcope and part of fortune; for, if thefe happen in the fame figns, or\nif they change places when rifing.,and not more than feventecn degrees\ndiftant, they forefue~ long and faithful frie_ndiliip; but, if they arc in..\neonjuna, or pofited in oppofite figns, they produce great and impl.tcabJc\nenmity and hatred\u00b7. If the luminaries are not found in any of thefe fi~\ntuations, but \u00b7are -only eonfigurated in figns, either by trine or fextilc,\n!bey fuew 1lig~t .and precari?us friend\u00a3hip; bu!, if b~ quartile, fmall and\n1mpotent enmtty. Hence 1t ~appens\u00b7 that fncndaups ccafe and appear\nas it were at an utter end, while \u00b7the malcfics tranfit the configuration;\u00b7\nand yet, when thefe are over, the friend\u00a3hip is again renewed, and\nmutual civilities and good\u00b7offices take place, as if no fuch circumftancc\nhad happened. So in like manner the \u00b7malicious objeCts of hatred and\nenmity feem to ceafe\u00b7and lie dormant, when the benefic ftars arc making\ntheir ingrefs upon the configuration; but are renewed with frcih ran..\ncour foon after tbefe ingrefi\"cs are at an end.\n,\nFricnd1hip and enmity are therefore confidcred under th&:ee kinds ; for\nmen are obferved to be fo. difpofcd either by cled:io(l, or for profit, or\nfor forrow or pleafure; and when either all or moft of the forementionC?<{\nplaces have familiarity with each other, friendlhip is confiitut\u00a2d by tbefe\nthree kinds; but, if tbcfe places arc found unagreeable, then enmity arifes\nin a fimilar manner. Wben the places of the luminaries alone have fa-\nmiliarity, \u00b7friendfhip will arife from clcctioo, involuntary choicer, or na..\ntaral regard, which is the moft firm and lalling; but, if the places of the\nluminaries are ~ontrarily difpofed, hatred is .in the fame manner pro.\nduced, and is the moft inveterate and fatal. When the place of part of\nfortane hath familiarity, or is otherwife found, tben thefe aifed:ions\nNo. 23\u2022 1 \u00b7T . atife\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f46o AN _IL .LUSTRATION\narife from motives of ie1f-intereft or gain; but, when they are from the\nhorofcope, they are produced by thofe aClions of the mind which arife\nfrom melancholy and choler, or from vivacity and good humour. But\nin all thefe cafes we mufi particularly obferve the fl:ars elevated above or\nconfigurated with each of thefe refpeClive places; for that place thall give\na higher degree of friendihip or enmity than any other, to which the\nelevation or fucceffion of fiars is the nearefi, whether in the fame fign\nor the adjoining. But the place which pa11es the ftars in configuration,\nif the ftars are friendly, denotes advantage and interefi to be the caufe of\nfriendiliip; or, if difcordant ftars occur, enmity will arife from interefted\nmot\u00b7 es, which will expire with the caufe of it. .\nThe foregoing obfervations are applicable to the mofi extravagant and\nJafiing inftances of friendlbip and enmity; but thofe which arife from\n'more temporary and trivial \u00b7cauf~s have a different fpeculation. The\ncommon occafions of friend1hip or animofity, which arife in the general\npurfuit of bufinefs or pleafure, or which arife from mixing with the\nworld, are only to he deduced fr()m the motion of tqe fi:ars taken in\nboth genitures, in order to find when the fignificatqrs in one nativity\nthall come\u00b7 to the fame point in the other nativity; for at fuch periods\nthere will arife particular friendthips or enmities, which will have du-\nration no longer than .the refpeHive familiarity or _connexion of thefe\n.fi:ars exift. Saturn and Jupiter, coming in this manner to each other's\nplaces, caufe friendlbip by meeting in focieties or company; or by agree-\nment in hufuandry and agriculture, or by the joint inheritance of for-\ntunes. Saturn and Mars produce fi:rife and contention, and often fore-\nfuew premeditated fraud and villainy. Saturn and Venus denote Jove and\nfriendiliip through the interference of kindred, but it hath no duration.\nSaturn and Mercury produce friendiliip by converfation or connexion in\nbofinefs, fcience, or confederacy. Jupiter and Mars produce enmity by\npolitics, improper perferment, or interefied mcafures of government.\nJupi~er and Venus occafion friendfuip through the interference .of wo--\n.men, ecclefiafiics, or teachers; Jupiter and Mercury through mutual\nattachment to literature, fcience, and philofophy; Mars and Venus\ncaufe friendthip by a like difpofition to lafcivioufnefs, .diffipation, and\nintemperance; Mars and Mercury produce enmity by fimilar intcrefts\nin bufinefs, or by the fame parties following the fame avocation; but\nVenus and Mercury by means of jealoufy, learning, co~refpondence by\nletter, or love of women. \u00b7 .\nThe increafe or decreafe of friendfuip and enmity is difcerned from the\nnature of the poife1fed places of each fi&nificator, \u00b7 compared wi~h the\n1 \u00b7 \u00b7 firft\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fOF AST.ROLOGY. 461\nfirft four principal places of the figures for, if they apply to the place of\nthe part of fortune, or to the luminaries angular, they render the friend-\n1hip or enmity more confpicuous; but, feparated and disjoined, they\u00b7\nmake them obfcnre and fecret. To know whether thefe affed:ions 1hall\nbe more or lefs injurious or advantageous, we are to obferve the force\nand power of the ftars which behold the above-mentioned places, and\njudge according to their quality and difpofition either to good or evil.\nBut, if it relates to good or evil from fervants, the place of the ruling\ndifpofition in refpeEl of them in the figure muft be taken from the fign\nin the twelfth houfe, and from the ftars which behold the place in the\ngeniture itfelf, with the ingretfes or oppofition; but more particularly \u00b7\nwhen the rulers of the figns have either familiarity with the principal\nplaces of the geniture, or are contrarily and unhappily configurated;\nfr9m which judgment muft be made accordingly. .\nOf the Natural IN<;:LINATION for TRAVELLING.\nThe circumftances which relate. to travelling are confidered fro~ the\npofition of the luminaries in refpeEl to the angles, but chiefly ftom thofe\nol the Moon; for, if file be found in the feventh houfe, and declining\nfrom angles, ilie denotes ~ continual difpofition for travelling, and perpe-\ntual change of place, to .the native. Mars himfelf being occidental, or\ndeclining from the midhcaven, and having an oppofite or quartile pofi-\ntion to the luminaries, will proc!uce the fame inclination in a fomewhat\n]efs d.egree. But, if the part of fortune falls in the fame fign with thtf\nfignificator of travelling, the principal part of the life and actions of'\nthe native will be fpent in a foreign country.\nWhenever the benevolent planets irradiate the above,.mentioned places\nof the-luminaries, or Mars, or the part of fortune; or fucceed to them,.\nthe \u00b7native\u00b7s \u2022tr-avelling will be glorious and profitable, and his return\nfafe and without impediment ; but, if the malevolent ftars behold or\nfucceed, the contrary effeets will be found to happen. In all thefecafes,\nhowever, the quality and temperament of the fmaller familiarities, asthey\nadd to or take from the power and force of their configurations, muft\nbe invariably attended to. If the luminaries incline or fall to the ori-\nental quadrants, the travelling will be towards the eaftern or fouthern\nparts of the globe, confidered in refpcEl to the place of birth; but, if\nthey are found in the occidental quadrants, the peregrination will be to..\nwards the north or weft. If the Jigns in which the fignificators of tra-\nvelling are pofited be of one form, either in refpeet of themfelves, or\nof the ftars which have the lord1hip over them, the travelling will be\n. far,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f.... ....\n462 A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N\nfar, but at intervals; but~ if the figns are double-bodied, or or two\nforms, it will be perpetual, and of vaft extent.

Thefe appellation~\nltave all the fame meaniogt and fignify that planet or ftar which is lord qf' .\nlife. The firft is derived from the Greek, the fecond from the. Hebcew,.\nand the latter from the Latin. .\n. The hylegiacal or prorogatory places are in number five, viz, thq\n~fcendan~ the feventh, nintbll tenth, and eleventh, houies, and are ta-\nken from the five degrcses next and immediately above the cufp of the\nafcendant to the twenty-five dc:grees below the cufp of the fame., com.\nputed by oblique afcen.fioo. In the fame manner the prorogatory places.\nare. determined in tbe feve~th, ninth. tenth,. and. eleventh, h.oufes ; for\nioftance1 it is computed from the five degrees in _\nthe eighth houfe, tG\nthe middle of the eleventh houfe, towards the twelfth; which middle\nis eafily found, by adding half the femidiurnal arch to the right afcenfion.\nof the medium c~H, and where that ends is the middle of the eleventh\nhoufe; the part beyon~ which is not bylegiacal or prorogatory. \u00b7 Now\nthefe only are the places in \u00b7which the planet who a1fumes the power of\nhyleg or giver of Ji.fe' ca11 be ioumd ; fur wbatfocver is under the earth\nis not fit for fuch dominion; nor ia: any pruition above the earth~ which\nhath not configuration to the horofcope. The twelfth houfe, therefore,\nwhich is called the ~il a11gel, is not prarogatory, becau~ it not ooly de-\nclines from . the angl\u00a2-, but alfo makes the infi.uence of the ftars potited\nthereio of an evil tendency, fincc it diil:urbs? and &S it wer\u00a2 ddlroys, the\nt,hick Va_pQur proceeding from the moifi:urc- of the earth., whereby they\nbecome\u00b7 contrary to nature both in colour and magnitude. \u00b7\nIf the native's birth be by day, the Sun thall he taken for hyleg, pro-\nro'-ator, or giver of life, if he be found in any of the foregoing hylegiacal\nplaces;. if he b~ not,, then or,ferve whether the Moon be potited in either\n<>f them,\u00b7 an.d, if fo, then the \u00a3hall be taken for fignificator of life.

It rnuft however be remembered, that this planet muft be dignified\nthree ways or more, in one of the above-mentioned\u00b7plac~s, to be to pre-\nferred; but, if no ptaoet iliould be found fo d'igniJied, or, if dignified, not\n.in an aphetica} place, then take the afcendan~ for giver of life.\nIf the ti~e of bi.rth ~appens \u00b7to be by. night. the Moo':llhall be p.re-:\n!-~rrc~ for g1ver of hfe, 1f the be pofited m any of the aphetical places of\nNo. 23. 5 U the\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f-\u00a2+ A N l L L U S T R A T.

If\nnone fuch are found in the geniture, the afcendant lhall be taken\u00b7 for\ngiver of life, if a conjunaion preceded; but, ifit was a full Moon, then\nthe part of fortune muft be preferred. If both the luminaries, or feveral\nof the planets which atfume the power of fignificator of life by the\u00b7.\nabove-mentioned conditions, are found together in thr. aphetical places,\nand feem to contend for dominion of prorogation, then that Chall be pre-\nferred which is found in the mofi: principal place of the luminaries, whe-\nther it be the Sun, Moon, or any other planet whatever. The princi~\npal places of the luminaries are th~fe : nrft, in the medium creli; next,\nin the afcendant ; then, in the eleventh houfe; next to that, the feventh;\nand, lafi:ly, the ninth houfe.

Q!JALITY of DEATH. \u00b7\nThe anaretic or killing places arc; tbe places of Saturn and Mars.\nwhich kill according to the direClion of thehyleg to the fucceeding figns.\n\u00b7when they meet either bodily, or caft their rays from any place of the\nfigure, whether it be by quartile or oppofition; and fometimes it hap-\npens by fextiles, when they proceed from figns obedient or beholding,\nbecaufe they have then the fame efficacy with the quartile or oppofition.\n\"So likewife a quartile, configurated from the foJlowing or fucceeding\nfigns to the aphetic place; and a)fo a fextile evilly affected, when .in\nfigns of long afcenfion \u2022 and even the trines, in 1hort afcenfions, have \u00b7\nfufficient force to kill, when unimpeded by benefic rays; as will alfo the\nfolar place, if the Moon be hyleg. But it muft be remembered that\nthefe places are only. anaretic when they are evilly affected; for their\nanaretic or killing power is impeded or deftroyed, whenever it falls in the\nterms of a benefic ftar, or whenever the benefics caft a fextiJe, quartile,\ntrine._ or.oppofitional, ray to the very anaretical point, or to thofe points\n\u00b7 which follow. Hence life is generally found to be preferved, when Ju-\npiter is not above twelve degrees difiant from the anareta or killing pla-\nnet; or when Venus is not more than eight. The zodiacal afpcets of\nthe anaretic or killing ftars will be Hkewife of little force, whenever the\nlatitude of the apheta, or giver of life, and that of the anareta, or de-\nJlr.oxer oi life, doth not correfpond.\nWhen\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\n.

If thefe deftruetive beams flow\noccidentally, confider the occidental place of the ftar .,. for, fuch as they\nare which have dignities in the anaretic place, fuch will be the quality\nof death; or, if no planet hath dignities therein, then fuch as before others\nare carried by their motions to thefe ariaretic places are to be efteemed\n~he caufers of death, and our judgment 1hou~ be regulated thereby; the\nconfigurations of the ftars made thereto being likewife confidered, to- .\ngether with the nature of the figns and the terms in which they fall. \u00b7\nSaturn, po1feffing the dominion of death, caufeth death by chronic\ndiftempers, phthyfics, fluxes, agues, difeafes of the fpleen, droplies~\niliac and hyfteric diftempers, and, in a word, by all thofe diforders\narifing from abundance of cold. Jupiter produceth death by the quinzey, ~\ninflammation of the lungs, apoplexy, cramps, ~nd cardiac aff~Cl:ions, and\nby thofe diforders which happen with vehement and ftinking breath-\ning. Mars caufeth death by continual fevers, femi-tertians, fudden ftrokes\nand nephritic affeCtions. fpitting of blood and hemorrhage, by abortion\nand birth, and St. Anthony\u2022s fire, and by all diforders which arife from\nabundance of heat. Venus induceth death by affeCtions of the fro-\nmach and liver, ringworms, and bloody flux'; al!o by putrefaCl:ion and\nfiftulas, and giving of poifon 1 and, in a word, by all thofe complaints\nwhich proceed from ahu.ndance of moifture, or through want or wafting\nthereof. Mercury deftroys life by madnefs, extafy. and melancholy;\nfalling ficknefs, coughs, and fpitting affeCtions, and by thofe which hap-\npen fimply through much drinefs, or a want thereof.. And thefe deaths\nhappen\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fAN ILLUSTRATION\nhappen ~aturally, when the rulers of death arc in their proper and natu-\nral quality, and none of the malefics concur. \u00b7\nViolent and remarkable deaths happen when both the malefics are\nlords of the anaretic places, or when both or one of the two arc joined to,\n.or fquare, or oppofe, or evilly affetl, both of the luminaries, or the Sun\nalone, or the MOQn; for then the mifcbievot,~fnefs and violence of death is\nproduced by the evil affeCtions of the malefics. But the remarkablenefs\n.and excraordioary cir<;umftances of the death proceed from the teftimony\nof the lights; an4 its quality is known frQm the reft of the afpecHng\nfiars, and the figns containing the malefi.cs. Saturn therefore ir~o quar-\ntile or oppofition to the Sun, orientally, and in fixed fign~, caufeth death\nby fuffocation, tumults of the peQp\\e, or by hanging or ftrangling; in\nlike manner he doth the fame if he be occidental, and the Moon follow;\no.r, if he be in beaft-like figns or plac;es, ~ eaufeth to perilh by beafts;\nand Venus, be~ng jointed to them, caufeth death by poifoo, or by the\ntreachery of women. If he is in Vifgo or Pifc:es, or in moifi figns, con-\nfi.gl,lrated to the Mo_on, he will c~ufe de~th by water, by being futfocated\nand drown~; if he be. a,bout Ar&o,. by fuipwreck; if he be in tropical or\nequinoCtial figns. the Sqn being with him, or oppofing, or if Mars be\nthere, he will cauf~ death by the effe&s o\u00a3 a fall ; if they arc in the tenth\nhoufe, death will happen by precipitation ffom Of\\ high,; thus Saturn\ncaufes tbefe c:ffcets, being configurat\u00ae. to the luminarie$. \u00b7\nMars in quartile or oppofition to the Sun, and the Sun or Moon ori\u2022\nental, in figns of human form, will caufe death by flaughter, either\ncivil or hoftile, or by laying violent hands upon himfelf. If Venus g.ivc\nteftimony, death will enfue by means of women; if Mercury IDe configu..\nrated to them, death will enfue. b.y robbers, and evil doers. and pirates.\nIf he be in mutilated or imperfect figns, or witb the Gorgon of\nferfc:us, he will induce to death by beheading, o& by the etf~ of a~pu\u00ad\ntation. Being found in Scorpio or Taurus. he will caufe 4e~~h by me-\ndical cutting and burning, or by contraCtioQ.S.; but.. if he.be found in the\nmidheaveo, or op~fite to the midh.eaven, he; ~.ill cau.fe death by.bauging ;.\nparticularly if he be foundabou.t Cepheus and.

If Jupiter gives tcftimony to Man, a,nd he;\nevilly afTeaed, death will happen through the anger of pri~ces, or by\ncondemnation.

It is therefore furprifing that fo many inventions iliould\nhave arifen, and fo many errors in confequence adopt-ed, in equating di-\nrections; fince it muft be evident to the moil: unlettered mind, and a fact\nbeyond the reach of contradiction, that the fame rule which efi:imates the\ndays, months, and years, of a man's life, from the moment of his birth,\nlikewife efiimates the progrefiive motion, in days, months, and years, of\nevery luminary within our cognizance, in the vail: extent of fpace! This\nrule is nothing more than the Sun's apparent progrefs through every de-\ngree and minute of the ecliptic, meafured by the degrees of the equator;\nto which unerring fiandard every matter that refers to any defcription or\nportion of time mufi: be ultimately brought, or all our labour, and all\nour accuracy, wil1 prove abortive and premature. \u00b7\nAccording to the common adage, \"when the difeafe is known, the cure\nis half performed;\" and fo we may fay of the meafure of directions; for.\nwhen the fiandard is known, the procefs is eafily accomplilhed, as follows.\nWhen the true arch of direction is found, by any of the foregoing rules.\nand is to be equated, take the right afcenfion of the Sun's place at the time\nof\nC gil 'ed by G()()\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nof birth, and add the arch of direction to the Sun's right afcenfion; with\n\u00b7 this fum enter the tables of the right afcenfion, and find what degree and\nminute of the ecliptic anfwers thereto; then take the Ephemeris for the\nyear of birth, and note how many days and hours the Sun will be; from\nthe time\u00b7of birth, in coming to that degree and minute of the ecliptic;\nand for every perfect day, which is .twenty-four hours, account a year,\nand for every two hours over and above the even days, a month, and f<>\nin the fame proportion for minutes and feconds of time, and the -arch of\ndirection will be truly equated; as will be fhewn by repeated examples,\nin equating the dir~ctiona of the following nativities.\nI flatter myfelf that the rules given in this .fyfiem of directions, if\ncarefully attended to, will be amrly fufficient to familiarize any of my\nrea_ders. in this impor~ant branch o the occ~lt fciences, without the aid of\nwhich, little or nothing can be done in the calculation of nativities.\nFor . though it be admitted, that a ftudent may make great advances in\nthe knowledge of futurity, by acquiring an adequate. comprehenfion of\nthe nature and effects of the various configurations and familiarities of the\ncelefi:ial bodies, and of their particular influence both benefic and ma-\nlefic upon the human race; and though we may by this means attain to\nknow that fuch and fuch events will certainly come to pafs; yet even\nthis acquifition in the fcience mufi: be confidered incomplete, without\nthe ability of pointing out, by fome fixed and certain rule, the precife\ntime when thefe events ihall happen. This is not to b~ attained by the\nmethods ufed in the vplgar Afrrology, as already laid down in the former\npart of th~s work, where the common Aftrology is treated of, but with\ngreat rilk and uncertainty, and was therefore only introduced for the pur..\npofe of anfwering horary queftions, where correctnefs, in this particular,\nis little attended to by any modem profeffors.\nThis grand acquifition is therefore not to be obtained by any other\nmode, than that of bringing up the arch of direction of each refpective\n.ftgnificator in the native's figure of birth, to the afpect which denotes\neach refpective event; and this arch of direction, as I have before ob-\nfcrved, is nothing more than the track or circle in the heavens formed\nby the fignificator in moving from that particular point in the heavens\nwhere he is found at the birth; fo the precife point where he forms the\nafpect with the promittor that indicates the even.t, which, upon his ar-\nrival there, is to happen. It is confequently apparent, that if this track\nor circle can bj:: found, :Jnd its content in degrees and minutes accurately\ntaken, and reduced into common time according to the motion of the\nSun, which regulates all our accounts of time, it will 1hew us at one\nview,\noigit;zed by Coogle\n\f4s6 AN ILLUSTRATION\nview, the exact time when the event, according to the common courfe of\nnature, !hall infallibly come to pafs.\nIn this procefs confifts the whole myftery of afcertaining the period of\nman's life, which is thought fo wonderfula matter by fome, and confi-\ndered altogether impoffible by others; and yet it is no more than a fimple\noperation of nature, deduced from an intimate knowledge with fecond\ncaufes. For this is a rule that will never be found to fail., if our arith-\nmetic be true, that at the very time the principal fignificafor in a nativity,\nthat is, the giver of life, fuall arrive_ at the anaretical\u00b7point of the afpect\nof the killing planet, the native iliall furely depart this life; provided\nno benefic rays at the fame time irradiate the place, or in any afpect con-\ncur to impede the killing force, which may always be known from the\ndifpofition of the benefic planets in the nativity. If t-his a1fertion be\ntrue, which bas been proved by innumerable examples in all ages of the\nworld, and which I truft will be confirmed by the nativities following,\nit is evident that we can, by the foregoing rules, bring up the directions\nwith fufficient accuracy to afcertain the precife length \u00b7of time in years,\nmonths# and days, in which the fignificator of life will be in\u00b7moving to\nthe anareticat or killing point; and juft fo long will be the life of that\nnative. Where then is the myftery or impoffibility of afcertaining the \u00b7\n\u00b7period of human life, and with extraordinary precifion? B~t this accu-\nracy wholly depends ~pon the true time of birth being obtained; for a\nfailure here in the radica1 point will deftroy the whole calculation, and\nnothing predicted therefrom can poffibly happen but by the effect of\nchance. \u00b7.\nBut it is here nece!fary to remark, that in fuch nativities as are vital,\nand afford fufficient teftimonies of ~ ftrong and healthful conftitution,\none direction alone is feldom found to kill : for in fuch nativities there\nis required a train of malevolent direHions to concur to death; and the\ninterpofition of one fingle direction of-the benefics, even if it be a quar-\ntile or oppofition, irradiating the very anaretical point, will moft times\npreferve life. But where feveral malevolent directions of the malefic\nftars concur together, without the aid or interference of the benevolent\nplanets, they never fail to deftroy life. And here it muft be obfcrved,\nthat in fuch trains of directions we are to diftinguiili betw,cen the killing\n'plantt and that which is the caufer of the quality of death; for one pla-\nnet doth not iliew both. The (oremoft of the malefic train is the killing\nplace, and thews the time of death; but the following diN:ctions, though\nbenevolent, \u00a3hew the quality of it. If this train falls all together, and\nnone follow, then obferve thofe which precede, though at a diftance, \u00b7\n' \u00b7 md\n~igitized ~y c \u00b7\noogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nand benefic, for th~ fJUil\/ily of death~ for, though Jhe benevolent fiarS\ncontr~bute to the prefervatiol) of life, yet they frequently fpec~fy the dif-\n~afe which is the caufe of death, as we have already abundantly thewn.\n,And with thefe concur th~ col)figurating ll:ars, the quality of the fiars\nand 4gns, and the terms in which the ruling planets happen to be pofited.\nBut in violent deaths the geneth)iacal pofitions of the lu~inaries are to\npe obferved; an<i how the mal~fi~s affect them, and are alto connected by\ndireCtions in the quality of death.\nOf S E C 0 N D A R Y D ~ R E C T I 0 N S.\nAll the diret'tions hitherto treated of are termed primary direaions,\nbecaufe they are the firft and moft: important of any thing of the kind\nin the doarine of nativities .; and without the aid of thefe, all all:rologi-\ncal calculations would be vain and delufive, as muft appear obvious from\nwhat has been already premifed. But flcondary directions are by no\nPleans of fuch an extenfive confideration; nor of any great utility in the\nfcience, that I have as yet been able to difcover, particularly if accuracy\nand truth are to be preferred in thefe [peculations. For, by the ufe of\nthe primary direaions in the calculation of nativities, we are not only\nenabled to judge of the quality and influence of. the afpet'ts, but can\n)ikewife trace them to the precife time of their operation ; whereas the\nfecondary diret'tions at bell: only afford the artift: mltter for fuperficial en-\nquiry and vague conjeHure. I ihall neverthelefs explain the nature and\nufe o( them in this place, fince it is the plan of this work to comprehend\nevery praaice hitherto introduced into the fciencc! of all:rology, with a\nview to enable tbe reader to difiinguiili the ufeful and rational frol}l the\njnutile and redundant part of it.\nBy fecondary direCtions, then, we are to underftand thofe configurations .\nand familiarities of the planets which arife daily from the time of birth,\n.\nand are applied to the prediction of events that are to come to pafs in the\nfame fucceffion of years from the birth as correfpond with thofe days. For\nexample, all afpects ofthe fiars, both to the 1uminaries ~nd cardinal houfes,\nthat happen on the firll: day after birth, ;ue applied to the firll: year; fhofe\n9f the fecond day after birth to the fecond year ; thofe of the third day \u00b7\nto the th~rd year); thofe of the fourth day to the fourth year.; and fo on,\nin progreffive rotation, as far as this fpeculation can extend.\nIn the management of thefedirections, weare principally toobferve what\nconfigurations the Moon has to the other planets ; for, if the be joined\nwith benefic ftars, or irradiated by their good afpects, or even by the\nNo. 2-4-. 6 C good\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f488 A N I L L U S T R A T \u00b7I 0 N\ngood afpeB:s of the infortunes, it denotes a .happy, healthful, and pro(-\nperous, year to the native, in nature and quality peculiar to the principal\nfignificator in each configuration, and to the houfes and figns in which\nthey fall in the radical figure. But on the contrary, if the Moon be\njoined .to malevolent ftars, or irradiated by them, or in parallel declina-\ntion of the infortunes, it forebodes, to thofe years pointed out by .the\ndays in which thefe evil configurations happen, great afHiClions either\nin mind, body, or eftate; and, if a primary direction fuould correfpond.\nwith them, of the fame malignant nature, a complication of temporal\nmisfortunes will moft probably enfue.\nIn the confideration of thefe diretl:ions, we are particularly to attend\n\u00b7to the critical days and climatl:erical years ; for at thofe times the good\nor evil configurations of the planets are moft powerful in their opera-\ntion. If upon either of thofe occafions the.Moon be found in quartile\nor oppofit.ion to the place in which ihe was pofited at the time of birth,\nand an evjl primary direCtion of the fignificator of life correfpond there-\nwith, death is then at the door, or at that time very much to be appre-\n. bended, even in the ftrongeft conllitutions. And fo likewife, if the Sun\nor Moon in the fecondary direCl:ions are afflicted by the malignant rays of\ninaufpicious configurations with an evil primary direction, with which\nboth the revolution and tranfit agree, it is confidered an irrevocable indi-\ncation of death to the native.\nThefe fecondary di~ections, I underftand, have always been in reputa-\ntion among the Arabs and Egyptians, who, in common practice, prefer\nthis method of predicting from the.genethliacal figure to the more com-\nplicated and laborious mode of calculation by the primary directions.\nThe former practice has doubtlefs the advantage in point of expedition;\nfor by the ufeof it in thofe countries, they will, upon the blre infpect-\ntion of a nativity, give an account of the general and particular incidents\nduring the whole courfe of the native's life ; and yet, by repeated trials\nof it myfelf, I have found it in many infiances erroneous, and therefore\nnot to be adopted in the ferious invelHgation of nativities, where accuracy\nand truth are to be defired. It it is a doctrine much on a level with that\n. of horary 9ueftions, and may be ufed to give a general idea of the native's\nfigure of birth, and of his probable bent of fortune, where time or cir-\ncumfiances will not admit ofparticular calculations.\nBut, upon delivering judgement upon either fpecies o~ directions, whe-\nther prinary or fecondary, it is abfolutely neceffary to pay the greateft\nattention to the nature and quality of the afpects we direct to, as well\nthofe\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nthofe in the world as thofe in the zodiac : for it often happens that a\nzodiacal afpect may import much good, when at. the fame point of time\na malignant mundane configuration may come up, of fo {hong and pow-\nerful a: nature as to frufi:rate all the beneficial effeBs portended by the\nformer. The want of attending to, or knowing, this, has frequently\nconfounded our modern praaitioners ; who, confiding in the benignant\ntendency of fome extraordinary good afpetls in the zodiac, have promifed\nan advance of fortune to the native, which has never come to pafs, becaufe\ncounter-afpeBs in the world, which have the fi:rongeft and neareft rela-\ntion to fub]unary 'things, have confpired, at the fame infi:ant.of ti:ne, to\nfuperfede the beneficial effeCts of the zodiacal configurations; and which\nwould perhaps have been felt in an extraordinary degree of malignity,\nwere it not that the ab. o~ve-mentioned falutary afpe~were o~pofed to\nthem. 11~ ac:u~ d.!'----~ \/.1'7\nHence it mull: appear-to every rational mind, that the firitlefr caution\u00b7\nand the utmoft deliberation are neceffary, in forming our opinion upon the\ndireHions of a nativity ; for, if at lafi we err in this, all 'our labour is loft,\nand the unfortunate enquirer is deluded with vain expeCtations of a happy\nrun ofgreat good fortune, or terrified with the approach of fome dread-\nful catafi:rophe, neither of which, by the nature of the fiars, was ever\nintended to happen. That this want ofjudge~nent has of late years been\ntoo commonly praiJi.fed upon the public, cannot be denied, nor too fe.\u2022\nverely reprobated.

I am perfuaded no difficulty whatever w~JI attend the acqui-:\nfition of_ a competent knowledge of thefe,. if a proper attention be.paid.\nto them ; .without which, little progrefs can be expeCted. The moll:\naccomplifbed artifi of us all could never yet beftow the gift of infpira-\u00b7\ntion ; and therefore, without fuitable endeavours, let none attempt the\nintricate paths of fcience.\nThe Tables I 1hal1 introduce in this place, are thofe for finding the\nfemidiurual and feminotlurnal Arches ; Tables of Twilight ; of Mun-\ndane Afpetls; of Right and Oblique Afceofions; of Declination, and\nAfcenfional Differences; with _fome o.thers, calculated to make the ufe of\nthe above more comprehenfive and univerfal.\nOf the T A B L E- S of S E M I D I U R N A L and S E M I ..\nN 0 C T U R N A L A R C H E S.\nAfter what has been premifed in the foregoing Treatife on Directions.\nthe neceffity of readily finding the fen1idiurnal and feminoCt:urnal Arches_\nmuft become obvious. I have therefore\u00b7 calculated a Table of them to\nevery degree of the Ecliptic for the latitude of London.; which, being\nmofi wanted, will of courfe fave the prat1itioner fome trouble. Under\nthe different latitudes in the other Tables, are fpecified the femidiurnal\narches of all the northern figns, proper to thofe latitudes ; as Aries,\nTaurus, and Gemini, at the top of the Table; and Cancer, Leo, and\nVirgo, at the bottom of the Table. But, to find the. feminoeturnal\narches proper thereto, it only requires to fubtraet the fem.idiurnal arch\nfrom twelve hours, and the remainder will be the fewinoCturnal arch\nfought.. So Jikewife the feminoeturnal arches for all the foutliern Ggns\nare\u00b7 placed \u00b7under the different latitudes in the ~a~les., havi~g ~i~ra,\nScor.pip, and Sagittarius, at the, top of the columns ; and Capricorn,\n.Aquaries; and\u00b7 -\nPifes, at the bottorn; and, to obtain .the fcu'l'idiurnal.ar~hes\ncorrdponding \u00b7with them, add the amount of the ft:(Il~not1urnal arch to\ntwelve hours, and the fum will be the femidiurnal ~rch; r~q.pi~e~ ; .many\nexamples of which will be 1hewn hereafter. \u00b7\n\u00b7 No. 25. , 6 D But,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f491 A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N\nBut, dlould the femidiurnal or feminodurnal arches be required for\nany latitude not f~ified in the Tables, they may be found thus : Firft,\nfind the declination of the planet under the pole of birth ; and, if the\ndeclination falls-in any of the fix northern. figns, add the difference of\nAfcenfion to ninety degrees, and the fum will be the femidiurnal arch, in\ndegrees and minutes; if the afcenfional difference be !ubtracted from\nninety degrees, the r~ainder will be the femidiurnal arch. But, if the\nckdination tl\\ould faU in either of the fix fouthern figns, then fubtraa\nthe difference of afcenfion from ninety degree&, for the femidiurnal arch \u2022\nand add the afcenfional difference to ninety degrees, for the feminoElur-\nnal arch. If the arches thos found are divided by fix, they will give\nthe horary times, or t1\"Ue length of the planetary hours ; and, if divided\nby three, they will. give the true difi:ance of one houfe, by which method\nthe true divifion of all the houfes may be obtained, according to the\nrules of Ptolomy _; two of which parts make a fextile, as appears more\nobvioufly by the Table of Mundane Afpecls, wherein are fpecified aU the\nafped:s that are made in the world.\nOf the T A B L E S of T W I L I G H T.\nThe ufe of thefe Tables, in bringing up the arches of direB:ions, bath\nbeen already mentioned ; it will tbetefote be fufficient in this place to\ninform the reader how\u00b7 to make ufe of them. The firfi: column on the\nleft hand contains the parallels of Twilight ; and the body of t\u00b7he Tables\nihews the diftance the Sun mull: be from the eaftern or weftern angles, that\nis, from the afcendant or feventh houfe, to be in thofe parallels; therefore,\nwhenever thefe Tables are ufcd.for any calculations, the following me-\nthod muft be ac!opted: Take the oblique afcenfion of the afcendant\nunder 'be pole of birth, from whence fubtratl the oblique afcenfion of\nthe Sun, and the remainder will be its primary difi:ance, which is to be\nfought in the Tables as near as poffible to that degree which the Sun is\nin; which being found, look in the column of Parallels of Twilight,\nand fee what parallel correfponds with it, for under that parallel the\narch of Twilight muft be taken; examples of which will hereafter be\nfrequently given.\nOf the T A B L E S of M U N D A N E A S P EC T S.\nThe firl\\ column \u00b7of thefe Tables contains the femidiurnal and femi-\nnofturnal arches, from three to nine hours~ oalculated to every, fix mi-\nnutes.

Example: Suppoie a ilac\nin teo def:rces of Virgo,, with one degree twenty-feven minutes north\n\"latitude; enter the table of declinations, finding Virgo in the head\nof the table; and againft ten degrees under one degree of luitudc l\nfind eight degreca forty-feven minutes, and againft ceo degrees under\ntwo degrees of latitude I find nine degrees forty-two-minutes; the dif-\nference is fifty-five minutes. Then, for the part proportional agreeing to\nthe odd minuteS of latitude., il fay, If fixty give fifty-five. what !hall\ntwenty-fcven give ? It gives twenty-fiv~; which, added to eight degree&\nforty-feven minutes, leaves the declination of the point fought. nine de-\ngrees twelve minutes. But, if the ftar had been in twenty degrees of\nAries, I muft have entered at the foot of the table; and, having the\nfame latitude, the fame declination would emerge.\nOf\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f49-4 A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 _N\n0 f the T A B L E S of the A S C E N S I 0 N A L D I F F E-\nR E N C E S of the P L A N E T S.\nThe aicenfional difference is a certain arch of diftance, \u00b7between t)le\nright and oblique afcenfions of any ftar or planet, in any degree of the\nEcliptic; and, to find it by the following Tables of Differences, obferve\nthe following rules. Enter with the degrees of d\u00b7eclination on th.e left\nhand of the Table, and under the circle of pofition in th~\u00b7 head, in the\ncommon angle of meeting, with equation, will be found the afcenfional\ndifference required. Example : Suppofe a planet to have ten degrees of\ndeclination, and his circle of pofition be fifty-one degrees forty-two mi-\nnutes ; I enter with ten degrees on the left hand under the cirCle of fifty-\none degrees, and there I find . twelve degrees thirty-five minutes ; but,\nhaving forty-two minutes more, I take the part proportional between\nfifty-one degrees and fifty-two degrees, viz.\ndeg.\nDeclination ten degrees latitude. { ~~\ndeg.\n12\n13\nmin.\n35\n3\n----------\nDifference 0\nThen I fay, by the rule of proportion, Iffixty give twenty-eight, what\n~all forty-two, the odd minutes of the circle of pofition, give? It gives\ntwenty nearly; which, added to twelve degrees thirty-fivemin~tes, gives\nthe true afcenfional difference, twelve degrees fifty-five minutes of the\npoint fought.\nHaving obtained the afcenfional difference, the ufe of it, in the art of\ndirections, is as fo1lows : Firft, if the declination be north, fubtract\nthe afcenfional difference from the right afcenfion, and the temainder\nwill be the oblique afcenfion ; but, if you add it to the right afcenfion,\nthe fum will be the oblique defcenfion. Secondly, when the declina-\ntion is fouth, add the afcenfional difference to the right afcenfion, and the\nfum will be the oblique afcenfion; but, if you fubtract it from the right\nafcenfion, the remaind~r will be the oblique defcenfion. And note,\nthat the afcenfional difference is only of fervicc when the planet or ftar\nhath latitude. .\nOf\n-.J\n_Digitize~ by Coogle\n\f0 F \u00b7 A~ S T R 0 L ~ 0 Y.. 49$\n. . . .\n\u00b7 Of the T A B L RS o_f 0 B L I Q._U E A SC ~ N S I 0 N S for\nthe L A !

it is fufficient for the reader to know, that ad-\ndition of logarithms is the fame thing as multiplication in common arith-\nmetic, and fubtraCl:ion in logarithms the fame as divifion; therefore in\nmultiplication by logarithms, add the logarithms of the multiplicand and\nmultiplier together, and their fum is the logarithm of the produd; and\nin divifion, fubtraet the logarithm of the divifor from the 1ogaritham of\n\u00b7 the dividend, and the remainder is the logarithm of the quotient. To\nextraCt the roots of powers by logarithms, divide the logarithm of the\nnumber by the index of the power, and the quotient is the logarithm of\n~he root fought; to raife a number.to any power, multiply the logarithm\nof the number by the index of that power, and the produCt is the loga-\nrithm of the power to which the number was required to be raifed.\nTABLE~\nOigitized by Coogle\n\fT A B L E S\n0 F\nL 0 G I STICAL L 0 GAR IT H M s.\u2022\nFor finding the Part proportional both to\nT I M E and M 0 T I 0 N.\n..-\nDigitized by Coogle\n_.\n\f,,\n.,\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.

When any plane~ .is to he direCted to the oppofite part of the\nheavens, it mull then be directed with oppofite latitude.\nVIII. No planet, except the Sun and Moon, can be directed to either\n.a fe.xtile, trine, or quartile, of its radical place\u2022\n.a The Sun and Moon, and Venus and Mercury, can only be direaed converCely, that is, con-\ntrary to the fucceffion of figns, they being the only planets capable of the rapt motion. \u00b7\n\u00b7 IX. The\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f0 F A 5 T R 0 L 0 G Y.\nIX. The Sun moves in the zodiac only, and meets all bodies or afpeCls\ntherein, it being his unalterable courfe, that is, without latitude; but,\nwhen he is directed to a planet or ~odiacal parallel with latitude, it is\nthen calJed a direClion in mundo; but, when direCted to a planet without\nlatitude, it is termed a zodiacal direCtion, and is either direCt or converfe,\nas the motion of the planet is either with, or contrary to,\u00b7 the fucceffion\nof figns. \u00b7\nX. The Moon meets all rays in the circle of latitude in which file\nconftantly moves, and that is always out of the ecliptic, except when\nlhe is in her nodes; and therefore, when fue is direQ:ed, ~s .a fignificator\nwith latitude, to a promittor in the zodiac, the latitude of the Moon's\nplace muft be found. Under this latitude, the declination muft be fought,\nwhich thews the oblique afceofion or dtf<;enfion under the pole of the\nMoon i arid hence the arch of direction is corref:Uy found, by fubtrad:.-\ning the oblique afcenfion or defcenfton of the Moon onder her pole, not\nforgetting that this oblique afcen{ion or defcenfion muft be taken ac-\ncording to the latitude of her place at the hour of birth. This is'called\na zodiacal direCtion with latitude; but, when tlie Moon is direCted to .aa\nafped without latitude, the place of .the zodiac where the afped falls\nis to be taken without latitude, both in right afcenfion and declination;\nand thus find the oblique defcenfion or afcenfion of the point under the\npole of the Moon; from which fubtraCl: the oblique afcen1ioo or defcenfion\nof the Moon, taken according to the latitude \u00a3he had at the time of birth,\nand the arch of direction is found, which is to be converted into years as\nbefore.\nXI. Directions are of two forts; zodiacal and mundane. \u00b7 The Sun and\nMoon are capable of being directed both ways J but the angles of a figure\ncan only be diretled in mundo, they being {ubject to the accidents and\ndivifion of no circles, but thofe which conftitute the meafure of each\nquadrant, and are meafured by the parts of the diurnal and feminotl.urnal\narches; therefore they never meet any rays with latitude but bodies .and\noppofitions.\nXII. The mid-heaven and afcendant are two different \u2022 circles. The\nmid-heaven meets all rays, and meafures all afpeCts by the zodiac; but the\nafcendant, by the rapt motion or horary circle; by which motion the di-\nurnal circle is alfo meafured, the houfes of heaven divided, and the mun..\ndane afpeHs proportionably meafured.\n. .\n\u2022 The zodiacal circle meafures thirty-fix minutes to an hour, but the rapt motion, or horary cir-\ncle, is fometimes more or lefs, according to the length of the femidiurnal arch or planetary hour.\n\u00b73 The\nDigitized by Coogle\n\ftl\n\u2022\n611 AN ILLUSTRATION\n-The knowledge of equating the planet's places for difr~rent meridians he-\ning abfolutely necdfary for calculating the nativities of rho1~ perfoos who\nwc:re born under the meridian of London, for which\u00b7 latitude the Ephe-\nmerifes are generally calcubted; I \u00a3hall now teach how to calculate ei-\nther the mundane or zodiacal direelions for any other latitude, and how\na planet in one meridian\u00b7 may be reduced to that of another, with the ut-\nmoft degeee of correclnefs and precifion.\nFor example, fuppofe it were required- to know the- difference between\n-the meridians of London and Brifi:ol; refer to page 179 of this worlc, and\non the 111h of June, at twelve o'clock at noon, the Moon is in five\ndegrc(!S forty-fix minutes of Aries, under the meridian of London ;\nhut, to reduce it to the meridian of Bri!l:oJ, purfue the following method.\nSee by the table, page :zoB, the longitude of London, and it will be\nfound _ 23 26\nSubtraa the longitude of BriftoJ, which is \"19 41\nAnd there remains 3 45\nWith this difference, t.hree degrees forty-five minutes, look into the table\nfor turning the degrees of the equator into time, in page 2o6; then refer\nto table the fccond, by which it will be found, that one degree gives four\nminutes; and confequently, three degrees forty-five minutes, the dif-\nference of the two longitudes~ mull give fifteen minutes difference of\ntime in two meriditns; and, as Britlol is fituate well from London, the\nMoon muil be in five degrees forty-fix minutes of Aries, fifteen minutes\nbefore _\nnoon at Britlol, and at noon, viz. at twelve o'clock accordin_g to\n.her own motion in an _\nhour, gives for that time, going at the rate of\nthirty-three minutes forty-feven feconds the quarter of an hour, eight\nminutes twcnty-feven feconds, which, being added to five degrees forty-\nfix minutes, make five degrees fifty-four minutes and tvrenty-feven 1e-\nconds of the Moon in Aries, at twelve o'clock at Briftol. And here note,\nthat, if the place were fituate eaft from LonQon, then the difference of time\nmuft have been fubtraded from the meridian of London, which would\nin the fame manner have iliewn the difference of the meridians.\nEND of -the FIRST VOLUME.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f19 ASTROLOGY.- ibley's (E) Complete Illustration of the\nAstrological and Occult ciences; comprehending the\nart of foretelling future events by the Heavenly bodies.\nTVith numerous curious copper-plates, ~nd ativities and\nincantations; portrait. 2 vols. 4to, 'half calf. caret.\n1795\n'\nDigitized by Coogle\n\f","_id":1317}
