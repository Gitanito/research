Forbes Winslow read a paper on \" The Need for\nAdvance in Psychology.\"\nThe 14 0th General Meeting was held in the Queen's (Small)\nHall, Langham Place, London, W., on Thursday, May 23rd,\n1912, at 5 p.m., the President, The Right Rev. Bishop\nW. Boyd Carpenter, D.D., in the Chair.\nThe President delivered the Address which is printed below.\nA\n\f2 Right Rev. Bishop W. Boyd Carpenter. [part\nI.\nPKESIDENTIAL ADDEESS.\nDelivered on May 23rd, 1912.\nBy the RIGHT REV. BISHOP W. BOYD CARPENTER, D.D.\nI had much hesitation in accepting the office which I have\nthe honour now to hold. I did not deem that I possessed\nthe requisite original equipment or the acquired knowledge to\ndeal worthily with the work and objects of the Society. Never-\ntheless, the kind and sympathetic way in which my difficulties\nwere met by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick and Sir William Barrett\nawakened another feeling, and led me to fear lest churlishness\nor indolence might be urged against me if I sought to escape\nthe task to which I was invited.\nI occupy from the nature of the case a position somewhat\ndifferent from that of my predecessors in this office. They\nwere experts ; I am not : they held high place in the world\nof thought ; I do not.\nI cannot claim that happy acquaintance with detailed experi-\nments, or that patient study of phenomena, which were so\nevident in Mrs. Henry Sidgwick's Presidential Address : I cannot\nclaim the right of continued study which would lead me to follow\nMr. Arthur Balfour or Mr. Gerald Balfour into the regions of\nprofounder philosophy : I cannot claim scientific authority, made\nsecure by brilliant and successful investigations, which gave\nweight to the utterances of Sir Oliver Lodge : I cannot claim\nthe wide range of knowledge and happy gifts of my predecessor\nin office : I come to you from a life whose studies have been\ncrippled by the continuous interruptions of inevitable duties : I\ncannot claim to do more than put before you some thoughts\nwhich have been pressed upon me from many sides and which\nmay give you, if not any useful contribution to your investigations,\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 3\nat least the suggestion of some questions which may have\noccurred to the minds of others.\nFirst, may I make my confession of faith and speak of\nthe conviction which led me to take an interest in the work\nof the Society ? My interest was aroused by the studiously\nscientific spirit which it claimed.\nThere are some people who are attracted to this Society by\na vague hope of some startling or sensational facts : the vague\nand vulgar world prefers sensation to truth. But the very title\nadopted by the Society carries a constant caution : it is a\nSociety for research, and research needs those qualities of mind\nand thought which we associate with the adjective scientific,\nviz. extreme caution in accepting evidence, rigorous investigation\nof facts, determined refusal of doubtful narratives, a prudent\nscepticism and a vigorous maintenance of mental equilibrium.\nThe true spirit of research does not want romance : it carries\na wholesome distrust of eager garrulity : it knows that the\nevidence of the senses is often deceptive. Whatever attractive\nadornments may embellish a tale, it is better to be loyal to\ntruth than to be the victims of illusion : and as members of\nthis Society we are not seeking copy for works of imagination :\nwe are anxious to reach fundamental facts ; we seek the gold\nwhich will stand test : we are ready to crush into powder the\ngreat masses of ignorance and superstition in which it may\nbe embedded.\nA very interesting paper was written seventy years ago by\nthe Secretary to the Eoyal Institution, the Eev. John Barlow.\nThe subject of the paper was Man's power over himself to\nprevent or control insanity. In 1843 men did not possess\nthe physiological knowledge of to-day ; but the suggestions\nmade by the writer are, if I mistake not, as useful to-day as\nthey were two generations ago. According to Mr. Barlow, the\ndifference between the madman and the sane is not in the\npresence of the illusion, but in the power or want of power\nor resolution to examine it. The illusion is not the madness :\neven the mental derangement is not the madness. The\nresolution to discriminate is the protective power, which keeps\nmadness at arm's length. To illustrate this position he cited\nthe case of Dr. Nicolai of Berlin (1799). Dr. Nicolai had\npassed through times of much anxiety and trouble, and he\n\f4 Right Rev. Bishop W. Boyd Carpenter. [part\nbecame subject to painful experiences : he saw in his room the\nfigure of a dead acquaintance : he realized that this experience\nwas due to some brain derangement, and he refused to yield\nto the illusion. As his health was re-established, the haunting\npresence vanished. A similar experience befell Dr. Bostock of\nLondon. In both these cases some derangement had taken\nplace : in both cases the men possessed the vigour of mind to\ndiscriminate between fact and illusion : both were victorious in\na struggle which might have ended in insanity.\nNow no reasonable member of a Society whose purpose is\ncareful research will do other than applaud the attitude of\nmind which so preserved its equipoise as to refuse to be terrified\nout of its wits, and which by holding fast its integrity was\nable to show that even brain derangement ought to be faced,\nwatched and conquered, while in the conquest the true nature\nof the illusion was made manifest. \"I took occasion\" (writes\nMr. Barlow) \" to notice a peculiar force in man, which is capable\nof assuming control over this (a certain) portion of the brain\nand, through it, over the greater part of the bodily functions\na force whose agency, as Professor Liebig has well observed, is\nentirely distinct from the vital force, with which it has nothing\nin common ; but in so far as it is in connection with matter,\nmanifests itself as an acceleration, a retarding or a disturbance\nof the '\nprocesses of life.' We find therefore, as this acute\nobserver (i.e. Dr. Liebig) goes on to state, two forces in authority\ntogether, namely, the mechanical-vital force, or as he terms\nit the vegetative life, and the source of the higher phenomena\nof mental existence which is of a perfectly distinct and so far\nsuperior nature, that it is able sometimes to exercise a dominion\nover the vital force, which nullifies its action and at all times\nmodifies and controls it.\"\nWe should not state these matters in the same terms to-day,\nbut their statement even in obsolete phraseology will be welcome\nbecause of the strong and vigorous good sense in which Mr.\nBarlow deals with illusions, and because of the clear way in\nwhich he insists on the influence which the mind can exercise\nover the body and its functions. We have travelled far since\nMr. Barlow wrote his paper, but to me it was a surprise to\nfind in 1843 such modern conceptions. I do not suppose that,\nnotwithstanding our advance in knowledge, there is anything\n\flxv.] Presidential Address. 5\nin Mr. Barlow's substantial position which will be seriously\nchallenged to-day, and I feel sure that the members of this\nSociety will endorse the wisdom of his conclusions, viz. that\nthe resolution to maintain our power of discrimination in the\npresence of abnormal phenomena is essential to the maintenance\nof our mental equilibrium. I am glad, therefore, to think that\nthe bridle of a wholesome scepticism is always provided in this\nSociety : the nature of the incidents and phenomena which\nform our stock-in-trade are of a character which might tempt\nthe unwary or the imaginative to give free rein to their fancy.\nIn societies as well as in individuals we need to avoid being\ntaken captive by illusions : we need the dry light of reason\nwe need the persistent and trained habit which can, not only\nlisten to, but cross-question evidence. A lawyer of unusually\nwide experience said to me, \" There is little truth in the witness\nbox.\" It is the task of the skilful counsel to extract the modicum\nof truth which is there. No progress will be made by rejecting\nall evidence as tainted on the plea that human weakness and\neven human wickedness may be met with in our investigations.\nIt is a difficult task to separate the chaff from the wheat or\nto extract the gold from the rocky mass in which it is embedded ;\nbut if we want either the fruit of the harvest or the precious\nore, we must face the difficulties, and we must possess the\npatience of mind which can detect some rational sequence even\namong irrational and inconsequential statements of fact.\nWe may, therefore, readily welcome all material supplied for\ninvestigation, as long as we are candid enough to publish\ncriticisms from all intelligent sources : those who welcome Sir\nOliver Lodge's happily safeguarded and suggestive lines of thought\nor Sir W. Barrett's careful exposition of Poltergeists, Old and New,\nwill not resent the humorous scepticism of Mr. Andrew Lang\nor the healthy doubts of Count Solovovo. The last number\nof the Proceedings (Part LXIV.) seemed to me to be felicitously\ntypical of the fitting attitude of the members of this Society.\nIt may be asked, and it is right that the question should\nbe asked, whether this Society has contributed any influence\nof practical good to the world. The man in the street, to\nuse a familiar and suggestive expression, may be pardoned if\nhe looks askance at inquiries which must seem to him specu-\nlative, vague and irrelevant to life's practical activities, and he\n\f6 Right Rev. Bishop W. Boyd Carpenter. [part\nmay be forgiven if in his resentment against what he deems\nwasted time and energy he asks whether anything which can\nbe translated into terms of practical value has been given to\nmankind as a result of these prolonged and costly inquiries.\nWe must not be surprised that men who measure all things\nby utility ask\u2014what good does it do ?\nNow there is one reply to this question which I venture\nto make\u2014at the same time emphasizing the caution that this\nSociety cannot be held responsible for the views of any of its\nofficials, and that the President, even in his presidential address,\ncan only speak for himself. One good, however, I think can\nbe claimed as a practical result towards which the work of\nthis Society has contributed. We passed\u2014I speak of those\nwho have reached threescore and ten\u2014we passed through a\nperiod of very crude and blatant materialism some forty or\nfifty years ago : the pages of popular magazines blazed with\nthe firework conclusions of scientific materialism. Matter was\nthe fundamental fact in the universe : nothing could be done\nwithout matter : thought was only a smoke given off by heated\nmatter : genius not merely depended for its expression upon\nthe material in the brain, but was simply a manifestation of\nbrain stuff. I remember being challenged by a dying man\nwith this question : how could God think, seeing that He was\nspirit and therefore could have no brain ? In such crude\nforms of thought the materialism of the day revelled. Men\nthink differently now. Mind then was nothing but an effluvium\nof the brain-cells. Now we are told that \" matter is a pauper-\ndenizen of the conceptual world.\"\n1\nTo-day the attitude of science is changed : the relation of\nbrain to thought is better understood : we realize that our\nphysical nature puts limitations upon our opportunities of\nthought, and also that limits have been set to the materialist\nhypothesis. No sane man, indeed, will deny that our powers\nof thought are largely governed by brain conditions : every one\nrecognizes the strong and constant influence of the body over\nthe mind : we know that the power to express ourselves is\nnot unlimited, but strictly limited by the instrument put into\nour care : we cannot contribute to the world more than the\ninstrument will allow, any more than a violin can give forth\n'See Mind, April, 1912, \"Matter and Memory,'' by E. D. Fawcett.\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 7\nthe sounds of a trumpet or the cymbals take the range of the\norgan. Live things, as Sir Oliver Lodge has reminded us, 1\ncannot alter the quantity of energy, they can merely utilize\navailable energy like any other machine. To use the image\nemployed by a French bishop, Monsigr. d'Hulst, \" The master\nof a house may, if he is not satisfied, discharge his servants,\nbut the soul of man does not possess a like freedom : it must\nbe content with the bodily organs which are in this sense his\nservants ; but its dependence upon them goes even further ; for\neven for the most purely intellectual processes a co-operation\nand co-ordination of physical powers is necessary : thought\ndemands blood, and when the blood supply is scant and poor\nthe energy of thought is impaired.\"\nWe may admit all this, but nevertheless the sturdy materi-\nalistic hypothesis of a generation ago has given place to a\nmore modest and reasonable judgment. If the body has power\nover the mind, the mind has power over the body : the world\nhas realized this : the very extravagances of what is called\nChristian Science are the evidence of the reaction which has\ntaken place. We are not bound to leap to extremes, but we\nmust recognize that the materialist of other days rode his\nhobby-horse till he killed it. Reasonable men, men of reflec-\ntive powers, and men of scientific experience, who frankly\nacknowledge the power of the body over the mind, are never-\ntheless as strongly convinced of the power of the mind over\nthe body. Professor Dubois does not hesitate to declare that\nthe ills brought upon men through the mind are more frequent\nthan those caused by bodily disorders. He relates that a man,\nthrough mere mental impression, caught a cold because his\nneighbour turned the page of a newspaper quickly and in doing\nso caused a slight current of air.\n2\nThis may remind us that\nwhen large panes of glass were introduced into windows\ninstead of the old-fashioned small panes, Samuel Eogers, the\npoet, caught cold, because being placed with his back to one\nof the new large-paned windows, he could not rid himself of\n1\nLife and Matter, p. 133.\n\"Be Finfluence de Fesprit sur le corps (Fraulke, Berne, 1908), p. 75. See, how-\never, Prof. Mosso on Fatigue (p 195), who noted that consciousness returns\nwhen awaking from sleep without any change in the blood circulation of the\nbrain.\n\f8 Right Rev. Bishop W. Boyd Carpenter. [part\nthe idea that the window behind him was open. If, said a\nphysician to me at one of our large provincial hospitals, we\ncould calm the minds of our patients, the cure of their bodies\nwould be more simple and rapid. Everywhere the power of\nmind over the body is recognized : hypnotism, auto-suggestion,\nand a hundred other words tell the same tale, viz. that\ninquiry to-day is turning more and more to the deeply\ninteresting problem\u2014is the mind or soul of man endowed\nwith power to govern or modify physical nature ? We do not\nnow believe that matter is the sole antecedent and condition\nof mind : we are much more likely to follow out the sugges-\ntion that mind can sway matter, and the question which we\nare putting to ourselves is not whether it can be done ; for\nwe know that it can, but what are the limits and conditions\nunder which mind\u2014the human mind as we know it\u2014can con-\ntrol or modify the action of the body or the physical world\nwhich environs us. And here the work of this Society has\nbeen recognized.\nOne very ardent advocate of the virtue of this mental\npower has referred his hearers to the Proceedings of this\nSociety as giving the best and most helpful material for\narriving at a just and wise conclusion on this matter. It\ncannot be denied that in the revolt against the low-levelled\nmaterialism which threatened to rob mankind of its noblest\nprerogatives, its most splendid inheritances, and its most in-\nspiring outlook, this Society has played a quiet, modest and\nmost effective part in recalling men's thoughts to the need of\na more careful study of their own innermost nature, if they\nare to measure rightly the position which man holds and is\nmeant to hold in the universe, and if they are to understand\nthe significance and value of the priceless gift of life, which\nopens to us such wondrous opportunities of knowledge and\nself-culture, of hope and high endeavour.\nI have thus touched on the spirit and achievements of the\nSociety. I now must proceed with greater caution, as I do with\ngreater hesitation, when I venture to set before you some\nthoughts connected with the work which lies before us.\nWe speak of man as human being, but man is not a com-\npleted being : he is a being in process. He is one in whose\nnature is held not only present consciousness but notes of the\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 9\npast. If so, may not some of the exceptional phenomena which\nchallenge investigation result from the dim inheritances or relics\nof old forces ? But further, man is a being in process, and\nanticipations of the future may find place in him. May not\nsome phenomena be accounted for as movements of nascent\nactivities in man's nature ?\nTo make the proposition good, it needs to be shown that\u2014\nMan is a being in process of completion,\nThat he still holds within his nature relics of the past,\nThat his is not a stationary nature, but a nature con-\nstantly acquiring powers and in doing so forming new\ncapacities.\n(1) Man is a being in process of completion:\nIn investigations concerning the conditions of human per-\nsonality, it has been too often taken for granted that we are\ndealing with a completed organism, whereas I am obliged to\nview man as an incomplete being : he is indeed not so much a\nbeing as a becoming : he is still in the great factory of Nature.\nIf we ignore this point of view we shall fall into the error\nwhich, without his fault, beset Paley's argument for design.\nPaley started with the illustration of a watch\u2014a piece of\nmechanism made and completed for a purpose : he could point\nto the evidences of purpose in the various parts of the mechanism\nand in the arrangement of the dial ; but the illustration which\nwas natural enough when Paley wrote, became no longer\napplicable when the great evolutionary drama was disclosed\nthe Universe was not like a watch\u2014a completed machine : it\nwas a growth, and more, it was still in process of formation\nits purpose was not written there as upon a finished piece\nof mechanism : we were living in a Universe which was still\nin the making. The simple but rough argument from design\ncould not be applied to a vast but uncompleted system.\nInvestigations must henceforth be made with the remembrance\nthat movement of development was still going on, and that\nwhile we might notice what has been called a dramatic\ntendency in the history of things, we could not so readily or so\nobviously speak of definite and detailed purpose. \" Eeality . . .\nis still in the making and waits part of its complexion from\nthe future . . . the universe is still pursuing its adventures.\" 1\n1\nProf. James, Pragmatism, p. 257, quoted in Proceedings, Vol. XXV., p. 17.\n\f10 Bight Rev. Bishop W. Boyd Carpenter. [part\nNow, the same fact needs to be kept in mind when we\nexamine into the nature of man : he is not yet a completed\nbeing : he is a being in process of formation. We can, with\nProf. Fiske,1\nfollow the history of his formation : we can go\nback to the long and wondrous story of those changes which\ntell of Natural Selection, of the influence of slight physical\nvariations on succeeding generations, of the dawn of changes\nwhich brought psychical powers into prominence, when touch\nwas translated into vision till a stage is reached when psychical\nchanges became of more moment than physical. Then came\nthat condition of animal life when strong physical resemblances\nmight be seen allied to great psychical differences. We all\nrealize the fact that through long periods the development of\nman went on : we need to remember that it still goes forward\nno longer as far as we can see on the physical, but on the\npsychical plane. In all our inquiries concerning man this fact\nneeds to be kept in view : we are not examining a finished\norganism : we are dealing with a being whose past has been a\nrecord of great physical changes, and who to-day is still the\nsubject of such psychical changes as are leading forward to\ndevelopments of power and capacity which can only be dimly\nguessed at now. The only difference, so far as we can judge,\nbetween the past and the present movement is that Nature is\nno longer concerned to develop man's physical conditions or\nstructure : her task now is to bring humanity to a higher and\ntruer perfection in the possession of qualities of soul whose full\nvalue can only be estimated when physical nature, as we\nknow it, is finally laid aside.\nWill any one think that psychical research offers a barren\nfield of inquiry when once it is realized that it is in the path\nof psychical and not of physical development that man is now\nbeing led by the same strong and mysterious force which first\nfashioned and brought to perfection his physical framework ?\nBut it is upon the simple fact that man is a being still in\nprocess of formation that I wish to fix our thoughts. The history\nof the past gives us witness of this : science with its clear\ntestimony shows that through the action of what, for lack of a\nbetter word, we may call laws, there has emerged from lower to\nhigher life man as we now know him, and that even now\n^iske, Destiny of Man, pp. 27-8.\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 11\nchanges are working if no longer for his physical, yet through\nhis physical experiences for his psychical development.\nI turn, therefore, to one aspect of man's psychical growth.\nFrom the standpoint of science man is not a stationary being,\nbut a being in process of development\u2014the subject of growth.\nThe same is true when we ask about man's consciousness of\nself : here too we meet the law of growth. Self\u2014is there\nanything more certain to us than self ? Each of us is daily\nexperiencing the power of saying\u2014It is I who felt this : It is\nI who did that : It is I who forms this judgment. In other\nwords our life is inconceivable to us apart from this most certain\nthing \" Self,\" and yet our consciousness of self may be said to\nbe a growth : this self is in truth a thing of which we gain\nconviction\u2014not immediately, but through a repeated number of\nexperiences : it is\u2014as Dr. Ward has said\u2014a product of thought,\nnot a datum of sense. It is, shall I say ? a resultant of\nexperience.\nThe baby new to earth and sky,\nWhat time his tender palm is prest\nAgainst the circle of the breast,\nHas never thought that '\nthis is I :\n'\nBut as he grows he gathers much,\nAnd learns the use of '\nI ' and 'me,'\nAnd finds '\nI am not what I see,\nAnd other than the things I touch.'\nSo rounds he to a separate mind\nFrom whence clear memory may begin,\nAs thro' the frame that binds him in\nHis isolation grows denned.\nIn Metnoriam, xlv.\nWhat Tennyson expressed in verse, science tells tersely in\nprose. \" The body first of all gives to self a certain measure\nof individuality, permanence and inwardness.\" 1\nThe conviction of self then is a resultant of experience : a\nconviction due to continuous presentations. Our sense of per-\nsonality is in fact a growth, and as a growth it carries with\nit a history, and as a growth it may carry with it some\nprophecy also ; for all things which grow pass through stages\n1\nDr. James Ward, Encycl. Brit. Article \"Psychology,\" p. 84a.\n\f12 Right Rev. Bishop W. Boyd Carpenter. [part\nin other words, they possess folded up within themselves\nthe records of the past and the preparations for the future :\nthe blossom is the product of months of growth : it is also the\nharbinger of fuller and richer developments.\nIt is perhaps well to consider this aspect of selfhood. We\nare so ready to limit ourselves by the Here and Now that\nwe may lose sight of the truth that if we are beings we\nare also \" becomings \" : our days glide on and we step from\nstage to stage of self-realization, and just as there was an epoch\nwhen we were without ability to realize ourselves or to express\nourselves, so it may well be that our self-realization is as yet\nincomplete, just as we painfully know that our powers of self-\nexpression are woefully defective : we are growths, not only in\nthe sense that we have each individually grown, nor in the\nsense that the race has grown through aeons of change, but\nthat we also are upon the platform of growth, holding within\nourselves a vast and unexplored inheritance of past experiences\nand the potentialities of further developments\u2014when self-\nrealization will be yet more vivid : when possessed of a self more\nfully identified, and also, perchance, endowed with a vehicle of\nexpression more plastic and responsive than present physical\nconditions can allow, we shall be able to give fuller and nobler\nexpression to the speechless aspirations of our nature. We are\nbut creatures in process of formation : we know not what we\nshall be : we scarcely even know what we are. The mystery\nwhich hangs around those wonderful convictions which we\ndescribe as Self\u2014Personality\u2014the Ego\u2014the Soul\u2014is largely due,\nas it seems to me, to the fact that our present life, like our\nante-natal life, is embryonic as compared with that towards\nwhich we are tending. We are like people called upon to\nreport upon machine while it is going : we are at a dis-\nadvantage, for we want to stop it to understand how it goes.\nBut even this illustration is quite inadequate, for a machine which\nis working is not subject to growth : in its case it is rapidity\nof movement only which thwarts our examination of it, but in\nregard to ourselves and our own selfhood, we are dealing with\nnot a finished machine, but a complex organization which is still\nin process of development.\nThis strange self then we cannot, with Hume, describe as\na philosophical fiction : we may call it, with Dr. Ward, a\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 13\nproduct of thought or an idea of the reason, but we do not\ntherefore deem it an unreality, it reveals itself too vividly for\nthat : it possesses what we may call cross-currents\u2014an ebb\nand flow of the tides of selfhood. Self does not always give\nus the same self-interpretations or presentations. So marked\nare the differences of presentations that the self was split up\nby some : and we heard much of dual personality\u2014or of a\nsoul which is over and separate from the soul which is under.\nThe theory of an over soul\n1\nhas had fascination for many\nminds : its existence was postulated to explain some phenomena\nor experiences which could not be explained (so it seemed) by\nthe ordinary action of the conscious mind. Here we need to\nbe cautious in words lest we should appear to divide what, by\nits very nature, must be one and indivisible.\nThe soul is individual : this seems to be the final word of\nhuman thought on the matter : to think otherwise is to lose\nhold of all anchorage for thought. I may be told that science\nhas been obliged to abandon her faith that atoms were indi-\nvisible, and that now she is committed to a perpetual bull by\nenlarging upon the marvellous subdivisions which subsist in the\nindivisible thing called an atom. But the cases are different\nthe physical atom could be treated, examined, analyzed till its\nelusive elements were compelled to disclose themselves ; but the\nself cannot be so dealt with, and we might as well abandon all\ninquiry as admit that essentially the self was other than indi-\nvidual. Were it so, there would be no reason for revulsion\nof feeling when alienist experiences were brought to our notice.\nWe must, I think, postulate the individuality of the soul or\nself if we are to study its activities, conditions and moods,\nwith any hope of advantage. It is well, therefore, to avoid\nany language which implies a duality or multiplicity in self.\nWe need, however, words or phrases to distinguish between the\ndifferent aspects in which the self or soul manifests its energy.\n1\nCompare Dante's words,\n\"Whenever by delight or else by pain,\nThat seizes any faculty of ours,\nWholly to that the soul collects itself,\nIt seemeth that no other power it heeds ;\nAnd this against that error is which thinketh\nOne soul above another kindles in us.''\nPurgatorio, iv. 1 -6.\n\f14 Rigid Rev. BisJiojo W. Boyd Carpenter. [part\nMr. Myers chose a word which avoided the suggestion of any\ndualism. The subliminal self was not another self but the\nsame self working in other conditions : this subliminal self or\nsubconscious self has made its footing too good in human ex-\nperience to be treated as an unreality or a delusion. Fechner,\nif I mistake not, suggested a similar thought when he spoke\nof consciousness being present and awake when the psycho-\nphysical activity was raised beyond the degree which we call\nthe threshold (On Life after Death, p. 78 n.) I am not careful\nor anxious about the word by which we describe it, but of the\nfact that the self sometimes acts with conscious effort and at\nother times with unobserved effort there can, I think, be no doubt.\nBut there does not seem to me to be any need to set up an\narcanum of ideas or a Valhalla of strange potentialities in order\nto account for facts which are deeply interesting and at times\nmysteriously so, but which, if I mistake not, fall within the\nrealm of what I may call psychical order.\nWe are beings still in a state of growth ; and the tendency\nof this growth seems to be, not towards a multiple personality,\nbut towards completed individuality. Growth in capacity takes\nplace through repeated effort, and through such experiences\ncomes true and full self-realization.\nMan's inheritance through the past is never thrown away\nit must enter into the education\u2014or, if you prefer the words,\nthe formation of the conditions\u2014of his nature. But all this\nantecedent growth bears the mark of struggle : at every stage\nof the evolutionary process the marks of conflict, i.e. of effort,\nwere to be seen, and though now these records slumber as it\nwere in our nature there was a time when their tale was one\nof continued struggle. The truth, as it seems to me, is that\nthe condition of progress or growth is this, that conscious effort\nis continuously being transformed into unconscious capacity.\nLet me ask your experience on this point. We are sensible,\nof course, of our conscious efforts, because the very conscious-\nness of any effort serves to impress us. But effort, though it\nis a witness of energy, is not the evidence of accpuired capacity:\nit is only a step towards it. In this sense it may be said\nthat our conscious efforts are not manifestations of our real\npower, but rather of our capacity to gain it. Conscious efforts\nare only means for the storage of power : they are needful, for\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 15\nwithout them the accumulation of power would, cease. The\nenergy once seen in vegetable growth has been transformed\ninto the quiescent energy which sleeps in our coal seams. Or\nto carry the illustration a step further, our conscious efforts\nare like the coaling of the ship : they will become power as\ncoal does when once the furnaces are kindled and the steam\nis generated. Our conscious efforts are supplying the fuel for\nfurther activities, but the larger number of these activities will\nbe carried on without conscious exertion. The man who has\npractised at the wicket, taking careful lessons from the pro-\nfessional cricketer, is making keenly conscious effort when he\ngives thought and attention carefully to carry out the instruc-\ntions of the professional, but the final measure of his skill as\na cricketer is when he can play the ball with such an unerring\ninstinct that he is no longer conscious of any mental effort in\ndetermining how to play it. This is an example of conscious\neffort being slowly transformed into unconscious power. Illus-\ntrations might be multiplied, but it remains true that the\nskilled billiard player, the efficient soldier, the successful actor,\nthe popular singer, only reach their highest when a very large\npart of their task is discharged without painful, conscious or\nmental effort. We only do things well when we don't know\nhow we do them ; but the process by which such skill is\nreached is through continuous exercise of conscious effort.\nAction in the hour of necessity must be the resultant of in-\nstinctive skill, i.e. power used without consciousness of effort.\nThe good billiard player shows power without calculated effort\nhis power is the resultant of many conscious and calculated\nefforts, but for him the calculated effort is no longer needful.\nConscious effort has been translated into unconscious power.\nHe has but to will and the trained capacity answers to his\nwill.\nOur conscious powers are at work when we read, or when we\nthink out a problem ; for then we are acting like accumulators :\nwe are storing up material for use or action. In acquisitive\nwork we use conscious effort. In creative work of the highest\norder such a sense of conscious effort would be fatal to the\nhighest results.

There is no painful consciousness of efforts : there\nis no smell of the lamp on such work as this : it is ready,\nspontaneous, springing out of the necessity of nature : it is the\nsplendid manifestation of great stores of power so happily stored\nthat they are immediately available.\nThe unconscious power is the resultant of conscious effort\nconscious effort has stored up somehow and somewhere the\nstores from which capacity derives her skill. There are numbers\nof unrecognized powers at work in the average man, of whose\nexistence he is hardly aware and whose genesis he could scarcely\ntrace. Is it not admitted that when dealing with our fellow-\nmen, we come across unexpected barriers of taste, feeling,\nprejudice? Convictions and judgments, standards of conduct and\nbearing have been acquired from early training. Precept and\nexample, often repeated and enforced, have accumulated in\nman's nature forces which are now unconsciously operative\nthroughout the whole range of his life. In dealing with any\nfresh matter, he will meet it with the force of a number of\nlong-stored conditions : his judgment on a new question will\ndepend upon what has been described as his entire psycho-\nstatical conditions, his nature and stock of ideas, or, in other\nwords, his character, habits, memory, education, previous ex-\nperience and momentary mood. Does the average man deal\nwith any new subject on the basis of pure logic ? It is not\nhis reasoning faculty only which he calls into the judgment\nseat : the whole mass of inherited experiences hurry to the\nassize and resolve to be, if not judge, at least jury in the case.\n\"There is,\" says Professor James {Psychology, p. 327), \"an\neverlasting struggle in every mind between the tendency to\nkeep unchanged, and the tendency to renovate its ideas.\"\nDoes not this mean that when we approach a new experience\nwe feel divided in mind, doubting, wishing to examine and\nyet feeling that it is valueless unless we can bring it into\nautomatic relationship with our previous stock of thought.\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 17\nOur conscious efforts are challenged by the new thing, but we\nfeel the necessity of transferring it into the storehouse of personal\npowers or capacity. In other words, we are always seeking\nmental food, and always feeling that the only value of it is\nfound when it is translated into some kind of personal\nenergy.\nOnly when this personal energy is set free from the anxiety\nof conscious exertion can it be said to have reached perfection.\nAll the experiences of life, the solicitudes which have been\nour portion, the pressure of responsibility, the weight of sorrow,\nthe fatigue of effort, all have been of the nature of conscious\nexertions, and therefore have contributed to the storehouse of\npowers which can be used in effortless manner later on. The\nquiet sympathy which the sorrowful life has created no less\nthan the ready intellect which works easily, is an instance of\nconscious effort transformed into unconscious power.\nHence there is being slowly formed in man\u2014through repeated\nconscious efforts\u2014an inheritance of powers and capacities which\ncan work without the sense of strenuous effort. All the\nexperiences of life's continuous struggle are contributing to\nthe endowment of man with new powers. Is it then difficult\nto suppose that among the accumulated powers of man there\nmay be resident capacities which can come into play without\nconscious effort ? The range of automatic powers increases with\nour development. Continually the conscious effort passes over\nto man's nature a fresh heritage of automatic power\u2014which\nenriches his personality and contributes even more and more\nto his self-realization. He is only free in the exercise of self\nwhen he can achieve without the servitude of continuous\neffort.\nThis constant transference of effort into power is building\nup personality : it is enlarging the realm of self. All Nature's\nmethod is in the direction of building up into an intelligible\nunity\u2014not in the direction of dislocating powers : her policy\nis continuous unification, not separation ; and as she follows it,\nthe range of powers which are bestowed upon man increases\nand it would not be strange if new capacities were thus brought\nwithin the sovereignty of his soul, and with the increase of new\ncapacities enjoyed by countless individualities new phenomena\nmight spring into notice.

As an inscription in some unknown\ncharacter is dug up among the ruins of some ancient shrine,\nso there may come to us some undecipherable expression of\nfacts or methods of life which belong to a past which has gone\nout of human recollection. \" Every element in an experience\nis correlated with some alteration in the nervous system, '\nand\nwe must infer that some kind of residue or impression, chemical\nor physical, is left in the neurones in consequence of which\nthey have a disposition to reproduce, when again stimulated, the\noriginal experience, whether an idea or physiological reaction.'\" 1\nWithout being materialists we must surely admit that whatever\nis built up with our bodily framework must constitute a part\nof our life's equipment, and may tend to become a suggestive\nfactor in our activities.

In a sense\ndifferent from that of the ancient writer, God has set the\nworld, as it were, in our heart. Is it surprising then that at\ntimes glimpses of the past should show themselves ? May not\nthe unexpected phenomena of human life sometimes find their\nexplanation in the coming to the surface of some ancient\nstratum of experience? As an earth -shock may thrust up\nsome rock which tells us the story of earlier earth movements,\nmay not some startling event in life call into activity some\nlong buried aptitude of our slowly built nature ? There may,\nindeed, be stored within us forces which some strange experi-\nence may vivify and liberate. The explanation of some strange\ncapacities of our nature may be locked up in the bosom of\nthe past.\nAre not some of the phenomena which demand investigation\nprobably due to the activities of obsolescent organs, or of\ncapacities which have been weakened but not wholly suppressed\nin the process of civilization ? May we not in this way\naccount for the power which some show in the use of the\nDivining Kod ? Does not the instinct which warns animals of\nthe approach of the storm or the impending earthquake find\nits counterpart in human beings ? and do not both find their\nexplanation in the experiences which from the past are still\nstored up in the very physical framework which man and\nanimals inherit ? It is no part of wisdom to laugh at the\nexpression or manifestation of instincts, whose existence is\nderived from and throws light back upon the story of develop-\ning life. When the seafaring man declares that he is warned\nof the proximity of ice by his sense of smell, it seems to be\nno mark of intelligence to ridicule the suggestion. Inquiry is\nwiser than ridicule. It does not seem to me passing strange\nthat in the vast community of mankind there should be found\nscattered individuals in whom the relics of past instincts are\nstill strong enough to be factors serviceable in life as we\nknow it.\nBut if we are beings still in the making, is it beyond the\n\f20 Right Rev.

In the\nsacred casket wherein the dawning life lies enshrined there is\nwritten not only the story of the past, but the anticipations\nof the future. Nature is beforehand with her work. Judged\nby present necessities, we find organs provided which serve\nno purpose. In the secluded existence where light does not\nshine, eyes can fulfil no function : within those closed doors,\nshut out from the converse of men, ears have no exercise\nyet in that dim life shut off from sunshine and the song of\nbirds, organs of sight and sound, of taste and smell are to be\nfound.

Is it impossible to suppose that the\ngrowing forces, which beneath the surface are being prepared\nfor the wider life of the hereafter, may make themselves felt\nin ways which are not those of commonplace life ? May not\nsome phenomena, which we cannot classify according to normal\nusage, be the dawning activity of powers and capacities which will\nunly be fully ours hereafter ? The stirrings of such capacities\nare but the movement of forces, which are real, but whose\nmeaning and purpose cannot be fully understood till the con-\nditions have arisen which make these activities natural and\nintelligible. For the present, therefore, any manifestation of\nthese growing powers must be reckoned as super-normal.\n\fLXV.] Presidential Address. 21\nBriefly, if we are beings in process of formation, movements\nmay be expected which presage future conditions as well as\nthose which bear witness to conditions which are passing away.\nAs becomings, the mark of what has been, as well as of that\nwhich will be, may now and then rise to the surface.

Only then will the new\nself emerge from the discipline and formative influences of our\npresent life ; and that new self will be endowed with powers\nand capacities, which will be great or small, mean or\nnoble, according to our habits here, but which will be fitted at\nleast for use and service in the life in which the natural has\ngiven place to the spiritual.\nThe suggestions which I have ventured to make will indicate\nthe line which I think the work of our Society ought to\npursue. While being strictly vigilant against fallacious represen-\ntations of phenomena, vigorous in examining all facts and\ncircumstances brought to notice, it ought to hold a mind open\nenough to welcome hints and helps from every quarter : it\nought to be as stern in rejecting what is irrelevant as it should\nbe keen to perceive the importance which may lurk in what is\ninsignificant. \" Though truths in manhood darkly join,\" we are\nnone the less entitled to search out such truths and brino;\nthem to light : and in this search we shall render to the body\nthat which is the body's and to the soul that which is the\nsoul's. We shall be just and even-handed, to rob neither our\nphysical nor our spiritual nature of its due, but we shall\nrecognize that in a being compact of body, soul and spirit, the\nresultant of long ages of growth and development, powers and\ncapacities may be lodged which are not always explicable by\npresent knowledge ; we shall be awake, therefore, to mark those\neffects which show the working of interacting human powers.\n\f22 Right Rev.

Their main interest con-\nsists in their variety and their frequency during a particular\nperiod. In all the cases, my daughter or I was concerned,\nbut where cross-correspondences were produced, our scripts were\nnot always in the same relation to one another, sometimes one\nand sometimes the other appearing to take the initiative. Nor\nwas the automatism always of the same kind ; besides automatic\nscript we employed the method of table-tilting by two persons.\nThe experiments seem to have resulted in the production not\nonly of cross-correspondences, but of statements, subsequently\nverified, about events unknown to the automatists.\nI have narrated the four incidents in their chronological\nsequence, appending a short general discussion of the inferences\nwhich may be drawn as to their origin.\nI.

Diana is at once\na patroness of parting ways cross-ways\u2014and the protector of\nyoung animals. A third aspect of the same goddess is intro-\nduced by the watching moon. So that a subsidiary idea\nrunning through the earlier part of the script is \" Diana.\"\nThis of course I noticed at the time, and I supposed it to\nrefer to Mrs. Forbes, whose Christian name, Diana, has been\nreferred to more than once in my earlier script.\n1\nAccordingly,\nat my next opportunity, at the end of August, when Mrs.\nForbes was staying with me, I asked her what she had been\ndoing in the middle of July. She had been staying with a\nfriend in the middle of the Yorkshire moors.\n2\nShe told me\nthat between July 1 and the middle of the month there was\na great sheep-shearing going on all around her, fifteen hundred\nsheep sheared, great bleating and calling of ewes to lambs,\nand much fear lest the lambs should be separated from the\newes.\nIt thus appears that there was some reason for the con-\nnexion in the script of Mrs. Forbes's name with a description\nof shepherds driving their flocks, of the call resounding from\nhill to hill, and of the invocation to the goddess Diana, pro-\ntector of young animals, to bring home in safety ewes and\nlambs. I had myself never been in the North of England in\nJuly or in any summer month, and had no idea that the\nallusion to ewes and lambs could be in any way appropriate\nat so late a season of the year.\nBut there is, I think, another, and perhaps more definite,\nlink of connexion in this script with Mrs. Forbes. Mrs.\nForbes sketches, and her sketch-book often serves as a sort of\ndiary of her occupations and interests. When she came to\nstay with me at the end of August she showed me her sketches\nmade during July, 1907, and before I had said anything about\nthe script of July 17 she drew my attention to a sketch\n1\nCf. Proc. Vol. XX., p. 222.\nThis I learnt first from a letter received on July 30, 1907.\n\f28 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.

So that on the very day on which my\nscript had made reference to Diana and the moon, Mrs. Forbes\nhad made a sketch of a crescent moon, amid surroundings of\nthe type described in the script.\nIt will be noted that the moon of the script does not\nsuggest, though it does not exclude, a crescent moon ; the\npicture suggested by the word \" watching \" is that of a moon\nfull, or nearly so, at any rate of a moon at night, not of a\ncrescent moon at sunset. This point is of some interest in\nview of the sequel.\nSo far then for the veridical contents of this script, as sub-\nsequently ascertained. I pass on to my next script, also written\nduring my absence from home. It is as follows :\nM. V. July 20, 1907. 11 p.m.\nVenditor spernit agrum pulchellum sed emptor invenietur\nqui thesauros conditos in medium proferat. Audi et tu.\n1\nBonaventura is the name and then write Desiderio. Desi-\nderium semper pro amico\u2014pone desiderium. spes et fides sorores\nillae inter se coniunctae amicum tibi reddere praevalent. 2\n0\ndeath where is thy sting 1 Beyond our darkness there is light.\nThe impenetrable seeming gloom is full of light. Look light\nwards listen to the rippling sound of the long light waves\nbreaking on the beach.\nTell Helen I said so lately quite lately \u2014she will under-\nstand. . . .\n3\nThe opening paragraph of this script may be taken as a\nsymbolic indication that it is not such nonsense as the auto-\nmatist supposes, but will some day be found to have a point.\nPossibly that point is contained in the next word, \" Bona-\nventura.\" This conveyed nothing to me at the time, but in\nFebruary, 1911, Mr. Piddington drew my attention to two\n1 \" The seller despises the pretty bit of land, but a buyer will be found to\nbring forward into our midst its hidden treasures. Do you too hearken.\"\n2 \" Longing [there is] always for a friend ;\nlay aside longing. Hope and Faith,\nthose sisters, joined together, have power to restore to you your friend.\"\n3\nThe sentences omitted refer to personal matters.\n\fLXV.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 29\nfacts: (1) that Bonaventura is the Franciscan who in Dante's\nParadiso (Par. XII. 28 ff.) pronounces a eulogy on Dominic,\nand (2) that the preceding M. V. script of July 14\u2014already\nseen to be connected with the script of July 20 by its references\nto \" lightening darkness,\" etc.\u2014alludes to the Dominicans.\nMr. Piddington further suqoested that a reason for the intro-\nduction of Dominic's Order into the script of July 14\u2014the\nscript which emphasises the word Dream\u2014may be found in\nthe prophetic dreams which legend associates with St. Dominic,\nand the founding of that Order. These prophetic dreams are\nmentioned by Bonaventura in close connexion with his name ;\n\" la donna . . .\nvide nel sonno il mirabile frutto\nch'uscir dovea di lui e delle rede\ne perche fosse, quale era, in costrutto,\nquinci si mosse spirito a nomarlo\ndel possessivo di cui era tutto.\nDomenico fu detto.\" (11. 64-70.)\nThe details of the dreams, not mentioned by Dante, are as\nfollows :\nDominic's mother, before his birth, dreamt that she bore a\nblack and white dog (canis) with a lighted torch in his mouth :\nwhile his godmother dreamt that on his brow was a star that\nilluminated the world : or, according to another version, on his\nbrow and on the back of his head were two stars which lighted\nthe East and the West.\nIf, as seems probable, the words in the script of July 20,\n\" Bonaventura is the name,\" point to a reminiscence of Dante's\nParadiso, the form taken by the simile in the introductory\nsymbolism may be determined in the same way. For Bonaven-\ntura, immediately after naming Dominic, describes him as a\nhusbandman or cultivator of land\nla sua mente . . . nella madre\nlei fece profeta. (11. 58, 59);\n\" ed io ne parlo\nsi come dell' agricola,\" (11. 70, 71.)\nand a similar comparison recurs several times in the following\nlines. Thus he is set \"to go round the vineyard,\" \"to fight\n\f30 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nfor that seed wherefrom \" grew the Order, and from him came\nthe streams \" whereby the Catholic orchard is watered.\"\n1\nI have read the Paradiso more than once, though I am not\nso familiar with it as with other parts of the Divina Commedia.\nBut the word Bonaventura did not recall this passage to me,\nthough I of course recognised an allusion to the Dominicans, in\nthe Domini canes of July 14. I had no recollection, however,\nof any prophetic dreams in connexion with Dominic, never\nhaving taken any interest in either hagiology in general or\nDominic in particular.\nIn consequence of the directions in the script of July 20,\non my return home on July 22, I asked my daughter if she\nhad lately been writing automatically, and heard that she had\nnot tried for script since the end of June, 1907. On July 23,\nI read her the above-quoted M. V. script of July 20, and she\nbegan again to write automatically, and continued writing pretty\nregularly for a month or two.\nTwo of her scripts seemed to me when 1 saw them on\nAug. 1, 1907, to present points of contact with my scripts\nof July 14 and 17, which were not known to her. The points\nare as follows\nH. V. Jul,, 25, 1907. 10.30 p.m.\n. . . The only road is by the freedom of thought which belongs\nto those who are born free.\nThis recalls the \" keep your thoughts free \" of my script.\nThe point is a small one, and would be hardly worth noting\nif it stood alone. But taken in conjunction with a passaga\nin the next following H. V. script, it suggests a supernormal\nconnexion with the M. V. script.\nH. V. July 26, 1907. 10.15 p.m.\n. . . The eye of fate is never closed, it watches even in the\nblackest darkness.\nPer tenebras ad lumen,2\nthe casement slowly grows a glimmer-\ning square. 3\n1\nThe same idea is found in the Golden Legend, where Dominic is called the\n\"keeper of the vineyard or the flock of our Lord.\"\n2 \" Through darkness to the light.\" \"'Tennyson, Tears, idle tear*.\n\flxv.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 31\nThe Latin words reinforce the idea which had emerged in\nmy script of July 14, \"the lightening darkness of your night,\"\nwhile the quotation from Tennyson closely reproduces the next\nsentence in that script, \" the growing whiteness of the dawn,\"\nthe line in question being part of a description of the approach\nof dawn in the chamber of death :\nAh, sad and strange, as in dark summer dawns\nThe earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square.\nIt is true that the general idea of light beyond darkness\nwas suggested to my daughter by my script of July 20, which\nI had read to her, but 1 think that there is evidence of super-\nnormal knowledge of the M. V. scripts of July 14 and July 17\n(which had not been read to the automatist) for two reasons:\n(1) the selection (on July 26) of a quotation which is at\nonce closely parallel to a sentence in the script of July 14\n\" the growing whiteness \"\n\u2014and contains an implicit allusion to\nthe word emphasised in the script of July 17, \"Dawn\";\n(2) the introduction (on July 25) of a sentence\u2014\" the thoughts\nof the free \"\u2014recalling a similar sentence in the script of\nJuly 17.\nIt looks, in fact, as if the automatist's normally obtained\nknowledge of the M. V. script of July 20 had stimulated the\nproduction of evidence of supernormal knowledge of earlier M. V.\nscript, and it is even possible that some such stimulus was\nnecessary. It will be noted that the M. V. script which con-\ntained a message to be conveyed to my daughter did not\nintroduce either of the emphasised words \" Dream \" or \" Dawn,\"\nthough if the above-suggested interpretation of Bonaventura be\nadmitted, it implicitly alluded to both those topics.\nMy next script was obtained on the morning of July 30; it\ncarries on or supplements the previous script of July 17 ;\nthus:\nM. V. July 30, 1907. 10.50 a.m.\nTeucro duce et auspice Teucro. 1\nRectorem post ponis quern omnium Directorem adposui. Fac\nauscultes.\n1\nHor. C.

But as the name Diana had been symbolised\nin earlier scripts by a crescent moon, the emergence of the\ncrescent in this script may be accounted for\u2014or at least may\nhave been helped\u2014by my having received a letter from Mrs.\nForbes on the morning of July 30. I did not at the time,\nhowever, connect the crescent moon of my script with her.\nI noted at the time the references in the script to Blake's\ndrawing, Hugo's poem, and the passage from the opening of the\nEighth JEneid. In Hugo's poem, Booz Endormi, in the first\nvolume of La LSgende des Sticks, Ruth is described as lying\nj,wake watching the moon amid the stars, and wondering\nQuel dieu, quel moissonneur de l'eternel ete,\nAvait, en s'en allant, negligemment jete\nCette faucille d'or dans le champ des etoiles.\nMany years ago Mr. Myers in conversation, after a good deal\nof adverse criticism of Hugo's poetry, had expressed admiration\nof this poem, and in particular of the simile of the \" sickle\nin its context. ISTo evidential value therefore attaches to this\nallusion in the script.\nThe same idea of a person lying awake at night with eyes\nopen is suggested in what the script calls the \" opening passage\nof the Aeneid \"\n\u2014meaning, as I noted at the time, the opening\nof the Eighth Book, where the wandering thoughts of the\nwakeful iEneas are compared with the glancing reflexions on\na metal bowl of water made by sunlight or \" the image of the\nshining moon,\" which flit to and fro and strike upon the painted\nceiling.\n1\nThe script, then, of July 30, reinforces the moon, mentioned\nin an earlier script, making it a crescent moon and introduces\nHugo's poem.\n1\nJEneid, VIII., 1. 18 ff. During the sleep which follows these thoughts,\n^Eneas is visited in dream by the river Tiber, and waking, as the god departs,\nsees the \"rising light of the sun in heaven.\" So that this Virgilian passage\ncombines with a simile introducing the moon the two ideas of Dream and\nDawn. Possibly the first hint of a reference to this passage is to be found\nin the \" Mons Albanus \" of July 14. For the purpose of the dream is to\nannounce to JEneas the approach of the \"omen\" which is to set a limit to\nhis wanderings and determine the name of the long white city, Alba Longa,\nwhich his son shall found upon the slopes of the Alban Mount.\nC\n\f34 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nThe automatic writing next to be considered involves two\nautomatists, being produced not in script but by table-tilting\non the part of my daughter and Mr. Bayfield. He and she\nhave table-tilted on several previous occasions and produced\nresults, some of which have been reported to this Society and\npublished in the Journal.1\nTheir first sitting at this time was\non July 29, 1907, at 6 p.m.\u2014the day before the above-described\nscript.\nOn July 29, after some rubbish of a kind only too familiar\nto us all, just before leaving off, Mr. Bayfield suggested that\n\" something evidential about some one \" should be \u00abiven on the\nnext occasion. To this the table assented. Mr. Bayfield asked\nif it would be \" about Piddington,\" but the table said \" No.\"\nHe then said \" suggest something,\" and the table replied \" Mrs.\nForbes.\" Accordingly, on the next occasion this subject was\nintroduced as follows\nJuly 30, 1907. 6 p.m. M. A. B. and H. de G. V. (M. de\nG. V. taking notes.)\n(M.A.B. What about Mrs. Forbes?)\nTorquay, she is there 2\nwith her mother ask her\nabout the letter she wrote yesterday.\nI was present, taking notes, as I had been on July 29,\nbut I did not touch the table. I had received, as I have said\nabove, a letter from Mrs. Forbes on this very morning of\nJuly 30, but had said nothing of it to either automatist.\nThe table's spontaneous selection on July 29 of Mrs. Forbes\nas the subject of a verifiable communication was recalled to\nme when I received a letter from her on July 30, and I\nawaited with interest the tilting of that day. It seems as\nthough this interest of mine, and this only, were so far\nreflected by the table. The information that Mrs. Forbes was\nat Torquay 3\nwas incorrect. Her letter announced that she\nwas in the North and about to join her mother in Surrey on\nAug. 1. But it was appropriate to say, \" Ask her about the\nletter she wrote yesterday.\"\n1\nSee, for instance, S.P.R. Journal for March, 1907.\n2\nThe represents a pause in the tilting of the table.\n3\nSo far as I know, there is no association between Mrs. Forbes and Torquay.\n\flxv.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 35\nThere followed a very short attempt to give the contents of\nthe letter, which was incorrect. The table then passed away\nfrom this subject to its familiar pretence to give verifiable names\nand incidents. Then, after a considerable pause, the following\noccurred\nJuly 30, 1907. M.A.B. and H. dc G. V.\n(M. A. B. Give us anything you like of value.)\nPour etre grand il suffit de connaitre ce qu'on veut. Hugo.\n(M. A. B. Where is the quotation ?)\nNotre Dame.1\n{M.A.B.

What is the connexion?)\nI don't know.\nHere I told the automatists that Hugo had been referred\nto in my script of that morning, but that their allusion was\nnot the same, my script referring to a poem, whereas the\ntable had given a prose sentence. I did not at this time see\nany point in the statement that the phrase from Hugo had a con-\nnexion with Mrs. Forbes. Instructions were given to the table\nto think things over and to explain further its point about\nHugo. We waited three or four minutes, and then the tilting\nwas resumed.\nA dream of life comes in poem a dream.\n(H. de G. V. Give it in French.)\nLa vie est breve.\nI here recognised the first line of a verse very familiar to\nme, and quoted the whole verse, saying it was not the\nquotation in my script.\nLa vie est breve\nUn peu d'espoir\nUn peu de reve\nEt puis bonsoir.\n1\nThe accuracy of this statement has not been tested.\n\f36 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nI was at the time under the mistaken impression that this\nverse was by Victor Hugo.1\nThe tilting was then resumed.\n(M. A. B. Why did the script [i.e. the M.

I comment on\nthe preceding extracts before going on to describe the next\nday's table-tilting.\n\" A dream of life,\" followed as it was by the line \" La\nvie est breve,\" seemed at the time to me to have no con-\nnexion with the poem, Booz Endormi, referred to in my script,\nand certainly had no application to the actual verse there\nalluded to\u2014the simile of the crescent moon. But as a\nmatter of fact in V. Hugo's poem, Booz has a dream, a pro-\nphetic dream, foretelling that he will have a long race of\nillustrious descendants, he being at the time a childless\nwidower. So that \" a dream 2\ndoes \" come \" in the poem,\nand \" a dream of life \" is a not inappropriate description of\nthat dream. The dream, called a \" Songe,\" is thus introduced :\nOr, la porte du ciel s'etant entre-baillee\nAu-dessus de sa tete, un songe en descendit\nEt ce songe etait tel que Booz vit un chene. . . .\nLater in the poem the word \" reve \" is used\nAinsi parlait Booz dans le reve et l'extase.\nThe statements following upon the quotation, \" La vie est\n1\nThe poem of which this verse is part was subsequently the subject of a\ncross-correspondence between the Mac script and my daughter's script, as\nrelated in Proc. Vol. XXIV., p. 297, and Vol. XXV., pp. 320-334.\n2\nThe poem is divided into four parts, containing respectively 6, 2, 7 and 7\nstanzas. The dream occupies the 7 stanzas of the third part.\n\fLXV.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 37\nbreve,\" call for no comment ; in so far as they are correct,\nthey are not beyond a guess on the part of the automatists.\nAssociation of thought with the preceding \" luna ipsa crescens\n\"\nmay certainly account for the introduction in M. V. script of\nthe allusion to Hugo's poem ; Mr. Myers did express his\nadmiration of Hugo's simile in conversation,\n1\nand the speakers\nwere Mr. Myers and myself. But neither of the two concluding\nstatements are correct answers to the questions put, though\nthey are perhaps not wholly irrelevant contributions to the\nsubject in general ; there is a certain resemblance between\n\" expressed the thought best \" and \" the only simile that I\nlike,\" and, as said above, the word rive is contained in the\npoem, though not in the script.\nBefore the next table-tilting I read over the poem of Hugo,\nand removed it from the bookshelf, so that no one else\nshould read it. I now saw what was meant by the associa-\ntion between Hugo and Mrs. Forbes in the table-tilting\n\u2014\" came\nto me when I was thinking of Mrs. Forbes.\" A similar asso-\nciation was shown in my own script, which combined the\ncrescent moon and Hugo by a reference to Hugo's simile,\ncomparing the moon to a sickle forgotten in the harvest field.\nThe crescent moon, as I now realised, had occurred more than\nonce in my earlier script as a symbol of Mrs. Forbes\nan allusion to her Christian name, Diana. Thus on Decem-\nber 5, 1901, after a message from Talbot Forbes, came the\nwords\nThe tufted wheat and golden sickle not to cut, 2\nclearly a reference to the crescent moon, and possibly to this\nvery poem.\nAt this stage, then, of the experiment I realised :\n(1) that the table chose Mrs. Forbes as the subject of an\nexperiment of evidential value on July 29, the day on which\nshe wrote to me\n(2) that my script, produced after receiving her letter on\n1\nNot however, as Mr. Bayfield's question suggested, in a conversation\nbetween two people, but in a discussion on Hugo's literary merits, at a French\nconversation class in my house, where Mr. Myers and I represented respectively\nthe critical and the commendatory view of Victor Hugo's work.\n2\nSee Proc.

We commented laughingly\non the table's exemplification of its first remark, concerning the\nadaptation of sound to sense, by its own methods of tilting\nextreme gloom and slowness during the remarks about darkness,\nfollowed by great vivacity when the break of day was announced.]\n(a) It is characteristic of Hugo's poetry, with which both\nautomatists were acquainted, though neither was familiar,\n1\nthat\nthe sound should be expressive of the thought. The next words\ntilted out ought to imply that this characteristic is exemplified\nin a line containing the thought of falling and the word tombe.\nThis I believe to be the case. When I re-read the poem\nwith care for the purposes of this paper, I noticed that there\nis a line in which comes the idea of falling and the word\ntombe, and that this line is metrically arranged to express the\nthought by the sound. It has the four regular accents on the\n3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th syllables of the Alexandrine, and moreover\nthe punctuation and breaks between the words emphasise those\naccents. A line of this kind is not common in French versifi-\ncation,2\nand among the eighty-eight lines of this poem of Hugo's\nthere is no other in which this particular rhythmical effect is\nobtained. The line runs :\nJe suis ve'uf, |\nje suis se'ul, |\net sur moi |\nle soir tombe. |\nThe next words, de sou altessc iufini, are apparently without\npoint. They may be translated \"from or by his infinite\n*I subsequently ascertained that neither of them had read the Legende des\nSiedes. I am myself very familiar with a good deal of Hugo's poetry, and\nhave lectured on his metrical effects.\n2\nA famous illustration of the effect of this particular rhythm is found in the\ndespairing conclusion of the great dialogue between Chimene and Rodrigue m\nCorneille's Le Cid :\n(\nQue notre heur fut si proche, et si tot se perdit.\n\f40 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nmajesty,\" a phrase which has no bearing upon either poem or\nscript. 1\nPossibly the flow had been interrupted by my\ndaughter's contemptuous remark. Anyhow the table seemed to\nrecognise its incapacity, and after a long pause broke fresh ground.\n(b) The next phrases seem to mark a distinct advance\ntowards describing the poem. The \" look \" regard\u2014is an\nimportant element in the story, as every one will remember.\nRuth obtains Naomi's permission to glean ears \" after him in\nwhose sight\" she should find grace (Ruth ii. 2); Boaz sees her\nin the field, and gives her permission to glean (ii. 6) ; she\nwonders why she has \"found grace in his eyes\" (ii. 10); and\nhopes to\nli\nfind favour in\" his \" sight\" (ii. 13). The sentence\ntilted by the table represents the general idea, not the words,\nof the poem ;\nregard does not occur in the French.\nThe idea, too, of unlighted night,\n\u2014\"je ne demande pas qu'on\nm'eclaire la nuit \"\u2014fits with the description in the poem\nwhich emphasises the darkness all around, with only a crescent\nmoon amid the stars. Ruth is waiting for\non ne sait quel rayon inconnu,\nQuand viendrait du reveil la lumiere subite.\nAgain, the metre of the poem is reproduced in this portion\nof the tilted sentences, which contains two Alexandrine lines\nPourvu que ton regard, ton beau regard, me suit,\nJe ne demande pas qu'on m'eclaire la nuit,\nwhere the rhyme is obtained at a sacrifice of grammatical\naccuracy.\n(e) The next group of words breaks away altogether from\nthe meaning of the poem, which has no allusion to \" horizon\n\"\nor to \" sea.\" These words, in fact, do not make much sense ; a\n\" widening horizon \" and a \" rising sea \" seem unconnected with\n\" deep shadow \" or \" approaching darkness.\" The actual words\nombre and profond, do occur in the poem\nLes astres emaillaient le ciel profond et sombre ;\nLe croisson fin et clair parmi ces fleurs de l'ombre\nBrillait a Poccident.\n1\nIt has been suggested to me that in these words there may be an allusion\nto the godlike reaper\u2014\"quel dieu, quel moissonneur de l'eternel ete\n\"\u2014who had\nleft his sickle in the field of the stars ; or the reader may, if he choose, correct\naltesse ivfini to altitude infinie.\n\fLXV.] A Monties Record of Automatisms. 41\n(d) The final sentence of the script presents a certain\nparallelism with a line in the poem, as well as with the\ngeneral idea. Boaz, meditating over his dream and the dim-\nculty of supposing its fulfilment probable, contrasts his feeling\nwith that of the young, whose dawn comes out of night as\nfrom a victory\nLe jour sort de la nuit comme d'une victoire.\nIt is noticeable that in their attempts\u2014attempts at least\npartially successful\u2014to identify the quotation from Victor Hugo\nalluded to in my script of July 30, 1907, the automatists\nproduced both the words Dream and Dawn, which had been\nemphasised in my earlier scripts of July 14 and July 17.\nand which were known to me, but not to them, when the\nexperiment was made. On July 30, they produced the word\nDream explicitly thrice (once in French) and implicitly once\n(by quoting a line which rhymes to the French word), and\non July 31 the statements terminated with an allusion in\nFrench to the break of day. But they did not produce the\nCrescent Moon, on which my attention was definitely fixed, and\nI therefore at the time regarded the experiment as not very\nsuccessful. It was not till some years later that I recognised\nthat the poem Booz Endormi, to which we had found allusions\nin both sets of writings\u2014the M. V. script and the table-tilting\n\u2014combines the ideas of Dream and Dawn with the well-\nknown emblem of Diana, the crescent moon. For while Booz\nis visited by a prophetic dream, Buth lies waiting for the\ndawn, and gazing at the \" golden sickle \" of the moon.\nOn the conclusion of the table-tilting on July 31, I showed\nthe automatists my script of the preceding day, and my\ndaughter at once said that a drawing somewhat similar to the\ndrawing which terminates that script had occurred in a recent\nscript of hers. She thereupon showed me the script in question,\nwhich I then saw for the first time.\n1\nI quote the whole script\nH. V.

V. script, which preceded by\n19 days the two allusions to Diana (guardian of parting ways,\nprotector of young animals) in M. V. script.\nUnder these circumstances, I think this H. V. script, though\nnot included in the \" Month's Kecord \" described in this paper,\nmust be taken as belonging to the group of cross-correspondences\non Dream, Dawn, Diana.\nOnly one other H.

It appears to me to have a\npossible connexion with the rest of the group, and I therefore\nquote it here :\nAd urbem restitutam ingreditur supplex remanet judicium -\n1\nR.

Pollution.\nIn the interconnexions just described my script appears in\nthe main to have played the part of agent, though it is to be\nnoted that on July 17, in so far as its contents were veridical,\nthey represented an impression received from Mrs. Forbes, who\nmay therefore be regarded as the agent.\nIn the next case my own normal thoughts seem to have\nimpressed themselves upon two automatists, who apparently also\nreceived a veridical impression from another person. These\nautomatists were my daughter and her cousin, Mrs. Riviere.\nOn July 30, 1907, my niece, Mrs. Puviere, came to stay\nwith us in Cambridge ; her husband, a barrister, was expected\nto join us on the afternoon of August 2, but a telegram was\nreceived from him that day saying that he had been kept in\ntown by work and would not arrive till after 10 p.m.\nMy daughter and her cousin have often tried table-tilting\ntogether, and on August 2, at 9.50 p.m., during my absence\n\fLXV.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 45\nfrom the drawing room, they sat down to the table. The\nwords tilted were as follows :\ne fontaine\nI demur to your plea your claim is void\nAt this point, my daughter, who was writing down the\nwords, said that perhaps this referred to Mr. Riviere's cases,\nmeaning the cases which had unexpectedly detained him in\ntown.\nTilting was then resumed, and the words came\nSimpkinson is claimant\nWater rights.\nDuring the tilting of these last words \"water rights,\" I returned\ninto the drawing room, and took notes of the following words,\nwhich were\nPollution steam laundry.\nThe meaning of these last words struck me at once. Just\nbefore leaving the drawing room, after 9.30 p.m., I had read in a\nlocal paper of an outbreak of enteric fever at Fulbourn Asylum,\nnear Cambridge, and of some consecpuent anxiety as to the\nsource of infection and the risk to the Cambridge water supply,\nwhich comes from the Fulbourn district. There is also a steam\nlaundry near Fulbourn. The laundry was not mentioned in\nthe paragraph which I had read, but at the time of an earlier\noutbreak of enteric at Fulbourn I had discussed with a friend\nthe risk of contamination to users of the laundry\u2014of whom I\nwas not one\u2014and it is probable that the news of this second\noutbreak revived in my mind a thought of possible danger from\nthe laundry. I deliberately refrained from mentioning the out-\nbreak of enteric to my daughter or my niece, and noticed as\nI left the room that the paragraph in the paper which I had\nbeen reading on the sofa was not visible.\nBut my precautions were rendered useless by the automatic\nresults. There can be little doubt that the words \" pollution\nsteam laundry \" were the reflexion of my thoughts. The words\nhad no meaning for either automatist. Neither of them knew\nthat there was anywhere any risk of pollution, or that there\nwas any steam laundry near Fulbourn. They had not looked\nat the paper.\n\f40 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nIt appears as if my arrival in the room, while they were tilting\nthe words \" water rights,\" had diverted the automatic utterances\nfrom Mr. Riviere's supposed concerns to mine, and as if the word\n\" water \" served to effect the transition from one subject to the\nother.\nMr. Riviere arrived before anything further was obtained by\ntilting. On being asked what cases had detained him, he replied\nthat he had been engaged in the afternoon of August 2 on a\nwater-rights case. But the name Simpkinson had no meaning\nfor him.\nThere thus appears here to have been an attempt to produce\nveridical matter concerning Mr. Riviere's occupations, though,\nwithout the corroborative force of the sequel, in which my\nthoughts were tapped, we could perhaps not claim more for the\nearlier words than that they were due to a lucky guess. The\nname given, Simpkinson, was, as usual in our experience of\ntable-tilting, meaningless, so that \" water rights \" might have\nbeen a mere shot, though I understand that water-right cases\nare not so common as to give much chance of success to such\na random shot.\nThe idea of water seems to have underlain the whole incident\nthe opening words were \" e fontaine,\" and both the following\nveridical statements concerned water. In this connexion, it is\nworth noting that the name of one of the automatists suggests\nwater, and as E. is the initial of Mr. Riviere's Christian name,\nit is possible that the first words \" e fontaine \" are a symbolic\nreference to him.\nHowever that may be, it is probable that the automatists had\naccess to Mr. Riviere's thoughts, and, I think, indisputable that\nthey tapped thoughts of mine which I had deliberately refrained\nfrom communicating to them.\nIII. Requiescat.\nIn the next case my niece and my daughter\u2014percipients in\nthe last incident\u2014appear to be agents, and the part of the\npercipient is played by my script.\nOn August 1907, my daughter and Mrs. Riviere, table-\ntilting in a room by themselves, obtained the words\nStrew on her roses roses.\n\flxv.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 47\nThese words were described as a quotation. The line being\nfamiliar\u2014it is the first line of a poem of Matthew Arnold's\ncalled Hcquicscat\u2014no evidential value was attached to it by the\nautomatists and no mention was made of its appearance.\nOn August 14, 1 being then in ignorance of what had occurred,\nmy script alluded to the same poem, thus\nM. V. August 14, 1907. 11 p.m.\n. . . Strew on her roses roses In quiet she reposes. Ah\nwould that I did too.\nI want Mrs [Holland] to make the same allusion to Matthew\nArnold's Requiescat . .\nHere then three lines from this poem were given with the\nevident intention that they should form part of a cross-corre-\nspondence. A week later my script concluded with the first\nline of the poem, thus\nM.V. Aug. 21, 1907. 11.15 p.m.\nnot in direct communion but through the mind of another\ndoes the message pass. Henry Sidgwick has his share in the\nwork\u2014which you have not recognised. . .\n. . . Sorrow had done its work. Try to see her grave Strew\non her roses roses.\nOn August 28, 1907, my daughter and I compared our\nscripts, and she then told me of the table-tilting incident. On\nAug. 31, her recollection of this was confirmed by the inde-\npendent written statement of Mrs. Eiviere, who had returned\nto London on August 10, before the first emergence in my script\nof any reference to the poem.\nThe poem is familiar both to my daughter and to me, and\nreferences have subsequently been made to it in both our scripts,\nbut the emergences just described in August, 1907, were the\nfirst appearances, and, especially in view of the numerous inter-\nconnexions between us at this time, it seems that the connexion\nis not accidental.\nThe reason for saying that Mrs. Eiviere and my daughter\n\" appear \" to have acted as agents in this matter is that I\nsubsequently learnt that in the waking-stage of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance of March 13, 1907, a word interpreted by Mr. Piddington\n\f48 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nat the time as \" Kequiescat \" had been uttered, as intended for a\nsubject of cross-correspondence, thus\nFaith hope charity\nI'll give it.\nReseat resquiat.\nIf this is the origin of the emergence of the quotation in the\ntable-tilting, the table-tilters may be regarded not as agents but\nas percipients.\nIV. Announcement of Comet.\nOn August 9 my daughter and Mrs. Eiviere appear to have\nproduced a veridical statement concerning a comet. I quote the\nwhole of the very odd and disjointed remarks obtained by table-\ntilting. Possibly readers of this paper who know more about\ncomets than I do may be able to throw light on some of the\nless intelligible portions. But the opening sentences seem to\nadmit of only one interpretation.\nAugust 9, 1907. 9 p.m. J. R. and H. de G. V. (M. de\nG. V. taking notes.)\nQuite right\n(H. de G. V.

V. after reading above aloud ; Give more about\nthe meteoric sign.)\nis a sign tell Piddington.\n1\nThese ungrammatical Latin hexameters do not admit of accurate translation.\nThey contain words that mean \"a whirl of flames,\" \"pale fire,\" \"inhabitants\nof the sky,\" \"itself a portent whirling something portentous.\"\n\fLXV.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 49\n(M. de G. V. Is there anything more 1)\ntot viridis texit ripas aegyptius amnis caespitibus prae-\nbetque suum sic cuique arigo. 1\n(M. de 0.

Is there any connexion with the meteoric sign\nin these last statements ?)\nyes meteor brings fertility.\nThat the \" meteoric sign in the east at dawn \" is a comet\nis made clear by the Latin words in the immediately following\ndescription, vortex flammarum, \" a whirl of flames,\" torquens\n\" whirling,\" words appropriate to no other meteoric sign.\nThe implication in the concluding remarks seems to be that\nthe comet is not malignant but portends fertility, such as the\nNile brings to Egypt. In that case the word pcdlidus is appro-\npriate, for a red comet seems to have been regarded by the\nancients as specially malignant.3\nThe words \" tell Piddington \" are constantly used when the\naccompanying statement claims to be of evidential value, and\nwere interpreted in that sense on this occasion. In view of\nthe sequel it seems that in this case the intention was to\nproduce not a cross-correspondence with some other automatist,\nbut veridical matter.\nOn August 10, 1907, the morning after the above-described\ntable-tilting, the Times and other morning papers contained\nnotices of a comet. The paragraph in the Times concluded as\nfollows\nThe comet is now visible in the morning sky in the eastern\nquarter between 2 and 3 a.m.\nThere can be, I think, no reasonable doubt that the statement\nof the table at 9 p.m. on August 9 is directly connected with\nthe statement of the Times on August 10. The question is\nwhether any previous notice in any paper could have been seen\n1\nHere again the Latin hexameters defy translation. The last word is nonsense\nand metrically impossible; the translateable words are as follows: \"So many\ngreen banks does the Egyptian river weave with green growth (?), and so gives his\nown ... to each.\"\nz\nfrume.ntum means \"corn.''\n3\nCf. Virg. JEn. X. 272, 3; cometae sanguinei lugubre, rv.be.nt: \"bloody comets\nshow a fatal red.\"\nD\n\f50 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nby either automatist, and particularly whether there was any\nreason why they should anticipate the appearance of a comet\njust at that date. There had been table-tilting on August 2,\n3, 8, and 9, but no reference whatever to a meteoric sign or\ncomet appeared except as above quoted on August 9.\nWe at once searched for notices of an approaching comet\nin the back numbers of all papers that we were in the habit\nof seeing, but could find nothing bearing on the subject. There\nwas no mention of any comet in the evening paper of August 9\nwhich we had seen, nor in the Times for a month before\nthe date in question. The only paper in which I could find\nany notice of it was Nature\u2014a paper which no one of the\nautomatists ever sees, and which I went to a library to\nconsult. The following notes represent what appeared in\nNature in the \" Astronomical News.\"\nOn June 20, it was stated that a telegram from Kiel\nannounces the discovery of the 4th comet of this year by\nMr. Daniel of Princeton on June 14.\nOn June 27, July 4, July 11, July 18, there were notes\nof the progress of \" 1 9 0 7\nd\n(Daniel's comet).\"\nOn July 25, it was said to be \"very probable that it will\nbecome an easy naked-eye object during August,\" and that\non July 18 it had been seen with a small telescope at\nS. Kensington.\nOn Aug. 1 an account of its position from Aug. 3 to\nAug. 19 was given with a map.\nOn Aug. 8 in one paragraph the comet was said to be\n\" now approaching the naked-eye stage,\" and the dates of its\nrising on August 9, and of its approximate position on August\n14, were given. In another paragraph in the same issue of\nNature, it was said, \" Daniel's comet has been visible to the\nnaked eye since the first few days of July,1\nand is now suffi-\nciently conspicuous to arrest the immediate attention of any-\none who will look towards the eastern sky before the morning\ntwilight becomes too strong.\" Then follows a description of\nits appearance at 3 a.m. on August 5, and its \" Ephemeris\nfor some days, showing that its greatest brightness would be\non August 22.\n1\nSo printed in Nature But it seems clear, from the note of July 25th quoted\nabove, that \" Jul}' \" is here a misprint for \" August.\"\n\flxv.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 51\nThere does not appear from these notices in Nature any\nreason why the 9th of August should have produced an\nallusion to the comet rather than some other date in August\n\u2014the 8th, for instance\u2014on which table-tilting under precisely\nsimilar conditions took place. The connexion\u2014if connexion\nthere be\u2014seems rather to be with the fact that the evening of\nthe table-tilting was the evening preceding the day of announce-\nment in more than one daily newspaper. So that the source\nof the automatic phenomena is perhaps to be sought in the\nminds of the writer or writers of the newspaper paragraphs.1\nIt remains to consider whether anything can be inferred as\nto the source of the automatic phenomena above described.\nThe successful results may be classed under eight heads,\nbriefly described as\n(1) Dream.\n(2) Dawn.\n(3) Diana.\n(4) Hugo.\n(5) Eequiescat.\n(6) Water Eights.\n(7) Steam Laundry.\n(8) Comet.\nOf these the three last are, or may be claimed to be, veri-\ndical statements, four of the others (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5) are\ncross-correspondences, and one, Diana (3), is both a subject of\ncross-correspondence and of veridical statement.\nIn the last three cases the automatists are the same, my\ndaughter and her cousin, and the facts to which the automatists\nalluded were in each case known to one, or more, living mind,\nthough no one living mind possessed the knowledge of the three\nfacts, namely, that on Aug. 2 Mr. Kiviere was occupied with\na water-rights case, and that a steam laundry was in danger of\npollution, and that on Aug. 9a\" wanderer \" on that night might\nsee a \" meteoric sign in the east at dawn.\" Moreover, the\ntransition on Aug. 2, at my coming into the room, from legal\nmatters to a subject recently in my thoughts, strongly suggests\nl Cf. Proc. Vol. XX., pp. 324-326 and 328-330 for two somewhat similar cases\nwhere M. V. script seems, in part at least, to have anticipated paragraphs in\nthe Giomale d'ltalia on June 27, 1902, and the Daily Mail on May 11, 1901.\n\f52 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nthat my mind, whether or not the original and ultimate source\nof the phenomena, was at least contributory. So that in the\nabsence of further evidence it seems likely that the explanation\nof these three cases is to be sought in telepathy with the living.\nFurther, it is certain that the action of the living mind was\naltogether unconscious ; Mr. Eiviere did not know that his wife\nand my daughter were experimenting, and the same may\ncertainly be said of the journalists who composed the press\nnotices of the comet. I had definitely desired that the possi-\nbility of \" pollution \" to Cambridge water should not be known,\nand had not consciously thought of its connexion with a steam\nlaundry.\nBut if access to the mind of the living without the conscious\nvolition of that mind is responsible for these three cases, there\nstill remains the question who or what is responsible for the\nselection of the particular material conveyed. Is it deliberate,\nor due to an accidental association of thought ? As has been\npointed out, the word \" water \" serves as a link between the\ncontents selected from Mr. Riviere's mind and from mine on\nAug. 2, and that word itself is easily associated with the name\nof one automatist. Again, in the last case, the comet was to\nbe seen \" at dawn,\" and the word \" Dawn \" had been very\nprominent in the automatic phenomena shortly before obtained.\nBut without further evidence and more abundant material,\nspeculation on this subject is premature.\nThere is no internal evidence bearing on the source to be\nderived from the automatic phenomena themselves ; no claim\nis made as to the origin of the statements, and no \" communi-\ncator \" is named or suggested.\nIt is not easy to determine with certainty the starting point\nof a cross-correspondence, still less to discover its ultimate\nsource. Priority of emergence may be an indication, but cannot\nbe a proof, of priority of impression, as allowance must be made\nfor delay in the automatic record. In the case of \" Bequiescat\n(No. 5) the first emergence seems to be in Mrs. Piper's trance\nin March, 1907, the second in the table-tilting of my daughter\nand her cousin on Aug. 3, the third and fourth in M. V. script\nof Aug. 14 and 21. Mrs. Piper's trance-speech, which gave the\nword Bequiescat as a topic for cross-correspondence, may have\nbeen the starting point. If so, a completely new form was given\n\fLXV.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 53\nto the idea by the appearance in the table-tilting of the first\nline of a poem called Bequiescat, familiar to one at least of the\nautomatists, and it was this form which emerged some days later\nin M. V. script. The starting point of the cross-correspondence\nmay be located in Mrs. Piper's trance, or in the table-tilting of\nmy daughter and Mrs. Eiviere, according as we associate or do\nnot associate together the quotation from Matthew Arnold's\npoem and the words \" reseat resquiat.\"\nThere is little internal evidence in the automatic records\nthemselves as to the supposed source of this cross-correspondence.\nMyersv is the communicator of both my scripts,\n1\nand the second\nalludes to \" Henry Sidgwick.\" MyersP was the principal control\nof Mrs. Piper's trance on March 13, and the words \"Faith\nHope Charity \" have constantly been associated in script with\nMr. Sidgwick.\n2\nBut the table-tilting makes no claim or allusion\neither to Frederic Myers or to Henry Sidgwick, so that the\ninternal evidence is far from complete. And even if the internal\nevidence consistently specified a particular \" communicator \" as\noriginating a successful cross-correspondence, much further corro-\nborative evidence would be recpuired before such a view could\nbe accepted.\nThe other four topics (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4) are the subjects of\nsuccessful cross-correspondence both individually and as parts\nof a whole which we may here call Victor Hugo's Poem, or Booz\nEnclormi. Let us first consider them individually, and note the\norder of their emergence.\nNo. 1. Dream. This emerged first, explicitly and emphati-\ncally, in M.

V. script of June\n(No. 4) but here I can detect no difference of emphasis in the\nemergence of Hugo in the M. V. script and in the table-tilting\nby H.V. and M. A. B. on July 30.\nPriority of emergence does not, as I have said, necessarily\nconnote priority of impression, but when to priority is added\nmarked emphasis, the claim to be the starting-point of the\ncross-correspondence may be said to be considerably reinforced.\n\flxv.] A Month's Record of Automatisms. 55\nI am therefore disposed, in the present state of the evidence, to\nregard my script as the starting-point of Dream and Daivn, and\nmy daughter's script as the starting-point of Diana ;\nthere is not\nsufficient evidence to assign Hugo to either set of automatists.\nBut these four topics are, as I have said, parts of a single\ntopic which includes them all\u2014Hugo's poem, Booz Endormi,\ncontaining the simile of the crescent moon, and the allusions to\nDream and Dawn. This poem was itself the subject of a cross-\ncorrespondence between M. V. script of July 30, and H. V. and\nM. A. B. tilting on July 30 and July 31. Following the line\nof argument as above, my script of July 30 may be regarded as\nthe starting-point of the actual topic of Booz Endormi, for it is at\nonce prior to the table-tilting allusions and more definite. If\nthe allusions to this poem in the scripts were confined to the\nactual cross-correspondence on the subject produced on July 30\nand July 31, I think we ought to seek the source as well as\nthe starting-point in my script, and as the poem was familiar to\nme, there would be no reason to look beyond my memories and\nassociations in order to explain the selection of this particular\ntopic for automatic use.\nBut I find it impossible to separate the allusions to Booz\nEndormi from the earlier subjects of cross-correspondence,\nDream, Dawn, and Diana's Crescent Moon. Two of those three\ntopics my script is probably responsible for starting, namely,\nDream and Dawn. But the third, Diana, first emerged on\nJune 28 in my daughter's script, and H. V. script takes\nprecedence of M. V. script in the whole series of scripts dealing\nwith this group of topics. The H. V. script of June 28 is\nclosely connected with my script of July 30\u2014which contains a\ndefinite allusion to Booz Endormi\u2014by the drawing of the\ncrescent. In both scripts the crescent is placed at the end of\na long stick ; in one case the stick is horizontal, in the other\nvertical. No other drawing remotely resembling those drawings\nhad occurred in the script of either automatist, so that these\nanalogous and distinctive, though not precisely similar, drawings\nmake an indisputable link between the H. V. script of June 28\nand the M. V. script of July 30.\nBut if we see in the H. V. script of June 28 the starting-\npoint of one of the four contributory topics\u2014Diana's crescent,\nthe crescent of Hugo's simile\u2014we cannot here, as in the case of\n\f56 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nmy script of July 30, seek the source in the automatist's memory\nand associations, for the poem was not known to her. And if we\naccount for the H. V. script of June 28 by giving the auto-\nmatist credit for access to my memories and associations, we\nhave still to consider the bearing on the whole question of\nMrs. Forbes's sketch of the crescent moon on July 17, to which\nattention was drawn by the allusions to Diana in my script\nof the same day. Is this unique action of Mrs. Forbes\u2014for\non no other occasion has she ever sketched a crescent moon\nto be attributed to chance, to the action of my subliminal self,\nor to some other intelligence directing the whole series of\nallusions to Hugo's poem ?\nAs to the claims made by the documents themselves, none\nof the H. V. scripts are signed or offer any reason for attri-\nbuting them to a particular communicator, and the same may\nbe said, as usual, of the table-tilting (H. V. and M. A. B.). In\nthe M. V. scripts no claim is made on July 14; Myersv is\nresponsible for the scripts of July 17 and July 30, while the\nscript of July 20 is signed with a Greek capital 2, a signature\nalmost certainly intended to represent Henry Sidgwick.\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 57\nIII.\nLES GORRESPONDANCES CROISEES ET LA\nMETHODE EXPERIMENTALE.\nPar JOSEPH MAXWELL, M.D.\nLbs dernieres publications de la S.P.R, soulevent une grave\ndifficult^, celle de la methode dans les Sciences Psychiques.\nElle est d'une extreme importance. La methode doit etre\nd'autant plus severe que l'objet d'une science est plus conteste.\nPour cela, chaque detail d'une experience doit etre controls,\nchaque fait initial doit etre indiscutable. L'imagination doit\netre ecartee avec soin de la discussion ; s'il est permis de\nconstruire des hypotheses sur les faits, ces derniers ne peuvent\netre eux-memes hypothetiques.\nLe point de depart du mouvement actuel se trouve dans les\ntravaux de MM. Hodgson et Myers. L'oeuvre de M. Myers\nest de premier ordre.\nJe ne fais pas le meme cas des travaux de M. Hodgson. Le\njugement chez lui n'est pas toujours sur, il est altere par des\nidees preconcues. Ses conclusions ont toutes leurs precedents\ndans la litterature spirite et aboutissent a une contradiction\n(Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 404-405): \"even the best of direct\n'\ncommunicators ' through Mrs. Piper's trance is partly asleep!'\n. . .\n\" the consciousness producing the writing\u2014whatever that\nconsciousness may be . . . \u2014is not conscious of writing.\" Quelle\nbase peut offrir a la recherche serieuse une communication dont\nle communiquant n'a pas conscience ?\n1\nAu point de vue de l'analyse intime de la personnalite de\nla trance, le systeme de M. Hodgson conduit a une impasse.\nEn realite, cet observateur avait constate un fait, deja signale :\nles processus mentaux de l'automatisme presentent beaucoup\n1\nVoy., par exemple, Stainton Moses: \"Communicating spirits are probably in\nan abnormal state.\" Light, 188- , p. 186.\n\f58 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nd'analogie avec ceux du reve ; ils revelent chez l'auteur des\nmessages, quel qu'il soit, des etats de conscience \" oniriques.\"\nL'analyse n'a pas permis de determiner, dans tous les cas, la\nsource des informations manifestoes par la personnalite servant\nde support a ces etats de conscience. Les travaux anterieurs\nde la societe ont etabli que la telepathie etait une de ces\nsources possibles.\nL'etude psychologique de l'automatisme a ete faite avec soin\npar M. Myers ; cet aspect du problems a echappe a peu pres\ncompletement k M. Hodgson, qui a cherche une solution generale\na toutes les dimcultes rencontrees par lui. Cette solution, la\ntheorie spirite l'offrait aisement ;\nl'hypothese quelle adopte\nsupprime, par definition, toutes les dimcultes.\nLa methode inauguree par M. Hodgson a ete suivie par les\nrecents experimentateurs.\nI.\nC'est apres la mort de M. Myers que le mouvement nouveau\na pris naissance. II a trouve un apotre admirable dans Mme\nVerrall.\nL'etude des dernieres publications de la S.P.R. doit done\ncommencer par l'analyse du memoire de Mme Verrall sur son\neeriture automatique {Proceedings, Vol. XX.). C'est Ik qu'est\nl'origine des Correspondances croisees dont Mile Johnson a\nplus tard formule la theorie.\nCe memoire nest pas une analyse, mais un plaidoyer. II\nne pouvait en Otre autrement. On ne peut etre juge dans\nsa propre cause. Mme Verrall, avec la meilleure volonte,\nne pouvait etre impartiale. Un medium peut decrire ses\nimpressions subjectives, non apprecier la valeur des ses\nphenomenes.\nMadame Verrall peut d'autant moins etre impartiale qu'elle\na fini par avoir foi en son eeriture automatique, foi au point\nde provoquer l'ouverture imprudente de la lettre posthume de\nM. Myers. Cette confiance explique beaucoup de choses qui\nsurprennent dans son mimioire : distractions, legeres erreurs de\ntraduction, omissions, qui ne sont pas comprehensibles si on\nne tient pas compte de ce sentiment. Mme Verrall perd\nde vue les faits en eux-mOmes ; elle n'apereoit que les details\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 59\nfavorables a sa these. Les autres lui echappent, completement\nquelquefois. Je vais en donner des exemples.\nLe 31 Janvier 1902, elle ecrivit:\n\" Panopticon <r(patpa<; ariTaXXet avvSeyiuu \/nvaTiKor. t'l ovk\ne$lSws; volatile ferrum. pro telo impinget \" (Vol. XX., p. 214).\nLes mots latins suggererent a Mme Verrall l'ide'e d'une lance,\net elle nota, le 7 Fevrier 1902, que Virgile emploie cette\nexpression dans le sens de lance, \" spear.\"\nLe 28 Janvier 1902, apres une allusion a une pretendue\nvision de Mile Verrall, le controle de Mme Piper fut invite\npar M. Hodgson a, apparaitre a Mile Verrall avec une lance\n(spear) a la main. \u2014 \" Why a sphere ?\n\" demanda le controle ? \u2014\nM. Hodgson repeta \" spear,\" et le controle consentit. Le\n4 Fevrier, il pretendit avoir reussi a se faire voir a Mile\nVerrall avec une \"sphear\" [sic] a la main. La confusion\nentre sphere et spear persistait, dit Mme Verrall.\nMile Verrall n'eut aucune impression, ni aucune vision.\nMais \" between those dates, my script (as interpreted by me\nat the time) said that the seeing of a sphere effected a\nmysterious '\nco-reception,' and associated this statement with a\nreference to a spear. It seems to me that, though the pro-\nposed experiment did not succeed in the way intended, there\nis strong reason for thinking that my script was in some way\naffected by it\" (Vol. XX., p. 216). Ce texte etait signe d'une\ncroix grecque que l'ecriture (en Juin 1903, Vol. XX., p. 78)\nattribue k Lector.\nL'analyse de Mme Verrall est fantaisiste. \" Panopticon \" ne\nveut pas dire la vue. C'est un mot anglais cite par Webster\nil y a une association subliminale anterieure entre ce mot et\nsphere, dans les textes Verrall (14 Mars 1901, on figurent\ntrois croix) ;\na-ui'Seyiua n'est pas un mot grec. Le texte, tel\nque Mme Verrall le traduit, est inapplicable aux circonstances,\ncar personne n'a vu de sphere, et on n'apercoit pas de co-\nreception.\nVolatile ferrum ne veut dire spear que par suite d'une\nerreur probable de Mme Verrall. Le sens virgilien est fleche. 1\n1\nII suffit de lire les passages de Virgile (Eniide, IV., 71; VIII., 694) pour\nvoir qu'il s'agit de fleches. Par exemple, IV., 71: \"Qualis conjecta cerva\nsagitta, Quam procul incautam . . . fixit, Pastor agens telis liquitque volatile\nferrum, nescius . . . hteret letalis arundo.\"\n\f60 Joseph Maxwell, 31. D. [part\nLe mot latin pour lance est hasta, quelquefois associe a volans\n(EnMdc, IX., 411). L'association phonetique de Dido, volatile\nferritin, s'explique par des lois connues.1\nEn effet, le passage\nde YUne'idc est :\n\" Uritur infelix Dido . . . qualis conjecta cerva\nsagitta,\" etc. (voir note precedente).\nEnfin, le texte de Mme Verrall est en latin. Or, nous\napprenons (Proceedings, Vol. XXII., p. 314) que Kector-Piper\nne sait pas le latin. II y a la une singuliere contradiction,\nsi ce controle joue un role quelconque, conime tend a le\ncroire Mme Verrall. En tous cas, il ne transmet pas l'image\npromise et ne s'adresse pas a la personne convenue. La croix\nne signifie pas grand chose, car nous trouvons des croix dans\nle texte du 14 Mars 1901 ou figurent aussi Panopticon et\nsplice rev.\nL'incident relatif a la communication simultanee donnee par\nle controle Talbot Forbes chez Mme Forbes et chez Mme\nVerrall est encore expose avec le meme defaut de methode.\nMme Verrall resume les concordances ainsi (Vol. XX., p. 223):\n\" On a certain day '\nTalbot Forbes,' in Mrs. Forbes' script,\ndeclared that he was seeking and implied that he had found\nanother automatic writer through whom to communicate with\nher. On the same day a statement was made in my script\nabout fir-trees planted in a garden which had a meaning for\nMrs. Forbes and a special connexion with her automatic experi-\nments, and the signature of this script, to which attention had\nbeen directed, represented partially the badge of Talbot Forbes'\nregiment, together with a sword.\"\nLes faits n'ont pas exactement la physionomie qu'elle leur\nprete ;\n\" conifera arbos \" ne veut pas dire des sapins (fir-trees),\nmais un arbre conifere. Mme Verrall substitue un nom de\ngenre a celui d'une famille botanique et donne a son texte, par\ncela et par l'indication du plurieL une ressemblance plus grande\navec les faits qu'il n'est legitime de le faire.\nElle ad met ensuite que le dessin representant une croix\nest une epee; mais, (1) la garde d'une epee moderne n'est\npas en forme de croix ; (2) le mot fir-tree est associe incontes-\ntablement a une croix dans les textes des 25 et 26 Aout,\n1902.\nD'ailleurs, le texte de Mme Forbes s'applique-t-il a Mme\n1\nc'SiSws, Aidw, Dido, uritur, etc.\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Mdihode experimentale. 61\nVerrall ? Dans le premier, Talbot F. ecrit qu'il doit faire seance\navec M. Gurney pour controler le sensitif et prouver a M. Forbes\npere que c'est bien lui, son fils, qui ecrit par la main de Mme\nForbes. Eien ne rappelle ces details clans le texte de Mme\nVerrall, ou il n'est pas question de M. Gurney.\nSi on retablit dans son integralite le texte du 28 Aoiit divise\nen trois fragments par Mme Verrall (op. cit, pp. 388, 404, 417)\non constate\n(1) qu'il y est question de croix.\n(2) qu'il rappelle le texte du 15 Mars 1901, \"Pollux Cappa\ndocus ponct tigillum.\"\n(3) qu'il rappelle celui du 14 Mars 1901, \" Marmario\nglyptato . . , cidtellario.\"\n(4) Mme Verrall y voit un essai de reponse a la question\ndes mots grecs. Si l'influence du controle Talbot doit etre\nadmise, comment devient-elle intelligible ? II veut prouver a\nson pere qu'il fait ecrire Mme Forbes, mais il ne s'occupe\nque de ^experience de M. Verrall et d'une inscription ; il ne\nse revele que par la lointaine allusion \" conifera \" et le cor\nsuspendu.\nII ne semble y avoir aucune continuite' de conscience entre\nles textes de Mme Forbes et Verrall.\n\" Omina sibimet ostendit \" est traduit par \" gives its own\nportent.\" Le traducteur oublie le sens rifle'chi de sibimet.\nII ne saurait etre question de la competence incontestee\nde Mme Verrall ; elle commet ces erreurs de traduction, non\npar ignorance du latin, mais par suite de son e'tat d'esprit.\nPersuadee de la valeur supranormale de ses textes, elle choisit\ninconsciemment tous les elements de nature a confirmer sa\nthese, et s'arrete a des interpretations discutables, pour peu\nqu'elles soient favorables ; les autres interpretations, plus\nprobables, lui echappent.\nL'incident des mots grecs \/uovottcoXov e? aw est instructif\na ce point de vue.\nEn Avril 1901, le Dr. Verrall essaya de faire ecrire auto-\nmatiquement par Mme Verrall ces mots grecs ; ils n'ont\njamais ete ecrits, le sens n'en a jamais ete donne, comme Mme\nVerrall le reconnait d'ailleurs. Un experimentateur ordinaire\nn'aurait jamais songe a faire etat d'une semblable experience\nde communication de pensee entre deux epoux, vivant sous le\n\f62 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nmeme toit, alors surtout que l'experience se prolonge pendant\n1 5 mois.\nLa phrase grecque est obscure : elle signitie \" vers l'aurore,\"\nmais on n'est pas d'accord sur le sens de novcnrwkos qui signifie\n\" a un seul cheval \"\n; M. Verrall prefere le sens \" solitaire.\" Ces\nmots sont extraits de YOreste d'Euripide ; ils figurent dans un\npassage dont la traduction fut donnee en 1873 a un Concours\nauquel le Dr. Verrall prit part.\nM. Verrall n'avertit pas sa femme de son experience ; celle-ci\nnous dit qu'il ne lui en parla pas au cours des essais faits pour\nreproduire les mots grecs ; on verra au contraire que le Dr.\nVerrall laissa bientot deviner qu'il attendait quelque chose.\nDes le 16 Aofit 1901, apres la lecture d'un texte, il dit a\nMine Verrall \" that he thought it [the writing] was trying to\nsay what he wanted\" (Vol. XX., p. 388).\nL'examen des textes montre que l'ecriture automatique a ete\nguidee par le Dr. lui-meme, qui voyait les textes, et disait s'ils\netaient ou n'etaient pas interessants pour lui. Un peu d'atten-\ntion revele les procedes de la conscience liee aux automatismes\nde Mme Verrall.\nL'experience commence en Avril 1901. La premiere allusion\nsignalee est \"Five stars in the East . .\n.\" (16 Juin 1901,\nVol. XX., p. 387).\nLe 4 Juillet 1901: \"Yellow is the colour of the dawn\"\n(Tithoni croceum linquens aurora cubile, vers trois fois repete\ndans Virgile).\nLe contexte cite p. 416 se refere a toute autre chose que\nles mots grecs, et le Dr. Verrall n'a point dit que ce texte\nl'interessait.\nLe premier texte auquel il ait donne son approbation est\ncelui du 31 Juillet (p. 388) ou nous voyons, dans le fragment\npublic, les idees suivantes\nLongsevus, senex, barba, alba, p.ovoyj.Tm>o<i, albipannosus,\nsignifer, 7 mots comportant un grand nombre d'associations.\nL'idee relative a albus, alba, blanc, est deux fois repetee,\nsans avoir rien de commun avec aube, aurore (barbe blanche,\nvetements blancs).\nCeux d'entre mes lecteurs qui sont familiers avec la psycho-\nlogie des etats de conscience oniriques ne seront pas etonnes\nde voir surgir plus tard (13 Aout 1901, p. 388) l'idee de\n\flxv.] Oorrespondances croise'es et la Methocle experimentale. 63\nblancheur developpee avec des jeux de mots, des alliterations\net des images ; ce theme aboutit a \" crested cock that crows\n. . . \u2014not a real bird, heraldic\u2014with a motto\u2014Cano, canam\nalbam \" (je chante l'aube blanche): epithete qui ne rappelle\npas celle du 4 Juillet, \"yellow\" (jaune), mais sert de lien entre\nCano, canam et albam.\nM. Verrall n'a rien trouve dans ce texte qui lui parut se\nreferer a ses mots grecs. II est meilleur juge et plus desin-\nteresse. Depuis le 31 Juillet au moins, malgre quelle dise le\ncontraire (note, Vol. XX., p. 157), Mme Verrall sait que les\ntextes peuvent interesser son mari (Vol. XX., p. 388).\nLe texte du 16 tatonne apres l'echec. II reprend l'idee du\nvieillard a barbe blanche, vetu de blanc, le decrit avec un\nbaton, une boite, quelqu'un le regarde et observe la lumiere\nqui passe d'une fenetre a l'autre, allant vers l'orient. A. W. V.\ncomprendra. Le texte contenait quelques mots grecs.\nCe texte est approuve, mais l'ecrivain des textes ne sait pas\npourquoi. Cela rend l'hypothese d'une coincidence fortuite plus\nprobable que celle d'une action telepathique et exclut Faction\nd'une intelligence directrice.\nL'inintelligence du but de l'experience se revele dans le texte\nsuivant, qui brode sur le theme \" fenOtre,\" mais n'obtient aucune\napprobation (20 Aout).\nLe 23, retour a l'idee du coq, assortie d'une tentative vers\nla description d'une inscription avec un mot grec ; ce texte\nne provoque aucune approbation, aussi l'idee de coq, apres une\nemergence voilee dans le texte du 28 est abandonnee et ne\npersistera que dans la selection du sens ou s'orientera la con-\nscience onirique, c'est k dire vers can, de cano, canam, approuves\navec le texte du 16 (malgre la non approbation du texte\ndu 13).\nL'idee de can-o est dissociee : la premiere syllable sert de\ntheme k des associations oniriques paralleles aux precedentes,\ndeveloppees dans le sens d'allusions a une chapelle et au Dr.\nBenson.\n[Texte\n\f64 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nTexte du 28 Aofit 1901.

(Vol. XX., p. 162), etc.\nCela ne semble pas serieux. L'idee de la lettre ir n'apparait pas le moins\ndu monde.\n\flxv.] Correspondances crois4es et la Methods expe'rimentale. 67\nLes textes ne se rapprochent uu pen de l'idee d'aurore que\nle 12 decembre, au milieu d'erreurs sans nombre.\nJe ne retiendrai que deux incidents : le premier est relatif\nau texte du 18 Septembre, qui est un message pour nne dame;\nMrue Verrall en utilise une partie (p. 206) pour justifier des\nallusions a une dame Archdale. II est plus probable que le\n\"her\" est cependant Mme Forbes. En tous cas, il s'agit d'un\nmessage relatif h \"a knife\u2014on a table, with letters engraved\nupon it\u2014not English (~~M t Tf *7T Q \u00a3 tne letters look\nlike that. It is a friendly wish. Ask her . .\n.\"\nII est clair que ces mots ne concernent pas du tout l'ex-\nperience ;\n\" cependant,\" dit Mme Verrall, \" le texte \" s'empara de\nl'unique idee non encore representee, celle de cheval, dans le\nsens ordinaire de yUoyoVwAo?. Le mot suggere euiinros qui a\nde bons chevaux. Pendant que Mme Verrall ecrivait, son mari\nessayait de l'impressionner. II est possible que l'apparition des\nlettres grecques soit due a une transmission de pensee, mais\ncela est incertain. Nous savons que M. Verrall traduit fxovo-\n7r(oXo9 par solitaire. Pourquoi l'idee de cheval est-elle transmise ?\nII y a la un point difficile a comprendre.\nLe sens general du contexte rend improbable l'explication\ndonnee par Mme Verrall ; il suffit de s'y reporter.\nS'il y a une action telepathique, elle se produit d'une\nmaniere qui rappelle tout a fait les correspondances croisees\ndu type mosaique et, comme l'a fait observer M. Pigou, cette\naction telepathique ote tout fondement aux theories de Mile\nJohnson sur ce genre de correspondances.\nLe second incident est l'aveu que lecriture automatique fait\nelle-meme de son ignorance. \" What is the word he wants to\ncomplete, neither you nor I know it. so it is hard to get.\nIt all belongs to him but not to me, his friends but not mine.\nISTo one here knows but one and her I have not met. I will\nask Arthur . .\n.\"\nJusqu'au dernier moment l'ecriture n'a rien percu des mots\ngrecs, car le dernier texte cite parle d'Hannibal, de Sagonte,\nde \" molens,\" et finit, symboliquement sans doute, par \" no nono\n\"\n(Vol. XX., p. 392).\nC'est sur cette mauvaise experience que Mme Verrall se\nfonde pour dire que son texte a essaye de reproduire tantot le\n\f68 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nsens, tantot le son des mots grecs (Vol. XX., p. 159). Elle est\ntrop favorable a ses essais. Je ne puis voir par exemple une\napproximation de fiovoiroAos clans, \" blow hot, blow cold\n(p. 393).\nDe plus, la telepathic, telle que nous la connaissons, ne\ntransmet ordinairement pas des alternatives. On peut trans-\nmettre le son, la forme, tout element sensoriel, ou l'idee abstraite.\nSi M. Verrall donne mi sens a \/\/oi'oVwAo? il n'en transmettra\npas deux. Cependant (p. 392) Mme Verrall nous indique la\ndouble traduction de ei't7T7ro? ou et? (7T7ro?, soit qui a un bon\ncheval, soit qui a un seul cheval, lecture alternative d'un mot\ndouteux, si on veut l'idee de cheval. Si Ton prefere l'idee de\nsolitaire, elle re'sulte de ces mots, \" alone with God and none\nother,\" et de ceux-ci, \" Planet or play net illustre vagatur coelo\nsine comite.\"\nJe doute que Ton puisse prendre au serieux ces arguments.\nC'est l'inauguration du systeme des interpretations symboliques\ndont on verra le developpement ulterieur.\nII y a encore un autre facteur qui est important, car il\nexplique bien des coincidences.\nOn compte, dans les textes publies, 234 mots ou idees\ndifferentes. Une analyse admettant l'approximation morpho-\nlogique, phonetique, symbolique et ideologique peut trouver a\ncoup sur, dans 1'immense quantite de materiaux que fournissent\n234 idees et leurs combiuaisons, une certaine proportion de\nconcordances.\nQuant aux faits exacts concernant des details etrangers aux\nmots, objet de l'experience, je doute qu'ils aient une valeur\nsupranormale. Leur connaissance subliminale s'explique, nota-\nment les details relatifs aux examens du Dr. Verrall. Je ne\nvois pas comment Mme Verrall peut se'rieusement soutenir qu'il\nn'en a jamais etc question entre elle et son mari. J'admets\nqu'elle n'a aucun souvenir conscient de conversations a ce sujet;\ncela ne prouve pas que de pareilles conversations n'aient jamais\neu lieu.\nLes methodes d'analyse de Mme Verrall se montrent encore\nclairement dans l'incident Constable.\nMme Verrall reconnait que l'experience a echoue ;\ncependant\nelle trouve dans l'indication repetee de prenoms en \" ia \" une\ntentative pour arriver au mot \" fuchsia,\" que contenait la lettre\n\flxv.] Gorresjwndances croisees et la Methode experivientale. 69\ndont elle devait dormer medianiquement le sens, et pense que\nson texte du 3 Novembre 1902, jour ou M. Constable ecrivit\nla lettre, objet de l'experience, decrit l'etat d'esprit de ce\nmonsieur (voy. Vol. XX., p. 170). En effet, le texte (p. 171):\n\" suggests\n(1) an utterance from a stranger,\n(2) a division of a task between two persons,\n(3) the obtaining of a clue from some one (masculine),\n(4) an effort of some one other than myself (feminine) to\ngive words.\"\nCe texte, qui demeure iniutelligible pour Mine Verrall, s'il\nne se refere pas a M. Constable, se refere manifestement a\nMme Forbes et aux controles.\nLe 3 Novembre 1902 Mme Verrall (p. 239) regoit une\nlettre de Mme Forbes contenant un message :\n\" (Myers) sees\nthe words, not so strong as your son's writing, but clearer.\nWill you be sure\u2014you\u2014tell Mrs. Verrall to be sure I am the\nwriter ...\" etc.\nA cette epoque il y avait des essais de correspondance tele-\npathique entre Mines Verrall et Forbes : par exemple, texte\ndu 27 Octobre 1902 (p. 238):\n\" Mrs. Forbes has the other words\u2014piece together. Add\nhers to yours.\"\n31 Octobre 1902 (p. 238):\n\" She has had some words incomplete, to be added to and\npieced and make the clue.\"\nLe 7 Novembre 1902 (p. 240):\n\" Your message comes through Mrs. Forbes.\"\nComparez maintenant le texte intercalaire du 3 Novembre\n(a) \" None the less through others not known speaks the fate.\n(b) I will give the words between you neither alone can\nread, but together they will give the clue he wants . . . hers\nare in English and will fill the gaps\u2014Wait some time for\nhers,\" etc.\nLa premiere phrase parait un de ces apophtegmes frequents\ndans l'ecriture automatique. Elle est inapplicable a, M. Con-\nstable, qui ne rendait aucun oracle. Le reste est la con-\ntinuation du courant d'idees indique dans les textes des 27\net 31 Octobre. \"He\" est le controle de Mme Forbes, et le\n\"clue\" est manifestement celui que vise le texte du 31 Octobre:\n\f70 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nla repartition des mots est clairement entre Mmes Forbes et\nVerrall.\nCela sauterait aux yeux si Mme Verrall avait joint a son\ncommentaire le texte complet qu'elle commente.\nLa seconde experience avec M. Constable montre encore le\nrneme precede (Vol. XX., p. 172).\nMme Verrall se trompa, mais indiqua, soit dans son texte,\nsoit dans les commentaires l'accompagnant\n\"(1) that the contents of the letter were less important\nthan the circumstances of the experiment\n(2) that the experiment was suggested to M. Constable by\nsome one else\n(3) that the experiment was connected with the sealed\nenvelope {i.e. the Myers envelope which there was a\nquestion of opening), and meant as a preliminary trial\n(4) that the sealed envelope sent me was one of two and\nthe less important.\"\nDans son memoire, Mme Verrall omet de nous indiquer mi\npoint capital, que la lecture de l'appendice revele ; elle assistait\nau diner du Conseil ou M. Constable parla de l'ouverture de\nla lettre de M. Myers (p. 400). Mme Verrall repondant a\nM. Constable, assure qu'elle n'a pas entendu la conversation\na table, etant assise a l'autre bout, et qu'elle ignorait qu'on eut\nagite la question de l'ouverture d'une enveloppe scellee.\nCe detail ote toute valeur a l'experience. Mme Verrall\nn'a certainement pas conscience d'avoir entendu cette conver-\nsation, mais peut-elle affirmer qu'aucun mot ne lui en est\nparvenu ? Qu'elle n'a rien surpris \" subconsciemment \" de cette\nconversation, fort naturelle dans les circonstances, et qui\nl'interessait directement ?\nCes quatre impressions sont correctes dans leur ensemble,\ndit-elle (p. 173). M. Constable cependant ecrit : \"I think the\nexperiment was not suggested to me by anyone\u2014I worked out\nthe idea myself\" (p. 399).1\n1 Voyez, au meme point de vue, revolution qui s'est produite dans 1'esprit\nde Mme Verrall a 1'occasion des textes des 8 Juillet et 25 Novembre 1901, qui\nemanent manifestement du m&me communicateur, M. Balfour. L'incident\nraconte parut imaginaire ; plus tard, Mme Verrall decouvrit, sur une indication\nimprecise de son <5criture, dans la Biographie du Professeur Sidgwick, un incident\nanalogue concernant M. Sidgwick et Sir G. Trevelyan. Elle arriva insensible-\nment a attribuer au premier des textes qu'elle avait d'abord attribues a M.\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croisees et la Methode expe'rimentale. 71\nJe terminerai en analysant deux cas interessants. Dans la\nnuit du 11 an 12 Mai 1901 deux jeunes gens veillent dans\nun chain bre hantee, a Londres ; ils entendent et voient les\nportes s'ouvrir a diverses reprises. Ils avaient repandu de la\ncraie (ou chaux ?) en poudre sur le plancher et constaterent\ndes empreintes semblables aux traces des pattes d'un gros\noiseau. Le meme jour, Mme Verrall avait ecrit : \"... calx\npedibus inhaerens difficultatem superavit . . .\n\" et dessine un\ngros oiseau a tete hurnaine grotesque, suivi d'un V entre\ndeux traits \u2014V\u2014. Au-dessous est ecrit et hoc genus omne\n(p. 328).\n1\nLe fait est fort curieux, car il a un rapport assez vague\navec un article du Daily Mail publie sur ce phenomene de\nhantise deux ou trois jours apres. J'ai eu l'occasion d'observer\ndes cas de ce genre, dont on trouve un autre exemple p. 324\net suivantes.\nCe fait est trop imprecis pour avoir une valeur probante.\nCalx a deux sens, et l'oiseau dessine est une caricature. Ces\ndeux details uniques d'identification sont douteux.\nLe second incident nous ramene aux questions de methode,\nauxquelles j'attache une grande importance. Le 11 Dec. 1901 :\n\" Frost and a candle in the dim light Marmontel he was\nreading on a sofa or in bed\u2014there was only a candle's light.\nShe will surely remember this. The book was lent not his\nown\u2014he talked about it\" (Vol. XX., p. 331).\nLe 17 Decembre :\n\". . .Marmontel is right. It was a French\nbook, a Memoir I think. Passy may help Souvenirs de\nPassy or Fleury. Marmontel was not on the cover\u2014the book\nwas bound and was lent\u2014two volumes in old-fashioned binding\nand print. It is not in any papers\u2014it is an attempt to\nmake someone remember\u2014an incident \" (Vol. XX., p. 332).\n_On trouve d'autres fragments de ce texte, pages 375 et 405.\nUn ami de M. Verrall, en Fevrier suivant, lut a Paris les\nMemoires de Marmontel, dans son lit ou etendu sur deux\nBalfour, dont la signature et l'ecriture sont iniites ; circonstance bien invrai-\nsemblable si le controle est M. Sidgwick. (Voy. notamment pp. 26, 27, 152, 185,\n225 ;\ncomparez avec 278).\n1\nI1 y a peut-etre entre la caricature et le texte un lien classique, reminiscence\nde la satire d'Horace :\n\" Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolae Mendici, mimi,\nbalairones, hoc genus omne.\"\n\f72 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nchaises ; dans le volume il etait question de la decouverte, a\nPassy, d'un panneau qui se trouvait mele a une histoire\nint^ressant Fleury.1 \" It will ... be noted \" (dit Mme Verrall)\n\"that the script in December, 1901, describes (as past) an\nincident which actually occurred two and a half months later,\n. . . an incident which at the time of writing was not likely\nto have been foreseen by anyone.\"\nSur quoi se fonde-t-elle pour considerer ce texte comme\nune prediction?

Mais\n1\nJe dois a la conrtoisie de Mine Verrall la precision de l'incident auquel\nelle fait allusion. C'est la decouverte de la plaque de cheminee mobile par\nlaquelle le Marechal de Kiehelieu s'introduisait chez Mme de la Popeliniere.\nJe n'avais pas songe a identifier cet incident bien connu, car le Cardinal de\nFleury ne joue aucun role dans cette histoire (the rinding at Passy of a\npanel connected with a story in which Fleury plays an important part. Vol.\nXX., p. 333).\nLe seul role joue par le Cardinal de Fleury a ete d'obliger La Popeliniere\na epouser sa femme. II n'a rien de commun avec l'histoire de la plaque\nmobile, a mon avis. (Marmontel, Mimoires, I. 238, ed. Jouaust, Paris,\n1891, 3 vol. in 1G\u00b0.)\n\flxv.] Correspondances croise'es et la Methode experimental?. 73\nla prophetie est si vague, si indeterminee quelle se realisera\nsi n'importe qui, n'importe ou, n'importe quancl lit au lit a la\nlueur d'une bougie, des memoires oil les noras de Marmontel,\nPassy et Fleury seraient cites.\nII y a une multitude de solutions possibles.\nUn fait domine l'incident. II ne s'agit pas d'une prophetie,\nmais d'un evenement passe, dont une dame se souviendra.\nCe sens est tellement clair que Mme Verrall a pense qu'il\netait question de Mme Sidgvvick et s'est renseignee aupres\nd'elle.\nII ne faut pas dire, et Mme Verrall ne le dit d'ailleurs\npas a cette occasion, que les controles sont independants du\ntemps. L'ecriture automatique de Mme Verrall est pleine\nd'allusions precises au temps (pp. 371-373). Aussi tourne-\nt-elle la difficulte. \" It is possible that what the writing in-\ntended to convey was that when the actual incident was\nspoken of in the presence of the writer\u2014as it was on March\n1st, 1902, by Mr. Marsh\u2014'she would surely remember' that\nthis incident had been described in the script\" (p. 335).\nPeut-on admettre un pareil systeme ? II est oppose au\nsens naturel des mots. La meilleure preuve est la phrase, \" it\nis not in any papers,\" indication contradictoire avec l'idee\nd'une prophetie. Quelque simplicity que Ton prete de temps\nen temps aux controles, on ne saurait aller jusqu'a admettre\nqu'ils prennent soin de preciser qu'un evenement a venir n'est\npas dans les gazettes.\n1\nII serait facile de multiplier les exemples de ces inter-\npretations forcees, qui n'indiquent pas un etat d'esprit de\nchercheur sans parti pris. Comment, par exemple, admettre\nserieusement la discussion de Mme Verrall soutenant que\nson texte a elabore une ingenieuse allusion a Syringa en\nparlant de M. Hodgson, d'Orotava, d'Oriona, de couronne\nd'Ariane et de Berenice ? Pourquoi ? Le syringa est botani-\nquement le Philadelphus Coronarius. Ses allusions a Oriona,\netc., sont des essais pour arriver a la couronne d'Ariane (?)\net au mot coronarius.

Chez cette sensitive, la crypto-\nmnesie joue un role considerable et Mile Johnson en cite\ndes exemples (Vol. XXL, p. 286 et ss.). Malgre cela, et\nmalgre qu'elle soit avertie de l'impossibilite d'atteindre la\nconscience subliminale du sujet en interrogeant sa conscience\nnormale (Vol. XXL, p. 3 8 9), elle commet constamment cette\nerreur. Je crains que Mile Johnson ne soit pas tres familiere\navec les recentes recherches faites sur la psychologie du\nsubconscient. La dissociation de la conscience qu'elle soupoonne\ndans l'automatisme (Vol. XXL, p. 263) est signalee depuis\nlongtemps.\nCe manque d'informations speciales ote beaucoup de valeur\naux analyses de Mile Johnson. Cependant, elle aurait pu,\navec un pen d'attention, acquerir la conviction que Mme\nHolland connait les Proceedings et le Journal. Voici les raisons\nqui me determinent\nLe 7 Mars 1906, Mme Verrall donne un texte concernant\nMme Holland, avec des details banals, indetermines ou faux.\n\flxv.] Corresjoonclances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 75\nPuis elle ecrit des vers contenant des reminiscences du poeme\nde Tintadgel, de Eoden Noel (Vol. XXI., p. 317).\nCe texte est communique a Mme H. qui ne voit rien pouvant\ns'appliquer a elle : les vers ne lui suggerent rien. Mais ils\ninspirent son texte du 1 1 Mars 1906; la on voit apparaitre\nla date du 26 Mai 1894, mort de M. Noel, et une dissertation\nparaissant emaner de lui et du Dr. Sidgwick.\nLe 14, le texte ecrit \" Eighteen fifteen four five fourteen\nFourteen fifteen five twelve. . . .

H, initiates s'appliquant certainement a Hodgson.\nCe n'est pas tout. Le nom de Lorberg figure dans le meme\nvolume (XIV., p. 215), dans un article de Mile Johnson \"On\nChance Coincidences.\" Or, ce nom a provoque l'attention\nsubliminale de Mme Holland, justement a l'occasion du texte\noil se trouvent cites les trois autres noms associes dans la\nmeme partie du volume XIV. Dans cet article encore, nous\ntrouvons (p. 199) les noms: Brett, Shuttleworth.\nL'origine cryptomnesique de cette quadruple association n'est\npas douteuse et Mme Holland, dans la rnesure on les preuves\nhumaines out quelque valeur, a certainement parcouru les articles\nde Mile Johnson et de M. Schiller, ou en a lu des comptes-\nrendus, et l'a oublie.\nRemarquons combien il serait naturel que Mme Holland ait\nlu les Proceedings et le Journal, et combien il est improbable\nqu'elle n'ait pas eu cette curiosite.\nVoici un exemple qui concerne le Journal Light\nLe 6 Fevrier 1906, Mme Holland ecrit un texte ou Ton\ntrouve :\n\" This scribe . . . thoughts of this scribe\u2014Medium is not\nthe best word ...\" (Vol. XXL, p. 283).\nCe texte communique a M.

Plus tard cependant, il eut connaissance\nd'un livre pen repandu, public en Amerique, Letters of et Spirit,\ndans lequel l'automatiste s'appelle le scribe.\nLe mot avait etc deja employe dans Light, notamment le\n17 Octobre 1896 ; un dcrivain signant Scriba, critique dans un\narticle le mot \" automatique\" dont let S.P.R. fait usage.\n\flxv.] Oorrespondances croisees et la Methode experimentcde. 77\nUn grand nombre de faits, qui nous sont presentes comme\nsupranormaux, peuvent n'etre que de simples cas de cryptomnesie ;\npar exemple, l'adresse du Dr. Verrall {Proc., Vol. XL, p. 190 ;\nVol. XII., p. 124) ; une toux nerveuse, un homme grand\n{Proc, Vol. VI., pp. 584, 585, 586), etc. II y aurait des\nrecherches psychologiques interessantes a faire sur les sources\nnormales spirites des textes automatiques des mediums de la\nS.P.R. ; cette recherche n'a pas ete serieusement faite.\n1\nMais, dit Mile Johnson, l'origine reelle des textes est moins\nimportante que l'apparition des coincidences observees entre\nMme Verrall et Mme Holland. Soit, mais alors, pourquoi\ninsister constamment sur l'impossibilite ou est le sensitif\nd'avoir normalement connaissance des faits indiques par lui ?\nPourquoi en faire etat comme clans la correspondance Poden\nNoel (Vol. XXL, p. 387) tout en reconnaissant la faiblesse de\nl'argument ?\nAnalysons done le meilleur cas de correspondance croisee\nentre Mmes Verrall et Holland, Ave Roma Immortalis.\n\" A number of details . . ., quite unintelligible to herself, were\ngiven by Mrs. Verrall, while a single other important detail,\nclinching the whole matter, was given by Mrs. Holland,\naccompanied by a remark implying that Mrs. Verrall had\nJ\nVoy. encore l'association entre M.

Or, la lettre K precede immediatement la\nlettre L ; une substitution analogue a celle qui dissimule le nom de M. Hodgson\nau commencement du texte l'explique bien simplement. Cela est d'autant plus\nvraisemblable que nous vo3*ons encore \"K. 37 not in the Appendix\" dans une\ntexte du ler Avril, 1906 (Vol. XXL, p. 346) : ce qui fait penser a Human\nPersonality, oil la plupart des cas sont cites, sans etre prefixes cependant de\nla lettre et du chiffre : l'apparition de ce detail conduit aux Publications de\nla S.P.R.\nLe texte precedant immediatement \"K. 37\" porte : \"Give her father's love.\nThe little grave.\" Or dans Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 37, il est question\nd'un pere qui est enterre, et qui apparait a sa fille.\nLa lettre K. figure dans l'article de Mile Johnson (Proc, Vol. XIV., p. 186).\nComparez aussi le texte du 11 Avril 1906.

Si primus inter pares s'applique au Pape St-Leon,\ncum eo frater, etc., ne s'applique pas a St-Paul. D'un autre\ncote il est difficile d'appliquer a St-Pierre le \"primus inter\npares ipse own nomioiis imonemor.\"\nEnfin, le texte annonce que les deux personuages indeter-\nmines enverront a Mme Verrall un mot par une autre.\nOn verra que ce n'est ni St-Pierre ni St-Paul, ni St-Leon\nqui envoient un message.\nL'emergence de l'idee du Pape clans les textes des 4 et\n5 Mars est due a la suggestion du Dr. Verrall (Vol. XXL,\np. 299). Sa femme sait qu'il voit oil le texte veut en venir\nil y a un pape, un frere par l'esprit, un siege. C'est la-dessus\nque le texte brode ; l'idee d'un siege de Eome, residence du\npape, eveille l'idee de paiens ou de reformes et rappelle les\npapes St-Gregoire (qui reussit a ecarter les Lombards a la\nfin du vi\ne\nsiecle), Gregoire VII. (assiege par l'Empereur Henri,\ngrand reformateur, Gregoire XIII. (reformateur du calendrier),\net St-Leon (assiege par Attila). On trouve ces indications\nmelees vaguement et associees a Hercule (Claviger, Columnae,\nCalpe).\nLe 7 Mars, Mme Holland donna un long texte ou se trou-\nvent melangees au moins 70 idees differentes, susceptibles\nd'associations nombreuses. On lit :\n\" Ave Eoma immortalis.\nHow could I make it any clearer without giving her the\nclue ? How cold it was that winter\u2014Even snow in Eome\nwe might have stayed at home, etc.\" (Vol. XXL, p. 295).\nMile Johnson trouve la un cas de correspondance typique.\nII n'est pas impossible, dit-elle, que l'idee de Eome ait ete\ntransmise telepathiquement par M. Verrall, mais alors pourquoi\nMme Holland a-t-elle ajoute :\n\" Comment pouvais-je le rendre\nplus clair sans lui donner l'indieation ?\n\" Cela n'etait pas\ndans la conscience de M. Verrall.\nAu point de vue de la telepathie le raisonnement de Mile\nJohnson est contestable; M. Verrall a eu le sentiment traduit\npar le texte, puisqu'il a dit a sa femme qu'il voyait ou\nl'ecriture voulait en venir, mais qu'il a garde le silence sur\nl'indieation precise, l'episode peint par Eaphael.\nLa telepathie n'est pas necessaire ; il y a une simple\ncoincidence. M. Myers est mort a Eome, et on trouve de\n\fso Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nnombreuses references a Home dans les textes public's de Mme\nHolland : le contexte montre beaucoup d'erreurs et de contra-\ndictions difficiles a comprendre s'il y a une intelligence unique\ndirigeant les communications.\nL'analyse du cas \" Elicu ! fugaccs \" conduit aux memes\nconclusions. On nous dit que le texte de Madame Verrall\n(cite. Vol. XXI., p. 363) repete plusieurs fois l'idee de fuite.\nOn pent contester cette interpretation qui serait fondee sur\nla description d'un enlevement imaginaire. Je vois bien l'idee\nd'une promenade que font ensemble des personnes indeter-\nminees, en voiture, avec de la neige, un brillant soleil, le\nbruit des clochettes et du fouet ; mais je n'apereois pas la\nfuite, ni l'enlevement. On ne choisit pas pour fair, ni pour\nenlever, un brillant soleil, on ne claque pas du fouet et on\nne garnit pas les harnais de sonnettes, c'est levidence merae.\nMme Verrall fait allusion a une promenade en voiture,\ndans l'Engacline, si Maloja traduit le seuil de Maloggia, ortho-\ngraphic a l'anglaise.\nViennent ensuite l'idee de chauve-souris qui s'enfuit (on\ns'est envolee), une dame est seule. Puis: \"There is an effort\nto have the same words this time\"; en fin : \"On bat's wings\nrides Queen Mab.\" Le seul mot repete est \" bat,\" chauve-\nsouris.\nLe mOme jour, Mme Holland ecrit :\n\" A great black shadow\nand the sound of a wailing wind\u2014Eheu fuo;aces\n'\no o\nCela suffit a Mile Johnson pour nous assurer qu'il y a une\ncorrespondance croisee. L'idee de fuite si richement decrite par\nMme \\rerrall est resumee dans un seul mot latin par Mme\nHolland, comme on l'a observe (?) clans le cas \" Ave Roma.\"\nLa seule idee de fuite observable dans le texte de Madame\nVerrall est relative a la chauve-souris. Elle n'a aucun rapport\navec l'idee d'ombre noire et de vent qui gemit, exprimee par\nMme Holland. Les mots latins, qui se trouvent dans tous les\nrecueils de citation (p. ex. Wood), expriment seuls l'idee corres-\npondante, mais l'expression en est fort differente, car Horace\nne vent peindre que lY-coulement rapide des annees. C'est\nl'idee de vitesse, non de fuite qui inspire ses vers.\nL'emergence du latin s'explique par le desir d'avoir un\nmessage semblable a celui de Madame Verrall dont les textes\nsont fertiles en mots latins. On trouve l'indication du desir\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 81\nque j'indique dans une lettre ecrite par Mine Holland (Vol. XXI.,\np. 364).\nMile Johnson fait done dire au texte de Mme Verrall plus\nqu'il ne contient, ou autre chose que ce qu'il dit ;\nensuite, elle\ns'appuie sur une concordance eloignee, douteuse quand au sens,\net dont l'un des termes est une locution latine devenue pro-\nverbiale. D'un autre cote elle oublie que le controle annonce\nqu'il essaye de transmettre les mimes mots, car Mmes Verrall\net Holland ecrivent le meme jour, apres convention. Or, chose\nsignificative, il n'y a aucun mot latin dans le texte de Mme\nVerrall, tel qu'il est publie, ce qui est contraire a ses habitudes.\nEn revanche, Mme Holland cite du latin, ce qui est egalement\ncontraire a ses habitudes. On voit dans ce petit detail la trace\nd'un effort subconscient, qui aboutit a des resultats contra-\ndictoires, et exclut manifestement l'idee d'un intelligence\ndirectrice.\nUne methode prudente devrait tenir compte des elements\nque je signale, et eviter de considerer comme demontres des\nfaits douteux ou indetermines. Or on constate trop souvent\nce vice de raisonuement chez Mile Johnson. En voici d'autres\nexemples.\nMme Verrall, 21 Mars 1906, ecrit: \" Posilippo, and a terrace\nthere, blue sea beyond the marble balustrade \" (Vol. XXL,\np. 334).\nUne heure auparavant, Mme Holland avait ecrit :\n\" M. saw\na real place that last time but she has never seen the place\nitself and did not describe it very clearly.\"\nLes deux textes ne coincident pas, puisque Mme Holland\necrit a 10 heures 10, alors que Mme Verrall n'a pas encore\necrit. De plus Mme Verrall n'a rien vu, a moins que l'ana-\nlogie ne permette de prendre le mot see comme synonyme de\nwrite. Quant a la description, elle est applicable a cent mille\nendroits ou il y a des terrasses, avec des balustrades de marbre\ndominant la mer.\nLe texte de Mme Holland est encore erronne, si on le compare\na celui de Mme Verrall, en ce sens que si la description est\ninsuffisante, le nom de l'endroit est donne ; il est done clairement\nreconnaissable.\nII est vrai que Mme Verrall n'est pas allee a Naples et n'a\npas vu le Pausilippe, mais, si le texte de Mme Holland voulait\nF\n\f82 Joseph Maxwell, M.J). [part\navoir le moindre sens, il devait faire allusion a un evenement\nsupranormal ; decrire un endroit connu n'a rien d'extraordinaire\nil fallait done que la description s'appliquat a un endroit inconnu\nde Mme Verrall.\nJe n'attache pas d'importance a l'allusion a Marseille ; Mmes\nVerrall et Holland etaient en correspondance.\nLemergence des allusions a M. Noel a ete determinee chez\nMme Holland par la lecture des textes de Mme Verrall, on\nil est question de \" Tintagel and the sea that moaned,\" etc.\nMme Holland n'avait d'abord pas reconnu la reminiscence, mais\nMile Johnson, deux ans plus tard, communiqua de nouveau\nles vers de Mme Verrall a Mme Holland (6 Fevrier 1908,\nA\nT\nol. XXI., p. 325) qui reconnut Eoden Noel cette fois. Cela\neveilla l'attention de Mile Johnson qui demanda des explica-\ntions :\n\" Did you say Eoden Noel because you remembered that\nyou had had references to him ... or do you think that you\nsubliminally recognised the verses ?\n\"\nEt Mme Holland a repondu que le nom de Eoden Noel\nlui a ete transmis UUpatJiiquement par Mile Johnson.\nII est difficile de prendre cela serieusement, puisque la\nreconnaissance subliminale, certaine dans le cas cite, explique\nles concordances dont on fait des correspondances. Cependant\nMile Johnson se contente de cette explication (Vol. XXI.,\np. 326); Mme Holland a une excellente memoire normale\npour la poesie ; si elle avait lu Eoden Noel elle s'en serait\nsouvenue, et aurait reconnu la source de ses allusions\nComme logique cela laisse ;i desirer ;\nd'ailleurs, l'incident\nabonde en illogismes, et je signalerai la question :\n\" Croyez-\nvous avoir reconnu subliminalement les vers ?\n\" Comment\npeut-on le savoir, si la reconnaissance a ete subliminale, et\nquelle valeur aura une reponse negative ? \" We can only\ninterrogate their supraliminal consciousness,\" dit Mile Johnson,\npage 389.\nC'est dans les textes de Mesdames Verrall et Holland que\nMile Johnson a decouvert le principe des correspondances\noroisees,1\nsur lesquelles s'appuye la croyance a l'intervention\n1\nOn trouve dans la litterature spirite de curieux precedents ;\nvoy. Mile\nF. J. Theobald, \"Similar messages through different mediums,\"' Light, 1881,\n41, 54, 63, 171 ; comparez les messages complementaires recus de Benjamin\nColeman par M. Newton en AmeYique et M. S. Moses ii Londres, Light, 1884,\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 83\nposthume de M. Myers et des membres decedes de la S.P.E.\nLa definition est donnee, p. 375. \"We do not get in the\nwriting of one automatist anything like a mechanical verbatim\nreproduction of phrases in the other ; we do not even get the\nSiime idea expressed in different ways,\u2014as might well result\nfrom direct telepathy ... we get ... a fragmentary utterance\nin one script, which seems to have no particular point or\nmeaning, and another fragmentary utterance in the other, of an\nequally pointless character ; but when we put the two together,\nwe see that they supplement one another, and that there is\napparently one coherent idea underlying both, but only partially\nexpressed in each.\"\nCela exclut la possibility de la telepathie entre personnes\nvivantes, car il est difficile de supposer que la perception\ntelepathique d'un fragment pourrait conduire a la production\nd'un autre fragment, clont le rapport au premier ne sera reconnu\nqu'apres une comparaison attentive.\nLa preuve de la survie a jusqu'ici ete cherchee dans les\nsouvenirs conserves ; ceux-ci ne peuvent etre verifies qu'au\nmoyen des souvenirs d'une autre personne, forcement vivante,\net par consequent cette personne peut etre l'agent inconscient de\nla telepathie. Le controle ne peut songer a communiquer des\nrenseignements sur sa vie actuelle ; on ne pourrait pas les\nverifier, cela est possible pour les vivants et, c'est en cela que\nconsiste la difference fondamentale entre la telepathie provoquee\npar les vivants et les morts.\nLes correspondances croisees perniettraient aux Esprits une\nsorte de telepathie relative a des faits actuels : les ev^nements\ncorrespondants sont inconnus de toute personne vivante puisque\nle sens et la portee des messages demeurent incompris des\nmediums eux-memes, jusqu'au moment ou la comparaison des\ntextes les revelent. La preuve de ces faits contemporains se\ntrouve dans les ecrits et par consequent, la methode employee\ntend a satisfaire toutes nos exigences.\nTelle est la these de Mile Johnson.\nTout cela est une affirmation que l'examen des cas retenus\nne justifie pas. Sur huit cas, faible recolte, Mile Johnson\n54. A ce sujet M. Moses ecrit : \"He (B. Coleman's spirit) gave the evidence\nof a plan, a scheme of work underlying the apparently dissociated phenomena,\nthat marks the interference of a spirit with our world, etc.\"\n\f84 Joseph Max well, M.D. [part\nreconnait que le premier, le texte Selwyn (texte connu de bien\ndes vivants) n'est pas probant. Le second cas, notes de miisique,\npeut-etre de la telepathie simple. Le 4\u00b0, Eoden Noel, comme\nle reconnait a la fin Mile Johnson (p. 387) peut avoir une\nexplication naturelle.\nII reste les cas: (3) \"not in the Electra \" and \"Henry was\nnot mistaken.\" (5) Ave Koma ; (6) Posilippo ; (7) Eheu fngaces ;\n(8) Fawcett.\nLe cas (8) est une coincidence de noms, les personnes designees\npar les automatistes ne sont pas les memes, et les details qui\npermettent a Mme Verrall de reconnaitre sa cousine, Mme\nFawcett sont: (1) une allusion a Broadlands qui concerne\nM. Myers, (2) \" F. a blue jewel.\" C'est insuffisaniment\ndetermine.\nQuant au cas No. 3, il peut servir d'introduction aux corre-\nspondances croisees que signalent les travaux ulterieurement\npublies.\nLe 6 Fevrier Mme Holland essaye d'eerire des mots grecs,\ninintelligibles d'ailleurs (Vol. XXL, p. 310). Le 9, Mme Verrall\ndonne un texte contenant du grec, notamment une citation\nd'Eschyle, Agamemnon, 124-125. Le 19 \"... Ask for the\nvolume . . . She will know.\" Le 20, \"Get her to write\ncukivov a'lXivov and the rest.\"\nLe 21, les deux mediums se rencontrerent dans le bureau\nde Mile Johnson et Mme Verrall fit encore allusion au livre\nque Mme Holland ne connaissait pas ; c'est une traduction\nd'Euripide, par M. Murray. L'ecriture automatique de Mme\nVerrall se trompa done ; il est curieux de noter qu'au meme\nmoment, on jouait a Londres une traduction de YEIectre d'Euri-\npide, par Murray.\nUn texte du 28, ne contient encore aucune allusion intel-\nligible pour Mme Holland. Le meme jour celle-ci donne un\nmessage ou Ton compte 1 71 iddes differentes ; combien de cor-\nrespondances pourraient s'y greffer si Ton suivait la methode de\nMile Johnson ?\nOn y lit \" Not in the Electra. M. will know better.\" C'est\n1'allusion au vers grec, qui en effet n'est pas dans YEIectre de\nSophocle ni dans celle d'Euripide, comme le sait M. (Mme\nVerrall). \" It may be taken to apply to the Greek line quoted\nby Mrs. Verrall for the third time on February 28th. . . . There\n\flxv.] Corresjoondances croisees et la Metliode experimentale. 85\nis a certain point, Mrs. Verrall thinks, in mentioning the Electro.\nin this connexion, because the Electra (of Sophocles or Euripides)\nis equivalent to the second play of the ^Eschylean Trilogy, of\nwhich the Agamemnon is the first ; so that Mrs. Holland's script\nmight be taken to mean : the line is in the Trilogy, but not\nin the second play ( = Electra), which was true.\"\nC'est ainsi qu'on transforme en chose precise une declaration\nambigue. En realite, Mme Holland pouvait dire \" Not in\nthe Electra\u2014M. will know better \" sans se compromettre\nles textes de Mme Verrall contiennent souvent des citations\ngrecques, et il y a une infinite de chances pour que ces citations\nsoient empruntees a d'autres sources que YElectre ; 1'idee de\ncette derniere piece se presentait d'ailleurs toute seule a, l'esprit,\npuisqu'on la jouait a Londres. Tout cela est conforme, comme\nprocedes et sources, aux lois psychologiques les plus communes\ndes ph^nomenes automatiques.\nEien ne permet d'admettre l'interpretation de Mme Verrall.\nOn ne trouve pas la moindre indication de l'idee de trilogie.\nLes allusions de Mme Holland, impliquees dans le mot Electra,\nsont indeterminees.\nCe n'est pas sur des interpretations pareilles que Ton peut\netablir un raisonnement scientifique. Malheureusement, le mode\nde raisonnement s'est generalise. Mile Johnson montre que le\nprincipe des correspondances croisees est contenu explicitement\ndans les textes de Mme Verrall : l'invention de l'interpretation\nanalogique ou symbolique revient encore a cette automatiste.\nIII.\nLe rapport de M. Piddington marque un pas en avant dans\nl'application de cette singuliere methode.\nCe rapport resume les concordances observes entre Mme\nPiper, Mile et Mme Verrall et Mme Holland. 74 seances\nde l'une, 63 textes de Mme Verrall, 17 de Mile Verrall, 38\nde Mme Holland sont analyses. On voit combien cela repre-\nsente de mots susceptibles de concorder. On a chez les trois\ndernieres, plus de 2.500 centres d'associations explicites, ou\nnnplicites. Quant aux idees exprimees par Mme Piper, il est\ndifficile de les evaluer k moins de plusieurs milliers.\n\f86 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [PAItT\nM. Piddington a trouve, dans cette masse de documents, 24\nconcordances seulement dont quelques unes sont complexes. La\nmoisson demeure bien maigre. II est regrettable que les experi-\nmentateurs, sauf Mme Sidgwick, ne nous donnent aucune\nindication sur la proportion des succes aux insucces. Nous\nsavons seulement (Vol. XXII., p. 23) que sur 18 mots choisis\npar les experimentateurs, pour etre transmis, un seul reussit\na l'Gtre.\nLes correspondances croisees signalees par M. Piddington\nconcernent quelquefois des mots si communs, que leur sur-\nvenance a des epoques, meme rapprochees, dans plusieurs textes\nne signifie rien. Tels sont Steeple\u2014Hope\u2014Star\u2014Arrow\u2014Giant\nand Dwarf\u2014Laurel wreath \u2014Violets\u2014Cup\u2014Spirit and Angel-\nMountains, Seas, Lakes, Eivers\u2014Music\u2014Azure, Horizon.\nPour faire la partie belle aux experimentateurs, j'analyserai\nseulement leurs meilleurs cas.\nCelestial Halcyon Days.\nLe 15 Janvier 1907, Myers-Piper pretend avoir donne a\nMme Verrall; \"Celestial Halcyon Days\" (Vol. XXII., p. 103).\nMme Verrall ne se souvenait pas d'avoir lu ces mots\n(qu'elle n'a jamais obtenus en realite). Le 22 Janvier elle ecrivit\nun texte ou figure le mot inusite \" supern \" et Mme Verrall\nse souvint d'avoir eu trois ans et demi auparavant le mot\nsupernal. Le 3 Juillet 1903, elle avait ecrit une communica-\ntion relative a la paix, a la contemplation sur de hauts sommets\net finissant par \" the storm and whirlwind consume the blue\nclear space between the worlds, but the supernal peace is\nundisturbed.\"\n\" The fundamental idea of halcyon days, nous dit-on,\u2014an\ninterval of calm between storms\u2014seems to be represented in\nthe words '\nthe storm and whirlwind consume the blue clear\nspace between the worlds.' The main point of the script,\nhowever, seems to be that while halcyon days in this world\nare transitory, in the celestial world they are unending.\"\nCela suffit aux experimentateurs pour etablir une correspon-\ndance; Mme Verrall avait bien exprime, des 1903, l'idee\nindiquee par le controle.\nEn admettant que le texte de Mme Verrall ait le sens\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Metlwde experimentale. <S7\nallegue, sa citation par Myers-Piper ne prouve absolument rien,\ncar ce texte figure au Vol. XX., p. 64. On y trouve (texte\net note) les mots \" stillness in the air,\" \" peace,\" \" storm and\nwhirlwind.\" Mme Piper connait le memoire de Mine Verrall\n(Vol. XXII., p. 106). L'expression \"halcyon days\" signifie les\njours de calme entre les tempetes du solstice d'hiver, et derive\nde la fable mythologique de Ceyx et Alcyone. Elle est citee\ndans Webster.\nLa source de i'information est normale, \" but even if this\nwas the case,\" dit M. Piddington, \" it is difficult to imagine\nthat auy part of the consciousness of Mrs. Piper, who is\nentirely without classical scholarship, should have summarised\n[Mrs. Verrall's script] in the words '\nCelestial Halcyon Days.'\nCela est au contraire probable ; l'idee de \" celestial \" a son\norigine dans \"the rest of the heaven\" (Vol. XX., p. 64, note);\nles mots de Mme Piper sont une traduction maladroite du\ntexte de Mme Verrall ; un erudit n'aurait pas traduit \" the\nsupernal peace is undisturbed \" par \" Celestial halcyon days.\"\nLes jours halcyoniques etant etymologiquement une periode\nde deux semaines, entre les tempetes du solstice d'hiver, ils\nsignifient un temps de calme passager, idee contraire a celle\nde supern dans le texte de Mme Verrall.\nQuant au moyen par lequel lecriture automatique rappelle\na Mme Verrall son texte anterieur, c'est un cas classique tie\ncryptomnesie, tout au plus.\nOn voit a quoi se red nit ce phenomeue. Les indications\ndonnees par Mme Piper existaient dans un texte imprime\nconnu d'elle. Le rapporteur raisonne comme les personnes qui\nse fondent sur l'apparente incapacite des mediums pour attri-\nbuer leurs messages a des esprits. 1\nCrossing the Bar 2\net Vincident auras ovpavos ukvjulov.\nPrappee de la vraisemblance de la personnihcatioii Myers-\nPiper et de la connaissance que ce eontrole avait des parties\ninedites de son ecriture automatique, Mme Verrall imagina\nune experience cruciale pour demontrer que Myers-Piper avait\nacces aux souvenirs personnels de feu M. Myers. Elle demanda\nau eontrole de traduire les trois mots grecs ci-dessus cites ; ils\n1 Les curieux pourront comparer le texte de Mme Verrall a Spirit Teachings,\nMemorial Edition, pp. ITS, 179 et notamment 180, ligne 1 a 3.\n2\nCe poeme de Tennyson est deux fois cite dans Light, 1890.\n\f88 Joseph Maxwell, M D. [part\nservent d'epigraphe a une ode de Myers a Tennyson, publiee\ndans Fragments of Prose and Poetry. On nous assure que\nMine Piper n'en a pas connaissance. Pour le demontrer M.\nPiddington nous cite (Vol. XXIL, p. 109, footnote) le resultat\nd'une enquete faite ... en Amerique ; mais Mme Piper a pu\nvoir ce livre soit chez les amis de M. Myers, soit au siege\nde la S.P.E. soit dans une bibliotheque. En effet, le fascicule\nLI. des Proceedings, paru en Decembre 1906, contient une\nanalyse de ce livre ; de plus, le rapport de Mile Jobnson\niudique comment Mine Holland a pu consulter sans difticulte\nl'ouvrage de M. Myers dans une bibliotheque de Londres (Vol.\nXXL, p. 246).\nLa reponse complete comportait (1) la traduction ; (2) une\nallusion au poeme de Myers sur Tennyson; (3) une allusion\na Plotin et a la derniere partie de Human Personality.\nLe controle (Vol. XXIL, p. 142) voulut, des le debut, savoir\nce que les mots avaient \" to do with our experiments ?\n\".\nMine Verrall lui apprit ceci \" J think you have spoken of\nthem to 'nte before, or something like them.\" Indication precieuse\nqui fut utilisee.\nDes le lendeinain, Mme Verrall crut trouver des allusions.\nLa phrase \"haven of rest\" fut mentionnee comme pouvant lui\nrappeler des souvenirs de M. Myers. A la fin de la seance\nil y eut des allusions aberrantes a \" Larches \" et \" Laburnum\nqui evoquent chez Mme Verrall l'idee de Tennyson. Ces\nassociations paraissent etre personnelles a cette dame et rien\nn'indique que M. Myers les connut.\nLe rapporteur insiste cependant sur le mot Larch qui figure\ndans un poeme de Tennyson, Ln Memoriam, XCL, ou il y a\nune allusion a lAlcyon (Martin-pecheur) \"the sea-blue bird\nof March.\" Cela rappelle la correspondance \" Celestial Halcyon\nBuys.\"\nII est probable en effet que le controle s'en est servi ; il\na utilise le memoire de Mme Verrall ; cela semble resulter de\nl'equivalence \"rest of Heaven\" (Vol. XX., p. 64, note) et\n\" Haven of Rest.\" L'allusion a \" un siege, sur lequel il s'asseyait\n\"\n(Vol. XXIL, p. 144) rappelle etonnamment \" The corner of the\nseat . . . where he always sect \" : ce qui implique l'idee d'un\nvaste siege (Vol. XX., p. 239).\nNous avons la une origine normale des allusions, a haven\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimental. 89\nof rest ; elles out \u00a3te provoquees par la phrase de Mme Verrall\n\" Vous m'en avez deja parle \" qui limifce le cercle des recher-\nches du controle.\nDe plus, Larches et Laburnum sont indiques comme \" I\nmentioned larches to you before\", ce qui est le rappel d'une\npretendue transmission de M. Myers a Mine Verrall. Laburnum,\necrit Laburman, est depourvu de contexte. Eien ne suggere\nl'idee d'une reponse aux mots grecs.\nM. Piddington examine ensuite les allusions que Mme Verrall\nfait elle-meme a sa question. C'est la une methode deconcer-\ntante, puisque cette dame a pose\" la question et connatt la reponse.\nLes experiinentateurs ne semblent pas s'apercevoir que les con-\ncordances qui pourront survenir entre Mme Verrall et Mme\nPiper ne depasseront pas desormais les possibilites de la tele-\npathic. Je crois inutile de suivre M. Piddington dans ses\ncommentaires sur les reponses que Mme Verrall se fait a\nelle-meme. L'interet de l'experience ne va pas au dela des\nconcordances observes entre les deux mediums.\nLe 6 Fevrier, M. Piddington lit une lettre de Mme Verrall,\nqui felicite les controles des excellentes reponses donnees par\neux les 29 et 30 Janvier. \"Especially F. W. H. Myers seems\nto me to have shown on January 30 that he understood my\nthree Greek words.\" C'est donner une indication au controle\nqui a parle de jours alcyoniques le 30. II se fixe dans le cycle\nd'idees associees a ces mots.\nLe 6 Mars, Myers-Piper annonea qu'il avait fait dessiner a\nMme Verrall un triangle dans im cercle. Ce sione devait\nservir a marquer des correspondances croisees.1\nM. Piddington\ndemande aussitot (Vol. XXII., p. 148) quand ce sigue a ete\ntrace et quels sont les mots transmis en meme temps.

Arthur Hallam. Good-bye,\nMargaret \" ; ce qui indiquerait une correspondance croisee avec\nMme Verrall. Certains d'entre eux sont d'une lecture incer-\ntaine, mais on peut admettre les indications de M. Piddington,\nqui declare que, suivie des mots ci-dessus, la phrase \" cloudless\nsky beyond the horizon,\" est une paraphrase de auras oupavos\nOLKV\/XOOV.\nOn ne peut laisser passer cette affirmation sans reserves.\nLes eubrts tendant a demontrer que l'adjonction de \" beyond\nthe horizon \" a \" sky \" est faite pour traduire ovpavog et le dis-\ntinguer de arjp est de l'imagination pure. Un erudit n'aurait\npas traduit aKu\/mwi\/ par \" cloudless \" (M. Myers le traduit \" Let\nHeaven itself be still \").\nPour justifier l'appropriation de la paraphrase aux mots\ngrecs, on invoque encore la concordance apparente entre les\ntextes de Mine Verrall, etablissant un parallele entre Plotin\net Tennyson, citant In Memoriam et Crossing the Bar et les\nallusions faites par Mme Piper, au stade du reveil, a ces poemes.\nCette association existait dans l'esprit des experimentateurs,\nson emergence dans les ecrits ou les discours de Mme Piper ne\ndepasse done pas les ressources connues de la transmission de\npensee. M. Piddington a trop d'experience pour ne pas\napercevoir cette objection. II y repond ainsi\nJe n'avais pas, a la date du 6 Mars, vu les textes de\nMme Verrall qui, le 11 Mars, developpent le parallele entre\nl'extase telle que la decrivent Plotin et Tennyson.1\nJe ne\neonnaissais que l'allusion faite par Mme Verrall a Crossing\nthe Bar ;\nje n'avais pas distingue la citation d'ln Memoriam\n(6 Mars). Je ne suis done pas l'agent, puisque je n'avais\npas la notion de ces concordances, sauf pour Crossing the Bar}\n1\nMme Verrall publie une dissertation qui semble faire bon march e des propres\nparoles de Tennyson ; le poete s'entrancait en repetant tout bas son nom {Ancient\nSage), il ne demande pas que l'air soit immobile. (''The air that smites his\nforehead is not air but Vision\" Holy Grail.)\n2\nCrossing the Bar est une expression familiere aux spii ites.

If the knowledge shown in Mrs. Piper's trance\nwas obtained from any living person it was from Mrs Verrall\n(Vol. XXII., p. 128, note). L'hypothese qui indigne M. Pid-\ndington, p. 128, devient raisonnable, p. 129, des qu'il s'agit\nde Mme Verrall. \" One must assume either that Mrs. Verrall's\nsubconsciousness had worked out the connection between In\nMemoriam and avros ovpavo? ukv\/uwv some five or six days\nbefore she normally grasped it\u2014a perfectly reasonable hypo-\nthesis,\" etc. Cette hypothese, en effet, est la plus vraisemblable.\nL'analyse de ce cas revele le manque de sang-froid des\noperateurs (Vol. XXII., p. 163).

M. Piddington ajoute \"However want-\ning in definiteness many of the statements . . . were, it is\nimportant to note that Mrs. Verrall at the time took the\nreferences to St. Paul and Swedenborg to be connected with\nher question about the authorship of the Gi-reek words, in\nspite of the fact that at the time she failed to see any\nrelevance in them.\"\nLa conviction des experimentateurs est done faite d'avance.\nBien que Swedenborg et St-Paul soient representee comme des\ncorrespondances deja donnees, on ne s'attache pas aux paroles\ndu controle; on cherche une allusion symbolique et on la trouve\ndans ce fait que ces noms figurent dans le passage ou les mots\ngrecs sont traduits.

D'autant plus que St-Paul a deja\nfait l'objet d'une correspondance croisee.\nL'origine supranormale de ces mots n'est done pas certaine\nencore le doute ne peut-il subsister que pour Swedenborg.\nMais, en admettant menie ce doute comme favorable a la these\ndes experimentateurs, il n'en reste pas moins clair que Mme\nVerrall sait ce que doit etre la reponse, puisqu'elle cherche des\nallusions au passage de Human Personality oil ces noms sont\nmentionnes (Vol. XXII., p. 132). On demeure toujours dans\nle domaine de la telepathie, et il ne semble pas que les experi-\nmentateurs en aieut conscience, car ils estiment que le controle\nniontre \" The vigilance, real or admirably simulated, of a\ntrained experimenter, as anxious as Mr. Podmore himself to\neliminate thought-transference from the sitter.\" On peut juger\ndu bien fonde de cette observation (Vol. XXII., p. 129,\nnote 1).\nEn tons cas, le controle s'apereoit des erreurs qu'il fait ; la\nfroideur de Mme Verrall k la seance du 29 Avril l'avertit\nqu'il se trompe, et apres avoir clos l'incident le 29 en disant,\n\" Amen ! Amen at last\n!\n\", il la rouvre des le lendemain et il\ndit timidement Homere. \" Omer's III lard; it is the name of\nthe author\" (Ar\nol. XXIL, p. 166). Mile Johnson cache mal\nsa surprise, mais le controle persiste dans son absurde reponse,\nqu'il renouvelle a l'arrivee de Mme Verrall, et il exprime\nl'opiniou que sa reponse aux mots grecs est complete (p. 167).\nMme Verrall laisse voir son desenchantement ;\npas de felicitations\ncette fois, mais, des reponses clairement mecontentes.

Homere, Ylliade, Pa transforme en Platon et Socrate\nsont tres appropries, parce que, dans le Criton, Platon raconte la\nvision de Socrate ; une femme vetue de blanc lui apparait et\nlui dit un vers de Ylliade d'Homere. La preuve resulte des\nrecherches de Mme Verrall ; son ecriture automatique porte le\nler Mai, \"Eagle soaring cd>ove the tomb of Plato.\" C'est une\nphrase du passage cherche de Human Personality ; la il est\nquestion de Swedenborg, Dante, St-Paul ; dans les 33 dernieres\npages, le mot Vision avec une majuscule est employe deux fois\n1\n;\nla premiere a l'occasion de la vision de Socrate, la seconde fois\na propos de Plotin. Cela parait decisif a Mme Verrall. Seule\nune intelligence familiere avec les deux derniers chapitres du\nlivre pouvait voir une connexion entre la vision de Socrate et\ncelle de Plotin.\nOn est un peu deconcerte par tant de subtilite, on perd de\nvue le texte, et on ne voit pas les erreurs de fait qui sont a\nla base de l'ingenieuse construction de Mme Verrall et de\nM. Piddington. On ne se rend pas compte d'une chose bien\nsimple. Myers-Piper repond a tort et a travers. Homere,\nSocrate, Pa, sont donnes comme le nom de l'auteur des mots\ngrecs, il n'est pas question de vision, ni de Human Personality ;\nMyers cherche k nommer l'auteur. M. Piddington n'a pas le\ndroit de preter aux mots du controle un sens manifestement\netranger au contexte.\nD'ailleurs l'assimilation est fantaisiste. La vision de Socrate\nn'a rien de commun avec l'extase, ni avec ses conditions\natmospheriques. L'extase, consciente et philosophique de\nPlotin, n'est pas l'extase somnambulique, ni meme mystique\nreligieuse proprement dite. La vision est cliniquement une\nhallucination sensorielle ; or la philosophie mystique en-\nseigne que le caractere de l'intuition directe, survenant dans\nl'extase, est d'etre un phenomene de l'entendement, presque\ndepouille d'elements sensoriels. II peut y avoir des extases\nsans vision, comme des visions sans extase.\nLa discussion de Mme Verrall peut etre ainsi resumee : si\nnous negligeons le sens direct des reponses de Myers nous\ntrouvons qu'il cite, le 29, trois noms qui figurent page 291\nx\nVoy. Vision, ainsi ecrit par M. Myers, dans d'autres circonstances, Journal,\nVol. IX., p. -290.\n\f94 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [PAKT\nde Human Personality, qu'il cite, le 30, Pa (pris pour Platon),\nSocrate et Homere cites egalement dans les derniers chapitres\ndu livre.\n1\nDone, il fait allusion a ce livre, et il fait allusion a\nl'Extase parce que Swedenborg, Dante et St-Paul sont des\nextatiques, et que, le livre parle de la vision de Socrate et\nd'un vers de Ylliade. Que d'allusions possibles avec ce\nsysteme\nMme Verrall oublie que e'est elle qui a suggere Dante,\nauquel le controle ne songeait pas ;\nque e'est elle qui complete\nl'allusion au nom de Swedenborg ;\nque St-Paul est une\ncorrespondance recente, qu'enfin les noms de Socrate et de\nPa ... ne sont que des tatonnements provoques par son\nattitude.\nLe nom de Plotin ne fut donne que le 6 Mai, a Mine\nSidgwick, qui l'attendait, car Mme Verrall avait deja indique\na Mile Johnson et k Mme Sidgwick qu'il y avait des allusions\na Human Personality dans les seances du 29 et du 30 Avril,\net qu'il ne manquait plus que le nom de Plotin.\nEn realite, l'experience a dure du 15 Janvier au 6 Mai,\npres de quatre mois ; Mme Verrall et les autres experimentateurs\nconnaissaient les reponses cherchees. Elles out ete obtenues\npeniblement, avec des erreurs grossieres et prolongees ;\njamais\nla traduction exacte des mots grecs n'a ete donnee, les experi-\nmentateurs ont signale par leur attitude les erreurs du controle\nqu'ils ont inconsciemment guide. Sur ces faits M. Piddington\nse fonde pour assurer que \" Myers-Piper gives various answers\n. . . all intelligent and all but one provably correct. . . .\nBesides this, Myers-Piper shows that he knows that Myers-\nVerrall had previously shown knowledge of his (MyersP )\nanswer. . . .

Parce qu'il y est dit : Marthe devint\ncomme Marie et Lia conmie Rachel. En effet (Vol. XXII.,\npp. 265-268), il est question de Lia et Eachel au XXVIP\nchant du Punjatoirc, et au chant XXVIII.,\nqui suit, on voit\nune allusion a la traversee de l'Hellespont par Xerxes !\nIci encore il suffit d'un nom on deux, banals d'ailleurs car\nles episodes de Marthe et Marie, de Lia et Eachel sont du\nclassique tres use, pour que Ton s'autorise a retenir comme\nallusion implicite tout incident figurant, non plus dans le meme\nchant, raais dans le meme poeme.\nEn realite, il n'y a qu'une idee clans le texte de Mme\nHolland, l'identification des contraires, qui est deux fois indiquee\ndans le memoire de Mme Verrall, pp. 129 et 131 (Vol. XX.).\n(11) (12) (13) Est et West sont des banalites. Leur\napparition a des intervalles de 15 a 20 jours dans diffcrents\ntextes ne signiiie rien, on trouve ces mots a chaque instant.\nOn voit dans Proc, Vol. XX., p. 3 92, un liste d'allusions a\nEast, dans les textes de Mme Verrall, liste d'ailleurs incomplete.\n(14) (15) L'identification de l'Est et de l'Ouest et des\ncontraires a son origine dans Proc.,, Vol. XX., pp. 129 et 131.\nLa citation Verrall du 8 Avril est :\n\" The words were from\nMaud, but you did not understand. Eosy is the east, and so\non.\" Elle ne peut faire allusion au texte de Mme Holland\ndu 27 Mars \"Birds in the high hall Garden, not Maud Sylvia,\"\nquelle ne connaissait pas normalement ; l'id^e de Maud est\nexplicite dans le texte Holland.\nM. Piddington, constatant l'erreur de citation (le vers est Eosy\nis the West), y signale une correspondance croisee antithetique\n(sic) avec \" Light in West \" dit quelques heures auparavant\npar Mme Piper. L'antithese est ingenieusement effectuee par\nl'erreur de citation dont le but est de souligner le mot important.\nOu arrivera-t-on vraiment si tout devient un argument ? Si\nl'erreur devient une combinaison ingenieuse, utilisable au meme\ntitre que la verite ? Si la concordance resulte non seulement\ndes ressemblances mais aussi des dissemblances ? Enfin si\nl'allusion implicite peut etre justifiee, par les moyens que Ton\nsait ?\nOn peut ajouter que le poeme de Maud est deux fois cite\"\npar Mme Verrall (Vol. XX.) et que les vers \" Come into the\nG\n\f98 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\ngarden Maud, for the black bat, night, has flown,\" etc., sont\ndans Sesame and Lilies de Buskin (\u00a7 94). lis ont ete utilises\ndeja dans la correspondance Eheu fugaces entre Mmes Verrall\net Holland (Vol. XXI., p. 297).\n(17) Orion est une banalite (Mine Holland, 8 Avril).\n(18) Aphrodite est encore une banalite mythologique.\n(19) Cytheree (qui constitue sans doute la correspondance\navec Aphrodite dit le 8 Avril par Mme Piper au reveil) se\ndivise en Cytheree deesse, et Cytheree planete. On y trouve\ndes allusions implicites, parce que : (a) la deesse Aphrodite,\nc'est Venus ou Cytheree, (b) l'allusion faite par Mme Holland\nle meme jour a Lia et Rachel iraplique une allusion au XXVIP\nchant du Purgatoire, ce qui implique une allusion au vers on\nTon voit \" C'etait je crois l'heure ou Cytheree,\" etc.; done c'est\nune reference implicite a Cytheree que de dire Lia et Rachel\n(Vol. XXII., pp. 265, 266).\n(20) La riviere du Lethe et la Montagne du Purgatoire\nsont des lieux communs. Ici, nous trouvons une extraordinaire\napplication de la methode d'interpretation symbolique.\nLe 6 Avril 1907 Mme A^errall ecrit un texte (Vol. XXII.,\np. 237) ou l'idee de peinture est quatre fois r6p6Ue, \"the\npainting of Letherbridge . . ., Lether bridge. . . . The water\n. . . gains volume as it rushes to the sea ... a broadening river\nby the storied mount, an open lake beside the lawns of LEA.\"\nLa savante automatiste recommit le Lethe dans la peinture\ndu pont de Lether et le Purgatoire de Dante aux mots \" La\nmontagne etagee \" et Lea.\nM. Piddington dit, page 263: \"I took Mrs. Verrall's script\nof April 6th, ... to be . . . various ways of expressing one\nidea, namely, the Wordsworth Country. Mrs. Verrall however\nhad placeel another interpretation on her script of Apjril Qth.\"\nCette contradiction n'embarrasse pas M. Piddington. II admet\nson interpretation et il ad met aussi celle de sa collaboratrice.\n\" That ... a script should possess a double reference will not,\nI hope, seem to be an improbable hypothesis \" (Vol. XXII.,\np. 264).\nEt voila ce qu'on nous propose serieusement. Symboliquement,\nle texte de Mine Verrall fait allusion au Purgatoire, ou il\ny\na une riviere et une montagne, et au pays de Wordsworth, le\ndistrict des lacs, ou il y a des rivieres, des montagnes, des collines\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 99\net des lacs, signalement qui s'applique a tous les pays montagneux.\nOn remarquera le procede d'interpretation des experinientateurs.\nMme Verrall ne retient que \" Lether,\" quelle corrige en Lethe,\n\"storied mount,\" et \"Lea\" qu'elle prend pour Leah.

M. Piddington au\ncontraire, poursuivi par son idee, ne releve que les details\nalpestres. La peinture et le pont passent inapercus.\nEst-ce une analyse serieuse ? Ne doit-on pas, en etudiant\nun texte, tenir compte de tous ses elements, sans exception ?\nC'est ainsi qu'on en arrive a nous presenter des identifications\nassez fantaisistes pour que les experts nous disent l'un : c'est\nle Purgatoire de Dante, l'autre c'est le pays pittoresque de\nWordsworth, et qu'ils se mettent d'accord pour nous dire\nserieusement : c'est tous les deux.\nBien entendu, il y a encore une correspondance croisee avec\nle Purgatoire et le Lethe. Tout h l'heure les mots Lia et\nEachel signifiaient implicitement Cytheree ; ils ont signifie Geryon,\nle mephistophelique ; ils signifient maintenant, toujours implicite-\nment, la montagne du Purgatoire, oil Dante voit Lia en reve,\net le Lethe qui coule le long du Purgatoire.\n(21) Paradiso, Paradise.

Piddington a oublie une importante correspondance entre Mme Holland,\nMme Verrall et Mme Piper (Vol. XXIL, pp. 228, 262. 269). Elle explique\nmeme Roland et les Val, allusions demeurees insondables. Roland, c'est le\npreux mort a Roncesvalles ou Roncevaux, comme le montre les Val ; inversion\n\f100 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\n(22) Purgatorio est une correspondance implicite resultant\n1\u00b0 de la mention de \"painting of lether bridge,\" etc., parce\nqu'elle signifie le Lethe et implique le Purgatoire (Mine Verrall,\n6 Avril), et 2\u00b0 des mots Leah et Rachel (Mme Holland, 8 Avril)\nqui signifient le Purgatoire (Vol. XXII., pp. 227, 262, 265)!\n(23) Le 29 Avril, au reveil, Mme Piper (Vol. XXII., p. 279)\ndit \" Dante's Inferno.\" M. Picldington oublie de nous apprendre\nqu'il a 6te question de Dante plusieurs fois au cours de la seance\nde ce jour (Vol. XXII., p. 163). Le mot Dante a 6U introduit\npar Mme Verrall. On voit combien son Emergence est facile-\nment explicable. Or YEnfer du Dante est une ceuvre que\nTon peut connaitre de nom, sans etre un lettre. La correspon-\ndance est encore ici assuree par l'utile Geryon, toujours celui\nde Mephistopheles.\n(24) (25) Daffodils (narcisses) se divise en deux especes\ncelle de Tennyson, dont le tableau ne nous indique pas les\ncorrespondances ; elles resultent sans doute des allusions a\nMaud (Vol. XXII., p. 273) ou Ton voit ces vers:\nThe shining daffodil dead and Orion low in his grave.\nAnd the shining daffodil dies, etc.\nCela conduit aux narcisses de Wordsworth, cites au reveil\nle 17 Avril par Mme Piper (Vol. XXII., p. 233), et impli-\ncitement rappeles par les allusions k Wordsworth \" I wandered\nlonely, etc.\" (Vol. XXII., p. 232, Mme Piper) et par l'allusion\naux montagnes, lacs et rivieres (et Purgatoire) du texte de\nMme Verrall (6 Avril, p. 263).\n(26) Wordsworth Country, resulte de ce texte, implicitement\nsuivant M.

Piddington a pose une question en latin, dont les controles\nn'ont jamais pu donner une traduction exacte et 1\n'experience\na dure cinq mois ! Ce fait a deja ete signale : mais M.\nPiddington enregistre comme un succes une reponse interpreted\nsymboliquement par lui, negligeant l'inexactitude des reponses\ndirectes. C'est un procede difficile a accepter.\nComme pour les mots grecs, la reponse aux mots latins est\ndonnee par Mme Verrall, qui connait la question. Cette\nexperience, destinee a demontrer Taction d'une intelligence\nexterieure aux mediums, devient une simple transmission de\npensee, car tout le monde va chercher a faire repeter par\nMme Piper ce qua deja dit Mme Verrall.\nC'est M. Piddington qui aurait decouvert le premier la\nreponse que sa collaboratrice avait ecrite. C'est un passage\nde Browning (AM Vogler) \" Out of three sounds he frame,\nnot a fourth sound, but a star,\" 1\net c'est une reponse\nsymbolique a la question :\n\" donnez-nous par deux mediums\ndifferents deux communications, entre lesquelles aucune con-\nnexion n'apparaisse, donnez ensuite une communication par un\ntroisieme medium, revelant le lien latent existant entre les\ndeux premieres.\"\nL'appropriation du symbole ne signifie rien, etant donnees\nl'erudition et l'intelligence de Mme Verrall. La convenance\ndes allusions de Mile Verrall ne doit pas etre retenue\ndavantage, pour des raisons evidentes. Seules les reponses\ndu controle peuvent interesser.\n1\nCes vers servent d'epigraplie a une conference de M. Podniore, \"Miracles\nand Prophecies,\" Light, 1882, 151.\n\f102 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nLe 27 Fevrier, \u2014 la question etait posee depuis le mois de\nDecembre, \u2014 il donne une traduction, encore fausse, que M.\nPiddington accueille fort mal.\n\" J.

Le controle\nn'a meme pas eu a chercher, on lui a donne tous les\nrenseignements.\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experirnentcde. 103\nM. Piddington le sait bien. II dit en note, que s'il a\ndonne une indication en disant vous pouvez r^pondre en deux\nmots, il ne l'a pas fait expres ;\ncpue d'ailleurs la reponse est\nen trois mots. II suffit de lire le texte pour voir que le\ncontrole est embarrasse : il est presse par M. Piddington et\nil choisit celle de scs correspondances qui se rapproche le plus\nde Vindication. A cette epoque, il sait que quatre correspon-\ndances ont reussi. Library, my own name, et Mmc Sidgwick\nn'est pas la reponse au message latin, c'est evident. Kestent\nArrow, qui n'a qu'un mot, et Browning, Hope, Star, ou A\ntriangle within a circle ; mais ceci est le signe convenu des\ncorrespondances, et n'est pas un mot. C'est une figure. Par\nconsequent Myers-Piper ne pouvait pas choisir autre chose que\nBrowning, Hope, Star, qui etaient indiques.1\nMais M. Piddington demandait deux mots ; aussi Myers-Piper\nne lui donne que Hope et Star, et c'est sur l'insistance de\nl'experimentateur (Well? Yes? p. 336) qu'il ajoute Browning.\nCela prouve qu'il ne comprenait pas pourquoi sa reponse etait\njuste, car le nom de Browning est la partie la plus importante\nde cette reponse. Hope et Star se trouvent dans beaucoup de\npoemes.\nDe semblables tatonnements se sont produits pour arriver au\ntitre du poeme. Le controle est si pen fixe qu'il cite d'abord\nle poeme de Browning My Star (p. 337), puis laborieusement\nJEvelyn Hope ; ce qui indique clairement la nature de ses opera-\ntions mentales. Le controle George Pelham explique les erreurs\npar la stupidiU de Hector (p. 3-40) qui ne sait pas le latin\n(p. 314).*\nLe poeme de Browning qu'il a en vue est celui qui contient\nHope et Star. Eeponse peu intelligente car plusieurs poemes\nde Browning contiennent ces mots communs.\n1\nCela n'empeche pas que Myersp a essaye aussi le triangle efc le cercle,\npour completer sa reponse, quoiqu'en dise M. Piddington. Comparez Vol.\nXXII., pp 345 et 343. Pourquoi a-t-on supprime' dans la question, p. 345,\nles mots \"I was going to add to a poem,\" cites p. 74?\n2\nLes controles de M.

Comment ce prelat a-t-il oublie le latin '!\n(Light, 1896, p. 267).\nPrudens est Plotin (Light, 1896, 291). Ces elements ont leur importance quand\non vent raisonner sur l'identite des contr<31es spirites de Madame Piper, ils\nrendent bien suspectes les personnifications qu'ils representent.\n\f104 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nOn lui a fait comprendre, par la froideur de l'accueil, que les\nreponses My Star et Evelyn Hope ne sont pas bonnes (Vol.\nXXII., pp. 340, 347) ; il cherche autre chose, tente Andrea del\nSarto, autre poeme de Browning (Vol. XXII., p. 344), et s'accroche\nk la coiTespondance reussie \" Triangle et cercle,\" qui le conduit\na Ring (p. 345) \"qui le fait penser a un poeme.\" Evidemment\nMyersp pense k essayer The Pang and the Booh, ce qui explique\nsa reponse\nli\nnot exactly to a poem . . . but it suggested a poem.\"\nC'est en effet un titre general comprenant divers poemes, notam-\nment Pompilia et Giuseppe Caponsacchi.1\nM. Piddington ecarte\ncette idee en disant, k propos de Ring et Circle, \" The Latin\nmessage does not refer.\" Ce qui eclaire le controle ; le cercle\nne devient plus qu'un simple lien d 'association (p. 346).\nTenace, M. Piddington (13 Mars) insista pour avoir une\nreponse claire ; il ne l'obtint pas. Mine Sidgwick dirigea les\nseances suivantes ; le controle manifesta la plus complete igno-\nrance du poeme oil il avait trouve la reponse donnee a Mme\nVerrall. Le 20 Mars, il parle d'un poeme de Browning oil les\netoiles et la vie se rencontrent ; il bat les buissons et au lieu\nde repondre, interroge : vous comprenez bien de quel poeme je\nparle ?\n\u2014 Oui repond Mme Sidgwick. Au sujet d'etoiles.\nLe controle ne quitte pas cet ordre d'idees et parle le\n8 Avril d'un poeme de Browning aux Etoiles, il y mele Words-\nworth, et essaye, peut-etre, \" Pisgah-Sights \"\n(\nli\nPi ... it begins,\nwith P. and Sai. P. is right.\" Pisgah-Sights II finit par \" Star\nthat now sparkiest.\" (II y a aussi un poeme intitule Pippa\npasses.)\nMme Sidgwick corrige le controle en lui apprenant que P.\nest erronne (Vol. XXII., pp. 362-363). Eel est alors propose\n(\"A Lovers' Quarrel,\" \"Herve Rid,\" \" Martin Relph \"). Fatigue de\nces efforts inutiles, le controle ne dit plus rien de bon ;\nil revient\na la question le 17 Avril, et rappelle sa mauvaise reponse \"I\nwander lonely,\" \" lonely wandering star \" et propose indirecte-\nment : Confession (poemes de Browning : Confessions, The Con-\n1\nOu.

Le controle voit son erreur et bat la campagne. II\nrevient a Pe, Pi, puis a la Saisiaz, clairement resumee ainsi\n\" the poem in which he was left alone and later it all came to\nhim.\"\nLe 22 Avril il propose indirectement \" Saul,\" autre poeme de\nBrowning, en citant \" as star follows star.\"\nEnfin il approche du but ; il a essaye, toujours indirectement\nRabbi ben Ezra; Death (sous la forme grecque Thauatos); Tyrannus\n(Insfaas Tyrannus) (17 Avril); passes (Pippa passes 1 8 Avril);\nMay (23 Avril); Spirit and Angel (The guardian angel, 8 Avril,\nnettement associe a la reponse au message latin, voy. p. 220).\nOr, dans le \" Pocket volume \" de Browning (London, Smith\nElder, 1910) on remarque (fin de la page vi, et commencement\nde la page vii) les titres suivants : The guardian Angel, Abt\nVogler, Rabbi ben Ezra, Confession, May and Death, Pisgah Sights,\ntitres tous plus ou moins clairement proposes, et mal accueillis.\nEestait cependant Abt Vogler. Mme Piper, le 2-1 Avril dit, en\nreponse aux mots \" quel est le poeme \"\u2014\" Vol is right.\"\nEeponse inexacte, mais qui contient quelques lettres du mot\nVogler (Vol. XXII., p. 286) ;\nMme Sidgwick encourage le controle,\nqui se risque plus tard a une approximation plus precise, \" vol\ngar\" (p. 371).\n\" I think I see,\" dit Mme Sidgwick.\nLe controle continue, \" vol, ...

Voy. la note\nsuivante.\n\f106 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nEt c'est Mme Sidgwick qui dit Vogler.\nLe controle a essays quatorze reponses au moins et est arrive\na AM Vogler probablement en se rappelant vaguement une table\ndes matieres ; il y a ete guide' d'ailleurs pas a pas, mais il y est\narrive sans comprendre pourquoi, car il ne sait pas encore on se\ntrouve la reponse contenue dans le poeme. En voici la preuve.\nDes le 24 Avril, Mme Verrall demande des precisions (p.\n376); Myers-Piper, apres beaucoup de banalites, cite un passage\nqui devait etre naturellement choisi par quelqu'un comprenant\nle message latin de la nianiere inexacte, dont Myers-Piper et\nG. Pelham ont donne des echantillons. Leurs traductions\nfmissaient par ces mots :\n\" nous convaincre de votre survie.\"\nC'est sur une idee de cette nature que se fixe le controle et\nil cite, assez mal d'ailleurs, les vers ou il est parle. des morts\nqui ont passe par le corps et sont partis, mais qui reviennent,\nune fois encore, respirer dans un vieux monde, etc. (ler Mai,\np. 379); Myers-Piper est clone logique avec lui-meme, il declare\nque c'est le passage (p. 386), auquel il a fait specialement\nallusion et qu'il a essaye de transmettre. II s'en souvient\nspecialement comme ayant ete, l'objet d'un reference dans les\ntextes de Mme Verrall ; ces affirmations sont accueillies sans\nenthousiasme par Mme Sidgwick, qui sinformera aurpres de Mme\nVerrall (p. 387) revelant, par cela seul, que ce n'est pas la\nreponse attendue ; celle-ci n'aurait, en effet, exige aucune\nverification.\nA la seance suivante, Myers-Piper essaye autre chose, comme\nquelqu'un qui a reflechi au poeme et s'efforce de deviner le\nvers ; le mot hope n'est pas dans le texte ; star y est deux\nfois, dans la stance IV., dont le vers tronque a et\u00a3 accueilli\nfroidement, et dans la stance VII. dont on attend la citation.\nC'est naturellement encore a ce dernier que pensera le controle\net c'est si bien au mot star qu'il pense, que le mot sound n'est\npas prononce ; mais Mme Sidgwick hesite dans la lecture\n(p. 388) et le controle craint de se tromper ; il passe alors a une\nautre idee, se rapprochant de la seconde proposee par lui, et\nil fait allusion au vers :\n\" And the emulous heaven yearned\ndown, made effort to reach the earth, As the earth had done\nher best, in my passion, to scale the sky.\" II insiste la-dessus,\nrepete plusieurs fois sky, qui a fait partie d'une correspondance\ncroisee anterieure, et passion ;\nMme Sidgwick lui dit alors qu'il\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 107\nn'a pas besoin de continuer ; le controle persiste a donner ciel\net passion corame caracteristiques du vers : c'est encore l'investi-\ngatrice qui lui fait savoir :\n\" The line I wanted was the one\nabout the '\nstar.'\n\"\u2014\" Yes I know,\" repond le controle, \" but I\nam only explaining in my passion to reach you as clear as\nthe sky. I quote if out of, if instead of the fourth framed a\nstar.\" Et il insiste encore sur etoile et revient a son explica-\ntion ingenieuse de la fausse citation concernant passion.\nLe mot \"sound\" (son), fut donne au stade de reveil.\nVoila le resume d'une des plus belles performances du\ncontrole ; il est visible qu'il a tatonne, battu les buissons et\nete finalement guide par les experimentateurs eux-memes. Les\nextraits que j'ai cites montrent les fautes operatoires commises,\net l'expose de l'experience revele son inutility complete. La\nreponse etait connue de tout le monde, et la seule chose qui\npuisse surprendre c'est de voir la difficulte eprouvee a la donner.\nLe succes ne pouvait en tous cas rien prouver de plus qu'une\ntransmission ou une lecture de pensee.\nEnfin, et c'est la le plus grave reproche que Ton puisse\nfaire aux experimentateurs, il n'est pas permis de dire serieuse-\nment qu'une traduction symbolique doive etre preferee k une\ntraduction litti'rale. Quand les erreurs de celle-ci sont mani-\nfestes, elles ne sauraient disparaitre parce qu'une reponse en\nsymboles est donnee.\nCe n'est pas tout. Si Ton se reporte a la page 415 du\nmemoire de M. Piddington, on constate des faits de nature h\nrendre ties suspectes les reponses de Mme Piper. La bonne\nfoi de ce remarquable sujet est hors de cause, mais est-elle\nresponsable de ses trances ? De ses automatismes ? J'aurai a\nexaminer cette question plus loin ;\nje signalerai simplement\nles faits suivants\nMme Piper dit a Mme Sidgwick, qu'elle n'avait pratiquement\nrien lu de Browning, qu'elle croit aussi eloigne que Shakespeare\n(7 Mai). Le lendemain elle a r^flechi : M. Stead lui a envoye\nun choix de poesies de Browning ;\nMinerva, la plus jeune des\ndemoiselles Piper a quelques volumes de ce poete.\nLe 26 Mai, Mile Keid, qui habitait avec Mme Piper, dit\nl'avoir vu parcourir un volume de Browning appartenant\na Minerva. II y avait environ un mois de cela. C'est le\n24 Avril que le poeme est cite (p. 415).\n\f108 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nLe 29 Mai, Mme Piper dit a Sir Oliver Lodge qu'elle\ncommit Evelyn Hope, the Flight of the Duchess ; elle ne connalt\npas Abt Vogler que Lodge vient de lui lire. Elle a une belle\nedition de Browning chez elle en Amerique. Les demoiselles\nPiper cependant ont appris Abt Vogler a la pension (p. 416).\nLe rapporteur ne fait aucun commentaire sur ces faits qui\nauraient cependant merite une discussion s^rieuse.\nL'emergence occasionnelle d'etats sonmambuliques larves est\nune hypothese dont les investigateurs ne paraissent pas avoir\neu le soupgon.\n11 en est de meme de la memoire latente. A lire leurs\nrapports, on se persuade qu'ils sont peu au courant des\nphenomenes de cryptomnesie.\nPar exemple, M. Piddington (Vol. XXIV., p. 17) cite comme\npreuve de la ressemblance des controles Myers avec le veritable\nMyers, une serie de concordances entre les automatismes et\nles ecrits de cet auteur. La prudence commande de considerer\nces ressemblances comme 1'indication d'une origine normale.\nCe sont des souvenirs latents, tres naturels chez des personnes\nfort au courant de l'oeuvre de M. Myers.\nM. Piddington l'admet (Vol. XXIV., p. 19), mais il insiste\nsur le caractere suprauormal de l'erudition classique de Mme\nPiper, qui s'interesse peu aux choses litteraires. Examinons\ndone les connaissances litteraires des controles Piper.\nC'est Mme Verrall qui a pris soin d'analyser ce point. II\nconvient de noter qu'aucun des investigateurs ne s'est preoccupe\ndes acquisitions que Mme Piper avait pu faire dans des lectures,\nailleurs que chez elle : revues, livres, journaux, ou dans des\nconversations. Et il y a un detail qui est de nature a retenir\nl'attention. M. Hodgson avait le gout de la poesie et aimait\na declamer des vers (Vol. XIX., p. o70). Peut-on savoir ce\nqu'il a lu a Mme Piper dans sa longue collaboration avec elle ?\nM. Myers declamait aussi des vers pendant les seances.\nII y a la des possibility sans nombre pour le jeu de la\nmemoire latente.\n11 est impossible de fournir la preuve de l'ignorance de Mme\nPiper ; ce n'est pas en causant avec elle que i'iiivestigateur\nprudent peut se renseigner, comme le fait M. Dorr (p. 45) ;\ncelui-ci se contente de dire qu'il avait \" found in general talk\nthat Mrs. Piper knew nothing of Milton's, but Paradise Lost.\"\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode expdrimentale. 109\nII lui lit un extrait de Comus, facile a reconnaitre, car c'est le\nmorceau classique \" Sabrina fair, etc.,\" cite dans les Anthologies\n(Gems, 412); Comus avait un interet particulier pour le groupe\ndes investigateurs, car on le jouait a Cambridge cette annc'e\n(V. Vol. XXIV., p. 199); Mme Piper a-t-elle ignore ce detail?\nQuant a lerudition du controle, en voici des specimens : Le\n31 Mars on lui lit la traduction &'Agamemnon. \"Zeus a\nordonne que Ton n'arriverait a la sagesse que par la triste\nroute de la souffrance, etc.\" Myers dit qu'il comprend, et com-\nmente ce vers, d'apres Hodgson, de la maniere puerile et\nincorrecte que voici :\n\" Troubles and trials, and the better you\ngo through them, the better your [life] here ; and if you don't\ndevelop, it's your own fault \"\n(p. 47).\nII faut 15 jours a Myers-Piper pour reconnaitre la traduc-\ntion de son frere, et il en commente le sens comme on sait.\nOn a un exemple du parti pris de Mme Verrall dans son\nresume, p. 52. II faut l'etudier. Elle omet d'indiquer les\ndetails suivants :\n\" 0 Zeus, troubles and trials \" sont dans le\npassage anterieurement lu a Mrs Piper (drear road of Pain) ;\n\"He'd sing of the Odes\" ne veut pas dire \"great chorus\"', \"wrote\nthree plays \" veut dire a e'crit trois pieces et non pas \" trilogie \"\n;\nEschyle a ecrit environ 70 tragedies et nous en possedons\nsept. Mme Verrall se contente trop facilement d'a peu pres.\nMeme ignorance au sujet d'Ajax et d'Ulysse, qui se rattachent\nau cycle des allusions empruntees a Ovide. Ajax, Ulysse et\nl'idee de bateau sont associes dans Metamorphoses, XIII., 5 et\nsuiv. Ajax dit \" Agimv.s . . . ante rates causam et mccum con-\nfertur Ulysses.\" Mais il y a une inintelligence complete du\ncaractere d'Ajax, dont Mme Piper fait un dieu, theorie que\nMme Verrall essaye vainement de justifier (p. 54, note 1).\nParthenon, Pallas Athena, Virgin's chamber, est la para-\nphrase banale des Encyclopedies populaires ; on lit dans\nNuttall's \" Means the chamber of the maiden Goddess, that\nis Athena.\"\nLes incidents de YEne'icle sont encore plus demonstratifs.\nOn demande le 25 Fevi'ier a Hodgson de traduire \" arma\nvirumoue cano \") ce qu'un eleve de dix ans pourrait faire. II\nest oblige d'appeler Myers a, son aide ; ce dernier ne traduit\npas les mots banals et reconnaissables, mais donne le sens\ngeneral des traductions du commencement de YEn&ide.\n\f110 Joseph Maxwell, 31. D. [part\nMme Piper, qui pour netre pas litteraire a cependant appele\nses filles Alta et Minerva, connait vaguement \\'En6ide, mais\ns'embrouille, et dit des inexactitudes que Myers n'aurait jamais\nsugger^es, meme tek'pathiquement. Par exemple Junon est en\ncolere centre Enee qui a bati une ville, elle contribue a detruire\ncette ville, ce qui oblige Enee a s'enfuir (p. 66).\nII n'est pas juste de considerer comme des preuves derudition\nclassique l'association de Didon et d'une fete, de Neptune et\ndu Trident. Ce sont choses trop banales. Neptune calmant\nla tempete est un lieu commun ; e'est dans YEne'ide (I., 135)\nque se trouve le celebre \" Quos Ego !\n\" L'incident fait le sujet\nde nombreux tableaux ou gravures.\nLe \" considerable knowledge \" de Virgile que signale Mme\nVerrall n'existe pas ; e'est une connaissance rudimentaire, mal\ncoordonnee ; elle reproduit les formes de souvenirs rappeles, par\nce que e'est justement de la cryptomnesie, ce qui explique\nles cas ou les souvenirs ont ete opposes aux indications de\nM. Dorr ; enfin les erreurs ne sont pas dues ;\\ l'oubli ni k la\nconfusion, mais bien a une science incomplete et primaire.\nM. Pidclington s'est specialement occupe de l'analyse de\nquelques incidents, notamment les reponses faites k cette\nquestion ;\n\" Que vous rappelle le Lethe ?\n\"\nLe probleme etait le suivant : Des indications sont donnees,\nvisiblement emprunt^es aux Metamorphoses ; ont-elles leur source\ndans les souvenirs de Mme Piper ou sont elles inspirees par\nfeu M. Myers?\nLe premier point repose sur une demonstration negative.\nM. Pidclington nous assure que ni Mme Piper ni M. Dorr\nn'ont In Ovide. Ce dernier en effet l'a demande a Mme Piper,\nqui ignore jusqu'au nom d' Ovide (Vol. XXIV., p. 140). Ayant\nainsi interro\u00b0e le medium et l'investigateur, M. Piddin^ton est\nsatisfait et il se croit en mesure d'affirmer l'ignorance de l'un\net de l'autre (Vol. XXIV., p. 142). Cela fait douter du sens\ncritique de l'experimentateur, car son enquete est absolument\ninutile ; il se renseigne sur la memoire personnelle consciente,\nnon sur la memoire subliminale, la seule interessante. II faut\nnoter d'ailleurs que les demoiselles Piper ont consulte, en\npension, des livres de mythologie ou se trouvent les indications\ndonnees par le medium (Ar\nol. XXIV., pp. 142, 143).\nQu'importe aussi l'ignorance des dames Verrall en ce qui\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. Ill\nconcerne Ovide ? (pp. 121-123). Si la telepathie est possible\npourquoi la limiter aux dames Verrall ?\nD'ailleurs, l'etude des cas rend a peu pros certaine l'existence\nde phenomenes de simple cryptomnesie. Les indications donnees\npar Mine Piper existent dans de nombreux livres, traductions,\netudes mythologiques, dictionnaires varies. M. Piddington ne\nprouve pas et ne peut pas prouver ce fait negatif: Mme Piper\nn'a jamais rien lu ni entendu la-dessus.1\nLe second point qu'il faudrait prouver est l'inspiration due\na l'influence d'un controle Myers dirigeant tous les auto-\nmatistes.\nD'abord, dit M. Piddington, (p. 123), nous observons chez\nMme Piper des precedes comparables a ceux dont Mmes Verrall\net Holland nous ont offert des exemples. La reponse a la\nquestion du Lethe contient des mots discontinus qui paraissaient\ninintelligibles avant la dicouverte de deux passages litteraires\n(Eitiide VI., 703-723 et Mttam. XL etc.) ou ces fragments se\ntrouvent incorpores et ou ils peuvent trouver un lien d'unification\ncoherente.\nLe raisonnement est critiquable ;\nparler de la dScouverte de\ndeux passages aussi connus, est fait pour surprendre, car le\nbachelier qui ignorerait ces passages classiques pourrait etre\nrefuse a ses examens. Le lien entre les allusions de Mme\nPiper et leur source classique existait independamment du\ncontrole Myers, et il faut autre chose que l'enquete inoperante\nde M. Piddington pour demontrer que les nombreuses sources\nd 'information normale doivent etre ecartees.\nSi on examine les quatre exemples cites comme etablissant\nl'existence de ce procede inintelligent d'identification posthume,\nqui consiste a reproduire dans une communication des allusions\nbanales aux manuels de mythologie, ou aux poemes qu'appren-\nnent les ecoliers, on reconnait que M. Piddington presente\ncomme certains, des faits hypothetiques, ou comme supra-\nnormaux, des faits normaux.\nLe ler cas est le mot claviger (Vol. XXIV., p. 124); la\ndtcouverte (!) que ce mot est employe par Ovide dans le sens\nde \" porte-cles \" (Fastes I., 228) et de porte-massue, apprit (a)\nque le texte de Mme Verrall du 25 Mars 1907, se referait\n1\nL'episode de Oeyx est lie a l'origine de l'expression halt\/con days qui joue\nun grand role dans les experiences de Decembre 1906 ;i Juin 1907.\n\f112 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\na Janus, (b) eclaira un texte de Mme Holland du 8 Avril,\n(c) des paroles de Mme Piper du meme jour.\n(a) Claviger est une allusion a Hercule, peut-etre k Janus,\nmais Mme Verrall connait les Fastes (XXIV., 121) sur les-\nquelles elle a fait un cours en 1881 ; elle rappelle ce double\nsens dans son memoire (Vol. XX., p. 61).\nM. Piddington y voit une allusion symbolique a l\n1\nUnion\nde Test et de l'ouest ; mais c'est une interpretation que lui a\ninspire le texte de Mine Holland, selon tout probability.\n(b) Aucune lumiere n'est jetee par le texte de Mme Verrall\nsur celui de Mme Holland, qui indique clairement Identification\ndes contraires, idee qui n'apparait pas dans le texte Verrall.\nCette idee est developpee d'ailleurs dans le memoire de Mme\nVerrall (Vol. XX, pp. 129-131).\n(c) Light in West, auquel fait allusion M. Piddington, ne\nconcorde pas avec le texte Verrall du 25 Mars, qui ne\nl'eclaire pas. II faut de l'imagination pour y voir \" une\ncorrespondance antithetique \" (sic) avec le texte Verrall du\n8 Avril qui porte par erreur \" rosy is the east \" au lieu de\n\" rosy is the west.\"\n(2) Le second cas est la mention de Lia et Eachel clans le\nmeme texte Holland, du 8 Avril. J'ai montre l'abus fait de\nl'allusion implicite dans ce cas.\n(3) Le troisieme est encore dans le texte de Mme Verrall\ndu 8 Avril ; il se confond avec les precedents (identification\ndes contraires).\n(4) L'allusion a Aristophanes' Apology de Browning est\nune coincidence cryptornnesique ; YHercule Furieux d'Euripide\netant justement mentionne dans le volume XX., p. 61, a\nl'occasion du mot clavis, et d'un texte ou le double sens de\nClaviger (Vol. XX., p. 423) est signal e.\n(5) C'est le cas du Lethe, ou les allusions sont encore\nempruntees a un texte imprime.\nAussi, peut-on faire remarquer a M. Piddington que ce\nn'est pas le controle Myers, qui a employe la meme methode (?)\navec les trois mediums, mais M. Piddington, qui trouve\ndes analogies grace k la methode qu'il applique a tous les\ncas : l'interpretation symbolique. Ces procedes paraissent dif-\nfieilement acceptables ; il est impossible de suivre le rapporteur\ndans une discussion dont les points de fait sont aussi douteux.\n\flxv.] Correspondences croise'es et la Methode experimental^. 113\nQuant a sa comparaison des controles Myers avec M. Myers,\nelle me semble aussi peu fondee que possible.\n1\nII est certain\nque M. Myers savait tout ce que les mediums ont dit de vrai\nmais il est non moms certain que ce n'est pas lui qui place\nla course de Marathon dans les jeux olympiques (Vol. XXIV.,\np. 105); qui dit \"latin for sleep\" (detail revelant l'usage\nd'une traduction \" cave of sleep \" et non \" cave of '\nthe god\nsomnus \") ;\nqui met un arc et des Heches dans la main d'Iris ;\nqui ne sait rien d'Ajax ni d'Ulysse ;\nqui ecrit Styx, sticks ;\nqui dit de Pygmalion, \" greek play,\" par association subliminale\navec l'opera moderne de Galathee, ou la piece de Gilbert, etc.\nEn realite, tout ce que Mme Piper debite au sujet du\nLethe et d'Ovide est marque au coin d'associations oniriques\ncryptomnesiques. Si M. Myers inspirait le medium, il n'aurait\npas parle de Pomone, de Janus, de Saturne, d'Olympe, de\nNeptune, d'Ajax, d'Ulysse, de Centaures, de Cyclopes, de Sibylle,\nde Meduse, de Pygmalion. Tout cela est dans les Metamorphoses.\nJanus et Saturne: histoire de Picus (XVI., 1, 320 et s.)\nPomone et garden (XIV., 623); Ajax et Ulysse, bateaux\n(XIII.); Cyclopes et Centaures (XIV, IX., XII); Sibylle\n(XIV.); Neptune, Troie, trident (XL); Meduse (IV, 780 s.),\netc. II n'y a pas d'associations logiques et intelligentes dans\ntout ce \" deballage \" ; les souvenirs des Metamorphoses sont\nderoules pele-mele avec une predominance des liens de contiguiU.\nMme Piper a certainement connaissance des Metamorphoses\nd'Ovide ; cette connaissance a pu disparaitre de sa conscience\nnormale, c'est pour cela que les mots qu'elle prononce sont\nsans association logique et ont tous les caracteres de l'imagina-\ntion onirique. Ce trait est bien marque dans les allusions a\nSibylle, Muses, Graces, Hero, Phyllis, Olympe, Mercure qui\nfigurent dans les poemes de Virgile ; aucun lien raisounable\nn'apparait dans le melange de ces noms disparates.\nII ne faut pas nous presenter comme l'indication d'une\nerudition quelconque (Vol. XXIV., p. 147) l'emploi de Sibylle\nau pluriel, ni l'association d'Icare et d'Anchise ; ce dernier detail\nest du reste convaincant ; il demontre la nature illogique du\nlien entre les noms propres ; ils n'ont qu'une association\nmaterielle de contiguiU (VIe\nchant de YEnSide). Je ne puis\n1 II semble que la famille de M. Myers ait une impression opposee a celle des\nexperinientateurs. (Voy. lettre au Times, citee dans Light, 1908, p. 526).\nH\n\f114 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\ncom prendre qu'on transforme ce caractere onirique en signe\nd'intelligence refk'chie.\nMais les raisonnements de M. Piddington ne reclament aucune\nprecision ; nous en avons souvent la preuve.1\nUn des\nexemples les plus curieux de l'a peu pres scientitique dont se\ncontentent les experimentateurs, se trouve dans les allusions\nque Ton nous montre, dans les textes de Mine Verrall, a l'ode\nd'Horace. Le controle MyersP a cominis pas mal d'erreurs\ndans cet incident, transformant oniriquement Odes en Odesies\net Odyssee (Vol. XXII., p. 381), et n'indiquant jamais claire-\nment l'ode dont il veut parler ; mais M. Piddington n'en est\npas embarrasse. II serait difficile d'embarrasser un dialecticien\nauquel il importe relativement peu que l'allusion soit a la\nreincarnation, comme le pense Mme Verrall, ou a la superiority\nde la vie future comme le croit M. Piddington (Vol. XXII.,\np. 407). Des raisonnements fondes sur des k peu pres aussi\nindi'termines sont Men faibles.\nPour etayer son interpretation de la reponse synibolique\nqu'aurait donnee MyersP en faisant allusion aux poemes\npublics de M. Myers, M. Piddington a cherche, dans les textes\nanciens de Mme Verrall, les mentions directes ou indirectes\nrelatives k l'ode d'Archytas. II en retient une qui inerite\nd'etre examinee. Le 12 Mars 1901, cinq ans plus tot, Mme\nVerrall aurait ecrit adscripta glebis: le 27 Avril ascripta es\nglcbac, o libera animam, etc. (Vol. XXIAr\n., pp. 163, 164). C'est\nla traduction latine de \" earth-bound \"\n; on se demande par quelle\ncombinaison d'associations, Mme Verrall a pu y voir une allusion\na l'Ode d'Horace ? Voici comment elle y est arrivee. Elle\naccepte la traduction proposee par certains commentateurs du\nmot grec eirdpovpos qui existe seulement dans YOdyssSe. II\nest place dans la bouche d'Achille, qui aimerait mieux etre\npaysan travaillant pour un modique salaire chez un homme\npauvre, que de regner sur les ombres. Or le commentateur\napplique une phrase latine employee pour definir un etat social\ndu moyen age, ;t un etat social anterieur de vingt-cinq siecles,\n1 Voy. par exemple Vol. XXIV., p. 12. On trouve une allusion an poeme de\nBrowning \"My Star\" dans ces mots Androsace, Carthusian, Candelabrum. II\nest indifferent a la conclusion que Candelabrum soit une fleur ou un chandelier ;\nandrosace est un noni de genre, on Fapplique a une e\u00abpece (alpine, androsace rubra\nje crois).\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 115\ndans lequel le serf inscrit a la glebe n'existait pas, au moins\na ma connaissance. II n'y avait pas de registres fonciers et\nles droits immobiliers setablissaient par temoignage (voy. par\nexemple la loi de Gortyne 1, 2, 14, 17, 18). L'idee d' \" ad-\nscriptus \" n'est pas inipliquees dans eirdpovpo<; que les diction-\nnaires traduisent par rusticus. L'esclavage d'ailleurs, au temps\nd'Ulysse, n'etait pas compatible avec le salaire dont parle Achille.\nSi je ne me trompe, le commentateur dont Mme Verrall accepte\nla paraphrase commet une erreur juridique et etymologique.\nM. Myers n'aurait pas commis cette derniere, car il connaissait\nbien la langue grecque.\nUne analyse precise des faits conduit a des conclusions fort\ndifferentes de celles que M. Piddington propose (Vol. XXIV.,\np. 168).1\nXon seulement Intelligence automatique n'est pas\ncelle d'un helleniste et d'un lettre, mais on pent montrer qu'elle\nest empreinte des caracteres propres aux operations mentales\noniriques, telles qu'elles apparaissent dans les processus sublimi-\nnaux inferieurs. J'essayerai de le demontrer, pour repondre a\nl'invitation du rapporteur lui-meme.\nJe veux auparavant analyser encore quelques correspondances\nparmi les plus remarquables. J'emprunterai a Mile Johnson\nle cas \" sevens \" dans lequel les nouvelles methodes conduisent\naux resultats les plus imprevus. Je laisserai de cote des\nbanalites comme Janiculum, yellow, blue flowers, church, etc.\nII y a quelques cas de telepathie probable, tel que l'incident\nde la hole de poison oubliee clans le laboratoire des fils de Sir\nOliver Lodge (Vol. XXIV., p. 216). Savonarole est un cas\ninteressant pourtant (ibid., p. 211); Mile Verrall habille les\nchartreux en noir, erreur que n'admet pas Mine Verrall ; elle\nen conclut qu'il y avait d'autres moines dans la procession.\nSur deux ou trois details banals, elle reconnait la procession\ndecrite dans Romola. A la menie epoque, 8 Octobre, Mme\nHolland ecrit \" ask his daughter about the dream\u2014grey monks\nof long ago,\" ce qui n'a rien de commun avec une procession\net fait allusion a un reve. II n'y a done visiblement aucune\nJ\nM. Myers ne penserait pas autrement, si j'en juge par ce qu'il ecrivait\ndans le Journal, S.P.I', aout 1885: \"The gross want of comprehension of the\nsubjects inquired about, and the palpable blunders which the replies contain,\nseem to me to preclude us from regarding the case as affording evidence of\nthe guidance of a scientific spirit.\"\n\f116 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\ncontinuite de conscience entre le controle de Mme Holland et\nceux des dames Verrall ; la concordance assez vague resultant\nde l'allusion banale a des moines ne depasse certainement pas\nles limites d'une coincidence fortuite.\n\"Sevens\" (Vol. XXIV., p. 222) nous transporte dans des\nspheres plus elevees. Sept automatistes font allusion au nombre\nmystique sept, nombre banal, et dont tous les occultistes ont\nabuse. D'abord Mme Piper : M. Dorr lui repete en Avril et\nMai 1908 un quatrain en mauvais latin, que les membres du\nTavern Club de Boston imprimaient sur leurs menus. Hodgson\nen etait membre ; mais comme controle il ne peut donner\nune traduction correcte. II commet des erreurs qui revelent\n1'inHuence de la conscience normale de Mme Piper : par exemple,\nmori est traduit par custom (habitude) et non par mourir. Erreur\nexplicable, a cause de la prononciation, qui rapproche ce mot\nde \" more,\" custom, habit, en latin ; Webster donne, avec la\ntraduction, les expressions courantes anglaises, more Hibernico,\nmore majorum, more suo ;\npropositum est traduit par \" habit\npar simple attraction. Ce contre-sens est utilise comme corres-\npondance croisee, alors que son apparition est explicable\nnormalement.\nDans les vers latins il y a \" angelorum chorus\" que Mme\nPiper traduit par \" Angel band.\"\nLe 8 Mai, au reveil, Mme Piper prononce \"Habit, We are\nSeven, Clock! Tick, Tick, Tick, Stairs.\" Mile Johnson y\nvoit une allusion a un poeme de Longfellow, \" The Old\nClock on the Stairs,\" mais c'est simplemeut une allusion a la\npendule de l'escalier du Tavern Club (see Proc. Vol. XXV.,\np. 298).\nLe 12 Mai \" We are seven\" est attribue a, Wordsworth, mais\nle controle ajoute :\n\" but we were seven in the distance as a\nmatter of fact.\" Puis il pretend, inexactement je crois, avoir\ndonne divers messages a Mme Verrall.\nLe 27 Avril 1908, Mme Verrall ecrit des chiffres ou figurent\nbien en evidence les nombres 3, 6 et 7. Ce n'est pas rare\ndans ses textes (voy. Vol. XX., pp. 245, 272, 321, No. 9, 12,\n14, 15, 27; p. 418, No. 13 d., etc.).\nLe 8 Mai, elle ecrit des vers, apres avoir lu Dante ; elle\nfait probablement allusion a, Virgile. On y voit \" Blest are\nthe messengers . . . borne far aloft on oarage of their high\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croise'es et la Methode experimentale. 117\nwings, etc.\" Ces anges qui planent, soutenus par leurs ailes,\nrappellent a Mile Johnson . . . l'echelle de Jacob decrite par\nDante !\nMile H. Verrall a son tour ecrit\nLe 29 Avril : the figure 3 that seems wanted.\nLe 4 Mai : 8, eight, A a triangle.\nLe 11 Mai, un texte que Ton trouvera page 228, Vol. XXIV.\nLe commentaire de ce texte fait par Mile Johnson est\ndeconcertant. II y est question de l'echelle de Jacob ; d'une\ntoupie qui tourne, plusieurs couleurs qui se fondent en une\nseule en tournant. Cette allusion a un jeu commun, devient\npour Mile Johnson, h qui Mine Verrall le suggere, la roue\nmentionnee au Xe\nchant du Paradis. Eien ne legitime cette\ninterpretation ; mais Mile Johnson la prend comrae point de\ndepart d'un enchainement allegorique qui conduit a des cercles\naccomplissant leurs revolutions, a Iris, a, l'arc en ciel, mentionne\ndans le texte de Mile Verrall. De la nous passons a Platon\net au Mythe d'Er, qui nous amenent aux huit spheres celestes\net a d'autres correspondances.\nToutes ces hypotheses paraissent peu solides ; il est fort\npossible que Mile Verrall n'ait aucune connaissance de Dante\nelle ne l'a jamais lu, dit-elle. Mais on peut connaitre un poete\nsans l'avoir lu, alors surtout qu'il a la celebrite du Florentin.\nQui n'a pas vu les gravures de Gustave Dore ? Je ne puis\npenser qu'une jeune fille aussi instruite ignore completement\nla Divine Comklu ; il est inutile d'insister, car Mile Johnson\nadmet la possibilite d'une simple influence telepathique entre\nles dames Verrall.\nToutefois, les allusions sont fort incertaines ; rien ne permet\nde voir dans ces mots \" the seven branched candlestick it is an\nimage . . . seven candles united in one light and seven colours\nin the rainbow too,\" une allusion a la procession decrite dans\nle XXIV6\nchant du Purgatoire. Les seuls points de contact\nsont les sept flambeaux (candles) unis en une lumiere et les\nsept couleurs de l'arc en ciel. Ce sont la des details d'une\ngrande banalite, alors surtout qu'il venait d'etre fait mention\ndans le texte du chandelier a sept branches. Les autres\ndetails ne concordent pas. Dante ne parle pas des sept eglises\nni du chandelier a sept branches, Mile Verrall ne parle pas\ndes sept nymphes, tout indiquees pourtant, ni des vieillards,\n\f118 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [PAKT\nni des quatre animaux. II y a une absence complete d'identi-\nrication ; Mile Johnson et Mme Verrall reconnaissent le\npassage a des details indetermines. En realite, le texte de\nMile Verrall est une paraphrase du nombre 7, elle le termine\npar le mot de Mme Piper, \" We are seven.\"\nLa quatrieme contribution a la correspondance est due k\nune dame Frith; en Janvier 1908. Mme Verrall tit une\nexperience qui ne donna pas les resultats cherches :\n\" can\nE. H.\" c'est-a-dire le controle Hodgson \" say what are his asso-\nciations with the words, '\nClimb the mount of Blessing.'\n\" 1\nLa\nreponse fit allusion au mont Pisgah d'ou Moise apercut la terre\npromise. On voit une reference a Dante et a la montagne du\nPurgatoire, d'ou Virgile apeivut le Paradis, ou il ne pouvait entrer.\nLes derniers mots de la reponse sont \"till the mystic seven 2\nlights\nup the golden candlestick of dawn.\" II y a une concordance\navec le texte de Mile Verrall, que Mme Verrall connaissait\ndepuis le 6 Juin. La question posee le 14 Fevrier 1908 ne\nregut une reponse que le 11 Juin, soit quatre mois apres, ce\nqui est une mauvaise condition d'expe'rimentation.\nMme Holland intervient ensuite ; le 15 Juin 1908, elle\nreve au chiffre 6; le 23 Juillet elle ecrit : \"there should be\nthree at least in accord, and if possible Seven \" . . .\n\" take this\nfor token '\ngreen beyond belief . . . Not only on the ocean\nmay the Green Eay appear.\"\nLa repetition du mot \" green \" impressionna Mile Johnson ;\nelle chercha ce que cela pouvait signifier et trouva . . . une\nnouvelle allusion a Dante ! II semble ici que les limites de\nrindetermination soient atteintes. L'idee de vert est une\nreference au XXXI6\nchant du Purgatoire, parce que, la, il est\nparle des yeux d'emeraude de Beatrice. Toute autre couleur\naurait egalement etc une aussi bonne allusion, si vert correspond\na l'emeraude, rouge aurait correspondu au griffon, ou aux sept\npersonnages couronnes de fieurs rouges, blanc aux vieillards\ncouronnes de lys, jaune aux chandeliers d'or, etc. Le mot le\nplus banal sufht, on le voit, h etablir uue correspondance.\nEnfin, le 25 Novembre, Mme Holland apres avoir vu Mile\nJohnson, ecrivit :\n\" then an octave struck the answer\" citation\nde Browning (Vol. XXIV, p. 241).\n1\nCes mots avaient fait 1'objet (Tun article de Light, 1906, p. 16.\n2\nThe mystical number seven, Light, 1907, p. 306.\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 119\nMme Home joue le sixieme role. Le 24 Juillet 1908,\nelle dit, etant entrancee :\n\" seven times seven and seventy-\nseven \" et conseilla de eommuniquer ces mots a Mile Johnson.\nLa derniere allusion a 7 est due k M. Piddington qui, le\n13 Juillet 1904, avait ecrit une lettre \" posthume \" (sic). Elle\nfaisait connaitre son intention, s'il survivait, de eommuniquer\nk un sensitif le nombre 7.\n\"\n' The seven lamps of architecture,' '\nthe seven sleepers of\nEphesus,' 'unto seventy times seven,' 'we are seven,' and so\nforth.\" 7 est un \" tic \" chez lui, une habitude, \" habit \" (ibid.,\np. 244).\nEvidemment, il y avait la un phenomene supranormal.\nCette croyance etait confirmee par le reve de Mme Holland,\na qui on avait montre en songe un vieux carnet, ou etaient\necrits ces mots, \"Since in 1872 a dear friend chose as a\nsign by which to communicate with me the figure 6, I, in\nmy turn, will try, in the time to come, to send the figure 6,\nsimply the sign of 6 \" (ibid., p. 238). Un nombre etait\nindique comme le sujet d'une communication posthume. La\ncoincidence ne portait que sur ce point, puisque les deux\nchiffres ne concordaient pas, mais le choix d'un nombre dans\nce but parut k M. Piddington une chose difficile k deviner.\nEnfin Mme Piper avait parle de \" habit \" et de \" tick,\" ce\nqui rappelait encore les expressions de la lettre posthume.\nCe n'est pas tout. Mile Johnson nous apprend que le\nphenomene etait prepare depuis quatre ans. Au moment ou\nM. Piddington ecrivait sa lettre, Mme Verrall produisait un\ntexte, \"... it is something contemporary that you are to\nrecord\u2014note the hour\u2014in London half the message has come \"\n(ibid., p. 246). II est evident que e'est une allusion a la\nlettre de M. Piddington ; cette derniere en effet ne contient\nque des references a 7, Dante n'y apparait pas. Done il n'y\na que la moitie du message total dans la lettre.\nCette interpretation est appuyee sur le texte de Mile\nVerrall du 15 Juillet 1904, ou on lit \"Deficit omne,\" ce qui\npeut etre regarde \" as equivalent to Mrs. Verrall's more definite\nstatement\" (Vol. XXIV, p. 248).\nVoila done une correspondance croisee ou 7 automatistes se\nrencontrent sur le mot 7, plus ou moins combine avec des\nallusions k Dante.\n\f120 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nSi on analyse avec impartialite le systerne de Mile Johnson,\non trouve d'abord que les allusions a Dante sont incertaines,\ncomme je l'ai indique, sauf pour Mine Verrall, qui lisait, au\nmoment de la production de ses textes de 1908, le Purgatoire,\nChez Mile Verrall on ne trouve que l'echelle de Jacob, sept\nflambeaux et sept couleurs de l'arc en ciel, ce qui est\ninsuffisant pour determiner l'allusion avec certitude. II faut\nremarquer au surplus que, dans le texte de Mme Verrall, il\nn'y a pas d'allusion a l'echelle de Jacob : ses anges planent\nsoutenus par leurs ailes, tandis que les anges de Jacob montent\net descendent sur leur echelle ; les deux images ne concordent\nni dans leur expression verbale ni dans leur sens, sauf sur le\ntheme \" anges,\" qui est banal. De meme, il faut beaucoup de\nbonne volonte pour voir une allusion au Purgatoire dans les\nmots le mystique sept et le chandelier d'or, green beyond\nbelief, the green Pay, et seven times seven.\n\" The mystic seven \" est une banalite. Le caractere mystique\ndu nombre 7 est un lieu commun pour tous ceux qui se sont\noccupes des soi-disant sciences occultes. Mme Blavatsky (Secret\nDoctrine I., 114), parle des \"Seven mystic sages.\" Pres de\ncinq colonnes sont consaerees a ce nombre dans l'lndex (pp.\n257-260).\nQuant a \" Seven times seven,\" ou 49, c'est une reminiscence\nde Stainton Moses. On voit, Light, 1897, p. 183: \"when we\ncommenced to influence you ... we told you of an organised\nband of 49 spirits who were concerned in the working of our\nplan.\" Et, 1892, p. 189: \"seven circles of seven spirits\" sont\nattaches a M. Moses. Imperator en est le chef.\nLe journal Light est une veritable mine d'allusions aux textes\nmedianiques. J'en recommande l'analyse a Mile Johnson et\na Mme Verrall. La premiere verra (n\u00b0 du 5 Novembre 1904)\nune analyse de Fragments of Prose and Poetry de Myers ou est\ncite le passage reproduit par elle \" from ten to sixteen, etc.\"\nII y a toute une serie de relations entre East et West dans\nle meme volume :\n\" there is something mysterious in the leaning\nof the East towards the West just now (29 Oct. 1904); Light\ncometh from the East (1904, p. 270); where farther East and\nfarthest West meet . . . ; the light has moved away from the\nEast\" (ibid.); \"Pharaoh's daughter\" est meme imprime, p. 224.\nII ne semble pas que les experimentateurs anglais aient pense\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methods experimentale. 121\na cette source normale de renseignements quest la litterature\nspiritualiste. lis y auraient trouve a peu pres toutes leurs\ncorrespondances croisees. C'est dans l'oeuvre de M. Moses, que\npersonnellement j'admire beaucoup ;i cause de son elevation\nmorale, que Ton trouve la source du message de Mme Home,\net de bien d'autres.\nDone, pas d'allusion certaine a Dante : le contraire est\nprobable et j'indique la source vraisemblable de sept fois sept.\nQuant aux correspondances sur ce nombre, elles sont vrai-\nment trop banales pour n'etre pas explicables par de simples\ncoincidences.\nLa lettre de M. Piddington n'ajoute rien a ces circonstances ;\naucune des idees qu'il voulait transmettre n'a 6te reproduite.\nDe plus, il faut conserver notre bon sens et ne pas lui imposer\nde trop lourds sacrifices. Dans le message de Mme Verrall\ndu 13 Juillet, rien n'indique l'idee d'une communication a\nM. Piddington. Sa lettre n'est pas un message arrive k Londres,\nmais bien l'annonce d'un message qu'il transmettra s'il le peut\napres sa mort. L'idee du texte de Mme Verrall est inapplicable\na la lettre de M. Piddington. A cette date, Mme Verrall\nessayait de correspondre avec Mme Porbes (Vol. XX., p. 267),\net on trouve le mot message applique a Mme Forbes le 23\nNovembre 1903, les 25 Janvier, 21 et 28 Decembre 1904;\nune allusion a la difficult^ de transmettre les mots grecs (du\nSymposium) par cette dame est faite le 15 Juillet (Vol. XX.,\np. 408). Telle est probablement la veritable allusion au message\na demi arrive a Londres.\nEnfin, pouiquoi penser que Myers-Verrall fera une prediction\nadmirable a quatre annees de distance et revelera les pensees\nde M. Piddington, alors que dans le meme texte il se trompe\ncompletement sur sa propre lettre postbume ? Cela est bien\npeu vraisemblable.\nOn pourrait faire des critiques semblables sur les autres details\nde la correspondance, cela allongerait inutilement l'analyse. Je\nfinirai en signalant le long espace de temps qui s'ecoule entre\nle commencement et la fin de la correspondance, plus de quatre\nans, et les delais qui separent les interventions des differents\nmediums. Cela rend leurs concordances inutilisables pour une\ndemonstration scientifique de leur realite, a moins de se fier\nimplicitement a eux, ce qui est une erreur de metbode.\n\f122 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nLa correspondance sur Sesame and Lilies est d'une grande\nbanalite ;\nj'en dirai autant de door et de key que nous retrouvons\nd'ailleurs dans les experiences faites avec Mrne Willett. La,\nSir 0. Lodge n'a pas experiments avec la prudence h laquelle\nil nous a accoutumes.\nII demande, par lettre, au controle de Mine Willett, ce que\nlui rappelle le Lethe. La reponse ne fut obtenue qu'au bout\nde quatre mois ; le medium a conserve pendant tout ce temps\nla lettre de Sir Oliver Lodoe.\n-Te pense pourtant que Mme Willett n'a pas fraude ; la\nmediocrite des responses prouve qu'elle ne s'est pas renseignee,\net elle nous donne des details etablissant sa sincerite.\nII y a trois ordres de faits k analyser dans ces experiences\nd'abord l'indication du nom de M. Dorr : elle est due k l'impru-\ndence de Mme Verrall qui avait averti \" les controles de Mme\nWillett (sic) \" des bons resultats donnes par les seances de M.\nDorr avec Mme Piper (Vol. XXV., p. 125). Dans les indi-\ncations donnees par Mme Verrall sur ses communications avec\nMme Willett, cette information n'est pas signalee, il me semble\nl'omission d'un renseignement aussi important serait un grave\noubli.\nL'emergence du nom de M. Dorr ne depasse done pas les\nlimites de la divination subliminale, et je ne vois aucun element\nsupranormal dans ce fait, malgre la mise en scene accompagnant\nsa production.\nLe second point est la connaissance que le controle Myers\nmontre des experiences faites avec Mme Piper. Sur ce point,\nil est visible qu'il connait simplement ce qua lu Mme Willett\n(au moins les volumes XXI. et XXII. des Proceedings) et qu'il\nse trompe sur la portee des experiences de M. Dorr. Ce dernier\n(Vol. XXV., p. 127), dit-il, desire que le controle montre\n\" different aspects of thought underlying which unity is to be\nfound.\" Ces phrases sont empruntees a Mile Johnson :\n\" the\nstatements ... of one writer were by no means a simple\nreproduction ... of the other but seemed to represent different\naspects of the same idea (Vol. XXL, p. 373); there is . . .\none coherent idea underlying both\" (Vol. XXL, p. 375); on\ntrouve l'idee de \" access to hnoivlcdgc shown elsewhere \" dans le\nrapport de M.

Dorr voulait surtout examiner\nles souvenirs classiques de Myers-Piper (Vol. XXV., p. 120);\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methocle experimentale. 123\nMme Willett attribue a M. Dorr les pensees et les ex-\npressions de Mile Johnson et de M. Piddington quelle connait\nnormalement.\nQuant au troisieme point, il concerne justement les souvenirs\nclassiques de Myers-Willett. Celui-ci ne dit rien d'Ovide, mais\nest plein d'allusions Virgiliennes ; or Mme Willett a lu les\netudes de Myers sur Virgile et possede un ouvrage sur le\npoete latin. II est naturel que Ton trouve des reminiscences\ndes unes et de l'autre.\n(1) \" Once only does the soul descend the way that leads to\nincarnation\" (Vol. XXV., p. 123), est inspire par Spirit\nTeachings plutot que par Tennyson. \" Christ existant in the\nages past descends to incarnation (p. 259-260, Memorial Edition);\nReincarnation . . . was not true\" (Light, 1893, p. 76).\n(2) \" The llcnding of the essence with the instrument \" ne\nrappelle pas mens agitat molem, mais plutot \" Veiling in\nhuman flesh the radiance of his pure spirit\" (Memorial Edition,\np. 259).\n(3) \" Tu Marcellus eris\" est une banalite.\n(4) \" In valle reducta \" est emprunte ;i un texte Mac (Vol.\nXXV., p. 137), ou etait indiquee la source de la citation: VJ\u00b0\nchant de YEniide. L'association du rameau d'or, des colombes\net des ombres est done naturelle et normale, utant donnee cette\nindication. Ces mots figurent d'ailleurs dans des textes publics\naux Proceedings, Vols. XXL, XXII.\n(5) \"the door to which I found no hey\" (Vol. XXV, p. 130)\nest emprunte a Omar Khayyam, soit : mais la citation est\nbanale et il y a une serie d'articles dont ces mots forment le\ntheme dans Light, 1905, p. 99; the Key, an allegory, by\nMme d'Esperance. Des savants ne peuvent ouvrir la porte\nd'une chambre secrete : un enfant arrive disant \" I have found\nthe key . . . and lo ! the door was open.\" L'allegorie est\nreprise, p. 124 et 155. II semble que Myers-Willett y fasse\nallusion.\n(6) La mention d'Haggi Baba a ete rattachee par les com-\nmentateurs au conte d'Ali Baba; en realite, l'emergence de ce\nnom depend entierement de door et de hey et se relie a une\npublication de James Morier The adventures of LTajji Baba\nof Lspahan, ou il est question de porte et de cle (S.P.R.\nJournal, Vol. XV., p. 101). L'allusion au conte des quarante\n\f124 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nvoleurs n'existe pas, car aucune cle n'ouvrait la porte de la\ncaverne des voleurs : elle obeissait a une formule magique\nseulement. Nous avons encore la un exemple d'interpretation\nhative, comme dans l'attribution a Tennyson d'une citation\nempruntee a un hynine religieux (conf. Vol. XXV., p. 140 et\nJournal, Vol. XV., p. 104).\nDans le texte du 10 Fevrier (Vol. XXV, p. 148) nous\ntrouvons des associations normales : Lydia, et l'Ode d'Horace,\nbien connue (I., 8e) ;\nSeneque, Ulysse, qui n'ont aucune associa-\ntion avec le Lethe. Seneque a ecrit un livre pour consoler\nsa mere Helvia, mais il a fait au Senat l'apologie du meurtre\nd'Agrippine et n'est pas cite comme un modele de piete filiale.\nUlysse rencontre sa mere Anticlee lorsqu'il evoque les morts,\nmais ce fils pieux ne laisse sa mere approcher de lui qu'apres\navoir termine ses affaires avec Tiresias. Business is business\n(Ochjs. XL, 88-89).\nLemergence de nightingale s'associe avec le Lethe, a cause\ndu 4e vers de l'ode de Keats, qui est tres connue (Gems, 228).\nII est possible que Mme Willett connaisse le fameux passage\ndes Gdorgiques \" Qualis . . . Philomela sub umbra,\" et dans\nce cas Ulysse, les ombres, Philomele, le Rossignol, etc., sont des\nassociations oniriques de type connu. Mais je ne pense pas\nque l'allusion a Keats soit correcte, parce que ce poete, dans\nson ode au rossignol, dit que son esprit s'endort dans l'oubli\ntandis que le controle veut montrer qu'il n'a rien oublie. II\nn'y a done qu'un lien verbal (Lethcwards) entre l'idee de Keats\net l'idee differente de Myers-Willett.\nVoih't ce qu'une analyse simple fait penser ; voici ce\nqu'imagine Mme Verrall : l'allusion a Shelley est expliquee\npar les mots once more ye Laurels qui sont empruntes au\nLycidas de Milton, prototype de YAdonais de Shelley, dans\nlequel on lit (stance XVIL), Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightin-\ngale. ... Ce qui est une allusion voilee a l'ode de Keats\nComme dans YAdonais on trouve Echo, Hyacinthe et Nar-\ncisse dont a parle Mme Piper dans les seances Dorr, l'allusion\nest manifeste. C'est intentionnellement que Myers-Willett n'a\npas nomme Ovide (Vol. XXV., p. 159) !\nTout cela est contenu implicitement dans Shelley et once\nmore ye Laurels.\nOn trouve cependant ces mots ailleurs que dans Adonais\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 125\nvoyez Narcisse, Hyacinthe dans The Sensitive Plant ;\nHyacinth,\nEcho, Apollo, sont dans Promethie. Toutes ces allusions sont\nbanales.\nII suffit a Mme Verrall pour relever une correspondance,\nqu'il y ait l'indication d'un poeme, par une citation, du nom\nd'un autre poete et une analogie quelconque entre la premiere\nceuvre et le second poete. Une pareille maniere de raisonner\nn'est pas serieusement discutable, car on peut trouver toutes\nsortes de correspondances dans des conditions aussi indeter-\nminees.\nEn realite, Mme Willett ecrit une foule de reminiscences\nempruntees aux Proceedings ;\nShelley, Keats, Writ in water\n(Vol. XXL, p. 355), Laurels, Scribe, Sybil, flavicomata, Waters\nof Babylon, Zion, l'allusion a l'ornbre d'Achille, etc., figurent\ndans ces documents. On ne trouve rien d'original dans les\ntextes de Mme Willett, tout est emprunte, ou banal.\nQuant aux connaissances litteraires du controle Myers-Willett,\nelles sont manifestement d'ordre inferieur. II confond les deux\nAjax ; la traduction de eV c>e <paei kui oXecraov n'est pas\n\" though it should blind me,\" mais \" detruis moi (si tu le\nveux) mais a, la lumiere.\"\nII faut prendre garde a l'imagination. Je vais en montrer\nles dangers pratiques en indiquant a Mme Verrall une\ncorrespondance imaginaire dans laquelle elle trouvera les plus\nsurprenantes coincidences. C'est en examinant les textes Mac\nque cette demonstration peut se faire.\nLe 16 Mars (Vol. XXIV, p. 297) Mile Verrall cite un\nquatrain, inexactement attribue a Victor Hugo, parle de la\nrose de Saron, de \" Gautier, and Hugo, those together types to\nbe compared. Unless there is a possibility of setting the two\nside by side there would be no opportunity.\"\nLe 27 Juillet le texte Mac porte \"A little love and then\nthe joy fades and the rose is crumpled and withers up\u2014fane.\nFrench (fane) . . . hollow and mortal vain is life without\na meaning.\"\nCela rappelle a Mme Verrall une poesie de \" Victor Hugo\nqui hd est iris familifrre, et dont sa fille a cite la premiere\nstance ;\n\" La vie est vaine, un peu d'amour, un peu de haine\net puis bonjour.\" Les souvenirs de Mme Verrall (Vol. XXIV.,\np. 298) sont en realite incertains, car le quatrain n'est pas\n\f126 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nde Victor Hugo, il est d'un poete peu connu, M. de Montenaeken ;\nil est cite dans Trilby, roman de Du Maurier, paru en 1894\n(Vol. XXV., p. 321). Cela n'a etc decouvert que plus tard,\ncar sur le moment, Mine Verrall ecrivit a Mile Mac pour lui\ndemander si son texte ne lui rappelait pas wi poeme de Hugo ;\net Mile Mac de repondre affirmativemeut ; l'allusion lui avait\nparu familiere.\nL'original etait done connu de toutes les parties; le fait\ninteressant pour Mme Verrall, est la correspondance croisee\nk laquelle il sert ; sa fille cite une strophe et Mile Mac l'autre.\nII n'y a pas de simple coincidence, parce que la mention d'une\nrose, qui apparait dans les deux textes, les fixe et les relie\n(Vol. XXIV, p. 299).\nLa comparaison conseillee entre Gautier et Hugo preoccupa\nMme Verrall ;\n\" (it) would be completely justified,\" dit-elle, \" if,\nfor instance, there existed poems by Hugo and Gautier charac-\nteristic of their respective authors and referring to the topic\nwhich is the subject of the poem whose second stanza is\nquoted in the script\u2014the emptiness and brevity of life\n(Vol. XXV., p. 322). Des recherches furent faites et elles\naboutirent aux resultats suivants : rien dans l'ceuvre poetique\nde Gautier ni dans celle de Hugo ne rappelait la citation.\nMme Verrall fut alors mise sur la voie par son ecriture\nautomatique ; elle avait eu communication des proces-verbaux\ndes seances Piper, de Juillet 1910, le 22 Septembre de la meme\nannee. Le mot meditation y figurait comme etant l'objet d'une\ncorrespondance croisee. II y etait mis en vigoureux relief. Je\ncite les passages des proces-verbaux sur lesquels j 'attire speciale-\nment 1\n'attention du lecteur (Vol. XXV., pp. 331-332).\n8 Juillet: (au re veil) \"Myers, Meditation\" (puis des vers sont\ndits; on ne saisit que): \"meditation . . . sleeping dead. Laurels\nround . . . ever grow. Meditation links it.\" (Les vers sont\nrepris): \"churchyard tree . . . walked with gorgeous feet . . .\nabout the sleeping dead. Meditation links it. Life open peace\ncompletes the semblance ...\"\nLe 16: \"Meditation . . . connects it.\" Lodge fait observer\nqu'il n'a pas trouve de poeme intitule \" Meditation.\" \" Medita-\ntion comes out in Mrs. Holland's also will appear at Mrs. Ws.\nWait for it.\" Sur demande de Lodge, le controle, qui est\nHodgson, reprend les vers ; il ecrit :\n\" Elegy ... as through\n\flxv.] Correspondanees croisees et la Methode experimentale. 127\nthe graveyard's lone retreat my Meditation led Slow I walked\nwith cautious feet above the sleeping dead.\" Interroge sur le\npoeme dont provient la citation, le controle repond \" Elegy.\"\n\" Do you mean Gray's Elegy ?\n\" \" Yes \" (suggestion fausse\naussitot acceptee). \" But Meditation will play a most interesting\npart and the last two lines \" seront donnes \" through both\nlights \" (mediums) etc.\nLe mot meditation apparait immediatement apres la lecture\ndes proces-verbaux dans les textes de Mme Verrall ; le 4\nOctobre, notamment :\n\" Samaritan . . . M \" (et une lettre qui\nest nettement un P) \". . . Meditation is a good long word in\nM\u2014 . . . ask about the Golden Numbers. It seems impossible\nto get you to distinguish sometimes between your thoughts and\nours,\u2014and you constantly overlook idiosyncrasies wh. ought to\ntell you who the writer is\u2014\" (Vol. XXV., p. 324).\nLe 10 Octobre: \"...

En meme temps elle\nexamina 1'ecriture automatique de sa fille et y trouva des coin-\ncidences avec la sienne, notamment des instruments a cordes\netaient l'objet de diverses allusions, et \" toute la lyre \" de Hugo\netait citee.\nLe 27 Janvier, elle trouva l'axiome (?) dans un poeme de\nGautier intitule Meditation\n\" Ce qui charme s'en va, ce qui fait peine reste\nLa rose vit une heure et le cypres cent ans.\"\nElle trouva les trois conditions remplies : poeme caracteristique\nde l'auteur (affirmation faite pour surprendre un familier des\npoemes de Gautier) ; allusion a la brievete de la vie (inais non\ntl Scl vanite), portant le titre Meditation.\nKestait a comparer Hugo et Gautier. Dans \" Toute la\nLyre \" elle trouva une piece de vers dediee a Gautier ;\npuis\nune autre, Epitaphe d'enfant, ou l'idee de la brievete de la vie\n\f128 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nest presentee sous un jour contraire a celui que eclaire la\n\" Meditation \" de Gautier\n\" Qu'as-tu done fait pour que ta vie\nAit sitot merite la mort ?\n\"\nLe choix du mot \" rose \" pour fixer la eorrespondance\ns'explique aussi, car la rubrique du poeme de Gautier est em-\nprunteee a Malherbe. \" Ce monde ou les meilleures choses ont\nle pire destin \" est un passage de l'Ode cedebre ou se trouve\nle vers \" Et rose elle a vecu ce que vivent les roses, etc.\"\nMme Verrall estime que ces allusions subtiles a Gautier et\na Hugo revtdent une connaissance de leurs oeuvres bien supe-\nrieure k celle quelle et sa fille en ont ; elle reconnait qu'avaut\nd'avoir ecrit les textes cites, elle avait parcouru la table des\nmatieres des ouvrages des deux poetes franqais, et que par con-\nsequent l'emergence de \" Meditation \" et de \" Toute la lyre\npent s'expliquer en partie, mais il n'en est pas moms vrai\nqu'au moment ou les textes de Miles Verrall et Mac ont ete\nproduits, en 1908, leur ignorance etait encore complete, en ce\nqui concerne Meditation de Gautier et E}ntaphc d'enfant de\nHugo.\nA ces documents, que cite Mme Verrall, j'ajouterai pour la\ndiscussion qui va suivre, un texte d'elle du 5 Octobre 1910,\ncontemporain de ceux qu'elle analyse, et qui rentre dans la serie\ndes coincidences fortuites que je vais faire connaitre an lecteur.\n(Dessin d'une croix) \"How often bas the tune been played\nbefore ? then say minstrel the minstrel was infirm and old\n(dessin de deux harpes) \" toute la lyre.

L'axiome de Gautier\npar exemple ne lui rappelle rien de precis, et il ne songerait\npas a la fragilite de la beaute. La comparaison entre Gautier\net Hugo lui paraitrait pleine d'insurmontables difficultes.\nII y a autre chose ; la lecture des textes de Mme Verrall et\nde Mme Piper attirerait son attention sur un autre poete, dont\nle nom est etroitement associe a \" Meditation \" : Lamartine. II\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Afethocle experimentale. 129\nverrait dans les allusions a Gautier et a Hugo non une invita-\ntion a chercher dans l'oeuvre de ces poetes, mais une indication\ninvitant a examiner la litterature francaise, examen qui resultera\nde la comparaison des types et fournira l'occasion prevue.\nLe texte de Mme Verrall contient M P, meditations poetiques,\ninterpretation confirmee par le texte du 1 0 Octobre \" une associa-\ntion purement poetique a meditation.\" II verrait dans la preface\ndu \" Dernier chant de Childe Harold \" qui fait partie des\n\" Meditations Poetiques \" de Lamartine, ces mots \" Harold est\nun enfant de Vimagination.\" (\"Fancy's child.\") II trouverait\n19 lettres dans le nom d'Alpho?ise de Lamartine, et 19 est le\ntotal des nombres el' or; dans \" ap hoel \" il verrait un anagramme\nincomplet d'Alphonse.\nAppliquant son hypothese au texte de Mme Piper, il\nchercherait une elegie dans les Meditations, et la trouverait,\npiece XL, Nouvelles Me'elitcdions. La, il reconnaitrait le theme\ngeneral cherche par Mme Verrall, la vanite et la brievete\nde la vie, les deux icUes y sont exprimees et non une seule\ncomme elans Gautier.

II est evident que nous sommes en\npresence de coincidences fortuites, que la banalite de certains\nsujets, comme rose, brievete et vanite de la vie, tombeaux, pas\nsilencieux, sommeil des morts, laurier, elegie, etc., explique\nfacilement, mais il y a d'autres rencontres plus curieuses, telles\nque \" mentations poitiqites\" \" Harold enfant de Vimagination.\"\nII me semble que cette correspondance est encore mieux\n6tablie que celles dont le Pvrgatoire de Dante nous est cite\ncomme un exemple.\nOn voit, ainsi, ou peuvent conduire la nmthode symbolicme,\nl'interpretation et l'imagination.\nMetiiohs.\nWe have now to deal with criticisms of a more general\nnature. They involve questions, the solution of which is of\nvital importance for the future of Psychical Eesearch.\nIt has been already pointed out that the phenomena of the\nS.P.E, automatists, whose work is under consideration, are\nliable to a serious objection. They are not, as a rule, really\nproven by objective evidence. We must admit the automatists'\ngood faith.\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 131\nI have the greatest confidence in their truthfulness and I\nam personally quite ready to believe that they are not guilty\nof any collusion. The remarks which I am about to make\ndo not apply to the experimenters or the mediums individually\nthey have a wider range and are above personalities.\nThe value of an experiment, according to Dr. Sidgwick\n(Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 401-402), is worthless when the\npossibility of conscious or unconscious fraud is not excluded.\nI need not insist on the fact that such a condition is not\nfulfilled by the latest experiments. The automatists might\nhave exchanged letters, combining beforehand their correspon-\ndences ; the investigators could not be aware of their underhand\nagreement to fraud. The medium's good faith must be implicitly\nadmitted as an element of the experiment.\nIf the respectability of the well-known ladies and gentlemen\nwho are either mediums or investigators is held to make such\nan admission legitimate ;\nthen I fear that we forfeit the right\nof doubting other honourable people's statements in similar cir-\ncumstances. The S.P.R. cannot claim the monopoly of honesty\nand good faith for their mediums or enquirers.\nHaving gone so far, they are not entitled to impose on\nother experimenters the rules which they do not observe in\ntheir own experiments. They give thus a bad example, and\nlose the right of criticising the value of sittings held according\nto their own standard.\nRules must be binding for every one. Scientific research\nknows no privilege. If we are to make exceptions for certain\nmediums, we cannot, without giving offence, refuse to treat\nother mediums as we treat our own, whosoever they may be.\nInstances of that grave defect of method are easy to give. When\nSir 0. Lodge, who is, as a rule, a very prudent experimenter,\nleft a letter during four months in the hands of a medium\nbefore getting an answer, he forgot the rules wisely drawn by\nProfessor Sidgwick. The medium had simply to read the\nquestion when she got the letter, and she had plenty of time\nfor preparing an answer.\nISTo better provisions were made against unconscious fraud.\nWe know very little as yet of the psychological conditions\nin which the automatist's mind moves itself. There are many\nvarieties of unconscious fraud, some being connected with\n\f132 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nabnormal states of consciousness, some being simply dependent\nupon prejudice, bias, monoideism ; tbe latter are hardly frauds,\nthough we cannot draw the line between these and the former\nones. And this fact is not easy to grasp, when one is not\nfamiliar with the psychological phenomena of trance, crepus-\nculary states of consciousness and ordinary absent-mindedness,\nlack of attention, or bias. Between these typical forms of the\nloss of the sense of reality (sens du reel) there are a number\nof boundary and complicated forms ;\nand, according to the\ndegree of dimness to which the normal consciousness sinks\ndown, we have various forms of unconscious fraud.\nI fear that psychical researchers are not quite familiar some-\ntimes with the difficulties which are encountered in the study\nof these psychological states, chiefly the crepusculary states of\nconsciousness.\nWe find them in some diseases of the brain or of the nervous\nsystem, chiefly in hysteria and epilepsy. But they are not,\nby themselves, a pathological symptom, no more than auto-\nmatism is a symptom of hysteria. They are easy to observe\nin healthy persons.\nWhen a question is put to an entranced medium, if the\nanswer is not immediately given, we leave, in the medium's\nsubliminal, the seed of a desire, and the latent desire may\ninduce an impulsion, and a transitory trance, if the seed has\nbeen deposited during the trance. Auto-suggestion, like hetero-\nsuggestion, tends to the production of the state of conscious-\nness, during the carrying on of the impulse, which obtained\nwhen the suggestion was given, or the cause of the self-\nsuggestion was born.\nCan we suspect such transient states of consciousness in\nthe mediums of the S.P.R. ?\nMrs. Piper is quite trustworthy ; how can we adjust this\nfact with the other one, her perusal of Browning ? She may\nhave been in a transitory trance while looking through the\nvolume ; the trance was self-induced, and owed its cause to\nthe questions which had been asked during the sittings.\nThis is only an hypothesis, but I feel sure that its possi-\nbility will not be denied by neuropathologists. The experimenters\nhave completely overlooked such possibilities ;\nthey have not\ntaken care to exclude them ; their conclusions are founded on\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 133\nfacts which are not free from the suspicion of unconscious\nfraud.\nSuch impulsions may occur without a complete trance ; a\nsimple crepusculary state may obtain, that is an obnubilation\nof the normal consciousness.\nThese crepusculary states of consciousness may be very\nshort, the shading off of the normal self may be very light\nit does not alter the case and, as a rule, there is a consecutive\namnesia.\nLighter grades of dimming are to be observed in the\nnormal consciousness, when one is absent-minded. It seems,\nat first sight, hardly credible that a simple absence or lack of\nattention may be held as a psychological state of the same\norder as impulsions, motor automatisms or trances. If we\nare to consider them from a general point of view, taking in\nall their characteristics, we cannot naturally perceive the\nfeatures which are common to all. Their connexion appears,\nhowever, when we take into account the relations between the\nnormal consciousness and the subliminal, or rather, as I propose\nto say, the organic or general consciousness. In that case, we\nnote always a diminution of the former, the field of which is\nnarrowed.\nIt is usually associated with a loss of the sense of reality.\nWe observe such narrowing of consciousness in deep thought,\nand we know that genuine motor automatisms may then take\nplace. In our states of abstraction, we are apt to leave\nthings in the wrong place and to forget where we put them.\nSuch a loss of memory is a real amnesia.\nI do not pretend to say that the automatists may have\nlooked abstractedly into a book and picked up the knowledge\nwhich they showed afterwards in their script, with amnesia of\nthe act through which it was gained. I have no reason to\nsuspect automatisms of this kind in the facts which we are\nanalyzing.\nThe study of the states of distraction, as they say in\nFrench, and of the consecutive amnesia is, however, full of\nmeaning. We forget the greater part of what we do, and\nsee, and hear, and read. A few days, or a few months,\nor a few years, blot our memories ; but this is true only\nof our normal memory ; it seems probable that our organic\n\f134 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nmemory keeps the record of every perception stored up by our\nsenses. Though not generally accepted, this hypothesis is very\nlikely true. We know that our subconscious memory is in\nany case infinitely richer than our conscious one ; the latter\nhas no knowledge of the stores accumulated in the former, and\nthere are no means of gauging the first through the second,\nthough the reverse may be possible.\nAnd, here, we get at a serious defect in the methods used\nby the experimenters. They are always asking from the\nmediums information about their conscious or normal know-\nledge, and seem to believe that such information is adecpuate.\nI use the word seem, as some of them are well aware of the\nutter inutility of their enquiries (Vol. XXL, p. 387). Why,\nthen, do they take so much pain to ascertain what are the\nconscious recollections of the automatists ? The scripts are not\nthe product of the normal consciousness, but grow out of the\nsubconscious self, the potentialities of which may, and probably\ndo, depend on the forgotten experiences of their whole life.\nTwo other points may be considered in connexion with\nthose losses of memory. The first is the impossibility of ascer-\ntaining what a medium does not subconsciously know. It is\nalready difficult to gauge the extent of his knowledge ; the\ndifficulty becomes immensely greater when we have to prove\nthat lie does not know something. We are confronted by a\nnegative fact, which cannot really be proven. We may infer\nthat a given knowledge is out of the medium's reach, but we\ncannot prove our assumption.\nSecondly, we cannot know whether the knowledge displayed\nby a medium's automatism has a supernormal source or is\ndue to \" cryptomnesia \" ; this is, the consequence of the first\npoint above discussed.\nA third point is even to be taken into account, always in\nconnexion with the losses or gains of memory related to abnormal\nstates of consciousness. Some of the experimenters hold that\nthe trance consciousness of Mrs. Piper, for instance, is shut\nfrom the normal one. They think that the two fields are\ncompletely apart one from the other.\nI am not disposed to agree with them. We have but one\nmeans of testing the links between normal and abnormal states\nof consciousness, and it is by an analysis of their respective\n\fLXV.] Correspondances croisees et la Methods experimentale. 135\nmemories. And a first observation must be made ; the relative\namnesia is without doubt a functional, not an essential one. It\ncan be compared with amnesia in cases of hysteria. And even\nin such cases we note a modification of the language, for instance,\nin Pitre's \" Ecmnesia.\" The trance does not show a serious altera-\ntion of language. The medium may speak with a different\naccent, he may use a particular style of expressing himself;\nthese changes are superficial ; the bulk of the speaking material\nis not altered.\nIf the memories of the normal consciousness were absolutely\nshut from the trance personality, we should observe \" mnesic\naphasia,\" that is the loss of speech, through loss of memory,\nas we note it sometimes in neuropathology. The conservation\nof speech shows that the relative amnesia is not deeply rooted.\nAnd there is evidence that the trance consciousness draws\nsometimes its supply from the normal stores. We can find\nan instance, I think, of the fact in the Dorr sittings, when\nMyerSp put on the track of the Olympic games, spoke of\nthe modern Marathon races. Such a blunder is manifestly\nborrowed from the normal personality's memory.\nI fear that the whole conception of the psychological con-\ndition of the trance, to use Mr. Dorr's words, of its depth,\nnot of its genuineness, held by the experimenters are not cpuite\nsatisfactory. My conclusions, if they impair the worth of the\nlatest experiments about cross-correspondence and literary know-\nledge, do not impair the worth of the former experiments made\nwith Mrs. Piper, whose good faith is not suspected. Her\ntrance remains genuine, but its depth is not such as some\nexperimenters believe it to be ; and by depth, we must under-\nstand Mr. Dorr's peculiar meaning, that is, its depth in relation\nto the normal consciousness.\nThe experimenters seem to ignore the work done outside\nthe society. I am not sure that here \" things are not what\nthey seem,\" but still their conclusions would have more weight\nif they were grounded on a knowledge less superficial in\nappearance.\nUnfortunately, there are other reasons for suspecting the\nexperimenters of a little superficiality. Their statements are\nsometimes hasty. A great number of these statements had\nto be corrected. I may add to the examples given above,\n\f136 Joseph Maxwell, 31. D. [part\nMrs. Verrall's commentary on Mrs. Holland's script of Novem-\nber 10, 1909. She sees in \"O singer of Persephone from\nthe far meadows desolate hast thou forgotten Sicily \" allusions\nto Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone, while the verses are\na quotation from Oscar Wilde's Theocritus (S.P.li, Journal,\nVol. XV., p. 105). The implicit reference to \"Nightingale\"\nis consecpuently very doubtful.\nFrom these examples may be gathered the feeling that the\nconclusions founded upon such weak and doubtful references\nare very uncertain, not to say more. And the feeling becomes\na rational impression when other symptoms of superficiality\nare met with, examples of which I have given.\nThe experimenters have an unconscious tendency to adapt\nthe facts to their opinions and wishes, not to suit the latter\nto the first.\nMiss Johnson gives an amusing example of her onesidedness.\nThe incident is so extraordinary that it stands as a token of\nsincerity : but I fear that Miss Johnson did not perceive its\nhumourous side.\nOn March 28, 1900, Mrs. Holland gave a description of\nMr. Poden Noel \" clear eyes under a broad brow a shock of grey\nhair that was still thick, etc.\" The description tallies with a\nportrait published in Mr. Noel's collected poems. Mrs. Holland\nis not aware of having ever seen the portrait ; Miss Johnson\nstates that the poet's personal appearance was correctly described-\n(Vol. XXL, p. 324). Miss Noel wrote (Vol. XXIV., pp. 5-6)\nthat the description was not very accurate ; her father's hair\nwas \" very thin latterly, though curly, and it was hardly grey.\"\nBut Miss Johnson knows better. \" My own recollection of\nthe one occasion on which I saw him is that his hair was\nthen decidedly thick and curly, as shown in the portrait\nprefixed to his Collected Poems.\" Here we have another instance\nof the analyst's mental process. She saw Mr. Noel once only,\nbut has more faith in her own recollection than in the fresh\nand safer memory of the poet's daughter.\nI point out all these little facts in order to show the new\nexperimenters' \" mentality.\" They are acting upon faith and\nenthusiasm, but they do not appear to be guided by calm\nand unprejudiced reason. The careful reader will find a number\nof similar instances.\n\flxv.] Gorrespondances croisees et la Methocle experimentale. 137\nAnd I may say it again most expressedly, there is not the\nslightest doubt in my mind about the sincerity and the good\nfaith of the mediums or of the analysts. They are unconsciously\nguided by their feelings and their sentiments, and they are\nnot in a position sufficiently broadminded to perceive what\ndoes not fit with their immediate wants. They suffer from a\nkind of monoideism, which tends to the overlooking of any\nfact contrary to their own notions, provided of course that\nsuch facts be not too striking.\nThe danger arising from such tendencies is the more serious\nthe more we deal with impressions, not with facts. And here\nwe encounter the gravest peril of the new methods. They\nare ultimately founded upon analogy and symbolism. The duty\nof Psychical Kesearchers, true to the old and prudent spirit\nof the founders of the Society, is to protest against the intro-\nduction of methods in which imagination plays too great a\npart.\nAnalogy and symbolism may have their proper value when\nused in their proper places ; but they are outside the realm of\nscientific inquiry. Symbols, when they are fixed by tradition,\nas the case may be in Religion, Art, Secret Societies, etc., may\nhave a definite meaning. In other cases they have not, and\none finds in the symbol what one has already put into it.\nA very remarkable instance of the resources offered by\nsymbolism is shown in Mr. Piddington's Report (Vol. XXII.r\np. 182).\nA knot of bine ribbon, is \" no more than a first attempt to\nget the name John.\" Why ? Because there is a piece of\npoetry in which occur both the name John and the words\n\" a bunch of blue ribbon.\" Can we really seriously discuss such\narguments ? The damage would not be great if we had to\ndeal only with sporadic illustrations of the new method.\nUnfortunately we meet with it everywhere.\nThe worst point of this method is its indetermination. There\nare a number of solutions to such indeterminate problems. Mr.\nPiddington is, however, well aware of the necessity of precision.\nHe gives us some very good rules on the subject in his answer\nto some criticisms {Light, 1904, p. 447) about the prediction\nof the Servian assassinations. \" The central fact of a pre-\ndiction must be beyond intelligent anticipation ; the prediction\n\f138 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nmust contain a sufficient number of detailed statements about\nthe time, place and other circumstances to justify its fulfilment,\nbeing attributed not to chance coincidence or some oilier known\ncauser\nWhat are we to think of Mrs. Verrall's intimation of future\nevents according to these rules of evidence ? And what are\nwe to think of cross-correspondences, when there are such con-\nstant discrepancies about the time ? Where is the \" one rule\nfor all \" standard ?\nI fear that if the new method is allowed to obtain in our\nexperiments, our conclusions might lose much of their evidential\nvalue.\nWe must not forget that psychical phenomena, either of\nthe physical or of the intellectual type, are very difficult to\ninvestigate. I do not wish to vindicate here the value of the\nfirst, T want only to point out that both types seem to have\nthe same apparent origin, our subconscious self, and that the\nstudy of the latter is still more complicated than the inves-\ntigation of the former. If physical phenomena be observed,\nwe have only to guard ourselves against illusion and deception.\nBut if we can observe them again and again, we can gradually\nnarrow the field of uncertainty, we have to deal with a\nmaterial fact.\nIn intellectual phenomena, on the contrary, we are confronted\nby a great number of unknown data, the darkest of which are\nthe subliminal memories and faculties of the mediums. We\ncannot test them with any degree of certainty, especially when\nwe deal with known or published facts.\nAnd we must not think that if we meet with fraud in\nthe physical phenomena, we do not meet with it in the\nintellectual. Frauds are easier to practise, consciously or\nunconsciously in the latter, and they are more difficult to\ndetect.\nAnd there is a double form of fraud in the intellectual\ntype of phenomena,\u2014the medium's fraud and the control's\nfraud. If an entranced medium gives a spurious physical\nphenomenon, we say that there is cheating and deceit. We\nshould not hold in every case the normal personality respon-\nsible for the fraud ; but as a rule we make no distinctions\nand we discard the medium, though the responsibility may\n\fLXV.] Correspondances croisees et la Methode experimentcde. 139\nfall exclusively on the somnambulic personality, that is on the\nso-called control.\nA fraud, in the physical type of phenomena, is a kind of\nlie ; when we detect lies in the messages of the control, what\nare we to decide ? Is there an essential difference between\na lying control and a cheating one ? I might here write\nmany things about control-psychology, but I want only to\nshow the analogies and the difficulties. Cross-correspondences,\nsuch as we have them now, are particularly open to criticism\nof this nature.\nThe evidence collected is, I think, unable to demonstrate\nthe fact of spirit agenc}^. We want a proof, and we must\nbe exacting in our tests ; the system of cross-correspon-\ndences is founded upon negative facts ; the mediums have\nno knowledge of the antecedent publications, they have not\nheard of them, they have not practised deception, they have\nnot exchanged letters, they have not met, and got useful\ninformation, etc. Negative facts are an unsafe basis, for they\nare always liable to be discarded when we get a positive\none.\nA positive fact, on the contrary, stands by itself and has a\npermanent value. We want such facts and such proofs. Cross-\ncorrespondences cannot give them. Cases like the incidents\nquoted by S. Moses (Abraham Florentine, Mrs. Abercrombie,\netc.) are more striking and have a stronger evidential value.\nThe same might be said of Mrs. Piper's early experiments.\n(See Mr. Hyslop's paper, Jour. Am. S.P.B., September, 1909.)\nThey do not exclude the possibility of telepathy, or of clair-\nvoyance, but the cross-correspondences do not exclude it either.\nM. Pigou has, I think, clearly shown that even cross-corre-\nspondences of the mosaic type may be due to fragmentary\ntelepathic thought-transference.\nI do not see how we could prove that telepathy cannot\nexplain fragmentary and complementary thought-transference,\neven if we admit that the cross-correspondences quoted possess\nalways such a character, which I think not.\nThe line of enquiry followed by the experimenters seems to\nlead to \" nowhere \" ; ineffectual in their possible results, their\nmethods of investigation appear to be defective from a technical\npoint of view. Too many questions are asked at the same\n\f140 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\ntime ; an experimenter takes a dream for a real event, another\nforgets the question asked some weeks before, etc. The controls\nare too often guided so benevolently that they need not fish.\n(Hope, Star and Browning, Dante, Abt Vogler, etc.)\nLastly, I fear that the new style of phenomena may not\nagree with Mrs. Piper's mediumship. In some of the sittings\nthe experiment amounted simply to thought-transference (civto?\novpavog aicv\/uwv, Plotinus, the Latin Message), but she gave the\ncorrect answer with much difficulty. Her former sittings were,\nI think, singularly more interesting. It would have been better\nnot to interfere with her controls and her style of mediumship.\nImperator, Prudens (Plotinus), Hector (St. Hippolytus), Doctor\n( Athenodorus), Mentor (Algazzali) are certainly not the same\ncontrols as their similarly named ones of Mr. Moses, and are\npainfully inferior to them.\nSince Mr. Hodgson's lamented death it seems that the old\nform of mediumship, the trance-utterance, is regaining its lost\nground. The best results have been given in the waking-stage,\nduring which the old verbal automatism is used.\nThe same might be said of Mrs. Holland. Her imitation\nof Mrs. Verrall's scripts does not appear to be really desirable.\nThe safest course to take, in dealing with automatic phenomena,\nis to leave the manifestation alone as much as possible. The\nonly conditions on which we must insist are those concerning\nthe sincerity and good observation of the phenomenon ; these\nconditions excepted, it is better to watch the spontaneous de-\nvelopment of the facts without attempting to guide them\naccording to our limited views. We have almost everything\nto learn about automatism, and it might be safer, and more\nscientific, to study first the laws governing automatic mental\nprocesses. When we know them, we shall be better prepared\nfor grasping the problem of their supra-human causes. In\nsuch a study many points, however, are worthy of attention.\nTheir interesting features are not sensational, and are, of course,\nfar from the main point at issue, but I fear that we must\nstudy carefully the psychological process involved in the various\nmodes of automatic expression before we are really able to\ninvestigate their spiritual kernel.\nThe difficulty lies in the identity of the communicating\nintelligence. It is sometimes quite easy to trace the source of\n\flxv.] Correspondances croisees et la Me'thode experimentale. 141\nthe message, which, in nine cases out of ten, is in the auto-\nmatist's own mind.\nIn the tenth case, we cannot discover the spring from which\nflows the information, but we are not entitled to conclude,\nfrom our inability to trace the normal source of knowledge, that\na supernormal one must be admitted. For reasons already\nexplained, we cannot rely on the automatists themselves for\ninstructing us ; we have to deal with their subconsciousness,\nand the normal self is not aware of the amount of knowledge\nstored up in the subliminal memory.\nHence the radical objection which is to be made to cross-\ncorrespondences. They may serve as evidence for telepathy,\nbut they cannot go farther, and even in these narrow limits\nthey are not of great value. They concern words, or ideas,\nwhich are to be found in books easily obtainable. All the\nliterary references, of which the latest papers make so much,\nseem to me consequently very uncertain evidence.\nMoreover, we are not in a position to exclude the possi-\nbility of various modes of supernormal acquisition of knowledge,\nsuch as clairvoyance ; even in the Spirit hypothesis how can\nwe be sure that we are in touch with the real personality\npurporting to communicate and not with a personating spirit ?\n1\nBut I am not prepared to discuss such remote possibilities.\nI allude to their existence in order to show how many diffi-\nculties creep into the investigation of spirit agency.\nOur immediate work, I think, ought to be chiefly directed\nto the study of the psychological processes of automatic\nmessages.\nErrors, and their cause, are very instructive. No serious study\nof the subject appears to have been made. I believe that the\nexperimenters whose work I am criticising are well qualified\nfor achieving serious progress in our knowledge of these psycho-\nlogical questions ; we must clear them up before gaining a sure\nground ; we cannot hope to make any safe advance without\nsuch preliminary work.\n1\nPrudence grows with increasing experience. Here is M. Stainton Moses's\nopinion on Spirit-Identity :\n\" At the time I should not have seriously questioned\nthe identity of these Beings. But there are problems connected with the\nquestion of identity which are ponderously difficult, and I am by no means\nsure that we have the means of settling them,\" Light, 1884, p. 2.52.\n\f142 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nMrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland, and the other automatists are\nintelligent, cultured, observing minds. They are endowed with\nremarkable powers, which give them every facility for a study,\nthe necessity of which I am advocating.\nHow ought to be conducted such a work ? Many methods\nmight be used, and 1 am not prepared to discuss their value.\nI have observed cases similar to Mrs. Verrall's or Mrs\nHolland's experiences. For instance, I have a very curious\nrecord of messages concerning the Eusso-Japanese war, untrue\nalmost without exception, but anticipating sometimes the false\nnews given by the papers. I noticed cases akin to this one\nin Mrs. Verrall's report.\nWhy does such false news creep into the scripts ? Is there\na special telepathy, originated in the mind of the newsmonger ?\nIs there a selective telepathy, acting according to affinities of\nrace, culture, civilisation, and propagating its waves in certain\ndirections rather than in others ? The problem is difficult and\ncomplex, but there are simpler ones.\nCan we get at the real process of telepathy ? Sir Oliver\nLodge has already shown how important would be the solution\nof the question. Well, the study of errors can give us some\ninsight into the process.\nFor instance, in Miss Johnson's first report, Vol. XXL,\npp. 346-348, we read that Mrs. Holland tried to get some\nimpressions by psychometry ; she held a glove and had the\nimpression of \" Lincoln. The bronze is out of place.\"\nThe owner of the glove (which had belonged to the late son\nof Mrs. Forbes) had a bust of Washington, which at the time\nwas out of its usual place.\nHere we have a curious error. Lincoln and Washington\nwere both Presidents of the U.S. of America. We are led to\nthink, in this case, that no sensory image was transmitted\nWashington and Lincoln were not alike. We suspect then\nthat a mere idea was conveyed, that of a bust, and of a\nPresident of the American Eepublic. But why Lincoln ?\nThe emergence of this name is perhaps due to a working\nout of the root impression by the conscious self or by the\nstrata of the subliminal which are nearer to the normal\nconsciousness.\nAn observation of mine points to such an explanation. A\n\fLxv.] Govrespondances croisees et la Methode experimentale. 143\nmedium\u2014not a professional one\u2014describing the sitter's grand-\nmother, with sufficient accuracy, gave her name as \" Clementine.\"\nThe answer was noted as incorrect, the real name being\n\" Augustine.\" But the family used to call the dead lady\nMaman Tine, and in the familiar nickname we have the three\nlast syllables of the wrong name. Clementine is, I think,\nalmost the only usual name terminating in \" mentine \" in\nFrench.\nIs there a kind of correction worked out by the mind, in\nthose cases of supranormal perception, correction which could\nbe compared with the building of an illusory optical image\nout of disconnected blots or shapes ?\nThe same study could be made in cases where impressions\nget mixed up. when, for instance, a person is correctly\ndescribed, but is depicted with the dress of another. How\ndoes the mixing up creep in ? Observations, if repeated and\ncarefully made, might give clues to the process.\nSome observations seem to show that the percipient gets an\nimpression, not of an abstract idea, but of a concrete element\nof the image. Things seen by the supposed agent, when he\nwas very young, are sometimes described by the sensitive as\nlarger than they were really : in one case, the description of\na room was incorrect, inasmuch as what was on the right side\nwas said to be on the left, and vice versa. The sensitive\nseemed to see an inverted image, as in a looking-glass. Did\nhe perceive something like a print of the former perception\nexisting somewhere in the agent's brain ?\nIn the same case, the sensitive said that \" butterflies were\npinned to the wall of the room, above a desk.\" There were\nno butterflies, but on the wall was hung a picture, \" La femme\naux papillons.\" The idea of butterflies was only picked up\nand interpreted either by the conscious or unconscious mind.\nIt might be possible to discover which of the two parts of\nthe mind is responsible for these interpretations : such a\nknowledge would be full of meaning.\nThus the study of errors may be very useful, and we can\ninvestigate their modes, processes, and perhaps even their\ncauses with some chances of success. A French author, Mr.\nDuchatel, published last year a book on Psychometry, where\nthe subject is tackled.\n\f144 Joseph Maxwell, M.D. [part\nIt is not necessary, however, to show how many things\nmay be investigated in the unknown fields of Psychical\nKesearch ; the work is as yet at its beginning.

MAXWELL'S PAPER.\nThe interpretation of the automatic writings which have been\npresented to the Society of recent years, and the inter-\nconnexions between them, constitute so complicated a problem\nthat there are probably few\u2014even among our own members\nwho have attempted to work at it seriously, and there are fewer\nstill who have favoured us with any systematic observations\nthereon. We welcome, therefore, the above contribution from\nDr. Maxwell, who will be well known to most of our readers\nas the author of Les PMnomenes Psychiqiues.\nHis paper is clearly the result of a painstaking study of\nthe large mass of published material ; and as such clearly\nmerits a reply. We shall reserve the publication of this\nreply to a later Part of Proceedings ; but meanwhile it may\nbe well to point out in general terms that Dr. Maxwells paper\ncontains mistakes as to facts, and that his criticism is to a\nlarge extent based on a fundamental misapprehension of the\nviews of the writers whom he is criticising as to what is\nand what is not evidential of supernormal activity. Their aim\nhas been to give, if not a complete, at least a representative,\nview of the phenomena as a whole, and not only of their\nevidential aspect. This was pre-eminently the case with Mrs.\nVerrall's report on her own script, while she and all the\nother writers have emphasised again and again the subjective\nelement in a large proportion of all the scripts.\nIn so doing they have acted consistently with the general\nprinciple of the S.P.R., which does not confine itself to the\npublication of \" evidential \" facts, but includes in its survey\nwhatever incidents appear to be of psychological interest or\ninstructive in any way, no matter whether they tell for or\nagainst a supernormal hypothesis. This has been so long the\npractice in S.P.R. publications that it is not always considered\nnecessary to state in so many words to which category a fact\nis supposed to belong, especially as this may often be a\nK\n\f14C Editorial Note. [part\nmatter of opinion. The great majority of our readers have\nprobably understood this practice ; but it seems clear that Dr.\nMaxwell has not understood it.\nThus, for instance, he brings forward various incidents as\nevidence of cryptomnesia (subliminal memory) as though the\nwriters he is criticising had ignored this explanation ;\nwhereas,\nas a matter of fact, in nearly every instance, they have either\nexplicitly stated or allowed it to be understood that they\nregarded those incidents as probable or possible examples of\ncryptomnesia. If there is any difference between them and\nDr. Maxwell in this matter, it is that they are sometimes\nless confident than he is that cryptomnesia is a complete\nexplanation in a given case, and so have been careful to\nlay before the reader all the evidence in their possession,\nwhether it told for or against that explanation. An extract\nfrom Miss Johnson's First Eeport on the Automatic Writing\nof Mrs. Holland may perhaps suffice to put the reader on his\nguard against accepting too readily the charge that Dr.\nMaxwell has brought against them of having paid too slight\nattention to the possibilities of cryptomnesia\n\" The whole study of this case tends to confirm the view\nthat no statement in automatic script that has ever [previously\nappeared] in print, or is of such a nature as to be known to\na good many people, can be regarded as really good evidence\nof supernormal knowledge.\" 1\nIn replying to Dr. Maxwell, an effort will be made to\nexplain further the general principles that have guided the\nwriters in their exposition and discussion of the scripts, as\nwell as to deal in some detail with Dr. Maxwell's criticisms\nof individual cases.\ni Proceedings, Vol. XXL, p. 36S.\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment. 147\nIV.\nTHE LATIN MESSAGE EXPERIMENT.\nBy MRS. ANNA HUDE, Ph.D. (Copenhagen).\nOne of the most interesting experiments described by Mr.\nPiddington in his well-known paper, A Series of Concordant\nAutomatisms, is no doubt the one called The Latin Message.1\nBut at the same time it is one whose value has been much\ndisputed ;\nMr. Podmore in his last work, The Newer\nSpiritualism, made it the subject of a destructive criticism,\nbased on the assertion that the Piper-Myers never understood\nthe message ; Mr. Bayfield, in his review of the book, sub-\nscribes to this assertion.- This is what I myself must do\nbut with the conclusions drawn from it by the two authors I\nentirely disagree, and I should be glad to give here my\nreasons for so doing.\nEeaders of the Proceedings will remember the outlines of the\nexperiment. In Latin, and in purposely intricate and difficult\nsentences, the trance-personality called MyersP is asked to try\na new and complex type of cross-correspondence by giving to\ntwo mediums two different messages, with apparently no con-\nnection between them, and afterwards to a third medium a\nthird message revealing the hidden connection. Some time\nafter the transmission of this message MyersP asks Mr. Pid-\ndington whether Mrs. Verrall has received his reference to Hope,\nBrowning, and Star, and thus directs his attention to a script of\nMrs. Verrall's where Browning's poem AM Vogler is mentioned.\nMr. Piddington reads Alt Vogler, and there finds a passage\nwhich seems to him to symbolise in an appropriate and\ningenious manner the idea of the co-operation of the three\nmediums expressed in the Latin message ; in music, the poet\nsays, the gift is allowed to man \" that out of three sounds\n1 Proceedings, Vol. XXII., pp. 312-416. 2\nIbid. Vol. XXV., p. 78.\n\f148 Mrs. Anna Hade, Ph.D. [part\nhe frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.\" As, moreover, the\nscript begins with the word Aster (i.e. star), and Miss Verrall\na few days after its production has drawn a star, it seems\nprobable to Mr. Piddington that MyersP has in this way meant\nto answer the message, and that all that is now wanting is\nhis affirmation through Mrs. Piper of this being really the\ncase. A couple of months pass with no definite result ; but\nat last the name Alt Voglcr is spelt out ; a fortnight later\nthe line about the fourth sound and the star is given. And\nin two sittings with Sir Oliver Lodge MyersP clearly states\nthat this line contains his answer to the Latin message.\n1\nThus presented, with a great many details omitted, the\nexperiment looks fairly successful. Put there is one circum-\nstance which cannot be omitted. When MyersP in his two\nmeetings with Sir Oliver Lodge shortly recapitulates the whole\nexperiment, he shows no comprehension whatever of its\nleading idea ; he knows of no cross-correspondence save the\nsimple one between two mediums, viz. Mrs. Verrall and\nMrs. Piper.\n2\nBut, this being the case, how is the line about\nthe fourth sound and the star to be accounted for ? No\nlonger a symbol of the co-operation of three mediums, it has\nlost its meaning in relation to the message. And yet MyersP\nhas quoted it as an appropriate reply.\nNo doubt it is some such train of thought that has, for\ninstance, made Mr. Balfour 3\ndeclare \" that he feels inclined\nto put the Alt Voglcr incident in the class of thought-\ntransference from those present \" ; Mr. Podmore 4\ngoes further,\nand sums up the result of the whole experiment in the ver-\ndict \" that the Piper-Myers is an intelligence of distinctly\ninferior capacity \" ; and Mr. Bayfield, in his review, says that\nthe incident \" has always seemed to him peculiarly damaging\nto his claims.\" But is it possible to aecpiiesce in this result?\nHas not every reader who has followed MyersP through the\nnumerous dialogues where the Latin message is dealt with felt\n1 \" The lines which 1 quoted before [viz. 'instead of a fourth sound came a\nstar'] were the most appropriate I could find.\"\n2 \" He wished me to give a message through Mrs. Verrall and this light\nconcerning the same subject.\"\n3\nThe Hibbert Journal of Jan., 1909, p. 259.\n4\nThe Newer Spiritualism, p. 254.\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment. 149\nthat qualities are there displayed not to be accounted for by\nthought-transference nor bearing the stamp of mental incapacity ?\nIt is true that the issue of the experiment is self-contradictory,\nand can only be explained on the presumption of some mis-\nunderstanding having taken place between the trance-personality\nand the experimenters. But, if we review its different phases\nin the light of the whole of it, I believe we shall find that\nsuch is the case ;\nmoreover, that the misunderstanding will be\nthe means of revealing the trance-personality as more inde-\npendent and, perhaps, more intelligent than a successful ex-\nperiment might have done. Along these lines, then, I beg\nthe readers to accompany me, though the task cannot, I fear,\nbe so easy as I could wish.\nThe message, which I think it necessary to give in ex-\ntenso, runs as follows\nDiversis internuntiis quod invicem inter se respondentia jamdudum\ncommittis, id nec fallit nos consilium, et vehementer probamus,\nUnum accesserit gratissimum nobis, si, cum duobus quibusdam ea\ntradideris, inter quae nullus appareat nexus, postea quam primum\nrem per tertium aliquem ita perficias, ut latens illud in prioribus\nexplicetur.\nThe literal translation into English is as follows\nAs to the fact that for some long time past you have been entrusting\nto different intermediaries things which correspond mutually between\nthemselves, we have observed your design, and we cordially approve\nit. One thing besides this most agreeable to us will have happened\nif, when you shall have delivered to two particular persons things\nbetween which no connection is apparent, afterwards as soon as\npossible through some third person you so complete the matter that\nthat which was latent in the first two may be revealed.\nThe message was dictated in small portions in five sittings\nfrom Dec. 17, 1906, to Jan. 2, 1907. It appeared to be\nextremely difficult for the trance-personalities to catch the\nsound of it. Again and again the words and sentences had\nto be repeated, long after the whole of it had been delivered.\nThus jamdudum committis was spelt out twice on Jan. 16 :\nmost of the message was repeated on Jan. 23 ; the first\nsentence on Feb. 19, with a special repetition of jamdudum ;\n\f150 Mrs. Anna Hade, Ph.D. [part\nand the last sentence on Feb. 27 and later. And yet it\nseems to have reached MyersP in fragments only ; a natural\nconsequence of its being, presumably, transmitted orally through\nan intermediary who did not himself (or herself) understand\none word of it. It is true that Mr. Piddin\u00b0;ton at the begin-\no o\nning of the experiment had asked \" Hector \" if he had any\nmeans of registering permanently the words dictated to him;\nbut Eector had made no answer, and from many following\nincidents it is evident that he did not do this, but repeated\nthe Latin \" by sound \"} On account of this slow and uncer-\ntain method of transmission all efforts for a long time must\nbe directed to the translation of the message, as a necessary\nintroduction to its being replied to. On Jan. 2, while the\nlast sentence was still incomplete, Eector said :\n\" Hodgson is\nhelping Myers with his translation \" ; a little later MyersP\nhimself expressed his willingness to translate the Latin. On\nFeb. 27 he said that he had wished to translate the whole\nmessage into English ; in his own opinion he had then\ntranslated the beginning of it. That the trance-personalities\nmight have accomplished the feat, if all the words had\nreached them correctly, is made probable among other things\nfrom an incident which took place on Feb. 19. Mr. Pidding-\nton was repeating some of the Latin to HodgsonP on behalf\nof MyerSp ; when he had pronounced jamdudum committis\nHodgsonP asked for \" the next to the last word \" to be\nrepeated once more. Mr. Piddington now told him that the\nfirst syllable was \" spelt like the English word jam\u2014preserves.\"\n\" Oh yes, I understand, Marmalade,\" Hodgson P exclaimed\u2014and\nthe difficulty was conquered ; the word once really grasped its\nmeaning was understood immediately, for at the following\nsittings jamdudum was rightly translated \" long since \". At\nthe same time, if a simple syllable like jam was so difficult\nto grasp, it is no wonder that a correct transmission of the\nwhole message proved impossible.\nUnder these circumstances MyersP of course could not for a\n1\nSee his remarks to Dr. Hodgson on Feb. 25, 1903 :\n\" We do not clearly\nsee the registering as thou dost.

Mr. Piddington informs me that Eector or Hodgsonp somewhere\nclaimed to be able to make a permanent register, but perhaps this could not\nbe done immediately.\n\flxv.] The Latin Message Experiment. 151\nlong while think of answering the message ; several times he\nbegged Mr. Piddington to be patient with him.1\nBut an im-\npression of its general meaning he had no doubt received. An\nutterance to Mr. Piddington on Jan. 23 points to this: \"I\nbelieve,\" he says, \" I can send you a message which will please\nyou, if I understand it [the message] clearly.\" The conception\nhe had formed appears in his first attempt to reply. The idea\nhe got, he says on Feb. 20, repeating it on Feb. 27, was that\nlie should be a messenger, an intermediary. It is the word\ninternuntiis he has misheard as internv.ntius and applied to\nhimself, while in the message it is used to designate another\nkind of intermediaries\u2014the mediums or automatists. The con-\nsequences of his being led to think of himself as an inter-\nmediary between the living and the dead, between earth and\n\" heaven \", will appear later. That he got no further in his\nunderstanding of the message was for one thing 2\ndue to the\nfact that the part referring to the third medium at this point\nhad, so to speak, disappeared from the problem. On Jan. 23\nMyerSp had told Mr. Piddington that he would like to go\nover \" the first and second sentences \" of the message ; Mr.\nPiddington had then repeated it from the beginning as far as\nnexus. Possibly MyersP thought that he had now got the\nwhole message ;\n3\nin any case the difficulties of transmission\nmake it unthinkable that its final sentence should have been\nunderstood at an earlier date ; thus for a time it was com-\npletely lost sight of.\nThis was the situation immediately before the production of\nMrs. Verrall's script of Jan. 28, destined to play a prominent\npart in the history of the message. A fortnight later, on\nFeb. 11, the following conversation took place between MyersP\nand Mr. Piddinoton :\nM. Did she [Mrs. Verrall] receive the word Evangelical?\nMr. P. I don't know, but I will enquire.\n1 See on Jan. 15 and 16, Feb. 6 and 12.\n2 Another ground for his acquiescing in his first conception of the message\nis to be found in the circumstance that Mr. Piddington, to prevent him from\nguessing the real point of it, had, on Jan. 16, highly recommended cross-cor-\nrespondences of the simple type. Myersp had, in this way, been led to regard\nthem with increased interest; vide Rector's remark on Jan. 22 (Proc, Vol.\nXXII., p. 231): \"Myers is specially interested in taking messages.\"\n3\nCf. p. 155, note.\n\f152 Mrs. Anna Hude, Plt.D. [part\nM. I referred also to Browning again.\nMr. P. Do you remember what your exact reference to Browning was 1\nM. Yes. I referred to Hope and Browning. I also said Star.\nHe was interrupted here, but before departing said :\n\" Mean-\nwhile look out for Hope Star and Browning.\"\nIn the sittings of Feb. 27 and March 6 it became evident\nthat Evangelical was a mistake for Evelyn, this name together\nwith Hope being the title of one of Browning's poems, while\nStar referred to another, My Star ; but of course it was impos-\nsible to suspect this at that time. Mr. Picldington found in\nMrs. Verrall's script of Jan. 28 both Star (Aster) and, among\ndivers quotations from Browning, the line \" the hope that\nleaves the earth for the sky,\" where hope had been substituted\nfor \" passion \", and by means of this substitution, perhaps, the\"\nmore emphasised. So on the following day he told MyersP\nthat \" the message he said he gave to Mrs. Verrall about\nBrowning, Star and Hope \" had come out clearly. MyersP\nwas very pleased to hear this, and it will be seen that after-\nwards he felt sure that Evelyn Hope and My Star had\nappeared in a script of Mrs. Ar errall's.\nAbout a week after this incident, on Feb. 20, MyersP made\nhis first attempt to reply to the Latin message. It was with\nextremely different preconceptions that he and Mr. Piddington\ncame together on this day\u2014Mr. Piddington filled with the\nidea that the message had already been answered ;\nMyersP\nhesitating, conscious that his understanding of it was incomplete. 1\nAs might be expected, the result was small. MyersP began 2\n\" The idea I got was that I should be a messenger and hand\nthrough [i.e. committor] coherent messages [i.e. invicem inter se\nrespondentia] to you \"\n; but as Mr. Piddington remained silent\nonly asking for repetition of an illegible word\u2014he interrupted\nhimself and said :\n\" I will go over my utterances again and\nrepeat them here to you.\" This it was agreed upon should be\ndone a week later.\n1\nSee his utterances on Feb. 11 : \"I will let you know at our next meeting\nhow far I have understood\" ; and on Feb. '21 : \"As far as I could understand,\nand I may have to think it over again ...\"\n2\nOf course I must abbreviate the extracts, skipping repetitions and the\nlike ; but I trust that the reader will find I have omitted nothing that has\nany bearing upon the question.\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment.\nAnd this time he is determined to give his opinion. On\nthe whole, it is characteristic of the Latin message case that\nthe trance-personality, when at a standstill, far from making\nguesses or feeling his way, simply defers his answer to a later\nsitting, and in the mean time seems to go on with his own\ntrain of thought. On Feb. 27 MyersP , on meeting Mr. Pid-\ndington, immediately reverts to the question. Assuming as\nbefore that it is he who is the internxmtius of the message, he\ngives the following version of its beginning :\n\" Although you\nas intermediary have long since united mutually ideas, you fail,\"\ncontinuing without reference to the actual words :\n\" to convince\nus of your existence.\" Jamdudum has here found its place as\n\" long since \", and \" united mutually ideas \" shows better than\nthe earlier translation\u2014\" coherent messages \"\n\u2014that invicem inter\nsc respondentia has been comprehended. Quod has been taken\nto mean \" although \"\n;\n\" you fail \" is a mistake, caused probably\nby the Latin word fallit : a mistake, however, which is the\noutcome of a most logical reasoning. MyersP has no knowledge\nof the plan about the third medium, and, therefore, must\nbelieve that it is a simple cross-correspondence he \" as interme-\ndiary \" is asked to bring about ; this is what he has \" long since\n\"\ndone ;\naccordingly, something must be wrong with his former\nexperiments. How necessary it is for him to state things\nlogically is seen from the paraphrase of the same sentence\nhe on May 27 gives to Sir Oliver Lodge. Then he has long\naero understood that the message contained no blame against\nhim ; so he gives the beginning of it in the following words :\n\" You have long since been trying to assimilate ideas.\" It is\n''\nfailed \" in disguise\u2014indispensable if the want of a new cross-\ncorrespondence should be properly explained.\nThis much for the translation. Even Mr. Podmore admits\nthat it would be impossible to give it without some knowledge\nof Latin. The mistake of it\u2014the belief of MyersP that his\nperformances were thought unconvincing\u2014was, however, destined\nto have far-reaching consequences. It led him to mention a\nfew of these performances, and among them Browning's poems\nEvelyn Hope and My Star. The importance of this will appear\nfrom an extract of the conversation held on Peb. 27 between\nhimself and Mr. Piddington. MyersP has given his \" transla-\ntion \" and continues\n\f154 Mrs. Anna Hude, Ph.D. [part\nNow I believe that since you sent this message to me I have\nsufficiently replied to your various questions to convince the\nordinary scientific mind that I am at least a fragment of\nthe once incarnate individual whom you called Myers.\nMr. P.

I understood that you asked me to reply referring to my\nutterances through Mrs. Verrall.\nMr. P. Now I think you have done enough for to-day in the\nmatter of replying to the Latin message.\nMyerSp then asked for the last sentence of the Latin to\nbe repeated, which was done. Afterwards Mr. Piddington\nsaid :\nI want to say that you have, I believe, given an answer worthy\nof your intelligence\u2014not to-day, I mean, but some time back\n\u2014but the interpretation must not be mine.

My Star. Evely. ... I am too [weak] to tell it to-day. My\nthoughts wander. . . .\nSeen in the light of later developments, it will probably be\nclear to all readers that Mr. Piddington and MyersP have\nspoken of quite different things. MyersP does not mean that\nhe has answered the Latin message, but mentions his replies\nto Mr. Piddington's various questions and the cross-correspon-\ndences between Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Verrall as performances\nthat are not quite despicable. When in the midst of this\nMr. Piddington reverts to the Latin message, he doesn't seem\nto comprehend why the conversation has been turned that\nway, but says with some astonishment :\n\" I understood that you\nasked me to reply referring to my utterances through Mrs.\nVerrall,\" i.e. to the cross-correspondences. And beginning now\nto suspect that Mr. Piddington is speaking of something he\ndoesn't understand, he asks for a repetition of the last sentence\nof the message. Afterwards Mr. Piddington praises him for\nthe reply already given, but adds that he must explain it\nthrough Mrs. Piper. MyersP tries to escape with a vague\n\" Yes,\" but Mr. Piddington continues :\n\" You could do it in\ntwo words.\" It is fatal, but not to be wondered at, that\nMyerSp believes that Mr. Piddington has in mind the two\nwords of the cross-correspondence that has formerly been spoken\nof as a great success Hope and Star. Evidently he is unable\nto understand his enthusiasm on receiving them,1\nand quite\nat a loss when asked to \" bring out one more point.\" He\nx At this point lie offers to reply, then and there, remarking that the whole\nof the last sentence has now reached his understanding, thus implying that\nhe has not understood it before. As his offer is not accepted, it is impossible\nto conjecture what and how much he has really grasped. To judge from\nlater sittings, and from the manner in which the first sentence was received,\nit has been fragments only (cf. p. 169, note 1).\n\f156 Mrs. Anna Hude, Ph.D. [part\nmakes a feeble attempt to explain, faltering out at last the\nreal titles of the two poems, and leaves the matter there for\nthe time being.\nAs usual MyerSp apparently does some thinking before he\ngoes to another meeting. Meanwhile, I want to point out\nhow strongly the view taken above is confirmed by the con-\nversation, on March G, between Mr. Piddington and the\ntrance-personality \" George Pelham \", who seems determined to\nthrow a little light upon the case. \" Did he [i.e. Myers] tell\nyou about My Star ?\n\" he asks. \" He did,\n-\n'\nMr. Piddington\nreplies ;\n\" can you explain about My Star ?\n\" \" Yes it was a\npoem he had on his mind of Browning's.\" \" And why had\nhe this poem on his mind ?\n\" \" He said because it was one\nof his test experiments with a lady in the body to whom he\nrefers as V. He also had another : Evelyn\u2014Evelyn Hope.\"\n\" Is that the explanation of the word which came out here\nas Evangelical ?\n\" \" Yes.\"\nNothing could be clearer. Afterwards George Pelham repeats\nthe \" translation \" given by MyersP of the beginning of the\nmessage, adding to it as follows :\n\" Now if you can give a\nclear message through Mrs. V. and reproduce it here it will\nconvince.\" A little later he says :\n\" And the answer was\nthat lie had given a message, viz. Browning Star Hope, and\nreproduced it here.\" This is what George Pelham feels justi-\nfied in concluding from the sitting of Feb. 27 where Mr.\nPiddington had praised MyersP for his answer through Mrs.\nVerrall, and afterwards warmly thanked him for the repetition\nof the three words. Mr. Piddington replies :\n\" You show a\ngeneral knowledge of the meaning of the message ; but one\nspecial point you have not brought out. The answer he gave\nto Mrs. Verrall was clever and characteristic ; but though he\nhas referred to that here, he has not made it clear here why\nit was so appropriate.\"\nIn these words Mr. Piddington has confirmed the conception\nof the Latin message as referring to cross-correspondence between\nMrs. Verrall and Mrs. Piper ; he has stated that he believes\nit to have been answered through Mrs. Verrall and a reference\nto this answer to be contained in the words Hope, Star and\nBrowning. From this moment the actual message has lost\nall importance. George Pelham, on asking for a repetition of\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment 157\nthe \" lines in Latin \" which referred to the \" special point \",\ngot the last sentence spelt out ; but it is evident that small\nuse was made of the fragments which eventually came through,1\n\u2014the trance-personalities taking it for granted that they con-\ntained much the same as Mr. Piddington's own utterances.\nWhat in this way was put into them may be seen from the\nversion MyersP , on May 27, gave of the message to Sir Oliver\nLodge; \"he [Mr. Piddington] mentioned my own words in\nit,\" he says, \" viz. the survival of bodily death \" ; this expression\nfrom the title of Frederic Myers's great work had been used\nby Mr. Piddington on Feb. 27 in connection with the message.\n2\nThus MyerSp never got to know what Mr. Piddington had\nreally wanted him to do. A new direction was given to the\nexperiment, and MyersP had got a quite new task before him.\nAfter the sitting of Feb. 27, and still more after George\nPelham's conversation with Mr. Piddington, he could not help\nseeing that the latter, when speaking of \" Hope Star Browning \",\nhad meant something different from what he had himself clone.\nWhen George Pelham had left, Rector says :\n\" I understand\nit was a cross-correspondence message and to her [Mrs. Verrall]\nhe gave the same words that I brought out here \" ; and\nMyersp adds :\n\" it was the poem in which Hope and Star\ncame out,\" thus showing that he no longer thinks that Mr.\nPiddington had referred to the two poems which had been\nthe subjects of his own experiments, but has begun to com-\nprehend that Mrs. Verrall's script contained another Browning-\npoem about hope and star.\nA question which here presents itself is that of the relation\nof MyersP to the script of Mrs. Verrall. It is a question,\nhowever, that can only be answered through the solving of\nthe larger problem\u2014that of the identity of MyersP . Here\nit must suffice to say that MyersP himself claims to take a\npart in the production of the script, and that his claim is\nsupported by the knowledge of it which he no doubt displays.\nHow far it is probable that he can have acquired this knowledge\nin other ways\u2014by mind-reading or through the utterances of\nthe experimenters\u2014the study of the case itself must show.\nProvisionally it must be allowable to adopt the first alter-\nnative.\n1\nV. p. 169, note 1. - V. p. 154.\n\f15S Mrs. Anna Hude, Ph.D. [part\nBut, even if we suppose that part of Mrs. Verrall's script is\ndue to impressions received from the personality who claims\nto be Myers, he could not know for certain whether those\nimpressions came really through ;\n\" I am very pleased to hear\nthat she fully registered the thoughts I indubitably gave her,\"\nhe says once, when told of a success.\n1\nAnd no doubt he\nmight in the course of time forget some of his attempts. In\nthe present case, it must be remembered that no script of\nMrs. Verrall had for MyersP the importance which Mr.\nPiddington ascribed to one of them\u2014that of being the answer\nto the Latin message. Neither could it be of much help to\nhim to have learned that Hope and Star played a part in\nthe poem, if he had not thought specially of these words\nwhen he gave it.\nWith Browning, however, it was quite different. There is\nevery reason to believe that the Latin message had made\nMyerSp think of Browning, as he himself says later. The\nmessage had made him realise his position as an intermediary\nbetween two worlds ; such a thought might well have filled\nhis mind with recollections of words and lines from this\npoet that speak of earth and heaven and the intercourse between\nthem, and induced him to attempt to bring them out in a\nscript of Mrs. Verrall's. Such a script had been produced\nand he seems to know of its existence even if he could have\nonly a general notion of its contents.\nThe script is that of Jan. 28, 1907, spoken of above, and\nruns as follows :\nAster [star]\nrepas [wonder]\nthe world's wonder\nAnd all a wonder and a wild desire.\nThe very wings of her\nA WINGED DESIRE\niVo7i-Tepos epws [winged love]\nThen there is Blake\nand mocked my loss of liberty.\nBut it is all the same thing\u2014 the winged desire epois ttoQulvos\n[passion] the hope that leaves the earth for the sky\u2014Abt\nl\nProc, Vol. XXII., p. 55.\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment. 159\nVogler\u2014for earth too hard that found itself or lost itself\nin the sky.\nThat is what I want\nOn the earth the broken sounds\nthreads\nIn the sky the perfect arc.\nThe C major of this life\nBut your recollection is at fault\nADB is the part that unseen completes the arc.\nNo doubt the personality who impressed these words was\nfilled with thoughts of an unseen world\u2014of the hope that leaves\nearth to find it, the winged desire that overleaps distance\u2014and\nstrove to express them through all that came to his mind about\nthat which was \" all the same thing \". That more may have been\nin his thoughts without gaining expression goes without saying.\nThat MyerSp had in his thoughts reverted to this script is\nseen already on March 6 before Mr. Piddington's conversation\nwith George Pelham. Spontaneously and for the first time he\nspeaks of his attempt to draw through Mrs. Verrall a circle and\na triangle. This refers to an experiment suggested by Mr. Pid-\ndington on Jan. 16, and though the drawings in the script of\nJan. 28 serve another purpose, it can scarcely be doubted that\nit is these figures MyersP is thinking of ;\nthey appear in no\nother script of Mrs. Verrall's. On March 13 he connects them\ndirectly with the Latin message.\n\fIGO Mrs. Anna Hucle, PJt.D. [part\nI have tried to trace the thoughts of MyersP after the sitting\nof Feb. 27. But of course he couldn't at once feel certain that\nhe was on the riqht track. When on March 13 Mr. Piddinsfton\nasked for a clear answer, he said openly :\n\" I think I can get\nyour idea and when it is quite clear to me I shall give my\nanswer. I believe I get a glimmer of what you wish.\" At\nthis time he is groping his way, so to speak. At the beginning\nof the sitting he himself had introduced the question, saying\n\" I understood your reference to the poem in your Latin message\nto me which led me to refer to Browning, and the circle gave\nme a better understanding of it, as it came to me through this\nlight. I helped Mrs. Verrall to draw it.\" As Mr. Piddington\ndid not understand this utterance, MyersP added :\n\" Re-read the\npart where you refer to the poem,\" and, Mr. Piddington now\ndenying that the message referred to a poem, he continued\n\" Not exactly to a poem, but it suggested a poem to my mind.\nHence B H S etc.\" With this correction the utterance may be\ntaken to mean :\n\" I understood your reference to another life\n[i.e. to '\nmessenger '] in the message which [reference] led me\nto refer to Browning ; as this reference came to me through\nMrs. Piper [i.e. through the mention of '\nSurvival '] the remem-\nbrance of the circle [i.e. of the script of Jan. 28] made me\nunderstand it.\" Later in the sitting Mr. Piddington asked him\nto make it clear why the passage given to Mrs. Verrall and\ndescribed through Mrs. Piper as \" Browning, Hope and Star\nfurnished an excellent answer to the message. Mr. Piddington\nhimself points out that he ought not to have said \" the passage \",\nas the line about the star was not quoted in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript ; at all events MyersP must needs take it to mean the\npoem. \" Poem ?\" he asked, \" I understand she [Mrs. Verrall] got\nit in my answer, but I did not give it here ; is that what you\nsay?\" This is a concise statement of his view of the case: he has\ngiven through Mrs. Verrall quotations from a poem or the title\nof a poem which he has not given through Mrs. Piper. What\nhe now wants is to have the correctness of this conception\nconfirmed. When Mr. Piddin\u00ab?ton asks him to qive \"a detailed\nreference to a particular passage,\" he answers vaguely :\n\" Oh yes\nI understand,\" and the sentence is altered to : \"I want you to\ngive more details through this light.\" This at last is some-\nthing he can understand. It is with evident joy that he\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment. 161\nanswers :\n\" I see now what you wish me to [do] : repeat or\ngive more words perhaps. I understand and will go over it\nand do so. T for the first time clearly understand your special\npoint\n1\n. You have at last made me understand, I am glad to\nsay.\" This is his last meeting with Mr. Piddington, but he\nhas now got a firm basis to stand upon. It seems clear to him\nthat one of the Browning poems referring to another life\ni.e. to hope of Survival\u2014which he, impressed by the thought\nof being an intermediary, has quoted through Mrs. Verrall\na poem about stars, too\u2014has been taken by Mr. Piddington to\nbe a direct answer to the message, and that by showing his\nknowledge of it, by \" repeating or giving more words perhaps,\"\nhe can complete the cross-correspondence message wanted from\nhim.\n2\nAt the first sitting, on March 20, with Mrs. Sidgwick, who\nhad taken the place of Mr. Piddington, MyersP displays great\neagerness to get his view confirmed by the new leader of the\n1\nThis expression dates from the conversation with George Pelham (v. p. 150).\n2\nA curious mistake occurred at the sitting of March 13, Myersp transferring to\nthe Hope-Star-incident a number of details belonging to another case. On Feb.\n12 Mr. Piddington, after telling him that \" Browning, Star and Hope \" had come\nout in Mrs. Verrall's script, added that he had succeeded besides in getting\nthrough a communication which he himself had denied having seen, but which\nMyers? had asserted he had given together with his own name ; it referred\nto a conversation between the late Mr. Myers and Mrs. Sidgwick. A few days\nbefore, on Feb. 5, Myersp had been in a great hurry ; Eector explained that he\nwas going to give a message to Mrs. Verrall. On Feb. 11 Myersp connected this\nhurry with the above-mentioned script where his name was given\u2014as a matter of\nfact this script was produced on Feb. 4, but this mistake is of no account here\nsaying to Mr. Piddington :\n\" Did I not tell you I would go to Mrs. Verrall ? Did\nI not refer to that ?\" On the next day Mr. Piddington excused his own mistake,\nand with great pleasure acknowledged that Myersp had given the communication\nand signed it with his name ; Myersp was very glad at having succeeded. Later,\nhowever, he confused the two things he had been praised for on Feb. 12. When\non March 13 he is trying to recollect the script of Jan. 28 and of the circle he\nsays: \"IhelpedMrs. Verrall to draw it,\" and adds :\n\" and signed my name to it,\"\nand afterwards: \"It [the Latin message] suggested it [the poem] so strongly I\nrushed off to Mrs. Verrall, gave it her, rushed back here and although you did\nnot understand it at the time, you did later, if I remember rightly\"; all three\ncircumstances\u2014the signing of the name, the hurrying from one medium to\nanother, Mr. Piddington's not having understood at first \u2014being transferred from\none successful case to the other. Mr. Piddington's answer: \"Yes that is quite\nright\" confirmed him in his mistake, and on April 8 the hurrying from Mrs. Piper\nto Mrs. Verrall once more was connected with the writing of the poem.\nL\n\f162 Mrs. Anna Hude, Ph.D. [part\nexperiment. He immediately begins :\n\" I told Mrs. Verrall\nabout Browning, hope of [survival of] bodily death. . . . No not\nquite understood. I said I told her of the passage in Browning's\npoems where stars and life meet.\" \" Stars and life \" is at a\nlater sitting repeated as \" this life and the stars\"; accordingly\nlife means life after death ;\n\" hope of bodily death \" is probably\nabandoned on account of the words omitted ; in any case the\nexpression shows how MyersP had combined Hope with his own\nidea of the point of the message. He goes on asking Mrs.\nSidgwick whether she knows which poem he had referred to\n\" You remember Browning's poem I was fond of and to which\nI referred?\" \"You remember the poem I referred to, do you\nnot?\" and as she answered vaguely: \"Yes you referred to\npoems of Browning\": \"But you do understand which one?\"\nIt is evident that he wants to be sure of its being one special\npoem Mr. Piddington is thinking of. Of course he doesn't ask\nher what poem it is. On the contrary, he puts the question\nalmost as if he himself knew the name of it ; his uncertainty\non this point he must prefer to conceal while he is still searching\nhis memory for the answer.\nMrs. Sidgwick's replies to the utterances of MyersP, on March\n20, had been too vague to help him. But for the sitting of\nApril 2 Mr. Piddington had furnished her with two written\nquestions to be answered by him, of which the first gave him\nthe assurance that he wanted. \" Mr. Piddington says,\" Mrs.\nSidgwick read, \" you promised to try to tell us what particular\npoem of Browning's you meant to refer to by the words Brown-\ning, Hope and Star.\" MyersP replied :\n\" Oh yes. I am glad you\nremind me of this so clearly. I will answer this at our next\nmeeting. Meanwhile I will think it over.\" The simple question\nhad confirmed him in his opinion and held no disturbing elements\nlike those which had confused him before ;\nso, leaving aside the\nsecond question which referred to \" the passage \", he on the very\nnext occasion when Mrs. Sidgwick was present alone, on April 8,\nmade his first attempt to answer about \" the poem \".\nHis answer was that it was Browning's poem La Saisiaz\nthe message had made him think of. \" Do you remember the\nLatin message ?\n\" he began ;\n\" I thought I could tell you that\nI specially thought of the poem about the stars which read\nthus,\" afterwards describing it in a manner that sufficiently\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment. 163\nshows what he is thinking of :\n\" one of Browning's poems\nwhich he wrote to a friend,\" \" lonely wandering,\" \" which had\nalso hope.\" This long poem, as will be remembered, has for\nits sole subject the possibility of another life ;\nending with\na vision of Hope, whose arrow pierces the cloud of doubt.\nMyerSp, however, was far from sure of having found the right\npoem ;\n\" I thought I could tell you \" is indicative of his uncer-\ntainty ;\n\" specially \" shows that he had thought of more than\none. And of course Mrs. Sidgwick's surprise must add to his\ndoubts. So at the sitting of April 17, though in no way\ntrying to cover up his mistake\u2014on the contrary spontaneously\nreverting to La Saisiaz, and this time succeeding in giving the\nname\u2014he has evidently ceased to regard it as the poem and\nis once more searching his memory. But it will be seen\nwhat significance this attempt has even through being a failure.\nAlt Vogler MyersP might have got by mind-reading ; La Saisiaz\ncannot be thus explained, while it is easily accounted for on the\nsupposition here adopted.\nProbably MyersP has thought of other possibilities,1\nwhich\nare, however, now rejected, as at this point he has found the\npoem Abt Vogler. At last it has come to his memory, and\non April 24 he succeeds in getting through the difficult German\nname. That he is right now he has not the slightest doubt\nMrs. Sidgwick's thanks tell him so, but he is also him-\nself fully satisfied; for even this poem, which he can now\nbe certain of having quoted through Mrs. Verrall, more than\nanything expresses the idea that for him has been the central\nthought of the message. \" The thing which impressed me\n1\nI cannot help believing that Myersp has thought of the sentence \"A cloudless\nsky beyond the horizon \" as possibly belonging to Mrs. Verrall's script of\nJan. 2S. On March 6 it is connected with the circle ; on April 10\u2014after\nthe attempt with La Saisiaz on April 8\u2014it is mentioned again : on April 15\nMyersp says that \" it was brought to his mind because of Piddington's message,\"\nand on April 17 he explains : \"it came out I believe with a star being drawn\n(r. p. 168) . . . horizon yes which comes from the poem.\" Before April 24,\nhowever, he has seen that this was a mistake : horizon does not belong to\nMrs. Verrall's script with the poem. The sitting of that day begins with\nHodgsonp asking if \"horizon\" did not come out at Mrs. VerralFs later than\nthe lines of Browning's poem ; and when afterwards Myersp happens to say\n\" Hope Star Horizon,\" he immediately corrects himself, saying :\n\" Horizon comes\nelsewhere,\" and asking Mrs. Sidgwick to excuse the confusion. Later he doesn't\nreturn to the Horizon-sentence, having now found Abt Vogler.\n\f164 Mrs. Anna Hude, Ph.D. [part\nmost was the lines beyond the grave,\" he goes on when he\nhas got the name through and expressed his joy ; he would\nhave added something, but, as implied by Rector and confirmed\nat a later sitting, some words are left out here. Afterwards\nhe\u2014as Rector has it\n\u2014\" tries to explain a little about the\npoem,\" speaking of the resemblance between his own experience\nand Abt Vogler's \" doubts and fears, then his acceptance of\nGod and faith in him.\"\n1\nNow he believes himself to have\nperformed his task, and asks :\n\" Now can I do more to help\nyou than give other messages ?\n\" But Mrs. Sidgwick, who has\nnot got the explanation of his choice of the poem expected by\nMr. Piddington, answers :\n\" I should like you to say exactly\nwhy that poem was so appropriate as an answer to the Latin\nmessage.\" MyersP repeats :\n\" Because of the appropriate con-\nditions mentioned in it which applied to my own life ; and\nnothing I could think of so completely answered it to my\nmind as those special words.\" That he is speaking of the\nwords \" beyond the grave \" and the lines left out by Rector\nis made clear in the following sittings. It is Abt Vogler's\nfaith in a future life he has thought of and, above all, the\nlines about the dead who return to earth !\nMrs. Sidgwick got no other reply that time ; but MyersP did\nnot forget that at the end of the sitting she had seemed less\ncontent than when he had first spoken of Abt Vogler. So\nwhen he met with her again, on May 1, he at once began\n\" I am anxious to-day to clear one or two things. Do you\nremember my reference to the poem ? Did you wish to ask\nanything more ? Do you remember when I said I had passed\nthrough my body and returned ? I tried to give it clearly,\nbut was not sure that you understood.\" And as Mrs. Sidgwick\nasks :\n\" Do you mean you gave the name of the poem ?\n\" he\ngoes on :\n\" Oh yes. I mean I tried to give another part also\nwhich referred to completed happiness in this life and the\npossibility of returning to the old world again to prove the\ntruth of survival of bodily death.\" All that the message has\nmeant to him is given in this single sentence. But he feels\nthe absence of sympathy and says entreatingly :\n\" Mrs. Sidgwick,\ndear old friend, do you hear me at all ?\n\" \" Yes,\" she answers,\n\" and I think I shall understand.\" He makes a last effort,\n1\nAbt Voghr, Stanza IX.\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment. 165\nexclaiming :\n\" I believe you will when I tell you I have\nreturned to breathe in the old world which is not however\nbetter than our new.\" 1\nThis time he believes himself to have answered completely ;\nno lack of enthusiasm on the part of the experimenters can\nmake him doubt the sufficiency of this response. So at the\nnext meeting, on May 6, it is not he who reverts to the\nmessage ; on the contrary, he says a propos of another question :\n\" and the Latin I have previously answered through both\nlights sufficiently for you to understand that I have really\nanswered at last.\" When Mrs. Sidgwick replies :\n\" The Latin\nmessage, as you know, refers to cross-correspondences, but also\nto something more, and there is a line in Aht Vogler which\nwe think you had in your mind as describing that something-\nmore,\" he at first doesn't understand. \" Did you say line ?\nhe asks ;\n\" [of the] poem ?\n\" He has ceased to think of it\nnow and is unprepared to return to it. \" I remember the\nmessage as referring to my giving proofs of survival of bodily\ndeath through cross-correspondence messages. ... I could not\nhelp thinking of Browning.\" Only after a time he is able\nto repeat his former reply,\u2014that the point where the poem\nsuggested itself to him was this :\n\" those who passed beyond\ndo return, those beyond mortal vision.\" 2\nThis and no other\nis the central point to him ; the message asked him to prove\nthe survival of bodily death ; he had done so by returning as\na messenger from the life beyond.\nAnd what a faithful and untiring messenger he is ! Before\nthe sitting of the next day he has meditated upon Mrs. Siclg-\nwick's words and comprehended that he cannot yet have done\nall that was wanted of him. And, certainly, there is one\nthing which in his eagerness to explain his choice of Aht\nVogler he has in the later sittings quite lost sight of: the\n1\nAbt Vogler, Stanza v. :\n'\u2022\nThe wonderful Dead who have passed through the\nbody and gone, but were back once more to breathe in an old world worth\ntheir new.\"\n2\nAfterwards Mrs. Sidgwick, who did not recognise the quotation, sug-\ngested that it might apply to another question, \u2014that of the Horace Ode.\nMyersp accepted her suggestion ; but he had not before given the slightest\nhint of so applying it, and his compliance can in no way alter the main\nfact, \u2014that the lines about the return of the dead were quoted\u2014in two sittings,\nmoreover\u2014in answer to the Latin message.\n\f166 Mrs. Anna Hade, Ph.J). [part\nStar. Of course it had been clear to him that the Hope-\nStar-poem must in some way be connected with stars ; at\nthe first sittings with Mrs. Sidgwick he had described it as\nreferring to life after death and stars ; in La Saisiaz he had\nunsuccessfully tried to introduce them (\"poem about the stars,\" 1\n\" which he wrote to a friend about star and hope \"), and as to\nAM Voglcr, he once mentions \" his questioning and the answer\nthrough his seeing a star \" ; it is only a passing remark, but\nthe mistake\u2014which is not at all like MyersP\u2014may be due to\nthe idea of a star as part of the poem. But the star had another\nsignificance for him, which appears for the first time at the\nsitting of April 8 when he tried to give La Saisiaz as the\npoem of Mrs. Verrall's script. He had done his best to explain\nthat he spoke about the poem that was his answer to the\nLatin message. He strove to make clear which script he was\nreferring to. \" I made a circle,\" he said, \" as it suggested it\nto my mind,\" and immediately added :\n\" I then drew or tried\nto draw a star yes through the other light [i.e. Mrs. Verrall]\nand I did so so you would understand that I understood the\nmessage. ... I drew it so you would understand that I did it.\nAlso a crescent.\" He has here spoken of three different figures.\nTo understand this it will be necessary to revert to an incident\nslightly referred to before 2\nwhich had preceded the production\nof Mrs. Verrall's script of Jan. 28.\nOn Jan. 16 Mr. Piddington had spoken to MyersP as follows\n3\n:\n\" Myers, when you send a message to, say, Mrs. Verrall, and\nthen a similar message to Mrs. Holland, could you not mark\neach with some simple but distinctive sign\u2014say, a triangle within\na circle ?\n\"\nMyerSp had replied\n\" I think I understand. You wish me to make a sign when\ngiving a word at Mrs. Verrall's also at Mrs. Holland's, the same\nsign.\"\n1\n1 should think, however, that some of the Stars are due to Rector's\ninability to grasp the name Saisiaz. Once, on April 8, the script has S'tars,\nand Rector answers \"Yes\" when Mrs. Sidgwick asks whether it is Stars, but\nMyersp exclaims: \"I wish you could hear what I am saying,\" which points\nto the answer being wrong. On April 17 the script has Siazies, and afterwards :\n\"To the Stars. Siacriez.\"\n2\nV. p. 159. 3\niVoc, Vol. XXII. , p. 36.\n\fThe Latin Message Experiment. 167\nIt will be seen that MyersP had comprehended that the\ntriangle within a circle was mentioned only by way of exempli-\nfication ; that this was also the case with the mediums he is\nsure to have understood, although not clearly stating it. And\nin the following time he seems to have made several attempts\nto carry out the idea. It is true that the drawing in Mrs.\nVerrall's script of Jan. 28 is used as an illustration to the\nquotation from Abt Vogler, which correctly runs :\n\" On the earth\nthe broken arcs ; in the heaven a perfect round.\" But the\nthought of thus illustrating it may have come to his mind\nthrough Mr. Piddington mentioning the figure ; when on March 6\nhe speaks to him of his attempt to draw a triangle within a\ncircle he adds :\n\" as you suggested \" ; thus he seems to have\nmade a double use of it.\n1\nFrom the beginning, however, MyersP seems to have preferred\nanother sign. Mrs. Verrall herself never drew a star ; but her\nscript of Jan. 28 begins with the words Star Sign ; on Feb. 6\nshe writes \" five pointed star \" ; Miss Verrall's script of Feb. 3\nhas the following words and figures\nthe crescent moon\nremember that and the star\nand that of Feb. 17 :\nthat was the sign she will understand\nwhen she sees it.\nImperfect as they are, in view of his later utterances these seem\nattempts to carry out Mr. Piddington's plan. But he seems to\nhave thought of the crescent as another sign ; thus he makes\nthe mistake of connecting it with the star when on April 8\nhe for the first time mentions this figure, though the crescent\n1\nOn March 13 he mentions the circle as \"a connecting link\"; on April 8\nhe says: \"I made a circle, as it [i.e. the message] suggested it to my mind.\"\n\f168 Mrs. Anna Hude, Ph.D. [part\nhas no place in the script of Jan. 28. The parallel use, how-\never, of the two words confirms the conception that on this\noccasion the star too is mentioned as a sign only.\nReturning, then, to the sitting of April 8, it is clear that\nMyersp had called attention to the star as a sign used by him\nto make it understood that it was he who impressed Mrs.\nVerrall when \" the poem \" was quoted (\" so you would under-\nstand that I did it,\" i.e. wrote it). Evidently he didn't know\nthat on that occasion no star was drawn, but only the word\naster written, and Mrs. Sidgwick's answer :\n\" Yes, there was a\nstar drawn,\" confirmed him in his opinion. Thence onwards he\nunhesitatingly connects the star with the script of \" the poem \",\nwhile the circle is no more mentioned. On April 24, immedi-\nately before his efforts to give the name Abt Vogler, a star is\ndrawn and he exclaims :\n\" I remembered Vol [i.e. Vogler] as it\n[the star] came to my memory.\" But it is as the sign that\nit makes him recollect Abt Vogler. When he quotes from the\npoem, it is no star but the return of the dead that fills his\nthoughts.\nMrs. Sidgwick, however, has not been satisfied with his\nquotations; she has asked for a, line which is not among them.\nThen he remembers the star which of course must not be want-\ning in the Hope-Star-poem. And he succeeds in recalling a\nline about a star. It is not among those which have impressed\nhim ; indeed his remembrance of it is faint. But its significance,\nhe believes, is that of referring to the sign. So he strives to\nreproduce it at the sitting of May 7. A star is drawn, and\nalluding to another line from Abt Vogler, he says :\n\" In my\npassion to reach you as clear as the sky I quote : if instead\nof a fourth\n1\nframed a star\u2014came a star. And,\" he adds, \" to\nmake it clearer I drew a star. This completes my answer to\nthe Latin message, if you have received all my words clearly.\nIn my passion to reach you clearly I have made Bector try\nto draw a star for me so there can be no mistake. When I\nquoted to Mrs. Verrall I drew the star so as to make it clearer\nand I wished Bector to reproduce it in connection with the\nwords in the line.\"\nThus at last MyersP has really \" completed his answer \". But\nthe message is reverted to in his very interesting dialogues with\n1 \" Sound\" gets through in Mrs. Piper's waking-stage and later.\n\fLXV.] The Latin Message Experiment. 169\nSir Oliver Lodge on May 27 and June 2, 1907. In the former\nhe explains that Mr. Piddington had wished him to prove con-\nclusively the survival of bodily death by giving a message\nthrough Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Piper concerning the same\nsubject ; the message had suggested Browning to him, and from\nits last sentence\n1\nhe had got: \"Instead of a fourth sound came\na star.\" At the sitting of June 2 he is more explicit, and\nthough it will be seen that he is unable to reproduce the message\nso as to give a meaning to it, at the same time a clear light\nis thrown upon the development of his own conception of it.\nHe begins by saying that Mr. Piddington had said :\n\" If you\nwill give me a message, not a message really but a sign of\nsome kind through the lights, corresponding message which I\ncannot mistake, I shall consider it the greatest proof of your\nsurvival of bodily death,\" adding :\n\" Hence my reason for draw-\ning a star.\" But he seems to discover that he has here confused\nthe message with Mr. Piddington's request to him about the\nsign (on Jan. 16); so he reverts to the beginning, giving a fairly\ncorrect translation of the first Latin words. \" The message in\nLatin was this,\" he says. \" For a long time you have been\nassimilating ideas one with another through different lights,\n2\nbut\nwhat is most important of all if to prove the survival of bodily\ndeath is for you to give in a certain way a sign.\" He perceives\nthat he is on the wrong track once more and alters the last\nsentence :\n\" But what we want is for you to give us proof in\nsuch a way as to make your proof conclusive.\"\nNo, he cannot make it clear ! So he leaves aside the message\nand describes the experiment from his own point of view :\n\" I\nwish you would follow me now for a moment. Kemember when\nPiddington gave me his message the special point in it was\n1\nOf course Myers? must connect \" the line \" with the last part of the message.\nFrom the sittings of April 17 and May 27 it is seen that he had caught at\nleast some words from the last sentence : nullus\u2014appareat\u2014perficias \u2014illud\nprioribus ;\nprobably he had taken them to mean that he should mcike apparent\nand complete more than in former messages. Complete is a word he often makes\nuse of in connection with the Latin message.\n-Here for the first time Myersp has correctly translated the words diversis\ninternuntiis ; this part of the message\u2014the only one which had really come\nthrough before Mr. Piddington's idea gave a new direction to the experiment\nhe has thus been able to understand completely, though he did not succeed in\ndoing so at once.\n\f170 Mrs. Anna Hade, Ph.D. [part\nfor me to give definite proof through both lights. The first\nthought I had was to repeat a few words or lines of Browning's\npoem, but in order to make it still more definite I registered\na star, and the lines I quoted to you before [on May 27] were\nthe most appropriate I could find.\" Here in a few words\nMyersP gives the outlines of the whole experiment from the\nmoment, on March 13, when he had said that he for the first\ntime clearly understood what Mr. Piddington wished him to do\n\" to repeat or give more words of Browning's poem.\" Ever since\nhe had tried to do this ; with the words from Alt Vogler about\nthe returning dead he had believed that he had solved the\nproblem. Perceiving that more was wanted he had drawn the\nstar and quoted \" the line,\" not knowing what Mr. Piddington\nhad seen in it and not having thought of it before. To the\nlast his recollection of it is imperfect.\nIt is true, then, that MyersP has neither understood nor\nreplied to the Latin message. But had he not performed a\ngreater task ? He had found a meaning where an ingenious\nbut unfounded idea had brought confusion ; he had clung to his\nown thought in spite of all discouragement ; he had in a beautiful\nmanner illustrated his understanding of the message, such as it\nwas. Naturally he must believe that it had a meaning ; the\nincongruities he explained through the difficulties of the trans-\nmission.\n1\nThus it became possible that in his own way, though\nof course guided by the sympathy or want of it with which his\nwords were received, he could obtain a result that satisfied both\nhimself and the experimenters. His identity may be questioned ;\nhis intelligence seems to me indisputable.\n1\nOf course Eector was made responsible ; \"I did have a time of it in making\nhim understand my meaning,\" Myersp says to Sir Oliver Lodge (Proc. , Vol. XXIII.,\np. 249).\n\fLXV.] Note on Mrs. Hudes Paper. 171\nNOTE ON MBS. HUDES PAPEB.\nBy J. G. PIDDINGTON.\nMrs. Hude may be right in her contention that MyersP and\nI were at cross-purposes over the Latin Message experiment.\nIt was, anyhow, unfortunate that I read into Mrs. Verrall's\nscript of Jan. 28, 1907 \u2014no matter whether justifiably or not\n\u2014an answer to the Latin Message ;\nfor, whether I would or no,\nfrom Feb. 19, 1907, onwards, I could not help expecting\nMyerSp to confirm my interpretation of this script.\nBut I am dissatisfied with my conduct of this experiment\nfor other reasons.\n1\nI did my best, of course, to give no hints to the trance-\npersonalities which might help them to guess either the meaning\nof the Latin or the general purport of the experiment. Some\nof my critics say I did give hints, and so enabled the\ntrance-personalities to score a partial success. Other critics take\nthe view that the trance-personalities showed no signs of having\nunderstood the object of the experiment : from which it seems\nto follow, either that I gave no useful hints, or that, if I did,\nthe trance-personalities did not turn them to account.\nI suspect that the truth lies between these two extremes\nand that, while I may have given\u2014though quite accidentally\nand unintentionally\u2014one useful hint (see Proc, Vol. XXII., p.\n336, footnote), more than once, in our efforts to avoid helping\nthe trance-personalities, both Mrs. Sidgwick and I did the\nprecise opposite and misled them.\nThe main error, in my opinion, lay partly in an experiment\nof this kind being conducted by experimenters who knew the\n1\nIn speaking of myself only I am not forgetting Mrs. .Sidgwick's share in the\nconduct of the experiment. But Mrs. Sidgwick hardly had a free hand. She\nwas in the difficult position of having to carry on an experiment, for the initial\nstages of which I, and not she, was responsible. Consequently blame must\nattach to me and not to her for any faults in the experimentation.\n\f172 J. G. Piddington. [part\nanswer required; and partly in their having to conduct it with\ntrance-personalities, who need encouragement if they are to do\ntheir best, who are inclined to \" fish,\" and who can talk hack.\nOne learns by experience, and had I to carry out another\nexperiment of the kind I would not do it with Mrs. Piper,\nbut with Mrs. Holland or Mrs. Verrall, whose \" communicators\n\"\ncan't talk back.\nIn dealing in such a case as this with trance-personalities\nlike Mrs. Piper's, it is difficult for the experimenter to avoid\ncommitting one or both of two blunders : he will be likely either\nto \" give himself away,\" or to mystify unfairly and so discourage\nthe trance-personalities.\nOne result of conducting the Latin Message experiment under\nthe conditions obtaining in Mrs. Piper's trance was the accumu-\nlation of a large mass of material\u2014much of it consisting of\n\" cross-questions and crooked answers.\" Of so voluminous, un-\nwieldy, and labyrinthine a character is the material thus\naccumulated, that we need not be surprised if various inter-\npretations can be placed upon it, all more or less possible.\nThough my own reading of the facts seems to me, on the\nwhole, less unsatisfactory than other interpretations of them that\nhave been ottered, considering the nature of the evidence, I\ndoubt whether the problem is ever likely to receive a con-\nvincing solution. Hence I am inclined to deprecate further\ndiscussion of the case as a whole. If it deserves further\nattention at all, I think that various episodes contained in\nit would otter a more profitable field for study.\nAlthough I have read Mrs. Hude's paper with some degree\nof adhesion, I must protest against one point in it.\nShe makes certain phrases which I have connected with the\nHorace Ode Question form part of the answer given by MyersP\nto the Latin Message. The phrases in question are these\n\" passed out of their bodies and gone,\" \" every peak and\npoint\" (Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 377-378), \"the possibility of\nreturning to the old world again,\" \" peak followed star,\" \" I\nhave returned to breathe in the old world which is not however\nbetter than our new\" (id. ib. y pp. 379-380), \"Those who passed\nbeyond do return,\" \" Passed through body and gone \" (id. ib.,\npp. 385-386).\nI do not think that Mrs. Hude has paid sufficient attention\n\fNote on Mrs. Hudes Paper. 173\nto the fact that on April 24, 1907, the Horace Ode Question\nwas put to Myersp for the third time, and on April 30,\n1907, for the fourth time, and to the fact that before it was\nput the fourth time MyersP had spontaneously announced his\nintention of answering it on May 1, 1907. I cannot go over\nall the ground in detail again ; but if the reader will study\ncarefully the relevant extracts from the Piper sittings of\nApril 24 and 30, and May 1, 6 and 7, 1907, given in Proc,\nVol. XXII., pp. 376-393, and what I have to say about\nthem on pp. 402-404 of the same volume, and in my third\npaper on the Horace Ode Question (see above, pp. 201 and 233-\n235), I believe he will not accept Mrs. Hude's interpretation,\nand will agree with me that MyersP meant to connect these\nphrases, not with the Latin Message, but with the Horace Ode\nQuestion ; and did so, not as Mrs. Hude says, in consequence\nof a hint given by Mrs. Sidgwick, but on his own initiative.\nIf Myersp did not connect these phrases with the Horace\nOde Question, or dissociate them from the Latin Message, as\nclearly and explicitly as could be wished, I believe that was due\nto the fact that Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Johnson, as was only\nnatural in the circumstances, were under the misapprehension\nall the time that these phrases, being reminiscent of Alt Vogler,\nmust be meant to apply to the Latin Message. Their misappre-\nhension tended to unsettle and perplex MyersP somewhat ; but\nI claim that on the whole he came successfully through the\nordeal, and indicated with sufficient clearness that he meant\nthese particular phrases to form part of his answer to the\nHorace Ode Question.\n\f174 J.

For returning to the subject once again I offer three\nexcuses. First, this case, in my opinion, in spite of its com-\nplexities and in spite of the conjectural character of some\nparts of my interpretation of it, constitutes some of the best\nevidence we possess, not merely of the supernormal but also\nof the identity of a professing communicating spirit. Secondly,\nI know of no published case more difficult to explain on any\nhypothesis that postulates the action of living persons only\nto the exclusion of the dead.

C. i. 28] have entered as\ndeeply as almost any Horatian passage into my own inner history. 2\nThe discovery of this letter led Mrs. Verrall to ask me to\nput the following question to MyersP :\n\" Which Ode of Horace\nentered deeply into your inner life?\"; and this question I\nput on January 23, 1907.\nNo answer was given or attempted so long as I was in\ncharge of the Piper sittings. But on April 17, 1907, Mrs.\nSidgwick, who had taken my place, repeated the question,\n3\nand MyersP at once replied :\n\" Oh ! yes, ...

That as a matter of fact her normal\nmemory was thus stimulated is not, however, a point of much importance\nfor we should in any case have been bound to assume that the reading of the\nletter provoked a subconscious recollection of the content of these scripts.\n2\nIt should be observed, by the way, that Myers spoke, not of any purely\nliterary or pedantic interest in the \"Archytas\" Ode, but of its emotional or\nmoral influence on him.\na\nMrs. Sidgwick repeated the question at my suggestion.

Do you remember Immortality ? \", as mean-\ning that a poem of Frederic Myers's, entitled Ode to Nature,4\"\ncontained echoes of Hor. C. iii. 4,\n5\nand that another poem of\nhis, entitled Immortality? contained echoes of Hor. C. i. 28,\nthe \" Archytas \" Ode. While I thought the connexion between\nOde to Nature and Hor. C. iii. 4- was merely incidental, I\nargued that between Immortality and the \" Archytas \" Ode\n1\nSee for a summary of the facts, Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 402-403.\n\"\nIn view of what follows (see pp. 204-206 below), it should be noted that in\neach of these quotations from Abt Vor\/ler is involved the idea of the dead\nbeing in touch with the living, and of both mutually influencing each other.\n3\nThis supposition of Mrs. VerralFs was clearly wrong, for Myers says in the\nletter that it was \"the first 6 lines\" of the Ode that had entered deeply into\nhis inner history, and the allusion to Pythagoras does not come in these lines.\n4\nThese two poems appear in Fragments of Prose and Poetry, pp. 127 and 172\nrespectively.\n5\nSee Proc., Vol. XXII., pp. 401-402.\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 177\nthere were not only incidental coincidences of expression, but\nalso and chiefly a connexion of thought as well. Myers, I\nsuggested, in Immortality was re-echoing, and, as the '\nverbal\ncoincidences indicated, consciously re-echoing, the gloomy pre-\nsentiments about man's destiny to which Horace gives utter-\nance in the \" Archytas \" Ode.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Mr. Dorr\nwas having sittings with Mrs. Piper, and putting to MyersP a\nnumber of questions on literary and classical subjects. In the\ncourse of answering them MyersP, between February 25 and\nMay 26, 1908, in a very ingenious manner 1\nclearly identified\nthe Ode which had formed the subject of the Horace Ode\nQuestion. This he did off his own bat, quite independently\nof any hint or help from Mr. Dorr, who did not know that\nany question about an Ode of Horace had ever been put to\nMyerSp. Moreover, MyersP, it would seem, connected the\n\" Archytas \" Ode with those lines in the Eleventh Book of\nthe Odyssey where Achilles says to Odysseus when they meet\nin the Under-world :\n\" Nay, speak not comfortably to me of\ndeath. . . . Eather would I live e7rdpovpo<;\u2014attached to the\nsoil (or, \" above ground \") as the hireling of another, than\nbear sway among all the dead that be departed \"\n2\nwords\nobviously in harmony with the sentiments of the \" Archytas\nOde and Immortality, and out of harmony with those expressed\nin Alt Vogler.\n\"We pass on now\u2014nearly a year\u2014to February, 1909, at\nwhich time I was working at the records of the Dorr-Piper\nsittings of 1908. The references which they contained to the\nHorace Ode I discussed in a paper entitled \" A Prelude and\na Sequel to the Horace Ode Question.\" What I called the\n\" Prelude \" was some very early scripts of Mrs. Verrall's written\nin 1901, a few weeks after Myers's death. Conjoined in them\nwere quotations from the \" Archytas \" Ode and allusions to\nthe words of Achilles which I have just quoted : the allusions\nbeing effected by means of the phrase adscriptus glebae, \" bound\nto the soil,\" which is one rendering of e-irdpovpo^.\nThese early scripts of Mrs. Verrall's thus seemed to fall\ninto line not only with the Horace Ode references in Mr.\nx\nFor details see Proc, Vol. XXIV., pp. 157-158.\n2\nSee Proc, Vol. XXIV., pp. 155-156, 159-160.\nM\n\f178 J.

[part\nDorr's Piper sittings of 1908, but also with the answers to\nthe Horace Ode Question given by MyersP in 1907,\u2014at\nleast with those answers as I interpreted them in February\n1908, without reference to the contemporaneous Dorr sittings\nor to Mrs. Verrall's early scripts of 1901.\nBut besides the quotations from the \" Archytas \" Ode and\nthe allusions to Achilles' words, there were, I suggested, in\nthese early scripts of Mrs. Verrall's, allusions to Myers's Im-\nmortality and to another poem of his, called On a Spring\nMorning at Sea: a poem which was not published till 1904,\nand which Mrs. Verrall, to the best of her belief, never saw\nuntil it was published in Fragments of Prose and Poetry (p. 54).\nIn this latter poem Myers has prefigured the life to come\nin terms of the rosiest optimism, painting a picture of it as\nmuch opposed as can be to the melancholy that pervades the\nforebodings of Horace in the \" Archytas \" Ode, of Homer in\nthe Eleventh Book of the Odyssey, and of Myers himself in\nImmortality.\nBy conjoining in these early Verrall scripts allusions to\nAchilles' words from the Eleventh Book of the Odyssey, to the\n\" Archytas \" Ode, and to the poems Immortality and On a\nSpring Morning at Sea, Myersv meant, I suggested, to compare\nand contrast the various views about the next life represented\nin these various poems.\nThis completes the epitome of the old evidence. Before,\nhowever, I begin to discuss the new evidence, it will be con-\nvenient to show what the verbal coincidences are between\nOn a Spring Morning cd Sea and Mrs. Verrall's four early\nscripts of 1901.\nCoincidences between \" On a Spring Morning at Sea\n\"\nand Four Early Scripts of Mrs. Verrall's.\nIn estimating what the coincidences are worth the reader\nmust bear in mind that the four scripts all belong to the\nvery earliest stages of Mrs. Verrall's development as an auto-\nmatic writer, are spasmodic in style, and are most markedly\ninferior both in coherence and grammatical construction to her\nlater scripts ; and that consequently the coincidences may\nappear more indeterminate than they otherwise would.\n\fLXV.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 179\nThe first of the four scripts has the following string of\nwords : Postridie [on the morrow] morgenstern [morning star]\nopus [work] rosea [rosy] angelica [angelic].\nThe fourth script has omnia ibi plana, omnia rosea suffusa\nluce vel caecis bene [e]videntia oculi autem tui caligine circum-\nfusi ; which means, \" There all is clear, all bathed in rosy light,\nplain even for the blind to see\u2014but thine eyes are shrouded\nin darkness.\"\nIf in place of opns (meaning \" work \") opedus (meaning\n\" opal \") is read, we get five coincidences with leading words\nin the first five lines of the poem On a Spring Morning at Sea.\nThus :\n\"And such a sight as this is, I suppose,\nShall meet thee on the morrow of thy death\nAnd pearl to sapphire, opal into rose,\nMelt in that mom no heart imagineth\nFair as when now thine eyes thou dar'st not close\n\"\nThe foregoing were all the coincidences between the four scripts\nand the poem which I cited in my second paper on the Horace\nOde Question (Proc., Vol. XXIV., pp. 166-167). I had, how-\never, discovered more coincidences than these, but refrained\nfrom publishing them in deference to the advice of Mrs. Sidgwick\nand Mrs. Verrall, who thought them too fanciful to gain\ncredence, if not to be true. But the discovery of similar,\nthough not identical, verbal coincidences between the poem and\na script of Mrs. Verrali's written long before the coincidences\nbetween the poem and the four early scripts of 1901 were\nnoticed (see pp. 185-186), emboldens me to publish here the\ncancelled sentences from my second paper. They ran thus\nNor were these [i.e. the coincidences described above and on\npp. 167-168 of Proc, Vol. XXIV.] the only attempt in these four\nscripts to give leading words from the poem. Not without misgiving\n\u2014for I am only too well aware how preposterous such an inter-\npretation will seem to all but those who have made a close study\nof the peculiar mental processes exhibited in automatic writings \u2014\nventure to put forward the following suggestion : That the two\nHoratian quotations in the script of March 12, 1901 [quoted in full\nin Proc., Vol. XXIV., p. 163], Splendidior vitro o fans and eras ingens\niterabimus aequor are the form into which the automatist rendered\n\f180 G. Piddington. [part\nthree leading words from the poem, namely, \"spring\" and \"glassy-\nsea.\" The scribe, whose thoughts were at the same time occupied\nwith an Ode of Horace's, was, I conceive, trying to impress on the\nautomatist's mind the words \"spring\" (the season) and \"glassy sea.\"\nThe message was misinterpreted and entangled by the automatist,\nand emerged in the form of two Horatian quotations embodying the\nwords fons (spring of water), vitro (glass) and aequor (sea).\nThus far the deleted passage. To it I now add the following\npoints :\n(1) The conjunction of splendidior vitro o fons and eras ingens\niterabimus aequor may have been suggested, or at any\nrate aided, by the assonance between eras donaberis (part\nof the third line of the Ode which begins 0 fons\nBandusiac, splendidior vitro) and eras . . . iterabimus ;\n(2) Cras ingens iterabimus aequor may have suggested itself\nas an appropriate quotation, because it introduces not\nonly the word aequor (\" sea \") but also the word cras\n(\" to-morrow \" or \" on the morrow \") : both leading words\nin the poem\n(3) An instance of \" spring \" being used equivocally, as I\nsuggest fons (a spring of water) was here, occurs in\nMiss Verrall's script of Nov. 19, 1908, where the\ndrawing of a mechanical spring is followed by the\nwords \" a spring\u2014spring the season also both will\nserve.\"\nThe Horatian quotations, then, in the script of March 12,\n1901, represent, I suggest, an attempt at three words in the\nfollowing couplet of the poem\n\" Ay ! there some jewelled visionary spring\nShall charm the strange shore and the glassy sea.\"\nSo much for the verbal coincidences. But there is besides,\nI suspect, a coincidence in subject between On a Spring Morning\nat Sea and the four early scripts of 1901. In her report on\nher own script from the time of its inception to the end of\n1904 (Proc., Vol. XX., pp. 1-432) Mrs. Verrall writes:\nThere occur from time to time in the script descriptions . . . which\nseem to relate to a visionary dwelling place, a kind of Elysian Fields\nor Isles of the Blest. . . . Though the first unmistakeable description\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 181\nof an \"Isle of the Blest\" did not appear till nearly two years after\nthe inception of the script, there are among the quite early writings\nfragments which suggest that some such idea had been seeking\nexpression earlier in the subliminal consciousness (id. ib., p. 112).\nAs illustrations of these early fragments she then proceeds\nto quote and discuss her scripts of March 11, March 29, and\nApril 27, 1901. Of this last she says:\nOn April 27, 1901, some one, probably myself, is reproached with\nhaving a mind too much fixed on this earth, and urged in language\nreminiscent of Horace's Ode to Archytas, and of Lucretius' address\nto Epicurus, to let the soul soar to the regions of the sky, \"where\nall is clear, all bathed in rosy light\" . . . (id. ib., p. 113).\nSince Mrs. Verrall included the script of April 27, 1901, in\nher list of scripts descriptive of some Abode of the Blest,1\nwe\nare, I think, justified in including what for convenience' sake\nI have called \"the four early scripts of 1901\" in the same\ncategory, for the script of April 27, 1901, is one of these four,\nand (for reasons explained on p. 167 of Proc., Vol. XXIV.) the\nother three unquestionably form part of a suite with it. Hence,\nsince On a Spring Morning at Sea describes a vision of the\nAbode of the Blest, there is a coincidence of subject between\nit and the four scripts, as well as coincidence in phraseology.\nThe reader should, however, keep his judgement about these\ncoincidences in suspense for the present. Further on (see\npp. 185-186) I shall show that six years later two other\nscripts of Mrs. Verrall's, connected like those of 1901 with the\n\" Archytas \" Ode, likewise contain coincidences with On a Spring\nMorning at Sea. The fact that coincidences with the poem thus\nexist in two different sets of scripts, both connected with the\n\" Archytas \" Ode, increases the probability that the coincidences\nin both sets with On a Spring Morning at Sea are not accidental.\nI am sorry, both for my own sake and the reader's, that I\nhave had to spend so much time over the question of these\nparticular coincidences ; but from a theoretical point of view so\nmuch depends on the character of them (i.e. whether they are\nfortuitous or purposive) that detailed discussion could hardly\nbe avoided.\nJ\nSee also Proc, Vol. XX., pp. 377-379 and 340-345.\n\fJ.

G. Piddington. [part\nI believe that the misquotation in 178 of Wordsworth's line,\n\" The light that never was on sea or land,\" was purposive, the\nsubstituted words \" sea or shore \" serving to introduce two words\nfrom On a Spring Morning at Sea. If it was not purposive, it\nis not easy to account for, since the line in its proper form is\nvery well known, and had only a few weeks earlier (Feb. 20,\n1907) been correctly given in a script of Mrs. Verrall's (140),\nexcept for the transposition of \" land \" and \" sea.\"\n1\nThe Connexion between 136, 171 and 178.\nNext let us turn to 136 and 171.\n136 speaks of \" Merlin's prophetic vision,\" \" the passing of\nArthur,\" and \" the island valley of Avilion where . . . falls no\nrain nor snow.\"\nAt the time when this script was written Mrs. Verrall did\nnot understand the meaning of \" Merlin's prophetic vision,\" but\nfive weeks later\u2014on March 15, 1907\u2014she interpreted it as an\nallusion to Tennyson's Merlin and the Gleam, which she read for\nthe first time on that day.\n171 has \" a universal country, the mother of us all, Not '\n0\nfair city of Cecrops,' but Oh fair city of God . . . Golden City\nof God. The universal City is all colours and no colour, but\nbest described clS <& golden GLEAM.\"\nIn her contemporaneous, or nearly contemporaneous, notes on\n171 Mrs. Verrall gives a reference back to Merlin and the Gleam\nmentioned in her note on 136. So \" Gleam\" serves as a con-\nnecting link between 136 and 171. But \" gleam\" occurs thrice\nexplicitly in 178, and once implicitly, because the context of \" the\nlight that never was, on sea or land \" is\nAh ! THEN, if mine had been the Painter's hand,\nTo express what then I saw ; and add the gleam,\nThe light that never was, on sea or land.\nSo the word \"gleam\" links together not only 136 and 171, but\n178 also.\nBefore I point out further links between the five scripts, let\nme go back again for a moment to the context of \" the light that\nnever was, on sea or land.\" In the poem from which these\n1\nThis script is quoted and discussed in Note B, pp. 212-213.\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 187\nwords come Elegiac Stanzas suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle\nin a Storm\u2014occur the following lines\nFour summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee\nI saw thee every day ; and all the while\nThy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.\nThe fact that these lines are part of the context of a quotation\noccurring in 178 tends to confirm my theory that 178 presents\ncoincidences with On a Spring Morning at Sea, since both poems\ncontain the words \" glassy sea.\"\nThe Connexion between 171, 176 and 178.\nI was explaining, before this digression, how 136, 171 and 178\nare linked together by the word \" Gleam.\" I now proceed to\npoint out that 171, 176 and 178 are also connected together : the\nlink in this case being made by means of allusions in all three\nto the description of the Heavenly Jerusalem in the 21st chapter\nof The Revelation of St. John the Divine. 176 seems, as I have\nalready mentioned, to allude to the Heavenly City's having no\nneed of the sun, and 178 to its gates of pearl ; while the phrase\nin 171 \"Golden City of God \" recalls vv. 13 and 21: \"the city\nwas pure gold, like unto clear glass,\" \" and the street of the city\nwas pure gold, as it were transparent glass.\"\nIn support of my theory that these coincidences with the\nApocalypse are not due to chance, I would point out : first,\nthat the imagery of the 21st chapter of Revelation, like that\nof On a Spring Morning at Sect (with which poem 178 presents\ncoincidences of word and phrase) is drawn from jewels and\ncolours ;\nand, secondly, that the \" sea of glass \" that was before\nthe throne of God (Rev. iv. 6) recalls both the \" glassy sea\nof On a Spring Morning at Sea\nAy, there some jewelled visionary spring\nShall charm the strange shore and the glassy sea\nand the \" glassy sea \" of Wordsworth's Stanzas suggested by\na Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm\nand all the while\nThy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.\n\f188 J. G. Pidclington. [part\nAnd this coincidence with the Wordsworth poem is not a\nmerely verbal one. There is a real connexion of thought as\nwell, for the sight of Peele Castle reflected in the glassy summer\nsea brings to the poet's mind the thought of Heavenly or\nElysian calm\nThou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine\nOf peaceful years ; a chronicle of heaven ;\nand\nA Picture had it been of lasting ease,\nElysian quiet, without toil or strife ;\nNo motion but the moving tide.\n136, 176 AND 178.\nNow let us turn for a moment to 136, 176 and 178. 176\nand 178, I have suggested, allude to On a Spring Morning at\nSea, the poem in which Myers has painted a vision of the next\nworld, and also to the 21st chapter of Revelation wherein is\ndescribed the Heavenly Jerusalem. 136 mentions the Island\nof Avilion, which was \" in Welsh mythology the kingdom of\nthe dead,\" and at a later date became \" an earthly paradise\nin the western seas \" (Unci. Brit. s.v. Avalon). Visions of\nanother world form, then, a common subject of these three\nscripts. I have mentioned three of these visions, but I believe\nthat indirect allusion to a fourth is involved in the quotation\nfrom Tennyson's Morte d'Arthur, which follows the mention of\nthe Island of Avilion in 136.

G. Piddington. [part\nIt seems to me not unlikely that wheu writing the last\nstanza of his poem Venice Myers, who was a great admirer\nof George Sand's works and had written an essay on her,\nin which the Lettres d'un Voyageur are highly, if briefly,\npraised {Essays Modern, p. 87), had this passage in his mind.1\nThat the intelligence responsible for 140, 171, 176 and 178\nknew the George Sand passage I can hardly doubt,'2\nThe reader will not be in a position to appreciate the full\nforce of these parallelisms, and especially of the fourth, until\nhe reaches the end of this paper. When, arrived at that\npoint, he realises how close a parallel my interpretation of\nMrs. Verrall's scripts presents with the passage in the Lettres\nd'un Voyageur about Venice and the vision of the New\nJerusalem, let him remember what I have said above and\nnow repeat and emphasise : namely, that my interpretation of\nthe new evidence presented in this paper was completed in\nits present form before I knew of the existence of the George\nSand passage, and before I knew that she, or for that matter\nany writer, had ever traced any sort of relationship between\nthe vision of the New Jerusalem and Venice.3\n1\nHe probably knew it in the original ; but it is not unlikely that he came\nacross it in Hare's Venice during his stay at Venice in 1900. He was, I\nknow, fond of Hare's Borne, and had it in Rome with him on one of his last\nvisits there. I do not know that he had Hare's Venice with him at Venice\nin 1900, but in view of his fondness for Hare's Rome, it seems a likely\nconjecture that he had.\n2\nAs the allusion to the Lettres d'un Voyayeur in Essays Modern shows,\nFrederic Myers may well have known the passage. Had Mrs. Verrall ever\nread it? On June 3, 1912, she wrote, in answer to my enquiries: \"I am\nsure I have never read Hare's Venice. ... I have never been or planned\nto go to Venice, and I have no knowledge of any books about Venice, except\nRuskin's Stones of Venice, and an old Baedeker.\" Then, on June 6, 1912,\nhaving looked up the passage first in Hare's Venice and then in the original,\nand after looking through Lettres d'un Voyageur generally, she wrote :\n\" Nothing in it was in the least familiar, and no faintest recollection\nsuggested that I had any previous acquaintance with it.\"\n3\nSince writing the above I see that, according to Ruskin (St. Mark's Rest,\nch. I. and II.), the Venetians, as a result of their conquest of Tyre and of\ntheir acquisition under treaty from Baldwin II. of a street in the city of\nSion, came to associate their own city with the civitas Dei of the 86th Psalm.\nI have also come across a passage in Modern Painters (quoted in Hare's\nVenice, p. 9) which suggests that in Ruskin's mind the New Jerusalem of\nRevelation and Venice were associated :\n\" A city of marble, did I say ? nay, rather a golden city, paved with\nemerald.

But as permission to do so has been refused,\nmy readers must either refer to the book for the original\npoem, or content themselves with the following paraphase of it\nin prose :\nWith good reason one of the Venetian painters placed the guardian\nMargaret between Doge and Doge ; and represented the Madonna\nand Child as smiling from \" a soft and whirling glory \" upon Venice,\nand the Doges as kneeling before them and hearing the words\nPax tibi, Marce Evangelista mens, and as so deeply enraptured that\ntheir earthly city and its buildings fade from their sight, eclipsed\nby the glory of the Heavenly Visitants, who throng to welcome\nthem.\nThe saints truly were with these faithful Doges.

[part\nTill for the grave enraptured kneeling man,\nThro' that clear vision fades, remotely fair,\nThe imperial City of all his earthly care,\nWhose few last arches glimmer,\nWhen Mrs. Verrall pointed out to me the verbal coincidences\nwith the poem Venice in 176 and 178, it occurred to me that\nthe words, \" There is a building and a tower on the left,\"\n1\nand the two drawings in 176 might be meant to represent the\ndistant view of \" the imperial City \" in the background of\nthe picture or pictures described in the poem. Though I had\nnot the faintest notion at that time as to what picture is the\nsubject of the poem Venice, I communicated this conjecture to\nMrs. Verrall, and, with a view to testing whether there was\nanything in it, asked her if she knew what picture it was\nthat had inspired the poem.\nMrs. Verrall in reply told me that in the autumn of 1908\nshe had taken a good deal of trouble (for reasons which have\nnothing to do with the subject of this paper) to identify the\npicture described in Venice. As a result of her own enquiries\nand of investigations made at Venice by a friend on her\nbehalf, she had come to the conclusion\u2014which she had duly\nrecorded at the time of forming it\u2014that the poem was \" based,\nnot on a special picture, but on the general type of pictures\nin the Ducal Palace.\"\nWith this conclusion I find myself, after a long investigation,\nin complete agreement.\nTwo considerations especially have convinced me that Myers\nin the poem Venice is referring not to one particular picture,\nbut to a general type. The first of these considerations is\nthe actual words of the poem :\nTill for the grave enraptured man,\nGrimani, or Priuli, or Loredan.\nIf the poem were referring to a single picture, these words\ncould only mean that the poet had forgotten exactly what\n1\nGrammatically these words may mean either that both building and tower\nare on the left of something unnamed, or that there is a tower on the left\nof the building. The second meaning is much the likelier of the two, because\nthe drawing places the tower on the left of the building.\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 197\nDoge it was that figured in the picture, and that he hadn't\ntroubled to identify him. Now, no poet could surely be quite\nso easy-going and casual as that ! The meaning must be that\nthe poet has in mind a whole class of pictures in which\none Doge or another is represented in a kneeling attitude\nbefore the Virgin or the Holy Child. This type of picture is\n\" frequently to be met with,\" says Bio, 1 \" in private collections,\nin the churches, and above all in the Ducal Palace, in which\nthese allegorical compositions, intended to express the close\nalliance between Eeligion and the State, seem to have been\npurposely multiplied.\"\nThe second consideration is that in spite of enquiries made\non the spot by Mrs. Verrall's friend and others, and of searches\nthrough works of reference, guide-books and picture-catalogues\nby Mrs. Verrall, Miss Johnson and myself, we have failed to\ntrace any one picture at Venice which comprises all the details\nmentioned in the poem.\nOn the assumption, then, that the details given in the poem\nare not to be found in any one single picture at Venice, but\nmay be found scattered over various pictures belonging to the\nspecial type just mentioned, I propose, first, to state what the\ndetails are, and then to look for them in examples of the type\nin question.\nThe details are these : the Madonna and Holy Child with\nSaints and Angels in a \" whirling glory \" ; St. Mark and the\nmotto of Venice, Pax tibi, Marce, Evangelista mens (rendered\nin the poem, \"My peace be with thee, Mark Evangelist\"); a\nDoge or Doges (e.g. a Grimani, Priuli or Loredano) kneeling\nbefore the Madonna and Holy Child ; a distant view of Venice ;\nand \"the guardian Margaret\" \"set 'twixt Doge and Doge.\"\nIn Tintoretto's \" Doge Loredano praying to the Virgin\n(Plate 1), we find the Madonna, \" the thronging welcome of\nthe Blest \" and the \" whirling glory \" ; the Doge Loredano\nkneeling before the Madonna ; St. Mark and the motto of\nVenice ;\nin the background, a view of Venice ;\narches, and, as\n176 says, \" a building and a tower on the left.\" But there is\nno Holy Child, and no St. Margaret \" set 'twixt Doge and\nDoge.\"\nIn the picture by Palma Giovine (Plate 2), we find the\n1 Quoted in Hare's Venice, p. 43.\n\f198 J.

Why, in the first place, is she called \" the guardian \" ?\nVenice has, or has had, several guardian or patron saints e.g.\nSt. Theodore, St. Justina, St. Catherine, St. Mark\u2014but St.\nMargaret is not one of them. Then, what does \" set 'twixt\nDoge and Doge \" mean ? Does it mean a picture wherein St.\nMargaret is represented with a Doge on either side of her ?\nIf so, I can only say that enquiries made at Venice, and\ncareful search through catalogues, have so far failed to reveal\nany such picture at Veuice ;\nor, indeed, any picture showing\nSt. Margaret with any Doge. Or, does it mean that there is\na picture of St. Margaret with pictures containing portraits of\nDoges on either side of it ? If so, the only picture of St.\nMargaret that I have been able to trace in the Ducal Palace\nis one by Tintoretto showing her in company with St. Louis\nand St. George ;\nand, if the guide-books can be trusted, this\npicture is not flanked on either side by portraits of Doges.\nI do not, of course, assert that \" there's no sich a \" picture\nthough I am bound to say that, if there be, it is of a retiring\ndisposition, and that as great mystery seems to surround it as\nsurrounded the \" lady of the name of Harris.\"\nShould there prove to be no picture at Venice of St. Margaret\n\" 'twixt Doge and Doge,\" then the only suggestion I can offer\nis that Myers mistook Tintoretto's St. Catherine for St. Margaret.\nHe might have been misled by the pearls which, among other\njewels, St. Catherine is wearing, for in sacred pictures St.\nMargaret is sometimes represented with pearls (margaritae) in\nJ\nSee p. 185.\n\f200 J.

So far I feel\non firm ground. But I do not feel equally sure that a con-\nnexion exists between the drawings in 176 and the buildings which\nform the backgrounds of some of the pictures we have been\ndiscussing. I do, indeed, suggest that there may be a connexion\nbut I lay more stress on the verbal coincidences between 176,\n178 and 180 on the one hand and Venice on the other, and on\nthe five considerations adduced in their support in the last\nsection but one, and still more on the sixth consideration\ndiscussed in the last section.

The intention was\nclearly to quote the following lines from Abt Voyler\nNot a peak nor point but found and fixed its wandering star,\nand\nthe wonderful Dead who have passed through the body and\ngone,\nBut were back once more in an old world worth their new.\nOn neither occasion were the quotations definitely connected\nwith any particular subject. It should, however, be noted that\nthe first time they occurred was during a sitting at which\nMyerSp had announced his intention of answering the Horace\nOde Question on May 1, 1907 ; and the second time was\nduring a sitting held on that particular day. Anyhow, on\nMay 6, 1907, MyersP definitely and without any beating about\nthe bush did connect the Abt Vogler lines with the Horace\nOde.\nMeanwhile on May 4, 1907, Mrs. Verrall happened to meet\nMrs. Sidgwick when she (Mrs. Sidgwick) was engaged upon\nwriting out the record of Mrs. Piper's trance of May 1. Mrs.\nSidgwick read out to her parts of the record, and among others\nthe part where MyersP gave the words \" passed through my body\nand returned.\" It struck Mrs. A\nr\nerrall at once that these words\n(which, by the way, neither she nor Mrs. Sidgwick at that time\nrecognised as being reminiscent of Abt Vogler) might have been\n\f202 J. G. Piddington. [part\nintended as an allusion to the case of reincarnation mentioned\nin the \" Archytas \" Ode. 1\nWe now come to May 7, 1907, the date of Mrs. Verrall's\nscript, No. 176.\nOn the morning of May 7, 1907, Mrs. Verrall, before\nbeginning to try for script, deliberately read and fixed her\nattention on the \" Archytas \" Ode. Her idea\u2014recorded con-\ntemporaneously\u2014was that if MyersP had meant \" passed through\nmy body and returned \" to refer to the reincarnation of Pytha-\ngoras mentioned in the \" Archytas \" Ode, he might make his\nintention plain and unmistakable by giving through Mrs. Piper\nsome distinctive word such as \" Pythagoras \" or \" Panthoides \"\n;\nand that this might be facilitated by her fixing her mind on\nthe Ode. The reasons which thus led her to fix her attention\non the \" Archytas \" Ode before writing automatically, she re-\ncorded in two notes: the first written at 10.55 a.m., five\nminutes before the script began, the second at 11.30 a.m.,\njust after the script was finished. 2\nNow, although it is perfectly true that the object of Mrs.\nVerrall's experiment was not to bring about an explanatory\nreference in her own, but in Mrs. Piper's script, yet the fact\nremains that her script of May 7, 1907, was written just\nafter her mind was purposely concentrated on the \" Archytas\n1\nMrs. Verrall made the following note in her diary on May 4, 1907: \"From\nwhat Mrs. S[idgwick] told me this morning of the sitting of May 1, 1 think\nthere may be something about the Ode of Horace (i. 28) for which I asked.\nThere was a sentence suggesting re-incarnation, but no connexion with Horace,\nthough Horace was referred to in the course of the sitting.\"\nWhy, it may be asked, had it not occurred to Mrs. Verrall on April 29, when\nshe heard the words \" passed out of their bodies and gone \" uttered in the\nwaking-stage, to connect them with the \"Archytas\" Ode? Possibly it was\nbecause \"passed out of their bodies and gone\" does not, as does \"passed\nthrough my body and returned,\" suggest reincarnation ; but much more\nprobably it was because on April 29 the Horace Ode Question had passed so\ncompletely out of her mind that even when Myersp made an explicit reference\nto it she did not understand what he was talking about (see p. 234).\n2 It may occur to students of this case to ask why in my two previous\npapers I never made any reference to this experiment of Mrs. Verrall's. The\nreason is that I never realised until January 1912, that she ever had made\nany such experiment. I never saw the original sheet of paper on which the\nscript of May 7, 1907, and the two accompanying notes were written, but\nonly a typed copy, in which Mrs. Verrall's two contemporaneous notes were\ncompressed into the following inadequate summary: \"Before writing above script,\nI had fixed my attention on Hor. Od. i. 28.\" This brief note escaped my\nobservation until January 1912.\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 203\nOde, and that after the script was finished her thoughts at\nonce reverted to it. Of the hundreds of scripts which she\nhas written, before and after this date, she has never written\na single other one under similar conditions : that is to say,\nwith the \" Archytas \" Ode or the Horace Ode Question specially\nand definitely in her mind. Hence it cannot be said that I\nhave picked a script at random out of hundreds of others,\nor picked one simply because it happened to suit my book.\nI think, on the contrary, that I can fairly claim that I have\nfixed upon the only script of Mrs. Verrall's, which, apart\nfrom internal evidence, there is any reason for connecting\nwith the \" Archytas\" Ode.\nFrom Mrs. Verrall's point of view her experiment of May\n7, 1907, failed. But the remainder of this paper will be\nlargely taken up with an attempt to show that nevertheless\nit did have a successful result, though the result was quite\ndifferent from the one she aimed at, and was achieved in a\nmanner the very reverse of what she expected. Mrs. Verrall\nwas looking for an answer in Mrs. Piper's script : the answer\ncame in her own. She thought the answer would consist of\nan allusion to reincarnation, and the event belied her. She\nhoped that the result of her experiment would be to confirm\nher own interpretation of the second answer given by MyersP ;\nwhereas, as we shall see, it did not do so, but instead fell\ninto line with, and so confirmed, the first answer of MyersP\n(which had nothing to do with reincarnation), although Mrs.\nVerrall did not know what this first answer was, nor indeed\nthat a first answer had been given at all.\n1\nSix days after making the experiment in connexion with\n176 described above, Mrs. Verrall wrote 178 ; and then six weeks\nlater 180.\n2\nThese three scripts, as I have already explained,\n1\nFrom the theoretic and evidential point of view, too much stress cannot be\nlaid on the fact that Mrs. Verrall wrote 176 and its sequels 178 and 180 in\nentire ignorance of the first answer of Myersp (\"I had Ode to Nature on my\nmind . . . Do you remember Immortality?\"'); many months before the only\npeople (Mrs. Sidgwick and myself) who knew of this first answer, saw any\nsense whatever in it ; and two years before any one suggested any sort of link\nbetween the \"Archytas\" Ode and On a Spring Morning at Sea.\n2\nAfter May 13, 1907, the date of 178, Mrs. Verrall gave up writing script\ntill June 19, 1907. 180 was the second script she wrote after resuming. So\nbetween 176 and 178, and 178 and 180 (as the numbers show) only one script\nintervened respectively.\n\f204 J. G. Piddington. [part\nform a suite, and contain allusions to Venice and On a Sjwing\nMorning at Sea.\nAs I have already (see Proc., Vol. XXIV., p. 168, and above,\np. 178) twice explained what in my view was the meaning-\nunderlying the combination of allusions to On a Spring Morning\nat Sea and the \" Archytas \" Ode when discussing the allusions\nto both found in Mrs. Verrall's early scripts of 1901, I need now\nonly say that I place the same interpretation on the occurrence\nof allusions to the same poem in a suite of scripts, of which the\nfirst (176) is closely associated with the \"Archytas\" Ode by\nreason of Mrs. Verrall's experiment.\nThe way is now clear to answer the question which I\nleft unanswered some time back :\n\" \"What was the object of\nthe reference to Venice ?\n\"\nI am indebted to Mr. Gerald Balfour for being able to supply\nwhat I hope will seem to be not only a plausible but a con-\nvincing answer. I felt sure that 176, 178 and 180 do allude\nto Venice ;\nbut, as I could not understand the poem, I not\nunnaturally failed to see any reason for the allusions. Mr.\nBalfour interpreted the poem for me, and at the same time\nshowed me why the allusions to it were appropriate. The poem\nis obscure, perhaps intentionally obscure ; but I have no doubt\nthat Mr. Balfour is right in his interpretation of it, which,\nrendered into my own language, is this :\nIt was a true instinct that led the Venetian painters\nto portray their Doges in a setting in which were embodied\nboth the Heavenly City of their spiritual aspirations and\nthe City of their \" earthly care,\" the one gradually eclipsing\nthe other and more transient interest. It was a true\ninstinct, because \" the wonderful Dead who have passed\nthrough the body and gone\" are still mindful of those\n\" militant here on earth \" ;\nnot, indeed, restricting their\ninterest to a merely passive sympathy, but rather actively\nguiding and inspiring the \" race of men.\" Moreover, this\n\" communion of saints \" is no one-sided fellowship, for the\nspirits of \"just men made perfect\" need our love and\nremembrance that their joy may be full.\n1\nlr\nrhis paraphrase does not cover the concluding lines of the poem, which I\nshall touch on later (see p. 210).\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 205\nThe general correctness of the interpretation here offered is,\nI think, proved by the motto Nee me meet cura fefellit\u2014\nattached to the poem in Fragments. This motto is taken from\nthe first words of greeting spoken by Anchises when Aeneas\nmeets him in the Elysian Fields :\n\" Art thou come at last,\nand has thy love, child of my desire, conquered the difficult\nroad ? Is it granted, 0 my son, to gaze on thy face, to hear\nand to answer in the speech we know ? Thus indeed did I\nforecast in spirit, counting the days between ; nor has my care\nmisled me.\"\n1\n(Sic cquidem. ducebam animo rebarquc futurum,\nTcmpora dimimcrans, nee me mea cura fefellit.)\n2\nMoreover, to a MS. copy of the poem which Myers sent to\na friend, he had affixed another motto, in place of the Vergilian\none, which equally indicates the intention of the poem. This\nother motto was Ut non. sine nobis consummarentur, the\nVulgate version of the last half of the last verse of the\neleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews. I will quote\nits context in order to make the applicability of the motto\nplain :\nAnd these all [i.e. the fathers of old time], having obtained a good\nreport through faith, received not the promise : God having provided\nsome better thing for us, that they without us should not be made\nperfect [Ut non sine nobis consummarentur]. Wherefore seeing we also\nare compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses. . . .\n3\n1\nMackail's Translation.\n2\nThe first line and half of the second are thus paraphrased in the poem :\n\"They count thy coming, and thy fates foreknow.\"\n3\nThe MS. copy of Venice with the motto Ut non sine nobis consummarentur\nis dated March 21, 1900. Since this paper was written Miss Alice Johnson\nhas pointed out to me that the words Ut non sine nobis consummarentur occur\nin Myers's Presidential Address which was delivered on May 18, 1900, and\noccur in a context which gives expression to exactly the same thought as\ninforms Venice.\n\"Perhaps,\" writes Myers, \"in the spiritual world as well we have strained\nour gaze too exclusively on luminaries that are beyond the parallactic limit :\nand eyes turned steadily on some nearer brightness may teach us at last our\nkinship and community in the firmament of souls.\n\" Not, then, with tears and lamentations should we think of the blessed dead.\nRather we should rejoice with them in their enfranchisement, and know that\n\f206 J. G. Pidclington. [part\nThe thought that inspired Venice, the thought, that is, of\nthe dependence of the two worlds on each other, of the con-\ntinued interest of the dead in us, and of their desire for our\ncontinued interest in them, how complete a contrast it pre-\nsents with the thought of the \" Archytas \" Ode and with\nthe doubts and misgivings of Im mortality !\nBut let us go back for a moment to On a Spring Morning\nat Sea. This poem is clearly in harmony with Venice on the\none hand, and as clearly in disaccord with the \" Archytas\nOde and Immortality on the other ;\nthough both the harmony\nand the disaccord will be all the more plainly revealed if we\nread the context in which On a Spring Morning appears in\nMyers's Fragments of Prose and Poetry (p. 53). It runs thus:\nWe need, as I have elsewhere said, a summons \" to no houri-\nhaunted paradise, no passionless contemplation, no monotony of prayer\nand praise ; but to endless advance by endless effort, and, if need\nbe, by endless pain.\" Be it mine, then, to plunge among the unknown\nDestinies, to dare and still to dare !\nMeanwhile the background of Eternity shows steadfast through all\nthe pageants of the shifting world. . . .\nAnd then, except for four lines which I need not quote, comes\nthe poem. For my part I find it impossible to believe that\nMyers could have written the opening sentence of the above\nextract without having in his mind the second stanza of his\npoem Immortality.\nThe image in the last sentence about \" the background of\nEternity \" showing \" steadfast through all the pageants of the\nshifting world \" exactly reverses the imagery in Venice\nThro' that clear vision fades, remotely fair,\nThe Imperial City of all his earthly care,\nWhose few last arches glimmer, \u2014and all the rest\nWhelmed in that thronging welcome of the Blest.\nthey are still minded to keep us as sharers in their joy. It is they, not we,\nwho are working now ;\nthey are more ready to hear than we to pray ;\nthey\nguide us as with a cloudy pillar, but it is kindling into steadfast fire.\n\" Nay, it may be that our response, our devotion, is a needful element in\ntheir ascending joy ; and God may have provided some better thing for us,\nthat they without us should not be made perfect; Ut non sine nobis consum-\nmarentur.\" (Pror., Vol. XV., p. 123.)\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Ansiver to tJte Horace Ode Question. 207\nHere, as also of course in the pictures which inspired the\npoem, Eternity is in the foreground and the earthly city in\nthe background. But though the imagery differs, the funda-\nmental thought is the same ;\nand I think it not unlikely\nthat Myers had this part of the context of On a Spring\nMorning at Sea in his mind when he wrote the lines in\nVenice.1\nWhile, then, on the one hand, we have reasons for believ-\ning that in Frederic Myers's mind the \" Archytas \" Ode was\nassociated with Immortality, and Immortality in turn with\nthe context of On a Spring Morning at Sea, and hence with\nthe poem itself, and some grounds for thinking that the\ncontext of On a Spring Morning at Sea, and accordingly the\npoem itself, may have been associated in his mind with\nVenice\u2014while, I say, we have reasons for thinking that these\nassociations did exist or may have existed in the mind of\nFrederic Myers ; we have reasons also for believing that\nMyersP and Myersv shared these associations.\n\" Ode to Nature.\"\nMyersp and Myersv and Frederic Myers, I have suggested,\nassociated Immortality, On a Spring Morning at Sea and\nVenice with the \" Archytas \" Ode, and with each other, because\nthese three poems give utterance to views about man's destiny\neither accordant, discordant or comparable with the view\nexpressed by Horace on the same subject in the \" Archytas\nOde.\nBut Myersp, it will be remembered, also associated a fourth\npoem of Frederic Myers's with the Horace Ode, namely, Ode\nto Nature. It was, indeed, so he said, the first poem that\ncame to his mind in connexion with the question :\n\" Which\nOde of Horace had entered deeply into your inner life ?\nThe only explanation I have hitherto been able to offer\n(Proc., Vol. XXII., pp. 401-402) of why MyersP mentioned\nOde to Nature in connexion with the Horace Ode Question is\nthat it contains echoes of Hor. C. iii. 4, an ode entirely dis-\ntinct from C. i. 28, the \"Archytas\" Ode.\n1\nOn a Spring Morning at Sea and the passages quoted above from Fragments\nwere written not later than 1893. Venice was composed in 1900.\n\f208 G. Piddington. [part\nAlthough I still think that Ode to Nature does contain\nechoes of Hor. C. iii. 4, this explanation no longer appears to\nme a sufficient one. Miss Johnson has discovered another\nsolution, and, as I think, a much better one, because it\nexplains the reference to Ode to Nature on exactly the same\nlines as I have explained the references to the three other\npoems of Myers's.\nBut before stating what Miss Johnson's interpretation is, I\nhad better first quote and discuss the exact words in which\nthe reference to Ode to Nature was made by MyersP.\nThey\nwere as follows :\n\" I had Ode to Nature on my mind, but as\nI thought I loved another ode better I did not reply until I\ncould say it more clearly. Do you remember imortality [sic] . .\n.\"\n(Proc., Vol. XXII., p. 369).\nIn my first paper I took \" another ode \" to mean another\nOde of Horaces. This interpretation, in the first place, in-\nvolves the assumption that MyersP at first hesitated as to\nwhich Ode of Horace's was the subject of Mrs. Verrall's\nquestion.\n1\nIn the second place it involves taking the actual\nwords of MyerSp in a sense which, though legitimate, is not,\nI think, on the whole the most obvious one ; for while the\nfirst \" Ode \" certainly means Myers's Ode, I had to make the\nword \" ode \" when it occurred a second time refer to an\nHoratian Ode.\nBut let us apply the second \" ode \" as well as the first to\nMyers's poems. Then \" another ode \" must mean Immortality.\nI need not debate the purely academic question of whether\nImmortality may properly be called an \"Ode\"; though I am\ntold on good authority that it has at least as good a claim to\nthe designation as many other English poems so entitled. What\nwe need is evidence to show that MyersP called Immortality\nan Ode. Evidence to this effect is to be found in one of Mr.\nDorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper. On March 10, 1908\u2014nearly\na year after the Horace Ode Question had been asked and\nanswered\u2014Mr. Dorr, who knew nothing whatever about the\n1\nIn saying this I must not be understood to imply that such hesitation\nwould he prejudicial to the theory that Myersp has access to the memories of\nFrederic Myers ; for a man with the readiest and best equipped of memories,\nif challenged to recall a literary judgement that he had passed in years gone\nby, might surely show some hesitation about his reply, and yet run no risk\nof the integrity of his personality being called in question.\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to tUk Horace Ode Question. 209-\nquestion or the answers to it, on his own initiative read to\nMyerSp a passage from Fragments in which Frederic Myers\ndescribes his early familiarity with various Greek and Latin\npoets, among them Horace. As the name Horace was read out,\nMyerSp wrote :\nOde to i motalty imortality\n. . . Ode Horace to Mortality.\nHere it seems clear that the poem Immortality is called\n\" Ode to Immortality.\" I do not think that it is an error for\n\" Ode to Mortality \" which immediately follows it. On the\ncontrary, I believe that \" Ode to Immortality \" is meant to\nrefer to Myers's poem, and that \" Ode to Mortality \" is a title\n\u2014and not a bad title, either\u2014invented by MyersP to designate\nthe \" Archytas \" Ode.\nSo I now am of opinion that MyersP did not connect Ode to\nNature with one Horatian Ode and Immortality with another,\nbut that he connected both poems with one and the same Ode\nof Horace, namely, the \" Archytas \" Ode.\nWhat, then, is the connexion between Ode to Nature and the\n\" Archytas \" Ode ? Miss Johnson's answer to that problem is\nthis : In Ode to Nature Myers assigns to the soul after the\ndeath of the body only some sort of un-individualised existence.\nNature only \" endureth to the end \" : the soul at death is\nreabsorbed into the blind world of Nature from which it\nsprang\nLet all in darkness end, as darkly all began !\nHence, hence I too had birth,\nOne soul with the ancient Earth,\nBeyond this human ancestry of pain :\nMy soul was even as ye 1 \u2014\nShe was, \u2014and she would be; \u2014\nO Earth, and Night, and Nought, enfold her once again !\nSo Ode to Nature strikes as sombre a note as the \" Archytas\n\"\nOde, for absorption into the physical universe is the annihilation\nof personality.\n1 \" Ye \" means the blind forces of nature.\n0\n\f210 J. G. Piddington. [part\nNow contrast the cheerless speculations of Ode to Nature with\nthe closing lines of Venice :\n1\nbut she [i.e. Venice]\nDreams in her melted Pearl of sky and sea.\nFor me too dreaming let the sunset fire\nShade the dark dome and pierce the pillared spire !\nLet night and peace the cosmic promise pay,\nAnd even the Soul's self dream into the day!\nThere is no loss of personality here ; the self is no longer\nto he enfolded into Night and Nought, but dreams \" into the\nday.\"\nConclusion.\nAs I have now done my best to explain why, in answering\nthe Horace Ode Question, MyersP referred to Ode to Nature and\nImmortality, and Myersv to Venice and On a Spring Morning at\nSea, it only remains for me to state in a few words the upshot\nof the new evidence.\nThe five scripts of Mrs. Verrall's, 136, 171, 176, 178 and 180,\nwhich constitute the new evidence, tend, I submit, to confirm\nthe interpretation which in 1909 I placed upon her four early\nscripts of 1901. They likewise tend to confirm the two\ninterpretations, which I arrived at in 1908 and 1909, of the\nanswers given by MyersP to the Horace Ode Question in 1907\nand 1908.\nBut they do something more.\nIn my two previous papers I suggested that Myersv and\nMyerSp had contrasted the dismal speculations about \" the\ndoubtful doom of human kind \" in the \" Archytas \" Ode and\nImmortality (and to these I should now add Ode to Nature)\nwith the optimistic forecasts of Abt Vogler and On a Spring\nMorning at Sea. If I have interpreted the new evidence\n1\nFor the assistance of readers who may wish to trace the development of\nMyers's views about a future life, I append the dates of the four poems dis-\ncussed in this paper :\nImmortality was first published in 1870 ;\nOde to Nature was written between 1869 and 1873 ;\nOn a Spring Morning at Sea was written not later than 1893 ; and\nVenice was written in March 1900, some ten months or so before Myers's\ndeath.\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 211\naright, to these two happier forecasts must now be added the\nHeavenly Jerusalem of the Apocalypse, the Elysian plain of\nthe Fourth Book of the Odyssey, the Paradise of Celtic Legend,\nthe Tennysonian Island-Valley of Avilion, and that \" Universal\nCountry,\" depicted for us in Venice, which embraces in one\ncommon and conscious citizenship both the living and the dead.\nNote A.\nOn the Discovery of Coincidences between 178 and\n\" On a Spring Morning at Sea.\"\nThe verbal coincidences between this poem and 178 I first\nnoticed in 1910, when, some months after the publication of my\nsecond paper on the Horace Ode Question, I was engaged in\nindexing and annotating a large batch of Mrs. Verrall's scripts.\nIn this second paper I had pointed out the verbal resemblances\nbetween On a Spring Morning cd Sea and four early scripts\nof Mrs. Verrall's written in 1901. But as I did not in 1910\nnotice the connexion between 178 and 176, and was not then\naware of any sort of link between 176 and the \" Archytas \" Ode,\nthe discovery of verbal coincidences between the poem and 178,\nwhile they appeared interesting enough to be worth noting,\nconveyed nothing further to my mind. The date of the discovery\nis important, because it shows that in detecting the coincidences\nI could not have been influenced by the interpretation of 176 and\n178 at which I arrived only in January 1912. In other words,\nafter interpreting 176 and 178 as an answer to the Horace Ode\nQuestion, I did not say to myself, \" Go to ! you must now\ndiscover in 176 and 178 coincidences with On a Spring Morning\nat Sea.\" Likewise, after discovering the coincidences with the\npoem, I did not say to myself, \" You must now by hook or crook\nsomehow manage to hitch 178 on to the Horace Ode.\" The\ndiscovery of the coincidences between 178 and the poem, and the\ndiscovery of the connexion between 176 and the \" Archytas\nOde were independently made.\n\f212 G.

[part\nIn every instance, except perhaps the last (and even there we\nfind combined the ideas of a pearly sky and of early morning),\nthe emergence of the word \" pearl \" is, I believe, traceable to\none and the same group of associated ideas as is exhibited in\nthe scripts connected with the Horace Ode. Thus, \" orient\npearl \" occurs in 178 ;\n\" pearl \" occurs in 180 in connexion with\nCleopatra and with a quotation from Antony and Cleopatra, in\nwhich play Antony makes a gift to Cleopatra of an \" orient\npearl\"; \"pearl\" and \"Eastern\" occur in 212, a script containing\nreminiscences of a passage in Paradise Lost, Book Y. ; and\n\" orient \" and \" pearl \" occur in 223, a script containing reminis-\ncences of the same passage in Paradise Lost ; and in 176, 178, 212,\n223 and 344, \" pearl \" is combined with \" early morning \" or\n\" dawn.\" Moreover, 223 has \" the pearl of sky and sea,\" which\nlooks like an echo of \"her melted Pearl of sky and sea\" in\nVenice. The fact of this close approximation to the phrase\nin Venice being followed by the words \" no not that \" goes\nto support Mrs. Verrall's theory that there are allusions to Venice\nin 176 and 178 ; for to a student familiar with the scripts \" no\nnot that\" signifies that the phrase thus negatived has previously\nemerged in some other script. It is true that the phrase \" pearl\nof sky and sea \" had not occurred before in Mrs. Verrall's script,\nbut we may legitimately suppose that the scribe thought that\neither the actual phrase or a sufficiently close approximation to\nit had been recorded in 176 and 178.\nThis way of retracting words or phrases written by the\nautomatist by means of some such negatory comment as no,\nnot that,\" \" no, that is different,\" is very common, and is\nusually, I believe, confined to cases where in the course of an\nattempt to express some new phrase or idea, an old phrase or\nidea, like\u2014though not the same as\u2014the new one has re-emerged\nby mistake.\nThe facts detailed above show that the occurrence of \"pearl\"\nin Mrs. Verrall's script is no haphazard affair, and tell in favour\nof the synthesis of \" pearl \" scripts propounded in this paper.\n\" Pearls and a jasper gate\" in 93 suggests the imagery of the\n21st chapter of Pevelation.\n\flxv.] Unsuspected Ansiver to the Horace Ode Question. 215\nNote D.\nMrs. Verrall's Script of October 27, 1905 (51), and its\nconnexion with 174, 176 and 178.\n(51) (Oct. 27, 1905)\n[About 10 p.m. in train before Hatfield.]\nPathorne evangel S.

So he begins\nby thinking of the patron Saint of Venice, St. Mark the\nEvangelist, book in hand, and his lion couchant at his feet.\nBut once the automatist has got hold of the idea of a picture\nof a Saint with a book and a lion, it suggests to her pictures\nof St. Jerome, whose regular emblem is a lion, and who is\nvery frequently represented studying \" the sacred books \" or trans-\n\fLxv.] Unsuspected Answer to the Horace Ode Question. 217\nlating them. Frequently, too, an angel is inspiring or dictating\nto St. Jerome. Hence the angel of the script. And in one\npicture, at least\u2014-and that one very familiar to Mrs. Verrall\nin a photographic reproduction\u2014Carpaccio's \" St. Jerome in\nhis Study \" (in the chapel of S. Giorgio dei Schiavoni at\nVenice), there is, as Euskin says, a \" happy white dog\n\" watching his master translating the Bible, with highest com-\nplacency of approval.\" And in Diirer's engraving with the\nsame title\u2014also known to Mrs. Verrall\u2014St. Jerome is seated\nat a desk in the background, while in the foreground a lion\nand another animal, which some authorities call a dog and\nothers a fox, are asleep. Hence the leone eaneqne dormientibus\nof the script.\nThe script, then, is the resultant of a struggle between the\nscribe's thoughts and thoughts aroused thereby in the auto-\nmatist's mind. On the whole the scribe managed to hold his\nown fairly well, for he succeeded in negativing the allusions to\nSt. Jerome, and in insisting on his original reference to St. Mark.\nIt may be that the emergence of the automatist's recollec-\ntions of the St. Jerome picture was facilitated by there being\nlatent in the scribe's consciousness a recollection of the picture\nby Palma Giovine (Plate 2), in which St. Mark and St.\nJerome both appear with their respective lions.\nIt should be noted that this script (as also the script of\nAugust 15, 1906, discussed in Note E), was written after the\npublication of Fragments of Prose and Poetry, and accordingly\nafter Mrs. Verrall was normally acquainted with the poem\nVenice.\nMrs. Verrall's Script of August 15, 19 0 6 (88), and\nNote E.\nITS CONNEXION WITH 176 AND 178.\n(88) (Aug. 15, 1906. 10 p.m.)\nMary Tredegan. on a long green slope crowned with\nfirs against a western sky.\n\f218 J.

The V\nin 178, I have suggested, is the initial letter of the word\nVenice. Here, I fancy, it may have the same significance.\nThe words in 88 \" on a long green slope crowned with firs\nagainst a western sky \" may be compared with the words in\n176 :\n\" Spires of flame like the tops of cypress trees, cypress\ntops against a pearly sky\" (see pp. 183 and 193).\nThe last paragraph of 88 unmistakably refers to the passage\nin Odyssey, XI. 487-491, where Achilles says to Odysseus:\nNay, speak not comfortably to me of death, oh great Odysseus.\nRather would I live attached to the soil (or, \" above ground \")\nas the serf of another, with a landless man who had no great\nlivelihood, than bear sway among all the dead that be departed.\nNow it was to these very words that reference was made\nin Mrs. Verrall's four early scripts of 1901 by means of\nthe phrase adscriptus glehae, \" attached to the soil\n\" 1\n; and these\nfour early scripts contained reminiscences of the \" Archytas\nOde, and also, I have suggested, allusions to Myers's Immortality\nand On a Spring Morning at Sea.\nBut 176 and 178 are connected with the \" Archytas \" Ode,\nand present coincidences with On a Spring Morning at Sea, and\nVenice.

She has thought\nof the double thread.'\nIf, then, my interpretation of this script, of Mrs. Verrall's\nscript of October 27, 1905 (see Note D), and of her four\nearly scripts of 1901, is right, MyersP and Myersv in 1907\nconstructed their answers to the Horace Ode Question largely\nout of old material taken from Mrs. Verrall's scripts. New\nillustrations were indeed introduced\u2014namely, Ode to Nature\nand the lines from Aht Vogler by MyersP, and the allusions\nto the Heavenly Jerusalem and so on by Myersv ; but the\nkeynote was the same throughout.\nIt is by no means rare to find a subject being thus\npursued, with what seems almost relentless and tiresome per-\nsistence, over a period of several years. It is a feature common\nto the scripts of Mrs. Verrall, Miss Verrall and Mrs. Holland,\nboth jointly and severally. And one of the most interesting\npoints about it is that only, as a rule, in the most obvious\ninstances is the automatist aware of the reiterations : and,\neven when she is, she seldom sees the point of them.\nIt has usually been reserved for a student of the scripts to\ntrace the series of allusions\u2014often taking very diverse\nshape\u2014to a given subject running through a number of widely\nseparated scripts, and to furnish a clue to their meaning.\nSometimes, however, light has been thrown on the meaning\nof such a series occurring in the script of A by a comment\nor comments in the script of B, who in some cases has, and\nin others has not, been acquainted with A's scripts. Some-\ntimes, too, Mrs. Verrall has traced such a series of allusions\nin her own or others' scripts, and worked out the meaning\nunderlying them ; but then she is in the exceptional position\nof playing at one time the role of automatist, at another\nthat of student. In this case, however, it should be clearly\nunderstood that she is not responsible for the interpretation\nof any of the scripts discussed in this paper. Her only\ncontribution was to point out that 176 and 178 contain verbal\ncoincidences with Venice.\nThe ideas which eventually constituted the answers of\n\f220 J. G. Pidclington. [part\nMyersp and Myersv to the Horace Ode Question had, then,\nit would seem, been lying dormant in Mrs. Verrall's script\nfor several years. But they had been so cryptically or\nimperfectly expressed, had emerged in so disconnected a\nfashion and at such long intervals, that their meaning had\nescaped detection.\nThen in 1907 the putting of a test-question about an\nOde of Horace afforded\u2014though quite undesignedly\u2014an appro-\npriate focus for the scattered fragments of former years.\nMyersp and Myersv seized the chance, and grouped the frag-\nments round the \" Archytas \" Ode. But the fact of 176 being\nconnected with the \" Archytas \" Ode was overlooked until\n1912, and it was only then, when the connexion was for\nthe first time recognised, that the entire series of fragmentary\nallusions in Mrs. Verrall's scripts between 1901 and 1907\ncould be put together so as to yield a coherent meaning.\nWhen indexing and annotating Mrs. Verrall's scripts in 1910\nand 1911, I had noted many of the verbal coincidences\nbetween 55, 88, 136, 140, 171, 174, 176, 178 and 180, which I have\npointed out in the course of this paper. But, though fully\nalive to the importance of such coincidences as indicating how\none script should be dovetailed with another, the unifying\nthought that explains and justifies the synthesis indicated by\nthe superficial coincidences would have remained unrevealed,\nhad not the connexion of 176 with the \" Archytas \" Ode\nsupplied the clue.\n\flxv.] Some Observations on the Foregoing Paper. 221\nSOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE FOREGOING PAPER.\nBy the Right Hon. G. W. BALFOUR.\nThere are altogether four sets of scripts which hear on this\ncase. These are\n(1) Mrs. Verrall's scripts of 1901.\n(2) Mrs. Piper's scripts of 1907.\n(3) Mrs. Verrall's scripts of 1907.\n(4) Mrs. Piper's scripts of 1908.\nLet us for the moment dismiss from our minds the first\nand last of these, and confine our attention entirely to the\nscripts of 1907. It was in that year that the Horace Ode\nQuestion was asked and answered, and it is with this question\nand the answer to it that we are primarily concerned.\nThe question was first put to MyersP on Jan. 23, 1907 :\n\" Which Ode of Horace entered deeply into your inner life ?\n\".\nAny answer would be correct which pointed directly or indirectly\nto the Archytas Ode.\nNo direct answer was attempted ; but if we are to accept\nMr. Piddington's views, a satisfactory indirect answer may be\nelicited (1) from the Piper scripts taken alone, (2) from the\nPiper scripts and the contemporaneous Verrall scripts when\ncompared together.\nThe Piper scripts taken alone connect the desired. Ode of\nHorace (a) with certain lines in Alt Vogler; (b) with Myers's\npoem Immortality ;\n(c) with the Odyssey, and so by implication\nthough this is conjectural\u2014with the famous declaration of Achilles\nin the Underworld that a living serf is better off than a king\namong the dead. These literary references ail have a bearing\non man's state after death ; and as this subject also forms\nthe burden of the \" Archytas \" Ode, and as, moreover, the poem\non Immortality seems to show some coincidence of language\n\f222 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nas well as of thought with the \" Archytas \" Ode, an intention\nto indicate the latter as the Ode in question may be inferred\nwith a great measure of probability.\nMr. Piddington further points out that, whereas in the\n\" Archytas \" Ode, in Myers's Immortality, and in the eleventh\nbook of the Odyssey, gloomy views are taken of man's hereafter,\na different and happier conception of it inspires Abt Vogler.\nAccordingly he suggests that this also is intentional, and that\nMyerSp deliberately meant to call attention to the contrast.\nHere we are clearly on more doubtful ground, since there is\nno hint of such intention in the script itself.\n1\nI now pass to the connexion which Mr. Piddington believes\nhe has discovered between the Horace Ode Question and certain\nof Mrs. Verrall's contemporaneous scripts. If he is right, the\nanswer to the Horace Ode Question given in the Piper scripts is\nsupplemented and confirmed by a cross-correspondence between\nthose scripts and Mrs. Verrall's.\nThe five Verrall scripts cited by Mr. Piddington contain\nunmistakable allusions to mystic or legendary descriptions of\nthe Abode of Blest.\nThe \" island valley of Avilion \" of the Morte d'Arthur and the\n\" Heavenly City \" of the Apocalypse are quite definitely referred\nto ; and I am disposed to agree with Mr. Piddington that allusions\nare probably made to Myers's Venice, and perhaps also to his\nOn a S2rring Morning at Sea, both of which poems depict in\ncelestial colours the future in store for those who have\n\" passed through the body and gone.\"\nIt is clear, then, that we have here the elements of a cross-\ncorrespondence, man's future destiny forming the central topic\nround which all the scripts turn, and different views, favour-\nable or unfavourable, of that destiny forming the subordinate\ntopics distributed between the two automatists. What is not\nso clear is that the cross-correspondence is intentional, in other\nwords, that the allusions in the Verrall scripts are meant by\n1\nMr. Piddington now connects the mention of Myers's Ode to Nature in the\nPiper sitting of April 17, 1907, with the \"Archytas\" Ode, whereas formerly he\ntook it to refer to another Ode of Horace altogether, viz. C. iii. 4, which\nMyersr ultimately rejected as not being the Horatian Ode which \" entered most\ndeeply into his inner life.\" For reasons which it is unnecessary to go into\nnow, I believe his original interpretation was right. I have accordingly\nomitted all mention of the Ode to Nature from my remarks on the case.\n\flxv.] Some Observations on the Foregoing Paper. 223\nthe communicating intelligence to be taken as part of the\nanswer to the Horace Ode Question.\nIf we confine our attention to the two sets of scripts\nproduced in 1907, what reasons are there (apart from the\ngeneral similarity of subject) for thus connecting them\ntogether ?\nMr. Piddington gives one reason and one reason only.\nOn May 7, the date of Script No. 176, which he interprets\nas referring to Myers's Venice, Mrs. Verrall, before beginning\nto write, deliberately fixed her attention on the \" Archytas \" Ode.\nFrom this circumstance Mr. Piddington thinks we are entitled\nto infer that the script which followed was intended by the\n\" communicator \" to be taken in connection with the Horace\nOde Question. It is certainly noteworthy that a script produced\nunder these conditions should be found capable of being fitted\ninto the answer to that question. But I cannot regard the\nargument as by any means conclusive. The odds against such\na coincidence are surely not so great as Mr. Piddington seems\nto imply. Mrs. Verrall produced only a limited number of\nscripts during the time that she had any reason for fixing\nher miud on the \" Archytas \" Ode, and of this limited number\nat least five, according to Mr. Piddington's own showing,\nare capable of being fitted into the answer to the Horace Ode\nQuestion.\nOn the other hand, there are two considerations which, so\nfar as they go, seem to me to tell against Mr. Piddington's\ncontention. The first of these is the complete absence from\nthe Verrall scripts themselves of any hint of a connexion\nwith the Horace Ode Question. The second is the possibility\nof connecting them with what, prima facie at least, must be\nregarded as a different topic altogether.\nMr. Piddington has not, 1 think, noticed in his paper that\none of the five Verrall scripts which he quotes has been\nalready cited by him (in Ar\nol. XXII. of the Proc.) as belonging\nto the avros ovpavo? oucufiaiv series. I refer to Script No. 136,\nwhich contains the passage about \" the island valley of Avilion\nwhere blows not any wind,\" etc. The date of this script is\nFeb. 12, 1907, and it was followed on Feb. 25 by another\nwhich quotes from the well-known passage in Tennyson's\nLucretius, describing the abode of the Epicurean gods :\n\f224 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nThe lucid interspace of world and world\nWhere never creeps, a cloud, nor moves a wind, <\nNor ever falls the least white star of snow,\nNor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,\nNor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar\nTheir sacred everlasting calm ! and such\nNot all so fine, nor so divine a calm,\nNot such, nor all unlike it, man may gain\nLetting his own life go.\nThis script, like No. 136, is included by Mr. Piddington in\nthe avTog oupavo<; uKufxcov series, and if it is legitimate to\nconnect No. 136 with the Horace Ode series, I do not\nunderstand why the script of Feb. 25 is not entitled to the\nsame distinction.\nA \" heavenly calm \" may indeed be said to be a prominent\nfeature in every one of the visionary Abodes of the Blest alluded\nto in the five Verrall scripts selected by Mr. Piddington as\nforming part of the answer to the Horace Ode Question, and\nall of them, it seems to me, might find an appropriate place\nin the avTog ovpavos cucufutiv series. It is no doubt possible\nthat they may have been intended to play a double part.\nI certainly do not summarily reject such a hypothesis ; but\nI think it is one which should be received with caution.\nOn the whole, if account is taken of the 1907 scripts only,\nit does not appear to me that a strong case has been made\nout for the supposed cross-correspondence. Is any further light\nthrown upon the question by the Verrall scripts of 1901 or\nthe Piper scripts of 1908 ?\nOf the Piper scripts of 1908 (produced in America in the\npresence of Mr. Dorr, who was in complete ignorance that\nany question about an Ode of Horace had been either asked\nor answered), it may at once be said that, while they confirm\nin the strongest manner, and indeed in my judgment make\npractically certain, the general correctness of Mr. Piddington's\ninterpretation of the answer given to it in the Piper scripts\nof the previous year, they give us no assistance in forming a\nconclusion on the further issue raised in his latest paper.\nIt is otherwise with the Verrall scripts of 1901. These\nscripts, which at first seemed little better than mere gibberish,\nare now turning out to be of great interest and possibly of\n\flxv.] Some Observations on the Foregoing Paper. 225\ngreat importance. For they not only seem to associate the\n\" Archytas \" Ode with the stanzas on Immortality and with the\n\u20ac7rdpovpo<; passage of the eleventh book of the Odyssey (thereby\nanticipating the Piper scripts of 1907 and 1908), but also\npossibly\u2014with Myers's lines On a Spring Morning at Sea, a\npoem which was not published until the year 1904. The\nelucidation of these early Verrall scripts we owe, like that\nof so many others, to the ingenuity of Mr. Piddington, and\nif his interpretation of them is correct, they practically\ncontain, in skeleton, the whole of the answer to the Horace\nOde Question which he reads into the subsequent Piper and\nVerrall scripts of 1907.\nI shall probably be doing Mr. Piddington no injustice in\nsurmising that had it not been for the early Verrall scripts\nof 1901 the idea of connecting the later Verrall scripts of\n1907 with the answer to the Horace Ode Question would\nnever have occurred to him. At the same time, I must frankly\nadmit that the fact of the earlier and the later Verrall scripts\nboth lending themselves to his interpretation is, to say the\nleast of it, curious ; and whatever the explanation of the fact\nmay be, it does, I think, very materially corroborate his view\nof the case as a whole. I still cannot regard as definitely\nproved either the connexion of the Verrall scripts of 1907\nwith the Horace Ode Question, or the hypothesis of a\ndeliberate cross-correspondence intended to suggest a contrast\nbetween the despairing and the hopeful conceptions of man's\ndestiny after death. But the cumulative effect of the evidence\ndoes, in my judgment, make Mr. Piddington's interpretation\nplausible and even probable.\nThe question still remains, What is the significance of the\nentire incident, and what light does it throw upon the source\nfrom which the scripts emanate ?\nThe new matter now brought forward by Mr. Piddington\nhas a bearing on the answer to this question, as will presently\nbe seen. But for the moment let us ignore it.\nThe outstanding point in the case will still be this : that\nthe materials employed in providing a correct, though indirect,\nreply to the Horace Ode Question in the Piper scripts of 1907\nand 1908 are also found conjoined in the early Verrall scripts\nof 1901.\np\n\f226 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nThus we have\nTwo quotations from the \" Archy-\nIn V. Scripts of 1901. In P.

Nor can it be\nascribed to any normal knowledge acquired by Mrs. Piper\nbefore 1907 of the early Verrall scripts, because these scripts,\neven if she had read them in Mrs. Verrall's volume published in\nOctober, 1906, must have been quite unintelligible to her without\nexplanation, and no explanation had at that time been offered.\nNor again can we ascribe it to Mrs. Verrall's supraliminal\nconsciousness, for her conscious understanding of the interest\ntaken by Myers in the \" Archytas \" Ode would have suggested\nquite a different answer from that which MyersP actually gives.\nIt would seem, therefore, that we must attribute the coinci-\ndence either to the action of some intelligence external to\nboth automatists, or else to a supernormal communication of\nideas between their subconscious selves. This latter is the\nhypothesis to which the cautious enquirer would naturally\nhave recourse in the first instance, especially in view of the\nfact that the question started from Mrs. Verrall herself, that\nshe knew the straightforward answer to it, and that the\n\" Archytas \" Ode already had associations in her own script, the\nsignificance of which might have been comprehended by her\nsubliminal, though hidden from her normal, self.\nThe weak point in this explanation is that it takes no\naccount of the origin of the early Verrall scripts. Are we to\nregard these as purely the work of Mrs. Verrall's subliminal\nimagination ?\nThe references to the \" Archytas \" Ode might no doubt be\ndue to subliminal memory of Myers's letter to Dr. Verrall, in\nwhich he specially emphasises the impression produced on his\nmind by lines 5 and 6 of the \" Archytas \" Ode\nAerias tentasse domos animoque rotundum\nPercurisse polum morituro.\"\n\flxv.] Some Observations on the Foregoing Paper. 227\n(It is from these very lines that the reminiscent phrases in the\nVerrall scripts of Mar. 5 and Apr. 27, 1901, are drawn.) Myers's\nletter was written in 1884, and had not been seen by Mrs.\nVerrall since the beginning of 1885 ; but there is nothing\nunusual in the emergence of a cryptic memory after that\ninterval of time. References, on the other hand, to Immortality\nand to On a Spring Morning at Sea cannot be explained in\nthis easy manner. For Mrs. Verrall is confident that she\nnever saw either of these poems until several years later.\nShe might be mistaken with respect to Immortality, which had\nbeen published in 1870 and again in 1875, although it had\nbeen long out of print in 1901. But she could hardly be\nmistaken as regards On a Spring Morning at Sea,\n1\nwhich\ndid not see the light until it was published in Fragments of\nProse and Poetry in 1904. Immortality also was reprinted\nin this volume, and was there read by Mrs. Verrall (as she\nfirmly believes) for the first time.\nIf it be admitted that Mrs. Verrall never saw the two\npoems until 1904, it is obvious that the question whether her\nearly scripts really do contain references to them becomes\nthe most important of all the questions raised by the entire\nincident. An affirmative answer clearly carries with it the\nconclusion that some source of information other than her\nconscious or subconscious self must have been drawn upon in\nproducing the scripts.\nNo doubt it might still be argued that the external source\nof information was the mind of some living person to whom\nthe poems were known, and not the surviving personality of\nFrederic Myers ; and that Mrs. Verrall's subliminal self,\nhaving acquired knowledge of the poems in this way, proceeded\nto weave it, together with other materials, into the texture\nwhich Mr. Piddington's ingenuity has at last succeeded in\nunravelling. While such a view cannot, I think, be definitely\nrefuted, I will only say that it seems to me to throw a\nburden on Mrs. Verrall's subliminal consciousness which we\ncannot lightly accept for it.\nIf we believe that the early Verrall scripts contain allusions\nto poems by Myers which Mrs. Verrall had never seen or\neven heard of, and the communicator professes to be Myers\n1\nSee, however, the Note appended to this Paper.\n\f228 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nhimself, the explanation which consists in accepting his state-\nment is so much simpler than any other, that it is likely to\ncommend itself to all but those who beg the question at issue\nby declaring survival to be a priori an impossibility ; and once\nthis was granted it would no longer be worth while to resist\nthe conclusion that the answer given in the Piper scripts of\n1907 to the Horace Ode Question had also been inspired\nfrom the same source.\nBut can we be sure that the early Verrall scripts do\nreally allude to Immortality and On a Spring Morning at Sea ?\nMy own position is that I think these poems probably\narc alluded to, but that I could wish the evidence were\nsti'onger. Judgment on this point must rest in the main on\nthe considerations set forth in a previous paper published by\nMr. Piddington in Vol. XXIV. of the Proceedings (pp. 162-169);\nand to the account there given of the internal evidence to be\nderived from the scripts themselves I have nothing to add.\nThe case, however, comes so near to affording a crucial test\nof the truth of survival, that any confirmatory evidence, slight\nthough it may be, is yet of value.\nWe have seen that a certain group of references in the\nearly Verrall scripts is subsequently utilised in the Piper\nscripts of 1907 to provide an answer to the Horace Ode\nQuestion. Xow if to this group, as contained in the early\nVerrall scripts, we are to add allusions to On a Spring\nMorning at Sea, we should naturally expect that in this\nanswer to the Horace Ode Question a corresponding allusion\nwould appear. In the Piper scripts there is no trace of it\nbut if Mr. Piddington's latest theory is sound, our expectation\nwould be equally well satisfied by finding the required allusion\nin one or more of the five Verrall scripts of 1907, which\naccording to him form a cross-correspondence with the Piper\nanswer to the question. Indeed, we should naturally look for\nit in the Verrall scripts rather than in the Piper scripts\nfor this cross-correspondence, if it be one, is in so far of the\n\" complementary \" type, that all the unfavourable previsions\nconcerning a future life are allotted to Mrs. Piper, and to\nMrs. Verrall none but favourable ones.\nMr. Piddington has given his reasons for believing that the\nVerrall Scripts 176 and 178 do actually contain references\n\flxv.] Some Observations on the Foregoing Paper. 229\nto On a Spring Morning at Sea. These reasons may not be\nconclusive, but neither can they in my opinion be summarily\nset aside. It is not certain that this poem is alluded to in\nthe early Verrall scripts ; it is not certain that it is alluded\nto in the later. But the affirmative view can be plausibly\nmaintained in both cases, and on independent grounds ; and\nwhile two uncertainties do not make a certainty, two \" fairly\nprobables \" may, and in this instance do, I think, go some\nway to corroborate each other.\nBe that as it may, the case is undeniably one which\ndeserves the serious attention of all who are interested in\nthe evidence for personal survival after bodily dissolution.\nNote.\nSince this paper was sent to the printers Mrs. F. W. H.\nMyers (to whom a proof was submitted) has called my attention\nto the possibility, or even, as she thinks, the probability, that\nthe poem Immortality and also On a Spring Morning at Sea\nwere unconsciously seen by Mrs. Verrall in the early spring\nof 1901 when helping her to arrange and sort her late husband's\npapers. Manuscript copies of On a Spring Morning at Sea were\nlying, Mrs. Myers states, in note- books on the table of the\nstudy at Leckhampton, a room which Mrs. Verrall was often\nin at that time, and in the same room were also four copies\nof the early editions containing Immortality.\nI sent Mrs. Myers's observations to Mrs. Verrall and have\nreceived from her the following reply dated from Switzerland,\nJuly 16, 1912:\nIt is possible that during my visits to Mrs. Myers in the early\nspring and summer of 1901, I may have seen, without noticing at\nthe time, books or papers that were lying about in the library at\nLeckhampton House. Such a possibility I recognised in my comments\non the allusions in my script to the Symposium incident (Proc, Vol.\nXX., p. 317, footnote) ;\nthough I feel certain that I took out no\nbooks from the shelves, and that I read no papers except such as\nwere shown to me by Mrs. Myers or given to me to sort.\nIt is thus not impossible, though I think it unlikely, that at that\ntime one or both of the poems, Immortality and On a Sjning Morning\n\f230 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [PAKT\nat Sea, came within the range of my normal knowledge, though not\nwithin my conscious observation.\nNor can it be actually proved that some knowledge of these poems\nhad not been conveyed to me at an earlier period, before the incep-\ntion of my automatic writing, at a time when I was not keeping\ncareful record\u2014as I have done since my experiments began\u2014of\nanything likely to affect the contents of my script. It is, for instance,\nimpossible for me to assert positively that neither the MSS. of the\npoems nor the printed Immortality (in the early volume) fell under\nmy observation during one of my talks with Mr. Myers in his\nlibrary.\nAll I can assert is (1) that Mr. Myers never read or quoted to\nme any unpublished poem of his, and (2) that when, upon its pub-\nlication in October, 1904, I read with great interest and close attention\nthe volume of Fragments, neither of these poems awoke in me the\nleast recollection or suggestion of previous acquaintance. To the\nbest of my belief I came across both poems for the first time in\nOctober, 1904.\nThe footnote to Proc, Vol. XX., p. 317, is as follows:\n\" The proofs of Human Personality were in Mrs. Myers's\nhouse at Cambridge where I was a frequent visitor during the\nspring and summer of 1901. It is therefore not impossible\nthat I should have seen, without consciously noticing, the direct\nreference to Diotima in the first volume or the indirect allusion\nto the Dialogue in the second volume.\"\nThis statement, published in 1906, was overlooked by me\nin preparing my paper, and the fact that the two poems may\nhave come under Mrs. Verrall's eye, whether they actually\ndid so or not, does undoubtedly weaken the cogency of any\ninferences based on the contrary assumption.\nI freely recognise, therefore, that certain of the expressions\nin the present paper are stronger than I should now feel justified\nin using ; and I should have introduced some modifications into\nthe text had not the substance of what I have written been\nalready read to a meeting of the S.P.E. In the circumstances\nit seemed best to allow the text to remain unaltered, and append\nthis Note to correct any mistaken impression which might\notherwise be left in the reader's mind.\n\flxv.] A Reply to Mr. Balfour's Observations. 231\nA EEPLY TO MR. BALFOUR'S OBSERVATIONS.\nBy J. G. PIDDINGTON.\nMl:. Balfour has laid his finger on a weak spot in my\nargument : namely, the reason I gave in support of my theory\nthat Myersv intended 176 to be read in connexion with the\nHorace Ode Question. I agree that I exaggerated the odds\nagainst the chance of this particular script proving relevant\nas an answer to the Horace Ode Question. I propose\naccordingly to substitute the following argument for the one\noffered on pp. 202-203 :\u2014\nMrs. Verrall's subconscious thoughts may be presumed to\nhave been occupied with the Horace Ode Question between\nJanuary 1, 1907, when she first formulated it, and June 2,\n1907, when Mrs. Piper's sittings came to an end. During\nthat period Mrs. Verrall wrote 57 scripts. Four of them (140,\n171, 176 and 178) I claim as relating exclusively ; three of them\n(136, 141 1\nand 174) as relating partly to the Horace Ode Question.'2\nIt was apparent to me when indexing and collating Mrs.\nVerrall's scripts in 1910 and 1911 that these seven scripts\nare linked together by various devices, such as catch-words,\ncross-references, similar quotations or phrases. But though\nthese superficial coincidences were then known to me, and\nthough I was fully alive to the fact that coincidences of this\nkind usually betoken the existence in the scripts so linked\nof some deeper underlying meaning, I had no inkling of what\nthis deeper meaning might be. To discover it a clue was\nneeded. The clue had been there all the time\u2014by which I\n1\n1 have not hitherto claimed. 141 as belonging to the Horace Ode Question\ngroup of scripts ;\nbut, as will appear later, a suggestion of Mr. Balfour's has\nnow led me to do so.\n2\n1 say \"partly,\" because I regard 136, 141 and 174 as relating also to the\navro% ovpavos &Kvfj.wv topic. I make no mention here of 180, because it was not\nwritten until June 24, 1907, and so does not fall within the period in\nquestion.\n\f232 J. G. Piddington. [part\nmean the connexion established by Mrs. Verrall's experiment\nbetween the \" Archytas \" Ode and 176\u2014but until January\n1912 it was overlooked. When once it was perceived, the\nproblem was solved. Now, though it cannot be said that the\nclue was attached to one of the seven scripts, it can be said\nthat one of the seven scripts was attached to the clue. The\nodds against this being accidental are not so great as I\nrepresented them to be on p. 203, but they are still not\nnegligible.\nBut even had they been as great as I previously represented\nthem to be, there would still have been something wanting to\nmake the evidence for design completely satisfactory. The\nwant would have been met by a statement or hint in 176 to\nthe effect that this script had reference to the Horace Ode\nQuestion ; and had there been besides a hint that this script\nwas meant as a counterpart to the answers to the Horace\nOde Question given in Mrs. Piper's trance, it would have\nbeen better still. But no such statements or hints appear in\n176 or in the scripts allied with it ; and so we must content\nourselves with the presumptive evidence to be derived from\nthe coincidence that 176 was written immediately after Mrs.\nVerrall had been fixing her thoughts on the \" Archytas \" Ode.\nNevertheless, although 176 contains no statement indicating a\nconnexion between itself and the Horace Ode Question, 174\nand 176 do contain statements which indicate that 174, 176 and\n178 have to do with a special experiment, and that this\nexperiment involves the answering of some question. The\nrelevant passages are as follows\nI want you to try a special experiment. On May 13 wait for a\nmessage, I cannot tell how it will reach you\u2014but there is some\nspecial interest in that day. Tell Helen too\u2014she might help.\nDon't ask more\u2014a veil is best\u2014but in the end you will understand\nand find the record complete. (174.)\nMay 13 thirteen has been given you for a date.\nTell Helen to try for the answer then\u2014and after that you shld\n[sic] write no more till we give the word. (176.)\nAs she wrote no script between March 18 and May 26,\n1907, we can leave out of account the references to Miss\n\fLXV.] A Reply to Mr. Balfour's Observations. 233\nHelen Verrall, except iu so far as they suggest that \" the\nanswer \" is to be given partly through one automatist and\npartly through another : in other words, by means of a cross-\ncorrespondence.\nObviously part of \" the answer \" is to be given in Mrs.\nVerrall's script on May 13, 1907 : the date of 178. But it\nis not necessary to conclude that 178, the script of May 13,\n1907, is to be the only script of Mrs. Verrall's to convey\nthis answer. It seems legitimate to assume that any script\nof hers between which and 178 a connexion can be clearly\nestablished may contribute to it.\nCertain facts which I am about to cite create a fairly\nstrong presumption that the \" special experiment \" requiring\nan answer had reference either to the avros ovpavog a\/cu\/uLwv\nQuestion or to the Horace Ode Question, and more probably\nto the latter than to the former.\nTwo test-questions formed the subject of two experiments\nduring the Piper sittings of 1906-1907. Both had been\nformulated by Mrs. Verrall, and were put to MyersP at her\ninstance: the Horace Ode Question on Jan. 23, and the\navros ovpavos aKv\/mwv Question on Jan. 29, 1907. By\nMarch 13, 1907, MyersP had shown knowledge of the\nassociations of uvtos ovpavos aKvfj.wv with In Memoriam and with\nMyers's poem To Tennyson, and had given a satisfactory para-\nphrase of the three Greek words. But he had not named the\nauthor of them, Plotinus. Accordingly, Mrs. Verrall had sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper on April 29 and 30, 1907, and explained to\nMyeiSp that though, so far as it went, his answer to the au-o?\novpavos ukv\/jlwv question was clear and satisfactory, he had not\ngiven the author's name. She also wished that MyersP would\ndisplay knowledge of the fact that a translation of the three\nGreek words occurs in Human Personality : but did not actually\nexpress her wish to him. Without going into details\u2014which\nare fully given in Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 130-136 and 157-168\n\u2014-I may say that by the afternoon of May 6, 1907, Mrs. Verrall\nknew that MyersP had satisfied her on both points : he had\nalluded to Human Personality and given the name Plotinus.\nISTow, since these were admittedly the only associations wanting\nto round off and complete the answer of MyersP, and as Myersv\nhad completed his answer as far back as March 11, 1907\n\f234 J. G. Piddington. [part\n{id. ib., p. 116), it seems justifiable to assume that by the after-\nnoon of May 6, 1907, Mrs. Verrall's immediate interest in\nthe au-ro? oupavos ukv\/j.wv experiment ceased.\nBut not so her interest in the other test-question, the Horace\nOde Question. In this her interest was still alive, for so far\n(or so, at least, she thought) MyersP had given no satisfactory\nanswer to it.\nThe Horace Ode Question was first put to MyersP on Jan. 23,\n1907. MyerSp gave his first answer to it\n1\non April 17, 1907;\nbut Mrs. Verrall was told nothing about it, nor had she even\nbeen told that the question had ever been asked at all.\nWhen Mrs. Verrall had her sitting with Mrs. Piper on\nApril 29, 1907, MyersP spontaneously referred to the subject\nof the Horace Ode Question. So completely, however, had the\nmatter passed out of Mrs. Verrall's mind, that she did not\nunderstand the reference.2\nAfter the sitting she recalled the\nmatter, and at the sitting next day, April 30, she herself\nput the Horace Ode Question to MyersP, and asked for\nan answer. Then on May 4, she heard from Mrs. Sidgwick\nabout the Aht Vogler quotation, and thought it might have been\nmeant to identify the \"Archytas\" Ode. But in view of the fact\nthat the Alt Vogler quotation had been given disconnectedly and\nwithout reference to the Horace Ode Question, she decided on\nMay 7, 1907, before trying for script, to fix her mind on the\n\" Archytas \" Ode : her idea being that, if MyersP had really\nmeant the Aht Vogler quotation to be connected with the Horace\nOde, she might thereby help him to establish the connexion\nclearly.\nSo it appears that while Mrs. Verrall's immediate normal\ninterest in the avro? ovpavos (akv\/jloov Question ceased on the\nafternoon of May 6, her normal interest in the Horace Ode\nQuestion continued at least until May 7, 1907, and possibly\nlonger.\n1\nMrs. Sidgwick and myself were the only people who knew of this answer\nand to both of us it seemed to be meaningless.\n2\nIt is perhaps not without significance that Myersp spontaneously mentioned\nthe Horace Ode Question to Mrs. Verrall at the sitting of April 29, for, an hour\nor so before the sitting began, 171 \u2014 a certain Myersv script\u2014had been written ;\nand 171 is the first script after 141 (written on Feb. 25, 1907) which, according\nto my interpretation at least, has any relevance to the Horace Ode Question.\n\flxv.] A Reply to Mr. Balfour's Observations. 235\nAlthough it does not, of course, necessarily follow that, because\nMrs. Verrall ceased on May 6 to be preoccupied in her normal\nstate with the Plotinian Question, the consciousness concerned\nin the production of her scripts followed suit ; still it does\nseem likely that the \" script \" consciousness should, like\nthe normal consciousness, occupy itself with the incomplete\nrather than with the completed experiment. That in fact\nit did so, is rendered probable by a comparison of the\nscripts wi'itten while Mrs. Verrall was normally interested in\nboth test-questions with the scripts written while she was\ninterested in the Horace Ode Question only. The former,\nI hope to show, reflect both interests : the latter make far\nbetter sense if interpreted as answers to the Horace Ode\nQuestion, than they would, if interpreted as reverberations of\nthe Plotinian topic.\nIn the course of producing the evidence on which I base\nthese statements, I shall at the same time deal with an objec-\ntion raised by Mr. Balfour. This objection may be formulated\nas follows :\n\u2014There being no hint in those Verrall scripts which\nI have connected with the Horace Ode Question of such a con-\nnexion having been intended, it may be urged that all the scripts\nreally belong to the series of avros ovpavos ctKUjuun' scripts, with\nwhich they show certain analogies and among which they would\nfind an appropriate place. That as a matter of fact I have\nincluded one script, 136, in the Horace Ode series, which I had\npreviously included in the avrog ovpavos aKv\/uwp series ; and\nthat, to be consistent, I ought to have included another avro?\novpcwos cIkv\/uloov script, that of Feb. 25, 1907. These two\nscripts, it is true, may possibly have been intended to belong\nto both series, but such a hypothesis must be received with\ncaution.\nAs it may perhaps be a help to the reader, I will state in\nadvance what form my answers to the points raised by Mr.\nBalfour will take. I shall maintain\n(1) that the script of Feb. 25, 1907 (which I shall in\nfuture refer to as 141) does belong, and should therefore\nbe added, to the group of scripts\u2014136, 140, 171, 174, 176,\n178 and 180\u2014which I have already connected with the\nHorace Ode Question ;\n(2) that out of this group\u2014as now enlarged by the addition\n\f236 J. G. Pidclington. [part\nof 141 \u2014136, 141 and 174 relate to the avros ovpavos\naicvfxwv Question as well as to the Horace Ode\nQuestion ;\n(3) that references to both topics were combined in 136 and 141,\nbecause for Myersv the two topics were closely inter-\nwoven, as they had been in the mind of Frederic\nMyers ; and\n(4) that if 140, 171, 176, 178 and 180 are referred, as Mr.\nBalfour suggests they might be, to the avros ovpavos\naKviJ.wv topic, they contribute nothing of any importance\nwhile if they are referred to the Horace Ode Question\nthey contribute an intelligent and appropriate answer\nthereto.\nLet us begin by considering 141, the script which I formerly\nconnected with the Plotinian Question and am now prepared\nto connect as well with the Horatian Question.

She did not, how-\never, recognise the source of the motto, from which the important word sine\nhad been accidentally omitted, until a year or two later, perhaps in 1905. It\nis conceivable that in 1905, or at some time previous to the dates of 141 and\n174, the motto affixed to the poem in the MS. copy reminded her of the passage\nin Myers's Presidential Address into which the same motto is introduced ; and\nthat this may explain the connexion of 141 (which seems to reflect the passage\nin the Address) with 174 and the other \" Venice\" scripts.

Let us\nnow compare them with the earlier references to this topic in\nMrs. VerraU's script : that is to say, with the references\nwhich began on February 12 and ended on March 11, 1907\n(see Proc, Vol. XXIL, pp. 112-118).1\nThe script of February 12, 19 0 7 (136) quoted the lines\nfrom Tennyson's Morte <VArthur descriptive of the calm of the\nisland-valley of Avilion. This was followed on Feb. 25, 1907\n(141) by the quotation from Tennyson's Lucretius descriptive of\nthe \" sacred everlasting calm \" of the gods. This again was\nfollowed on March 6, 1907, by a quotation from Section xi.\nof Tennyson's In Memoriarn :\n\" Calm is the sea\u2014and in my\nheart if calm at all, if any calm, a calm despair \" : and to it\nthis comment was appended :\n\" That is only part of the\nanswer\u2014just as it is not the final thought.

Starting from Tennysonian\npassages descriptive of nature at peace (the Mortv d'Arthur and\nLucretius passages) the scribe had led up to a passage (In\nMemoriarn xi. and XII.) where a trance, occurring under some,\nthough not all, of the conditions laid down by Plotinus as\nessential to communion with the Divine, brings no assurance\nof reality;\n2\nand then had indicated that In Memoriarn contains\nanother passage which would be found to harmonize more\nclosely with the context of avro? ovpavos a.Kv\/u.a>v.

On the other hand, the passages in 171, 174, 176, 178 and\n180, which, for argument's sake, we are assuming to be connected\nwith the avros ovpavos UKVjuwv topic, either merely reproduce\nillustrations of nature at peace given in earlier scripts (e.g. the\nquotation from Lucretius in 174), or merely accumulate fresh\nillustrations of the same topic (e.g. the \" Elysian quiet\" of\nAVordsworth's Peek Castle, of the Heavenly Jerusalem, of On\na Spring Morning at Sea and Venice) which, not being associated\nin any way with ecstacy, have no particular point ; or allude\nto a vision, that of John in Revelation, which presents no\nanalogy, as do the trances of In Memoriam xn. and xcv., to\nthe Vision of Plotinus. Kegarded, then, as contributions to\nthe cwto? ohpavos aKupiwv topic, I must pronounce these passages\nto be either vain repetitions, or inappropriate or otiose rever-\nberations, and as falling very far below the standard of the\nearlier references.\nA priori it would not be surprising to find pointless repe-\ntitions and stale rehashes in automatic script or speech ; and\nin fact they are not uncommon features of Mrs. Piper's trances.\nIn Mrs. Verrall's case repetitions and reverberations are plentiful\nenough ; but the longer I study her script, the more clearly\nhave I come to realise that they are rarely otiose.

While the lower is concerned with the things of\nsense, with the higher we may see God, even while in the\nbody, if freed for a moment from the tumult of the sensuous\nworld.\nIf with upright and steadfast soul a man gaze without growing\ndizzy on that unsullied light, and look not back earthwards ; if he\nstop his ears, and turn his sight and all his other senses inwards\nupon himself ;\nif, utterly unheeding of earthly cares and afflictions,\nof pleasures and honours, of glory and infamy, he let himself be led\nby true reason and steadfast love . . . then, as he goes thitherwards\nand leaves the world behind him, always that which is in front of\nhim shall grow clear and brilliant, preluding, as it were, the Godhead.\nSo, as he travels on, he shall hear the Godhead, and, the journey\ndone, shall behold it face to face.\nYet his journey's goal is not the firmament of heaven, nor such\nbodies as are therein, . . . but he must pass beyond these, and\noverstep the firmament 1\nuntil he reach the real goal and its perfect\ncalm,\n\"Where neither is great winter-storm, nor is it ever wet\nwith rain ; but most clear air is spread about it cloudless, 1\nand\nthe white light floats upon it ;\nand where no fleshly affection, such as vexes the wretched soul here\nbelow, can trouble the vision. 2\n(Dissertationes, xvn. 10-11.)\nIn this passage Maximus combines Odyssey, iv. 566 and VI.\n43-45 in a curious and unmetrical manner, quoting neither\ncorrectly, as the following comparison will show\n1\nCompare the paraphrase given in Mrs. Piper's trance of the words avros\nvrpavos a.KU\/j.wi' : \"Cloudless *ky beyond the horizon\" (Proc, Vol. XXII., p. 12(5).\n'-'The above is a close paraphrase, but does not profess to be a literal\ntranslation.\n\flxv.] Two Tennysonian Quotations. 247\nHomer.

On\npages 421-423 of this book Dill, in the course of giving some\naccount of the philosophy of Maximus, paraphrases concisely\nvarious passages in Dissertationes, IV., VIII., x., XVI., and XVII.\nThe particular passage in Dissertationes, xvn., with which we\nare concerned, he paraphrases thus :\nIt is by this higher faculty that God is seen, so far as He may be,\nin this mixed and imperfect state.

Accordingly I wrote and asked her\nwithout, however, explaining the reason for my question\nwhether she had read Dill's Roman Society from Nero to Marcus\nAurelius.\nShe wrote in reply on Nov. 5, 1910, as follows:\nI have never read Dill's Roman Society, etc., nor seen the book\nthough of course I know of its existence, and have probably read\nreviews.\nI cannot, of course, pretend to prove that the passage quoted\nabove has not been reproduced in some review of Dill's book ;\nbut a passage of this kind, half summary and half paraphrase,\nis not at all a likely one to be selected by a reviewer for\nquotation.\nI next wrote and asked Mrs. Verrall\u2014again without explain-\ning why I wanted the information\u2014whether she had ever read\nthe Dissertationes of Maximus of Tyre. Her reply, dated Nov. 7,\n1910, was a large and emphatically underlined \"No.\"'\nHere again it is impossible, of course, to exclude the possi-\nbility of Mrs. Verrall's having come across Dissertationes, xvu.,\nin an \" Unseen Translation \" paper, or in some such way ; but\nto those who know the kind of passages selected for \" Unseen\n\fLXV.] Two Tennysonian Quotations. 249\nTranslation \" at the Universities, and who are good enough\nGrecians to appreciate how crabbed the style of Maximus is\nin this passage\u2014if, indeed, the text is not corrupt\u2014this\npossibility will appear to be remote.\nHaving learnt that Mrs. Verrall had read neither Dill's book\nnor the Dissertationes, it occurred to me to inquire whether\nFrederic Myers had been acquainted with the writings of\nMaximus of Tyre. I accordingly searched through Myers's\nbooks, and found the following reference to the Dissertationes\nin his Essay on Greek Oracles {Essays Classical, p. 60) :\nAlexander himself consulted Zeus Amnion not only on his own\nparentage but as to the sources of the Nile, and an ingenuous author\nregrets that, instead of seeking information on this purely geographical\nproblem, . . .

And he may\nwell have been familiar with them, for, as is well known and\nas his writings bear witness, he was deeply read in Neoplatonic\nliterature, and Maximus of Tyre was a 2nd century precursor\nof the Neoplatonists of the 3rd century.\nMoreover, Myers's study of the Daemon of Socrates (see\nProc, Vol. V., pp. 538-543, and Human Personality, Vol. II.,\npp. 95-100) is likely to have sent him to the Dissertationes\nof Maximus, since they are one of the sources of information\non this subject (see Dissertationes, xiv. and XV.).2\nIn Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 16-19, I have given a list\nof nine instances of what I have called \" literary personation\n\"\nof Frederic Myers by Myersv ,\nMyersHV, and MyersP.\nThese instances, however, with the probable exception of\nthe eighth, are not on all fours with the apparent knowledge\n1\n\" Diss. 25\" = Diss. xli. in Diibner's edition: the edition to which I have\ngiven references.\nZ\nL.

The author, who was, as he tells us on p. 28, led to the\ninvestigation of telepathy by perusal of Phantasms of the Living, found\nthat the results of his own observations did not agree with those\narrived at in that work. In his opinion this is probably due to\nwant of intimate acquaintance by the authors of Phantasms of the\nLiving with the psychological conditions affecting their percipients ;\nbut examination seems to us to show that it is chiefly due to the\nfact that his own observations concern a different order of phenomena\nfrom that with which he compares them.\nM. Vaschide made his observations on the experiences of thirty-\nfour persons\u2014friends or colleagues of his own, or persons with whom\nhe was intimately as-ociated\u2014twenty-one of whom were Roumanian\nand thirteen French men or women. During periods varying for\ndifferent persons from six months to nine years, the average period\nbeing between four and five years, he noted down at the time of its\noccurrence every \" telepathic hallucination \" experienced by those\npersons which came to his notice, and compared them with the contem-\nporaneous condition of the supposed agent. He thus noted 1374 experi-\nences ! This gives an average of over forty per head. Only one person\nhad as few as two such experiences, and this person was observed for\nfour years. On the other hand, one person had 100 experiences in the\ntwo years during which he was observed, or on an average nearly\none a week; and another person, a woman, had 172 experiences\n\f252 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nnoted by M. Vaschide in the course of five years. These figures are\ncertainly startling. It appears, however, that M. Vaschide merely\nmeans by \"hallucinations telepathiques \" an experience having some\nsort of sensory quality, and suggesting in some way to the percipient\na definite person at a distance. He does not regard the term tele-\npathic as implying that any communication otherwise than through\nthe ordinary channels of sense actually occurred between agent and\npercipient. This is clear, because in only forty-eight of the 1374\ncases did he find any real coincidence between the \" hallucination\n\"\nand the condition of the agent, counting as a coincidence a certain\namount of agreement between the state of the agent and the impression\nof the percipient within a period of from six to sixty hours. 1\nIt is\nan interesting fact, however, that in 1325 of the 1374 cases the\npercipients believed, presumably at the time of the experience, that\nit was veridical ; and we are left to infer that for the most part\ntheir confidence was not disturbed by subsequent discovery that the\ncoincidence was inadequate. Some explanation could always be\nfound\u2014some adaptation of recollections on comparing notes with\nthe agent. The possibility of such persistent though misplaced\nconfidence is not surprising to the psychical researcher; what is\nnew is the scale on which with M. Vaschide's subjects it actually\noccurred. This is probably due to an uncritical habit of mind\ninduced by the social milieu in which the percipients lived, in which\none gathers that belief in the frequency of a kind of second sight\nwas very general.\nQuite apart from questions of veridicality, however, M. Vaschide's\nnumbers would be very surprising\u2014indeed almost incredible, as his\npercipients are apparently ordinary sane and healthy people\u2014if he\nmeant the same thing by \" hallucination \" as is meant in Phantasms\nof the Living and in the Proceedings of the S.P.R. generally. From\nthe specimens he gives us in detail, however, it would appear that\nhis \"hallucinations\" are not those fully externalised hallucinations\nhallucinatory percepts which lack, but can only by distinct reflection\nbe recognised as lacking, the objective basis which they suggest\nwhich have been the subject of statistical investigation by the S.P.R.\nThey seem, on the contrary, to be the phenomena called in our\nCensus of Hallucinations (after Kandinsky) pseudo-hallucinations.\nThese appear to the percipient to be seen with the eye of the mind,\nnot the bodily eye; to be heard with the mental, not the bodily,\near.

Vaschide, and it is even possible that he never came\nacross a case of really externalised hallucination, at least of a visual\nsort.\nM. Vaschide gives interesting classifications of the content of the\nimpressions, but describes only four \"hallucinations visuelles\" speci-\nfically\u2014one experienced by a Madame N. and three by himself.\nMadame N.'s impression, which occurred while she was at supper,\nwas like a clear vision of her daughter dying (comme la vision claire\nde sa fille mourante) wrapped in white sheets and on the point of\nyielding her last breath. Madame N. was in some anxiety about\nher daughter, but did not know that she was ill with typhoid fever\nand that fifteen hours earlier she had gone through the crisis of the\nillness. The experiences of Monsieur Vaschide himself which he\ndescribes were connected with the death of his father, who was\nseventy-three years of age and ill, and about whom his son was feeling\nanxious. Coming in with his wife, the latter remarked that she had\nan impression of the smell of quinces 1\n\u2014a smell which she recognised\nas characteristic of his father's house, distant three days' railway\njourney. Thereupon he saw his father dying (a ce rappel j'ai vu\nmon pere mourant). As he learnt afterwards, his father had died\nseven hours earlier. The day before he had had \" une hallucination\nvague de son regard bleu et doux,\" and on the evening of his death\n\u2014perhaps while he was dying\u2014he had had a \"hallucination\" of his\nstate (j'avais eu hallucination de son etat). He saw him as he had\nleft him, with his habitual expression and gestures, and he seemed\nto have greatly changed.\nAny one who takes the trouble to compare these experiences, the\nonly visual ones described in detail by M. Vaschide, with Mrs.\nBettany's case described in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I. Chap. v.\n\u00a7 3, or with those given in Chap. vi. \u00a7 5 of the same volume, or with\nChap. iv. of the \" Census of Hallucinations,\" S.P.R. Proceedings,\nVol. X., will, we think, agree with us that they should be classified\nas pseudo-hallucinations. Such experiences may be very impressive,\nbut may easily be the reverse and, like dreams, easily forgotten. 2\nOlfactory impressions were unexpectedly frequent among the \"hallucina-\ntions telepathiques \" noted by M. \"Vaschide, more so than tactile impressions.\nHe recorded seventy-four, he tells us.\n2\nThe distinction between hallucinations and pseudo-hallucinations is not of\ncourse in vividness or impressiveness. Some of the pseudo-hallucinations described\nin the chapters of Phantasms and of the \"Census\" referred to above were very\nvivid and impressive. On the other hand, the colourless and somewhat\nformless figures seen by Dr. Henry Head's patients when suffering from\n\f254 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThey are not experiences to which we have attempted to apply any\nstatistical method of investigation, and there is, therefore, nothing in\nthe publications of the Society with which M. Vaschide's results are\nexactly comparable. This is indeed the reason why his results are\nnew and interesting. He has had an opportunity of observing, at\nthe time of their occurrence, evanescent phenomena, the frequency\nof which in any circle it would be otherwise impossible to ascertain,\nand of showing how little the impression of the percipients in his\ncircle that they are veridical is warranted. It is only to be re-\ngretted that he has not given a fuller account of his observations,\nand especially particulars of more of the actual experiences.\nThe 1374 experiences noted by M. Vaschide consisted of 962\nvisual, 298 auditory, 74 olfactory, and 40 tactile cases. 1\nThe per-\ncentage of what he counts as coincidental cases as defined above\nwas 3\n-\n49. He gives rather more particulars about the Roumanian\nresults. The total of these was 1011 with forty coincidences (3 96 per\ncent.), of which in nineteen cases the percipient's experience preceded\nand in twenty-one followed the corresponding event in the agent's life.\nThere were 740 visual cases among the Roumanian ones, of which\ntwenty-one (2-84 per cent.) are counted by M. Vaschide as coin-\ncidental. M. Vaschide is sceptical about the applicability of a mathe-\nmatical calculation of chances to any real facts so far as I understand\nhim, and at any rate to psychological facts. And certainly it is difficult\nto see how it could be applied to his figures in the absence of any\ndefinition of the event in the asrent's life with which coincidence is\nto be counted, or knowledge of the frequency of that event.\nHowever, without calculation he expresses confidence (p. 81) that the\ncoincidences he has observed exceed what chance alone would give\n(la veracite de ces 48 cas de coincidences . . . montre suffisament qu'elles\nvisceral disease (see Mr. Piddington's discussion of Dr. Head's Goulstonian\nLectures, Proceedings, Vol. XIX., pp. \"267-341) must in themselves have been unim-\npressive. Nevertheless these last were truly externalised hallucinations, as\nvarious things indicate. Thus, for instance, some patients before admission to the\nhospital sprang out of bed to seize the figure standing near their beds, which\nthey supposed to be a person who had entered the room (p. 291). This would\nnot happen with a vision seen with the mind's eye only.\n1\nM. Vaschide very rarely found in the cases observed by him that two\nsenses appeared to be concerned simultaneously or nearly so (p. 54). This is\nprobably due to their being pseudo-hallucinations. In the externalised and\ntherefore more realistic experiences dealt with in our \" Census of Hallucina-\ntions \" about 14 per cent, are reported as affecting simultaneously two or more\nsenses.\n\flxv.] Revieiv. 255\ndepassent la probability). He gives us no means of forming an inde-\npendent judgment on this conclusion, but it is not necessary that\nwe should do so, as he practically withdraws it two pages further\non, where he says that he does not regard the proportion ot\nveridical cases as a chance, but as an accidental coincidence easily\nexplicable (cette proportion des cas veridiques nous ne la considerons\npas comme un hasard ; c'est une coincidence fortuite facilement\ninterpretable). The explanation is a little obscure, but seems to be\nthat all \" telepathic hallucinations \" in M. Vaschide's sense depend\non a special mental state of the percipient\u2014chiefly of emotional\nsympathy with the agent apparently\u2014and that in most veridical\ncases there is a kind of pre-established intellectual harmony (harmonie\nintellectuelle preetablie) (p. 95 ; see also p. 73). At any rate the\nemotional condition of the percipient seems a sufficient explanation\nof the form of the impression in the cases described by M. Vaschide,\nand no one we imagine would be inclined to found a theory of\ntelepathy on them.\nIt would be interesting to know to what extent M. Vaschide has\nreally studied the work of the S.P.K. He claims acquaintance with\nthe French (abbreviated) translation of Phantasms of the Living, and\nhas seen summaries of the papers on our \" Census of Hallucinations\n\"\n(Proceedings, Vol. X.) read at the Psychological Congress held at\nMunich in 1896. But his use of the terminology of Phantasms of\nthe Living in a new sense and without explanation while criticising\nthat work, his failure to distinguish between hallucinations and\npseudo-hallucinations, his impression that information was accepted\nby the authors of Phantasms from anonymous persons (p. 70), and\neven that the inquiry was carried on through newspapers (p. 71),\nas well as other errors, suggest a very superficial reading. We\ncannot regard his book as affording useful criticism either of the\nmethods or the results of the investigations of our Society ; but his\nown investigation is, as already said, interesting and useful, and\nshould not be lost sight of.

W. Mitchell, M.D.\nWell-marked cases of multiple personality are rare, and if\nwe confined ourselves to the study of these cases alone we should\nmake little progress towards an understanding of the strange\nand seemingly inexplicable phenomena which they present.\nFortunately, however, these are not the only ones that occur.\nWhen we examine the records we find that a great variety of\nforms may be observed, and that there are many gradations\nbetween the well-marked cases and those which can hardly be\nlooked upon as examples of multiple personality at all. An\nexamination of some of these latter conditions will provide the\nbest introduction to the study of the complex phenomena of\ndouble and multiple personality.\nIt is now very generally admitted by psychologists that in\nsome persons at least consciousness may be split up into two\nor more parts. The split-off or dissociated portion may be but\na fragment of the whole self, or it may be so extensive, so\nR\n\f258 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ncomplex, and so self-sufficient as to be capable of fulfilling all\nthe functions of a personal consciousness. In hysteria we find\nisolated paralyses or localized anaesthesias which are due to\nthe dissociation of relatively simple ideas, or we may find a\nsplitting so deep, a dissociation of so many kinds of mental\nactivity, that it leads to a complete change of personality.\nAll ideas, feelings, and actions associated in experience tend\nto become linked together into systems or groups in such a way\nthat the stimulation of one element of a group excites the\nactivity of all the rest. Such a system or group is commonly\nreferred to as a complex. Now just as dissociation may fall\nupon a relatively simple idea, such as the use of a limb, so\nit may fall upon a complex of ideas related to some particular\nexperience. A complex formed in relation to some event accom-\npanied by great emotion may become dissociated from the\npersonal consciousness, so that all recollection of the event\nand of the feelings and actions connected with it becomes\nimpossible. A complex so dissociated does not cease to be\ncapable of functioning. For the time being it may become\nlatent, but it may occasionally exhibit extremely independent\nactivity. A case recorded by Professor Janet 1\nwell illustrates\nthe results of the functioning of such dissociated complexes.\nA young girl nursed her dying mother. The poor woman,\nwho had reached the last stage of consumption, lived alone\nwith her daughter in a poor garret. Death came slowly with\nsuffocation, blood vomiting, and all its frightful procession of\nsymptoms. The girl struggled hopelessly against the impossible.\nShe watched her mother during sixty nights, working at her\nsewing-machine to earn a few pennies necessary to sustain their\nlives. After the mother's death she tried to revive the corpse, to\ncall the breath back again ; then as she put the limbs upright\nthe body fell to the floor, and it took infinite exertion to lift\nit up again into the bed. Some time after the funeral the\nyoung girl began to fall into somnambulic attacks in which\nshe acted again all the events that took place at her mother's\ndeath, without forgetting the least detail.\nOne of the characteristics of these recurrent psychomotor\nstates or somnambulisms, as Janet calls them, is that they\nrepeat themselves indefinitely. Not only are the attacks always\n1\nThe Major Symptoms of Hysteria, p. '29.\n\flxvi.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 259\nexactly alike, repeating the same movements, expressions and\nwords, but in the course of the same attack the same scene\nmay be repeated many times exactly in the same way. The\npatient acts out some past experience as if in a dream, and\nduring the attack the senses are shut to all impressions not\nconnected with the dream. He perceives nothing except the\nidea he is possessed of, and he remembers nothing except that\none idea. When the attack is over there is a return of all\nsensations, the lost memories of waking life are restored, and\nthe events of the dream are forgotten. This loss of memory\nbears not only on the period of the somnambulism ; it bears\nalso on the event that has given birth to the somnambulism,\non all the facts that are connected with it, and on the feelings\nthat are related to it. Thus the young girl referred to forgot\nduring her waking state all the events connected with her\nmother's illness and death. She was callous and insensible,\nand her filial love, the feeling of affection she had felt for\nher mother, seemed to have quite vanished.\nMany separate experiences may have taken part in the\nformation of a dissociated complex, but they are all bound\ntogether by some common element of feeling or emotion.\nWhen these experiences are reproduced in somnambulic attacks,\nthe various episodes are enacted in succession, though not\nalways in the same order, and the reproduction may or may\nnot be modified by perception and association of ideas. When\nthe reproduction is not modified by external impressions, the\nattacks are very similar to those already described. But if\nability to perceive surrounding objects be retained, the regular\ndevelopment of the somnambulism may be interfered with and\nmodified by the performance of actions determined by the\nactual situation. In other cases still further modifications may\nbe introduced by association of ideas. When dissociation bears\nupon any large section of mental life, the interlinking of the\nvarious dissociated complexes may afford material for the deter-\nmination of a great variety of somnambulic acts. In illustration\nof this we may refer to the case of the old soldier recorded by\nMesnet. This man had received a gunshot wound in the\nhead and was afterwards subject to attacks of somnambulism\nin which he gave an exact repetition of events of his life\nwhen in hospital. But when a pen was put into his hand\n\f2G0 T. W. Mitchell, M.J). [part\nduring the somnambulic state, he would write letters having\nreference to other periods of his life. He could hear nothing\nin this state, but if ideas were suggested to him through the\nsense of touch, he would perform appropriate actions which\nwere determined by old memories.\nIn all these cases conduct consists mainly of repetitions of\nactions appropriate to past events in the patient's history,\nand it is not relevant to his actual circumstances during the\nsomnambulism. When the dissociation is of such a nature as\nto permit a just appreciation of the surroundings during the\nsecondary state, and ability to react in an appropriate manner,\nthere is a tendency for the state to be prolonged and to be\nfilled up by a course of conduct in which are displayed the\npurpose and contingency which we usually regard as character-\nistic of waking life. Attacks of this kind usually take the\nform of fugues or ambulatory automatisms and are generally\ndescribed as such ; but the change of character which is\nsometimes exhibited during the secondary state, and the amnesia\nfor the events of the fugue which ensues when the normal\nstate is restored, justify us in regarding them as genuine\ninstances of double personality.\nProlonged fugues appear to be generally of hysterical origin,\nbut shorter periods of intelligent conduct followed by amnesia\nare frequently met with as a result of a variety of causes.\nHead injuries, profound emotional shock, carbon monoxide poison-\ning, alcoholic intoxication, epileptic attacks, and other conditions,\nmay so affect consciousness that acts performed during hours or\ndays subsequent to the trauma are completely forgotten when\nrecovery of normal health occurs. But the lost memories are not\ndestroyed ;\nthey are merely dissociated ; and by using various\nartificial measures, such as hypnotism or hypnoidization, they\ncan be restored, and an account of what happened during the\nabnormal state may be obtained.\nFugues are of not infrequent occurrence, and many of the\ncases of loss of memory reported from time to time in the\nnewspapers are undoubtedly of this character. These people\nhave lost for the time being the memory of their real personality.\nSome system of thoughts which determines their wandering has\nbecome dissociated from the personal consciousness. As is the\ntendency of all dissociated ideas, this system of thoughts takes\n\flxvi.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 261\non independent functioning, and when it is working itself out\nin action, the other systems of thoughts relating to the per-\nsonality, to the former life and its responsibilities, become\nlatent. The whole personality is no longer in control of con-\nduct. When through some chance association or through\nartificial means the memory of the former existence is restored,\nthe lately active complex becomes latent again, and the events\nassociated with its recent activity are forgotten.\nThe principal characteristics of a fugue are well brought\nout in the following case, which I quote from Professor Janet\nThe subject is a boy of seventeen, Rou., son of a neuropathic\nmother, rather nervous himself, who already had, when he was ten\nyears old, tics and contractures in the neck. ... At thirteen he often\nwent to a small public-house, visited by old sailors. They would\nurge him to drink, and, when he was somewhat flustered, they\nwould fill his imagination with beautiful tales in which deserts,\npalm trees, lions, camels, and negroes were pictured in a most\nwonderful and alluring way. The young boy was very much struck\nby those pictures, particularly as he was half tipsy. However,\nwhen his drunkenness was over, the stories seemed to be quite\nforgotten ; he never spoke of travels, and on the contrary led a\nvery sedentary life, for he had chosen the placid occupation of a\ngrocer's boy, and he only sought to rise in that honourable career.\nNow there came on quite unforeseen accidents, almost always on\nthe occasion of some fatigue or a fit of drunkenness. He then felt\ntransformed, forgot to return home, and thought no more of his\nfamily. ... I will dwell on only one of his fugues, which is\nparticularly amusing, and was of extraordinary duration, for it\nlasted three months. He had left Paris about the fifteenth of May,\nand had walked to the neighbourhood of Melun. This time he was\nthinking about the means of succeeding in his scheme and of\ngetting safely to the Mediterranean. Until then he had failed,\nowing to fatigue and misery : the question was to find means of\nliving as he went along. A bright idea had occurred to him ; not\nfar from Melun, at Moret, there are canals that go more or less\nstraight to the south of France, and in those canals there are ships\nladen with goods. He succeeded in being accepted as a servant\non a ship laden with coal. His work was terrible ; now he had\nto shovel the coal, now to haul the rope in company with a donkey\ncalled Cadet, his only friend. He was badly fed, often beaten,\n\f262 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nexhausted with fatigue, but, though you would scarcely believe it,\nhe was radiant with happiness. He thought only of one thing,\nof the joy of drawing nearer to the sea. Unhappily, in Auvergne,\nthe boat stopped, and he was forced to leave it and continue his\njourney on foot, which was more difficult. In order not to be\nresourceless, he hired himself as a helper to an old china mender.\nThey went slowly along, working on the road.\nThen, one evening, an unlooked-for event took place again. The\nday's work had been a success ; the two companions had earned\nseven francs. The old china mender stopped and said to E., \" My\nboy, we deserve a good supper : and we will keep to-day's feast\nit is the fifteenth of August.\" On hearing this, the boy heedlessly\nsaid :\n\" The fifteenth of August 1 Why, it is the feast of the\nVirgin Mary, the anniversary of my mother's name-da}'.\" He had\nscarcely uttered these words when he appeared to be quite changed.\nHe looked all round him with astonishment, and turning to his\ncompanion, said, \" But who are you, and what am I doing here\nwith you 1\n\" The poor man was amazed, and was quite unable to\nmake the boy understand the situation ; the latter still believed\nhimself in Paris, and had lost all memory of the preceding months.\nThey had to go to the village mayor's, where, with great difficulty,\nthe matter was made more or less clear. The mayor telegraphed to\nParis, and the prodigal child was sent back home. 1\nIn this case we see something of the way in which fugues\nmay originate. It is exceptional in showing so clearly how\nthe ideas and desires which determined the fugue became\nimplanted in the patient's mind, and how they became dis-\nsociated from the waking consciousness under the influence\nof alcoholic intoxication. As a rule it is not so easy to dis-\ncover how the determining ideas found an entrance into the\nmind or how they became dissociated. In some cases they\nseem to have originated in day-dreaming or in other states of\nabstraction. Sometimes they appear to be ideas or wishes\nthat have been entertained in the normal state, but have been\nvoluntarily repressed as being incompatible with the general\ncharacter and purposes of the individual.\nThe termination of this fugue is also instructive. Just as\nan attack of hysterical somnambulism may be artificially repro-\nduced by insistently directing the patient's attention towards\n'Janet, loc. cit., p. 51.\n\flxvl] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 263\nthe idea which dominates it, so a fugue may he brought to\na close by some chance impression which succeeds in arousing\nemotional complexes related to the normal life.\nIt seems impossible to draw any hard and fast line between\nfugues and some of the classical cases of double personality.\nOn the whole it may be said that the fugue is characterized\nby a tendency to wander, by a certain unity of purpose which\nlinks the dissociated ideas together, and by the persistence\nof this purpose as a directive force in determining conduct\nwhile the fugue lasts. It is true that in some fugues the\nWorking out of this purpose seems vague and obscure, and\nthe wandering may appear quite purposeless to an observer\nbut it is probable that in every fugue the conduct of the\npatient is determined by a subconscious desire for some new\nexperience or by aversion to some experience of his ordinary\nlife. There is something in his life from which he feels he\nmust fly, or some anticipated good towards which he must go.\nIn conditions which may more strictly be regarded as cases\nof double personality, conduct in the secondary state seems\nto have no such continuity of purpose running through it.\nDissociation seems to bear upon a larger section of the self,\nand the mental activity displayed is of a more varied character.\nIn some respects at least it more closely resembles the activity\nof ordinary life and seems less guided by any fixed idea. But\nwe find transitional forms where any such distinction seems\nto break down. The well-known case of Ansel Bourne 1\nmay\nperhaps come under this category. In the first fortnight of\nhis secondary state, Ansel Bourne's conduct conformed to that\nof an ordinary fugue. He forgot his personal identity, assumed\na new name, and wandered about from city to city. In the\nremaining six weeks he led a quiet, respectable life as a small\nshop-keeper. In his second state he had no recollection of\nhis former life, and when he came to himself he had no recol-\nlection of his life during the second state. The lost memories\nwere, however, recovered during hypnosis, and the revelation\nso obtained of his frame of mind at the beginning of his\nfugue probably indicates the nature of the ideas that deter-\nmined it. He said \" he wanted to get away somewhere\u2014he\ndidn't know where\u2014and have rest.\" When he opened his\n1\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., p. 221.\n\f264 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nlittle shop, the fugue proper came to an end. The idea which\ndetermined his flight was about to be realized, and while it\nwas working itself out he lived the life of a secondary per-\nsonality which was conditioned by the breach in the continuity\nof his memory, rather than by any great change in his char-\nacter or conduct.\nSo far we have considered disintegrations of personality in\nwhich the dissociated elements comprise only a small portion\nof the mental life. A single idea, or a group of ideas linked\ntogether into a complex by some common underlying feeling,\nbecomes split off more or less completely from the personpi\nconsciousness. When it is aroused to function, it displays\ngreat independence and takes possession of the whole organism.\nA new state is entered upon, a new personality appears,\nwhose actions are initiated and guided by the dominating\ncomplex.\nThe section of mental life thus cut off is relatively so small\nthat its disappearance does not appreciably affect the integrity\nof the personal consciousness, so that both before and after the\nsomnambulistic attack the individual is regarded as being his\nnormal self. But it is possible for the dissociation to bear\nupon such a large section of consciousness that the curtailment\nof the self which its withdrawal entails may amount to a\nchange of personality. And the dissociated portions of con-\nsciousness may lack the community of feeling or of purpose\nwhich would enable them to take possession of the bodily\norganism on their own account. Dissociation is revealed by\ngaps or disabilities in the normal self, rather than by the\nappearance of any new form of activity simulating a second\nself. But if the dissociated portions of consciousness should\nsuddenly become reinstated so as to lead to the formation once\nmore of the normal personality, and if again they should\ngradually or suddenly drop out of consciousness so as again\nto leave the normal self crippled and curtailed by their\ndisappearance, we should have an alternation of two selves\nwhose relation to each other might not readily be recognized.\nSome of the best known of the recorded examples of double\npersonality are to be explained in this way, and the misinter-\npretation of such cases has given unwarrantable support to\nthe view that a secondary self is sometimes an improvement\n\flxvi.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 2G5\non the primary personality. Such a view may or may not be\ntrue ; but these cases cannot be adduced in support of it.\nThe classical example of this form of double personality is\nAzam's Felida X.1\nThe condition which Azam described as\nFelida's primary state was undoubtedly the crippled or curtailed\nself produced by hysterical dissociation ; and the condition\nwhich he described as secondary was really the normal self\nrestored by the synthesis of the dissociated states. But the\nreal secondary personality in this case was, in fact, the\nhysterical condition (see diagrams on Plate II, p. 285), which had\ncome on so gradually that no distinct gap in the continuity of\nmemory was observed. When the two phases began to alter-\nnate, the curtailed self became amnesic for the restored self,\nwhile the restored self had no amnesia for the hysterical phase.\nThere is in cases of the Felida type no reciprocal amnesia\nsuch as is observed in the cases we have previously examined.\nFelida's alternations occurred spontaneously and for a long\ntime they were misinterpreted. It was only when it was\ndiscovered that similar phenomena could be artificially produced\nthat the status of the two phases and the mechanism of their\nalternation became apparent. Janet's prolonged researches on\nMarcelline I!.\n2\n\u2014an artificial Felida, as he has termed her\nafford us the clearest notion of the way in which double\npersonalities of this kind come into being, but we do not seem\njustified in adopting Janet's view that this is the type to which\nall forms of multiple personality must in the last analysis be\nheld to conform.\nIn cases of the Felida type I have supposed that the split-\noff section of consciousness has not the structural unity which\nwould permit it to manifest as a secondary personality, and\nthat the two selves which are exhibited are merely the normal\nself and the same self shorn of some of its faculties or powers.\nBut it is possible for a split-off section of consciousness, even\nwhen dissociation is extensive, to have so much structural unity\nthat it is capable of utilizing the whole bodily organism for its\nexpression, and of showing all the features of a second self.\n\"We may thus have the curtailed primary self alternating with\na self formed by the split-off portion, and a hypothetical third\n1\nBitiet, Les Alterations de la Personnalite, pp. 6-20.\n-Revue Philosophique : Avril, 1910, p. 3'29 ;\nMai, 1910, p. 483.\n\f2G6 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nself, the normal self, which will appear if a synthesis of the\ndissociated states can be effected.\nThere are several cases on record in which this interpretation\nseems legitimate. But before going on to examine some\ninstances in which such a third self has appeared or in which\nits possible formation could be predicted, we may look for a\nmoment at an intermediate type in which a third personality\nmay arise. These are cases in which the stress causing\nthe dissociation has been so severe that everything that goes to\nthe formation of a personal consciousness disappears, leaving\nseemingly nothing but a bare consciousness without any\ncontent to play the part of a secondary personality. It\nwas to such a condition that Mr. Hanna was reduced as the\nresult of an accident.1\nAll knowledge of his former life, all\nhis acquisitions and memories, even his acquaintance with the\nmeaning of the organic sensations of his own body, had com-\npletely disappeared. But he was capable of learning, and at\nthe end of a few weeks he had learnt much. In doing so he\ndeveloped a new personality which had no knowledge of his\nformer self. But the old memories were not destroyed, they\nwere only dissociated ; and in the course of the treatment\nadopted by Dr. Sidis, the old self began to alternate with the\nnew self. The old self when it reappeared was as ignorant of the\nnew self as the new self was of the old self (see diagrams on Plate\nI, p. 284), therein differing from what happens in alternations\nof the Felida type. The only way to ensure the stability and\npermanence of the old self was to get it to synthesize with the\nnew self, thus producing a third self which knew both the others.\nThis third self was, however, different from the normal self\nwhich emerges as a third self in the synthesis of two selves\nwhich are each but fragments of an original whole self. For\nin the Hanna case each self was a whole self, although one\nhad a much fuller content, a much richer store of memories,\nthan the other. And the third self, instead of being the\noriginal self restored by the union of two halves, was the\noriginal self with the memories of the new self superadded.\nThe third self in the Hanna case must not then be confused\nwith the third self which arises from the reintegration of two\nselves, each of which is abnormal and fragmentary. The case\n1\nSidis and Goodhart, Multiple Personality (New York, 1905).\n\fLXVI.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 267\nof Mary Eeynolds,1\ndescribed by Weir Mitchell, may probably\nhave been of this latter kind, but the restoration of the normal\npersonality seemed to take place gradually late in life, and\nthere is no definite record of the inclusive memory which such\na third self should imply. A far more striking instance of\nthe restoration of the normal personality by the synthesis of\ntwo dissociated states is to be found in the history of Miss\nBeauchamp.2\nDr. Prince has shown that by a synthesis of\nB I and B IV the original Miss Beauchamp was reconstructed.\nB I was the original self curtailed by the dissociation of a\nportion of consciousness which six years afterwards reappeared\nas another personality, B IV. B I's memory was continuous\nfor her whole waking life up to the appearance of B IV.\nB IV's memory was continuous and coextensive with B I's up\nto the time of the dissociation, but B IV had no knowledge\nof the six years of B I's existence. When B I and B IV\nbegan to alternate, there was reciprocal amnesia. When the\nreal Miss Beauchamp was reconstructed she had memory for\nthe whole lives of B I and B IV. She was a third self formed\nby the synthesis of two dissociated states, each of which was\na portion of the original self (see diagrams on Plate I, p. 284).\nThe kind of disintegration of personality which leads to\nthe formation of two curtailed selves may in rare instances\nbe carried much farther, and instead of two selves, either of\nwhich might be mistaken for a more or less normal self\u2014so\nmany of the characteristics of selfhood do they retain\u2014we may\nget a large number of incomplete selves, some of which are so\nabortive as hardly to warrant the designation of selves at all.\nThe multiple personalities of Louis V.3\nand of Mary Barnes 4\nseem to belong to this category. But however many of these\npersonalities appear in any particular case, so long as they are\nbut split-off fragments of the original self, restoration of the\nnormal personality by a reintegration and synthesis of all the\nparts is always hypothetically possible.\nWe have thus constructed a series of dissociations of con-\nsciousness, ranging from the split-off ideas of hysterical som-\nnambulisms to the most extreme forms of multiple personality,\n:\nSee Myers, Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 336.\n2\nMorton Prince, The Dissociation of a Personality (New York, 1906).\n3\nSee Myers, Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 338.\n4\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. XVIII., p. 352.\n\f268 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nand we have found the mechanism of dissociation and the\nresulting phenomena to be of the same general type throughout\nthe whole of the series. A portion of the self becomes split off\nand excluded from the experience of the remaining consciousness.\nThe split-off portion remains, for the most part, latent ; but\nwhen by any means it is aroused, it displays extremely inde-\npendent functioning. When it is sufficiently unified to be\nable to take possession of the bodily organism it manifests as\na somnambulism, a fugue, or a secondary personality ; it\nalternates with the normal consciousness, or rather with what\nis left of the normal consciousness ; the experience of the\ntwo states is discontinuous, and their memories are mutually\nexclusive. Have we then exhausted the possibilities of dissocia-\ntions of consciousness ? Can we find a place in this series for\nevery form of multiple personality ?\nIn speaking of the Beauchamp case I said that the real\nMiss Beauchamp was reconstructed by the synthesis of B I and\nB IV. But what about Sally 1 There is hardly a vestige of\nSally in the restored Miss Beauchamp. When the real Miss\nBeauchamp was found, Sally went, as she herself said, back\nto where she came from, and it is there that we must look\nfor her, if we can find out where it is.\nI have said nothing of the differences of character which\nthe various selves of multiple personalities may present, and\nwe may disregard the character of Sally and confine our attention\nto one special feature in which she differs from all the other\ncases referred to so far. This feature is that Sally not only\nalternated with B I and B IV, but also existed as a co-conscious\npersonality when B I or B IV was present as an alternating per-\nsonality. Thus when B I was present as an alternating person-\nality, Sally co-consciously knew B Fs experiences\u2014her feelings,\nthoughts, and actions\u2014and knew them as belonging to B I.\nBut she also claimed to have at the same time concomitant\nexperiences of her own. And when she appeared as an alter-\nnating personality, she remembered not only B I's experiences\nbut also her own co-conscious experiences. She claimed to\nexist continuously as an independent personality throughout all\nthe various phases of Miss Beauchamp's life. A consciousness\nlike this seems something quite different from any of the forms\nof multiple personality we have examined, and if we find other\n\fLXVI.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 269\nexamples of a similar kind we must conclude that we have\nhere a new type of secondary self which cannot be fitted\ninto the series of dissociations which we have constructed.\nThe simplest examples of two separate streams of thought\ncoexisting in the same individual are to be found in certain\nhypnotic experiments. The only satisfactory explanation of the\nfulfilment of a post-hypnotic suggestion at a time that the\nwaking consciousness is fully occupied with other matters is\nto suppose that some sort of co-conscious intelligence is at the\nsame time attending to the fulfilment of the suggestion. When\nthe performance of the suggested act necessitates some definite\nmental process, such as making an elaborate calculation, the\nevidence for the existence of two simultaneously acting streams\nof thought is still better. Although we are not bound to\nsuppose that when waking life is resumed the hypnotic con-\nsciousness ordinarily persists as anything worthy of being\ncalled a second self, yet the phenomena observable in trained\nhypnotic subjects do point to something of this kind in these\ncases. Indeed, it can be shown that a true secondary personality\nwhich is demonstrably co-conscious with the waking self, may\nbe artificially produced or may develop spontaneously during\nhypnosis. A good example of this may be found in Janet's\naccount of his experiments with his subject Lucie, but perhaps\nthe best instances on record are the Leontine and Leonore\npersonalities which he discovered on hypnotizing Leonie (Madame\nB.).1\nIn Janet's description of the origin of Adrienne (Lucie 3)\nwe see the very beginning of such a personality taking form\nunder the hands of the experimenter. In Leontine and Leonore\nhe seemed to encounter two personalities already fully formed,\neach having definite characteristics and in some respects differ-\nent memories. Leonie knew nothing of Leontine or of Leonore.\nLeontine was co-conscious with Leonie and knew her life, but\ndid not know Leonore. Leonore was co-conscious with and\nknew the lives of both Leonie and Leontine (see diagrams on\nPlate II, p. 285).\nI have been able on several occasions to obtain similar\nstages of memory in suitable hypnotic subjects, but only very\nrarely have the different stages displayed any distinct differ-\nences in character. My experience is that if the experimenter\n'See Myers, Human Personality, Vol. I., pp. 322-330.\n\f270 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nmaintains the same attitude towards the subject in each stage,\nif he speaks in the same tone and about the same topics,\nthe stages do not in respect of character show any distinguishing\npeculiarities. But if the experimenter adopts a more familiar\nor frivolous attitude towards one stage, and a more reserved or\nserious attitude towards another, the change of attitude in the\nexperimenter is responded to by the subject, and each stage\nwhen it is subsequently induced exhibits respectively the levity\nor seriousness which was indirectly suggested by the experi-\nmenter on their first appearance. And although the characters\nof Leontine and Leonore seemed to exist ready made when\nJanet first discovered them, it must be remembered that Leonie\nhad frequently been hypnotized by different physicians many\nyears before she came under Janet's observation. It seems\nprobable that the differences of character exhibited in the three\nstates, although no doubt expressions of tendencies potential in\nLeonie's original nature, may have had in their development\nsome outside encouragement of the kind I have suggested.\nNevertheless, we do sometimes find secondary personalities of\nthis kind which seem to exist, in an incipient form at least, where\nno possibility of their artificial origin can be entertained. In my\nown case of Milly P. (see below, pp. 286 et seq.) the patient\nhad not been previously hypnotized by any one, yet I seemed\nto discover a hypnotic personality, claiming to be co-conscious,\nwhose character differed in some respects from that of the\nwaking personality. But I confess that the extraordinary\nrapidity with which Amelia developed self-consciousness and\ninitiative after I had given her a name, tends to make me\nsuspect the genuineness of the spontaneous formation of any\nco-conscious personality that may appear in the course of\nhypnotic experiment or treatment.\nThere are, however, several recorded cases which seem to\nindicate that a co-conscious personality may arise spontaneously,\nor that it may develop from some split-off fragment of con-\nsciousness acting as a nucleus around which subconscious\nexperiences during normal life, or experiences during spontaneous\nstates of mental dissociation, may accrete. The most notorious\nexample of this kind is the B III personality (Sally) of the\nBeauchamp case.\nWhatever our final view of Sally's personality may be, we\n\flxvi.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 271\nmust not minimize or forget the resemblances between Sally\nand the other co-conscious personalities already referred to.\nOne feature in particular which is common to them all is that\nit seems unnecessary for them to be synthesized with the\nwaking consciousness in order to form a \" normal \" personality.\nThese co-conscious states do not as a rule seem ever to have\nparticipated in the structure of the waking self, and no synthesis\nof them with the waking self is necessary in the interests of\nmental health. This is certainly true of the co-conscious per-\nsonalities developed by hypnotism. And even if the nucleus\nof Sally Beauchamp's individuality had been derived from\nsplit-off elements of the primary personality, her growth and\ndevelopment must have taken place in the subconscious. So\nthat as a fully formed personality Sally was never a part of\nthe original Miss Beauchamp in the same sense that B I or B IV\nwas, and when the reconstruction of the disintegrated self\nwas to be brought about, there was no room for Sally except\n\" where she came from.\"\nAre we to conceive of her as being still there as an imprisoned\nand impotent co-consciousness, or may we suppose that in Miss\nBeauchamp's reconstruction those very elements from which\nSally evolved have become reintegrated in the complete Miss\nBeauchamp, and that by the withdrawal of these elements from\nthe subconscious, Sally's personality has become for the time\nbeing totally disintegrated ? There is not much evidence in\nDr. Prince's book that anything of this kind took place, but\nwriting at a later date he says 1\n\"In Miss Beauchamp as a\nwhole, normal, without disintegration, it was easy to recognize\nall three dispositions as '\nsides of her character,' though each\nwas kept ordinarily within proper bounds by the correcting\ninfluence of the others. It was only necessary to put her in\nan environment which encouraged one or the other side, to\nassociate her with people who strongly suggested one or the\nother of her own characteristics, whether religious, social,\npleasure-loving, or intellectual, to see the characteristics of B I,\nSally, or B IV stand out in relief as the predominant personality.\"\nIt is hard to say just how much or how little, if any, of the\noriginal self may be necessary to form a nucleus around which\na co-conscious personality may grow, or what kind and extent\n1\nJournal of Abnormal Psychology, Vol. III., No. 4, p. 2S7.\n\f272 T. W. Mitchell, M.J). [part\nof dissociation may be sufficient to afford the requisite mental\nmaterial. Every normal self is an ideal construction, and in\nits formation much has to be cast aside as being useless or\nunsuitable. A secondary self that arises as a parasitic growth\naround a nucleus of cast-off mental dispositions may be more\nexcellent in some respects than the primary self. Yet it may\nbe not only unsuited for the practical purposes of life, but\neven positively detrimental to their realization. It may, indeed,\nbe so incompatible with the practical self which has to adjust\nitself to its environment at all costs, that any real synthesis\nof the two selves is impossible. We need not be surprised\nthat in the reconstruction of the real Miss Beauchamp there\nwas no room for Sally. Sally may, indeed, appear to be a\nstronger and more interesting personality than either B I or\nB IV, but her status is different. She is no integral part\nof the Miss Beauchamp who, for years before the final\ndisintegrating shock, had been endeavouring to construct a\nself that would be best suited to the practical purposes of\nlife. She represents rather a phase of Miss Beauchamp's nature\nthat had long been subject to repression as being incompatible\nwith the system of purposes on which the construction of her\ntrue self essentially depended.\nIn tracing the development of co-conscious processes from\nthe doubling of the stream of thought in hypnotic experiments\nup to the co-conscious life of such a personality as Sally\nBeauchamp, we seem to have constructed another series of\ndissociations whose differentia is this very fact of co-conscious\nactivity. I do not wish to suggest that in practice we can\ndraw a sharp line between these two kinds of dissociation or\nthat mixed forms may not be met with, but there are certain\nfeatures peculiar to each which seem to justify us in regarding\nthem as separate types. In the first series the split-off portions\nof the self seem to remain latent until the attack or alternation\noccurs. During their periods of latency they seem cut off\nfrom all experience, and do not grow or develop in any way.\nThere is a division of the self without any true doubling of\nconsciousness. In the second series the dissociated portion\nof consciousness may never have formed a part of the waking\nself, and consequently cannot properly be described as a split-off\npart of the mind. When it is not in evidence as an alternating\n\flxvi.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 273\npersonality, it is not latent. It is co-conscious, and may have\nexperience and grow and develop in the subconscious. There\nis a doubling of consciousness without any true division of\nthe normal self.\nA co-consciousness, whether associated with hysteria or not,\nusually, if not always, manifests only in cases that have been\nsubjected to hypnotic or other artificial procedures, and we\nmay regard it as being essentially of the same nature as\nother hypnotic phenomena, without thereby implying that\nthese procedures have produced it. Split-off portions of the\nself may indeed sometimes exhibit proof of their co-conscious\nexistence, but it is very rare to have any manifestation of\nsuch co-consciousness unless some artificial means are taken to\nelicit it. It may seem unjustifiable to class Sally Beauchamp\nwith ordinary hypnotic phenomena. And so it may be, for\nSally has been a puzzle to many of her commentators. But\none cannot help feeling that if B I had never been hypnotized,\nSally would never have been \" born.\"\nWere it not for our knowledge of the possibility of the\ncoexistence in one individual of two independent streams of\nthought as revealed by hypnotic experiments, we might be\ninclined to think that the claim of a secondary personality to\ncontinuous co-conscious activity is an illusion. But when we\nsurvey all the evidence for the existence of co-conscious states\nthere seems no good reason why we should deny the claim\nof such a personality as Sally Beauchamp. There is, however,\none case on record which seems greatly to increase the difficulty\nof forming any conception of the relations which obtain between\nthe various personalities when co-consciousness is claimed by\none or more of them. Dr. Prince has published the autobio-\ngraphy of a personality who describes with great fullness and\ncare her own origin by dissociation from an originally inte-\ngrated personality C, and her development into a secondary\npersonality B. who claimed to be co-conscious with another\npersonality A., formed by the secession of B. from C.\n1\nThe\noriginal healthy person C. broke up into A. and B., who alter-\nnated one with another. B. claimed to be co-conscious when\nA. was present as an alternating personality, but A. was\n1\n\"My Life as a Dissociated Personality,\" Journal of Abnormal Psychology,\nVol. III., Nos. 4 and 5.\n\f274 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nlatent when B. was present. Consequently A. was amnesic\nfor B., but B. was not amnesic for A. Under Dr. Prince's\ntreatment the original C. was obtained by the synthesis of\nA. and B., and the most puzzling feature of the case is the\nclaim of B. to persist as a co-consciousness after the normal\nC. had been thus reconstructed. Dr. Prince, in a prefatory\nnote to B.'s account of her life, after referring to the co-\nconsciousness when A. was present, says :\n\" The writer, B.,\nclaims to have the same co-conscious life with this apparently\nnormal stable personality.\" Now it is very difficult to under-\nstand how B. could participate in the synthesis by which C.\nwas obtained, and at the same time persist as a personality\ndistinct from and co-conscious with the personality thus\nreconstructed.\nIt is in our second series, I think, that we must find a\nplace for many of those more or less fully formed personalities\nwhich are met with in connexion with \" mediumship \" and are\nusually referred to as \" trance personalities.\" It is true that\ntrance personalities do not, as a rule, alternate with the waking\nconsciousness to the extent of taking possession of the whole\nbodily organism, and in many instances they afford no definite\nevidence of their existence as co-conscious activities. Yet in\nso far as their origin cannot be traced to any large splitting\noff or secession from the waking self, they seem to conform\nto the type of secondary personality whose growth and develop-\nment take place entirely in the subconscious.\nI have assumed that the evolution of these personalities\nmust be dependent on subconscious experiences in relation to\nthe ordinary environment. But if, as some people think, man\nhas an environment which transcends sense, it may be that\nthis environment can affect the subconscious without having\nany noticeable influence on the waking self. It would then\nbe legitimate to suppose that experiences related to such an\nenvironment might sometimes take part in the formation of\nsecondary personalities.\nIt would be out of place here to enter into any consideration\nof the supernormal phenomena which have been claimed to\nbe sometimes associated with trance or other dissociated states.\nThese are commonly lightly dismissed by medical men as being\nmerely products of hysteria and mal-observation. But even\n\fLXVI.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 275\nif every state of dissociation be labelled hysterical, we gain\nnothing by claiming this, and we lose nothing by admitting it.\nIf there is any transcendental world, and if it is possible for\nus to get into relation with it, it may very well be that such\nintercommunication is only possible during states of mental\ndissociation. And in regard to supernormal phenomena it does\nnot matter in the least what the term hysteria may connote.\nThe supernormality of an automatic script has to be determined\nby other considerations than the psychological state of the\nautomatist. If it can be shown that any hysteric really has\nthe gift of clairvoyance or any other supernormal power, it\nwill be just as good evidence as if he were a normal person.\nIf physical objects do move without contact in the presence\nof any one who is said to be hysterical, it is just as wonderful\nas if they so move in the presence of some one who is not.\nIn all these conditions which we have examined there is a\ndivision or a doubling of personality. Normally, we know all\nour thoughts, our feelings, and our actions, as cohering together\nin our one personal consciousness, but in cases of multiple\npersonality the self may become divided or curtailed, and the\nstream of consciousness may become discontinuous or doubled\nor multiplied. The unity of the self is broken, the parts\nmay function alternately or concomitantly, and one part may\nnot know the other.\nIf we try to put forward any hypothesis that will be\nexplanatory of the various forms of multiple personality, we\nare immediately confronted by a problem which is in itself\nso difficult of solution that no satisfactory answer to it has\nyet been found. In order to explain how consciousness can\nbe split into two, we must first be able to explain how it\never comes to be one. If we try to understand how a dis-\nsociation of personality can occur, we must first understand\nhow a unitary personality ever comes into existence.\nThere are two main views as to what constitutes the ground\nor basis of the unity of consciousness. All who accept the\ndoctrine of psycho-physical parallelism or any other monistic\nview of mind and body maintain that this ground must be\nsought in the structural and functional continuity of the nervous\nsystem. The whole neuronic substratum of mental life is\n\f270 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nfunctionally continuous, and the unity of the conscious stream\nwhich is correlated with its activity depends upon this continuity.\nIf the total aggregate of inter-related neurones becomes func-\ntionally discontinuous, there will be a splitting or dissociation\nof consciousness. As happens in our first series of dissociations,\none part of the disaggregated mass of neurones may continue\nto function and to be accompanied by a stream of consciousness,\nwhile the other becomes for a time latent. This latent portion\nmay afterwards become functionally active while the other becomes\nlatent. Or, as in Dr. Prince's case of B. C. A. (if we can trust\nthe introspection of the personality B.), both portions of the dis-\naggregated mass may continue to function so as to give rise\nto two coexisting streams of consciousness in one individual.\nA somewhat similar explanation may with some difficulty be\ngiven of the co-conscious streams of thought manifested in\nhypnotic experiments and by hypnotic personalities. The\nchief difficulty consists in providing for a duplicating of neural\nstructures corresponding to the duplicating of the content of\nthe mind which these personalities show.\nThe other main view of the unity of consciousness is that\nit must have as its ground some psychical subject or being,\nthe ego, soul, or spirit, which alone can account for the\nfusion of the physical manifold of experience into one psychical\nunitary whole. Those who adopt this dualistic hypothesis find\nit difficult to reconcile cases of double personality with that\nview of the soul which regards it as being in itself the full\npersonality independently of the nervous system. If we\nascribe to the soul only the forms of mental activity, and\nto the nervous system the content of the mind, we may\nsuppose that in the cases of divided personality described in\nour first series of dissociations the soul interacts alternately\nwith two or more functionally discontinuous systems of neurones.\nOr we may suppose that when the split-off part functions as\na secondary personality, a second psychic being or soul enters\ninto relation with this portion of the nervous system, while\nthe original soul retains its relations with the other portion.\nThis latter supposition seems to be unnecessary, for if these\nphases of the empirical self have their original ground of\nunity in the soul, they may still be so unified during their\nphenomenally separate existence. However diverse or opposed\n\flxvi.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 277\nthese phases may appear when exhibiting as alternating person-\nalities, the fact that they have formed part of the originally\nunitary self seems to get over the difficulty of regarding them\nas manifestations of the activity of one and the same soul.\nBut if such diversity of character and of conduct as may\noccur in secondary personalities which are alternately but not\nsimultaneously conscious can be unified in one and the same\npsychical subject or soul, there would seem to be no need to\npostulate any second soul in cases of secondary personality\nwhich show co-conscious activity. Yet we know that some\nmodern defenders of the soul have felt bound to suggest some-\nthing of this kind in order to explain the occurrence of such\na personality as Sally Beauchamp. Dr. M'Dougall thinks that\nthe facts of this case can best be explained \" by assuming\nthat a normally subordinate psychic being obtains, through\nthe weakening of the control of the normally dominant soul,\nan opportunity for exercising and developing its potentialities\nin an unusual degree.\" 1\nIn view of the gradations that may be observed between\nthe simpler forms of co-conscious activity and fully developed\nco-conscious personalities, the acceptance of this hypothesis\nis only compatible with belief in a plurality of psychical\nbeings or souls in every bodily organism. And if belief in\na plurality of psychical existents associated with one bodily\norganism be accepted on general metaphysical grounds, we must\napply it consistently wherever such application is logically\ndemanded. There seem no good grounds for Dr. M'Dougall's\ncontention that \" abnormal conditions of two distinct types\nare commonly confused together under the head of co-conscious\nor subconscious activity,\" 2\nand that a second soul or psyche\nis necessary in the one type and not in the other. At the\nextremes of the series of co-conscious phenomena the conditions\ndo indeed seem to be very different, but it is impossible to\nsay at what point secondary psychical beings or souls must\nbe assumed.\nIf we must postulate a soul as the necessary ground of\nunity of the normal consciousness, it is perhaps more probable\nthat in even the most pronounced cases of multiple person-\nality there is some underlying unity, rather than that secondary\n1\nBody and Mind, p. 368, foot-note. 2 Ibid., p. 368.\n\f278 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\npersonalities are manifestations of the activity of secondary\nand independent souls. One possible ground of such under-\nlying unity is indeed self-evident in the fact that all the\ndifferent personalities make use of one and the same bodily\norganism, and it does not seem impossible to believe that\nthey are all manifestations of one and the same psychical\norganism.\nThis possibility will seem the more easily conceivable if\nwe adopt the view of the relation between mind and body out-\nlined by M. Bergson in his philosophical writings. His\nconception of \" pure memory \" as being entirely a spiritual\nmanifestation and totally unconnected with any brain traces,\nhas the same practical consequences as the conception of the\nsoul as bearing both the form and the content of the mind.\nBut his view of the \"bodily memory,\" made up of the sum\nof the sensori-motor systems organized by habit, as being a\nnecessary factor in the reappearance of any recollection in\nconsciousness, helps us to understand how secondary person-\nalities, even when exhibiting co-consciousness, may be manifesta-\ntions of the activity of a single soul. On this view the soul\nmay be regarded as the ground of the unity of consciousness,\nbut the structural and functional continuity of the higher\nnervous system is a necessary factor in the phenomenal\nmanifestation of this unity. Although consciousness may not\nhave its true ground of unity in the functional or structural\ncontinuity of the nervous system, its manifestation as a unity is\nconditioned by such continuity, and any breach of continuity in\nthe nervous system will lead to a disruption of the unity of\nthe personal consciousness. We may, therefore, suppose that\nall the cases included in our first series of dissociations may\nbe accounted for by a breach in the functional continuity of\nthe systems of neurones through which the soul habitually\nmanifests.\nCan the same principles be applied to explain cases of\nmultiple personality of the co-conscious or hypnotic type ?\nCan these be accounted for by any disruption of the systems\nof neurones, whose functioning is correlated with the normal\nwaking consciousness ? I do not think they can. Divisions\nof the self dependent on a dissociation of neurones do not\nknow each other. They manifest as personalities alternately,\n\fLXVI.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 279\nand the one does not remember the other. But in person-\nalities of the co-conscious type\u2014in the hypnotic consciousness\nand in hypnotic personalities\u2014one of the phases or personalities\ndoes know the other. It may know it as part of itself,\nor it may know it as something so different from itself that\nit will not admit any identity or recognize any community\nof interest with it.\nThe knowledge of the primary personality by the secondary\nseems totally opposed to the view that these personalities are\nproduced by a breach in the continuity of the systems of\nneurones subserving waking consciousness. To say that such\nknowledge is telepathically acquired, is to invoke a precision\nand fullness of thought-transference of which we have no\nexperimental evidence and to which all the evidence we have\nis directly opposed. A co-conscious personality's experience, in\nso far as it is experience of the same things as that of the\nprimary personality, must be obtained through the same\nsensory channels and must be subserved by the same neuronic\nsystems. In so far as the co-conscious experience is a different\nexperience, or an experience of different things, it must be due\nto the inclusion in the functioning aggregate of a wider system\nof neural elements. The hypnotic consciousness, and the con-\nsciousness of hypnotic personalities, is invariably wider and\nmore inclusive than that of the waking person, and it cannot\nbe correlated with the functioning of a split-off portion or of\na curtailed remnant of the total neural substratum of con-\nsciousness.\nIn view of the occurrence of co-conscious personalities, we\nseem bound to look for some other ground of the felt unity\nof consciousness besides the spatial continuity of a nervous\nsystem through which a unitary soul may manifest. Such a\nground may, perhaps, be found in the conception of a psycho-\nphysical threshold which delimits, though it does not con-\nstitute, personality. Fechner introduced the conception of a\npsycho-physical threshold in order to account for the dis-\ncontinuity of consciousness in nature as a whole, but it may\nalso be applied to the discontinuity which is sometimes met\nwith in the consciousness associated with one nervous system.\nIf we adopt Fechner's symbolic representation of a human\nconsciousness as a wave with its crest rising over a certain\n\f280 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nthreshold above which only can waking consciousness occur, 1\nwe may regard this threshold as the normal threshold deter-\nmined in the course of evolution by its being that at which\nconsciousness is most useful for life. But the height of the\nthreshold may vary under different circumstances. If it is\nconsiderably raised, the activity of large systems of neurones\nceases to have any conscious accompaniment of which the\nindividual is aware, and the extent of the field of con-\nsciousness is proportionately curtailed. A permanently raised\nthreshold will produce a curtailed personality. On the other\nhand, if the threshold is lowered, we get an expansion of the\nnormal consciousness. Neurone aggregates, whose activity is\nnot intense enough to manifest in waking consciousness, become\nfunctionally continuous with the general mass of neurones now\nfunctioning at a lower threshold level. This low threshold\nactivity is accompanied by a form of consciousness which is\nnot the normal waking consciousness, although it may appear\nto be like it. It may be called the hypnotic consciousness,\nand is a result of a general lowering of the threshold. Any\nconsiderable lowering of the threshold will produce hypnosis,\nand a permanently lowered threshold will lead to the formation\nof a hypnotic personality.\nNow it would seem that functional activity at the lower\nlevel may go on concomitantly with activity at the normal\nthreshold, and that each form of activity may be accompanied\nby consciousness. But the only consciousness of which there\nis awareness in the waking state is that which occurs at or\nabove the normal threshold. Yet we know that a concomitant\nawareness at a lower level occurs in hypnotic subjects and is\nclaimed by hypnotic or co-conscious personalities. This secon-\ndary consciousness includes all that belongs to the primary\nconsciousness, but it also includes much of which the primary\nconsciousness knows nothing. And so extensive may the\nadditional mental material be that it may greatly modify or\ntotally alter the character pertaining to the primary personality.\nWe may thus have two coexisting streams of consciousness\nmanifesting as two distinct personalities through one bodily\norganism.\nIt seems impossible to account for the inclusive knowledge\n1\nThe diagrams given below are constructed on the basis of this conception.\n\flxvl] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 281\nof hypnotic personalities on any hypothesis which regards\nthem as being split-off' portions of the waking self. This\nknowledge seems more consistent with the view that these\npersonalities are expansions rather than curtailments of the\nwaking self. The form that the expansion takes will depend\non the nature of the complexes that are available for incor-\nporation with those of the normal personality at the hypnotic\nlevel, for these complexes may dominate the whole aggregate\nof complexes thus formed and stamp the resulting personality\nwith their own peculiarities.\nOn this view co-conscious personalities would be due to a\ndoubling of the threshold at which consciousness can appear.\nThe intensity of neural activity which is necessary for the\nappearance of a consciousness is not sufficient for the appear-\nance of the waking consciousness. The threshold of waking-\nconsciousness has been determined and fixed by natural\nselection. A rise in the organic scale is accompanied, and to\nsome extent conditioned, by' a rise in the threshold of waking-\nconsciousness ; but consciousness which is not immediately\nuseful for life may still occur at the older and lower\nthresholds. It is at the level of these lower thresholds that\nco-conscious personalities appear.\nIn attempting to construct two series of separate types of\nmultiple personality I described in each series a form of\ndissociation which seemed to be out of place there. Felida X.,\nalthough in one of her states she had knowledge of the other\nstate, was ranged along with those splittings of the self which\nshow reciprocal amnesia. And, again, among co-conscious per-\nsonalities which were shown to be not due to splittings of\nthe self I placed Dr. Prince's case of B. C. A., although the co-\nconscious personality B. describes her own formation as being\ndue to a splitting off of the B. complex from the original\nwhole personality C. Both of these cases seem to be mixed\ntypes, and we may, perhaps, regard them as being partly the\nresult of dissociation of neurone aggregates and partly of\nchanges of psycho-physical thresholds.\nIn Felicia's case we may suppose that the dissociation was\nbrought about by a gradual rise of the threshold of con-\nsciousness. As the threshold rose, groups of neurones would\nsplit off, one after another, from the main mass, and a gradual\n\f282 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ncurtailment of the personality would result. When the\nthreshold fell suddenly to the normal level, the dissociated\nneurones became re-synthesized and the normal personality\nreappeared. This normal personality had no amnesia for the\ncurtailed self, but when the threshold again became raised,\nthe resulting curtailed self had amnesia for the normal per-\nsonality. Now it is instructive to compare the memory\nrelations of these two phases with what occurs in hypnotic\npersonalities. Here also the consciousness at the lower\nthreshold has no amnesia for the consciousness at the higher\nthreshold, while that at the higher has amnesia for that at\nthe lower. In cases of the Felida type, the normal self has\nexactly the same relation to the curtailed self as the hypnotic\nself has to the normal self in other cases (see diagrams on\nPlate II). In fact, the normal self is a hypnotic phase of\nthe curtailed self; it is a self resulting from a lowering of the\nthreshold. This is well seen in some other cases of this type.\nWhen Blanche Wittmann,1\nin her curtailed phase, was hypnotized\nby Jules Janet she became her normal self. And this normal\nself\u2014a hypnotic phase of the curtailed self\u2014had, like all\nhypnotic phases of consciousness, knowledge of the self that\nhad been hypnotized. But when Blanche was \" awakened\ninto her former curtailed phase she had no knowledge of her\nnormal state, just as a person awakened from deep hypnosis\nhas no knowledge of the events of the hypnotic state. It was\nalso shown that the normal self of Blanche persisted as a\nco-consciousness when the curtailed self was present as an\nalternating personality.\nIt would seem then that cases of the Felida type ought\nproperly to be included in our second series of dissociations.\nA co-conscious personality, as a rule, is a hypnotic self which\nknows, but is not known by, the normal self. Here, however,\nwe have a normal self which knows, but is not known by,\na curtailed self. But in each case we have two selves func-\ntioning concomitantly at different threshold levels, and in each\ncase the lower knows the higher and the higher does not\nknow the lower.\nThe case of B. C. A. was included in the second series of\ndissociations because the personality B. claimed to be co-\n1\nSee Myers's Human Personality, Vol. I. , p. 447.\n\flxvi.] Some Types of Multiple Personality. 283\nconscious, although the way iu which the two personalities\nare said to have been formed allies this case to those of the\nB I-B IV type described in the first series. In the Beauchamp\ncase B I and B IV had amnesia for each other, as they might\nbe expected to have if they resulted from a splitting of two\nsystems of neurones, but B. of the B. C. A. case had no amnesia\nfor A. and claimed co-consciousness. We can only suppose\nthat here in addition to the neurone dissociation there was\nalso some dislocation of thresholds. But as I have already\nsaid, it is difficult to bring this case into line with any of\nthe forms of multiple personality hitherto recorded.\nAlthough these two types of multiple personality may be\ndifficult to classify, they raise no new problems in regard to\nthe ground of the unity of consciousness or in regard to\nthe hypotheses that may be put forward in explanation of\ndissociation of various kinds. If we have to postulate a soul\nas the ground of the unity of any consciousness, we must\npostulate a soul as the ground of the unity of each of the\nconsciousnesses met with in personalities of the co-conscious or\nhypnotic type. But there seems no reason why we should not\nregard one and the same soul as the effective ground in each and\nall of the phases of consciousness occurring in one individual.\nThe personality formed at the lowest threshold is the most\ninclusive and has the fullest content. The soul as bearing this\ncontent can project the \" pure \" memories of this personality\ninto consciousness at this level only, because only here are the\nappropriate sensori-motor memories to be found. The waking\nconsciousness cannot know these pure memories, because the\nnecessary sensori-motor memories cannot rise above the\nnormal threshold. The soul as pure memory can manifest\nin consciousness only when it finds the appropriate sensori-\nmotor memories ready to hand. As M. Bergson says, 1 \" l'esprit\nhumain presse sans cesse avec la totalite de sa memoire contre\nla porte cpie le corps va lui entr'ouvrir,\" and where there is\nmore than one threshold, there is more than one door.\nWe may, therefore, regard the unity of consciousness re-\nvealed on introspection as being conditioned by the spatial\ncontinuity of neural elements and by a psycho-physical thres-\nhold above which only is the functional activity of these\n1\nBergson, Matiere et Memoire, p. 198.\n\f284 T.

Multiple personalities of\nthe simply alternating type are due to a structural or func-\ntional discontinuity or dissociation of neurone systems. Those\nof the co-conscious type are due to the existence of different\nthreshold levels at which conscious processes may arise.

W. Mitchell. M.D. [part\nII.\nA STUDY IX HYSTERIA AND MULTIPLE PERSONALITY,\nWITH REPORT OF A CASE.\nBy T. W. Mitchell, M.D.\nIt is with considerable hesitation that I venture to give to the\nSociety some account of a case of hysteria which I have had\nunder observation for the past ten years. The facts which\nI am about to record may seem to have little bearing on\nPsychical Research. It may be said that these are pathological\nphenomena, and that our Society is not concerned with disease.\nTo this I would answer in the words of Mr. Myers, \" These\nare not pathological phenomena, but pathological revelations of\nnormal phenomena, which is a very different thing. The gearing\nof the hysteric's inward factory is disconnected ; the couplings\nare shifted in all sorts of injurious ways ; some of the wheels\nare standing still, and some are whizzing uselessly round and\nround. But the wheelwork is still all there ; and by observing\nthe various hitches and stoppages which are now taking place,\nwe can get a better notion of the way the power is applied\nthan the smoothly working, carefully-boxed machinery of the\nhealthy subject is likely to give us.\" 1\nIf Mr. Myers's defence\nof hysteria as a fit subject of study for our Society is accepted,\nI need make no apology for recording this case here, for it\nabounds in hitches and stoppages in the working of the mental\nmachinery which are of a very peculiar character.\nAmelia Geraldine P. . . . was 29 years of age when I first\nattended her professionally in 1901. She is unmarried, and\nlives at home with her father and two sisters. Her father is\n1\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 200.\n\flxvl] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 287\na retired tradesman, and she has had an education suitable to\nher station in life. Her family history is good, there is no\ndiscoverable neurotic taint, and she enjoyed good health up to\nthe beginning of 1901. There is an indefinite history of some\nslight affection of a choreic nature when she was about eleven\nyears old.\nOn Feb. 3rd, 1901, a very cold day, whilst out walking,\nshe was suddenly seized with a paroxysm of coughing. She\nwent home, and as the cough persisted, I was sent for. I\nfound her temperature just over 100 F. and sent her to bed.\nThe cough was of hysterical type, and lasted for twenty-four\nhours with very little intermission.\nTwo days afterwards, the patient still being in bed, a\ntwitching of her left hand was observed. I was called in as\nsoon as it was noticed, and I found the movements limited to\na rhythmic extension of the left wrist. This soon came to be\ncombined with supination of the hand. If opposed, the move-\nments became more violent and irregular. In the course of\nthe evening, the left elbow joint was included in the movements,\nand next day the whole of the left arm was affected. The\ntemperature ranged from 99\u00b0 F. to 101\u00b0 F. The movements\nceased during sleep. The deep reflexes were much exaggerated,\nespecially on the left side. The patient was dull and apathetic,\nand complained of pain in the head. On Feb. 7th the left\narm was still jerking vigorously, and the left leg became\naffected in a similar manner. The leg movements began with\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles which produce inversion\nof the foot. Next day the whole of the left leg was included\nin the movements, and the arm was still in the same condition.\nOn Feb. 10th the right foot began to be affected in the same\nway as the left had begun, namely by rhythmic inversion of\nthe foot, aud on Feb. 11th the whole of the ris;ht le\" was\nincluded in the movements, and the right hand had begun\nto be extended at the wrist aud supinated. On Feb. 12th\nthe whole of the right arm was affected, while the movements\nof the left hand had somewhat abated. The patient's speech\nbecame affected in a peculiar manner. There was ptosis and\nphotophobia of the left eye. Pain in the head was severe.\nThe temperature was 100*6\u00b0 F.\nThe speech defect was not investigated at this time as the\n\f288 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\npatient was too ill, but the general impression it gave was\nthat there was a great preponderance of sibilants. She seemed\nto have no difficulty in saying what she wanted to say, but\nmerely a faulty pronunciation, such as \" ses \" for \" yes,\" \" sad\n\"\nfor \" bad,\" and so on.\nFrom this date, Feb. 12th, 1901, the movements began to\nabate, and in their disappearance they followed the exact\norder in which they had come on. First the left hand and\narm became quiescent, then the left foot and leg, then the\nright foot and leg, and lastly the right hand and arm. The\npain in the head got better and the temperature went down.\nBy March 5th, 1901, all the movements had ceased. The\ndeep reflexes were still exaggerated, and testing them tended\nto produce a temporary return of the contractions.\nThere was now found to be complete anaesthesia with loss\nof muscular sense of the whole of the right arm with the\nexception of the thumb and index finger. This had been\npreceded for some time by a loss of accuracy in localising\nimpressions. Some time later it was discovered that the whole\nof the right half of the body had become totally anaesthetic\nand analgesic with the exception of the thumb and index\nfinger. There was paresis, more or less pronounced, of all the\nlimbs, and for many weeks there was almost total inability to\nwalk. The left arm and leg were at first more paralysed than\nthe right, but they recovered more quickly. There was very\nmarked concentric reduction of both visual fields.\nAt various times during her convalescence there was some\nrecurrence of the muscular spasms, but as time went on, the\nrhythm of the movements became quicker and their extent\nmore restricted, so that they had in the end rather the character\nof a coarse tremor than of clonic contractions. Sometimes they\nlasted for days in one limb without any intermission except\nduring sleep. All her limbs were affected in this way at some\nperiod of her convalescence, but in no definite order. At\nvarious times there was a return of coarser movements of the\nlimbs, but they had to a great extent lost their rhythmic\ncharacter and were of a more choreic type. The left arm\nand shoulder were affected for a long time in this way, but\nby July 20th, 1901, both the choreic movements and the\ncoarse tremor had quite disappeared. There was, however, still\n\flxvl] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 289\ngreat loss of power in the limbs. In the beginning of August\nI sent her to Folkestone for a change. At the end of a\nfortnight she returned very much improved in every way.\nShe afterwards made a more or less uninterrupted recovery,\nand in the course of some months became practically well.\nBy the end of July, 1902, the only trace of her illness was\na total hemianalgesia of the right side of the body with the\nexception of the thumb and index finger. This condition seemed\nto cause no inconvenience whatsoever, and it remained unaltered\nuntil Nov. 9th, 1906, when it suddenly completely disappeared.\nThe patient's condition with regard to motor power, sensation,\nkinaesthesis, and the reception and production of spoken and\nwritten language was tested many times during the course of\nher illness. I will only refer to some of the most striking\npeculiarities observed in regard to kinaesthesis and speech.\nIt must be remembered that the index finger and thumb\nof the right hand were at no period of her illness involved\nin the hemianaesthesia which for so long affected her, nor was\nshe ever deprived of the knowledge to be gained by kinaesthetic\nimpressions from these two members, even when the loss of\nmuscular sense was complete in the rest of the arm. If passive\nmovements of the right arm were made, the patient being blind-\nfolded, she had no knowledge of the position of the limb, except\nwhen the forefinger and thumb came in contact with something\nthat she recognised, such as her dress or her hair. When she\nwas blindfolded, active movements of the right arm were very\nimperfectly performed. If asked to raise her hand on to her\nknees she felt with her forefinger and thumb as she slowly\nslid her hand along her dress. When the arm was kept away\nfrom her side she was unable to perform the action, but she\nkept moving the forefinger and thumb as if trying to come in\ncontact with something that she might recognise.\nOne day in July, 1901, she was lying on a sofa when I\ncalled to see her. I asked her which leg she could move best.\nHer answer was, \" The right one, if I can see it.\" I asked her\nto bend the leg at the knee without looking at it. She said\nshe could not, but on being urged to try she made the limb\nmove slightly, and the foot slipped off the sofa on to the floor.\nOn asking her where her foot was now, she said she did not\nknow. I told her to look. She did so, and said it had slipped\n\f290 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ndown. \" Now,\" I said, \" lift it up and lay it beside the other\none.\" In order to do so she sat upright, so that she could see\nexactly where her foot was, and then quite easily and rapidly\nshe replaced it on the sofa.\nThe type of paralysis here disclosed is of very rare occur-\nrence, and is met with only, I think, in cases of most profound\nanaesthesia. Very few instances of the kind have been recorded.\nThe earliest indication of any disturbance of speech was the\nsibilant lalling which came on at the end of the first week of\nher illness. On analysing at a later date the defects in her\nspeech production it was found that all the vowels were given\ntheir proper value when used in words. If the vowels were\npronounced by themselves they were always prefixed by a y\nsound, thus, ya, ye, yi, yo. Of the voiceless oral consonants p\nwas always given as s, and the voiceless w as ?\/. Of the voiced\noral consonants w, I, and r were always pronounced as >\/, while\ng was given as d in the earlier part of her illness and later\nas g. B was at first given as s, but later as b. Of the voiced\nnasal resonants n was the only sound which gave any trouble.\nFor example, she always referred to the letter in as \" am m.\"\nIt may be noticed that the difficulties were confined to the\nlabials and the linguo-palatals.\nAlthough for more than a year her speech was characterised\nby these peculiarities, her sisters assured me that on several\noccasions during that period they had heard her saying her\nprayers with a faultless pronunciation.\nWhen the acute phase of her illness was over it was found\nthat she could not read. She could still write, but her writing\nreproduced all the peculiarities of her speech, the substitution\nof the letters y and s for other letters corresponding to the\nsubstitution of these sounds in her spoken language. She was\nunable to read what she wrote, so the peculiarities which\nrendered her writing rather difficult to understand were not\nnoticed by her. The handwriting was good when the tremor\nand paresis of the right arm had passed off. The following is\na good example of the sort of letters she wrote at this period :\nMy dea Hayy\nI was veyy seaseg to hea you ayyieg home safey\nYou will be sussised to hea E . . . yode down on Sungay. 0 . . .\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 291\n& I went to meet him & as usuay he dave us a yost joyney tooc\nthe yond tunind & came though . he is yoocind vey well &\nis comind adain nex Sattye weec.

He is\nlooking very well and is coming again next Saturday week. Well\nI can't write any more. I am tired. Love from everyone.\nP.S. Do you like your photos.\nIt may be seen that the substitution of letters is very\nsimilar to that which was noticeable in her speech. There\nare, however, some differences. The only constant similarity\nin her speech and writing was the use of y and s for other\nletters. Yet it may be noticed that the letter r is sometimes\nwritten y and sometimes omitted altogether. The letter I is\ngenerally written as y, but in short words like \" well \" and\n\" will \" it is often written correctly. The phrase \" love to all\nis in some of her letters written correctly, in others as \" yove\nto ayy.\"\nIn writing to dictation the same mistakes were made as in\nspontaneous writing. Thus the phrase \" Let us go out \" was\nwritten \" Yet us do out.\" She could not do transfer copying\nthat is, copying from printed into written characters. In copy-\ning from writing she copied only such letters as she recognised ;\nthe others she \" drew \" very badly.\nFor many months she was almost totally word-blind and to\na great extent letter-blind. On testing her with large printed\ncapitals it was found that she could seldom recognise at sight\nthe letters h, c, d, c, g, Je, I, n, p, q, r, x, y, z. D was always\ncalled y without any hesitation, while g was not recognised at\nall or was mistaken for c. K, I, and r were always called y.\nP was always called s. S was recognised and named correctly,\nbut she could not distinguish it from p. She had the same\n\f292 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ndifficulties with written letters as with printed ones, but when\nshe was allowed to trace over the written letters with the\ntip of her index finger she could name many of them correctly.\nThis held good of all the letters which she made use of in\nspontaneous writing.\nThere were, however, certain letters of which she seemed\nto have lost all knowledge. For many months the letters k,\nI, p, and t were not recognised by sight, by sound, or by\nkinaesthetic impressions. They were not used in writing, nor\nwere their sounds used in speech. One day after much trouble\nI taught her to pronounce the letter p, and the curious fact\nwas observed that from that day she could use the p sound\nin speech, could read the letter in print and in writing, and\ncould use it in writing spontaneously or from dictation.\nShe could name the numerals correctly up to 20, after which\nshe said 30, 40, 50, etc. She could also write them, but was\nunable to read them after she had written. Even when allowed\nto trace over the figures with her forefinger, she rarely was\nable to name them correctly. In consequence of her difficulty\nin reading figures she was incapable of doing the simplest\naddition sums on paper. Yet she was still good at mental\narithmetic. She was especially quick at the multiplication\ntable, and never made a mistake.\nThe word-blindness was almost total for some months, but\nshe was able to read with understanding long before she could\nrecognise all the letters. Her power of reading, like her\nrecognition of letters, came back gradually, and so far as could\nbe judged, re-education had little to do with her recovery,\nalthough she had lessons every day. This was especially\nnoticeable with regard to those letters which she had most\ncompletely forgotten. Prolonged efforts to teach her to recog-\nnise the letters k, r, and I, having resulted in complete failure,\nthe attempt was given up. Yet in the course of time these\nletters came back to her. One day she discovered she could\nrecognise k; some weeks later the same thing was observed\nwith regard to I ; and in the end she once more knew all\nthe letters of the alphabet. The most striking instance of a\ngood result from trying to teach her was the effect of showing\nher how to pronounce the letter p, or rather the p sound in\nwords. Why regaining the power to produce the sound should\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 293\nhave enabled her to recognise the letter may be difficult to\nexplain, but there is no doubt as to the fact that the one\nfollowed the other almost immediately.\nSince we may get word-blindness without letter-blindness,\nand letter-blindness without word-blindness, it is probable that\nher recovery of the power of reading words was not dependent\non her recovery of the power of recognising letters ; but\nit was observed that improvement in both respects took place\nat about the same rate. The same holds good in regard to\nher speech, and the recovery of ability to recognise a letter\nwas generally accompanied by the reinstatement of its sound\nin her speech. Whether one invariably preceded the other,\nand if so which returned first, I cannot say, as by the time\nsuch recovery took place her general health had so much\nimproved that I had stopped seeing her regularly. Eighteen\nmonths after the onset of her illness she had quite recovered\nin every respect, with the exception of right hemianalgesia,\nwhich persisted for nearly six years.\nDuring the whole course of this illness of eighteen months,\nand after recovery had taken place, the interpretation of the\ncase was exceedingly difficult. The symptoms pointed to serious\norganic disturbance of the brain, combined, however, with a\nlarge functional element whose extent it was impossible to de-\ntermine. The acute condition at the beginning corresponded\nto no known affection, and the long duration of the word-\nblindness was opposed to the view that it was of a purely\nfunctional nature. Yet it was almost impossible to understand\nhow the various peculiarities of the case could be accounted\nfor by any definite organic lesion. The fact that the patient\ncould write, although she could not read, except by kinaesthetic\nimpressions, showed that her word-blindness conformed to the\ntype of \" pure \" word-blindness first described by Dejerine in\n1892, but with regard to certain letters of the alphabet there\nwas not only \" blindness \" but agraphia.\nExcept for the hemianalgesia, which caused her no incon-\nvenience, the patient remained very well until December, 1904.\nOn Dec. 3rd I was called to see her on account of a twitching\nof the mouth which had been present for a few days. I found\nher lying on a sofa asleep. Her face was in repose until she\n\f294 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PART\nawoke. As soon as she awoke, choreic movements of the\nmouth began. The mouth twitched first to one side, then to\nthe other, and continued to do so without ceasing. Next day,\nwhile the movements of the mouth continued, the tongue\nbecame affected in a similar manner. She was drowsy and\ndisinclined to talk. The temperature was 101\u00b0 F.\nOn Dec. Sth she became very deaf, especially in the right\near, and her speech became affected in the old way. Asked\nto spell \" lazy,\" she said \"\ny, a, z, y\" and pronounced it \" yazy.\"\nOn Dec. 19th the movements of the mouth suddenly stopped,\nbut the tongue-movements continued. On Dec. 20th severe\nheadache came on suddenly. Complaint of headache continued\nfor a month. On Dec. 22nd the tongue-movements stopped.\nOn this date I found that the right leg was paralysed. She\nwas also anaesthetic and analgesic on the right half of the\nbody. She was apparently very deaf, and did not understand\nwhat was said to her unless it was shouted into her left ear.\nYet I sometimes got her to answer questions spoken in a low\nvoice close to her right ear, and on several occasions she seemed\nto know what I was saying to her sisters. At all events she\nfrequently made remarks very relevant to what we were talking\nabout. Her sister told me that the patient had written some\nletters, and that her writing showed all the peculiarities which\ncharacterised it during her former illness. On Jan. 19th, 1905,\nrhythmic movements of the right hand, like those which\noccurred at the beginning of her former illness, began. They\nlasted for eight days and then suddenly stopped. She became\nduller and less inclined to talk, and still complained of headache,\nearache, and deafness.\nHer condition remained more or less unaltered for many\nweeks. Some of her symptoms passed off and new ones took\ntheir place. The following note was written by me on March\n25th, 1905 :\nSome days ago the paralysis of the right leg suddenly passed\naway. She said she heard a voice within her saying, \"You can\nwalk.\" She immediately got out of bed and walked without difficulty.\nThere has been a serous discharge from the left ear for about a\nweek, and now hearing in this ear is very much better. The right\near is still very deaf.

She can open the fingers quite easily by\nusing the other hand to force them open.

There does not seem to be any real word-deafness,\nalthough there seem to be some words which she does not under-\nstand. She does not know the multiplication table. She cannot\ncount up to ten. After a little teaching she tries to do so, but\nalways leaves out 2 and 8. She does not recognise any written\nfigures. Although she has forgotten the multiplication table, she\nhas a good memory for certain money tables learnt at school. She\nnever makes a mistake in turning pence into shillings. I ask her\nwhat thirty-two pence make, and she answers immediately \"two\nand eight pence.\"\nThroughout April, May, and June, 1905, her condition did\nnot vary much. The discharge from the left ear became tinged\nwith blood. The left eye became affected in the same way,\nand every day some blood oozed from the lower eyelid, although\nno abrasion or solution of continuity of the skin or mucous\nmembrane could be detected. This condition lasted until the\nend of July, 1905.\nIn the beginning of July, 1905, she went to Folkestone for\na fortnight. She came back improved in health, and was now\nable to open and close all the fingers of her right hand. Her\neye and ear still bled almost every morning, and she com-\nplained of great difficulty in seeing. On Aug. 16th she\nconsulted an eye specialist, who found an enormous amount\nof hypermetropia and prescribed Sph. + 3\n-\n75 glasses for both\neyes. She could not see at all with these glasses, but on the\nother hand she could see much better than formerly without\nthem. On Aug. 19th, the day before she got her glasses, her\n\f296 T. W. Mitchell, M.I). [part\neye did not bleed. On Aug. 20th her ear did not bleed, and\nshe told her father that her eye and her ear would not bleed\nany more. She had frequently made such announcements with\nregard to the disappearance of other symptoms, and on this\nas on former occasions her prognostication was correct. With\nthe cessation of the bleeding from the ear, the deafness, which\nhad lasted for seven months, entirely disappeared.\nShe still remained totally word- and letter-blind, she was\nalso still completely agraphic, and she lalled in her speech\nalmost as badly as ever. Yet her sisters informed me that\nthey had occasionally heard her pronounce all her words per-\nfectly when talking to children or strangers.\nOn Oct. 28th, 1905, the total agraphia stopped, and she\nwrote me a letter in the style of the letters she used to write\nduring her illness in 1901. The spelling in this letter corre-\nsponded to that which was observed in the latter part of her\nformer illness, namely, the period during which her main\ntrouble was with the letters h, I, r, and p.\nOn Dec. 1st, 1905, there was sudden and complete recovery\nof sight, speech, and ability to read and write in a normal\nmanner. The hemianaesthesia which had persisted since De-\ncember, 1904, disappeared, but the hemianalgesia remained.\nI now stopped seeing her, but I learnt some months later that\nher sight became troublesome a\u00abain, and that on the advice\nof a friend she consulted another eye-specialist. He prescribed\nSph. + 1 glasses, and with these she was able to see much\nbetter than with her former ones.\nOn Nov. 7th, 1906, the right hemianalgesia which had\nexisted uninterruptedly since June, 1901, suddenly and com-\npletely disappeared.\nDuring the course of this second illness, which lasted from\nthe beginning of December, 1904, to Dec. 1st, 1905, there\nwas hardly any doubt as to the nature of the troubles from\nwhich the patient was suffering. Every fresh symptom helped\nto strengthen the conviction that all the peculiar phenomena\nwhich I have described were of functional or hysterical origin,\nand were not dependent on any organic lesion whatsoever.\nI did not see the patient again until Nov. 5th, 1908. She\nwas then in bed complaining of headache and general malaise,\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 297\nand had a temperature of 100\u00b0 F. She had kept well for\nnearly three years until a few weeks prior to the date of my\nvisit. She had then begun to complain of her head, and had\nbeen much troubled by obsessional thoughts. These still con-\ntinued to trouble her, and when I saw her on Nov. 5th, 1908,\nthey were her chief complaint. She said she constantly heard\nvoices telling her to run away from home, or to throw herself\ninto the water, and she was greatly distressed in consequence.\nI tried to hypnotise her, but with little apparent success.\nEvery day for a week I went through some brief hypnotic\nprocess, but thinking there was little probability of inducing\na true hypnosis, I confined my attention almost entirely to\nmaking suggestions with regard to the headache and obsessions.\nDuring this treatment the headache got well and the obsessions\nbecame much less troublesome ; but she developed many of her\nold hysterical symptoms. The old tremor appeared in both\nlegs with occasional choreic jerks of the arms. Her walking\npowers were very defective, and she twice fell and hurt her-\nself. Her old balling speech returned. She became cpuite\nword-blind and letter-blind except for the letter o, and totally\nagraphic. I persevered with suggestions of her speedy recovery\nfrom all these symptoms, but with no effect.\nOn Nov. 24th, 1908, I discovered that she now went into\nwhat seemed to be a genuine hypnosis with amnesia on waking,\nand I was disappointed that her speech affection, which I was\nnow convinced had no organic basis, did not respond to my\nsuggestions of recovery.\nOn Eov. 25th, 1908, she developed her old contracture of\nthe middle, ring, and index fingers of the right hand. She had\nno recollection of having suffered from this condition before,\nand its occurrence alarmed and worried her. She told her\nsisters that she was sure I could put it all right, and when\nI called next day she asked me to make her hand open. I\nhypnotised her, and told her that she could now open her\nhand quite easily, and that it would never again become closed\nagainst her will. She immediately opened her hand, and from\nthat moment had complete use of all her fingers. Suggestions\nduring this hypnosis as to cessation of the coarse tremors in\nthe legs had no effect. Later in the day she complained of\npain in the left ear, and feared that she was going deaf.\n\f298 T. W. Mitchell, M.J). [part\nThere was also some blood-stained discharge from the right\neye. Her sisters, remembering the trouble her eyes and ears\nhad been in her illness in 1906, were uneasy about this\nsymptom. The patient told them that she was sure I could\ncure the pain in tbe ear, and next morning she asked me to\ndo so. This was easily effected, but suggestions as to cessation\nof the tremor in the legs and ability to walk and speak\nproperly were of no avail.\nOn Nov. 29th, 1908, what troubled her most was complete\ncolour-blindness. She asked me to cure this. I hypnotised her\nand gave appropriate suggestions. At the same time I made\na whispered suggestion to the effect that at 12 o'clock she\nwould suddenly be able to read. Before waking her I said,\n\" You feel now that you can see colours properly, don't you ?\n\" Yes,\" she answered with great assurance.\n<:\nAnd what did I\nsay about 12 o'clock?\" \"That I should be able to read.\"\n\" And you feel you will ?\n\" She assented, but not with the\nsame assurance as she had shown with regard to the colour-\nblindness. I then woke her, and showed her various pieces of\ncoloured material. She at once named the colour of each of\nthem correctly. Her sisters afterwards told me that at or\nabout 12 o'clock the patient said she felt as if she could read\na little. She tried to do so, and could understand most of the\nwords, but long words still troubled her. In the course of the\nday this partial recovery regressed, and she could read only\nsmall words. Two clays afterwards I succeeded in restoring her\npower of reading completely, and there has been no return of\nthe word-blindness.\nIn the course of my attempts to dissipate some of her dis-\nabilities by suggestion, I was struck by the unequal success\nwhich attended my efforts. Some symptoms, like the contrac-\nture of the fingers, which in her former illnesses had remained\nunaltered for months, disappeared instantly at the first sugges-\ntion. Others, like the speech troubles and the difficulty in\nwalking, seemed to be quite unaffected, no matter how often\nor how impressively appropriate suggestions were given. It\nsoon became evident that the symptoms which were easily\nrelieved were those which in her waking state she asked me\nto relieve, or those to the relief of which I had gained her\nfree and unqualified assent during hypnosis. Without stopping\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 299\nhere to inquire into the meaning of this peculiarity, I may\nsay that, rightly or wrongly, I tried to make use of it for\ntherapeutic purposes, and I endeavoured to induce her to ask\nme definitely to relieve those symptoms which most seriously\nimpaired her bodily and mental health.\nThe condition I was most anxious to alleviate was the\nparesis and tremor of the legs, for, as she was practically\nunable to walk, she was kept a prisoner in the house, and her\ngeneral health was suffering in consequence. Every day for\na week I predicted to her that on Wednesday, Dec. 2nd, 1908,\nall her trembling would cease, and that she would be able to\nwalk as well as ever she did. On Dec. 1st I told her in\nhypnosis to ask me to cure her legs when I saw her next\nday. This she promised to do, but there was a lack of assur-\nance in her reply when I asked her if she felt sure that I\ncould make her walk properly.\nOn several occasions when I had desired her to ask me to\nrelieve some particular symptom, I had found on visiting her\nthat some fresh trouble had arisen, which seemed to her more\nurgent than that which I was anxious to relieve. I was not\nsurprised then to find on the Wednesday morning that she\nhad fallen downstairs and hurt her back. When I asked her\nwhat she wanted me to do for her, she said I must take away\nthe pain in her back ; but she made no reference to the\ntrembling of the legs, or the inability to walk. I led her up\nto this by saying that, besides taking away the pain in her\nback, which I said would be quite easy, I wanted her to ask\nme to do something more for her. She then said that she\nwished me to keep her from falling and hurting herself any\nmore. This gave me the opportunity to remark that the best\nway to do this would be to stop the trembling in her legs\nand to make her walk properly. To this she half reluctantly\nassented. I then hypnotised her, and made suggestions that\nher legs would stop trembling. These suggestions I continued\nfor about fifteen minutes, but, although the tremor seemed to\nsubside a little, there was no sign of its stopping. On being\nasked if she did not feel that her legs were going to become\nstill in a very short time, she said she was trying to make\nthem stop, but could not. \" Oh,\" I said, \" you need not try.\nAll you have to do is to sleep a little more deeply, and they\n\fsoo T. W. Mitchell, M.D: [part lxvi.]\nwill stop of their own accord. Now, I am going to stroke\nyour face, and at each stroke you will go more and more\ndeeply asleep.\" I then began to stroke her face slowly from\nabove downwards, and at the fourth stroke the legs suddenly\nbecame quite still. I told her that the trembling had stopped\nand would never return, and that now she could walk perfectly\nwell. That evening she walked to my house, a distance of\na mile.\nI would like to dwell for a moment on the nature of these\ntremors, which thus suddenly stopped after existing unchanged\nfor over three weeks. A similar trembling could possibly have\nbeen produced by voluntary muscular efforts, but this trembling-\nwas, as a matter of fact, occasioned by a series of inco-ordinate\nmuscular contractions, which can by no possibility be produced\nby the waking will. All over both limbs could be seen groups\nof muscles and even individual muscles, momentarily standing\nout as if stimulated by a Faradic current. Each contraction\nwas a violent twitch, which immediately passed off, or was\nrepeated once or twice in rapid succession. At the same time\nother muscles in other parts of the limb were similarly affected,\nand a constant succession of such isolated and widely separated\ntwitchings went on uninterruptedly.\nWhy those twitchings stopped in response to suggestion I\ndo not know. I do not think any one knows why such a\nresult should occur, and it seems to me to be folly or dis-\nhonesty to pretend that we do. I have seen many strange\nthings happen in response to suggestion during hypnosis, but\nI have not, I think, ever seen anything which more profoundly\nimpressed me than the sudden cessation of those muscular\ncontractions.\nEncouraged by the complete restoration of her walking\npowers, I lost no time in trying to get an equally good result\nwith regard to her speech and writing. During hypnosis on the\nevening of Dec. 2nd, I told her to ask me next morning to make\nher talk properly and write correctly. This she said she\nwould like, but she seemed a little doubtful as to the result.\nOn Dec. 3rd she asked me to make her talk properly and\nto be able to write, but the request did not come without\nsome prompting from me.

After hypnosis her speech was better, but by\nno means perfect, and I told her that it did not yet satisfy\nme. I said I still had difficulty in understanding her, and\nthat I wanted her to talk properly and to write nicely. Both\nin the waking state and in hypnosis I made her promise to\nask me next morning to complete the cure. The effect of\nthe suggestions given on Dec. 3rd with regard to writing\nmay be seen in the letter of this date, which is reproduced\nabove. It is very difficult to read, and her sister, who saw\nher writing it, told me that each individual letter in its\ncomposition was written backwards.\nOn Dec. 4th she asked me quite spontaneously to make\nher talk properly and write nicely. She promised in hypnosis\nto write me another letter during the clay. Immediately after\nthis hypnosis her speech was practically normal, and the letter\nwritten in the afternoon was well written and free from mis-\ntake. This letter of Dec. 4th, 1908, is also reproduced for\ncomparison with the other.\nHer chief disabilities having been removed, she very soon\nrecovered her health, and although for many weeks she provided\nme with a variety of hysterical symptoms on which to exercise\nmy therapeutic ingenuity, she was during this time a very\ndifferent person from the helpless invalid of the years 1902\nand 1904.\nAs I have already said, I was very much struck by the\nunequal results produced by suggestion in this case. Hypnosis\nwas apparently profound ;\npost-hypnotic amnesia was complete\nthe disabilities I was anxious to remove were obviously of a\nfunctional nature ; all the conditions favourable to the speedy\nremoval of any particular symptom seemed to be present ;\nyet\nit was clear that to most of my suggestions there was some\nresistance of a kind quite different from the mere failure of\nresponse to suggestion that may be met with in ordinary\npsycho-therapeutic work. It is difficult to account for such\nresistance to therapeutic suggestion as was met with in this\ncase. Obstinacy was certainly a very marked characteristic of\nthe hypnotised patient, but we feel that there must be some\ngood reason for unwillingness to accept curative suggestions.\n\f302 T. W. Mitchell, M.J). [part\nIt seems to me probable that the resistance to which I have\nreferred may be related to the resistance met with by Freud\nin the practice of psycho-analysis in cases of hysteria.\nIn Freud's opinion, hysterical symptoms are due to the\nrepression of painful ideas, so that they no longer occupy a\npart of the conscious field, and cannot be recalled voluntarily\nor by association. Eeliet' from the psychical pain caused by\nan unbearable idea is obtained by a conversion of the repressed\nfeeling into physical manifestations. This transformation is\ndescribed by Freud as a defence reaction of the ego against\nunbearable ideas, and the \" repugnance of the ego \" is the\npsychic force which determines the repression. The aim of\npsycho-analysis is to recover the repressed ideas in their\nentirety, to bring them back into consciousness, and to let the\nfeelings connected with them have their proper emotional ex-\npression. According to Freud, \" a patient can rid himself of\na hysterical symptom only after reproducing and uttering\nunder emotion its causal pathogenic impressions.\" 1\nIn the process of psycho-analysis, as practised by Freud,\ngreat resistance is sometimes encountered in trying to recover\nforgotten memories connected with the original psychic trauma,\nand Freud concludes that the resistance is due to the same\npsychic force which led to the repression, namely, \" repugnance\nof the ego.\" When we try to drag these painful memories\nback into consciousness, some part of the patient's mind seems\nto know that the restoration of these lost memories will be\naccompanied by feelings that are unbearable.\nNow if Freud's views on the causation of hysterical symptoms\nare correct, it would seem that when a hysterical symptom is\nremoved by suggestion, the disappearance of the symptom must\nbe accompanied by its re-conversion into some other symptom\nor into the original unbearable idea. And just as the \" re-\npugnance of the ego \" to the unbearable idea may lead to\nresistance in psycho-analysis undertaken to disclose it, so the\nsame psychic force may lead to the rejection of suggestions\ndirected towards the removal of the hysterical symptom.\nThe mutual interchangeableness of somatic and mental\naffections in hysteria was strikingly shown on several occasions\nin the course of the treatment of A. G. P. by suggestion.\n'Freud, Selected Papers on Hysteria (English Trans.), p. 100.\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 303\nWhen the obsessions of the early stage of the last illness\ndisappeared, the physical manifestations began. When cessation\nof the muscular twitching and ability to walk were obtained,\nthere occurred a series of dreadful dreams, which affected the\npatient very strongly (see p. 304). When the most persistent of\nall the bodily symptoms\u2014the right hemianalgesia\u2014was removed\nby suggestion, she passed almost immediately from a state of\ncomparatively normal mental health into a state of profound\ndepression, accompanied by phobias and obsessions. In the\nmiddle of the night, some hours after the disappearance of\nthe hemianalgesia, she wrote a most pitiful letter to her sister,\nin whicii she expressed the fear that she was going out of\nher mind, and begged her sister not to send her to an asylum.\nI received a letter from her next day, in which she said that\n\" the awful thing in her head \" kept shouting at her and\ntelling her to do dreadful things. So great was her distress,\nand so evident seemed the connection between the disappearance\nof the hemianalgesia and the appearance of the morbid mental\nsymptoms, that I decided to bring back the bodily defect by\nsuggestion, in the hope that by so doing the mental troubles\nmight be ameliorated. I was careful not to give any indication\nto the patient why I wished the loss of sensibility to return,\nyet with the recurrence of the hemianalgesia she soon returned\nto her ordinary state and became free from all mental distress.\nNow if we can suppose that somewhere in her mind there\nwas some sort of prevision that the removal of the hemianal-\ngesia would be accompanied by such mental distress, there\nwould be good reason for her prolonged rejection of my\ncurative suggestions in regard to this symptom, and this rejec-\ntion may be regarded as being due to the same cause as that\nwhich leads to resistance in psycho-analysis.\nBut although the relations between the resistance met with\nin psycho-analysis and the rejection of therapeutic suggestions\nare interesting, and may be worthy of further consideration, I\nwish here rather to describe how the resistance to suggestion\nmet with in this case appeared to me at the time. In the\ncourse of treatment it seemed to become more and more\napparent that there was a wilful rejection of certain therapeutic\nsuggestions and an exercise of choice and discrimination as to\nwhat suggestions were to be allowed to be effective. Here was\n\f304 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nno passive state in which every suggestion is readily accepted,\nbut rather a very obstinate and capricious person, who seemed\nto have some unusual kind of control over her own bodily\norganism. The rejection of therapeutic suggestions appeared to\nbe the deliberate act of a second personality brought to light\nby the induction of hypnosis. In order to estimate the nature\nof this personality, there is one circumstance connected with\nthe patient's history to which some reference must be made.\nSoon after I began to attend A. G. P. in 1908, it became\na common occurrence for her to talk in her sleep to her sisters\nbefore she awoke in the mornings. If one of them happened\nto be passing her door, she would call her by name, and she\nwas never known to be in error as to which of her sisters it\nwas. Indeed, they found it difficult to explain how she acquired\nthe knowledge she sometimes showed in regard to their actions\nin various parts of the house. She was never known to speak\nin her sleep unless she had something definite to say and\nsome one to say it to. There was no aimless or incoherent\nsleep-talking, as in dream or delirium. What she said was\nalways the definite expression of a person who knew what she\nwanted to say and said it. The subject-matter of these con-\nversations was as a rule confined to the symptoms or events\nof her illness, and her purpose in speaking apparently was\nthat I should be informed of certain matters which she thought\nit important for me to know.\nIn the morning of Dec. 4th, 1908, her father heard her\ncrying out, and went into her bedroom. He found her asleep\nand evidently dreaming, as she was struggling and crying as\nif in terror. Later she called her sister to her room, because\nher right eye was streaming with blood and blood was oozing\nfrom her right ear. When I heard this story next day, I\nasked her if she had dreamt in the night. She said she did\nnot think so. In hypnosis she told me that in the night a\nnasty man had attacked her, and hit her on the head with a\nhammer. When I referred to this episode as a dream, she\ninsisted very firmly that it was a real experience, not a dream.\nIn the waking state she had no knowledge of the matter at all.\nSoon after this various articles of value belonging to her\ndisappeared\u2014her watch, some money, and her keys, for example,\nwere lost, and could not be found. In the waking state she\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 305\ndid not know where these things were, and she sought for\nthem in vain. In hypnosis she confessed that she herself had\nhidden them, and told me where they might be found. She\nsaid she had hidden them because a nasty man had come to\nher in the night and wanted to steal them.- This man who\nwanted to steal her watch and money was the same man who\nhad attacked her with the hammer.\nThe whole of this dream life, and all the actions associated\nwith it, belonged to the stratum of consciousness revealed in\nhypnosis. The waking consciousness had no knowledge of any\nof the events of this phase of the patient's life. But although\nin the primary state there was no knowledge of the events of\nthe second state, there was in the second state full knowledge\nof all the events of waking life. This is, of course, the\nordinary type of amnesia observed in all cases of deep hypnosis.\nBut in this case there were many indications that the person-\nality of the second state was different from that of a mere\nstate of hypnosis, and it seemed to persist throughout waking\nlife as a co-conscious personality capable of acting on its own\ninitiative, and also capable of taking possession of the bodily\norganism at will.\nVery soon after the sleep-talking in bed began, it was noticed\nthat the patient often dropped into the second state in the\nday-time, and always on these occasions she spoke to her\nsisters of events connected with this phase of her existence, or\nmade remarks in regard to events of her waking life which\nshe would not have made if she had been awake. For example,\nin talking to her father, a querulous old man who was some-\ntimes very trying, she would often make cutting or sarcastic\nremarks, which she would not have made in her ordinary state.\nHe was often surprised at the things she said, but excused her\non account of her ill-health. Her sisters, however, knew that\nwhen she said those things she had dropped into the second\nstate, and they found that shortly afterwards she knew nothing\nof having said them. They said they never had any doubt as\nto which state she was in. In the second state her voice was\ndifferent, her manner of speaking was more vivacious, she was\nmore determined and assertive. She was exceedingly obstinate,\nvery petulant, and rather childish. Her eyes were closed or\nhalf-closed.\nu\n\f306 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nFor a long time I was scrupulously careful to avoid any\nsuggestion that might increase the separateness of the two\npersonalities. One day, however, when trying to discover their\npoints of resemblance and difference, I .proposed to the hypno-\ntised patient to speak of her in the hypnotic state as Amelia\nand in the waking state as Milly\u2014the name ordinarily used\nby her friends. Amelia, on being asked what was the differ-\nence, if any, between herself and Milly, said she was not very\nsure, but that she knew more than Milly did, and remembered\nmany things that Milly had forgotten. This seemed especially\ntrue of many of the events of her illnesses. Milly, when in\ngood health, had no recollection of her three illnesses. She\nknew she had been ill, but she did not remember much about\nit. During the course of these illnesses her memory was of\ncourse very defective in many ways, and in each attack one\ncurious loss, which proved very persistent, was observed. She\nforgot that her second name was Geraldine. Each time when\nshe got well, although she forgot the events of the illness,\nmost of her old memories came back to her ; but she still\ndenied for many months that Geraldine was part of her name.\nNow I found that Amelia knew no more than Milly about\nGeraldine being her second name.\nWhen I first tried to get Amelia to write automatically\nthrough Milly's hand she refused, giving as a reason that she\ndid not wish Milly to see what she wrote. I therefore asked\nher to write me a letter some time when Milly was asleep.\nNext day her sister brought me a letter which the patient,\nwhen in the second state, had asked her to give to me. It\nis interesting to notice how readily Amelia adopted the style\nof an orthodox second personality. The letter begins :\n\" My\ndear Doctor, She does not know I am writing this \"\u2014\" she\n\"\nbeing, of course, Milly.\nAmelia denied all responsibility for most of the morbid\nsymptoms from which Milly suffered, but she confessed to\nhaving caused some of them. She said in a letter to me, \" I\nmade her hands shake and her legs as well, and I scratched\nher and made all those nasty places on her hands and legs,\nand made her fingers close down and her thumbs so that she\ncould not move them. ... I made her fall downstairs and hurt\nherself.\" She said, however, that she had nothing to do with\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 307\ncausing the difficulties of speech, reading, and writing, or the\nbleeding from the eyes and ears, or the hemianaesthesia. Although\nwe must be cautious in accepting these statements, there are\nsome grounds for thinking that they have some foundation in\nfact. During the course of the patient's illness it seemed evident\nto me that those more serious disturbances, for the production\nof which Amelia denied all responsibility, were connected with\nthe functioning of dissociated states of consciousness which\nwere not synthesised within the hypnotic personality ; and\nwhen I succeeded in removing any of the more obstinate\nsymptoms by suggestion, I generally found it necessary to try\nto render hypnosis as deep as possible. The nature, or even\nthe existence, of such deeper hypnotic states was not experi-\nmentally tested at the time for fear of compromising the\ntherapeutic results, but when the patient was practically well\nI was able to hypnotise Amelia and so to obtain a new state\nwhich assumed the name of Amelia Geraldine\u2014from the fact that\nin it Amelia remembered her second name. Amelia Geraldine\nseemed to present a more normal character than Amelia. The\nchildishness of Amelia seemed to disappear and to give place\nto a more serious and womanly personality.\nBoth Amelia and Milly claimed to be amnesic of all that\ntranspired when Amelia Geraldine was present ; but although\nthis was no doubt true in regard to Milly, it sometimes appeared\nas if Amelia had some sort of knowledge of Amelia Geraldine.\nBoth Amelia and Amelia Geraldine ascribed the more serious\nfunctional disabilities to something beyond or within them.\nThere seemed indeed to be in this case some dissociated states\nwhich could not be recovered in hypnosis, dissociated ideas\nwhich were outside the mental content of any discoverable\npersonality, dissociated emotions deeply buried in the sub-\nconscious which revealed their presence by these bizarre defects\nof the psycho-physical organism. Amelia, in trying to excuse\nherself for her participation in the production of Milly 's troubles,\nsays, \" it is that awjul thing in my head that makes me do\nthose things to her ; it is dreadful and makes me feel bad,\nand I must do something to hurt her.\"\nNotwithstanding the beneficial results that had been obtained\nin this case by the use of suggestion, a stage was reached\nwhere it became evident that something more was necessary\n\f308 T. W. Mitchell, M.R [part\nto restore the patient to normal health. Every attempt at\nproducing complete freedom from all physical manifestations\nof hysteria was followed by an increase of mental pain and\ndepression. Although it is no uncommon experience to be\nable by suggestion to remove completely and permanently the\ndisabilities met with in mild cases of hysteria, it is the general\nopinion of those who have had much to do with graver cases\nthat complete restoration to health is difficult to obtain. Janet,\nin accordance with his view that hysterical symptoms are the\nresult of a narrowing of the field of consciousness, says that,\nso long as the field of consciousness remains contracted, we\ncan never add one phenomenon on one side without taking\none away from another side. Janet's hysterical has been well\ncompared by Freud to a weak woman who has been shopping,\nand is now on her way home laden with packages and bundles\nof every description. She cannot manage the whole lot with\nher two arms and her ten fingers, and soon she drops one.\nWhen she stoops to pick this up, another breaks loose, and so\nit goes on. This view of the nature of hysteria is hardly in\nkeeping with the observation commonly made that in hysteria\nexaltation of faculty in some directions is to be found along\nwith diminished power in others. More in accord, on the\nwhole, with clinical facts is Freud's view that the somatic\nsymptoms of hysteria are due to the conversion of repressed\nemotions into physical disabilities, and that where adaptation\nfor such conversion does not exist, purely mental symptoms\nsuch as phobies and obsessions may appear.\nIn view of the remarkable findings of Freud and his pupils\nin regard to the pathogenesis of hysteria, I decided to undertake\na psycho-analysis of A. G. P. in the hope that I might be\nable to achieve the complete restoration to health which sug-\ngestion alone seemed unable to effect. For various reasons I\nadopted, to begin with, the technique used by Freud in his\nearlier work, making use of the hypnotic state as a means of\nfacilitating the analysis. At a later period this was supple-\nmented by word-association tests in the waking state and\nother measures.\nIt soon became evident that the memory of incidents forgotten\nin the waking state was most readily resuscitated in the state\nknown as Amelia Geraldine (AG). Her memory of such in-\n\flxvi.] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 309\ncidents of a pathogenic kind seemed much wider and more\naccessible than that of Amelia (A). But it was soon found\nthat a still better state for psycho-analysis was one which\nmay be called AG2 ,\nproduced by hypnotising AG. When AG\nfirst appeared I suggested to her that she should open her\neyes, and that she should always \" come \" with her eyes open.\nAG2 had her eyes closed and said she was AG asleep. Thus\nwhen Milly (M) was hypnotised, A came with eyes closed.\nWhen A was told to sleep, AG appeared after a little time with\neyes open. On continuing the hypnotising process\u2014verbal\nsuggestions of sleep combined with light passes with contact\non the face\u2014AG closed her eyes and claimed to be AG2 . On\ntelling AG., to awake, she opened her eyes and was AG.\nOn telling AG to awake, she closed her eyes and A appeared.\nWhen A was told to awake, she opened her eyes and M\nappeared. M was amnesic for all the stages. A was amnesic\nfor AG and AG2\n. AG remembered what I said to A, but\n\" lost herself \" when AG2\nappeared.\nFrom the very beginning A had persistently asserted that\nshe was not responsible for all the things that Milly said and\ndid when asleep. I had assumed that it was A who spoke\nto her sisters and father in what I have described as the\nsecond state ; but in her first letter to me A had said, \" I do\nnot make her talk.\" For a long time I took no notice of\nthis denial, accounting it merely a ruse on A's part by which\nshe might escape a scolding from me. A, however, maintained\nvery persistently that Milly in her sleep often said and did\nthings for which she (A) was not responsible. These things\nwere ascribed by A to \" Milly asleep \" (Ma). But Ma was\na phase of consciousness with which I had no personal dealings,\nand in which I did not believe until A came to my assistance.\nShe told me that the way to find Ma was \" to put her\nto sleep\u2014very sound sleep\u2014ever so much deeper than you\nput me, and then make her open her eyes.\" The process\nhere described amounted to producing AG2 , or some deeper\nstate, and then getting her to open her eyes. After Ma was\ndiscovered, AG2\nappeared only as a transition stage between\nAG and Ma, and this latter stage was used in the remaining\nstages of the psycho-analysis.\nI find it very difficult to come to any conclusion regarding\n\f310 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PAKT\nthe interpretation which should be put upon these various\nphases of the hypnotic state in this case. I believe they were\nto a large extent artificial products, partly due to direct or\nindirect suggestion from me, but to a still greater degree to\nself-suggestion on the part of the patient. It seems to me\nimpossible to disentangle from the whole series of phenomena\nthat which might be due to self-suggestion and that which\noccurred apparently spontaneously. The different personalities\nexhibited no very striking differences of character, but, such as\nthey were, these differences were fairly consistently maintained\nthroughout the whole period of investigation. I charged both\nA and AG to take care of Milly, and to keep her well and\nfree from accidents or injuries. A became rather a fussy\nguardian of Milly's welfare, and reported her various misdeeds\nto me with an exaggerated sense of her own importance and\nrectitude. She was rather proud of her disciplinary methods,\nwhich consisted in biting and scratching Milly when the latter\ndid not act in accordance with A's ideas of what was con-\nducive to health. AG, on the other hand, generally spoke\n\" more in sorrow than in anger \" of Milly's delinquencies. Ma\nwas very like Milly awake, but with a greatly extended memory\nas regards certain experiences which were of hysterogenic\nsignificance.\nAccording to Freud, the pathogenic psychic material which\nhas been crowded out of the ordinary consciousness in hysteria\nmay be shown still to exist in an orderly form ; and again\nand again in the course of psycho-analysis undertaken in the\nwaking state, Freud seems struck by the appearance of its\nbeing in the possession of a second intelligence. He says\n\" One receives a delusive impression of a superior intelligence,\nexternal to the patient's consciousness, which systematically\nholds a large psychic material for definite purposes. ... I\npresume, however, that this unconscious second intelligence is\nonly apparent.\" 1\nIn another place he says :\n\" The pathogenic\npsychic material appears as the property of an intelligence\nwhich is not necessarily inferior to the normal ego. The\nsemblance of a second personality is often most delusively\nproduced.\" 2\nThere are some grounds, I think, for demurring to Freud's\n1\nFreud, loc. cit., p. 90. 2\nIbid., p. 104.\n\flxvl] A Study in Hysteria and Multiple Personality. 311\nview that this semblance is necessarily delusive. It seemed\nto me that in the case of A. G. P. the induction of hypnosis\nbrought me into touch with a series of personalities who held\nin their possession a vast amount of psychic material of which\nthe waking consciousness had lost all knowledge, and of a\nkind which, on Freud's own showing, must be regarded as\nhysterogenic.\nOn trying to recover some of the incidents of Milly's past\nfrom A, AG, or AG.,, great resistance was very often en-\ncountered, and little progress was sometimes made for weeks\nat a time. It was apparently in order to help me over these\ndifficulties that A voluntarily offered to tell me how to find\n\" Milly asleep.\" \" She knows everything,\" A said, \" and she\nwill tell you everything, if you do as I say.\" And A's pro-\ngnostication was on the whole correct. Resistances were still\nmet with, but in the end all the episodes of which AG., could\nonly recover fragments were filled out in detail by Ma.\nConcurrently with the revelation of the emotional shocks\nwhich had led to disintegration of personality. Milly's health\nrecovered. But I must add that, all through the later period\nof treatment, as at the beginning, suggestion was employed.\nAfter the psycho-analysis had reached a certain point the\nhemianalgesia was again made to disappear by suggestion and\nno untoward results followed. Very likely from the Freudian\npoint of view the analysis was incomplete, but I had attained\nmy end, and Milly became to all appearance a normal healthy\nwoman. And so she remains. The phases A, AG, and Ma\ncan still be obtained, but their spontaneous manifestations have,\nso far as I know, ceased.\n\f312 Professor Sigm. Freud, 31. D. [part\nIII.\nA NOTE ON THE UNCONSCIOUS IN PSYCHO-ANALYSIS.\nBy Professor SIGM. FREUD, M.D., LL.D. (Vienna).\nI wish to expound in a few words and as plainly as possible\nwhat the term \" unconscious \" has come to mean in Psycho-\nanalysis and in Psycho-analysis alone.\nA conception\u2014or any other psychical element\u2014which is\nnow -present to my consciousness may become absent the next\nmoment, and may become present again, after an interval,\nunchanged, and, as we say, from memory, not as a result of\na fresh perception by our senses. It is this fact which we are\naccustomed to account for by the supposition that during the\ninterval the conception has been present in our mind,\nalthough latent in consciousness. In what shape it may have\nexisted while present in the mind and latent in consciousness\nwe have no means of guessing.\nAt this very point we may be prepared to meet with the\nphilosophical objection that the latent conception did not exist\nas an object of psychology, but as a physical disposition for\nthe recurrence of the same psychical phenomenon, i.e. of the\nsaid conception. But we may reply that this is a theory far\noverstepping the domain of psychology proper ; that it simply\nbegs the question by asserting \" conscious \" to be an identical\nterm with \" psychical,\" and that it is clearly at fault in denying\npsychology the right to account for its most common facts,\nsuch as memory, by its own means.\nNow let us call \" conscious \" the conception which is present\nto our consciousness and of which we are aware, and let this\nbe the only meaning of the term \" conscious.\" As for latent\n\flxvi.] A Note on the Unconscious in Psycho-Analysis. 313\nconceptions, if we have any reason to suppose that they exist\nin the mind\u2014as we had in the case of memory,\u2014let them be\ndenoted by the term \" unconscious.\"\nThus an unconscious conception is one of which we are not\naware, but the existence of which we are nevertheless ready\nto admit on account of other proofs or signs.\nThis might be considered an uninteresting piece of descriptive\nor classificatory work if no experience appealed to our judg-\nment other than the facts of memory, or the cases of\nassociation by unconscious links. The well-known experiment,\nhowever, of \" the post-hypnotic suggestion \" teaches us to insist\nupon the importance of the distinction between conscious and\nunconscious, and seems to increase its value.\nIn this experiment, as performed by Bernheim, a person is\nput into a hypnotic state and is subsequently aroused. While\nhe was in the hypnotic state, under the influence of the\nphysician, he was ordered to execute a certain action at a\ncertain fixed moment after his awakening, say half-an-hour\nlater. He awakes, and seems fully conscious and in his\nordinary condition ; he has no recollection of his hypnotic\nstate, and yet at the pre-arranged moment there rushes into\nhis mind the impulse to do such and such a thing, and he\ndoes it consciously, though not knowing why. It seems\nimpossible to give any other description of the phenomenon\nthan to say that the order had been present in the mind of\nthe person in a condition of latency, or had been present\nunconsciously, until the given moment came, and then had\nbecome conscious. But not the whole of it emerged into\nconsciousness : only the conception of the act to be executed.\nAll the other ideas associated with this conception,\u2014the order,\nthe influence of the physician, the recollection of the hypnotic\nstate, remained unconscious even then.\nBut we have more to learn from such an experiment. We\nare led from the purely descriptive to a dynamic view of the\nphenomenon. The idea of the action ordered in hypnosis not\nonly became an object of consciousness at a certain moment,\nbut the more striking aspect of the fact is that this idea grew\nactive : it was translated into action as soon as consciousness\nbecame aware of its presence. The real stimulus to the action\nbeing the order of the physician, it is hard not to concede\n\f314 Professor Sigm. Freud, M.D. [part\nthat the idea of the physician's order became active too.\nYet this last idea did not reveal itself to consciousness, as did\nits outcome, the idea of the action ; it remained unconscious,\nand so it was active and 'unconscious at the same time.\nA post-hypnotic suggestion is a laboratory production, an\nartificial fact. But if we adopt the theory of hysterical\nphenomena first put forward by P. Janet and elaborated by\nBreuer and myself, we shall not be at a loss for plenty of\nnatural facts showing the psychological character of the post-\nhypnotic suggestion even more clearly and distinctly.\nThe mind of the hysterical patient is full of active yet\nunconscious ideas ; all her symptoms proceed from such ideas.\nIt is in fact the most striking character of the hysterical\nmind to be ruled by them. If the hysterical woman vomits,\nshe may do so from the idea of being pregnant. She has,\nhowever, no knowledge of this idea, although it can easily be\ndetected in her mind, and made conscious to her, by one of\nthe technical procedures of Psycho-analysis. If she is executing\nthe jerks and movements constituting her \"fit,\" she does not\neven consciously represent to herself the intended actions, and\nshe may perceive those actions with the detached feelings of\nan onlooker. Nevertheless analysis will show that she was\nacting her part in the dramatic reproduction of some incident\nin her life, the memory of which was unconsciously active\nduring the attack. The same preponderance of active un-\nconscious ideas is revealed by analysis as the essential fact in\nthe psychology of all other forms of neurosis.\nWe learn therefore by the analysis of neurotic phenomena\nthat a latent or unconscious idea is not necessarily a weak\none, and that the presence of such an idea in the mind admits\nof indirect proofs of the most cogent kind, which are equivalent\nto the direct proof furnished by consciousness. We feel justified\nin making our classification agree with this addition to our\nknowledge by introducing a fundamental distinction between\ndifferent kinds of latent or unconscious ideas. We were\naccustomed to think that every latent idea was so because it\nwas weak and that it grew conscious as soon as it became\nstrong. We have now gained the conviction that there are\nsome latent ideas which do not penetrate into consciousness,\nhowever strong they may have become. Therefore we may\n\flxvi.] A Note on the Unconscious in Psycho-Analysis. 315\ncall the latent ideas of the first type foreconscious, while we\nreserve the term unconscious (proper) for the latter type which\nwe came to study in the neuroses. The term unconscious,\nwhich was used in the purely descriptive sense before, now\ncomes to imply something more. It designates not only latent\nideas in general, but especially ideas with a certain dynamic\ncharacter, ideas keeping apart from consciousness in spite of\ntheir intensity and activity.\nBefore continuing my exposition I will refer to two objections\nwhich are likely to be raised at this point. The first of these\nmay be stated thus : instead of subscribing to the hypothesis\nof unconscious ideas of which we know nothing, we had better\nassume that consciousness can be split up, so that certain\nideas or other psychical acts may constitute a consciousness\napart, which has become detached and estranged from the\nbulk of conscious psychical activity. Well-known pathological\ncases like that of Dr. Azam seem to go far to show that the\nsplitting up of consciousness is no fanciful imagination.\nI venture to urge against this theory that it is a gratuitous\nassumption, based on the abuse of the word \" conscious.\" We\nhave no right to extend the meaning of this word so far as\nto make it include a consciousness of which its owner himself\nis not aware. If philosophers find difficulty in accepting the\nexistence of unconscious ideas, the existence of an unconscious\nconsciousness seems to me even more objectionable. The cases\ndescribed as splitting of consciousness, like Dr. Azam's, might\nbetter be denoted as shifting of consciousness,\u2014that function\u2014or\nwhatever it be\u2014oscillating between two different psychical com-\nplexes which become conscious and unconscious in alternation.\nThe other objection that may probably be raised would be\nthat we apply to normal psychology conclusions which are\ndrawn chiefly from the study of pathological conditions. We\nare enabled to answer it by another fact, the knowledge of\nwhich we owe to psycho-analysis. Certain deficiencies of function\nof most frequent occurrence among healthy people, e.g. lapsus\nlinguae, errors in memory and speech, forgetting of names, etc.,\nmay easily be shown to depend on the action of strong un-\nconscious ideas in the same way as neurotic symptoms. We\nshall meet with another still more convincing argument at a\nlater stage of this discussion.\n\f316 Professor Sigm. Freud, M.D. [part\nBy the differentiation of foreconscious and unconscious ideas,\nwe are led on to leave the field of classification and to form\nan opinion about functional and dynamical relations in psychical\naction. We have found a foreconscious activity passing into\nconsciousness with no difficulty, and an unconscious activity\nwhich remains so and seems to be cut off from conscious-\nness.\nNow we do not know whether these two modes of psychical\nactivity are identical or essentially divergent from their\nbeginning, but we may ask why they should become different\nin the course of psychical action. To this last question psycho-\nanalysis gives a clear and unhesitating answer. It is by no\nmeans impossible for the product of unconscious activity to\npierce into consciousness, but a certain amount of exertion\nis needed for this task. When we try to do it in ourselves,\nwe become aware of a distinct feeling of repulsion which\nmust be overcome, and when we produce it in a patient we\nget the most unquestionable signs of what we call his resistance\nto it. So we learn that the unconscious idea is excluded from\nconsciousness by living forces which oppose themselves to its\nreception, while they do not object to other ideas, the fore-\nconscious ones. Psyche-analysis leaves no room for doubt\nthat the repulsion from unconscious ideas is only provoked by\nthe tendencies embodied in their contents. The next and most\nprobable theory which can be formulated at this stage of our\nknowledge is the following. Unconsciousness is a regular and\ninevitable phase in the processes constituting our psychical\nactivity ;\nevery psychical act begins as an unconscious one,\nand it may either remain so or go on developing into con-\nsciousness, according as it meets with resistance or not. The\ndistinction between foreconscious and unconscious activity is\nnot a primary one, but comes to be established after repulsion\nhas sprung up. Only then the difference between fore-conscious\nideas, which can appear in consciousness and reappear at\nany moment, and unconscious ideas which cannot do so\ngains a theoretical as well as a practical value. A rough but\nnot inadequate analogy to this supposed relation of conscious\nto unconscious activity might be drawn from the field of\nordinary photography. The first stage of the photograph is\nthe \" negative \"\n;\nevery photographic picture has to pass through\n\flxvi.] A Note on the Unconscious in Psycho- Analysis. 317\nthe \" negative process,\" and some of these negatives which\nhave held good in examination are admitted to the \" positive\nprocess \" ending in the picture.\nBut the distinction between foreconscious and unconscious\nactivity, and the recognition of the barrier which keeps them\nasunder, is not the last or the most important result of the\npsycho-analytic investigation of psychical life. There is one\npsychical product to be met with in the most normal persons,\nwhich yet presents a very striking analogy to the wildest produc-\ntions of insanity, and was no more intelligible to philosophers than\ninsanity itself. I refer to dreams. Psycho-analysis is founded\nupon the analysis of dreams ; the interpretation of dreams is the\nmost complete piece of work the young science has done up to\nthe present. One of the most common types of dream-forma-\ntion may be described as follows : a train of thoughts has\nbeen aroused by the working of the mind in the daytime,\nand retained some of its activity, escaping from the general\ninhibition of interests which introduces sleep and constitutes\nthe psychical preparation for sleeping. During the night this\ntrain of thoughts succeeds in finding connections with one of\nthe unconscious tendencies present ever since his childhood in\nthe mind of the dreamer, but ordinarily repressed and excluded\nfrom his conscious life. By the borrowed force of this un-\nconscious help, the thoughts, the residue of the day's work,\nnow become active again, and emerge into consciousness in\nthe shape of the dream. Now three things have happened\n(1) The thoughts have undergone a change, a disguise and\na distortion, which represents the part of the un-\nconscious helpmate.\n(2) The thoughts have occupied consciousness at a time\nwhen they ought not.\n(3) Some part of the unconscious, which could not other-\nwise have done so, has emerged into consciousness.\nWe have learnt the art of finding out the \" residual thoughts,\"\nthe latent thoughts of the dream, and, by comparing them with\nthe apparent dream, we are able to form a judgment on the\nchanges they underwent and the manner in which these were\nbrought about.\nThe latent thoughts of the dream differ in no respect from\nthe products of our regular conscious activity ;\nthey deserve\n\f318 Professor Sigm. Freud, M.D. [part\nthe name of foreconscious thoughts, and may indeed have been\nconscious at some moment of waking life. But, by entering\ninto connection with the unconscious tendencies during the\nnight, they have become assimilated to the latter, degraded as\nit were to the condition of unconscious thoughts, and sub-\njected to the laws by which unconscious activity is governed.\nAnd here is the opportunity to learn what we could not have\nguessed from speculation, or from another source of empirical\ninformation,\u2014that the laws of unconscious activity differ widely\nfrom those of the conscious. We gather in detail what the\npeculiarities of the Unconscious are, and we may hope to learn\nstill more about them by a profounder investigation of the\nprocesses of dream-formation.\nThis enquiry is not yet half finished, and an exposition of\nthe results obtained hitherto is scarcely possible without entering\ninto the most intricate problems of dream-analysis. But I\nwould not break off this discussion without indicating the\nchange and progress in our comprehension of the Unconscious\nwhich are due to our psycho-analytic study of dreams.\nUnconsciousness seemed to us at first only an enigmatical\ncharacteristic of a definite psychical act. Now it means more\nfor us. It is a sign that this act partakes of the nature of\na certain psychical category known to us by other and more\nimportant characters, and that it belongs to a system of\npsychical activity which is deserving of our fullest attention.\nThe index-value of the unconscious has far outgrown its im-\nportance as a property. The system revealed by the sign\nthat the single acts forming parts of it are unconscious we\ndesignate by the name \" The Unconscious,\" for want of a\nbetter and less ambiguous term. In German, I propose to\ndenote this system by the letters Ubw, an abbreviation of the\nGerman word \" Unbewusst.\" And this is the third and most\nsignificant sense which the term \" unconscious \" has acquired in\npsycho-analysis.\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious.\nIV.\nTHE THEORY OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS.\nBy BORIS SIDIS, M.A., Ph.D., M.D.\n(Sidis Psychotherapeutic Institute, Portsmouth, N.H. ).\nCHAPTER I.\nTHE SUBCONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION.\nPlato put on the portals of his academy the inscription, \" No\none can enter here without a knowledge of geometry.\" Similarly\nno one can gain access to the facts of abnormal psychology\nwithout a thorough understanding of the subconscious. The\nsubconscious may be briefly defined as mental processes of\nwhich the individual is not directly conscious. The general\ndrift of my Psychology of Suggestion is the description of the\nsubconscious as a diffused consciousness below the margin of\npersonal consciousness. I sometimes use the term subconscious\nself. I designate by \" self \" not personal consciousness, but mere\nconsciousness. In Multiple Personality, in which I develop the\ntheory of thresholds in regard to the phenomena of normal and\nabnormal mental life, I define the subconscious as consciousness\nbelow the threshold of attentive personal consciousness. I find\nthat my clinical and psychological investigations more and\nmore confirm me in the view of the subconscious advanced\nby me in The Psychology of Suggestion. I am pleased to find\nthat Prof. James, in a recent article, accepts the same view,\nand advances the same theory of threshold in regard to the\nsubconscious. \" Nobody knows,\" he writes, \" how far we are\n'\nmarginally ' conscious of these memories, concepts and cona-\ntional states at ordinary times, or how far beyond the '\nmargin\n\f320 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nof our present thought trans-marginal consciousness of them\nmay exist.\"\nIn my Psychology of Suggestion I pointed out the difficulties\nof the purely physiological interpretation of the subconscious.\nSince this view still lingers among some psychologists, I\ncannot do better than reproduce the passage verbatim (pp. 118\net seq.)\nThe facts of hypnotic memory alone strongly indicate the intel-\nligent nature of the subconscious. Can the theory of unconscious\ncerebration explain, for instance, the fact of suggested amnesia\nduring hypnosis 1 I hypnotize Mr. V. F. and make him pass\nthrough many lively scenes and actions. I give him hypnotic and\nposthypnotic suggestions. The subject is wakened and hypnotized\ntime and again. At last he is put into a hypnotic state, and it\nis suggested that on awakening he shall not remember anything of\nwhat had happened in the state of hypnosis. The subject, on\nemerging from his trance, remembers nothing of what he has\npassed through. I then put my hand on his forehead and tell him\nin a commanding voice, \"You remember now everything.\" As if\ntouched by the wand of a magician, the suppressed memories\nbecome endowed with life and movement, and invade the con-\nsciousness of the subject. Everything is now clearly remembered,\nand the subject is able to relate the tale of his adventures without\nthe omission of the least incident. So detailed is the account that\none cannot help wondering at the extraordinary memory displayed\nby the subject. How is the theory of unconscious cerebration to\naccount for this strange fact ? Prof. Ziehen, in his Physiological\nPsychology, tells us that \"it is still a matter of doubt whether,\ndespite their complicatedness, all the facts of the hypnotized individual\nare not motions accomplished without any concomitant psychical\nprocesses,\" and that \"even the recollection of the hypnotic psychical\nprocesses do not necessarily argue in favour of their existence\nduring the hypnotic trance.\" This extreme view is certainly wrong,\nfor the subject during hypnosis not only acts, moves, but he also\nspeaks, answers questions intelligently, reasons, discusses; and if\nsuch an individual may be regarded as a mere machine, on the\nsame grounds we may consider any rational man as a mere\nunconscious automaton.\nThe advocates of unconscious cerebration must admit at least\nthis much, that hypnosis is a conscious state. Now, on the theory\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 321\nof unconscious cerebration, it is truly inconceivable how psychical\nstates can be suppressed, the accompanying physiological processes\nalone being left, and all that done by a mere word of the experi-\nmenter. The restoration of memory is still more incomprehensible\nthan the suggested amnesia. A command by the experimenter,\n\" Now you can remember,\" brings into consciousness a flood of\nideas and images. It is not that the experimenter gives the subject\na clue which starts the train of particular images and ideas ; but\nthe mere general, abstract suggestion, \"You can remember,\" is\nsufficient to restore memories which to all appearances have com-\npletely vanished from the mind of the subject. Are the unconscious\nphysiological nervous modifications so intelligent as to understand\nsuggestions and follow them 1 Does unconscious cerebration under-\nstand the command of the experimenter, and does it oblige him to\nbecome conscious ? On closer examination, we find the term uncon-\nscious cerebration to be of so loose a nature that under its head\nare often recorded facts that clearly indicate the working of an\nintelligence. Thus, Mr. Charles M. Child brings the following fact\nas a specimen of unconscious cerebration :\n\" I had earnestly been\ntrying,\" a gentleman writes to Mr. Child, \"to make a trial balance,\nand at last left off working, the summary of the Dr. and Cr. sides\nof the account showing a difference of \u00a32 10s., the Dr. side being\nso much smaller. The error I had not found on Saturday night\nwhen I left the counting-house. On this same Saturday night I\nretired feeling nervous and angry with myself. Some time in the\nnight I dreamed thus : I was seated at my desk in the counting-\nhouse and in a good light ;\neverything was orderly and natural,\nthe ledger lying before me. I was looking over the balance of the\naccounts and comparing them with the sums in the trial-balance\nsheet. Soon I came to a debit balance of \u00a32 10s. I looked at it,\ncalled myself sundry names, spoke to myself in a deprecating manner\nof my own eyes, and at last put the \u00a32 10s. to its proper side of\nthe trial-balance sheet and went home. I arose at the usual Sunday\ntime, dressed carefully, breakfasted, went to call on some . . . friends\nto go to church. Suddenly the dream flashed on my memory. I\nwent for the keys, opened the office, also the safe, got the ledger,\nand turned to the folio my dream had indicated. There was the\naccount whose balance was the sum wanted which I had omitted\nto put in the balance-sheet, where it was put now, and my year's\nposting proved correct.\"\nThe adherents of unconscious cerebration tacitly include under\nx\n\f322 Boris Sidis, M.I). [part\nthis term not only unconscious physiological processes, or nerve\nmodifications, but also psychical states. Keeping clearly in mind\nthe real meaning of unconscious cerebration as referring to physio-\nlogical processes, or nerve modifications with no psychical accom-\npaniment, the difficulties of unconscious cerebration to account for\nthe phenomena of hypnotic memory become truly insurmountable.\nFor if the physiological processes subsumed under the category of\nunconscious cerebration are completely lacking in all psychical elements\nwhatever, how can a general abstract negative jjhrase, \" You cannot\nremember,\" suppress particular psychical states, and how can a\nsimilar positive phrase, \" You can remember,\" bring the forgotten\nmemories back to consciousness % It is simply incomprehensible.\nFurthermore, while the subject is in a hypnotic condition, we can\nsuggest to him that on awakening he shall not remember anything,\nbut when put to the automatic recorder he shall be able to write\neverything that has taken place in the state of hypnosis. The\nsubject is then awakened : he remembers nothing at all of what\nhe has passed through while in the state of hypnotic trance. As\nsoon, however, as he is put to the automatic recorder the hand\ngives a full rational account of all the events. If now you ask\nthe subject what it is he has written, he stares at you in confusion;\nhe knows nothing at all of the writing. How shall we account for\nthis fact on the theory of unconscious cerebration ? Can unconscious\nphysiological processes write rational discourses 1 It is simply\nwonderful, incomprehensible.\nThese, however, are not the only difficulties which the theory of\nunconscious cerebration has to encounter. Take the following\nexperiment : I gave Mr. V. F. the suggestion that on awakening\nhe should put my coat on three times, take it off, and put it on\nagain ; that he should do it when he heard a signal which should\nbe a knock ; amnesia was suggested and also the possibility of\nwriting the suggestion. The subject was then roused from his\ntrance. There was not the slightest recollection of what had been\nsuggested, but when he was put to the automatic recorder the hand\nat once proceeded to write everything. In the middle of the writing,\n\" when a signal will be given . . .,\" I stopped the subject and asked\nhim what he was writing about. \"I do not know,\" he answered.\n\" How is it,\" I asked again, \" you write and do not know what\nyou write 1 \" \"I do not know, I think it was something about a\ncoat.\" \"What was it you were writing about a coat?\" \"I do not\nknow, maybe it was about the make of a coat.\" Then when the signal\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 323\ncame, he rose and put on the coat three times. To take another\nexperiment of the same kind : I give the subject the suggestion\nthat he should bow to the gas whenever the door should be opened ;\nagain amnesia is suggested, with the possibility of writing. The\nsubject is stopped when he finished his account. \" What was it\nyou wrote?\" I asked. The subject looked surprised. I repeated\nmy question. \" I do not know, I think something about a door.\"\n\" What was it about a door 1\" \"I do not know.\" I have made\nmany similar experiments, and all of them with the same results.\nIt is evident that the writing is not an unconscious automatic\nprocess, for the subject possesses a general knowledge of what he\nhas written, or even of what he is going to write. Now, on the\ntheory of unconscious cerebration this general knowledge ought to\nbe entirely lacking, since the physiological processes of the suppressed\nmemory have no psychical accompaniment. It would not do to say\nthat the subject knows each word as he writes it, but becomes\nunconscious of it, forgets it as soon as it is written down, because\nthe subject is able to tell the central idea; that is, he has a general\nknowledge of it, and, what is more, he is able to tell us this\ngeneral central idea even before he finishes the writing, \u2014in fact,\nhe can do it when stopped in the middle of the phrase. On the\ntheory of secondary consciousness, however, the experiments could\nnot possibly give other results. The secondary consciousness under-\nstands the suggestions given by the experimenter, accepts them,\nobeys the commands, keeps the suppressed memories, and sends up\na general knowledge of them to the upper consciousness, and if\ncommanded, communicates the suppressed particular suggestions in\nall their details.\nThe advocates of unconscious cerebration assume too much : they\nassume that normal memory, or recollection in the normal state,\ncan be fully accounted for by unconscious physiological processes,\nand the only thing required is to apply this theory to the phenomena\nof hypnotic memory. It would be well to examine this theory and\nsee how strong its claims are in the case of normal memory.\nMany a modern psycho-physiologist no doubt smiles at the crude,\nancient psycho-physiological theory of perception. Images or copies\nof objects emanate from objects, get deposited in the mind, hence\nperception, cognition, memory. The modern psycho-physiological\nspeculations, however, the speculations of Maudsley, Carpenter,\nZiehen, Eibot, etc., are no less crude. Thus, Ziehen, for instance,\nconceives that each sensation deposits a copy of itself, \u2014an image,\n\f324 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nan idea, in some one of the memory ganglion cells, and memory-\nconsists in the reproduction of this copy, \u2014the hen lays an egg from\nwhich another hen may come out. Maudsley expresses the same\nthing in slightly different terms; instead of \"deposits of images in\nmemory ganglion cells,\" he uses \" modifications of nerve elements.\"\n\" It may be supposed,\" says Maudsley, \" that the first activity did\nleave behind it, when it subsided, some after-effect, some modification\nof the nerve element, whereby the nerve circuit was disposed to fall\nagain readily into the same action, such disposition (unconscious)\nappearing in consciousness as recognition or memory.\" Ribot and\nmany other psychologists, with slight variations in minor points,\nfollow the same beaten track. All of them agree that it is the\nnerve modifications produced by the physiological processes of sensa-\ntions, emotions, etc., that constitute the basis, nay, the very essence,\nof memory itself. It does not require a close examination to find\nthe deficiencies of this theory. A mere modification left behind as\na trace cannot possibly explain memory, recollection, the fact of\nreferring a particular bit of experience to an experience felt before.\nThe retention of a trace or of a nervous modification, and the repro-\nduction of that trace or modification, cannot in the least account for\nthe fact that a series of sensations, ideas, images, emotions felt at\ndifferent times, should become combined, brought into a unity, felt like\nbeing similar, like being repetitions, copies of an original experience.\nIt is not retention or reproduction, but it is the recognition element\nthat constitutes the essentia of memory. The rose of to-day reminds me\nof the rose of yesterday, of the same rose seen the day before\nyesterday. Now the image of the rose may be retained, may even\nbe reproduced, but if it is not recognized as having happened in the\npast, there can be no recollection : in short, without recognition there\nis no memory. As Prof. James strongly puts it, \"the gutter is worn\ndeeper by each successive shower, but not for that reason brought\ninto contact with previous showers.\" Does the theory of unconscious\nphysiological processes, of material brain traces, of nerve modifica-\ntions, does the theory take into account this element of recognition'?\nCan the theory of unconscious cerebration offer the faintest suggestion\nas to how that element of recognition is brought about 1 What is\nthat something added to the unconscious physiological trace or nerve\nmodification that effects a conscious recognition ]\nFurthermore, first impressions can be localized in the past, but\nso can also each subsequent revival. How shall we explain on the\ntheory of unconscious physiological nerve registration that the original,\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 325\nthe primitive sense experience, as well as each subsequent revival,\ncan be referred to as distinct psychical facts. For if the structural\nnerve elements are slightly modified with each revival, how shall\nwe account for this psychical distinction of the original sense experi-\nence as well as of the modified revivals 1 The remembered experience\nleaves its own individual trace, then a trace of its being a copy of\na former original impression, and also a trace of its being a member\nin a series of similar traces, each trace being both a copy of another\nand a copy of the original impression. How all that is done is a\nmystery.\nThese objections advanced by me many years ago hold true\nof recent theories which fall back on the old views of Mill\nand Carpenter, namely, unconscious cerebration. The modern\nupholders of unconscious cerebration think that they have\ndiscovered new facts and arguments in favour of unconscious\nmental activity, and are thus justified in denying subconscious\nmental life. The arguments, as we have pointed out, are not\nnew, nor are the facts advanced in support of these arguments\ntrue. The same objections hold true in the case of the theory\nof unconscious cerebration offered us in the garb of nerve\ncurrents and nerve paths, well worn nerve tracks, opening and\nclosing of nerve currents and tracks, and formation of all shapes\nand forms of neurograms. Why be misled by figments and by\nsounds ? The subconscious stands for a number of facts, reactions,\nand behaviour which are accompanied by psychic life, by mental\nactivities, by consciousness.\nThe physiological unconscious registration theories of nerve\ncurrents, nerve-paths and neurograms are not only figments,\narbitrary fanciful weavings of the imagination, they cannot even\nhypothetically explain the simplest act of memory and especially\nof recognitive memory.\nSince the theories of unconscious registration fail us in the\nmost elementary mental processes, how can we possibly rely\non cerebration-fancies in the case of such complex phenomena\nas hypnotic conditions and various mental states of trance and\ndissociation ? The physiological theories such as unconscious\ncerebration and their modifications failing, we must use for all\nthose phenomena the psychological interpretation. The sub-\nconscious must be taken as a necessary theory in Psycho-\npathology, as atoms, molecules, electrons and ether are in\n\f326 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nChemistry and Physics. The subconscious is not an \" uncon-\nscious,\" it is not a physiological automatism. The subconscious\nis a consciousness, a secondary consciousness, a sort of secondary\nself, the self being understood by me as a diffused consciousness.\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE SUBCONSCIOUS AND AUTOMATISM.\nThe theory of unconscious cerebration dies hard. Recently a\nfew psychologists made an attempt to revive it. The argu-\nments advanced are rather philosophical than psychological.\nIt may be well to test the validity of these arguments. If we\nclear the ground of all superfluous speculations, we find two\nmain contentions. In the first place, it is assumed that many\nhypnotic and hysterical manifestations are solely the result of\nphysiological activities. It is claimed by some, such as\nMiinsterberg, that physiological processes without any psychic\naccompaniments, may reach such a high state of complexity\nas to account fully for all the observed manifestations in the\ndifferent forms of mental dissociations. In the second place, it\nis claimed, from a purely philosophical standpoint, that even in\nthe case of dissociation when consciousness may be granted to be\npresent, there is no dissociation in consciousness itself, since\nconsciousness is but a passive onlooker while the active changes\ngo on in the content of consciousness ; in other words, in\nstates of dissociation it is not consciousness that is changed,\nbut only the content of consciousness.\nLet us examine these contentions and see whether they\ncan stand the test of critical analysis. The view of regarding\nmental activity from a purely physiological standpoint is not\nnew, it dates as far back as Descartes, who regards all the\nanimals, with the exception of man, as mechanical automata.1\n1\nThe philosopher, Maiman, in his \"Autobiography\" tells an anecdote of\nhimself. In his youth Maiman was an ardent adherent of Cartesian automatism.\nDuring one of his strolls with a friend Maiman struck a goat. The animal\nbleated. The friend rebuked Maiman for his cruelty. Maiman laughed at the\nsimplicity of his friend. \u2014\" The goat is like a drum which sounds when it is\nbeaten.\"\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 327\nHuxley carried the view further, regarding consciousness as an\nepiphenonienon. The physiological mechanism is the engine,\nconsciousness is hut the whistle accompanying it. Of course,\nit goes without saying that all psychologists and physiologists\nat present take for granted that all states of consciousness are\naccompanied by physiological processes. Every thought, every\nfeeling, even the most complicated poetical inspirations, or the\nmost abstruse mathematical, logical and metaphysical specula-\ntions, have physiological processes as their accompaniments.\nWe are, however, hardly justified in carrying this postulate to\nthe absurdity of the total denial of consciousness, and regarding\nall adjustments and adaptations as so many chemical and\nmechanical reactions\n\u2014\"tropisms,\" as some modern biologists, such\nas Loeb and others, are apt to put it in the case of many\nanimals, a reversion to the Cartesian hypothesis of mechanical\nautomatism. Motor reactions can be regarded solely from the\nphysiological standpoint, but consciousness cannot be entirely ruled\nout. What probability is there that a play of atoms and electrons\nwould produce the Iliad, Hamlet, the Principia of Newton, the\nCelestial Mechanics of Laplace, or Darwin's Origin of Species ?\nEven if we descend to such motor reactions as are expressed\nin the compositions of a schoolboy, we still unhesitatingly assume\na conscious activity. We cannot refute the philosopher who\nwould regard all such manifestations as so many physiological\nprocesses without any conscious accompaniment. For though\nevery one is directly conscious of his own mental life, no one\ncan experience directly the mental life of another. We can-\nnot inspect directly the psychic processes that go on in other\nliving beings, or in our fellow men. Mind is inferred from\naction, from behaviour. Eeactions, adjustments to environment,\naccompanied by consciousness, by intelligence in us, are rightly\njudged to have the same accompaniment in other beings, in\nour neighbours. To deny consciousness to our neighbour, and\nto regard him as a physiological automaton, is to put oneself\nin the absurd position of denying the existence of states which\nare observed in ourselves under similar conditions. In fact the\nburden of proof falls on those who make such a denial.\nNow, in the case of hypnosis or various states of dissociation,\nwe meet with intelligent adjustments often expressed in gestures,\nwriting and speech. We can, by means of various methods, enter\n\f328 Boris Sidis, M.D [part\ninto active relationship with those dissociated activities unknown\nto the individual himself. We can obtain intelligent replies to\nour questions either by writing or by speaking or by other\narranged means of communication. What right have we to\ndeny consciousness in one case while we affirm it in another\ncase under similar circumstances ? When I receive a letter\nfrom my friend I regard the letter as having been written by\na being who possesses consciousness, but when a similar letter\nis written by a friend in a hypnotic or post-hypnotic state, we\nregard it as the result of physiological automatism, with no\nconscious accompaniment. It is clear that the denial of con-\nsciousness to the hypnotic individuality is purely arbitrary. It\nis certainly arbitrary in the case of double or multiple person-\nality to regard one personality as conscious and the other\npersonalities as purely automatic, with no consciousness in them.\nIt would have been more consistent if the psychologist were to\ntake the solipsistic point of view and deny consciousness to all\nelse except himself.\nThe arbitrary standpoint of the psychologist who denies\nsecondary and multiple consciousness can be still further\nmade clear in the case of coexistent, dissociated mental\nactivity. Thus one hand of the subject or of the patient may\nwrite a letter, while the other hand may be engaged in\ndrawing or writing a composition, of which the individual is\nnot cognizant. Both hands enter independently of each other\ninto communication with the external observer. The communi-\ncations are independent and equally intelligent. In each case\nwe get intelligent replies and reactions to our questions and\nstimulations. Which of the two is supposed to be conscious ?\nTo take a concrete experiment. Mr. M. presents pheno-\nmena of dissociation. When in one of those states of dis-\nsociation Mr. M. is made to write a letter with one hand,\nwhile the other hand, being anaesthetic, is put under a screen\nand made to carry out a calculation. One hand replies to ques-\ntions, while the other solves problems. Both hands give\nintelligent replies. To which of them is consciousness to be\nascribed ? If we deny it in one case, we should also deny it\nin the other. But, then, why not be consistent and deny it\nin every case of intelligent adjustment ? We realize how\narbitrary and illogical is the position of those psychologists\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 329\nwho coquet with physiology under the delusion that they\nare more scientific. They are led to take arbitrary positions\nwh ch lead into the pitfalls of solipsism, with all its contra-\ndictions and absurdities.\nBesides, physiological processes are, after all, but hypothetical\nconcepts ;\nphysiological currents are conceived after the model\nof electrical currents, and are by no means theoretically proven.\nWhile they should be used for the sake of a better elucidation\nof the facts, it is not good scientific sense to sacrifice to them\nthe very material of the science of psychology. Sensations,\nideas, feelings, emotions, are after all the direct data of the\npsychologist, while physiological processes and currents are\npurely hypothetical. Wben, therefore, these hypothetical exist-\nences lead not to a better understanding of the facts of\nmental life, but to their denial, the very purpose of the\nhypothetical creations is completely defeated.\nPhysiological processes are framed to explain states of con-\nsciousness with their motor reactions. When, therefore, these\nhypothetical creations threaten to sweep away the actual living\nfacts, it is time to halt and examine closely the sterile character\nof the hypothesis. The central fallacy lies in the tacit assump-\ntion that unknown and possibly unknowable, highly problematical\nbrain currents, with their \" opening and closing valves,\" with\n\"well worn or blocked paths,\" all of a purely conjectural character,\nhave, by their ingenious complexity, become, like marionettes, so\nmarvellously endowed with sense-like activities as to dispense\ncompletely with the mental states which these conceptional\nentities were called in to explain.\nClinical cases and experimental facts go further to invali-\ndate the theory of the purely physical interpretation of the\nsubconscious, or what may be described as automatism-\npsychology. If anything is of the utmost importance in\nmental life, it is surely memory. Memory forms a unity of\nour life, brings, so to speak, to a focus our life-experiences,\nwhich would have otherwise been disconnected, confused, and\nchaotic. I remember just now what I did an hour ago, a\nday ago, what I lived through many years ago. I remember\nthe experiences of my childhood, boyhood, and youth. I\nremember my struggles and disappointments, my loves, my\nfriendships, my enmities, my feelings, sentiments, emotions, ideas,\n\f330 Boris Sidia, 2f.D. [part\nand sensations. All these inter-connected, interlocked links of\nmemories form the solid chain of my conscious personality.\nIn my memory of the past experiences there is the present\nconsciousness that all that I had \"one through at the time\nof the experience\u2014any change, any modification, that had taken\nplace\u2014occurred in my mind, in my consciousness. Unless under\ndelusion or illusion of memory we cannot remember what did\nnot occur in consciousness. We cannot remember lohat we were\nnot conscious of. The past mental state which the present\nmemory refers to is a state of consciousness ; otherwise memory is\nimpossible and meaningless. Memory, recollection, reminiscence,\ncan only refer to a previous state of consciousness. Surely no one\nelse can have a better and more direct knowledge than I\nmyself have of the ideas, emotions, and moods that I remember,\nas experienced by me.\nThe memory factor is all the more important in psychology,\nsince we have to take account of the subject's inner experi-\nences. In each case of memory the burden of proof falls on\nthose who deny the validity of that memory, as referring to\na past state of consciousness. Suppose I have a memory in a\nfull state of consciousness that I lighted a lamp an hour ago,\nthe burden of proof would fall on those who deny the exist-\nence of such a state. It would be an arbitrary, if not pre-\nposterous, position for an outside observer to claim that the\nlighting of the lamp was carried out mechanically, by a physio-\nlogical automatism, and that the subsequent memory was but\nan illusion. The onus of proof that the original act had\nno conscious accompaniment is entirely on those who take\nsuch a position in opposition to the direct introspective\naccount. Where such a proof is not forthcoming, the position\ntaken is arbitrary. Were we to take such a preposterous\nposition, the very science of psychology would become an\nimpossibility, since all memory would have to be declared a\nsnare and a delusion. All psychological studies based on intro-\nspection and memory would have to be abandoned, and we\nshould have to follow Comte, and declare psychology an\nimpossibility. A psychologist maintaining such a point of\nview is, from the very nature of his position, disqualified to\ngive his opinion ; he must fall back on physiology, and rule\nout all psychology.\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 331\nIf, however, memory and introspection are not rejected, then\nthe recollection of a conscious state should not be arbitrarily\ndismissed, unless there are good reasons for such a dismissal. Now,\nthe hypnotic subject, or the patient, in the case of functional\npsychosis, undergoes an experience of which he is apparently\nunconscious. In a subsequent state, in a hypnotic or trance\nstate, he actually recollects that the experience was a con-\nscious one ; we cannot possibly reject this recollection as an\nillusion of memory. The burden of proof that the former\nstate was not a conscious one falls on him who denies the\nperson's mental experience. Such a proof is all the more\nrequisite since it can be demonstrated that in subconscious\nstates there is really present a subconscious consciousness.\nCHAPTER III.\nTHE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE PASSIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.\nDriven out of the psychological fortress, some psychologists of\nthe philosophical type (Miinsterberg) still take refuge in the\nmetaphysical citadel. It is claimed that psychologically mental\nlife is analyzed into consciousness and its content. Now, it\nis further assumed that all mental modifications occur in\nmental contents, but not in consciousness. Consciousness,\nitself, is supposed to be a passive, immutable looker-on, a sort\nof psychic deity. We thus have a mental content which is\nnot conscious and a consciousness which has no content, a\nsort of vacant entity resembling the blessed Buddha in his\nblissful state of Nirvana. Consciousness is regarded in the\nlight of a substance which contains the mental content some-\nwhat after the fashion of a material substance underlying\nphysical qualities. This view of an underlying, immutable\nsubstance, with a changing qualitative content, was long ago\ncriticized by Hume, both in the case of mind and body.\nThe assumption of an entity underlying observed phenomena,\nwhether physical or mental, has since become so weakened\nthat it is no longer regarded as a living hypothesis among\nthinking men of science.\n\f332 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nWe can see at a glance that the substance-consciousness\nwith its changing qualitative content is but a piece of\nmetaphysical speculation, it is a revival of the old soul-\nhypothesis, long ago buried by analytic and experimental\npsychologists. The soul-consciousness hypothesis must be re-\njected, for the simple reason that it complicates matters and\nexplains nothing. In fact, the hypothesis of an imperturbable\nsoul -consciousness, from the very nature of its hypothetical\nbeing, itself requires an explanation, while it does not in the\nleast explain the mental content, which is the material of the\npsychologist. Such a passive, changeless soul-consciousness is\na sort of box in which the content of soul-consciousness\nresides and has its being. This soul-consciousness is but a\nsurvival from a past metaphysical period.\nIn the case of double and multiple personalities it is claimed\nthat, while the personalities are different, their consciousness\nis not different, but one and the same. In the different\npersonalities found in the case of multiple personality, there is\namong them but one consciousness, somewhat like the Greek\nmyth of the three old women with one eye among them. By\na parity of reasoning we may say that the minds of\ndifferent individuals, such as John's and Peter's, are really\nidentical. John and Peter are different personalities with\ndifferent contents, but with the same consciousness. In fact,\nwe may generalize further and say that the whole human race\nand the beasts of the field and the birds of the air share\nin one and the same indivisible, passive, immutable conscious-\nness, a sort of world-soul. This may be a grand metaphysical\nspeculation, but it is neither psychological nor scientific.\nThere is another objection to the subconscious, an objection\nbased on an artificial fast and hard line drawn between the\npurpose of science on the one hand, and that of will on the\nother. Science, it is claimed, deals with artificial concepts,\nwhile personal will is concerned with the real values of life.\nIt is claimed that the concept of the subconscious is illegitimate,\nbecause it involves a confusion of this metaphysical double\nbookkeeping.\nThe world of description and the world of appreciation\nwere brought out and contrasted by Professor Koyce in his\nearly works, and afterwards elaborated by a few psychologists\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 333\nof the Schopenhauerian tinge. The division is not new, and\ndates back to the Middle Ages, with its split of science\nand philosophy on the one hand, and religion on the other.\nIt is the doctrine of the two-fold truth (Die Lehre von der\nzweifachen Wahrheit). According to mediaeval thought, there\nare two realms, the realm of knowledge and the realm of\nfaith ; the realm of intellect and the realm of will. What\nis true in the one may not be true in the other. From\nMaimonides, Ibn Gabirol, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas\nto Duns Scotus and Occam the same doctrine of the two-fold\ntruth and the two reals prevailed. The scholastic could say\nanything he wished provided he was cautious to claim that\nwhat was true secundum rationem was not true secundum\nJidem.\nThis double view still survives in some philosophical quarters.\nInstead of finding fault with the subconscious for ignoring\nthis time-honoured double truth, it should rather be regarded\nas a special merit. As a matter of fact, the subconscious,\nunless interpreted in metaphysical terms of a cosmic self, has\nnothing to do with the heirloom of metaphysical mediaeval\nthought. The subconscious is based on experience and facts\nto which philosophical and metaphysical distinctions should\nadapt themselves.\nWe thus find that the objections to the subconscious are\nbased on insufficient grounds. We also find that the abandon-\nment of the subconscious leads to a tangle of difficulties and\nto the quagmire of mediaeval metaphysics. If the metaphysical\ninterpretation of the subconscious in the sense of a cosmic\nself lands one in the misty regions of religious mysticism,\nthe opposite view of the total negation of the subconscious,\napparently in the interests of science, lands one in regions\nno less shadowy, regions of naturalistic mysticism.\nSo fundamental, however, is the concept of the subconscious\nthat even its opponents have to admit it under different\nnames. They admit the fact of dissociation, of dissociated\nmental systems, and of dissociated personalities. But they\nput forth the hypothetical claim that it is one and the same\nconsciousness present in all the different forms of dissociation.\nNow, if we omit that speculative metaphysical consciousness which,\nbeing inactive and unchangeable, is of no use in scientific\n\f334 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nwork, we are really left with the mutations and permutations\nof mental systems which, from their very nature, must he\nconscious. The psychopathologist must postulate the subcon-\nscious just as the geometrician postulates space and position,\nor as the physicist postulates matter and force.\nCHAPTER IV.\nSUBCONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS IDEAS.\nThere is a school which regards the subconscious as formed\nof \" suppressed mental complexes.\" The views of this school\nare not psychologically clear. It seems, however, that the\nsubconscious is viewed in the light of \" unconscious ideas.\"\n\" Unconscious Ideas \" were discussed by me in my Psychology\nof Suggestion, and I cannot do better than to quote from that\nvolume, \" For the mechanism of consciousness is hidden deep\ndown in the depths of the subconscious, and it is thither we\nhave to descend in order to get a clear understanding of the\nphenomena that appear in the broad daylight of consciousness.\"\nThe German school, with Wundt at its head, at first started\nout on similar lines, but they could not make any use of the\nsubconscious, and their speculations ran wild in the fancies of\nHartmann. The reason of this failure is due to the fact that\nthe concept of the subconscious as conceived by the German\nschool was extremely vague, and had rather the character of\na mechanical than that of a psychical process. An unconscious\nconsciousness\u2014that was their concept of the subconscious. In\nsuch a form as this the subconscious was certainly meaningless\n\u2014mere nonsense\u2014and had to be given up. The German\npsychological investigations are now confined to the content\nof consciousness in so far as the individual is immediately\nconscious of it. But as this form of consciousness is extremely\nnarrow and circumscribed, the results arrived at, though re-\nmarkable for their thoroughness, are, after all, of a rather\ntrivial nature. It is what Prof. James aptly characterizes\nas \" the elaboration of the obvious.\"\nThis criticism applies well to Freud and his adherents.\n\flxvi.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 335\nDas Unbevmsstc is conceived as \" Suppressed unconscious idea-\ncomplexes.\" Of course, the claims of that school to originality\nand to the apparent unveiling of the causation of psycho-\nneurosis are entirely unjustified. A \" suppressed complex \" is\nbut another term for a dissociated system, commonly accepted\nin Psychopathology. The special theories developed by that\nschool in regard to desire, to sexuality and to voluntary sup-\npression of unpleasant or painful ideas are highly questionable\nin the light of psychology and clinical experience.\nThis German school of Psychopathology has unfortunately\nfallen back on the Herbartian psychology with its metaphysical\nEeals or ideas which by their mutual tension keep suppressing\none another, thus determining the display of the contents of\nconsciousness. As Herbart tells us :\n\" Concepts become forces\nwhen they resist one another. This resistance occurs when\ntwo or more opposed concepts encounter one another.\" This\nproposition or principle proclaimed by Herbart is at the basis\nof Freud's psychology. \" A concept is in consciousness in so\nfar as it is not suppressed,\" Herbart tells us, \" but is in actual\nrepresentation. When it rises out of complete suppression, it\nenters into consciousness.\" According to Herbart and his modern\nfollowers, suppressed ideas become forces and impulses. Con-\ncepts which are not opposed or contrasted with one another,\nso far as they meet unhindered, form a \" complex,\" a favourite\nterm used by the German school and their followers.\nIt may possibly be of interest to remark that Herbart is\nclosely followed by the German school of Psychopathology in\nregard to the doctrine of desire. Desire with Herbart is\nfundamental. \" The faculty of desire must include wishes,\ninstincts, and every species of longing.\" \" The expression\n'\ndesire ' must not be so limited as to exclude those wishes\nwhich remain, though they may be vain, or so-called pious\nwishes, and which, for the very reason that they do remain,\nconstantly incite men to new efforts, because through them\nthe thought of a possibility is ever anew suggested, in spite\nof all reasons which appear to prove the impossibility of\nattainment. It is very important to give the concept of the\nunattainability of the wished-for object strength enough so\nthat a peaceful renunciation may take place of the desire.\nA man dreams of a desirable future for himself, even when\n\f336 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nhe knows it will never come.\" These Herbartian doctrines,\nlong ago abandoned by psychology, are now being revived by\nthe German school of Psychopathology as a new discovery in\nthe science of normal and abnormal psychology. No better\ncriticism can be passed on this revival of Herbartian psychology\nin the domain of Psychopathology than the one made by Prof.\nJames :\n\" I must confess that to my mind there is something\nalmost hideous in the glib Herbartian jargon about Vorstellung-\nmassen and their Hcmmungcn (suppressions) and sinken and\nerheben and schweben and Verschmelzungen and Complexionen\n(complexes).\"\nIt is claimed by some of Freud's younger adherents that\nthe mechanism of \" unconscious ideas,\" though a contradiction,\nis nevertheless justified, because of its being a conceptual con-\nstruct, as Karl Pearson puts it, in order to aid the explanation\nof mental phenomena. This is a new epistemological argument\nin defence of a tottering system. It is truly amazing that\nscience has nowadays become so philosophical that when a\ntheory is unstable, it is unhesitatingly supported by epistemo-\nlogical considerations.\nPerhaps it may be well to point out that self-contra-\ndictory hypotheses are not quite acceptable in science. A\nscientific hypothesis should at least have the merit of being\nrational, logical, and not conceived in a wild harum-scarum\nfashion. A good scientific hypothesis must have restrictions\nand definite conditions. I think it is Huxley who says\nthat in the case of stolen goods two hypotheses are at\nhand : one hypothesis is that an angel is responsible for it,\nand the other that a thief has carried off the goods. The angel-\nhypothesis is hardly considered by science. In other words,\nthe hypothetical causative agency must be conceived in terms\nof experience.\nThe hypothetical agency must either be a fact directly\nobserved in nature or a fact which can be verified later on.\nThus the theory of gravitation is based on the facts of falling\nbodies ; the theory of natural selection is based on the facts\nof the struggle for existence observed in the organic world.\nIn short, a good scientific hypothesis must take as its causative\nagency a vera causa, a fact observable in experience or a fact\nwhich can be verified by further experience. Atoms, electrons,\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 337\nether, are not haphazard constructs ;\nthey are not regarded by the\nphysicist as unreal fancies, unreal abstract notions to explain the\nreal facts ; but each of these hypothetical agents is regarded as\nreal, as a vera causa. We cannot help agreeing with J. S. Mill on\nthe subject of hypothesis :\n\" I conceive it to be necessary, when\nthe hypothesis relates to causation, that the supposed cause should\nnot only be a real phenomenon, something actually existing in\nnature, but should be already known to exercise, or at least\nto be capable of exercising, an influence of some sort over the\neffect. In any other case it is no sufficient evidence of the\ntruth of the hypothesis that we are able to deduce the real\nphenomenon from it.\" Again, \" What is true in [Newton's]\nmaxim is that the cause, though not known previously, should\nbe capable of being known thereafter ; that its existence should\nbe capable of being detected, and its connection with the effect\nascribed to it should be susceptible of being proved by indepen-\ndent evidence\" (Logic, p. 53).\nIf we apply this very simple rule of logic to the theory of\n\" unconscious ideas,\" we at once realize the illegitimate character\nof such a hypothesis. An idea is essentially of a conscious\nnature. To speak, therefore, of unconscious ideas, is to intro-\nduce into psychology the self-contradictory impossible concept\nof unconscious conscious ideas. This is equivalent to the\nassumption of an unconscious consciousness. An unconscious\nidea is neither a vera causa nor a fact ultimately to be verified.\nThe conception of an unconscious idea is like the conception of\na round square.\nMoreover it is not true, psychologically, that ideas\ncan be \" suppressed \" so that they become dissociated or\n\" unconscious.\" It is not true that we suppress painful ideas\ninto the \" unconscious.\" We do not forget our painful ideas.\nOn the contrary, painful ideas stand out all the more pro-\nminent in our consciousness. Pain hammers experience into the\nmind. In fact we may say with more right that it is the\npleasurable ideas that are forgotten, while the painful ideas are\nremembered. An experience associated with pain is never for-\ngotten. Like a splinter in the flesh, it remains in conscious-\nness to trouble us all our life long. It is due to other causes\nthat a painful experience becomes subconscious. Teleologically,\nwe can well see the importance of this fact.\nY\n\f338 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nIt would have been suicidal to the individual and ultimately to\nthe species, if painful experience were forgotten. The individual\nmust learn to avoid harmful objects and hurtful stimuli. This\ncan only be accomplished by actually remembering painful experi-\nences. That individual would survive who remembered best his\npainful experiences. Were it otherwise, the individual would\nbe very much in the condition of the proverbial silly bird\nthat hides its head at the sight of the hunter. The subjective\npainful experiences must be remembered ; a painful experience\nfixes the attention. On this fact was based the once universally\nrecognized method of training and education. What is fixed by\npain is never forgotten. What may bring about forgetfulness\nis either a constitutionally bad memory or a state of indifference,\nor an intense, paralyzing emotion of fear, especially in early\nchildhood. The whole theory of \" suppression \"\nof painful \" com-\nplexes \" is based on fcdsc clinical and psychological assumptions.\nNeither is there such a process as \" suppression of complexes,\"\nnor is there such a mental state as an \" unconscious idea.\"\nAn \" unconscious idea \" in the sense that the idea has\nno consciousness can have no meaning. If, however, by an\n\" unconscious idea \" is understood a consciousness of which the\nindividual or personal self is not conscious, then we come\naround to a subconscious consciousness, as developed by me in\nmy various works. A quotation from Hoffding may bring\nout my point in a clearer and stronger light\nThe question before us is, whether the unconscious can be other\nthan a purely negative concept. In daily speech (and more than\nis proper even in the scientific use of the language) we use such\nexpressions as unconscious sensations, unconscious ideas, unconscious\nfeeling. As, however, sensations, ideas and feelings are elements,\nthe expression is in reality absurd. If by an unconscious idea is\nmeant the idea which I have, then the predicate \"unconscious\"\nsignifies only that I do not think of or pay heed to the fact that I\nhave it. This use of the word unconsciousness is connected with\na twofold use of the word consciousness. It is used to denote not\nonly the inner presentation of our sensations, ideas and feelings,\nbut also self-consciousness, the attention especially directed to our\nsensations, ideas and feelings. We have, of course, many sensations\nand ideas without being conscious that we have them, that is,\nwithout self-consciousness : many feelings and impulses stir within\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 339\nus, without our clearly apprehending their nature and direction.\nIn this sense we speak, for example, of unconscious love. A man\nwho has this feeling does not know what is astir in him ;\nperhaps\nothers see it, or he himself gradually discovers it ; but he has the\nfeeling his conscious life is determined in a particular way.\nIn other words, what Hoffding practically claims here is that\nthere is no such mental state, no idea that is \" unconscious,\"\nbut that there are mental states, ideas, feelings, which, though\nconscious, do not reach self-consciousness. In other words,\nthere are in us mental processes which have consciousness, but no\nself-consciousness. This is precisely what I mean by the sub-\nconscious,\u2014mental states which have consciousness, but do not\nreach the personal consciousness. In short, the only possible\npsychological assumption is a subconscious consciousness.\nCHAPTER V.\nTHE SUBCONSCIOUS, CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS.\nThose who accept the division of the subconscious into co-existing\nconsciousness or the co-conscious and the unconscious really\nassume the doctrine of the subconscious. They claim that\nit would be better and more precise to indicate whenever\npossible the conscious or unconscious, that is, the strictly\nphysiological character of the observed manifestations. This,\nhowever, is more easily said than done. We know next to\nnothing of the physiological brain processes, which are mainly\nhypothetical, and we do not know the limits of the subconscious\nconsciousness. In many cases it is not easy to determine\nwhat the exact character of the subconscious manifestation is,\nhow far it is conscious, dimly conscious, how far it has gone\ntoward the development of an independent personality, and\nhow far it shades in the direction of the purely physiological.\nIn the absence of any exact determination, the term subconscious\nindicates the character of the mental state without any definite\ncommittal to any of the possible hypotheses.\nThe term \" unconscious \" is all the more objectionable, as\nHoffding has already pointed out, as it is essentially an\n\f340 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nambiguous, negative concept. The \" unconscious \" may mean\nabsence of self-consciousness, or lack of consciousness, that is,\npurely physiological processes with no conscious concomitant.\nHe who uses the term \" unconscious \" must in each case indicate\nin what sense he uses the term. Is the manifestation entirely\nphysiological, or is it conscious in the sense of consciousness\nwith no self-consciousness ? The two meanings are diametrically\nopposed to each other. The unconscious in the sense of the\npurely physiological assumes the theory of unconscious cere-\nbration ; the other use of the unconscious in the sense of mere\nconsciousness with no self-consciousness recognizes the view\nof the subconsciousness as advanced in my works.\nIt is claimed again that in many cases of psychopathic\nmaladies there is no need to have recourse to subconscious\nsystems. It is quite probable that the association between\nthe stimulus and the emotion called forth is a direct one.\nThe patient who is afraid of dogs has the fear called forth by\nthe sight of a dog. There is no need to assume that there\nare here any intermediate links in the chain of association.\nEven physiological links may be totally absent here. It may\nbe that by investigation it can be shown that this associa-\ntion has a history based on some former experience. There\nis no reason to assume that the experience is functioning\nsubconsciously, whether consciously or \" unconsciously,\" that is,\nphysiologically. The dog and the fear have formed an indis-\nsoluble association, so that, as soon as the dog is perceived\nthe fear is awakened.\nThis, however, is rather a debatable subject, since it is\nimpossible to tell in the case of purely physiological links,\nwhether such are present or not. Thus, Hoffding says,\n\" Not only may conscious results come from unconscious\n(subconscious) working up, but there may also be uncon-\nscious intermediate links in the midst of conscious work.\nSupposing the idea a to be linked with the idea b, and b\nagain with c, then a will finally produce c directly without\nthe intervention of b. The intermediate links are often so\nnumerous that they cannot be recovered at all or with great\ndifficulty. Many psychological paradoxes and sudden sugges-\ntions have their explanation in this unconscious determining\nof conscious ideas.\"\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 341\nWundt seems to maintain the same view :\n\" The memory-\nprocess is especially predominant in those cases where the\nelement of the new impression that gave rise to the\nassimilation is entirely suppressed by the other components\nof the image, so that the associative relation between the\nmemory-idea and the impression may remain completely\nunnoticed. Such cases have been spoken of as '\nmediate\nmemories ' or '\nmediate associations.' Still, just as with\n'\nmediate recognitions,' we are here, too, dealing with processes\nthat are fundamentally the same as ordinary associations.\nTake, for example, the case of a person who, sitting in his\nroom at evening, suddenly remembers, without any apparent\nreason, a landscape that he passed through many years before ;\nexamination shows that there happened to be in the room a\nfragrant flower which he saw for the first time in the land-\nscape. The difference between this and an ordinary\nmemory-process in which the connection of the new im-\npression with an earlier experience is clearly recognized,\nobviously consisted in the fact that here the elements which recall\nthe idea are pushed into the obscure background of conscious-\nness. The not infrequent experience, commonly known as the\n'\nspontaneous rise ' of ideas, in which a memory-image suddenly\nappears in our mind without any assignable cause, is in all\nprobability reducible in every case to such latent association.\"\nIt appears, then, that both Hoffding and Wundt acknowledge\nthe presence of intermediate links in what appears to be a\ncase of purely \" mediate \" or direct association.\nIn cases where the intermediate links are \" unconscious,\" in\nthe sense of a purely physiological process, there is no criterion\nto prove the presence of such intermediate physiological links,\nand one may as well, from a purely psychological introspective\nstandpoint, deny their very existence. On the other hand,\nif with Wundt, Hoffding and others we assume the presence of\nintermediate psychic links, there is no way of disproving them.\nIt is quite probable that such intermediate links are present in\nevery single case. The very fact that \" unconscious \" systems\ncan be revived as memories or hallucinatory hypnoidic states\nwould indicate their functioning when one of their components\nbecomes awakened to activity.\nAs an objection to the presence of intermediate psychic links,\n\f342 Boris Sidis, M.D. [part\nPavlow's experiments are brought forward to show that\nassociations can be formed between remote stimuli and\nglandular secretions, for instance. Thus, a dog with a fistula\nin the parotid gland can be made to react with secretions to\nlight or sound stimuli.\nThis objection may be easily obviated by the considera-\ntion that we do not know whether there are or are\nnot intermediate mental links between the artificial stimuli\nand the discharge of the glandular secretion. This considera-\ntion is all the more cogent as the remote stimuli can only\ngive results, if persistently associated with food stimuli. If\nsuch association with food stimuli is absent, and new stimuli\nare associated with remote stimuli which give reactions through\ntheir associations with food stimuli, the result is inhibition of\nsecretion. In other words, each new stimulus must be\ndirectly associated with the original food stimulus.\nTo quote from Savadsky's work carried out in Pavlow's labora-\ntory: \"Wasiliev and Mishtovt were the first to investigate condi-\ntions of inhibitions. At first the authors had in mind to develop\nconditional reflexes, not on the basis of the unconditional reflex\n(i.e. food) but on the basis of another conditional reflex (such\nas a sound or light stimulus giving secretion). Their experi-\nments were as follows : from time to time they associated\nwith the usual conditional stimulus another stimulus which\nhad no relation whatever to salivary secretion, and this\ncombination was not accompanied by the presence of the\nunconditional stimulus (food). By means of a great number\nof repetitions of such a combination, it was supposed to\nassociate with the quality of the extraneous stimulus the\nquality of bringing about salivary secretion. It turned out,\nhowever, that such an arrangement of experimentation could\nby no means transform the extraneous agent into a con-\nditional stimulus. In that way it became clear that the\nconditional stimulus, contrary to the unconditional, is not\ncapable of communicating its property of bringing about\nsalivary secretion. The fact is that the associative external\nstimulus, when accompanied by the unconditional stimulus\nalone, becomes after a few repetitions a powerful inhibiting\nagent.\"\nThis clearly shows that the conditional reflex in the\n\fLXVI.] The Theory of the Subconscious. 343\ndog can bring about salivary secretions only when associated\nwith the unconditional reflex. What it means is, that the\ndog on seeing a light or hearing the sound expects food, and\nhence the psychic stimulation of his salivary glands resulting\nin secretion. Pavlow's experiments and also the experiments\ncarried out under his directions by his pupils clearly prove\nthat there is no direct association between secretion and an\nexternal stimulus, such as light or sound, but that the secretion\nis brought about by an intermediate psychic link, namely the\nexpectation of food. Thus we find that the work of Pavlow\nand his pupils, far from showing the possibility of formation\nof direct associations, really goes to substantiate the view of\nthe presence of intermediate mental links in cases of mediate\nassociations.\nAs a matter of fact there is no need for us to establish\nhypothetical, intermediate, unconscious or physiological links.\nThe \" unconscious \" brain-processes are problematic entities and\nthere is no way of getting at them. What we need to discover\nin cases of mediate association, and especially in cases of\npsychopathic diseases, is whether the intermediate links, or the\noriginal experience that brought about the trauma, or the state\nof dissociation is present, consciously or subconsciously or co-\nconsciously. This is possible to test by hypnosis or by means\nof the hypnoidal state. In many such cases we actually find\nthat the patient lives through the original experience either\nconsciously in a hypnoidal state, or in a hypnoidic state, thus\nundergoing a mental experience which is immediately forgotten or\ndissociated ; or what is more commonly the case, the patient lives\nthrough the original experience subconsciously. But, whether\nconscious or subconscious, the mental state is not \" unconscious,\"\nbut is essentially of a conscious character. In short, we deal here\neither with the personal consciousness or with the subconscious\nconsciousness. Thus, all the facts of mental life, normal or\nabnormal, substantiate the presence of a subconscious consciotisness.\n\f344 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEWS.\nBody and Mind: a History and a Defence of Animism. By William\nM'Dougall, M.B. (Methuen & Co., Ltd. London, 1911. 384\npp. Price 10s. 6d. net.)\nThe scope and purpose of this important contribution to modern\nPsychology are concisely described in its second title \u2014a history and\na defence of Animism.\nThe term \" Animism \" as defined by Mr. M'Dougall covers a very\nwide range of meaning. \"The essential notion,\" he says, \"which\nforms the common foundation of all varieties of Animism, is that all,\nor some, of those manifestations of life and mind which distinguish\nthe living man from the corpse, and from inorganic bodies, are due to\nthe operation within him of something which is of a nature different\nfrom that of the body, an animating principle generally, but not\nnecessarily or always, conceived as an immaterial and individual being\nor soul.\" 1\nIn order to make this definition still clearer, Mr. M'Dougall examines\na variety of other terms which might have seemed to serve his purpose\nequally well or better, and gives his reasons for rejecting them either\nas being too narrow or as otherwise open to objection. \" No other\nterm,\" he considers, \"indicates precisely all those theories of human\npersonality which have in common the notion which, as I believe,\nprovides the only alternative to Materialism. The word 'Spiritualism'\nas used in philosophy is ambiguous, and it has been spoilt for scientific\npurposes by its current usage to denote that popular belief which is\nmore properly called Spiritism. Nor is all Animism spiritualistic\nduring long ages the dominant form of it was a materialistic Dualism.\nThe term '\npsycho-physical dualism ' accurately expresses the essential\nanimistic notion ; but it is cumbrous, and the word dualism is apt\n1\nTrefiice, p. viii.\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 345\nto be taken to imply metaphysical Dualism, an implication I am\nanxious to avoid; for Animism does not necessarily imply metaphysical\nDualism, or indeed any metaphysical or ontological doctrine, Solipsism\nalone excepted. The expression '\npsycho-physical interactionism '\nwill\nnot serve my purpose, because (as we see in the philosophy of\nLeibnitz, and in that modification of the Cartesian system known as\nOccasionalism), Animism may be combined with the denial of psycho-\nphysical interaction. Again, the term '\nsoul-theory ' does not cover\nall varieties of Animism, in illustration of which statement I may\nremind the reader that the late Prof. James advocated a distinctly\nanimistic view of human personality, which he called the '\ntrans-\nmission theory,' but explicitly rejected the conception of the soul as\na unitary and individual being.\"\nThe very wide extension thus given to the term Animism, and\nparticularly the inclusion in it of what Mr. M'Dougall calls \"material-\nistic dualism,\" make it difficult to say definitely concerning some of\nthe earlier phases of philosophic thought whether they should be\nclassed as animistic or non-animistic. The difficulty is no doubt largely\ndue to the vagueness of the doctrines themselves. As Mr. M'Dougall\npoints out, \"The doctrine of the Ionian philosopher was not properly\nMaterialism, for the distinction between matter and spirit had not\nyet been clearly drawn. It is impossible to say that their universal\nprinciples (e.g. the air of Diogenes or the fire of Heraclitus) were more\nnearly allied to the spiritual or to the physical, as conceived by later\nthought. Nor did the conception of the soul entertained by animistic\nphilosophers imply any clear distinction between the material or\nphysical and the spiritual or mental, such as has commonly been\nmaintained in later ages.\" Mr. M'Dougall, however, treats the Hylo-\nzoism of the Ionians as non-animistic, and no doubt rightly, if regard\nis had to the general tendency of their speculations. Yet it must\nbe remembered that their fundamental Monism did not prevent the\nIonian philosophers from regarding soul as a special kind or mode\nof matter, and in this sense distinguishing it from the body ; and\nthat even Democritus, whose system Mr. M'Dougall describes as a\nthorough-going Materialism, held that the soul-atoms were distinct\nin kind from the atoms constituting the body, and were that which\ngave the body life and consciousness. To that extent Democritus\nmight be counted as a \"materialistic dualist,\" and come within Mr.\nM'DougaH's definition of Animism. The difficulty is well illustrated\nin the case of the Stoic philosophy. The Stoics held that whatever\nis real is material, and that the soul is the warm breath within the\n\f346 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nbod}'. But this did not prevent some of them at least from also\nholding that the soul outlives the body.\nOf Aristotle Mr. M'Dougall says that his doctrine of the soul has\nmore affinity with the Hylozoism of the Ionian philosophers and\nthe Materialism of Democritus than with the materialistic Animism\nof popular thought or the spiritualistic Animism of Plato. Apparently\nlie classes him among the non-Animistic thinkers. No doubt there\nis much ambiguity in Aristotle's teaching concerning the soul, but\neven if we interpret his doctrine of the I'oCs 7toi>7tikos in the sense\nmost unfavourable to the survival of the individual, a definition of\nAnimism which includes the \"transmission theory\" of William James\ncan hardly exclude the Aristotelian conception of the psycho-physical\nrelation.\nIn reality it is of comparatively small importance how we classify\nparticular thinkers of early and medieval times in relation to terms\nwhich are more applicable to modern than to ancient thought. The\nchief legacy bequeathed by Greek philosophy and by Scholasticism\nwas a clearly drawn distinction between matter and spirit ; and when\nto this distinction was added the conception of the entire material\nuniverse as subject to laws capable of definite mathematical expression,\nmodern philosophy may be said to have begun.\nChapters IV. and V. of Mr. M'Dougall's book, which gives an\naccount of the progress of psycho-physical speculation during the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, are a good example of skilful\ncondensation. The essential points are sufficiently brought out, while\nat the same time the danger of \" losing sight of the wood for the\ntrees \" is successfully avoided.\nAs a specimen of terse and striking historical characterisation we\nmay quote the following passage from the end of the chapter on\n\"Animism in the Seventeenth Century\"\n\" Descartes had taught that man is composed of soul and body\nacting and reacting upon one another; Leibnitz that, though he is\ncompounded of soul and body, these do not influence one another\nSpinoza that mind and body are equally real or unreal, because but\ntwo aspects of one reality ; Hobbes that man consists of body alone,\nthe soul being a mere figment of his imagination.\n\"Two possibilities only remained, namely, first that the soul alone\nis real, the body being fictitious or appearance only ;\nsecondly that\nboth body and soul are fictitious. And the ingenuity of the eighteenth\ncentury proved equal to the task of propounding and maintaining\nthese doctrines also ; before the century passed away these two were\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 347\nadded to the list of rival doctrines by philosophers, namely Bishop\nBerkeley and David Hume, whose penetration and high reputation\nsecured for their views a respectful hearing and a career whose end\nno man can yet foresee.\"\nThe immediate developments of the Cartesian philosophy turned\non the definition of substance. Although Descartes held that in man\nthe spiritual substance, or soul, and the material substance, or body,\nmutually interacted, his definition of substance made interaction\nimpossible. The doctrines of the Occasionalists, of Leibnitz, and\nof Spinoza, were so many attempts to overcome the logical difficulty\nwithout surrendering the conception of substance. It was the con-\nception itself which was made the subject of enquiry and question,\nfirst by Locke, who held that spiritual and material substances were\nalike only useful hypotheses inferred from the facts of immediate\nexperience ; next by Berkeley, for whom spiritual substances alone\nwere real, and material substance a fiction ; and finally by Hume,\nwho attacked the whole idea of substance, whether spiritual or\nmaterial, and declared it to be a figment of the imagination\nwithout any counterpart in real experience.\nBoth these lines of speculation were in some sort united, although\nwith much inconsistency alike of statement and of thought, in the\nphilosophy of Kant ; and it has been in the main through the\nmedium of that philosophy that they have affected later psycho-\nphysical theories. It is interesting, however, to note that the\nleading ideas which distinguish the two parallelistic doctrines most\nin vogue to-day are to be found, in the one case, in the doctrine\nof Leibnitz that material extension is only the appearance to us of\nan aggregation of psychical existents, and, in the other case, in the\n\"double aspect\" theory of Spinoza. Both the modern forms of\nparallelism, moreover, accept the notion of \"psychology without a\nsoul,\" of which Hume must be regarded as the originator.\nIn the nineteenth century, and especially in the last half of the\ncentury, Animism suffered a rapid decline. It can hardly be doubted\nthat Mr. M'Dougall is right in assigning as the chief cause of this\ndecline \" the astonishing and splendid development of the natural\nsciences, based in the main upon the strictly mechanistic view of\nnature.\" As contributing causes, but of less importance, he mentions\nKant's destructive attack on the dogmatic Metaphysic of his prede-\ncessor, and the reaction produced by the attempt of his immediate\nsuccessors to convert the Kantian epistemology without more ado\ninto an Absolute Idealism.\n\f84S The Rigid Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nThat the whole material universe constituted a system mechani-\ncally ordered was already common ground with Descartes and his\nsuccessors. Descartes, indeed, taught that in the case of man the\nsoul or spiritual substance interacted with the body : but this he\nheld to be the solitary exception to the universal sway of mechanism\nin the material sphere ; all other animals were automatons. Even\nthis exception was swept away by Spinoza. But, as Mr. M'Dougall\nobserves, the conclusion that the actions of men are capable of being\nfully explained in terms of mechanism was rather a corollary from\nhis philosophical system than a doctrine based on empirical observa-\ntion. \" Spinoza . . . could appeal only to men's profound ignorance\nof the body and its processes ; whereas those who make the same\nassumption in the present age appeal with confidence and good show\nof reason to our knowledge of the body and its processes, claiming\nthat the knowledge which we now have amply justifies the assump-\ntion, and allows us to understand in a general way the mechanics\nof human conduct.\"\nIn three interesting chapters Mr M'Dougall traces the special\nmodern developments of physical science, of physiology, and of\nbiology, to which he considers the anti-animistic tendency of recent\nspeculation is due. Chief among them are, in physics, the trium-\nphant establishment of the law of conservation of energy ; in\nphysiology and biology the discovery of the localisation of cerebral\nfunctions ; the development of the doctrine of reflex action, and\nthe apparent continuity of chains of physical causation even in the\nbrain ; the seemingly unconscious performance (e.g. in trance) of\nactions which are ordinarily taken to imply perception, feeling,\nreasoning and volition ; the explanation of the association of ideas\nby the analogy of habitual actions mechanically performed ; and the\nexperience, generally, of a parallelism of mental and cerebral develop-\nment, decay, affection by injuries, drugs, etc.\nThe influence of the Darwinian theory must also be counted\namong the causes which have contributed to the decline of Animism,\nby removing (in the opinion of many) any necessity for the recogni-\ntion of a teleological element in the organic world. The conception\nof a continuity in evolution likewise raises difficulties, whether it\nbe of man from animals, or of organic from inorganic nature.\nThis formidable array of anti-animistic considerations drawn from\nempirical science is set forth by Mr. M'Dougall with commendable\nfrankness and candour. Nor does he shrink from stating in the\nmost emphatic terms the effect they have produced in the minds\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 349\nof the majority of thinkers during the last sixty years who have\nconcerned themselves with the psycho-physical problem. \" Modern\nscience and philosophy,\" he tells us, \"have turned their backs on\nAnimism of every kind with constantly increasing decision.\" \" Its\nfew exponents,\" he says in another place, have been \"generally\nregarded as survivors from an earlier age, actuated by some theo-\nlogical bias to offer a futile opposition to the conquering march of\nscience.\"\nThese are strong expressions, but probably they are no inaccurate\nrepresentation of the mental attitude of most of those who approach\nthe subject primarily from the study of physiology. The very\nrespectable list of names which Mr. M'Dougall gives on p. 204 of\nwriters whom he reckons on the side of Animism shows that there\nis by no means the same degree of unanimity among philosophers.\nHis own book may be counted as one among several indications\nthat the tide of opinion is perhaps once more beginning to turn.\nHaving stated the principal scientific objections to Animism, and\nadded a brief account of current philosophical arguments against it,\nMr. M'Dougall does not proceed at once to answer them, but\ninterposes instead a survey and general examination of the modern\npsycho-physical doctrines proposed as substitutes for Animism. Such\nan arrangement of topics seems at first sight to interrupt and\nconfuse the argument ; and it might perhaps have been better to\nhave included his statement of these doctrines in the historical\nsketch which occupies the earlier chapters of the book. This the\nauthor might have done without serious inconsistency ; for though\nhe describes the historical part of his work as a \" history of\nAnimism,\" it is in reality, down to the end of the eighteenth\ncentury, a history of anti-animistic theories as well, and only ceases\nto be so when the nineteenth century is reached.\nOn the other hand, when we come down to our own times, there\nare undoubted advantages in a systematic rather than a historical\nexposition ; and the statement of the chief objections to Animism\nleads up naturally to an account of the systems which claim to\navoid those objections.\nThere may be also another reason for the procedure which Mr.\nM'Dougall has adopted. It enables him, almost at the outset of the\ndiscussion, to carry the war into the enemy's country ; and so diffi-\ncult is the psycho-physical problem that the advantage is in general\napt to be, or to appear to be, with the assailants rather than with\nthe defenders of any particular doctrine. Moreover, Mr. M'Dougall\n\f350 The Rigid Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nbelieves that the overthrow of Parallelism is equivalent to the estab-\nlishment of Animism. \"The main body of this volume,\" he tells us\nin the preface, \"is occupied with the presentation and examination\nof the reasonings which have led the great majority of philosophers\nand men of science to reject Animism, and of the modern attempts\nto render an intelligible account of the nature of man which, in\nspite of the rejection of Animism, shall escape Materialism. This\nsurvey leads to the conclusion that these reasonings are inconclusive\nand these attempts unsuccessful, and that we are therefore compelled\nto choose between Animism and Materialism ; and since the logical\nnecessity of preferring the animistic horn of this dilemma cannot\nbe in doubt, my survey constitutes a defence and justification of\nAnimism.\"\nIn the body of the work the argument is presented somewhat\ndifferently, though the difference is unimportant. Materialism is\ncurtly dismissed as obviously untenable ; its modern representative,\nEpiphenomenalism, is demolished in the course of a few pages ; and\nthe final dilemma presented to us is that of Animism or Parallelism.\nFrom this dilemma Mr. M'Dougall holds that no escape is possible:\n\"We must accept Animism if we find the difficulties involved in\nParallelism to be fatal to it.\"\nIn developing his argument, Mr. M'Dougall enumerates four principal\ntype-formulations of the modern psycho-physical doctrines that reject\nAnimism :\n(1) Epiphenomenalism, which confines causality to the physical series,\nand regards consciousness as the incidental accompaniment of the brain\nprocess, produced by that process, but itself empty of all causal efficacy\nwhatsoever.\n(2) Psycho-physical Parallelism (or, as I should prefer to call it, Dua-\nlistic Parallelism 1\n), which holds the physical and the mental series\n1\nIt is only as implying an ultimate metaphysical dualism that \" Psycho-\nphysical Parallelism'' in M'Dougall's sense can be properly ranked as co-ordinate\nwith the doctrines which he calls \" Phenomenalistic Parallelism\" and \"Psychical\nMonism.\" In this form (which seems further to imply a \"pre-established har-\nmony\" between the two series) I should doubt whether it is dogmatically\nmaintained by any one whose opinion is worth counting. Mr. M'Dougall\nobserves that it is generally held merely as a working hypothesis; but as\nsuch it can hardly be said to carry with it any ontological implication con-\ncerning the ultimate nature of reality ; and it would seem better to apply\nthe term Psycho-physical Parallelism not to one among a number of co-ordinate\nvarieties of Parallelism, but rather to the undifferentiated generic form of which\nthese varieties are specific developments.\n\fLXVI.] Revieivs. 351\nto be equally real, but the relation between them to be one of simple\nconcomitance without interaction. The law of Causation holds good\nonly within each series.\n(3) Phenomenalistic Parallelism, which holds that mind and body\nare but two aspects of one reality, whose true nature is hidden\nfrom us. The physical and the psychical series are alike appearances :\nthere is no causal action between them. There is an appearance\nof causal connection within each series ; but this too is, strictly\nspeaking, only the phenomenal manifestation of one underlying\nreality.\n(4) Psychical Monism. The physical series is the appearance of\nthe psychical series to another consciousness. Consciousness is the\nonly reality, and true causal efficiency is confined to the psychical\nseries : within the physical series the chain of causation is appear-\nance only.\nIf to these four formulations of anti-animistic views we add Crude\nMaterialism, \"which asserts that consciousness is matter or the move-\nment of matter,\" and Solipsism, which \"denies the existence of the\nphysical world and of other minds than my own (except as ideas of\nmy own),\" Mr. M'Dougall holds, if I understand him rightly, that\nwe have a complete classification of all anti-animistic doctrines : and\nas all of these save the varieties of parallelism may be more or less\nsummarily rejected, we are left with the alternative already indicated\nof Parallelism or Animism.\nSome objection may perhaps be taken to this general line of argu-\nment. To overthrow a rival doctrine does of course go some way\nto establish one's own ; but such reasoning must remain inconclu-\nsive unless it can be shown that the classification of the various\ndoctrines concerned is sound, and that it covers the entire field not\nonly of actual but of possible speculation on the subject. Now fhis\nis a very difficult thing to prove ; and though Mr. M'Dougall devotes\na whole chapter to the defence of his \"dilemma,\" his admission that\nBerkeley's subjective Idealism, and Professor Ward's \"Trans-subjec-\ntivism \" do in a sense \" transcend \" the psycho-physical problem, and\nhis practically complete ignoring of the Post-Kantian Idealism, can-\nnot fail to suggest doubts even to those who are far from accepting\nthese theories.\nIt must be remembered, too, that even if Mr. M'Dougall's reasoning-\nis sound, the value of the conclusion to be drawn from it must be\nmeasured with due regard to the very wide extension which it\nnecessarily leaves to the term Animism. The essential features\n\f352 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nwhich all modern anti-animistic solutions of the psycho-physical pro-\nblem exhibit, are, according to him, the following :\n(1) Denial of all psycho-physical interaction.\n(2) Insistence that all the processes of the organic world (includ-\ning all the behaviour of men and animals) are capable in\nprinciple of being fully explained in mechanical terms.\nSo far as Animism is established by the rejection of anti-animistic\ndoctrines, Animism must be held to include any view of the psycho-\nphysical relation from which these features, or either of them, are\nexcluded. Incidentally, it may be noted, we are thus provided with\na negative definition of Animism that may profitably be compared\nwith the positive definition already quoted at the beginning of this\nreview.\nArguments for or against any solution of the psycho-physical\nproblem fall broadly into two classes, the first consisting of argu-\nments drawn from empirical science, the second of arguments of a\nmetaphysical or epistemological character.\nMr. M'Dougall is very anxious to impress upon his readers that\nAnimism does not involve any metaphysical doctrine save the rejection\nof Solipsism, and that in this respect it has a great advantage over\nParallelism. At the end of the Preface he writes\n\" I wish to state emphatically that my enquiry is not conceived\nas a search for metaphysical truth, but that it is rather conducted\nby the methods and with the aims of all empirical science ; that is\nto say, it aims at discovering the hypotheses which will enable us\nbest to co-ordinate the chaotic data of immediate experience by means\nof a conceptual system as consistent as may be, while recognising\nthat such conceptions must always be subject to revision with the\nprogress of science. Of course if the term metaphysic be taken in\nthe older sense as implying an enquiry into that which is not physical,\nthe theme of this work is metaphysical ; but that is a usage which\nis no longer accepted ;\nmetaphysic is now distinguished from empirical\nscience by its aims and methods rather than by its subject matter.\nI claim, then, for the conception of soul, advocated in the last chapter\nof this book, no more than that it is a hypothesis which is indis-\npensable to science at the present time.\"\nAgain, on page 192, he says:\n\" It is, in fact, one of the great advantages of psycho-physical\nDualism that, whereas each of the rival monistic doctrines necessarily\ncommits those who accept it to some particular ontological doctrine\n(Materialism, Spinozistic Agnostic Monism, or Psychical Monism),\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 353\nwe are committed by Animism to no metaphysical doctrine. We\nmay accept it while remaining wholly on the plane of empirical\nscience ; and in view of the strong dislike of metaphysic expressed\nby so many workers in the natural sciences, this fact should be for\nthem a strong recommendation of Animism. It is true that Des-\ncartes' psycho-physical Dualism was made by him a metaphysical\nDualism; for he taught that matter and soul are two ultimately\ndifferent kinds of reality. But scientific Animism is under no obliga-\ntion to accept Descartes' ontological dogma ; it leaves open the ulti-\nmate questions, about which it is a mere piece of presumption for\nany man to express a decided opinion in the present state of human\nknowledge. For the real natures both of body and soul remain open\nquestions, the answers to which, we may hope, will be gradually\nbrought nearer to the truth by the labours of after-coming genera-\ntions. For the present the Animist may, if he likes, suppose body\nto consist of matter such as is described by physical science, or,\nwith Kant, he may regard it as the phenomenon of an unknowable\nthing-for-itself ;\nor, with Leibnitz and Lotze, as a system of real\nbeing of like nature with the Soul ;\nor, with Berkeley, as nothing\nbut the perpetually renewed acts of God upon our souls. In any\ncase his ontological view, whatever it may be, so long as it is not\nsolipsistic, need not affect, and is perfectly compatible with, his belief\nin psycho-physical interaction.\"\nOnce more, on p. 356\n\" Though the acceptance of either horn of the dilemma [Parallelism\nor Animism] involves the acceptance of a number of strange conse-\nquences and leaves on our hands a number of questions to which we\ncan return no answer, Animism has this great advantage over its\nrival, namely, that it remains on the plane of empirical science, and,\nwhile leaving the metaphysical question open for independent treat-\nment, can look forward to obtaining further light on its problems\nthrough further scientific research. It is thus a doctrine that stimu-\nlates our curiosity and stirs us to further efforts, whereas Parallelism\nnecessarily involves the acceptance of metaphysical doctrines which\nclaim to embody ultimate truth, and which set rigid limits to the\npossibilities of further insight into the nature of the world, and it\nfinds itself forced to regard certain of its problems as ultimately\ninexplicable.\"\nThese are interesting passages ; and the stress laid upon the pro-\nfoundly metaphysical character which the Parallelistic doctrines have\nassumed in the hands of those who have most carefully worked out\nz\n\f354 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\ntheir implications, is certainly in a measure justified. At the same\ntime, although my own sympathies are entirely on Mr. M'Dougall's\nside in the controversy hetween Animism and Parallelism, I cannot\nbut think that he has somewhat exaggerated the advantage which\nin this matter he represents Animism as possessing in comparison\nwith its rival.\nThe term \"metaphysical\" is not very easy to define; but surely\nevery hypothesis which deals with fundamental concepts like Body\nand Mind must ultimately be prepared to submit its claim to philo-\nsophical and even metaphysical examination : and this is as true of\nAnimism as of Parallelism. Mr. M'Dougall himself practically admits\nthat Animism cannot be held in complete independence of meta-\nphysical considerations. He tells us in one place that, while (p. 355)\n\" the belief in the adequacy and the exclusive sway of mechanical\nprinciples in both the inorganic and organic realms has been and\nremains the principal ground of the rejection of Animism by the\nmodern world,\" yet, on the other hand, \"the more enlightened of the\nopponents of Animism, recognising the uncertain nature of this\nground, have rested their case mainly upon certain metaphysical\narguments that make against the acceptance of the notion of psycho-\nphysical interaction.\" A whole chapter, though a short one, of his\nbook is devoted mainly to a statement of these and other meta-\nphysical objections to Animism, and another and much longer\nchapter to a refutation of them. It may be urged that in these\nchapters the author is only engaged in securing a standing-ground\nfor a defence of Animism on Empirical lines, and that it is possible\nto clear away the imaginary obstructions raised by an unsound\nmetaphysic without laying down any positive metaphysical doctrine.\nBut the negative here implies a positive. The metaphysical ques-\ntions involved are those which concern the nature of causality and\nsubstantiality, and the legitimacy of treating the soul as a sub-\nstance or even as a \" thins \" transcendinir in some sense the\nconsciousness in which its essence is manifested. Let the reader\nconsider for a moment the main propositions in which Mr.\nM'Dougall sums up the conception of soul which he would himself\ncommend to our acceptance. The soul, according to this view, 1\nis\n(1) immaterial; (2) a thing or being \"that possesses, or is, the sum\nof definite capacities for psychical activity and psycho-physical inter-\naction ; \" (3) \"a unitary being or entity distinct from all others.\"\nThe metaphysical implications in these propositions and the meta-\n^p. 364-366.\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 355\nphysical questions suggested by them lie on the surface ; and the\nmore strenuous the attempt to give precision to the Animistic theory,\nthe more loudly do such implications and questions clamour for\nexamination. There could hardly be a more striking illustration of\nthis than the divergence of view between Professor James and Mr.\nM'Dougall (both of them Animists in Mr. M'Dougall's sense) respect-\ning the existence of the Soul. \"Souls have outworn both themselves\nand their welcome, that is the plain truth,\" says Professor James.\nTo which Mr. M'Dougall replies (and I think he has the best of the\nargument) that, according to James's own admission, \" the only alter-\nnatives to the acceptance of the soul-theory are either to give up\nour belief in logic or to declare that life is logically irrational \"\nand in this dilemma or trilemma he holds it best to \" retain a\nmodest confidence in human reason, and accept the hypothesis of the\nsoul\n!\nThe claim which Mr. M'Dougall sets up on behalf of Animism,\nthat it can be held without metaphysical implications, seems to me\nto depend very largely upon the extremely wide limits which he\ngives to the definition of Animism. Animism, according to him,\nincludes any psycho-physical theory which is not Epiphenomenalism\nor Parallelism. But it is impossible to rest in this vague and quasi-\nnegative view of Animism. As we proceed, the need for greater\nparticularity becomes apparent, though not until the last chapter do\nthe wide distinctions which separate the various formulations of\nmodern Animism stand fairly revealed. In his final chapter Mr.\nM'Dougall enumerates four principal varieties of Animism : the\n\" animistic Actuelle-Seele \" ; the \" transmission-theory \" of James and\nBergson : the \" contentless \" soul ; and the soul conceived as \" a\ndeveloping system of psychical dispositions.\" Mr. M'Dougall's own\nview is a sub-variety of the last of the four ; and in defending one\nview and rejecting others the metaphysical character of much of the\nreasoning is patent. The plain fact is that the moment any attempt\nis made to give precision to a psycho-physical theory, metaphysical\nconsiderations force themselves into prominence. The metaphysical\nconceptions involved have been lurking there all the time in the\nform of unquestioned presuppositions, and the further thinking out\nof the theory brings them inevitably to the surface.\nI suspect that a large number of scientific men who would describe\nthemselves as opponents of Animism, or even as Parallelists, feel\nquite as unencumbered by metaphysical difficulties, and quite as\ncompletely \" on the plane of empirical science \" as the Animist, in\n\f356 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nMr. M'Dougall's view, is entitled to do. No less a writer than\nWundt, for instance, treats Parallelism as \"a heuristic principle or\na necessary working hypothesis for psychology,\" and is attacked\nby Mr. M'Dougall for doing so. \"The culminating absurdity of\nWundt's position,\" he says, \"is that after arguing at great length to\nshow that psychology must accept psycho-physical Parallelism as a\n'\nheuristic principle ' empirically based, he turns round and tells us\nthat in considering voluntary movements of the body we must treat\nthem as being psychically originated, because we cannot ascertain\nthe nature of the physiological process which initiates them, and\nthat we must make use of the conception of psycho-physical inter-\naction, so long as we cannot complete our account of the brain\nprocesses.\" 1\nI am far from wishing to defend Wundt's consistency ;\nbut the position he takes up is at least evidence of his determina-\ntion to \" remain on the plane of empirical science \" in spite of his\nParallelism. And this attitude really is possible so long as Parallelism\nis genuinely treated as a merely heuristic principle. Of course,\neven as a heuristic principle it contains latent metaphysical implica-\ntions, just as Animism does. These implications may be more\napparent and more difficult to overlook in the case of Parallelism\nthan in that of Animism ; but if this be so, I think the reasons\nare, first, that more attempts have been made in recent years to work\nout the Parallelistic hypothesis into a philosophical system, and,\nsecondly, that the metaphysic of the ordinary forms of Animism is\nmore in accordance with the unconscious metaphysic of popular\nthought, and, therefore, challenges examination in a less degree.\nThere is, perhaps, a tendency among writers on this subject to\nuse metaphysical arguments much more freely in attacking an\nopponent's solution of the psycho-physical problem than in establish-\ning their own. Mr. M'Dougall's examination of the Anti-animistic\n(or Automaton) theories is an excellent specimen of vigorous and\nacute criticism. But of the four principal formulations of Anti-\nanimistic views, Epiphenomenalism, Dualistic Parallelism, the double\naspect theory, and Psychical Monism, the first three are demolished\nand eliminated by arguments which in the main must certainly be\nregarded as metaphysical, and we practically hear little more of\nthem throughout the book. It is in this way that Mr. M'Dougall\narrives at his final dilemma\u2014Psychical Monism or else Animism.\nBut in the end Psychical Monism itself fares no better. It has been\npreferred on metaphysical grounds to every other form of Anti-\n1\nP. 155.\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 357\nanimistic doctrine ; but no sooner have its rivals been driven from the\nfield than the metaphysical batter)' is directed in turn against it.\nThe fundamental propositions of Psychical Monism are formulated\nby Mr. M'Dougall as follows (p. 160):\u2014 \"(1) Consciousness or con-\nscious-process (or something of the same nature, but so very much\nsimpler as to require a different name, such as mind-stuff or infra-\nconsciousness) is the only reality, the only mode of existence or of\nreal being. (2) By each one of us only one tiny fragment of reality\nis directly known, namely, the stream of his own consciousness\nalthough all the rest of the universe consists of other conscious\nprocesses, it can be apprehended by him only under the form of\nmaterial or physical phenomena. (3) The appearances to us of\nother real or conscious processes under the forms of physical objects\nand processes bear some constant and orderly relation to those real\nprocesses, so that the descriptions and explanations of the universe\ngiven by physical science are valid, though they are symbolic only;\nthat is to say, all the processes which constitute the universe pro-\nceed according to, or can be fully explained in terms of, the laws of\nmechanical causation.\"\nThese propositions are all metaphysical, and they are met in the\nchapter we are now considering by counter-arguments which are\nthemselves either purely metaphysical, or partly metaphysical and\npartly drawn from that region of introspective psychology which is\noften hard to distinguish from metaphysic, and at least cannot be\ndescribed as belonging to empirical science. It is the first of them,\nhowever, which is specially characteristic of Psychical Monism. As\nagainst the rejection by Psychical Monism of the notion of sub-\nstance or thing and its replacement by that of activity or process,\nMr. M'Dougall insists that these notions are essential to our thought,\nthat they are necessary alike to physical science and to psychology,\nand that the denial of existence to the soul, and the assertion that\nthe self consists in the stream of consciousness alone, involve the\nconsistent psychical monist in the strange conclusion that my self is\nnot my own consciousness but \" the streams of consciousness of other\nselves\" (p. 167). The unity and individuality of consciousness as\nwe know it is, says Mr. M'Dougall, \" a fundamental fact which\nraises insuperable difficulties for Psychical Monism.\" The philoso-\nphical expounders of the doctrine either make no attempt to explain\nit, or else they fall back on a conception of a compounding, or flowing\ntogether into a unity, of consciousnesses each of which nevertheless\ncontinues to exist in and for itself\u2014a conception which, it is argued,\n\f358 The Rigid Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nnot only re-admits surreptitiously the rejected notion of substance,\nbut is in itself logically and metaphysically untenable.\n\" We find then,\" writes Mr. M'Dougall in conclusion, \" that the\nfundamental assumption of Psychical Monism, namely that conscious-\nness is the reality and the only reality, and its attempt to abolish\nas illegitimate the conception of any mode of being other than con-\nsciousness, involve it in very great difficulties, not to say absurdities.\"\nI agree : but holding, as he does, that each and every form of Anti-\nanimistic doctrine is open to \" insuperable \" objections from the\nphilosophical standpoint, and, further, that all forms of Parallelism\n(but particularly Psychical Monism) 1\ninvolve the self-contradictory\nidea of \"unconscious consciousness,\" and can only achieve the seem-\ningly impossible task of making mechanical determination the counter-\npart of teleological determination by lapsing into Solipsism\u2014holding\nthese views, as he does, we may be pardoned some mild surprise at\nfinding him affirming in a later chapter (p. 223) that \"the issue\nbetween Animism and Parallelism is one that must be settled by\nthe methods of empirical science, i.e. by an appeal to observation\nand experiment and the weighing of the claims of rival hypotheses.\"\nSurely in so difficult an enquiry as that into the relation of Mind\nwith Body there is not only room but a pressing necessity for both\nphilosophic and scientific methods. The two should be used to\nsupplement each other. And in spite of Mr. M'DougalPs anxiety to\nclaim for Animism the right to remain on the plane of empirical\nscience, this is, I venture to think, the procedure which he has\nhimself followed.\nThe author's defence of Animism on the Empirical side opens with\nChapter XVI.,2\nand occupies practically the whole of the remaining\nportion of the book.\nFirst comes a very interesting general reply to the objections drawn\nfrom Physiology and General Biology, and already set forth in\nJ\nI understand Mr. M'Dougall's argument to be that an unconscious soul is\na legitimate and (for Animism) even perhaps necessary conception, but that\nunconscious consciousness is a contradiction in terms. It is interesting to note\nthat Lotze, perhaps the greatest champion of Animism in recent times, leaned,\nin his latest work (Metaphync, p. 534 in the translation), to the view that in\nbecoming unconscious the soul ceased to exist\u2014an admission which William\nJames (wrongly, I think) treated as an abandonment of the \"Soul-Theory.\"\n2\nThe argument against Animism drawn from the so-called Law of the Conser-\nvation of Energy would seem to belong naturally to this section of the work,\nbut Mr. M'Dougall has preferred to deal with it in the previous chapter, in\nwhich the philosophical arguments against Animism are examined.\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 359\nChapters VIII. and IX. Mr. M'Dougall contends (successfully, I\nthink) that neither the localisation of cerebral functions, nor the\nabsence of any discoverable gap in the sequence of material causa-\ntion which connects sense-impression with muscular reaction upon\nit, nor the apparently automatic performance of highly complex\nactions of which no normal memory afterwards remains, nor the\ndependence of our mental life upon brain-conditions, nor the multi-\nplicity of conscious individualities within a single organism, nor the\nassumption of continuity of evolution from the inorganic to the\norganic, nor the acceptance of Darwinian views, justifies any final\nconclusion against the Animistic hypothesis. Even where the facts\nare admitted an explanation consistent with Animism is always\npossible.\nIn the succeeding chapters the argument passes from defence pure\nami simple to the \"defensive-offensive.\" Parallelism holds (1) that\nthe universe in all its features is susceptible of explanation in\nmechanical terms ; (2) that every psychical process has its exact\nphysical counterpart. Against the first of these dogmas Mr.\nM'Dougall argues that, on the contrary, mechanical conceptions are\ninadequate even in physiology and morphology, and that mechanism\nis wholly insufficient to explain either organic evolution or animal\nand human behaviour. Against the second he contends that the\nunity of consciousness has no physical unity corresponding to it,\nand that this can be shown to be true even if we confine our atten-\ntion to sensation. Still more demonstrable is it that consciousness\nof meaning, to which sensations are only the cues, as well as the\n\" feeling-tone \" of pleasure and displeasure which attend the whole\ncontent of consciousness, and the \" coiiative processes \" which are\nso intimately connected with pleasure and displeasure, are purely\npsychical and have no correlative analogue on the physical side.\n\" True \" memory, again (as opposed to habit), involves meaning as\nan essential element, and cannot be explained in terms of brain-\nstructure. Finally, an examination of the results of \"Psychical\nResearch \" leads to the conclusion that telepathy must be accepted\nas a fact empirically proved ; and telepathy is wholly inconsistent\nwith Parallelism.\nWithout detracting in any way from the merits of the earlier\nportion of the book, the chapters of which a brief summary has just\nbeen given may fairly be regarded as the most important and original\npart of Mr. M'Dougall's work. It is, however, impossible to do justice\n\f360 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nto them within the narrow compass of a review, and I must content\nmyself by calling attention to a few points of special interest.\nThe centre of the psycho-physical controversy is undoubtedly to\nbe found in the problem of the unity of consciousness. That con-\nsciousness, as we know it, is in some sense unitary, and runs in\npersonal streams, is admitted by both sides ; but the significance\nof the fact thus admitted is very diversely regarded. For the\nmajority of Animists it is the chief ground for conceiving the soul\nas an entity which, by whatever name it may be called, is at least\na real being, relatively independent, capable of acting and being\nacted on, and not to be identified with its fleeting states.\nThe soul-theory is generally sought to be established by reason-\ning of a metaphysical character, of which Lotze has been in modern\ntimes the principal exponent. Mr. M'Dougall does not disdain the\nmetaphysical argument. On the contrary, he quotes Lotze's presen-\ntation of it at considerable length, and declares that it cannot be\nrefuted. But it is by appealing to the facts of cerebral physiology,\nhe thinks, that the argument from the unity of consciousness to\nthe real being of the soul can be presented in the most cogent\nform. Do these facts justify us in treating either the brain as a\nwhole or any portion of it as the physical counterpart of that unity\nof consciousness which is admitted by Parallelists themselves 1 If\nnot, then Parallelism stands condemned by empirical science.\nThe question is one that cannot be avoided ; but only in the region\nof simple sensation have physiologists made any serious attempt to\nanswer it in the affirmative. And even in this region no affirmative\nanswer can be given which is compatible with observed facts. When\nthe effects of more than one sensory stimulus are combined in the\nunity of a single consciousness, the very least that can be demanded\nof Parallelism is to show reason for believing that there exists in\nthe brain a physical \" medium of composition \" in which the physical\neffects of the stimuli are combined in a physical unit}7\njust as the\npsychical effects are combined in the unity of consciousness. But\nthis cannot be done. The search for a sensorium commune has proved\nas futile as the search for a punctual seat of the soul. 1 \" The know-\nledge we now have of the nervous system and its functions,\" says\nMr. M'Dougall, \"enables us to assert confidently that there exists\n1\nAs Mr. M'Dougall points out, the physiological considerations so often relied\nupon for the rejection of Animism, such as the localisation of brain functions\nand the failure to find a punctual seat for the soul, tell in reality less against\nAnimism than against Parallelism.\n\fLXVI.] Revieivs. 361\nin the brain no such physical medium of composition, and that the\nprocesses of the several sensory nerves simultaneously excited do\nnot affect any common material medium to produce in it a complex\nphysical resultant.\" Nor is he content to rest this statement upon\nany general principles of cerebral physiology, however well estab-\nlished : on the contrary, he appeals in support of it to the very case\nin which the physical compounding of simultaneous sense-stimuli has\nbeen most confidently assumed, namely, the case of binocular vision.\nWhen we look at any object with both eyes, both retinae and both\noptic nerves are stimulated, but only one object is seen. Similarly,\nif we look at a spot of light with both eyes, interposing a red glass\nbefore one eye and a blue glass before the other, we experience a\ncolour-sensation neither of red nor of blue, but of purple. Where\nin either' case does the compounding take place ?\nMr. M'DougaU's answer to this question is clear: \"The fusion of\neffects of simultaneous sensory stimuli to a unitary resultant is not\na physiological or physical fusion or composition, but a purely psychical\nfusion ; the unitary resultant exists only in the psychical sphere.\" In\nother words, the fusion is a psychical process to which no physical\nprocess runs parallel. This conclusion he supports by a formidable\narray of arguments, which cannot be reproduced here, but which\nappear to constitute a strong prima facie case, and certainly deserve-\nthe careful attention of all students of the subject.\nThe difficulties created for Parallelism by the unity of conscious-\nness are of course far greater in the case of more complex sensations,\nand still more so when the higher mental functions are involved.\nThe whole position seems to be given away by Fechner when he\nwrites (in a sentence quoted by Mr. M'Dougall), \"The psychically\nunitary and simple are resultants of a physical manifold : the physical\nmultiplicity gives unity or simple resultauts.\" For this amounts to\nsaying (in Parallelistic language) that psychical unity has for its\ncounterpart physical multiplicity. Even if an attempt is made to\nrender this statement a little more plausible by representing the\ncounterpart of psychical unity to be physical multiplicity plus material\ncontinuity, and further to supplement this view, as Fechner does, by\nhis ingenious theory of the varying threshold of consciousness, we\nare still entitled to insist that multiplicity cannot in any true sense\nbe the counterpart of unity.\nMr. M'DougaU's chapters on \"Memory\" and on \"the Bearing of\nthe Results of Psychical Research on the Psycho-physical Problem,\"\n\f362 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nwill be read with special interest by the members of our Society\u2014\nthe latter for obvious reasons, the former because the author's\ntheory of memory has profoundly influenced his views on the nature\nof the soul and the question of its possible survival after the death\nof the body.\nI will conclude this review by briefly referring to each of these\ntopics.\nMr. M'Dougall is among the very few psychologists of high rank\nwho have had the courage to declare not onhy that telepathy has\nbeen established, but also that it cannot be explained on mechanistic\nprinciples. When we consider that it is only three or four years\nago since even William James, in his lectures on \"A Pluralistic\nUniverse,\" described the field of enquiry with which Psychical Research\nis occupied as \"perhaps too spook-haunted to interest an academic\naudience,\" this bold recognition comes as a very welcome sign of the\nincreasing value which is being attached to the Society's work.\nIn Mr. M'Dougall's opinion the evidence collected by the Society,\nwhile not sufficient to produce conviction of survival, is sufficient to\nforce upon us the alternative of accepting the fact of telepathic com-\nmunication of a kind and at a distance that puts the supposition\nof mechanical transmission entirely out of court. \"So long,\" he says,\n\" as we consider only the evidence of telepathy between persons at\nno great distance from one another, it is possible to make the facts\nappear compatible with the mechanistic assumption by uttering the\n4\nblessed ' word '\nbrain-waves.' But the strain upon the mechanistic\nassumption becomes insupportable by it when we consider the fol-\nlowing facts : Minute studies of automatic writings, and especially\nthose recently reported under the head of 'Cross-correspondence,' have\nshown that such writings frequently reveal knowledge of facts which\ncould not have been acquired by the writer by normal means, and\ncould not have been telepathically communicated by any living person\nin the neighbourhood of the writer. In short, the evidence is such\nthat the keenest adverse critics of the view which sees in these\nwritings the expression of the surviving personalities of deceased\npersons, are driven to postulate as the only possible alternative\nexplanation of some of them the direct communication of complex\nand subtle thoughts between persons separated by hundreds and even\nthousands of miles. . . . Unless, then, we are prepared to adopt the\nsupposition of a senseless and motiveless conspiracy of fraud among\na number of persons who have shown themselves to be perfectly\nupright and earnest in every other relation, we must recognise that\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 363\nwe stand before the dilemma\u2014survival or telepathy of this far-reaching\nkind. The acceptance of either horn of the dilemma is fatal to the\nmechanistic scheme of things.\"\nI do not think much exception will be taken to this reasoning\nby those who have devoted most time and attention to the subject.\nTwo observations, however, may perhaps usefully be made.\nFirst, telepathy and survival, although presented in the argument\nas alternatives, do not really exclude each other. On the contrary,\nto establish either is to render the other more probable : and it is\nplausible to assume that if spirits exist and can communicate with\nhuman beings, the process by which they do so is of like nature with\ntelepathy between embodied minds.\nSecondly, I do not think the facts can be said to show that distance\nis an entirely negligible factor in telepathy, though there is not a\nshred of evidence that anything resembling the law of inverse squares\nis applicable to it. That being the case, the admission that \" the\nexplanation of telepathy at close quarters by the hypothesis of '\nbrain-\nwaves ' transmitted through the ether cannot be absolutely rejected,\"\ndoes in some degree weaken the case for assigning to it a purely\npsychical nature ; and undoubtedly the analogy of wireless telegraphy\nseems plausible to many people. It may be as well to point out,\ntherefore, that wireless telegraphy depends for its effectiveness entirely\non the use of symbols, whereas there is good reason to believe that\nin telepathy there is in many cases a direct communication of meanings.\nThe analogy with wireless telegraphy would be more to the point if\nit could be shown that telepathic communication always takes the\nform of language, or, on the other hand, that wireless telegraphy could\ndirectly convey a complex picture or an abstract idea.\nThe analogy with wireless telegraphy fails also, I believe, in another\nrespect of capital importance. There appears to be something in tele-\npathy which I may describe as selective action, and which cannot be\nexplained on mechanistic principles. By the selective action of tele-\npathy I do not mean that some individuals seem to be capable of\nbeing acted upon telepathically, and others not, or not to any notice-\nable extent. This might be paralleled in wireless telegraphy by\nappropriate \"tuning\" of the receiving instruments. The brain, it might\nbe said, requires to be \" tuned \" to the proper pitch in order to\nrespond. The selective action I have in mind is something different,\nand seems rather to consist in a power on the part of the agent\nso to direct the telepathic communication that it reaches some par-\nticular person for whom it is intended and no other. I believe there\n\f364 The Right Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nis evidence for selective action in this sense, but no doubt more\nevidence is required before it can be considered as firmly established.\nIn dealing with the psycho-physics of memory, Mr. M'Dougall\nfollows Professor Bergson in distinguishing sharply between habit and\ntrue memory. Habit, it is admitted, has neural association for its\nbasis ; but true memory cannot be identified with habit. The essential\nelement in true memory is meaning; and meaning, Mr. M'Dougall\nholds, as we have seen, to be a purely psychical product of psychical\nactivity, and to be without any correlate in the brain-process. Never-\ntheless, even in true memory, as we know it, habit always enters as\na co-operating factor ; and accordingly, the view of mental retention\nput forward by the author is \"intermediate between the two extreme\nviews that have long been opposed to one another, the view that\nit is wholly conditioned by neural structure and the view that it is\nconditioned wholly in some immaterial fashion.\"\nMr. M'Dougall proceeds to give what he calls a \"suggestion towards\na theory of memory.\" It is too long to be quoted verbatim here,\nand not easy to summarise: indeed, I am not sure that I can fully\ngrasp his thought. If I understand him rightly, the theory requires\nthat we should conceive of the soul as having a \" psychical struc-\nture \" consisting in persistent \"psychical dispositions,\" which are not\nthemselves meanings, bat only persistent conditions of meanings.\nFrom this point of view the soul may be regarded as a kind of\nrepository of potential meanings, which may be added to by experi-\nence. But in order to be actualized, the potential meanings require\na sensory content, and a sensory content is essentially the expres-\nsion of psycho-physical interaction. Consciousness, therefore, as we\nknow it, is impossible without the interaction of soul and body.\nThis interaction, however, \"can be initiated either from the neural\nside (in accordance with the conjunction of sense stimuli and pre-\nformed habits or neural associations), when it brings meanings to\nconsciousness ; or from the psychical side, by meanings which demand\nspecific sensory complexes for the completion of ideas, and which thus\nin turn, through the medium of sensation, bring neural dispositions\ninto play.\"\nMr. M'Dougall claims for his theory of memory that it is one\n\" which is consistent with all the empirical data, especially all those\nwhich show the dependence of sensation and imagery upon the\nintegrity of the brain, and which yet relieves us of the impossible\ntask of conceiving a physical basis for all memory, and allows us to\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 365\nbelieve that true memory is conditioned by the persistence of modifi-\ncation of psychical structure or capacities.\"\nI forbear to express any opinion on this theory here. It obviously\npresents some considerable difficulties. The conception of the soul\nas a being with \"psychic dispositions\" seems to take us straight into\nmetaphysics, and is not likely to pass unchallenged ; and if meanings\ncannot exist in consciousness without a sensory context, it is not\neasy to see how the initiation of ideas can come from the psychical\nside at all. But accepting the theory as it stands, readers will\nnot fail to perceive its possible bearing on the question of survival,\nand if they turn to the last chapter of the book they will see how\nfrankly the conclusions to which it seems to lead are accepted by the\nauthor.\nMr. M'Dougall criticises the Cartesian description of the soul as a\n\" thinking being,\" on the ground that it goes beyond the evidence\nat present available. \"Our evidence at present allows us to say\nonly that the soul thinks or is conscious (realises its capacities or\npotentialities) when interacting with some bodily organism; psycho-\nphysical interaction may be, for all we know, a necessary condition\nof all consciousness. For all the thinking or consciousness of which\nwe have positive knowledge is of embodied minds or souls. . . .\nRather than say that the soul is a thinking being, we must then\nsay that it is a being capable of being stimulated to conscious\nactivities through the agency of the body or brain with which it\nstands in relations of reciprocal influence.\"\nSo long as we confine ourselves to empirical data, and so long\nas no convincing empirical evidence of survival is produced, this\ncriticism is justified. Indeed, it hardly goes far enough. For instead\nof saying \"Our evidence at present allows us to say only that the\nsoul is conscious when interacting with some bodily organism,\" we\nought rather to put it, \"Our evidence at present allows us to say\nonly that the soul exists when interacting with a bodily organism.\"\nFor on the supposition mentioned there would clearly be no empirical\nevidence for the continued existence of a disembodied soul. But if,\nnotwithstanding this, we assume the truth of survival as being, though\nnot supported by empirical data, yet not actually inconsistent with\nthem, what kind of continued existence would be left to the soul\nby Mr. M'Dougall's theory of memory?\nI am afraid the answer to this question will be profoundly unsatis-\nfactory to those to whom the conception of a survival of the\npersonality is dear. It is true that the theory bids us regard the\n\f3C6 The Rigid Hon. G. W. Balfour. [part\nsoul as a sum of psychical capacities which can be built up during\nbodily life, and which it may be permissible to conceive as con-\ntinuing to exist in their more developed form after bodily death\nand this is one deerree better than the view which treats the soul\nas a system of unchanging potentialities, actualised by interaction\nwith the body, but carrying none of its developed powers into\nanother state of existence, if there be such a state. But the crucial\nquestion still remains : Is it consistent with Mr. M'Dougall's theory\nto suppose that the surviving soul carries with it into the other state\nof existence such memories as would enable it to be conscious of\nitself as the same enduring personality notwithstanding the transi-\ntion 1. If I understand him rightly, his answer would be in the\nnegative. This is an essential element in the popular view, and he\nexpressly rejects the popular view. \"The popular view,\" he tells\nus, \"though it has been maintained in modern times by Lotze, a\nphilosopher of the first rank, cannot be reconciled with the fact\nthat the make up of human personality includes many habits that\nare unquestionably rooted in the structure of the nervous system.\nIt conflicts also with all the large mass of evidence which indicates\nthe dependence of all the sensory content of consciousness, all\nsensation and all imagery, on the integrity of the brain.\"\nConcerning these speculations, all I would say is that we really\nhave no evidence to go upon that can afford any ground for definite\nconclusions. As I have already pointed out, if we rest upon\nempirical data only, and exclude or reject the evidence for survival\ncollected by the Society for Psychical Research, there is no reason\nwhy we should assume that the soul exists at all after the death\nof the body. If, on the other hand, we do assume this, then we\nought to recognise that it is very unsafe to infer the capacities or\nincapacities of the disembodied soul (of which, ex hypothesi, we have\nno experience) from those which belong to, or which we attribute\nto, the embodied soul. For aught we know, the body may inhibit\nas well as stimulate the capacities of the soul ; and in the region\nof memory in particular, which would seem to be of the essence of\nconsciousness, a very wide field of conjecture lies open.\nMr. M'Dougall himself, I may note in conclusion, by no means\ntreats with contempt the endeavour of psychical researchers to obtain\nempirical evidence on the question of survival. On the contrary,\nhe admits that \" a considerable mass of evidence pointing in the\ndirection of survival has been accumulated,\" and although hitherto,\n\fLXVI.] Revieivs. 367\nin his opinion, the character of the evidence has \"fallen just short\"\nof the perfection required to \" produce conviction in the mind of\nan impartial observer,\" he clearly contemplates the possibility that\nmore conclusive results may be attained in the future. Now such\nresults must from the nature of the case include proof that the\nsupposed surviving personality retains some of the memories of its\nearthly life. Let us imagine for a moment that convincing evidence\nof survival were to be actually obtained. It is quite certain that\nin such an event all preconceptions as to the capacity for memory\nin disembodied souls based upon observation of life in the body\nwould be swept away like cobwebs. Probably, in the new light\nthus cast back upon psychological problems, Mr. M'Dougall might\nhave to revise his theory of memory : but we may be sure, from\nthe candour and openness of mind shown in every page of the work\nnow under review, that no man would be more willing to modify\neven his most cherished views the moment the facts appeared to\nrequire it.\nGerald W. Balfour.\nDie Psychoanalyse Freuds. Verteidigung und kritische Bemerkungen.\nVon Prof. Dr. E. Bleuler. (Jahrbuch fur psychoanalytische und\npsychopathologische Forschungen, Band II. Franz Deuticke.\nLeipzig and Vienna, 1911.)\nThis article, which is published as a separate pamphlet, consists\nlargely of a temperate and effective reply to the impassioned attacks\nwhich have been made upon Freud and his methods of psycho-\nanalysis in German scientific and theological publications. These\nattacks are so fierce, and in many cases so devoid of the calm\nreasoning which should accompany a scientific controversy, that in\nthemselves they furnish a valuable illustration of the power of a\npre-existing complex to determine an attitude of mind and a high\ndegree of emotional feeling in subjects who believe that their con-\nceptions are based solely upon facts and logic. The same pheno-\nmenon is probably familiar to all those who have at any time\ndiscussed the problems of Psychical Research with persons who are\ninsufficiently acquainted with its aims and methods, but who \"feel\nstrongly \" that such investigations are a waste of time.\nBut, besides these attacks, there are a few criticisms which are\nput forward on more logical grounds. These are directed chiefly\nagainst the therapeutic application of Freud's psychology, and, though\n\f368 V. J. Woolley, M.D. [part\nit is generally admitted that a number of neuroses have been cured\nthrough psycho-analysis, the critics would contend that the cure\nmight have been as well produced by other psycho-therapeutic methods,\nand especially by suggestion, to the operation of which any psycho-\nanalytic cure is ascribed. 1\nProfessor Bleuler's reply is that even if\nthe effects are due to suggestion, certain cases have been cured which\nhave not proved amenable to suggestion in any other form, and\nthat the discovery of a new method of suggestion is of great thera-\npeutic value. He considers, however, that the process is essentially\ndifferent from and superior to suggestion directed against what he\nconsiders to be merely symptoms. Though the beneficial effects of\nfacing boldly any disagreeable emotion or memory are known to all,\nwithout analysis the most important factor may remain hidden from\nconsciousness and so be unknown to both patient and physician.\nFinally, the suggestions of the psycho-analyst are often directly\nantagonistic to the patient's own wishes instead of coinciding with\nthem as in the usual forms of suggestion.\nIn the field of psycho-therapy it is clear that there are two almost\ndiametrically opposed methods of treatment, and this particular\nportion of Bleuler's defence may well be emphasized as shewing the\ncontrast between them. On the one hand is the older suggestion,\nwhether conveyed during hypnosis or waking or in some inter-\nmediate condition. On the other is the psycho-analytic method.\nThe former seeks to aid the patient to dismiss altogether from his\nmind the disturbing element which both schools alike recognize as\nthe cause of his trouble. If he succeeds in banishing it completely,\nso completely that it is no longer able to affect his mental being at\nall, clearly he will be cured. But according to the psycho-analyst\nthat is impossible. Nothing can be forgotten or put away so com-\npletely. By mere suggestion the unwelcome complex is but driven\ndeeper into the unconscious, where it can work perhaps more\neffectively than before. Thus the psycho-analyst tries to bring it up\ninto the fullest consciousness so that it may be faced, and thus lose\nits power to produce those psycho-physical results which he has\nlearnt to look upon as the expression in consciousness of a desire\nwhich is not allowed to be present there in a recognizable form.\nHere surely is the crux of the whole dispute : is it or is it not a\ngood thing to bring into consciousness ideas which each individual\nfor himself endeavours, consciously or unconsciously, to maintain\nbelow the threshold 1 The final answer must depend on the results\n1\nCt Dr. T. W. Mitchell, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXIV., p. 68.\n\fLXVI.] Reviews. 369\nobtained by the two methods, and both claim startling successes.\nDoes it not seem probable that for the less serious conditions\nsuggestion may suffice, while there are more obstinate neuroses\nwhich will not yield to a conservative treatment ? Metaphors are\ndangerous and generally unsound, but the present writer would\nsuggest that if a bacterial infection is of slight virulence and is taken\nearly it may yield to a treatment of hot fomentations, while under\ndifferent conditions the surgeon's knife provides the only possible\ncure.\nThe critical notes mentioned in the title of the paper are directed\nchiefly against some of the generalisations put forward by Freud's\nfollowers, and only to a very slight extent against Freud's own\nconclusions. The author expresses some doubts as to the invariably\nsexual basis of neuroses, and as to the analyses which have been put\nforward of various historical personages, the latter on the ground\nthat a process which is difficult enough in a living patient becomes\nunreliable when it can only rest on the scanty material of bio-\ngraphies. He also mistrusts the sharp delimitations which some of\nthe psycho-analytic school consider themselves justified in making\nbetween various functional disorders.\nThe article concludes with a demonstration that in his chief con-\nclusions Freud has not advanced anything which is contrary to or\nsubversive of the whole fabric of psychology as it has been built up\nby previous investigators. On the other hand, many of his funda-\nmental propositions were known long before his time. Freud has\nonly developed them into a somewhat unfamiliar shape and united\nthem into a system. As instances may be taken the transference\nof psychical energy from a repressed idea to another which is allowed\nto come to the surface, and the connection of the sexual instinct\nwith hysteria and with \" Angst\n\"\nThe points raised are illustrated by numerous instances from\nProfessor Bleuler's own experience, both among his patients and in\nhimself, and the article will be very acceptable to those who wish\nto read a whole-hearted defence of the psycho-analytic method, but\nwho are repelled by what seems to them the premature dogmatism\nof the more advanced members of the Vienna school.\nV.

Price 3s. 6d. net.)\nDr. Edwin Ash gives ns in Faith anal Suggestion a full and inter-\nesting account of the case of Dorothy Kerin, and he has made it\nthe centre from which to develop his theories on psycho-therapy.\nThis case, it will be remembered, created some sensation last spring\nfrom the notices about it in the newspapers under the title of \" The\nHerne Hill Miracle,\" and Dr. Ash went down to investigate it.\nHe found the girl fairly well and strong after having been bed-\nridden for years and finally apparently moribund.\nEye-witnesses of the last scene gave their testimony ; the patient\nherself described her experiences ; doctors and nurses who had been\nin attendance over a period of years gave accounts of her various\nillnesses; and, finally, Dr. Ash got hospital physicians and Rontgen-\nray specialists to examine the girl and give their reports of her\npresent condition.\nSo we have one of the most complete histories which has been\npublished of these puzzling cases, and the author is justified in\nhoping that it will prove not only of present interest but of value\nfor future reference.\nBriefly, the history is as follows. The girl, aged 24, was supposed\nto be dying of phthisis, with kidney and other complications, and\nher family and friends were collected round her bedside to witness\nthe end, which was momentarily expected. After lying in a semi-\ncomatose state for some hours she suddenly murmured \" I am\nlistening. Who is it 1 Yes, yes\n!\n\" Then she sat up in bed, assured\nher friends she was cured and quite well, and insisted on getting\nout of bed and walking into the next room. From that time she\ngot stronger every day, her natural functions became re-established,\nand she is now quite strong and well.\nShe herself says she heard a voice say distinctly three times\n\"Dorothy!\" then a light came over the bed, and behind it a\nbeautiful angel appeared, who said \"Your sufferings are over! Get\nup and walk.\"\nWe frequently hear of such cures, and it is easy to dismiss them\nas cases of hysteria. Dr. Ash discusses the subject very fairly, and\npoints out that, even if by hysterical we mean imaginary illness,\nthis case would be remarkable ; but he says the testimony of an\nexperienced local doctor who attended her for the last two years is\nthat the girl was really suffering from tuberculosis, and had the\n\fLXVI.] Reviews.\ntypical signs, not only subjective but objective, of that disease. It\nwas not, however, a case of advanced phthisis, as the lay papers\naffirmed, and subsequent examination by experts show no loss of\ntissue or extensive structural changes.\nDr. Ash points out that the disease was undoubtedly serious, and\nthat but for the intervention of a psychic agency death would\nprobably have occurred in a few hours. Her sudden recovery of\nwalking power after being bedridden for five years is sufficiently\nremarkable, for one would expect great atrophy and weakness of\nthe muscles ; but Charcot and others give numerous instances of\nsudden accessions of strength from emotional causes apart from\nreligious influences.\nThe analogy of such cases to that of Bernadotte of Lourdes is of\ncourse obvious, and is dwelt upon by Dr. Ash. He discusses at\nlength the action of hypnotism and suggestion, and as he objects\nto the mere classification of a disease as hysteria being considered\nsufficient definition of a morbid state, so he objects to the term\nsuggestion alone being considered sufficient explanation of the mode\nof cure. He argues that suggestion may act on the body through\nthe mind in several different ways and on different planes, e.g. on\na low mental plane, as when the patient is cured through appealing\nto his imagination by a bread pill which he takes for a powerful\ndrug ;\nby hypnotic suggestion, which enables the physician to act on\nthe subliminal consciousness ;\nby appeal to a spiritual force outside\nourselves, as in the pilgrimages to Lourdes and by healers of the\nSalvation Army type. Dr. Ash thinks the efficacy of the particular\nmethod of suggestion depends upon the temperament of the patient,\nand he tells us that Dorothy Kerin is a young woman of strong\nreligious feelings, and much given to praying for the relief of her\nfriends' illnesses and troubles. She was therefore accessible to the\nhighest and most spiritual form of influence, and he is inclined to\nbelieve her cure was brought about by an agency or force outside\nherself. In support of this view he quotes largely from Myers,\nWilliam James, Sir Oliver Lodge, and other distinguished members\nof the S.P.R., as well as from the writings of Drs. McComb\nand Worcester, Mr. Percy Dearmer, and other clergymen who have\ntaken up the subject of spiritual healing.\nIt appears that Dorothy Kerin was once subjected to some hypnotic\nexperiments, but she believed they were wrong and successfully\nresisted hypnosis. Charcot has told us how he occasionally sent\nhysterical patients to Lourdes, thinking they would benefit more\n\f372 Chas.

In each case, for instance, there are the appearance\nof a bright light and the suggestions of a hallucinatory voice. It\nwill be interesting to note the future of these girls.\nDorothy Kerin thinks she has been restored to health in order\nto carry on good works, and Dr. Ash argues that her unselfish and\nspiritual character justifies her being selected for cure by the Higher\nPowers when so many invalids are allowed to suffer and die unaided.\nWhatever view may be taken, Dr. Ash has put the subject before\nthe reader in a very impartial and readable form.\nChas.

This branch has been\nmeeting from time to time for discussion, and the reading of\npapers bearing upon the subject. Although there is still much\nprejudice and not a little ignorance to combat, the efficacy of\ntreatment by hypnotic suggestion in suitable cases has become so\nwidely known and appreciated that many physicians now send\ntheir patients for treatment, and large numbers of the public seek\nit themselves. This being the case, the need of a Clinic, where\nthe poorer classes can receive treatment, has become an urgent\nnecessity. This matter has been under the consideration of the\nLiverpool branch of the Society for some time, and after much\neffort among patients' friends and sympathisers, a sufficient sum\nhas been collected to enable us to make the venture. The ground\nfloor of a Nursing Home has been rented at 8 Maryland Street in\nthe neighbourhood of Eodney Street. It consists of three rooms\na small one which will be used as a consulting room for the\nvisiting physician of the day, another larger room, which will be\nused as a waiting-room, and a third, still larger room, which will\nbe used for treating patients, three or four at a time. All these are\nalready furnished, and will only require the addition of a few\neasy chairs, etc., some needful stationery, and other details, which\nwill be supplied by the Society in good time for the opening.\nPatients will be expected to pay Is. for the first sitting, and\n\f374 The Liverpool Psycho-Therapeutic Clinic, [part lxvi.\n3d. for each subsequent one found necessary ;\nabsolutely destitute\npatients, who have been certified as such, will, of course, receive\nfree treatment ; and those able to pay more, but not enough for\nprivate treatment, will be encouraged to do so, and all money so\nreceived will be utilised for the support of the Clinic. A\nmanaging committee consisting of the three medical officers and\nthe medical Hon. Treasurer, together with three laymen and the\nlay Hon. Secretary, will be selected to supervise the affairs of the\nInstitution.\nThus, then, on Monday, November 11th, 1912, Liverpool will\nhave the honour of founding the first Clinic of this kind in Great\nBritain under the direction of medical men for the treatment\nof the sick poor.\nA.

JOSEPH MAXWELL'S PAPER ON\n\" CROSS-CORRESPONDENCES AND THE EXPERI-\nMENTAL METHOD.\" 1\nBy MRS. HENRY SIDGWICK.\nDr. Maxwell's paper, as its title indicates, is partly occupied\nwith criticising the general methods of those who in our\nProceedings have written about the automatic scripts of Mrs.\nand Miss Verrall, Mrs. Holland, Mrs. Willett, and Mrs. Piper,\nand partly with detailed comments on particular cases. In\nmy reply I shall concern myself chiefly with the question of\nthe general methods, only going into particular cases so far as\nmay be needed to illustrate my points. Incidentally, a reply\non general methods meets a good deal of what M. Maxwell\nhas to say about particular cases, because much of this depends,\nI think, on misunderstanding of the general methods ; and\nsome further reply dealing with particular cases is given in\n1\nProceedings, Part LXV., pp. 57-145.\n2B\n\f370 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nappendices to this paper by Mrs. Verrall, Miss Johnson and\nMr. Piddington. But in fact the general methods are much\nmore important than the particular cases. The value of\nmost of what has been written in the Proceedings of late\nyears by Mrs. Verrall, Miss Johnson, Mr. Piddington, Sir Oliver\nLodge, and to a minor extent myself, depends on these methods.\nIf our meaning and aim, our assumptions and what we think\nis proved, can be so much misunderstood as they seem to\nhave been by an able and industrious critic of M. Maxwell's\neminence, it is to be feared that others also may have failed\nto grasp the points, and it may well be worth while to go\nover them again in the light of M. Maxwell's criticisms.\nBefore doing so, I should like to thank M. Maxwell for\ntaking so much trouble to put before us the impression the\nwork on cross-correspondences has made on him. It is only\nwhen those who study the subject will express their views\nthat we can have the kind of discussion which may help\ntowards the solution of the very complicated and difficult\nproblems raised on any hypothesis by these automatic scripts.\nWe are the more indebted to him\u2014and though I am not\ngoing to speak of the \" Latin Message,\" I should like to say\nthis also of Mrs. Hude 1\n\u2014because, not being an Englishman,\nhe has had the additional trouble of dealing with a language\nnot his own. His knowledge of English, indeed, is almost\nperfect ;\nstill, here and there he is led into mistakes which,\nI think, an Englishman would not have made. For instance,\nI doubt whether an English-speaking person would have\nthought the sarcasm which M. Maxwell applies on his first\npage to Dr. Hodgson fair comment. Dr. Hodgson thinks Mrs.\nPiper's trance personalities communicate by writing without\nbeing conscious of the process of writing,'\n2\nbut this is very\ndifferent from not being conscious of what they say, which is\nhow M. Maxwell interprets \" not conscious of writing.\" Again,\nno English-speaking person would, I think, interpret \" papers\n\"\nas newspapers (\"gazettes\") in the particular connexion in\nwhich the word occurs in the incident referred to on p. 73\n1\nMrs. Hude's article on this subject appeared in Proceedings, Part LXV.,\npp. 147-170.\n\" Whether we agree with Dr. Hodgson's view or not is another question.\nI am myself disposed to think it at any rate far too sweeping.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Br. Joseph Maxivell's Paper. 377\nof M. Maxwell's paper (where it obviously means documents).\nNor to an Englishman would \"the Lawns of Lea\" (p. 99)\nsuggest the idea of Leah, Eachel's sister, because he would\nperceive that Lea rhymes with Sea. It actually does so in\nthe script in question, which is partly in verse. (Oddly\nenough, M. Maxwell attributes to Mrs. Verrall this association\nof Lea and Leah, though without the slightest justification\nthat I can perceive.) Such linguistic errors as I have been\nspeaking of are, however, very few.\nLet me, before I proceed to my reply to M. Maxwell, add\nthat there are interesting points in his paper. For instance,\nthe purely accidental coincidence which he has discovered\nbetween certain scripts and the poems of Lamartine\u2014though\nit can only be made to fit by ignoring the reference of the\nscripts to Gautier and Hugo\u2014is striking, and might well\nhave figured in Miss Johnson's paper on \"Chance Coincidences\"\n(Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 158-330). It is a useful warning,\nif one were needed, against attaching too much importance to\na single coincidence, even of a striking kind.\nThen again, he refers (pp. 142, 143), though with too little\ndetail and too little confirmation, to what appear to be\ninteresting telepathic incidents observed by himself. The cases\nof \"Clementine\" and of the butterflies are full of suggestion\nas to the working of telepathy, and may be usefully com-\npared with some of our experiments with percipients hypnotised\nby Mr. G. A. Smith {Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 536-596).\nAgain, certain criticisms made by M. Maxwell are just.\nProbably all readers agree with him that scripts should, if\npossible, be exhibited in a less scrappy manner, in a manner\nshowing better the connexion of different parts of a script,\nthan was done in Mrs. Verrall's first paper. It makes it more\ndifficult for the would-be critical reader, though often easier\nfor the more general reader, to have the script cut up into\nsnippets. It was natural, in an analytical description of her\nscript, such as Mrs. Verrall's is, to illustrate the different\npoints by the appropriate fragments, or the mere statement\nthat some topic occurred in the script at such a date, other\nportions of the same script illustrating other points being\nsometimes discussed in other parts of the paper. With\nfurther experience those who have discussed the scripts have\n\f378 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich [part\nlearnt that there is apt to be something confusing in this\nway of treating them, and that it may tend to the obscur-\ning of interesting points, evidential and other. Accordingly,\nin more recent papers, scripts have been given in a more\ncomplete form.\nThe mention of Mrs. Verrall's original paper on her own\nscript (Proceedings, Vol. XX.) leads me from details to the\nfundamental points which, as I have said, I propose\nmainly to discuss in this paper. M. Maxwell's first criticism\non our methods (p. 130) is that on our plan \"we must\nadmit the automatists' good faith \" ;\n\" The medium's good\nfaith must be implicitly admitted as an element in the\n^experiment \" ; and that as a matter of method this is\nwrong ; the need for her good faith should be eliminated.\nIt is of course quite true that the value of our evidence\ndepends very largely on the good faith of the automatists ; but\nI should put the matter somewhat differently myself, and say\nthat the automatic writers, when the writing is not produced\nin trance, are inevitably themselves investigators, usually fellow-\ninvestigators with others, but investigators. And no scientific\nobservations or experiments are independent of the good\nfaith of the investigators. An investigator may sometimes\nproduce objective evidence that he is not self-deceived, but his\ngood faith has to be taken on trust. I believe that in orthodox-\nscience\u2014biology, physics, etc.\u2014bogus experiments have been\nput forward on one or two occasions, though extremely rarely.\nAs a rule, however, the known character of the observers or\nexperimenters concerned renders deception so improbable that\nthe danger need hardly be taken into account ; and the\nimprobability is in most cases rendered enormously greater\nby the fact that deception would involve collusion, as is also\nof course the case with cross-correspondences. We must admit,\nhowever, that in the orthodox sciences few important facts\nare fully accepted until the experiments or observations on\nwhich they rest have been repeated by others, and that here\npsychical research is at a disadvantage in being limited so\nmuch as it is to observation. Progress is always slow when\nknowledge depends on observation of phenomena occurring\nspontaneously, and neither on lines nor at times selected by\nthe observer ; and it is partly because in psychical research\n\fLxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxivell's Paper. 379\nwe can as yet seldom repeat experiments at will that we\nadvance only slowly in our interpretation.\nM.

His point was that if any one, one's best\nfriend or indeed oneself, professes, e.g., to move an object\nsupernormally\u2014say raise a table without touching it \u2014it is\nnecessary, before accepting the phenomenon, not only to feel\nconfident that there has been no conscious deception, but that\nthere has been no unconscious deception\u2014no action of the\nsubliminal self tending to move the table unknown to the\nsupraliminal self. In cases like this the medium may no\ndoubt help the investigator, but ought to be relieved of all\nresponsibility as an investigator himself.\nQuite apart from cryptonmesia, with which I shall deal\npresently, a similar difficulty may occur in the case of automatic\nwriting. I think it does occur in some of Mr. Stainton\nMoses' experiences; those for instance in which, he being\nalone, his script by request quotes passages verbatim from\nbooks in the room.1\nIn such cases very careful precautions\nwould be needed to make it quite certain that the automatist\nhad not, unknown to his normal consciousness, looked into the\nbook.\nI should like to know how M. Maxwell would propose\nto investigate automatic script, produced otherwise than in\ntrance, without letting the automatists share in the responsibility.\nWould he keep them in solitary confinement ? Or does he,\nperhaps, think that automatic script is not a proper subject\nfor scientific investigation at all ? But that would seem rather\narbitrary. And would he equally exclude from investigation\nall introspective psychology, all analysis of subjective sensations,\n1\nSee Proceeding*, Vol. XI., pp. 106-7, and Human Personality, Vol. II.,\npp. 591-2.\n\f380 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nall accounts of dreams, visions, hallucinations, which from the\nnature of the case must be given by the percipients themselves ?\nThere is one thing perhaps worth noting at this point\nconcerning evidence in automatic writing for supernormally\nacquired knowledge\u2014cross-correspondences and the like. It\nis that, from a purely evidential point of view, it does not\nmatter whether the writing is automatic or not. Of course I\ndo not mean that the fact that it is automatic is not important.\nThe study of automatism is of great psychological interest, and\nI think it will be admitted that in the various studies on it\nthat have appeared in our Proceedings, especially of recent\nyears, we have given to the world much material for such\npsychological study. Automatism may, too, in time, not only\ngive us evidence for, e.g., telepathy, but give us clues to the\nprocesses involved. A cross-correspondence, however, might be\njust as good evidentially without any automatic writing at all.\nFor instance, if an idea came into Mrs. Verrall's head accom-\npanied by an impression that Mrs. Holland had the same\nidea, and she recorded this idea and this impression in\nordinary writing, and if on the same day Mrs. Holland inde-\npendently recorded the same idea, we should have prima facie\nevidence for telepathy between them, though no automatic\nwriting had been produced at all. For this reason contem-\nporaneous impressions of the automatists about the meaning\nof their scripts may have evidential value. For instance, if\nMrs. Verrall records, before she knows that any cross-corre-\nspondence is involved, that the \" storied mount \" of her script\ncan only be Dante's Mount of Purgatory, then this interpre-\ntation must be taken as an integral part of the evidence to\nbe considered. It does not matter that to M. Maxwell, or\nto any one else, it may seem an absurd way of describing\nthat mount.1\nI suppose it is partly at least because of his view that\nautomatic writers should not be investigators of their own\nwriting that M. Maxwell objects (p. 58) to Mrs. Verrall's\ndiscussion of her writing in Vol. XX. Mrs. Verrall, he says,\n1\nMrs. Verrall understood by \"storied mount\" the mount of which Dante\ntold the story : \"storied\" in this sense being equivalent to the Latin\n\"fabulosua.\" I, like M. Maxwell, read it as \"la montagne etagee,\"\nalthough in the latter sense the usual spelling would be \" storeyed \" mount.\nThe point is of course quite unimportant.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 381\ncould not with the utmost goodwill be impartial ; one cannot\nbe judge in one's own case. But what is Mrs. Verrall's case ?\nWhat is her side and what is the other side ? In what way\ndo her interests come in ? What is the thesis she supports,\nand disagreement with which would disappoint her? M. Maxwell\napparently assumes (p. 61) very gratuitously that she starts\nwith a conviction of the supernormal value of her scripts. I\nbelieve the truth is that we have here in the background an\nassumption which M. Maxwell makes about all the investigators\n\u2014one which he has not, I think, fully expressed anywhere,\nunless it be a propos of Dr. Hodgson (on p. 58), because it\nhas not occurred to him to doubt its validity, but which\nnevertheless is always in his mind, and explains criticisms\nwhich otherwise seem scarcely intelligible. I take him to\nassume that all the writers whom he criticises, with whom I\nshould like to associate myself and whom I may therefore for\nshortness call we, have adopted and are defending the hypo-\nthesis that the intelligences directing the automatic script are\nin all cases, or at least in all where there is any evi-\ndence in the writing of supernormally acquired knowledge,\nspirits of the dead ; and further that those spirits are responsible\nfor the wording of the script. In other words he takes us\nto assume that the scripts are verbally inspired by spirits.\nEegarding this as our view,\n1\nhe then proceeds to argue, like\nthe critics described by Miss Johnson in her last report on\nthe Holland script {Proceedings, Vol. XXV., p. 292), that the\nscripts are either produced by the influence, say, of Mr. Myers,\nor they are not ; but there are passages in them unlike Mr.\nMyers ; therefore Mr. Myers cannot have produced them, and\ntherefore our supposed contention falls to the ground.\nBut this would be beginning at the wrong end. The\nproblem does not present itself to us in this way at all ; and\nafter all we have written, it is disappointing that any of our\nreaders should imagine that it does. What we do is to start\nwith the undeniable fact that in automatic writing the intelli-\ngence directing the writing is not the normal waking intelli-\ngence of the automatist. It is an intelligence working simul-\ntaneously with, and to a considerable extent independently of,\n1\nCf. p. 58, 2nd and 3rd paragraphs; p. 60, '2nd paragraph; p. 125, 3rd and\n4th paragraphs ; p. 139, 3rd paragraph.\n\f382 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nthe normal waking intelligence. It presents in its workings\nobvious resemblances to the intelligence manifested in our\ndreams, and whatever other elements it may possess, it is to\na large extent, as we all agree, a dissociated phase or portion\nof the automatist's own personality.\nFrom the fact that its thoughts are recorded in writing we\nhave, however, permanent and stable data for studying it, absent\nin the case of rapidly fading dreams. Automatic writing, in\nfact, at least affords material for studying dissociated personality\nif it does nothing more. And a large part of Mrs. Verrall's\nanalysis of her own script in Vol. XX. is a study of this kind;\nand so is a great deal of Miss Johnson's account of Mrs.\nHolland's script. So far the matter might have been left to\northodox psychology, though indirectly it has, of course, an\nimportant bearing on the problems of psychical research. The\nquestions with which we are more immediately concerned begin\nwhen we find that the writing intelligence somehow appears\nto have access to information to which the normal self of the\nautomatist has not got access. We have then first to make\nup our minds whether this really is so, and secondly, if it is,\nto discover (a) what light, if any, is thereby thrown on the\nnature of the intelligence directing the writing ;\n(b) the mode\nin which the information reaches this intelligence ; and (c) the\nsource of the information.\nThe first question of course is, \u2014Are the coincidences between\nthe scripts under consideration, and either other scripts or\nexternal facts, beyond what we can reasonably attribute to\nchance ? The answer which we each of us make to this\nquestion will depend on individual judgment. I confess to\nfeeling no doubt whatever myself that they are too numerous,\nand many of them too striking, to be attributed to chance.\nM. Maxwell apparently decides otherwise, but, if I may say so,\nI think he hardly gives himself a fair chance of judging,\nbecause he so often confuses the issue. Take for instance\nthe case he begins with, the \"sphere-spear\" case (p. 59 and cf.\nProcccdinr\/s, Vol. XX., pp. 213-217). In America on January 28,\n1902, Dr. Hodgson suggests to the Piper communicator (MyersP\nat the moment) to appear to Miss Verrall with a spear in his\nhand. Spear was at first misheard as \" sphere,\" but finally\nthe experiment with \"spear\" was agreed on. On January 31,\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 383\nas the result of a strong impulse to write, Mrs. Verrall pro-\nduces a script in which occurs sphere in Greek and an\nexpression in Latin (volatile ferrum) which she translates\n\" spear.\" Miss Verrall is left out, but otherwise the coincidence\nwill seem to most people striking. M. Maxwell objects to it\nchiefly because, in his opinion, volatile ferrum, which is an\nexpression of Virgil's, means \" arrow,\" and not \" spear.\" Mrs.\nVerrall can give scholarly reasons for attributing to Virgil the\nmeaning \"spear.\" But what Virgil meant is really entirely\nirrelevant from the evidential point of view, for Mrs. Verrall\nremoved all ambiguity from her script by recording before she\nheard anything about the experiment in America that in her\nopinion her script meant \" spear.\"\nA rather curious indication of the way in which M. Maxwell's\nestimate of coincidences differs from ours may be found on\np. 86, where, in criticising Mr. Piddington's paper on \" Con-\ncordant Automatisms \" in Proceedings, Vol. XXII., he says that,\nin order to make the most favourable case for the experimenters,\nhe will analyse only their best cases, and proceeds to discuss\nas one of these \" Celestial Halcyon Days,\" about which Mr.\nPiddington says (Vol. XXII., p. 103) that it is one of a\nnumber of \" rather vague coincidences,\" and that he discusses\nit \" chiefly, if not entirely, on account of its association witli\nthe important group of phenomena ... to be dealt with in\nthe next section.\"\nA large proportion of the coincidences which impress us are\nrejected by M. Maxwell on the ground that they are concerned\nwith such common words that their occurrence in the scripts\nof several automatists, even at approximately the same time,\nsignifies nothing. He gives on p. 86 a list of such words,\nnamely, Steeple, Hope, Star, Arrow, Giant and Dwarf, Laurel\nwreath, Violets, Cup, Spirit and Angel, Mountains Seas Lakes\nand Pavers, Music, Azure, Horizon. Another list of very\ncommon words (mots tres communs), given on p. 101, is\nSpirit, Shadow, Umbrae, East, West, Daffodils. To these he\nadds a list of commonplace ones (banals,\u2014the word banal\noccurs very frequently in his paper as a criticism) ; these\nare : Euripides, Orion, Hercules, Cytherea, Aphrodite, etc. The\ncprestion of commonness, from the point of view that now\nconcerns us, is, of course, relative to the scripts. A rare word\n\f384 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nin ordinary letter writing might be common in the scripts,\nand vice versa. Some of the above words occur relatively often\nand some rarely in the scripts. To aid the readers judgment\nas to their commonness, Mr. Piddington generally indicates the\noccasions on which they have appeared in the scripts written\nduring the period covered by the experiments. But unless\na word is very rare indeed in ordinary usage, and the time\ncoincidence is very exact, we want more than the mere\noccurrence of the word in two scripts. We want it to be\near-marked in one or both scripts as intended for a cross-\ncorrespondence, or in some way strongly emphasized.\n1\nOr we\nwant it combined in both scripts with some other word or\nwords. M. Maxwell seems to ignore this ear-marking of words\naltogether. Does he, I wonder, object to experiments in\nthought-transference with cards or numbers, because of the\nundeniable bancdiU of the ideas transferred ?\nOne is sometimes almost tempted to think that M. Maxwell\ndescribes a case as banal when he does not want to take\nfurther trouble in examining it. For instance, he disposes of\nthe Sesame and Lilies case in the single sentence :\n\" La\ncorrespondance sur Sesame and Lilies est d'une grande banalite\n\"\n(p. 122). I suppose he means that Sesame and Lilies is the\ntitle of a well-known book of Euskin's. But if that is all\nhe has observed in the cross-correspondence in question, he\nhas indeed read it hastily. It is in fact, whatever interpre-\ntation we put on it, a most curious case, which no student of\nautomatic writing can afford to neglect. The reader will\nremember that in broad outline the facts we have to deal\nwitli (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 264-318) are that\nautomatists, quite unknown to and unconnected with Mrs.\nVerrall or any of us, called by us Mr. and Miss Mac, produce\nscript at the end of July, 1908, containing the words \"Sesame\nand Lilies,\" and other seeming references to the topic. In\nAugust, 1908, Mrs. and Miss Verrall's scripts produce what,\non comparing them, they take to be an attempt at a cross-\ncorrespondence on \"Sesame and Lilies.\" In September, 1908,\nin consequence of repeated urging through the writing itself\nto send to Mrs. Verrall certain of their scripts\u2014the particular\n1 See the list of cross-correspondences during the experiments of 1906-1907\nhus \"ear-marked\" in the Journal for Jan., 1909 (Vol. XIV.) pp. 24-25.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 385\nscripts meant being defined\u2014the Macs write to her, then a\ntotal stranger, about their experiments, and so the coinci-\ndence of topic is discovered. Eeaders of the Proceedings\nwill remember that there are further curious details about\nthis cross-correspondence, and that there are other cross-\ncorrespondences involved ; but the points I have mentioned\nare enough to raise interesting questions, and to relieve the\ncase\u2014as I should have thought every one must agree\u2014from\nthe charge of banalite. Indeed, it seems to me that banal\nis the last epithet that should be applied to it.\nBut I must go on to other matters. When we conclude\nthat the correspondence with the script or with external facts\nappears to be beyond what mere chance will account for, we\nhave next to examine whether it can be accounted for by\nknowledge unconsciously acquired from normal sources or\nunconsciously remembered. Both these possibilities may for\nevidential purposes be described as cryptomnesia\u2014hidden memory\n\u2014memory available to the subliminal self, but not to the\nsupraliminal. It is an advantage possessed by good cross-\ncorrespondences, whether of the simple or complex kind, that\nthey are, from the nature of the case, free from this particular\ndanger. An automatist cannot have learnt normally and\nforgotten what exists only in another automatist's mind, or in\nher locked-up script ; the two automatists having neither\nconversed nor corresponded in the interval, if any, between\nthe production of the two scripts. I do not know, by the\nway, what M. Maxwell means (p. 139) by saying that cross-\ncorrespondences depend on negative facts, such as, that the\nmediums have no knowledge of antecedent publications. What\nantecedent publications can there be ? Nor can cryptomnesia\naccount for such curious coincidences as either that between\nMrs.Verrall's script and the reading of Marmontel under special\ncircumstances by a man who knew nothing of the script ; or\nthat about the bird and the chalk; because in both these\ncases the events apparently described took place subsequently\nto the scripts.\nThe possibility of cryptomnesia must, however, be allowed for\nin cases like that of Abraham Florentine, to which M.\nMaxwell refers with approval (p. 139). Mr. Stainton Moses\nby table- tilting described with some correct details the recent\n\f386 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part\ndeath of an American named Abraham Florentine, who had\nfought in the war of 1812, of whom he believed he had\nnever heard. It is, however, impossible to feel sure that no\nobituary notice had fallen under his eye\u2014perhaps unnoticed\neven at the time by his normal consciousness; especially as in\ncertain other cases it seems almost certain that such obituary\nnotices were the source of the information given in Mr. Moses'\nscript.\n1\nCryptomnesia is a possibility with which long experience\nin Psychical Kesearch has made us familiar. We have given\ncrucial instances of its occurrence from the scripts under\ndiscussion themselves (see, e.g., Proceedings, Vol. XXL, pp.\n287-9). We have stated more than once in general terms\nthat its possibility must be allowed for even when all we\nknow goes against the supposition that some normal source\nof information has been open to the automatists. Thus Miss\nJohnson even goes so far as to say (Vol. XXL, p. 368) that\n\"no statement in automatic script that has ever been in\nprint, or is of such a nature as to be known to a good\nmany people, can be regarded as really good evidence of\nsupernormal knowledge.\" Mrs. Verrall says, speaking of a\nparticular case (Vol. XXIV, p. 267), \"It may therefore be\ntaken as certain that no knowledge of Proceedings, Vol. XX.,\nwas consciously possessed by the Mac family. At the same\ntime it cannot be proved that at some time the Keport, or\na notice of it, may not have been within reach of one or\nother of the automatists. The point is of importance in\nconnexion with some allusions in the Mac script, but does\nnot affect the value of the greater part of its contents.\"\nMr. Piddington takes great pains to examine and to lay\nbefore the reader all the information he can collect as to\nMrs. Piper's possible sources of information about Lethe (Proc.,\nVol. XXIV, pp. 102-104, etc.) and so forth. We have,\nmoreover, to the best of my belief, never attributed evidential\nimportance to cases where cryptomnesia is a possible explana-\ntion, without giving the reader all the information available\nto enable him to judge how much it should be allowed for.\nWhy, then, does M. Maxwell constantly attribute to us\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XL, pp. 82-85. Cf. Mrs. Thompson's \"Susanna Parkes\ncase, Proceedings, Vol. XVIII., pp. 267-271.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 387\nignorance and neglect of cryptomnesia ? To say the truth, I\nthink it is extremely difficult to explain how a careful reader\ncomes to do so. But one thing is plain: the mistake is\nconnected with a fundamental misunderstanding which pervades\nhis paper. He apparently supposes that we regard the frequent\nquotations or reminiscences of passages in the poets which\noccur in the script as of supernormal origin. Now in certain\ncases, as in the answers to the \" Lethe \" question, the literary\nsources drawn on seem so surprisingly out of the automatist's\nrange, that it is worth while putting before the reader all\nthe material we can collect bearing on the question of what\nliterary sources of information she may have had access to.\nThese' cases remain remarkable, in my opinion, even if we\ndecide on the whole that cryptomnesia played a part in the\nphenomenon. That is to say, the form of, e.g., the answer\ngiven by Mrs. Piper to the Lethe question is very curious,\nis probably instructive, and is certainly suggestive of a super-\nnormal element, even if we conclude, as M. Maxwell does, that\nshe had at some time read a translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses.\nBut for the most part there is no reason whatever\nfor attributing anything supernormal to the literary refer-\nences in the scripts, and it never occurred to us that\nany one could suppose there was, till M. Maxwell sent us\nhis paper. The automatic scripts\u2014especially those produced\nwithout trance and therefore in the presence, as it were, of\nthe waking intelligence\u2014are often obscure, allusive, symbolic,\nand expressed by means of literary quotations. (I will deal\npresently with M. Maxwell's objections to symbolism.) Unless\nwe can find the source of these literary quotations, and thus\ntheir context, we may often lose a valuable aid to interpreting\nthe scripts\u2014and to interpret them is important, if only with\na view to \"the study of the psychological processes of auto-\nmatic messages,\" which M. Maxwell, as well as ourselves, has\nso much at heart (p. 141). We have a good instance in the\ninterpretation of the phrase, \"a knot of blue ribbon,\" which\nseems to M. Maxwell so preposterous (p. 137). The phrase\noccurs at the beginning of a script of Mrs. Verrall's. Has it\na meaning or is it pure irrelevant nonsense? From the\nevidential point of view this question is entirely unimportant;\nits only interest so far as we can see is from the point\n\f388 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nof view of the psychological processes of automatic writing.\nThe name \"John\" occurs very shortly afterwards in the script,\nand this suggests to Mr. Piddington a probable explanation for\nthe knot of blue ribbon, namely, that it emerged on account\nof its association with the name John in a verse with part\nat least of which M. Maxwell might have been familiar had\nhe been brought up in an English nursery\u2014the verse\n\" Oh dear, what can the matter be ?\nJohnny's so long at the fair\nHe promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbon\nTo tie up my bonny brown hair.\"\nNotwithstanding M. Maxwell's scorn, Mr. Piddington's suggestion\nwill, I think, seem to most English people plausible, if not\nconvincing. Comparing this case with others we may suppose\nthe phrase, \" a knot of blue ribbon,\" to be symbolic of the\nname John, though in this particular case the symbol is\nsuperseded by the plain writing of the name immediately\nafterwards.\nSome quotations of course every one recognises at once.\nFor instance, Crossing the Bar, of which M. Maxwell thinks\nthe newspaper Light may be the source in the scripts, is,\nat least so far as the title of the poem is concerned, almost\nas familiar to Englishmen as God save the King. But there\nare other quotations less easy to recognise, for Mrs. and\nMiss Verrall and Mrs. Holland are widely read in literature,\nand their minds appear to be veritable storehouses of literary\nphrases remembered or half remembered. If therefore the\nsource of a phrase is not at once obvious, what seems to\nus the first course to adopt is to ask the automatist, or for\nthe automatist to ask herself, whether she knows where it\ncomes from. If she remembers it supraliminally, then the\nquestion is settled, for there can be no reasonable doubt that\nthe subliminal self must be assumed to have access to supra-\nliminal information.1\nThis plan of asking the automatist\n1\nWhether this is always completely true as regards all supraliminal knowledge\nit is difficult to say. Our dream selves do not seem to be always fully aware of\nour actual surroundings, but in this case it may be argued that the supraliminal\nconsciousness is in abeyance and itself also unaware of impressions it might receive\nthrough the senses. Dr. Hodgson thought there was some evidence that Mrs.\nPiper's trance personality was not always aware of recent experiences of her normal\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 389\nseems simple, and why M. Maxwell should object to it I\ncannot imagine. Why should we try to find out by laborious\nand devious methods what we can so easily learn from the\nautomatist ?\nBut the automatist cannot by any means always tell us\nwhere a quotation comes from. She often does not supra-\nliminally know. When this is the case it has to be searched\nfor, and if found the next point is to ascertain whether at\nsome time it has or may have been in the mind or under\nthe eye of the automatist. So far, hardly any approximately\nexact quotation has been discovered in the scripts which\nthere is any serious difficulty in supposing to have been at\none time or other seen by the automatist. A very curious\nexception is the Latin quotation from Ovid's Fasti given by\nMrs. Holland on March 2, 1910 (see Proceedings, Vol. XXV.,\np. 246), and a few more cases of the kind would give cause\nfor reflection : but one swallow does not make a summer.1\nIt\nis not, then, in the mere use of quotations that we have\nhitherto found evidence of supernormal knowledge. Quotations\nseem as a rule to be merely furniture of the mind which the\nintelligence responsible for the script finds ready to hand.\nOf course, when a phrase in the script resembles one occur-\nring in more than one author, especially if the author actually\nquoted is comparatively obscure, we may sometimes ascribe an\nallusion to the wrong source. One or two instances of this\nhave been discovered or suggested, and lead M. Maxwell to\naccuse us of superficiality in our investigations. In some\ncases such a mistake may lead to misinterpretation of the\nscript. It possibly does so as regards a subordinate point\nthe association with Persephone of Nightingale \u2014in the case\nreferred to by M. Maxwell (on p. 136), when what is sub-\nsequently found to be a quotation from Oscar Wilde had\nbeen taken as an allusion to a verse of Tennyson's. In\nconsciousness. But certainly for evidential purposes it would be very unsafe\nto suppose that the subliminal self had not access to all supraliminal knowledge.\n1\nThere are of course other cases where literary sources apparently unknown\nto the automatist seem to have been drawn upon. For these see Mr.\nPiddington's paper in Proceedings, Part LXV. (p. 245) on \"Two Tenny-\nsonian Quotations \" and the passages he refers to at the end of that paper.\nBut, except in Mrs. Holland's epiotation from Ovid, these cases relate to remini-\nscences of literary passages rather than to quotations.\n\f390 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nother cases it may be of no importance at all. For instance,\nwhen Mrs. Piper said \"Clock! Tick, Tick, Tick, Stairs\"\n(which is not a quotation, by the way), she may have had in\nmind Longfellow's poem, The Old Clock on the Stairs; or\nshe may, as M. Maxwell thinks, following Professor Hyslop's\nsuggestion, have been alluding to the clock on the stairs at\nthe Tavern Club. It really does not matter which, as the\nwhole point is in the words she actually uses. As the\nsimplest theory of their source I myself prefer Longfellow's\npoem ; for I think it practically certain that at school or\nsince Mrs. Piper has met with so well known a poem of\nthe famous American poet ; and it is not equally probable\nthat she ever saw the clock in Mr. Hodgson's club or\nheard of the ceremonies connected with it. Indeed, Prof.\nHyslop regards the phrase, if it refers to the club, of which\nhe does not feel sure, as an indication that we have to do\nwith a persistent memory of Hodgson's rather than with Mrs.\nPiper's mind.1\nM. Maxwell, I note, prefers spiritualistic literature, especially\nthe newspaper Light, as a source of phrases used, to the sources\nsuggested by us, and refers to Light phrases which hardly seem\nto require a literary source at all. For example, \" seven times\nseven,\" uttered by Mrs. Home, is a phrase too undistinctive\nto be regarded as a quotation (unless it be from the multi-\nplication table) ; and I do not know that her actual words,\n\"seven times seven and seventy- seven \" occur in that com-\nbination anywhere else. But if Mrs. Home was led to the\nphrase by any literary reminiscence, it was probably the well-\nknown text in the New Testament (Matt, xviii. 22), \"I say\nnot unto thee, until seven times : but, until seventy times seven,\"\nthat she had in mind rather than references in Light to Mr.\nStainton Moses' seven circles of seven spirits, though she has\nvery likely seen these references. This is again a case where\nthe source is unimportant, because all that is of interest is\nthe emphasis on the idea seven. M. Maxwell, I may\nremark, is a little rash in his assumption that all auto-\nmatists read Light, as indeed he is in some other assump-\n1\nThis is perhaps more clearly seen in Prof. Hyslop's article in the Journal of\nthe American Society of Psychical Research (March, 1911) than in the paragraph\nbased on it in our Proceedings, Vol. XXV., p. 298.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Payer. 391\ntions about their habits and opportunities. Probably Mrs.\nHolland and Mrs. Willett never see Light, and Mrs. Piper\nvery rarely, if at all. Mrs. and Miss Verrall no doubt\nlook into it occasionally, and Mrs. Home, I should imagine,\nreads it regularly. These estimates, I ought to say, are\nbased on my knowledge of the ladies, not on special\ninquiries. If, therefore, e.g. Mrs. Holland quotes from an\nEnglish poet a passage also at some time or other quoted\nin Light, it is much more likely that the source in her case\nis the poet's works than that it is Light. If, again, Mrs. Piper\ntalks about \" Pharaoh's daughter,\" it is much more likely that it\nis because she has in her mind the Bible story of Moses saved\nby Pharaoh's daughter than that she has a reminiscence of the\nwords as used in Light some years before (p. 120).\nBut I have said enough about quotations. They lead on\nnaturally to another characteristic of the scripts, with which\nindeed they are closely connected\u2014I mean the symbolic char-\nacter of the language used, much of which depends on mean-\nings being expressed by means of quotations and allusions.\nM. Maxwell objects strongly to this, but whether he thinks\nthe symbolism exists only in our imagination, or whether he\nthinks that automatic script in which symbolic language is\nused is too obscure to be worth studying, I am not quite\nsure. I think, however, that a little further examination\nwould convince him that the symbolism is really there if he\nhas any doubt about it. For instance, is there any possible\ndoubt that Mrs. Holland's script of March 14, 1906 (Vol. XXL,\np. 320) is symbolic? That is the script where she gives a\nstring of numbers which, when interpreted as letters of the\nalphabet expressed in their numerical order, gives the name,\nBoden Noel. These numbers are followed by the words, \" Not\nto be taken as they stand,\" and by a reference to a portion\nof a verse in Revelation, which when looked up is found to\nbe \" for it is the number of a man.\" In this case the sym-\nbolic script itself gives the clue to the symbolism, besides\ntelling us in the phrase, \" not to be taken as they stand,\"\nthat it is symbolic. Similarly in Mrs. Verrall's script of\nFebruary 18, 1907 (Vol. XXII. p. 82) occur the words,\n\" The white hill and les neiges d'antan Blanche de Lys or\nsome such name\u2014but it is all only symlobic [sic].\"\n\f392 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich [part\nInstances where the symbolism is unmistakable and where\nthe script itself says it is symbolic, or uses such expressions\nas \" so and so is a clue,\" implying that a clue is wanted to\nfind the meaning, might be multiplied indefinitely. There is\nno doubt that the symbolism is there and that the meaning\nof the scripts is constantly wrapped up in a way that prevents\nits being at once obvious, and though it would often be more\nconvenient to have the meaning stated more plainly and would\nprevent some ambiguities\u2014and ambiguities in the case of\ncross-correspondences may sometimes give a double chance\nwe must, if we wish to study the scripts at all, accept\nthem as they are. Of course, however, we must all admit\nthat great care should be exercised not to let our imagina-\ntions run away with us, and not to assume doubtful interpre-\ntations to be certain.\nThe question naturally arises\u2014why this symbolism and\nobscurity ? I think we shall have to wait till we know\nmore to answer fully, but some reasons may be suggested.\nPart of the obscurity may be due to dream-like sequences\nof associated ideas unregulated by a controlling intelligence\nlike the conversation of some chattering people who flow on\nfrom one thing to another till you do not know what they\nare talking about. This would account for the introduction of\nirrelevant ideas, and it is a possibility which the script itself\ntakes note of. For instance, a script of Mrs. Verrall's, on\nFeb. 15, 1910 (Proceedings, Vol. XXV., p. 214), cuts short\nsome rhyming verses with the words :\nno don't say obvious nonsense\u2014the rhyme hinders\u2014but you now\nhave the general sense. I can't think why you will not just put\ndown the words without making up bad verses to disguise from\nyourself what you are doing. Now write FOUNT no more than\nthat\u2014and off you go to Fountains Abbey.1\nBut we cannot thus explain conundrums which are evidently\ndeliberate, like the one about the name Roden Noel, referred\nto above. Here another explanation suggests itself, namely,\nthat obscurity may sometimes be necessary to prevent inhibition\nby the supraliminal self. The writing intelligence is writing,\non sufferance, as it were, the normal intelligence agreeing to\n!Cf. also Proe., Vol. XXII., pp. 191 and 228.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 393\nstand aside for the moment. But\u2014at any rate where there\nis no trance, and to some extent, probably, where there is\nthe normal intelligence is there in the background all the\ntime. Its attention may be arrested at any moment by what\nis being written, and if its interest is aroused it may interfere\neither by inhibiting or by directing the script. The intelligence\ndirecting the automatic writing may therefore find itself less\nobstructed if it expresses itself so that its meaning is not\nimmediately obvious. It says so itself e.g., Mrs. Holland,\nFeb. 23, 1905 (Vol. XXL, p. 247):\nNames. Names and proofs are the very things we must withold\n[sic] from you because your brain which you cannot or will not\nwill to a proper state of passivity\u2014will spin its own web round\nwhatever is presented to you\u2014For truth's sake we must be veiled\nand ambiguous. [Then comes what is evidently a punning allusion\nto the names of Gurney, Sidgwick, and Myers :] A gurnet among\nthe sedge which grew in the mires. [And the script goes on] We\nwant to withold [sic] riddles from you\u2014your usefulness would depart.\nNeither of the explanations suggested so far involves anything\nsupernormal. They would be equally applicable and equally\nneeded if the writing contained no supernormal element at all.\nFor though in the quotations I have given there is an\nassumption that a personality outside the automatist is\nconcerned, we cannot of course take it at its own valuation\nespecially as we have evidence in automatic states of what\nProf. William James calls a \" will to personate.\"\nBut now we come back to the evidence for knowledge super-\nnormally acquired\u2014ideas entering from outside the automatist,\nand not by the ordinary channels of sense. Here we have\na new source of obscurity and complexity, because, as we have\nevery reason to think, ideas conveyed telepathically are apt\nto come in a fragmentary and imperfect way, and both to be\nimperfectly apprehended, and to be dressed up by the percipient.\nExperiments in thought-transference help us here. For instance,\nwhen Mr. G. A. Smith tried telepathically to make the\nhypnotised P. see a picture on a blank card of a choir boy\ndressed in a surplice, P. said :\nEdge of card's going a dark colour. Somebody dressed up in\nwhite, eh\n1\n? Can see something all white; edge all black and like\n\f394 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\na figure in the middle. There's his hands up (making a gesture\nto show the attitude) like a ghost or something\u2014you couldn't\nmistake it for anything but a ghost. ... It might frighten any one.\n(Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 565. Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 552.)\nThe same thing may happen in the case of a split personality\nwith ideas from outside brought in normally through the senses.\nFor instance, Mr. Myers on another occasion told the same\nsubject P. while in hypnotic trance, the story of Robinson\nCrusoe finding the footprint and fearing savages\nAwakened and set before the glass of water [which was being\nused as a crystal], P. at once exclaimed, \" Why, there's Buffalo\nBill ! he's dressed in feathers, and skins round him, almost like a\nsavage. He's walking about in a waste place. ... I can see some-\nthing else coming from another part\u2014it's a blackie . . . look at them\nnow, how they're arguing, Buffalo Bill and his black man.\" 1\n{Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 461. Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 580.)\nIn this case it was not in the communication from Mr. Myers\nto P.'s hypnotic consciousness that the failure took place\u2014it\nwas rather between two phases of the subliminal consciousness,\nor else in the transmission of the picture to the supraliminal\nconsciousness. We can imagine how meaningless the occurrence\nof these visions would have seemed without the clue, though\nwith it\u2014with the knowledge of what it was intended the\npercipient should perceive\u2014the connexion with this of what\nhe did perceive is perfectly obvious.\nAnd this brings us to what may, I think, be an even more\nimportant cause of the complexity of the scripts if we suppose\nthat an outside intelligence is influencing them. That outside\nintelligence\u2014let us call it the communicator\u2014if it is actively\ntrying to convey a definite idea, may well have difficulty, if\nit works telepathically, in getting the intelligence directing the\nscript either to grasp the idea or to write down the words\nin which the communicator would naturally express it. The\ncommunicator may therefore be reduced to selecting such phrases\nand ideas already in the automatist's mind as will come nearest\nto what it wishes to say, with the further hampering condition\nthat they must be phrases and ideas which the intelligence\n1\nBuffalo Bill was the name of the hero in a show going on in England at that\ntime and representing life in the Wild West.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 395\ndirecting the writing can be induced to write down. Under\nconditions such as these we must suppose that the communi-\ncator will have constant difficulty in getting its message through\nat all, that when it succeeds, the success will often be very partial,\nand that an occasion on which it is at all adequately suc-\ncessful in getting the message expressed will be something of\na red-letter day with it.\nBut the reader will say I am going too fast and assuming\nall sorts of things about the intelligences concerned without\ndiscussing them. Let us go back then to the questions I\nraised earlier in this paper : (a) What light, if any, is thrown\nby the script on the nature of the intelligence directing the\nwriting ; (5) what is the mode in which supernormally acquired\ninformation reaches this intelligence ; and (c) what is the source\nof this information ? These are difficult questions, and can at\npresent only be answered incompletely. Nor, though I believe\nthe writers of the papers criticised by M. Maxwell to be in\nsubstantial agreement with me, do I wish in what I am about\nto say to be held to express the opinions of any one but\nmyself, nor even any final opinion of my own. The whole\nsubject is very -\ndifficult, evidence is accumulating, and further\nlight may be thrown on our problems at any moment. And,\nin fact, what we have all been trying to do in the papers\nconcerning automatic scripts, is to set before readers of the\nProceedings what material is available for answering these\nquestions without attempting to force any particular answer\nupon them.\nLet us begin with the question\u2014What light is thrown by\nthe scripts, and especially by the supernormal elements in\nthem, on the nature of the intelligence directing the script ?\nThe reader will be prepared from what I have already said\nto hear that in my view this intelligence, whether prompted\nor inspired from outside or not, is a phase\u2014a subliminal\nself\u2014of the automatist. Several reasons may be urged for\nthis view. One is that some scripts are almost provablv\npurely subliminal. I will give a hitherto unpublished instance\n\u2014a script of Mrs. Verrall's, written on Nov. 19, 1906. She\nwas trying an experiment with Mr. J. A. Hill (a member of\nthe Society known to her by correspondence only), he being\nin another place and she writing with attention directed to\n\f396 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nhim to see if anything connected with him would come. This\nis the script\nWiiberforce. The lamplight shines on the wet streets, and the\nturning is to the left\u2014the house is on the right hand side \u2014two\nwindows on the street.\nBut it seems a long time back, not the dress of to-day.\nAnd then Jamaica seems written\u2014and I think of a place with\nblack people. Apocryphal.\nThis had no significance for Mr. Hill, and remained\nunexplained for more than five years. A few months ago\nMrs. Verrall discovered its meaning. She had occasion to\nread a paper of mine on \" Phantasms of the Dead,\" including\nhaunted houses, published in Vol. III. of the Proceedings.\nOn pp. 137-141 of this paper is a story of a haunted house\nin Spanishtown, Jamaica, occupied by a Mr. Hill, who himself,\namong others, saw the ghost. When she came to this story\nshe had no recollection of having read it before, but was at\nonce reminded of the above script, and I think the corre-\nspondences are too close for any one to doubt the connexion.\n\" Wiiberforce \" is an approach to Emancipation of Slaves,\n\"half-emancipated negroes\" (p. 139) being referred to in\nthe story. \" House \" and \" street \" come in naturally, for the\nhaunting of the house is the point of the story, and the ghost\n\"sometimes appeared to come from the street\" (pp. 140-141).\n\" It seems a long time back, not the dress of to-day,\" corre-\nsponds with the statement that the haunting was traced back\nfrom 1848 to 180 6, and believed to have existed before, and\nthat Mr. Hill \" came to the conclusion that the ghost wore\nthe garb which was in use in the colony in the reign of\nGeorge the First.\" \" Jamaica \" is where the house was, and\n\" black people \" figure largely in the story as percipients.\nThe only inappropriate remark is that about lamplight shining\non the wet streets. The word \" apocryphal,\" Mrs. Verrall\nsuggests, may represent the opinion of the ghost story held\nby her subliminal self. Though Mrs. Verrall had no conscious\nrecollection of the story, she is certain that she read the\narticle containing it a long time ago\u2014probably in 1887, soon\nafter she became a member of the Society. She remembered\nsupraliminally the general conclusions arrived at in it, but\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 397\nhardly any of the particular stories. No doubt, however, some\nrecollection of the story in question was retained by her sub-\nliminal self and was brought out by association of ideas\u2014the\nname of Mr. Hill with whom Mrs. Verrall was experimenting,\nrecalling another Mr. Hill connected with Psychical Research.\nThe case seems to me a clear instance of purely subliminal\norigin, altogether uninfluenced from outside. But if some auto-\nmatic scripts are purely subliminal with no external agency at\nall, is it not gratuitous to suppose that in other cases which\nseem to have nothing to distinguish them from the first,\nexcept that part of the contents of the script appears to come\nfrom some other mind, the scribe is different ? Is it not\nlike supposing that it is a different \"I\" who writes when I\nwrite a letter out of my own head, and when some one\nelse suggests to me what to say ?\nAnother reason for believing the intelligence directing the\nwriting to be a subliminal self of the automatist is that there\nis in my view hardly any evidence for what I may call the\ngeneral construction or machinery of the scripts, e.g., the\nlanguage in which they are written, being beyond the possible\nrange of the automatist's own power. Mrs. Holland does not,\nfor instance, write Greek, nor Mrs. Piper Latin, and so forth.\nA third reason is that the style of the scripts of each auto-\nmatist is individual and differs from that of others. With a\nlittle practice one can generally tell from the script itself\nor at any rate form a very good guess\u2014which automatist is\nresponsible for it. This would not happen, I think, if it were\nnot the work of some phase of the automatist's subliminal self.\nIf it be granted that the intelligence directing the writing\nis a subliminal self of the automatist, it almost follows that\nthe answer to our second question is that the mode in which\nsupernormally acquired knowledge reaches that intelligence is\ntelepathic\u2014telepathy either from other embodied human minds or\nfrom minds not in the body. Unless indeed it be clairvoyant\nbut evidence for clairvoyance in the sense of the perception\notherwise than through the senses of things not in other\nminds, is at present almost non-existent. Telepathy merely\nmeans communication between mind and mind otherwise than\nthrough the senses, and we know of course very little about\nit. We do not, for instance, know whether when an idea\n\f398 Mrs. Henry SidgvAck. [part\nreaches B telepathically from A it is because A has actively\ntried to impress it on B, who receives it passively ; or\nwhether, on the other hand, it is B who actively fetches\nit out of the mind of the passive A ; or whether active\nco-operation is wanted on both sides ; or even whether tele-\npathy may come about without the active co-operation of\neither mind. Thought-transference experiments do not help\nus much in deciding any such question, because we do not\nknow whether the supraliminal efforts of which we are\ncognisant have or have not any effect on the phenomenon. It\nmay be a purely subliminal affair. This is one of the things\nwe must look for light on from the evidence which is accumu-\nlating, noting that if we find purposive intention in the idea\ntelepathically conveyed we have to assume an intelligent agent.\nWell then we come to the third question, and it is of\ncourse by far the most crucial and important of all\u2014What is\nthe source from which this information comes telepathically ?\nIn simple cross -correspondences like the \"sphere-spear\" case\nwe may suppose Mrs. Piper's and Mrs. Verrall's minds alone\nto be concerned. Telepathy between them would, so far as we\nknow, sufficiently account for what occurred, though it may not\nbe the true explanation. But when we come to complex cross-\ncorrespondences, simple telepathy will not serve \u2014 at least \/\nthink not. M. Maxwell thinks it will ; he thinks Mr. Pigou\nhas clearly shown that even cross-correspondences of the \" mosaic\ntype \"\n\u2014the complex kind, that is\u2014may be due to fragmentary\ntelepathic thought-transference (p. 139). He does not tell us\nwhether he has read Mr. Balfour's reply to Mr. Pigou (Proc.\nVol. XXV., pp. 38-56), and, if so, how he would meet it. To\nme the reply seems conclusive, and until it is met we must,\nin my opinion, assume that a purposive element in the dis-\ntribution among different automatists of the fragments of a\ncomplex cross-correspondence does show the operation of intelli-\ngence, and cannot be due to the mere accidental fragmentari-\nness of telepathically conveyed ideas. A purposive element\nmay be shown either by the selection and distribution of the\nfragments, or by statements in the script showing that there\nis intention, or by both. I do not propose to go over all\nthis much discussed ground aoain. What we have each to\ndecide for ourselves is whether in the cross-correspondences of\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 399\nwhich we know, there is evidence of purposive design in the\ndistribution of the parts. If we think there is, the next point\nis to discover whose design it is. Is it that of the subliminal\nself of one or more of the automatists ? This hypothesis\nshould be strained to the utmost, but if any one will honestly\ntry to apply it in all cases, he will, I think, find it very\ndifficult.\nBut if it is not the subliminal selves of the automatists that\nwork the cross-correspondences, what hypothesis remains except\nthat they are the work of external intelligences ? This is a\nvery far-reaching hypothesis, and one which requires much\nevidence very carefully scrutinised to establish it.\n1\nFurther,\nif we have to do with external intelligences, we must ask\nwhat external intelligences they are. Are they, what they\nclaim to be, our former fellow-workers in psychical research,\nGurney, Sidgwick, and Myers ? It must be admitted in favour\nof this that the idea of proving external agency by giving\nevidence of purposive design is an ingenious one, and one\nwhich it is natural to suppose might occur to these former\ninvestigators, anxious to prove survival, and well aware of\nthe difficulties of doing so, and of the need of new methods.\nMoreover, the claim of identity is to some considerable extent\nsupported\u2014even after full allowance for the share in the\nscript of the automatist's own mind\u2014by the characteristic\nnature of some communications, and by the greater apparent\nappropriateness to the supposed communicators than to the\nautomatists of certain ideas and arrangements of ideas e.g. in\nthe answers to the Lethe question. But more evidence is\nwanted before we form a definite conclusion.\nI hope, therefore, that readers of the Proceedings are not\ngetting tired of cross-correspondences. Regarded merely as\nproof of telepathy, their importance can hardly be overrated,\nand much more may ultimately be proved by them. As, by\ndegrees, more publishable evidence comes in, or fresh light\nis thrown on what we have already, we shall have to trouble\n1 1 should like here to refer the reader who is not already familiar with it\nto the very interesting final section of Miss Johnson's \"Third Report on Mrs.\nHolland's Script\" (Proceedings, Vol. XXV., pp. 282-293).

We therefore greatly desire from\nreaders of the Proceedings co-operation and criticism, in con-\nsidering both evidence already published and any new\nevidence that may be brought forward.\nIn the meanwhile I should like to conclude by saying that\nthough we are not yet justified in feeling any certainty, I\nmyself think the evidence is pointing towards the conclusion\nthat our former fellow-workers are still working with us.\n\flxvk.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 401\nAPPENDIX L\nBy Mrs. A. W. VERRALL.\nI do not propose to reply seriatim or in detail to the criticism\nin Proceedings, Part LXV., by M. Joseph Maxwell on my\nreport upon my own automatic writing (Vol. XX.). To\ndo so could serve no useful purpose. It would weary the\nreader to be taken again over twice-trod ground, and since\nin M. Maxwell's opinion no medium should estimate the value\nof her own phenomena, he can take no interest in any con-\nclusions of mine. But some points in his article call for more\ndetailed treatment than they could receive in Mrs. Sidgwick's\nforegoing paper. Where M. Maxwell's inferences from the\nrecorded facts differ from mine, readers must judge for\nthemselves whether either of us, and if so which, is right.\nM. Maxwell has reminded them that I am not an impartial\njudge, and for my part I would refer them for the facts to my\nfirst-hand and full report, and not to his abbreviated summary.\nI confine my observations to the two first and the two last\nof the incidents commented on by M. Maxwell. There is no\nspecial reason for this selection ; in every case M. Maxwell's\nmethods will be found to be the same.\nI.\nThe first case with which he deals (p. 59) is the supposed\ncorrespondence between Mrs. Piper's script and mine in\nJanuary, 1902, the \"sphere-spear\" incident. To what Mrs.\nSidgwick has said above (p. 382) I add the following observa-\ntions :\n(1) I myself pointed out (Vol. XX., p. 215) that the\n\f\u00ab\n402 Mrs. A. W. Verratt. [part\ncommentators were not agreed as to what precise implement\nis described as a \" flying weapon \" or \" flying iron \"\n(2) My contemporary interpretation\u2014or misinterpretation, if\nM. Maxwell prefers\u2014was based upon the view that (a) the\nwords of the script indicated that in the phrase volatile ferrum\n\u2014a Virgilian phrase ferrum had been substituted for tclum ;\nthat (b) volatile telum, in a familiar passage of Lucretius (I.\n970), is translated by Munro, \"winged javelin\";\n1\n(c) that\nin Virgil, JEn., VIII., 694 (a passage referred to but not\ncpioted by M. Maxwell), the volatile ferrum, the \" flying iron,\"\nwhatever it may be\u2014and of the commentators one may say\nquot homines tot sententiae\u2014is not a sagitta ;\n(3) I did not claim that \"Panopticon\" meant \"to, vue\" or\nthat aui'Seyiuu was an extant Greek word ;\n(4) It is true, and I drew attention to the fact, that there\nwas for me an anterior subliminal association between the\nwords \" Panopticon \" and \" sphere,\" but it is not true that\nthe script in which these words first occurred (March 14,\n1901, quoted in Vol. XX., p. 342) also contained three crosses;\nthe first piece of script written on that day terminated with\nthe letter x repeated three times. This letter has doubtless\nbeen mistaken by M. Maxwell for a cross, but there is no\nconfusion possible between the small x in the original script\nand the transverse or St. Andrew's Cross. As to the words\n\" Panopticon sphaerae,\" to my earlier statements I add the\nfollowing\n(a) The word \" Panopticon \" was used by Bentham to\ndescribe the circular Penitentiary which he was anxious\nto induce the Government of his day to adopt.'2\nThis\nuse had probably been known to me, but, if so, I had\nforgotten it till, after the issue of my report, I was\nreminded of it by a correspondent. The shape of\nEentham's Panopticon may account for the original con-\njunction in the script of Panopticon and sphere, and\nsubliminal memory may have conduced to its recurrence\n1\nMy note of Feb. 7, 1902, refers to the two passages, Virg., JSn., VIII.,\n694, and Lucretius, I., 970, and Munro's translation of the Lucretian volatile\nby the picturesque \"winged\" is reflected in my use of the phrase \"the\nwinged iron,\" in the second paragraph on p. 215 of Vol. XX.\n2\nSee Prof. Sidgwick's Miscellaneous Essays, p. 145.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 403\non January 31, 1902, but does not account for its\ncombination on that occasion with other phrases or\nsymbols (volatile ferricm and Rector's Greek cross) which\nappear to make a cross-correspondence with Mrs. Piper's\ntrance-writing\n(b) I wrote in 1906 (Vol. XX., p. 216) that \"it is\nperhaps worth noting that the suggestion of a sphere as\nthe object to be shown came not from Dr. Hodgson, but\nfrom the '\ncontrol.' \" I now add, what I then intentionally\nomitted, that the \" control,\" or rather the \" communicator,\"\nfor whom Eector was ostensibly acting as amanuensis,\nwas MyerSp, and that the letter which I was holding in\nmy left hand (Vol. XX., p. 342)\u2014one of several\nexperiments tried in the early days of the script\u2014when,\non March 14, 1901, the script contained the words,\n\" Panopticon sphaerae,\" was a letter from Mr. Myers.\nThe anterior emergence in my script of the phrase thus\nseems to me to strengthen rather than to weaken the\nevidence for supernormal connexion between the later\nscript and Mrs. Piper's trance-writing in January, 1902.\n(5) I am disposed to assent to M. Maxwell's ingenious\nsuggestion that phonetic association between eSlSws and Dido\nis, at least in part, responsible for the actual phrasing of my\nscript. The point is one of psychological interest, in so far\nas it throws light on the mental process of an automatist,\nand may be compared with Mr. Piddington's note on \" a knot\nof blue ribbon \" as likely to be associated in the automatist's\nmind with \"John\" (Vol. XXII., p. 182). But to explain\nthe mental process of one automatist does not account for\ncoincidences in the ideas expressed, in their several ways, by\nboth.\n(6) So again M. Maxwell's objection that my script is in\nLatin and that RectorP knows no Latin goes to prove, if proof\nwere wanted, that EectorP is not the writer of my script, but\ndoes not help to decide whether the connexion between the\nideas represented in Mrs. Piper's script and mine, and\nexpressed in languages familiar respectively to each of us, is\ncloser than would be produced by accident.\n\f404 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nII.\nIn the next case discussed, M. Maxwell (p. 60) thinks that\nmy interpretations are coloured by my conviction of the super-\nnormal character and value of my script, which leads me into\nmistranslations, unconscious emphasis of points of agreement\nwith Mrs. Forbes, and omission of points of difference. In\nparticular, he complains that the words, \" a statement was\nmade in my script about fir trees planted in a garden,\" are\nnot a fair representation of the actual words of the script,\n\" conifera arbos in horto iam insita,\" because conifera arbos\ndoes not mean fir-trees (sapins), but a coniferous or cone-\nbearing tree (un arbre conifere). That is so, but neither were\nthe trees in Mrs. Forbes's garden fir-trees, \" des sapins,\" if that\nword is used in a specific sense. I do not know, nor does\nMrs. Forbes, what the exact species is of the trees grown\nfrom seed sent to her by her son. They are, however,\nconifers. M. Maxwell writes as though \" des sapins \" {fir-\ntrees) were a specific and not a generic botanical term. What\nis the case with sapin I cannot say, but in English the\nexpression \" fir-trees \" certainly covers several species (Scotch,\nSpruce, Silver, etc.). So also does the term \" conifer,\" and\nno English reader would, I think, feel M. Maxwell's objection\nto the use of the word \" fir-tree \" to translate conifera arbos.\nNor does the fact that there are four or five of them in\nMrs. Forbes's garden make the use in the script of the\nsingular conifera arbos an inaccuracy. The English equivalents\nfor conifera arbos are more than one ; the words may mean\n\" a fir-tree,\" \" the fir-tree,\" or \" fir-trees \" ; what they do not\nmean is \" one fir-tree,\" How, for instance, would M. Maxwell\ntranslate the singular nouns in Pliny's list of mountain-loving\ntrees :\n1\nmonies cmant cedrus, larix, tccla, et caetcrae, et quibus\nrcsina gignitur ? In English we should write indifferently :\n\" cedars, larches, etc., are mountain-lovers,\" or \" the cedar, etc.,\nis a mountain-lover.\"\nM. Maxwell may be right in interpreting as a cross what I\n1\nPliny, N.H., XVI., 30. Singular and plural are combined in Pliny's lists\nwith complete indifference :\n\" Non temere in montibus visae sunt prunus,\nPunicae, oleastri, iuglans, morus, sambuei.\"\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Br. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 405\ntook for a sword, and, if he is, the allusion to Talbot Forbes\nis less definite than I had supposed. There are, however,\nother representations in the script of a similar object, which\non the first occasion of its appearance (Aug. 6, 1901) is\nlabelled a \" sword.\" The modern sword is no doubt not cross-\nhilted, but the script may here as elsewhere prefer symbolism\nto realism.1\nM. Maxwell points out that the greater part of my script\nof August 28, 1901, is inapplicable to Talbot Forbes, and sees\nno \" continuity de conscience \" between my script and that of\nMrs. Forbes. I have never claimed for any individual portion\nof my script that it proceeded as a whole from some single\nsource, and was uninfluenced by my own subliminal or supra-\nliminal knowledge or association of ideas. In this case I\ncalled the attention of the reader to a certain reciprocity in\nthe scripts produced by Mrs. Forbes and myself on August 28,\n1901 ; the contents of her script, considered in connexion\nwith the conifers and the suspended bugle of mine, suggest\nthat some other than accidental connexion exists between\nour automatic phenomena. This question cannot be decided\nby the examination of one in the long series of similar\nincidents related in my paper. Readers who wish to form a\njudgement on the point must, I fear, read the whole sixty-eight\nincidents (Vol. XX., Chap. XL).\nIt is true, as M. Maxwell points out, that my translation\nof \" omina sibimet ostendit \" does not give the reflexive sense\nof sibimet ; a closer rendering would be \" gives a portent\nto itself.\" In neither case do the words appear applicable\nto the facts. I placed no reliance on them, and did not\nmention them in my comment on the incident. I draw atten-\ntion to this point because from M. Maxwell's correction, followed\nas it is by an encomium on my Latin scholarship and a complaint\nX\nI do not understand what M. Maxwell means by saying that \"the word\nJir-tree is unmistakably associated with a cross in the scripts of Aug. 25\nand 26, 1902.\" The actual word fir-tree occurs in neither script. On Aug. 25,\n1902 (quoted in Vol. XX., p. 355), occur the words \"Forest and firs\u2014and a\nmoss grown tree trunk\" apparently \"in a German speaking country,\" and\nthis script is signed with an attempt at the word Cross and a drawing of a\nLatiu cross. The script of Aug. 26, 1902 (which is briefly referred to, p. 77,\nbut not quoted) contains the word Cross, but has nothing in it suggesting a\ntree of any kind.\n\f406 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nof my errors in translation, the reader would be led to believe\nthat this mistake of mine was an illustration of his point\nand that my loose translation helped to establish my \" case.\"\nI pass from the first two cases selected for comment by\nM. Maxwell to the last two, the \"Daily Mail ghost\" and\n\" Marmontel.\"\nIII.\nThe \"Daily Mail Ghost\" is treated by M. Maxwell (p. 71)\nwith more respect than usual, perhaps because he has himself\nobserved cases of the same type. He does not define the\ntype otherwise than by comparison with another case in my\nreport (Vol. XX., p. 324). If, however,\u2014a point on which judge-\nment may be reserved \u2014reliance is to be placed on the state-\nment of the writer in the Daily Mail (Vol. XX., p. 329), the\ncases differ in one important respect, namely, that one can\nand the other cannot be accounted for by telepathy with the\nnewspaper writer. The Daily Mail writer and his friend, when\nthey planned their investigation in the haunted room, did not\nanticipate that the marks, which they hoped to obtain upon\ntheir scattered chalk, would represent the footprints of a bird,\nand the bird is one of the identifying points in the script.\nIn the other case, as the journalist's account was apparently\nimaginary, there is no external subsequent event corresponding\nwith anything in the script.\nIt is true, and was stated by me, that calx is ambiguous,\nmeaning as it does both \" heel \" and \" chalk.\" But its meaning-\nseems to be defined by the context, for \" chalk \" is more\nsuited than is a \" heel \" to \" stick to the feet.\" M. Maxwell\nfurther objects that the bird of the script is a \" caricature.\"\nI fail to see why this is an objection. However ill drawn,\nit is a bird.\nIV.\nThe last case considered by M. Maxwell\u2014the Marmontel\nincident\u2014specially illustrates in his view the method employed\nin my report, and to the question of the method used here\nas well as in other recent publications of the Society he attaches,\nso he tells us (p. 71), great importance. Of no less import-\nance is the method employed by our critics, and M. Maxwell's\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 407\nexamination of this incident may serve as an illustration of\nthe method which he employs. On that method I offer the\nfollowing comments\n(1) M. Maxwell counts the details in the script and classifies\nthem as five correct, eight incorrect, and one doubtful. He\nmakes no distinction among these details, treating them as\nthough they were all equally important. It is true that he\nsubsequently applies to two of those classed as correct the\nepithet \"banal.\" But if reading in bed (\"correct\") is banal.\nis not the substitution of two chairs for a sofa (\"incorrect\")\nalso banal ? Triviality or non-triviality is a matter of opinion,\nbut in an analysis by enumeration, which suggests that the\nitems are of equal importance, the question of triviality, if\nintroduced at all, should be indiscriminately applied through-\nout.\n(2) A classified list of this sort presented to the reader\nshould be complete. M. Maxwell omits an item which, had\nit not been omitted, must have been classed as \" correct,\"\nnamely that the reading was done with \" only a candle's light.\"\nThis detail, though trivial, appears to me distinctive : it is\nnot common nowadays\u2014not even, I should think, in La Ville\nLumibre\u2014to read by candle light.\n(3) The precision of coincidence between the words of the\nscript and the passage which Mr. Marsh read on February 21,\nis not brought out in M. Maxwell's abbreviated version of\nthe facts. He says that the volume which Mr. Marsh was\nreading contained the story of the discovery of a panel, etc.\n1\nAs a fact, Mr. Marsh read \" with only a candle's light \" the\nvery chapter in which Marmontel tells that story among other\nrecollections of Passy.\nThe inferences to be drawn from the considerations put for-\nward by me in this case, as in others, are, as I have said,\nmatters of opinion, and I shall not discuss them here. But I\nhope that if the reader has any desire to know what my infer-\nences are, he will take them first-hand from me and not\nsecond-hand from M. Maxwell. In his necessarily condensed\naccount M. Maxwell has left out most, if not all, of my\nfrequent remarks directing the reader's attention to the obscu-\nrities, the ambiguities, and the errors which are present even\nl \"Dans le volume il etait question de la decouverte, etc.\"\n2D\n\f408 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nin the best cases. Eeaders of M. Maxwell's description of\nmy report as \" not an analysis but a piece of special pleading\n\"\n(p. 58) will be surprised to find for how large a part of the\nscript I make no claim to the possession of evidential value.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 409\nAPPENDIX II.\nBy ALICE JOHNSON.\nReference has been made above by Mrs. Sidgwick to the con-\nfusion inherent in Dr. Maxwell's discussion between matters\nwhich in the nature of the case must depend on the auto-\nmatist's good faith and those for which objective evidence is\nobtainable.\nWhether or not the writing is produced without the volun-\ntary and conscious participation of the supraliminal self, and\nwhether or not the facts stated in it are consciously known\nto the writer, are matters belonging to the former category.\nIn regard to them we might conceivably find evidence of\nfraud through statements made at different times being incon-\nsistent with one another ; but we could never find evidence of\ngenuineness ; that must always be a matter' of opinion based\non general considerations.\nNow, Mrs. Holland\u2014to whom in particular I refer, because\nmost of my own reports have been on her script\u2014has in a\ngreat many instances told me that facts mentioned or alluded\nto in her script were known to her ;\nwhile, during a long\nand intimate acquaintance with her and her script, I have\nnever found any inconsistencies in the information she\nhas given Tire about it. For these reasons, I personally\naccept whatever she tells me as to her conscious knowledge\nor recollection, e.g. her statement that she had not inter-\npreted the script in which she gave the name \" Eoden Noel\nby means of numbers and the reference to a text. Of this\nstatement Dr. Maxwell remarks (p. 75): \" Cela est bien in-\nvraisemblable.\" The insinuation seems to me uncalled for.\nMrs. Holland, even before I knew her, had been well aware\n\f410 Alice Johnson. [part\nof the large subjective element in her script, and she knew\nthat the question in this case was of psychological interest\nonly. She had answered many similar questions, sometimes\nin the affirmative and sometimes in the negative.\nThe incident was given in my first Eeport as an illustra-\ntion of her subliminal ingenuity ; for it is very important\nthat we should know the extent to which subliminal ingenuity\nmay go and how far it may account for the complexities of\nthe cross-correspondences and various features in them that\nsuggest a supernormal origin. Dr. Maxwell thinks that the\npublication of such incidents suggests that we are not familiar\nwith recent researches into the psychology of the subconscious.\nOur view is that individual instances may often be more\ninstructive than general dissertations on this subject\u2014which\ndissertations ai-e not infrequently based on the study of\nmorbid cases only.\nIt is curious to see how Dr. Maxwell's preconceptions lead\nhim to distort the simplest incidents ; an instance is to be\nfound on p. 136 of his paper:\nMrs. Holland's script had given a description of Mr. Eoden\nNoel's personal appearance which agreed with a portrait pre-\nfixed to his Collected Poems and also with my own recollection\nof the one occasion on which I saw him. Miss Noel later\nsent me various notes in confirmation of small details in\nMrs. Holland's script, but added that she thought the\ndescription of him not very accurate, for \" his hair was very\nthin latterly.\" I printed her notes, partly to confirm and\npartly to correct my earlier statements, though, as I implied,\nthere was nothing incompatible in my recollection of his hair\nbeing decidedly thick when I saw him some years before his\ndeath and Miss Noel's statement that it was very thin latterly.\nDr. Maxwell's \" unconscious tendency to adapt the facts to\n[his] opinions \" (if I may apply to him a phrase which he\nuses of us) suggests to him that this only shows that I had\nmore faith in my recollection than in Miss Noel's\nMore serious misrepresentations arise from his habit of\ngeneralising from single instances. Thus, on p. 82, he remarks:\n\" Mines. Verrall et Holland etaient en correspondance.\" The\nreader would infer from this that at least several letters had\npassed between them, from which they might have learnt of\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 411\neach other's affairs. As a matter of fact, each had written\none letter and one only to the other, and these letters are\ngiven in my first Keport on Mrs. Holland (Vol. XXL, pp.\n328-329). There is nothing changed or omitted except that\nin Mrs. Holland's letter (which is before me as I write)\nsome passages are left out which refer merely to the exchange\nof rings between the automatists, for the purpose of the\nexperiments described.\nDr. Maxwell disposes of the \"Ave Roma immortalis \" cross-\ncorrespondence by asserting (p. 79) that it is a mere coincidence,\nsince Mr. Myers died at Rome. This is one of several cases\nin which\u2014no doubt unintentionally\u2014he writes as if he had\ndiscovered some flaw in the evidence which we had not\nnoticed. I had, however, pointed out in my Keport that the\nmention of Eome in Mrs. Holland's script probably led her\nto refer to the (well-known) fact of Mr. Myers's death there.\nBut this had happened more than five years before, and\ntherefore seems hardly sufficient to account for allusions to\nRome occurring in both Mrs. Holland's and Mrs. Verrall's\nscripts within five days of one another.\nDr. Maxwell adds :\n\" on trouve de nombreuses references\na Rome dans les textes publies de Mine. Holland.\" I do not\nknow what he means by \"nombreuses\"; but as a fact, the\nwords \" Roma,\" \" Rome,\" or \" Roman \" occur in only 6 out of\n218 scripts by Mrs. Holland, namely, all those produced by\nher from July 1903 to the end of 1908, and only 3 of\nthese 6 scripts have been published up to the present time.\nThere are further in the 218 scripts 7 references to places\nin Rome, of which only one (relating to the Janiculum) has\nbeen published.\nDr. Maxwell minimises the significance of the cross-corre-\nspondence by ignoring the historical circumstances and intention\nof the picture to which Mrs. Verrall's scripts were supposed\nby us to refer. Since he wrote his criticism, I have discovered\ncertain clues to a number of hitherto obscure points in the\nscripts, which show that almost every phrase has a definite\nand coherent meaning, adding to the force of the whole case.\nTo explain this would take too long here, but I propose to\ninclude an account of it in a paper which I am preparing\nfor publication.\n\f412 Alice Johnson. [part\nAnother statement, correct in itself, but misleading in its\ncontext, is the following : In trying to explain away the cross-\ncorrespondence \"Not in the Electra,\" Dr. Maxwell says (p. 85):\n\" Les textes de Mine. Verrall contiennent souvent des cita-\ntions grecques.\" They do, but this was not known to Mrs.\nHolland, as none of them had then been published. Mrs.\nHolland had at that time seen copies of only eight of\nMrs. Verrail's scripts ; these were all in English, except one,\nwhich contained two sentences of Latin. The first time that\nany Greek had appeared in any of the scripts written by\nMrs. Verrall for purposes of experiment with Mrs. Holland\nwas on Feb. 28, 1906; and it was on that day that Mrs.\nHolland's script contained (among other evidential statements)\nthe phrase, \" No, not in the Electra\u2014M. will know better,\"\nwhich was appropriate to the Greek in Mrs. Verrall's script.\nAgain, Dr. Maxwell says (p. 77): \"Pourquoi insister con-\nstamment sur l'impossibilite ou est le sensitif d'avoir normale-\nment connaissance des faits indiques par lui . . . comme dans\nla correspondance Eoden Noel ?\n\" My statement on this case\nis {Proc. Vol. XXL, p. 820): \"It will be seen that in neither\nof the scripts does a single statement occur that is lyroixibly\nunknown to the writers,\" and it will be seen that this is just\nthe opposite of what Dr. Maxwell attributes to me.\nThe possibility of Mrs. Holland's having seen any published\nbook is fully admitted in my reports, but it is surprising to see\nwhat evidence Dr. Maxwell thinks conclusive on this question.\nEvidence of her having read any given book may be fur-\nnished by finding coincidences between her scripts and the\nbook, in the same way that evidence for telepathy between her\nand Mrs. Verrall is furnished by coincidences between their\nscripts. But in both cases, of course, the coincidences must be\na good deal beyond what can be attributed to chance before\nany deduction can be drawn from them.\nThe following are two examples of Dr. Maxwell's arguments :\n(1) He tries to prove that Mrs. Holland had read an article by\nme on \"Coincidences\" in the Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 158 ct\nseq. This article (I regret to say) extends to the length of\n173 pp. It contains more than 300 names of persons (not\nincluding persons who are designated by initials only) and a\ngood many of these names occur more than once. Dr. Maxwell\n\flxvil] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 413\ndoes not find that a single one of these names appears in Mrs.\nHolland's script ; but he finds two on one page, Brett and\nShuttleworth, which, put together, have, I admit, a strong resem-\nblance to one name, Brittle-worth, in Mrs. Holland's script. He\nalso observes that Mrs. Holland particularly noticed the name\nDr. Hermann Lorberg, Professor of Physics, in a newspaper (seen\nby her on March 8, 1906), whereas my paper (published in\n1899) contains the name G. Lorberg, cutler. On the strength\nof these coincidences, Dr. Maxwell remarks (p. 76): \"Mme.\nHolland, dans la mesure ou les preuves humaines out quelque\nvaleur, a certainement parcouru [Particle] de Mile. Johnson . . .\nou en a hi des comptes-rendus et l'a oublie.\" (To the best\nof my belief, no comptes-rendus of this article have ever been\npublished.) He adds later another coincidence. In the same\narticle, the letter K is used, in a mathematical diagram, to\ndenote the greatest deviation from the average in a long\nseries. Mrs. Holland also uses the letter K in her script,\nfollowed by a number and a Christian name\n(2) For evidence that Mrs. Holland had read a certain article\nin Light: Her script of Feb. 6, 1906, contained these words:\n\"This scribe . . . this scribe\u2014Medium is not the best word in\nthis connection.\" In Light of Oct. 17, 1896, there is an\narticle on \" Automatic Writing,\" by a writer signing himself\nScriba. This article criticises the S.P.E. use of the word\n\"automatic,\" and proposes instead the word \" allomatic.\" The\nword \" medium \" does not occur at all in the article. Mrs.\nHolland, on the other hand, uses the words \" scribe \" and\n\" medium,\" and does not use either of the words \" automatic\nor \" allomatic.\" Now the latter is a very unusual word ; it\nis one not likely to be used by persons of education, and in\nall probability this is its sole appearance in print. If, there-\nfore, it had occurred in Mrs. Holland's script, the fact might\nwell be held to point to her having read Light. As things\nare, the script seems to point rather to her having, in common\nwith most English people, read the Bible, in which the word\nscribe occurs epiite often.\nThe whole point of the incident, however, which Dr. Maxwell\nseems to have overlooked, lies in the fact that Mrs. Holland\nused a common word in a very uncommon sense, within less\nthan a month of Mr. Piddington's having, unknown to her,\n\f414 Alice Johnson. [part\nused it in a similar very uncommon sense, and dwelt on the\ndesirability of our adopting that sense of it in our reports.\nSimilarly, as mentioned above, in a script referring to Dr.\nHodgson Mrs. Holland used \"K 57\" followed by the Christian\nname of an intimate friend of his, which emphasised the con-\nnection with him ; and it was found that he had used K\nfollowed by numerals, apparently as reference marks to his\nprivate papers (see Proc. Vol. XXI., p. 307).\nIt seems to me that in both these cases Mrs. Holland's scripts\ncoincide far more closely with the events with which I con-\nnected them than with the sources to which Dr. Maxwell\nattributes them.\nIn some other cases, I venture to think that Dr. Maxwell is\nnot quite familiar enough with English words and traditions to\nappreciate the point of the cross-correspondences. Thus in his\nanalysis (p. 80) of \" Eheu fugaces,\" there are several misappre-\nhensions. He demurs to my saying that Mrs. Verrall's script\nrepeated several times the idea of flight. But the English\nword flight includes all the senses in which I used it. It\nmeans running away, or fleeing, and also the Hying of birds,\netc., or any swift motion ; and it is also applied to the flight, or\nswift passage, of time. It is in fact equivalent to the Latin\nfuga (adj. fugax), which covers the same meanings. In saying\nthat one passage in the script \" seems an imaginary description\nof an elopement,\" I was referring to elopements to Gretna\nGreen, as they used to occur in the days when marriages could\nbe more easily effected in Scotland than in England, as described,\ne.g., in the entertaining \" Adventure of the liunaway Couple \" in\nE. L. Stevenson's St. Ives :\n\" I was at the same time approaching\na place of some fame in Britain\u2014Gretna Green. Over those\nsame leagues of road . . . how many pairs of lovers had gone\nbowling northwards to the music of sixteen scampering horse-\nshoes ;\nand how many irate persons, parents, uncles, guardians,\nevicted rivals, had come tearing after.\"\nWhether the episode of the script is an elopement or not,\nit is a flight in one sense of the word, i.e. a rapid motion. And\nthe phrase \" Eheu fugaces \" (with which, of course, I assumed\nMrs. Holland to be familiar), refers to another kind of flight\nthe rapid motion of time.\n\fLxvu.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper. 415\nAPPENDIX III.\nBy J. G. PIDDINGTON.\nMrs. Sidgwick's reply in general terms to M. Maxwell is so\nconclusive that I feel it would be a work of supererogation\nwere I to attempt a detailed answer to most or even to\nmany of the criticisms that he has directed against me. I\nshall, therefore, refer to only one case which seems to me a\ntypical sample of M. Maxwell's method of dealing with our\npresentment of the evidence.\nIn my second and third papers on the Horace Ode Question\n(Proc. Vol. XXIV., pp. 150-169, and Vol. XXVI., pp. 174-220)\nI took the words \" glebis adscripta \" and \" ascripta glebae \" in\nMrs. Verrall's scripts of March 12 and April 27, 1901, to\nrepresent the word eirupovpos, and to involve a reference to a\npassage in the Odyssey (XL 489-491) where alone this word\noccurs.\nM. Maxwell (Vol. XXVI., pp. 114-115) thinks we ought not\nto accept adscriptus glebae as what he once calls a \" translation\n\"\nand once a \" paraphrase \" of \u20ac7rdpovpo<;. He says :\n[Le mot grec eVa'povpos] est place dans la bouche dAchille,\nqui aimerait mieux etre paysan travaillant pour un modique\nsalaire chez un homme pauvre, que de regner sur les ombres. Or\nle commentateur applique une phrase latine employee pour definir\nun etat social du moyen age, a un etat social anterieur de vingt-\ncinq siecles, dans lequel le serf inscrit a la glebe n'existait pas,\nau moins a ma connaissance.

[part\ncompatible avec le salaire dont parle Achille. Si je ne me trompe,\nle commentateur dont Mme Verrall accepte la paraphrase commet\nune erreur juridique et etymologique. M. Myers n'aurait pas\ncom mis cette derniere, car il connaissait bien la langue grecque.\nNow that sounds very learned : but as a criticism of our\ninterpretation of \" ascripta glebae \" in Mrs. Verrall's scrip't it\nis entirely beside the mark. So far as that interpretation is\nconcerned, it is quite immaterial whether \" adscriptus glebae\nis or is not a correct rendering or paraphrase of eirapovpos.\nFrom our point of view the only thing to be considered is\nthis : \u2014Is adscript m glebae a rendering of eirapovpo? so familiar\nto English scholars that an autoniatist like Mrs. Verrall (who\nis an English classical scholar) might light on it in the process\nof groping after the passage in the Eleventh Book of the\nOdyssey ?\nThat this rendering is extremely likely to be so familiar is\nhardly open to question. In England 19 Greek scholars out\nof 20, perhaps 99 out of 100, use the Greck-Englisli Lexicon\nof Liddell and Scott. This Lexicon (which Mrs. Verrall uses)\ns.v. e7rdpoupo? has the following :\nen-dpovpos, ov, (apovpa) attached to the soil as a serf, ascriptus\nglebae\nand then quotes Odyssey, XL 489. It does not give the alter-\nnative meaning \" above ground,\" but \" attached to the soil \" only.\nNext, Dr. Merry, whose annotated edition of the Odyssey is\nlargely used in England, and has been used by Mrs. Verrall,\nsays :\n\" eirdpovpog, lit. '\non the soil,' used of a serf, who is\nadscriptus glebae.\"\nLastly, Butcher and Lang, whose prose-translation of the\nOdyssey is the most popular one in England, while themselves\npreferring the rendering \" on ground,\" append the following\nfootnote to their rendering of Od. XL 489-491 :\niirdpovpos seems to mean 'upon the earth,' ' above ground,' as\nopposed to the dead who are below, rather than '\nbound to the\nsoil,' in which sense most commentators take it.\n1\nIn view of these facts I maintain that our interpretation\nof \" ascripta glebae \" as a reference to eirapovpos and its context\n1\nThe italics are mine.\n\flxvii.] A Reply to Dr. Joseph Maxwell's Paper.\nis both legitimate and probable ; and I cannot help suspecting\nthat M. Maxwell would never have demurred to it had I\nexpressed the opinion in my paper that the appearance of\n\" ascripta glebae \" in Mrs. Verrall's script \" sexplique par une\nassociation onirique.\" I suspect, too, that M. Maxwell would\nfind \" great support in that comfortable word Mesopotamia\"\nBut M. Maxwell is not content to expose the \" erreur juri-\ndique et etymologique \" of those who accept adscriptus glebae\nas a paraphrase of eirdpovpo?, but goes further still and expresses\nthe opinion that Frederic Myers was too good a Greek scholar\nto have made the same mistake. It is clear that M. Maxwell\nin expressing this opinion assumes that I have treated, or at\nleast that I regard, the occurrence of \" ascripta glebae \" in Mrs.\nVerrall's script as a case of syllabic inspiration on the part of\nFrederic Myers. How he acquired this erroneous notion I do\nnot know, for nothing I have written on the subject affords\nany warrant for it. My own conception of the phenomenon\nwas, and is, that the surviving personality of Myers was think-\ning of the passage in the Odyssey in which the word t-n-upovpos\noccurs, and seeking to impress the idea contained in it on\nMrs. Yerrall's mind by hook or by crook. But I did not, and\ndo not, suggest that Myers was responsible for the actual phrase\n\" ascripta glebae.\" He may have been, for all I know, but all\nthat I have assumed is that behind the script was Myers\nthinking of the Odyssey passage and endeavouring to transmit\na reference to it in some way or other. The form in which\nthe script actually gave expression to Myers's thought may have\nbeen (I don't say, was) entirely determined by the automatist's\nown associations of ideas ; and so far as my interpretation of\nthe script and the arguments I found on that interpretation\nare concerned, it is quite immaterial how the form was deter-\nmined, provided that the idea did obtain expression in some\nform or other.\nBut even if I had suggested that \" ascripta glebae \" and\n\" glebis adscripta \" were the very words of Myers, then, though\nso gratuitous a conjecture would have been open to many objec-\ntions, I do not think it would have been open to the objection\nraised by M. Maxwell : viz. that Myers was too good a scholar\nto have accepted adscriptus glebae as a paraphrase of e-wdpoupo?.\nMyers was a fine scholar, but he was not a pedant or a\n\f418 J. G. Pidclington. [part\nGerman commentator. In fact he had quite a lot of imagina-\ntion. I take the first book of Myers's that comes to my hand,\nhis Essays Classical, open it at random, turn a couple of pages\nand pitch upon Myers's version of Aen. VI. 719-721 (p. 172):\n\" O father, must I deem that souls can pray\nHence to turn backward to the worldly day 1\nChange for that weight of flesh these forms more fair,\nFor that sun's sheen this paradisal air 1\n\" Paradisal air\"! A word significant of a Christian conception\nused to denote a Pagan conception ! Why, this is every bit\nas bad as any \" erreur juridique et etymologique.\" Nor can we\nplead in Myers's defence that he was driven to write \" paradisal\ninstead of \" Elysian \" by the exigencies of metre, for lie commits\nthe same unpardonable blunder in prose (see Essays Classical,\np. 141).\nAs regards M. Maxwell's criticism generally, it seems to me\nthat much of it would have been valuable, had we really said\nthe things that he represents us as having said ; and that\nmuch of it may prove effective, because few people take the\ntrouble to verify references.\n\flxvii.] Andrew Lang and Psychical Research, 419\nII.\nANDREW LANG AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nBy the REV.

[part\nall his serious work, all that was not of the spontaneous exuber-\nance of his natural genius, bears abundant evidence of solid\nstudy, and one may judge that much of it will be of lasting\nvalue. Indeed, his insatiability as a reader would seem to be\npartly the key to his productiveness as a writer. He may\nhave found, and no doubt did, that \" much study is a weari-\nness of the flesh,\" but for him at least it was no less an\ninvigoration of the spirit ; each new acquisition of knowledge\nwas an inspiration,\u2014he had climbed a fresh \" peak in Darien.\"\nIt is beyond the scope of the present article to attempt\nany general review of Mr. Lang's works, which would indeed\nrequire a volume ; but one feature of his style is so all-per-\nvading and characteristic that it demands at least a passing-\nmention. I mean that buoyant and piquant liveliness which\ngives his work its unique flavour. He was never dull ; and\nif ever he felt inclined to dulness, one may be sure he laid\ndown his pen, with a smile at the humorousness of expecting\nto interest a reader in what is not interesting. He brought\nto everything he handled an elastic freshness of thought and\nfancy which is delightfully stimulating, and with which he\nwould, I believe, have made a treatise on drains attrac-\ntive. The diction is of course that of a scholar, choice and\npolished ; the thoughts are presented with instinctive grace-\nfulness ; and much even of his most serious work (too much,\nas some unappreciative critics have thought) is strewn with\nepigrams, sudden turns of humour, and sallies of delicious wit.\nIn this kind he was an unrivalled master. Who but he\nwould have enforced a deprecation of the employment of paid\nmediums by declaring that \" even the most honourable amateur\nmust make to her commercial sister this sad confession :\n\"Said Fanny, tho' tears it may cost,\nI think we must part, my dear Sue,\nFor your character's totally lost,\nAnd I've not sufficient for two.\"\nThis prevailing gaiety of manner was not a symptom of inability\nto feel seriously about serious things; to suppose this would\nbe to mistake him,\u2014a thing which, as Mr. J. M. Barrie recently\nsaid, the sober Sassenach has sometimes done. The spiritual\nin man, the evolution and limits of his psychical equipment,\n\flxvil] Andrew Lang and Psychical Research. 421\nand all the importunate puzzle of human life, are no trivial\nproblems, and no man who did not feel deeply about them\nwould devote to such subjects, as Mr. Lang did, a life-long\nstudy ; but profoundly serious as was his interest, he could not\nas a rule speak or write on them for long without something-\nstirring his irrepressible sense of humour. There was indeed\na vein of (Scottish ?) whimsicality running through his nature\nbut it was not levity, it was not base metal, \u2014only just a\nstreak of silver making a foil to the gold. The habitual light-\nness of a man's literary touch is not to be taken as a criterion\nof the whole nature. Should we have known one side of\nTom Hood if he had not given us One more Unfortunate and\nThe Song of the Shirt ? And after all, as was asked long\nago, ridentem dicerc veruni quid vetat ?\u2014why should not truth\nwear a smile ?\nMr. Lang, who was President of our Society for 1911,\nbecame a member only some seven years ago ; but his\ninterest in the Society's work is of long standing. A paper\nby him on the Cock Lane Ghost was read at one of our\nmeetings in 1894, and from that date he made frequent and\nvaluable contributions to the Journal and Proceedings. One of\nthe earliest of these, Queen Mary's Diamonds (Journal, Vol. VII., p.\n116), tells a story which strongly piques one's curiosity, and\nwhich would be, as he says, a convincing case of \" retrocogni-\ntion,\" if only it were just a little better ! Earlier still,\nCustom and Myth, published in 1884, contains a chapter on\nthe Divining Eod. In those benighted days he regarded the\nrod as a mildly mischievous instrument of superstition, but\nProfessor Barrett's laborious investigations converted him to a\nwhole-hearted belief in the dowser's faculty fact, and\na serviceable fact\" (Presidentied Address, 1911). The article\non Psychical Kesearch in the Pncyclojxtedia Pritannica (1902)\nwas contributed by him, and is a well-considered r4sum6 of\nthe results achieved up to that date.\nThe general result (he writes) is a normal explanation, not yet\ncomplete, of the phenomena hitherto attributed to witch-craft, in-\nspiration, possession, and so forth. Probably the devils, saints,\nangels, and spirits who have communicated with witches, living saints,\ndemoniacs, and visionaries are mere hallucinatory reflections from\nthe subconscious self, endowed with its stores of latent memories\n\f422 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nand strangely acute percipient faculties. . . . But it would not be\ncandid to say that the explanation is complete or nearly complete.\nThe nature of the hypnotic trance itself remains matter of dispute.\nThe knowledge automatically revealed can by no means always be\naccounted for, either by latent memory or by the sharpening of\nthe normal powers of perception, while the limits of telepathy (if\nit be accepted) are vaguely conjectured. Even the simple results\nof \"crystal-gazing\" are often very perplexing. . . . When the visions\nare not mere fancy pictures, but correctly represent remote persons\nand events, unknown to the gazer, and perhaps unknown to all\npresent, but later (in the case of the events) verified, the explana-\ntion is rather to seek.\nIt is not, I think, an unfair inference from some of his\nlater utterances, that he found the exclusion of an external\nagency from some of the phenomena increasingly difficult.\nThe Making of Religion, Magic and Religion, Cock Lane and\nCommon Sense, and The Book of Dreams and Ghosts are all\nstores of material interesting and valuable to students in\npsychical research. All these volumes have, I believe, been\nnoticed in our Proceedings ; but there is yet another, of no\nless interest and value in this connexion, which I find has\nnot been reviewed in the Society's publications, and of this\nsomething may appropriately be said here. I refer to The\nMaid of France. This work was published in 1908, but the\nsubject had interested Mr. Lang for many years before. Vol.\nXL of Proceedings (1895) contains an article on The Voices\nof Jeanne d'Arc which shows a thorough acquaintance with\nthe materials for her history, and from which it appears that\nhe had then formed the opinion on it which thirteen years\nof further study only served to confirm.\nIt would be impossible for Jeanne, as it was for Socrates, to\nregard these experiences as other than objective and caused by\nexternal influences. Thus I should have no hesitation about con-\nsidering her experiences mere constitutional externalisations of her\nideas. But the evidence showing that the contents of the messages\nreceived by her were such as she could not have learned in any\nnormal way is so strong, that I am compelled to believe in some\nabnormal extension of faculty, corresponding to her native and un-\nparalleled genius. To a certain extent, she was admitted within\nthe arcana and sanctuary of the universe.\n\fLXVII.] Andrew Lang and Psychical Research,. 423\n\" Come to the Salpetriere,\" said a man of science to an Abbe,\n\"and I will show you twenty Jeannes d'Arc.\" \"Has one of them\ngiven us back Alsace and Lorraine?\" said the Abbe.\nThere is the crux.\nThe Maid of France is in form historical, tracing the whole\nof Jeanne's too brief life, from the happy childhood days at\nDomremy to her shameful martyrdom, but of course the\nwhole revolves around her extraordinary psychic powers. It\nis a book not to be read, and I venture to think, from the\ntenderness with which the Maid's story is touched, not written,\nwithout inclination to tears ; the severe reserve of the narrative,\neven in the closing scenes, betrays an emotion that needed to\nbe kept in check. Of all his works it is perhaps the only one\nthroughout the writing of which the author felt not even a pass-\ning impulse to be gay. The hideous tragedy of the end seems\nto have cast its shadow forward over every page, and not once\nis the gravity of the recital broken even by a smile. It is\nplain to see that he gave his heart to the task, all his skill in\narrangement and presentation, and an enormous amount of loving\nlabour : every previous writer on the subject was studied, every\navailable document examined. The result might have been pre-\ndicted : the book is so absorbing that one is loth to put it down\ntill it is finished.\nOf the simple purity of Jeanne's character, her absolute\nsanity and sincerity, and the genuineness of her Voices and\nvisions, Mr. Lang has, as we have already seen, no least\ndoubt\nHere we may cast a backward glance of wonder at the many-\nfaceted character of the Maid. The most notable features are her\nperfect faith in her mission and in her revelations, and her constant\ntenacity of purpose. Rebuffs and ridicule could not shake her for\na moment, though her normal common sense was in perfect agreement\nwith the general opinion. An ignorant girl, who could not ride or\nfight, her mission, if deprived of its inspiration, was ridiculous.\nNobody knew it better than she ; but often she met her heavenly\nvisitors, courteous, encouraging, consoling. She wept when they\ndeparted, she kissed the ground where they had stood ; she desired\nthat they should take her with them. She was sane, yet she had\nthese ineffable experiences. In them, and in her faith in them, was\nher strength (p. 105).\n2 E\n\f424 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nI now proceed to extract some evidences of her extraordinary\npsychical powers.\nThe history shows that she had vue a distance. While wait-\ning at Vaucouleurs, she said to Baudricourt, whom she had\nbeen imploring to send her to the Dauphin, and who had sum-\nmoned her to his presence, \" In God's name, you are too slow\nin sending me : for this clay, near Orleans, a great disaster has\nbefallen the gentle Dauphin, and worse fortune he will have\nunless you send me to him.\" This was on February 12, 1429,\nthe day of the English victory in the \" Battle of the Herrings\n\"\nat Bouvray, near Orleans, from which she was distant some six\ndays' journey.\nAs to the famous mystic sword of the Maid, we really know no\nmore than she told her judges in 1431. \"While I was at Tours\nor Chinon I sent to seek for a sword in the church of St. Catherine\nof Fierbois, behind the altar; and presently it was found all rusty.\"\nAsked how she knew that the sword was there, she said \" It was\na rusty sword in the earth, with five crosses on it, and I knew of\nit through my Voices. I had never seen the man who went to\nlook for it. I wrote to the churchmen of Fierbois, and asked them\nto let me have it, and they sent it. . . . When it was found, the\nclergy rubbed it, and the rust readily fell off\" (p. 108).\nOf her prophetic power also there seems to be no room for\ndoubt : the evidence is indisputable.\nJeanne . . . was advancing towards the castle, when (as her con-\nfessor, Pasquerel, declares that she herself informed him) she was\ninsulted and sworn at by a man on horseback. She answered, \"In\nGod's name, do you swear, and you so near your death'?\" Within\nthe hour the man fell into the water (the moat 1) and was drowned.\nThe story is alluded to by a contemporary Italian letter-writer\n(p. 86).\nAnd again\nAs, when at Vaucouleurs, she had \"longed, as a woman with\nchild longs for her delivery,\" to go to Chinon, so now she prayed\nand wept, desiring sorely to succour the people of Orleans. \" You\nhold so many and such long councils,\" she said to the Dauphin later.\nHer heart was on fire to be at work, not to waste that \" one\nyear and little more \" during which she was to endure, as she kept\n\flxvil] Andrew Lang and Psychical Research. 425\ntelling the Dauphin. It is d'Alencon who vouches for this sad and\nabsolutely accurate repeated prophecy. Jeanne must have made it\nfrom the first, for in a letter dated \"Bruges, May 10, 1429,\" the\nwriter remarks, \"It is said that the maid is to achieve two more\ngreat feats\" (in addition to the relief of Orleans), \"and then to\ndie.\" We must think of her as always foreknowing, and always\ndisregarding, her swiftly approaching end (p. 91).\nNext we have a prophecy of her wounding at Orleans,\nrecorded before the event\nAt this time, at least before April 22 [1429], when the fact was\nrecorded in a letter by de Rotselaer, a Flemish diplomatist at\nLyons, Jeanne told the King that she would be wounded at Orleans\nby an arrow or cross-bow bolt, but not mortally. The prediction\nwas fulfilled ; it is more singular that it was recorded in writing a\nfortnight before the event (p. 109).\nShe prophesied her capture :\nAnd now her Voices abandoned her : not that they were silent,\nbut they gave no warlike counsel. She told her judges the heart-\nbreaking story. It was in Easter week (April 17-23 [1430]), and it\nseems to have been in a moment of triumph, that, \" as I was\non the ramparts of Melun, St. Catherine and St. Margaret warned\nme that I should be captured before Midsummer day ; that so it\nmust needs be : nor must I be afraid and astounded ; but take all\nthings well, for God would help me. So they spoke, almost every\nday. And I prayed that when I was taken I might die in that\nhour, without wretchedness of long captivity ; but the Voices said\nthat so it must be. Often I asked the hour, which they told me\nnot; had I known the hour, I would not have gone into battle.\"\nHer allotted year, she knew, was almost ended, but the prophecy\nof the Voices came with the shock of certainty, \u2014the Voices that\nspoke not of instant death, but a myriad times worse, of capture.\nWould not the bravest man, with the prospect of the death by fire\nin case of his capture, would not Ney or Skobeleff, Wallace or\nGordon, have blenched 1 But the Maid rode on, first in the charge,\nlast in the retreat. There is no other such tale in history. She\nwas the bravest of the brave (p. 228).\nTwo other prophecies will be found on pp. 265 and 272 ;\nand I should have liked to recall the story of her knowledge\nof the Dauphin's secret, but must forbear. The extracts already\n\f426 Rev. M. A. Bayfield, [part\ngiven will suffice to show with what a sympathetic touch the\nauthor has handled one of the most piteous tales in all\nhistory.\nAs is well known, Mr. Lang preferred to study the field of\npsychical phenomena, with one exception, from the historical\nand anthropological point of view, rather than as an experi-\nmenter. The exception was crystal-gazing ;\nalthough no \" scryer\n\"\nhimself, he assisted at a very large numher of experiments, and\nit is through him that we have some of our most valuable\nevidence on the subject. But while in his own chief work in\nthese matters he took the wider range, he was an untiring advo-\ncate of research into the phenomena themselves, and for their\nown sake. He held that certain beliefs and practices found\nall over the world in all ages probably rest on some undis-\ncovered basis of psychic truth and fact ; he refused to take\nthem as the mere outcome of savage man's playful fancy and\nfraudulent proclivities, or to accept the \" survival and revival\ntheory as a sufficient account of modern instances. He main-\ntained\u2014and in this he was at one with the founders of our\nSociety\u2014that since there is so much smoke, there must be\nsome fire ; and he never wearied of pouring his genial mockery\non the \" scientific \" temper which protests it can see no smoke\nand that there is nothing to investigate. The slip-shod reason-\ning and language of his opponents, and their frequent inability\nto see the real issue, made them an easy prey to his acute\ndialectic ; and he came at last to hold so cheap the logic and\nverbal currency of scientific obscurantism, with its ever- recurring\n\" presumably \" this and \" doubtless \" that, that he calls this\n\" doubtless \" \" the '\ndoubtless '\nof science,\" which merely marks\nwhat the writer \"prefers to think\"! I quote from Magic and\nBdvjion his impression of the scientific method in connexion\nwith the subjects of which he treats\nIn the long run magic and religion are to die out, perhaps, and\nscience is to have the whole field for herself.\nThis may be a glorious though a remote prospect. But surely it\nis above all things needful that our science should be scientific.\nShe must not blink facts, merely because they do not fit into her\nscheme or hypothesis of the nature of things, or of religion. She\nreally must give as much prominence to the evidence which contra-\ndicts as to that which supports her theory in each instance. Not\n\flxvii.] Anclreiv Lang and Psychical Research. 427\nonly must she not shut her eyes to this evidence, but she must\ndiligently search for it, must seek for what Bacon calls instantiae\ncontradictoriae, since, if these exist, the theory which ignores them is\nuseless. If she advances a hypothesis, it must not be contrary to\nthe whole mass of human experience. . . . Again science must not\npile one unverified hypothesis upon another unverified hypothesis\ntill her edifice rivals the Tower of Babel. She must not make a\nconjecture on p. 35, and on p. 210 treat the conjecture as a fact. . . .\nIt seems hardly necessary, but it is not superfluous, to add that in\nher castle of hypotheses, one must not contradict, and therefore\ndestroy, another.\nThis kind of reasoning, with its inferring of inferences from other\ninferences, themselves inferred from conjectures as to the existence\nof facts of which no proof is adduced, must be called superstitious\nrather than scientific. The results may be interesting, but they are\nthe reverse of science (p. 4).\nIt would indeed seem to be no easy matter to\n\"hold the eel of science by the tail,\"\nif I may change Mr. Lang's metaphor and slightly alter the\napplication of Pope's. Yet to one scientific eel after another\ndid he address himself, with well-sanded hands. In con-\ntroversy, which he dearly loved, as every man loves what he\ncan engage in with success, he was always a courteous fighter,\nbut he was a dangerous one to meet. If the enemy had weak places\nin his harness, let him beware, for not one would escape a\nthrust from this practised fencing-master of debate, who knew\nevery trick of the game. In Cock Lane and Common Sense\nmany pages are devoted to the logical vagaries of the famous\n\"Dr. Carpenter, C.B, M.D., LL.D., F.E.S., F.G.S., V.P.L.S.,\nCorresponding Member of the Institute of France, tout ce quit,\ny a de plus official, dc plus cUcore',\" who more than once in the\n\" seventies \" charged at the windmill of psychical phenomena\n(and other windmills) with more zeal than discretion. Here\nis a specimen of Andrew Lang in his lighter manner\nIn three pages Dr. Carpenter has shown that \" early scientific\ntraining \" in physiology and pathology does not necessarily enable\nits professor to state a case fully. Nor does it prompt him to discrimi-\nnate between rumours coming, a hundred and fifty years after the\n\f428 Rev. M. A. Bayfield.

In matters wholly marvellous, like Home's flight in\nthe air, the evidence of three living and honourable men need not,\nof course, convince us of the fact. But this evidence is in itself a\nfact to be considered\u2014\" Why do these three gentlemen tell this\ntale 1\n\" we ask ; but Dr. Carpenter jmts the evidence on the level\nof patristic tattle many centuries old, written down, on no authority,\nlong after the event. Yet the worthy doctor calmly talks about\n\" want of scientific culture preventing people from appreciating the\nforce of scientific reasoning,\" and that after giving such examples of\n\" scientific reasoning \" as we have examined. It is in this way that\nScience makes herself disliked. (Ibid., p. 327.)\nAfter reading all, or nearly all, that Mr. Lang has written\nabout levitation, poltergeistry, and telekinesis in general, I con-\nfess to feeling a quite masculine curiosity as to whether he\nwas himself finally convinced by the evidence he had so labori-\nously collected. He confessed to us in his Presidential Address\nthat he was \"not certain this kind of thing never occurs\";\nwhich sounds as though he were giving that little coup de\npoucc against inclination which he wisely recommended to us\nall, and that, in his heart of hearts, he believed \" this kind of\nthing \" does occur. Miss Johnson has shown (Proceedings,\nVol. XXI, pp. 490-496) that there are serious gaps in the\nevidence for D. D. Home's levitation, but the evidence for the\nphenomena as a whole is irritatingly strong, despite its varia-\ntions in quality; it seems to leave one in the mental con-\ndition of Tom Hood's Footman on Mount Blank, who said\nof the chamois, \" its Springs in the middle of Winter I believe\nas incredible.\"\nEqually characteristic and equally good in the controversial\nline is The Nineteenth Century and Mr. Myers {Proceedings, Vol.\nXVIII., p. 62).

FREDERIK VAN EEDEN.\nI think it will be hardly necessary in this company 1\nto refer\nexplicitly to the difficulties of treating my present subject.\nThe most important is the subtle and highly spiritual order\nof the phenomena. Their investigation leads us to the boundary\nof what is called exact Science, and brings us into the dangerous\nvicinity of metaphysical speculative systems and religious beliefs.\nIt is well-nigh impossible to discuss these ultimate psychical\nphenomena without touching on different primary scientific or\nphilosophical dogmas, and in no branch of science, I think, is\nthe inadequacy and confusion of our only instrument of orderly\nthought\u2014language\u2014more painfully brought before our mind.\nAll this, I believe, tends to justify my conviction, that for\nthe exploration of this mysterious world of dreams we want\nnot only the purely scientific, but also the poetical function.\nIn this field the pioneers have to be either poetical men of\nscience or scientific poets ; since it ' is the poet\u2014at least when\nwe attach to this word its highest and deepest meaning\u2014whose\nnatural passion it is to explore the ultimate regions of the human\nsoul and whose constant occupation is to create new spiritual\nvalues and give them accurate expression.\nSince 1896 I have studied my own dreams, writing down the\nmost interesting in my diary. In 1898 I began to keep a\nseparate account for a particular kind of dream which seemed\nto me the most important, and I have continued it up to this\n1\nThis paper was read at a meeting of the Society on April 22, 1913.\n\f432 Dr. Frederilc van Eeden. [part\nday. Altogether I collected about 500 dreams, of which 352\nare of the particular kind just mentioned. This material may\nform the basis of what I hope may become a scientific structure\nof some value, if leisure aud strength to build it up carefully\ndo not fail me.\nIn the meantime, with a pardonable anxiety lest the ideas\nshould not find expression in time, I condensed them into a\nwork of art\u2014a novel called The Bride of Breams, published\na few years ago in Holland and Germany, and an English\nedition of which will shortly be issued in ISTew York. The\nfictitious form enabled me to deal freely with delicate\nmatters, and had also the advantage that it expressed rather\nunusual ideas in a less aggressive way\u2014esoterically, so to\nspeak. Yet I want to express these ideas also in a form that\nwill appeal more directly to the scientific mind, and I know I\ncannot find a better audience for this purpose than the members\nof the S.P.R., who are accustomed to treat investigations and\nideas of an unusual sort in a broad-minded and yet critical spirit.\nIt may be said that the poet is sometimes carried away by his\nfancy ; on the other hand, the purely scientific mind is sometimes\nhandicapped by a tendency to disbelieve, and I do not see why\nthe poet, enamoured of truth and reality as he is, should be less\nseverely critical than the man of science.\nI may take it then to be clearly understood that this paper\nis only a preliminary sketch, a short announcement of a greater\nwork, which I hope to be able to complete in later years.\nI will as much as possible avoid speculation, and limit myself\nto facts ;\nyet these facts, as I have observed them, bring me\nin a general way to the firm conviction that the theories on\ndream-life, as brought forward up to to-day, within my know-\nledge, are unable to account for all the phenomena.\nSelecting among the most prominent and most up-to-date\nauthors, I may mention Prof. Sigmund Freud, who is now\nconsidered by many as the highest authority on dreams, and\nwhose key to the mysteries of dream-life may be formulated\nin these words\nThe Dream is the symbolically expressed wish or desire of\nthe subconscious part of a human being, and generally of an\nerotic character. This view has been amply criticised, among\nothers by Mr. Havelock Ellis in his recent book, The World of\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 433\nDreams, which I regard as one of the best handbooks of\nrecent years.\nHavelock Ellis, fully acknowledging the boldness and in-\ngenuity of Freud's theory, endorses the comment of many of\nFreud's critics, that this key, however fitting in many cases,\ndoes not open all doors, and still leaves many mysteries.\nAccording to Havelock Ellis the principal characteristic of\nthe dream is psychical dissociation, and all dreams may be\naccounted for by the natural and unceasing tendency of the\nhuman mind to reason and to explain, even in a condition of\ndissociation. He supposes that the brain in sleep continues to\nreceive impressions from different internal organs, from the\ninvoluntary muscles, from the beating heart and the breathing-\nlungs, and in its dissociated state tries to bring some reasonable\norder into these sensations by inventing all sorts of curious, and\nmore or less absurd, facts, which it regards as real and as\naccounting for the confused impressions it perceives.\nMy objection to this theory, in spite of the author's inge-\nnious and plausible defence of it, is the same as his objection\nto the theory of Ereud. It does not by any means cover all\nthe facts. I would even go so far as to say that it holds\ngood in only a few exceptional cases. I hope to make it clear\nto you that it is utterly inadequate to account in particular\nfor those cases which I recorded as being the most important\nand interesting.\nI wish to mention here the name of a great Englishwoman,\nwho died last year, and whom I consider one of the deepest\nthinkers of our age.\nVictoria Lady Welby is the mother of that new branch of\nscience, now officially acknowledged by the Britannica Encyclo-\npaedia under the name of Signifies, corresponding to Breal's\nterm Semantics. Her contention was that at the bottom of\nall our disputes, and even of all our misery, is the careless\nand inadequate use of language. According to my own ex-\nperience, this want of \" signifies\n\"\n\u2014Lady Welby's new science\nis felt in every discussion, and I rarely begin a lecture with-\nout a warning about it.\nIn the present case we find a good illustration of Lady\nWelby's contention. Havelock Ellis, in his explanation of\ndream-phenomena, says, quoting Vaschide and Pieron, that \"the\n\f434 Dr. Freclerik van Eeclen. [part\ninternal sensations develop at the expense of the peripheral\nsensations. That indeed seems to be the secret of the immense\nemotional turmoil of our dreams.\"\nNow it seems to me that the word internal, by the authors\njust mentioned and by many others, is used in a deceptive way,\nwithout recognition of its shifting value, its signitical quality.\nIt stands for the contrary of peripheral, yet when the word is\nused its significance imperceptibly becomes metaphorical.\nIn opposition to sensations derived from the skin, the visceral\nsensations might lie called internal. But from the psychical\npoint of view, any bodily sensation, whether it be from the skin,\nfrom the heart, or from the kidneys, is external in a metaphorical\nsense.\nFor students of natural science, brought up in the nineteenth\ncentury, this confusion is very difficult to avoid. The ruling\nopinion of that time looked upon the physical body as the whole\nof a human being. A human being, it was thought, consisted\nentirely of things that could be perceived in three-dimensional\nspace. The simple fact, now beginning to be dimly realised\nby men of science, that psychical facts are non-spatial, and\ntherefore cannot be expressed otherwise than by metaphor, was\nutterly disregarded.\nFor instance, Maury, for long the great authority on dreams,\nspeaks repeatedly of \" impressions internes, intercerebrales,\" as\ncontinuing during dream-life, while the outer impressions, that\nis, the peripheral, are benumbed.\nNow dreams are purely psychical phenomena. They have,\nof course, connections and associations with the physical body.\nYet their most characteristic feature is that they are non-spatial,\nthat is to say, inner in a metaphorical sense. Havelock Ellis\nagrees that even the visceral sensations are not perceived as\nsuch, but are transformed into symbols, i.e. into purely psychical\nphenomena.\nAccording to my experience, not only the peripheral but also\nthe interned sensations, in so far as they are spatial, are inhibited\nin dream-life. Not only are the senses of hearing, smelling,\nseeing, tasting, touching, etc., cut off from the mind of the\nsleeper, but also the more vague and ill-defined bodily sensa-\ntions,\u2014muscle-sensations, visceral sensations, sensations of bodily\nwell-being or of pain or discomfort.\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 435\nIn a word, the physical body, though it continues to live and\nto act in certain ways, does not convey its sensations directly\nto the mind in complete sleep and dream. All immediate con-\nnection between the mind, with its non-spatial facts, and the\nbody, with its facts that can be expressed in spatial terms, stops\nduring sleep and dream.\nI would even go so far as to draw the line at this point\nbetween dream and waking life. So long as a bodily sensation,\nbe it internal or peripheral, is perceived, there is not yet com-\nplete sleep or dream, and any abnormal perception that occurs\nmust be called a waking hallucination. When sleep and dream\nset in, all direct bodily rapport is cut off. This is its\nessential and characteristic feature.\nLet me now give you an attempt at classification of the\ndifferent forms of dreams, which I myself personally experi-\nenced and observed during a period of sixteen years. I have\nbeen able to distinguish nine different kinds of dreams, each\nof which presents a well-defined type. There are of course\nintermediate forms and combinations, but the separate types can\nstill be recognised in their intermingling.\nIn this scheme I wish to draw attention to the type\nindicated by the letter (H), which I call initial dreams. This\nkind of dream is very rare ; I know of only half-a-dozen\ninstances occurring to myself, and have found no clear indica-\ntion of them in other authors. Yet it is very characteristic\nand easily distinguishable. It occurs only in the very beginning\nof sleep, when the body is in a normal healthy condition, but\nvery tired. Then the transition from waking to sleep takes\nplace with hardly a moment of what is generally called\nunconsciousness, but what I would prefer to call discontinuity\nof memory. It is not what Maury calls a hypnagogic halluci-\nnation, which phenomenon I know well from my own experience,\nbut which I do not consider to belong to the world of dreams.\nIn hypnagogic hallucinations we have visions, but we have full\nbodily perception. In the initial dream type (H), I see and\nfeel as in any other dream. I have a nearly complete recol-\nlection of day-life, I know that I am asleep and where I am\nsleeping, but all perceptions of the physical body, inner and\nouter, visceral or peripheral, are entirely absent. Usually I\nhave the sensation of floating or flying, and I observe with\n\f436 Br. FrederiJc van Eeden.

[part\nperfect clearness that the feeling of fatigue, the discomfort of\nbodily overstrain, has vanished. I feel fresh and vigorous ; I\ncan move and float in all directions ;\nyet I know that my\nbody is at the same time dead tired and fast asleep.\nOne experience of this remarkable form of dream seems to\nme sufficient for the careful observer to undo all current\ntheories. I know quite well, by my own experience, that\ncertain bodily conditions and sensory sensations have influence\non dreams. I can give instances of dreams in which sounds\nfrom the waking world, the ticking of a clock, the noise of\nwind, or my own difficult breathing, or snoring, have pene-\ntrated into the dream-world and caused some dream-fancy.\nIn one dream, when near waking up, I found myself sitting\nin company with others, and I heard the sound of snoring.\nI looked round at the other people, asking, \" Who is it that\nsnores ?\n\" and then, on waking up, I found that I myself was\nthe only culprit.\nBut I consider that cases in which the sounds or impressions\nof day-life\u2014bodily sensations\u2014penetrate into the dream-life, are\nexceptional, whereas nearly all scientific observers of dreams up\nto the present day start from the supposition that these bodily\nsensations account for all dreams. And I think you will\nagree that the direction in which the observer is looking\nmust make a great difference in the outcome of any investi-\ngation.\nMost students of dream-life begin with the supposition that\ndreams are more or less abnormal phenomena caused by some\nabnormal condition of the body, and their experiments are\nmostly directed towards trying to provoke dreams by artificial\nbodily conditions.\nAs the outcome of careful observations, I maintain my\nconviction that the bodily conditions of the sleeper have, as a\nrule, no influence on the character of dreams, with the exception\nof a few rare and abnormal cases, near the moment of waking\nup, or in those dreams which I have classified as pathological,\nunder letter (I), in which fever, indigestion, or some poison,\nplays a role, and which form a small minority. For myself\nas the observer, I may state that I have been in good health\nall the time of observation. I had no important complaints of\nany nervous or visceral kind. My sleep and digestion both\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 439\nare usually good. Yet I have had the most terrible nightmares,\nwhile my body was as fresh and healthy as usual, and I have\nhad delicious peaceful dreams on board ship in a heavy storm,\nor in a sleeping-car on the railway.\nIn April, 1906, I was suffering from violent tooth-ache. I\nwas in Italy and did not wish to go to a foreign dentist.\nI succeeded, however, in falling asleep, and entered at once on a\ndream of type (F), which I call demon-dreams. I had a perfect\nrecollection of my waking life ; I knew that I was sleeping and\nthat my tooth was still aching. Yet 1 did not feel it. I\nrealised that I was in the demoniacal sphere, which I recognise\nby the weird uncanny effect produced by apparently harmless\nobjects, which are seen very sharply and vividly. I could\nshut my eyes, as it seemed to me, and when I opened\nthem again, the same objects\u2014a tea-pot, a clothes-brush, a\ntriangle, and so on\u2014were still there, and still uncanny and\nthreatening. Then came what I shall have to call demon-\npersonalities, who do not seem human, and yet seem to act\nand speak like independent beings. Usually I am able to\ndrive them away by a voluntary act, e.g. by shouting and\nthreatening. But this time I felt powerless, and I debated\nin my dream whether the tooth-ache could be the cause of\nthis weakness. Then I asked one of the demons what was\nthe reason of my unusual weakness. He answered :\n\" Probably\nthe heat,\" and at this answer I considered whether I had\nleft the radiator of the hotel-room open. But soon I under-\nstood that the answer was a senseless mockery, irony or\nstupidity. And I slept the whole night without feeling any\npain. Next morning the pain was felt again and I had the\ntooth extracted.\nNow it must be clear that the theory which explains the\nfancies of dreams by an attempt of the mind to reconstruct\na false reality in order to account for subconscious sensations,\nwill never do in such cases. For my mind was perfectly\naware of the state of things ; it knew about the tooth-ache,\nit knew that I was sleeping in a hotel-room with a radiator.\nYet I felt no bodily sensation at all, not even such a penetrating\none as a violent tooth-ache.\nI wish, therefore, to define the true dream as that state\nwherein bodily sensations, be they visceral, interned or peripheral,\n\f440 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [part\ncannot penetrate to the mind directly, but only in the psychical,\nnon-spatial form of a symbol or an image.\nI purposely avoid as much as possible the words \" con-\nsciousness \" and \" unconsciousness.\" They may be convenient\nin colloquial language, but I am not able to attach any clear\nmeaning to them. I have no idea what \" unconsciousness,\"\nas a substantive, may stand for. And I found that I could\ndo with the words memory and recollection and the word\npersonality or person, in the primitive sense of persona (a\nmask, i.e. the mask worn by players). I do not think it\naccurate to call the body of a sleeper or a narcotised man\nunconscious. During my career as a psycho-therapeutist, having\nby suggestion produced sleep in many people, I learnt that the\nhuman body may act like a self-conscious person, without any\nparticipation of the recollecting mind. We know nowadays\nthat a splitting-up of human personality is possible, not only\ninto two. but into three or more. During my sittings with\nMrs. Thompson 1\nwe observed that after a trance, in which\nMrs. Thompson had been speaking as \" Nelly,\" or as some other\ncontrol, she herself remembered dreams, which had nothing\nwhatever to do with the things of which she had been\nspeaking to us. Her being could then be said to have been\ndivided into three entities,\u2014the body in trance, apparently\nasleep ; the \" control,\" who spoke through her mouth ; and\nMrs. Thompson, who was dreaming in cprite different spheres.\nAll these persons or personalities were of course \" conscious\nin some way, as everything is probably conscious. The\ncpaestion is, where do the threads of recollection run that\nenable us to identify the persons.\nI know that Mr. Havelock Ellis and many other authors will\nnot accept my definition, because they deny the possibility\nof complete recollection and free volition in a dream. They\nwould say that what I call a dream is no dream, but a sort\nof trance, or hallucination, or ecstasy. The observations of the\nMarquis d'Herve, which were very much like mine, as related\nin Ins book, Les Reves et les rnoyens de les diriger, were discarded\nin the same way. These dreams could not be dreams, said\nMaury.\nNow this is simply a question of nomenclature. I can only\n^ee Proceedings, Vol. XVII., pp. 75-115.\n\flxvii.] A Study of Dreams. 441\nsay that I made my observations during normal deep and\nhealthy sleep, and that in 352 cases I had a full recollec-\ntion of my day-life, and could act voluntarily, though I was\nso fast asleep that no bodily sensations penetrated into my\nperception. If anybody refuses to call that state of mind\na dream, he may suggest some other name. For my part,\nit was just this form of dream, which I call \" lucid dreams\n(see E in the table), which aroused my keenest interest and\nwhich I noted down most carefully.\nI cmite agree with Mr. Havelock Ellis, that during sleep the\npsychical functions enter into a condition of dissociation. My\ncontention, however, is that it is not dissociation, but, on the\ncontrary, reintegration, after the dissociation of sleep, that is the\nessential feature of dreams. The dream is a, more or less complete\nreintegration of the psyche, a reintegration in a different sphere,\nin a psychical, non-spatial mode of existence. This reintegration\nmay go so far as to effect full recollection of day-life, reflection,\nand voluntary action on reflection.\nI will now make a short survey of the nine modes of\ndreaming, as indicated in my Table, giving an instance of each\nof them, and will then give further details of the more im-\nportant and interesting types.\nType (A) is the usual well-known type to which the large\nmajority of dreams conform ;\nprobably it is the only kind that\noccurs to many people. It is not particularly pleasant or un-\npleasant, though it may vary according to its contents. It may\noccur in any moment of sleep, in daytime or in the night,\nand it does not need any bodily disturbance to produce it. Most\npeople, however healthy, dream ; and if they say they do not,\nit must be uncertain whether there is really an absence of\ndreams or only a lack of remembrance of them. The same\ndoubt may be applied to the view that there is a perfectly\ndreamless sleep. According to my view the attempts of the\npsyche at reintegration begin almost immediately after sleep has\nset in and continue during the whole time of sleeping. When\naroused by an alarum -clock at different hours of the night,\nunexpectedly, I was always able to remember some fragments\nof a dream. I admit, however, that this is no absolute proof,\nbecause it is possible that the dream was inserted, so to speak,\ninto the space of time between the bodily sensation caused by\n\f442 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [part\nthe alarum, and the transmission of this sensation to the dream-\ning mind. This space of time may be rather considerable. It\nmay be compared to the space of time required by an \" absent-\nminded \" person before he realises the import of a question\nput to him ; it may be not only seconds but even minutes\nbefore he hears the question psychically, though he heard it\nbodily quite distinctly, and remembers it in full. This space\nof time is still longer at the moment of awakening, and in my\nopinion accounts very easily for the often reported and apparently\nmiraculous phenomenon of a sleeper being awakened by a sound\nthat fits in exactly with the end of a long dream. The classic\ninstance of this is Maury's dream, in which a piece of the\nbed-cornice fell on his neck when he was dreaming that he\nwas lying on a scaffold-block to be beheaded. Most likely the\nbodily shock came first ; the sleeper's mind was then called,\nbut could not be reached directly; the bodily sensation had\nfirst to be translated, so to speak, psychically, into the form\nof a story, finishing with his waking up.\nThese dreams of type (A) show dissociation, with very imper-\nfect reintegration, and, as several authors have pointed out, they\nhave in many respects a close likeness to insanity. The true\nconditions of day-life are not remembered ; false remembrance\nparamnesia\u2014is very common in them ;\nthey are absurd and\nconfused, and leave very faint traces after waking up.\nType (B) differs from (A) principally in its vividness and the\nstrong impression it makes, which lasts sometimes for hours and\ndays after waking up, with a painfully clear remembrance of\nevery detail. These dreams are generally considered to be the\neffect of some abnormal bodily condition. Yet I think they\nmust undoubtedly be distinguished from the pathological dreams.\nI have had them during perfectly normal bodily conditions. I\ndo not mean to say, however, that some nervous disturbance,\nsome psychical unrest, or some unknown influence from the\nwaking world, may not have been present. It may have\nbeen, but it escaped my observation in most cases. Dreams\nof type (B) are generally extremely absurd, or untrue, though\nexplicit and well remembered. The mind is entirely dissociated,\nand reintegration is very defective. A fine instance of this\nsort of dream is described by Dostojefski in Crime and Punish-\nment, when Raskolnikoff sleeps before he commits the murder.\n\fLXVII.J A Study of Dreams. 443\nCuriously enough I had a dream of the same type the night\nafter reading that book. In that dream I had committed a\nmurder myself\u2014a dream-feeling well known to dream-students.\nI thought it remarkable because the psychical cause of it was\nclear in this case and my bodily condition was entirely normal.\nAs a rule I find dreams of this kind unpleasant, because\nof their absurdity, their insane character, and the strong lasting\nimpression they make. Happily they are rare, at least with\nme. Sometimes they leave a strong conviction that they \"mean\nsomething,\" that they have a premonitory, a prophetic character,\nand when we read of instances of prophetic dreams we find\ngenerally that they belong to the type (B). In my case I often\nfound that they really could \" mean \" nothing ;\nsometimes, how-\never, I was not so certain. It depends in what direction we\nare looking for causes. One night, when I was on a lecturing\ntour, I was the guest of a family in a provincial town, and slept\nin what I supposed to be the guest-room. I had a night full\nof the most horrid dreams, one long confused nightmare, with\na strong sentiment that it \" meant something.\" Yet I felt in\nperfect health, cheerful and comfortable. I could not refrain\nfrom saying next morning at the breakfast table what an un-\npleasant night I had had. Then the family told me I had slept\nin the room of a daughter who was now in a sanatorium with\na severe nervous disease, and who used to call that room her\n\" den of torture.\"\nAnother dream of the most awful description occurred to me\nin Berlin in 1906. In a dark night, dead tired and forlorn,\nI was plodding through an endless black, stinking marsh ;\nbeing\nold, poor, miserable, full of remorse, all night long. Yet I was\nin perfect health, and even in a hopeful and cheerful state of\nmind. The impression was so strong that I packed my trunk\nnext morning and escaped from my hosts without explanation.\nI could not help thinking that the room must be haunted by\nthe remembrance of some dreadful crime. I could never verify\nthis suspicion. A month later I received tidings of my only\nbrother in the East Indies\u2014that he died that very night in\nvery painful circumstances. Whether there was any connection\nbetween this and my dream I will not decide.\nIt will be remarked that such vivid dreams are some-\ntimes of a very pleasant character, filling whole days with\n\f.444 Dr. Frederik van Eeclen. [part\nan indescribable joy. This is true, but, according to my\nexperience, my vividly pleasant dreams are now always of\nanother and higher type. As a child I had these delicious\ndreams of the type (B). Now they have changed their char-\nacter altogether and are of type (E).\nIn type (C), the symbolic or mocking dreams, the charac-\nteristic element is one which I call demoniacal. I am afraid\nthis word will arouse some murmurs of disapproval, or at\nleast some smiles or sneers. Yet I think I can successfully\ndefend the use of the term. I will readily concede at once\nthat the real existence of beings whom we may call \" demons\n: '\nis problematic. But the real existence of the interstellar aether\nis also problematic, and yet men of science find the conception\nvery useful and convenient.\nI hope to satisfy even the most sceptical of my audience\nby defining the expression \" demoniacal \" thus\n\/ call demoniacal those phenomena which piroducc on us the\nimpression of being invented or arranged by intelligent beings of\na very low moral order.\nTo me it seems that the great majority of dreams reported\nby Freud and his adherents, and used for the building up of\nhis elaborate theory, belong to type (C).\nIt may indeed be called a bold deed to introduce the\nsymbolism of dreams into the scientific world. This is Freud's\ngreat achievement.\nBut now let us consider what the word \" symbol \" implies.\nA symbol is an image or an imaginary event, standing for a\nreal object or event whereto it has some distant resemblance.\nNow the invention of a symbol can only be an act of thought,\n\u2014the work of some intelligence. Symbols cannot invent them-\nselves ;\nthey must be thought out. And the question arises\nwho performs this intelligent act ; who thinks out the symbol ?\nThe answer given by the Freud school is : the subconscious.\nBut here we have one of those words which come in \" wo die\nBegriffe fehlen.\" To me the word \" subconscious,\" indicating\na thinking entity, is just as mysterious, just as unscientific,\njust as \" occult \" as the word \" demon.\" In my view it is\naccurate to say only that in our dreams we see images and\nexperience events, for which our own mind,\u2014our \" person \" as\nwe remember it,\u2014cannot be held responsible, and which must\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 445\ntherefore come from some unknown source. About the general\ncharacter of these sources, however, we may form some judgment\nand I feel justified in calling them in the dreams of type (C)\n\" demoniacal,\"\u2014that is of a low moral order.\nIt is in class (C) also, that the erotic element, or rather\nthe obscene element, plays such an important part. And it is\nno wonder that some adherents of Freud's school, studying\nonly this kind of dream, come to the conclusion that all dreams\nhave a sexual origin.\nMocking dreams can be very amusing, as many instances in\ndream-literature show. The day before my fiftieth anniversary\nI was made the victim of a funny dream-joke. There was to\nbe a pageant in my honour, and the town was all full of flags.\nWhen the pageant came, it consisted first of a cow, then a\nhorse, then a gentleman on foot, who fired blank shots from\na revolver, then a carriage with four gentlemen, and, to wind\nup with, an old, rickety, wobbling automobile that advanced\nvery slowly.\n1\nType (D), which I call general dream-sensations, is very\nremarkable but not easy to describe. It is not an ordinary\ndream ; there is no vision, no image, no event, not even a\nword or a name. But during a long time of deep sleep, the\nmind is continually occupied with one person, one place, one\nremarkable event, or even one abstract thought. At least that\nis the recollection on waking up. One night I was constantly\noccupied by the personality of an American gentleman, in whom\n[ am not particularly interested. I did not see him, nor hear\nhis name, but on waking up I felt as if he had been there\nthe whole night. In another instance it was a rather deep\nthought, occupying me in the deepest sleep, with a clear recol-\nlection of it after waking up. The question was : Why can a\nperiod of our life be felt as very sad, and yet be sweet and\nbeautiful in remembrance ? And the answer was : Because a\nhuman being knows only a very small part of what he is.\nQuestion and answer never left me ;\nyet my sleep was very\ndeep and unbroken. These dream-sensations are not unpleasant\nand not absurd, so long as the body is in good health.\nThey often have an elevating or consoling effect. In patho-\n1\nProfessor Freud will see here a fine instance of a subconscious wish, expressed\nby inversion.\n\f446 Br. Frederik van Eeden. [part\nlogical dreams, however, type (I), they may be extremely strange\nand harassing. The sleeper may have a feeling as if he were\na square or a circle, or other sensations of an utterly inde-\nscribable character.\nClass (E), the type of dreams which I called \" lucid dreams,\"\nseems to me the most interesting and worthy of the most\ncareful observation and study. Of this type I experienced and\nwrote down 852 cases in the period between January 20, 1898,\nand December 26, 1912.\nIn these dreams the reintegration of the psychic functions is\nso complete that the sleeper remembers day-life and his own\ncondition, reaches a state of perfect awareness, and is able\nto direct his attention, and to attempt different acts of free\nvolition. Yet the sleep, as I am able confidently to state, is\nundisturbed, deep and refreshing. I obtained my first glimpse\nof this lucidity during sleep in June, 1897, in the following\nway. I dreamt that I was floating through a landscape with\nbare trees, knowing that it was April, and I remarked that\nthe perspective of the branches and twigs changed quite\nnaturally. Then I made the reflection, during sleep, that my\nfancy would never be able to invent or to make an image as\nintricate as the perspective movement of little twigs seen in\nfloating by.\nMany years later, in 1907, I found a passage in a work\nby Prof. Ernst Mach, Analyse der Fmpfindungen, p. 164, in\nwhich the same observation is made with a little difference.\nLike me, Mach came to the conclusion that he was dreaming,\nbut it was because he saw the movement of the twigs to be\ndefective, while I had wondered at the naturalness which my\nfancy could never invent. Professor Mach has not pursued\nhis observations in this direction, probably because he did not\nbelieve in their importance. I made up my mind to look out\ncarefully for another opportunity. I prepared myself for\ncareful observation, hoping to prolong and to intensify the\nlucidity.\nIn January, 1898, I was able to repeat the observation.\nIn the night of January 19-20, I dreamt that I was lying\nin the garden before the windows of my study, and saw the\neyes of my dog through the glass pane. I was lying on my\nchest and observing the dog very keenly. At the same time,\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 447\nhowever, I knew with perfect certainty that I was dreaming\nand lying on my back in my bed. And then I resolved to\nwake up slowly and carefully and observe how my sensation\nof lying on my chest would change into the sensation of lying\non my back. And so I did, slowly and deliberately, and the\ntransition\u2014which I have since undergone many times\u2014is most\nwonderful. It is like the feeling of slipping from one body\ninto another, and there is distinctly a double recollection of\nthe two bodies. I remembered what I felt in my dream,\nlying on my chest ; but returning into the day-life, I remem-\nbered also that my physical body had been quietly lying on\nits back all the while. This observation of a double memory\nI have had many times since. It is so indubitable that it\nleads almost unavoidably to the conception of a dream-body.\nMr. Havelock Ellis says with something of a sneer that\nsome people \" who dabble in the occult \" speak of an astral\nbody. Yet if he had had only one of these experiences, he\nwould feel that we can escape neither the dabbling nor the\ndream-body. In a lucid dream the sensation of having a\nbody,\u2014having eyes, hands, a mouth that speaks, and so on,\nis perfectly distinct ;\nyet I know at the same time that the\nphysical body is sleeping and has quite a different position.\nIn waking up the two sensations blend together, so to speak,\nand I remember as clearly the action of the dream-body as\nthe restfulness of the physical body.\nIn February, 1899, I had a lucid dream, in which I made\nthe following experiment. I drew with my finger, moistened\nby saliva, a wet cross on the palm of my left hand, with the\nintention of seeing whether it would be still there after waking\nup. Then I dreamt that I woke up and felt the wet cross\non my left hand by applying the palm to my cheek. And\nthen a long time afterwards I woke up really and knew at\nonce that the hand of my physical body had been lying in a\nclosed position undisturbed on my chest all the while.\nThe sensation of the voice during a lucid dream is most\nmarvellous, and after many repetitions still a source of amaze-\nment. I use my voice as loudly as I can, and though I\nknow quite well that my physical body is lying in profound\nsleep, I can hardly believe that this loud voice is inaudible in\nthe waking world. Yet, though I have sung, shouted, and\n\f448 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [part\nspoken loudly in hundreds of dreams, my wife has never heard\nmy voice, and in several cases was able to assure me that I\nhad slept quite peacefully.\nI cannot in this paper give even a short and superficial\naccount of the many interesting details of these dreams. I\nmust reserve that for my larger work. And I fear that only\na repeated personal acquaintance with the facts can convince\none of their significance. I will relate a few more instances\nin order to give some idea of their character.\nOn Sept. 9, 1904, I dreamt that 1 stood at a table before\na window. On the table were different objects. I was per-\nfectly well aware that I was dreaming and I considered what\nsorts of experiments I could make. I began by trying to break\nglass, by beating it with a stone. I put a small tablet of\nglass on two stones and struck it with another stone. Yet it\nwould not break. Then I took a tine claret-glass from the\ntable and struck it with my fist, with all my might, at the\nsame time reflecting how daimerous it would be to do this in\nwaking life ;\nyet the glass remained whole. But lo ! when I\nlooked at it again after some time, it was broken.\n1\nIt broke all right, but a little too late, like an actor who\nmisses his cue. This gave me a very curious impression of\nbeing in a fake-world, cleverly imitated, but with small failures.\nI took the broken glass and threw it out of the window, in\norder to observe whether I could hear the tinkling. I heard\nthe noise all right and I even saw two dogs run away from\nit quite naturally. I thought what a good imitation this\ncomedy-world was. Then I saw a decanter with claret and\ntasted it, and noted with perfect clearness of mind: \"Well, we\ncan also have voluntary impressions of taste in this dream-\nworld ;\nthis has quite the taste of wine.\"\nThere is a saying by the German poet, Novalis, that when\nwe dream that we dream, we are near waking up. This view,\nshared as it is by the majority of observers, I must decidedly\nreject. Lucid dreams occur in deep sleep and do not as a\nrule end in waking up, unless I wish it and do it by an act\nof volition. I prefer, however, in most cases to continue\ndreaming as long as possible, and then the lucidity vanishes\n1\nThis corresponds with Mach's observation about the perspective of the\ntwigs.\n\fLxvir.] A Study of Dreams. 449\nand gives place to other forms of dream, and\u2014what seems\nremarkable\u2014the form that follows is often the \" demon-dream,\"\ntype (F) of which I will speak presently.\nThen it often happens that I dream that I wake up and\ntell my lucid dream to some other person. This latter is then\na dream of the common form (A). From this dream I wake\nup in the real waking world, very much amazed at the curious\nwanderings of my mind. The impression is as if I had been\nrising through spheres of different depths, of which the lucid\ndream was the deepest.\nI may state that without exception all my lucid dreams\noccurred in the hours between five and eight in the morning.\nThe particular significance of these hours for our dreams has\noften been brought forward,\u2014among others by Dante, Purg.\nIX., where he speaks of the hour when the swallows begin\nto warble and our mind is least clogged by the material body.\nLucid dreams are also symbolic,\u2014yet in quite a different\nway. I never remarked anything sexual or erotic in them.\nTheir symbolism takes the form of beautiful landscapes,\ndifferent luminous phenomena, sunlight, clouds, and especially\na deep blue sky. In a perfect instance of the lucid dream I\nfloat through immensely wide landscapes, with a clear blue,\nsunny sky, and a feeling of deep bliss and gratitude, which I\nfeel impelled to express by eloquent words of thankfulness and\npiety. Sometimes these words seem to me a little rhetorical,\nbut I cannot help it, as it is very difficult in dreams to con-\ntrol emotional impulses. Sometimes I conceive of what appears\nas a symbol, warning, consoling, approving. A cloud gathers\nor the light brightens. Only once could I see the disc of the\nsun.\nFlying or floating may be observed in all forms of dreams,\nexcept perhaps class (D); yet it is generally an indication that\nlucid dreams are coming.\nWhen I have been flying in my dreams for two or three\nnights, then I know that a lucid dream is at hand. And the\nlucid dream itself is often initiated and accompanied all the\ntime by the sensation of flying. Sometimes I feel myself\nfloating swiftly through wide spaces ; once I flew backwards,\nand once, dreaming that I was inside a cathedral, I flew\nupwards, with the immense building and all in it, at great\n\f450 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [part\nspeed. I cannot believe that the rhythm of our breath has\nanything to do with this sensation, as Havelock Ellis supposes,\nbecause it is generally continuous and very swift.\nDifficult, spasmodic floating belongs to dreaming of a lower\nclass, and this may depend on morbid conditions of the body\nbut it may also be symbolic of some moral difficulty or distress.\nOn Christmas-day, 1911, I bad the following dream. It\nbegan with flying and floating. I felt wonderfully light and\nstrong. I saw immense and beautiful prospects,\u2014first a town,\nthen country-landscapes, fantastic and brightly coloured. Then\nI saw my brother sitting\u2014the same who died in 1906\u2014and\nI went up to him saying :\n\" Now we are dreaming, both of\nus.\" He answered :\n\" No, I am not\n!\n\" And then I remem-\nbered that he was dead. We had a long conversation about\nthe conditions of existence after death, and I inquired especially\nafter the aware-ness, the clear, bright insight. But that he\ncould not answer ; he seemed to lack it.\nThen the lucid dream was interrupted by a common dream\nof type (A) in which I saw a lady standing on a bridge, who\ntold me she had heard me talk in my sleep. And I supposed\nthat my voice had been audible during the lucid dream.\nThen a second period of lucidity followed in which I saw\nProf, van't Hoff, the famous Dutch chemist, whom I had\nknown as a student, standing in a sort of college-room, sur-\nrounded by a number of learned people. I went up to him,\nknowing very well that he was dead, and continued my inquiry\nabout our condition after death. It was a long, quiet con-\nversation, in which I was perfectly aware of the situation.\nI asked first why we, lacking our organs of sense, could\narrive at any certainty that the person to whom we were\ntalking was really that person and not a subjective illusion.\nThen van't Hoff said :\n\" Just as in common life ;\nby a general\nimpression.\"\n\" Yet,\" I said, \" in common life there is stability of observa-\ntion and there is consolidation by repeated observation.\"\n\" Here also,\" said van't Hoff, \" And the sensation of\ncertainty is the same.\" Then I had indeed a very strong\nfeeling of certitude that it was really van't Hoff with whom\nI talked and no subjective illusion. Then I began to inquire\nagain about the clearness, the lucidity, the stability of this life\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 451\nof shades, and then T got the same hesitating, dubious, unsatis-\nfactory answer as from my brother. The whole atmosphere\nof the dream was happy, bright, elevated, and the persons\naround van't Hoff seemed sympathetic, though I did not know\nthem.\n\"It will be some time probably before I join you,\" I said.\nBut I took myself then for younger than I was.\nAfter that I had several common dreams of type (A), and\nI awoke quite refreshed, knowing my voice had not been\naudible in the waking world.\nIn May, 1903, I dreamed that I was in a little provincial\nDutch town and at once encountered my brother-in-law, who\nhad died some time before. I was absolutely sure that it\nwas he, and I knew that he was dead. He told me that\nhe had much intercourse with my \" controller,\" as he expressed\nit,\u2014my guiding spirit. I was glad, and our conversation was\nvery cordial, more intimate than ever in common life. He\ntold me that a financial catastrophe was impending for me.\nSomebody was going to rob me of a sum of 10,000 guilders.\nI said that I understood him, though after waking up I was\nutterly puzzled by it and could make nothing of it. My\nbrother-in-law said that my guiding spirit had told it to him.\nI told the story to somebody else in my dream. Then I\nasked my brother-in-law to tell me more of the after-life,\nand just as he was going to answer me I woke up,\u2014as if\nsomebody cut off the communication. I was not then as much\nused to prolonging my dreams as I am now.\nI wish to point out that this was the only prediction\nI ever received in a lucid dream in such an impressive way.\nAnd it came only too true, with this difference, that the sum\nI lost was twenty times greater. At the time of the dream\nthere seemed not to be the slightest probability of such a\ncatastrophe. I was not even in possession of the money I\nlost afterwards. Yet it was just the time when the first\nevents took place\u2014the railway strikes of 1903\u2014that led up\nto my financial ruin.\nPerhaps some of my audience will remember that I men-\ntioned in a paper read to the S.P.E. on April 19, 1901, my\ndream experiment with \" Nelly,\" the control of Mrs. Thompson.1\nBeing able to act voluntarily in my dreams, I had made up\n\f452 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [part\nmy mind to call people while dreaming. And I had succeeded\nsometimes in seeing my call answered and a figure appear,\ncorresponding to the person whom I had called. I had\narranged with Mr. Piddington that he should independently\nof me make notes during his sittings with Mrs. Thompson, and\ninform me of it when my name was mentioned. In January,\n1900, my call was twice answered, as I learnt by a letter\nfrom London, telling me that the \" control \" had heard it.\nAnd once when I called \" Elsie \" instead of \" Nelly,\" as I\nthought by mistake, \u2014the name \" Elsie \" being without meaning\nfor me, this mistake was heard and explained by Nelly. Later\nexperiments with Mrs. Thompson had no success. The next\nyear, however, I came into contact, through the introduction of\nW. T. Stead, with a very interesting medium, who, though\nquite ignorant of psychical matters, had suddenly obtained com-\nmunications through automatic script from a son who had\ndied not long before as a boy of ten years, and whom she\nhad loved passionately.\nThis boy, whose name was Gordon, I called several times\nin my dreams, and I saw him and described him to his\nmother, and I was able to explain to her several particulars\nwhich puzzled her very much. For instance, he told her that\nhe took part in her own suppers ; which did not at all corre-\nspond to her idea of the after-life. To me he appeared on\na bicycle, and when his mother asked him about that he\nanswered :\n\" Oh yes, I have got a byke now.\" To me, know-\ning how the mind may experience all sorts of subjective\nsensations and illusions, this was not so improbable as to her.\nOf course I was constantly seeking for what psychical\nresearchers call \" evidence,\" objective evidence. Therefore I\nasked the boy in my dream on August 13, 1901, for a pass-\nword. He complied with my wish and pronounced a word\nthat I understood as \" Sin-ga-poor.\" I supposed he meant the\nAsiatic town. His mother, however, got the explanation of\nthe word through automatic writing, a little later, though I\ncannot tell exactly at what date, but certainly after she was\ninformed of my dream. The boy told his mother that he\nhad said to me, \" Pick-a-boo,\" which was the word used by\nhim and his friends when they were hiding. This word and\n1\nSee Proceedings, Vol. XVII., pp. H'2-115.\n\fLxvir.] A Study of Dreams. 453\nits use were utterly unknown to me, and I think the corre-\nspondence of the two words is remarkable. Yet I admit that\nwe want more evidence, and several other experiments, e.g. with\nFrederic Myers and with W. T. Stead, were not successful.\nMr. Stead himself once gave me a little ring, telling me to\ncall the owner of it, whose name he gave me. I did so in\ndream and saw the person and got a message which I\nwrote to Stead. As I never received any answer I suppose\nit was a failure.\n1\nI have called and seen several deceased persons in lucid\ndreams. I called and saw Myers very shortly after his death,\nbut it was not convincing and the atmosphere was a little\ndismal. He seemed disappointed and sad. In July, 1908, I\ncalled and saw him again, very distinctly and certainly this\ntime. I asked him to tell Piddington that he had seen me.\nHe tried to give me a pass-word, but he could not, as if he\nwere too weak. I have successfully called my father and\ndifferent deceased friends and relations. William Stead I\nhave so far called in vain. Twice I saw, without having\ncalled for him, a deceased man, for whom hitherto I had had\nvery little sympathy : King Leopold of Belgium. He seemed\nto take great interest in me and my work, which seems to\nme still very improbable.\nI hope it will be clearly understood that I do not at all\npresume to pronounce with any certainty as to the genuine\ncharacter of these apparitions. I myself felt certainty in my\ndream ;\nyet I cannot expect others to accept it on my word,\nand doubt conies to myself often enough.\nThis sensation of certainty that it is the real person is\nindescribable and of course not communicable. Once I saw\nthe face of my father, exactly as I had known him, and yet\nI knew it was a deceit by a demon. I had not for one\nmoment the feeling that it was the real person. He asked\nme :\n\" Am I not exactly like myself ?\n\" and I had to confess\nthat the likeness was perfect ;\nyet I denied positively that\nit was my father. This was a demon-dream of type (F).\nIn two cases, when I was calling a deceased friend in vain,\nI saw the apparition of a postman coming,\u2014a letter-carrier,\n1\nRecent information seems to show that it was not a failure. I hope to give\nmore particulars of this case later.\n\f454 Dr. FrederiJc van Eeden. [part\nwho walked round me. As this occurred twice in different\nyears, it might have some symbolic meaning, though I cannot\nmake out what.\nNow, whether these apparitions are genuine or not, I think\nI am scientifically justified in making experiments as if they\nwere so, accepting it for the moment as a working hypothesis.\nOnly hundreds of observations will bring an approach to\ncertainty.\nJust as there was deceit in the apparition of my father,\nso there may be deceit in the lucid dream itself. In March,\n1912, I had a very complicated dream, in which I dreamt\nthat Theodore Koosevelt was dead, then that I woke up and\ntold the dream, saying :\n\" I was not sure in my dream whether\nhe was really dead or still alive ; now I know that he is\nreally dead ; but I was so struck by the news that I lost\nmy memory.\" And then came a false lucidity in which I\nsaid :\n\" Now I know that I dream and where I am.\" But\nthis was all wrong ; 1 had no idea of my real condition, and\nonly slowly, after waking up, I realised that it was all\nnonsense.\nTins sort of mockery I call demoniacal. And there is a\nconnection, which I observed so frecpiently that it must have\nsome significance,\u2014namely, that a lucid dream is immediately\nfollowed by a demon-dream, of type (F).\nI hope you allow me, if only for convenience' sake, to\nspeak as if these intelligences of a low moral order exist.\nLet me call it also a working hypothesis. Then I wish to\npoint out to you the difference between the symbolic or\nmocking dreams, of type (C), and the demon-dreams of type\n(F).\nIn type (C) the sleeper is teased or puzzled or harassed\nby various more or less weird, uncanny, obscene, lugubrious or\ndiabolical inventions. He has to walk in slaughter-houses\nor among corpses ; he finds everything besmeared with blood\nor excrement ; he is drawn into obscene, erotic or horrible\nscenes, in which he even takes an active part. His moral\ncondition is utterly depraved ; lie is a murderer, an adulterer,\netc. ; in a word, nothing is too low or too horrible for such\ndreams.\nAfter waking up the effect is, of course, unpleasant ; he\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 455\nis more or less ashamed and shocked ; he tries to shake off\nthe memory as soon as possible.\nNow in type (F)\u2014the demon-dreams\u2014which are always\nvery near, before or after, the lucid dreams, type (K)\u2014\nundergo similar attacks ; but I see the forms, the figures, the\npersonalities of strange non-human beings, who are doing it.\nOne night, for instance, I saw such a being, going before me\nand soiling everything he touched, such as door-handles and chairs.\nThese beings are always obscene and lascivious, and try to\ndraw me into their acts and doings. They have no sex\nand appear alternately as a man, or a woman. Their\naspect is very various and variable, changing every moment,\ntaking all the fantastic forms that the old painters of\nthe Middle Ages tried to reproduce, but with a certain\nweird plasticity and variability, that no painting can express.\nI will describe one instance of these dreams (March 30,\n1907, in Berlin), following immediately after a lucid dream.\nThe lucidity had not been very intense, and I had some\ndoubts about my real condition. Then all at once I was in the\nmiddle of demons. Never before had I seen them so distinct,\nso impertinent, so aggressive. One was slippery, shining, limp\nand cold;\nlike a living corpse. Another changed its face\nrepeatedly and made the most incredible grimaces. One flew\nunderneath me shouting an obscenity with a curious slang-\nword. I defended myself energetically, but principally with\ninvectives, which I felt to be a weakness. I saw the words\nwritten.\nThe circle of demons was close to me and grinning; like a\nmob of brutal street-boys. I was not afraid, however, and\nsaid :\n\" Even if you conquer me, if God wills it I do not\nfear.\" Then they all cried together like a rabble, and one\nsaid :\n\" Let God then speak first\n!\n\" Then I thundered with\nall my might :\n\" He hak spoken long since\n!\n\" And then I\npointed at one of them, saying :\n\" You I know for a long\ntime !\n\" and then pointing to another :\n\" And you !\n\"\nThen I awoke at once, and I believe I made some audible\nsound in waking up in the middle of my apostrophe.\nAnd then\u2014this will astonish you most\u2014after this dispute I\nfelt thoroughly refreshed, cheered up and entirely serene and calm.\nThis is the principal difference from type (C), that in\n2g\n\f456 J)r. Frederik van Eeden. [part\ntype (F), when I sec the demons and fight them, the effect\nis thoroughly pleasing, refreshing and uplifting.\nI may take it for granted that the majority of psychologists,\nreading the description of such a vivid dream, would feel\nabsolutely sure that there was something the matter with my\nbody,\u2014some indigestion, some oppression or the like. As a\nmatter of fact my physical health was perfect, my doubts\nwere only moral, and the effect of this nightmare, which had\nnone of the real anguish of a nightmare, was pleasant, beneficial\nand refreshing.\nThis is the principal point in these demon-dreams,\u2014that,\nwhether these beings have a real existence or whether they\nare only creations of my fancy, to see them and to fight\nthem takes away all their terror, all the uncanniness, the\nweirdness, of their tricks and pranks.\nI have not yet spoken about type (G), which I call \" wrong\nwaking up,\" occurring always near awakening. Of this sort\nof dream I found an excellent instance described by Mach, in\nhis Analyse eler Empfindungen, p. 130. He calls it \" Phan-\ntasma.\" We have the sensation of waking up in our ordinary\nsleeping-room and then we begin to realise that there is\nsomething uncanny around us ; we see inexplicable movements\nor hear strange noises, and then we know that we are still\nasleep. In my first experience of this dream I was rather\nafraid and wanted nervously to wake up really. 1 think this\nis the case with most people who have it. They become\nfrightened and nervous, and at last wake up with palpitations,\na sweating; brow and so on.\nTo me now these wrong-waking-up-dreains have lost their\nterror. I consider them as demon-pranks, and they amuse me;\nthey do not tell on my nerves any more.\nIn July, 1906, sleeping at Langen Schwalbach, a deep sleep\nafter a laborious day, I had two or three dreams of the type\n(G). I seemed to wake up and heard a big luggage-box being\nMown along the landing, with a tremendous bumping. Then I\nrealised that I had awakened in the demon-sphere. The second\ntime I saw that my sleeping-room had three windows, though\nI knew there were only two. Wishing to make sure, I woke\nup for a moment voluntarily and realised that my room had two\nwindows and that stillness had reigned in the house all night.\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 457\nAfter that I had a succession of lucid dreams, very beautiful.\nAt the end of them, while I was still singing loudly, I was\nsuddenly surrounded by many demons, who joined in my\nsinging, like a mob of vicious semi-savage creatures. Then I\nfelt that I was losing my self-control. I began to act more\nand more extravagantly, to throw my bedclothes and my\npillows about, and so on. I drew myself up and saw one\ndemon who had a less vicious look than the others and he\nlooked as if he were saying \" You are going wrong.\" \" Yes,\"\nI said, \" but what shall I do ?\n\" Then he said, \" Give them\nthe whip, on their naked backs.\" And I thought of Dante's\nshades, who also feared the whip. I at once made\u2014created\u2014\nwhip of leathern strings, with leaden balls at the end. And\nI threatened them with it and also struck at them a few\ntimes. Then suddenly all grew perfectly quiet around me,\nand I saw the creatures sneaking away with hypocritical faces,\nas if they knew nothing about it at all.\nI had many more adventures that night, lucid and common\ndreams, and I awoke fresh and cheerful, better in spirits than\nI had been for a long time.\nThis wrong-waking-up, type (G), is not to be confused with\nthe dreams related on p. 449, in which I dreamt that I\nwoke after a lucid dream and told that dream to some listener.\nThose dreams were of the common sort (A). There was nothing\nuncanny about them. Dreams of Class (Gr) are undoubtedly\ndemoniacal, uncanny, and very vivid and bright, with a sort\nof ominous sharpness and clearness, a strong diabolical light.\nMoreover the mind of the sleeper is aware that it is a dream,\nand a bad one, and he struggles to wake up. As I said just\nnow, however, the terror ends as soon as the demons are\nseen\u2014as soon as the sleeper realises that he must be the\ndupe of intelligences of a low moral order. I am prepared\nto hear myself accused of superstition, of reviving the dark\nerrors of the Middle Ages. Well, I only try to tell the facts\nas clearly as possible and I cannot do it without using these\nterms and ideas. If anybody will replace them by others, I\nam open to any suggestion. Only I would maintain that it\nis not my mind that is responsible for all the horrors and\nerrors of dream-life. To say that nobody is responsible for\nthem will not do, for there is absolute evidence in them of\n\f458 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [part\nsome thought and intention, however depraved and low. A trick,\na deceit, a symbol, cannot be without some sort of thought\nand intention. To put it all down to \" unconsciousness \" is\nvery convenient ; but then I say that it is just as scientific\nto use the names Beelzebub, or Belial. I, for one, do not\nbelieve in \" unconsciousness \"\nany more than in Santa Claus.\nFinally, I must say a few words about class (I), what I call\npathological dreams. I know that psychologists of a certain\nclass will call all dreams more or less pathological, and those\nthat I have described most emphatically so. And I should\nnot wonder, knowing some of their ways of argumentation, if\nthey were to bring forward those very dreams as evidence\nthat my health is by no means so good as I maintain it\nto be.\nI can only say that I believe, on the contrary, that this\ndream-life has saved me from loss of nervous or mental\nequilibrium in periods of terrible strain. Those who know\nwhat I have \"one through often wonder that I did not\nbecome a neurasthenic. I ascribe my freshness after severe\nlabour and difficulties to a great extent to the relaxing and\nrefreshing effect of these lucid dreams. As to true pathological\ndreams under the influence of fever, indigestion, morphia, or\nother drugs, I have very little experience. I remember, how-\never, quite well that they show a strongly demoniacal\ncharacter. They may be similar to several other forms\ndescribed in my Table, except type (E). But all of them\nare more confused, weird, vivid and vicious.\nThe remark may be made that in introducing intelligent\nbeings of a low order to explain these phenomena, an element\nof arbitrariness is brought in, which excludes the possibility\nof finding a scientific order. It is, for instance, convenient\nto ascribe all the phenomena of insanity and of pathological\ndreams to demons, who make use of the weakness of the\nbody to play their tricks. This is, in fact, the opinion of\nno less a man than Alfred Hussel Wallace, as he freely 'con-\nfessed to me in a personal conversation.\nI do not think, however, that even this idea, taken as a\nworking hypothesis, will prevent us from trying to find a\nscientific order even in these apparently demoniacal tricks\nthe fact, for instance, that certain drugs bring about halluci-\n\flxvii.] A Study of Dreams. 459\nnations of a well-defined kind ; that cocaine produces delicious\nexpectations and pleasant dreams, and alcohol causes visions\nof small white animals. This suggests that there must he\nsome order behind it, which is not purely arbitrary.\nWe are here, however, on the borders of a realm of\nmystery where we have to advance very carefully. To deny\nmay be just as dangerous and misleading as to accept.\nI should like to close this all too brief and imperfect sketch\nwith a few reflections\u2014a few philosophical remarks.\nWhen we see certain objects, say the blue sky, we have\nlearned to explain this phenomenon by an infinitely complicated\nprocess. To bring about this simple fact, the perception of a\nblue sky, we require not less than trillions of vibrations of\nthe most subtle kind, coming from the sun, and striking an\ninstrument so wonderfully elaborate and fine as our retinas and\nthe optic nerves.\nAnd now, during sleep, the same phenomenon is repeated,\nexactly repeated. When I see the blue sky in a lucid dream,\nI see it as clearly, as brightly, as consciously as I now see this\npaper. Pray, what is the difference ? Are these trillions of\nvibrations and the wonderful machinery of the retinas not\nwanted ? How is this second image then created ?\nPsychologists speak of \" hallucinations,\" of \" cliche-souvenirs,\"\nof \" imaginary objects,\" and so on. But these are all empty\nwords. We have two phenomena exactly alike. For one we\naccept causes endlessly subtle, elaborate and complicated. For\nthe other we simply use a word :\n\" Hallucination.\" The retina\nis not functioning, the light does not penetrate to it ;\nyet\nthe phenomenon is repeated in a perfectly complete manner.\nWho performs this miracle ? It seems to me a mockery\nof our physical science. After years of painful study the\nlaws of light and colour, and the mechanics of the nervous\nsystem were discovered to account for the phenomenon : the\nsight of a blue sky. And yet there it is again without aether-\nvibrations, without ocular action ; there it is, perfect, vivid,\nclear, well-observed. Unstable, you will say, and vanishing.\nBut so are all phenomena. Only the order of changing is\ndifferent ; the momentary fact is the same. I will not here\nattempt to deduce any conclusion from this ; I simply wish to\npoint out what so many men of science seem to forget. We\n\f460 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [part\nhear Freud's triumphant assertion that all dream-life is now\nexplained. Mach says :\n\" Die Sonderbarkeiten des Traums\nlassen sich alle darauf zuruckfiihren, dass manche Empfindungen\nund Vorstellungen gar nicht, andere zu schwer und zu spat ins\nBewusstsein treten.\"\nYou hear it ;\nall mystery is now explained by these few\nempty words. Did you ever see such things as \" sensations\nor \"representations\" \"walking into consciousness\" as if they were\ntourists and \" consciousness \" a hotel ? These are all words,\nwords, words,\u2014bare verbiage ; no concrete reality can be\nattached to such an explanation. It is against this scientific\narrogance that I utter a warning. No theory has as yet\nexplained all about dreams ; no ! not even more than the\ntiniest part. We have not yet crossed the threshold of that\nworld, which for us is still \" occult.\"\nAnd yet we desire to know. We are thinking beings ; we\nare proud of doing nothing without forethought. We wish to\nlook before us. And what is the only absolute certainty before\nus ? Bodily death ;\ncomplete material destruction. And if I\nhad to believe that this meant destruction of my mind ; if\nto-morrow should mean annihilation of myself,\u2014that is, every-\nthing of which I have knowledge ;\n\u2014well, what would to-morrow\nbe for me ? Why should I, as a reasonable being, toil and\nwork and suffer any longer ? It would be absurd, a foolish-\nness !\nThe twentieth century has begun with many an enlighten-\nment, \" auf klarung \" in all directions. Men of science have\nbeen severely reminded that they had been creating illusions\ninstead of following truth ; that they had been indulging in\nverbiage and rhetoric, where they were pretending to build up\neternal systems.\nThe ideas of a clever thinker like Bergson are not so very\nwonderful in themselves ; but the way he expresses them and\nthe fact that he is gaining wide authority is remarkable and\nwonderful. He reminded psychologists that memory could not\nbe matter, and that the brain could not be a store-house of\n\"cliche-souvenirs.\" Psychologists could not contradict this; they\nknow the fact now ; but do they grasp its significance ?\nIf memory is not brain, then brain can be destroyed without\ndestroying memory. If psychical facts and not material facts are\n\fLXVII.] A Study of Dreams. 4-61\nthe primary facts, then the psyche is more persistent than matter.\nAnd if matter is indestructible, then mind and memory are\nstill more so. That is to say, my memory and yours,\u2014not\nsomebody else's memory. \/, myself, must persist. But how ?\nI have a rational certainty of immortality ; I know that I,\nmy own self, my memory, is indestructible ; but the tremendous\nquestion is, what am I to expect ? How will it be ?\nNo existing religion can give a satisfactory answer, no\nphilosophy even. For I know, as a psychologist, that there\nis no religion that has not been the dupe of illusions, and no\nphilosophy that has not been the dupe of language, and of want\nof significal insight.\nWe want facts, certitude, investigation along lines of experi-\nence, of real concrete things. No premature theories, no verbal\nstructures, no amount of scholarly learning without deep insight\nwill satisfy us.\nAnd once more it must be repeated that facts are not the\nless concrete and real because they are purely psychical facts,\nand cannot yet be made to fit into any existing orderly system.\n\f462 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\nDelivered on May 28th, 1913.\nBy Professor HENRI BERGSON.\nMesdambs, Messieurs,\nLaissez-moi d'abord vous dire combien je vous suis\nreconnaissant du grand honneur que vous m'avez fait en\nm'appelant a la presidence de votre Societe. Get honneur, j'ai\nconscience de n'avoir rien fait pour le m^riter. Je ne connais\nque par des lectures les phenomenes dont la Societe s'occupe\nje n'ai rien vu, rien observe moi-meme. Comment alors avez-\nvous pu venir me prendre, pour me faire succeder aux grands\nsavants, aux penseurs eminents qui ont occupe tour a tour le\nfauteuil presidentiel et dont la plupart etaient, en menie temps\nque des homines auxquels leur science et leur talent avaient\nvalu une notoriete universelle, des esprits particulierement pr6-\noccupes de l'etude de ces phenomenes mysterieux ? Si j'osais\nplaisanter sur un pareil sujet, je dirais qu'il y a eu ici un\neffet de telepathie ou de clairvoyance, que vous avez senti\nde loin l'interet que je prenais a vos recherches, et que vous\nm'avez apergu, k travers les quatre cents kilometres qui nous\nseparaient, lisant attentivement vos comptes-rendus, suivant vos\ntravaux avec une ardente curiosite. Ce que vous avez depense\nd'ingeniosite, de penetration, de patience, de tenacite, a l'ex-\nploration de la terra incognita, des phenomenes psychiques me\nparait en effet admirable. Mais, plus encore que cette ingeniosite\net plus que cette penetration, plus que l'inlassable perseverance\navec laquelle vous avez poursuivi votre route, j'admire le\ncourage qu'il vous a fallu pendant les premieres annees surtout,\n\flxvii.] Presidential Address. 463\npour hitter contre les preventions d'une bonne partie du\nmonde savant et pour braver la raillerie, qui fait peur aux\nplus intrepides. C'est pourquoi je suis Her \u2014 plus tier que\nje ne saurais le dire \u2014 d'avoir ete elu president de la Societe\nde recherche psychique. J'ai lu quelque part l'histoire d'un\nofficier subalterne que les hasards de la bataille, la disparition\nde ses chefs tues ou blesses, avaient appele a rhonneur de\ncommander le regiment : toute sa vie il\ny pensa, toute sa vie\nil en parla, et du souvenir de ces quelques heures son existence\nentiere restait impregnee. Je suis cet officier subalterne, et\ntoujours je me feliciterai de la chance inattendue qui m'aura\nmis \u2014 non pas pour quelques heures, mais pour quelques mois\n\u2014 a la tete d'un regiment de braves.\nD'ou viennent les preventions qu'on a eues pendant long-\ntemps, et que quelques-uns conservent encore, k legard des\netudes psychiques ? Comment expliquer que des savants, qui\ntrouvent tout naturel qu'on poursuive sous leur direction des\ntravaux de laboratoire en apparence insignifiants, qui pensent,\nnon sans raison, qu'il n'y a rien d'insignifiant pour la science,\ntemoignent une telle repugnance pour des recherches conune les\nvdtres, hesitent meme a y voir des recherches scientifiques ?\nC'est le point dont je voudrais dire un mot d'abord. Loin de\nmoi la pensee de critiquer leur critique pour le plaisir de faire\nde la critique a mon tour. J'estime que le temps consacre a\nla refutation, en philosophie, est generalement du temps perdu.\nDe tant d'attaques dirigees par taut de penseurs les uns contre\nles autres, que reste-t-il ? rien, ou peu de chose. Ce qui\ncompte et ce qui demeure, c'est ce qu'on a apporte de verite\npositive : 1'affirmation vraie se substitue d'elle-meme a l'idee\nfausse et se trouve etre, sans qu'on ait pris la peine de\nrefuter personne, la meilleure des refutations. Mais il s'agit de\nbien autre chose ici que de refuter ou de critiquer. Je voudrais\nmontrer que derriere les preventions des uns, les railleries\ndes autres, il y a, invisible et presente, une certaine metaphysique\ninconsciente d'elle-meme, \u2014 inconsciente et par consequent incon-\nsistante, inconsciente et par consequent incapable de se remodeler\nsans cesse, conime doit le faire une philosophie digne de ce nom,\nsur l'observation et l'experience, \u2014 que d'ailleurs cette metaphy-\nsique est naturelle, qu'elle tient a un pli contracte depuis long-\ntemps par l'esprit humain, et que des lors nous avons tout\n\f464 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\ninteret a aller la chercher derriere les critiques on les railleries\nqui la cachent, afin de nous mettre en garde contre elle : nous\neviterons ainsi quelle agisse sur nous a notre tour et quelle\ndresse sur notre route des obstacles artiliciels. Mais, avant\nd'aborder cette question, qui concerne Fobjet meme de vos\netudes, je voudrais dire un mot de la methode que vous suivez,\nmethode dont je comprends tres bien qu'elle deroute un certain\nnombre de savants.\nEien n'est plus desagreable au savant de profession que de\nvoir appliquer a une science de meme ordre que la sienne\nune methode reservee d'ordinaire a des objets tout differents.\nII tient a ses procedes comme l'ouvrier a ses outils : c'est\nWilliam James, je crois, qui a defini la difference entre le\nprofessionuel et 1'amateur en disant que celui-ci s'interesse\nsurtout au resultat obtenu, et celui-la a la maniere dont on\n1'obtient. Or, les' phenomenes dont vous vous occupez sont\nincontestablement du meme genre que ceux qui font l'objet\nde la science naturelle, tandis que la methode que vous\nsuivez, et que vous etes obliges de suivre, n'a souvent aucun\nrapport avec celle des sciences de la nature.\nJe dis que ce sont des faits du meme genre. J'entends par\nla qu'ils manifestent surement des lois, et qu'ils sont sus-\nceptibles, eux aussi, de se repeter indefiniment dans le temps\net dans l'espace. Ce ne sont pas des faits comme ceux\ndont s'occupe l'historien, par exemple. L'histoire, elle, ne se\nrecommence pas; la bataille d'Austerlitz s'est livree une fois,\net ne se livrera jamais plus. Les memes conditions historiques\nne pouvant se reproduire, le meme fait historique ne saurait\nse repeter ; et comme une loi exprime necessairement qua\ncertaines causes, toujours les memes, correspondra un effet\ntoujours le meme aussi, l'histoire proprement dite ne porte pas\nsur des lois, mais sur des faits particuliers et sur les circon-\nstances, non moins particulieres, oil ils se sont accomplis.\nL'unique question, ici, est de savoir si levenement a bien eu\nlieu a tel moment determine du temps, en tel point determine\nde l'espace, et comment il s'est produit. Au contraire, une\nhallucination veridique, \u2014 l'apparition, par exemple, d'un homme\nqui meurt h un parent ou a un ami qui peut etre separe\nde lui par des centaines de kilometres, \u2014 est un fait qui, s'il\nest reel, est sans doute la manifestation d'une loi analogue\n\fLXVII.] Presiden tia I Address. 465\naux lois physiques, chimiques, biologiques. Je suppose, un\ninstant, que ce phenomene soit dii a une influence exercee,\na travers l'espace, par la conscience de l'une des deux\npersonnes sur la conscience de l'autre ;\nje suppose, en\nd'autres termes, que deux consciences humaines puissent com-\nmuniquer ensemble sans interme'diaire visible et qu'il y ait,\ncomme vous dites, \" telepathie.\" Si la telepathie est un fait\nreel, c'est un fait susceptible de se repeter indefiniment. Je\nvais plus loin : si la telepathie est un fait reel, il est fort\npossible quelle opere a chaque instant et chez tout le raonde,\nmais avec trop peu d'intensite pour se faire remarquer, ou en\npresence d'obstacles qui neutralisent l'effet au moment meme\nou il va se manifester. Nous produisons de l'electricite a\ntout moment, l'atmosphere est constamment electrisee, nous\ncirculons parmi des courants magnetiques ; et pourtant des\nmillions d'hommes ont vecu pendant des milliers d'annees\nsans soupconner l'existence de l'electricite. II pourrait en etre\nde meme de la telepathie. Mais peu importe. Un point est\nen tous cas incontestable, c'est que, si la telepathie est reelle,\nelle est naturelle, et que, le jour ou nous en connaitrions les\nconditions, il ne nous serait pas plus necessaire, pour obtenir\nun effet telepathique, d'attendre une hallucination vraie, que\nnous n'avons besoin aujourd'hui, quand nous voulons voir l'etin-\ncelle electrique, d'attendre que le ciel veuille bien nous en\ndonner le spectacle pendant une scene d'orage.\nVoila done un phenomene qui semblerait, en raison de sa\nnature, devoir etre etudie a la maniere du fait physique,\nchimique, ou biologique. Mais pas du tout : vous etes\nobliges de l'aborder avec une methode toute differente, qui\ntient le milieu entre celle de l'historien et celle du juge\nd'instruction. L'hallucination veridique remoute-t-elle au passe ?\nvous etudiez les documents, vous les critiquez, vous ecrivez\nune page d'histoire. Le fait est-il d'hier ? vous procedez a\nune espece d'enquete judiciaire ; vous vous mettez en rapport\navec les temoins, vous les eonfrontez entre eux et vous con-\ntrolez la valeur de leur temoignage. Pour ma part, quand\nje repasse dans ma memoire les resultats de l'admirable enquete\npoursuivie continuellement par vous pendant plus de trente\nar.s, quand je pense a toutes les precautions que vous avez\nprises pour eviter l'erreur, quand je vois comment, dans la\n\f466 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nplupart cles cas que vous avez retenus, le recit de l'halluci-\nnation avait etc fait a une ou plusieurs personnes, souvent\nmeme note par ecrit, avant que l'hallucination eiit etc\nreconnue veridique, quand je tiens corapte du nombre enorrne\ndes faits et surtout de leur ressemblance entre eux, de leur\nair de famille, de la concordance de tant de temoignages\nindependants les uns des autres, tous examines, controles,\nsoumis a la critique, \u2014je suis porte a croire a la telepathie\nde meme que je crois, par exemple, a la defaite de l'ln-\nvincible Armada. Ce n'est pas la certitude mathematique\nque me donne la demonstration du theoreme de Pythagore ; ce\nn'est pas la certitude physique ou je suis de la verite de\nla loi de la chute des corps ; e'est du moins toute la certitude\nqu'on obtient en matiere historique ou judiciaire.\nMais voila justement ce qui deconcerte un assez grand nombre\nd'esprits. Us trouvent etrange qu'on ait a traiter historique-\nment ou judiciairement des faits qui, s'ils sont reels, obeissent\nsurement a des lois et devraient alors, semble-t-il, se preter\naux methodes d'observation et d'experimentation usitees dans\nles sciences de la nature. Dressez le fait a se produire dans\nun laboratoire, on l'accueillera volontiers; jusque-la, on le tiendra\npour suspect. De ce que la \" recherche psychique \" ne peut\npas, pour le moment, proceder comme la physique et la cbimie,\non conclut qu'elle n'est pas scientifique ; et comme le \" fait\npsychique \" n'a pas encore pris cette forme simple et abstraite\nqui ouvre a un fait l'acces du laboratoire, volontiers on le\ndeclarerait irrcel. Tel est, je crois, le raisonnement \" subcon-\nscient \" d'un certain nombre de savants.\nJe retrouve le meme sentiment, le meme dedain du concret,\nau fond des objections qu'on eleve contre telle ou telle de\nvos conclusions. Je n'en citerai qu'un exemple. 11 y a\nquelque temps, dans une reunion mondaine a laquelle j'assis-\ntais, la conversation tomba sur les phenomenes dont votre\nSociete s'occupe, et plus particulierement sur les faits de\ntelepathie. Un de nos grands medecins etait la, qui est aussi\nun de nos grands savants. Apres avoir ecoute attentivement\npendant quelques minutes, il prit la parole, et s'exprima a\npeu pres en ces termes :\n\" Tout ce que vous dites la m'interesse\nbeaucoup, mais je vous demande de reflechir avant de tirer\nune conclusion. Je connais, moi aussi, un fait extraordinaire.\n\fLXVII.] Presidential Address. 467\nEt ce fait, j'en garantis l'authenticite, car il m'a ete raconte\npar une dame fort intelligente, dont la parole m'inspire une\nconfiance absolue. Le mari de cette dame etait ofticier. II\nfut tue au cours d'un engagement. Or, au moment raeme\non le mari tombait, la femme eut la vision de la scene, vision\nprecise, de tous points conforme k la realite. Vous conclurez\npeut-etre de la, comme cette dame, qu'il y avait eu clairvoyance\nou telepathie ? ... Vous n'oublierez qu'une chose : c'est qu'il\nest arrive bien des fois qu'une femme revat que son mari etait\nmort ou mourant, alors qu'il se portait fort bien. On remarque\nles cas ou la vision tombe juste, on ne tient pas compte des\nautres. Si Ton faisait le releve, on verrait que la coincidence\nest l'oeuvre du simple hasard.\"\nLa conversation devia dans je ne sais plus quelle direction\nil ne pouvait d'ailleurs etre question d'entamer une discussion\nserieuse ; ce n'etait ni le lieu ni le moment. Mais, en sortant\nde table, une tres jeune fille, qui avait bien ecoute, vint me\ndire :\n\" II me semble que le docteur X . . . raisonnait mal tout-\na-l'heure. Je ne vois pas ou est le vice de son raisonnement\nmais il doit y avoir un vice.\" Eh oui, il y avait un vice\nC'est la petite jeune fille qui avait raison, et c'est le grand\nsavant qui avait tort. II fermait les yeux k ce que le phenomene\navait de concret. II raisonnait ainsi :\n\" Quand on reve qu'un\nparent est mort ou mourant, ou c'est vrai ou c'est faux, ou\nla personne meurt effectivement ou elle ne meurt pas. Et\npar consequent, si le reve tombe juste, il faudrait, pour etre\nsur qu'il n'y a pas la un effet du hasard, avoir compare le\nnombre des cas ou Ton s'est trouve dans le vrai au nombre\ndes cas ou Ton a ete dans le faux.\" II ne voyait pas que\nla force apparente de son argumentation tenait ;i ce qu'il\navait remplace la description de la scene concrete et vivante,\n\u2014 de l'officier tombant k un moment determine, en un lieu\ndetermine, avec tels ou tels soldats autour de lui, \u2014 par\ncette formule abstraite et morte :\n\" La dame, en revant, etait\ndans le vrai, et non pas dans le faux.\" Ah, si nous acceptons\ncette transposition dans l'abstrait, il faudra en effet que nous\ncomparions in abstracto le nombre des cas vrais au nombre\ndes cas faux ; et nous trouverons peut-etre qu'il y en a plus\nde faux que de vrais, et notre docteur aura eu raison. Mais\ncette abstraction consiste a negliger ce qu'il y a d'essentiel \u2014\n\f468 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nle tableau apercu par la dame, et qui se trouve etre identique\na une scene tres eloignee d'elle. Concevez-vous qu'un peintre,\ndessinant sur sa toile un coin de bataille, et se fiant pour\ncela a sa fantaisie, puisse etre si bien servi par le hasard qu'il\nse trouve avoir fait le portrait de soldats reels, reellement\npresents ce jour-la a une bataille on ils prenaient les\nattitudes que le peintre leur prete ? Evidemment non. La\nsupputation des probabilities, a laquelle on fait appel ici, nous\nmontrerait que c'est impossible, parce qu'une scene on des\npersonnes determinees prennent des attitudes determiners est\nchose unique en son genre, parce qu'un visage humain, meme\nisole\\ est deja unique en son genre, et que par consequent chaque\npersonnage \u2014 k plus forte raison la scene qui les reunit \u2014 est\ndecomposable en une infinite de details independants les uns\ndes autres : de sorte qu'il faudrait un nombre de coincidences\ninfini pour que le hasard fit de la scene de fantaisie la repro-\nduction exacte d'une scene reelle: en d'autres termes, il est\nmathematiquement impossible qu'un tableau sorti de l'imagina-\ntion du peintre dessine exactement un coin de bataille tel\nqu'il est. Or, la dame qui avait la vision d'un coin de bataille\netait dans la situation de ce peintre ; son imagination executait\nun tableau. Si le tableau etait la reproduction d'une scene\nreelle, il fallait, de toute necessite, quelle fut en communication\navec cette scene ou avec une conscience qui en avait la per-\nception. Je n'ai que faire de la comparaison du nombre des\n\" cas vrais \" a celui des \" cas faux \" ; la statistique n'a rien h\nvoir ici ; le cas unique qu'on me presente me sufht, du moment\nque je le retiens avec ce qu'il a de concret. C'est pourquoi,\nsi c'eut etc le moment de discuter avec le docteur, je lui aurais\ndit : \"Je ne sais si le recit qu'on vous a fait etait ridele\nj'ignore si la dame dont vous parlez a eu la vision exacte de\nla scene qui se deroulait loin d'elle ; mais si ce point m'&tait\ndemontre, si je pouvais seulement etre sur que la physionomie\nd'un soldat inconnu d'elle, present a la scene, lui est apparue\ntelle quelle etait en realite, \u2014 eh bien alors, quand meme il me\nserait prouve qu'il y a eu des milliers de visions fausses et\nquand meme il n'y aurait jamais eu d'autre hallucination veri-\ndique que celle-ci, je tiendrais pour rigoureusement et defini-\ntivement etablie l'existence de la telepathie ou d'une cause,\nquelle quelle soit, pouvant nous faire percevoir des objets et\n\flxvit.] Presidential Address. 469\ndes evenements situes hors de la portee normale de nos\nsens.\"\nMais en voila assez sur ce point. J'arrive a la cause profonde\nqui a retarde jusqu'ici le progres de la \" recherche psychique\n\"\nen dirigeant exclusivement d'un autre cote l'activite des savants.\nJ'ai entendu des personnes interessees a. vos travaux setonner\nque la science moderne ait si longtemps neglige les faits dont\nvous vous occupez, alors qu'elle devrait, en vertu de son carac-\ntere experimental, s'interesser a des recherches qui pourront\nsusciter plus tard une foule d'experiences nouvelles. Mais il\nfaudrait s'entendre sur ce qu'on appelle le caractere experi-\nmental de la science moderne. Que la science moderne ait cr6e\nla methode experimentale, c'est certain; mais cela ne veut pas\ndire qu'elle ait elargi le champ d'experiences qui existait avant\nelle. Bien an contraire, elle l'a souvent retreci ; et c'est la,\nd'ailleurs, ce qui a fait sa force. Quand nous lisons les ecrits des\nanciens, nous sommes frappes de voir combien ils avaient observe\net meme experiments. Mais ils observaient au hasard, dans\nn'importe quelle direction. En quoi consista la creation de la\n\" methode experimentale \" ? Simplement k prendre des proced\u00a3s\nd'observation et d'experimentation qui existaient deja, et, plutot\nque de les appliquer dans toutes les directions possibles, a\nles faire converger sur un seul point, la mesvre,-\u2014 la mesure\nde telle on telle grandeur variable dont on soupconnait qu'elle\npouvait etre fonction de telles ou telles autres grandeurs variables,\negalement k mesurer. La \" loi,\" au sens moderne du mot, est\njustement l'expression d'une relation constante entre des gran-\ndeurs qui varient. La science moderne est done fille des mathe -\nmatiques ; elle est nee le jour ou l'algebre eut acquis assez de\nforce et de souplesse pour pouvoir enlacer la realite, la prendre\ndans le filet de ses calculs. D'abord parurent l'astronomie et la\nmecanique, sous la forme essentiellement mathematique que les\nmodernes leur ont donnee. Puis se developpa la physique,\nune physique egalement mathematique. La physique suscita la\nchimie, elle aussi fondee sur des mesures, sur des comparaisons\nde poids et de volumes. Apres la chimie vint la biologie, qui,\nsans doute, n'a pas encore pris la forme mathematique et n'est\npas pres de la prendre, mais qui n'en cherche pas moins, par\nl'interm^diaire de la physiologie, a ramener les lois de la vie k\ncelles de la chimie et de la physique, e'est-a-dire, indirectement,\n\f470 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nde la mecanique. De sorte qu'en definitive notre science tend\ntoujours a la forme mathematique conime a un ideal : elle\nvise essentiellenient h mesurer, et la on le calcul n'est pas\nencore applicable, la ou elle doit se borner k une description\nou a une analyse de son objet, elle s'arrange pour n'envisager\nde cet objet que le cote capable de devenir un jour accessible\na la mesure.\nOr, il est de l'essence des choses de l'esprit de ne pas se\npreter a la mesure. Le premier mouvement de la science\nmoderne devait done etre de chercher si Ton ne pourrait pas\nsubstituer aux phenomenes de l'esprit des phenomenes qui en\nfussent les equivalents et qui seraient, eux, mesurables. De\nfait, nous voyons que la conscience est liee, d'une maniere ou\nd'une autre, a un cerveau. On s'empara done du cerveau,\non s'attacba au fait cerebral, \u2014 dont on ne connait certes pas\nla nature, mais dont on sait qu'il doit pouvoir se resoudre\nfinalement en mouvements de molecules et d'atomes, e'est-a-\ndire en faits relevant de la mecanique, \u2014 et Ton convint de\nconsieb'rer le cerebral conime l'equivalent du mental. Toute\nnotre science de l'esprit, toute notre rnetaphysique, depuis le\nxvne\nsiecle jusqua nos jours, est penetree de l'idee de\ncette equivalence. On parle indifferemment de la pensee ou\ndu cerveau, soit qu'on fasse du mental un simple \" epiphe-\nnomene \" du cerebral, conime le veut le materialisme, soit\nqu'on mette le mental et le cerebral sur la meme ligne en les\nconsiderant comme deux traductions, en langues differentes,\ndu meme original. Bref, l'hypothese d'un paralUlisme rigoureux\nentre le cerebral et le mental parait eminemment scientifique.\nD'instinct, la philosophic et la science tendent a ecarter ce\nqui contredirait cette hypothese ou ce qui serait mal com-\npatible avec elle. Et tel parait etre, a premiere vue, le cas\ndes faits qui relevent de la \" recherche psychique,\" \u2014 ou tout\nau moins le cas de bon nonibre d'entre eux.\nEh bien, le moment est venu de considerer de pres cette\nhypothese, et de voir ce quelle vaut. Je n'insisterai pas sur\nles difficultes, sur les absurdites theoriques qu'elle souleve.\nJ'ai montre ailleurs que, prise a la lettre, elle est contradictoire\navec elle-meme. J'ajoute que, primd facie, il est contraire\na toute vraisemblance que la nature se donne le luxe de\nrepeter purement et simplement en langage de conscience ce\n\fLXVII.] Presidential Address. 471\nque l'ecorce cerebrale accoraplit sous forme de mouvemeut\natomique ou moleculaire. Une conscience qui ne serait qu'un\nduplicatum, qui n'interviendrait pas activement, aurait sans\ndoute disparu depuis longtemps de l'univers, a supposer qu'elle\nse fut jamais produite : ne voyons-nons pas que nos actions\ntendent a devenir inconscientes an fur et a mesure que\nl'habitude les rend machinales ? Mais je ne veux pas in-\nsister sur ces considerations theoriques. Ce que je pretends,\nc'est que les faits, eonsultes sans parti pris, ne confirment ni\nraerae ne suggerent l'hypothese du parallelisme.\nPour une seule fonction de la pensee, en effet, l'experience\na pu faire croire qu'elle etait localisee en un certain point du\ncerveau : je veux parler de la memoire, et plus particuliere-\nment de la memoire des mots. Ni pour le jugement, ni pour\nle raisonnement, ni pour aucune autre faculte de la pensee\npropreuient dite nous n'avons la moindre raison de supposer\nqu'elle soit attachee k tels ou tels processus cerebraux deter-\nmines. Au contraire, les maladies de la memoire des mots \u2014\nou, comme on dit, les apbasies \u2014 correspondent a des lesions\ndeterminees de certaines circonvolutions cerebrales : de sorte\nqu'on a pu considerer la memoire comme localisee dans le\ncerveau, et les souvenirs visuels, auditifs, moteurs des mots\ncomme deposes a l'interieur de l'ecorce, \u2014 veritables cliches pho-\ntographiques qui conserveraient d'anciennes impressions lumi-\nneuses, veritables disques phonographiques qui enregistreraient\ndes vibrations sonores. En somme, si Ton examine de pres\ntous les faits allegues en faveur d'une exacte correspondance et\nd'une espece d'adh&rence de la vie mentale a la vie cerebrale\n(je laisse de cote, cela va sans dire, les sensations et les mouve-\nments, car le cerveau est certainement un organe sensori\nmoteur), on voit que ces faits se reduisent aux phenoinenes\nde memoire, et que c'est la localisation des aphasies, et cette\nlocalisation seule, qui semble apporter a la doctrine paralleliste\nun commencement de preuve experimentale.\nOr, une etude plus approfondie des diverses aphasies mon-\ntrerait precisement, a mon avis, l'impossibilite de considerer\nles souvenirs comme des cliches ou des phonogrammes deposes\ndans le cerveau, l'impossibilite d'admettre que ce soit reelle-\nment dans le cerveau que les souvenirs se conservent. Je ne\npuis entrer ici dans les details de la critique que j'ai faite\n2h\n\f472 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\nautrefois de l'interpretation courante des aphasies, critique qui\na pu paraitre paradoxale a l'epoque ou une certaine conception\nde l'aphasie etait acceptee comme un dogme, mais a laquelle\nl'anatomie pathologique elle-meme est venue, dans ces dernieres\nannees, apporter son concours (je fais allusion aux travaux du\nprofesseur Pierre Marie et de ses eleves). Je me bornerai\ndone a vous rappeler mes conclusions. Ce qui me parait se\ndegager de l'etude attentive des faits, e'est que les lesions ctke-\nbrales caracteristiques des diverses aphasies n'atteignent pas les\nsouvenirs eux-memes, et que par consequent il n'y a pas, emmaga-\nsines en tels ou tels points de lecoree cerebrale, des souvenirs\nque la maladie detruirait. Ces lesions rendent, en reality,\nimpossible ou difficile revocation des souvenirs ; elles portent\nsur le mecanisme du rappel, et sur ce mecanisme seulement.\nPlus precisement, le role du cerveau est ici de faire que l'esprit,\nquand il a besoin de tel ou tel souvenir, puisse obtenir du corps\nune certaine attitude ou certains mouvements naissants, qui\npresentent au souvenir cherche un cadre approprie. Si le cadre\nest la, le souvenir viendra, de lui-nieme, s'y inserer. L'organe\ncerebral prepare le cadre, il ne fournit pas le souvenir. Voila,\na moD sens, ce que montre une \u00a3tude attentive des maladies\nde la metnoire des mots, et ce que fait d'ailleurs pressentir\nl'analyse psychologique de la memoire en general.\nMais, si nous examinons maintenant les autres fonctions de\nla pensee, l'hypothese que les faits nous suggerent le plus\nnaturellement n'est pas du tout celle d'un paralledisme rigoureux\nentre la vie mentale et la vie c6r6brale. Bien au contrake,\ndans le travail de la pensee en general, comme dans l'opera-\ntion de la memoire, le cerveau nous apparart comme charge\nd'imprimer au corps les mouvements et les attitudes qui\njoumt ce que l'esprit pense ou ce que les circonstances l'invitent\na penser. C'est ce que j'ai expriine ailleurs en disant que le\ncerveau est un \" organe de pantomime.\" Et c'est pourquoi,\ncomme je l'ai dit ailleurs aussi, \" celui qui pourrait regarder a\nl'interieur d'un cerveau en pleine activite, suivre le va-et-\nvient des atomes et interpreter tout ce qu'ils font, celui-la\nsaurait sans doute quelque chose de ce qui se passe dans l'esprit,\nmais il n'en saurait que pen de chose.

Les phenomenes cerebraux sont en effet a la vie\nmentale ce que les gestes du chef d'orehestre sont a la sym-\nphonie : ils en dessinent les articulations motrices, ils ne font\npas autre chose. On ne trouverait done rien des operations\nde l'esprit proprement dit a l'interieur du cerveau. Le cerveau,\nen dehors de ses fonctions sensorielles, n'a d'autre role que de\nmimer la vie mentale.\nJe reconnais d'ailleurs que cette mimique est d'une impor-\ntance capitale. C'est par elle que nous nous inserons dans la\nrenlite, que nous nous y adaptons, que nous repondons aux\nsollicitations des circonstances par des actions approprie'es. Si\nla conscience n'est pas une fonction du cerveau, du moins le\ncerveau maintient-il la conscience fixee sur le monde ou nous\nvivons ; c'est l'organe de l'attention a la vie. Aussi une modifi-\ncation cer^brale meme legere, une d'intoxication passagere par\nl'alcool ou l'opium par exemple, \u2014 a plus forte raison une in-\ntoxication durable comme celles qui causent sans doute le plus\nsouvent l'alienation, \u2014 peuvent-elles entrainer une perturbation\ncomplete de la vie mentale. Ce n'est pas que l'esprit soit\natteint alors direetement. II ne faut pas croire, comme on le\nfait souvent, que le poison soit alle chercher dans l'ecorce cere-\nbrale tel ou tel mecanisme qui serait l'aspect materiel du\nraisonnement, qu'il ait derange ce mecanisme et epie ce soit\npour cela que le malade divague. Mais l'effet de la lesion est\nde fausser l'engrenage et de faire que la pensee ne s'insere plus\nexactement dans les choses. Un fou, atteint du delire de la\npersecution, pourra encore raisonner tres logiquement : mais il\nraisonne a cote de la realite', en dehors de la realite, comme\nnous raisonnons en reve. Orienter notre pensee vers Taction,\nl'amener ;i preparer l'acte que les circonstances reclament, voila\nce pour quoi notre cerveau est fait.\nMais par la il canalise, et par la aussi il limite, la vie de\nl'esprit. II nous empeche de jeter les yeux k droite et h\n\f474 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\ngauche et meme, autant que possible, en arriere ; il veut que\nnous regardions droit devant nous, dans la direction ou nous\navons a marcher. N'est-ce pas deja visible dans l'operation\nde la memoire, dont nous parlions tout-ad'heure ? Bien des\nfaits semblent indiquer que le passe se conserve jusque dans\nses moindres details et qu'il n'y a pas d'oubli reel. Vous\nvous rappelez ce qu'on raconte des noyes et des pendus qui,\nrevenus ;\\ la vie, declarent avoir en, en quelques secondes,\nla vision panoramique de la totalite de leur vie passee. Je\npourrais citer d'autres exemples, car l'asphyxie n'est pour rien\ndans le phenomene, quoi qu'on en ait dit. Un alpiniste\nglissant an fond d'un precipice, un soldat autour duquel s'abat\ntout a coup une grele de balles, auront parfois la meme vision.\nLa verite est que notre passe tout entier est la, continuelle-\nment, et que nous n'aurions qu'a nous retourner pour l'aper-\ncevoir ;\nseulement, nous ne pouvons ni ne devons nous retourner.\nNous ne le devons pas, parce que notre destination est de\nvivre, d'agir, et que la vie et Taction regardent en avant.\nNous ne le pouvons pas, parce que le mecanisme cerebral a\nprecisement pour role ici de nous masquer le passe, de n'en\nlaisser transparaitre, a chaque instant, que ce qui pent eclairer\nla situation pr6sente et favoriser notre action : c'est meme en\nobscurcissant la totalite de nos souvenirs \u2014 sauf celui qui\nnous interesse et que notre corps esquisse deja par sa\nmimique \u2014qu'il rappelh ce souvenir utile. Maintenant,\nque l'attention a, la vie vienne h faibler un instant, \u2014je\nne parle pas de l'attention volontaire, de celle qui depend\nde l'individu, mais d'une attention qui s'impose a l'homme\nnormal et qu'on pourrait appeler \"l'attention de l'espece,\" \u2014\nalors l'esprit, dont le regard dtait maintenu de force en avant,\nse detend et par la meme se retourne en arriere ; la totalite\nde son passe lui apparait. La vision panoramique du passe\nest done due a un brusque cUsintdrcssemmt de la vie, produit dans\ncertains cas par la menace d'une mort subite. Et e'etait k\nmaintenir l'attention fixee sur la vie, a retrecir utilement le\nchamp de la vision mentale, qu'etait occupe jusque-la le cerveau\nen tant qu'organe de memoire.\nMais ce que je dis de la memoire serai t aussi vrai de\nla perception. Je ne puis entrer ici dans le ddta.il d'une\ndemonstration que j'ai faite autrefois : qu'il me suffise de\n\fLXVIT.] Presidential Address. 475\nrappeler que tout devient obscur, et ineme incomprehensible,\nsi Ton eonsidere les centres cerebraux eomme des organes\ncapables de transformer en etats conscients des ebranle-\nments materiels, que tout s'eclaircit au contraire si Ton voit\nsimplement dans ces centres (et dans les dispositifs sensoriels\nauxquels ils sont lies) des instruments de selection charges de\nchoisir, dans le champ immense de nos perceptions virtuelles,\ncelles qui devront s'actualiser. Leibniz disait que chaque mo-\nnade, et par consequent, a fortiori, chacune de ces monades\nqu'il appelle des esprits, porte en elle la representation con-\nsciente ou inconsciente de la totalite des choses. Je n'irais\npas aussi loin ; mais j'estime (pie nous percevons virtuellement\nbeaucoup plus de choses que nous n'en percevons actuellement,\net qu'ici encore le role de notre corps est d'ecarter du champ\nde notre conscience tout ce qui ne nous serait d'aucun interet\npratique, tout ce qui ne se prete pas a notre action. Les\norganes des sens, les nerfs sensitifs, les centres cerebraux cana-\nlisent done les influences du dehors, et marquent ainsi les\ndiverses directions ou notre propre influence pourra s'exercer.\nMais, par la, ils retrecissent le champ de notre vision du pre-\nsent, de meme que les mecanismes cerebraux de la memoire\nlimitent notre vision du passe. Or, de meme (pie certains\nsouvenirs inutiles, ou souvenirs \" de reve,\" arrivent a se glisser\ndans le champ de la conscience, profitant d'un moment\nd'inattention k la vie, ne pourrait-il pas y avoir, autour\nde notre perception normale, une frange de perceptions le\nplus souvent inconscientes, mais toutes pretes a entrer\ndans la conscience, et s'y introduisant en effet dans certains\ncas exceptionnels ou chez certains sujets predisposes ? S'il y\na des perceptions de ce genre, elles ne relevent pas seulement\nde la psyehologie proprement dite ; elles sont de celles sur\nlesquelles la \" recherche psychique \" pourrait et devrait s'exercer.\nN'oublions pas, d'ailleurs, que l'espace est ce qui cree les\ndivisions nettes, les distinctions precises. Nos corps sont ex-\nterieurs les uns aux autres dans l'espace ; et nos consciences,\nen tant qu'attachees a ces corps, sont exterieures les unes aux\nautres aussi. Mais si elles ne tiennent au corps que par\nune partie d'elles-memes, on pent conjecturer que, pour le\nreste, elles ne sont pas aussi nettement separees. Loin de\nmoi la pensee de considerer la personnalite comme une simple\n\f476 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\napparence, ou comme une realite ephemere, ou comme une\ndependance de l'activite cerebrale ! Mais il est fort possible\nqu'entre les diverses personnalites s'accomplissent sans cesse des\n(\u2022changes eomparables aux phenomenes d'endosmose. Si cette\nendosniose exi.ste, on peut prevoir que la nature aura pris toutes\nses precautions pour en neutraliser l'effet, et que certains\nmecanismes devront etre specialement charges de rejeter dans\nl'inconscient les representations ainsi provoquees, car elles\nseraient fort embarrassantes dans la vie de tous les jours. Telle\nou telle de ces representations pourrait cependant, ici encore,\npasser en contrebande, surtout quand les mecanismes inhibitifs\nfonctionnent mal ; et sur elles encore s'exercerait la \" recherche\npsychique.\"\nPlus nous nous accoutumerons a cette idee d'une conscience\nqui deborde l'organisme, plus nous trouverons naturelle et\nvraisemblable l'hypothese de la survivance de lame au corps.\nCertes, si le mental etait rigoureusement caique sur le cerebral,\ns'il n'y avait rien de plus dans une conscience humaine que\nce qu'il serait possible de lire dans son cerveau, nous pour-\nrions admettre que la conscience suit les destinees du corps\net meurt avec lui. Mais si les faits, etudies sans parti pris,\nnous amenent au contraire a considerer la vie mentale comme\nbeaucoup plus vaste que la vie cerebrale, le survivance devient\nsi probable que l'obligation de la preuve incombera a celui qui\nla nie, bien plutot qu'a celui qui 1'afBrme ;\ncar, ainsi que je\nle disais ailleurs, \" l'unique raison que nous puissions avoir de\ncroire a une extinction de la conscience apres la mort est que\nnous voyons le corps se desorganiser, et cette raison n'a plus\nde valour si rindependance au moins partielle de la conscience\na l'e'gard du corps est, elle aussi, un fait d'experience.\"\nTelles sont, brievement resumees, les conclusions auxquelles\nme conduit un examen impartial des faits connus. C'est dire\nque je considere comme tres vaste, et meme comme indefmi,\nle champ ouvert a la recherche psychique. Cette nouvelle\nscience aura vite fait de rattraper le temps perdu. Les\nmathematiques remontent a l'antiquite grecque ; la physique\na deja trois ou quatre cents ans d'existence ; la chimie date\ndu xvnie\nsiecle ; la biologie est presque aussi vieille ; mais\nla psychologic date d'hier, et la \"recherche psychique\" en\nest a pen pros contemporaine. Faut-il regretter ce retard ?\n\fLXVII.] Presidential Address. 477\nJe me suis demande quelquefois ce qui se serait passe si\nla science moderne, au lieu de partir des mathematiques pour\ns'orienter dans la direction de la mecanique, de l'astronomie, de\nla physique et de la chimie, au lieu de faire converger toutes\nses forces sur l'etude de la matiere, avait debute par la\nconsideration de l'esprit, \u2014 si Kepler, Galilee, Newton, par\nexemple, avaient ete. des psychologues. Nous aurions certaine-\nnient eu une psychologie dont nous ne pouvons nous faire\naucune idee aujourd'hui, pas plus qu'on n'eut pu, avant Galilee,\nimaginer ce que serait notre physique : cette psychologie eut pro-\nbableinent ete a notre psychologie actuelle ce (pie notre physique\nest a celle d'Aristote. Etrangere a toute idee mecanistique,\nne concevant meme pas la possibility d'une pareille explication,\nla science eut recherche alors, au lieu de les ecarter a priori,\ndes faits comme ceux que vous etudiez : peut-etre meme la\n\" recherche psychique \" eut-elle figure parmi ses principales\npreoccupations. Une fois decouvertes les lois les plus generales\nde l'activite spirituelle (comme le furent, en fait, les lois fonda-\nmentales de la mecanique), on aurait passe de l'esprit propre-\nment dit a la vie : la biologie se serait constitute, mais une\nbiologie vitaliste, toute differente de la notre, qui serait allee\nchercher, derriere les formes sensibles des etres vivants, la force\ninterieure, invisible, dont elles sont les manifestations. Sur cette\nforce nous n'avons aucune prise aujourd'hui, justement parce\nque notre science de l'esprit est encore dans l'enfance ; et c'est\npourquoi les savants n'ont pas tort quand ils reprochent au\nvitalisme d'etre une doctrine sterile : il est sterile aujourd'hui,\nil ne le sera peut-etre pas toujours, et il ne l'eut pas ete,\nprobablement, si la science moderne, k l'origine, avait pris les\nchoses par un autre bout. En meme temps que cette biologie\nvitaliste aurait surgi une medecine qui eut remedie directement\naux insuffisances de la force vitale, qui eut vise la cause et non\npas les effets, le centre au lieu de la peripheric : la thera-\npeutique par suggestion eut pu prendre des formes et des pro-\nportions dont il nous est impossible de nous faire la moindre\nidee. Ainsi se serait fondee, ainsi se serait developpee la\nscience de l'activite spirituelle. Mais lorsque, suivant de haut\nen bas les manifestations de l'esprit, traversant la vie et la\nmatiere vivante, elle fut arrivee, de degre en degre, a la\nmatiere inerte, la science se serait arretee brusquement, surprise\n\f478 Professor Henri Bergson. [part\net desorientee. Elle aurait essaye d'appliquer a ce nouvel\nobjet ses methodes habituelles, et elle n'aurait eu aucune\nprise sur lui, pas plus que les procedes de calcul et de mesure\nn'ont de prise aujourd'hui sur les choses de l'esprit. O'est la\nmatiere, et non plus l'esprit, qui eut ete le royaume du\nmystere. Je suppose alors que dans 1111 pays inconnu,\u2014en\nAmerique par exemple, mais dans une Amerique non encore\ndecouverte par l'Europe,\u2014se fut developpee une science identique\na notre science actuelle, avec toutes ses applications meca-\nniques. II aurait pu arriver de temps en temps a des pecheurs,\ns'aventurant au large de cotes d'lrlande on de Bretagne, d'aper-\ncevoir au loin, a l'horizon, un navire americain filant a toute\nvitesse contre le vent, \u2014 ce que nous appelons un bateau\na vapeur. lis seraient venus raconter ce qu'ils avaient vu.\nLes aurait-on crus ? Probablement non. On se serait d'autant\nplus mefie d'eux qu'on eut ete plus savant, plus penetre d'une\nscience qui, par ses tendances purement psychologiques, aurait\nete orientee en sens inverse de la physique et de la inecanique.\nEt il aurait fallu alors que se constituat une societe comme la\nvotre, \u2014 mais cette fois une Societe de recherche physique,\u2014\nlaquelle eut fait comparaitre devant elle les temoins, controle\net critique leurs recits, etabli l'authenticite des \" apparitions\nde bateaux a vapeur. Toutefois, ne disposant pour le moment\nque de cette methode historique on critique, elle n'aurait pas\npu vaincre le scepticisme de ceux qui l'auraient mise en\ndemeure \u2014 puisqu'elle croyait a l'existence de ces bateaux\nmiraculeux \u2014 d'en construire un et de le faire marcher.\nVoila ce que je m'amuse quelquefois a rever. Mais quand je\nfais ce reve, bien vite je l'interromps et jo me dis : Non! il\nn'etait ni possible ni desirable que l'esprit humain suivit cette\nmarche. Cela n'etait pas possible, parce que, a l'aube des temps\nmodernes, la science mathematique existait deja, et qu'il fallait\nnecessairement commencer par tirer d'elle tout ce qu'elle pouvait\ndonner pour la connaissance du monde ou nous vivons : on ne\nlache pas le proie pour ce qui n'est peut-etre qu'une ombre. Mais,\na supposer que c'eut etc possible, il n'etait pas desirable, pour\nla science psychologique elle-meme. que l'esprit humain s'appli-\nquat d'abord k elle. Car, sans doute, si l'on eut depense de ce\ncote la somme de travail, de talent et de genie qui a ete\nconsacree aux sciences de la matiere, la connaissance de l'esprit\n\fl.XVIT.] Presidential Address. 479\neut pu etre poussee tres loin ;\nmais quelque chose lui eut\ntoujours nianque, qui est d'un prix inestimable et sans quoi\ntout le reste perd beaucoup de sa valeur : la precision, la\nrigueur, le souci de la preuve, l'habitude de distingue r entre\nce qui est simplement possible ou probable et ce qui est certain.\nNe croyez pas que ce soient la des qualites naturelles k l'intelli-\ngence. L'humanite s'est passee d'elles pendant fort longtemps ;\net elles n'auraient peut-etre jamais paru dans le monde s'il ne\ns'etait rencontre jadis, en un coin de la Grece, un petit peuple\nauquel I'd pen pres ne suffisait pas, et qui inventa la precision.\nLes mathematiques \u2014 cette creation du genie grec \u2014 furent-elles\nici l'effet ou la cause ? je ne sais ; mais incontestablement c'est\npar les mathematiques que le besoin de la preuve s'est propage\nd'intelligence k intelligence, prenant d'autant plus de place dans\nl'esprit humain que la science mathematique, par l'intermediaire\nde la mecanique, embrassait un plus grand nombre de pheno-\nmenes de la matiere. L'habitude d'apporter k l'etude de la\nrealite concrete les memes exigences de precision, de rigueur,\nde certitude, qui sont caracteristiques de l'esprit mathematique,\nest done une habitude que nous devons aux sciences de la matiere,\net que nous n'aurions jamais eue sans elles. C'est pourquoi une\nscience qui se fut appliquee tout de suite aux choses de l'esprit\nserait probablement restee incertaine et A'ague, si loin qu'elle\nse fut avancee : elle n'aurait peut-etre jamais distingue entre\nce qui est simplement plausible et ce qui doit etre accepte\ndefinitivement. Mais aujourd'hui que, grace aux sciences de la\nmatiere, nous savons faire cette distinction et possedons toutes\nles qualites d'esprit qu'elle implique, nous pouvons nous aven-\nturer sans crainte dans le domaine a peine explore des realites\npsychologiques. Avancons-y avec une hardiesse prudente,\ndebarrassons-nous de la mauvaise metaphysique qui gene nos\nmouvements, et la science de l'esprit pourra donner des\nresultats' qui depasseront toutes nos esperances.\n\f\fFORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick, - 1882-84.\nProfessor Balfour Stewart,\nF.R.S., 1885-87.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick, - 1888-92.\nThe Eight Hon.
