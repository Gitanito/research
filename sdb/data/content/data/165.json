He graduated in the Psychology School at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), then studied psychophysiology at the Brain Research Institute of New York, where he obtained his PhD.\n\nGrinberg founded laboratories for psychological research at UNAM and the University An\u00e1huac (both in the Mexican capital). In 1987 he inaugurated the National Institute for the Study of Consciousness (Instituto Nacional para el Estudio de la Conciencia, INPEC), where he carried out most of his investigations. He published technical articles in international peer reviewed journals and nearly fifty books of scientific research, philosophical and religious reflections, also some fiction.\n\nGrinberg disappeared in 1994, being last seen in Mexico City on 8 December. Police efforts to find him were ineffectual and nothing is known about his fate.1  Telepathic Interaction\n\nGrinberg described experiments with seven pairs of participants, of both sexes, to determine whether the effect of a stimulus applied to one might also be seen in the other.2 Each member of the pair was placed in one of two electromagnetically isolated Faraday chambers that were more than fourteen meters distant from one another, and asked to meditate for twenty minutes. &nbsp;One of the pair was then stimulated by light flashes at random times. In about one in four cases, Grinberg wrote, EEG brain activity similar to the person being subjected to light flashes was also recorded in the second person. No such matching was seen with participants who had not previously interacted or when a flash was not applied.  Extraocular Vision (EOV)\n\nGrinberg claimed also to have made successful experiments with children who were able to \u2018see\u2019 without using the eyes.3 The subjects were blindfolded, guided in meditation exercises, and then asked to try to perceive printed images by scanning them with their fingers. In some cases, he wrote, the quality of detail and accuracy appeared similar to that of ordinary retinal vision.  Syntergic Theory\n\nFrom his brain experiments Grinberg derived the theory of sint\u00e9rgica, a term formed by the Spanish words s\u00edntesis and energ\u00eda (synthesis and energy).&nbsp;\n\nGrinberg also explored the implications of the EPR paradox,4 which asserts that, if quantum theory is a complete model of reality, non-local interactions ought to exist between particles. He set out to prove that a quantum system in the brain creates a non-local, EPR correlation among human brains. He called this phenomenon the \u2018transferred potential\u2019 (TP), according to which a brain, suitably prepared by a period of meditation, is capable of both proximate and distant interactions with other brains, by a direct involvement of consciousness, and without sensory transmission or local effects.5\n\nGrinberg further proposed that his syntergic theory can explain the emergence of conscious experience, which he saw as the outcome of complex multidimensional interactions. The brain initiates an interaction between an energetic field (neuronal field) and the structure of space and thus gives rise to consciousness.\n\nAgainst the na\u00efve realism that postulates reality as external to the subject, Grinberg, adopting an idealistic stance, proposed that perception is neuropsychologically constructed, with information being located in space in the form of \u2018complex patterns of energy\u2019.6 Conscious experience, he thought, properly occurs when we synthesize the information-energy in space; this is how it becomes syntergic. Neuronal changes in the brain cause micro-distortions in the framework of the space-time continuum, and these, in turn, interact to create a \u2018hypercomplex macro-distortion\u2019 of the neuronal field.7 The final outcome of this process is perceptual experience.\n\nWith regard to vision, the components of the neuronal field and those of the quantum field \u2018fit together\u2019 in experience, so that the noise produced by the interaction is minimized by a specific, emergent \u2018interference pattern\u2019 (IP). This pattern represents the structure of experience, and contains the perceptual components which are perceived as lines and geometric forms, conceived as energetic forms of high complexity. The percepts, or images, which we \u2018objectively\u2019 see as colours and objects are ultimately products of the IP.8\n\nGrinberg\u2019s ideas can be seen to relate to the \u2018implicate order theory\u2019 developed by American physicist David Bohm, in which space is conceived as a holographic \u2018sea of potentialities\u2019 from which the universe and consciousness unfold explicitly. Here, the quantum wave\/particle duality paradox is eliminated, while the \u2018principle of nonlocality\u2019\u2014the capacity of one particle to influence another instantaneously\u2014is preserved.9  Research with Shamans\n\nGrinberg travelled extensively across Mexico during the 1980s to interview shamans and psychic healers, hoping to recover the \u2018native psychology\u2019 and \u2018original wisdom\u2019 of the Mexican people. From his case studies he concluded that shamans have highly \u2018neurosyntergic\u2019 brains that allow them to activate experiences in several locations of space, and to manipulate reality to create immediate, astounding effects, most notably materializations.10  Legacy\n\nGrinberg\u2019s ideas never received much academic attention in Mexico or elsewhere. No critical, annotated edition of his principal books and articles has been made or even seriously projected, in spite of their evident interest for neuropsychology, parapsychology, and other scientific fields.\n\nThe INPEC no longer exists, but some former students and colleagues are attempting to bring it back into operation under the name of Jacobo Grinberg Academy.11\n\nA group known as Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n de la Sinergia y de la Consciencia (Center of Research for Synergy and Consciousness-CISC), explores Grinberg\u2019s thinking in web seminaries, talks, and other activities.12  Works  Selected Books\n\nLa Construcci\u00f3n de la Realidad [The Construction of Reality] (1975).
