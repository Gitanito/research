Originating at the Oonferences which were held a year ago\nit commenced an organised existence last February. In July, a general\nmeeting, for the reading of papers and for discussion, was held, the\nproceedings of which, with some supplementary matter, were published\nas Part I. of the Society's Proceedings. In December last a second\u00b7~\u00ad\nGeneral Meeting was convened. The substance of the papers and reports\nthen read, together with an account of some more recent experiments,\nwill shortly be issued, as Part II. of the Proceedings.\nThe practical work of the Society has been carried on chiefly b:y\nmeans of the Oommittees. Four of these-the Thought-transfel ence\nOommittee, the Haunted House Oommittee, the Mesmeric Oommittee,\nand the Literary Oonunittee-have held many meetings, and have col-\nlected a large body of evidence. The Reichenbach Oommittee has\nrecently commenced active operations, with valuable results.\nThe Oouncil are anxious to enlist the assistance of as many\nMembers as possible throughout the country in the active work of the\nSociety; and with this object are issuing a circular, containing hints\nand directions as to the best means by which such assistance may be\nrendered in the various branches of the research.\nThe Oouncil have been greatly encouraged by the rapid growth\nof the Society during the first year of its existence, looking not\nmerely at the number who have joined as Members and Associates, but\nat the distinction of some among them. The amount of correspondence -\nalso increases every month, and testifies to a very widespread interest\nin Psychical Research. The work already done by the Society, and the\nposition it has attained, justify the Oouncil in believing that an\nimportant place, long vacant in organised research, has been, and will\ncontinue to be, effectively filled by it.\nThe numbers of the Society at the close of the year 1882 were:-\nMembers, 107 j Associates, 38; Honorary Members, 5; total, 150.\nThe Oouncil are greatly indebted to Dr. W. H. Stone for his\nliberality in the arrangements which they have made with him for the\nease of the Society'S Rooms, at 14, Dean's Yard, Westminster. They\nfeel that this local establishment, together with the further facilities\nDigitized by Google\n\f1883.J Anniversary Meeting. 159\n.for experiment which Dr. Stone is both able and willing to afford, will\ntend greatly to promote the objects of the Society.\nThe President of the Society (Mr. Henry Sidgwick) has generously\npresented it with a collection of about 150 volumes of psychical\nliterature, which will form a valuable nucleus for a library. It need\nhardly be said that the Council will gratefully aecept any further\ncontributions of this kind.\nA few alterations in the Rules and Constitution of the Society\nhave commended themselves to the Council since last February. They\nnow ask the Meeting to confirm these alterations according to the\nprovisions of Rule 24.\nA Statement of Receipts aild Expenditure made up to the 31st\n-of December, 1882, is herewith presented.\nThe thanks of the Society were voted to the Treasurer and Auditors\u2022.\nThe Council, on behalf of the Society, acknowledge with thanks the\nfollowing presents, most of which have been received since the date of\nthe Annual General Meeting :-\nFrom Hensleigh Wedgwood, Esq.-A special donation of .\u00a350, \"for the\npurposes of publication.\" \u2022\nFrom Henry Sidgwick, Esq.-A collection of about 150 volumes of\nPsychical Literature.\n....Also a large number of Books and Periodicals, including some volumes\nof considerable value, from the following ladies and gentlemen :-\nMessrs.
