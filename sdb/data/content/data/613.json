As is the case\nwith all such \" free \" material, that is, such as cannot be statistically\ninvestigated in the same way as numbers and playing cards, the\nevidential value of booktests can only be definitely established by\nmeans of control experiments. Consequently Mrs Sidgwick con-\nducted a limited investigation of this kind. She took an actual test\ngiven in a sitting with Mrs Leonard and checked it against twelve\nbooks selected by her at random.2\nThe experiment, however, was\non too small a scale to provide adequate material for comparison.\nA little later, therefore, a larger experiment was undertaken, though\non different lines. Sixty people were asked to choose ten books each,\nat random. After they had chosen the books they were asked to\nverify from each book three tests devised for the purpose. The 1800\npassages thus obtained produced, according to the late Colonel\nBaddeley's analysis, an average of 4-7 per cent, of success, as against\n36 per cent, obtained by Mrs Leonard over the whole of such of her\nactual booktests as were examined by Mrs Sidgwick. 3\nThe objection could be raised against this experiment that it was\nwholly artificial, having no relation to a genuine booktest, as had\nMrs Sidgwick's original investigation of chance, and that it was con-\nducted under conditions having no resemblance to those of an actual\nbooktest. Under those circumstances chance was not, as it were,\ngiven a fair trial. It seemed useful, therefore, to repeat Mrs Sidg-\nwick's experiment on a larger scale, and also to supplement it with\nan experiment in which persons claiming supernormal powers, or\nhaving some experience of booktests, or having considerable literary\n1 \" An Examination of Book-Tests obtained in Sittings with Mrs Leonard,\"\nProceedings (1921), xxxi. 242 ff.\n2\nIbid., pp. 379-86.\n3 \" On the Element of Chance in Book-Tests,\" Proceedings (1923), xxxiii.\n606-20.\ne 59\n\f(iO Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booldests [part\nknowledge, should attempt to give booktests in the ordinary way.\nThus, the dice would be heavily loaded in favour of chance. The\npresent paper reports the result of these two small investigations.\nI\nThe form taken by the last-mentioned experiment was as follows.\nA number of members and others were invited to take part, and\nthose who agreed to do so were sent the following circular :\n\"4 February 1931.\n\" Thank you for having kindly agreed to take part in our experi-\nmental investigation of booktests.\n\" The object of the experiment is to discover whether individuals\n(other than mediums) who are thought to have some supernormal\nfaculty or who are successful in sittings with mediums, can produce\nbooktests which are at all comparable with those given by mediums.\n\" What we ask you to do is to try, when you feel in the mood (so\nas to give the subconscious as free play as possible) at any time\nduring the week from Sunday, the 8th of February to Saturday, the\n14th of February (both dates inclusive), to imagine that you are in\nMr Besterman's flat on the second floor of 47 Great Ormond Street,\nBloomsbury, W.C. 1, and to give a booktest from it. I hope that\nthe procedure is known to all the experimenters.\n\" Replies should be addressed to the Secretary, Society for Psychi-\ncal Research, 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1, and should\nreach me not later than Monday, the 16th of February. Please mark\nyour envelope with a '\nB '\nin the top left-hand corner.\"\nOwing to absence, delay, and other causes, only a small number\nof replies that could be used was received, eighteen in all. Miss\nCarruthers then very kindly co-operated by allowing the unopened\nenvelopes to be handed to her by Miss Newton, and by bringing\nthem to my flat, there opening them, and verifying the references\nfrom my shelves. The results are set out below. In view of the\ndisappointingly small number of replies, I have not thought it worth\nwhile to make elaborate analyses, and have contented myself with\na minimum number of laconic annotations, which appear in italics\nwithin square brackets. It will be seen that some of the numbers\nare missing. This is due to the fact that the unopened envelopes\nreceived before the final date were numbered on the outside for\nidentification, and that some of them, on being opened, were found\nto contain only apologies for inability to take part, and the like.\n1\n[1]. \" Go to the eleventh book from the right ; on the second\nshelf from the floor ; in the book-cases opposite the door by which\n1\nThe references to my books should not be compared with each other, for\nI purposely changed the places of some of them between the experiments.\n\f121] Further Inquiries in to Element of Chance in Booktests 61\nyou enter the room ;\npage 75 ; ninth line from bottom ; there\nshould be words that remind you of a member of your family once\nvery dear to you ; I think, a woman, but of that I am not quite\nsure [no].\" The Association of Special Libraries and Information\nBureaux, Report of Proceedings of the Second Conference : London\n1926.\n[2].\n\" In the first book-case you come to as you turn to the left\non entering the room, on the second shelf from the top, the fifth\nbook from the left-hand side, page 65, there is a reference to Phoebus\nApollo [no].\" Henrik Ibsen, The Pretenders and two other Plays :\nEveryman's Library, London [1913].\n[3].\n\" I see a bookcase opposite a window [no].

Allison, Leonard and Soule Experi-\nments in Psychical Research (1929) and John F. Thomas, Case\nStudies bearing upon Survival (1929)].\nIt is very difficult to estimate in concrete terms the results of this\nexperiment, and to compare them with those obtained in actual\nbooktests. This difficulty is chiefly due to the very vague and general\nnature of most of the experimental tests quoted above. We can,\nhowever, note that of the 38 booktests, comprising, so far as it is\npossible to count them, 113 separate indications, only five can be\ndescribed as evidential hits. These are 5A (colour of book), 5E\n(earthenware and cups), 9C (suffragettes), 9D (old-time feuds and\nsea), and 16A (general description of bookcase and inverted descrip-\ntion of book). Of these, the only one that is comparable with a good\nLeonard booktest is 5E. It is obvious, in short (especially when it\nis remembered that Mrs Sidgwick estimated Feda's booktests to be\nsuccessful to the extent of about 36%),1\nthat in this experiment\nchance, even under the most favourable circumstances, did not pro-\nduce results even remotely approaching those obtained by Mrs\nLeonard. 2\nII\nThe other experiment alluded to, that in which Mrs Sidgwick's\noriginal inquiry into chance was repeated on a larger scale, has now\nto be described. This was also carried out with the books in my\nflat. I sent a list of the numbers 1 to 26, the number of full shelves\nin my flat, to three members of the Society, Miss Ina Jephson, Mr\nC. E. Bechhofer Roberts, and Mr H. F. Saltmarsh. Without telling\n1 Mrs Henry Sidgwick, op. ext., xxxi. 245-6 n.\n2\nThis, of course, is simply another way of saying that the odds against the\npurely chance occurrence of Feda's results are very heavy.\n\f68 Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booldests [part\nthem the object of the request, I asked them to place against each\nnumber a figure not higher than twenty, followed by an L or an K.\nIn this way I obtained 78 references, the number 26, for instance,\nfollowed by 9L, meaning the ninth book from the left on shelf\nnumber 26. Miss Newton then came to my flat with the three lists,\ndetermined at random to which shelves the numbers should apply,\nand performed the laborious task of writing against each reference\nthe name of the book to which it was found to apply.\nIn the meanwhile I had asked Mrs Salter to select three actual\nbooktests suitable for the purpose of the experiment. The three\ntests she chose are all from Mrs Sidgwick's paper, and are here\nsummarised for convenience.\nBooldest i\nFeda said that in the second paragraph of page 71, or about the\nmiddle of the page, would be found a message, of which she said\nthat\n\" ( 1\n) It refers to a past condition.\n\" (2) But has also an application to the present.\n\" (3) It is an answer to a thought which was much more in your\nmind at one time than it is now,\u2014a question which was once much\nin your mind, but is not now, especially since you have known Feda.\n\" (4) On the opposite page [p. 70] is a reference to fire.\n\" (5) On the opposite side [p. 72] is a reference to light.\n\" (6) On the opposite side is a reference to olden times.\u2014These\nhave nothing to do with the message but are just tests that you have\nthe right page.\n\" (7) On the same page or opposite page or perhaps over the leaf\n[pp. 70-72] a very important word beginning with S.\"\nIn the original experiment all these seven indications were verified.\nThe second paragraph (stanza) proved to be part of a poem by\nOliver Wendell Holmes :\n\" The weary pilgrim slumbers,\nHis resting place unknown,\nHis hands were crossed, his lids were closed,\nThe dust was o'er him strown ;\nThe drifting soil, the mouldering leaf\nAlong the sod were blown,\nHis mound has melted into Earth\nHis memory lives alone.\"\nThese lines\n(1) Pv-efer to early settlers in America, that is, to \" a past con-\ndition.\"\n\f12l] Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booktests 69\n(2) They have an application to the present, in that they answer\nthe sitter's doubts about the burial of the communicator.\n(3) The sitter wrote :\n\" It was a question in my mind constantly\nat one time whether it would be possible to identify the spot with\nthe help of the officers present, and when the war was over to mark\nit with a cross. I have thought very little of that lately and have\nnot felt concerned as I did at first that his grave was unmarked and\nunknown.\"\n(4) On the opposite page occur the lines :\n\" Still shall the fiery pillar's ray\nAlong the pathway shine.\"\n(5) There are several references to light on p. 72 :\n\" flaming,\"\n\" sunlight,\" and others.\n(6) The whole page contains a poem descriptive of a paddle\nsteamer. 1\n(7) The above-mentioned poem, called \" The Steamboat.\" 2\nFor the purpose of the experiment I have assumed that (3) applies\nto me, and that the test of importance in (7) should be importance\nin the context.\nBoohtest ii\nThis test ran as follows :\n\" On page what is called one four of\nthis book, fourteen, wait a minute, something made her feel, gave\nher a feeling of heat, something hot, heat, half way down that page.\nBut she'd better explain, it might come from two sources, it might\ncome from a mention of heat, like a hot sun, or a hot fire, or it might\ncome from a mention of great anger, but spoken of as heat ; . . .\n\"\nIn the actual booktest Feda's indications were verified by the\noccurrence of the words \" ardent patriot.\" 3\nBooktest Hi\nIn this test Feda said :\n\" Page 15 of the same book, half way down or a little above\nperhaps, it speaks\u2014wait a minute, speaks\u2014do you want to give\nthe position exactly 1 He's making a line across half way down the\n1\nMy verification of (5) and (6) differs from that of the sitter. This is due\nto the fact that the latter treated \" opposite page \" and \" opposite side \" as\nsynonymous, whereas I think that the former refers to p. 70 and the latter to\np. 72. However, I examined a copy of the book in question in the British\nMuseum, and found, as can be seen above, that Feda's indications apply\nalmost as well to p. 72 as to p. 70. The score is not affected. In the next\nitem (7) there is another difference, and this time one that does affect the score,\nin Feda's favour. The sitter regarded this as a failure, but I agree with Mrs\nSidgwick in thinking that it may reasonably be regarded as a success.\n2\nMrs Henry Sidgwick, op. tit., xxxi. 260-4. 3\nIbid., p. 281-2.\n\f70 Further Inquiries in to Element of Chance in Booktests [part 121\npage, and the position is about a quarter of an inch above that line,\nhe's got a reason for doing that, on that line, a quarter of an inch\nabove half way down that page, there is a word or words ... a long\npole . . .

The first one contains seven\nseparate indications, none of them particularly evidential, spread\nover three pages.

To do so it is only necessary to determine\nthe estimated odds against Feda's indications (pp. 68-70 above) being\nverified by chance, to determine the relative value of the successes\nobtained in the actual booktests, and similarly to evaluate the\nsuccesses obtained by chance, as set out in the above table. This\nhas been done in Tables II and III. In the former of these the\nseven separate indications of booktest i are dealt with, and in the\nlatter Table booktests i (as a whole), ii, and iii are considered. The\nvalues of the various tests have been estimated as accurately as\npossible with the available data. 1\nBut it must be emphasised that\nthe comparative value of the figures obtained in this way is not\naffected by the accuracy of the estimated odds, since the same odds\nare applied to the actual booktests and to the 80 artificial ones.\n1\nIf the experiment had been on a larger scale it would have been necessary\nto take various points into consideration which have been here ignored. It\nmight then be doubtful, for instance, whether the seven indications in book-\ntest i should be combined by simple multiplication.\n\f121] Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Boohtests 93\nTable II\nIndications :\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\nPossible Score : 1\/2 1\/2 1\/100 1\/10 1\/10 1\/4 1\/3\nScores obtained\nactual booktest\nm\n: 1\/2 1\/2 1\/50 1\/10 1\/10 1\/4 1\/3\n1. \u2014 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/3\n2. 1\/2 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n3. 1\/2 1\/2 \u2014 1\/10 \u2014 \u2014 1\/3\n4. 1\/2 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 1\/10 1\/4 1\/3\n5.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n6. 1\/2 1\/2\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/3\n7. 1\/2\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n8. 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 1\/10 1\/10 1\/4 \u2014\n9. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 IM \u2014\n10. \u2014 1\/2\nests.\n11. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/10 1\/4 \u2014\n12. 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n13. \u2014 1\/2\nO\nQ 14.\n15. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/4 \u2014\n<D\nO\nrt\n16. \u2014 \u2014 1\/50 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\na 17. \u2014 1\/2 \u2014 1\/10 1\/10 1\/4 \u2014\no 18. 1\/2\n19. 1\/2 1\/2\n1\/4\nt3 20. 1\/2 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\ng 21. 1\/2\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/4 \u2014\n'3\n+= 22.\nO 23. 1\/2 1\/2\nCQ\n<D 24.\nM\no 25. 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/4 \u2014\no\nCO 26. 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/4 \u2014\n27. 1\/2 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1\/4 1\/3\n28. 1\/2 1\/3\n29. 1\/2 1\/2 1\/10 1\/3\n30. 1\/2 1\/10 1\/3\n31. 1\/2 1\/2\n1\/4\n32. 1\/2\n33.\n34. 1\/2 1\/10\n35. 1\/2\n1\/4\n36. 1\/2\n37. 1\/2 1\/10 1\/3\n38. 1\/2 1\/10 1\/4\n39. 1\/2 1\/3\n\f94 Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booktests [part\n03\nV 53.\n-\no 58\n\u2014\n\u2014\n=\n+=\nC\no\nm\n<D\n-\nZ\n-\nIndications :\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\nPossible Score : 1\/2 1\/2 1\/100 1\/10 1\/10 1\/4 1\/3\nScores obtained in\nactual booktest 1\/2 1\/2 1\/50 1\/10 1\/10 1\/4 1\/3\n40. \u2014 _\n41. 1\/2 1\/10 1\/4 1\/3\n42. 1\/2 _ 1\/4 -\n43. 1\/2 1\/10 1\/4\n44. 1\/2 1\/4\n45. 1\/2 1\/10 1\/4 \u2014\n46. 1\/2\n47. 1\/2 \u2014 \u2014 _\n48. 1\/2\n49. 1\/2 1\/4\n50. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 _ . _\n51. 1\/2 1\/4\n52. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a7 54. 1\/2 1\/3\n^ 55. 1\/2 1\/2 1\/10\n56. 1\/2 1\/2 -

On the other hand, the value of the long\npole indication (booktest iii) was so difficult to estimate that I con-\nsulted several experts, all of whose estimated values greatly ex-\nceeded my own estimate of 1\/300. Yet we see that in 89 chance\ntests a complete success 1\nwas obtained in two instances (producing\na chance probability of 1\/44-5), while in three other cases some\napproximate success was obtained.

Thus, over the whole of the 560 indica-\ntions analysed in Table II, chance has been successful in about 28% of cases.\nBut when we realise that the figure is made up of successes most of which\nhave a very small value, this percentage loses its impressiveness.\n\fREVIEW\nTransactions of the Fourth International Congress for Psychical\nResearch. Edited by Theodore Besterman. 8vo, pp. iii. 259,\n2 plates. London : Society for Psychical Research, 1930.\nPrice 7s. 6d. net.\nThe series of International Congresses for Psychical Research, as\nobjectively perpetuated in their Transactions, appears more and\nmore clearly to be serving a real purpose in the advancement of our\nsubject. The first Congress in 1921 may have suggested that the\ndesire for marvels was stronger than the desire for research. The\nexcellent report of the Groningen psychologists on their experiments\nin telepathy seemed, for example, strangely out of tune with the\ngeneral trend. At the second Congress, the dread of creating a\nsimilar impression resulted in the passing of a resolution protesting\nagainst the popular confusion of spiritualism with psychical research.\nIt is to be doubted whether this declaration served the intended\npurpose. But that Brugmans, representing the Groningen group,\nagain presented a detailed report, and that a few serious papers were\nread, served to save this Congress also from absolute failure. That\nthe third, held in Paris in 1927, was able to lift itself from this level,\nis attributable in large part to the wisdom of certain French col-\nleagues, especially, I believe, to the astuteness of M. Warcollier's\nanalysis of telepathic phenomena. This Congress gave definite\npromise that such meetings might help to keep us nearer together.\nThe fourth Congress, as judged from its Transactions, has done\nbetter still. There are not many papers which betray that non-\nchalance so evident at the first two Congresses. The theoretical\npapers are offered by competent philosophers and scientists, who\nunderstand the intricate problems with which they deal. Several\nreports of cases are vivid, interesting, and cogent ; and some of the\nreports of experimental work are serious contributions, inviting the\nclosest perusal and the most serious analysis and reflection.\nPhilosophical papers are presented by Driesch, Oesterreich, and\nSchneider, among others ; these undertake to show the implications\nof contemporary biology, psychology, and epistemology for the inter-\npretation of supernormal phenomena. Oesterreich's papers are\nparticularly able presentations of epistemological and psychological\ntheory. The fact that the transference of an idea which is not at\n99\n\f100 Review [part\nthe time in the agent's consciousness involves more difficulties than\ncan at present be solved either by brain-wave, spiritistic, or Kantian\ntheories is cogently shown in a few of Oesterreich's sentences ; the\nsame problem arises later in reading Tanagra's paper on telepathic\nimpressions received from an unconscious stratum of the agent's\nmind. It is of interest to see that really serious philosophers have\nhere been willing to give our problems time and thought. In par-\nticular, Husserl's phenomenology is sketched by Oesterreich in such\na way as to suggest that serious consideration of the problem of the\nnature of knowledge is in order even in the most immediately\npressing aspects of our work.\nAmong the papers on method and procedure, the most impressive\nis Mr Salter's direct challenge to all who know of any physical\nphenomena the serious investigation of which they desire. He pro-\nposes nothing less than that the International Congress Committee\nshould formulate standard conditions of control applicable to the\ndifferent classes of controllable phenomena, by which the bona fides\nof mediums can be ascertained and conditions for serious research\nfor students of physical phenomena made available ;\nfurthermore,\nthat mediums refusing to work under control conditions be no longer\ndiscussed in psychical publications. That this would fulfil a crying\nneed can scarcely be doubted by anyone who has followed the dismal\nstory of the physical phenomena of the last dozen years. Disagree-\nable facts about the Schneider brothers have been getting more and\nmore plentiful, and by 1927 the Valiantine and Margery cases had\ngone their way into that limbo to which the repeatedly exposed\nmedium is assigned, since no more torrid region is available. The\nimportance of Mr Salter's suggestions can only be realized by one\nwho will peruse any of the various journals in which physical pheno-\nmena play a large part, or by those few distressing articles in the\npresent Transactions which proceed exactly as if the last dozen\nyears had taught us nothing. Reports on various marvels appear\nto have been offered at the Athens Congress without so much as a\ndescription of the control used, the aching void being plugged with\nphrases to the effect that the persons making the inquiry were of\nthe utmost scientific integrity, or that the person reading the report\nhad seen the phenomena himself. Among the many new cases\nwhich are reported are one involving supernormal knowledge about\nthe details of a murder, one regarding levitation among the der-\nvishes, and one on prolonged experiments with Frau S. of Breslau.\nThe cases are reported too inadequately to justify any definite im-\npression. Mr Salter's comment on the desirability of excluding\nunauthenticated cases from psychic publications might, I think, be\nheld to apply to the transactions of psychic congresses.\nThese strictures are perhaps a little too severe in relation to the\n\f121] Review 101\nexciting poltergeist reported by Baron von Winterstein. The\naccount is a typical and a good poltergeist story. One finishes the\nreading of it without any idea in the world how the. dry plaster got\ninto the hair of the sitters, how the saucer was broken without the\ncup being moved, how objects were hurled and faces drenched.\nTrue, but one also conies away from a performance by a good con-\njurer, having seen such things in full light and not knowing how\nthey happened except that they did not happen supernormally. I\ndo not argue that the lady in question was a fraud ; in fact, I am\nunable to believe she was. But to report and to publish such a case\nadds nothing whatever to our science.\nWere the circumstances but slightly different, I should have to\nsay the same about Mr Feilding's account of the bleeding pictures\nand the bleeding Host of the Abbe Vachere. How the things could\nhave happened which Mr Feilding saw happen, or which his friend\nsaw happen, is entirely beyond my imagination. Did pictures of\nChrist actually ooze blood, in quantities frequently copious, or did\nthe Host upon the Altar pour forth so much blood that it had to\nbe soaked up with cloths ? The water-pot which appears in one\npart of the narrative as the guilty party seems too weak an accom-\nplice to have done much. I venture to think that cases of this sort,\nat which we throw up our hands in the knowledge that any con-\nclusion whatever is unwarranted, are probably good for us in the\npresent state of our ignorance. One such case competently and\npatiently pursued, as this was, is valuable if for no other reason\nthan to remind us of the complexity of the kinds of evidence with\nwhich we have to deal.\nSir Oliver Lodge and Mr Besterman discuss the status of psychical\nresearch and the reasons for its failure to gain recognition from the\nmajority of the scientific world. Both seem to incline to the opinion\nthat the phenomena are so complicated as to have precluded the\npossibility of rapid and definitive advances from one stage to another,\nsuch as marks the orderly progress of most sciences. Mr Besterman,\nin fact, undertakes to show most concretely that public sentiment\nduring the half century has gradually become more friendly. His\ncase, in relation to the attitude of the reading public, is strong ; but\nas regards the existence of any visible trend of this sort in the\nscientific world, I must sadly dissent. Surely the science most\ndirectly related to psychical research is psychology. I doubt whether\na daily visitor to laboratories of psychology, with an opportunity\nto live in and breathe their intellectual atmosphere, would venture\nto suggest that the academic halls echo with gentler taunts than\nthose which greeted Sidgwick and Myers in 1882. Mr Besterman\nimplies that the situation is better in the United States, reporting\nthat \" the psychological departments of two American universities\n\f102 Review [part\n(Harvard and Leland Stanford) have sections specifically dealing\nwith psychical research, and another (Clark) recently organised a\ncourse of lectures on the case for and against our subject \"\n(p. 119).\nHaving participated in two of the three academic adventures de-\nscribed here, I beg to be allowed my gasp of protest. A small fellow-\nship does exist in Harvard, enough to give half-time work to a\ngraduate student, but for several reasons which will occur to the\nreader, it is vacant a good deal of the time. If Mr Besterman has\nstudied the publications resulting from the Stanford inquiries, I\nwonder why he avoided reference to the peculiar circumstances\nattending the fellowship there 1 The lectures at Clark included dis-\ncourses by such authorities as Dr L. R. G. Crandon. Psychical\nresearchers may be grateful that the series attracted no more atten-\ntion than it did.\nPsychical research, as Sir Oliver Lodge's candid title makes clear,\nis not generally recognized by scientists, and he points out some of\nthe reasons. Probably the first reason is the attempt of science to\nget a unified view of the world, and the desire of psychologists to\nassimilate their data to those of the systematized physical and bio-\nlogical sciences. Psychology, one might say, is a closed fortress\nwhich casual arrows are not likely to penetrate, and new towers are\nconstantly being built which are harder and harder to hit. In the\nsecond place, psychical research, with all respect to the many fine\nminds which have contributed to it, presents a bewildering mass of\nauthenticated and half-authenticated odds and ends, the basic laws\nof which can only be dimly divined. We play upon corners of a\nvast and bewildering domain, conceiving that the accumulation of\nmore facts will somehow advance our subject. New cases are con-\nstantly published while we forget those published earlier. Psychical\nresearch would, under favourable circumstances, be regarded by the\nscientific world as ethnology would be regarded if it consisted chiefly\nof accounts of the megaliths or spades of particular peoples, or the\nway in which they form the pluperfect tense in ceremonial language.\nWe suffer from a plethora of undigested and indigestible data.\nSuch progress as we have made is, for the most part, directly\nattributable to the systematic thinking-out and testing of hypo-\ntheses. Consider, for example, Mrs Sidgwick's early hypotheses\nregarding haimtings, and regarding the nature of trance communi-\ncation, and the several hypotheses regarding telepathy published in\nPhantasms of the Living and in Myers's Human Personality. Such\nhypotheses have constantly guided and systematized investigations\nregarding telepathic and mediumistic phenomena. In the same\nconnection must be reported the remarkable series of methodical\nhypotheses and testings of hypotheses characteristic of the work of\nWarcollier during the last twenty years. All these hypotheses are\n\f121] Review 103\nincompletely verified, but they, rather than bundles of detached\nfacts, underlie most of the progress we have made.\nIn the same connection it is to be noted that the present Trans-\nactions report long-distance telepathic experiments, conducted by\ngroups at Paris, Warsaw, Vienna and Athens, which achieved a level\nof brilliance hardly ever surpassed in well-authenticated work. In\nthe analysis of the results Dr Konstantinides has shown that he is\nalert to an array of psychological problems which usually appear\nin connection with telepathic phenomena, presenting the data in\nsuch form as to permit the reader to verify for himself some of the\ninteresting points which Warcollier and earlier workers have empha-\nsized. Of special interest is the fragmentation of the telepathic\nimage, the \" contagion \" among percipients, the substitution of con-\ncrete for abstract elements, and the appearance, through some link\non a subconscious level, of items associated with the object chosen\nfor transmission. In other words, the present series is not a mere\nreporting of facts ; it is a critical consideration of the special psycho-\nlogical phenomena manifesting themselves through these facts. On\nthe other hand, it is most regrettable that the investigators appear\nto have been indifferent to the special mental and physical con-\nditions of individual persons from one experiment to another, and\nhave made no effort to discover the reasons for successes in some\ncases and failures in others. The difficulty is accentuated by the\nfact that statistical control of the results is not undertaken at all.\nCertain implications of all this seem pertinent to the plans for the\nCongress to be held in London next year. If the international com-\nmittees, and the British Committee in particular, merely undertake\nto improve slightly upon the general scientific level of the Fourth\nCongress, the result will be disheartening. If, in a generous desire\nto further international co-operation, the S.P.R. permits badly con-\ntrolled or incompletely reported phenomena to be described, the\nreaction of the British public will, of course, be unfavourable. From\na scientific point of view, there is a further problem, namely, the\ndanger that mere observations of cases, disjecta membra thrown out\nin some spasm of nature and failing to give us any new insight, be\ngiven preference over material which permits such interpretation as\nwould serve definitely to credit or discredit some working hypo-\nthesis. I have already indicated personal partiality for some of the\ntheories of Myers and of Mrs Sidgwick, but I should not wish to\nsuggest that any hypothesis seriously thought out and pertinent to\nany group of facts should be taboo. Such bewildering data as con-\nfront us justify leaps in the dark, and even a poor hypothesis,\nhonestly pursued, should, it seems to me, be given precedence over\npapers which merely report more observations.

IS PROOF OF SURVIVAL POSSIBLE ?\n1\nBy H. F. Saltmarsh.\nThe object of this paper is to inquire how far any type of evidence\ndealt with in psychical research can afford proof of the survival\nof human personality if it were to be found in an ideally perfect\nform.\nI am going to suppose that there is an example of each particular\ntype of phenomenon so well established from the evidential point\nof view, so clear cut and free from embarrassing complications, that\nno question as to the facts can be raised. For example, if we speak\nof telekinesis I shall assume that a material object has actually been\nmoved without contact, if we attribute supernormal knowledge to\na medium I shall take it for granted that all normal channels whereby\nthe knowledge might have been acquired were completely blocked.\nThat this is not so in actual experience few will be disposed to\ndeny : our grain is always mixed with chaff and requires much\nsifting and cleansing before being fit to use, but by making the\nabove assumptions the purely logical critique of the position is\nrendered easier.\nThere is one preliminary point which requires attention. In what\nsense do we use the word proof ?\nIt is a word of great elasticity of meaning, ranging from the\nabsolute or apodeictic proof such as some claim to find in mathe-\nmatics, down to the legal meaning, as when counsel says that a\nwitness will \" prove \" so and so.\nNowadays absolute or apodeictic proof is somewhat out of\nfashion ; mathematical physicists, and even some mathematicians,\nhave abated their pretensions to attain to absolute truth and are\nsatisfied with, in fact prefer, the high probability afforded by\nstatistical law.\nThis is not the place to enter into any discussion of the question\nwhether absolute proof is ever attainable, more particularly so as\ntruth derived from the data of experience can never claim a higher\nvalidity than extreme probability.\nI am perfectly convinced that I see an object in the sky (called\nthe moon), yet it is theoretically possible that I may be hallucinated,\nthat everybody who tells me that they also see this object may also\n1\nRead at a Private Meeting of the Society, 28 October, 1931.\nh 105\n\f106 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nbe hallucinated or else deliberately lying, that all confirmatory\nevidence, such as photographs of the object in question, which I\nthink I see, are either hallucinations or fakes. It is highly improbable\nthat this is so, but as it is theoretically possible, it follows that\nabsolute certainty is not attainable.\nIn the same way, so long as it is theoretically possible for a man\nto lie and to be hallucinated or otherwise deceived, no evidence of\nsurvival can possibly afford absolute proof. The nearest approach\nwhich I could attain to this would be for me actually to find myself\nsurviving after death, yet even then I should presumably have to\nrely on my memory of having undergone physical death, and\nmemory often plays false. Anyhow I could not communicate the\nproof to anyone else. It would be a purely subjective proof, hence\nnot of scientific validity. The only fact of which I am absolutely\ncertain is that I am conscious at the present moment. This I cannot\ndoubt, for the fact of doubting in itself involves or implies conscious-\nness. I can, however, if I please, doubt all else.\nHigh probability, then, is all that we can hope for in this as in\nall other matters, but we need not be disturbed by this fact, since,\nas Eddington says, \" Proof is an idol before whom the pure mathe-\nmatician tortures himself. In physics we are generally content to\nsacrifice before the lesser shrine of Plausibility.\" 1\nWhat we have to see, then, is not whether the phenomena\ninvestigated by psychical research prove survival, but how far they\nestablish its plausibility. Alternative explanations are always\ntheoretically possible ; what we have to decide is how far they are\nprobable.\nWe can start the inquiry by dividing the. phenomena into two\nclasses, the physical and the mental. We will consider the physical\nfirst.\nThese are the phenomena where some event happens involving\na physical object, such as the movement of a solid body, the pro-\nduction of light, sound or heat waves, the extrusion of teleplasm,\nand so on. There must also be included in the physical group those\ncases where the only material object involved is the body of the\nmedium ;\nexamples of these would be levitation, immunity from\nhurt when handling hot coals, etc., also such phenomena as changes\nof voice, gesture and handwriting.\nNow it is clear that in order that events of this kind should have\nany value as evidence of survival they must possess some char-\nacteristic which will connect them with some deceased person. The\nbare fact that a material object is moved in a way we cannot account\nfor by normal means does not afford any clue to the identity of\nthe agent. All we could say in the most favourable circumstances\n1\nNature of the Physical Universe, p. 337.\n\f122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 107\nwould be that some unknown agency is involved and that that\nagency exhibits intelligence ; we could not argue that it was, or\never had been, human, still less that it was connected with some\none particular person.\nThus when any special characteristics which might connect them\nwith a deceased person are absent, we can rule out physical phe-\nnomena as completely unevidential of survival. Where, however,\nthe phenomena show some special characteristics which connect\nthem with some definite deceased person, any evidential value for\nsurvival rests entirely on those characteristics.\nThe chief forms of special characteristics are when teleplasm\nforms some recognisable likeness such as a face, when the matter is\nimpressed in a recognisable way as with a fingerprint, when the\ndirect writing reproduces a recognised handwriting or signature,\nand the direct voice a recognised voice. The two last may be\nparalleled in the type of phenomenon in which the medium's body\nalone is involved, as when the medium's hand writes in a recognisable\nhandwriting or her voice reproduces a recognisable voice. To these\nmay be added those cases where the medium uses recognisable\ngestures.\nThe argument for survival from such phenomena would apparently\nrun somewhat as follows. Special characteristics, such as facial\nfeatures, fingerprints, handwriting, voice and gesture, belonging to\na deceased person, are reproduced by a medium who is normally\nignorant of these details ; the source of the knowledge must there-\nfore be outside her ; and the original owner is most likely to be that\nsource.\nNow the most ardent enthusiast for physical phenomena would\nhardly claim that this argument is a strong one, and I think that a\nlittle criticism will suffice to deprive it of most of what cogency it\nappears at first sight to possess.\nFirst of all, there must always be an alternative source from\nwhich the medium might draw the information, allowing, of course,\nthe use of telepathy and clairvoyance. The characteristics to be\nevidential must be verifiable ; it follows, therefore, that the infor-\nmation concerning them must be in the possession of some one\nliving or else recorded somewhere. A more detailed discussion of\nthis point may be postponed until mental phenomena are under\ndiscussion. Secondly, the evidential characteristics are all repro-\nductions, the original having presumably been destroyed by death.\nNow there are in existence several agencies of reproduction, e.g. an\nartist can reproduce a face, as in a picture, photography can be\nemployed for the same end or to reproduce fingerprints, hand-\nwriting can be imitated by a forger, voice and gesture by a clever\nmimic.\n\f108 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nOn. the assumption that such phenomena occur it cannot be\ndenied that the medium has the power to produce teleplasm in the\nform of faces, for she actually does do so, just as an artist has the\npower to produce pictures of faces. If the teleplasm can take the\nform of a face it can presumably take the form of any face. If the\nmedium can make the imprint of a hand, other than her own,\nappear on a mould, she can presumably form that imprint how she\npleases. We have no idea of the mechanism employed and there\nmay be conditions which limit the medium's powers in this matter,\nbut we cannot legitimately use our ignorance of the conditions as\npremises in an argument to establish a definite proposition, i.e. the\nagency of a surviving personality.\nThere is one further point. All these characteristics originally\ndepended on a highly complex arrangement of the skin, muscles,\nnerves, etc., of the living body of the deceased person. This arrange-\nment was broken up at death and the material scattered. In order\nto be reproduced this material must be reassembled in its original\nform or a facsimile made out of other material. Is there any reason\nfor holding that the person who originally owned that body is the\nonly or even the most likely agent who could do this reassembling ?\nI am inclined to think that this is not so.\nThose about me must have a much greater familiarity with my\nfacial appearance than I have myself, my habitual gestures are\nlargely unconscious, and I doubt very much whether I should not\nexperience surprise at hearing my voice on a gramophone. I\ncertainly should not recognise my own fingerprint. As regards\nhandwriting the case is different. I myself am much more familiar\nwith my own writing than anyone else can be, but my familiarity\nis with the appearance of it, not with the mechanism of its pro-\nduction, which is largely unconscious. This may be an individual\npeculiarity of my own, but I find that if I purposely think of the\nmovements of my hand in signing my name I almost invariably\nmake a bad signature, also that when writing normally my thoughts\nare concentrated on the matter about which I am writing, and not\nat all on the formation of the letters. The experience of others may\npossibly be different in this matter.\nWere it possible for me to use an unfamiliar mechanism, such as\nthe organism of a medium, I see no reason to suppose that my\nhandwriting would be unchanged. In actual fact we know that\nlesion of the nerves or muscles of the writing hand may cause\ncomplete change in the writing. It seems to me that there are\nweighty\/arguments against the proposition that the agency which\nenables the medium to reproduce these characteristics of a deceased\nhuman being is the surviving consciousness of that person. That\nconsciousness would probably not possess the requisite knowledge.\n\f122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 109\nThe only hypothesis which, in my opinion, renders it at all plausible\nis the theosophical theory of \" etheric doubles \". These are said\nto be exact replicas of the material body constructed of some\nrarefied material stuff, called ether : they persist for some time after\nphysical death and can be partially revitalised.\nI must not give space to go further into the details of this theory\nbut will simply point out that there is, so far as I know, not one jot\nof reliable independent evidence of the existence of etheric doubles,\nand that to create ad hoc an entirely new type of entity solely for\nthe purpose of bolstering up an otherwise wobbly hypothesis is\nlogically inadmissible. As a result of these considerations I conclude\nthat the evidence for survival derivable from any of the types of\nphysical phenomena here mentioned is of the slightest description ;\nit amounts to no more than a suggestion.\nI turn now to the mental phenomena.\nThese consist in the communication by the medium of in-\nformation not normally accessible to him, or the reproduction or\ndescription of psychological characteristics of some personality alien\nto him.\nSeeing that the hypothesis of survival postulates the continued\nexistence of the personality of the deceased and that personality\nimplies some continuity of memory and psychological character-\nistics, the objections raised in the discussion on physical phenomena\ndo not apply. If the possibility of direct communication between\nmind and mind, as in telepathy, is admitted, there is no logical\nobjection to holding that the agency which enables the medium to\nproduce these phenomena is the surviving personality. It would\nhave the requisite knowledge.\nWe can subdivide the mental phenomena into two types, viz., the\ngiving of information and the reproduction of psychological char-\nacteristics. Information can be of past, present or future events,\npsychological characteristics can be either forms of thought, which\nwould include habitual associations of ideas, or forms of speech.\nDescription of mental and moral characteristics would, of course,\nbe included under the heading of information. Consider first\ninformation.\nThe argument for survival would be somewhat as follows. The\nmedium exhibits knowledge normally inaccessible to him ; we\nadmit the possibility of telepathy by means of which information\ncan be transferred direct from mind to mind and that the deceased\npossessed the requisite knowledge ; therefore if consciousness\nsurvives, it would be a possible source from which the medium\nderived the information. Provided there is no other possible\nsource, it follows that mind, or some fragment of mind such as\nmemory, survives death.\n\f110 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nIn my report on the Warren Elliott sittings (Proceedings, xxxix.\n172 ff.), I put forward my reasons for not accepting the theory that\nwhat, if anything, survives is only the memory or a fragment of\nthe memory of the deceased. It is unnecessary to repeat these\nhere, and I will assume that the theory is rejected.\nIt is obvious that the proviso as to other possible sources of the\ninformation is the crux of the whole argument.\nNow it is logically impossible to prove a negative in such matters,\nfor to do so one would need a thorough knowledge of all possibility,\nwhich is equivalent to omniscience. The most we could do is to\nshow that no other possibility is actually known and that it is\nunlikely that, did it exist, it would be overlooked.\nIn actual fact other possible sources of the information must\nalways, from the nature of the case, be available. For the facts to\nbe evidential must be verifiable, that is to say, the information\nmust be capable of being checked from some independent source\nand could, therefore, have been derived from that source.\nA strong case for survival, however, could still be made out if it\ncould be shown that derivation from this alternative source was\nunlikely. The strength of the case would then depend on the\ndegree of unlikeliness. It should, however, be noted that there is\nanother hypothesis covering the facts which does not appear to\nimply survival in the usual sense. This is based on the suggested\nrelaxation of the temporal conditions under which some strata of\nthe minds of the sitter or medium function. For example, the\nspecious present of the subconsciousness might cover a much longer\nperiod than that of the normal supraliminal consciousness and\nextend back into the past over a considerable period of \" time \".\nThis hypothesis is of a somewhat speculative nature, and what\nevidence there is in support of any arguments for or against it, also\nall consequences arising from its acceptance, come rather within\nthe province of psychology and metaphysics than of psychical\nresearch. It will therefore be left aside.\nLet us leave information concerning the past until the other two\nclasses have been discussed.\nIt is pretty clear that information concerning present events,\neven if normally inaccessible to the medium, can by itself afford no\nproof of survival. If the information be verifiable then there must\neither be some spectators of the events and telepathy from them\ncould account for the facts, or else subsequent observation must\nenable us to infer their occurrence. In this latter case, i.e. where\nthere were no actual spectators, the fact that the events were\nknown to the medium implies the exercise of some sort of clairvoyant\nfaculty on the part of some one. I do not see that there is any\nstrong reason for supposing it to be more likely that such a faculty\n\f122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? HI\nshould be possessed by the surviving consciousness of a deceased\nperson than by a consciousness still functioning through a physical\nbody. We have a certain amount of fairly good evidence of living\npersons exercising clairvoyance, while we know nothing of the\npowers of the hypothetical surviving consciousness.\nIt is, however, perhaps possible to bring forward some rather\nspeculative arguments in support of the theory that operating\nthrough a physical organism limits the powers of the psychical\nentity which is the true man, and that, therefore, one might expect\nthat a disembodied mind would exhibit wider powers than one\nembodied.\nEven if this were admitted, it would not prove that the disem-\nbodied mind had ever been embodied and had survived physical\ndeath. Clairvoyance would not be evidence of survival but only of\nspirit agency.\nAs regards prediction, except in cases of prediction based on\ninference from the past, it is so difficult to form any idea of how\nthis can be possible that even if the fact were established little use\ncould be made of it as a datum. It is a phenomenon so inexplicable,\nso utterly out of joint with the rest of our experience, that it stands\nalone ; we cannot establish connections between it and any other\nphenomenon.\nIt might perhaps be argued with some show of reason that the\ntemporal conditions governing a disembodied mind must be less\nrigid than those under which an embodied mind functions, but this\nwould not prove that the source of the prediction is a surviving\nhuman consciousness, but only that it is a disembodied one. Pre-\ndiction by inference from past or present events is a phenomenon\nwith which we are well acquainted. It is a power possessed by\nliving men and rests on well known logical grounds. It may be\nsuggested that the apparently supernormal predictions which we\nassume to have been made by the medium are due to an extended\nknowledge of the data and a heightened power of inference. But\nhere again there is little reason for ascribing these wider faculties to\ndisembodied rather than to embodied minds, and none whatever\nfor holding that the disembodied minds, if they exist, are neces-\nsarily those of deceased human beings.\nThe utmost we can say, then, is that supernormal knowledge of\npresent or future events may possibly suggest, but does not prove,\nspirit agency, while affording no evidence of survival.\nLet us now turn to the case where the medium gives information\nconcerning past events, knowledge of which was definitely inacces-\nsible to him and was definitely known to have been in the possession\nof the deceased person. Provided that means of communication\nwith the medium exist, the surviving mind of the deceased is a\n\f112 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\npossible source of the information. We have to assume telepathy,\nor something like it. We have good evidence that telepathy occurs\nbetween living persons, and it is not a very great extension to hold\nthat there may be direct communication between an embodied and\na disembodied mind.\nBut where the information is in the possession of a living person\nan explanation of the phenomenon not requiring even this extension\nis always available as an alternative to the survival hypothesis.\nThe question of psychical linkage is of importance in this con-\nnection and it is on this point that the value of evidence for survival\nturns. If the living person who possesses the knowledge is the actual\nsitter there is an obvious link with the medium, they are already in\nnormal communication, and telepathy may be assumed to occur\nbetween them. Information concerning facts within the knowledge\nof the sitter is, then, of little value as evidence for survival.\nWhere the knowledge necessary for verification is not in the\npossession of the sitter but is acquired subsequently from other\nsources, the evidence for survival may be considerably stronger.\nIt turns on the question of the probability of the necessary con-\nnecting links between the medium and the possessor of the know-\nledge. If this linkage is very complex, very unlikely to occur, then\nit might be argued that the balance of probability lies on the side of\nthe survival hypothesis. In this hypothesis we assume that the\nconscious mind persists after physical death, retaining some part\nof its normal memory and of its psychical characteristics, also that\nit has some power of communication with embodied minds. We\nmust also assume that it is to some extent cognisant of, and inter-\nested in, the doings of persons still living on earth. The fact,\ntherefore, that a relative or friend has a sitting with a medium could\nconstitute the requisite link between the surviving mind and those\npresent at the sitting. The linkage is simple and direct, corre-\nsponding, mutatis mutandis, to that between the sitter and the\nmedium.\nOn the other hand the linkage between the medium and the\nliving source of verification may be complex and indirect. Suppose,\nfor example, that the medium makes a statement which purports\nto be derived from the memory of a deceased person, none of the\nsitters can verify it, and inquiry among friends produces no results ;\nthen, by a series of unlikely and unpredictable coincidences, the\nsitter becomes acquainted with a stranger who in the past had\nknown the deceased and obtains the desired verification from him.\nThe stranger had no knowledge of the sitting taking place nor of\nany persons connected with it.\nNow unless we are prepared to credit the medium, the sitter or\nthe stranger or some person en route between them, with what\n\f122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 113\namounts to potential omniscience, we have to postulate a very\ncomplex and unlikely series of links to account for the phenomenon.\nIf we hold that the mind of the medium goes out, as it were, in\nsearch of information and invades the memories of living persons,\nwe still have to explain the fact that he discovered this hidden\nsource. He had the whole world in which to search and nothing to\nguide him, or at least, that is how it appears to us with our very\nlimited, almost non-existent knowledge of the conditions.\nIf, on the other hand, we hold that the telepathic impulse arises\nfrom the agent\u2014in this case the stranger\u2014we still have to explain\nhow he came to know that the sitting was taking place, what\ndirected his telepathic faculty to the medium and determined him\nto send that particular message at that particular moment.\nThe value of such phenomena as evidence for survival depends,\nthen, on the relation between the probabilities of the two alternative\nexplanations, and this is a matter in which it seems that each\nindividual must exercise his own judgment. Estimates of the\nprobabilities will vary immensely. For example, anyone who had\nalready espoused the Behaviourist creed would place the probability\nof survival at almost nil, thus prejudging the whole case, while those\nwho preserve an open mind on the matter will vary very much\namong themselves according to their dispositions, desires, and so\non. Thus it seems to follow that to some people evidence of this\nkind would appear to afford extremely high probability of survival,\nfor others it will give no more than a suggestion.\nThis arises from the fact that the value of the evidence is a\nfunction of two independent variables, for one of which, viz. the\nprobability of the necessary linkage between the medium and the\nsource of the verification, there may be substantial agreement,\nwhile for the other, viz. the probability of survival and the other\nassumptions necessary for the application of that hypothesis,\nestimates will vary to an almost unlimited degree, these estimates\ndepending on individual idiosyncrasy. This analysis appears to me\nto account for the extraordinary difference in the interpretations\nplaced on the same set of facts by equally competent and honest\nthinkers.\nI want to make this point quite clear, as I think it is important.\nIf psychical phenomena could afford crucial proof of survival there\nwould be nothing more to be said once we had satisfied ourselves as\nto the validity of the proof. But, as I have endeavoured to show,\nthis is not the case, the best we can expect is a probability, more or\nless strong.\nNow the plausibility of any hypothesis is measured by the ratio\nbetween its probability and that of the various possible alterna-\ntives.\n\f114 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nWe have, therefore, in the balance the psychical evidence affording\na certain probability to the survival hypothesis, but we have also\nin the scales all arguments for and against survival derived from\nother sources, also all our preconceived notions, our desires, hopes,\nfears and prejudices.\nThus it may be that the psychical evidence has to force its way\nagainst overwhelming obstacles.\nThere is another possible explanation which must also be borne\nin mind, viz. the possibility of the information having been conveyed\ntelepathically by the deceased person prior to his death to some\nother person, possibly the sitter, in whose subconscious mind it has\nlain latent until drawn therefrom by the medium. Though this\nother person were subconsciously aware of the facts, knowledge of\nthem would never rise into his normal consciousness ; for verifi-\ncation, therefore, another source would have to be depended upon.\nOur knowledge of the possibilities of the subconscious is so\nlimited that it is impossible to form any estimate of the probability\nof this explanation in any particular case. All we can say is that it\nis theoretically possible. In such cases as that known as the\nChafhn Will case, this alternative must be considered. If a sealed\nenvelope containing a message is deposited before death and the\ncontents correctly given in a purporting communication from the\ndeceased writer, one could explain the facts by this hypothesis of\nlatency. If the message were in cypher and the keyword nowhere\nactually recorded, the translation of the message would appear at\nfirst sight to constitute almost irrefragable evidence, for the\nverification would depend on the success of the translation. Such a\ncase, which so far as I know has never yet happened, would, it is\ntrue, bar out clairvoyance on the part of the medium or sitter but\nwould not exclude the latency hypothesis.\nCommunication of the whereabouts of objects hidden by the\ndeceased prior to death could also be explained on these lines ; in\nfact once we admit the possibility of knowledge remaining latent in\nthe subconsciousness and being somehow conveyed to the medium,\nno evidence based on past history can be held to point conclusively\nto survival.\nTo make the tale complete we must also take into account the\npossibility of clairvoyance on the part of the medium or sitter.\nWhere the information is recorded in writing, where actual physical\nfacts exist which could convey it or from which it might be deduced,\nit is always possible to attribute the medium's acquisition of the\nknowledge to clairvoyance. Here again our knowledge of the\nnature, conditions and limitations of clairvoyance is so small that\nwe can form no estimate of the plausibility of this hypothesis ; we\ncan only say that there is some evidence which seems to point to\n\f122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 115\nthe occasional existence of the clairvoyant faculty. The question of\nlinkage is, however, of importance and may in certain cases establish\nan antecedent improbability against the clairvoyance hypothesis.\nUnless we are prepared to equate the clairvoyant faculty to \" the\nall-seeing eye \" we have to give some account of what turned the\nmedium's clairvoyant attention in the right direction. The faculty\nmay exist and the physical fact may be there, but there must be\nsome linkage to bring them together. This linkage may be as\ncomplex and inherently unlikely as was seen possible in the case\nof verification by \" the stranger \". Such linkage would reduce very\nmuch the probability of clairvoyance as an alternative explanation.\nThe position, therefore, seems to be that in all cases where the\nevidence consists of communication of information concerning the\npast there are always at least two alternatives to the survival\ntheory, first, the medium may derive the information from the\nsource whence verification ultimately comes either by telepathy or\nclairvoyance ;\nsecond, the information may have been conveyed\ntelepathically before death to some person in whose subconscious\nmemory it has lain latent until emerging at the sitting. The\nrespective probabilities of all possible explanations are extremely\ndifficult, if not impossible, to estimate even very roughly. It seems\nto follow that, even if we do get evidence for survival, we can never\nknow how strong or how weak it is.\nA word about cross-correspondences. These, even in their\nideally perfect form, can only afford evidence of a source extraneous\nto one of the mediums employed, and perhaps of a definite purpose\nor plan. It is a bare theoretical possibility that the subconsciousness\nof one of the mediums is the source, but it appears more likely that\nthe messages originate from some independent mind. There is,\nhowever, nothing to indicate whether this mind is embodied or\ndisembodied. It may, of course, be that the matter of the message\ngives a clue to the identity of the author, but this is nothing to do\nwith the cross-correspondence as such.\nWe may now turn to the other type of mental phenomena, viz.\nreproduction or description of psychological characteristics. It is\nhere that we may hope to find the most convincing, if not the most\nlogically conclusive, evidence for survival.\nApart from the prima facie recognition of physical appearance,\nwe know our friends mainly by their psychological characteristics,\nin fact, these, together with memory, may be said to constitute the\nperson.\nNow where a medium consistently reproduces the psychological\ncharacteristics of a deceased person this fact undoubtedly carries a\nconsiderable weight, though, of course, the fact that these charac-\nteristics are recognisable shows that a knowledge of them is\n\f116 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\npossessed by some living person. The necessity for the evidence to\nbe verified carries with it all the same inherent weakness for this\ntype of phenomenon as in other cases.\nThere are two sides of the matter to be considered. First, the\nmedium's power to reproduce. We know from normal experience\nthat a clever actor or mimic can give a convincing reproduction of\nanother person. As a rule we know very little of the medium's\npowers as an actor, more particularly so when we bear in mind that\nwe have to take into account subconscious as well as conscious\npowers. Here again we have an apparently insuperable difficulty\nin estimating probabilities.\nThe second side of the matter is the nature of the information.\nThis is far more nebulous and indefinite than in the case of informa-\ntion concerning past, present or future events. From this it arises\nthat verification is less certain, also that the conviction which is\ncarried is to a large extent subjective and individual.\nI might feel that the reproduction was convincing, but another\nperson who had not known the deceased so well or had known\nanother side of his character, might feel very differently. My\nconviction then is subjective and incommunicable ;\nyou can only\ntake my word for it.\nHowever, were a large number of independent competent\nobservers of separate cases to be convinced, this objection would be\nto a great extent overcome ; we could not suppose that so many\npeople would honestly make the same mistake, and we should be\nbound to accept their testimony. This, however, affects only the\nquestion of recognition, not that of the source of the information.\nIt cannot be repeated too often that our almost complete lack of\nknowledge of the nature of telepathy and clairvoyance, of their\nconditions and limitations, is sufficient of itself to introduce a very\ngreat weakness, from the logical point of view, into all our arguments.\nIt is like trying to solve an equation which contains two independent\nunknowns.\nWe may make the assumption that there is some analogy between\ntelepathy and normal communication, though there is very little\nto support such an assumption.\nIf we assume this we can say that communication of definite\ninformation of past or present facts would be easier than of psycho-\nlogical characteristics. I could in a short conversation give another\nperson information concerning many facts of the past history of a\ndeceased friend, but it would require a very much longer description\nto enable even a first-class actor to give a convincing reproduction\nof his psychological characteristics. It is probable that this\nassumption is always tacitly made to some extent, and it thus\narises that evidence of this kind carries with it a greater feeling of\n\fIs Proof of Survival Possible ? 117\nconviction than mere information concerning facts of history, but\nuntil the grounds of the assumption are established it remains an\nopen question whether the conviction is justified.\nOf the two varieties of psychological characteristics mentioned,\nknowledge of habitual forms of speech would be easier to convey\ntelepathically, hence evidence of this nature is of somewhat lower\nvalue. Habitual forms of thought and association of ideas are one\nof the most individual characteristics of any person, and it seems to\nme that if a large number of instances of reproductions of this\nnature by mediums under good evidential conditions could be\ncollected, a fairly strong presumptive case for survival might be\nestablished, though it would fall far short of logical conclusiveness\nand the conviction it carried would vary widely with each individual.\nFor the sake of completeness a brief mention of certain spon-\ntaneous phenomena must be made.\nPhantasms of the living, taken by themselves, would appear to\nhave little or no direct bearing on the question of survival, although\nas forming an important part of the evidence of communion between\nmind and mind independent of the normal sensory channels, they\nmay help to refute the hypothesis of the physical nature of mind\nand thus remove a serious a priori obstacle to acceptance of sur-\nvival.\nPhantasms of the dead appear at first sight to form the basis of\na fairly strong argument for survival, which might be stated some-\nwhat as follows. It is found that phantasms of the living tend to\noccur with greater frequency when the person whose phantasm\nappears is in a state of crisis ; it is probable, therefore, that such a\nstate is an efficient factor in the production of a phantasm. If this\nbe so the agency lies to some extent with the person whose phantasm\nappears.\nWhen phantasms of the dead appear, if we may assume that the\nconditions of production are the same, the agency of the deceased\nis a requisite part of the phenomenon and such agency may be held\nto imply survival.\nIt is obvious that a weak part of this argument is the assumption\nthat the conditions of production of a phantasm of the dead are the\nsame as those of one of the living ; our knowledge of the mechanism\nis so slight that it is impossible to say if this assumption is justifiable.\nAlso it might be objected that the agency required for the pro-\nduction of a phantasm does not necessarily involve the activity of\nany factor inherent in personality. As a general rule, in cases of\nphantasms of the living, the part played by the agent is a quite\nunconscious one so far as we know. Moreover there is an even\ngreater weakness arising from the possibility of latency ; the\npercipient may have received the impression while the agent was\n\f118 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nstill alive and it may have remained latent in the subconsciousness\nuntil a favourable opportunity for emergence occurred. The fact\nthat the frequency of phantasms decreases rapidly from the time\nof death of the agent seems to point to this explanation.\nIt is sometimes claimed that death-bed visions form a peculiarly\nevidential type of this class of case, but it seems, a priori, that a\ndying person can hardly be considered as good a witness as one in\ngood health. There appears some ground for thinking that the\ndying are rather more than normally suggestible, and the unques-\ntionable fact that there is a widespread expectation of death-bed\nvisions renders it probable that such will frequently occur, though\nthey may be entirely subjective in character.\nAmong certain classes of the population it is thought to be only\nright and proper that the dying person should have visions of heaven\nand of their departed friends and relatives. When an expectation\nwith so strong a sentiment attached impinges on a person in a\nhighly suggestible state, it is small wonder that it is fulfilled.\nIt is sometimes stated that these death-bed visions consist only\nof persons already dead, and where there is included among those\nseen someone of whose death the percipient is normally unaware,\nthis is held to be evidence of the agency and hence survival of that\nperson. But I suggest that there is no evidence that death-bed\nvisions consist solely of persons already dead. In fact, there are\ncases of a dying mother apparently seeing her living children. That\nthey should mainly so consist, I consider sufficiently explained by\nthe strong pre-existing expectation.\nWhere information not normally known to the percipient is\nconveyed by the phantasm then the case becomes subject to the\nsame criticisms and rules as where the information is communicated\nthrough a medium and its evidential value must be assessed accord-\ningly. The value is not affected by the fact that the percipient is\ndying.\nWere a perfectly satisfactory poltergeist case to occur we might\nargue therefrom the existence of an extraneous agency, but there\nis nothing to indicate or even suggest that that agency is or ever\nwas human. Where a haunt exhibits human characteristics it\nmight be thought that the surviving mind was implicated in the\nagency. Here again, however, our ignorance of the conditions is\nso profound that no valid argument can be established.\nThere remain two further points to be considered. First, whether\nany combination of the various types of phenomena would afford\nmore conclusive evidence than when taken separately ;\nsecond, the\n\" faggot theory \".\nNow I think that there is little doubt that were a medium to give\ninformation known to have been in the possession of a deceased\n\f122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 119\nperson and verifiable only by means of a complex series of linkages,\nand at the same time to reproduce the psychological and perhaps\nsome of the physical characteristics of the same deceased person,\nthe evidence would be as strong as it is possible to get. If we accept\nthe survival hypothesis we have one single though possibly internally\ncomplex explanation of all the facts ; if we reject it we have to\nassume the combination of several separate explanations. Even if\nwe estimate the probability of survival at a lower figure than that\nof any of the events involved in the alternative explanations the\ncombined probability of these latter may very likely be considerably\nless.\nIn simple cases probabilities are combined by mulitplication, so\nthat supposing that we had on one side a single explanation with\nprobability 1\/100, and on the other three combined events with each\na probability of 1\/10, we should get a final ratio of 1\/100 for the\nsingle explanation to 1\/1000 for the combined.\nHowever, the case under discussion is not so simple as this and\nthe combination of probabilities would not be by plain multipli-\ncation, because we do not know how far the various alternative\nhypotheses are independent of each other ; for example, the\nreception of a telepathic message from some living person giving\ninformation of past events with which the ostensible communicator\nwas concerned may, of itself, strengthen the rapport between that\nperson and the medium and thus render the transmission of infor-\nmation concerning the physical and psychological characteristics\neasier. Thus supposing the independent probability of telepathy\nfrom the living person concerning the past is 1\/m, and concerning\npsychical characteristics \\ jn, after rapport has been established by\nthe first telepathic message the probability ljn may become Ijn-x.\nWe do not know that this actually is so but it is possible.\nWe have two separate difficulties : in the first place we cannot\nform any reliable estimates of the individual probabilities, in the\nsecond we do not know the formula for their combination. It seems\ntherefore that though a case such as described, if it could be found,\nwould give apparently strong evidence, we cannot say how strong it\nwould be.\nThe faggot theory is that while an isolated case may afford but\nslender support for the survival theory, the whole bulk of cases\ntaken together supplies evidence of almost irresistible strength, the\nanalogy being, of course, with the weakness of a single stick as\ncompared with the strength of a faggot.\nWhen all the cases are of a similar nature this theory is, I think,\ndemonstrably false. We are not dealing here with the probability\nof a certain event happening or not happening ; had this been the\npoint at issue, multiplication of examples would have been relevant.\n\f120 H. F. Saltmarsh [part\nThe accumulation of masses of evidence is desirable for the purpose\nof establishing the existence of the phenomena, but it does not help\nin the interpretation when it is all of the same kind.\nIn putting forward an hypothesis we are ascribing an event\nwhich has actually happened to one particular cause among alter-\nnative possible causes. The probability of this explanation being\ncorrect is a function of the combined probabilities of the etiological\nfactors which have gone to produce the event, and is the same\nwhether it occurs only once or a hundred times. It is on the ratio\nof this probability to that of the other possible alternatives that\nthe plausibility of the hypothesis rests. Where the evidence is not\nall of a similar nature the case is not quite so simple, but even here\nthe faggot theory fails to afford the increase of strength which is\nclaimed for it by some of its supporters.\nSuppose we have four alternative possible causes for an event\nand that the probability is the same for each, say 1\/4, then, whatever\nnumber of similar cases we have, any selected cause will have a\nplausibility represented by the fraction 1\/4. But if out of one\nhundred such cases there are reasons for excluding two out of the\nalternatives in 20 instances and the probability of the remaining\ntwo remains equal, the combined probability of either of them over\nthe whole number of cases becomes 3\/10, for in the 80 cases the\nmost probable number of times we should expect to find the selected\ncause is 80 x 1\/4 = 20, in the remaining 20 cases it is 20 x \\ = 10,\nthus giving in all 30 times in 100 = probability 3\/10.\nThis is a slight accession of strength, but far short of that claimed\nby the faggot theory ;\nmoreover, it applies equally well to the other\ncause which remained in the 20 cases.\nOne can imagine circumstances when the multiplication of the\nnumber of cases would increase the plausibility of the survival\nhypothesis to a very great extent, but these are always instances of\ncompetition between a single and relatively simple hypothesis\nwhich will cover all the facts of every case without stretching and\na series of more or less complex combinations of alternative ex-\nplanations, combinations moreover which differ each from the\nother and require a variety of chance coincidences to bring them\nabout.\nThe following is an attempt to represent the matter symbolically.\nLet there be a number of alternative possible causes, A, B, C, D,\nand assume that the relative probabilities of each are known.\nWhen the case stands thus : Either A ,\nB, C or D, then the\nnumber of instances has no effect on the strength of the evidence.\nExample : Suppose that^a medium gives me some information\nwhich could not have been normally acquired and I can account for\nit either by the survival hypothesis or by telepathy from the living\n\f122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 121\nor by clairvoyance on the part of the medium, then however many\ntimes this happens it will not affect the strength of the evidence for\nany of the alternative explanations.\nWhen it stands :\nn cases either A, B, C or D\nnx ,, \u201e A, C or D\nn2 \u201e \u201e A,BotD,\nand so on, the strength of the evidence is somewhat increased in\nthe manner shown in the example given above.\nExample : Suppose I have a number of cases of supernormal\ninformation as above and I can account for some of them either by\nsurvival or by telepathy or by clairvoyance, but for others telepathy\nis barred out, while for the rest clairvoyance is not available as an\nalternative, then the strength of the evidence for survival is slightly\nincreased by the increase of the number of cases.\nWhen it stands : Either A or B and 0 and D combined in the\nsame way, the number of instances has no effect on the strength of\nthe evidence.\nExample : Suppose that I have a number of cases and they can\nall be explained either by survival or else by telepathy combined\nwith clairvoyance in a certain manner, then the number of cases\nhas no effect on the strength of the evidence.\nBut when it stands :\nn cases either A or xB and yC and zD\nnx ,, ,, A or xx\nB and y-fi and z^D\n\u00bb2 j, A or x%\nB and y2C and z2\nD\nwhere x, xv y, yv etc., stand for different modes of combination,\nchance coincidence, assumptions, stretchings and variations of\nhypothesis in different directions, then the theory holds good and\nthe strength of the evidence for A is increased.\nExample : Suppose that all of the cases can be explained by\nsurvival, some of them alternatively by a combination of telepathy\nand clairvoyance involving certain coincidences, others by a\ndifferent combination of telepathy and clairvoyance involving\nother coincidences, and so on, then the increase of the number of\ncases may, if they are all different, largely increase the strength of\nthe evidence for survival.\nBut in this, as elsewhere, until we have put definite estimates on\nthe various probabilities involved, we cannot say what the increase\namounts to. The conclusion, then, to which I arrive from this\nanalysis is that no logical proof of survival is at present possible\nfrom the evidence studied by psychical research, though I particu-\nlarly do not desire to be dogmatic and say that it will never be\n\f122 H. F. Saltmarsh [PART 122]\npossible. A fairly strong presumptive case might conceivably be\nmade out were the evidence to be forthcoming in a sufficiently\nperfect state, but owing to the difficulties in estimating the prob-\nabilities of the various alternatives, no agreement as to its actual\nstrength is likely to be reached ; conviction will be, and seems\nlikely to remain, completely subjective and dependent on individual\nidiosyncrasy. It is conceivable, however, that a case might occur\nwhere the probability of the hypotheses alternative to survival was\nobviously and incontestably so infinitesimally minute that the\nunlikeliness of any of these hypotheses being correct could only be\novercome by absolute disproof of survival, which, as we have seen,\nis not forthcoming.\nI do not at present know of such a case, but if one could be found\nit would be sheer prejudice and obstinacy to withhold a provisional\nacceptance of some form of survival. It should be noted that such\nacceptance can only be provisional and subject to withdrawal,\nbecause it is always possible that some ingenious sceptic may\nsometime discover a totally fresh alternative hypothesis which will\naccount for the facts in a more plausible manner.\n\fII. ON THE DIFFICULTY OF PROVING\nINDIVIDUAL SURVIVAL.\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\nI was not able to be present when Mr Saltmarsh read his Paper.\nHe sets out clearly the many alternative hypotheses that could be\nsaid to account for certain kinds of experience. Proof after all is a\nquestion of probabilities. I do not suppose that a sledge-hammer\nproof which knocks down all opposing theories and finally exter-\nminates them is ever attainable by us, even in physics. It has\noccasionally happened that a theory has been adopted and has held\nthe field for nearly a century, and yet has been modified at the end\nand incorporated with some opposition theory which had seemed\nextinct. What we need in science is a working hypothesis that we\ncan test, getting results from it that we can verify, until ultimately\nits probability becomes so great that we may have confidence in it\nas an approach to certainty.\nIf we grant the possession by a medium of an extensive faculty\nfor telepathy and clairvoyance, no record of the past is safe from\nthe application of those powers. Yet there is a limit to our credulity\nin those directions, and, after time and much experience, one may\nfeel that our only escape from accepting the straightforward appear-\nance is to strain the alternative hypothesis unduly. An extensive\nfaculty of clairvoyance can hardly be attributed to an extension\nof the normal faculty of the medium without the intervention of\nsome other intelligence, of whose activity many phenomena contain\nmore than an indication : and I think Mr Saltmarsh would agree\nthat the amount of evidence available for establishing the existence\nand activity of some intelligence, other than that of incarnate\nhumanity, may be said to amount to proof. But as he points out,\nthis does not establish the activity of any specified individual.\nWhat we have established, I consider, is the existence of a\nspiritual world. To establish personal identity in connexion with\nsuch a world is a more difficult problem. The faculty of reading a\nclosed book can hardly be attributed to the powers of a person\nencased in the flesh and using his bodily sense-organs : it involves\nsomething more. And so does the perception of a bodily apparition\nor representation of some deceased person. The Ancients used to\nattribute an apparition or phantasm, not to the person immediately\n123\n\f124 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nrepresented, but to a messenger from the gods, who could put on\nthe appearance of that person for the purpose of conveying a\nmessage. Witness the legend of Ceyx and Alcyone in the Eleventh\nBook of Ovid's \" Metamorphoses,\" where Morpheus impersonates\nthe dead husband, and gives a message to his sorrowing wife.\nIt becomes therefore a question which can legitimately be asked\nwhether any plan can be devised whereby personal identity can be\nproven, or at least rendered more probable as an explanation than\nany other hypothesis that can be suggested. Anticipation of the\nfuture has been suggested ; but that is more than we ought to\nexpect from any deceased relative of our own. The power may\nsometimes be exhibited, but it suggests a knowledge more likely to\nbe attained by some intelligence who has had time and opportunity\nto go beyond common experience, and to transcend any powers\npossessed by ordinary humanity.\nThe point or crux about which Mr Saltmarsh raises the difficulty\nis the establishment of the personal identity of some quite ordinary\nperson. Facts in his life, or documents recorded by him in the\npast, would seem to be useless, since they can be arrived at or\ndeciphered by other means. I want to ask therefore whether there\nare any steps that could be taken by, say, an individual member of\nthe S.P.R., interested in the subject, and anxious to do his best to\nprove his own survival, that would be accepted by Mr Saltmarsh,\nor any other experienced critic, as conclusive, or as raising the\nprobability in favour of that view to so high a degree that for all\npractical purposes it amounts to certainty.\nLet me therefore take an imaginary case, and see what flaws can\nbe found in it. The test most approved seems to be some personal\nhabit or idiosyncrasy, not too well known or capable of imitation,\nand preferably not known at all, but recorded by the individual\nbefore his death in such a way that the record can be deciphered\nafterwards and be accepted as reasonable. Suppose for instance\nthat a person whom I will call A has had an obsession since childhood\nof some absurd childish verse or short poem, which has frequently\nrecurred to him throughout life, but which, being entirely frivolous,\nhas never been spoken about or mentioned to a soul, the insignifi-\ncance of it being such that A is rather ashamed of it than otherwise,\nand sees no meaning in mentioning it. The supposed poem or\nverse must be quite meaningless, not forming any part of daily\nlife, and not having the least interest even for himself, but yet one\nwhich has been so frequently recalled as to be permanently ingrained\nin his memory, so that he may hope to remember it sufficiently to\nrecall it in full detail even after he has lost his bodily organs and\npassed through the transition called death ;\nassuming, as we are\nbound to, that such a state of things is any way feasible, for if we\n\f122] On the Difficulty of Proving Individual Survival 125\nstart with, the initial impossibility, no proof can be given us.\nSuppose further that A has sufficient sense to perceive that the\nmere recital of the poem as recorded in his posthumous document\nwould not suffice ; for it would have to be assumed that a medium\ncould read that, even in a closed envelope. Let us suppose therefore\nthat he takes pains to enter into further detail, having had a lifelong\nopportunity of doing so. He has noticed, let us say, that the verse\ncontains seventeen words of one syllable, nine words of two\nsyllables, four words of three syllables, and one of four ; and that as\na preliminary he gives through several mediums hereafter the\nmeaningless jumble of figures 17, 9, 4, 1, and then in due time\namplifies the meaning of these figures, and says what they are\nintended to signify ; and that, foreseeing this attempt that he will\nmake hereafter, he has recorded in his deposited document the\nfact that he will send these figures, and will afterwards expand\ntheir meaning. He might take some further steps, and record why\nor under what circumstances the trivial verse took such a hold on\nhim. It must not be a verse of any importance, or one that\ncould be called a quotation. It might be a portion of a Bab-\nballad, for instance ;\nthough even these are familiar to several\npeople, and are too well known to be suitable. I would rather\nsuppose that the thing he has thus thoroughly memorised is quite\nuninteresting and meaningless, even to himself, that he cannot\nexplain why it has stuck in his memory and been analysed in almost\na physiological manner ; the details of which analysis could hardly\nbe imagined by the most expert clairvoyant, but which nevertheless,\nin the case I am imagining, is to be given through several mediums\nby the person who thus intends to establish his identity, and will\nlikewise be found recorded in the posthumous document that is to\nbe ultimately opened and read.\nIf this experiment could be carried out thoroughly, both by the\ndeceased person who thinks the object sufficient to justify him in\ntaking all that trouble, and by the survivors who have been\nentrusted with the document and who must be supposed to act\nwisely,\u2014not to be in a hurry, but to wait until they get the assent\nof A himself as to what they think they will find in the deposited\ndocument, before they open it, \u2014then to me the hypothesis that\nthat individual is still functioning, and that the messages really\ncome from him and from no one else, seems to me the only one that\nmeets the case. There may be loopholes for scepticism even in\nsuch an imaginary case as that. It requires rather an exceptional\nconcatenation of circumstances to make the test possible. But if\nthat would not be a proof that would satisfy a reasonable critic,\nthen I don't see how anyone anxious to prove his identity hereafter\ncould proceed with the task.\n\fIII. REPLY TO SIR OLIVER LODGE.\nBy H. F. Saltmarsh.\nBefore making any comment on the imaginary case which Sir\nOliver Lodge suggests, may I first say that I agree that sufficient\nevidence is available to establish as a sound working hypothesis the\nexistence of a spiritual world. Accepting telepathy as a fact and\nholding, as I consider that there is reasonable empirical and theor-\netical grounds to hold, that it is a purely psychical process, it is for\nme a short step from embodied minds functioning in a non-physical\nenvironment to inhabitants, that is to say disembodied minds, in\nthat environment. As regards Sir Oliver's imaginary case, this\nwould, I admit, set up a strong presumptive case for personal\nsurvival, the more so as it exhibits a post-mortem conative factor\nas well as the persistence of memory, thus excluding the hypothesis\nof persistence of mnemic fragments as suggested by Dr Walter\nLeaf and Dr C. D. Broad.\nYet I think that the captious critic might pick holes even in such\na case. For example, it might be pointed out that A planned the\nexperiment before his death and might, therefore, have unconsci-\nously conveyed the information concerning it to someone who has\nsurvived him, in whose subconscious memory it has lain latent until\ndrawn upon by the mediums. I admit that the requisite linkages\nwould be complex and unlikely but not, under favourable circum-\nstances, wildly impossible.\nOr again, in the posthumous document A has recorded his intention\nto give the figures as a preliminary test, and if it were possible for a\nmedium clairvoyantly to read the verse contained in this document,\nthe record of the intention to give the preliminary test could also\nbe read. The verse itself would supply the figures.\nThe ingenious combination of a cross-correspondence~with a\nsealed message case undoubtedly strengthens the evidence, and\nwere the figures to be given at a sitting at which no one connected\nwith A was present and the connection with the A case to arise\nonly in a subsequent comparison of records, I think that the personal\nsurvival hypothesis would show a probability considerably higher\nthan that of the several alternatives.\nThe main point which I wished to bring out in my paper is,\n126\n\f[PART 122] Reply to Sir Oliver Lodge 127\nhowever, that the probability set up by any of the types of psychical\nevidence mentioned is only one factor in establishing the plausibility\nof the survival hypothesis. It has to go into the scales together with\nall sorts of preconceived ideas and prejudices, desires, hopes and\nfears, also arguments and evidence, for and against, based on physical,\npsychological, ethical and religious grounds. The weight of these\nfactors varies with each individual and is as a rule absolutely\nincalculable, besides being by no means constant. It is true, as\nSir Oliver says, that even in physical science sledge-hammer proof\nis unattainable, but the order of magnitude of the probabilities with\nwhich the physicist has to deal is incomparably greater than\nanything we can hope for in psychical research. Probabilities of\nmagnitudes such as 1 to 1040\nor 1060\ncan force their way into the\nmind with almost irresistible force, moreover there is, as a rule, an\nalmost complete absence of any emotional obstacle.\nThus, while whatever my mood I never doubt the Second Law\nof Thermodynamics, I may to-day feel that Sir Oliver's case would\ngive me a substantial assurance of survival, yet to-morrow, if ill\nand depressed, I might be inclined to stress the objections.\nMay I suggest an imaginary case ; it is one which seems to be not\nbeyond the possibility of realisation seeing that very similar\nexperiments have actually been carried out. In order to make it\nclear I will take characters from Dickens.\nSuppose that David Copperfield had a son, whom I will call\nDavid Junior. After his father's death he gets into ostensible\ncommunication with him through a medium and finds that the\ncontents of sealed envelopes can be read.\nHe proposes an experiment to his father and selects twelve\nphotographs of old family friends and relatives. These he hands to\na total stranger who seals them in opaque envelopes. The sealed\nenvelopes are then handed to a second stranger who shuffles them\nand selects one at random. At the next sitting the father is asked\nto give identifying details of the person whose photograph has been\nselected. He says, \" She would not allow donkeys on her green \".\nDavid Junior then opens the envelope and finds the photograph of\nMiss Betsy Trotwood but cannot understand the reference.\nHowever, he inquires among surviving friends of his father and\nlearns from one of them about Miss Trotwood's objection to donkeys\ngoing on the green in front of her house, a fact of which he was\nhimself unaware.\nNow the medium, even if she could by clairvoyance see the\nphotograph in the sealed envelope, could not identify it as Miss\nTrotwood, nor would she know about the donkeys. The only\nliving persons who could identify the photograph would be David\nJunior or some surviving friend of his father.\n\f128 H. F. Saltmarsh [PART 122]\nWhile there is nothing to suggest that any of these possess\nclairvoyant faculty, it is possible that they may do so. One cannot\nprove a negative in such cases, although prolonged experiment\nmight establish a strong probability. Anyhow, David Junior did\nnot know about the donkeys and the friend who supplied the\ninformation had no knowledge of the experiment. The person who\ncould comply with all the conditions would be David Senior.\nI suggest that this would be extremely strong evidence of identity,\nalthough I can find alternative explanations.\nThe message might come from Betsy Trotwood herself or some\nother spiritual personality who knew the circumstances, but owing\nto our almost complete ignorance of the conditions of post-mortem\nexistence, if such there be, we cannot say how far this is probable.\nOr again, David Junior might have clairvoyantly recognised the\nphotograph and, knowing the conditions of the experiment, have\nsubconsciously tapped the mind of his father's surviving friends for\nsome identifying details. And finally there may exist some con-\nditions of which we are totally unaware by means of which a\nknowledge of the past may be obtained by certain supernormally\nendowed persons. Such, for example, as the \" akashic records\n\"\nof the Theosophists.\nMy first alternative, while not definitely proving the survival of\nDavid Senior, implies most probably his survival or that of Betsy\nTrotwood or some of her friends, though the communication might\nhave come from a non-human intelligence masquerading as David\nSenior. The second would require a set of conditions and linkages\nwhich, to my mindr are extremely improbable, while the third is\nsimply explanation of \" ignotum per ignotius \".\nShould such a case be forthcoming, particularly if arising during\nthe course of a long series of communications in which the ostensible\ncommunicator gives evidence of identity of the usual kind and\nbehaves in a manner consistent with the personality purported, I\nshould, as a matter of purely personal conviction, feel myself bound\nto accept the personal survival hypothesis as substantially proved,\nthough always subject to reconsideration in the light of fresh facts.\n\fEVIDENTIAL EXTEACTS FROM SITTINGS WITH\nMRS LEONARD.\nBy the Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman.\nPart I.\nTESTS OF VARIOUS KINDS.\nBy the Rev. W. S. Irving.\nIn venturing to publish the following extracts, mainly taken from\nmy recent sittings with Mrs Leonard, I do so in the hope that they\nwill be of interest not only to other regular Leonard sitters, enabling\nthem to compare their results with mine, but also to that larger\nbody of our members who have no opportunity of having sittings\nof their own with this medium. Except when otherwise stated, the\nextracts are verbatim, save that repetitions are cut out, as also are\nthe continual interjections of \" Wait a bit !\n\", \" Wait a minute !\n\",\nwith which Feda's sentences are interspersed. It would seem as\nthough it were necessary that the flow of material should not be\ninterrupted by pauses, yet the speed with which the material is\ngiven makes it, at times, almost impossible to get it down ; this\ndifficulty is surmounted, therefore, by the continual repetition of\nsentences, which enables us to keep pace with the Communicator,\nand to obtain a complete record of the sitting. To give all these\nrepetitions in a report would be to spoil the even flow of the script\nand to cause confusion.\n1. Booktests and Impressions.\nMy Communicator, Dora, who purports to be my wife and has at\nvarious times given evidence of her identity, claims to be able to go\nto houses with which I am unacquainted, and to get booktests and\nimpressions from those houses. In the first of these extracts, she\nhas gone to the house of Mrs Kingsley Tarpey, where she would\nseem to have been on several occasions before. It is, I think,\nseveral years since I have met Mrs Tarpey, and then I knew nothing\nwhatever about her. She was so kind as to take notes for me once\nat a sitting with Miss McCreadie, though I did not know her name\nat the time, and I have several times seen Mrs Tarpey at the S.P.R.\n129\n\f130 Rev. W. 8. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\nRooms. That is as far as my acquaintance with her goes. I have\nnever been to her flat. Mrs Tarpey has, however, I understand,\nhad some Leonard sittings herself.\nNote by Mrs Kingsley Tarpey, 22 August 1931. \" Neither Mrs\nLeonard nor Mr Irving have ever been to my flat. Mr Irving was\nnot personally known to me, for though I had taken notes for him\nat a sitting with Miss McCreadie, he was anonymous on that\noccasion, and I only heard his name accidentally some months later.\nAbout six years ago Feda said, referring to my Communicator,\n'\nHe's been helping Dora and Dora has been to your flat '. As I\nhave a sister Dora I thought it referred to her. At a later sitting\nthere was another reference and I showed some surprise. Feda then\nsaid :\n'\nIt's not the Dora you are thinking of, it's Mr Bill's Dora '.\nI asked Miss Newton if she could tell me anything of Mr Bill and\nDora, and, on explaining why, she said she thought it would be\nbetter to tell me nothing for fear of spoiling evidence. Several\nbooktests at my flat followed. The next year I was away some\nmonths and lent my flat to a friend. Feda mentioned at my next\nsitting that Dora had been, but could get nothing. '\nIt was like a\nfeather bed '.\"\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 28 April 1931. Sitter :\nRev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore Besterman.\n. . .

[Notes 3, 4, 13.]\nI want page seven, she says, thejproper page seven that you\nasked her for [at the sitting not long before this test was given, we\nhad managed to persuade the Communicator, at last, to go by the\nactual numbers on the page], 'cos on page seven, there's a reference\nto a happy land, a happy state, which I think is meant for our\nworld. It certainly fits it, describes it. I want you to think of this\nin that way. There's rather an unusually large margin at the sides\nof the printing. I wonder if it is poetry, or blank verse. It may\nnot be, but its spaced and arranged on the page rather in that way.\nOh ! Such a funny word beginning with an 0. Like a foreign word.\nShe's trying to write it up for me.

It fits\nin\u2014works in\u2014with the rest of the thing\u2014a happy place \".

[Note\n16.] . . . It's only a reference to it. Something that made her\nimmediately feel the condition. She felt it so strongly. She knows\nyou'll recognise it when you see it too.\nOh ! Ask if a book has been lately placed in there\u2014near there\nwhere she's taken the book from ? She felt it had. [Note 5.] \" The\nlady has been \"\n\u2014been what ?

[Note 8.]\nAnd the yellow flowers, the small yellow flowers, that has been\nin the room recently. Were they out of season, out of their time,\nvery much ? Something said about their being a little before, or\nafter, their time. [Note 9.]\nOh ! Is there a ledge outside this room, a ledge ? It seemed to\nme I could step out, you know, she says. Not usual is it, in London,\nor near London, but felt I could step out, and I felt as if someone\nhad been stepping out\u2014reaching out\u2014and saying :\n\" It's growing\n\u2014it's growing.\" Have you got that, Mr Bill ? (No.) No, he says,\nhe hasn't got it ! That's right, Mr Bill, you say so ! (All right now.)\nDid you get : Someone had been stepping out, reaching out, and\nsaying \" It's growing ?\n\" (Yes.)

When it was over I told her of the\nserious illness of my niece, whom she knew and liked very much.\nShe was deeply affected, and offered a silent prayer for her recovery.\nShe saw her, clairvoyantly, surrounded by light and free from all\npain, and, very naturally, interpreted this as meaning she would\nsurvive, but I knew that my niece's illness was of so grave a nature\nthat there was no hope, and I thought the vision meant release. I\ndid not say so to Miss Geddes. Next morning my niece died. The\nillness was scarlet fever, and the lungs became septic. There had\nalso been much pain from the heart.\n[Signed] J. T.

In view of\nthe importance of this test, I got my neighbour, Mr Frank Summers,\nto come over and inspect the bushes, and witness to their age and\ncondition.

Inside it is white to match the rest of the drawing-\nroom panelling. Outside it is dark to match the oak panelling of\nthe hall. There is also a difference in the way the panels are cut\ninside and out. The only suggestion I can make as to something\njutting out is that just over the door on the inside there runs a\nheavy oak beam supporting the ceiling. The beam being dark is\nin strong contrast to the white door.\n[Note 4.] It is true that we have been talking about a new\nbreed of birds lately.

Here are some recent\nimpressions :\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 30 April 1931. Sitter :\nRev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore Besterman.\n[Feda.] . . . Will you tell Mrs Isabel [Feda's name for Miss\nNewton]\u2014she laugh\u2014but tell her that Dora thinks the front of her\ncoat does hang right. Is it a joke, Dora ? Yes, it is, in a way, but\nMrs Isabel was thinking so much about the front of a coat. Thought\nit wasn't right in line\u2014wasn't in line. Dora thinks it's all right,\nbut you'd better not say that, for if Mrs Isabel thinks it isn't\u2014it\nisn't. Mrs Isabel rather positive. If she thinks a thing is so, it is\nso. If you argue with Mrs Isabel, and make her admit she's wrong,\nshe doesn't really think she's wrong inside her, she says. . . .\nNote by Miss Newton.\n\" This is rather a joke. I went with a friend to a Polytechnic\ndressmaking class on April 23rd and drafted by instructions as to\nlines and measurements which I did not understand at all, a pattern\nfor a bridge coat. In the Vogue Illustration, which I was supposed\nto be copying, the fronts of the coat were narrow, and the fronts in\nmy '\nblock pattern '\nwere wide, and the instructress insisted on\nthem being so. I felt very rebellious, disapproved to my friend of\nPolytechnic patterns, preferred Vogue, but decided I must go through\nwith the '\nblock '\npattern, and so cut it out, and proceeded to make\nit. I still prefer Vogue patterns.\"\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 141\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 29 July 1930. Sitter :\nRev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N.

Miss Newton\ndid not like the way the beds were arranged in one room, and said\nit was like a hospital ward.

This friend does not live in London . . .\nnor does she know anyone who has ever had a sitting with Mrs\nLeonard, or other mediums.\"\n2. An Experiment ivith books in a box.\nThe following experiment was suggested by my Communicator,\nthrough Feda, as follows :\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 21 November 1929.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N. C. Eonnereau.\n[Feda.] . . . Hasn't the scribe got any books ? I think she had\nher eye on the scribe's books 'cos she was looking at him in a very\nsort of longing way. 'Cos, you see, Dora's dreadful interested in\n'em, and I think she's got the idea of trying him. . . . Has he got\nany locked up ? Oh ! What do you mean, Dora, did you want him\nto lock some up ? Mr Bill ! She wondered if he could get somebody\n\u2014not himself 'cos he comes to the sittings\u2014but get somebody, who\nhasn't been here at all, to put some books in a box.\n[W. S. I.] Could you ? [to notetaker.]\n[N. C. F.] Yes\u2014certainly.\n\f142 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\n[Feda.] She wondered if lie could put some in a box, and lock\nthem up, and him not to have the key, but the person who put\nthem in to have the key. She would think that if he had three\nMr Bill, look ! I'll have to be a bit careful ! If he lay them like\n[Feda illustrates horizontally] on top of each other. She doesn't\nmind what kind of books, but she doesn't think timetables would\nbe good. She says \" Not any variety of subject \". . . . She think\nshe would like a wooden box best, or a leather one would do. She's\nnot sure about metal. It might be all right, she's not quite sure,\nbut she would like to do that in time for your next sitting, Mr Bill.\nFollowing out the above suggestion, I placed the matter in Miss\nNewton's hands saying that if, in addition, she could manage to\nhave books placed in the box of which nobody knew the titles it\nmight be an improvement on the original plan. The following shows\nwhat was done :\n\" The books were contributed by Miss Horsell, Miss Newton and\nMr Besterman, none of whom knew what the other two had con-\ntributed. The housekeeper, Mrs Tolhurst, was instructed on the\nafternoon of 14 January to take the collection of books into the\nseance-ioom, and without looking at the titles of any, to place three\nhorizontally in a wooden box which was then given her for the\npurpose, to lock the box, and give the key at once to the Secretary,\nand the box to Tolhurst, who took it at once to Mr Fonnereau's\nhouse, and to take the rest of the books and keep them until after\n28 January. [Signed] Th. B., I. Newton, E. M. Horsell.\"\nAttempts to give tests from this box were made on 30 January\n1930, 8 May 1930, and 25 September 1930, the box being taken\nback to the Rooms on each occasion on the day after the sitting, and\nopened in the presence of one or more of the S.P.B,. officials. On\neach occasion a certain measure of correspondence may be said to\nhave been found, I think, with what was stated through Feda, but\nwhether beyond what chance-coincidence might give is a matter\nfor criticism. I mention this because I am only describing one of\nthe above results\u2014the third. In this case, I understand that the\ntest was again prepared for in the manner described above, three\nfresh books being placed in the box by Mrs Tolhurst from the store,\nand the box was sent to Mr Fonnereau's house in July as it was\nhoped that tests might be given at a sitting on 29 July 1930. No\ntests were given from the box however on that date, nor was any\nattempt made to do so. In answer to my question to the Personal\nControl as to whether we should \" do the box \" next time, D. G. I.\nreplied :\n\" He'd better keep the box in the same place. Sometimes\nif a thing is altered I don't know what it is\u2014it confuses me.\" The\nbox therefore remained at Mr Fonnereau's house until 26 September\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 143\n1930, and during that time it was not opened by anyone. It was\neventually opened, as described below, by Miss Newton, and at the\ntime of the sitting the box had not been seen by me since it was\nopened at the S.P.R. rooms on 9 May 1930. So far as we know,\nMrs Leonard is ignorant of Mr Fonnereau's identity.\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 25 September 1930.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N. C. Fonnereau.\n[Feda.] .... She wants to say something about the box first.\n[W. S. I.] Yes.\n[Feda.] It's awful difficult, Mr Bill, describing to you what she\nfeels, and what she giving me about the box. Look !\n[W. S. I.] Yes.\n[Feda.] It doesn't feel as if the box is full, Mr Bill. She got, like,\nwhat you call, vacancies in it\u2014vacancies. Puzzled her very much,\nMr Bill. Like blank places. Think the books must have been put\nsuch a way that they didn't like, fill the box, properly. [Note 1.]\nWhy does she get a feeling of pictures in connection with the box,\npictures ? She didn't see this, Mr Bill, but she got the feeling of\npictures, illustrations, very much, while she was feeling what one\ncan only call the top layer\u2014the top layer\u2014of the box. [Note 2.]\nIsn't it funny, Mr Bill ! She can't get a booktest the ordinary way\nfrom it. She gets more like impressions about it than an ordinary\nbooktest. Is there anything in this box, near the top of the box,\nmake you think of very old people\u2014very old people ? She got such a\nstrong feeling of elderly people, especially a very old man. [Note 3.]\nAnd the initial T comes with it, T, T. Mr Bill ! It's so funny the\nway she has to get that : she got it from the top of the box. She\nsays \" If it's from books it must be the top book inside.\" It's\nsomething like that 'cos she says \" the top \". She's moving her\nhand a bit towards the left too. [Note 4.]\nWhat creaks so about the box ? She finds it's a noisy box. Some-\nthing makes a sort of creaking, rather unusually noisy sound\u2014this\nbox. Something to do with the opening, she thinks. It couldn't\nmake a noise by itself, Dora. \" You wouldn't expect it to be,\" she\nsays, \" you would expect it to be a quite well-behaved box, it isn't.\nThere's something makes an unusual sound about it.\" She's sure\nshe's right. Is it the same box as before ? Got a different condition\nfeels different to her. Perhaps someone has used it, or some different\nmagnetism put in it, something different about it. [Note 5.]\nHayward or Hereward. As you open this box can you see the\nname Hayward, or Hereward ? A name sounding very much like\nthat. Is it on something inside the box\u2014name in the box ? Name\ncame to her so strongly sounding like Hereward\u2014Hereward\nHereward\u2014Hereward. [Note 6.]\n\f144 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [paet\nHave you got that, Mr Bill ? She says \" It's awfully funny doing\nthis box, it's like sensing an area more than doing an ordinary\nbooktest.\" Sensing an area, what you mean, Dora, sensing an\narea ? She didn't know how else to describe it : tapping, sensing,\na small area, and seeing what you can get from it. What you call\nit ? Barrel\u2014barrel ? All right. Well, it sounds as if it must be\nwrong ! Is anything shaped like a barrel in this room ? She seemed\nso sure about it. Anything shaped like barrel in this room ? Either\na barrel, or something connected with, or shaped like a barrel in\nthe room. Dora says \" I expected you to say '\nno, no ', but I\nshould like you to look and see before you say no.\" \" I feel I'm\nright about it,\" she says, \" Yes, I feel I'm right.\" [Note 7.]\nIs there something white, rather large and white, near the box ?\nSeemed to get a lot of white\u2014rather large expanse of white. Not a\nwhite curtain, or white cloth\u2014felt like white wood, might be metal\npainted white. It felt like white, hard wood. [Note 8.] Oh ! And\nthere's something close to it with a round knob on. [Note 9.]\nSomething has been falling down here\u2014slipping down. Someone's\nbeen talking about it, and saying \"That slips down, falls down.\"\nBy where the box is, something's been slipping down. Yes ! That's\nall she could get about it.\n[W. S. I.] Sorry.\n[Feda.] She couldn't get any more. Wasn't it a noosance !\n\" Most peculiar,\" she says. [Note 10.]\nOn the day after this sitting the box was taken as usual by the\nnotetaker to the S.P.R. Rooms, and it was opened by Miss Newton\nin the presence of Mr Fonnereau and myself.\nNote by Miss Newton on the contents of the box :\n\" Tales of Old\nJapan was on the top, underneath was The Return, and at the side,\nalmost horizontal, was The Burden of the Balkans.\"\nThe following notes are mine :\n[Note 1.] Two of the above-named books are small books, Tales\nof Old Japan being 6| inches by 4\u00a7 inches, and The Burden of the\nBalkans, 6| inches by 4| inches, so that the box was not nearly\nfull. The former of these, which was the top book, \" the top layer\n\"\nis by Lord Redesdale, Macmillan, 1910.\n[Note 2.] Tales of Old Japan is distinguished by its thirty-eight\npictures by Japanese artists. They are not commonplace. On the\nfirst page of Preface, numbered vii, attention is drawn to them as\nbeing of an exceptional nature :\n\" For the illustrations, at least, I\nfeel that I need make no apology. Drawn, in the first instance, by\none Odake, an artist in my employ, they were cut on wood by a\nfamous wood engraver at Yedo, and are therefore genuine specimens\nof Japanese art. Messrs Dalziel, on examining the woodblocks,\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings ivith Mrs Leonard 145\npointed out to me, as an interesting fact, that the lines are cut with\nthe grain of the wood, after the manner of Albert Durer, and some\nof the old German masters\u2014a process which has been abandoned\nby modern European wood-engravers.\" I do not recall any\nillustrations (apart from a possible Frontispiece) in the books of\nthe former tests.\n[Note 3.] Tales of Old Japan deals largely with elderly people,\nthough \" old \" may of course be taken in a two-fold sense. The\nfrontispiece represents nine Japanese warriors with spears and\nswords gathered around an elderly Japanese who is seated. Under-\nneath is written :\n\" The Eonins invite Kotsuke No Suke to perform\nHara-Eiri.\" E.N.S. is described on page 13 as \" some sixty years\nof age.\" On the first page of Contents (numbered ix) I found :\n\" The Story of the old man who made withered trees to blossom.\"\nIn List of Elustrations (numbered xi) I found :\n...\" The old\nman who caused withered trees to flower. ...\" On page 3 : . . .\n\" Some are venerable men, with thin grey hair. . .\n.\"\n[Note 4.] The title of the top book begins with the initial T,\nTales.\n[Note 5.] The box was the same as that used in the two former\nexperiments. On two sides of the box are brass handles which\nrattle when the box is lifted. This latter point would be known to\nthe notetaker.\n[Note 6.] On the last page but two of the testbook Tales of Old\nJapan (omitting blank fly-leaves) I found :\n\" Hereward the Wake.\"\nThere is, of course, much more chance of the result being due\nto coincidence when a numbered page is not given\u2014nevertheless,\nit must be noted that in this case the word \" Hereward \" was found\non one of the pages examined first by me in the top book, for,\nhaving failed to find it at the beginning of the book, I turned, as\nmy custom is, to the end to see if it was there. The word \" Here-\nward \" is conspicuous as it is in good black type, as are the other\nwords on this page.\n[Note 7.] Mr Fonnereau told us that on his dressing-table, about\n2\u20143 yards from the box, there was a round box shaped much like\na barrel. He brought the box for us to see. It is small, approxi-\nmately 4 inches in height, and has bands round it which enhance\nthe resemblance to a barrel.\n[Note 8.] We were told by Mr Fonnereau that it would seem\nprobable that what is here referred to is the white marble slab on\nthe wash-stand which was close to where he kept the box in his\nroom.\n[Note 9.] Mr Fonnereau wrote later :\n\" The knob mentioned in\nmy tests is the knob on a little hand blotter\u2014the closest object (I\nshould think) to the '\nwhite expanse '\nof my washing stand.\"\n\f146 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\n[Note 10.] On Mr Fonnereau's recent return from his holidays\nhe tells me that the maid apologised for not having a curtain over\nhis wardrobe. The maid said that the curtain rod kept slipping\ndown.\nA copy of my notes 7, 8 and 10, given above, were sent by me to\nMr Fonnereau for confirmation on 13 October 1931. He replied :\n\" I am glad to endorse the three statements given in your letter\ndated 13 Oct. 1931. The date of my return from my holiday in\n1930 was Tuesday, 2 September 1930. [Signed] N. C.

The Tarpauline One. . . . I'll go into the same room,\na bright, good-sized sitting-room. . . . Oh ! There's a table in this\nroom, Mr Bill, that interests Dora. \" It's rather similar to one that\nyou've got at home, and it isn't a common table, it isn't the sort of\npattern that you'd find in anybody's home. It's not a new one\nit's a good many years old, and \"\n\u2014oh well ! I'll just explain that\nto him ! Mr Bill ! She was trying to feel it, and she felt as if it had\neither a ledge on it, or a drawer in it, in which things are kept. She\nfelt paper, Mr Bill, paper. And string, Dora ? That is what she\nsays, Mr Bill. Paper and string were two of the things she felt\nunder it, do you see ? Paper and string. There's something too\non the ledge, or in the drawer, whichever it is she's not quite certain,\nlooks to her like a small ball, Mr Bill, a round circular object that\nyou can roll about, so she suppose that you can call that \" a ball \",\nMr Bill, do you see ? Dora very serious about it, Mr Bill, 'cos there's\nplenty of round things called by some special name, isn't there ? . . .\n[Note 1.]\nShe wouldn't have noticed the table, Mr Bill, but it was like one\nof her's. You mean, Mr Bill's, Dora ! She says, what's yours are\nher's. This table, though it isn't a very small one, gets moved\nabout\u2014shifted about, Mr Bill. It gets shifted about. She doesn't\nmean just like when a place is being cleaned in the ordinary way,\nbut a rather peculiar way. Something has to be got at near this\ntable, Mr Bill. . . . [Note 2.] There's a photo of someone passed\nover close to this table. As you're standing against the table you\ncan feel it. The person is a man, and he's not one who's gone\nrecently, he's gone some time ago, some years ago. Not the Com-\nmunicator of the Tarpauline lady\u2014not her regular Communicator.\n[W. S. I.] Right.\n[Feda.] Impression from her mind was that the man whose\nphoto was there had been a sort of teacher, or instructor, Mr Bill.\n\f\f\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 147\n[Note 3.] What's the bar doing there ?\n[W. S. I.J Bar ?\n[Feda.] Like a rod, or bar's been left there. Mr Bill ! There's\na rod or bar close to the table there, just as if somebody had brought\na long bar or rod into the room, and had put it down there just by\nthe table, just as if they'd laid it there, Mr Bill, and she says she\ndoesn't know what the thing's for, but she knows it's there. . . .\n[Note 4.]\nThe above tests, which are from Mrs Kingsley Tarpey's flat, are\ngiven because they are all more or less concerned with the table\nthey followed some booktests not given here. The tests were\nkindly verified for me by Miss Newton on 23 September 1930.\nFurther information was given to Miss Newton, by Mrs Tarpey,\nlater, in letters.\nExtract from Miss Newton's notes.\n[Note 1.] \"Table: Chippendale period, old oak, flaps with\nrounded corners. Legs fluted. One drawer, containing much\nstring. Until recently Mrs Tarpey said, labels.

It has a drawer at one end in which string, labels,\ncork-screws and some oddments are kept. I used the last luggage\nlabel from there recently. There is paper far back in the drawer\nwrapping some tapers : also there is paper lining it. . . . The table\nhad leaves that drop, with rounded corners, and the legs have a\nlong sparse fluted pattern.\" [Mrs Tarpey sent a sketch of the\ntable, which is described there as Antique Pembroke Table. . . .\nThe table, when leaves are up, is almost square.]\nExtracts from Miss Newton's notes.\n[Note 2.] \" [The table] gets moved about nearly every time they\nhave a sitting.\"\n[Note 3.] \" Standing by the table one faces a portrait of Mrs\nTarpey's father. Put your hand out and you touch it.\"\nExtract from Mrs Tarpey's letter.\n\" Above the table is a life-size portrait of my father in pastel,\ndone after his death from a photograph.

Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\nspeaking, doing definitely educative work on the Irish question,\nand the Eastern question, in working men's clubs, and generally\namong working class audiences. ... I think it would be quite\nright to speak of him as a teacher, as many younger men in our\ncircle sat at his feet.\"\nExtract from Miss Newton's notes.\n[Note 4.]\n\" There was no rod or bar near. Mrs Tarpey showed\nme a window rod which is often in the room and was much used\nfor hanging pictures from about the middle of August for about a\nfortnight.\"\nIt will be remembered that I have never been to Mrs Tarpey'\nflat, and have therefore no knowledge of what her furniture is like.\nAfter her verification, Miss Newton wrote to me for a description\nof such tables of mine as might be in question. In reply, I sent\nsketches of four of my tables and a brief description of each. I\nunderstand that Mrs Tarpey and Miss Newton, having indepen-\ndently looked at my sketches, came to the same conclusion as to the\ntable most like the one at Mrs Tarpey's, and it was not until after\nthis that I was allowed to see the sketch, and description of that\ntable. In certain particulars it resembles somewhat closely my\nwife's own writing-table in my drawing-room. Our table is of\nrose-wood, length 39| inches, width 18 inches, height 28| inches.\nThe chief resemblance is in the flaps, rounded corners, thin carved\nlegs\u2014I think you would call them fluted\u2014they have grooves down\nthe two front legs, and there being one drawer.\nNote by Mrs Kingsley Tarpey, 22 August 1931.\n\" None of the subjects referred to in Mr Irving's sittings have\ncome up in my sittings with Mrs Leonard. Feda has mentioned\nthat she had been to the flat, and that she liked the room, \" the\nnice light room that Dora likes.\" One other attempt, not very\nsuccessful, has been made by another Communicator through Feda\nto give a booktest at the flat. There has been no conversation\nbetween Mrs Leonard and myself about the room or the flowers or\nthe balcony. Mrs Leonard knows that I am a painter, and has a\npicture of mine, but so far as I know, that would be the whole\nextent of her knowledge.\"\n4. The paper about the dentist.\nThis test differs from most of the other tests in this paper in that\nit may be said to have been taken from my mind, i.e. there is\nnothing given that may not have been known to me years ago and\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 149\nlong since forgotten. It is, however, I think, original and interesting\nenough to be worth recording.\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 29 January 1931.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore\nBesterman.\n[Feda.] . . . She's got blue on this morning, Dora has. Oh ! She\nput it on rather specially. She hoped it would make you remember\nsomething you used to be fond of seeing her in. Journey ? She\nsays, \" Journeys\u2014journeys\u2014journeys,\" Mr Bill.\n[W. S. I.] I remember.\n[Feda.] And you were thinking of a special journey which she\nwore this thing\u2014the blue. You were reminded of it and thinking of\nit, and something that worried her about a teeth [sic], at that time,\nthat you will probably have forgotten but that you'll remember\nafter. Have you got that, Mr Bill ?\n\" The journey, the blue dress,\nand teeth.\" She's almost sure you'll have forgotten. You'll have\nto think back about the teeth. She thought a lot at the time. She\nhadn't wanted it to happen just then. It was a noosance just then.\nThat's why she remembers it, but she didn't expect you to, Mr\nBill. While I'm talking about that\u2014Whatever did you keep the\npaper about the dentist for so long at home\u2014at home ? You don't\nwant it now. You kept it a long time at home. You've still got\nit. 'Tisn't any good. Thinks there's an eight on it.\n[W. S. I.] Eight ?\n[Feda.] Eight. Have you got that, Mr Bill ? Now she had to\nbring these in then, in case she forgot them. . . .\n[Note.] It is correct that I had recently been recalling a visit to\na dentist which I had once made with my wife when she had gone\nthere to have a tooth out with gas. When I pass near Clarence\nStreet in Gloucester where the dentist lives, I often recall this\nvisit, for my wife was not bothered as a rule with tooth trouble,\nand I can only recall this one occasion on which I went with her to\nhave one out. She seemed to me long in coming round and I was\nnervous. My recollection, at the time of the sitting, as to the year\nor time of year when the above took place was vague, simply that\nit was not so very long before my wife's death. When I came to\nverify the test I hunted through my wife's personal receipts, account\nbook, writing-table, etc., but could find nothing like the paper\ndescribed. It seemed very doubtful whether any such paper was in\nexistence, as we generally paid at the time for matters of this kind,\n\u2014I always did myself. Having exhausted my wife's belongings, I\nturned to the house-file of receipts, which dates back to 1912.\nStarting then and working forwards through, I suppose, some\nhundreds of papers, I at last discovered the following :\n\f150 Rev. W. 8. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\n\"12 Clarence Street, Gloucester.\nDecember 1914.\nMrs Irving, Oxenhall Vicarage, nr.

Fox, 2 January 1915.\"\nIt will be seen from the above that the \" eight \" said to be on the\npaper shows the actual date of the month on which the visit to the\ndentist of which I had been thinking took place. And further, the\nfact that this was in December makes it practically certain that my\nwife would be wearing her blue coat lined with fur. She only had\none, and always wore it on \" journeys \" in winter. We live about\nten miles from the dentist's and probably went there and back by\ntrain. Motor buses did not, I think, run then. The receipt has\nbeen handed to Miss Newton.\n5. A letter test.\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 30 April 1925. Sitter :\nRev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs Dingwall.\n[Feda.] . . . She's got another little test for you, but the one she\nmean now is to welcome you when you get home.\n[W. S. I.] Very nice.\n[Feda.] Mr Bill ! You're not to go and look for it in a case or\nanything, it will be in front of your eyes . . . when you get home.\nIt is something that you'll have to read because she sees a name\nthat will remind you of very happy times that you used to have with\nDora, a name of a place. It'll be facing you when you get in. It's\nlike a booktest, but it isn't from a book, but something that will\nbe awaiting you and which will be\u2014No !\n\u2014and which you will pick\nup and look at. You'll have to, Mr Bill. You'll do it in the ordinary\ncourse of events. Now, Mr Bill, on this paper there's a little sign\n\u2014don't think I've got it quite right, Mr Bill, but it looks a little\nbit like, a cross or a letter X. Time is mentioned on it too. A\nquestion of time is mentioned on this paper, too, like a date or an\no'clock.\n[W. S. I.] Old clock ?\n[Feda.] O'clock. What means time of day ! You know what\nan o'clock means ! That's all about that, Mr Bill, but it will be a\ncurious connecting link with you and Dora, and a place. Not the\nplace you're living in now, but another place where you were happy\ntogether. . . .:\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 151\n[Note.] Before leaving home I had arranged with the Newent\nPost Office people that my letters should be forwarded to me in\nLondon from Monday, 27 April, after the first delivery, to Thursday,\n30 April 1925 inclusive, but that letters arriving after that date\non the Friday or Saturday\u2014should not be forwarded. On my\nreturn home, on Saturday, 2 May 1925, I found on my dining-room\ntable some half a dozen letters and two newspapers. One of these\nletters\u2014a circular\u2014to some extent tallies with Feda's description.\nIt was addressed to Mrs Irving and, perhaps for that reason, was\nnot forwarded to me early in the week, though it bears the post-\nmark Cheltenham, Paid |d, 3.30 p.m. 28 April 1925. Inside was\nmerely a printed card advertising the Spring and Summer models\nof a Cheltenham tradesman named Ayris, at whose shop my wife\noften used to make purchases. A monogram in gilded letters was\nat the top of the card. This monogram, which is approximately\nf inches by | inches at extreme points, appears to be of the letters\nW.A. or M.A., though it is not certain. In the centre of the mono-\ngram, two curved lines bisect one another making a figure something\nlike a cross, X. In the bottom left-hand corner were the words\n\" Telephone 820.\" In the bottom right-hand corner \" Promenade,\nCheltenham.\" Cheltenham has fuller happy associations for my\nwife and me than any other town, as so much of our time has been\nspent in it, or within easy reach of it. A curious point about this\ntest is that the postman tells me this letter was not delivered at\nmy Vicarage till the morning of my return\u20142 May\u2014so that at the\ntime of the sitting, the circular was at the Newent Post Office.\nAssuming that this circular is what was referred to through Feda,\nit is important to note that Ayris' s circulars seem to be still sent\nto my house periodically, i.e. I remember having received them\nbefore. Unless, however, these Spring adverts are always sent out\non the same date, it is difficult to believe that my subconscious\nmind can have anticipated the receipt of the circular\u2014though not\nperhaps impossible. The circular has been sent to the S.P.K.\nRooms with the script.\n\fPart II.\nA SERIES OF IMPRESSIONS FROM A HOUSE UNKNOWN TO\nTHE MEDIUM, SITTER, AND RECORDER.\nBy Theodore Besterman.\nThe house here referred to is that of Mr and Mrs C. E. Stansfield,\n70 Northcourt Avenue, Reading. Mrs Stansfield became a member\nof the Society at the end of 1929. During Mr Irving's sitting with\nMrs Leonard of 20 November 1930 he received communications\napparently connected with Mrs Stansfield's brother. Mr and Mrs\nStansfield were not mentioned, but Mr Irving wrote to Mrs Stansfield,\nwho is his cousin, to verify the date of her brother's death, which\noccurred thirteen days after the sitting. On 2 January 1931 Mr\nIrving wrote that he thought (though the reference was not definite)\nthat Mrs Stansfield had been referred to at a sitting with Mrs Leonard\non 8 May 1930, as being possibly willing to allow a booktest to be\ntaken from her house. Mr and Mrs Stansfield consented to the\nattempt being made.\nMr Irving had not seen Mrs Stansfield or any member of her family\nfor between thirty and forty years, and had never met Mr Stansfield\nor been in Reading. 1\nHe met Mr Stansfield for the first time in\nLondon on 1 May 1931. Neither on this occasion nor at the second\nmeeting mentioned below was any description given of Mr and Mrs\nStansfield's house.\nOn the day before, 30 April, Mr Irving had a sitting with Mrs\nLeonard. At this sitting, during the Personal Control, the Com-\nmunicator, in the midst of much else, spoke the following words :\n\" Wilt ! Another name I want you to think of too. A name starting\nwith Stan. I feel that name so near you now. I think it's linked\nup with you. (Mr Irving : Follow him up and take a booktest.) Yes.\nI'd like to. Will ! it's a nice condition, quite a nice one, quite a nice\none. The impression I get is of someone who would be interested in\nthe subject. Not quite as we are, from a different standpoint.\"\nMr Irving read this passage the following day to Mr Stansfield,\nwho expressed the hope that a test would be given from his house\nat the next sitting. This took place on 23 July 1931, when Feda\nsaid :\n\" She went to two other places, Dora did, two, and found\nshe couldn't get anything. Something in both conditions held her\nup. One of the places she went to felt quite empty, quite empty.\"\nIt is not unreasonable to interpret this as a reference to the house\nof Mr Stansfield, who was at that time in hospital.\n1\n1 myself did not meet Mr and Mrs Stansfield until after the sitting of 24\nSeptember 1931, and knew nothing whatever about them.\n152\n\f[part 122] Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 153\nEarly in September 1931 Mr Irving wrote to Mr Stansfield asking\nbim to arrange for his books not to be moved, in the bope tbat\nbooktests might be given in forthcoming sittings, the dates of\nwhich were not given. On 19 September Mr Irving met Mr Stans-\nfield for the second time, in London. During the sitting on 22\nSeptember no tests were given from Reading as expected. Con-\nsequently Mr Irving asked the communicator during the Personal\nControl :\n\" (Will you try to go to the house of the person I men-\ntioned the one I 2\ncalled Stan and try and give the test on Thursday?)\nYes. Will ! I think it was thought about before.\" The sitting\nhere referred to was that of 24 September 1931, an extract from\nwhich now follows.\nPassages in which Feda appears to be quoting the Communicator\nare placed in inverted commas. Words in round brackets were\nspoken at the sitting by Mr Irving. Editorial comments in the\nrecord are in square brackets ; those distinguished in addition by my\ninitials show variations between Mr Irving's record and mine. The\npunctuation and division into paragraphs have been supplied by me.\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard on 21 September 1931.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Theodore Besterman.\n[Feda:] [1.] . . . Mr Bill, she's\nbeen to a place for some books,\nnot in boxes or anything, Mr\nBill, but just ordinary booktest.\nTo a place that you have been\nwanting her to go to for some\ntime. You mentioned it last\nsitting, she say, last sitting she\nthink, and you mentioned it also\nat a previous sitting when you\nwere here before. (I remember.)\nShe is building up an S, S.\n[2.] And isn't there a B to do\nwith it too ? Mr Bill, she is\nbuilding up an S, but there is a\nname beginning with B con-\nnected too. Perhaps you have\nforgotten. It is possible you\ndon't even know it, but Dora is\nright. Bur, bur, bur [Beh, beh,\nbeh. Th.B. Mr Irving's spelling\ngives the sound better, but the\n[1.] This is clearly a reference\nto the Stansfield house.\n[2.] Edward Vipond Ballard,\na friend and former colleague of\nMr Stansfield (quite unknown to\nMr Irving), died in January 1931.\nMr Stansfield saw him the night\nbefore his death, helped his\nwidow with the necessary\narrangements, took control of\nthe funeral, raised a fund for Mrs\nBallard, and, in short, had been\n2\nThis was a slip of the tongue for \" the person you mentioned, the one you\ncalled Stan ...\"\n\f154 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\nterminal r was not sounded]. It\nisn't B, u, y, [by. Th. B.] or B\n[Be. Th. B.] but like as if you\nwere going to say bull or but\n[boott. Th. B. ;\nboot, to rhyme\nwith soot]. Like that way,\nHave you got that 1 The B per-\nson is very much connected, but\nhe's passed over, Mr Bill. A\nperson interested in the place,\nand the what you call the in-\nmates. Those is lunatics ! No,\nthese people isn't lunatics, they'se\n'markably sensible.\n[3.] She says \" the B person is\nvery interested with these indeed\nand has a connection, link,\" she\ncall it, \" with some books there.\nB. The B isn't a christian name,\nit's a surname.\" She says \" I\nthink about seven letters in it,\nabout seven letters in it. Sur-\nname Murrad, Murrad, Murrad,\nMurrad [Barrett, Barrass, Bar-\nrett, Berard. Th.B. ] I can't get\nthis quite. Murrad, Mallard\n[Burrard. Th. B.].\" Another\nname she's giving. She's not\ngiving me a proper idea of the\nbeginning. Marrad [Barrard.\nTh. B.]. No, I'll wait a minute\nand see if she does it better.\n[4.] Mr Bill, she know that you\nknow the place, you see, and she\nshowing me a room. Mr Bill, I\nthink there are two or three lots\nof books in this room, not just\nlike a few books. You see there\nare books in more than one part,\nposition, in the room. I dunno\nwhat you mean, Dora ? In two\nparts ? Dora say in two parts of\nthe room the books are put in\nrather systematic position, sys-\ntematic position. There are\nvery closely connected with the\nname Ballard for several months\nup to and beyond the time of the\nsitting. It will be seen that this\nname corresponds very closely\nwith the forms Mallard and Bar-\nrard, as shown in the next para-\ngraph. Ballard, as stated in the\nrecord, has seven letters in it.\n[3.] The \" connection with\nsome books there \" is probably\nan allusion to the fact that about\nten days before the sitting Mrs\nBallard brought to Mr Stans-\nfield's house three volumes of a\nschool magazine formerly edited\nby Mr Ballard. These volumes\nwere in the house until the day\nbefore the sitting.\n[4.] It is not correct that Mr\nIrving knows the place ; but the\nstatement may reasonably be\ntaken to mean, as it would in\nordinary conversation, \" You\nknow of the place,\" or \" You\nknow what place I'm talking\nabout.\" This is not, of course, a\nseparate point, but part of [1]\nabove.\nIt is clear from what follows\nthat the dining-room is intended,\nbut it is not correct that there\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 155\nsome others that are placed\ndifferent, different form, differ-\nent position altogether.\n[5.] Mr Bill, this feel like a\ncomfortable room, quite com-\nfortable, as if someone had put\nrather nice comfortable chairs in\nit. Not a lot, Mr Bill, the chairs,\nbut just a few like comfortable\nones.\n[6.] There's a, I think it's a\ntable in the room ; the one she\nshowing me not very big, heavy,\nlumpy for its size, as if it would\nweigh as much as a much bigger\ntable, really much bigger.\n[7.] You know, Mr Bill, most\npeople in a room tries to get all\nthe wood the same like the furni-\nture, like Gladys [Mrs Leonard].\nShe like oak. You got some oak\ntoo, Mr Bill. She like everything\nall the same. In this room, the\none room, they hasn't matched\nthe wood like that ;\nthey'se got\ntwo different kinds of wood alto-\ngether in this room. \" Three\nkinds,\" Dora says, \" to be cor-\nrect.\" Yes, you got to be\ncorrect ! Three kinds, three\nkinds. (Yes.) Two very much\nalike, but not the same wood ;\nthe third very unlike, very\ndifferent. Two browns and a\nblack, two browns and a black.\nMr\" Bill, I don't think people\nwould notice it if they just enter\nthe room, perhaps even sat in it.\nHave you got that ? (Yes.)\n\" But of course I try to notice\nsomething,\" she says, \" I try to,\nsomething special.\"\nare books in two (or more than\ntwo) places, except that there\nare a few on a table in addition\nto those in the bookcase. Mr\nStansfield states that the books\nare systematically arranged.\n[5.] Mr Stansfield states that\nhis favourite armchair is in this\nroom, but that there are no\nother specially comfortable\nchairs in it.\n[6.] There is a gate-legged\ntable in the room, which Mr\nStansfield states to be heavy for\nits size.\n[7.] There are two kinds of\nwood in the room, from the\npoint of view of colour, black\noak and brown woods of different\nkinds. But \" to be correct\n\"\nthese two kinds are really three,\nsince the brown furniture con-\nsists of oak and bentwood (\"two\nbrowns \"). It must be added,\nhowever, to be absolutely cor-\nrect, that there are really four\nkinds of wood, for the \" oak\n\"\nitself is of two kinds, genuine oak\nand deal stained to match it.\nl2\n\f156 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\n[8.] There's a picture of a dog\nin this room, a dog with rather a\nlong, fairly long face, long nose,\nlong nose. Not a what ? I know\nwhat you mean. Not a Pamal-\nanean [Pomeranian]. No. She\nsay, \" I got the feeling of more\nwhat you call a sporting dog. A\nman's dog, you might call it.\nIntelligent head, very intelligent\nhead. Long nose.\" (Right [This\nexpression is used by Mr Irving\nsimply as an encouraging way of\nsaying, \" I've got that, go on.\"]).\n[9.]\n\" Rollers ? Something has\nbeen said in this room lately\nabout, I think, rollers, rollers.\nSomething ought to run on rol-\nlers. I can't understand what\nthere could be in this room that\ncould run on rollers, but I got\nthe thought, and I know I am\nright.\" (Good [See the note at\nthe end of the previous para-\ngraph.]).\n[10.] \" Now I walked to the\nleft again, from the door to the\nleft. I took the first section let\nus call it, the first section that I\ncame to on the left. You will see\n[8.] There is an engraving on\nthe wall of \" Nearing Home,\" by\nHerbert Dicksee, in which a\nshepherd and his collie are the\nprominent figures. The descrip-\ntion of course applies to a collie.\n[9.] On 20 September 1931,\nfour days before the sitting, a\nfriend was telling Mr Stansfield\nabout the transportation of the\nmonument to the Duke of Well-\nington by road through Reading\non its way to Strathfieldsaye.\nMr Stansfield remarked, \" How-\never was it brought in one piece ;\nit must have been brought on\nrollers.\n'\n' This conversation took\nplace on the lawn just outside\nthe dining-room, and, according\nto a statement signed by Mrs\nStansfield and Miss Mary Stans-\nfield, the remarks about the\nmoving of the monument on\nrollers were repeated in the\ndining-room. Mr Stansfield has\nno recollection of this repetition.\nThe relevant details of the con-\nversation on the lawn have been\ncorroborated in a signed state-\nment made by the friend above\nreferred to, who prefers to renrain\nanonymous.\n[10.] It is clear from points 5,\n6, 7, 8, 17, that the room from\nwhich the tests are taken is the\ndining-room. Unfortunately,\nthe booktests are not clear.\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 157\nwhy I put it like that,\" she says.\n(Yes.) \" I took the lowest shelf\nI could find. I didn't attempt to\ngo higher. I just took, counting\nfrom the floor, the first shelf with\nbooks on going upwards. 5th\nvolume, 5th. And I took the\n5th book from the left, the 5th.\"\nWait a minute, Dora, 4. I've\ngot 4. Now wait a minute,\nwhat's the other one % 4, is that\nall ? No, oh, I see, Mr Bill ! I\nwas a bit puzzled ! She kept\nbuilding up a 4, and then she\ndone it again. She mean 4, 4,\nforty-four. \" On the 44th page\nI feel there is a reference to\npictures, pictures, portraits, and\nshould remind you of some\npictures, portraits, you have at\nhome, an allusion to one, a\nspecial one that you have at\nhome, you think a great deal of.\"\n(Right.)\n[11.] \"On the same page as\nthe reference to pictures, will you\nsee if there are some words lower\non the page, lower, referring to\nforeign titles, foreign royalties,\nforeign titles, have you got that?\n'\n(Yes.)\nThere is no difficulty about the\nshelf intended, as there is only\none set of shelves in the room.\nBut this is not divided into\nsections.\nAnother difficulty occurs in\nconnection with the volume on\nthe shelf, for at its extreme left\nis a pile of notebooks. In ac-\ncordance with the usual practice\nthis pile must be counted as one\nvolume, especially as the adjoin-\ning books are big ones. On this\nplan the fifth volume from the\nleft is an album of family photo-\ngraphs. The thick cardboard\n\" pages \" are not numbered, and\nthe portrait in p. [44] is of .no\nspecial interest to Mr Irving. On\nthe other hand, in the back of\nthis page, that is, in p. [43] is a\nphotograph of Mr Irving' s grand-\nfather. Now another portrait of\nthis grandfather hangs in the\ndining-room of Mr Irving's sister,\nwith whom he had been staying\nfrom 7-16 September, that is,\na few days before the sitting.\nThese particulars are corrobor-\nated in a signed statement by\nMiss Irving. However, this does\nnot fully bear out the statement\nin the record, which refers to Mr\nIrving's own home, not to Miss\nIrving's.\n[11.] When the picture in page\n[44] of the album is withdrawn,\nthe back of the portrait in page\n[43] becomes visible. On it are\nprinted the words \" Under the\npatronage of Her Majesty the\nQueen, H.R.H. The Prince of\nWales,\" followed by their re-\nspective Coats of Arms (with the\nmottoes in French and German),\n\f158 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\n[12.] Now will you take the\nnext book but one, going along\ntowards the right. That will be\nthe 7th book from the left side of\nshelf, 7th. At the beginning, the\nvery beginning, the opening\npage, I mean the opening page\nrefers to matters that the scribe\n\u2014him\u2014[Feda points to Th.B.]\nwould be very interested in, has\nbeen very much interested just\nnow, will be interested in im-\nmediately just now, matters\naffecting him just now at the\nmoment ; a kind of description\nof conditions and things round\nhim at the moment. Have you\ngot that, Mr Bill ? (Yes.)\n[13.] Wait a minute. \"Violet,\nviolet. Will you see if there is\na mention of violet on this page,\nthe same page ?\n\" Dora say\n\" while I was getting this, I kept\ngetting the idea of the word\nviolet, violet, violet. Didn't see\nit, felt it. May be a name,\" she\nsays, \" but got it so strongly.\"\n(Did you say, got it so strongly?)\n\" Yes.\"\nand the photographer's name.\nThis is the nearest approach to\nthe statement in the record.\n[12.] This is Mr Stansfield's\nfamily Bible (London, Eyre and\nStrahan, 1813). In the Trans-\nlators^ Address to the King\n(which apart from the titlepage,\nis on the opening page) occurs\nthe well-known passage about\nthe \" censures of ill-meaning and\ndiscontented persons,\" the \" cal-\numniations and hard interpreta-\ntions of other men,\" and the\n\" bitter censures and unchari-\ntable imputations,\" against\nwhich the Translators felt them-\nselves to be \" supported within\nby the truth and innocency of a\ngood conscience.\" These words\nappear to me not inappropriate\nto recent foreign attacks on me\nin connection with my work.\nSee, for instance, Count Perov-\nsky's quotation in the Journal\n(xxvii. 175) of an article in\nwhich I am accused of being an\nemissary of the \" atheistic Inter-\nnational \", and cp. Journal,\nxxvii. 124.\n[13.] There is nothing about\nviolets on this page, but it is\nclear from the record that this\nword is not necessarily a book-\ntest. The only sense in which it\nwould appear to apply to Mr and\nMrs Stansfield's house would be\na prophetic one. At about 12.30\non the day of the sitting, that is,\nactually during the sitting, but\nabout an hour after the relevant\nwords were spoken, Mrs Stans-\nfield brought Mr Stansfield a\nbunch of violets to smell, and\nthey had some conversation\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 159\n[14.]\n\" Within a span of this\nbook, it seems to me there's a\nbook that deals with theology,\ntheology ;\nsomething to do with\na modern view, modern view\ndescription given, the title given\non the outside would lead you to\nbelieve it was a new light, a new\nlight on religion, yet the book\nitself didn't appear to be very\nrecent or new to me.\" (Right.)\n[15.] Moving a little back to-\nwards the left on the same shelf\n\u2014there are not many, she says,\nto look at\u2014between the 1st book\nshe gave you on the left, the first\nbook was the 5th, you know ;\nbetween this and beginning of\nshelf on outside there's an allu-\nsion to a joke, something that\nwould remind you of a great joke\nthat you and Dora used to have\ntogether, a joke, a joke, a joke\nthat you and Dora used to have\ntogether. A joke, a joke, a joke.\nThe joke, of course, is an old one\nnow, but it is one you have been\nthinking of recently, so she\nthinks you will be reminded of it\nat once.\n[16.] Now, Mr Bill, ask if there\nis a light in this room. She mean\nan artificial light that can't be\nused ; she felt there is a light\nhere that should affect those\nbooks ; it must be near them\nit can't be used [repeated four\ntimes]. And it can't be used, Mr\nBill.\nabout them, as it seemed unusual\nand unexpected to gather violets\nin September.\n[14.] This just misses being a\ngood hit. On the second shelf\nup is a copy of Dr James Moff-\natt's translation of the Bible\n(first published in 1913), of\nwhich it is very true to say that\nit is not a new book, but that it\nthrows \" a new light \" on reli-\ngion. The words \" a new trans-\nlation \" appear on the covers of\nthe three volumes. Unfortun-\nately these volumes are more\nthan a span from the Bible, 2 ft.\n7 inches, to be precise.\n[15.] Counting on the method\ndescribed in [9] above, the 2nd\nand 3rd volumes on the shelf,\nthat is, between the beginning of\nthe shelf and the 5th volume, are\ntwo volumes of Pictures from\nPunch. These volumes did re-\nmind Mr Irving of a joke of\nwhich the Communicator was\nvery fond (though he cannot say\nwhen he thought of it last),\nespecially as Mrs Irving had been\nvery fond of Punch.\n[16.] This does not appear to\napply to anything in the room.\n\f160 Rev. W. 8. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part\n[17.] Mr Bill, when you look\nout of this window I get a feeling\n\u2014Dora is making me feel this\nthere is something if you look\none way, something is blocking\nthe view, you can only see a\nshort distance ;\nby turning your\nhead and looking the other way\nyou can see a long way.\n[18.] Is it that house, Dora, or\none near it ? Mr Bill, right up\nclose to this house, is there some-\nthing to be sold, do you know ?\nDora says, for sale, for sale. And\nit feels something close, right up\nwhere I am, close.\n[19.] What you talking about,\nDora, slissiter ? What's a solici-\ntor to do with this house just\nnow? Dora wonders if they have\nbeen talking a great deal about\na solicitor in this house just now.\nSeem very strong there indeed.\n[20.] Will you ask if the name\n\u2014it's a common name\u2014but will\nyou ask if the name Evans has\nbeen mentioned there, talked of\nthere at all ? Evans, Evans.\nHave you got that, Mr Bill ?\n(Yes.)\nNow, Mr Bill, that's all from\nthat place. It's all she could be\nsure of getting. (A nice lot.)\n[17.] In this room a person\nstanding with his back to the\nstove would have on his left a\nsmall window, the view through\nwhich is blocked by a tree, facing\nhim a large window, the view\nfrom which is blocked partly by\na garage and partly by a fence\nwith trees beyond, and on his\nright two windows with a glazed\ndoor between, through which\nthere is a fine distant view ex-\ntending to ten miles.\n[18.] The house next door but\none and at least two nearly op-\nposite are for sale and have\nboards up to that effect.\n[19.] There had been occa-\nsional conversation about solici-\ntors in connection with the\nBallard fund and in connection\nwith the affairs of Mr Stans-\nfield's sister, whose husband had\ndied during the summer. Letters\nreferring to solicitors in both\ncases were lying on the desk.\n[20.] The wedding of Mr and\nMrs Stansfield's friend M. Evans,\nwhich took place three days\nafter the sitting, had been men-\ntioned several times during the\nweeks before the sitting.\nAll the above statements referring to Mr and Mrs Stanfield's\nhouse are based on signed statements by Mr Stansfield, corroborated,\nso far as they are concerned, by Mrs Stansfield and Mrs Ballard.\nThe books (except for the album) were verified in the presence of\na medical man whose name is known to me.\n\f122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 161\nIt will be seen, to sum up, that of the above 20 statements, ten\nare correct (nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20), six were partly correct\n(nos. 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15), three are doubtful (nos. 11, 12, 13), and\nonly one appears to be wrong (no. 16). Not all the hits are of equal\nvalue, of course, but several are decidedly striking, particularly\nthe approximation to the name Ballard, the name Evans, and the\nreference to rollers. On the whole, taking the circumstances into\nconsideration, this series of 20 impressions provides good evidence\nthat knowledge of Mr and Mrs StansflekTs house was obtained m\nsome supernormal manner. The important point in this connection\nis the fact that there is no direct link between the medium and the\nStansfields' house, since the house is unknown to medium, sitter\nand recorder, and nobody in the Stansneld family has sat with\nMrs Leonard. If the result be due to telepathy, it is in part telepathy\nof a very unusual, if not unique kind, since the medium would on\nthis hypothesis have received an impression of conversations in a\nhouse unknown to her and not even having any connection with\nthat house.\n\fREVIEW.\nOlivier Leroy, Les hommes salamandres.

Leroy is a devout Roman Catholic ; no wonder therefore that\namong the evidence he ably marshals lives of saints figure con-\nspicuously. Now I am far from denying that in this domain as in\nthat of levitation hagiography may\u2014perhaps does\u2014supply us with\nevidence which must not always be lightly set aside. But why refer\nto \" martyrs' lives \" as to which the writer himself admits that in\nthem \" everything occurs in an epic atmosphere where history\nsuffocates \"\n(p. 16) ? The author's thesis, favourable to occasional\nhuman \" incombustibility \", gains nothing by such testimony\u2014if we\nmay call it \" testimony \"\n\u2014but rather the reverse.\nIn the next chapter, on medieval fire-ordeals, we meet with the\nextraordinary case of Emma, daughter of Richard II., duke of\nNormandy, and mother of St Edward, who undertook to refute\nrumours current as to the character of her relations with the Bishop\nof Winchester by walking barefooted over nine (possibly fourteen)\nred-hot coulters. The experiment succeeded. What is the evidential\nvalue of this \" life \" I do not know, but it is perhaps significant that,\nas pointed out by M. Leroy, the very sceptical Bayle seems, in his\nDictionary, to be ready to believe in such facts.\nIn chapter 3 we meet with D. D. Home, an Englishman called\nRichardson (end of 17th century), whose performances at Lady\nSunderland's are described by John Evelyn, Bruno Kiong, a\nChinese, and others.\nMarie Sonnet, nicknamed the Salamander, is the subject of the\nnext chapter. This lady flourished in the second quarter of the\n18th century, was connected with the Saint Medard \" convulsionists\"\n162\n\f[PART 122] Review 163\nin Paris, if not one of them, and figures in a protocol, dated 1 May\n1731 and signed by eleven persons, which M. Leroy quotes. An\nEnglish peer (\" milord Edouard de Rumond Perth \"), two priests,\nCarre de Montgeron, and other persons of position are among the\nsignatories. Marie Sonnet is alleged to have remained lying for\nthirty-six minutes (with intervals) over a very fierce chimney-fire,\nher head resting on one footstool and her feet on the other, without\nany harm being done either to her body or to the sheet in which\nshe was wrapped (she had no clothes on). \" Sometimes the flames\nrose over her, which seemed to us quite supernatural \". How, I\nwonder, can we explain in a \" normal \" way such an account,\nunless we impugn the authenticity of the protocol ?\nIn chapter 5 we are brought in touch with the fire-walk, Polynesian\nand Indian. Here we have before us an eye-witness's testimony\nwhose value can hardly be over-estimated. Mgr Despatures, (now)\nRoman Catholic bishop of Mysore, narrates in detail an extra-\nordinary performance of the kind witnessed by him in 1921 in the\nPark of the Royal palace of Mysore. The performer was a Turk\nwho did not enter the names himself, but many people present did.\nAs the Royal musicians were passing through them the Bishop\nnoticed that the flames seemed to avoid the instruments they were\ncarrying \" et effleuraient les feuilles de musique sans les enrlammer\n\"\n(p. 42). M. Leroy has obtained valuable corroborative evidence\nfrom four other eye-witnesses. Their statements confirm in a\ngeneral way Mgr Despatures's account, and the fact that they are\nnot free from discrepancies, though unfortunate, is after all of\nsecondary importance.\nThe list of references to cases of \" fire-walking \" given in various\npublications which the reader will find on pp. 72-3 of M. Leroy's\nlittle book is not quite complete. A recent and very striking case\ndescribed in our Journal (xxiv. 278-84) has remained unknown to\nhim. However, it is satisfactory to note that he refers more than\nonce to the S.P.R. publications.\nAfter a chapter on \" theories \" and some fifteen pages of \" notes\nand documents \", the book closes with a letter of Abbe Journet's\nto the writer. Both the latter and the Abbe are chiefly interested,\nso far as the theoretic aspect of the problem is concerned, in the\nexamination of the question whether human incombustibility is of\na \" natural \" or a \" supernatural \" origin. And if \" supernatural \",\nof what character : whether angelic, diabolical or divine. Into\nthis side of the question I will not enter.\nI cannot however refrain from quoting a significant passage.\n\"Everywhere and always,\" M. Leroy says, \"the supernatural is\ncharacterised by a certain shyness. % Man's incombustibility is\nundeniable ; it remains however relative both in time and as to\n\f164 Review [part 122]\nthe violence of the fire. . . . Wounds close themselves at Lourdes, but\nnew limbs do not grow [my italics]. The body of those levitated does\nnot rise high nor go far \"\n(p. 75).\nTo me this is prima facie evidence (I do not say absolute evidence)\nthat the so-called religious supernatural\u2014supposing it to exist\u2014\nis not supernatural in the strict sense of the word, but that we have\nhere to deal with facts at best supernormal and subject to laws\nwhich we may hope to fathom\u2014if not to master\u2014some day. The\nsimplest explanation is not always the right one, it is true, but\nsurely there is a good deal to be said in support of such a suggestion.\nFor otherwise such a \" shyness \"\u2014a shyness much to be regretted\n\u2014would be much harder to explain.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n\fEXPERIMENTS IN SUPERNORMAL PERCEPTION\nAT A DISTANCE 1\nBy S. G. Soal\nPART I\nPRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS\nIntroduction. Experiments in telepathy in which the agent and\npercipient are separated by a distance of many miles possess one\nindisputable advantage over those where agent and percipient work\nin the same room or in adjoining rooms. In the latter type of ex-\nperiment it is extremely difficult to rule out entirely the possibility\nthat the agent or transmitter may imwittingly and unintentionally\nconvey information to the percipient or guesser by means of slight\nmovements, changes of tone, facial expression and the like. In a\nword, the guesser may be getting clues through his ordinary channels\nof sense though neither he nor the agent may be aware of it.\nSuch accidental conveyance of knowledge is hardly to be assumed\nin cases where the agent and percipient are miles apart at the time\nof the experiment provided always that reasonable precautions have\nbeen taken in selecting and guarding the objects intended for\ntransmission. Deliberate collusion between the experimenters and\npercipients is still, of course, a contingency to be reckoned with, but\nfor reasons which will be apparent later I feel perfectly certain will\nnot be suspected in the present experiments.\nIn spite of their indubitable advantage in excluding a direct\ntransfer of ideas by normal means experiments at a distance are\nrelatively rare in comparison with those in which the parties con-\ncerned are in close proximity. Nor can it be claimed, I think, that\nsuch experiments as are on record have been remarkably successful\nor for the most part conclusive in any way. There are, of course,\nscattered throughout the annals of the society numerous cases of\napparent spontaneous perception at a distance and in certain of\nthese the wealth and convergence of detail are so circumstantial as\nto make chance coincidence an unlikely explanation.\n1\n[As in the case of the recently published report on experiments in clair-\nvoyance (Proceedings, xxxix. 375-414), the reader must be warned that the\nresults of the experiments have been entirely negative. Hon. Ed.]\nm 165\n\f166 8. G. Soal [part\nNext to the spontaneous cases we have a type of experimentation\nwhich is best illustrated by the Miles-Ramsden 1\nand Wales-\nSamuels 2\nrecords. In the latter example the agent, here represented\nby Mr Hubert Wales, did not as a rule deliberately choose an object\nor event to be transmitted at a definite time, but allowed the\npercipient, Miss Samuels, to post him details of her dreams which\nwere then compared with any appropriate events that had happened\nin Mr Wales's environment during the preceding day. A similar\nprocedure was adopted in many of the Miles-Ramsden experiments.\nThe scope for chance coincidence under such conditions is of course\nextremely large and practically incalculable, and moreover in cases\nwhere the percipient can picture the type of scenery in which the\nagent is situated, he or she has a tolerable chance of scoring hits by\nimagining events natural to that scenery. A propos of Mr Wales's\nexperiments I must mention that during the months of August-\nSeptember 1926, at Miss Samuels's suggestion, I assumed the role\nof Mr Wales and received every day from Miss Samuels a copy of\nher dreams and impressions. During the whole of this experiment\nI was staving near Bettws-y-Coed in North Wales, while Miss\nSamuels, whom at that period I had corresponded with but never\nmet in the flesh, remained in London. The result was practically\na complete failure. I must add, however, in fairness to Miss\nSamuels, that while she might easily have seen me climbing moun-\ntains and peering down precipices, she in fact did nothing of the\nkind, and the type of dream she described would I believe have had\nan equal chance of being realised in the flats of Essex or on the\nhills of Wales.\nSo far as my own experiments with Miss Samuels are concerned,\nI should declare unhesitatingly that there was no supernormal\nperception on her part, but I confess that when I came to read Mr\nWales's long report, I felt curiously unable to make up my mind\nwhether the most striking coincidences there recorded were genuine\ncases of telepathy or only very lucky hits. But in such cases as\nthe \" Hannah Blodgett \" case of Mrs Piper and in many of my own\nexperiences with Mrs Cooper, I have never entertained any serious\ndoubt that the coincidences were due to something more than the\nblind play of chance.\nMy recent experience with the guessing capabilities of over 600\npeople for a period of over a year has only confirmed me in the view\nthat the success of such mediums as Mrs Piper, Mrs Leonard, and\nMrs Cooper, cannot, whatever else their explanation, be ascribed\ntotally to chance.\nI have found that the average guesser experimenting over many\n1\nProceedings (1907), xxi. 60-93 ; (1914), xxvii. 279-317.\n2\nProceedings (1920), xxxi. 124-217.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 167\nweeks under conditions which I shall presently describe, wins indeed\na partial success at long intervals, but does not succeed in piling\nup one sharply defined success upon another.\nBut in the Wales-Samuels records, as in so much of the work in\nexperimental telepathy with objects ill-adapted to statistical\ncomputation, there is a vague intangible quality about even the\nbest hits. Many of the remarks of the percipient can indeed be\nmade to apply to circumstances in the environment of the specified\nagent if a too rigid time limit is not imposed, but one feels that one\ncould fit these same remarks to the day's experience of many\nanother individual in the world. In short, one feels that the\ncoincidences are not sufficiently detailed to produce a conviction\nthat they are uniquely applicable to one set of circumstances and\nto no other. The same observation, of course, would apply to a fair\namount of the material obtained at Mrs Leonard's sittings at which\nthe time limit is often so wide as to be practically non-existent, but\nI feel certain that in a series of sittings like the Troubridge-Eadclyfi'e-\nHall series, the ensemble of statements furnished over the entire\nperiod would not be applicable to any other persons than the actual\nsitters or their immediate circle.\nExperiments in telepathy at a distance in which the conditions\nare more rigid and sharply defined than those described in the Miles-\nRamsden or Wales-Samuels reports have been recorded from time\nto time during the past twenty years. We have, for instance, the\nexperiments of Usher and Burt 1\nin 1907, in which an agent in\nBristol attempted to transmit drawings and playing cards tele-\npathically to a percipient in London at pre-arranged times. In\na second series by the same authors the agent was in Prague and\nthe percipient in London. The resemblance between the drawings\nof percipient and agent claimed by Messrs Usher and Burt as\n\" successes \" appears in my judgment to have been so occasional\nand so slight as to be practically non-existent. Thirty attempts\nwere made to transmit the image of a playing card, and here the\nexperimenters seem to have been more successful. I have scored\nthe first 25 of these guesses on Fisher's system, and the mean score\nis 16-11, which gives a deviation from the theoretical mean (11-18)\ncorresponding to 2-46 x standard deviation. Such a result might\nbe expected to occur by chance about once in 33 such sets of 25\nguesses. The result is suggestive, but of course inconclusive.\nOf recent years various experiments of a similar kind have been\ncarried out by individual members of M. Rene Warcollier's group\nfor experimental telepathy, the agents and percipients being in\n1\nAnnates des Sciences Psychiques (1910), xx. 14-21, 40-53. One saving\nvirtue of the work of Usher and Burt is the detailed description of every\nexperiment. We are not given snippets.\n\f168 8. G. Soal [part\ndifferent parts of France. A number of attempts at transmission\nof ideas and drawings from New York to Paris and vice versa were\nmade in 1924 between an American group under the direction of\nProfessor Gardner Murphy, and a French group under M. Rene\nWarcollier.\nTo form a critical estimate of either Warcollier's home experi-\nments (carried out in Paris at the Institut International Meta-\npsychique or elsewhere) or of his trans-Atlantic attempts, is ex-\ntremely difficult for several reasons. M. Warcollier is an inde-\nfatigable experimenter, extremely ingenious in planning new\nexperiments, and his enthusiasm has given a great stimulus to the\nstudy of telepathy on the Continent and in America. Moreover,\nhe has brought considerable powers of introspection and psycho-\nlogical insight to bear on the interpretation of his results. But as\nM. Warcollier's methods and conclusions diverge very considerably\nfrom those of the present investigation, a few suggestions and\nfriendly criticisms will not, I hope, be out of place. 1\nIn the first place it does not seem to me that M. Warcollier has\npaid quite sufficient attention to the work of demonstrating beyond\ncavil the basic fact of telepathy. He has perhaps been a little too\noccupied with the psychological mechanism of the process. His\nvarious reports consist largely of collections of favourable examples\nwhich seem to be expressly chosen to illustrate various aspects of\nthe mechanism of transmission and reception. Some of these\nexamples of telepathy are certainly striking, but I do not think\ntheir individual quality is sufficiently high to compel belief in their\nsupernormal character. Although the subject matter chosen for\ntransmission\u2014consisting as it does of complicated sketches,\ngrotesque combinations of objects, gestures, etc.\u2014precludes a\nstrict application of the laws of probability, yet I do not think this\nneed prevent M. Warcollier from instituting a series of control\nexperiments to test his fundamental hypothesis of telepathy.\nA large number of drawings executed by his various agents and\npercipients might be copied on to similar slips of cardboard and\nthese mixed in a bag. A committee could then draw out a con-\nsiderable number of pairs or trios of sketches from the bag and\nadjudicate marks according to the amount of resemblance shown\nby each pair or group of sketches. Corresponding pairs or groups\ncould then be chosen from Warcollier's actual experiments and\nscored in a similar way. This is, of course, merely intended as a\nvery rough suggestion of the way in which a control might be\norganised.\nAnother suggestion I would make is that M. Warcollier should, in\nhis reports, give us more information as to the exact conditions\n1\nSee also my letter in the Journal 8.P.R. (1931), xxvii. 130-5.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 169\nunder which each evening's work is carried out. I can perhaps best\nillustrate my meaning by an example. On p. 42 (Plate 1) of his\nConference sur la Telepathic. Experimentale (1926) M. Warcollier\nrecords that on 24 October 1925 M. De. drew a sketch resembling\npart of a flight of stairs, while on the same evening Mme M. drew\nan outline which bears a certain resemblance to the drawing of\nM. De. One would like to be told (a) whether the drawings were\nexecuted at the same time and, if not, what was the interval of time\nbetween them, (b) how many sketches were made by M. De. and\nMme M. in the course of the evening, (c) if several sketches were\nmade by one or both, what was the guiding principle of selection ?\nIt is, of course, certain that if vast numbers of experiments are\nmade week after week and year after year, chance alone will produce\ncoincidences of varying degrees of complexity, and a judicious\nselection of suitable cases could doubtless be made which would\nappear to illustrate a theory of telepathy previously held by the\nexperimenter or even suggest to his mind a novel theory. But if\nthese cases are not really cases of telepathy, what becomes of the\ntheory ?\nMoreover, it appears to me that many of the psychological\nphenomena noted by M. Warcollier are quite consistent with other\nhypotheses than that of telepathy. When, for instance, two\nmembers of M. Warcollier's group draw sketches on the same\nevening which show a considerable degree of resemblance, this may\nbe due to supernormal contagion it is true, but it may also be due to\na variety of normal causes. It may be that these two persons had,\nin the morning, been both impressed by some striking advertisement\nin the same newspaper or on a hoarding. They would perhaps be\nentirely unable to recognise the common source of their inspiration\nwhen they came to make their drawings.\nSpeaking of his experiments carried out at the Institut Meta-\npsychique, in which the agents and percipients were in different\nrooms, M. Warcollier states :\n1\n\"At the beginning of our experi-\nments we obtained only 6 per cent, of successes, then we passed to\n25 per cent, and to 35 per cent., not absolute successes but relative\nones supplying evidence sufficient to maintain scientific curiosity in\nus.\" We have, of course, no exact definition of the term \" success\n\"\nhere, and we can only form a rough judgment from the specimens\ncited by the author in his various reports.\nFor instance, it is not clear whether M. Warcollier claims as a\nsuccess a coincidence not predetermined by the experimenter. He\ncertainly quotes many cases in which the percipient's impression\ndoes not correspond with the object selected by the agent but with\nsome incident which happened in the agent's environment previous\n1\nInstitut Metapsychique International, Les Conferences en 1926, p. 41.\n\f170 8. G. Soul [part\nto the experiment. Are these coincidences counted in the 35 per-\ncent, of successes ?\nIt would appear, in the large majority of cases, that the material\nfor transmission is chosen by personal preference and not on a\nchance basis. That is, the objects are not chosen at random from\na large collection of varied types but by individual caprice or as\nbeing suitable for testing a certain psychological theory. Now,\nmay not the increase from 6 per cent, to 35 per cent, in the number\nof successes be due to the fact that the members of the little group\nare becoming familiar with one another's mental preferences ? If\nA knows that B has a passion for drawing cats, he has more chance\nof making successful hits than C who is a stranger to B. Of course,\nif coincidences are admitted with events not predetermined by the\nexperimenter, the scope of chance is indefinitely enlarged. It is as\nif a man, aiming at a target, missed, and then claimed that at least\nhe had hit a neighbouring tree.\nM. Warcollier tells us that his percipients are seldom very success-\nful in guessing numbers, letters of the alphabet and playing cards.\nNow this is very disconcerting when we remember that many of\nthe earlier experiments of the S.P.R. showed a good deal of apparent\nsuccess with just such material. It may be, of course, as M. War-\ncollier suggests, that when the percipient is asked to guess a number,\nthe conscious action of his mind and his predilections for particular\nnumbers, inhibit the telepathic impression from emerging ; but\nanother explanation appears to be equally probable. Letters and\nnumbers are perfectly clear cut and, as a rule, the alternative to\nsuccess is absolute failure. But with concrete objects, pictures,\netc., it is not so. Even when the percipient has not guessed the\nobject chosen by the agent, it is often possible for the experimenter\nto claim a partial success on the grounds that there is some associa-\ntive connection between the percipient's impression and the actual\nobject. In cases where the association is obvious to everyone as,\nfor instance (Agent : Australia\u2014Percipient : Kangaroo) no one\ncould object to the scoring of a success, but the association may be\nof a much vaguer sort, as for example (Agent : Cobra\u2014Percipient\na Tropical Scene). If we admit such coincidences as the last, the\nscope of chance is, of course, much widened. And when we consider\ncases in which the associative link is obvious only to the percipient\nhimself, we are on very precarious ground, as it is so easy to discover\nassociations in one's own mind even between, apparently, incon-\ngruous ideas. If, as M. Warcollier seems to believe, telepathy often\nworks by very obscure associations apparent only to the per-\ncipient himself, then it is difficult to see how science is going to deal\nwith it objectively at all.\nIt is hoped that M. Warcollier will in the near future, while still\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 171\nretaining the material which appears to yield him the most success,\norganise such a series of control experiments as will confirm or\nconfute his fundamental hypothesis of telepathy.\nThe origin of the present experiments. The first use of wireless as\nan aid to the organisation of mass experiments in telepathy was\nmade by Professor Gardner Murphy of Columbia University.\nProfessor Murphy carried out on 3 March 1924 an experiment in\nwhich a group of forty agents operated from Chicago. The experi-\nment appears to have been highly inconclusive, owing perhaps to\nthe lack of control tests and statistical standards of comparison.\nOn 16 February 19*27 the British Broadcasting Corporation kindly\nallowed the use of their organisation for the carrying out of an\nexperiment in long-distance telepathy by the Society under the\ndirection of Dr Woolley, Sir Oliver Lodge acting as announcer. In\nthis experiment a small group of agents, one of whom was the\nwriter, attempted to broadcast telepathic impressions of objects\nshown to them by Dr Woolley for a period of three minutes each.\nReplies from 24,659 listeners were received and examined by the\nSociety. The impossibility of securing a second evening for the\npurpose of a control experiment caused the subsequent evaluation\nof the results to be somewhat inconclusive.\nWhen, therefore, Dr Woolley suggested in July 1927 that I should\ncarry out a series of further experiments with a batch of the appa-\nrently successful of the B.B.C. percipients, I readily agreed. In\nthe second week of September 1927 a notice was drafted and sent\nout to some 150 persons who had scored partial successes 1\nin the\nFebruary experiment, asking them if they would be willing to\ndevote half-an-hour each Wednesday evening in their own homes\nfor at least three months to recording their impressions of objects\nwhich would be shown to a group of agents meeting each week at\nthe Rooms of the Society. Each person who expressed willingness to\nco-operate, was on 30 September sent a copy of the general instruc-\ntions which follow.\nGeneral Instructions\n1 . The experiments will take place each week on Wednesday evening\nbetween 8.30 and 9 p.m., beginning on Wednesday, October 5th, 1927,\nthis time suiting the maj ority of those who have consented to take part.\n2. The attempts at transmission will in general be made from the\nSociety's headquarters at 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1,\nbut on certain evenings the agents may attempt to transmit from\ntheir own homes.\n3. Three experiments will, as a rule, be attempted during the\nhalf-hour, ten minutes being devoted to each experiment.\n1\nFor examples of these see Dr Woolley's paper in Proceedings (1928),\nxxxviii. 1-9.\n\f172 8. G. Soal [part\n4. On the day of the experiment, please see that your watch or\ntimepiece is adjusted to Greenwich Mean Time. Whenever possible,\nthis adjustment should be made by means of the wireless time-signal\nof the same day as the experiment.\n5. You will probably find it advantageous to work in a darkened\nroom, reclining comfortably on a couch or easy chair. In the past\nthe best results would appear to have been obtained by using this\nmethod. Try to shut out all sense impressions from outside. This\nis best done by working in a quiet dark room. Having made\nyourself comfortable, endeavour to compose your mind to a state\nwhich resembles that immediately preceding sleep. Do not let\nyour mind dwell on the events of the day, but try to keep it as passive\nas possible while holding fast to the simple idea that you are going\nto visualise something, or if you work by mental hearing, you will\nkeep your mind awake only to the idea that you are going to hear\nsomething.\n6. When you receive impressions that you feel to be telepathic,\nin order not to disturb and break up your passive state, you will find\nit best to call out your impressions aloud to a friend who, sitting at\na table with a torch and a watch, will note down each impression\ntogether with the exact time at which it occurs.\n7. All impressions whether of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch,\nemotion, or mental pictures, should be noted together with the\ncorresponding times.\n8. At the end of the experiments copy your notes on to a postcard\nif there is room for them. Otherwise use a letter. Underline those\nimpressions which seem to you to be most telepathic. The postcard or\nletter should contain your full name and address, and should be\nwitnessed by the friend who assisted you by making the notes.\n9. In general you will not be told what is the nature of the object\nor idea the agents are trying to transmit, i.e. whether it is a playing\ncard, picture, etc. The reason for this is that it is not advisable\nfor your imagination to be switched off on to any definite track.\nIn certain experiments, however, detailed instructions may have to\nbe given, and you will be duly notified of these before the experiment.\n10. If on the morning following the experiment you remember\nany striking or curious dream which you think may have a telepathic\norigin (a deferred or latent impression), the Society will be very\ngrateful if you can kindly send them an account of it.\n11.

Leaving aside\n8 members of M. Rene Warcollier's group for experimental tele-\npathy who joined the present experiment in February 1928, there\nwere 127 persons who acted as percipients during the first year s\nwork. Of these 127, 118 resided in England and Wales and the\nremaining nine were distributed as follows : five in Scotland and\nthe Shetland Isles, three in Ireland, and one in Budapest (no. 45a).\nOnly two of the 127 percipients (nos. 75 and 37) were personally\nacquainted with me in October 1927, but two others (nos. 13 and\n36a) made my acquaintance during the year.\nThe first year's work extended over 36 weekly sessions, and\nthe percipients may be classified as follows : four percipients took\npart in 30 or more weeks' work, 16 in 20 or more, 39 in 12 or more,\n90 in four or more, and 37 in less than four weeks' work.\nThe personnel of the agents, 1927-1928. The first 22 sittings\n(5 October 1927-14 March 1928) were held at the Society's Rooms\nat 31 Tavistock Square. In addition to myself, the agents during\nthe first 12 weeks (5 October-21 December 1927) were Mr and Mrs\nFernald, Miss Hood, and Mr Odell, the last of whom joined the\ngroup on 2 November. All these ladies and gentlemen, with the\nexception of Mr Odell, had acted as agents on the occasion of\nthe B.B.C. experiment of February 1927, and the best thanks of\nthe Society are due to them for the large amount of time they gave\nup to the present experiment.\nAfter December 1927 Mr and Mrs Fernald and Miss Hood were\nunfortunately unable to continue their valuable assistance owing\nto pressure of other work. Between 11 January and 1 February\nMiss Newton, Miss Carruthers, Col. Hayward, Mr Robertson, and\na friend, very kindly stepped in to fill the gap, and the Society\nwishes to thank these for their kind interest in the experiment.\nBetween 8 February and 4 July 1928 the work of transmission was\ncarried out in the main by a new group consisting of Prof, and\nMrs J. Mackenzie, Mr and Mrs Hughes, Mr Odell, and myself.\nOn 21 March the place of transmission was, mainly for the con-\nvenience of Prof, and Mrs Mackenzie, transferred from 31 Tavistock\nSquare to their house at 2 Adelaide Road, Chalk Farm, N.W. To\n\f174 S. G. Soal [part\nProf, and Mrs Mackenzie the warmest thanks of the Society are\ndue for their kindness in providing a home for the experiment for\nupwards of two years. Not only have Prof, and Mrs Mackenzie\ntaken part regularly in the weekly transmissions ;\nthey have also\non several occasions taken charge of the experiment on evenings\nwhen I was unavoidably absent. To Mr Odell, a Member of the\nSociety, we owe a special debt of gratitude. This gentleman not\nonly attended a large number of the 1927-1928 sittings but also\nassisted at the majority of the 1928-1929 meetings, from which he\nhad to travel to his residence at Kingston-on-Thames at the late\nhour of 11 p.m.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned names, we would thank Mr\nTheodore Besterman for taking an active part in the sitting on\n19 October 1927 ; Miss Wallace for attending a sitting on 18\nJanuary 1928 ; Miss Boucher James for attending sittings on\n22 February 1928 and 7 March 1928 ; Miss B. J. King for attending\na sitting on 4 July 1928 ; Mrs Lewis and Mrs Hall-Haines and her\nsister, who were present on 30 January 1929.\nPsychic qualifications of the principal agents. In the opinion of\nmany investigators it is not everyone who can act successfully as\nthe agent in telepathic experiments. From the records of sittings\nwith good mental percipients like Mrs Leonard it would certainly\nappear that the minds of some individuals are more easily \" pene-\ntrated \" by the medium than those of others. Certain persons\nseem to be given a very considerable amount of supernormal\ninformation at sittings while others come away from every sitting\ntotally unconvinced that the medium has made any real contact\nwith their present or past environments. In the opinion of Dr\nT. W. Mitchell it is those persons who possess a slight degree of\nmental dissociation that will be most accessible to penetration\nby a good percipient. Such persons are often those whose minds\npossess strong undercurrents of activity which are never consciously\nbrought to bear upon the pressing needs of everyday life. People\nof this type often possess stores of useful mental goods which they\nare unable to bring at a moment's notice into the mental shop-\nwindow of consciousness. We all of course possess a vast number\nof mental impressions which at any given moment lie far beneath\nthe threshold of consciousness. But in certain individuals this\nhidden material would appear to be more organised and active\nthan in others. Not infrequently these mental streams cut off\nfrom the main river of conscious life find an outlet by means of\nautomatic writing. Poems, literary compositions, answers to ques-\ntions upon topics of interest, passages from books read in childhood,\nare written without hesitation by the subject whose conscious\nmind is only vaguely aware of the movements his hand is making.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 175\nIt is most probably these mental undercurrents that are perceived\nby the trance consciousness of a psychic medium. If this theory\nis correct the people who are capable of producing automatisms\nought to make the best agents in telepathic experiments.\nIt must be remembered, however, that mediums seldom seem\nto divine the thoughts that are in one's mind at the moment. They\ngive us rather details of incidents which have impressed us in the\npast\u2014most often in the recent past\u2014but which are not occupying\nour thoughts at the precise hour when we visit the medium. I\npersonally have found that it was difficult for a medium to give me\na name when I was holding that name in my mind. A little later\nin the sitting when I was thinking of something else the name was\ngiven correctly. We ought therefore in telepathic experiments\nalways to make allowance for the possibility that ideas may be\ncapable of being transferred to a percipient only when they have\nceased to occupy the conscious mind of the agent. In the present\nexperiments, in cases where two or more objects were concentrated\non during the same evening opportunity was given for the per-\ncipients to record impressions relating to object no. 1 in the interval\nwhen object no. 2 was being thought of by the agents.\nWe must now enquire whether or not there was any a priori\nreason to believe that the persons who acted as agents in the present\nseries of experiments possessed any special qualifications for this\nrole. The agents who took part regularly in the main experiment\n(1928-1929) were Prof. J. S. Mackenzie, Mrs Mackenzie, Mr Odell\nand myself. Prof. Mackenzie has informed me in writing that in\nthe year 1925 he carried out ten or more experiments with a friend,\nMiss Fox, Prof. Mackenzie acting as agent. In all these experi-\nments Miss Fox was the percipient and remained at Clifton (near\nBristol). For approximately the first two-thirds of this series of\nten experiments Prof. Mackenzie was at Brockweir near Tintern,\nand for the remaining experiments he was at Cambridge. As to\nthe results of these experiments I will quote Prof. Mackenzie's\nown words from his letter to me (13 September 1931) :\n\" Un-\ndoubtedly the successes were much too detailed to be due to chance.\"\nProf. Mackenzie, I should mention, is Emeritus Professor of Logic\nand Moral Philosophy in the University of South Wales. He was\na Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and is a distinguished\nwriter on ethics and philosophy. In a book published within the\nlast few months on Cosmic Problems he makes some reference to\nhis psychic experiences. Prof. Mackenzie has only once consulted\na (well-known) medium. Two intimate friends who have both\nbeen dead several years purported to communicate. \" Their\ncommunications,\" says Prof. Mackenzie, \" were very characteristic\nbut comparatively trivial.\"\n\f176 S. G. Soal [part\nMrs Mackenzie \" considers that she has had some success with\nmediums, but thinks it best not to give names or particulars. She\nmay be writing on the subject herself.\" As regards experiments\nin telepathy Mrs Mackenzie \" has nothing to report.\" Mrs Mac-\nkenzie, I should add, is a distinguished educationalist and very\nwell known. Though I am not at liberty to give any details of\nMrs Mackenzie's experiences with mediums I may venture to say\nthat a year or two ago she mentioned some incidents which im-\npressed me very favourably.\nI need hardly say that Prof. Mackenzie's judgment upon his\nexperiments with Miss Fox, coming as it does from so cautious and\ncritical a thinker, must be accorded great weight.\nMiss Fox (Percipient no. 31a = 622) took part in both the 1927-\n1928 experiments and in the 1928-1929 series. It will be seen by\nreference to Table I that no. 31a=622 did thirteen weeks' work in\nthe session 1927-1928, scoring two successes\u2014one on 8 February\n1928 and the other on 16 May 1928. One of these successes is of\nthe \" previsional \" type (16 May), and on this occasion Prof.\nMackenzie was present as agent. On the other occasion (8 Feb-\nruary) only Mrs Mackenzie was present. In the 1928-1929 series\nthe percipient did only three weeks' work and did not score any\nsuccess (score = 0\/1 80). She was at Bristol during these experi-\nments and possibly her psychic powers were temporarily in abeyance.\nI have known Mr Odell for several years. A man of scientific\nattainments and cautious critical habits of mind, he is keenly\ninterested in psychical research. He informs me that he has never\nsat with a medium but that he has acted as agent sometimes in\ntelepathic experiments. He has had one or two successes as agent\nbut he does not consider these to be beyond what chance could\nhave produced. He considers that he has no special psychic powers.\nOf this I am not able to judge, but I can say that his genial and\nsympathetic personality made him a most valuable asset at our\nweekly meetings. If Mr Odell was absent things never seemed\nquite the same.\nLastly there remains myself to account for. I am, I believe, the\nonly one of the little group that has ever been afflicted with the\nmental distemper of automatism. I first discovered in the summer\nof 1923 that if I closed my eyes and concentrated hard upon some\ntrivial fonmila of mathematics and then abandoned conscious\ncontrol of my hand to a nervous impulse, I could produce coherent\nwriting. This writing sometimes differed in character from my\nnormal handwriting. It could only be produced, I found, while\nmy mind was intensely distracted by hard conscious effort, and\nwhen I brought my mind back to what my hand was doing the\nwriting would cease abruptly. There was never any real com-\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 177\npulsion to write, for I was able to stop whenever I wished. More-\nover, I often found a very great difficulty in getting started. Almost\ninvariably the writing took the form of literary composition, and\nessays, verses, etc., were produced. Many of these purported to\nemanate from deceased authors. I need only mention the Oscar\nWilde \" scripts. I consider it in the highest degree probable that\nmanv of the facts contained in these writings could never have been\nnormallv known to me even after allowing for the omnivorous\nquality of my reading. Since December 1928 I have abandoned\nthis strange form of amusement, especially as I became increasingly\nconscious that it was followed by lassitude and nervous irritation.\nI mention it here for the sole purpose of recording that to some\nslight extent at any rate I might be supposed to possess some of\nthe characteristics of an \" agent.\"\nBut in point of fact I may claim to have had a considerable\namount of success with certain mediums, especially with Mrs\nBlanche Cooper and Mrs Leonard. Many readers will be familiar\nwith the case of\n\" John Ferguson \" contained m my report on\nMrs Cooper 1\nThe most rational interpretation of this case is to be\nfound in the hypothesis that the medium had during the sittings\nintermittent access to the subconscious levels of my mind. It is\ntrue that throughout my sittings with Mrs Cooper my right hand\nheld one of the medium's hands ;\nthat is to say, there was contact\nNevertheless it would be a far-fetched explanation to suppose that\ncomplicated messages such as are recorded in my report could have\nbeen communicated to the medium involuntarily by the mere\npressure of fingers and without any pre-arranged code.\nUnconscious whispering on my part seems also a far-fetched\nassumption, and I doubt if the case of \" Gordon Davis could be\nsatisfactorily accounted for without the hypothesis of clairvoyance.\nIn the case of\n\" John Ferguson \" at least some form of telepathy\nfrom the subconscious levels of my own mind to those of Mrs Cooper\nseems the most rational supposition. Whether discarnate human\nbeings played any part in the mechanism of this transfer 1 do not\nknow. Nor do I feel competent to express an opinion on questions\nso vast and difficult. I will merely say that on occasions it certainly\nseemed as if I were an \" agent \" and Mrs Cooper had partial access\nto my memories. But it was hardly ever those thoughts that were\nin clear conscious focus at the moment which were picked up by\nthe medium. T ,\nA\nIn sittings with Mrs Leonard, where there was no contact 1 noted\none or two cases in which telepathy from my mind to that of Mrs\nLeonard seemed on the whole the most probable explanation. One\ni\nSee my \"\nA Report on some communications received through Mrs Blanche\nCooper,\" Proceedings (1925), xxxv. 471-594.\n\f178 S. G. Soal\nsuch instance I have given in my Report on Mrs Cooper (p. 483).\nA name of a village which I had been discussing with Mr Davis in\nthe train on the way to the sitting was given with approximate\naccuracy by Feda half-an-hour later. There was another incident\nof a similar nature given at my second Leonard sitting which would\ntake too long to detail here.\nTurning now to the principal agents in the preliminary (1927-1928)\nseries, these were Mr C. B. Fernald, the dramatist, Mrs Fernald,\nMiss P. Hood, and myself. In a letter dated 18 September 1931,\nMrs Fernald states that in her sittings with Mrs Leonard and Mrs\nWarren Elliott she was definitely given information that was super-\nnormal and beyond chance. A case of apparent precognition\nobtained by Mrs Fernald at a Leonard sitting was published in\nProceedings (xxxvi. 327-32). Mrs Fernald also states that both\nMr Fernald and Miss Hood have had supernormal information given\nthem at sittings with mediums. Mr and Mrs Fernald have practised\na form of automatism in their own home, using a kind of ouija\nboard with pointer and alphabet. At many of these sittings Miss\nHood was present. Mrs Fernald found that with her hand resting\non the slider she was able to cause the pointer to move by herself\nwithout assistance from the others. Mrs Fernald and Miss Hood\nwith their hands on the slider were able to obtain messages. In the\nearlier attempts with the board it was thought that Mr Fernald\nwas the prime agent in causing the pointer to move, but this view\nwas modified when Mrs Fernald and Miss Hood obtained messages\nwithout his assistance. Mrs Fernald does not think that Miss\nHood ever tried to work the pointer alone. I gather that the\ncommunications received through the board purported to be\nmessages from deceased persons who were known to the sitters\nin life.\nThe additional agents. Besides the regular group a certain\nnumber of the 579 percipients were asked to play the part of\ntransmitters each week in the 1928-1929 series of experiments.\nBetween 5 December 1928 and 6 March 1929, between 20 and\n30 such additional agents were employed each week for one ten-\nminute interval. On 20 March and 27 March the numbers of\nthese additional agents were 43 and 68 respectively. As a rule\nthe same 20-30 agents acted for three or four consecutive weeks,\nafter which period a fresh batch of persons were asked to co-operate.\nExceptions arose, however, through people unexpectedly dropping\nout or being unable to take part on account of other engage-\nments. During the whole period 105 persons acted as additional\nagents. Of these 37 claimed to have had psychic experiences\nthrough their own faculties of perception. One or two claimed\nto have had successes in previous telepathic experiments in which\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 179\nthey had acted as agents, but in the vast majority of cases the\nexperiences described were experiences of psychic perception.\nThe object on which these additional agents were asked to con-\ncentrate in their own homes was of course the same as that shown to\nthe principal group at Adelaide Road. In all cases it consisted of\na postcard inscribed with a picture, number, letter or playing card,\nwhich was enclosed in a sealed envelope. Whenever possible this\nenvelope was despatched to reach the agent on the day of the\nexperiment in which it was to be used.\nAccompanying the sealed envelope were instructions to the\neffect that the envelope was to be kept in a safe place unopened\ntill 10 p.m., when it was to be opened in the presence of a witness.\n(For a copy of these instructions see below, p. 289.) The envelope\nbearing the signature of the witness was to be returned to the\nSociety.\nThe choice of the batch of additional agents each week was made\nby Miss Carruthers, subject to certain instructions from me. Our\n579 percipients appeared to belong to very varied cultural types,\nand we had of course absolutely no reason to suppose that any\nindividuals or class of individuals would prove untrustworthy.\nWe knew practically nothing about the occupations, etc., of the\nmajority of the percipients except what had been given us in their\nletters. But broadly speaking, with the very limited information\nat our disposal we were able to recognise two classes : (a) private\nindividuals, and (b) persons known to be in positions of public\ntrust. Class (b) consisted of medical men, clergymen, army officers,\nnaval officers, J.P.'s, university professors and graduates, barristers,\netc. Without intending the slightest reflection on any members\nof class (a) it will be admitted by all that there are no more trust-\nworthy people in the world than our English public men of whom\nclass (b) is a sample. I asked Miss Carruthers to make her first\nselection of agents as far as possible from class (b). But so far as\nour records went class (6) was a small one and comprised only\nsome 30-40 persons at most. Moreover, all the people asked were\nunable to take part on certain evenings. It was therefore found\nnecessary to ask a good many private individuals to assist us by\nacting as agents.\nTo any one individual percipient the vast majority of the re-\nmainder must have been utter strangers, the names and addresses\nof whom he or she could not know. But it not infrequently\nhappened that even in the provinces two or more percipients lived\nwithin a few miles of one another. To avoid therefore any suspicion\nof accidental leakage Miss Carruthers was careful to choose the\nagents from districts in which they were well isolated from other-\npeople taking part in the experiment.\n\f180 S. G. Soal [part\nBut actually there are not the slightest grounds for believing that\nany leakage resulted from the use of these additional agents. The\nobject tables, etc., show no statistical superiority in the experiments\nwhere additional agents were used. Further, there are no cases of\nindividuals producing brilliant successes in such experiments.\nGeneral Scope of the Experiments, 1927-1928\nThe main object of the 1927-1928 experiments was to make a\npreliminary survey of the ground before attempting a statistical\ninvestigation of the subject on a larger scale. The objects of\nexperiment were seldom adapted to statistical computation but\nconsisted largely of picturesque toys, working models, animals,\nflowers. Playing cards, numbers, geometrical drawings, were\nhardly ever used, since the small numbers of percipients (19-62)\nwho took part each evening precluded any serious statistical\nanalysis. It was hoped, moreover, that a greater degree of success\nmight attend the employment of material that was amusing and\nexciting to the agents. Common everyday objects which could\nbe named by a single word, such as cup, plate, fork, were as a rule\navoided, and the objects chosen were for the most part familiar\nobjects in unfamiliar associations that were not likely to be guessed\nby chance. An example is (XXVII, 2 May [C]) when a toy bear\npushed a ball between its forepaws. There was, in fact, nearly\nalways plenty of scope for complex attempts at delineation on the\npart of the percipients.\nThree such objects, referred to as (A), (B) and (C), were as a rule\ngazed at by the agents for ten minutes each, between 8.30 and 9 p.m.\nThe percipients were generally given no indication whatever of\nthe nature of the three objects to be guessed, but they each received\nby post (on the day of the experiment if possible) a copy of the\nfollowing notice.\nWednesday [Date] 1928\nThree different objects will be shown, one each from\n8.30\u20148.40 p.m.\n8.40\u20148.50 p.m.\n8.50\u20149.0 p.m.\nPlease record all impressions.\n(Sgd.) [V. J. Woollby or S. G. Soal].\nOn two occasions, 2 November 1927 and 26 October 1927, the\nwhole half-hour was devoted by the agents to reading aloud an ex-\nciting or gruesome story. On these two occasions, the usual notice\nto percipients was varied to read :\n\" Please record all impressions\nbetween 8.30 and 9 p.m.\"\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 181\nThere were also attempts to transmit the ideas of exciting modern\npoems on 30 November 1927 (C) ; 7 December 1927 (B) ;\n25\nJanuary 1928 (C) ; 14 December 1927 (C).\nTwo attempts, 14 December 1927 (B) ; 7 December 1927 (A),\nwere made to transmit the tingling sensation of a high-frequency-\ncurrent. These seem to have failed entirely.\nTwo attempts to transmit a strong odour, on 21 December 1927\n(C) and 20 June 1928 (B), also failed.'\nIn all these variations of the usual routine, the wording of the\nwarning notice to percipients differed in no way from the usual\nwording when three ordinary objects were the subject of experiment.\nThe objects used in the 1927-1928 experiments were purchased by\nmyself at the most irregular times and in the most diverse parts of\nLondon and Southend. On some occasions the objects were bought\non the afternoon of the day of experiment, in which case they\nremained in a locked attache case which never left my sight till the\nhour of the experiment. But on several other occasions the objects\nwere purchased by me three or four clays previous to the day of the\nexperiment, and after purchase they were carried home in my\nattache case and there kept under lock and key till the following\nWednesday, on which day they were carefully wrapped in paper,\ntied up with string and taken to town in my case. During the\nwhole of the morning these parcels remained in the locked case,\nwhich was left on the staff-room table of East London College. For\nlarge objects a suit-case was used. Once having left East London\nCollege, the attache or suit-case was never out of my observation,\nand the parcels remained unopened till the time of experiment.\nIn selecting the objects for experiment, I sought after variety,\ndistinctness of detail, humorous or striking combinations that mere\nguess-work would seldom hit upon. In this, I certainly succeeded,\nas the list of objects will show. We have now to examine how far\nthe percipients succeeded in divining the ideas I had chosen.\nSummary of Results of Experiments, 1927-1928\nExcept in the case of perhaps half-a-dozen percipients in all,\nthere was no link of acquaintance between the regular groups of\nagents and the 127 guessers living in all parts of the United King-\ndom. The percipients were not even provided with a photograph\nof the agents and could be expected to know nothing at the com-\nmencement of the experiment except that a group of persons, of\nwhom I was one, would try to transmit ideas from a definite place\nat a definite time.\nAt the end of the first twelve weeks' work, a typewritten copy of\na report of the first term's work was sent to each percipient. In this\nreport appeared the initials of the agents for each week, together\nN\n\f182 8. G. Soal [part\nwith a full description of the objects of experiment and the results\nobtained. A second and similar report on the next twelve weeks'\nwork was sent to each percipient shortly after Easter 1928. No\nfurther reports were issued till this paper was read before the Society\nin October 1930.\nThe recording of the results. The letters from percipients which\narrived at 31 Tavistock Square, were opened personally by me every\nFriday afternoon, and the impressions recorded by each percipient\nwere copied on to a large card bearing his or her name, address\nand identification number. On these cards special columns were\nallotted to the recording of the date and, wherever possible, exact\ntime of each impression. As a rule, whenever a percipient scored\nany measure of success, I addressed to him a personal letter asking\nfor further details, without of course, giving him any clue to the\nactual subject chosen by the agents. I also made a point of enquir-\ning whether or not anything had happened during the past day or\ntwo in the percipient's environment to suggest such and such an idea\nto him, or whether he was able to account in any normal way for\ngetting the impression.\nStatistics of Successful Hits, 1927-1928. It has been possible to\nlist all the successful hits in Table I. A few words of explanation\nregarding this table are necessary. In the first column we have the\npercipient's identity number, and where this particular percipient\ntook part in the second series (1928-1929) his new number (always\nbetween 600 and 700) is added thus : 3 = 604, for convenience of\nreference. In the second column is a fraction the numerator of\nwhich gives the number of successful hits and the denominator the\nnumber of weeks' work carried out by the percipient. Thus the\nfraction T\n:\nv means that the percipient recorded impressions for\n18 weeks and scored three successful hits. In the third column is\ngiven the date of the successful hit, and the object A, B or C to which\nit would appear to be relevant.\nThe last column shows the percipient's impression, and where\npossible, the interval A, B, C, in which the impression was recorded.\nThus, if the two letters in the third and fourth columns are the\nsame, A A or B B or C C, this implies that the percipient noted his\nimpression during the same ten minutes as the object to which it\nrelates was exhibited to the agents. C in the third column and B in\nthe fourth column would imply that the successful hit was appa-\nrently of the nature of a \" previsional \" impression, while the order\nA-B indicates a deferred impression.\nThe letter N after an impression means that the percipient was\nable to account in a normal way for the emergence of the impression\nin his mind, while the letters N N indicate that he failed to rind any\nobvious normal explanation.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 183\nTable I is of course to be read in conjunction with the list of\nobjects (1927-1928) to which the corresponding references are\nattached. Percipients who did not score a single successful hit are\nomitted entirely from Table I.\nExcluding for the moment the few percipients of M. Rene War-\ncollier's group who joined the experiment in February 1928, we\nhave 127 percipients in all. Of these : (a) 75 failed to obtain a\nsingle successful hit ; (6) 26 obtained one successful hit only ;\n(c) 20 obtained two successful hits ;\n(d) four obtained three success-\nful hits ;\n(e) two obtained four successful hits.\nOf group (a) 10 had taken part in 12 or more weeks' work ; 43 had\ntaken part in four or more weeks' work, and 32 had taken part in\nless than four weeks' work. Of group (b) three had taken part in\n20 or more weeks' work and eight had taken part in 12 or more\nweeks' work. Only one had taken part in less than four weeks'\nwork. Of group (c) five had taken part in 20 or more weeks' work\nand eight in 12 or more weeks' work. The four percipients in\ngroup (d) had all done 18 or more weeks' work. The two percipients\nin group (e) had done 24 and 30 weeks' work respectively.\nThe quality of the impressions. About the vast majority of these\nimpressions there is seldom anything so detailed as forcibly to\nconvince the reader that the percipient has really \" seen \" the\nobject on which the agents were concentrating. A simple object\nis sometimes named correctly, but the really important details are\nalmost invariably lacking. Perhaps the most interesting case is\nthat of no. 72. He wins only two successes, but he scores these\ntwo hits in only four weeks' work, and both are rather remarkable\ncoincidences. The detailed description of the saucer and pipe\n(23 November 1927 [C]) used for blowing bubbles and the mention\nof the \" Claw-like hands \" on 2 November 1927, if mere guesses,\nare very extraordinary ones. It is unfortunate that this percipient\n(from Barnsley) was unable to continue with the experiments.\nThe impressions of no. 3 = 604 are also rather striking. This\npercipient, who obtained three interesting hits in 18 weeks' work,\ndid not, however, justify his promise in the second year's work, in\nwhich his percentage score was 7T per cent., this being quite an\naverage one.\nCoincidence in time. Among the successful hits given in Table I\nthere are 65 cases in which the coincidence or non-coincidence in\ntime between the exposure of the object to the agents and the\npercipient's guess, is more or less definitely ascertainable\u2014that is,\ncases in which we are able to say with fair certainty whether or not\nthe percipient recorded his impression in the ten minutes A, B or C\nduring which the object was being concentrated on. Of these\n65 cases, there are 33 cases of coincidence {i.e. AA, BB or CO). By\n\f184 8. G. Soal [part\nchance we might expect about ^ x 65 = 22 such coincidences. This\nresult is slightly favourable to the existence of an extra chance\ninfluence, but it is scarcely to be stressed.1\nM. Rcve Warcollier's group. At my invitation, M. Rene War-\ncollier in February 1928 very kindly arranged for his group for the\nstudy of experimental telepathy to take part in the Wednesday\nexperiments, commencing on 15 February 1928. The same weekly\nnotice was sent to M. Warcollier as to the British percipients ;\neight\nmembers of his group acted as percipients in the Wednesday\nexperiments, sometimes meeting at the Institut Metapsychique in\nParis to record their impressions. Unfortunately, with the excep-\ntion of one member, Mme de Z., Wednesday proved to be an\ninconvenient evening for the members of the group, and a special\nexperiment had to be arranged for Saturday afternoons, in place of\nthe Wednesday experiment. I do not propose in this paper to give\nany account of these Saturday experiments. Possibly a separate\nreport may be written on these experiments. In the present report\nI shall confine myself to the few experiments which the members\nwere able to undertake on Wednesday evenings. I shall refer to\nM. Warcollier's percipients only by their initials.\nThese follow, with the number of weeks' work done by them in\nthe session of 1927-1928 shown in brackets : Mile L. (3), Mme C. (2),\nMile T. (1), M. R. W. (4), M. B. (1), M. J. B. (6), M. de S. (4),\nMme de Z. (12). The only remarkable series of successful hits in\nthe Wednesday experiments was obtained by Mme de Z., an auto-\nmatic writer, who in 12 weekly experiments scored five hits, which\nwere fairly interesting (see Table I).\nDuring the second session (1928-1929) the Warcollier percipients\ncontinued with the Saturday afternoon experiments, but were\ngenerally unable to take part in the Wednesday evening work. It\nis, therefore, impossible to make any serious comparison between\nthe results obtained by this group, and those of the English\npercipients.\nCoincidences between percipients' impressions. It frequently\nhappened that two percipients living widely apart recorded similar\nimpressions at approximately the same time, though these impres-\nsions appeared to be in no way related to the object chosen by the\nagents. I give a few of the more interesting examples from the\n1927-1928 experiments.\n(a) 1 February 1928.\nNo. 88 (8.40-8.50) :\n\" A Japanese woman reclining and holding up\nan umbrella.\"\n1\nSee, however, p. 238 below, where the same problem is discussed on a\nlarger scale.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 185\nNo. 89 (8.50) :\n\" Japanese umbrella.\"\n(This is the kind of case which can possibly be disregarded, since\nno. 88 and no. 89 were in the same room.)\n{b) 8 February 1928.\nNo. 45a (Budapest) :\n\" Bunch of beautiful Bed flowers.\"\nNo. 48 (England) :\n\" Bunch of Bed flowers.\"\n(Here the percipients are remotely separated, but the common\nimpression is, after all, a very ordinary one.)\nIn the following instances, the correspondences, though not\nparticularly complex, are much more out of the way.\n(c) 25 January 1928.\nNo. 34 (8.40 p.m., Sevenoaks, Kent) :\n\" Messenger with wand,\nperhaps Hermes.\"\nNo. '92 (8.54 p.m., Basingstoke, Hants.) :\n\" Shoulder of sculpture\nbust, male head.

No. 92 in a\nletter (18 February) said that it was the visual idea of an antique\npiece of sculpture that caused him to get the literary idea of Hermes\nas being most in keeping. He is familiar with many of the antique\ntorsos, having drawn them a lot thirty years ago.\n{d) 15 February 1928.\nNo. 76 (8.53-9.0 p.m., Northwich, Cheshire) :\n\" A gipsy woman.\"\nNo. 65 (8.30 p.m., Birmingham) :\n\" Impression of Gipsy.\"\n(e) 9 May 1928.\nNo. 52 (8.30-8.40 p.m., London, S.E.) :\n\" Impressions connected\nwith being at a great height ;\nprobably on a mountain or in a\nplane.\"\nNo. 71 (8.55 p.m., Coventry) :\n\" Champagne, country field view as\nfrom an aeroplane and sense of great height.\"\nif) 25 April 1928.\nNo. 20 (8.30-8.40 p.m., London, W. 13) :\n\" Thinking of Moses in\nthe burning bush ; perhaps bush fire intended.\"\nNo. 14b (8.30-8.40 p.m., London, W. 8) : \"A burning torch\u2014which\nafterwards changed into something writhing round a stick, perhaps\nremembrance of some Biblical ficture\" [See Exodus, iii, v.]\n(g) 8 February 1928.\nNo. 32 (8.30-8.45, Southsea, Hants.) :\n\" Impression of English\nKings being mentioned, particularly Henry VIII.\"\n\fISC, S.

Walking against a dark background.\"\nA few other similar examples could be cited, but these will suffice.\nIt will be noticed that the coincidence in time is not always even\napproximately exact. If we found the same pairs of percipients\nrecording week after week, impressions of the degree of similitude\nrepresented by say, examples (e), (i), (j), (k), we might reasonably\nconclude that such a pair of percipients were subject to some\ncommon influence (e.g. reading the same weekly story magazine on\nthe day of the experiment) or that they were in some sort of mental\ncommunication, either normal or supernormal. But while we find\nthat two or three pairs of such coincidences occurred almost every\nweek, they did not occur between the same pairs of percipients.\nBut even if the same pair of percipients were found to record similar\nimpressions at about the same time, we should find it almost im-\npossible to prove that the cause of the coincidence was not some\ncommon influence which operated at about the same time on both\npercipients. In a civilised modern community thousands read the\nsame newspapers evening after evening, listen to the same pro-\ngramme on the radio, take in the same magazine, etc. M. Rene\nWarcollier claims to have established the phenomenon of \" mental\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 187\"\ncontagion \" between percipients. In my opinion, he has not suffi-\nciently taken into account the influences of common environment,\ncommon mental habits, and the universal power of suggestion of the\nmodern newspaper and the modern advertisement. In Part II of\nmy report, I shall return to this possibility of \" mental contagion\n\"\namong percipients, treating it from rather a different standpoint.\nThe Dictionary control. Noting the tendency of pairs of perci-\npients to record similar impressions, such as \" sunflower,\" \" cater-\npillar,\" etc., I was curious to try an experiment with the dictionary,\nin which the percipients should be asked to pick out a concrete\nword at random. To this effect, I issued to percipients in February\n1928 the following notice :\nLong-Distance Telepathy\nEach week after you have recorded your usual impressions, will\nyou kindly carry out the following little experiment. Take an\nEnglish Dictionary and, closing your eyes, open it at random,\nstriking the page anywhere with a pencil. Note the name of an\nobject nearest to the word on which your pencil falls. Do this as\nMany Times as the Number of Impressions you have recorded.\nAdd these names at the end of your list of impressions each week,\nnoting them thus :\nControl : Squirrel, river, building, table.\nIgnore abstract names such as \" kindness,\" \" intelligence,\" etc.,\nchoosing each time the nearest concrete object.\nOn no account perform this test until the telepathy experiment is\nfinished, i.e. until after 9 p.m. S. Gr. Soal.\nIt was a fortnight later (29 February) explained to percipients\nthat an impression such as \" white elephant \" would require two\ncontrol words instead of one, as it comprised two distinct ideas.\nA list of the \" control \" words obtained from all the percipients\nwas made each week, and the pairs of percipients who selected the\nsame word or synonymous or closely associated words, were noted\nand the number of such coincidences counted each week. Using\nan Ogilvie and Annandale's English Dictionary it was found that if\nthe dictionary is divided into three equal parts, about 50 per cent, of\nthe words chosen each week were taken from the middle third\n(beginning of E to PO) of the book, while the remaining 50 per cent,\nwere about equally divided between the other two-thirds of the\ndictionary. As the number of concrete names in any ordinary\ndictionary must considerably exceed the number of concrete words\nused in ordinary life by the average person, one might expect that\nchance coincidences between pairs of percipients during the actual\ntelepathy experiment would be far more frequent than the coinci-\ndences obtained by means of the dictionary.\n\f188 S. G. Soal [part\nIt was found as a matter of fact, that the coincidences due to the\ndictionary were usually far in excess of those noted during the\nactual experiment, but it must be remembered that the two experi-\nments are not precisely comparable. Two percipients giving the\nword \" white \" in the dictionary control, would register a coinci-\ndence, whereas, in the actual experiment two percipients who\nobtained the respective impressions \" white sea \" and \" white\npaper \" could hardly be considered to score a coincidence. The\nDictionary Control, therefore, is clearly of very limited application,\nbut the following examples will show that simple \" single word\n\"\ncoincidences such as \" gypsy,\" \" sunflower,\" occur quite as fre-\nquently in the case of the dictionary as in the actual experiment.\n29 February 1928.

On one occasion (22\nFebruary, Expt. XIX) a curious \" double \" success was scored by\nthe dictionary. We recall that on this particular evening, the\nobjects of experiment were (A) Artificial Dragon Fly, (B) Toy Snake,\nand (C) Firework Lights in the darkness. There were 42 per-\ncipients, including seven of M. Warcollier's group, and the total\nnumber of control words was 170.\nThe results of the \" Control \" were : (A) No word applicable ;\n(B) Adder (M. J. B.) ;\n(B) Serpent (M. de S.) ;\n(C) Lights (M. de S.).\nThe two words \"Serpent\" and \"Lights\" followed each other in\norder. On this evening, the dictionary more than equalled the joint\nefforts of the 42 percipients, there being only one snake mentioned\naltogether (cp. Table I : 30=189, 65 = 601, 76 = 666).\nImpressions relating to the environment of the agents, but not to the\nactual objects of experiment. It very occasionally happened that a\npercipient recorded an impression which, though not appbcable to\nthe subject of experiment, was yet related to something which\noccurred in the seance-room during the experiments. As I have\nexplained in the Introduction to this paper, little importance can\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 189\nbe attached to such incidents, unless the coincidence shows an\nalmost photographic accuracy of detail.\nThe following is the best incident of this kind, but I am not\nconvinced by it. On 2 November 1927, percipient no. 20, noted\n(no exact time), \" Something being lighted that would give a bad\nsmell. A dazzling light. A bad smell again ;\nperhaps an explosion.\nA hissing or gas-escaping sound.\" Mrs Fernald, one of the agents,\nwrote the following note two days after the experiment :\n\" Between\n7 and 8 p.m. J. H. F. [i.e. Mrs Fernald] twice let the gas escape\nwhile making coffee. The second time the tap was turned on for\nseveral minutes before the gas was discovered to be unlighted, and\nfilling the room. We all exclaimed, '\nthere might have been an\nexplosion.'\n\"\nDuring the same evening (2 November 1927) percipient no. 87\nrecords, \" A bunch of violets\u2014a bowl of water.\" Mrs Fernald\nagain adds the following note :\n\" Miss Hood had put a bunch of\nviolets in water in the bowl of the wash-hand stand, where they\nremained from 7-9 p.m. The wash-hand stand was just outside the\ndoor of the room in which we were sitting for the experiment.\"\nI can corroborate seeing the bunch of violets, which struck me as a\nfine bunch.\nCase of apparent anticipation of the experimenter's intentions. The\nfollowing curious coincidence is worthy of note.\nOn 5 October 1927, the first evening of the experiments, a toy\nrabbit was shown to the agents during the third interval (8.50-\n9.0 p.m.). On Tuesday, 4 October, I had bought some concentrated\nsulphuric acid and potassium chlorate from the chemist in Prittle-\nwell, Essex. My intention was to make preparations for a little\nchemical experiment to startle the agents during the last ten\nminutes of the half-hour. On the morning of 5 October, I carried\nto town in my attache case, a small bottle of sulphuric acid, a glass\nrod and a packet containing a mixture of sugar and potassium\nchlorate. I was intending to make a small white pyramid of this\nmixture and to place it on a tray in the seance-room. While the\nagents were watching, I would suddenly let fall a single drop of\nthe concentrated acid on to the mixture from the end of the glass\nrod. There would have been a spluttering, crackling conflagration,\nrising almost to the ceiling, and acrid fumes of chlorine peroxide\nwould fill the room as well as smoke. About midday on the day\nof the experiment, 5 October, however, I decided that the smoke\nmight damage the ceiling, and that the project must be abandoned.\nI therefore purchased the toy rabbit, which ultimately formed the\nsubject of experiment in the third interval.\nNo. 28 noted on 5 October (8.50-9.0 p.m.) :\n\" Something crackling\nor spluttering as water dropped on to acid. Irritating fumes. Idea\n\fL90 S. G. Soal [part\nof Ammonia.\" In a letter dated 27 November no. 28 wrote :\n\" I\ncan safely say that I had been engaged in no experiments of a\nchemical nature for at least four years\u2014that is, since I left school.\nAs it happens I have absolutely nothing to do with chemistry either\nin my daily occupation or in my hobby\u2014wireless. . . . The\nimpression was the most sudden and unexpected of any I have as\nyet received. I can distinctly remember it occurring. Nothing\nwas further from my thoughts at the commencement of the test.\"\nNo. 28 continued with the experiments for eleven weeks, but ob-\ntained only one other success. He did not take part in the 1928-\n1929 series.\nList of Objects used in the Experiment, 1927-1928 1\nI. 5 October 1927 ; 58 percipients took part ;\nagents : Mr and\nMrs Fernald, Miss P. Hood and S. G. S.\nA. 8-30-8.40 p.m. : The agents looked at a large quantity of the\nscarlet berries and foliage of the wild guelder rose {Viburnum opulus).\nSee Table I, no. 19.\nB. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A bright horseshoe. See Table I, nos.\n65 = 661, 76 = 666.\nC. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A large toy rabbit with long ears, brilliant\nscarlet back and white woolly breast. See Table I, nos. 13, 23,\n71 = 664.\nII. 12 October 1927 ; 62 percipients ;\nagents : same as in I.\nA notice had been sent to the percipients to the effect that for all\nthree objects the agents would attempt to transmit the name of a\ntown or village.\nA. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : Attempt to transmit the name Hornchurch,\na village in Essex. I produced a tasselled horn and blew blasts on\nit, and then drew a church on a sheet of paper.2\nSee Table I,\nno. 26 = 165.\nB. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : Attempt to transmit the word Dartmouth.\nI used a small feather dart like a little arrow and sketched a mouth.\nSee Table I, no. 54.\nC. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I showed in rapid succession the names\n1\nExcept when stated otherwise experiments I-XXII were conducted from\n31 Tavistock Square, XXIII-XXXVI from 2 Adelaide Road.\n2\nAlthough no percipient obtained an impression of a horn on 12 October\nwhen the word Hornchurch was visualised, it is curious that on the following\nweek, 19 October (control) three percipients out of the total 57 obtained\nimpressions of a horn. These impressions are as follows : no. 65 (8.30), \" A\nhorn and sounds and sights of hunting \" ; no. 61 (8.54), \" A small horn . . .\nwith fancy cord \" ; no. 50 (8.50), \" A voice kept saying . . . Home or\nHaurne.\" None of the three were able to account normally for their im-\npressions.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception I'M\nRamsgate, Brackenbury, Bath, Saltash, Maidstone, Barmouth,\nBarrow, Thornbury, Manningtree, Hatfield, each, name being\nwritten on a strip of cardboard. Each name was exposed to view\nfor about fifteen seconds and the agents were asked to visualise the\nobjects suggested by the names but to make no attempt to hold the\nnames in their minds longer than the fifteen seconds. See Table I,\nno. 52 = 650.\nIII. 19 October 1927 (control experiment) ; 57 percipients.\nThis was the only control experiment in the present series. The\nusual notice had been sent out to the percipients. The agents,\nhowever, did not meet, but I was present at an S.P.R. Conversazione\non this evening held at 31 Tavistock Square. At 9.30 p.m. I asked\nMiss Ina Jephson in the presence of Miss Newton to think of three\nobjects and to label them A, B, C. The three objects chosen were :\n(A) An open book, (B) A globe of the world, (C) A red lacquered\nBox.\nFifty-seven percipients sent in records of their impressions. If\nwe apply the percipients' impressions to the three objects suggested\nby Miss Jephson we have to note the following partial successes :\n(A) No. 79 (8.50-9.0 p.m.) :\n\" An open book.\" Five other\npercipients mentioned books of various kinds.\n(B) No. 53 (8.40) saw \" a small globe, greeny blue, on ring or\nstand.\" No. 92 also mentioned a globe.\n(C) No. 83 (No time) saw \" a black and gold lacquered box.\"\nEight other percipients mentioned or described boxes of various\nkinds, but unlacquered.\nAt 9.28 a.m. on the following morning Mr F. T. Cooper of East\nLondon College in the presence of Mr W. F. S. Churchill and myself\nat my request suggested three objects.\nHe thought of in order : (A) A waste-paper basket, drawing\nspecial attention to the wickerwork, (B) A red triangle (as a red\nmotor sign), (C) A motor lamp.\nApplying this control to the percipient's impressions obtained\non the previous evening we may note the following successes :\n(A) No. 28 (8.30 p.m.) :\n\" A needlework basket. Could smell the\nwickerwork.\"\n(B) No. 45 (8.40-8.50) :\n\" Triangle.\"\n(C) Nil.\nI have recorded this experiment but it is of no real importance.\nProbably a sounder procedure would be to choose the three\n\" control \" objects at random from a dictionary. This was actually\ndone two days later at the S.P.R. rooms. Miss Newton and I took\nan English dictionary and closing our eyes chose a word by opening\nthe dictionary at random and striking a page with a pencil. The\n\f192 S. G. Soal [part\nnearest concrete word to the spot struck by the pencil point was\nchosen. This was repeated three times by Miss Newton and myself\ntaking turns with the pencil. The three words chosen were\n(A) Glove, (B) Lizard, (C) Barometer. Applied to the percipients'\nimpressions for 19 October there would be no success with these\nthree objects. Applied to the results sent in on 9 November there\nwould have been one success, since no. 5 records (8.40-8.50) \" Lizard\nor similar reptile.\"\nIV. 26 October 1927 ; 51 percipients ;\nagents : Mrs F., Miss H.,\nMr B., S. G. S.\nThe following notice had previously been sent to each percipient\n\" Please record all impressions between 8.30 and 9.0 p.m.\"\n8.30-9.4 p.m. : Mr B. read aloud a story by Wilkie Collins entitled\n\" A terribly strange Bed.\" It is a story of a young man who\nnarrowly escapes death from suffocation by a mattress which,\nworked by a press in the room above, descends from the ceiling on\nto his bed. The scene is a Paris gaming house. The thrilling\nmoments of the story were reached between 8.50 and 8.55 p.m. See\nTable I, nos. 3 = 604, 9, 10 = 610, 40 = 634, 53 = 652, 55.\nV. 2 November 1927 ; 46 percipients ;\nagents : Mr and Mrs F.,\nMiss H., Mr 0., S.

Wells's \" The strange Story of\nMr Evesham.\" This is a rather weird story in which a decrepit old\nman gains possession of the body of a young man and transfers his\nown memories to it. On p. 37 occur the words, \" Gripping my hand\nwith his long bony claw that was disengaged.\" 1\nOn p. 40, \" I\ngripped his shrivelled claw.\" See Table I, nos. 7 = 607, 13, 50, 72,\n92 = 686.\nVI. 9 November 1927 ; 46 percipients.\nAs two of the agents had stated on 2 November that they would\nbe prevented from coming to Tavistock Square on 9 November, I\nsuggested that all should remain at home and think of the Moon and\nits associations in literature, between 8.30 and 9.0 p.m. During\nthis time on 9 November, I was in a train and called to mind various\nquotations from Chesterton, Wilde, Lindsay Vachell, J. C. Squire,\nand others, in which the Moon was the object of simile. See\nTable I, no. 9.\n2\n1\nSee Table I, percipient no. 72, 2 November 1927.\n2\nThis percipient wrote :\n\" The first and firmest impression was that the\nagents were either transmitting from their own homes [true, see above], or\nvery indifferent or not up to the usual standard of concentration.

With two small trumpet-shaped\ntubes of white wood I blew large soap bubbles from 8.50-9.15 p.m.,\nletting the bubbles sink gently to the floor and bounce on the carpet.\nThe company remarked on the beautiful iridescence of the bubbles\nand also on the reflections of the electric lights in them. See\nTable I, nos. 72, 87 = 676.\nminutes I was unable to gather any definite impression at all. I felt that the\nobject of concentration was no common or material object. If I gathered\nrightly it was something stupendous, subtle, vast in extent. Perhaps an invisible\nelement. Something astronomical, universal, international or a phase of\nhistory. I was led step by step to Rome or Greece, the object being something\npertaining to Art and Literature\u2014too difficult or subtle for me to express.\"\n1\nThis is one of the very rare cases (almost the only one in the 1927-1928\nseries) in which a percipient obtains impressions which apply to two of the\nthree objects shown to the agents.\n2\nCuriously enough, a fortnight later, on 7 December, no. 23 (a medical man)\nrecords, \" . ! . toys including a jumping frog.\" No. 23 was unable to account\nnormally for the impression, but suggested that about a month ago (his letter\nis dated 21 December) he might have seen a jumping frog in one of Gamage's\nChristmas catalogues.

The icosahedron, it will be remembered, is a regular\nsolid figure, each of whose 20 faces is an equilateral triangle. It\nhas 12 corners, the space at each corner being filled up with the\nangles of five equilateral triangles whose bases form a regular\npentagon. There are 12 such pentagons, and I pointed out these\n12 pentagons and 20 equilateral triangles as the predominant geo-\nmetrical figures associated with the icosahedron.

S.\nA. 8.26-8.40 p.m. : The lights were switched off, and at Miss N.'s\nsuggestion we told creepy stories in turn. Miss X. began by\nimagining banshees and their wailings outside, trying to get in at\nthe window. I described an imaginary experience of being shut up\nall night in a tiger's cage. I also described imaginary experiences of\nbeing lost in the catacombs. Col. H. described dreams of being\npursued through passages by enemies. See Table I, nos. 5 = 605,\n50, 53a, 92 = 686.\nB, C. 8.40-9.0 p.m. : The agents watched Miss Xewton make\ncoffee in an apparatus like a glass retort, surmounted by a receptacle\nthat contained the coffee.

We remarked that the eagle was the symbol of the West.\nWe also mentioned the Roman eagle and the eagle in the heavens as\nwell as the Austrian and German eagles. Allusion was made to the\nexploits of the eagle as a bird of prey. See Table I, no. 30 = 189.\nC. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I showed a postcard of two tortoises (Zoo\nseries) with their necks protruding from their shells. The fable of\nthe hare and tortoise was mentioned and remarks were made on the\nlong lives of tortoises and on the tortoise as a useful garden pet.\nNo success.\nXVIII. 15 February 1928; 34 percipients; and in addition 5\nmembers of M. Warcollier's group ;\nagents : Mrs M. and S. G. S.\nOn this date the improved dictionary control first came into\noperation.\nA. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I showed a small \" weather bird \" whose body\nwas made out of a fir cone. It was painted a slatey blue and had a\nwhitish breast, black yellow-rimmed eyes and a small red top-knot.\nThe two feet, which stood very close together were large and webbed.\nSee Table I, M. J. B.\nB. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A small toy sign-post painted white and\nstanding on a patch of green sward. Its two arms bore the direc-\ntions Norwich to Yarmouth, and Norwich to Ipswich. We men-\ntioned the \" open road \" and George Borrow's feats as a pedestrian.\nNo success.\nC. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A toy acrobat who performed on a wire\ntrapeze, describing somersaults and swinging his legs and body in\nthe most realistic manner. The model was provided with a piece of\nelastic, which, when twisted up and released, provided the energy of\nmotion. Some time before the experiment and earlier in the\nevening, I broke the elastic by winding it up too tight, and had to\nprocure a fresh strip. See Table I, nos. 50, 52 = 650, 53 = 652.2\n1\nIn a letter (14 February 1928) no. 24 writes, \" The hand I saw was rather\nsmall and delicately made and this made me think it might be a woman's\nhand.\" These additional details somewhat diminish the value of the coin-\ncidence. No. 55a wrote (17 February), \" I felt the waiting was for some\nkind of race or competition.\" This information again diminishes the value\nof the coincidence. We may note that on three succeeding weeks, 7, 14, 21\nMarch, there are solitary references to a moving hand.\n2\nIt is interesting to note that in the following week, 22 February, M. J. B.\n(Paris) notes, \" A semicircle of metal turning very quickly, which appears as\na sphere on account of its rapid movement. An impression of dancing in the\nair, lifting in turn my left leg and my right leg.\" On the same evening Mile L.\n(Paris) records, \" Looping the loop.\" Both the impressions of M. J.

S.\nA. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : An artificial dragon fly poised on outspread\nwings on a copper wire above a bunch of imitation green leaves.\nWe noted the brilliant rainbow colours and veins on the wings and\nalso the long slender iridescent body. I mentioned that the dragon\nfly was first a caddis worm, living in a house of sticks. No success.\nB. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A toy snake made from pieces of wood jointed\ntogether with a tape running through them. The snake was painted\ngreen and black and yellow, and could be made to wriggle in a\nrealistic manner by holding its tail and working its joints. It had\na red open mouth, no fangs, and small white glass eyes. Sensations\nof horror were induced in one or two of the ladies present by the\nlife-like movements of the snake. See Table I, nos. 30 = 189, 65 = 661.\nC. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I switched off the lights and applied a match\nto some firework sticks which, held in the hand, emitted showers of\nsilver stars and sparks.

The play began at 8.45 p.m.\nand as soon as the curtain was up, a well-dressed man crept down\nsome stairs into the common room of an inn, where a rough-looking\nman stood in his shirt-sleeves. The first man closed with the\nruffian and knocked him down with a candlestick, but the fallen\nman whipped out a pistol and fired on the first man, who fell appa-\nrently dead. Another man entered the room from the door leading\nto the stairs and with the assistance of the assassin, carried away the\nshot man's body through the door. It turned out later that the\nman shot was a retired Scotland Yard official who was engaged in\ntracking a gang of criminals. I left the theatre at 9.15 p.m., but\nthe other agents remained. The shot was fired at 8.46 p.m. See\nTable I, nos. 4, 48a = 647. 1\n1\nThe impression of 48a is an interesting revelation of the way in which a\npseudo-success may result through the agents choosing a subject which\nhappens to coincide with a mental hobby of some particular percipient. We\nfind that no. 48a has a penchant for impressions relating to crime. Thus\n14 March, \" Munsden Mystery quickly solved in an unusual manner \"\n;\n28 March, \" Scotland Yard official overcoming an attack by a lunatic \"\n2 May, \" Attempt to burn down a large public building.

See Table I, no. 50.1\nC. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I exhibited a small toy man with a clown's face.\nWhen wound up, the figure drew his bow across the strings of a large\nfiddle or 'cello, producing a phrase of six or seven notes. At each\nmotion of the bow across the fiddle, the man jerked out his tongue\nand drew it in again. No success.2\n1\nWe must note that no. 50 obtained impressions of odours on ten other\noccasions and that none of these impressions had any relation to any odour\narising in the seemce-roorn. Moreover on the one other occasion (21 December\n1927) when the odour of camphor was the object of experiment, no. 50 failed\nto get any impression of odour. The percipient did not take part on 20 June\n(Ammonia).\n2\nAlthough no success was obtained with this object on this date a remark-\nable success was obtained in a Saturday experiment with the same object by\nM. R. Warcollier. I quote this success because although strictly outside the\nscope of the present report it is perhaps the most curious success in the whole\nof the experiments. The object described in C above was the subject of an\nexperiment with the Warcollier group on 10 March 1928, 3.30-3.40 p.m. Full\ndetails of the object were posted to Miss Newton immediately after the con-\nclusion of the concentration from my own home, the sole agent being myself,\nthough other members of the family were present. There were only two\npercipients. M. Warcollier (Paris) records 3.30-3.40 p.m., 10 March :\n\" Face\nwith mobile grinning features, winking eyes, mouth open, putting out its\ntongue from moment to moment.

The pipe was\ncertainly \" held like a pen \" and my head was constantly being turned to the\nright in order to disengage the bubble. The soap solution used, however, was\nin a white basin and not a coloured saucer. The impression of the percipient\nclearly preceded the actual experiment by several minutes. I had, however,\nrehearsed the performance at 7.30 in the evening when alone in the Tavistock\nSquare sea\/ice-room with locked doors (the room has no windows).

Years ago I taught elementary mathematics.\" It will be seen\n(p. 196, above) that the icosahedron shown was of golden glass. This per-\ncipient continued in the 1928-1929 series, but achieved no outstanding success,\nhis score being 18\/440=4-1 per cent.\n2\nThis percipient actually obtained the greatest number of successes (5)\nin the 1927-1928 series. Moreover it should be noted that whereas Mme de Z.\ndid only 12 weeks' work the two English percipients who secured four successes\neach did 24 and 30 weeks respectively. Mme de Z. recorded an average of\n2-6 visualisations per 10-minute interval, which is not at all exceptionally\nhigh.\n\fPART II\nSTATISTICAL EXPERIMENTS 1928-1929\nBy the end of July 1928 it became clear to me that little definite\nprogress was to be made on the preceding lines of experiment.\nWhile there was a small residuum of material that was suggestive\nof supernormality, the coincidences obtained were not sufficiently\nstriking or detailed to compel belief in the operation of a supernormal\nfaculty. One of the most disappointing features of the work was\nthe failure of the percipients to repeat their successes with any\ndegree of frequency or regularity.\nI determined, therefore, to work each week with a much larger\nnumber of percipients than had been hitherto possible and to use\nmaterial that would be adapted to statistical computation. To this\nend I approached the Council, and it was arranged that Prof. Julian\nHuxley should, on 19 September 1928, give a talk on the wireless,\nbased on some notes furnished by me. Prof. Huxley gave some\naccount of the results of the 1927-1928 experiments and asked for\nvolunteers who would be willing to devote half an hour each Wednes-\nday evening for at least four months. He appealed specially to all\nwho had had personal experience of telepathy or clairvoyance and\nto those who possessed the faculty of automatic writing or planchette\nwriting, and he invited them to communicate with the Society and\nrelate their experiences. Any blind people willing to co-operate\nwere also asked to write.\nAs a result of this appeal by Prof. Huxley, upwards of 600 letters\nwere received from interested persons ; 470 of the writers actually\ntook part in the new series of experiments. In addition 55 of the\n1927-1928 percipients (including five psychics) continued with the\nsecond series. During the succeeding six months the total number\nof percipients was increased by the addition of friends, etc., to 579\n(including six further psychics). No such body of percipients has\never in the history of psychical research taken part in experiments\nextending over such a prolonged period as six months, and the best\nthanks of the Society is due to all these persons who gave of their\ntime and service so willingly.\nGeographical distribution of the percipients. The 579 percipients\nwere distributed as follows : 143 lived in the London Postal Area ;\n66 in the Home Counties of Kent, Essex, Surrey, Herts., and\n211\n\f212 S. G. Soal [part\nMiddlesex ; 305 in the remainder of England ; 21 in Wales ; 22 in\nScotland ; 15 in Ireland ; two in the Channel Islands ; and one each\nin India, New Zealand, Holland, France (not in M. Warcollier's\ngroup) and California.\nAnalysis of letters from prospective percipients. Of the 470\nletters received from persons who afterwards took part in the\nexperiment, 353 of the writers claimed to have had psychic ex-\nperiences 1\nof one kind or another, through the exercise of their own\nsupposed supernormal faculties. The remaining 117 letters make\nno mention of personal experiences or faculties and of these 117\nthere are 30 that definitely disclaim the possession of any super-\nnormal experiences or psychic powers.\nOf the 364 psychics 59 stated that at one period or other of their\nlives they had been able to produce automatic writing or to obtain\nmessages by means of a planchette or ouija or by \" glass and\nletters \" (19 of these 59 automatists apparently used some form of\nautomatic writing to divine the obj ects shown in the present experi-\nment) ; 138 of them claimed to have had successful experiences in\ntelepathy of either the spontaneous or experimental variety, some\nacting as agents and others as percipients ; 53 claimed to have\nhad premonitions of future events or premonitory dreams which\nwere realised ; four claimed to have seen visions in a crystal ; two\nclaimed to be dowsers ; one claimed the power of making her astral\nform visible at a distance ; four claimed to be influenced by \" spirit\n\"\ncontrols and to be spirit mediums ; 16 of the 470 percipients were\ntotally blind and two others nearly blind, and of these blind per-\ncipients six claimed to have had psychic experiences.\nIt is noteworthy that none of the well-known professional mediums\ncould be induced to take part in the experiment. I personally\nwrote to four of these who were known to me. Two urged lack of\ntime, one of them stating that \" her form of telepathy was telepathy\nfrom the spirit world and that she could not hope to succeed with\nmine.\" The two other mediums did not answer my letters.\nTo some extent the above psychic classes overlap. That is to say,\ncertain of the telepathic class were also automatic writers, and so on.\nMany of the experiences related by the 364 psychics were ex-\ntremely curious, and while there is no reason for doubting the\nauthenticity of the majority of them, I am convinced that none of\nthem would repay a close investigation with a view to publication.\nAdequate records of strange happenings seem seldom to have\nbeen made at the time of their occurrence, and corroborative evi-\ndence of any value would have been extremely difficult to obtain.\n1\nMany of these experiences would appear to have been very slight. The\nmost interesting are to be found in the groups of \" telepatkists \" and \" auto-\nmatists.\"\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 213\nThe following extracts from letters written by percipients show\na considerable variety in the reasons they give for believing them-\nselves to have telepathic powers :\n\" During my army service when I have been asleep on guard I\ncould always rely on being awakened by a voice calling my name\nwhenever any officer or N.C.O. was visiting my post.\"\n\" I find people can't lie to me. I read their thoughts and they\nbungle the lie.\"\n\" Sir, having proved telepathy to be positive in a small room\nand having found that my dog can read my thoughts I would be\nfavoured, etc.\"\n\" Astrologically I should be sensitive to any such experiments.\nI was born with the sun posited in the fourth house under the sign\nPisces ;\nScorpio was in the ascendant ; the moon was posited in\nthe 9th house under the sign Cancer.\"\n\" Between my husband and me there was an intense communica-\ntion without words. During the last months of his life I was\nafraid to think when near him.\"\n\" I possess some psychic powers and a pair of eyes that flash fire\nwhen they please.\"\n\" I never dream silly dreams or have nightmares but I dream\nwhole histories at long intervals.\"\nGeneral instructions to percipients. It was found necessary to\nchange the time of the weekly transmission to suit the majority\nof the percipients. The half-hour was now fixed for Wednesday\nevening 10.0 p.m. -10. 30 p.m., and it was arranged that the sittings\nshould be regularly held at 2 Adelaide Road, the home of Prof, and\nMrs Mackenzie. Except for the necessary changes affecting time\nand place and a suggestion with regard to the use of a photograph\nof the agents, the General Instructions sent out to prospective\npercipients were practically identical with the 1927-1928 instruc-\ntions (see p. 171, above).\nThe agents. The agents who regularly carried out the transmission\nfrom 2 Adelaide Road, N.W., were Prof, and Mrs Mackenzie, Mr\nOdell and S. G. S. Each intending percipient was supplied with\na copy of a photograph of the agents taken at a studio in Camden\nTown. (Owing to the poorness of the lighting facilities at Adelaide\nRoad, it was found impracticable to secure a good photograph of\nthe group standing in the actual room where the meetings were to\nbe held.) The percipients were instructed to look at this photograph\nfor a few minutes before 10.0 p.m., and then to lay it aside. Mrs\nHughes appears in the group, as it was hoped that she would have\nbeen able to assist at the meetings, but unhappily a serious illness\nintervened and Mrs Hughes was unable to attend a single sitting.\np\n\f214 S. G. Soal\nThe percipients were left unenlightened on the absence of Mrs\nHughes, and it is a curious fact that among their impressions there\nare more statements referring to Mrs Hughes than to any other\nagent of the group.\nThe recording of results. Owing to the large number of percipients\nwho sent in their impressions each week it was impossible for me\nto open all the letters personally or to undertake the large amount\nof clerical work involved in copying the contents of the letters\non to the record cards, the preparation of notices, and the answer-\ning of correspondence. Miss Helen Carruthers, a member of the\nSociety, was therefore engaged to do this work, and I should like\nto pay here a tribute to the efficiency and business-like manner in\nwhich she carried out her considerable task. Not only did Miss\nCarruthers copy every letter on to its appropriate card, supervise\nthe sending out of notices, address letters of enquiry to large\nnumbers of individuals, but she also made a tolerably complete and\ndetailed classification of the impressions of the percipients relating\nto the 27 material objects shown to the agents. This was an\nextensive and most useful piece of work by which the percipients'\nguesses were exhaustively grouped under numerous heads each\nweek.\nThe general method of procedure was as follows. By Friday\nmorning of each week the great bulk of the postcards and letters\nhad reached the S.P.R. office. A large card bearing his identity\nnumber, name and address, was allotted to each of the 579 per-\ncipients. Miss Carruthers opened each letter and copied the\ncontents on to the appropriate card, inserting the date and the\ntimes of each impression. A separate record was kept of the\n\" Control Words.\" I spent the afternoons of Thursday, Friday\nand Wednesday reading through the cards and classifying on\nseparate cards the percipients' impressions under suitable headings,\nthis classification having reference not only to the objects of experi-\nment of the current week but also to those of all the preceding\nweeks. After the completion of the experiment in April 1929\nmany weeks were spent by Miss Carruthers in making independent\ndetailed lists connected with each object of experiment. In the\nyear 1929-1930 the whole of the 579 record cards and supplementary\ncards were gone through personally by myself and entirely new\nlists compiled which were compared with and checked by the\noriginal lists made by Miss Carruthers. These supplemented and\ncorrected lists were used as a basis for the construction of the Object\nTable XXXIII. Very considerable labour and hundreds of hours\nhave been expended on these Tables alone, and it is hoped and\nbelieved that they are now practically free from error. 1\n1\nTable XXXIII is printed at the end of the report (pp. 303-349, below).\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 215\nGeneral scheme of experiments. The general plan of the experi-\nments is set out in the chart in which are given the numbers of\npercipients and of additional agents, and a brief description of\neach object shown to the agents. A more detailed description of\neach evening's meeting is contained in the lists at pp. 280-302, below.\nIn these lists are to be found also the exact forms of the notices sent\nout each week to the percipients and to the additional agents.\nIt will be seen from the chart that the experiments may be\nclassified as follows :\nA. Twenty-seven attempts to transmit impressions of material\nobjects. In two of these, 7 November (i) and 28 November (i), the\nmain design was to attempt to convey impressions of the colours\nRed and Yellow respectively.\nB. Six attempts to convey impressions of simple geometrical\nfigures, together with five control experiments designed to provide\na statistical standard of comparison. In the five control experi-\nments no actual attempt was made to transmit any geometrical\nfigure, but the percipients received the same notice as in the six\nbona fide attempts at transmission. This notice invariably read :\n\" The third object will be a geometrical sketch. Please draw your\nimpressions.\"\nC. Eight attempts to convey impressions of a three figure number,\ntogether with six control experiments serving as statistical standards\nof comparison. In each of these 14 experiments the following notice\nwas issued to percipients :\n\" The [first, etc.] object will be a number\nof three figures. Please record only your strongest impression.\"\nD. Four attempts to convey impressions of a capital letter of\nthe alphabet, together with five control experiments.

The object, playing card, geometrical\nsketch, number, etc., was placed in a position in which it could be\nclearly seen by all the agents. If a working model it was set in\nmotion. As a rule, silence was observed during the 10 minutes\nof transmission but, when remarks were made bearing on the object\nlooked at, their gist was carefully noted by me. While one object\nwas being shown the other objects remained in my attache case or\nsuit-case till the time came for using them. Each object was\nreplaced in the attache case as soon as the period of transmission\nwas over.\nIn certain experiments, e.g. 12 December (i) alligator, the object\nwas exposed to the agents for one minute only and was then removed\nand the agents were asked to forget about it entirely for the remain-\ning nine minutes. The object of this was to test the theory that\ntelepathic transmission of ideas takes place only when they have\nceased to occupy the field of consciousness of the agent but are still\nactive in his subconscious mind.\nIn cases when additional agents were employed a similar method\nwas sometimes used (e.g. on 16 January, when 23 additional agents\nconcentrated on the number 555 between 10.0 and 10.5 p.m.,\nwhereas the percipients did not begin to \" listen in \" for a three\nfigure number till 10.10 p.m.).\nGroup A. The twenty-seven material objects\nMaterial objects such as toys, pictures, flowers, etc., when used\nas subjects for telepathic experiments are less amenable to statistical\ntreatment than, say, numbers or letters of the alphabet. Certain\nexperimenters, however, including Warcollier, affirm that when a\nperson is asked to guess a number or a playing card that person is\napt to conjure up a mental image of his lucky number or favourite\nsuit, and that this conscious activity inhibits the emergency of\ngenuine telepathic impressions. According to Warcollier the best\nresults are obtained when the percipient is given no hint of the\nnature of the impression he is expected to receive. Bearing in\n\f220 S. G. Soal [part\nmind these objections of Warcollier, I judged it wise not to eliminate\nentirely the \" free \" type of material from my experiments. At\nleast one experiment, therefore, was as a rule arranged each week,\nin which the listeners-in were given no inkling of what the agents\nintended to transmit. In such cases the percipients were advised,\ne.fj. :\n\" 10.0-10.10 p.m., please record all impressions.\"\nThe selection of the objects. The first six objects (10, 17 October)\nwere purchased on 4 October at three different London shops. They\nwere wrapped up and carried home and then put under lock and key.\nOn the evening of the 9th the six objects were labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nThree dice were thrown together and the three objects corresponding\nto the numbers thrown were used in the experiment of the 10th,\nthe numbers chosen for the intervals i, ii, iii, being in ascending\norder of magnitude. As explained in my description of the 1927-\n1928 experiments the three objects selected were wrapped in paper\nsealed up and carried to town in my attache case, which was locked\nand left in the staff room of East London College during the morning.\nAfter 1.30 p.m. the case was continuously under my observation\ntill the time of the experiment.\nA similar procedure was adopted with most of the remaining\nobjects, which were purchased in batches of four or six. An\nexception is the purchase of the postcards for 5 and 12 December\nand 23 January. These were usually purchased in the week\npreceding that in which they were required. They were handed\nby me to Miss Carruthers, who kept them under lock and key till\nthe time arrived to post them to the \" additional \" agents. A\nsimilar exception occurred in the case of the \" Skull and Bird\n\"\nreprints, which were obtained by Miss Carruthers from Robert\nMacLehose and Co., Ltd., Glasgow, the Society's printers.\nNot all the objects were purchased in London. The Calendar,\nfor instance, of 13 February (iii) was bought by me in Kingston-on-\nThames. In short, the locality was varied as much as possible as\nwell as the day and hour of purchase.\nExplanations of Table XXXIII.1\nThe principle on which these\n\" Object \" Tables are devised is as follows. Each of the 27 objects\nhas a Table devoted to it. The object is analysed into its essential\ncomponents and any obvious associations with it are noted. Guesses\nof different degrees of approximation to the object are also given a\nplace in the Table. It will be seen by reference to any of the\nTables that each approximation or associated idea or partial com-\nponent has three lines devoted to it, and that at the end of the\n1\nThe enumeration of the items connected with each of the twenty- seven\nobjects given in Table XXXIII differs somewhat from that given in Appen-\ndix III for the Individual Scoring system. In the latter the analysis is\ngenerally carried to greater detail. It is believed, however, that the classifica-\ntion in Table XXXIII is quite sufficient for all practical purposes.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 221\nsecond and third lines are the words Peev.( = Previsional) and Post\nrespectively.\nNow all objects employed in the experiments were shown to the\nagents in either the first, second, or third ten minutes of the half-\nhour. An object shown in interval (i) {i.e. 10.0-10.10 p.m.) will be\ncalled a \" first place \" object, one shown in interval (ii) (i.e. 10.10-\n10.20 p.m.) a \" second place \" object, and so on. The chief aim\nof the Tables is to compare the number of impressions of a particular\ntype obtained during the ten minutes of the evening on which a\ncertain object was exhibited with numbers of the same type obtained\nduring the ten minutes intervals of other evenings when a quite\ndifferent object was being shown. To illustrate the procedure\nadopted we may take Table XXXIII, 19 December (ii). Here the\nobject shown (a dog, etc.) was a \" second place \" object. While\nthe agents were looking at the postcard of the \" dog and pipe\n\"\nfrom 10.10-10.20 p.m. on this date, there was one impression of a\ndog recorded by percipients between 10.10 and 10.20 p.m. This\none is therefore recorded under 19 December in the first or principal\nline of the first item (\" Mention of any hind of dog \"). But there\nwas also one impression recorded between 10.0 and 10.10 p.m., and\nthis is recorded in the second or \" previsional \" line. One dog\nalso was recorded between 10.20 and 10.30 p.m., and this is noted in\nthe third or \" post \" line.\nNow on the evenings of 21, 28 November, 5, 12 December, 9, 16,\n23, 30 January, 13, 20 March, one object only was shown, and this\nobject was a \" first place \" object. Hence to form as wide a basis\nof comparison as possible the numbers of dogs recorded on these\nevenings are brought into the principal or first line even though the\nimpressions were all noted in interval (i), i.e. 10.0-10.10 p.m.\nOn 10, 17 October, there were three objects shown. On each\nof these dates the first or principal line gives the numbers of dogs\nrecorded in interval (ii) (10.10-10.20). Those in interval (i) occur\nin the previsional or second line, and those impressions of dogs\nrecorded in interval (iii) (10.20-10.30 p.m.) are to be found in the\n\" Post \" or third line. On 13 February there was only one object,\nand this was a \" third place \" object. Hence for comparison, the\nnumber of dogs obtained between 10.20 and 10.30 is brought into\nthe first or principal place.\nAgain on 7, 14 November, 24, 31 October respectively, two objects\nonly were shown, these being first place and second place objects.\nOn each of these dates, therefore, it is the number of dogs recorded\nin interval (ii) (10.10-10.20 p.m.) which is put in the principal or\nfirst place, while the numbers recorded in the first interval (10.0-\n10.10 p.m.) are to be found in the previsional or second line. On\nthese dates there are no impressions of dogs in the third or \" Post\n\"\n\f222 8. G. Soal [part\nline since the third interval was devoted to a geometrical or number\nor capital letter test.\nTable XXXIII, 13 February (iii), illustrates the case of a \" third\nplace object.\" On dates when there were first and second place\nobjects but no third place objects, the number of impressions\nobtained while the \" second place object \" was being shown are\nbrought up into the principal or first line, while those obtained\nwhile the first place object was being shown occupy the \" pro-\nvisional \" or second line. On 10, 17 October, when there is a third\nplace object the numbers of impressions occurring in the third\ninterval (10.20-10.30) are recorded in the first or principal line. In\nthis case the numbers which occur in the first and second intervals\nare added together and the sum is placed in the second or \" pre-\nvisional \" line. On 10, 17 October there will be no impressions in\nthe \" post \" line.\nOn dates like 9, 16 January, etc., where only one object (a \" first\nplace \" object) is shown, the impressions recorded in the first interval\n(10.0-10.10 p.m.) are brought up into the principal line, while the\n\" post \" and previsional lines will be empty.1\nWe have then these facts to bear in mind in studying these Tables.\nIn all Tables where the object of experiment is a \" first place\n\"\nobject all the \" previsional \" or second lines will be empty, while\non 10, 17 October, and on these dates only, the numbers occupying\nthe third or \" post place \" will represent the numbers of impressions\nobtained in the twenty minutes (10.10-10.30) instead of in the usual\nten minutes. These twenty minute intervals are distinguished in\nthe Tables by being printed in heavy type. On dates like 7 Novem-\nber, where a first and second place object were shown the impressions\nrecorded in interval (i) will of course occupy the principal line.\nIn all Tables where the object shown is a \" third place \" object,\nthe third or post lines will be empty on all dates while on 10, 17 Octo-\nber and these dates only the number in the second or \" previsional\n\"\nline will represent numbers of impression obtained in the first\ntwenty minutes instead of in the usual ten minutes. These twenty\nminute intervals are distinguished in the Tables by being printed\nin heavy type.\nIt will be noted that the dates 6, 20, 27 February, 6, 27 March,\nare omitted from the Tables. On these evenings no material object\nwas exhibited.\nDeductions from Table XXXIII. Making where necessary a\nslight allowance for the variations in the weekly numbers of perci-\n1\nOccasionally solitary impressions occur in a line or position that should\nnormally be empty. These stray impressions arise through a percipient\nrecording a successful impression relating to a material object in a geometrical\nor number test.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 223\npients it will be apparent from an inspection of these Tables that\nvery rarely indeed is there a superiority in the numbers of impres-\nsions for the different items on the evening on which a certain\nobject was exhibited over the other evenings when the object was\nnot shown. There is perhaps only one notable exception. On\n10 October (i) there appears to be a definite superiority in the\nnumbers of flowers and even of red flowers. This is the only really\nmarked case that could be construed as being favourable to the\nsupernormal. There are also very slight superiorities on 17 Octo-\nber (i) (Explosion of Bomb), and on 21 November (i) (Wheels and\nRotation). Perhaps also on 13 February (iii) (Dogs) there is a very\nslight superiority, and on 13 March (i) (Ducks).\nSo far as can be judged from these Tables the introduction of the\n25 or so additional agents seems to have produced no perceptible\neffect upon the number of successes.\nThe special experiments, 19 December (i), 9 January (i), 16\nJanuary (i), in which the percipients were asked to imagine the\nobject concealed under a black cloth, and also the similar experiment\n13 March (i) with the attache case, were for the purpose of testing\na theory of M. Rene Warcollier. According to this investigator\nwhen a number of persons fix their minds on the same or similar\nobjects they may be put into telepathic communication among\nthemselves. It was hoped that to provide the percipients with a\ncommon starting point for their thoughts might either conduce to\nsuccessful guessing of the object beneath the cloth, etc., or failing\nthis cause a considerable number of percipients to think of similar\nobjects or even of the same three figure numbers in the succeeding\nintervals (ii) or (iii), that is produce \" mental contagion \" among\nthe listeners-in of a supernormal and not merely suggestive variety.\nNeither of these hopes has been realised. The chief effect of\nusing the black cloth on 19 December was to produce, obviously by\ncontrast, an exceptional crop of impressions of white objects such\nas eggs, skulls, ivory models of famous buildings, white statuary\nand also be it noted of canaries and bird-cages. These effects were\nnot so marked on 9 January, when the black cloth was used for the\nsecond time, but they were still appreciable.\nIf the reader will turn to the \" number coincidence \" Table\n(Table XXIV) he will see that there was no sudden increase on\n9 and 16 January in experiment (ii) in the three figure numbers\nwhich were guessed two or more times. Thus we find that the\nonly kind of \" mental contagion \" noted on these occasions was\nthat of simple ideas naturally associated with a black cloth.\nIn a similar way the focussing of attention on the attache case\n(13 March (i) )\nappears to have caused an unusual number of\npercipients to think of books, parcels and articles of toilet or dress.\n\f224 S. G. Soal [part\nSpecial experiment on 19 December 1928. I am greatly indebted\nto M. Rene Warcollier for arranging a novel experiment on 19\nDecember. On that evening M. Pascal Forthuny was giving a\npublic demonstration of clairvoyance to an audience of 300 people\nin Paris. Shortly before 10 p.m. M. Warcollier read aloud the\nweekly instructions to percipients for 19 December, and explained\nthat experiments (i) and (hi) only would be attempted. The\naudience wrote their impressions on scraps of paper and signed\nthem. I received, however, from M. J. Buraud only 58 papers ;\napparently the remainder of the audience had not thought it worth\nwhile to hand in their impressions.\nOnly experiment (i) need concern us since it happened that (iii)\nwas a geometrical \" control.\" The object shown in (i) was the\norgan-grinder and monkey revealed by raising the black cloth.\nThe impressions sent in by the 58 Paris percipients were for the\nmost part names of common objects such as \" bird-cage,\" \" violin,\"\n\"teaspoon,\" \"book,\" \"crystal ball,\" \"skull,\" \"bottle,\" etc.\nThe experiment was a complete failure. The impression of M.\nPascal Forthuny, one of the percipients, read \" Objet metallique\npointu d'un bout. Brilliant.\" 1\nInfluence of seasons, etc. As might be expected the numbers in\nTable XXXIII are to some extent subject to seasonal and occa-\nsional influence. Thus Table XXXIII, 28 November (i), we note\nthat the popularity of chrysanthemums is greatest in October and\nNovember, but tends to diminish after Christmas, while during\nFebruary and March the impressions of yellow flowers increase\nowing to the blooming of the jonquils and daffodils. In the same\nway there is a little cluster of \" poppy \" impressions (Table XXXIII,\n10 October (i) between 7 and 21 November) due doubtless to the\nproximity of Armistice Day.\nSuggested use of Table XXXIII. It is hoped that these Tables\nwill be useful in future telepathic experiments, since from them\nmay be derived the approximate probabilities that the average\nperson will guess by chance a large variety of objects if he remains\npassive for about ten minutes and records about 1-85 distinct\nimpressions, 2\nthis being about the average number of separate\nimpressions recorded by each percipient during the ten minutes in\nwhich an object was concentrated upon.\nLet us take for instance 19 December (i) (dog in cap with pipe).\nThe total records of all the percipients in the 27 object experiments\nare equivalent to 8784 ten minute intervals. The total number of\n1\nThe organ-grinder was certainly made of metal, but the description is too\nvague to have any value.\n2\nFor a discussion and investigation of the \" average number of impressions\n\"\nin the ten minute interval please see Appendix IV of this paper.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 225\ndogs guessed during the 27 experiments is 111. Hence the chance\nthat a single average percipient under these circumstances should\nguess a dog of any kind is about sVVtj *- e- about 1 in 79. Simi-\nlarly the chance of guessing a cap, hat, turban or helmet is\n= 1 in 75 about. Hence the chance of an average percipient\nmentioning both a dog and some sort of head-covering in the same\nten minutes is about ^T x TV= 5-9V\"s-\nActually we find on referring to Table XXXIII, 19 December (i),\nItem 2, that one percipient (no. 451, 20 March (i)) recorded the\nimpression \" Postcard of bull dog with sailor cap on head and\nUnion Jack on back.\" As there are 8784 distinct ten minute trials\nthe mention of dog and head-covering might be expected to occur\nat least once.1\nHere, of course, they are not only mentioned\nseparately but associated.\nThe individual scoring system. By the use of Table XXXIII, as\nexplained in the last section, it would be possible to construct for\neach object an approximate scoring scheme by allocating to each\nsuccessful guess a score of - log p where p = the probability of an\nindividual percipient guessing the item correctly in the ten minute\ninterval.\nI have not, however, carried out this plan for the reason that I\nhad scored the whole of the individual percipients' records on an\narbitrary scoring system before Table XXXIII was completed,\nand re-scoring would involve very great labour. This arbitrary\nscheme, of which full details are given at page 280 below, is carefully\ngraded and serves well enough to compare the achievements of\none group of percipients with that of another. Sixty marks are\nallotted for each evening's work, i.e. twenty marks for each experi-\nment (i), (ii), and (iii) in which an object, three figure number,\ncapital letter, etc., was actually shown to the agents. Hence\nomitting the control experiments which were not scored, the\ngreatest possible score any one percipient could obtain would be\n1020. To get this score the percipient would have had to do 23\nweeks' work and never to have acted as an additional agent. The\npercentage score of a percipient is obtained by multiplying 100 by\nthe ratio of his actual score to his possible score, which latter\nrepresents the full marks the percipient could have obtained on\nthe actual experiments in which he took part, those in which he\nacted as an additional agent not being scored. As the scoring\nsystem is not constructed on any strict statistical principles the\ndistribution of scores among the percipients is not precisely a\nnormal distribution. Moreover, the present system cannot be\n1\nIn the above argument a simplified view is taken of the question as it is\nassumed that the guessing of a dog and of a hat are mutually independent\nevents.

Soal [part\nused to determine whether any particular percipient's achievement\nis due to chance or not ; but it does serve to compare the joint\nachievement of one large group with that of another.\nDistribution of the experiments among the 579 percipients. One\nto four weeks' work was done by 172 percipients, five to nine\nweeks' by 100, 10-14 weeks' by 91, 15-19 weeks' by 109, 20 weeks'\nby 28, 21 weeks' by 22, 22 weeks' by 32, and the full number of\n23 weeks' work was done by 25 percipients.\nComparison of Different Groups\nIn the following analysis I have thought it worth while to consider\nonly the 374 percipients whose possible scores equal or exceed 300,\nwhich is roughly the equivalent of five weeks' work. The object\nof this restriction is to allow each percipient time to \" settle down \"\nto his average or normal performance.\nThe distribution of these 374 actual percentage scores is not\nprecisely a normal distribution. Nor had we any reason to expect\na quite normal distribution on so arbitrary a system of scoring.\nIf we take as the score of a percipient the percentage ratio of his\nactual numerical marks to his total possible marks, we find that the\nmean score of a percipient is 6-48. The mode of the distribution\nis 5-50 and the standard deviation is 3-07. Employing the notation\ngiven in D. Caradog Jones's A First Course of Statistics (1927),\np. 205, we find for our distribution : -225 ;\n\/i\n2\n= 2-95 ; K = - -230.\n(For a normal distribution \/3, should be about three, which is nearly\ncorrect, but should be about zero.) Perfect normality is, there-\nfore, destroyed by a certain skewness which can be calculated in\nterms of \/3X\nand \/?2\nfrom Mr Jones's formula (16, p. 205). This\nskewness works out to be -32 and equals [Mean - Mode] -f- Standard\nDeviation. From this result we deduce the value 5-50 for the\nmode,1\nwhich agrees fairly with that found from the Graph.\nWe find that 65 per cent, of the scores lie within the range\nMean \u00b1Standard Deviation, i.e. between 3-41 and 9-55, and 95 per\ncent, lie within the range Mean \u00b12 x Standard Deviation, i.e.\nbetween 0-34 and 12-62. These results would agree pretty closely\nwith those expected from a normal distribution.\nWe may consider that the number of observations (374) is suffi-\ncient to determine the type of distribution within the limits,\nMean \u00b12 x Standard Deviation but insufficient to give trustworthy\ninformation outside those limits. For the actual tabulation of the\ndistribution see Table II and the graphs.\nIn order to investigate whether or not any sub-sample of the\n1\nBy the mode is meant the most fashionable or jwpular score. In a normal\ndistribution the mode would be identical with the mean or average.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 227\n374 percipients is abnormal when compared with the whole we may-\nmake use of a formula given in Biometrilca, v. 182, and the data of\nthe distribution given above are consistent with the use of this\nformula (see A. L. Bowley, Elements of Statistics).\nThe formula is as follows : If a distribution is known only by a\nsample n, the mean being x and the standard deviation s, and if\nfor a sub-sample nv the mean is xv and the standard deviation sa ,\nthen the standard deviation of the difference x^x1\ndenoted by a is\ngiven by the result\na\n_s1\n2\ns2\n-2sx\n2\nn^x-Xy)2\nnx\nn n{n-n^)\nThe last term will usually be so small that it can be neglected. In\nour case\nn=374, a>=6-48, * = 3-07.\nnx\nmay be taken, for example, to be the number of percipients\nwho were automatic writers or the number of premonitionists as\nthe case may be.\nWe are now in a position to compare the performances of the\ndifferent sub-groups of percipients.\nPsychics v. Remainder. Of the 364 persons who mentioned\nhaving had psychic experiences there were 160 with possible scores\n5:300. The mean score x1\nof this group was found to be 6-45 with\na standard deviation Sj = 3-00. Hence ftj = 160, a;\n1\n=6-45, sx\n= 3-00,\ncc = 6-48, s = 3-07, and using the above formulae we find a=-18.\n-j ,- oo cc-% *03 1\nHence - \u2014> = \u2014= - .\na -18 6\nOn the whole, therefore, the average performance of the \" psy-\nchics \" is neither better nor worse in any significant sense than that\nof the whole group of 374 percipients.\nAutomatists v. Remainder. There were 46 automatists (plan-\nchette or automatic writers) with possible scores 5=300. The mean\nscore of this group was 5-90 with a standard deviation sx\n= 2-66.\nHence with \u00ab1\n= 46, ^= 5-90, s1\n=2-66, x = 6-48, s =3-07, we find\nx \u2014 x -58\ncr=-37. Hence 1=\u2014=1-6. Again the deviation is without\nsignificance.\nTelepathists v. Remainder. There were 99 percipients who claimed\nto have had experiences in telepathy and whose possible scores were\n5; 300. For this group the mean 3^ = 6-53, the standard deviation\ns1\n= 2-96. Hence with w1\n= 99, n = 374, cc = 6-48, we find a=-26.\nHence \u2014 =\u2014= - (nearly). Hence result is without significance. 1\na -26 5\n1\nFor significance the ratio \u2014 1 should exceed 2 at least.\n\f228 S. G. Soal [part\nPremonitionists v. Remainder. There were 43 percipients with\npossible scores 5=300 who claimed to have had previsions or pre-\nmonitory dreams. For this group the mean 0^ = 6-50. The\nstandard deviation .^ = 3-03. Hence we find o= 43. Hence\nfjQ rg>\n*0-^\n- = -T7, = ^ (nearly). Hence result is without significance.\nor 43 21\nv &\nEffect, of practice. Of the 55 percipients who took part in the\n1927-1928 experiments and carried on with the new series, only\n33 did enough work to obtain possible scores of 5=300. For this\ngroup the mean score x1\n=6-59. The standard deviation s1\n=3-01.\nHence with w, = 33 we find a=-50. Hence \u2014\u2014= =- (approx.).\na -50 5 rr\nHence result is without significance, and practice appears to have\nhad no influence on success.\nThe blind percipients. Of the 18 blind percipients only nine had\npossible scores 5:300. For this group the mean score 0^ = 6-89,\ns1\n=l-72. Hence cr= -58. Hence \u2014\u2014?= \u2014= ? (nearly). Hence\nresult is without significance.\na\nMen v. Women. Of the 374 persons with possible scores 5=300,\n156 were men and 218 women. For the men the mean score\n2^ = 6-36. Standard deviation 6^ = 2-97. Hence with n1\n=156 we\nfind o = -18. Hence\nX\u2014X\n\u00b1 = ~= ^.\na 48 3\nFor the 218 women the mean score a:\nx\n= 6-56. The standard\ndeviation sx\n=344. Hence with ^= 218 we find cr=43. Hence\nx - x -08 8\n\u2014 tt, = \u2022 Hence neither the men nor the women have anv\na 43 13\nsignificant superiority over the general average.\nEffect of distance. We may ask : Have the London percipients\nscored a higher degree of success than the average ? We have :\nNumber of people residing in the London Postal District with\npossible scores 5=300 was 93. The mean score of this group was\n^= 6-69. Standard deviation s1\n= 3-25. Hence with Wj_=93 we\nfind a = -28. Hence \u2014 = \u2014= - . Hence result is without signi-\nficance.\na -28 4\nThe close approximation of the means of all these sub-groups to\nthe mean of the whole is an argument against the existence of any\nsupernormal perception in the mass.

On an evening such as 10 October on which more\nthan one material object was looked at, in cases where a percipient\nrecorded a successful impression in the same ten minute period as\nthat in which the relevant object was shown, the impression to be\nscored was selected from this interval. If, however, the percipient\nnoted a successful guess in a ten minute interval other than that in\nwhich the corresponding object was shown dice were first thrown\nto decide from which interval an impression was to be chosen for\nscoring. A percipient, therefore, who gave a right guess in the\nwrong ten minute interval had a certain chance of gaining marks\nfor his guess but not such a good chance as one who recorded his\nimpression in the correct interval. Such restrictions as these were\nnecessary in order to put all the percipients on a common basis as\nfar as possible.\nDistribution of successful contemporaneous hits on the 27 objects\nby the 579 percipients\nBy a \" contemporaneous \" successful hit is meant any correct\nimpression of an object recorded in the same ten minutes during\nwhich the agents looked at the object. It must be mentioned,\nhowever, that in what follows the successful guess was allowed\nto count even when the percipient had recorded more than one\ndistinct visualisation in the same ten minutes. That is to say, there\nwas no selection by dice.\n(a) Four percipients obtained five successful contemporaneous\nhits each. These were nos. 118, 255, 338 and 421. Their total\npossible scores were 1020, 920, 860 and 960 respectively. Their\naverage 1\nnumbers of visualisations or sensations recorded per ten\nminute interval were 3-19, 3-04, 2-42, 1-48. Their percentage mean\nscores were 11-2%, 13-5%, 15-2% and 11-5% respectively.\n(b) Two percipients (8 and 557) obtained four successful con-\ntemporaneous hits each. Their total possible scores were 1020 and\n1\nThis average per ten minute interval for the whole of the 579 percipients\nis 1-85. The averages for groups (c) and (d) were 2-81 and 2-18 respectively.\n\f232 S. G. Soal [part\n720 respectively, and their average numbers of visualisations or\nsensations recorded per ten minute interval were 2-52 and 3-44\nrespectively. Their percentage mean scores were 10-6% and\n13 - 10\n\/o- .\n'\n(c) Thirteen percipients obtained three successful contempo-\nraneous hits each. The average possible score of this group was\n884, and the mean percentage score of the group was 9-1%.\n(d) Thirty-nine percipients obtained two successful contempo-\nraneous hits. The average possible score of these was 741. The\nmean percentage score of this group was 8-3%.\nA successful hit, of course, may be a very slight success indeed,\nand may therefore receive only a low mark. It by no means\nfollows that the percipients with the most successful hits with the\n27 objects obtained the highest percentage scores. Moreover, a\nhigh percentage score on the whole series may be the result of\nexceptional success with the statistical material (i.e. numbers,\nplaying cards, etc.) rather than with the objects.\nExamplesfrom (a) and (6).

While a careful study of\nTables XXXIII gives no indication of any constantly operating\nfaculty of supernormal perception among the mass of the percipients,\nit must be freely admitted that the accuracy of certain isolated\nimpressions, or in some cases small groups of impressions, baffle all\nanalysis. If certain of the successes described in the preceding\nsections are due to telepathy, we can only conclude that this faculty\nis so occasional, so sporadic in its operation, as to be indiscoverable\nby statistical analysis.\n1\nIt is an instructive illustration of the scope of chance to compare this\nimpression with one obtained by no. 317 on 23 January (i), which reads :\n\" Burning paper. Girl with cigarette. Air balloon. Flash of light.\"\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 237\nSpecial experiment on 6 March. Between 10.0 and 10.10 on\n6 March 1929 a special attempt was made by the agents to transmit\nthe idea of the first verse of Blake's poem \" The Tiger \" :\n\" Tiger, tiger burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night,\nWhat immortal hand or eye\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry ?\n\"\nA sealed envelope was sent to 23 additional agents, containing a\nwhite card on which the above verse was written in red ink. The\nnotice sent out to the 230 percipients who took part was as follows :\n\" 10.0 p.m. Think over and write out a verse of poetry of not more\nthan 5 lines and record all impressions.\" The 23 additional\nagents were requested to break the seal at 10.0 p.m. on 6 March\nand to concentrate on the contents from 10.0-10.5 p.m. Concentra-\ntion was to cease at 10.5 p.m. The agents at 2 Adelaide Road\nchanted the poem together from 10.0-10.10 p.m. There was men-\ntion of the ferocity of tigers and of poking the tiger at the Zoo with\nan umbrella.\nAs a result none of the 230 percipients quoted any verse from the\npoem in question, and no percipient mentioned a tiger. A few\npercipients quoted poems in which \" night \" was mentioned, but\nthere were no close approximations to the idea of a fire in the\ndarkness. Perhaps the percipient who got nearest to the \" spirit\n\"\nof the poem was no. 232, who is cited in connection with the 27\nobjects (p. 235, above). His verse ran :\n\" God of the granite and the rose,\nSoul of the sparrow and the bee,\nThy mighty tide of being flows\nThrough all thy creatures back to thee.\"\nWe may note a few poems quoted by percipients in order of\npopularity. Undoubtedly the most popular poem was Longfellow's\n\" Psalm of Life,\" from which no less than seven persons quoted a\nverse :\n\" Tell me not in mournful numbers . .\n.\" nos. 152 (Letch-\nworth) and 380 (Palmer's Green) ;\n\" Life is real, life is earnest . .\n.\"\nnos. 321 (Basingstoke) and 472 (Dudley) ;\n\" Lives of great men all\nremind us,\" nos. 454 (Ireland) and 486 (Herefordshire) ;\n\" Let us\nthen be up and doing,\" no. 249 (Oxford).\nNext there were six quotations from Gray's \" Elegy,\" four\nquotations from Wordsworth's \" Intimations of Immortality\"\u2014these\nbeing mostly the lines beginning \" Our birth is but a sleep and a\nforgetting,\" three from the \" Ancient Mariner,\" etc. Two per-\ncipients (163 and 628) cited the not very well known verse from\nFitzgerald's \" Omar \" :\n\" Lo ! some we loved, the loveliest and the\nbest . .\n.\"\n\f8. G. Soal [part\nCoincidence in time for the \" object \" impressions. Taking the\ndates 10, 17, 24, 31 October, 7, 14 November, and 19 December,\non each, of which more than one concrete object was shown, we\nfind from the Object Tables XXXIII that there were altogether\n501 distinct successful hits. Care has been taken to count each\nsuccessful hit only once, as some hits are enumerated in the tables\nunder more than one heading. On evenings like 10 October,\nwhere three objects were shown, we might expect by chance that\nthe successful hits would be about equally distributed among the\nthree intervals of ten minutes, so that if on such an evening there\nwere x successful hits in all, the expected number for each interval\nwould be xjZ. Similarly, on an evening like 7 November, on which\ntwo concrete objects only were exhibited, the chance expectation\nfor each of the two ten minute intervals would be y\/2 where y is the\ntotal of successful hits on this evening.\nWe are thus able to calculate what number of the 501 successful\nhits would on a chance basis happen to be guessed in the same\nten minute interval as that in which the corresponding object was\nshown to the agents. This chance expectation of hits which are\nneither \" post \" nor \" previsional \" is found to be 209-2. The\nactual number of such hits is 210. Thus the agreement is unexpec-\ntedly close and furnishes us with one more argument in favour of\nthe view that the successful hits have no special relation to the\nparticular time interval in which the corresponding objects were\nshown. (The details of the counts have been preserved and can be\nseen by anyone wishing to verify them.)\nB. Geometrical Figures\nThe figures the agents attempted to transmit in the six geo-\nmetrical experiments are shown in Table VIII (Analysis of geo-\nmetrical transmission experiments). The notice sent out to\npercipients is given on p. 215, above. When a percipient drew\nmore than one distinct drawing, the first in order from left to right\nor from top to bottom was chosen for the purpose of scoring and\nof classification. 1\nThe number of geometrical impressions sent in\nwas as a rule considerably less than the weekly total of percipients,\nsince a certain number of percipients seemed to shirk this type of\nexperiment. No additional agents were used in any of the geo-\nmetrical tests. The figure chosen for transmission each week was\ndeliberately selected by myself and drawn by me in the presence of\nthe other agents.\n1\nWhen, however, a percipient underlined one of two drawings as being a\nstronger impression than the other, the stronger impression was chosen.\nWhere a percipient made more than two distinct drawings his impressions were\nignored.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 239\nClassification of the drawings. The sketches were divided into\ntwo main classes : (a) \" straight line \" figures,, and (b) curved figures.\nThe class (a) comprised triangles, pyramids, prisms, quadrilaterals,\npolygons and all other figures formed entirely or almost entirely of\nstraight lines. Class (b) comprised complete circles, ovals, arcs\nof circles, spheres, cones, cylinders, crescents and other figures\ncomposed almost entirely or entirely of curved lines. In the case\nof a \"mixed\" drawing, in which straight lines and curves equally\npredominate, one-half was counted to belong to class (a) and one-half\nto class (b). Drawings of this type are, for example, a triangle in-\nscribed in a circle, a circle (not excessively minute) inscribed in a tri-\nangle, a sector of a circle or a quadrilateral or polygon inscribed in a\ncircle (or vice versa), a segment of a circle, a bounded semicircle, and\nso on.\nThese two classes (a) and (b) were then sub-divided into smaller\nclasses such as quadrilaterals, complete circles, triangles and\npyramids, ovals, sectors, polygons, cones, cylinders, curved im-\npressions unclassified, linear impressions not classified, and so on.1\nIn Tables VII and VIII we are concerned with only three of these\nsub-classes, viz. : (i) triangles and pyramids, (ii) complete circles,\n(iii) pentagons and higher polygons such as hexagons, octagons, etc.\nClass (ii) includes single circles, concentric circles, two or more\nintersecting or non-intersecting complete circles, but excludes\nsectors, semicircles, etc. Class (i) includes single triangles, tetra-\nhedrons, a pair of triangles base to base or vertex to vertex, Maltese\ncrosses formed of four triangles, and also figures formed by a pair\nof distinct interlacing triangles or of one triangle inscribed in another.\nDO O\nPyramids with a square or polygonal base counted for only one-half\nin the triangular class and one-half in the quadrilateral or polygon\nclass. Drawings of a triangle inscribed in a circle counted for one-\nhalf in the triangular class and one-half in the complete circle class.\nA similar partition was used in the case of a polygon inscribed in a\ncircle or a circle inscribed in a polygon.\nTable VII gives the numbers of impressions in each class under\nthe appropriate headings in each of the five \" control \" experiments,\nwhere no drawing was looked at by the agents. From the totals\nthe average frequency for each class is found. Thus the frequency\nfor the\n1;\ntriangular \" class (i) is found by dividing the total number\n(259-5) of triangles and pyramids by the total number (1161) of dis-\ntinct drawings. The result is 259-5 '1161 = -224, and so on for the\nremaining classes (Table VII). These frequencies are then used to\ncalculate the expected numbers of each class in the other six geo-\nmetrical tests. The standard deviations are also calculated on the\n1\nThe actual tables of classification for each week may be inspected at the\nS.P.R. Rooms.\n\f240 S. G. Soal [part\nassumption of a binomial distribution. In Table VIII these\nexpected numbers are compared with the corresponding \" actual\nnumbers.\nIt will be seen that with one single exception (28 November,\ncomplete circles and triangular classes) the actual deviations are\nall numerically less than twice the corresponding standard devia-\ntions. The deviation on 28 November just exceeds 2 x S.D. in\nthe complete circle class, but since this deviation is negative it pro-\nvides no evidence for supernormal perception. It appears, in fact,\nthat the frequencies found from the control experiments apply\nextremely well to the results of the remaining experiments, and there\nis no evidence that when the agents have thought of a triangle, for\ninstance, the numbers in the triangular class show any significant\nincrease.\nTable IX gives the numbers of times which the actual drawings\nshown in the six experiments were guessed on each date. Here\nagain there is no evidence that the agents have augmented these\nnumbers on certain weeks by their concentration.\nTable VII\nAnalysis of Geometrical Control Experiments\nDate.\nNumber of\nTriangular\nDrawings\nand\nPyramids.\nNumber of\nComplete\nCircles.\nNumber of\nPentagons\nand\nHigher\nPolygons.\nTotal\nNumber of\nStraight\nLine\nImpressions.\nTotal\nNumber of\nDistinct\nDrawings.\n7 Nov. 60-5 47-5 20-0 167-5 261\n12 Dec. 38-0 37-5 12-0 128-5 212\n19 Dec. 50-0 55-0 10-0 135-0 238\n9 Jan. 60-5 40-5 13-0 147-0 243\n6 Feb. 50-5 35-5 11-0 138-0 207\nTotals 259-5 216-0 66-0 716-0 1161\nFrequen-\ncies \u2022224 168 \u20220568 \u2022617\n[These frequencies are used to calculate the expected values for the\nsame classes of drawings in Table VIII.]\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception\nTable VIII\nAnalysis of Geometrical Transmission Experiments\nDate.

The Three Figure Number Experiments\nThere were eight attempts to transmit a three figure number and\nsix control experiments. The notices sent out to percipients on each\noccasion are to be found on p. 215, above.\nOn three occasions, viz. 9 January (ii), 16 January (ii) and\n30 January (ii), between 20 and 30 additional agents were employed\nto assist in the transmission.\nThe instructions sent to these agents is to be found on pp. 293-4,\n296 below. It will be seen by a reference to the chart that on 9\nJanuary and 16 January the additional agents had finished their\nconcentration before the percipients began to record their impressions\nof three figure numbers. This was arranged to test the \" sub-\nconscious \" or \" latent \" transmission theory.\nThe selection of the numbers. On 21 November and 9 and 23\nJanuary the numbers were chosen by myself in private by drawing\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 243\nfrom a bag a piece of cardboard on which was inscribed one of the nine\ndigits. The digits were replaced in the bag together with another\npiece of cardboard bearing the figure 0, and the operation of\ndrawing was repeated twice. The three figure number was thus\nconstructed.\nFor the five remaining experiments I decided to employ numbers\nin which all three digits were the same, and subject to this restriction\nand the further restriction that no such number should be used\ntwice on different dates, the method of selection was by drawing\nfrom a bag. The number was usually selected some days before\nthe date of the experiment in which it was required, and was drawn\nby me in black or blue crayon on several postcards, one of which\n! was handed to each agent. In cases where the percipient made an\nextra guess,1\nthe first in order of recording was chosen for the\npurposes of scoring and analysis except when the percipient had\nunderlined one impression as being stronger than the other, in\nwhich case the impression underlined was chosen.\nExplanation of Tables X to XIII. Table X gives the individual\npercipients who guessed the number correctly and also those who\nguessed the first two digits correctly. It will be seen that even\nwith the \" popular \" numbers 555, 777, etc. the amount of success\nis negligible. Moreover, no individual percipient guessed more\nthan a single one of the eight numbers correctly.\nTable X\nIndividual Eesults of Number Tests\nDate.

If the numbers in heavy type\nin this table are compared with the other numbers in the same\ncolumn it will be obvious that there is absolutely no significant\nsuperiority whatever in any case.\nTable XII investigates the amount of general success obtained\nwith the numbers consisting of three repeated digits. Here again\nif the numbers in heavy type are compared with those in the same\ncolumn as the one in heavy type it will he seen that there is obviously\nno superiority whatever on any occasion.\nTable XIII deals with those single digits specially stressed by\npercipients. It often happened that a percipient guessed a three\n1\nIn all the tables, by the total number of guesses each week is meant the\nnumber of complete three figure numbers, one of course being recorded for each\npercipient.

In other cases\na percipient would say, \"I see the figure 5 very strongly,\" or \" I\nsee hosts of 8's,\" etc. Table XIII has been constructed to discover\nif there is any correlation between these \" specially strong \" digital\nimpressions and the numbers shown to the agents. On 21 and 28\nNovember the digit 4 in the numbers 444 and 424 was exhibited to\nthe agents as shown here : 4. Certain percipients wrote 4 instead\nof ^. In the case of 4, if we look down the column under this\nheading we find a certain superiority on 21 November, but none\nwhatever on 28 November. Moreover, on 5 December the number of\npercipients who wrote 4 is only slightly inferior to the number on 21\nNovember. Hence there does not appear to be much in the matter.\nThe only other case of a superiority is in the stressed digit \" 8\n\"\non 5 December and 9 January. But here again it is doubtful if\nthe superiority is large enough to warrant serious attention. In\nthe case of digits 1, 2, 7, there is no superiority.\nExplanation of Tables XIV to XXI. We have now to investigate\nwhether there is any general tendency to get the digit correct in the\nhundreds place alone, or in the tens place alone, or in the units\nplace alone, or in the case of numbers like 777 in all three places.\nTo solve this problem I have constructed first 29 tables, of which\nit will be sufficient to give the four for the date 16 January,1\non\nwhich day the number shown to the agents was 555.\nWe can confine our attention to 16 January, hundreds place\n(Table XIV). The second column under the heading Ns gives the\ntotal number of times in which each of the digits 1, 2, 3 ... 9 occurs\nin the hundreds place in all the six control experiments pooled\ntogether. IV = 1371 is the sum of these numbers. In the third\nN\ncolumn is found the value of for each digit, this representing,\ntherefore, the frequency ratio of each digit in the control series.\nColumn 7 under the heading IV,.\n1\ngives the actual number of times\nin which each of the digits 1, 2, ... 9 occurs in the hundreds place\nfor the guesses obtained on the date 16 January. In column 6 is\nN 1\nto be found the value of -^j- for each digit, IV1\nbeing the total\nN 1\nnumber of guesses on 16 January = 235. The values of ^j- are\ntherefore the actual frequency ratios for the digits 1, 2, 3, ... 9 on\n16 January.

In the example chosen 16 January (hundreds\nplace) it is clear that for s = 5 (number 555) the value of Y 2\nis \"75,\nwhich is very much less than 4.\nThe sum of the numbers in the last column, that is\n^j!=i ^s\n2\n>\nis called y\n2\n, and in the example considered (16 January) ^\n2\n= 4-88.\nThe magnitude of y\n2\ndetermines the degree of \" closeness of fit\n\"\nbetween the actual distribution (16 January) and the \" control\n\"\nseries.\nIn the particular case considered by reference to Karl Pearson's\ntables for statisticians we find for nine groups corresponding to\n^\n2 = 4-88 a value Px\na=-76. This must be interpreted to mean that\nby chance alone a worse fit than the present one (16 January) would\noccur on the average 76 times out of every 100 trials. We conclude\nthen that the distribution of digits in the hundreds place on\n16 January agrees pretty well with the distribution in the control\nseries and that the fit is a good one.\nIn the long run the value of PX\n2 should as often exceed -5 as be\nbelow -5.\nThe values of Ys\n2\nin each of the eight experiments for the hundreds\nplace digit have all been tabulated in Table XVIII, and the value\ncorresponding to the digit concentrated upon by the agents on each\ndate is in heavy type. Not one of these stressed values of Y 2\neven approaches 4, the largest being 1-50.\nThe last two rows of Table XVIII give the values of y\n2\nand PX\n2\nrespectively. It is seen that the best fit Px\n%= -93 is on 23 January\nand the worst Px\n2=-02 on 30 January. Five of the eight values\nexceed -5 and three are less than -5. In the whole table there are\n64 values of Y 2\n, and by chance alone about 5% of these might\nbe expected to exceed 4, i.e. about three values. Actually there are\ntwo such values, 5-67 and 9-81.

Again, in\nthe tens place table (Table XIX) we find that the greatest of the\nheavy type values is 1-24, so that none of these approach 4.\nOf the 80 entries in the \"tens digit\" table (XIX), we might\nexpect by chance alone 5% of 80 = 4 values of Ys\n2\nto exceed 4.\nThere are actually four such values.

There are four values of Y 2\n(slightly) exceeding 4 in the whole 50 entries, whereas chance would\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 255\npredict 2-5 such values. Two values of P^ exceed -5 and three are\nless than -5.\nTo sum up, there is an excellent agreement between the control\nseries and the series in which numbers were actually exhibited to\nthe agents. In no single case is there any evidence that the distribu-\ntion of digits in any one of the three places has been affected by\nthe concentration of the agents. The experiments in \" unconscious\"\ntransmission (9 and 16 January) have equally failed.\nThe eight number experiments considered as a whole. We have in\nall 2076 complete guesses in the eight experiments in which a three-\nfigure number was shown. Using for each week the control fre-\nquencies NJN given in the third columns of Tables XIV, XV and\nXVI, the reader may verify that the total expected numbers of\ncorrect guesses in the hundreds, tens, and units place will be 215-3,\n208-2 and 201-0 respectively. The numbers actually obtained from\nTables XIV, XV, XVI, and the twenty-one unpublished similar\ntables are found to be 213 (hundreds place), 206 (tens place), and\n201 (units place). The reader may with some labour verify that\nthe joint standard deviations for the hundreds, tens and units place\nare 13-9, 13-7 and 13-4 respectively. The close agreement between\nthe actual and expected numbers in each case is a testimony to the\nreliability of the control series.\nHad there been as many as even thirty cases of telepathy among\nthe 2076 guesses in, say, the hundreds place, we should in all\nprobability have detected it.\nFrequencies of the different digits.

In the tens place there is a tendency\nto equalisation of the different frequencies and a rise in the popularity\n\f256 S. G. Soal [part\nof two, perhaps owing to an unconscious association with the idea\nof \" second digit.\" The great popularity of 3 may be in part due\nto the wording of the instructions to the percipients to record\nimpressions of a three figure number. The low total frequency of 0\nis of course due to the fact that it cannot occur in the hundreds place.\nStudy of mental contagion among percipients. In Part I (p. 185,\nabove) of my report I gave several examples of pairs of percipients\nwho recorded identical or very similar impressions at approximately\nthe same time. Coincidences of this kind relating to material\nobjects have of course continued throughout the 1928-1929 series,\nbut curiously few of these are of any special complexity, and on the\nwhole the coincidences are less interesting than in the preliminary\nexperiments. It occurred to me that the three figure number\nexperiments might provide a means of testing this theory of mental\ncontagion.\nThe problem was as follows : Given r persons who each guess a\nthree figure number, how many of these 900 numbers (100-999\ninclusive) would one expect to be not guessed at all, guessed only\nonce, twice, three times, etc. ? Mental contagion between pairs of\npercipients would presumably increase the number of three figure\nnumbers guessed twice or more often. Two things therefore were\nrequired. First a formula for calculating the expected numbers\nof each class on a chance basis and next a criterion for testing\nsignificance of deviations from the expected numbers. Dr R. A.\nFisher, F.R.S., has very kindly supplied me with a solution to both\nthese problems, and suggests that as his method may prove useful in\nsimilar investigations, it should be printed as an appendix to the\npresent report.\nIf there are r percipients and m=r\/900, Dr Fisher's formula 1\ngives\nthe expected number of numbers guessed\n0 times = 900 xe~m\n1 \u201e =900xe-m xm\n2 \u201e =900 xe~\n3 \u201e =900xe~\nm2\n1x2\nm3\ns times =\n1x2x3\n900 x e~\nm . m'\n1x2x3 . .s\nand so on (e as usual is the base of Naperian logarithms).\nThis formula was first applied to the total 3447 guesses in the\n14 experiments, so that m=%Vr with unexpected results shown\nby the following table.\n1\nFor the demonstration of this formula see Appendix I.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 257\nTable XXII\nTimes guessed. Expected Numbers. Observed Numbers.\n0 19-35 98\n1 74-33 127\n2 142-74 145\n3 182-70 153\n4 175-34 101\n5 134-57 79\n6 86-05 63\n7 47-15 46\n8 22-60 24\n9 9-62 16\n10 3-69 13\nExceeding 10 times - 1-86 35\nTotal - 900-00 900\nThe above table shows that not only is there a small class of\nnumbers which are favoured by the percipients, but there is also\nanother class which is avoided. In fact the differences between\nthe expected numbers and the actual numbers counted in the\nexperiment for \" 0 times guessed \" and \" 1 time guessed \" are far\ntoo great to be mere chance variations.\nTable XXIII\nIn order of popularity the most highly favoured numbers are the\nfollowing :\nNumber \u00b0^ ^mes guesse(i in the Whole\nSeries [14 Experiments].\n333 56\n123 34\n111 31\n999 30\n666 27\n777 25\n555 and 321 20 each\n365 and 369 19 each\n100 and 357 18 each\n237, 371, 567 16 each\nIt will be seen that the most popular numbers are numbers with\nthree repeated digits and certain numbers whose digits are in\narithmetical progression ; 365 of course represents the number of\ndays in the year.\n\f258 S. G. Soal [part\nOf the 98 numbers not guessed at all by the percipients, there\nare 58 mumbers which have two digits the same and the third digit\ndifferent e.g. 886, 933, 808. The chance expectation is about 26-5.\nThis feature therefore would appear to be a characteristic of the\nnumbers avoided.\nOnly 3 of the 98 avoided numbers commence with the digit 3,\nwhereas 21 commence with 8 and 19 with 9.\nOwing to the considerable divergence of the expected numbers\nfrom the actual numbers in Table XXII, it does not seem possible\nto utilise Dr Fisher's formula to investigate the question of mental\ncontagion among the percipients. In Table XXIV, however, I have\ncalculated for 13 out of the 14 weeks the expected numbers of three\nfigure numbers which are guessed 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, etc. (in\nthe line opposite E) and have set under these the actual observed\nnumbers (in the line opposite A). It will be seen that the number of\nnumbers guessed twice generally agrees very closely with the ex-\npected number and seldom seriously exceeds it. This is a point\nwhich tells against the existence of mental contagion between any\nconsiderable number of pairs of percipients.\nTaking a group of percipients who have all made the same\nnumber of guesses (say 12) of three figure numbers I have examined\nwhether there is any tendency for certain individuals to be asso-\nciated in more than the average number of coincidences with the\nother percipients. For all the groups I have examined (14, 13, 12,\n11, 10 guesses respectively) I find no such tendency on the part of\nany particular individuals.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 259\nTable XXIV\nNumber Coincidences\nThis table gives for each date the number of three figure numbers\nlying between 100 and 999 which were guessed 0 times, once, twice,\nthree times, etc., together with the chance expectations.\nDate.\nGuessed\n0 times.\n1 time. 2 times. 3 times.\nMore\nthan\nQ -f- 1 T (1 flQ\nlotal.\n28 Nov E 1\n657-5 206-5 32-4 3-4 0-2 900\nA 2\n683 175 30 7 5 900\n5 Dec.

G. Soal [part\nOther investigations in connection with mental contagion, (a) I have\nalso constructed tables to examine whether there is any tendency\nfor pairs of percipients who guess the same three figure number on\na particular week to coincide in their capital letter or playing card\nguesses on the same evening. Such cases are extremely rare, but\nthey occasionally occur. Certainly they are not sufficiently\nfrequent to suggest anything beyond chance coincidence.\nExample\nDate : 27 February. Percipient : no. 337. Percipient : no. 518.\nThree figure number : 428. Capital letter : H.\nA comparison of the records of percipients 337 and 518 reveals\nlittle evidence of mental contagion on other evenings on which both\ntook part.\nIn the following example there is not only coincidence in the\nthree figure number and capital letter experiments, but also approxi-\nmate coincidence in the case of the playing card.\nDate: 27 February. Percipient: no. 133. Three figure number :\n355. Capital letter : G. Playing card : 6 of Clubs.\nDate : 27 February. Percipient : no. 208 (automatic writer).\nThree figure number : 355. Capital letter : G. Playing card :\n6 of Spades.\nHere again though there are slight minor coincidences between\nnos. 133 and 208 on other dates, there is no convincing evidence\nthat these percipients were in telepathic communication.\n(b) Tables have also been drawn up to determine whether there\nwas any tendency for the additional agents who concentrated on\nthe same object for the first five or ten minutes to be put into mental\nrapport during the second and third ten minutes when they acted\nas percipients. One hundred and five of the 579 percipients acted\nas additional agents between 5 December 1928 and 27 March 1929,\nand the average number of transmissions done by each agent was\nabout four, although certain persons did as many as eight or nine\ntransmissions. From these tables made out for each week I find\nno serious evidence of mental contagion, either \"telepathic\" or\n\" suggestive,\" among the agents with regard to objects, geometrical\ndrawings, capital letters, three figure numbers or playing cards.\nThese tables can be seen by anyone wishing to consult them.\n(c) As regards the \"object \" guesses, there were of course numerous\ncases each week of two or more percipients guessing the same\nobject but the coincidences seldom showed any degree of complexity\nin detail. For some 200 of the 579 percipients Miss Carruthers\nmade out for each percipient a complete list of all the coincidences\nbetween the impressions of the percipient and those of all the\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 261\nremaining percipients who took part on the same evening. The\ncoincidences for the most part are of a very simple and commonplace\nkind, such as \"Fan,\" \" Basket,\" \" Yellow flowers,\" \"Ladies' shoes,\"\n\" Polar bear,\" etc. Only very occasionally is there anything a\nlittle more complex, e.g.\n12 Dec W G^mdeman swinging small weight at end of string.\n'\n(203 (i) A small ball swinging by a thread.\n21 Nov W Gentleman measuring with a tape measure.\n'\\193 (hi) Old gentleman with measuring tape.\nIn the last example it was revealed by further correspondence\nthat no. 193 imagined his gentleman to be measuring \" ground,\"\nwhile no. 199 saw his gentleman measuring another man along the\nback, presumably for a suit. But even the examples we have quoted\nare almost the only ones worthy of note. Moreover, such interesting\ncoincidences as these never occur twice between the same pair of\npercipients. Between nos. 199 and 203, for instance, I find no\nfurther coincidences of even a simple kind. The same is true for\nnos. 199 and 193.\nIt must be confessed in conclusion that throughout the present\nextensive series of experiments I find no satisfactory evidence of\nwhat Warcollier has called \"mental contagion\" that cannot be\nreasonably explained away as pointing to either a definite suggestion\nfrom the agents conveyed normally to the percipients or to the\ninfluences of a common civilised environment. And there I must\nleave the question.\nD. Capital Letters\nThere were four attempts to transmit the impression of a capital\nletter of the English alphabet, together with five control experi-\nments. On each of the four occasions the letter was selected by\nme by striking a page of print at random with the point of a pencil,\nthe eyes being closed. The letter chosen was drawn on a postcard.\nStatistical analysis. No single percipient guessed more than one\nof the four letters correctly. The method adopted is precisely\nsimilar to that used in the three figure number experiments. It\nwill suffice to give a single table 1\n\u2014that for 30 January, when the\nletter H was shown. In the second column Table XXV we find\nthe aggregate number of times each letter was guessed in all five\ncontrol experiments. In the last column but one is recorded the\nnumber of times each letter was guessed on 30 January.

As addi-\ntional agents were frequently employed this selection generally\ntook place in the presence of Miss Carruthers, a few days before the\ndate of the experiment.\nIndividual residts.

On the five Wednesday evenings commencing 2 October\nand ending 6 November 1929 it was arranged that I alone should\nconcentrate on five playing cards between 10.0 p.m. and 10.25 p.m.\nFive minutes were allowed for the transmission of each card, the\nmethod of transmission being active concentration and visualisation\nfor the first three cards and the \" glance and forget \" method for the\nremaining two. The five cards for each evening were drawn by\nCol. Hayward at 31 Tavistock Square, in the sole presence of Miss\nCarruthers, who noted their values and posted each card to me\nin a sealed envelope, which arrived on the morning of the experiment.\nThe seals were broken at home or elsewhere by me at the times\nindicated on the envelopes, 10.0 p.m., 10.5 p.m., etc., in the presence\nof a witness who duly affixed his signature.\nThe six percipients received the usual notice with the appropriate\ntimes inserted and sent in their impressions to the S.P.R. Office\nin the usual way. These impressions were received by Miss Car-\nruthers, who kept a record of them.\nEach percipient thus did 25 guesses. These sets of 25 were scored\non Fisher's system.\nThe scores were as follows :\nIt will be seen that all these scores are well under 15-18 and\nthere is no suggestion of supernormal faculty on the part of any\npercipient.\nInvestigation of colour and suit.

I thus obtain j9^=-513 and ^> B =-487.\nThe factors obtained on the basis of the three control experiments\nagree pretty well with the above values, being pK = -521 and pB = -479,\neven although the control series is a somewhat small one. I have\nbased my preference factors on the joint experiment rather than\non the B.B.C. experiment, since the conditions of the former experi-\nment more nearly approach those of the actual series in which the\ncard guessed one week probably to some extent influences the choice\nin the succeeding week. It will be seen from Table XXIX that all\nthe deviations with the exception of that on 6 February are less than\n2 x S.D. This particular week (6 February) does not, however,\nfurnish any evidence in favour of the supernormal since the deviation\nis negative. But what is really important is the fact that on the\nwhole series the deviation (\n- 25) is well under 2 x S.D. = 32-8.\nTable XXIX\nAnalysis of Colour\nBased on the 6317 guesses of the \" joint \" card-guessing experiment.\nPreference Factors (Red) ^= -513.\n\u201e (Black) ^= -487.\nDate.\nCard\nshown.\nNumber\nof\nGuesses.\nNumber\nwith\nColour\ncorrect.\nExpected\nNumbers.\nDeviations\nfrom\nExpected\nNumbers.\nStandard\nDevia-\ntions.\n23 Jan. 2D 274 144 141 + 3 \u00b18-3\n6 Feb. 4S 214 81 104 -23 \u00b17-3\n20 Feb. 6C 234 121 114 + 7 \u00b17-6\n27 Feb. 5H 195 87 100 -13 \u00b17-0\n27 Mar. 3H 166 86 85 + 1 \u00b16-4\nTotals 1083 519 544 -25\nS.D. for whole series = \u00b1 V(8-3) 2\n+ (7-6)\n2\n+ (7-3)\n2\n+ (7-0)\n2\n+ (6-4)\n2\n= \u00b116-4\nActual deviation for whole series = -25.\n1\npn, for instance, is obtained by dividing the number of times in which a\nred suit was chosen by the total number of guesses 6317 furnished by the\njoint experiment.\n\f2f;<; S.

He has also kindly\nallowed me to copy out data from Karl Pearson's tables for\nstatisticians in the library of the laboratory.\nI have already had occasion to mention the valuable assistance\nrendered me by Dr Fisher, F.R.S., in solving the problem of the\nnumber coincidences, and the best thanks of the Society are due to\nthis gentleman, as well as to Dr Pearson, for the unfailing courtesy\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 267\nand patience with which they have met the difficulties of a mere\nbeginner in statistics.\nI must also thank my friend Dr A. E. Church, another statistician,\nfor very useful advice relating to the graph showing the distribution\nof scores.\nThe dictionary tests, 1928-1929. The dictionary \"control\"\nwas continued throughout the year 1928-1929 under the conditions\ndescribed in Part I. Many percipients, however, omitted to carry\nout the dictionary test and most others erred in choosing an in-\nsufficient number of words to tally with the number of distinct ideas\ncontained in their impressions. Some excuse must, of course, be\nallowed as opinions as to what constituted a distinct idea must\nnaturally vary. An impression such as \" saw man tossing a ball\n\"\nwould, according to my intention, require three \" control words\n\"\ncorresponding to the three different ideas of \" man,\" \" tossing\n\"\nand \" ball,\" whereas many percipients would content themselves\nwith only one word.\nThe only use I have made of the control in the present series of\nexperiments is to examine, for the sake of curiosity, the number of\nsuccessful hits scored by the dictionary each week on the objects\nshown to the agents.

Although in the present series his total percentage\nscore is only 11-2%, he is the most successful of all the percipients\nin guessing the colour of the object (cf. p. 233). However, in the\ncard-guessing experiment his forte was decidedly not colour or suit,\nbut number. The coincidence, therefore, is probablv only a mere\nfluke.\nSimilarly, of the eight percipients with possible scores 5=300 who\nobtained the highest percentage mean scores in the present experi-\nment (15-2 - 14-0%), only one obtained a mean score in the card-\nguessing experiment exceeding 12 (12-7). The other seven were\nbelow even the average (11-18). There appears, therefore, no sort\nof correlation between successful guessing in the two experiments.\nConclusion. At the end of an elaborate and somewhat minute\nexamination which has occupied a considerable portion of the leisure\ntime of four years we may conclude without hesitation that we fail\nto discover on the scale of the present experiments any general\nmass faculty of supernormal perception. And this is true for each\nof the five classes of objects which have been made the material of\nexperiment. Increasing the number of agents even until it reaches\n30 per cent, of the number of the percipients produces no observable\neffect on the result. Similarly we fail to find any serious evidence\nwhatever for what Warcollier has called \" la contagion mentale\n\"\nor telepathic rapport between pairs or among groups of percipients.\nBut though I have spent weeks searching for such things as\ncross-correspondences, I have not found them. What does seem\nto emerge from the present experiments is the real existence of\nmass preference factors for certain simple geometrical figures\nletters of the alphabet, colours, numbers, etc. That these factors\nare subject to a certain limited fluctuation is only to be expected,\nbut when the same group of people work week after week under the\nsame conditions they appear to remain fairly constant. The same\nis probably true within wider limits of common objects, such as\ncats, dogs, flowers, birds, etc., though, as we have seen in the experi-\nments with the black cloth, a simple suggestion from the experimenter\nwill readily disturb the distribution and cause certain classes of\nobjects to be guessed with more than the usual frequency.\nHow far the determination and use of such preference factors\nwill be an aid in appraising the value of successful hits in future\nexperiments practice can alone determine. From the data of the\npresent experiment I have worked out such preference factors for\nmore than 150 different objects. The value of p = l in N given for\neach object may be taken to represent (with fair approximation\nwhen p is greater than 1 \/100 but only roughly where p is less than\n\f270 S. 0. Soal [part\n1 \/1000) the chance that the average person who keeps his mind\npassive for ten minutes and records during that interval an average\nof 1-85 distinct visualisations shall note the object in question.\nFor the object \" flowers of any description \" the \" average \" person\nof the particular class who did the experiments might be expected\nto note a flower or flowers about once in 18 sittings in the long run.\nBut this \" average \" person probably does not exist as an indi-\nvidual, since each person in the world will have a bias towards\ncertain specific classes of objects. Yet even when dealing with\nan individual one might reasonably expect that his preferences\nwould be abnormal only with respect to a small percentage of the\nobjects catalogued in the present lists, covering as these do an\nextremely wide and representative field.\nAt the same time the tables of preference factors will be better\nadapted for testing considerable groups of people than individuals.\nNeedless to add that the persons subjected to these \" stan-\ndardised \" object tests should not be those who have studied the\npresent lists, for with such persons the tests might fail as igno-\nminiously as the standardised Binet-Simon tests of intelligence\nif applied to a group of schoolboys who had learned the answers\nto all the questions given in Mr Burt's book.\nBut to return to the main conclusions of this report. If we have\nfailed on the present scale of numbers to obtain evidence of a mass\nfaculty of supernormal perception, we have failed equally to discover\nindividual percipients with indisputable claims to a supernormal\npower. Two or three isolated cases in which the evidence is\nsuggestive, but very far from conclusive in any way, is all we are\nable to record.\nThis almost universal paucity of continued success in our opinion\ngreatly enhances the claims of a few exceptional people in the world\n(such as Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard) to be considered possessors\nof supernormal faculties. For these individuals have succeeded\nin producing extraordinarily complex coincidences week after\nweek and year after year. Between the work of say Mrs Leonard\nand that of any percipient who took part in the present experiments\nthere is a wide and unbridgeable gulf. That does not, of course,\nimply that had Mrs Leonard taken part in the present series she\nwould have done immeasurably better than the average, for it may\nbe that the conditions of the present experiment are not those\nunder which supernormal knowledge makes its appearance. Possibly\nsome special state of mind such as hypnosis or trance in combination\nwith faculties that cannot be cultivated but are innate is required\nbefore perception at a distance takes place. Possibly also the\nco-operation of the discarnate is necessary for the production of\ntelepathy among the living. And even when, as in the case of Mrs\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 271\nLeonard, such a combination is realised some sort of personal link\nmay be necessary, such as a glove, etc., belonging to the person\nwhose environment the psychic is trying to penetrate. Or again,\nsome strong emotional stimulus, such as belief in the spirit hypo-\nthesis provides, may be an important factor.\nIn the case of normal or almost normal persons, we may doubt\nif they ever have experiences of telepathic perception, except when\nin some state of peculiar mental stress or crisis.\nIt is hoped that the present report will at least do something to\ncombat a growing tendency on the part of many psychical re-\nsearchers to assume, and apparently to believe, that psychic ex-\nperiences are as common as blackberries. One constantly hears\nof little groups of people, apparently the possessors of no exceptional\nor outstanding psychic gifts, describing experiments in telepathy\namong themselves, and success is almost invariably claimed for\nsuch experiments. Such accounts will seldom bear a critical\nexamination. The usual method is to select a few of the more\nstriking coincidences from large numbers of failures. Then follows\na vaguely worded reference to percentages of successes, in which the\nterm \" success \" is often allowed the most elastic interpretation,\nnot infrequently being applied to objects not even selected by the\nexperimenter. But mere percentages of successes are not very\nuseful unless we have definite and precise expectations with which\nto compare them. In such experiments as I am alluding to these\nstandards of comparison are almost invariably lacking, or at any\nrate inadequate. Moreover, instead of being given an exact\naccount of the precise conditions under which each experiment was\ncarried out, we are regaled with \"samples\" of successes generally\nchosen to illustrate preconceived theories of the way in which\ntelepathy is supposed to work. I believe this inveterate deter-\nmination to find the supernormal at all costs in every series of\nexperiments to be the most injurious influence in psychical research\nto-day. The scepticism of the open-minded man of science who\nhas not given much attention to the subject is an entirely wholesome\nthing compared with the \" will to believe \" shown by the class of\npsychical researchers whose real aim appears to be not the investiga-\ntion of the conditions under which telepathy and clairvoyance\noccur, or the question whether they occur at all, but the production\nof examples of these faculties for the purpose of bolstering up beliefs\nthey hold on the destiny and spiritual nature of man or for the purpose\nof confuting the spirit hyjMhesis. It is easy to understand how\nthe psychic researcher actuated by such motives becomes the\nprey to self-deception, as it is easy to understand his innate dislike\nof statistical methods, and in fact of all minute and dispassionate\nthreshing out and weighing up of evidence. His desire is for\n\f272 S. G. Soal [PART 123]\nsupernormal happenings, and he is not disposed to look too critically\nat the methods by which these supposedly supernormal facts were\nestablished. And experiments in telepathy and clairvoyance\nunfortunately are the easiest in the world to manipulate so as to\ngive the illusion of success.\nBut in the present obscure position of psychical research, when\neven the occurrence of telepathy is granted by only a small minority\nof men of science, it is just as important to investigate conditions\nunder which telepathy does not occur as to produce specific examples\nof its occurrence. It is because I have felt that the methods we\nemploy in estimating our results are at least as important as the\nresults themselves that I have thought it worth while to carry out\nthis investigation to the bitter end of a negative conclusion.\n\fAPPENDIX I\nDr K.

The following\nmethod is due to the genius of Prof. Karl Pearson.\nThe quantity formed by adding together the squares of the values\nof Ys\nfor all the different groups,\ni.e. + F2\n2\n+ Y3\n2\n+ . . . Yk\n2\n, is known as %\n2\nand is a sort of measure of the discrepancy between the two sets\nN, N1 considered as wholes.\nNow provided that the values of ns and ns\nx\nare not too small (say\nwhen all the values ns, are each ^10 or thereabouts), Prof.\nPearson has shown that it is possible to estimate theoretically the\nprobability, in drawing two random samples N, N1\nfrom a large\ncommon population classed in k groups, of obtaining a value of yj-\ngreater than or equal to some observed value. Tables have been\nconstructed on the double entry principle in which the values of\nX\n2\nare tabulated horizontally at unit intervals and k the number of\ngroups tabulated vertically. For each pair of values of y\n2\nand k\nwe read from the table a decimal called Px\nz. This quantity Px\nt\nrepresents the chance or probabibty that if the two sets N, N1\nwere random samples of a common population a value of y\n2\nas\ngreat or greater than the actual value would be obtained.\nLet us illustrate by taking Table XVI. On 16 January the\nnumber 555 is shown to the agents in London. At the same time\n235 persons in different parts of the country each guess a three figure\nnumber. A certain proportion of the guesses registered will have\n5 as the last figure, i.e. in the units place. What we wish to know\n\f278 S. G. Soal [part\nis : Is the proportion of 5's in the last place greater than it would\nhave been if the agents had not concentrated on any number at all ?\nWe can only test this by finding out what the proportion of 5's is\non an evening when the agents do not think of any three figure\nnumber. But it is obviously better to take six such evenings and\npool the numbers obtained and so obtain a more truly representative\nproportion than could be obtained from a single evening. Now\nsince the last figure may be 0, 1, 2, ... 9 there are altogether ten\ngroups, so that k= 10. We therefore count the numbers each week\nwhich fall into each of these ten groups, and by pooling the six\nweeks' contributions to each group we obtain ten larger groups.\nThe numbers nv n2 ,\n... nl0 in these control groups are tabulated\nopposite the corresponding digits in the second column of Table\nXVI. The sum of the values in the ten groups, i.e. w1 + M2 + n3 + ...n10,\nis equal to 1371, which is our N of the first set. The proportions\nfor each group fthat is the values of ^) are tabulated in the third\ncolumn.\nNow our second set N1 consists of the 235 guesses obtained on\n16 January, and in Col. 7, under the heading (16 January), are\ntabulated the number of guesses which fall in each of the ten groups.\nThus iV1\n= 235 and \u00ab 5\n1 = 20. The proportions for each group, that\nis the values of are tabulated in Col. 5 under this heading.\nThus #-\u00a3-0*5.\nCol. 4 gives the values of the difference ~ -\n^ for each group.\nIn this particular example it happens that the proportion\nn i\n6\n1\nN\n\u2022085 is actually less than the proportion ^ in the control\nexperiments, so that there can be no question of the concentration\nof the agents having increased the proportion of 5's.\nStill this is not always the case, and by examining the value of\nYs\n2\nin the last column we can see in the case of any digit whether\nthe difference in the two proportions is probably due to chance or\nnot. In this example we look in the last column opposite the\ndigit 5 and find F5\n2\n= 1-27.\nThis shows that F5 is considerably less than 2 and no significance\ncan be attached to the difference in proportions of the given experi-\nment and the control for this particular digit. But the same holds\ngood for each of the other digits, since each value of Ys\n2\nin the last\ncolumn is considerably less than 4. If, however, we wish to see\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 279\nhow the series for 16 January compares as a whole with the control\nseries (i.e. whether or not they can be regarded as two samples\ndrawn from a much larger series) we add up the values of Ys\n2\nin\nthe last column and thus obtain y\n2\n= 1\\\n2\n+ Y. 2\n+ Yz\n2\n+ ---^io\n2\n-\n(f here = 8-61, with k =10.)\nTurning now to the last two rows of Table XX, under the date\n16 January we read #\n2\n= 8-61, Px\na = 47.\nThis must be interpreted to mean that if we made a pair of\ncontrol experiments employing no agents, and if in the first experi-\nment 1371 guesses were obtained and in the second only 235 guesses,\nthen if we kept on repeating this pair of experiments (taking care\nthat the batch of guesses and other general conditions did not vary)\nwe might expect to get a value of y\n2\nas large as or greater than\n8-67 on the average about 47 times \"in every 100 trials. In other\nwords the divergence of the series on 16 January from the combined\ncontrol series is so commonplace that it would be about even odds\nthat you would get a divergence as great on a single trial.\nAs explained on p. 247 tables similar to Table XVI were con-\nstructed for each three figure number experiment, separate tables\nbeing made for the hundreds, tens and units digits.\nTo have published all these tables, 29 in number, would, however,\nhave been very expensive, and, moreover, unnecessary, since the only\nvital part of each table is the last column giving the values of 1 3\n2\nfor each digit.\nI have thought it wise to give these last columns in full, since\nobviously it was important to demonstrate that the experiments on\nindividual weeks really are close fits with the control series.\nIf the general fits had been bad we might have had to conclude\nthat mass preferences for numbers, capital letters, etc. were so\nfluctuating and unreliable as to defy any attempts at statistical\nevaluation. In such an event, of course, the controls would have\nbeen useless.\nThe last columns of the 29 three figure number tables have been\ncollected under each date in Tables XVIII-XXI. From these\ntables we can find the value of Y 2\nfor any digit in the hundreds,\ntens or units places for each date on which the agents concentrated\non a three figure number. The sum of the numbers in each column\ngives the value of %\n2\n, and under this is tabulated the corresponding\nvalue of Px\n2. In each column the value in heavy type is the value\nof Y 2\ncorresponding to the special digit exhibited to the agents\non the date at the head of the column. Had there been any con-\nsiderable occurrence of mass telepathy a good proportion of these\nheavy type values (considerably exceeding say 30 per cent.) would\nhave been greater than 4, whereas not even a single value in any of\nthe four tables even approaches 4.\n\fAPPENDIX III\nList of Objects of Experiment and Individual\nScoring System, October 1928-March 1929 1\nI. 10 October 1928 ; 414 percipients ;\nagents : Prof, and Mrs M.,\nMiss B., Mr 0., and S.

It was obviously important that I should be\nable to examine all the impressions they thought it worth while to\nsend me. On the other hand, for the purpose of scoring each\nindividual performance it was clearly essential that all percipients\nshould be put, as far as possible, on a common basis. Otherwise a\npercipient who crowded a large number of impressions into the\nten minute interval would have an undue advantage over another\nwho made only a solitary guess.\nThere naturally arises the question as to what is to be considered\nas a single impression. After some consideration it seemed that\nthe most natural unit to take was a visualisation or sensation. In\nwhat follows I have taken as a distinct impression a group of objects\nthat appear to have been grasped by the percipient as a single mental\npicture. For instance I have counted examples like the following\nas single impressions, even though there may be more than one\nobject mentioned :\n(a) Small branch of holly with red berries.\n(b) High white peaks against a dark blue sky.\n(c) An elephant wearing spectacles.\n(d) Pricking sensation in right knee and arm.\nIn the majority of instances there was no difficulty in counting\nin this scheme the number of distinct impressions recorded in each\nten minute period. A record like the following :\nNo. 509, 12 December\u2014(i) A chubby child ;\na piano ; a melon\nwould be taken to comprise three distinct pictures or impressions.\nIn a small percentage of cases, however, the matter was not so\nsimple and I have had to use my judgment as to what constituted\na single impression. Such an example as \" A stone archway which\nafterwards changed into a bright horseshoe \" I have generally\ncounted as two distinct guesses, since there seem to have been two\nseparate mental pictures.\n350\n\f[part 123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 351\nIn cases where a percipient recorded more than one distinct\nvisualisation or sensation the following procedure was adopted for\nthe purpose of allocating the individual score. Two dice (one large,\none small) were shaken together in a bone cup. In the case where\nthe percipient gave two distinct visualisations or sensations in the\nsame ten minute interval the first of the two impressions was chosen\nfor scoring if the large die turned up an odd number. If the per-\ncipient gave three distinct impressions in the ten minutes the first,\nsecond or third was scored, according as the large die turned up a\nnumber from the three pairs, 1,6; 2, 4 ; or 3, 5. In the case of\nfour impressions the first, second, third or last was scored, according\nas the pair of dice showed the combinations Oo, Ee, Oe and Eo, the\nletters 0, o referring to the odd faces of the large and small dice\nrespectively and the letters E, e to the even faces. In the case of\nfive or six impressions being given in the same ten minute interval\nthe impression chosen for scoring was determined by the number\nturned up by the large die. In the case where there were two concrete\nobjects shown on the same evening a preliminary throw of the dice was\nmade for the purpose of deciding which of the two ten minute intervals\nwas to be chosen for scoring the object in question. When, however, a\ncorrect impression was recorded in the same ten minute interval as that\nin which the corresponding object was shown, this preliminary throw\ntoas dispensed with and the guess to be scored was chosen as explained\nabove from this same ten minute interval. This was done in con-\nformity with my plan to give previsional or post impressions a\ncertain chance with the contemporary ones. Thus it might\nhappen that the two impressions chosen for scoring, although refer-\nring to different objects, were contained in the same ten minute\ninterval.\nIt must be clearly understood that the above scheme only applies\nto the allocation of the individual numerical scores and that no\nsuch restrictions of choice were made in constructing the Object\nTables XXXIII. In making these tables all the guesses ivere included\nthat occurred in the same ten minute interval. Moreover, in the\nsections entitled \" Further consideration of the 27 objects \"\n(p. 232)\nand \" A few typical impressions \"\n(p. 235) all guesses have been\ntaken into consideration in choosing the successes.\nIn view of the fact that all impressions recorded in the same\nten minutes were included in the object tables, it was necessary to\nmake some further investigations on the average number of im-\npressions recorded in a ten minute interval. There were altogether\nwith the whole 579 percipients 8784 ten minute intervals in which\nimpressions were recorded bearing on the 27 objects. The average\nnumber of impressions noted per ten minute interval was 1-85.\nThe distribution of these numbers of visualisations is not at all of\n\f352 S. G. Soal [part\nthe normal type. It is roughly indicated by the following per-\ncentages :\nNumber of impressions per Percentage number\nten minute interval. of intervals.\n0 6-3%\n1 44-3%\n2 25-2%\n3 12-2%\n4 6-3%\n5 3-0%\n6 1-5%\nExceeding 6 impressions 1*1%\n8784 = 100%\nThe tables showing the analysis for each individual percipient\nhave been preserved and may be examined by anyone wishing to\ndo so. The variability of the distribution, it will be seen, is very\nwide (S.D. = l-4 approximately).\nThe average number of impressions per ten minute interval varies\nconsiderably week by week. The highest is 2-48 on 13 February\nand the lowest 1-49 on 16 January and 24 October (each date). As\nregards the numbers given in the object tables, it will be obvious\nthat the average guessing chance per percipient is considerably\nhigher on say 13 February than it is on 24 October. It is therefore\nnecessary to reduce the actual numbers of percipients who took part\neach week to the corresponding effective numbers as regards\nguessing power. We have seen that the average number of impres-\nsions per ten minute interval is 1-85. This is also the average for\nthe week 13 March. We may take the number of actual percipients\non 13 March (252) as our standard number and modify the remaining\nactual numbers in a proportion varying with the average weekly\nguessing power. We thus obtain the following table :\nTable XXXIV\nOctober November\n10 17 24 31 7 14 21 28\nActual numbers 414 386 385 355 327 311 342 313\nEffective numbers -\n435 320 308 298 271 261 304 282\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 353\nTable XXXIV {continued)\nDecember January Feb.

Average possible score for the 374 percipients =682\n160 psychics =705\n214 non-psychics = 665.\nIt will be seen that the psychics have done slightly more work\nthan the remainder of the group.\n2. I have worked out the average number of visualisations per\nten minute interval for each of the 374 percipients on the object\nintervals.\nThe mean average per percipient = 1-64.\nThe distribution of the 374 averages is of the normal type with a\ncertain skewness (S.D. = -85).\nFor the 160 psychics the mean of the averages is 1-97. There\nseems definite evidence that on the whole the psychics tend to\ngive more impressions per ten minute interval than the remainder\nof the group.\n3. The average number of impressions (visualisations, auditions,\netc.) for the 374 percipients on the objects is 33-5 (S.D. = 20). For\nthe men the average is 33-2 (S.D. = 21).\nFor the 160 psychics the average is 38-0.\nAgain, we see that on the 27 objects the psychics appear to have\naveraged more guesses than the remainder. This is a sign of keener\nenthusiasm among those who claim to psychic powers.\n(c) Explanation of tables.\u2014These preference tables are based on\nthe 8784 ten minute intervals in which objects guesses were made,\nthe 2705 geometrical impressions selected for scoring, and the 2394\ncapital letter guesses.\nLet us take first the Tables A-G. The numbers given in the second\ncolumn under the heading p = l in are obtained by dividing 8784\nby the total number of times each item is mentioned by the 579\n\f354 S. G. Soal [part\npercipients. 1\nIt will of course be understood that if a percipient\nmentioned the same item more than once in the same ten minute\ninterval his impression would only be counted once. If, however,\nthe percipient registered say \" flowers \" in two ten minute intervals\non the same evening, two impressions would be contributed to the\ntotal count for Item 1 (flowers).\nThe number 18 in the second column opposite Item 1 for instance\ngives the average chance of guessing any sort of flower or flowers\nin a ten minute interval as 1\/18.\nThis value 1\/18, however, is merely that obtained by observing\nthe guesses of a limited number of people (579) spread over a limited\ninterval of time. To get the true value of p, the chance of guessing\na flower we should have to experiment with a whole population at\nvarying times of the year. The value p = 1\/18 therefore can only\nbe considered as an approximation obtained from a sample of the\npopulation. And even this sample may not be a truly representative\none. But assuming that it is a fairly representative sample we may\ndeduce from this observed value limits between which the true value\nprobably lies.\nLet p be the observed chance (Column 2). Then if the true value\nof p is p\n1\nthe observed value p obtained from N observations will\nnot often lie outside the limits\nIpHl-v1\n)\np\n1\n\u00b12<\\J jy\n'\n* -6. ^\u00b12 x standard deviation.\nThe limits for the true value are therefore the roots of the quadratic\n{N + 4)(^)\n2 - 2(pN + 2)p\nl\n+ Np* = 0.\nIf N is large (say 2000) a good approximation is given by\nand from this formula with iV = 8784 the limits between which the\ntrue value of p\n1\nfor each item most probably lies have been calcu-\nlated. These limits are given in Column 3.\nIn cases where the observed value of p is less than 1 in 1757 I\nhave thought it not worth while to give either the observed value\nor the limits, as these would be too wide and inaccurate to be of any\nvalue. A blank has therefore been left opposite items where p\nworks out to be less than 1\/1757.\nThe above tables (A-G) are constructed on the assumption that\non an average each percipient makes 1-85 visualisations or sensations\n1\nIn counting the number of mentions for any particular item in Table\nXXXIII the numbers in italics are omitted since they correspond to stray\nimpressions recorded during a geometrical or three-figure test, etc.\n\f123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 355\nper ten minute interval. If it is required to find what is the chance\nof guessing any given item with a solitary visualisation there will\nbe no serious error if the limits in Column 3 are divided by 1-85.\nIn the case of Tables H and I the assumption is that each per-\ncipient makes a solitary guess at a geometrical sketch or capital\nletter, since where two guesses were made by a percipient only the\nfirst was chosen.\nThe numbers given opposite each item in the last column under\nthe heading - 10 log10 p are intended to be used as scores for\nsuccessful guesses if this experiment is ever repeated, using the\nobjects given in the table and under similar conditions. Such a\nsystem of scores, it is believed, will prove more rational than the\narbitrary system employed in the present experiment.\nIn conclusion, it should be borne in mind that the present tables\ncannot be accepted in any sense as final. They represent merely\nthe best I have been able to do with the material at my disposal.\nMany assumptions have been admitted as to the independence of\nthe different object guesses, but such assumptions are almost un-\navoidable under existing circumstances.\nBut even with these manifold limitations it is hoped that they will\nenable future experimenters to give a rough estimate of the prob-\nability of an average person successfully guessing an object\nconcentrated on by an agent.\n\f356 S.

For instance,\nhe displayed a picture for two minutes and then asked for a descrip-\ntion of it. Valuable work was also done by Claparede and his\npupils,3\nbut in recent years the most important researches in this\nfield have been done in Germany, largely under the inspiration of\nProfessor William Stern and of the Beitrdge zur Psychologie der\nAussage founded by him.4\nThe investigation has been given a\nstrong legal bias, the primary object of the experiments being to\ninquire into the validity of testimony given in proceedings at law,\nparticularly in criminal cases. A typical experiment is that con-\nducted in Professor Stern's criminological seminary in Berlin.\nDuring the course of a discussion two of the participators, by private\narrangement, simulated a violent quarrel. The witnesses were then\nasked to draw up reports of what they had seen, with a view to\ngiving evidence in court. 5\nIt is to be noted that the object of such\nexperiments is not to test vision, perception generally, memory,\nobservation, etc., but rather the complex of all these and other\nelements which go to make up the reporting of an experienced fact,\nin short, the giving of testimony. To achieve this the investigator\nreproduces as closely as possible the sort of event into the testimony\nconcerning which he is inquiring, and then studies the reports\nobtained of this event.\n1\n1 owe grateful thanks to Mrs Salter, without whose help and encouragement\nthis experiment would not have been carried out ; and to Miss Jephson, for\na valued offer of help.\n2\nA.

Mr S. J. Davey, an\namateur conjuror, gave performances in slate-writing in imitation\nof those given by the medium William Eglinton, and succeeded in\nconvincing many sitters that they had witnessed supernormal pheno-\nmena.1\nIt was a valuable beginning, but curiously enough no\nfurther work on these lines has been done since that date (1886).\nI had therefore for some years been anxious to make some\ninvestigations into testimony in relation to paraphysical phenomena\ngenerally. I made a beginning in June 1928, taking advantage of\nthe presence in London of a self-avowed fraudulent medium.2\nIt was\narranged for this medium to go through his usual performance in the\nSociety's seance-room. Five sitters were invited, three of whom\nwere left under the impression that they were to witness a genuine\nsitting. This is the ideal form in which an experiment of this kind\nshould be conducted, since only thus can the conditions of an\nordinary sitting be reproduced subjectively as well as objectively.\nI was also anxious to test such points as the effect of fatigue in a\nlong sitting and of progressive familiarity with certain phenomena\nin a series of sittings. It soon became clear, however, that on those\nlines it would be impossible to carry out the experiment on a suffi-\nciently large scale. Eventually, in October 1931, the following letter\nwas sent by Mrs Salter to a selected list of members of the Society :\n\" With the approval of the Council a series of experimental\nsittings is shortly to be held in the Society's seance-room for the\npurpose of investigating the most favourable conditions for observa-\ntion in sittings for physical phenomena. It is proposed for this\npurpose to reproduce the conditions of an average sitting and to\ncause a few simple phenomena to take place by normal means.\nThe sitters will then be asked to fill up a short questionnaire dealing\nwith the events of the sitting. It is hoped to obtain in this way\nvaluable material bearing on the conduct of sittings for physical\nphenomena.\n\"Will you kindly let me know whether you are willing to participate\nin this experiment by attending one of the sittings ? This would\ntake up only an hour or so of your time. Your name will not be\npublished without your consent. I shall be happy to send you,\non request, any further information you may like to have.\"\nA sufficient number of members agreed to take part and six\nsittings were accordingly arranged, in which forty-two sitters took\n1\nProceedings S.P.B., iv. 381 ff., viii. 253 ff.\n2\nSee my \" Report of a Pseudo-Sitting for Phj'sical Phenomena with Karl\nKraus.\" Journal S.P.R., xxiv. 388 ff.\n\f124] The Psychology of Testimony 365\npart, each attending one sitting.

Moving to the \" medium's \" table\nand standing by it I said, \" There is really very little to explain.\nA few simple phenomena will be gone through and you will after-\nwards be asked to answer some questions about them. These\nquestions will relate only to facts and not to interpretations, so that\nyou needn't worry how anything happens, but only try and observe\ncarefully what happens. The lady in the medium's chair is not of\ncourse a real medium, but a Member of the Society who is kindly\ntaking the part. I will now show you what lighting we have.\"\nOn this I sat down and slowly reduced, extinguished, and put on\nagain, by means of the rheostat, the white and red ceiling lights.\nImmediately after\n0.2 I switched on the gramophone and said, \" You are of course\nquite at liberty to talk as much as you please.\"\n0.7 I switched off the gramophone.\n0.10 There was a knock on the outside of the door. I rose and\nwent to the door. As I put my hand on the handle of the door\nto open it, the \" medium \" put out her right hand and moved the\nbell from its first position (as shown on the plan) to the other end\nof the table, behind the tambourine (as shown on the photograph).\nWhen this was done I had begun to open the door, which I then\nopened wide, leaving the room and at once returning, putting a\nwhite card (5x3 in.) in my pocket. On returning I sat down and\nat once put out all the lights and re-started the gramophone. In\nthe darkness I said, \" You will see that all the objects on the table\nare luminous.\" Then the \" medium \" removed the drumstick\nwhich lay on the table at her left and placed it in the opening of\nthe curtains just over and behind her head ; moved the bell back to\nits original position ;\npinned a prepared cloth over her face ; and\ntook the trumpet in her hand. Unfortunately the larger opening\nof the trumpet then pointed by an oversight at some sittings to\nthe \" medium's \" left and at others to her right. No account is\ntherefore taken of this point in the scoring.\n0.15 I said, \" I ought to warn you that in a few minutes I shall\nmake a flashlight exposure, so please observe everything as closely\nas you can during the flash. I will give you another warning\nimmediately before the flash.\" At the same time I put on a dim\nred light, which threw an appreciable amount of red light on the\nceiling but gave no visibility below.\n0.19 I stopped the gramophone, said, \" I'm now going to make\nthe flash,\" and did so, immediately thereafter starting the gramo-\nphone again. The \" medium \" then replaced the trumpet in its\noriginal position and hid the drumstick and cloth.\n0.24 I stopped the gramophone, put on the red and white lights\nin turn, left them on for a minute, and said.\n\f124] The Psychology of Testimony 367\n0. 25 \" That's the end of the sitting, thank you. If you will now-\nkindly follow me into another room there is a sheet with a few\nquestions for you to answer.\" The sitters were accordingly shown\ninto Miss Newton's room, where they completed the questionnaire in\nsilence.\nThis questionnaire now follows, each question being followed by\nthe correct answer and, in round brackets, by the marks obtainable :\nQuestionnaire\n(Please answer the questions as exactly as possible, avoiding such\nphrases as \" about,\" \" approximately,\" etc.)\n1. Describe the position of your chair. [This varied from sitting\nto sitting ; the chairs were arranged in two rows, one behind the\nother, with 3-5 chairs in each row. A typical reply would be\n\" second from the left, back row.\"] (10).\n2. How many persons were in the seance-mom during the sitting ?\n[The correct answer ranges from seven to eleven.] (20 ; a mistake\nof one : 10).\n3. Early in the sitting there was a disturbance. Describe what\nhappened. There was a knock at the door (10), Th. B. went to the\ndoor (10), opened it (5) wide (5), went out (10), and returned to his\nseat (10), putting a white card in his pocket (30). Total (80).\n4. Give a list of the articles lying on the table at the beginning of\nthe sitting, in their order from left to right. Xylophone,1\nbell,\ndrumstick, zither, drumstick, tambourine, trumpet. (10 for each\narticle, if sufficiently described or drawn, plus 10 if it is given in its\ncorrect position. Total 140.)\n5. Early in the sitting the \" medium \" touched an article lying\non the table. What was the article ? The bell (10).\n6. With what hand did the \" medium \" touch it ? The right\nhand (10).\n7. What light was there at the time ? Medium (10) white light\n(10). Total (20).\n8. Was there silence at the time ? Yes (10).\n9. During the sitting a flashlight photograph of the \" medium \"\nwas taken. What interval of time had elapsed since the beginning\nof the sitting ? Nineteen minutes (for 18-20 minutes, 20 ; for\n16-22 minutes, 10 ; for a time such as 20-30 minutes, one member\nof which falls within 16-22 minutes, 5).\n10. State in full detail what you saw during the flash, in other\nwords, everything that will appear on the photograph. The\nmedium's face was covered with a white cloth (10) on which could be\nseen the marks of horizontal and vertical folding (10), as well as thick\n1\nThis object is so called, following the usual practice, although it has metal\nbars.\n\f:h;k Theodore Besterman [part\nblack markings forming the rudimentary (10) design of a face (10) in\nprofile (10). The objects on the table were as stated in reply to ques-\ntion 4, with the following exceptions : the bell (10) was in the position\nbehind the tambourine (10) to -which it had been moved earlier in the\nsitting (see question 5) ; the trumpet (10) was now held horizontally\n(5) in the medium's hand (5) ; and the second drumstick had vanished.\n(10). What seemed to be the head of this drumstick (10) appeared in\nthe opening of the curtains above the medium's head (20). Total (130).\n11. What light was there immediately before the flash ? Faint\n(10) red light (10), but no visibility (20). Total (40).\n12. What light was there immediately after the flash ? Faint (10)\nred light (10), but no visibility (20). Total (40).\n13. Was there silence at the time of the flash ? Yes (10).\n14. Give a list of the articles lying on the table at the end of the\nsitting, in their order from left to right. The same as in reply to\nquestion 4, except that the second drumstick was still missing. (As\nbefore, the second drumstick scoring 20 if reported as missing ;\nsitters who said \" The same as in reply to question 4,\" were given\nthe same marks as they obtained in the earlier question, so far as\nconsistent with the disappearance of the second dramstick ; total\n140.)\n15. Add anything you wish, especially particulars of any incidents\nor phenomena not mentioned in the above questions. (No addi-\ntional marks ;\ngrand total 680.)\nIt will be seen that the questionnaire combines the method of\ndirect questions with that of spontaneous narrative. The object of\nthis was partly to compare the two methods, but no significant\nresults were obtained, except in so far as the notion now generally\naccepted by psychologists that spontaneous narrative gives better\nresults than cross-examination was not supported by the results.\nIn particular, as I was anxious to give the sitter every possible\nadvantage, apart from testing the opinion just mentioned, I added\nQuestion 15 with a view to giving sitters full credit for any correct\ntestimony given in this way, supplementing or correcting previous\nanswers. But in the case of only one sitter was there any need to\ndo so. On the other hand, since the questions were all simple and\nstraightforward and related to actual facts or occurrences, there was\nlittle room for the free play of imagination, etc., in replying to them.\nIn this connection also Question 15 was of importance, for it was\nhere that most of the sitters' illusions came to light. We will return\nto these later.\nIt must be noted also that neither in the sitting nor in the ques-\ntions was any experiment made with such misleading suggestions as\nfraudulent physical mediums often know how to use. There was a\nsingle exception, my remark that all the objects on the table were\n\f124] The Psyihihjy jf Testimony 339\nluminous, which was not true of the two drumsticks. There is no\nclear evidence in the replies given that this false suggestion affected\nthe testimony. In any case, it must be remembered that all the\nobjects on the table were in full sight in medium white light for ten\nminutes at the beginning of the sitting, and also during the flash\nand for a minute in medium white light at the end of the sitting.\nFurther, partly because it was not found possible to get the lumino-\nsity of the articles on the table uniform from sitting to sitting and\nfrom the angle of vision of each sitter, no questions were asked\nrelating to anything that occurred hi the dark. Sitters who wanted\nto take notes were allowed to do so, but they were so few that no\ndistinctions have been made in the scoring and analysis.\nIt is only necessary to add at this point that the scoring was all\ndone with a definite bias in favour of the sitter, who was always\ngiven the benefit of the doubt. Thus, credit was given, though not,\nof course, full credit, if a reply implied even indirectly a correct\nanswer to another question. For instance, this was done if a sitter\ndid not mention the trumpet in reply to Question 4, but later said\n\" The medium took the trumpet from the table.\"\nThe method of scoring is far from perfect, but it is at any rate an\nimprovement on the usual method of psychologists in experiments\nof this kind. They treat replies simply as right or wrong : a method\nwhich fails to distinguish between the important and unimportant\nelements of an event. My method was of course worked out before\nthe answers of the questionnaire came into my hands.\nThe complete results are given in Table I, each sitter being given\na number in the alphabetical order of his name.\nIt will be seen from Table I that the sitters' testimony was correct\nin proportions ranging from 5-9% to 61%, averaging 33-9%. In\nother words, the 42 sitters as a whole gave correct testimony to the\nextent of only one-third. Only one sitter (no. 42, ranked seventh)\nobtained some success in reply to every question. Two sitters\n(nos. 4 and 6) secured marks in reply to only three questions. On\nthe other hand, there was only one point that every sitter failed to\nreport, though it transpired in conversation after the sittings that\nseveral had actually observed it. This was the drumstick-head over\nthe \" medium's \" head during the flash. The absence of references\nto this is all the more surprising since, as can be seen from the\nphotograph, it was brilliantly illuminated by the flash and was\nmissing from the table after it.\n\fTheodore Besterma n [part\no\nCI CO -t lO tfi 1^ X G\".

It will be seen that only seven sitters\nobtained more than half marks, and that fourteen sitters obtained\na quarter of the total marks or less. The sharp curve of the scores\nwhen set out in graphical form shows the wide range between the\nworst and best sitters ; while its smoothness strongly suggests the\nabsence of any mode, i.e. that there is no such thing as a typical\nsitter. It must be noted that the sitters who obtained the biggest\nscores, and therefore rank highest, are not necessarily the best\nsitters. This is because it was necessary under the circumstances\nto concentrate both the phenomena and the questions on the visual\naspects of the sitting, the most important in a sitting for para-\nphysical phenomena. The replies suggest that in an all round test\nsitter no. 7 might come into her own.\n\f124] The Psychology of Testimony 373\nTable I can be analysed, for our purpose, from two points of view,\nwith reference to the classes of sitters and with reference to the\ntypes of phenomena. Let us consider the latter first.\nThe replies to Question 1 obtained an average score of 8 (80%\nof full marks). The chief fault in the replies is lack of precision.\nThis is illustrated by such replies as \"In the centre \" (for the\nsecond of four chairs), \" In the front row,\" etc. On the whole the\nsitters were more successful with this question than with any other.\nQuestion 2 provided a surprise. Although the number of persons\nin the seance-room never exceeded eleven, the scores obtained\naverage only 14-6 (73%). Only twenty-six sitters answered\ncorrectly. Four gave no effective answer.

The complete scores are shown in\nTable III (p. 374).\nThis Table reveals some interesting points. Of the 42 sitters\n11 failed to give any account of the disturbance. The remaining\n31 report more or less accurately its earliest stage, the knock on the\ndoor. But of these 31 sitters five do not mention the fact that I\nwent to the door, 13 do not report the opening of the door, 21 do\nnot refer to my leaving the seance-room, and only four sitters report\nthe crucial point of the performance, the fact that I put something\ninto my pocket on returning. And in connection with these four\nsitters it is important to note a point that is not brought out by\nthe scoring. Two of these sitters attended the third sitting and\ntwo the sixth. On each occasion I noted that one sitter took pains\nto follow my actions, being observed in this, and imitated, by one\nother sitter. No sitter reports correctly what it was I put into my\npocket, though one gets very near it. The most unexpected result,\n\f374 Theodore Besterman [part\nhowever, is that no sitter reports the fact that I opened the door\nwide, although in doing so I admitted a good deal of additional light\ninto the seance-room. The highest marks for the question as a whole\nare obtained by nos. 12 and 29 (ranking 19th and 12th) with 60\nmarks (70%). The average score for all the sitters is 21-3, equi-\nvalent to 26-6% of the possible score of 80.\nTable III\nThe Answers to Question 3, omitting Sitters who gave no\nReply or who obtained no Marks.\nTotal\nIV HULK ill. x>. o po n s wide : goes returns putting T\"A \/'\\ CI i\npUbtol IJlt?\nNo. of at t^oes to it : out to card in marks : 80\nSitter. door : door : seat pocket\nTotal\nIK)\ni 1\nIU 0 5 IU 1 o\nIU OA obtained\n2 in xu p.\no 9^\n\u2022J 10\nXV\/ 10 90\n4 10\nI \\J Pi 10 OO\n7 10\nX \\J 10\n1 u\n8 10\n1 ' '\nn\no 1\nr>\nX O\nQ 1 ( )\ni y 10 K\n0 1 0\n1 u TO\nI u\n]()\nx \\j o 1 (\nXL*\nK\n0 90\n1 l\nx 1 ( 1 o\nIU ^O\nou\n1 9\nJ.

In\nthree cases, however, the sitter has been given five marks because\nhe indicates the bell with reasonable accuracy but describes it\ninadequately. Apart from these three sitters there are 18 correct\nanswers, while 21 sitters give wrong answers or fail to reply. The\naverage score is thus 4-6 (46%). Since the bell was moved in good\nlight and in full sight of the sitters, this result is poor. The pheno-\nmena dealt with in Questions 3 and 5 were arranged in such a way\nthat the sitters could witness both : the moving of the bell occupied\nonly the time it took me to turn the handle and begin to open the\ndoor. And in fact there is no significant correlation between failure\nin Question 3 and success in Question 5. Of the 11 persons who\ncompletely fail in replying to the former question eight also fail in\nthe latter. Of the 21 sitters who answer Question 5 more or less\ncorrectly, 18 also obtain some success in Question 3.\nA comparison of the replies to Question 5 with those to Question 6\nyields a surprising result. Of the 21 sitters who more or less accu-\nrately report the movements of the bell, only seven, or one-third,\nwere able to say with which hand the medium had moved it. On\nthe other hand, three sitters correctly report the hand, but fail in\nregard to the object moved. So that only 10 sitters were able to\ntestify correctly to a deliberate and pronounced movement of the\narm made in good light. The average score is 2-4 (24%).\nThe objects lying on the \" medium's \" table are dealt with in\nQuestions 4 and 14.

The biggest of them is the trumpet (when erect on the table),\nwhich obtains 64% of the possible marks ; the next biggest is the\ntambourine, and this comes second in the scoring also, with 56% ;\nthe two smallest objects, the drumsticks, obtained the lowest\nscores. The drawing of the sitters' special attention to the bell\nby the \" medium's \" movement of it also influenced the sitters'\nreports. Hence the bell, which would have been expected by size\nalone to rank after the xylophone and the zither, actually comes\nthird, with 47%. Finally, the position of the objects apparently\ninfluenced the reports. By size alone the xylophone and zither\nmight have been expected to obtain about the same score, and the\ntwo drumsticks (in Question 4 only) exactly the same score. Actually\nthe xylophone obtains 41% of the possible marks against the\nzither's 35%, while the first drumstick scores 25% against the 16%\nof the second one (in Question 4 only). Both these results illustrate\nthe tendency (in the Western world) to read from left to right.\n\f124] The Psychology of Testimony :!7<)\nA comparison of Tables IV and V does not yield much of interest.\nTwo tendencies might have been expected in the replies to Question\n14 as compared with those to Question 4 : on the one hand, improved\nresults owing to the further opportunities for observation and to\nthe fact, when answering the questionnaire, that the objects had\nbeen seen more recently in their final state ;\nand, on the other hand,\nworse results owing to fatigue. These two tendencies, if present,\nappear more or less to have cancelled each other out. Apart from\nthe second drumstick there is no significant difference between the\ntwo sets of replies. It will be seen that the absence of the second\ndrumstick at the eud of the sitting was reported by only five sitters.\nThe highest scores obtained by the replies to Question 4 are 135\n(96-4%) and 130 (92-9%), earned respectively by nos. 30 and 32\n(ranked 5th and 3rd). In Question 14 the highest scores are 130\n(92-9%) and 120 (85-8%), obtained respectively by nos. 32 and 26\n(ranked 3rd and 2nd). For both questions together the highest\nscores are 260 (92-9%), obtained by no. 32 (ranked 3rd), and 250\n(89%), obtained by no. 30 (ranked 5th).\nThere are three questions (7, 11 and 12) relating to the important\nmatter of visibility. These may conveniently be taken together.\nIn scoring the replies I have borne in mind that we are concerned\nhere with a problem in psychical research and not primarily with\none in psychology. Hence the greater emphasis laid on the report-\ning of the degree of visibility as against the actual amount of light.\nThe replies are set out in Table VII (p. 380).\nIt thus appears that only 16 sitters obtain marks in Question 7,\nof whom only two earn full marks. The figures improve consider-\nably for the much easier Question 11, in which such a reply as\n\" Complete darkness \" earns half the possible marks. Even here,\nhowever, the average score is only 17-7 out of 40 (44-2%). The\nreplies to Question 12 show, as was to be expected, that after the\nflash the conditions of light were less accurately reported ; in this\nquestion (though such a reply as \" The same as before \" earns the\nfull marks obtained in the previous question), only 23-7% of success\nwas obtained. It is interesting to note that of the three sitters who\nobtained full marks for Question 11, two were quite unsuccessful\nin Question 12. No sitter obtained full marks for all three ques-\ntions. The best reply, that is, the one most nearly approaching\naccuracy in all three questions, is that of no. 24 (ranked 20th). It\nwould have been interesting to investigate the direction in which\nsitters tend to err in reporting conditions of light, but this was\nimpossible in such a short sitting.\nConditions of hearing were tested by Questions 8 and 13.

The question relating to the\nperiod of silence of three seconds is more than twice as successfully\nanswered as that relating to the period of over three minutes.\nThe former period, it is true, was more sharply defined and the\nsitters were more definitely on the qui vive owing to the warning\ngiven just before. But the stopping of the gramophone was partly\nmasked by the sound of the flash, almost immediately after which\nthe music was started again. While the termination, at any rate,\nof the longer period, was also strongly marked by the simultan-\neous complete turning out of the lights. And in any case the\noutstanding fact is that the less successful period was 60 times\nlonger than the more successful one. It seems difficult to find an\nadequate explanation of the marked superiority of the replies to\nQuestion 13.\nIn Question 9 the sitters were asked what interval of time had\nelapsed between the beginning of the sitting and the flash. Both\npoints were very distinctly marked : the beginning by my statement\nthat the sitting had now begun, by the banging of the door, the\nswitching off of the wall light, and the starting of the gramophone ;\nthe end, of course, by the flash. Yet, the actual time being 19\nminutes, the replies obtained were as shown in Table IX.\nTable IX\nThe Answers to Question 9, omitting Sitters who gave no\nEffective Answer.\nNo. of\nSitter.\nAnswers in\nMinutes.\nNo. of\nSitter.\nAnswers in\nMinutes.\nNo. of\nSitter.\nAnswers in\nMinutes.\n1 10 15 25 + 30 15\n2 5 17 15 31 25\n3 15 18 15 33 8\n5 20 20 15 34 10\n6 15 21 20-30 36 15\n7 20-30 22 15-20 37 16 +\n8 15 24 10-15 38 15\n9 15 25 20 39 15\n11 30 26 20 40 20\n12 40 27 18-20 41 10\n13 25-30 28 7 42 20\n14 40 29 25-35\nThe average estimate of the 35 sitters who replied effectively is\n18-5 minutes, a close approximation to the correct time. But this\nclose approximation is not due to a general but small degree of\nerror. On the contrary, the average score obtained by all the\n\f124] The Psychology of Testimony 383\nsitters in reply to this question is 3-5, a percentage of only 17-5 of\nfull marks. In fact, the replies range from 5 to 40 minutes.\nThere is thus both a tendency greatly to underrate and greatly to\nexaggerate, these tendencies cancelling each other out. No sitter\ngave the correct time, but the reply of no. 27 (ranked 4th), who\ngave 18-20 minutes, is practically correct. This sitter was the only\none who hit upon the obvious method of calculating the passage\nof time by counting the number of times the gramophone record\nwas played. For the method of awarding marks, see the Question-\nnaire above. Full marks were obtained by only six sitters, even\nthough the nearest round figure, 20 minutes, fell into this period.\nContrary to expectation the most popular figure was easily 15\nminutes, and not the nearest round number. The ten marks given\nfor a reply falling within 16-22 minutes were earned by only one\nsitter.\nFinally, we have the sitters' reports (in reply to Question 10)\nof the scene photographed at the moment of the flash (see the\naccompanying plate). The replies are set out in Table X (p. 384).\nThe replies to this question are the worst of all. A fair number\nof sitters report the presence over the \" medium's \" face of a\nwhite cloth or paper ; a few also mention the marks of folding\non it ; but beyond this there is very little success. The presence of\na design on the cloth, the nature of that design, the changes on the\ntable, all these remain substantially unreported. The disappearance\nof the second drumstick from the table is reported by only one sitter,\nwhile the presence of the head of this drumstick in the curtain over\nthe \" medium's \" head is not mentioned by a single one. Yet it\nformed a brilliant circular white disc, 21 mm. in diameter (see\nphotograph). It must also be remembered that the flash was not\nmade unexpectedly : two warnings were given and the sitters were\nparticularly asked to observe carefully during the flash. Further,\nthe flash itself was of longer duration and brighter than is usual in\nnormal photographic work.

Salter\nGeorge Valiantine is held by those who accept his phenomena as\ngenuine to be a remarkable example of \" direct voice \" or trumpet\nmediumship. It is claimed that in the presence of certain specially\nendowed persons, of whom Valiantine is one, communicating spirits\nare able to speak in their own recognisable voices ; the power\nwhereby they do this is derived from the medium, but his vocal\norgans are not brought into play ; the voice we hear is the voice of\nthe spirit. The purpose of the trumpet which usually figures in\nrecords of this phenomenon is to increase the power of these spirit-\nvoices, which might otherwise be inaudible.\nI do not propose to discuss the evidence for the \" direct voice\n\"\nin a general way ; I will only mention that this particular pheno-\nmenon appears to have become much more frequent in recent years,\nalthough a claim for its occurrence was made at least as far back as\n1872 in the case of Stainton Moses.\nTurning now to Valiantine\u2014we may consider his mediumship in\ntwo aspects, physical and mental ; on the physical side is it possible\nto substantiate his claim to supernormal powers as shown by direct\nvoices and telekinetic movements of the trumpet, which is said to be\nwafted about the room without any human agency ; on the mental\nside is there anything in the content of the words uttered by the\nspirit-voices which seems to give evidence of knowledge supernor-\nmally acquired ? It will not always be convenient to keep these two\nthreads absolutely distinct, but so far as possible I propose to dis-\nentangle them and to consider the physical aspect first.\nI should perhaps at this point meet the possible objection that in\ndevoting time and attention to a medium whom some may think to\nbe so thoroughly discredited as Valiantine, I am beating a dead horse,\nwhich in one of the famous Margery-Valiantine cross-correspondences\nwe are told that no one ever stops to do. To that objection I have\ntwo answers to make :\n(1) even those who are ready to dismiss all\nValiantine's claims to genuine mediumship may derive pleasure and\nprofit, as I have done myself, from a study of the psychological\naspects of the case ; (2) the discrediting of Valiantine is by no means\ncomplete. In a review of Mr Dennis Bradley's book And After in\nthe Times Literary Supplement (22 October 1931, p. 815) the writer,\nwhile accepting Mr Bradley's \" conclusive demonstration \" of fraud,\n1\nRead at a Private Meeting of the Society, 30 December 1931.\n2d 389\n\f390 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nspeaks of the \" evidence of Valiantine's supernormal faculties which,\nno sceptic, as it seems to us, can reasonably call in question.\" The\nreviewer's identity is unknown to me, but the Literary Supplement\nis a paper of good standing, in no way pledged to a belief in psychical\nphenomena ;\nmany readers will therefore be inclined to accept its\nverdict as justifying them in the conclusion that Valiantine is still\namong the great mediums of the day.\nI do not claim to have made an exhaustive study of the records of\nValiantine's mediumship ; he appears to have been well known for\nsome years in America (his native land) before he came much to the\nnotice of any one in this country. The earliest record I propose to\nquote is of some test-sittings which took place in 1923 under the\nauspices of The Scientific American. The persons responsible for the\nconduct of these sittings were Dr Walter Prince, Dr Hereward Car-\nrington, and the famous conjurer Houdini, Mr Malcolm Bird, then\nof the Scientific American and afterwards of the American Society\nfor Psychical Research, being associated with them. I have not seen\nthe full report published in The Scientific American, but the following\nabstract appeared in the Journal of the A.S.P.R. (1923), xvii. 586 :\n\" In the columns of the magazine which had the tests in charge a\nfull account of the results may be found, and only the briefest sum-\nmary is necessary here. At the final sitting on May 26th, special\napparatus were installed. There was an electrical connection with\nthe chair in which the medium sat, so arranged that it ceased the\nmoment his body was lifted from it, whereupon a light in an ad-\njoining room went out. There was also a dictograph, and steno-\ngraphers in the adjoining room took down all that was uttered and\nalso established the relation in point of time between the acts of the\nsupposed spirits and the periods when the lights vanished. It was\ndetermined that the medium left his chair fifteen times, sometimes\nfor as long as eighteen seconds, and that these periods corresponded\nwith those when persons present were touched at a distance from the\nchair. The subsequent claim of the medium that it was the shifting\nof his body in the chair which caused the light to go out will be seen\nto be ludicrous by anyone who will try shifting in such a manner as\nto relieve the chair of his weight for eighteen seconds by the watch.\"\nIt is clear from this statement that there was in the opinion of\nthese investigators a strong presumption at least of fraud, and a\npoint to which I wish specially to call attention is that it is not\npossible to maintain, as Mr Bradley tries to do, that Valiantine pur-\nsued a path of strict, blameless rectitude for many years and has only\nrecently been led astray by the excessive adulation and generosity\nof his supporters. As long ago as 1923, perhaps longer, Valiantine's\nphenomena were suspect and they have been suspect on more than\none occasion since.\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 391\nIt was in the same year, 1923, that Mr Bradley, still one of the\nprincipal witnesses for the defence of Valiantine in spite of his own\nrecent disclosures, had his first sitting at the house of Mr De Wyckoff\nArlena Towers, New Jersey. If any of my readers are inclined to\nthink that in anything I say here I am a little hard on Mr Bradley,\nI would remind them that he has not minced his own words. He has\npublicly accused the Officers of this Society of every sort and kind\nof crass incompetence, and that after all is a game that two can play\nat ! Of the personal evidence Mr Bradley believes himself to have\nobtained through Valiantine I shall not say much, partly because it\nis so inadequately recorded that its value cannot be properly esti-\nmated, but I will refer briefly to a passage from the report of his first\nsitting (Toivards the Stars, p. 8) for the light it throws on Mr Bradley's\nmentality and his claim to be a critical observer. After describing\nhow he came to attend the sitting at Mr De Wyckoff's invitation, and\nemphasising his own scepticism in regard to anything that was likely\nto occur, he tells us that a woman's voice addressed him, saying, \" I\nlove you I, love you \" ; this voice gave the name Annie and claimed\nto be his sister. Upon this evidence Mr Bradley at once accepted the\ncommunicator's identity, and a long and intimate conversation\nfollowed, of which no details are given.\nNow this was Mr Bradley's first contact with the medium and it\nshould therefore have been obvious to any competent investigator\nthat it was essential to record accurately everything that was said\non either side. And yet what do we find % Mr Bradley had fifteen\nminutes' conversation with a voice claiming to be his sister, and all\nhe tells us of what took place is that the conversation was of things\nwhich only these two could have known and they were \" things of\nwondrous joy.\" How completely Mr Bradley gave himself away in\nthat fifteen minutes is left to our imagination and a sceptic can\nhardly be blamed if he suspects the worst. We may also note that\nalthough Mr Bradley subsequently tells us that his sister had a dis-\ntinctive voice and manner of speech which were accurately repro-\nduced at the sitting, he did not recognise the voice until the name\nAnnie was given ; he searched his memory and \" could find no clue.\"\nMr Bradley's identification of the voice would have been more im-\npressive if it had been immediate.\nThe resemblance of the voices heard at Valiantine' s sittings to\nthose of the communicators purporting to be present is a point often\ninsisted on by Mr Bradley and others. I think it likely that an im-\nportant part is played here by suggestion, helped out by the distor-\ntion and indistinctness of utterance consequent on the use of a\ntrumpet, and I am strengthened in this belief by the ^observation of\ntwo experienced investigators, Una, Lady Troubridge and Miss\nKadclyffe Hall (see below, p. 407).\n\f392 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nA few months after this series of sittings at Arlena Towers Vali-\nantine seems to have been detected in fraud by Mr De Wyckoff him-\nself. An account of this episode is given in Toivards the Stars, p. Ill :\nValiantine brought Mr De Wyckoff some notes alleged to be the\n\" direct writing \" of Bert Everett and Dr Barnett, two of his habitual\nControls, and relating to a suggested visit by Valiantine and Mr De\nWyckoff to Guiana. These notes were submitted to a handwriting\nexpert together with a specimen of Valiantine's own writing, and he\npronounced them to be by Valiantine's own hand. Valiantine denied\nthis accusation and Mr De Wyckoff said he would give him another\nchance. A test-sitting was held at Arlena Towers at which Valian-\ntine was tied up with a rope ; no phenomena occurred. Mr Bradley\ndismisses this episode as of no importance, but the reasons for this\nseem to lie in his own prejudice rather than in the facts of the case.\nIn the following year, 1924, Valiantine came to England and gave\na series of sittings at Mr Bradley's house, Dorincourt. Various\nmembers of Mr Bradley's family and a number of his friends took\npart in these sittings, which he describes in Toivards the Stars. Little\nor no attempt was made to impose any control on the medium and\nthe records are again inadequate. I shall not therefore discuss them,\nexcept for one curious episode of which I shall have something to say\nlater.\nIn 1925 Valiantine was again in England and the Society tried to\narrange for a series of test-sittings in our own seance-room. This\nplan fell through largely owing to the attitude taken up by Mr\nBradley (for an account see Dr Woolley's report in Proceedings,\nxxxvi. 52, 53). A few sittings, however, were held at Dorincourt at\nwhich representatives of the Society were present. These sittings\nare described by Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall in Pro-\nceedings, xxxvi, and I shall discuss their report later. For the\nmoment it will be convenient to turn to a series of sittings held in\n1929 in Berlin. I take these German sittings out of their order in\ntime because I want to refer to some observations made at Berlin in\ndiscussing a point raised by Lady Troubridge.\nThe report of the Berlin investigations is not to my mind very\nsatisfactory or conclusive (I can well imagine that the investigators\nlaboured under many difficulties), but it includes a number of obser-\nvations which are very suggestive if we consider them in conjunction\nwith observations made elsewhere. The report will be found printed\nin the Zeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie (1929), lvi, under the title\n\" Valiantines Entlarvung,\" by Dr Walther Kroner. With regard to\nthe question of controlling the medium it is noted (p. 595) that a\nsuggestion was made that Valiantine should wear luminous bands\non his wrists. He objected on the ground that if he wore bands, all\nthe sitters must wear them also and then there would be too much\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 393\nlight. Mr Bradley in his report on the first sittings he had with\nValiantine at Arlena Towers mentions (Towards the Stars, p. 7) that\nValiantine wore luminous bands ; he makes, however, no statement\nas to how they were attached. This point is of importance, for if they\nwere detachable by Valiantine during the sitting, so far from being\nhelpful, they might actually confuse the issue, by producing in the\nminds of the sitters the illusion that the medium's hands were on his\nknees, when in point of fact one hand at least was free to move about\nin the dark and handle a trumpet.\nThe trumpet used at Berlin was of the type habitually employed\nat sittings with Valiantine, a metal trumpet in three sections painted\nwith a luminous band at the broad end. Scattered through the\nreport are a number of observations strongly suggesting that Vali-\nantine had at his disposal a non-luminous trumpet. For instance\n(p. 603), Frau Kroner, sitting on the medium's left, raised her foot\nin front of her (an action by the way which is strictly forbidden to\nValiantine's sitters) and felt \" a metallic object \" apparently held in\nthe medium's hand. Baroness von P. (p. 650) was touched by a hard\nobject on her knee. She put out her hand and touched something\nwhich seemed to be of hollow tin and gave out a metallic sound ; she\ncalled out that it must be the trumpet. The ostensible trumpet\n(with a luminous band) had, however, remained motionless in the\nmiddle of the circle. Baroness von P. is positive there was a second\ntrumpet.\nFrau von Dirksen, who was Valiantine's hostess in Berlin, and\nappears at the outset to have been well-disposed towards him, had\na private sitting at which she alone was present. This sitting was\nheld as usual in darkness, but Frau von Dirksen alleges that there\nwas a little light coming through a crack in the door, and against this\nlight she saw Valiantine lean forward to speak into the trumpet\nstanding on the floor, that is, the usual seance-trumpet with a lumi-\nnous band at the broad end. She also saw, she asserts, a second\n(non-luminous) trumpet, silhouetted against the light, and this\ntrumpet was raised or lowered according as the voice of the Control\nseemed to come from the floor or the ceiling (p. 604.)\nAnother sitter, Dr Quade, notes (p. 654) that at the first sitting he\nhad with Valiantine on 2 May 1929 he painted the trumpet with\nluminous paint at its narrow end round the mouth-piece, and on this\noccasion the usual sweeping movements of the trumpet did not\noccur. At his second sitting on 11 May 1929 the luminous ring round\nthe mouth-piece had faded and movements of the trumpet did occur.\nIt is interesting to observe what Mr Bradley has to say about Dr\nQuade's report. Mr Bradley is exceedingly angry with anyone who\nprofesses to have exposed Valiantine before he himself exposed him,\nand he pours the vials of his wrath and contempt on all the Berlin\n\f394 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\ncircle except Dr Quade, of whom he speaks more kindly. He asserts\n(And After, p. 166) that Dr Quade refrained \" from making any alle-\ngations of fraud whatever against Valiantine \" and supports this\nstatement by an alleged quotation from Dr Quade's report, as\nfollows :\n\" By my placing a luminous ring on the small end of the\ntrumpet one should have been able to observe a hand touching that\nportion of the instrument. The darkening of this luminous band by\nthe touching of a hand was not observed during the sitting, although\nthe trumpet was wafted round in a very wide circle.\"\nThis is what Dr Quade actually says :\n\" As a result of this upper\nband of luminous paint it must have been observable if a hand had\ngrasped the top of the trumpet. The darkening of this band by the\ninterposition of a hand did not occur at the sitting, but neither did\nthe widely sweeping movements of the trumpet, which were habitual\nat other sittings and in the absolute darkness of the room might be\nfraudulently produced by someone seizing the trumpet, and turning\nand moving it about.\" 1\nI present this to my readers as an example of Mr Bradley's accur-\nacy of mind and consequent reliability as a witness.\nSo far as I have been able to discover, this sitting in Berlin was the\nonly occasion when the trumpet was painted at the mouth-piece ; Mr\nBradley records several occasions when it was painted for a certain\ndistance up one side, but not within nine or ten inches of the top.\nDr Hans Driesch (p. 653) comments on the fact that at the sitting\nhe attended the trumpet had a luminous ring only at the wide end ;\nthe addition of a luminous ring at the mouth-piece was refused. He\nsuggests that Valiantine may have detached the upper non-luminous\nsections of the trumpet and used them to speak through, leaving the\nlower luminous section standing on the floor, where it would be\nvisible to the sitters and produce an illusion that the trumpet had\nnot moved from its place. I have never myself had an opportunity\nof handling Valiantine's trumpets, but on p. 93 of And After I came\nupon a statement which seems to imply that they are so constructed\nthat the upper sections are easily detachable from the lower sections.\nThis statement occurs in some observations by Mr C. V. L. Hooman,\na believer in the genuineness of Valiantine's phenomena. He re-\nmarks :\n\" Several times during the sitting the spirits, when replacing\nthe trumpets, seemed to lose control, with the result the trumpets\nfell over, the upper movable ends becoming detached.\"\n1\nZ. f. Paraps. lvi. 655 :\n\" Infolge der Anbringung des oberen Leuckt-\nstreifens katte man bemerken miissen, wenn dei Trompete an der Spitze von\neiner Hand angefasst worden ware. Eine Verdunkelung durch eine Hand\nerfolgte in der Sitzung nicht, aber aucb nickt die weit auskolenden Bewegungen\nder Trompete, die bei anderen Sitzungen die Regel waren und kiinstlick in dem\nvollkommen dunklen Raum dadurck ausgefiikrt werden kormten, dass jemand\ndie Trompete ergriff and drekend kerumfLikrte.\"\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 395\nI had occasion to write to Dr Driesch about these German sittings\nand in his reply he remarked : \"It was the greatest swindle I have\never seen. All those who were present at this seance (and twelve\nothers) were of the same opinion\u2014even convinced spiritualists.\"\nIn this same year, 1929, some sittings were held in Italy at the house\nof the Marquis Centurione Scotto. The Marquis is himself alleged to\nbe a powerful medium. An account of his mediumship was given by\nMrs Kelley Hack in Modern Psychic Mysteries, Millesimo Castle,\nItaly, and a review of this book was printed on our Journal, xxvi.\n10 ff. These Italian sittings with Valiantine are described by Mr\nBradley in And After.\nAt one of them which took place on 18 May 1929 {op. cit., p. 179)\nspecial test-conditions were imposed ; Valiantine was bound to his\nchair and the sitters were tied to one another. On p. 190 appears an\naccount by Signor Bozzano, who was responsible for the tying, of\nthe method used. His report does not seem to me satisfactory, it\nleaves several important questions unanswered ; but the point I\nwish to make here is that the tying together of the sitters could\ncertainly have been made nugatory by collusion between any two of\nthem, and probably by mala fides on the part of any one sitter. In\nthese circumstances it is essential that we should know who all the\nsitters were, but no complete list is given. According to Signor\nBozzano's report the various cords by which Valiantine was tied\nwere found unbroken at the end of the sitting.\nAnother sitting was held next day, also \" under complete control ;\n\"\nwe are not told in detail what the conditions of control were on this\noccasion, but are left to assume that they were similar to the con-\nditions obtaining at the earlier sitting. At the end of this second\nsitting \" it was found that the cords [that is the cords binding the\nmedium] with the exception of those round Valiantine's left leg had\nbeen rent,\" ostensibly by the spirits.\nOnly a few days later one of these Italian investigators, Signor\nRossi, alleged that he \" had placed his hand on the back of Valian-\ntine's right arm and shoulder, and found that Valiantine was leaning\nforward \" to speak into the trumpet (p. 187), and at the same time\nwhat was tantamount to an accusation of fraud was brought by one\nof this group of sitters against another, when Dr Castellani alleged\nthat he had caught hold of Mrs Bradley's hand which was touching\nhis head. I am not concerned here with the truth of Dr Castellani's\nimputations, but if sitters begin to question one another's integrity,\nthey cannot wonder at other people's questioning. Incidentally this\nis not the first time that an accusation of fraud has been brought\nagainst a sitter in Mr Bradley's circle. In 1924 a sitting at which\nValiantine was not present took place at the house of some friends\nof Mr Bradley's ; the circle consisted of nine persons, including Mr\n\f396 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nand Mrs Bradley. The trumpet was wafted about in the usual way\nand two days later one of the sitters alleged that she had put out her\nhand in the darkness and had felt another hand holding the end of\nthe trumpet. The only moral to be drawn from such incidents is that\ninvestigations of this kind, if they are to serve any useful purpose,\nmust be carried out by a carefully constituted group of investigators\nwho trust each other and whom the public is likely to trust ; the\nsittings should be so conducted that the validity of the conclusions\ndoes not depend on the good faith of any one sitter. It is fatal to give\nany reasonable grounds for the question : quis custodiet ipsos cus-\ntodes ?\nI turn now to the report published in vol. xxxvi of our Proceedings\nby Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall. The sittings in\nquestion took place at Dorincourt in the presence of Mr and Mrs\nBradley, and Lady Troubridge comments on the fact that no attempt\nwas made to control the medium in any way, which makes it difficult\nto estimate the phenomena ; she suggests, however, that Valiantine\n\" did on several occasions speak from his chair so immediately after\na voice had spoken through a trumpet or at the other side of the\ncircle or high up in the far corner of the room, as in our opinion to\npreclude the possibility of his having spoken in these positions and\nregained his chair,\" and she thinks that \" the total phenomena pro-\nduced at this sitting were beyond what could have been obtained by\nthe fraudulent efforts of the medium unaided by any accomplice\n\"\n(pp. 55, 56). I doubt myself whether the difficulty of producing such\nphenomena as Lady Troubridge describes without the help of an\naccomplice is as great as she suggests. It appears from a later state-\nment in her report (p. 57) that many of the voices heard did not\nostensibly use a trumpet. There were two trumpets available at the\nsittings, both in three sections, and one having no illumination\nbeyond a band at its broad end. Has Lady Troubridge sufficiently\ntaken into account the possibility raised at the German sittings that\nValiantine was using the upper sections of one of the trumpets with-\nout the knowledge of the sitters ? I think in this way, with the help\nperhaps of some knowledge of the art of misdirection, he might\nproduce the illusion of a voice speaking at some distance from himself.\nThe question of an accomplice is not one I can usefully discuss,\nbut the following comment is, I think, permissible. Mr and Mrs\nBradley\u2014according to Mr Bradley's own report\u2014have obtained\nvery remarkable \" direct-voice \" phenomena by the power of their\nown joint mediumship. Either these phenomena are genuine, or\nthey are not. If they are not, the question as to a possible accom-\nplice is answered ; if they are genuine, then obviously Mr and Mrs\nBradley are not suitable people to take part in sittings designed to\ntest the powers of another medium for physical phenomena ; it is a\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 397\ncase of \" too many cooks.\" The same objection applies to sittings\nwhich took place in the presence of the Marquis Centurione Scotto.\nLady Troubridge and Miss Eadclyffe Hall also describe a daylight\nsitting they had with Valiantine at Dorincourt. The procedure on\nthis occasion was that Valiantine sat with his back to the window\nholding a trumpet in his hands, the broad end towards himself ; the\nsitter sat facing him and held the narrow end of the trumpet to her\near. The phenomena consisted in small taps on or in the trumpet\nand a whispering voice. The taps were heard by both sitters simul-\ntaneously, the voices were only heard by one or other of them sitting\nalone, a suggestive circumstance. 1\nBoth Lady Troubridge and Miss\nRadclyffe Hall record the fact that they heard a voice at a time when\nthey could see the medium's face and could detect no movement of\nhis lips ; it is evident, however, from what they say that the speech\nwas often indistinct, and it does not seem at all certain that with\npractice a man might not produce all the effects they observed with-\nout any movement of the face that would be apparent to a single\nsitter partly occupied in listening to the sound of the voice.\nTwo interesting questions are raised by Lady Troubridge in her\nfinal comments :\n\" The first point is why, in view of the fact that at\nthe dark seances the trumpets are used with the wide end towards\nthe sitter's ear and the narrow or mouthpiece end towards the\nsupposed communicators, the reverse should be the case at the day-\nlight sittings ? . . .\n\" The second point is : In view of the fact that we were told it\nwas important to concentrate darkness within the trumpet, why does\nMr Valiantine sit so that the wide end of the trumpet\u2014the least easy\nto cover\u2014should be towards the strong light of the window ? . . .\nAlso the wide end of the trumpet being towards the medium tends\nto collect extraneous sounds such as the movements of the medium,\nrustling of his clothes.\"\nOne might also add that it would collect the medium's extraneous\nutterances, should he make any, and direct them to the sitter's ear.\nThat the medium sat with his back to the window (the day we are\ntold was sunny) must have made observation of his face more\ndifficult.\nThis report by Lady Troubridge and Miss Eadclyffe Hall, which is\nrefreshingly free from the obscurity and superficiality of most\nreports on Valiantine, is the nearest approach I have found to\nevidence for his possession of supernormal physical powers, and I\nam sure the writers would be the first to admit that it does not give\n1\nDr Woolley and Mr E. J. Dingwall, each of whom has had a daylight sitting\nwith Valiantine, agree that it is impossible for a sitter with his ear to the\ntrumpet to keep a continuous and close watch on the medium's face. And see\nalso the observations made by Lord Charles Hope, p. 416.\n\f398 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nus much to weight in the balance against a heavy presumption of\nfraud.\nI have mentioned that a curious episode occurred at the sittings\nheld at Dorincourt in 1924. Before turning to Valiantine's final\nexposure by Mr Bradley I will briefly describe this episode, which\ntook place on 3 February 1924 and is described in Towards the Stars.\nIt happened that contrary to instructions a strong light was turned\non in the garage-yard during the seance and some light \" came\nthrough the windows over the top of the curtains, and in sufficient\nquantity for one to see dimly the faces of the sitters.\" A trumpet\nwas seen in the air \" without visible means of support,\" but as it fell\nto the ground at the moment the light came on it is obvious that there\nmay have been some support which the sitters did not have time to\nsee. Valiantine appeared to be distressed and complained of his\nstomach ; after about ten minutes Mr De Wyckoff got up to turn on\nthe light, when the voice of Bert Everett was heard in great agitation\nasking him not to do this.\n\" De Wyckoff went to Valiantine's assistance and said that Valian-\ntine was enveloped in a whitish sort of film. Mr Caradoc Evans then\ncrossed over and later described this substance as a slimy, frothy\nbladder '\ninto which you could dig your finger but through which\nyou could not pierce.' I felt the face and hands, and they were dead\ncold.\"\nAfter sitting in the dark for another half-hour Valiantine appar-\nently recovered sufficiently to be put to bed. There he remained\nnext day and a doctor was called in. On the following day \" with\nthe exception of a black bruise on his stomach, measuring about\ntwo inches by three\u2014evidently caused by the shock of the returning\nectoplasm\u2014he was quite well.\"\nIn the absence of any further evidence this incident is likely to\nremain unexplained. Mr Bradley himself, who accepts the ecto-\nplasmic theory in general, and at that time accepted Valiantine's\nbona fides without reserve, has no difficulty in explaining it ; but I\ndo not find myself able to follow Mr Bradley. Even if we assume\nthat some persons have a faculty of extruding ectoplasm from their\nbodies, we have, so far as I can see, no adequate ground for supposing\nthat Valiantine possesses this faculty. The convenient hypothesis\nthat if one supernormal phenomenon occurs in a medium's presence,\nevery other kind of supernormal phenomenon may occur, and the\nless likely a thing is to happen the better reason for believing it did,\nis one I do not find myself able to accept. It is true that there is talk\nnow and again of materialised spirit-hands at Valiantine's sittings,\nbut so far as I have been able to ascertain, no adequate steps were\never taken to prove that they were not his own. Frau von Dirksen\n(Z. \/. Paraps. lvi. 605) states that at her private sitting, to which\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 399\nreference lias already been made, she saw what was alleged to be a\nmaterialised hand about a yard away. Owing to the light coming\nthrough the crack in the door she could see the sleeve of Valiantine's\ncoat attached to this hand. She describes this episode as a piece of\n\" shameless \" trickery.\nIf we assume, as on the evidence of Valiantine's frequent recourse\nto trickery I think we are bound to assume, that at the moment when\nthe garage light was so inconveniently turned on, he was trying to\ndeceive his sitters, just what was he \" up to \"? The \" whitish sort\nof film \" in which he appeared to be enveloped may have been an\nillusion. As I noticed myself in the sittings I had with Eva C, in\nalmost complete darkness curious illusions of luminosity do occur,\nespecially when the eyes become fatigued. But what of the frothy\nbladder 1 What part was this destined to play ? What would the\nsitters have seen if Mr De Wyckoff had not been dissuaded by Bert\nEverett from turning on the light ? Was the bruise on Valiantine's\nstomach genuine, and, if so, what caused it ? These questions must,\nas the evidence stands at present, remain unanswered.\nI now turn to the evidence of fraud obtained by Mr Bradley against\nVaUantine in 1931. I do not propose to describe this evidence in\nfull ; it should be studied in Mr Bradley's own detailed and docu-\nmented report {And After, p. 287 ff.). Briefly, it was shown beyond\nany reasonable doubt that at a series of sittings held at Dorincourt\nValiantine had made use of various parts of his own body, fingers,\ntoes and elbow-joint, to produce on wax and on smoked paper im-\nprints of what were alleged to be spirit-hands. But there is one point\nin connection with this evidence which is worth careful consideration\nMr Bradley, who is deeply committed to a belief in the genuineness\nof Valiantine's earlier phenomena and especially the genuineness of\nthe \" spirit-voices,\" is much concerned to dissociate these voices so\nfar as he possibly can from phenomena which he admits to be fraudu-\nlent. The shifts and evasions to which this attempt reduces him\nillustrate the troubles which beset a man who prides himself on his\nhonesty, when he refuses to face an unpalatable truth.\nThe truth of the matter is that Valiantine's spirit-voices committed\nthemselves to the genuineness of Valiantine's spirit-imprints time\nand time again. The evidence for this is worth giving in some detail,\nas it has an important bearing on our final estimate of Valiantine's\nmediumship.\nAt the sitting of 20 February 1931, the first of the finger-print\nseries, the following voices took part : Dr Barnett, one of Valiantine's\nregular controls ;\nHoney, the spirit-guide of another medium, Mrs\nBarkell ; Conan Doyle, who said, \" I am trying to give an imprint \"\n;\nGeorge Gregory, a friend who had \" manifested \" at one of Mr\nBradley's private sittings when Valiantine was not present ; Dan\n\f400 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nBradley, Mr Bradley's father, of whom he says on this occasion, \" His\n'\nvoice '\nwas characteristic and recognisable.\" At this sitting two\nimprints on smoked paper were obtained, one of which was after-\nwards found to be the imprint of Valiantine's big toe.\nAt the sitting of 21 February Conan Doyle was again said to be\ntrying to get an imprint through ; Mr Jaquin, a sitter who played\na very important part in obtaining proof of fraud, said, \" Sir Arthur,\nwould you try to give an imprint of your index finger instead of a\nthumb %\n\" To this the \" Doyle \" voice replied, \" I will try to do so.\"\nAnother imprint was obtained at this sitting, which also proved to\nbe made by Valiantine's right great toe.\nAt the sitting of 22 February only Mr and Mrs Bradley and\nValiantine were present, and the voices were extremely fluent. Dr\nBarnett asked that the modelling wax should be made softer. He\nwas questioned concerning a little blood which Valiantine had\nbrought up in a fit of coughing after the sitting of 21 February, and\nsaid that the blood had been used for making the imprints and had\nnot been completely re-absorbed into the medium's body. He was\nalso asked why Valiantine had sweated freely during the sittings of\n20 and 21 February and said that the medium's sweat-glands had been\nused to make the imprints. The \" late Lord Dewar \" spoke in a faint\nwhisper and said he had \" tried to get his index-finger on the wax.\"\nAt the sitting of 23 February \" Lord Dewar \" again spoke in a\nwhisper. On this occasion two imprints were obtained on smoked\npaper and one on wax. After the sitting impressions were taken of\nthe big toes of all present. A similarity was observed between the\nimprints obtained at the sitting and the imprints of Valiantine's left\nbig toe. In the case of one of these imprints the identification is\nconfirmed by ex-Chief Inspector Bell, of the Finger-Print Depart-\nment, Scotland Yard.\nAt the sitting of 25 February several members of the Doyle family\nwere present and Conan Doyle was alleged to communicate. These\ncommunications appear to be accepted as genuine by the family.\nThree imprints were obtained, two of papillary ridges (which have\nnot been traced), and one apparently of an elbow-joint.\nFor the sitting of 27 February some special wax had been prepared\nimpregnated with methylene green (a fact unknown to Valiantine).\nAt the beginning of the sitting Valiantine as usual said the Lord's\nPrayer, upon which Mr Bradley comments that \" in view of what\ntranspired this seemed a somewhat ironic procedure.\" On another\noccasion when a fraudulent medium, to whose bona fides Mr Bradley\nwas in no way committed, did exactly the same thing, he calls it \" a\nnauseating blasphemy.\"\nMr Bradley, wishing, as I have said, to dissociate voices and fraud,\ncomments on the fact that at this sitting very few voices were heard\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 401\nand the sitting seemed \" dead.\" That things did not \" go with a\nswing \" on this occasion seems to me amply accounted for by the\nfact that Valiantine had been made aware of an atmosphere of sus-\npicion (although the sitters did their best to reassure him) and was\nprobably nervous. But the voices were not entirely silent. \" Pat\nO'Brien,\" being asked whether spirits could see in the dark replied,\n\" To be sure, or how could they see to give imprints \\\n\" The voice\nof Bert Everett asserted that the imprint obtained that day was that\nof the late Sir Henry Segrave. \" Abraham Wallace \" also said a few\nwords.\nAt the conclusion of the sitting two imprints were found on smoked\npaper and one on the special wax. The imprints on paper are almost\ncertainly identifiable with the right side of the middle finger of\nValiantine's left hand. The imprint on wax was apparently of an\nelbow-joint. Valiantine was stripped then and there and a strain of\nmethylene green was found on his left elbow-joint.\nFinally it is worth noting that the production of these fraudulent\nimprints was not confined to the particular sittings which Mr\nBradley reports. At a sitting held a month or so earlier at the house\nof a certain \" Mr X \" an imprint was obtained which was alleged to\nbe that of Walter Stinson, Margery's Control. This imprint was\nidentified with the middle finger of Valiantine's left hand. Moreover\nin 1925 some imprints were obtained at Mr Bradley's house, which in\nthe light of subsequent discoveries are highly suspect. These will be\nfound discussed in The Wisdom of the Gods.\nNow it seems to me established beyond all possible denial that in\nthese sittings of 1931 Valiantine's spirit-voices committed themselves\nirretrievably to the production of fraudulent phenomena. But some\nof these voices, Dr Barnett's, for instance, and Bert Everett's, have\nplayed a leading part in Valiantine's mediumship for many years,\nand taken as a whole these later manifestations, associated with\nfraud, differ in degree perhaps, but not in kind from the earlier mani-\nfestations in which Mr Bradley still asks us to believe. Moreover,\nas I have shown, suspicious circumstances have again and again been\nobserved at Valiantine's sittings, and we have reason to believe that\nat least as far back as 1923 he was resorting to fraudulent practices.\nThat being so, and taking into account the very unsatisfactory con-\nditions which habitually obtain at his sittings, we are bound to con-\nclude that the whole of Valiantine's mediumship in its physical aspect\nis suspect, and his claims to supernormal physical powers unproven.\nThere remains only one hope for Valiantine ; it might be possible to\nestablish that the content of these spirit-messages was supernormal,\nin other words, that Valiantine possesses genuine mental powers of a\nsupernormal order, which he habitually ekes out by physical fraud.\nTo the mental aspect of his mediumship I will therefore turn.\n\f402 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nOne of the most remarkable of the mental phenomena alleged to\noccur at sittings with Valiantine is \" speaking with tongues \" ; it is\nsaid that the spirit-voices converse fluently in a great number of\nlanguages with which Valiantine himself is quite unacquainted.\nAmong the languages cited are French, German, Italian, including\na Sicilian dialect, Spanish, Basque, Portuguese, Welsh, Russian,\nHindustani, Arabic, Japanese, and last, but not least, \" archaic-\nChinese,\" the communicating spirit in this case being Confucius him-\nself. For this remarkable linguistic range there appears at first sight\nto be a great wealth of testimony, but on a closer inspection this\nwealth dwindles to a few poor farthings, and these, I suspect, are\nbrass.\nWhen I was reviewing the available evidence one point which\nstruck me as curious was that there is a much better prima facie case\nfor knowledge of such a remote language as ancient Chinese\u2014as to\nwhich not above two or three of all the people who have ever sat with\nValiantine are capable of forming an independent judgment\u2014than\nfor such widely known languages as French and German, and it would\nalmost seem as though the better the sitters understand any parti-\ncular language the less are the spirits who come to that sitting able\nto speak it.\nIt is impossible without being tedious to discuss all the occasions\nupon which foreign languages are said to have been spoken, but I\nwill give a number of typical examples, from which it is possible to\nform a general estimate of the evidence, taking the various languages\none by one.\nFrench. The evidence for any knowledge of this language, pro-\nbably after English the most widely known among Valiantine's\nsitters, seems to be very scanty. On p. 389 of The Wisdom of the\nGods, it is said that Countess Ahlefeldt-Laurvig had a daylight\nsitting, at which she alone was present, and her brother communi-\ncated with her in French. There is no first-hand statement by the\nsitter and no record of what was said ; it is therefore impossible to\nform any judgment as to the value of this incident. 1\nSpanish. At a sitting held at Arlena Towers in 1923 (Towards the\nStars, p. 33) a Spanish cook of Mr De Wyckoff's was present. It is\nsaid that her husband spoke with her in \" a mixture of Basque and\ncorrupt Spanish.\" It is also said that he spoke \" in good Spanish\n\"\nto Mr De Wyckoff. All this is given at second-hand ; Mr Bradley\ndoes not himself know Spanish, and not a word of any conversation\nis quoted in the original. The cook is obviously a bad witness, very\nemotional and excited.\nAt Dorincourt in 1924 (Towards the Stars, p. 197), Lady Grey of\nFallodon and Mr William Archer being present, we are told that\n1\nCf. Lord Charles Hope's observations, below, p. 415.\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 403\n\" at a later stage a spirit endeavoured to hold a conversation with\nLady Grey and Mr Archer in Spanish.\" From the use of the word\n\" endeavoured \" we may infer that these two sitters, whose joint\ntestimony would have carried considerable weight, did not find the\nspirit very fluent or intelligible on this occasion.\nItalian. At Dorincourt in 1924 (Towards the Stars, p. 218),\nSenator Marconi being present, \" the voice spoke to him in Italian\na language I [Mr Bradley] cannot follow\u2014and addressed him as\n'\nGuglielmo.' The voice was rather indistinct, but Senator Marconi\nkept the conversation going for over ten minutes, and he was\nanswered throughout in the Italian language. Senator Marconi\nafterwards said that the spirit voice announced itself as his father,\nbut he had not been successful in acquiring sufficient evidence to\nestablish his identity.\" It is interesting to be told that Senator\nMarconi kept the conversation going for over ten minutes, but no\none is likely to question his knowledge of Italian. We are not told\nwhat impression the spirit-voice made on him beyond the fact that\nit spoke indistinctly and he was not satisfied with the evidence of\nidentity it offered.\nOn another occasion (The Wisdom of the Gods, p. 368) Mr Harry\nPrice reports that at a sitting at which he was present in 1925\nItalian was spoken, and he quotes a few short phrases. The best\nevidence for the speaking of Italian at Valiantine's sittings is to be\nfound in the reports published in the spiritualistic magazine Luce e\nOmbra, of the sittings held in Italy (see, for example, Luce e Ombra,\nxxx. 27 ff.). If the integrity of the sitters can be assumed\u2014I have\nno grounds for doubting it, but the point is essential, for it would\nhave been perfectly easy in the darkness of the seance-room for any\none of them to act the part of a supposed communicator\u2014it would\ncertainly appear that a fair knowledge of conversational Italian was\nshown. Voices are said to have spoken in Sicilian and Piedmontese\ndialects, but no quotations are given. It is also said (p. 33) that\nImperator, whom \" some called Peter and some Malachi,\" communi-\ncated and \" intoned a liturgical chant in Latin \" which greatly im-\npressed his hearers. On being asked to repeat it slowly, in order that\nit might be written down, he said he would give it in Italian, as\nfollows :\n\" Un Mondo d'argento sara pieno di spiriti. Cristo non vuole\npiu guerra. Cristo vuole che gli spiriti vengano sempre per stabilire\ncommunicazioni colla terra.\"\nIt is unfortunate that Imperator did not realise how much more\nvaluable a record of his liturgical Latin would have been.\nThe difficulty of assessing the value of these reports in Luce e\nOmbra, written of course in Italian, is increased by the fact that it is\nnot always made clear in what language the voices actually spoke.\n\f404 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nOn p. 28, for example, Bert Everett is represented as saying, \" Ogni\ncosa e squisita.\" Did Bert Everett speak in Italian ?\n\" Exquisite\n\"\nis one of his regular catch-words.\nOf all foreign languages Italian seems the one most likely to be\nknown conversationally to Valiantine, for it is widely spoken in\nAmerica by Italian immigrants. Mr Bradley tells us (And After,\np. 165) that from his own \" absolute knowledge \" he can assert that\nValiantine does not speak Italian. But how can he tell us this from\nhis own knowledge, when he has told us more than once that he does\nnot himself speak Italian ? Incidentally it is very much easier to\ndiscover that a man does not know a language when he is pretending\nhe does, than to discover that he does know it when he is pretending\nhe does not. I think many of Valiantine's sitters have been much\ntoo ready to take his simplicity and ignorance for granted, for if he\nis fraudulent, an appearance of simplicity and ignorance will obvi-\nously be a part of his stock-in-trade.\nGerman. In Towards the Stars, p. 193, we are told that at a sitting\nheld at the British College for Psychic Science in February 1924 an\nAustrian lady, Miss Eisner, was present and a spirit communicated\npurporting to be her grandmother. \" The conversation opened in\nEnglish and drifted into German. Later the Austrian lady's mother\ncame and conversed with her also in German.\" No details of the\nconversation and no quotations are given. With this statement may\nbe compared the evidence obtained at the Berlin sittings :\nOn one occasion (Z. \/. Paraps. lvi. 503) we are told that \" a\nwhispering voice, hardly intelligible, said several times to Frau von\nDirksen, '\nDein Mann, ja, ja, sehr gut.' To every question put by\nFrau von Dirksen the answer was, '\nJa, ja, sehr gut.' ... A\nsimilar voice spoke later to Princess Y. The communications were\njust as poor as in Frau von Dirksen's case, and also in the case of\nevery other German-speaking intelligence which manifested in the\ncourse of the enquiry.\"\nWith this we may compare Frau von Dirksen's report of the\nprivate sitting she had with Valiantine (p. 604). Her husband pur-\nported to communicate and spoke in English. Valiantine having\nascertained, as she tells us, that he could speak English when alive.\nFor the first time the communications were intelligible and coherent,\nalthough nothing evidential was said.\nOn p. 599 we are told that a voice addressed a nephew of Frau von\nDirksen's and spoke the words \" Vater, Mutter \"\n;\nthey were pro-\nnounced \" Vatter, Motter.\" Both this young man's parents were\nliving. Dr Driesch (p. 653) testifies to the fact that in his hearing\nonly one or two words of German were spoken. Dr Quade (p. 655)\nnotes the foreign accent :\n\" Ich sprekke Deutsch.\"\nRussian. In Towards the Stars, p. 219, we are told that at a\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 405\nsitting in February 1924 \" a voice talked to Mrs Mollo, in what\nsounded like Russian. . . . The voice, during the conversation,\naddressed Mrs Mollo as Anna Gregorievna and stated that it was the\nson of her husband. I [Mr Bradley] ascertained afterwards that\nMrs Mollo's husband had a son by a previous marriage and he had\npassed away. This stepson had always addressed Mrs Mollo as\nAnna Gregorievna.\" Here again no quotations are given and no\nfirst-hand corroboration, so that the value of the incident cannot be\nassessed.\nWelsh. In Towards the Stars, p. 210, Mr Caradoc Evans reports\na conversation he had during a sitting at Dorincourt with a com-\nmunicator purporting to be his father. A quotation is given which,\nif it is accurate, indicates that some knowledge of Welsh was shown.\nBut is it accurate ? As the sittings take place in complete darkness,\none assumes in the absence of any statement to the contrary, that no\nnotes were made at the time. When were the notes of the conversa-\ntion made : that is, how long after the sitting ? This we are not told,\nand in a case where verbal accuracy is the whole root of the matter,\nit is a point of great importance. Mr Bradley's own standard in such\nmatters may be judged from some criticisms he passes (Towards the\nStars, p. 314) on a report by Mr Malcohn Bird of the sittings held\nunder the auspices of the Scientific American. \" He [Mr Bird] says\nthat ' even with a poverty of phenomena, we could not remember the\nsequence of the sitting sufficiently well.' Why could he not re-\nmember the sequence ? Any intelligent mind can not only record a\nshort sequence of the occurrences of two hours, but can memorize\nthe gist of a dozen conversations practically word for word.\"\nI will make so bold as to say that I believe the accuracy of my\nmemory to be at least equal to Mr Bradley's, but I would not under-\ntake without the help of contemporary notes to record a complete\nsequence \" of the occurrences of two hours,\" or \" the gist of a dozen\nconversations practically word for word.\"\nAs to Mr Caradoc Evans's testimony, it is perhaps mere prejudice\non my part, but I should attach more weight to it if he had not\nasserted (The Wisdom of the Gods, p. 40) that at a private sitting at\nDorincourt, at which neither Valiantine nor any other professional\nmedium was present, Mrs Leonard's Control, Feda, sat on his knees\n\" substantially \" and kissed him with \" lips that were warm with\nthe warmth of life.\" To make such a statement on such evidence as\nMr Caradoc Evans had, seems to me to argue either unlimited\ncredulity, or a complete indifference to truth !\nAn Indian Dialect. At a sitting in 1925 (The Wisdom of the Gods,\np. 238) at which two Indians were present, a voice was heard speaking\n\" a foreign language.\" The Indian sitters addressed this voice in an\n\" Indian dialect,\" but they could not understand the answers.\n2e\n\f406 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nJapanese. At a sitting in March 1925 (The Wisdom of the Gods,\np. 274) the Japanese poet Gonnoske Komai was present. A voice\naddressed him in what was alleged to be Japanese. Mr Komai said\nthat the voice volunteered certain names and places, and also said\nthat the speaker had committed \" hari-kari.\" In a polite letter of\nthanks to Mr Bradley Mr Komai says, \" I greatly regret that I could\nnot recognise the gentleman who tried so hard to communicate with\nme in my native tongue.\" We may infer from this guarded state-\nment that the attempt was not in Mr Komai's opinion successful. 1\nChinese. This is prima, facie the most remarkable example of\nspeaking in a foreign language which has been reported at Valian-\ntine's sittings. A communicator who represents himself to be\nConfucius, is said to have conversed fluently and intelligently \" in\narchaic Chinese.\" Now it is first to be observed that the evidence\nfor this phenomenon depends on the testimony of only one witness\nwhose opinion is of any value at all, Dr Neville Whymant, who\nattended a number of sittings with Valiantine in New York and has\npublished a report of his observations entitled Psychic Adventures in\nNew York. It is obviously impossible for any one who was not\npresent at these sittings and who has absolutely no knowledge of\nChinese to dispute with Dr Whymant, but in view of the startling\nclaims he makes it is certainly unfortunate that he offers so little but\nhis own assertions to support them ; there is no attempt to set out\nin detail the evidence upon which these assertions are based. At-\ntempts to obtain the corroborative testimony of other scholars have\nfailed. For example, at a sitting held in London Lord Charles Hope\nobtained a gramophone record of a voice speaking in what purports\nto be Chinese. This record, though it bears a general resemblance in\nsound to Chinese, is untranslatable, a fact which Dr Whymant him-\nself admits (see below, p. 41 9). To attribute this fact to bad recording\nis to beg the question at issue.\nWithout in any way impugning Dr Whymant's good faith one may\nquestion whether he has made sufficient allowance for the liability of\nthe ear to be deceived when straining to catch the indistinct whispers\nof which these trumpet communications mainly consist. My own\nimpression that suggestibility may have played a considerable part\nin the conclusions to which Dr Whymant has come is strengthened\nby the observations made by Lord Charles Hope in the Phoenix\nsittings (see below, p. 427). It there appears that Dr Whymant\nbelieved himself to have heard a number of words in various Oriental\nlanguages on occasions when Mr Yih, a Chinaman from the School\nof Oriental Studies, \" could not catch a single word of any language\nexcept English.\" In the case of Phoenix also recourse to fraud has\nbeen clearly proved.\n1\n8ee also Lord Charles Hope's report below, p. 415,\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 407\nThe whole crux of the matter in Valiantine's case is the question\nwhether the voices displayed any accurate or scholarly knowledge\nof Chinese such as is alleged by Dr Whymant. That Valiantine\nshould be able to produce a passable imitation of Chinese, including\nperhaps a few actual words of the language, would not be remarkable\nin view of the fact that America is full of Chinamen.\nTurning now to another aspect of Valiantine's mental phenomena,\nwe are told that through his mediumship a great multitude of com-\nmunicating spirits have given evidence of their personal identity.\nHere again, as in the case of foreign languages, the enquirer finds\nhimself confronted by an immense amount of paper currency, but\nvery little hard cash ; he is reminded of those disastrous conse-\nquences of inflation to which our attention has been lately called. I\nwill not assert dogmatically that Valiantine has no supernormal\npowers at all, for I cannot prove a negative ; it may be that he has,\nbut the fact has yet to be established. In this matter, as in every\nother, Mr Bradley's records are so superficial as to be all but useless.\nLady Troubridge, in the report from which I have already quoted,\ndiscusses some communications received by Miss Radclyffe Hall and\nherself in which knowledge was shown which it did not seem likely\nValiantine would normally possess. At the same time it was not\nimpossible for him to obtain it by judicious enquiry, and one or two\nmistakes were made which are easily explained on the supposition\nthat Valiantine was using information obtained from normal sources,\nbut not likely to have been made by a genuine communicator. On\none occasion, for example, a communicator announced her intention\nof going home with Lady Troubridge and said she had often been\nwith her in Sterling Street, Lady Troubridge had left Sterling\nStreet about a year before the sitting, although she still appeared in\nthe telephone booh as resident at that address ; the purporting com-\nmunicator had never visited Lady Troubridge at Sterling Street and\nwould have been unlikely to speak of going home with her, there or\nanywhere else, since her personal acquaintance with Lady Trou-\nbridge was slight. Generally speaking, Lady Troubridge and Miss\nRadclyffe Hall do not seem to have been favourably impressed with\nwhat we may call the psychological atmosphere of the communica-\ntions, and contrast them unfavourably in this respect with communi-\ncations received through Mrs Leonard (Proceedings, xxxvi. 56 ff.).\nOne other point in this report is worth noting, for it shows the need\nof caution in regard to the resemblance so frequently claimed\nbetween the trumpet-voices and the living voices of the persons said\nto be communicating. At one of the sittings at which Lady Trou-\nbridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall were present Mrs Leonard's Control,\nFeda, purported to speak, as she often does at sittings with Valian-\ntine. \" The other sitters . . . exclaimed that the '\nFeda-Valiantine\n'\n\f408 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nvoice was exactly like its prototype,\" but neither Lady Troubridge\nnor Miss Radclyffe Hall thought that \" the voice or accents bore\nany resemblance to the '\nFeda '\nvoice familiar to [them] at Mrs\nLeonard's.\"\nA suggestive point in regard to the recognition of voices is also to\nbe found in one of the reports in Luce e Ombra to which I have already\nreferred. In vol. xxx, p. 212, there appears a \" declaration \" signed\nby a number of sitters concerning phenomena obtained at some\nsittings held at Venice in 1929. Signora Nunes-Vais did not sign this\ndeclaration \" perche, pur essendosi dichiarata entusiasta dei risultati\nottenuti, fece una riserva sulla '\nvoce '\ndi suo Padre che non ha\nriconosciuta \" ; that is to say, Signora Nunes-Vais was enthusiastic\nabout communications from persons she did not know well ; in\nregard to communications from her own father she reserved her\nopinion, because she did not recognise his voice !\nI have said that Mr Bradley's records are inadequate for any\nscientific purposes ; I will justify this statement by an example,\ntaken from The Wisdom of the Gods, p. 211. At the same sitting at\nwhich Welsh is said to have been spoken, Mr Harold Wimbury, a\njournalist by profession, was present, and a voice addressed him,\nspeaking a word which he did not at first catch. Another member\nof the circle said the word sounded like \" Walter.\" A conversation\nfollowed in the course of which, according to Mr Wimbury's report,\nthe communicator said that Mr Wimbury had known him twenty\nyears ago in Birmingham and that his other name was \" Downing.\"\nMr Wimbury tells us that he had in fact been on very friendly terms\nwith a fellow-journalist called Walter Downing, since dead, in Bir-\nmingham many years before the sitting. In reply to the question,\n\" Do you remember Sally 1\n\" the communicator said, \" Yes, re-\nmember me to him and all of them.\" Asked whether he could say\nwhere he and the sitter had lived together, he replied, \" Over the\nhotel.\" Both these answers were correct. Sally was \" the nickname\nfor a man name Sanders not afemale,\" and Mr Wimbury had at one\ntime shared a room with Walter Downing over the Crown Hotel,\nBirmingham.\nNow this incident affords some primafacie evidence for knowledge\nsupernormally acquired, but, as reported by Mr Bradley, it con-\nstitutes a case for further enquiry and nothing more. As in the case\nof the conversation in Welsh, we are not told how long after the\nsitting Mr Wimbury made his notes, nor are we told whether any\nother sitters can corroborate his statement as to the answers given\nto his questions or the form in which these questions were asked ; in\nparticular we are not told whether the name \" Downing \" was clearly\nheard by any one to whom its relevance was not known, an im-\nportant point, in view of the indistinctness with which on Mr\n\f125] The History of George Valiantine 400\nBradley's own admission these trumpet-voices often speak.1\nNor\nand this is perhaps the most important point of all\u2014are we given\nany means of assessing the probability that Valiantine might have\nderived the knowledge shown at the sitting from some normal source.\nWill students of psychical phenomena never learn that we have no\nright, scientifically speaking, to claim a supernormal origin for an\noccurrence until we have established the improbability of any normal\norigin ?\nWhether in view of Valiantine's proved trickery any further\nenquiry into his phenomena on the mental side is likely to be worth\nthe trouble it would entail may be open to doubt, but one thing is\ncertain : if such an enquiry is to serve any useful purpose, it must\nbe held under the most rigid test-conditions ; there must be an\naccurate record of all that is said at the sittings, and the anonymity\nof the sitters must be assured.\nThere remains yet one aspect of Valiantine's mediumship to con-\nsider : the part he played in the cross-correspondences with Margery,\nfor in several of the most striking cases his co-operation was essential\nto the result. I cannot here attempt to describe or discuss these\ncross-correspondences in detail ; I will only remind my readers of\ntwo important points :\n(1) It was claimed in Dr Richardson's report that the evidence was\nnot dependent for its value on the good faith of the mediums con-\ncerned, but upon the fraud-proof technique used in the selection of\nthe subject-matter of the cross-correspondences. Dr Richardson\nexplicitly admits that apart from this technique they \" could have\nbeen a matter of pre-arrangement between the mediums \" (Psychic\nResearch, xxii. 355).\n(2) The technique as described by Dr Richardson has been criti-\ncised by Mr Besterman (Proceedings, xxxviii. 399 ff.), who shows that\nit is far from being fraud-proof, and therefore the good faith of the\nvarious people concerned is a vital element in tfte case. Another\ncross-correspondence between Margery in Boston and Valiantine in\nVenice, which Mr Bradley reports in And After is open to the same\nobjection.\nWhat are we to think of these phenomena in the light of Valian-\ntine's record as a medium in other fields % The cross-correspond-\nences, if genuine, argue supernormal powers of an astonishingly high\norder ; in their perfect precision of result they stand unrivalled. Can\nwe suppose such powers to have been shown on some half-a-dozen\noccasions by a man who has unquestionably resorted to fraud in the\nproduction of physical phenomena, and whose claim to the possession\nof any supernormal powers, apart from the cross-correspondences,\ncan be shown to rest upon a most unstable foundation ?\n1\nCp. Lord Charles Hope's observations on this point below, p. 413.\n\f410 Mrs W. H. Salter [PART 125]\nIf we answer this question in the negative, it follows that the\nknowledge necessary to Valiantine's part in the cross-correspondences\nmust have been obtained from a normal source. We are then faced\nwith a further problem as to the source from which it was obtained ;\nand upon that reflexion I will close.\n\f:\nAPPENDIX\nREPORT ON SOME SITTINGS WITH VALIANTINE\nAND PHOENIX IN 1927 1\nBy Lord Charles Hope\nI\nThe usual conditions at the Valiantine sittings held in my flat, were\nas follows : the medium sat on an ordinary chair at one end of the\nroom, which was narrow but fairly long, and a rough circle was\ncompleted by the sitters. On an average there was about two feet\nand a half clear between the chairs, sometimes rather less. Two\naluminium trumpets spotted with luminous paint were usually\nplaced on the floor some few feet from the medium. The aluminium\ntrumpets were made in three segments one fitting inside the other,\nand were thus collapsible. They had been brought by the medium\nfrom America.\nThe circle of sitters was arranged so that the backs of at least two\nchairs were each hard up against a wall, making it impossible for the\nmedium to get round outside the circle, although there was a clear\nspace of about two feet behind his own chair, and it would usually\nhave been possible for him to have stood behind the chairs of the two\nsitters directly next to him. Behind the sitter immediately opposite\nhim there was a considerable clear space.\nThe darkness was complete, as any light filtering in through the\nwindow or under the door was at once remarked upon by the medium\nor on one or two occasions by the \" voices \" and deemed to inhibit\nthe \" phenomena.\"\nNo one, as far as I know, held hands with the person next to him.\nAfter I had had my first two sittings with Valiantine, these being\nheld at Mr Bradley's house, I suggested to Mr Bradley that some kind\nof test sittings should be held. Mr Bradley became considerably\ndisturbed and informed the medium of my request. I was told that\nValiantine considered he had got past the stage when such tests could\nbe thought necessary and that the nature of the mental evidence\ngiven at the sittings was a sufficient guarantee in itself.\nI was disappointed, but as I had returned from abroad specially\nfor the experience of sitting with Valiantine I was naturally loath to\nmiss the opportunity.\n1\nAbridged from a paper read at a Private Meeting of the Society, 30 March\n1932.\n411\n\f412 Lord Charles Hope [part\nI will not attempt to go into details about each sitting, but I will\nendeavour to give examples of the best and the worst of the pheno-\nmena experienced.\nFirst of all, I should say, the \" voices \" attributed to various\n\" guides \" of the medium were usually loud and fairly clear, whereas\nthe communicating \" voices,\" attributed to other spirits (the friends\nand relations of the sitters) were usually very low and indistinct.\nThis was unfortunate as it was from these communicators that\nevidence for survival could be expected.\nThe first phenomenon which occurred at the sittings was in almost\nevery case the voice of \" Dr Barnett,\" Valiantine's chief guide, which\nseemed to come from a trumpet still placed on its big end on the\nfloor in front of the medium. This voice was usually loud and clear\nand had a distinct Scottish accent, although the accent was not always\nconstant, sometimes lapsing into Americanisms. This, I was told,\nwas to be expected, as \" Dr Barnett \" had come with his family to\nAmerica from Scotland as a small boy.\nI will now endeavour to give some idea of the most impressive\ncommunications received at the sittings I attended. I quote from\nnotes either written by me immediately after the sitting, or taken\ndown at the time by a professional notetaker.\nDuring my first four Valiantine sittings three names of guides were\ngiven. These names had been given to me previously, one at a\nprivate sitting and the other two by professional mediums. This\nwas a point distinctly in favour of Valiantine's mediumship, pro-\nvided, as he afterwards assured me, he had had no normal knowledge\nof these names. Unfortunately the subsequent history of these\nalleged guides was not satisfactory, although that would not rule out\na telepathic explanation of my having received these names through\nValiantine's mediumship.\nI will divide the phenomena into five sections, taking favourable\nand unfavourable examples of each. The first is my own personal\nevidence. As I have already stated three names of alleged \" guides\n\"\nwere given correctly. Also at my earlier sittings a communicator\nspoke, purporting to be an Aunt of mine. The name given at first\nwas a common one but conveyed nothing to me until I remembered\nI had had an Aunt of that name who was always called by another\nname. To encourage this \" voice \" I spoke, giving the name by\nwhich my Aunt had really been called. This was immediately\naccepted by the \" voice \" which continued to speak at most of the\nsubsequent sittings. Unfortunately, although this voice gained in\nstrength and assurance, nothing of an evidential kind was ever given\nalthough I supplied many opportunities for it to do so. Before the\nend of my Valiantine sittings I felt I could have got this \" voice \" to\nacquiesce and repeat any nonsense I cared to suggest, but I did not\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 413\ndo so, as I wished to give the \" voice \" the fullest chance to make\ngood. A Father and a Grandfather voice also spoke, but absolutely\nnothing which could be considered evidential was said to me.\nOne point of interest I noticed in connection with these alleged\nvoices of my relations was that they gradually grew in strength and\nvolubility, and when presented in a more developed form, so to speak,\nto some relations of mine who came to some later sittings, created\nquite a good impression. Only 7 could see that this improvement\nwas really due to my former conversations with these \" voices.\"\nNames which I had mentioned during the sittings, the address\nabroad of a near relative to whom I was constantly writing, and one\nor two names I had mentioned to the medium, all came out quite\n\" pat,\" and this of course impressed me unfavourably. A name,\nhowever, was mentioned suddenly one day by a voice which pur-\nported to be the Aunt of a girl whose name was given. It stated cor-\nrectly that this girl was at the moment in India with some relations\nof mine and said it wished to speak to her when she returned. There\nagain, it was impossible to be sure the medium had not overheard\nsome one mention this name casually before a sitting, although I\ncertainly had not done so myself.\nNow to turn to communications made to other sitters. It was of\ncourse in those cases harder for me to judge of their value. One lady,\na foreigner, came several times and received messages which favour-\nably impressed her. These were usually given in French and some-\ntimes in Russian but, to be candid, I felt uneasy lest she might have\nthought she was hearing more than was actually the case, inasmuch\nas the voice was weak and she a little deaf.\nOn one occasion she carried on quite a long conversation in English\nwith an entity purporting to be a friend of hers, and I was told the\nreplies given to her questions were quite satisfactory. The com-\nmunications in French and Russian, on the other hand, were very\nbrief and disjointed. Although most of the communications to other\nsitters also were of a fleeting order one or two things were said which,\nif heard correctly, would point to at least some telepathic power\nbeing possessed by the medium.\nA Christian name and surname were given to a sitter which were\nin fact the names of a likely communicator. The sitter was unknown\nto the medium and there seemed no likely normal means by which\nthe medium could have learnt this name. Here again the question\narises whether or not the sitter really did hear the name given\ncorrectly or whether a two-syllabled murmur merely gave him the\nidea of that name which he was half expecting.\nSeveral other sitters were also favourably impressed but when I later\nendeavoured to learn what facts or names had been volunteered, the\nevidence furnished seemed always to have been of the slenderest kind.\n\f414 Lord Charles Hope [part\nFathers and Grandfathers predominated among the list of alleged\ncommunicators, and unfortunately, as the medium had usually been\nintroduced by name to the sitters just before the sittings, references\nto \" Father Smith \" or \" Grandfather Smith \" were not evidential.\nOne sitter at his one and only experience of Valiantine's medium-\nship was addressed by a voice claiming to be his father. He asked\nthis voice to give its own Christian name. Reply, \" You know it\nvery well.\" The sitter agreed, but said he required it as a proof of\nidentity. The voice, \" I can give it, but is that all you have to say to\nme ? Your brother is here.\" The sitter replied, \" Do you mean my\nbrother Arthur ?\n\" The father voice then said the brother would\nspeak later.\nTowards the end of this sitting the trumpet went over to this\nsitter and was laid on his head. A voice then loudly said, \" Arthur.\nWhy can't you say something to me ?\n\" The sitter became agitated\nand the sitting had to be closed, and it was not until I pointed it out\nlater that he remembered that he had himself furnished the name\n\" Arthur \" as being that of his brother.\nI am making a point of this particular case because I think it is a\ngood example of how an inexperienced sitter can so easily be much\nimpressed for no good reason. This sitter was a medical man, and\nI should say well above the average in intelligence.\nNow for \" foreign- speaking voices.\" As I have already mentioned\nthe so-called guide voices were much louder and clearer than the\nother voices. The outstanding case of a foreign-speaking voice was\nthe guide \" Christo di Angelo \" who spoke loudly in Italian. I think\nthere is no doubt that some Italian really was spoken by this voice\nalthough, not knowing the language, I cannot personally vouch\nfor it.\nOn one occasion a friend of mine whose knowledge of Italian is\nconsiderable but not profound, carried on quite a long conversation\nwith this voice which said he, \" di Angelo,\" had been born near\nPalermo, had been 80 years old when he died, and that had been\n44 years previously. My friend translated to us what had been said,\nand the trumpet again rose and one detail was corrected\u2014showing\nthe intelligence at work had been listening.\nA seeming attempt was made in this communication to give the\nexact locality in which this Italian guide was supposed to have lived\nbut, as far as I know, nothing has ever been done to try and verify\nthis statement. It would obviously be difficult to do so after so long,\nand even if the statement were verified, the possibility of the medium\nhaving gained information normally about a real personage could\nnot be ruled out.\nThere were at least two guide \" voices \" who were said on occa-\nsion to speak in American Indian dialects, but unfortunately no one\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 415\nwas ever present who was capable of checking these languages.\nMostly they confined themselves to war whoops and other loud and\nterrifying noises.\nSeveral times a voice spoke saying it was \" Martin Luther.\" This\nvoice, although it spoke in English, was in a way impressive, inso-\nmuch that the words could easily be distinguished and the accent\nshowed no trace of American, and was indeed quite unlike the\nmedium's ordinary voice and also unlike the guide \" voices.\"\nOn my asking this Martin Luther voice whether he had spoken\nEnglish during his earth life, he replied, No, he had learnt it since.\nHe said he had spoken German and Latin. I asked this voice to\nspeak German to a lady present (the same lady to whom the Russian\nhad been spoken), and she afterwards assured us it was good German\nof an old-fashioned type.1\nAt one sitting there were present a Dutchman, his wife and\ndaughter, who had come over specially to sit with Valiantine. They\nwere, they told me, convinced spiritualists. No voice spoke at this\nsitting and they were very much disappointed. The medium then\noffered to sit for them again later that day, when I was not able to\nbe present.\nBy this later sitting they seem to have been favourably impressed,\nbut I gathered that four unconnected words of Dutch were all they\nclaimed to have heard.\nA Japanese gentleman, Mr Komai, who had sat previously with\nValiantine at Mr Bradley's house, came three times to my sittings.\nAt the first a voice spoke telling him, so he afterwards said, that he\nshould return to see his family in Japan. Actually he had not been\nback for fourteen years. Mr Komai was undoubtedly favourably\nimpressed with what he had heard. At his next sitting no voice spoke\nto him, but it is only fair to say that he was told his brother was\nwaiting to speak. Actually the sitting came to an abrupt end owing\nto an electric recording machine with which I was experimenting,\nhaving gone wrong in a particularly noisy fashion.\nAt his third sitting again no voice spoke to Mr Komai. Few\nphenomena occurred that day. We were told the medium had been\noverworked and the power was low. A few words were spoken to\na Dane one day. He thought he caught one or two Danish words,\nand he then tried German and heard \" Grandmother \" and \" Brother\nis here.\"\nThe few words I heard spoken in French did not impress me favour-\nably. They were disjointed and badly pronounced.\nA voice on two occasions spoke what was said to be Portuguese.\nNo one present on either occasion knew any Portuguese.\n1\nCompare with this the almost complete inability to speak German shown\nat the Berlin sittings, above, p. 404. Ed.\n\f416 Lord Charles Hope [part\nApart from the question of the gramophone records, with which I\nwill deal later, these cases complete my experience of foreign\nlanguages spoken at Valiantine's sittings.\nThe next section includes physical phenomena, seeing in the dark,\ndaylight sittings, approts and direct writing.\nIt was impossible to vouch for any of the physical phenomena\nowing to the complete lack of control of the medium. The move-\nments of the trumpets, however, were on occasions very impressive\nand on one occasion a trumpet spotted with luminous paint seemed\nto rise very high and strike something sounding like the ceiling, which\nwas 11 feet 6 inches from the floor. Sometimes two trumpets were\nin the air at the same time.\nIf the effects were obtained by normal means the medium's sense\nof direction must have been exceptionally good. On one occasion\nsomething which felt like a large hand was placed on my head with-\nout any preliminary fumbling. Another time I bent forward to set\nup a trumpet which had fallen over and having done so I was lightly\ntouched on the face by something not a trumpet.\nThe gramophone was slowed down on several occasions when it\nhad been placed at a considerable distance from the medium's chair,\nand on one occasion the table on which the gramophone stood was\nmoved quite a foot from a position where it would have been very\ndifficult for the medium to have reached it.\nOne day a lady brought a large sea shell which she had got in China.\nShells like these, I was told, are sometimes used as horns to blow.\nThis shell was certainly blown through ostensibly by a Chinese\n\" spirit.\" Some of us tried afterwards and could not make a sound\nwith it, but the medium may have been more skilled.\nI did not have sufficient opportunities to test the claim of some of\nthe voices that they could see in the dark. There was a distinct\nresistance to that kind of test as there was indeed to any kind of test.\nI had one daylight sitting, but the fact that the small end of the\ntrumpet was held to the sitter's ear while the medium held his hand\nover the big end was not conducive to good observation.\nLater, acting on a remark of the medium's, I placed a looking glass\nopposite the sitter when Valiantine one day gave daylight sittings to\nthree of my friends, one after another. These sitters were favourably\nimpressed although the communications were not of an evidential\nnature. Another day a lady who is a keen observer was not favour-\nably impressed. Her account follows :\n\" Mr V. and I sat and talked for some time about his forthcoming\nvisit to Italy and other matters. After about five minutes he put the\ntrumpet to my ear, and after a few seconds asked me if I did not hear\nsounds. I then heard gentle murmuiings. I asked various questions,\nif I knew the '\nspirit' etc., and so on, and got 'yes' quite clearly.\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 417\nAt intervals I asked for a name, but never got more than a two-\nsyllabled murmur. I tried quite genuinely to catch, the name and to\nhelp by keeping the conversation going. Then V. said '\nDoesn't it\nsound like father '\nand I said, '\nYes, I believe it does,' whereupon I\ngot ' Father '\nquite clearly down the trumpet. I went on talking and\nwas asked to give a message about being happy. I asked who the\nmessage was for but got no name until I suggested it was for Mother,\nwhen at once I got\n1\nMother '\nquite clearly down the trumpet. I\nasked '\nFather ' if he was alone and he said no, he was with and\nthen a double-syllabled murmur. I said I knew names were hard to\nget through and found out it was a man who was with '\nFather,' but\ngot no name. I asked various questions and then tried again for the\nname. Mr V. suggested the next murmur I got was '\nAda '\n(the name\nwhich was right for a lady at our last sitting) but I reminded him\nit was a man speaking and so the name did not come through the\ntrumpet. There seemed no hope of getting more than a murmur\nunless I helped, so after a bit I said, '\nIs it Harry who is with you ?\n'\nand at once got the clear reply '\nYes, Harry, he wants to speak to\nyou.' I then carried on some sort of conversation and was again told\nthere was a message for me to give. Again the same murmur when\nI asked for a name, so after a bit I said, '\nIt sounds like Morley but I\ncan't believe you really want to send a message to Morley, so do say\nthe name very clearly if Morley is right.' At once \" Yes, Morley,\"\ncame down the trumpet as clear as a whisper can be. Both Harry\nand Morley are pure inventions. I have never heard of either of\nthem. During the sitting I could see V.'s face in the looking glass but\nnearly all the time my view of his mouth was blocked by the wide\nend of the trumpet. I said my arm ached, and shifted my position\nonce, but still failed to get a continuous view of his mouth.\"\nThis lady's father was at that time alive and in good health.\nAfter that I got another lady to have a sitting while I was in the\nroom, and I then pointed out to Valiantine that his hand was not\ncompletely covering the big end of the trumpet and so letting in the\nlight. I gave him a small bit of black cloth to cover it over with. No\nvoice was heard by this sitter but only a few indistinct sounds which\nmight have been caused by the medium's nails scratching the surface\nof the trumpet.\nThe medium seemed to be \" off \" daylight sittings after that ex-\nperience.\nThere were four so-called apports, but these were quite incon-\nclusive.\nThere were two cases of writing done at sittings held in the dark.\nOn one occasion a small block of writing-paper was moved, during a\nsitting, from the lower ledge of the table on which stood the gramo-\nphone and some Oriental characters were drawn on two pages. These\n\f418 Lord Charles Hope [part\nwere later translated by Mr Komai and read \" Ban-Zai \" and\n\" 10,000,\" \" 8 \" and \" 16th day of the . . . month.\" The characters,\nso he told me, were well formed but some seemed incomplete.\nSome days later a similar incident occurred. A page of the same\nblock of paper, the first sheets of which I had previously numbered\nin case they were required for taking notes, was found on the floor\nalmost covered with Oriental characters.\nI had numbered these sheets of paper just before this sitting, and\nit seems improbable the medium could have substituted another\nsimilar piece of paper, as the piece used had my numbering on it and\nthat numbered page was missing from the block. At the same time\nthis block was the same one that had been used on the previous\noccasion and it is just possible that the medium might have secreted\na page from it. The characters, therefore, were probably written in\ncomplete darkness during the sitting. An expert at the British\nMuseum afterwards told me he did not think he could have done it\nhimself in the dark, but then of course he had never attempted to do\nso, or practised doing so, which the medium might have done.\nThe translation of these characters ran \" Outline of the History\nof the Middle Kingdom,\" which sounds like the title of a book. The\nexpert looked up a list of Chinese books but could find no such\ntitle.\nI must not forget to touch on the important question of whether\nor not the \" voices \" ever overlapped either each other or the normal\nvoice of the medium. No definite answer can be given. Some people\nsaid \" yes,\" some \"no.\" I thought I heard overlapping two or three\ntimes, but was doubtful. At one sitting one very keen observer\nconcentrated on that one point and later wrote to me to say he was\nsure it had not taken place that day although several people had\nremarked on it as having occurred that day.\nThe special sitting for recording the voices was held in the usual\nroom in my flat. There were present the medium, Mr and Mrs\nBradley and myself. Six records in all were made by the Columbia\nGramophone Company, but of this number we were only allowed to\nchoose the four we considered most interesting.\nOn one record the guide \" Bert \" sang, and \" Blackfoot \" and\n\" Kokuni \"\u2014two American Indians\u2014spoke (presumedly) in their\ndifferent dialects. On the second record \" Confucius \" spoke a few\nwords, and at the end of the record there was a short sentence from\n\" Dr Barnett.\"\nThe next record began with a voice supposed to be my guide\nspeaking in Hindustani and Sanskrit, and this was followed by\n\" Christo di Angelo \" the Italian guide voice, making a short oration\nin Italian. On the fourth record were snatches of song and a sentence\nor two from \" Shung Wee,\" another Chinese voice. He was supposed\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 419\nto be a modern Chinese and on one occasion had spoken in rather\nunconvincing pidgin English.\nA copy of the \" Confucius \" record was in the possession of Dr\nWhymant for some time. He told me he found it impossible to make\na full translation although he thought he could catch a few words here\nand there. He seemed to think it took the form of a greeting spoken\nin archaic Chinese and he even wrote down provisionally a few\nsentences, but I do not feel justified in quoting these as Dr Whymant\nassured me at the time that owing to the imperfection of the re-\ncording any full translation would be guesswork.\nThat completes my experiences with Valiantine. I was dis-\nappointed at the lack of evidence for survival which the voices had\ngiven me. I was left uncertain whether Valiantine was a genuine\nmedium or not.\nMy position was that I had been somewhat impressed by the so-\ncalled physical phenomena, but owing to the complete lack of any\nkind of test conditions permitted by the medium, and the complete\ndarkness insisted upon by him, I had only my impressions to go upon,\nand no proof whatsoever that the phenomena in question were\ngenuine.\nII\nI will now pass on to some experiences I had with another \" voice\n\"\nmedium, Mr William Phoenix of Glasgow.\nPrevious to my Valiantine sittings I had had three sittings with\nPhoenix at his house in Glasgow, and had been favourably impressed\nby the loudness and clarity of the \" voices \" and the good accounts\nI had heard of this medium's powers from other sitters, although I\nhad not myself obtained anything of evidential value. I had also\nbeen told he had given satisfactory sittings at the British College of\nPsychic Science in London. He was, and is still, I understand, a\nprofessional medium although he also had other employment.\nThe conditions pertaining at Phoenix's sittings were similar to\nthose at Valiantine's except that there was no luminous paint on the\ntrumpet. I made some guarded inquiries from some of Phoenix's\nregular sitters and was told he would not submit to \" tests,\" but that\nthe mental phenomena alone were sufficient to carry conviction.\nOne of this medium's guides was supposed to be an Italian who\nhad been an ice-cream vendor in Glasgow. I was assured he had\nspoken Italian on occasions and that there had been several other\ninstances of languages unknown to the medium being spoken at the\nsittings.\nAfter reading of Dr Whymant's startling experiences in New York\nwith Valiantine, and after my subsequent experiences with the same\n\f420 Lord Charles Hope [part\nmedium in London, I was anxious to see whether Dr Whymant\nwould have similar experiences with another medium.\nDr Whymant kindly consented to travel to Glasgow and I met\nhim there, having previously arranged with Phoenix to give us two\nsittings. I merely told him I was bringing a friend who was much\ninterested in \" voice \" phenomena. It is possible that Phoenix may\nhave recognised Dr Whymant from having seen a photograph of\nhim published in connection with the Valiantine sittings in New\nYork. If so there was no sign of any such recognition.\nThere were present at this first sitting the medium, his wife and\ntwo lady friends, besides Dr Whymant and myself. I will confine\nmyself chiefly to reporting what was said to Dr Whymant.\nAt first there were several attempts by \" voices \" to speak to him\nin English. These were not at all satisfactory\u2014one voice was repre-\nsented by a guide voice as having been his wife, who in point of fact\nwas alive.\nA \" voice \" then spoke, muttering some unintelligible words. This\nwas greeted as being Phoenix's Hindu guide. I asked that this\n\" voice \" should speak again and suggested that my friend might be\nable to understand what was said even if I could not. The \" voice\n\"\nand Dr Whymant then spoke in some language I could not\nunderstand.\nI will now quote from Dr Whymant's own account. I am\nquoting in full that part which concerns the speaking of foreign\nlanguages.\n\" Suddenly a voice addressed Lord Charles, the '\nvoice ' of an\nIndian guide of the circle. He suggested that the Indian came to me\nspeaking in his own tongue. The '\nvoice '\nswerved in my direction\nand rapped out a sentence which I did not catch. I asked for it to\nbe repeated, and then came the words, '\nDost Bidam ' (I am a friend).\nThis was not a repetition of the first sentence. I asked '\nChi-chiz-ast 1\n'\n(Who art thou?) and the voice replied '\nBiradar-Bidam '\n(I am thy\nbrother)\u2014this being a greeting\u2014not intended as a literal statement\nof fact. I then asked from what part of the world came the speaker,\nand the force failing, caught only the word '\nHind-I . . .\n'\nThe voice\nseemed to be that of an Indian attempting to speak a variety of\nPersian.\"\nI was naturally encouraged by this result and expressed the hope\nto Dr Whymant that at our next sitting we might get better results,\nbut at the same time I warned him that at this same sitting \/ had\nreceived a very unsatisfactory communication from a \" voice.\"\nAt our second Phoenix sitting held two days later (7 September\n1927), attempts to speak in foreign languages were again much the\nmost notable phenomena. I will quote Dr Whymant's own account\nfrom his notes taken during the sitting :\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 421\nFrom the beginning I was obsessed with a feeling that I had to\nspeak in Italian ; even when Luke and another voice spoke to me in\nEnglish I felt that Italian was on my lips. More voices than before\n(5\/9\/27), addressed me definitely and the voices seemed to come from\nunder my feet. Not all, of course. Some indeed seemed to originate\nfrom some height above my head. There was much singing and a\nfew attempted communications which I did not catch. There seemed\nan indefiniteness about all the voices on this occasion although there\nwas a great effort made to indicate something or other. I had some\nnumbered pages of a writing pad on my knee and from time to time\nmade notes of the actual words spoken in foreign tongues (I made no\nnotes of the English communications). Frequently during the\nsitting the pencil was tugged very strongly and I noticed two efforts\nto get the paper away from me. Once this was heard by the other\nsitters (the rustling of the paper as it was suddenly seized).\nTowards the end of the sitting a voice spoke in Italian but I could\nget nothing from it at all. Although the voices were quite unsatis-\nfactory in that they told nothing, they definitely gave the impression\nof working up to a good conversation of real import when the power\nfailed. There seems to be little doubt that some real efforts at con-\nversation were being made, as the following records of words spoken\nwill show :\nThe modern Greek words heard were :\n(The Voice) : xoii? elcrde ; How are you 1\n(My reply) : Me-rp\/w?. T ovo\/xa <ra<s ;\nFairly well. What is your\nname %\n(The Voice) : Evvoeire ; Do you understand ?\n(I) : Nat, reAe\/w?, iroio? ehe ; Yes perfectly. Who's that ?\n(The Voice) : yatpw fiXeTrwv uprt? ; I am happy to see you.\n(I) : Evxapia-TU), r ovofia eras ;\nI thank you. What is your name ?\n(The Voice) : \"AXXrjv <popav ; Another time.\nIt is only fair to say that this voice said several things at the be-\nginning which I did not catch as I was not conscious of the fact that\nmodern Greek was being spoken.\nThe Persian voice was very little more explicit than on the\nprevious occasion (5\/9\/27). The words easily distinguishable were :\n(The Voice) : Safd avurdid. You have brought happiness.\n(I) : Ahval-i sherif chi tur act ? How are you ?\n(The Voice) : Al Hamdn Vlllah. I thank you. Well\n(I) : Ism-i tu chi chiz ast ? What is thy name ?\n(The Voice) : 'Eib na-darad. It does not matter.\nThere were isolated words or short phrases rapidly spoken which\nI could not hear. The above takes in all that was heard definitely.\n2 v\n\f422 Lord Charles Hope [paet\nThe Chinese voice was that of a scribe or commentator apparently.\nHe had little to say. It is impossible to represent in Roman tran-\nscription the words used, but my version is as follows :\nIs the honourable first-born 1\nwell ?\nYes, this unworthy one is in good health. What is your honour-\nable name ?\nThis uncultured menial wrote characters for the wise ones and\ncopied their work. (No name given.)\nIs this the voice of him I heard aforetime in a distant city ?\n2\nNo ; he will come again . . . about a moon from this time. . . .\nI did not clearly understand. What is your honourable name ?\n(No answer.)\nA Japanese voice spoke in the modern tongue, but died away as\nsoon as greetings had been exchanged, and names asked.\n(Voice) : Annta loa Donata sama desk ha ? What is your name ?\n(I) : Boku was O-bun-shi to moshimasu. Anata no namae wa ?\nMy name is, 0 Bunshi. What do men call you ?\n(Voice) : Watakushi . . . toTcoro in . . . no toki ni . . . . I ... in\n(the )\nplace ... at the time of ... .\nThe Italian voice said Buona sera but I do not know whether this\nwas heard generally. I replied with the same greeting and asked Ed\nil tuo nome 1 without any result at all. There was some hurried\nchatter of which I merely understood enough to know that there was\nno name in it. After another buona sera the voice ceased.\nNeville Whymant.\nAlthough these Glasgow sittings had not resulted in any communi-\ncations of the order of importance of Dr Whymant's experience in\nNew York, they had apparently established a strong case for the\nspeaking of languages unknown to the medium.\nI thought, therefore, it would have been a pity to leave the ex-\nperiment unfinished, and so at considerable expense I arranged that\nPhoenix should come, together with his wife, to give a longer series\nof sittings in London.\nThese took place in September and October 1927 and were six\nin number. Dr Whymant attended four of these. Of these four\nsittings Mr Gonnoske Komai attended one and a Mr Yih of the\nSchool of Oriental Studies (a Chinaman) attended the other\nthree.\n1\nA polite form of the second person pronoun.\n2\nThis was a test question. I knew the voice was not the same.\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 423\nI will now quote Dr Whymant's account of the first of these\nsittings :\nAfter the lights had been put out the Lord's Prayer was said, and\nthere was much singing.\nLord Charles played several pieces on the gramophone and lights\nin the form of balls floated about freely. . . .\nA voice then burst in rapidly, speaking so quickly and with\napparent breathlessness, that it was impossible at first to recognise\neven the type of speech. Then I recognised it as Chinese, and at the\nsame moment, Gonnosuhe Komai, sitting almost opposite me, called\nout, \" Oh yes ! Very clear. That is Chinese all right.\" I asked him\nif he understood anything of what was said, but unfortunately he did\nnot. The voice was still very hurried and spoke so rapidly that my\nquestions in Chinese passed unheeded, and I cannot truthfully say\nthat I gathered anything at all from this voice. It seemed to be\nover-anxious to tell me something and probably the keenness of its\ndesire prevented its being understood.\nShortly after this another voice was heard, and on being ques-\ntioned by Komai as to whether it wished to speak with him, gave\nthree raps. He then spoke in Japanese as follows :\nDonata : Who (is it) ? repeated several times.\nMolto hakkiri hanashite kudarai : Please speak a little more clearly.\n(This also was said twice or_thrice.)\nThe voice gave the name Oki, but this is all. Komai said he could\nget nothing out of what was said. Nor could I understand anything.\nOther voices struggled for expression without achieving more than\nwhisperings and trumpet taps. Then came a voice speaking a queer\nidiom ; it sounded almost like a jargon of some kind, and I called out\nthat it sounded like an Indo-Chinese border dialect\u2014later getting\nthe impression that it might have been badly spoken Yunnanese.\nThe voice gave bugle calls of a military nature easily recognised, and\nseveral people suggested that he might have been a soldier.\nThe word Singgapura (pronounced like that) was repeated several\ntimes and I tried to draw the voice into Malay speech. This failed and\nI used one or two dialect forms of the Federated Malay States\nlanguages, also without success. There seemed to be no rapport\nbetween us, and I offer the following notes (on what I think was said)\nwith great diffidence.\nIt seemed to me that the voice was that of a Straits Chinese who\nhad lived in Singapore. He had travelled in Northern India, China,\nBurma and some parts of Europe. I distinctly heard the sound\nFa-koo (France), but although I asked a question on this repeatedly,\nI could get no answer. This voice also spoke to Komai, but he could\nmake nothing of it at all. . . .\nNeville Whymant.\n\f424 Lord Charles Hope [part\nI will quote the part of Dr Whymant's account of the sitting of\n3 October which had to do with the speaking of foreign languages :\nIt seemed, soon after this, as though two voices were talking\ntogether in some foreign tongue immediately in front of me. I tried\nhard to gather something from it but could not pick up a single word.\nThe voices then just died away. Again a voice addressed Mrs A.\nwho was disappointed. This was followed by an unmistakeable invo-\ncation\u2014I have heard it too many times to be mistaken on the point.\nIt was part of an invocation used in India and Persia and was intoned.\nThe words were not always distinct but the rhythm and tone were\nthere. Then a voice spoke in an Indo-Iranian dialect similar to the\nGujarati language, but of its purity or academic accuracy I cannot\nspeak, as I do not know the language well enough. . . .\nAfter this a very soft voice came, reminiscent, after a time, of one\nI had heard in the Valiantine sittings in New York. I listened care-\nfully and heard the word '\nOdoi.' This is an uncommon surname in\nJapanese, so I replied in that language, but was not answered.\nExtracts from Dr Whymant's notes on sitting of 4 October 1927 :\nThen came a voice speaking in the same type of language as that\nmentioned in the notes of the 3 October sitting : a quasi-Persian\nidiom which was yet not Persian nor any dialect thereof unless it\nwere one of the Northern Indian dialects with which I am not\nfamiliar. This voice both spoke and sang, but I could glean nothing\nfrom either activity. Then came a voice speaking Kore-Kure (in\nJapanese\u2014this, this) ; and answering in the same tongue I said,\n'\nWhat this ?\n'\nbut no satisfactory answer was forthcoming. The\nname RissJio which is a Japanese personal name, was given, but again\nmy inquiries elicited no response.\nA peculiar point about the above voices is this. Whenever I\naddressed any words at all to these voices using foreign tongues, the\nvoices began talking again, beginning with the last few syllables I had\nused. None but one acquainted with the languages could appreciate\nhow inappropriate (and occasionally ridiculous) this proceeding is.\nThen a voice addressed Mr Yih. He answered but did not under-\nstand a single word. He sang a Chinese song reminiscent of the\nChinese theatre to encourage any lurking voices, but his effort was\nnot rewarded. Then a voice came speaking what at first sounded\nlike Greek.\nI asked: \" 'O\/uiXeire \"EXXrji'iKa \" (Do you speak Greek ?), but\ncould get no intelligible answer beyond the first word which was in\neach case\n\" r\n'EAA>;i'(\/ca.\"\nNeville Whymant.\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings icith Valiantine and Phoenix 425\nThis completes Dr Whymant's accounts of his experiences with\nPhoenix. Mr Komai had unfortunately not been able to under-\nstand any of the apparent attempts to speak to him in foreign\nlanguages, but on the occasion on which he attended, Dr Whymant\ndid not hear any Japanese spoken.\nUnfortunately, try as he might and apparently did, Mr Yih could\nnot catch a single word of any language except English.\nBy this time I had become convinced that, at any rate on most\noccasions, the medium left his chair before \" voices \" spoke to the\nsitters. I had sat next to the medium on several occasions and had\ndistinctly heard sounds like a creaking boot. After the sitting at\nwhich I had first heard these sounds I noticed that one of the\nmedium's boots creaked as he walked. The sounds were similar.\nAt subsequent sittings I heard this sound on several occasions.\nOne of my friends also heard it, and one sitter reported being bumped\ninto by something as though the medium was walking about in the\ncircle of sitters and had lost his sense of direction. As the full number\nof sittings arranged for had been almost completed, I decided to try\nand find out definitely whether or not my suspicions were well\nfounded.\nA friend of mine, Mr Noel Jaquin, whose knowledge of finger\nprints is very considerable, had been at several of these Phoenix\nsittings held in London. It was the same Mr Jaquin who helped\nMr Bradley to test Valiantine with the result already known.\nAt a previous sitting with Phoenix we had already obtained a\npromise from the \" voices \" to co-operate in an experiment for the\nmaking of fingerprints.\nI will now quote from my notes made directly after this final\nsitting. A lady whom I shall call Mrs B. was a friend of the medium's\nbut I feel sure had no part in producing the phenomena and enter-\ntained no suspicions of him. I could not have excluded her from the\nsitting without the risk of alarming the medium.\nThe cabinet mentioned in the notes had not been prepared for the\nsitting but was in the corner of the room at the back and well to the\nleft of the medium's chair. It consisted of two curtains across the\ncorner of the room.\nPhoenix Sitting No. 6 and Last.\n6 October, 11.30 to 1.45. Conditions\u2014All sitting free, total dark-\nness, and no luminous paint on the trumpets. Left to right : the\nMedium (Mr W. Phoenix), Lord Charles Hope (worked gramophone),\nMrs Phoenix, Mr Noel Jaquin, Mrs B., the Medium.\nI had already informed Mr Jaquin of my suspicions. He brought\nseveral pieces of smoked paper for imprints and these, with the\n\f426 Lord Charles Hope [part\npermission of the medium, were placed on the floor ; the medium\nsuggested that one which was immediately in front of his chair should\nbe moved to one side.\nWhile the \" Luke \" voice was speaking from the middle of the\ncircle I cautiously put out a folded newspaper and felt that the\nmedium's chair was empty. I then felt with my hand to make sure.\nDuring the sitting I put my hand quite six times in his chair and about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the sitting, acting on a sudden impulse,\nI removed the cushion from the chair. Later, thinking it would be\nbetter to leave things to take their normal course, I placed the\ncushion against the front of the chair so that the medium should\nthink it had fallen accidentally. Later I felt again and found that it\nhad been moved. . . . About half way through the sitting we heard\nmovements of the cabinet curtains in the corner behind Mrs B. and\nthen quite loud soimds as though someone was moving about in the\ncabinet. Mrs B. remarked on this, and we all encouraged the\n\" spirits.\" I put my hand in the medium's chair while this was going\non and found it empty. No \" voices \" spoke in the circle while this\nwas going on. . . . During the sitting a luminous hand which was\nseemingly on some flat surface was shown to each sitter in turn, and\nwe urged that this should be pressed on a piece of smoked paper, but\nwe were told that \" they \" had not succeeded in doing this. . . .\n\" Luke \" (the medium's guide) now as usual closed the sitting with\nan oration and a well worded prayer, and the medium \" came back\n\"\nand the light was put on.\nWe then found some rather smudged fingerprints on one piece of\npaper in the circle, and on another piece of paper in the cabinet the\nclear imprint of the toes and ball of a naked human foot. We then\ngot Mr and Mrs Phoenix and Mrs B. to make their fingerprints on\nthe other pieces of paper. I then asked Mrs B. to leave the room and\ntold Phoenix that he had been out of his chair during a great part of\nthe sitting and said I had felt repeatedly in his chair while the\n\" voices \" were being produced and had also removed the cushion\nin his absence. He professed great surprise and said he had been\n\" under control \" all the time and therefore had no idea of what had\ntaken place. ... I then suggested that he should turn out his\npockets to prove that he had not got any appliances with which to\nproduce the \" psychic \" lights (which appeared at each sitting).\nHe refused this suggestion. . . . After the medium and his friends\nhad left we found a good fingerprint on the piece of paper on which\nthe foot imprint had been made, and this imprint, and also one of the\npartly smudged imprints on the other paper, coincided with the\nmedium's own fingerprints made after the sitting. Mr Jaquin in-\nformed me after the sitting that at one moment while a \" voice\n\"\nwas speaking to Mrs B. he had caught hold lightly of the coat tails\n\f125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 427\nof the medium who must have thus beeu standing almost facing his\nown chair. Later the same day I requested Phoenix to come and\nmake imprints of his own feet to prove, if possible, their dissimilarity\nto the imprint found on the smoked paper. He refused to comply\nwith my request. Some days later I made a similar request to some\nfriends of his, but without success.\nI have gone to considerable length in describing the results\nobtained with Phoenix because in my opinion they tend to show a\ncertain susceptibility on the part of Dr Whymant to the suggestive\nconditions pertaining to seances held in complete darkness.\nRelectantly I had to come to the conclusion that Phoenix was at\nleast in part a fraud.\nCould he have been in part a true medium 1 That is the question\nwe must ask ourselves. Could he in a trance have spoken words of\nseveral languages which he could not normally have known ? Or,\ncould Dr Whymant who knows so many languages, both ancient and\nmodern, have been deluded into thinking he heard certain snatches\nof conversation coming from a trumpet held near him in complete\ndarkness ? Could the sounds he heard have been really indefinite\nsounds produced by the medium, in the hope that they would be\nmistaken for real words ?\nI cannot say\u2014but judging from my experience of what sounds I\nhave heard other people accept as being detailed messages given in\nEnglish, whereas to me they seemed only incoherent murmurs\nI do not think it is impossible.\nIn this case, too, we must remember Dr Whymant did not know\nwhat language he might be expected to hear, and that must have\nvery considerably increased the difficulty of his task.\nOn the other hand in his sittings with Valiantine in New York,\nafter the first sitting, he knew that ancient Chinese was the language\nhe might be expected to hear, and therefore too close a parallel\nshould not be drawn between his experiences with Valiantine and his\nsubsequent experiences with Phoenix. Perhaps, too, the startling\nnature of the conversations he held with the \" Confucius \" voice may\nhave made him more ready to accept such experiences as possible\nand so rendered him more liable to self-deception.\n\fTHE MEDIUMSHIP OF RUDI SCHNEIDER\nBy Theodore Besterman\nThe time lias not yet come for a critical account of Rudi Schneider's\nmediumship, since it is still in active progress, but the publication of\nan important report of recent sittings in Paris with this medium\nmakes it desirable briefly to survey his previous history. This is\ndone below, and a review of the French report follows in the second\nsection.\nI\nAccording to Rudi Schneider's own account the mediumship of\nhis elder brother Willy was accidentally discovered in 1918. The\nfather of these two mediums, Josef Schneider, is a compositor in the\nlittle Austrian frontier town of Braunau, about 70 miles due east\nfrom Munich. Officers of the Braunau garrison came to the printing\nworks at which he was and still is employed, to buy sheets of paper.\nThey explained that these were wanted for planchette-writing. In\nthis way members of the Schneider family were led to try planchette-\nwriting for themselves, and it was discovered that Willy succeeded\nin producing results under the purporting Control of \" Olga Lintner.\"\nGradually various physical phenomena developed and early in 1919\nWilly first went into trance. One evening in March 1\nno phenomena\noccurred and Olga said that she wanted Rudi, at that time eleven\nyears of age. He was brought in and phenomena began. Since that\ntime Rudi has been a medium, producing phenomena similar to\nthose of Willy, who secured a new Control, Mina, while Rudi took\nover Olga.2\nRudi's trance resembles Willy's in every respect. So\nfar Rudi's own account.3\nIn 1919 Baron von Schrenck-Notzing first sat in Braunau and no\ndoubt then made the acquaintance of Rudi. But for the next few\n1\nAccording to Mr Harry Price, Rudi Schneider (1932), p. ix, this occurred in\nNovember 1919, though possibly a different sitting is referred to. Elsewhere\n(Journ. Amer. S.P.R. [1926], xx. 20, 642), Mr Price gives 1921 as the date of\nthe beginning of Rudi's mediurnslup. According to Captain F. Kogelnik, in\nJourn. Amer. S.P.R. (1926), xx. 146, Rudi was only eight years of age in 1919.\n2\nThis point is confirmed by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing, Materialisations-\nphaenomene 2\n(1923), p. 548, according to whom, however, the beginning of\nmediumship in Rudi, and the transfer of the Control, occurred when Rudi was\nthirteen, that is, two years later.\n3\nAs printed in Dr Eugene Osty and Marcel Osty, Les Pouvoirs inconnus de\nV esprit stir la matiere (1932), pp. 16-18.\n428\n\f[part 125] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 429\nyears the Baron was occupied by the study chiefly of the medium-\nship of Willy Schneider. Reports of his investigation of Rudi have\nnot yet been published (though it is understood that records of 88\nsittings are in the possession of Baroness von Schrenck-Notzing),1\nbut his regular sittings with this medium do not appear to have\nbegun until about 1924. In the meanwhile Rudi had given a great\nmany sittings to others, both at Braunau and elsewhere. He first\nwent to Vienna at the end of 1922,2\nand for some years thereafter\ngave numerous sittings in various parts of Austria, before spirit-\nualistic societies, in haunted houses, and privately, including a series\nunder the conduct of Herr Erich von Czernin-Dirkenau,3\nas well as\nat the (since defunct) Metapsychologisches Institut.4\nI will now give a summary account of the specific sittings of which\nprinted reports are known to me (ignoring newspaper accounts).\nOn 26 January 1924 Rudi gave a sitting in the house of Major von\nBaranski, in Vienna, Among those present were Professors Karl\nPrzibram and Stefan Meyer. They were not impressed by the\nphenomena and thought that they could imitate them by normal\nmeans. They apparently did so in February, with Professor Przi-\nbram as medium.5\nThis was announced in the newspapers as an\nexposure, but it is hardly necessary to point out that, failing a\ndetailed account of the conditions at both sittings, the incident is of\nno particular significance.\nAccording to Prof. Meyer, Rudi was also exposed at this time by\nDr Lothar Lenkei.6\nNo particulars are available.\nThere is an affirmative report of four sittings between 21 and 27\nJuly 1924, at Braunau, at which a variety of phenomena occurred.7\nOn 6 September 1924 Rudi gave a sitting at Baron von Schrenck's\nhouse in Munich, of which we have two reports, one non-committal 8\nand the other rather aggressively affirmative.9\n1\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie (1931), lviii. 33.\n2\nZeitschrift fur psychische Forschung (1927), p. 48\n3\nPsychische Studien (1924), li. 261.

Hoffmann in Vienna.1\nIn tbe autumn of 1925 Mr Dingwall witnessed some \" interesting\nand suggestive phenomena \" in Braunau.2\nTo this period possibly belongs an undated sitting, reported anony-\nmously, but introduced and therefore presumably authenticated by\nDr Hans Rosenbusch. In this sitting an object had been secretly\npainted, it was levitated, and the medium's hand afterwards bore\ntraces of the paint. 3\nIn March 1926 Rudi was in Prague, where he gave five sittings. 4\nDuring a sitting on the 21st an interesting form of control was tried.\nThe medium's right hand was tied to the left hand of his right-hand\nneighbour with a silk cord bearing three luminous balls, and his left\nhand was controlled in a similar way. Unfortunately we are not told\nhow and in what position the cord was tied to the medium's hand,\nnor given the names of the sitters. Numerous phenomena occurred.5\nOn 28 and 29 April there were two sittings at Braunau, of which\nwe have two more or less independent affirmative reports.6\nBetween 30 July and 19 August 1926 Mr W. J. Vinton had six\nsittings with Rudi in Braunau, four at the house of the Schneiders\nand two at the Hotel Mittendorfer. In his report he attributes the\nphenomena to conspiracy between various members of the family.7\nThis allegation was replied to by Baron von Schrenck,8\nwhose re-\nmarks were criticised by Graf von Klinckowstroem.9\nIn the spring of 1927 we have another report of a sitting, this time\nnon-committal.10\nDr Prince had ten sittings, 12-24 August 1927, at the home of\n1\nProf. Hans Thirring, \"Psychical Research in Vienna,\" Joum.

At these\nsittings Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's method of electrical control\nof the medium was extended to all the sitters.2\nUnfortunately this\nmethod is very defective and deprives the series, and that next\nmentioned, of much, though by no means of all, their value. This\nmethod of control was criticised by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-\nSolovovo 3\nand Dr Woolley,4\nand defended by Professor Schiller 5\nand Mr Price.6\nBetween 14 November 1929 and 20 January 1930 Rudi gave a\nfurther series of twenty-one sittings at the National Laboratory.7\nMr Price's book includes various independent reports, of which only\ntwo need be mentioned, those of Captain F. McDermott 8\nand of\nLord Charles Hope.9\n. Dr Brack has published some theoretical con-\nsiderations arising out of these sittings. 10\nBetween 10 October and 14 November 1930 Rudi gave a series of\nsixteen sittings at the Institut Metapsychique, Paris, where he also\nspent the whole of 1931, with intervals, giving seventy-four further\nsittings. These ninety sittings form the subject of the valuable\nreport 11\nwhich is reviewed in the following pages.\nOn 31 July 1931 Mr Price and others had a sitting at Braunau.\nAll the doors and windows were sealed and numerous phenomena\noccurred. 12\n1\nHarry Price, in Psychic Research (1929), xxiii. 288a ; Rudi Schneider (1930),\npp. 4-5.\n2\nId., Rudi Schneider, pp. 7-48. 3\nJoum.

(1932), lix. 193-5.\n\f125] The Mednimship of Rudi Schneider 433\nII\nThe sittings at the Institut began very properly with a series\nof preliminary sittings \"pour voir.\" Nothing of special interest\noccurred during the first thirteen sittings, with the following excep-\ntion. At the third sitting Dr Osty observed coming towards the\nseance-table from the direction opposite to that of the medium, a\nthick greyish fog about 30 centimetres wide. When this fog reached\nthe edge of the table top the table moved slowly for more than 20\ncentimetres. Dr Osty, bent over this phenomenon, clearly observed\nthat the moment the table stopped moving the fog-like mass became\ninstantly invisible (p. 25).\nDuring the fourteenth sitting was first accidentally made the dis-\ncovery which eventually directed the entire course of this series of\nsittings. For purposes of control Dr Osty (for the sake of brevity\nI will abstain from saying each time Dr Osty and his collaborators)\nhad installed an apparatus which will be familiar to most readers\nfrom its use during the recent international exhibitions at Burlington\nHouse. Across the space to be guarded an infra-red (and hence\ninvisible) ray is directed at a suitable cell, which is placed in an\nelectrical circuit with, for instance, a bell, in such a way that if the\ninvisible ray ceases to impinge on the cell, as by the interposition of\none's hand, the circuit is completed and the bell rings. The same\napparatus can be connected with, for instance, a camera and flash-\nlight, so that an interruption of the beam causes the flashlight to be\nset off, thus exposing a previously prepared plate. Such a ray Dr\nOsty caused to be directed over the seance-room table, on which a\nhandkerchief had been placed with a view to obtaining telekinetic\nphenomena. It would thus have been impossible to obtain normal\naccess to the handkerchief without interrupting the ray and thus\nrevealing the fraud or accident.\nUnder these circumstances was held the fourteenth sitting, the\ncell being connected with the photographic apparatus. On two\noccasions during this sitting two sets of photographs (four cameras\nwere in use) were automatically taken by the interruption of the\ninfra-red ray. But when the eight negatives were examined nothing\nin the least abnormal was observed on them. In other words, the\ncause of the production of the instantaneous photographs was non-\nphotographable. The conclusion was inevitable that on these two\noccasions a \" substance \" had been present on the table, which\n\" substance,\" though not photographable, was capable of absorbing\nor refracting not less that 30% of the infra-red ray, this being the\ndegree of absorption or refraction necessary to put the apparatus\ninto operation (pp. 31-5). For the sake of brevity only absorption\n\f434 Theodore Besterman [part\nwill be spoken of ;\nbut, in fact, probably both, refraction and\nabsorption were at work.\nThis important discovery naturally opened the way to various\nlines of investigation. The first was to ascertain whether the absorp-\ntion of the infra-red ray was really due to the presence of a non-\nphotographable substance. This was achieved by connecting the\ncell with a bell which would ring during the whole time that 30% or\nmore of the ray was absorbed. The photographic apparatus was\nplaced in a self-contained circuit so that a flash could be made at will.\nDuring the fifteenth sitting, under these conditions, the bell rang\nrepeatedly for various periods up to 100 seconds. Photographs were\ntaken during these periods (that is, during the interruption of the\ninfra-red ray), without anything abnormal being recorded on the\nplates. Another point was established during this sitting : that the\nmedium has a degree of control over the entry of the substance into\nthe ray. He repeatedly announced that the force (as he calls it)\nwas about to operate, and these announcements were usually\nfollowed by ringing (pp. 36-41).\nThe next step was to register graphically the disturbances of the\ninfra-red ray. This was achieved in the following manner. In the\nelectric circuit producing the ringing there was inserted a small\nelectric lamp which was directed at a narrow slit in a box, behind\nwhich slit there passed continuously a roll of photographic paper.\nAccordingly, whenever 30% or more of the infra-red beam was\nabsorbed a circuit was completed which at the same time rang a bell\nand lit the lamp, which thus produced a line on the photographic\npaper. This amplified apparatus was put into use in the sixteenth\nsitting, and the previous results were confirmed. Again an addi-\ntional point was established : that the substance in question is\ninvisible, for a part of the sitting was held in good red light, during\nwhich the usual disturbances of the infra-red ray occurred without\nanything been seen (pp. 41-8).\nI now propose to pass over a long series of sittings, during which\nvarious experiments were conducted, some satisfactory, others in-\nconclusive, with a view to localising the substance, measuring the\nduration of its presence in the ray, and its density or volume, study-\ning the influence on it of various kinds of light, and the mental con-\ntrol over it of the medium. The account of these experiments\nshould be read at pages 51-110 of the report under review.\nI proceed to the experiments in which it was discovered that the\nsubstance does not usually enter into the infra-red ray, absorb a\ncertain percentage of it, and remain constant, but rather that,\nduring its presence in the ray, the substance as a rule oscillates very\nrapidly. This was established by the use of a sensitive galvano-\nmeter, which records minute changes in the electric current set up\n\f125] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 435\nby the absorption of the infra-red beam. It was found that the\noscillations of the substance in the infra-red ray range from 120 to\n420 per minute (pp. 111-6).\nNext a pneumograph was installed to measure and record the\nmedium's rate and volume of respiration. The volume showed\nnothing very exceptional. The rate of respiration, which, even\nwithout instruments, must have struck everyone who has sat with\nRudi, showed itself to be very remarkable. Whereas Rudi's ordinary\nrate of respiration is 12 to 14 per minute (which is quite normal), in\ntrance the rate is usually between 120 and 300 per minute, rising as\nhigh as 350. These two instruments, measuring the rate and vibra-\ntion of the substance in the infra-red ray and Rudi's rate of respira-\ntion, were then connected with a single recording apparatus, so that\nthey became available on one roll as parallel graphs. This led to a\nvery striking discovery : that the rate of vibration of the substance\nin the infra-red ray is always exactly double the medium's rate of\nrespiration. And as each respiratory cycle comprises two muscular\nacts (inspiration and expiration), it follows that the vibration of the\nsubstance in the infra-red ray synchronises with the medium's\nmuscular action in respiration (pp. 117-30). This fact clearly opens\nthe way to a vast field of research.\nI have so far said nothing about the evidential standing of these\nresults, nor do I propose to say much. MM. Osty describe at length\nin their report the precautions taken against fraud and accident (as\nby the use of a fixed screen between medium and sitters on the one\nhand and the apparatus on the other), and it is quite clear that fraud\nin the ordinary sense may be ruled out. There remains the possi-\nbility that Dr Osty and his collaborators are engaged in a fraudulent\nconspiracy. I have carefully examined the report under review from\nthis point of view and I have also had the opportunity of inspecting\nthe apparatus in situ and of putting a series of questions to Dr Osty.\nAs a result I am quite satisfied that even if Dr Osty and his colla-\nborators were engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy (an assumption\nit is a little difficult to discuss seriously) they would not have been\nable, under the conditions of these sittings, to reproduce the results\nobtained. To take only one example, it would appear to be to all\nintents and purposes impossible for the ordinary person to maintain\nfor hours on end (with short intervals) a rate of respiration in the\naverage fifteen times greater than normal. In congratulating MM.\nOsty on this contribution of capital importance to the study of para-\nphysical phenomena, I should like to thank them and Mile Galloy,\nwho took the notes at the sittings, for the kind and courteous way\nin which they answered all my questions.\nIf it is not improper to end on a personal note, I should like to put\nit clearly on record, as I have not hesitated to express myself in\n\f436 Theodore Besterman [part 125]\nprint on several occasions in terms very critical of all paraphysical\nphenomena, that I am satisfied, failing the discovery by the investi-\ngators of unforeseen circumstances, that the medium Rudi Schneider\ndid during the sittings under review extrude under partial mental\ncontrol an invisible and non-photographable substance capable of\npartly absorbing and\/or refracting an infra-red ray and of oscillating\nin it at a rate double that of his rate of respiration. At the same\ntime, in view of the revolutionary nature of the discovery, it would\nbe as well to suspend a final judgment until MM. Osty have had\nan opportunity of completing their investigations, and until the\nnecessary control experiments have been carried out.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nINDEX TO VOL. 40.\nFor the sake of brevity such qualifications as \" supposed,\"\n\" alleged,\" etc., are omitted from this index.
