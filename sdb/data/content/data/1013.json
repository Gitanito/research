I name no body.\nI HAVE, I believe, as true a Notion of the Power\nof Imagination as I ought to have, and you fhall\nhear farther from me upon that Head j I believe we\nform as many Apparitions in our Fancies, as we fee\nreally with our Eyes, and a great many more 5 nay,\nour Imaginations fometimes are very diligent to\nembark the Eyes (and the Ears too) in the Delufion,\nand perfuade us to believe we fee Spedlres and Ap-\npearances, and hear Noifes and Voices, when in-\ndeed, neither the Devil or any other Spirit, good\nor bad, has troubled themfelves about us.\nBut it does not follow from thence that there-\nfore there are no fuch Things in Nature > that there\nIS no Intercourfe or Communication between\nthe World of Spirits, and the World we live in>\nthat the Inhabitants of the invifible Spaces, he thofe\nwhere youpleafe^ have no Converfe with us, and that\nthey never take the Liberty to flop down upon this\nGlobe, or to vific their Friends here 5 and in ihort,\nthat they have nothing to do with or fay to us, or\nwe with or to them. The Enquiry is not, as I take\nit, whether they do really come hither or no, but\nwho they are that do come ?\nSpirit is certainly fomething that we do not\nfully underftand, in our prefenc confined Circum-\nflancesjand as we do not fully underfland the thing,\nfo neither can we diflinguifh of its Operations. As\nwe at prefent conceive of ir, 'tis an unreflrain'd,\nunlimited Beings except by fuch Laws of the invi-\nfible\n\fef APPARITIONS. 3\niible State, which at prefent we know little of; its\nway of converfing we know nothing of, other than\nthis, that we believe^ and indeed (be Reafon for itj\nthat it can a6l in an invifibleand imperceptible mari-\nner j it moves without being prefcrib'd or limited\nby Space, it can conie and not be feen, go and not\nbe perceiv'd j 'tis riot to be fhut in by Doors, or\nfhut out by Bolts and Bars; in a Word, it is un-\nconfined by all thofe Methods which we confine\nour Anions by, or by which we underfland our*\"\nfelves to be limited and prefcrib'd.\nYet notwithftanding all this, it converfes here^\nis with us, and among us 5 correfponds, tho' un-\nembodied, with our Spirits which are embodied j\nand this converfing is by not only an invifible, buc\nto us an inconceivable wayj it is neither tied down\nto Speech or to Vifion, but moving in a fuperior\nOrb, conveys its Meaning to our Underftandings,\nits Meafures to our Conceptions 5 deals with the\nImagination, and works it up to receive fuch Im-\npreffions as ferve for its purpofe; and yet at the\nfame time we are perfeftly paflive, and have no A^\ngency in, or Knowledge of the Matter.\nB Y this filent Converfe, all the kind Notices of\napproaching Evil or Good are conveyed to us^\n\"ivhich are fometim^S fo evident, and come with\nfuch an irrefiilible Force upon the Mind, that we\nmuft be more than flupid if we do not perceive\nthem ; and if we are not extremely wanting td\nour felves, we may take fuch due Warning by\nthem, as to avoid the Evils which we had No-\ntice of in that manner, and to embrace the Good\nthat is offer'd to us : Nor are there many People\nalive who can deny but they have had fuch\nNotices^ by which, if they had given due Atten-\ntion to them, they had been afiifted to fave them-\nfelves from the Mifchiefs which followed; or had,\noil the other hand| taken hold of fuch and fuch\nB 2, -Ad-\n\f4 The Hijlory and Reality\nAdvantages as had been ofFer'd for their Good: for\nit is certainly one of the grand and mofl: impor-\ntant Difficulties of human Life, to know whether\nfuch or fuch things, which prefent in our ordinary\nor extraordinary Circumftances, are for our good,\nas they feem to be, and as may be pretended, or not,\nand whether it is proper for us to accept them or\nno 5 and many unhappily ftand in the Way of their\nown Profperity, for want of knowing what to ac-\ncept of, and what to refufe.\nNow by what Agency muft it be that we have\nDire61:ions5 for good or foreboding Thoughts of Mif-\nchiefs which attend us, and which it is otherwife\nimpoffible we fhould know any thing of 5 if fome\nintelligent Being, who can fee into Futurity, had\nnot convey'd the Apprehenfions into the Mind,\nand had not caufed the Emotion which alarms\nthe Soul?\nAnd how fhould that intelligent Being (what-\never it is) convey thefe Forebodings and fudden\nIVIifgivings, as we rightly call them, mto the Mind,\nif there was not a certain Correfpondence between\nthem, a way of talking perfe6tly unintelligible to\nus, uncommon, and without the Help of Sounds or\nany other perceptible Way ?\nFor Spirits without the Help of Voice con'verfe,\nA S thus there is a Converfe of Spirits, an Intel-\nligence, or call it what you pleafe, between our\nSpirits embodied and cafed up in Flefh, and the\nSpirits unembodied 3 who inhabit the unknown\nMazes of the invifible World, thofe Coafts which\nour Geography cannot defcribej who, between Some-\n*where and No-where dwell, none of us know where^\nand yet we are fure muft have Locality, and for\nought we know, are very near us 3 why fhould ic\nbe thought fo ftrange a thing, that thofe Spirits\nIhould\n\fof APPARITIONS.\niliould be able to take upon them an Out-fide or\nCafe? why fliould they not be able, on Occafion, or\nwhen they think fir, to drefs themfelves up as we\ndo a U Mafquerade^ in a Habit difguis'd like Flefii\nand Blood, to deceive human Sight, fo as to make\nthemfelves vifible to us? As they are free Spirits,\nwhy may they not be like what my Lord Rochefier\nexpreffes in another Cafe,\n^ Spirit free to chufe for their own Share\nWhat Cafe of Flep and Blood they pleafe to wear ?\nRoch. Sat. againfh Man,\nI do not by this affirm that it is fo, and that a\nSpirit may thus aflume a real Cafe of Flefli and\nBloody for I refolve to affirm nothing that will not\nbear a Proof, and to fuggeft nothing without Pro-\nbability, in all this Work.\nBut it is enough to the prefent purpofe if theie\ninvifible Inhabitants can aflTume an Appearance, a\nForm fufficient to make them perceptible to us 5\nat the fame time not being at all veiled with\nany Subftance, much lefs of the Species which they\nreprefent.\nJ F they can aflume a vifible Form, as I fee no\nReafon to fay they cannot, there is no room then to\ndoubt of the Reality of their appearing 5 becaufe\nwhat may he we cannot but believe fometimes has.\nleen^ as what has been^ we are fure may be,\nT o fay that the unembodied Spirits can have no-\nthing to do with us, and that we have Reafon to\nbelieve they are not at all acquainted with human\nAffairs, is to fay what no Man can be afllired of,\nand therefore is begging the Queftion in the grof-\nfefl manner.\nI SHALL therefore fpend but very little time to\nprove or to argue for the Reality of Apparition.\nLet Mr. Qlanvilk and his Antagonifts, the Hobbifls\nB 5 aad\n\f4 The Hijlory and Reality\nand Sadduces of thofe Times, be your Dlfputants\nupon that Subje6t> nor fhall I trouble you with\nmuch Antiquity or Hiftory : a little that is moft\nunexceptionable may be neceflary. If there is an\ninvifibic World, and if Spirits refiding or inhabit-^\ning are allowed to be there, or placed there by\nthe fupreme governing Power of the Univerfej, it\nwill be hard to prove, that 'tis impoffible they\nfhould come hither, or that they (hould not have\nLiberty to fhow themfelves here, and converfe in\nthis Globe, as well as in all the other Globes or\nWorlds, which, for ought we know, are to be\nfound in that immenfe Space > Reafon does not\nexclude them. Nature yields to the Poflibiltty,\nand Experience with a Cloud of Witnefles in all\nAges confirm the Reality of the affirmative.\nThe Queflion therefore before me is not fo\nmuch whether there are any fuch things as Appari-\ntions of Spirits 5 but WHO, and WHAT, and\nfrom WHENCE they are 5 what Bufinefs they\ncome about, who fends them or dire6i:s them, and\nhow and in what manner we ought to think and\naft, and behave about them, and to them j and this\nis the Subftance of this Undertaking.\nThe Angels are faid to be mimftring Spirits^ and\nwe know they have been made ufe of (as fuch) on\nmany Occafions, by the fuperior Appointment of\nhim that created them ; why then it may not be\nthought fit by the fame Power, to make or fubili-\ntute a Miniftration of thefe unembodied Spirits to\nthe Service of the embodied Souls of Men, which\narc alfo God's Creatures, we cannot tell.\nUpon what foot, and to what end, either on\ntheir Side or on ours, and from what Appointment,\nis very difficult to afcertain 5 and yet fomc probable\nGuefles might be made at ittoo, if it was the proper\nWork before me 5 but I am rather adjufting the\nFaft, and afcertaining the Reality of Apparitions in\ngeneral^\n\fof APPARITIONS. f,\ngeneral, than inquiring into the Reafons of them 5\ncither the Reafons in Nature, or in Providence,\nwhich are perhaps farther out of our Reach than\nfome People imagine.\nIt is as difficult too to determine whether the\nSpirits that appear are good or evil, or bothj the\nonly Conclufion upon that Point is to be made from\nthe Errand they come about y and it is a very juft\nConclufion, I think 5 for if a Spirit or Apparition\ncomes to or haunts us only to terrify and affright,\nto fill the Mind with Horror, and the Houfe\nwith Diforder, we cannot reafonably fuppofe that\nto be a good Spirit j and on the other hand, if it\ncomes to dircd to any Good, or to forewarn and\npreferve from any approaching Evil, it cannot then\nbe reafonable to fuppofe 'tis an evil Spirit.\nThe Story of an Apparition diflurbing a young\nGentleman, at or near Camhridge^ is remarkable to\nthis Purpofe: He fet up, it feems, for a kind of\nprofefs'd Atheifm; but hearing a Voice, fuppofed\nit was the Devil fpoke to him, and yet owned that\nthe Voice afTured him there was a God^ and bid him\nrepent. It was a moft incongruous Suggeftion that\nthe Devil fhould come Voluntier to an Atheift, and\nbid him repent 5 or, that the Devil lliould with a\nlike Freedom affert the Being of a GOD.\nI F then it was a real Apparition of, or a Voice\nfrom an invifible Spirit 5 (Ifay\/\/, becaufe it might be\na Phantom of his own Imagination) it mufl be from a\ngood Spirit, or from an evil Spirit over-rul'd by a\nfuperior and beneficent Power j and if that were to\nbe fuppofed, then it would juflify our taking far-\nther Notice of thofe things called Voices and\nApparitions, than I fhall venture to advife.\nTh?: Poffibility however of Apparitions, and the\nCertainty of a World of Spirits, as I can by no\nmeans doubt, fo I fhall take up none of your\ntime tQ ^nfwer the Objections and Cavils of other\nE 4 \u2022 People\n\f8 The Hifiory and Reality\nPeople about it 5 becaufe I think the Evidence will\namount to a Demonftration of the Fa6tsj and De-\nmonltration puts an end to Argument.\nCHAP. I.\nOf Apparitions in particular^ the Reality\nof them^ their Antiquity^ and the T^iffe-^\nrence between the Apparitions of former\nTimesy andthofe which we may call Modern ;\nwi^th fomething of the Reafon and Occafion\nof that T>ijference,\nOTHING can be a ftronger Teflimony of\nthe Reality of Apparitions m General, than\nto defcend to the particular Appearances which we\nare afllir'd have been fcen and conversed with from\nthe fuperior World. And firft I begin with fuch\nas have been evidently from Heaven it felf, and by the\nfoveraign Appointment of Providence upon extraor-\ndinary Occaiions. And tho' Ifhall trouble my Rea-\nders with as little as poffible out of Scripture, ef-\npecially at the Beginning of my Work, becaufe I\nam unwilling they ihould throw it by, before they\nread it out, which there would be fome Danger of,\nif I fhould begin too grave\nYet, as I cannot go back to Originals, or be-\ngin at the Beginning, without a little Hiftory\nput of thofe ancient Times, you mufl bear with\nmy jull naming the Sacred Hillorians. I'll be as\nfliort as 1 can.\nNothing is more certain, if the Scripture is ac\nall to be believed among us, than that God him-\nfelf was pleafed, in the Infancy of Things, to ap-\npear Vifiblyj and in Form, to feveral Perfons, and\non\n\fof APPARITIO NS.\non feveral Occafions, upon Earth j afluming or\ntaking up the Shape of his Creature Man, when\nhe thought fit to converfe with him, that he niighc\nnot be a Terror to him.\nThus ^dam was frequently vifited in Eden^\nand we have no room to doubt but it was in a\nvifible Form, becaufe Jdam both heard him fpeak,\nand as the Text fays, \"They heard the Voice of the\nLord God walking in the Garden in the Cool of the\nDay. Gen. iii. 8.\nB Y all the Hiilory of the Antediluvean World,\nwe have reafon to believe, that as God did fre-\nquently fpeak to Men, fo he as frequently appeared\nto them \u2022, for we find they converfed with God Face\nto Face. Cain^ tho' wicked, talk'd with God, and\nGod with him, when he was charg'd with the Mur-\nther of his Brother Abels and the Text is exprefs.\nGen. iv. 1(5. that after it, Cain went out from the\nPrefence of the Lord. So that God not only fpoke\nto him by a voice, but was Vifible and Prefent to\nhim.\nAnd as I muft carry the Devil along with me,\nhand in hand, in every Period of Time, fo even in\nParadife the Devil aflum'd a Shape. For we nioil\nallow Satan to be a Spirit, and indeed, we have\ngood reafon to fay he is a Spirit.^ free to Chuse\nwhat Cafe of Flefh and Blood he pleafes to put on^\nor at leaii: feemingly to put on.\nThus he without doubt fpoke in the Mouth of.\nthe Serpent in the Garden, or elfe took upon him-\nfelf that Shape, tho* the former is the mod proba-\nble 5 becaufe the Serpent was curil for being but\nthe Inftrument, however paffive he might be.\nMr. MILtON makes no doubt of the Devil's\nafluming a Shape of any kind, Beafi as well as Ma-n^\nwhen he brings him in v\/hifpering to Eve in her\nSleep, and placing himfelf clofc at her Ear, in the\nShape of a Toad, which he cxprefTes in his Sub-\nlime\n\flO The Hijlory and Reality\nlime Poem, and with that inimitable Manner, pe-\nculiar to himfelf.\nFirst he brings Satan leaping over the Mound\nor Fence, which God had placed round the Gar-\nden, as a Wolf leaps over the Hurdles into a\nSheep-fold 5 and being gotten into Paradife, he\nplaces himfelf upon the Tree of Life, in the Shape\nof a Raven or Cormorant. There's the Devil's firft\nApparition.\nThence he views the whole Garden, and all\nthe Creatures in it, and at laft he fpies Jdam and\nEve^ to his great Surprife. But after a while fpent\nin admiring their Form, their Beauty, Felicity and\nInnocence, as he refolv'd to ruin them, fo he comes\ndown from the Tree to be nearer them^ and\nmixing among the Cattle, where he takes upon\nhim now one Shape, then another, as it beft\nfuited him, to be near Jdam and Eve, and yet to\nbe unperceived by them 5 this the Poet defcribes^\nthus 5\nT'ben from his hfty Stand on that high Tree^\nDown he alights among the \/portful Herd\nOf thefe four-footed Kinds -y himfelf now one.\nNow other, as their Shape heft ferv'd his End\nNearer to view his Prey^ and unefpfd\nI'o mark what of their State he more might learn.\n\u00ab *\n^bout them roundj\nA Lion now he ftalks with fiery Glare -^\nThen as a Tiger,\nMilr. Parad. lib. IV. ver. 3pf\nAgain, when he makes the Angels find Satan, as I\nhave obferved, wbifpering evil Thoughts to Eve in.\na Dream, and in her Sleep, he fays,\nHim\n\fp^\nof APPARITIONS.

And he left off talking with him^ and God\nwent up from Abraham, 'Tis undeniable that God\nappeared, and was with him, and left off talking\nwith him, and went from him: all Marks of a via-\nble Apparition.\nAgain, Chap, xviii. here it is ftill more ex-*\nplicit, and God not only appeared, but appeared\nin a Human Shape. Ver. i . And the Lord appeared\nto him in the Plains of Mamre^ as he fat in the\nDoor of his Tent. Fird 'tis faid, he lift up his Eyes\nand looked, and behold, three Men Hood by him.\nSo vilible were they, that he entertains them,\n2 invites\n\fJ 2 The liiftory and Reality\ninvites them to Dinner, and prepares a fat Calf to\nbe drefs'd, and Cakes, and Butter, and Milk.

Behold now 1 have\ntaken upon me to fpeak unto the Lor d, which am\nhit Duft and Afloes.\nThus I think 'tis evident, that God himfelf\ndid appear in Humane Shape to Abraham^ and that\nmore than once. The next Chapta* is as plain, that\nhe did the fame to Lotj or if it fhould be obje-\n6ted that it is not fo clear that it was God himfelf,\nit was two Angels 5 tho' Interpreters do generally\nagree, that it was Chrift himfelf, who is called\nan Angel, the Angel of the Covenant. But if that\nwere doubtful, then it will ftill be allow'd that ic\nwas an Apparition of Angels in Human Shape,\nwhich will Itand good in my next Article.\nBut as I am upon the Highelt and Supreme\nInllances fi^rftj 1 mull finilTi it by two particular\nQaoU-'\n\fof APPARITIONS. 13\nQuotuions, which cannot be difputed. (i.) One is\nof Jacobs Gen. xxxii. 24. Inhere wreftled a man with\nhim: and ver. 28. the Man is laid to be God him-\nfelf, as a Prince haft thou Power with God, and haft\nprevailed : and ver. :^o. after he had blefled him,\nJacob caird the Place Peniel^ that is the Face of\nGod, For, fays he, \/ have feen God Face to Face,\nAgain Jacob fays. Gen. xlviii. 7,, God Almighty ap-\npeared to me at Lii% in the Land of Canaan^ and blef-*\nfed me.\n(2.) But there is yet a ftronger Teltimony than\nall this, for it is fpoken from the Mouth of God\nhimfelf upon a very particular Occafion,, which was\nto honour Mofes^ and eftablifh him in the Reve-\nrence and Regard of the People, when the Se^\nventy Men or Elders were appointed to take Pare\nof his Work off his Hands, and judge of fmaller\nMatters among the People 5 which is nobly ex-\nprefs'd. Numb. xi. 17. ihey fhall hear the Burthen\nof the People with, thee. In the next Chapter Miriam^\nand even Aaron himfelf, fpake againft Mofey^ that is\nin fhort rofe in Rebellion > and God, to honour his\nServant, tells them how he had, and would diftin-\nguifh Mofes from all the reft. ver. 8. With him will\nI fpeak Mouth 10 Mouthy even Apparently, and\nnot in Dark Speeches^ and the Similitude of the hoKU\nJhallhe Bk HO L.D.\nHere is a poiicive Declaration from Heaven,\nthat God would appear viiibly to Mofes -y the like\nInftance is not to be {een in the whole Bible. The\nWord Apparently is plain, it can be no otherwifb\nunderftood, without grofs Equivocating with the\nText.\nCome we next to the Times of our Bleffed Sa-\nviour, and there we have two eminent Appear-\nances within the Compafs of our prefent Argu-\nment.\nI. The\n\ftA The Hijlory and Reality\nI. The Holy Ghost appearing in the Shapfi\nof a Dove.\n2,. T H E Appearance of Jesus Christ after his\nRefurredion, when in the glorify'd Body where-\nwith he afcended 5 and that this was an Apparition,\nis plain, from the feveral Circumftances of his Ap-\npearance.\nFIRST^ When he join'd the two Difciples go-\ning to Emaus : that he appear'd as a Man, the Text\nis plain from his walking with them, and Difcourfe\nto them i and that it was but an Apparition is\nalfo plain. Luke xxiv. 16. Their Eyes wsre holden\nthat they Jhould not knoiv him : and ver. t, i . when their\nEyes were opened to know him he vanilhed out of\ntheir Sight.\nSECONDLT^ When he appear'd to Mary Mag-\n^^\/^;? at the Sepulchre, but forbad her to touch him,\nJohn XX. 17. And again ver. ip. when he came\ninto the Room where the Difciples were aflembled,\nand when the Doors were fliut, and faid, Peace be\n\"\nunto to you. Thus it is evident Chriil has appear'd,\nand he has told us he fhail appear again, coming\nin the Clouds of Heaven > and we look for that\nblcfTed Hope, and glorious Appearing.\nThus then you have God himfelf, Father^ Sort\nand Holy Ghoft^ appearing in diftin6t Times, in fe-\nveral Shapes or Forms of Appearance, all giving\nTeftimony in general to the Reality of this Truth,\nThat Spirits can affume Humane or other Shapes,\nand be made vifible to Mankind j and this is what\nwe call Apparition.\nHaving thus brought an Inftance of the moft\nexalted Kind, even the Appearance or Apparition\nof God himfelf, 'tis needful to ftate a little the\nDifference between thofe Appearances, and that\nwhich we are now to difcourfe of.\n'Tis an Objection natural to the Cafe in hand,\nWe do not queftion, much lefs enquire, whether\ninfinite\n\fof APPARITIONS.\ninfinite Power, to whom all things are not poffiblc\nonly, but eafy, can afflime a Humane Shape, or any-\nother j and appear, when^ where^ how^ and in\nwhat Form he thinks fie j and that he has, or may-\nhave fo appeared. But there is a manifeft Difference\nbetween what God is able, or may pleafe to do up-\non extraordinary Occafions, and what any of his\nCreatures may or can do.\nBEsit)ES 'tis evident, or at leafb we have rea-\nfon to believe, that God himfelf did appear in thofc\nTimes upon thofe extraordinary Occafions only,\nand that he has never appear'd finccj except that\nIhould be call'd an Appearance or Apparition which\nfpoke to St. Paul at his Converfion, when it is ex-\npreily faid, he faw a Light, and heard a Voice, but\nlaw no Man 5 tho' afterwards he calls it feeing him,\nI Cor. XV . 8 . Lafi of all he was feen of me alfo. Wh ere-\nas St. Paul^ we all know, did fpeak there of leeing\nChrifl in the Flefh, while he was on Earth. But\n1 fay, except this, we have no Example of any\nAppearance of the Divine Majefty in Humane\nShape, or in any other manner whatfoever.\nThat therefore we mud diftinguifh this from\nthe Subjeft we are now entering upon, for that the\nAppearances of God are extremely different from the\nApparitions of Creatures, whether Angels, Devils,\nor Souls of Men. That the Qiieftion is not. Whe-\nther God can do this or that j but. Whether the Spi-\nrits, Spirits Inferior, can do it : and, which is yet\nmore to our Purpofe, Suppofe it has been fo for-\nmerly, and in ancient times, whether they do con-\ntinue to do fo Hill, or have power to do it, let\nthe Occafion be what it will.\nThus the Enquiry is reduc'd to a narrower\nCompafs. I take upon me the Affirmative^ and we\nare now to look back into Time for the Confirma-\ntion orProof of it, and by enquiring what has been,\ninform our felves of what may be, is, or is to be\nexpeflied, as occafion may require. And\n\fThe Hijiory and Reality\nAnd firft to defcribe the Thing, and explairt\nwhat is generally underftood by the Apparition of\nSpirits i that 1 may not hold you in Sufpence, or\nCriticife upon the bare Words Spirit and Appari^\ntion^ I come plainly to the Meaning, as I am to\nbe underftood in this Work : By Apparition of Spi-\nrits, then, I mean, when the Invilible Inhabitants\nof the unknown World, be they who they will,\naflume Humane Shapes, or other Shapes, and fhow\nthemfelves vifibly to us, fo as that we can fee them,\nfpcak to them, hear them fpeak, and the like.\nThis is what our People vulgarly call Walking ^\nand when any fuch thing appears, they know not\nwhat otherwife to call it, they fay Something walks-,\nand if it be the Appearance of any known Perfon\nlately dead, ' they fay Sucb a one Walks.\nThus I lay every thing down with the utmoft:\nplainnefs, that I may leave the Reader in no Un-\ncertainty about my Meaning in the Subject 1 am\nupon, or give room for Cavilings or Difputings,\nat either the Thing it felf, or the manner of Ex-\npreffing ti.\nWe fpeak in Vain\nOf I'ruth it felf^ unlefs *we fpeak it Plain.\nWords wrapt in Clouds^ till theirfull Meanings known^\nSuch Words are not the Hearer's^ but our own*\n^he End of Speakings loft\nFor Speech was ginjen to he underftood.\nAsking Pardon for giving this Loofe to my\nThoughts, I return to the Subje6b, left I fhould\nbe but an Apparition ray felf.\nThe Apparitions I am to fpeak of are thefe.\n1.

II.\nOf the Appearance of Angels immediately in\nMiffion as from Heaven ; and why we are\nto fuppofe thofe kinds of Apparitions are at\nan End.\nTHAT Angels have appeared to Men, we have\nabundant Teflimony in the Hiflories of\nTimes Paft, as well Sacred as Prophane j nor fhall\n1 fpend one Moment of your Time to examine, or\nconfirm it, except as it comes neceflarily in by\nthe occafion of other Difcourfe: For it is not the\nAppearance of Angels as fuch, but the Appearance\nof Angels in the Shape of Men, that is the prefenc\nEnquiry.\nThat this has been, is evident, and in general\nthe Scripture gives this Teflimony to it: when the\nApoflle advifes to Hofpitality, and to entertain\nStrangers, he adds, For thereby fome have entertain''\nAngels unatvares, Heb. xiii. 2. This mufl be meant\nof Angels in Humane Shape, otherwife the hofpi-\ntable Perfon could not be miflaken in fuch a manner:\nBefides, it plainly refers to Abraham^ Gen. xviii. i.\nfitting in the Door of his Tent, n)er. 1. three Men\nflood by himj two of thefc were certainly Angels j\nwho the third was, I have fhcwn already. It may\nlikewife include Lot^ in whofe Story, Gen. xix. it is\nexprefs'd, ver. i. that they were two Angels, and\n'ver. 8.

' ip\n, These Apparitions of Angels, in the Shape of\nMen, are undeniable on other Occafionsj but when\nthey appear as Angels, it is find fo plainly, and in\nfo many Words 5 as in the Cafe of Abraham^ when\nhe was going to offer his Son Ifaac^ Gen. xxii. 11.\n^he Angel of the Lord called to Abraham out of Hea-^\n'ven-y and again ver. if. The Angel of the Lord called\nthe fecond time.\nThere are innumerable Examples of Angels\nappearing as Angels 5 but we are upon the Ap-\npearance of Angels as Men, and in the Shape and\nHabit of Men. The next Inftance is, of an Angel\nappearing to Jofbua^ and who is called the Captain\nof the Lord's Hoft, Jofh, v. 13. Jofhua looked^ and\nbehold there flood a Man over-againfl him^ with a\nSword drawn in his Hand. Immediately Jojhua^ Sol-\ndier-like, gives him the qui viise^ or in Englifh^ who\nare you for? art thou for us, or for our Adverfaries?\nand the Spectre or Apparition fpoke immediately\nagain, ^ver. 14. and then Jofhua perceived that it\nwas not a Man, but an Angel in Apparition j and\nin the Heads or Contents of the Chapter, 'tis ex^\nprefly faid, an Ar>gel appears to Jofhua.\nAnother Example is, of the Angel that ap-\npear'd to Manoah the Father of Sampfon\\ his Wife\nindeed calls him a Man of God, and that he ap-\npeared to her J but fays, that his Countenance was\nlike an Angel of God, very terrible j Judges xiii. <5.\nBut flill when he appeared a fecond time, it was in\nthe Shape of a Man, or elfe why did Manoah de-\nfire him to ftay 'till he could drefs a Kid for him ?\nand the Words are exprefs, ver. 16. He knew not\nthat it was an Angel of the Lord,\nThere are other Examples in Scripture, where\nthe Angels have appeared in Humane Shape, and\nconvers'd with Men upon Earth, befides fuch as\nhave appear'd in their real Angelick Form as An-\ngels. How and in what they were known to be\nC i Angels,\n\f20 The Hijlory and Reality\nAngels, in what Form they have been fecn, and in\nwhat Voice they fpoke, is not difcover'd to us in\nthe Scripture. Some are of Opinion, that even\nthofe Angels appear'd in the Shape of Men, and\ncloathed as Men 5 as the Angel that met Balaam\nwith a flaming Sword in his Hand 5 the Angels\nW^hich Jacob faw afcending and defcending on the\nLadder J the Angels that fpoke to Zacharias in the\nTemple, to the Virgin Mary in the Chamber,\nand that fat in the Sepulchre after Chrift was rifen,\nand asked the V>'\\^Q.\\^\\t%^'why feek yc the Living among\nthe Dead? and fo in feveral Cafes: All that can b&\nanfwer'd is, that the Text call'd them Angels, and\nfo far we are not to doubt it > but I muft alfo al-\nlow, that they fcem to me to have been in the\nFigure of Menj as for thofe in the Sepulchre,\nSt* Luke fays exprefly, they faw two Men in fhining\nGarments, Luke xxiv. 4. and in the fame Chapter,\nver. 25. 'tis faid, they had feen a Vifion of Angels.\nThus far it relates to good Angels, fuch as\nhave been feen on Earth in Apparition, but have\nmade fuch an Appearance by vertue of the fuperior\nMiflion, as the Angel Gabriel^ who tells Zacharias^\nJamfent to fpeak unto thee.\nThat thefe have upon many occafions been\nfecn in Humane Shape is evident > and tho* much\nmore time might be fpent upon the Proof, I think\n^tis needlefsj indeed the Evidence is fufficient.\nThere is a Queftion ftill remaining, relating\nto this Part, (viz) How comes it to pafs that all\nthis is ceafed, and that the Angels have done\ncoming, or arc no more fent offuch Errands ? but t hat\nall the Angels we have any Account of in thefe\nDays, are of a worfe kind, and generally come\nupon worfe Errands ? and which particular Obfer-\nvation is the very reafon of our Doubts, whether\nthe Appearance of the other is real or not.\nThis\n\fof APPARITION S.

The Scripture is a daily Revelation,\nand the Spirit of God, who is promifed to lead us,\nis a daily Infpiration, there is no more need of\nVifion and Apparition > and this is that glorious Dif-\nference between the Revelations of thofe Days,\nand thefe of ours, and the reafon of the Difference\nbetween the Apparitions of thefe Times and of\nthofe.\nWhen I am fpeaking things ferious, I am to\nfpeak very ihort, that 1 may not fhock your rea-\nding J the Tafte of the Times happening at this Jun-\nfture to lye another way : but my next Article per-\nhaps may make you amends, I mean the Appear-\nance of the grand Arch-Angel of all, and, as I fup-\npofe, the only Arch- Angel out of Heaven, namely\nthe Devil\nCHAP. III.\nOf the Appearance of the Devil m\nHumane Shape,\nPRAY obferve, when I am fpeaking of the Ap-\npearance of the Devil, it is not to tell yoa\nthat he can and does appear among us at this\ntimej fo you need not look over your Shoulders\nXo fee for him, or at the Candles, to fee\nC 5 if\n\f11 The Hifior*^ and Reality\nif they burn Blue, at leafl not yet 5 'tis time\n'\nenough for that by and by.\nBut I am examining now the matter of Fa\u00a3t\nonly, as (i.) Whether the Devil can appear here, yea\nor no 5 whether he is allow'd to come, that his Chain\nreaches fo far, and that his Tether is long enough?\nalfo, (i.) Whether he is ever fent or dire6bed to\ncome, or that he comes of his own accord, and a-\nbouthis own Bufinefs? \/\\nd as all thefe will lead me\nto enquire what has been 5 from thence we may\nbeft judge, what is, or may be.\nThat he has upon fpecial Occafions appeared\nin former Times is certain, as well from Scripture as\nancient Hiftory, and a fmall Retrofpe6i: will fatisfie\nyou in that Point. If it appears that he has been\nhere, then 'tis very probable his Chain is long e-\nnough, and that he is allow'd the Liberty to come\nfo far from Home. P'or we have no Authority to\nfay, or to believe, that his Tether is fhorten'd, or\nthat he is more reftrain'd now than ever he was\nbefore.\nHis cntring the Garden of God in the begin-\nning of Time, and the Havock he made there, the\nturning Adam and Eve out, and even turning the\nwhole frame of Nature upfide down by his vile\nDoings there > all this I have mentioned : But we\nhave more yet to fay of him j for he is ftill in Being,\nand ftill the fame malicious Devil, the fame De-\nftroyer and Accufer that ever he was ; the Flame of\nFire fet to guard the Garden, did not burn him 5\nthe Deluge didn't drown him : Nor has Juftice\nthought fit yet to take him into its Iron Hands,\ntho' it will certainly do it at laft> and, as the Scri-\npture fays in another Cafe, his Damnation flum-\nbereth notj for Juftice is truly reprefented\nfVith Leaden Feet and Iron Hands^ to Jhow\nIt will h certain, tho* it may he Jlow.\nThe\n\fof APPARITION S. ij\nThe firft time we meet with the DeviPs per-\nfonal Appearance upon Earth, I mean after the\nFlood, is in the Story o^ Job\\ nor by all the Cal-\nculations of Times, which the learned Chronolo-\ngers of thoie Days have made, could that be long\nafter it 5 for Eliphaz the Temanite could not be far-\nther off than the Grandfon of Efau^ or thereabouts.\nGen. xxxvi. 11.\nI N Joh\\ Time, the Text fays that the Sons of\nGod came to prefmt themfelves before the Lord^ and\nSatan came alfo among them. So that it feems the Angel\nof Light was drefs'd up like the Sons of God,\neven in thofe ancient Days 5 and it is not likely that\nthis was the firft Time neither: Again, it feems\nby the Text, that tho' God himfelf might know\nSatan in that Difguife, yet the People, among whom\nhe came, did not know him.\nThe Anfwerlikewife which he makes to the Que-\nftion, implies ftrongly, that Satan had been wont\nto walk among thofe Sons of God in Difguife long\nbefore that > for when God fays to him, 'whence\ncomeft thou ? his Anfwer feems to be a kind of gene-\nral, I come from following my known Bud-\nnefs, my old Trade > doeft thou know I am a roar-\ning Lion, and doeft thou ask me whence I come?\nWhy, I come from feeking who I may devour,\nranging the World, going to and fro in the Earthy\nand ^walking up and down in this Difguife, as thou\nnow feeft me, that I may do all the Mifchief I can.\nGod's Return again to Satan confirms it, as if\nthe Lord had faidj Well, Satan, then thou muil\nhave feen my Servant Job ? Hafl thou confidedd him,\nt}oat there is none like him in the Earth ? '\nThe Devil makes an Anfwer that implies he\nknew Job very well. Do 1 know him to be a good\nMan ! yes : But then I know him to be a rich Man\ntoo: 'Tis an eafy thing for a Man to be honeft,\nthat is fo rich 5 he Qan have no room for asking\nC 4 more:\n\f14 7^^^ Hijlory and Reality\nmore : What fhould he fteal for, or be a Knave for,\nthat is the richeft Man in the World? Whatfhould\nhe covet, that has no room for Defire ? But if thou\nhaft a Mind to try his Honefty, and his Piety, his\nFear of thee, and his Hatred of Evil, blaft his\nWealth, and take his prodigious Flocks and Herds\nof Cattle away J level him, bring him to be like\nother Men in Riches, and reduce him to Beggary,\nand then fee if he won't be like other Men in Crime 5\nnay, he'll be raging and furious, and curfe thee to\nthy Face,\nThis, tho' it may feem remote, is to my Pur-\npopfe thus : it fhows that the Devil was no Stran--\nger among the People. He had walk'd up and\ndown in Difguife, fo as to know them all, and their\nCircumftancej He had been drefs'd up like one of\nthe reft in Human Shape, fo that he could not be\nknown from the very beft of Men, no not from\nthe Sons of God.\nSome are of Opinion, by the Sons of God there,\nis meant the patriarchal Heads of Families, who had,\nin right of Primogeniture, the Priefthood in Courfe,\nand were the only Sacrificers at that Time, as Jhra^\nham^ and as Job were s fo that in fliort Satan has long\nago drefs'd himfelf in the Habit of the Clergy. Blefs\nus all! we hope he does not do fo ftillj for if the\nDevil fhould put on the Gown and CafTock, or the\nblack Cloak, or the Coat and the Cord, and be\nwalking about the World in that Difguife now,\nhoweafilymay we be cheated, and miftake the Sons\nof God for the Prince of Darknefs? and how\nC0UJ4 we tell one from t'other ?

To fpeak as diftin6bly of this nice\nPart as I can, admit me to explain my felf a little.\nIf we grant that Spirit, tho' invifible in it felf,\nmay aflume Shape, may veft it felf fo with Flefh\nand Blood, that is feemingly, fo as to form an Ap-\npearance,\n\f5 7^^ Hiftory and Reality\npearance, then all Spitic may do it 5 fince we have\nno Rule given us by which we may diflinguiih\nSpirits one from another, I mean as to their a6k-\nings in the Capacity of Spirits : Wc may indeed,\nas I have faid already, diftinguifh them by the Ef-\nfeft, that is to fay, by the Errand they come on,\nand by the manner of their Operations, as whe-\nther they are good or evil Spirits 5 but not by\ntheir Nature as Spirit. The Bevil is as really\na Spirit, tho' a degenerated, fallen, and evil\nSpirit, I fay, he is as much a Spirit to all the In-\ntents and Purpofes of a Spirit that we are capable\nto judge of, as an Angel 5 and he is called the evil\nSpirit i He has Invifibility, and Multiprefence,\nas a Spirit has 5 he can appear tho' the Doors be\nfhutj and go our, tho' bolted and barr'd in 5 no\nPrifon can hold him, but his lad eternal Dungeon j\nno Chains can bind him, but the Chains faften'd\non him by Heaven, and the Angel of the bottom-\nlefs Pit j no Engine or human Art can wound him 5\nin fhort, he is neither to be {ttx\\^ felt, heard, or\nunderftood, unlefs he pleafes j and he can make him-\nfelf be both feen and heard too, if he pleafes 5 for\nhe can afTume the Shape and Appearance of Man\nor Beaft, and in thefe Shapes and Appearances can\nmake himfelf vifiihle to us, terrify and affright us,\nconverfe in a friendly or in a frightful manner\nwith us, as he thinks fit; he can be a Companion\nand Fellow-Traveller in the Day, an Apparition\nand a horrible Monfter in the Night : in a Word,\nhe can be among us, and a6t upon, and with us,\nvifibly or invifibly as he pleafes, and as he finds\nfor his purpofe.\nNow if he does, and can do thus, roeerly as he\nis a Spirit, and by his fpiritual Nature, we have\na great deal of Reafon to believe, that all Spirit may\ndo the fame J or at leaffc I may ask. Why may not\nall Spirit do the fame ? and if there are any Kinds\nof\n\fof APPARITIONS. 31\nof Spirit, as is not improbable, befides thofe we have\nhitherto conceiv'd of, they may be reafonably fup-\npofed to be vefled with the fame Powers, and may\nexert thofe Powers in the fame or a like manner.\nI F any Man asks me how I make out the Pro-\nbability of thefe differing Species of Spirits? I an-\nfwer as above, by this. That it appears there are\ninvifible Operations and a fecret Converfe carried\non among Men from the World of Spirits, where-ever\nthat is, which cannot, at lead to our Underflandings,\nbe fuppofed to be the Work either of thofe particular\nor proper Angels which refide in Heaven, or the in-\nfernal Angels either j that thefe Spirits, or if you pleafe\nto call them Angels, appear and converfe for Good,\nand therefore may not be fuppofed to be the De-\ni;\/\/, or from the Z)m\/; It is faid indeed, that they a6t\nby a vifible kind of Reftraint, in doing Good with\nafort ofanImperfe6tion and manifeft Debility j foas\nfometimes to a6i:, as it were, to no purpofe, being\nnot able to make the Good they aim at efFedual,\nand therefore cannot be from Heaven, the Foun-\ntain of Good J who, as he is Good, fo he is in-\nfinitely able to do all the Good thnt he appears\nwilling to do : But this, I think, confirms rather\nthan confutes my Opinion j for, it proves them to\nbe fent, and under particular Commiffion ; it only\nfuggeils, that 'tis probable there are Spirits who\nmay be more confin'd and reftrain'd in their Power\nof ading, fome than others, and this is not at all\ninconfiftent with the Nature of the thing.\nThe great, and perhaps the llrongeft Argu-\nment which our learned Men produce for the\nCredit of their new Philofophy is, that by this\nthey can the better folve the Difficulties of feve-\nral other Phosmmena^ which before were hardly\nintelligible, or at leaft which they could not ac-\ncount for any other way.\nIn\n\f3 % The Hijiory and Reality\n1 N like manner, tho' the Certainty of my Sug-\u00bb\ngeftion cannot be arrived to, or fuppofing it can-\nnot, and that at beft it is but a Speculation^\nfcarcely can be called an HypotheJiSj and that no\nEvidence can be given for it, yet this muft be faid of\nit, that by this Notion we may folve feveral other\nDifficulties which we cannot underftand any other\nWay : fuch as^\nFIRS'T^ How it is, and from whence, or by\nwhofe Agency we frequently receive fuch kind No-\ntions of Good or Evil as 'tis certain we do, and\nyet without receiving any farther Afliftance, which\nperhaps it is not in the Power of the kind Infor-\nmer to give us, cither for the avoiding or embracing\nthe Evil or the Good which they give us No-\ntice of ?\nWhat can it be that communicates thefe ap-\nproaching diflant things, and which it is fo much\nour Intereft and Concern to know? If it were an\nevil Spirit, I mean a Devil^ as I have faid above, he\nwould never concern himfelf fo much for our Bene-\nfit, feeing he is known to will our Ruin to the ut-\nmoft of his Endeavour, and to wifh us to fall into\nall poflible Mifchief and Difafter.\nO N the other hand, it cannot be from Heaven\nor from the Angels > for the Works of God are all,\nlike himfelf, perfect, and he would not fo far dilho-\nnour his Mefiengers, as to allow them, nay to fend\nthem (for they could never come unfent) to give-\nus Notice of Evil, and yet take it out of our Power\nto avoid its o^* to foretell good things at hand, and\nthen give us no Power to embrace them, or to lay\nhold of them-, and it would neither confift with\nthe infinite Goodnefs, or with the infinite Juftice,\nto do thus by his Creatures.\nBesides, 'tis a kind of incongruous ading, un-\nworthy of the fupreme Power, unworthy an An-\ngel's appearing i it rather fhews that it is the Pro-\n4 du\u00a3t\n\f0f APPARITIONS. 3J\ndu\u00a3t of fome intelligent Being, who tho' it means\nGood, and has a beneficent Nature that would\ncontribute to our Safety and Profperity if it could,\nyet is under fome Limitations of its agings, is not\nable to proceed in the Good it has attempted, that\ncan juft do us fo much Service as to give us Notice\nof what may await us behind the dark Curtain of\nFuturity 5 but has no Power to go any farther, or\nto give any Afliftance to us in purfuing proper Me-\nthods for our Deliverance 5 no, not fo much as to\ngive Dire<5i:ions, much lefs Powers to a6t 5 as\na Child difcovering a Fire begun in a Houfe,\nmay cry out and alarm the Family, but is able to\ndo no more, no not fo much as to tell them where-\nabout it is, or which way they fhould go about to\nefcape from it, much lefs to quench or prevent it.\nThese imperfeft Notices, I fay, feem to proceed\nfrom fome good and kind Being, which is near us,\n.cxifting, tho* out of our Knowledge, yet not fo\nremote, but that it is in Condition to fee and\nknow things good or evil, which tho' approaching,\nis yet out of our View, and which, if we could\ntake the filent Hint, it might be infinitely for our\nAdvantage, but is able to do no more.\nNow, if fuch Notices, whether to the Mind\nby Dreams when afleep, or by wakinglmpulfc, orby\nVoice, or by Apparation 5 if they were from Heaven\nthey would never be fo imperfe(5b and unaffiftingj\nwe cannot fuppofe Heaven would concern itfelf to\ngive us Notices of Danger impending, of Enemies\nlying in wait, of Mifchicfs approaching, and would\nthen leave us to fall into the Snare by an unavoid-\nable Neceflity.\nAs to what thefe Spirits therefore are, where\nthey refide, what Circumftances they are in, and\nhow they have accefs to our Underllandings, I ac-\nknowledge the Difficulty to be great, and do not pre-\ntend to enter upon it here 5 that they may foraetimes\nappear is not improbable : But I hope I may fay,\nD that\n\f34 The Hifiory and Reality\nthat all Apparitions are not the Devil^ nor yet may\nthey be Angels immediately from Heaven, for ma-\nny Reafons.\nTIRSf^ From the Meannefs of the Occafions, I\nmean of fome of the Occafions, on which thcfe\nthings happen. That there are Angels fent from\nHeaven on particular Meflages and Errands, to ful-\nfil the Mind and Will of their Maker and Sove-\nreign, all Men muftgrantj I have already prov'd it,\nand abundance of Examples may be given of it, bc-\nfides thofe already named j but we never find thofe\nAngels coming upon trifling Errands, and for things\nof mean Import. I^he Angel of the LO RD appear'd\nto Gideon at the Threfhing-floor, to fummon him\nto the Deliverance of the whole Nation of ISRAEL :\nThe Angel of the LO RD appear'd to David with\nhis drawn Sword, threatning Deftruftion to JerU'\nfalem : The Angels appear'd to the Shepherds to fig-\nnify the Birth o\u00a3 C HRIST', as an Angel had done\nto the Virgin to falute her, and tell her what great\na Work was to be wrought in her : Angels ap-\npear'd to miniftcr to CHRIS f after his Temp-\ntation in the Wildernefs> and an Angel appear'd\nftrengthening him in his Agony, and Angels have\nappear'd on many other fuch eminent Occafions 5\nbut not except fuch Occafions were eminent, and\nthat particularly fo.\nBut here you have an old Woman dead, one that,\nit may be, has hid a little Money in the Orchard or\nGarden J and an Apparition, is fuppos'd, comes and\ndifcovers it, by leading the Perfon it appears to,\nto the Place, and making fome Signal that he\nfliould dig there for fomewhatj or a Man is dead,\nand having left a Legacy to fuch and fuch, the\nExecutor does not pay it, and an Apparition comes\nand haunts this Executor 'till he does Juftice. Is it\nlikely an Angel fhould be fent from Heaven to find\nout the old Woman's earthen Difh with thirty or\nforty Shillings in it ? or an Angel fhould be fent to\nharrafs\n\fof AFP A Rn IONS. 3 J\nharrafs this Man for a Legacy of perhaps five or\nten Pounds? and as to the Be'vil^ will any one charge\nSatan with being follicitous to have Juftice done ?\nthey that know him at all, muft know him better\nthan to think fo hardly of him.\nWho then muft it be? and from whence? To\nfay it is the Soul or Ghoft of the departed Perfon,\nand that he could not be at reft, 'till the injured\nPerfon be Righted, is advanc'd upon no Principle\nthat is agreeable to the Chriftian Dodrine at all;\nfor if the Soul is happy, is it reafonable to believe\nthat the Felicity of Heaven can be interrupted\nby fo trivial a Matter, and on fo flight an Occafion ?\nif the Soul be unhappy, remember the great Gulph\nfix'dj there is no room for us to believe that thofc\nmiferable Souls have any Lcifure or Liberty to come\nback upon Earth on an Errand of fuch a Nature.\nIn a word, there is nothing but Difficulty in it on\nevery fide ; Apparitions there are, we fee no room\nto doubt the Reality of that Part j but what, who, or\nfrom whence, is a Difficulty which I fee no way to\nextricate our felves from, but by granting that there\nmay be an appointed, deputed fort of ftationary Spi-\nrits in the invifible World, who come upon thefe Oc-\ncafions, and appear among usj which Inhabitants or\nSpirits (you may call them Angels if you pleafc) Bo-\ndies they are not, and cannot be, neither had they\nbeen ever embodied 5 but fuch as they are, they have a\nPower of convcrfing among us, and particularly with\nSpirits embodied, and can by Dreams, Impulfes and\nftrongAvcrfions, move our Thoughts, and give Hope,\nraife Doubts, fink our Souls to-day, elevate thcn\\\nto-morrow, and many ways operate upon our Paf-\nfions and Affe6tions 5 may give Intimations of Good\nor Evil J but cannot, thro' fome unknown Reftraint\nupon their Power, go any farther, fpeak any plainer,\nor give the leaft Affiftanceto us, no, not by Council\norDiredion to guide us or tell us how to ad for our\nQWn Prcfcrvation. D 2 I\n\f3^ The Hiftory and Reality\nI A M told that thefe may be good Angeh for all\nthat, and that it is no juft way of arguing, to fay\nfuch things are too trifling to fend an Angel from\nHeaven upon fo mean an Errand, and upon fo in-\nconfiderable an Affair > fince we fee Providence\ndaily giving Teftimony, not of its Government\nonly, but of its Care and Concern, in and about\nthe meaneft Affairs of Life: and that the Scri-\npture it felf frequently gives Examples of it, in bis\nfeeding the Ravens, taking care of the Sparrows,\nclothing the Grafs of the Field, numbring the\nHairs of our Head, ^c. So that Infinite is not li-\nmited or ty'd up, to or from any degree of afting.\nNor is there anything great, or any thing fmall, but\nas God is feen in his leaffc Creatures, Infefc, Mites,\nand the likej fo he is a6tive in the moft trifling\nEvent : Nor does that Providence, who yet pro-\ntefts us in, and delivers us from Danger, always a\u00a3t\nalike, but as the Sovereignty of his Actings is not\nto be difpuced, fo neither is his Wifdom impeach'd\nby fuffering Evil to fall upon Man, which the\nleafl hint from his Light might have guided him\nto prevent.\nI THINK this is the utmofl that can be faid in\nthe Cafe, ai:fd yet it does not reach us at all 5\nfor this is not the meaning of my Objeftion, no,\nnor is it the Subftance of it 5 I am not fpeaking of\nProvidence concerning it felf in the Care of its\nCreatures, I acknowledge all that s but then this Pro-\nvidence a\u00a3ls in its own Way, and by its own invifi-\nble Operations 5 nor is. there any occafion for the\nAgency of fuch extraordinary Inflruments, and\ntherefore it may be, that Angels are never fent as\nJ ExprefTes upon fuch Things.\nThe King or Government of a Nation may in-\nfluence the whole Body of the People, at what-\never Diflance, by the Power of his Laws, direding\n.,the Magiftrates^ and the Inferior Officers, to aft in\nthe\n\fof APPARITIONS. 37\nthe Name of the Supreme > and this is done with-\nout any Step out of the ordinary way of the Admi-\nniilration. But if any extraordinary Occafion re-\nquire, then a MefTenger is difpatch'd with particu-\nlar Inftruftions, and fpecial Power, as the particular\nCafe may require.\nSo Providence,(which is, in a word, the admini-\nflration of Heaven's Government in the World)\na6i:s in its ordinary Courfe, and in the ufual Way,\nwith an univerfal Influence upon all Things, and\nnothing is below its Concern j but when extraordi-\nnary Things prefent, then the particular exprefs\nMelTengers from Heaven, {viz. the Angels) Tre fent\nwith Inflrudtions on that particular Affair which\nthey are difpatch'd about, and no other. And I may\nventure to fay, thefe are never fent upon Trifles,\nnever fent but on extraordinary Occafions, and to\nexecute fome Ipecial Commiffions and this comes\ndiredtly to the Cafe in hand.\nI N the next Place I demand, when cou'd it be\nfaid, or what Example can be given, where an\nAngel from Heaven has been fent to give any par-\nticular Perfon Notice of approaching Dangers, and\nat the fame time left the Micid unalarm'd, and in a\nftate of Indolence, not capable of rouzing it felf\nup to fhun and avoid the Danger threaten'd, or\nwithout Diredtion and Afliftance to prevent or ef-\nc^pe it 5 this is what I alledge is unworthy of the\nDivine Wifdom and Goodnefs.\nLook into all the MefTages or Notices that have\nbeen given from Heaven on fuch Occafions, in all\nthe Hiftories of the Scripture, or almoU elfewhere,\nand you will fee the difference evidently. Take a few\nfor Example.\nTwo Angels are fent to Sodomj not only to de- .\nftroy the City for its Wickednefs, but to fave Lot,\nWell, they come to him, they tell him what they\nare about to do, and that they are fent to do itj\nD 5\nnamely.\n\f3 8 The Hiftory and Reality\nnamely, to burn the City. This might have been\nenough J\nand perhaps, had it been notic'd to him by\nthe Spirits I am fpeaking of, this had been all 5 and\nif Lot had not taken their kind Information, it had\nbeen his own Faulty nay, as it was, the Text fays.\nLot lingered, and 'tis plain he left the City with a\nkind of Relu\u00a3tance.\nBut the kind Mcflengers do not fatisfie them-\nfelves with giving him the Warning, but they roufe\nup his Indolence. See Gen.xix. 12. Hafi thou any\nJjere ? any that thou haft a Refpedt for, or Interefl\nin, bring them out of this Place, ver. 13. We will\ndeflroy this Place. There's a hint of the Danger\napproaching, and which is a wife Dire6l:ion what\nto do, but this does not fatisfie; the Man is\nnot barely caution'd, and dire6bed, but he is to be\nfav'dj and therefore the beneficept Hand is not\ncontent to allarm and counfel him 5 bur, vcr. if.\nWhen the Morning arofe they haflen^d L o t 5 they\njftirred up his unconcern'd Temper, Arise, left\nthou be confuni'd in the Iniquity of the City ; and even\nthis being not enough, for Lot linger'd ftill,and, as\nIfaidjfeem'd loth to leave the Places they as it were\ndragg'd him out 5 ver. 16. they laid hold of his\nHand, and upon the Hand of his Wife, and upon\nthe Hand of his two Daughters, and brought him\nforth, and fet him without the City 5 and what is\nthe reafon of all this ? the Words are exprefs, the\nLord being merciful to him.\nThe reft of the Story is well known; when\nthey had brought him forth, they let him know he\nwould not be fafe even there 5 but adds, Efcape\nfor thy Life, look not behind thee ; Nay, he tells\nhim whither he fliould go, 'ver. 17. Efcape to the\n; Mountain left thou be confum'd.

No, no 5\nThis Meffage was frorfi Heaven, who never gives fuch\nNotice of Evil, and then leaves us unallarm'd, undi-\nrefted, fupine and eafie, 'till it falls upon us without\nRemedy} the Angel adds prefently. Arise and\ntake the young Child and his Mother, and flee into\n^gypt, and be thou there ^till I bring thee Word.\nThus you fee the Nature of the Divine Pro-\nceedings, the efFe&ual manner of Notices from\nHeaven 5 the Danger is told, and then the Way to\navoid iti and always with a hailing Allarm, Up,\nget thee out of the Cityj Arife, flee into jEgypt^\nand the like.\nA N o T H E R is in the Story of Peter in the Prifon\nan Angel is fent to deliver him, ^i^jxii. and what does\nthe Angel do ? a Light fhin'd in the Prifon, and he\nfmote him on the Side 5 this was to awaken and\nalarm hiraj this, and a Light to fhow him the\nWay, was fufficienc to have put him upon trying\nto efcape.

No\nAffiftance given him to rouze up his Spirits to take\nthe Alarm : He is not led by the Hand, and told)\ngo not into the Senate Houfe^ as was done for Lot-^\nefcape for thy Life, The kind Monitor does not\nname the Traytors and AlTaflinators to him, and fay\nBrutus^ and Caffius^ Cafca^ and others, wait there to\nkill you 5 as the Angel to Jofeph^ Herod will feek the\nyoung Child to deftroy him.\nAnd on the other fide, C^y^r,bold and unalarm'd,\nindolent, and having things not fufficiently explain'd\nto him 5 (and the good Spirit, as may be fuppos'd,\n^able to do no more for him j) goes on, enters the\niScnate Houfc, mocks the Southfayer, and tells him\nthe\n\fof APPARITIONS. ^^\nthe Ides of March are eome^ who iharply returned.\nBut they are not pafi.

V.\nOf the Appearance of departed Unembo^\ndied Soul,\nI\nNOW come to the main and moft difputed\nPart of fhadowy Appearance, viz, the Appari-^\nlion of Unembodied Soul.\nI T is a material Difficulty here, and ought to be\nconfider'd with the utmoft Plainnefs, (viz.) what\nwe mean by Unembodied Soul-, whether we under-\niland Souls which have been encas'd in Flefli, but be-\ning unhous'd are now moving about, in what State\nwe know not, and are to be fpoken of as in their\nfeparate Capacity: Or whether there is any fuch\nthing as a Mafs of Soul, as a learned but pretty\nmuch inconfiftent Writer calls it, which waits to\nbe embodied, as thefuperior Difpofer of that Affair,\n(be that who or what he pleafes) may dire6b.\nT H I s I confefs is to me fomething unintelligi-\nble, looks a little Platonick^ and as if it were a-kin\nto the Tranfmigration-Whimfie of the Ancients 5\nbut if they would found it upon any thing rational,\nit mufl be upon the Suggeftion mentioned above,\nviz. of a middle Clafs of Spirit, neither Angclick-\nHeavenly, or Angelick- Infernal : But Spirits inha-\nbiting the invifible Spaces, and allow'd to a\u00a3t and\nappear here, under exprefs and greatly llrain'd Li-\nmitations, fuch as are already defcrib'd, and of which\nmuch more may (till be faid.\nBut that I may clear up your Doubt as to the\nPart I am upon, I have added at the Head of this\nSeftion, the Word Departed^ to intimate to you,\nthat I am Orthodox in my Notion j that I am none\nof the Sed of Soul- Sleepers, or for imprifoning\nSouls\n\fof APPARITIONS. 4f\nSouls in a Limhus of the Ancients $ but that, in i.\nfew Words, by the Appearance of Souls Unembo-\ndied, I mean fuch as having been embodied or im-\nprifon'd in Fleih, are difcharg'd from that Confine-\nment, or as I call it unhous'd and turn'd out of\nPofTefSon. For I cannot agree that the Soul is in\nthe Body, as in a Prifon 5 but rather that, like a rich\nNobleman, he is pleas'd to inhabit a fine Country\nSeat or Palace of his own Building, where he\nrefolves to live and enjoy himfelf, and does fo, 'till by\nthe Fate of things his fine Palace being over-turn'd,\nwhether by an Earthquake or otherwife, is bury'd\nin its own Ruins, and the noble Owner turn'd out\nof Pofleflion, without a Houfe.\nThis Soul, we are told, and I concur in the O-\npinion, has fometimes made a Tour back into this\nWorld 5 whether Earth, or the Atmofphere of the\nEarth, call it where you will, andexprefsithowyou\nwill, it matters not much: Whence it comes, how far\nthe Journey, how, and why it came hither, and a-\nbovc all, how it goes back again, and what thofe\nvarious Apparitions are which counterfeit thefc\nSpirits: enquire within, and you fhall know\nfarther.\nThat the Unembodied Souls of Men Dead,\nas we fay Departed, have appeared, we have af-\nfirm'd from the Authority of the Scripture 5 which\nI muft allow to be an authentick Document, what-\never the Reader may pleafe to do; 'till a Hiftory\nmore authentick, and of better Authority may be\nproduc'd in the Room of it.\nAs to the Appearance of Samuel^ rais'd by the\nWitch, I defpife it, as it is ofJer'd in the Capacity\nof a Soul, much more as the Unembodied Soul of\nSamuel i which tho' it might have been caus'd to\nappear, as the Sovereign of all Spirits, with whom\nthe Soul of Samuel is at Reft, had thought fit ; yet\ncould no more be fummon'd from that Reft, by\nthe\n\f4(J The Hijlory and Reality\nthe Conjuration of an old Witch, than the Devil\ncould fetch it out of Heaven by Force. Nor was it\nlikely that God, who refus'd fo much as to fpeakto that\nabandon'd Prince, whom he had fo righteoufly re-\njefted, and that would anfwer him neither by tfrim^\nor by fhummimy that would neither hear his Prayer,\nor accept his Offering, would hear a Witch, a\nCreature likewife fentenc'd to Death by his own\nrighteous Law, and fend Samuel at her Infernal\nPaw-wawing from Heaven, to tell Saul that to-\nmorrow he fliould be cut in Pieces by the Phili-\nftines'y there feems to be no Confiitency at all\nin it, no, none at all.\nThe Appearance of the Thing call'd Samuel^\nwas, in my Opinion, neither more or lefs than a\nPhantafm or Spedre, which (as the Devil is allow'd\nto do) might perfonate the old departed Prophet,\nand who, at the Witch's Summons, and by Hea-\nven's Permiflion, came up to pronounce the dread-\nful Sentence upon Saul^ and let him fee what was\nthe Effedt of his forfaking God, and rejefting his\nProphet Samuel. And thus it might be allow'd alfo\nto fpeak in the firft Perfon of the Prophet, as it\ndidj nor do 1 fay, or think, as fome do, that it was\nthe Devil in Samuel's Likenefsj if it had, 'tis not\nlikely the old Woman would have been fo frighted\nas to cry out, feeing fhe was better acquainted\nwith the Devil, than co be furpriz'd, if it had been\nher old Familiar.\nBut fhe faw fomething flie did not cxped, and\nperhaps had never feen before j for fhe tells the\nKing, fhe faw Gods afcending out of the Earth\nby which I cannot but underftand, fhe faw fome\nof thofe Spirits which I have mention'd, which\nare not Infernal, and who might forefee what the\nDevil himfelf cannot 5 for I have no reafon to be-\nlieve that Satan knows any thing of Futurity.\nIf\n\fof APPARITIONS. 47\nI Fit be asked here, by what Authority the Witch\ncould bring up one even of thefc Spirits 5 that in-\ndeed may be difficult to anfwer, other than thus,\nthat it might be as Balaam was over-rul'd to blefs,\nwhen he intended to curfe j and that at her Call,\nand to pronounce the approaching Fate of Saul^\nand IJrael V7ith him, Ihc might be over-rul'd, andfo\ncaird up, or call'd in, a good Spirit inftead of the\nDevil.\nA s for the Speftre's fpeaking in the Name of\nSamuel in the Scripture, and the Text reprefen-\nting it as if it were really Samuel himfelf, i Sam.\nxxviii. If. Jnd S^v[m\u20ac[ \/aid to Saul, why haft thou\ndifquieted me^ to bring me up ? I take it to be an Ex-\n-prQ&on ad Hominem^ to the common Underftanding,\nand to be underftood as all Allegorick or Figurative\nExpreffions are underftood 5 and it no more proves\nthat it was Samuel^ and is no more to be taken lit-\nterally, than the other Words in the fame Verfc\nare to be litterally underftood.\n1 JVHT haft thou difquieted me ? as if it was in\nSauVs Power, by the Conjurations of an ab-\nhorr'd condemn'd Limb of the Devil^ a profcrib'd\nWitch, to difquiet the departed Soul of Samuel \\\nthe Meaning is no more than this, What is your Bu-\nfinefs with me, what do you trouble me for? You\nthat defpifed me, and afted contrary to all my Di-\nredtions, and would go on in your Perverfenefs in\nfpite of me, and of all I could fay to you 5 what\ndo you come to me for, now I am dead ^.\n2. TO bring me up? intimating that Samuel was\nbelow, or was called ab Inferis, which is contrary\nto Reafon as well as Religion, and neither confifts\neither with our Notion, or any body's elfe, except it be\nthe Soul-fleepers, who tell us, the Soul fleeps with\nthe Body in the Grave 'till the Refurreftion 5 and if\nfo, then muft the old Woman have had Power to\nawake him whenever fiie plea&'d.\nf Upon\n\f48 The Mifiory and Reality\ntf\" p o N the whole, ic feems this Woman, was a\nWitch of fome Eminency, and had more than or-\ndinary Power in her way. For when Saul applies\nto her, fhe asks him^ Whom {hall I bring up? inti-\nmating that fhe was able to bring up who fhe\nwould, either from Heaven or Hell,\nThis Boldnefs plainly infers, that fhe had no\nPower at all, but thisj that being a Witch, and one\nthat had a Familiar Spirit^ fhe could caufe her Familiar\nor Devil, call it what we will, to appear and perfonate\nwho fhe pleased to name. For why fhould not the\nDen)il be as able to drefs himfelf up like one dead\nPerfon, as another ? and why not appear as well in\nthe Shape of a dead Man, as of a living One?\nS o that to me there is no more Difficulty in his\nDreffing himfelf like Samuelythan there was in calling\nhimfelf fo^ or than fpcaking in the firfl Perfon of\nSamuel^Tis above 5 Why difquiet Me, and why bring\nME up ? All that feems inexplicable in it is, how he\nfhould be able to tell Saul what fhould happen,\n(viz.) that God would deliver Ifrael into the\nHands of the Philifiines^ and him (Saul) with them,\nand that to-morrow he fhould be with him 5 that is,\namong the Dead, fhould be killed in the Battel.\nThis indeed has fomething difficult in it, becaufe\nthe Devil is not allow'd to be a Prophet, or able to\npredift what is to come. But thefe things may be\nall anfwer'd by the Story of Balaam^ where the\nwicked Creature, tho' a Wizard, and a Conjurer,\nyet was dire6ted, not only to blefs Ifrael in fpite\nof all the Gifts and Rewards that the King o^ Moab\noflFer'd him, but was enabled to prophefy of Chrift,\nand foretel the glorious appearing of the Meffiah\nNumb. xxiv. 17. Ipallfee him but not now, IJhall\nbohold him but not nigh j 'There Jhall come a Star out\nof Jacob, and a Sct^iQX fhall arife out <?\/ Ifrael 5 and\nagain, out of Jacob fhall come he that Jhall have\nDominion. This was a plain and dired Prophecy\nof\n\fof APPARITIONS. 49\nof Chrift, who is call'd in the Revelations the\nMorning-Star 5 and yet this Balaam was a Witch,\na Dealer with an Evil Spirit, and receiv'd the Wages\nof Unrighteoufnefs.\nThe next Teftimony which we find in facred\nHiftory, of the Reahty of Apparitions, as it refpefts\nthe Souls of departed Perfons, is the Appearance of\nMofes and EUas with Jefus Chriji in the Mount, at\nhis Transfiguration 5 they not only were there, really\nand perfonally, in their Habits, and fo as to be known\nto the Difciples, but they appeared talking with\nChrillj fo that it was a Perfe<5b and Compleat Ap-\nparition, (viz,) the particular Pcrfons appearing, and\nknown by the Perfons to whom they appeared.\nMat. xvii. 3. And in another Place, the manner of\nthe Apparition is defcrib'd, as alfo what they talk*d\nof, Luke ix. 38. Who appeared in Glory^ and talked\nof his Deceafe^ which he Jhould accomplijh in Jeru-\nfalem.\nThis is fo plain and unqueftionable an Appear^\nance of departed Souls, that they who difpute it,\nmuft not only doubt of the Divinity of Scripture,\nbut muft difpute its being an authentick Hiftory j\nwhich its Enemies will hardly deny.\nWE have yet another Teftimony, and this is as\npofitive and exprefs as the reft 3 Matth. xxvii. fz.\nAnd the Graves were opened^ and many of the Bodies\nof the Saints which Jlept arose, and came out of the\nGraves after his RefurreBion^ and went into the holy\nCityJ\nand appeared unto many.\nThis is a remarkable Place, and Vv^^ould admit of\na long Expofitionj but I muft not preach, and if I\nmight, I am no Annotator 5 as far as it is to my\nprefent Purpofe, the Bodies arofe^ that was extraor-\ndinary j but that their Souls were alfo with their\nBodies, is not to be douted, at leaft by me 5 for I\nhave no Notion of the Body walking about without:\nthe Soul, nor do we cyer read of bodily Apparitions.\nE An\n\fJ o The Hiftory and Reality\nA N Apparition is vulgarly call'd by us a Ghofl,\nby our Northern People a Gheji-y now the Ghoft is\na Spirit, and the Apparition of a Spirit has fome\nSenfe in itj the Spirits alfoafTuming a Shape or Body,\nwhether Real, or in Appearance only, has fomething\nin it to be talk'd about 5 but the Apparitions of\nBody, moving, appearing, walking, or whatever we\nnnaycall it, without Soul or Spirit, is what was ne-\nver heard of, and fcarce ever fuggefted.\nFt may be obferv'd, that thofe Apparitions quo-\nted from the Scripture, are not Apparitions in Vifi-\non y Dreams in the Night, or fuppofed Appearances\nonly, but plain, open, day-light Vidonsj the for-\nmer would not be to my purpofc at all. Thefe\nwere Apparitions that were fpoken to, and con-\nverfed with 5 and this is a Proof of what I al-\nledge, viz. that Spirits Unembodied may appear,\nmay reafTume humane Shape, their own former\nLikenefs, or any other, and may fhovv themfelves\nto the World, or to as many Perfons as they pleafe.\nThe Difficulties which attend this are not a few,\ntho' none of them dcllroy the thing it felf; as (i.)\nWhether the Souls of good or bad People unembo-\ndied, are really in a State or Condition for fuch an\nAppearance? and whether it confifts with the juft\nNotions we ought to have of the unalterable State?\n1 mean fuch Notions as conform to the Scripture,\nwhich, if the Parable of the rich Man and Lazarus\nbe a juil Reprefentation of it, fcems impoffible to\nbe, except on fuch an extraordinary Occafion as\nthat of our Saviour's Transfiguration and Refur-\nre^tion 5 that is, by Miracle.\nL^Z^RUS^hjs the Text, was, upon his Death,\ncarried by the Angels into AbrahanC^ Bofom > the\nrich Man died, and in Hell he lift up his Eyes.\nThat this is fuppos'd to be immediately, is evident,\nbecaufe the rich Man fpeaks of his Brethren that\nwere then alive: If he was not carried thither im-\nmediately,\n\fof APPARITION S. ji\nmediately, he would certainly not have been carried\nthere at all 'till after the Great Audits fo that ic\nwas plain he was there prefently after his Death i\nand that Lazarus was carried immediately to Hea-\nven is evident alfo j becaufe the rich Man is brought\nin feeing him there, and defiring he may be fent\nto him.\nT o fay this is but a Parable, is to fay what may\nbe granted without Prejudice to the Point in hand*\nFor as it is a Parable, it would not have been ap-\npofite, if it had not reprefented things as they were\nreally to be 5 it would have been a Delufion, and\nbrought to deceive j whereas it is a Parable of our\nLord's own bringing, and all thofe Parables that\nChriit uttered, were the moft perfect Reprefentati-\nons and Illuftrations of the things which they were\nbrought to fet forth 5 nor is any one of them lame\nin their Allufions, but infl:ru6tive in every Articlcf\nas the Parable of the Prodigal Son, for Example,\nand the Parable of the King making a Marriage for\nhis Son, and fo of the refl. And why muft this a-*\nlone be lame, and unapt for the purpofe ?\nI F then this Parable is fuited to reprefent the State\nof the Souls of the Departed, thofe Souls then can no\nway be concern'd in the Apparitions which we are\nfpeaking of5 except as is before excepted, mz. oil\nfuch extraordinary Occafions, as that of our Savi=*\nour above muft be acknowledg'd to be.\nIf then, neither the Souls or Spirits oPtheBlef-\nfed or the Curfed, the Happy or Miferable, the\nSav'd or the Condcmn'd, are concern'd in thoie\nAppearances, who then are thefe Inhabitants of the\ninvifible World ? What are they that conftitute and\npoflefs this World of Spirits, Xo much talk'd of?\nAnd if the immenfe Spaces are taken up, if they\nare peopled by any fpirituous Creatures, if any\nthing but Stars and Planets range through the\n\u20acm^ty Place^ as Job calls it. Job xxvi. 7. what are\nE i theyj\n\fThe Hijiory and Reality\nthey, and what are the Spirits that inhabit thofe\nWorlds?\nThere muft certainly be a World of Spirits,\nor of Spirit, from A^'hence we receive the frequent\nVifits in Publick, and the frequent Notices in Pri-\nvate, which are fo perceptible to us, and which we\narc fo uneafy about : if they are neither good Spirits\nor bad, if they have neither Power to do us Good\nor Hurt, as I fee a great deal of Reafon to believe,\nthen we have not fo much Reafon to be terrified\nabout them as we generally are : but of that here-\nafter.\nA s to the Locality of the Devil^ and his Ap-\npearance, that indeed is another Article, and he\nmay, as is [aid already^ cover himfelf with what\nShapes, human or brutal, he pleafes > but then\nthis would bring all Apparition to be by the Ap-\npearance of the Deinl^ and all the Empire of the\nAir to be poflefs'd by him j which I cannot grant\nParticularly, becaufe, as I faid, fome of thcfc\nApparitions come of good Errands, to prevent Mif-\nchief, to prote6t Innocence and Virtue, and to dif-\ncover Injury, Injuftice and Opprcffioni all which\nare things very much out of the Devirs way, re-\nmote from his Pra6lice, and much more remote\nfrom his DcCign: The Spirits I fpeakofmuft be of a\nhigher Original 5 they muft be Heaven-born, of the\nglorious Original of angelick Species; and as all\nthings are known by their Confequences, fo they\nare known by their Aftingsj they do Heaven's\nWork, are under his immediate Government and\nDirc6lion, and are honoured with his fpecial Com-\nmiflion; they are employed in his immediate Bufi-\nnefs, namely, the common Good of his Creature\nMan : They that do Good, demonftrate in the beft\nmanner that they are good.\nSo that every way we fhould meet with fome\nDifficulty in this Cafe, unkfs folv'd, as I faid before,\nby\n\fof APPARITIONS. 53\nby the denominating another Clafs of Spirits nei-\nther immediately celeftial, or at all infernal 5 neither\niCmbodied, or that have been embodied, or that ihall\never be embodied.\nIt cannot be expefted I fhould defcribewhat thefe\nare, and in what Condition; it is fufficientthat I only\nfay Such may be there, and that they may be fuch\nas he thinks good to place there who made that\nempty Place j I may as well ask (he Enquirer '\nwhat fort of Inhabitants they are who pof^\nfefs the Moon or any of the Planets, and whether\nthey dwell in a State of Innocence, or have con-\ntraAed Guilt ; and if the latter, whether there is a\nglorious Eftablifhment of Redemption, and a Co-\nvenant of Life granted for them, as there is here,\nby the Purchace and Merit of a Saviour ?\nIt is no fair Queftion to ask me a Demonftra-\ntion for an Hypothejis > or is it reafonable to tell mc\nthey will not believe it, becaufe I cannot prove the\nAffirmative of what I do not affirm.

VI.\nOfthe Manner How the Spirits of every Kind,\nwhich can or do appear among us^ manage\ntheir Appearance ; and How they proceed,\nTHE Poflibility being thus fettled, and it being\ngranted that Spirits, or detach'd Angels, do\nconverfe with Manldnd vifibly as well as invifibly,\nand have Accefs to us, to our Souls as well as Bo-\ndies, as well by fecret Communication, as by open\nand publick Apparition; it remains to enquire into\nthe Manner how this Converfation is carried on.\nI HAVE already entred my Proteft againfl all\ntliofe Arts calPd Magical and Diabolic, by which\nMan is made capable (at lead) of being Aggreflbr in\nthis Communication, that he can call up thefe Spi-\nrits, or call 'em down rather, and begin the Con-\nverfatioQ when he pleafes.\nWhether by Compaft and fecret Hellifli\nFamiliarity with the Devil he may not obtain Leave\nto ufe Satan with fuch Freedom, I will not deter-\nmine; I doubt he may : for the Devil may depute\nfuch and fuch Powers and Privileges to his Confe-\nderates, as to his Honour in his great Wifdooi\nfhall feem meet : But that he can empower them\nto do the like with thofe good and beneficent\n|\nSpirits of the invifible World, who are (I have fup-\n*\npos'd) Spirits, not Devils^ that I deny, nor do I fee\nany Reafon t6 grant it.\nI COME then to the Manner the Spirits, which\nI would fuppofe may inhabit the utmoft Wafte,\nare ^ble to correfpond with us : and firft, as Spirits\nor\n\fof A?P ARltlONS, 19\nor Angels, call them as you will, they are to be fup-\npofed, like other Spirits, to have an extenfive\nKnowledge, and a View of all created Subftances,\nat leaft on this fide Heaven \\ a vaft capacious Un-\nderflanding, an unbounded Sight, a Liberty of Lo-\nco-motion, paffing from one Region to another,\nfrom one Planet to another 5 they are not congeal'd\nby Cold, or calcin'd by Heat; that they are able\nto exift in all Climates, even from Saturn to Mer-\ncury \\ that they may go and come, appear and dif-\nappear, here or where elfe they pleafe j in a word,\nthat they are free Agents, as well in their Motions\nas A6lings. Hence they are neceffarily to be fup-\npofed to know all things needful to he known, re-\nlating to us, as well as to other things j that they\ncan take Cognizance of human Affairs, and that\nnot by Grant or Licenfe, or by fecond hand Infor-\nmation from Hell, from the infernal Spirit, or any\nother Place, but by their own angelick and fpiri-\ntuous Penetration 5 and that they have no Depen-\ndance upon Satan, or any Power or Perfon con--\ncern'd with him 5 that they a6b alfo as Spirit on all\nOccafions.\nTho' we fee nothing of them, they fee us 5 tho'\nwe know nothing of them, they know and arecon-\nverfant about us, are capable of being affedted and\nmoved in our Behalf, and to concern themfelves for\nour Good on many Accounts : Hence they often\ngive us Notices and Warnings of Evils attending\nus, tho' they cannot afl: fo upon material Obje6ts,\nas to interfere with our Affairs, over- rule our\nFate, or direft us how to avoid the Evils which\nthey forefee, or to embrace the Good which they\nfee attending us; of which, and the Reafons of it, I\nhave fpoken already.\nAs they can thus communicate things to our\nImagination, fo we may fuppofe, that in Profecu^\njion of rtat beneficent; Qoncerq which they have\nfor\n\f^o The Hiftory and Reality\nfor us, they can and frequently do affume human\nShape, and come to us, talk to us, and converfe\nintimately with us in Apparition and by Voice,\n\"'\nnay even in Dialogue, Queftion and Anfwer, as\nthey fee Occafion.\nThis converfing in Apparition, is what we call\nIValking-j and when any fuch thing is feen, we fay\na Spirit walks^ or haunts fuch a Place ;

In this Tempeft the Ship\nwas driven upon the Coaft of Rugen^ an Ifland on\nthe German fide of the Baltic^ where with much\nDifficulty they put into Straelfund^ a Sea-Port of\nPomererif and there the Traveller went on Shore.\nHere walking penfively and concerned about\nthe event of his Fortune, and fearing the Ship\nwould really be loft, as his firft Man had foretold\nhimj I fay, walking very anxious upon the Key at\nStraelfund^ there meets him a Man who he was ut-\nterly a Stranger to, but who falutes him in EngliJJj^\ncalls him by his Name, and asks him what he did\nthere.\nSurpriz'd with fuch a Salutation, and glad\nto fee any Man in fuch a ftrange remote Country\nthat he was like to be acquainted with, and much\nmore that could call him by his Name, he returned\nhis Compliment, and anfwer'd that indeed he had\nnot much Bufinefs there, but that he came thither\nby a very unfortunate occafion.\nI KNOW you are, fays the Gentleman j you came\nin here laft Night in yon Ship 5 pointing to the\nVefTel which lay in the Road betwen the City and\nthe Ifland of Rugen.\nI DID fo, fays the Itravelkfj and I am like to\nhave but ill Luck with her, I\n\fof APP ARiriONS. 6i\nI DOUBT fo, fays the Stranger^ and I fuppole that\nmade you look fo much concernM.\nI CANNOT deny^\n\/aid he^ buc 1 might look\ntroubled, I think I have Caufe, for I am here in a\nftrange Country, without Acquaintance or Intereft,\nand know not yet what Condition the Ship is in,\nor my Goods, which I doubt are damag'd.\nI AM afTur'd, y^>\\f the ^entleman^ the Ship will\nnot be able to purfueher Voyage, but perhaps your\nCargo may be fafe.

Sir, who it is I am thus much oblig'd to ?\nFirst, returns he, let me fee and get you fome\nhelp, that you may go cheerfully about your Bufi-\nnefs, and we'll talk of that afterwards j fo he bad\nhim walk a little there, and he would come to him\nagain.\nHe had not walked long but he fees a Meflen-\nger coming to him, to tell him, that there was arj,\nEnglijh Gentleman defir'd to fpeak with him atfuch\na Houfe, and that he was to guide him to the\nplace.\nAccordingly he follows the Meflenger,\nwho brings him to a Publick Houfe where were\nThree Gentlemen fitting in a Room, and the Man\nhe had converfed with made a fourth, who cali'd\nhim in, and bad him fit down^which he did.\n4 The\n\f^4 ^^ Hijiorj and Reality\nTilE Three Gentlemen faluted him very kindly,\nand one of them alio in Englijh^ and told him they\nhad received an Account of his Circumftances from\nthat Gentleman, and that theyfent for him to com-\nfort and aflift hiti.\nThis was a kind and agreeable Surprize to him,\nand he could not but receive it with all Civility\nand Acknowledgment poffible. After which they\nask'd him to Sup with them,which he accepted of^\nand at Supper hearing the whole of the Cafe, they\nfent for a Merchant of that City to come to\nthem.\nWhen the Merchant was come they recom*\nmended the Stranger's Affair to him j and he, the\nMerchant, was foaffi dant to the Stranger that he\nbought all his Cargo of Fifh, or procured others to\nbuy it, giving him a Price to his Satisfaction, and\ngave him as much Money there as he required, and\ngood Bills payable at Dantzick for the reft.\nI N the mean time, (for this was tranfa6ling fe*\nveral Days) the Three Gentlemen continued ex-\nceeding courteous and obliging to him j and after\nmany other Civilities, they being travelling into\nPolandy invited the Traveller to go with them as\nfar as Dantzickj which they knew he was bound\nfor, and that they would fubfill him at their own\nCharge fo far. The Traveller confidering his own\nCondition, and that the Ship he came in was not in\nCondition to purfue the Voyage, refolv'd to ac-\ncept of the Offer, and accordingly prepared to go\nwith them : But he was extremely concern'd that\nhe could not fee the kind Stranger who had firft\nfaluted him as above, and who brought him to the\nGentlemen that were now fo extraordinary civil\nto him 5 he enquired after him of the Meffenger\nthat fetch'd him to that Houfe, but he knew him\nnot ; he ask'd the People of the Houfe, but they\ncould give no Account of him > he ask'd the three\nGen-\n\fof APPARITIONS. 6$\nGentlemen about him^ but they knew nothing\nof him 5 the Englijh Gentleman among them faid,\nhe thought he belonged to that Gentleman, point-\ning to another of the three who was a German '^ the\nGerman anfwer'd that he underitood he was the third\nGentleman's Friend, who was a Swede^ that is a\nPomeranian^ for Pomeren is under the Dominion of\nthe Swedes. But the Swede faid he thought he was\nthe Englijh Gentleman's Brother, for he fpoke\nEnglijh very well 5 in a word, no body knew him,\nand he faw him no more.\nI N a Week more or thereabout the four Gen*\ntlemen (for now they were fo many) fet out toge-\nther, with every one a Servant 5 except our Traveller^\nwho had none. Every one that knows the Coun-\ntry from Stetin to Dantzick and Poland^knows that\nit is a defart and wild Country very thin of Inha*\nbitants, and confequently not full of Towns 1\nwith feveral Woods and Wafts in their Way, very\ndifficult to Travel, and this obliged them feveral\ntimes to take Guides by the Way, fo that they\nmade up with their Guides always Eight, feme*\ntimes Ten in Company, very wellarm'd, and toiei*a-*\nbly well mounted.\nThe third Day after they were paft the Oder^\nand began to come out of that Part of Pomeren\nwhich lies Eaft of Stetin^ and is call'd the Ducat\nPomeren^ they obferv'd a Man mean in Apparel, but\nappearing fomething more than meerly what Po*\nverty reprefents, travelling the fame Way as they\ndid, but always keeping at about the diftance of\nhalf a Mile from them on their left Hand.\nHe travelled on Foot, but kept full pace with\nthem, and often was fome way before them j whe^\nther he was in a Track or Road, as they were, they\ncould not tell, but he kept fuch an equal Diftance\nas if the Road he was in was Parallel with theirs\nindeed fometimes they loft fight of him for a while j\nF yes\n\f66 .

They obferved that Riding over a large\nPlain, where there were fome few fcattering Houfes\nwhich lay on the other fide ofthe Road South, (for\nhe kept all along (before) on the North fide of\nthem) I fay, paffing over this Plain, the Traveller\nkeeping a little behind them crofs'd the Road,\nand going up to one of the faid fcatter'd Houfes,\nknock'd at the Door and went in.\nUpon this they refolv'd if pofiible to get fome\nknowledge of him 5 fo they rode all up to another\nof thofe Houfes : Here calling to the Inhabitants,\n'\ntho' it was no Inn or Houfe of Entertainment,\nbut a Poor Husbandman's Cottage, they got\nLeave to refrefh themfelves, having Provifions and\n^Wine of their own, and giving the good Wife a\nfmall'\n\fof APPARITIO NS. 67\nfttiall Bottle of about half a Pint of Brandy atpart*\ning^ the People were abundantly fatisfied.\nHere talking of the Traveller, and at what\nHoufe he call'd in the Village, (for tho' the Houfes\nHood itragling over the wade, yet as there were near\ntwenty of them in all it was call'd a Town) here,\nI fay, talking of the Traveller and of his knocking\nat the Door of one of the Houfes, the Woman of\nthe Houfe underftanding their Language,hafi;ilyask'd,\nWhat, fays fhe, have you feen the Qwke Mouraski ?\nWho fhe meant, they did not know 5 but defcribing\nthePerfonto her,and ihe alfo to them, they began to\ncome to an Underllanding.

All this gave\nthem Amufement, but no particular Sacisfadtion, and\nrather prompted their Curiofity to make farther En-\nquiry about him. After about an t^our's refrefhing\nthemfelves at this poor Cottage, they proceeded on\ntheir Journey, and having rode about two Milesj\nthey faw their old Obje6b again on the left or north\nlidc of their Road, as before, and he kept in their ^\nfight in the fame manner all the reft of the Day.\nThere was a Town, I think 'tis call'd Kint-^\nzigeuy or fome fuch like Name, at a few Miles di-\nHance, and where their Guide told them they Ihould\nlodge, and before they came to the Town there was\na River, not a great or very wide River, but too\nlarge to ride thro' ir, and at the Town there is a ve-\nry good flone Bridge ; built, as they were told, by\nthe Anceftors of the Kings o^ Pruffia^ that is, as I\nfuppofe, the old Dukes of Pomerania.\nAccordingly they pafs'd this Bridge, and\nthen went into' the Town. It was moft nat iral to\nthem to obfervc what Courfe the Traveller would\ntake to pafs the River, who as he went on muft ne-\nceflarily come to the Bank, at near a Mile diftance\nfrom the Town, fo they halted a little, one of thern\nalighting from his Horfe, as if fomething had re-\nquired their flay, that the Travelled might go on\nbefore them, which he did.\nObserving him as narrowly as poilible, they\nfollow'd him (with their Eyes) down to the very\nEdge of the River, nor did he ftop or take notice\nof them, tho' they faw him plainly to the very Bank ;\nbut here not being able to keep him exa61;ly in their\nfight every Moment, they immediately faw him\ngoing up the rifing Grounds, on the other fide,\nF 5\nwithout\n\f70 The Hiftoyy and Reality\nwithout being capable of giving the leaft account\nhow he pafs'd the Water.\nThis was the other Paflage, which, I fay, amu-\nfcd them very much.\nAs foon as they came into the Town where they\nwere to lodge, their Guide looking beyond the\nHoufe where they ftop'd, called to them, Look\nyonder, fays he, is your Traveller fitting at the\nDoor of fuch an Inn or Houfe, pointing to the\nPlace} and there they faw him plain at the Door ea-\nting a piece of Bread, and having a Pot or Jug of\nPoliJJj Beer (landing by him. One of the Gentlemen\n(refolving, if poflible, to fpeak with him) walk'd up in\nhis Boots to the Place, feeing him fitting all the while\nhe was going, 'till coming very near, and happen-\ning to turn his Eyes but one Moment from him,\nwhen he look'd again, the Man was gone.\nH E ask'd the People of the Houfe about him,\nbut they knew nothing of him, only that as they\nfaid there was fuch a Man, but he was gone, and\nthey neither knew who he was, or whither he was\ngone.\nThen he ask'd them if they did not know the\nOwke Mouraski -, they faid Yes, they had heard of\n, but they did not know him.\nWhy, fays the GentJemm^ don't you.know that\nthis was he that fat upon the Bench?\nNo, they faid^ that could not be he, that was a\npoor Countryman,a Traveller.\nThe Gentleman aflured them that was he 5 at\nwhich they feemed very much concerned, but fcemed\nvery willing not to believe him.\nWhy, fays he^ are you afraid of him ?\nNo, fays ihey^ but we don't like his coming to\nus, for, they fay, he brings no good to the Family\nwhere he comes.\nBut this Difcourfe ended, and the Gentleman\ngain'd no Information there.\n7 Th e\n\fof APPARITIO NS. 71\nThe next Day they had his Company again, as\nbefore j and paffing by a fi ngle Houfe upon the Road,\nnear a Village, but {landing quite out of the Road,\nthey obferv'd the Traveller to flop at that Houfe,\nand go in.\nBy this time their Curioiity was very much\nheighten'd, and they began to be fomething uneafy\nabout him 5 it was not very pleafant, they thought, to\nhave the Devil fo near them,' and they could think\nhim to be nothing \\t{% 5 fo they all turn'd back, and\nrefolvM to go to the Houfe, and if he was there t^\nfpeak with him, if pofEblej and if nor, to inform\nthemfelves as much as they could about him.\nWhen they came within about a quarter of a\nMile of the Houfe, they faw the Traveller on the\nother fide, having gone out at the back Door, and\ntravelling forward as unconcern'd, and taking no\nnotice of them, jufl as before.\nThis furprized them 5 however they went up to\nthe Houfe, and enquired about him, as they did\nbefore : but here they received a quite differing Ac^\ncount of him; here the People blefs'd him, called\nhim by the fame Name, but took him for their\n.good Angel, (as they call'd him,) that he always\nbrought them good Tidings, that they were fure it\nwould fare well with them after he had been with\nthem 5 and a great deal more.\nBut to bring this Story to a conclufion, fo far\nas it ferves the prefent Occafion : This Spe<5lre, or\nApparition, for fo I mufl call it, attended them\n'till they came within two Leagues of Dantzicky\nwhere the Gentlemen feparated, after a Day or two\nflaying m the City 5 the three Gentlemen going\nfrom thence to Mariemhurgh in Polijh PruJJia^ and\nour Traveller was left in Dantzick.\nWhile he was here a Man made acquaintance\nwith him who was bound to Komngsberg^ and our\nTraveller beinj refolv'd to go for Petersburg^ was\nF 4 glad\n\fyi The Hifiory and Reality\nglad to>have this new Acquaintance, which he had,\nas we may fay, pick'd up, to go with him > fo they\nembark'd together in a fmall Hoy, upon the Sea or\nX-ake caird xh^Frifchaff^ which carry'd ihcmio Ko-\nningsherg. He gives a llrange tho' diverting Account\nof his Converfation with this Man, who told him\nfo many Stories of feveral kinds, that it amaz'd him j\nand he look'd as if he knew all the World, and all\nthe People in it, and 'all things that had happened\nin it,- or would happen in it for ever to come, and\nfomething longer.\nHowever, as the Frifchaff \\s not above three\nor four Days fail, and they were quickly at Ko-\nningsberg^ the Converfation was foon over, and this\nnew Acquaintance ended j but the Traveller conti-\nnuing his Journey, enquired in the City if there\nwere any Paflcngcrs or Gentleman travelling to-\nwards Riga^ either by Land or by Sea; and being\ndire6i:ed to a Houfe where Strangers ufed to reforr,\nhe found there feveral People bound for Riga^ fome\nMerchants, fome Country-People, fome Seafaring-\nPeople, but moffc enclin'd to go by Sea, there be-\ning Veflels always ready at the Pillau^ which is a\nTown at the Mouth of the Haff^ ready to Sail for\nRiga^ if Goods or Paflengers prefented.\nBut among them all there was an ancient Man,\nhabited like a Rufs^ or rather like a Greek Prieft,\nwith a long venerable Beard, a purple Robe or long\nGarment, fuch as the Ruffians wear, a high ftiff-\ncrown'd Furr-cap, and a clofe Veft about his Body,\ngirded with a Silk Safhj and he declared himfelf\nfor Rigay but that being an old Man, he would not\ngo by Sea, but that he had two Horfes in the City\nbefides his own, having brought two Servants with\nhim from Grodno in Lithuania^ but one of them had\nleft him J fo he offered the Traveller to lend him\none of his Horfes for his Company, if he would\ntravel\n\fof APPARITIONS. 73\ntravel wich him to Mittau in Courland^ and thence\nto Riga.\nI T will take up too much Room here, to give a\nfull Account of the Travels of this wandring\nPerfon, and how in almoft every Place he found\na new Shape ready to thruft into his Company, and\nthat for four Years intimate Ramble 5 but that ac\nlaft, being in I'urkey^ his lateft Companion difco-\nver'd to him that he was an Inhabitant of an invifi-\nble Region, that he had been in his Company in\nall his Journey in all the differing Figures that he\nhad met with, and that in a Word he was the fame\nPerfon that embark'd with him in Ireland^ landed\nwith him in Norway^ left him at Gottenhurg^ found\nhim at Straelfund^ dogged him upon the way to\nDantzick^ failed with him to Komngsierg, lent him a\nHorfe to go to Riga^ and fo onj and that he had\nonlv put on To many Shapes and Appearances, that\nhj might not be uneafy with him, and tired of his\n^^ Company.\nHow they went on together after that, and the\nConverfation that pafs'd between them after the\nDifcoverys how familiar Friends they were for fome\nMonths after, and what Reafons he gave why he\nwould never believe that it was a Devil, but a good\nand kind Spirit fent to take Care of him, and affift\nhim in his Travels; all that, as foreign to my pre-\nfent Purpofe, I omit. Perhaps the Story may fee\nthe World by itfelf, and well worth reading it will\nbe, if it docs. But of that by the by.\nAs I do not here enter into the Authority of the\nStory, (tho', as I faid, I have feen it in Manufcript\nmany Years ago) fo I have no more to fay from it\nthan this, that if fuch good Spirits are conversant\nwith Mankind, and refident in the invifible Spaces,\nwe know not v^\/here ; if we have reafon to believe they\nare not Angels, and yet really by their A6bions can-\nnot be Devils 3 then it follow^ that there are a\ncertain\n\f74 '^^^ Hifiory and Reality\ncertain middle Species of Spirits in Beings let them\nbe what they will, let them be employed, dire\u00a3ted,\nlimited and reflrain'd, how and in what manner he\npleafes who is their Maker, and who ought to be\ntheir Guide and Direftorj that's not the matter, nor\ncan it be enquired into herej the Queftion before\nus is only whether fuch there are, or no ?\nNow if it be granted that there are fuch, and\nthat brings it down to the prefent Cafe, if there\nare fuch, then all Apparitions are not Devils 5 no,\nnor are they walking difturbed Souls of Men lately\nembodied and departed : a Notion empty and not\nto be defended 5 incongruous, and inconfiftent either\nwith Scripture, the Chriftian Religion, or Reafon,\nand founded only in the bewildred Imaginations and\nDreams of ignorant People, who neither know how\nor by what Rules to judge of fuch Things, or are\ncapable of right Conceptions about them \u2022, who do\nnot give ihemfelves timetoexercife that little Power\nof thinking that they are Mailers of, and fo are\nleft to the Darknefs of their own Fancies, thinking\nevery thing they fee is a Devil, meerly becaufe they\nknow not what elfe to make of ir, what other Name\nto give ir, or that it can be poflible any thing but\nDevils or Angels can come of fuch Errand?.\nBy this.Miftake they give the Devil the Ho-\nnour of many an A6t:ion, which he is too much a\nDevil to have any hand in 5 afcribe Works of Cha-\nrity and Benevolence tojiim j make him move inju-\nrious and knavifh Men to do Juftice, Thieves to\nmake Reftitution, cruel and inhuman Wretches to\nbe merciful. Cheats to turn honeft, Robbers to de-\niift, and Sinners to repent.\nStory tells us, that \/^i\/^^ that famous out-law'd\nRobber, the molt famous fince Robin Hood^ met\naSpeftre upon the Road, in a Place cdWcdStangate-\nHok^ in HuntingtonJJoire^ where he ufed to commit\nhis\n\fGf APPARITIO NS. 7%\nhis Robberies J and famous for many a Highway\nRobbery fince that.\nThe Spe6i:re appeared in the Habit of a plain\nCountry Grazier > and as the Devil, you may fup^\npofe, knew very well the Haunts and Retreats thac\nthis Hind ufed to frequent 5 he comes into the Inn,\nand taking up his Quarters, puts up his Horfc, and\nmakes the Hoftler carry up his Portmanteau, which\nwas very heavy, into his Chamber j when he was in\nthe Chamber he opens his Pack, takes out his\nMoney, which feemed to be in feveral fmall Parcels,\nand puts it together into no more than two Bags,\nthat it might make an equal weight to each fide of\nhis Horfe, and make as much fhow of it as pofSble.\nHouses that entertain Rogues are feldom with-\nout Spies to give them due Intelligence \\ Hind gets\nNotice of the Money, fees the Man, fees the Horfe,\nthat he may know him again 5 finds out which\nWay the Countryman travels, meets him at Stan^\ngate-Hole^ jufl in the bottom between the two Hills,\nand Hops him, telling him he muft deliver his\nMoney.\nWhen he nam'd the Money the Grazier feigns\nhimfelf furprized, puts on the Pannick, trembles,\nand is frighted, and with a pitiful Tone fays, \/ am\n(as you fee) hut a poor Man 5 indeed^ Sir^ I have no\nMoney 5 [there the Devil fiiew'd that he could fpeak\nTruth when it ferv'd his Occafion.] O you old Dog^\nfays he, have you no Money? Come, open your\nCloak-bag, and give me the two Bags, one on one\nfide your Saddle, and one on t' other: what, have\nyou no Money, and yet your Bags were too heavy to lie\nall on one Gi(\\Q} Come, come, deliver, or I'll cut you\nto Pieces this Moment. (There he was out too, and\nthreatened more than he cou'd do.) Well, the poor\nDevil whines and cries, and tells him he muft be\nmiftaken, he took him for another Man fure, for\nindeed he had no Money,\nCome,\n\f76 The Hifiory and Reality\nComb, come, (zys Hind^ come along with me;\nand fo he takes Vus Horfe by the Bridle and leads\nhim out of the Road into the Woods, which are\nvery thick there on both fides, and the bufinefs\nwas too long to ftand in the open Road all the while\nto do it.\nWhe n he had gotten into the Woods, Come, Mr.\nGrazier, fays he, difmount, and give me the two\nBags this Minute. In fhort he dilmounts the poor\nMan, cuts his Bridle and his Girts, and opens his\nCloak-bag, where he finds the two Bags. Fery welly\nfays Hindy here they are, and heavy as before; fo\nhe throws them on the Ground, cuts them open, in\none he finds a Halter^ and in the other a piece of\nfolid Brafs in the exadfc fliape of a Gibbet, and the\nCountryman behind him call'd to him, there's your\nFate, Hind, tah care.\n1 F he was furprized at what he had found in the\nBags, (for there was not a Farthing of Money but\nin the Bag Where the Halter was, of which pre-\nfently,) 1 fay, if he was furprized at what he found\nin the Bags, he was more fo at hearing the Coun-\ntryman call him by his Name, and turn'd about to\nkill him, becaufe he thought he was known ; but\nhe had no Life nor Soul left in him, when turning\nabout, as 1 fay, to kill the Fellow, he faw nothing\nbut the poor Horfe. He funk down to the Earth,\nand lay there a confiderable time; how long, that\n(being alone) he could not tell, but it mull be fome\nMinutes. At laft coming to himfelf he goes away\nterrified to the laft degree, and afhamed, wondring\nwhat it (hould be.\nI HINTED that there was no Money but one\nPiece found, which the Story fays was Scots^ a Piece\ncaird in Scotland a Fourteen^ in Englijhy a nirteen\nPence Half-Penny, to pay the Hangman with; from\nwhence it may be fuppos'd that Saying is ufcd to this\nDay,\n\fof APPARITIONS. 7j\nDay, that thirteen Pence Half-Penny is Hangman's\nWages,\nNow tho' the Story has fome Mirth in it, and\nmay with the many Stories of that Robber be\nkid by as Romances, yet it is thus far to my\nPurpofej That this was a Spirit, that muft be ac-\nknowledged. A good Angel from Heaven wou'd\nhardly ha^e been fent to'give him fuch aninefFedtu-\nal infignificant Hint, which had no fufficient Effe\u00a3t,\nwhatever it might have juft then to furprize him,\nfor he rob'd continually after that, and was hang'd\nat laft for it.\nThe Dm\/, as before, cannot rationally be fufpe-\n6J:ed in the Cafe 5 for why ihould the Devil both ,bauk\nhim, threaten and caution him ? threaten him with\nhanging him, fright him with the Gibbet and Hal-\ntar, and caution him to take care. This was not\nfor the Devirs Purpofe, it was more for his Inte-\nreft to have him go on, though he came to the\nGallows at lafl.\nI F then it vvas neither good Angel or Bad^ what\nmuft it be, and how muft we judge of it? what\nName muft we gis^e him, and who was this Country\nGrazier ?\nTo come off of this, fome will have it be, that\nit is the Demi under Conftraint, the Devil in Com-\nmiiSon, that he is fent on fuch Errands by a fupe-\nrior Power that has him at Command > and that\nwhen he is dire\u00a3ted to do fo and fo^ he muft obey,\nhe dare do no otherwife. This is begging the Que-\nftion in the grofleft manner imaginable. Befides,\nwhy the Devil fent of fuch Errands ?\ni.\\ T is not probable^ it is not to be gathered fron\\\nthe ordinary Courfe of Providence. The Devil in-\ndeed was permitted, or, if you will have it, he\nwas commillion'd to ftrip and affli\u00a3t Poor Joh-y and\nhe was again permitted to enter into the Herd of\nSwine 5 but this does not amount to a Paralel: In\nboth\n\f78 The Hijlory and Reality\nboth thofe Examples he was only employ'd as art\nInftrument, and, as we may exprels it, in his ordi-\nnary Bufinefs, in the way of his Calling, that is to\nlay in doing Mifchief: But here he is fuppos'd em-\nploy'd in doing Good, cautioning a hardened\nRogue to leave off his wicked Courle, and efcape\nthe Gallows. Now this is quite out of Satan's\nroad of Bufinefs 5 'tis alfo out of the ordinary courfe\nof Heaven's Condudt, for when do we find God\nemploying the Devil in any good Work ? I do not\nremember one clear Example of it, in all the facred\nHiftory.\n2. I T would argue that Heaven fhould want In-\nflrumentSj which is not at all juft to infer; will\nthey pretend, that, for want of more proper Agents,\nGod ftiould employ the Devil to fave a High-way\nMan from the Gallows? and, which is more than all\nthe reft, fhould not bring it to pafs neither ? But if\nyou will allow that this was one of the Imaginary\nipccies of Spirits, who, willing to fave a poor\nWretch that was running head- long to the Z)^iJ\/7,\ntook all thefe Meafures to alarm him, and bring him\nto juft Refleftions, but was not able to reclaim\nhim, was not admitted to give him Notice, when\nhe was about the fatal Ad he was furpriz'd in, or\nto warn him when the Officers came to apprehend\nhim, this feems rational.\nI F the Devil fhould be fuppos'd to be employ'd\nin fuch a Work as this was, and fo contrary to his\nInclination, either he would perform it like him-\nfelf, treacherous and unfaithful, or at beft, relu6i:ant\nand unwilling. Perhaps you will fay he durft not\nperform it treacheroully and unfaithfully; and it\nmay be not : But why muft it be fuppos'd Heaven\nfhould employ his worft and wickedeft Creature,\nwhom he had long fince disbanded, and caft out\nof his Service, rejeding him as unworthy to be em-\nploy'd; and who, if he was employ'd, and durft\nnot^\n\fof APPARITIO NS. 7^\nnot decline the Work, yet, it muft be acknow-\nledg'd, would obey with the utmoft Averfion and\nUnwillingnefsj when at the fame time Millions of\nfaithful Agents, willing and chearfuUy-obedienc\nServants, are ready at command, to execute his\nWill with the utmoft Vigour and Fidelity ?\nBut to leave arguing upon Infcrutables, let us\ncome to Narration of Fa\u00a3i:s.\nI HAVE another Account received from a parti-\ncular Acquaintance in a neighbouring Nation. I\ncould name Perfons and Places in a more exaft\nmanner to thefe Accounts j but fome Reafons of\nState forbid us at this time to enter into the Cir-\ncumftanccs of Families. For where Matters of Ap-\nparition and Witchcraft are the Subftance of the\nHiftory, it has never been found reafonable to name\nHoufes ind Families 5 and as this Apology will be\nallow'd to be juft, 1 expeft it will be accepted by\nthe Reader in all the Examples I fhall give of this\nkind.\nA CERTAIN Perfon of Quality, being with\nhis Family at his Country-Seat for the Summer-\nSeafon, according to his ordinary Cuftom, was\noblig'd upon a particular Occafion of Health to leave\nhis faid Seat, and go to Jis^ La Chapplk^ to ufe\nthe Baths there : This was it feems in the Month\nof Auguft^ being two Months fooner than the ufual\ntime of his returning to Court for the Winter.\nUpon thus removing fooner than ordinary, he\ndid not then disfurnifh the Houfe, as was the ordinary\nUfage of the Family, or carry away his Plate and\nother valuable Goods, but left his Steward and\nthree Servants to look after the Houfe, and the\nPadre or Parijh Prieft was defired to keep his Eye\nupon them too, and to fuccour them from the\nVillage adjoining, if there was Occafion.\nThe iSteward had no publick Notice of any\nHarm approaching 5 but for three or four Days fuc-\nceifively\n\fSo 7^<? Hiflory and Reality\nceflively he had fecrec ftrange Impulfes of Dread\nand Terror upon his Mind that the Houfe was be-\nfet, and was to be aflaulted by a Troop of Banditti,\nor as we call ^hem here, Houfe-hreakers^ who would\nmurther them all, and after they had robb'd the\nHoufe, would fet it on Fire 5 and this follow'd him fo\nfall, and made fuch Impreffion upon his Mind, that\nhe could think of nothing clfe.\nUpon this the third Day he went to the Padre^\nor Parijh Prieft^ and made his Complaint 5 upon\nwhich the Prieft and the Steward had the follow-\ning Difcourfe, the Steward beginning thus :\nFAiBER-i [aid he^ you know what a Charge I\nhave in my Cuftody, and how my Lord has intru-\nlled me with the whole Houfe, and all the rich\nFurniture is (landings I am in great Perplexity a-\nbout it, and come to you for your Advice.\nPa. Why, what's the Matter? you have not\nheard of any Mifchief threatned, have you?\nSt. N o, I have heard of nothing 5 but I have\nfuch Apprehenfions, and ithasmade fuch Impreffion\nupon me for thefe three Days, that*\n* Here he told him the particulars of the Unea-\nftnefs he had been in^ and added^ bejides what is [aid\nabove^ that one of the Servants had the fame.^\nand\nhad told him ofit^ tho\" he had communicated nothing\nto that Servant in the leaft.\nPa. f T may be, you dream'd of thefe things ?\nSt. No indeed, Padre^ 1 am fure I could noc\ndream of them, for I could never fleep.\nPa, What can I do for you? What would\nyou have me do ?\nSt. I WOULD have you firft of all tell me what\nyou think of thefe things, and whether there is a-\nny Notice to be taken of them* r-\n* Here the Padre examined him more firiUly ^-\nboul the Particulars^ and fent for the Servant and\nexamined him apart > and being a very judicious\nhonefi Man^ he anfwefd him thus Pa.\n\f0f APPARITIONS. 8i\nPa. Look you, Mr. Steward^ I do not lay a very\ngreat Screfs upon fuch things, but yet I don't think\nthey are to be wholly flighted 5 and therefore I\nwould have you be upon your Guard, and if you\nhave the leafl Alarm let me know.\nSt. That is poor Satisfadiion to me to be up-\non my Guard, if I am over-power'd. I fuppofe, if\nany Villains have a Defign to attack me, they know\nmy Strength.\nPa. Shall I reinforce your Garrifon?\nSt. I WISH you would.\nPa. Well, FU fend you fome Men with Fire-\nArms, to lye there this Night.\nAccordingly thePrieft fent him Rvt flout Fel-\nlows with Fuzces, and a dozen of Hand-Granadoes\nwith them, and while they continu'd in the Houfe\nnothing appear'dj but the Padre finding nothing\ncome of it, and being loth to put his Patron to fo\ncontinued a Charge, fent for the Steward, and in a\nchiding angry Tone, told him his Mind.\nPa. I KNOW not how you will anfvver it to my\nLord, but you have put him to a prodigious Ex-\npence here, in keeping a Garrifon in the Houfe all\nthis while.\nSt. I AM ferry for it. Padre \\ but what can I\ndo?\nPa. Do! Why, compofe your Mind, and keep up\nyour Heart, and don't let my Lord fpend two or three\nhundred Livres here, to cure you of the Vapours.\nSt. Why, you faid your felf, Padre^ that it was\nnot to be wholly flighted.^\nPa. That's truej but I faid alfo, I would not\nlay too great a Strefs upon it.\nSt. What 'mull I do then ?\nPa. Do! Why, difmifs the Men again, and take\nwhat Care you canj and if you have any Nocice of\nMifchief that may be depended upon, kc me have\nNotice too, and I'll affift you,\nG St.\n\fThe H'tjlory and Reality\nSt. Well then, the good Angel mufir prote\u00a3h\nmy Lord's Houfe, I fee, for no body elfe will.\nAmen^ fays the Padre^ 1 trufl: the good Spirits\nwill keep you all: So he blefs'd the Steward, (in\nhis way) and the Steward went away grumbling\nvery much that he took away his Garrifon, and left\nhim to the good Spirits.\nIt feems, for all this, that the Steward's Notices,\nhowever fecret, and from he knew not who, were\nnot of fo light an Import as the Padre thought\nthey were 5 for as he had this Impulfe upon his\nMind that fuch Mifchief was brewing, fo it really\nwas, as you will fee prefently.\nA 5 E T of Robbers, who had Intelligence that\nthe Nobleman with his Family was gone to jUdc\nLa Chapelle^ but that the Houfe was left furnifh'd,\nand all the Plate and the things of Value were left\nin it, had form'd a Defign to plunder the Houfe,\nand afterwards to burn it, iuft as the Steward had\nfaid.\nThey were two and twenty ftrong in the whole,\nand thoroughly arm'd for Mifchief Yet while the\nadditional Force, which the Padre had plac'd to\nreinforce the Steward, were in the Houfe, of\nwhom, including the other four, three fat up every\nNight, they did not dare to attempt it.\nB u T as foon as they heard that the Guard was\ndifmifs'd, they form'd their Defign anew, and, to\nmake the Story ihort, they attack'd the Houfe a-\nbout Midnight. Having, I fuppofe, proper In-\nftruments about them, they foon broke open a Win-\ndow, and twelve of them got into the Houfe,\nthe reft ftanding Centinel at fuch Places as they\nthought proper, to prevent any Succours from the\nTown.\nThe poor Steward and his three Men were in\ngreat Diftrefsj they were indeed above Stairs, and\nhad barricadocd the Stair-Cafes as \\yell as they\ncould,\n\fof APPARITIONS. 85\ncould, hearing the Fellows were breaking in 5 but\nwhen they found they were got in, they expe6ted\nnothing but to be kept above Stairs 'till the Houfc\nwas plunder'd, and then to be burnt alive.\nBut it feems the good Spirits the Prieft fpokc\nof, or fome body elfe, made better Proviiion for\nthem, as you will fee prefently.\nWhen the firft of the Fellows were gotten in-\nto the Hou(e, and had open'd the Door, and let in\nas many of their Gang as they thought fit, which\n(as above) was twelve in Number they fliut the Door\nagain, and fliut themfelvcs in % leaving two without\nthe Door, wKo had a Watch-word, to go and call\nmore Help if they wanted it.\nThe twelve ranging over the great Hall, found\nlittle there to gratify their greedy Hopes 5 but brea-\nking next into a fine wcll-furnifii'd Parlour, where\nthe Family ufually far. Behold, in a great cafy\nChair, fat a grave ancient Man, with a long full-\nbottom'd black Wig, a rich brocaded Gown, and\na.

Why, this old Fel-\nlow deals with the Devil fure, he's here afore u$\nagain.\nBut the Cafe difFer'd a little now 5 for when\nthey came out of the firft Parlour, being eager for\nthe Plate and Money, and willing to find it a l l,-\nthe whole Body of them run out into the fecond\nParlour J but now the ancient Man pointing to the\nthird Room, they did not all immediately rufh out\ninto the Salon^ but four of them were left behind\nin the Parlour or Gaming-Room mentioned juft\nnow, not by order or defign, but accidentally.\nBy\n\fef APPARITIONS. 8y\nBy this Means they fell into the following Con-\nfufion^ for while fome of them call'd out from the\nSalon^ that the t?\/^ Rogue 'was there before them again -y\nothers anfwer'd out of the Parlour, How the De'vil\ncan that be ? why, he is here ftill in his Chair, and\nall his Rubbifli: with that, two of them run back\ninto the firll Parlour, and there they faw him again\nfitting as before. Notwithftanding all this, far from\nguefling what the Occafion fhould be, they fancied\nthey were gamed, or fuggefted that they were but\njefted with, and that there were three feveral old\nMen all drefs'd up in the fame Habits for the very\nfame Occafion, and to mock them, as if to let them\nknow that the Men above in the Houfc were not\nafraid of them.\nW\u00a3.!-. i.^ fays one of the Gang^ I'll difpatch one\nof the old Rogues, I'll teach one of them how to\nmake Game at us : upon which, raifing his Fuzee\nas high as his Arm would let him, he flruck at\nthe antient Man, as he thought it was, with all his\nForce 5 but behold! there was nothing in the Chair,\nand his Fuzee flew into a thoufand Pieces, wound-\ning his Hand moff grievoufly, and a Piece of the\nBarrel ftriking him on the Head, broke his Face,\nand knock'd him down backward.\nA T the fame time, one of thofe in th e Salon run-\nning at the antient Man that fat there, fwore he\nwould tear his fine brocaded Gown off, and then\nhe would cut his Throat: but when he went to\ntake hold of him, there was nothing in the Chair.\nThis happening in both Rooms, they were all\nin moft horrible Confufion, and cry'd out in both\nRooms at the fame Moment, in a terrible manner.\nA^ they were in the utmoft Amazement at the\nthing, fo after the firft Clamour they Hood looking\nupon one another for fome time, without fpeaking\na Word more 5 but at length one faid, Let's go\nfeack into the firit Parlour and fee if that's gone\nG 5\ntooj\n\f^6 The Htfiory and Reality\ntoo 5 and with that Word, two or three that were\non that fide, run into the Room, and there fat the\nantient Figure as at firft 5 upon which they called\nto the Company, and told them, they believed they\nwere all bewitch'd, and 'twas certain they only\nfancy'd they faw a Man in the other Rooms, for\nthere was the real old Man fitting where he was\nat firfl.\nUpon this they all run thither, faying, they\nwould fee whether it was the Devil or no 5 and one\nof them faid, Let me come 5 I'll fpeak to him 5 'tis\nnot the firft time I have talk'd with the Devil.\nNay, fays another^ fo will I j and then added with\nan': Oath, Gentlemen that were upon fuch Bufinefsas\nthey were, ought not to be afraid to fpeak to the Devil.\nA THIRD (for now their Courage began to rife\nagain) calls aloud^ Let it be the Devil^ or the Devil's\nGrandmother, I'll parley with it, I am refolv'd I'll\nknow what it is : and with that he runs forward\nbefore the refl, and crofling himfelf, fays to the an-\ntient Man in the Chair, in the Name of St Francis,\nand St. \u2014 (and fo reckon'd up two or three\nSaints Names that he depended were enough to\nfright the Devil) What art thou?\nThe Figure never mov'd or fpoke-, but looking\nat its Face, they prefently found, that infte^d of\nhis pitiful Looks, and feeming to beg for his Life, as\nhe did before, he was chang'd into the moft horrible\nMonfler that ever was feen, and fuch as I cannot\ndefcribej and that inftead of his Hands held up\nto them to cry for Mercy, there were two large\nfiery Daggers, not flaming, but red hot, and pointed\nwith a livid bluifli Flame, and in a word, the Devil\nor fomething elfe, in the moft frightful Shape that\ncan be imagin'd. And it was my Opinion, when\nI firft read the Story, the Rogues were fo\nfrighted, that their Imagination afterwards form'd\na thing m their Thoughts more terrible than the\nDevil himfelf could appear in.\n5 But\n\fof AP PARITIO NS.\nB u T be that as it will, his Figure was fuch,\nthat when they came up to him, not a Man of\nthem had Courage to look in his Face, much lefs\ntalk to him 5 and he that was fo bold, and thus\ncame arm*d with half a Regiment of Saints in his\nMouth, fell down flat on the Ground, having\nfainted away (as they call it) with the Fright.\nThe Steward and his three Men were all this,\nwhile above flairs, in the utmoft Concern ac\nthe Danger they were in, and expecting every\nMoment the Rogues would ftrive to force their\nWay up, and cut their Throats 5 They heard the\nconfus'd Noife that the Fellows made below, but.\ncou'd not imagine what it was, and much lefs the\nMeaning of it : but while it lafted it came into\nthe Mind of one of the Servants, that as it was\ncertain the Fellows were all in the Parlour, and\nvery bufy there, whatever it was about, he might\ngo up to the Top of the Houfe and throw one of\ntheir Hand-Granadoes down the Chimney, and per-\nhaps it might do fome Execution among them.\nThe Steward approved of this Defign, only\nwith this Addition 5 if we throw down but into\none Parlour, they will all fly into the Gaming-\nroom, and fo it will do no Execution j but, fays he,\ntake three, and put down one into each Chimney,\nfor the Funnels go up all together, and then they\nwill not know which Way to I'un.\nWith thefe Orders two of the Men, who ve-\nry well knew the Place, went up, and firing the\nFuzees of the Granadoes, they put one Shell into\neach of the Funnels, and down they went roaring\nin the Chimney with a terrible Noife, and (which\nwas more than all the reft) they came down into\nthe Parlour where almoft all the Rogues were,\njuft -it the Moment that the Fellow that fpoke to\nthe Spectre was frighted into a fwooning Fit, and\nfallen on the Floor.\nG 4 The\n\fg8 The Htjiory and Reality\nThe whole Gang was frighted beyond Ex-\npreffionj fome run back into the gaming Parlour\nwhence they came, and fome run to the other\nDoor which they came in at from the Hallj but all,\nat the fame Inftanr, heard the Z)m\/, as they thought\nit was, coming down the Chimney.\nHad it been poflible that the Fuzeesof the Gra-\nnadoes could have continued burning in the Funnel\nof the Chimnies, where the Sound was a thoufan4\ntimes doubled by the hollow of the Place, and\nwhere the Soot burning fell down in Flakes of Fire,\nthe Rogues had been frighted out of their Under-r\n{landings 5 imagining, that as they had one dreadful\nT>evU]\\k^ among them in the Chair, fo there were\nten thoufand more coming down the Chimney to\ndeftroy them all j and perhaps to carry them all\naway.\nBut that could not bcj fo after they had been\nfufficiently feared with the Noife, down came the\nShells into the Rooms, all three together : It happen'd\nas luckily as if it had been contriv'd on purpofe,\nthat the Shell which came down into the Parlour\nwhere they all were, burft as foon as ever it came\nto the Bottpm, fo that it did not give them time\no much as to think what it might be, much lefs\nto know that it was really a Hand-Granadoej but\nas it did great Execution among them, fo they as\ncertainly believ'd it was the Devtl^ as they beHeved\nthe Spe61:re in the Chair was the Deinl.\nThe Noife of the burfting of the Shell was fo\nfudden and fo unexpefted, that it confounded them,\nand the Mifchief v\/as alio terrible 5 the Man that\nfainted and who lay on the Ground was killed out-\nright, and two more that Itood juft before the\nChimney J five of them were defperately wounded,\nwhereof one had both his Legs broke, and was fo\n^efpcracc, that when the Ptople from the Country\ncamq\n\fef APPARITIONS. 8p\ncame in, he ft^ot himfelf thro' the Head with his\nown Piflol^ to prevent his being taken.\nHad the reft of them fled out of the Parlour\ninto the two other Rooms, 'tis probable they had\nbeen wounded by the other Shells; but as they\nheard the Noife in both the outer Rooms, and be-\nfides were under the Surprife of its being not a\nHand-Granado, but the Z)^-!;\/\/, they had no Power to\nftirj nor, if they had, could they know which way\nto go to be fafe : fo they flood (lock ftill 'till both the\nShells in the other Rooms burfl alfo; at which bc-\nmg confounded, as well with the Noife as with\nthe Smoke, and expe\u00a3ling more Devils down the\nChimney where they flood, they run out all that\nWay, and made to the Door, helping their wound-\ned Men along as well as they could j whereof one\ndied in the Fields after they were got away.\nIt mull be obferv'd, when they were thus\nalarmed with they knew not, what coming down\nthe Chimney, they cryed out, that the Devil in\nthe Chair had fent for more Devils to dellroy them j\nand 'twas fuppos'd that had the Shells never come\ndown they would all have run away. But certain ic\nwas, that the artificial Devil joyning fo critically\nas to Time with the vifionary Devils^ or whatever\nthey were, com pleated their Diforder, and forced\nthem to fly.\nWhen they came to the Door to the two\nMen, they made fignals for their Comrades, who\nwere polled in the Avenues to the Houfe, to come\nto their Relief; who accordingly came up, andaf-\nlilled to carry off their Wounded Men : but after\nhearing the Relation of thofe that had been in the\nHoufe, and calling a fhort Council a little way\nfrom the Door, (which, tho' dark as it was, the\nSteward and his Men could perceive from the Win-\ndow,) they all refolved to make off,\nTheri&\n\fpo 7i&^ Hiflory and Reality\nThere was another concurring Accident^which\ntho' it does not relate to my Subjedl:, I muft fet\ndown to compleat the Story, 'z;\/2;.That two of thefe\nGranadoes by the Fire oftheir Fuzes fet the Chim-\nneys on Firej the third being in a Funnel that had\nno Soot in it, the Room having not been fo much\nufed, did not.

But the Rogues were fled,leaving, as above,\nthree of their Company dead in the Houfe, and\none in the Field.\nI MUST confefs, I cannot draw many Inferences\nto my purpofe from the Particulars of this Story,\nwhich however I have told for your Diverfion ;\nbut from the General I may 5 namely, This Apparition\nwas certainly not in favour of the Robbery 5 and if\nall the Particulars are true in Fa6t as related, we can\nhardly with Juftice place them to Satan's Account.\nTake him as a Deftroycr and a Father of Mifchief,\nhe could not be fuppos'd to have appeared to pre-\nvent the Robbing the Houfe,or to afliil the Steward\nin the Houfe in defence ofhis Mafter's Goods: what\nGood Spirit this muft be, and from whence, is then\na remaining Qiieftion, and that brings it to my\npurpofe again.\nI SHALL give you another Story out of more\nAuthentick Records, tho' related in a different\nmanner by feveral People, as their feveral Interefts\ninclin'd them.\nJAMES\n\fof AP PARiriO NS. 5>i\nJAMES IV.

That when I fpeak of Angels I muft\nbe underftood as follows,\nFIR S 7, The Word Angel is to be underftood\nof good Angels 5 for the Devils^ as I have faid, arc\nalfo Angels: Satan is called an Angel qf Light;\nbut\n\fof APPARITIO NS. 127\nbut the evil Angels I fhall always treat with their\nnew Sirname, Devil -, fo that when I fpeak of An-\ngels, I am always to be underflood of the good\nAngels.\nSECONDLT, But of good Angels, thefe I di-\nftinguifli alfo into two Kinds:\n(I.) The Angels which are aflually in Hea-\nven, fuch as we read of, Gabriel^ Michael^ and\nothers not diftinguifhed by Name ; thefe have ap-\npeared amongft Men, upon this Earth, as I have\nalfo faid before at large j but even thefe, we have\nReafonto believe, we ihall fee no more 5 God having\npleafed to difcover himfelf to his People now in a-\nnother Way, by another Miniflration, namely, by\nhis Spirit, and by an Evangelick, not an Angelick\nMiniilry.\n(2.) That Rank of Angels or Spirits, call\nthem as we pleafe, (and whether inferior or not,\nwe are not to determine,) who are plac'd by\nthe Direction of God himfelf in a nearer Situation\nto us J plae'd, I fay, by their Maker, under his fu-\nperior Providence, for the Diredion and Condu6fc\nof human Creatures, and of their Affairs, or at leafl\nto Guard them from the Invafions, Threatning,\nand Helliih Defigns of the Prince of Darknefs and\nhis Angels 5 and thefe, as I faid, might well becall'd\nGuardian Angels to the whole Earth.\nNow, thefe two forts of Spirit, viz. the Guar-\ndian Angels, the good Spirits detach'd, as I may\nand did call it, from Heaven, to have the Infpedtion\nover, and Care of his new Creation, as well here\nas elfewhere 5 thefe, and the Devih^ that other fort\nof Angels, of whom I may have Occafion to fpeak\n(more than a great deal) in this Work 5 Thefe, I fay,\nmay, and do appear, and all Apparition is really be-\ntween them i all Spirit you can fpeak of, or pretend\nto fee the Appearance of, muft be one of thefe two,\ninuft be Jngel or Dm\/, there is no other, there\ncan\n\fi8 The Hijlory afid Reality\ncan be no other: Miracle, and fomething more than\nmiraculous, and Things which we have no Reafon.\nto look for, only excepted.\nB u T on the other hand, as certain as that no o-\nther Spirit does, or can, and as certainly as they\ndo not, or cannot appear j fo as certain, and paft\ndifpute is it, that thcfe Spirits, both good and bad,\ndo appear to us upon all Occafions ; I mean all\nOccafions which they judge needful, and which\nhappens to them, whether by choice or conftraint.\nIt is not indeed in us to determine how they are\nmov'd to go upon thefe Errands, or in what man-\nner> I may perhaps give fome probable Opinions\nabout the Manner and Caufes both of their Miflion\nand Permiflion 5 for I take thofe two Heads to con-\ntain the Regulation of their A6tings j I fay d^mmif-\nfton and Permiffion^ and without thefe we are fure\nnever to be vifited in this manner, either by one or\nother.\nI T is true that this gives a confiderable Sanfbion\nto the Thing call'd Apparition in general, and\nmakes it appear to be more folemn than we are\nwilling to make ic> for by this Rule, neither De^\nvil or Angel appears but upon fome extraordinary\nOccafioni and if it be fo, I do not fee why we\n(hould like it the worfe 5 for if they were to fhew\nthemfelves upon every trifling Occafion, they\nwould either terrific Mankind fo as to make the\nWorld intollerable to him, or familiarife themfelves\nfo as not to be regarded.\nNow as it would be the Devil^ not the good\nSpirits, that would thus haunt the World upon\nTrifles $ (for the other cannot be fuppofed to do it)\nfo they would carry on the Familiarity too far, and\nMen would be fo far from being frighted and ter-\nrified at him, that in fhort there would be more\nDanger in the Intimacy j and, as we fay in another\nCafe,\n\fof APP ARiriONS. i2p\nCafe, Mankind, and the Devil mighc be too well\nacquainted.\nBut firft to the FaQ:, that thefe Spirits, both\ngood and bad, D o thus A p p e a r 5 and then to the\nReafon of it. That they do appear, the Hiflory,\nExperience, and Report of all Ages confirm it>\nthey always have, and ftill do. The Appearances of\nSpirits are confirmed many ways, Hiftory is fuUof\nExamples 5 and facred Hiftory itfelf, tho' it does not\ngive Relation of particular Apparitions, yet con-\nfirms the thing, as a Reality, and out of Queftion.\nChrist himfelf, after his Refurreftion, feeing\nhis Difciples frighted and terrified at his Appearance,\ntakes a great deal of Pains to convince them that\nhe was not a Spirit or an Apparition, as they feared\nhuke xxiv. \\j, 'They were terrified and affrighted<y and\nfuppos*d that they had feen a Spirit, This would be\nwhat it is too difhonourable to fay of the facred\nWrit, if Apparition of Spirit in the Shape of Bo-'\ndy did never come^ and that there were no fuch\nthing in Nature.\nSee then what our blefled Lord fays to them\nupon it, V, 3p. Behold my Hands and my Feetj\nthat it is Imyfelf: handle me^ andfee j for a Spirit hath\nnot Flejh and Bones^ as ye fee me have. This is as\ndire\u00a3t and pofitiye as any thing of its kind can\nbe fuppos'd, or defir'd to be. If there were no\nfuch things as Spirits appearing, how could Jefus\nChrifthavc exprefled himfelf in fuch a manner? the\nLanguage is plain, You think you fee a Spirit, that\nis an Apparition, and you may have fome Reafons\nfor your Apprehe.nfion, becaufe I came in thus un-\nfeen, when the Door was fhut ; Now a Spirit\nmay indeed afTume a Shape, and look like the Per-\nfon it appears for j but if you were to come near\nto it, you would find a Spirit, an Apparition, has\nonly the Appearance, it has not Fkfj and Bones as\nK you,\n\ftjo 7^^ Htjlory and Reality\nyou fee me have : Therefore I am not a SpeEire or\nApparition^ but a real Body.\nSo when he came walking upon the Sea to his\nDifciples, and they were fo frighted that they cried\nout, believing that they had feen a Spirit 5 it mail\nbe out of Queftion that there were fuch things, and\nthat they, the Difciples, had heard of them j nay,\nperhaps, they had feen fuch Apparitions themfelves\nbefore thatj why elfe fliould they be fo frighted as\nto cry out, Matth, xiv. 2(5. And when the Difciples\nfaw him walking on the Sea^ they were troubled^ fay\"\ningy It is a Spirits and they cried out for fear. And\nwhy, when our Saviour fpoke to them, did he not\nreprove them for being frighted at their own Ima-\ngination, and fancy, (like Children,) that they faw a\nSpirit, when there were no fuch things in the\nWorld, and no Apparitions to be feen?\nOn the other hand he fpeaks kindly to them,\nknowing that Apparitions are frightful Things to\nPeople not ufcd to fee them, and bids them he of\ngood Cheer^ it is not a Spirit, it is \/, he not afraid %\n'tis no Apparition, but myfelf in reality. So alfo\nyou have the Story, Mark vi. fO.\nAgain, you have a perfe6l Defcription of an\nApparition in the very manner we are juft now\ndifcourfing about ir. Job iv. if, t6. Then a Spirit\nfaffed before my Face^ the Hair of myTlefh fioodup. It\nflood fiiU<y hut I could not difcern the Form thereof: an\nImage was before mine Eyes^ there was ftlence^ and I\nheard a Voice, Eliphaz was a Man of Senfe, he was\nnot deluded to fpeak of Things not in Being, he\nfaw an Apparition, not a Fancy.\nAgain, Jofhua faw an Apparition, as I mentioned\nonce before, Jofh. v. i^. A Man with a drawn\nSword in his Hand, This was an Angel, that is to\nfay a Spirit, and yet it fpoke to him, and had the\nShape of a Man in Arms, with a Sword in his\nHand,\n\fof APPARITIONS. 131\nHand. Had Jojhuci ofFer'd to touch it, or been per-\nmitted to touch it, he would not have found it had\nFlefi and Bones -y we have our Saviour's Words for\nit, j1 Spirit has not Flesh and B o n e s > an Ap-\nparition is a Spirit affuming a Shape of Flefli and\nBlood, but without the Reality.\nAnd this Anfwers all thofe fanciful People who\nfay to us, that they faw fuch or fuch a Perfon : I\nfaw him, fays the Ignorant frighted Vifionifb, per-\nfe6i:ly ! I know him well enough ! I am fure 'twas\nhim ! I faw him plainly ! Hence they conclude ic\nmuft be the Soul of fuch a Perfon, becaufe, fay\nthey, it had his very Countenance and his Cioaths\non : nay, riding on the fameHorfe as he us'd to ride\non : when the truth of the Cafe is this, the Man is\ndead, his Body rotting in the Grave, his Soul car-\nried into the remote Regions of eternal Felicity\nor Horror unalterable, and that immoveable, as to\nreturning this Way : his Cioaths that were feen,\nare lying in the Cheft, or the Prefs, where they\nufually lay, and the poor Horfe grafing in the\nField, or perhaps quiet in the Stable, and not ac\nall difturb'd. All that is to be faid, the good An-\ngel that perhaps had fome fecret Commillion to the\nRclid or Remains of the Man's Family 5 to give\nthem Notice of fome Evil, to warn, to admonifli, (^c,\naflumes the Shape and Appearance of the Man him-\nfelf, cioaths himfelf in his Likenefs, forms the\nApparition in Air, of his Cioaths, his Countenance,\nhis Horfe, as a Painter cloathes the Cloth he paints\non with Faces, Poftures, Habits, Garments, all in\nColours, while the paffive Perfon reprefented is no\nway affeded with, or concerned in the Draught\nreprefenting him.\nAnd why fnould not this Spirit, thus commif-\nfion'd to go on fuch an Errand, be able to amufe\nus with the Appearance of a Perfon departed > ta-\nking up his Shape, Countenance, Cioaths, ^c.\nK z tho'\n\f132. The Hijlory and Reality\ntho' the Soul of the Perfon is not affe6led with,\nor concern'd in it? when it is known that we of-\nten fee Apparitions of Perfons living, whom we fee\nand fpeak to, and converfe with j know their Faces,\ntheir Voices, their Cloathsj and yet the Perfons\nthemfelves know nothing of the matter.\nI HAVE by me a very diverting Hiflory upon\nthis Subjedb, which I fhall abridge for the prefent\npurpofe, as follows, viz.\nA CERTAIN young Lady of born in\nthe County of had been long courted by\na young Gentleman, whofe Father had a very good\nEftate in the fame Town : fhe had kept him Com-\npany too openly, but had not yielded to his Im-\nportunities for a criminal Converfation, tho' her\nReputation fuffer'd for it as if fhe hadj but at\n4 length (he was fo far over-perfuaded, that fhe made\nan Appointment to be at fuch a time at a Far-\nmer's Houfe, a Tenant of his Father's, and who\nwere, it fecms, let into the wicked Secret.

For 'tis plain it could not be the Do6tor.\nThen, fays foe, it muft be fome heavenly Ap-\npearance in the Do6tor's Cloaths, for I knew not\nhis Face and his Voice only, but his very Gownj\nand if it was a good Angel, I have the more rea-\nfon to be thankful that he hindred me from running\ninto the Arms of the Devil: and with that ihe fell a\ncrying, fhe could hold out no longer.\nWell, they parted after this Scuffle, for he\nwas a little daunted himfelf.\nBut my Story does not end here > for a little\nwhile after fomething happen'd that explained all\nthe reft : The Lady had a Vifit to pay at a Neigh*\nhour's Houfe, who liv'd a little out of the Town,\nonly over one little Enclofure, which fhe was ob*\nlig'd to crofs : Now as fhe was going over that\nClofe or Enclofure, who fhould fhe meet but the\nDodor again 5 and Ihe faw him a good while before\nhe came up to her.\nShe was furpriz'd at feeing him 5 and if fhe\ncould have avoided him fhe would : but 'twas im-\npoflible. When he came up to her, he pull'd off his\nHat very courteoufly, and immediately began to\nLi diicourfe\n\f148 The Hifiory and Reality\ndifcourfe of what he had faid to her before > but\ntook no Notice at all of its having been deny'd.\nSir, fays fie^ I have been very ill us'd upon that\nDay's Work.\nI KNOW it, fa.ys he^ I know it, repeating the\nWords : But your Innocence fhall be cleared up,\nI will do it my felf 5 do you be thankful that you\nefcap'dthe Snare: And fo, giving her no time toan-\nfwer, he pafs'd by her without taking any farewell:\nwhich being a little Particular, made her turn her\nHead to look at him : But tho' it was in the mid-\ndle, of the Field, which was too large for him to\nbe out of it if he had flown as fvvift as a Pidgeon,\n(for it was not above a Moment, not a Second of\nTime) he was gone, and fhe faw nothing.\nShe was exceedingly furpriz'd, and ready to\nfink into the Ground 3 ihe was fo frighted that fhe\ncould not help fitting down even upon the Grafs j\nfor her Joints trembled under her, fo that fhe could\nnot fland.\nI T happen'd that a poor Woman of the Town\ncame crofs the Clofe at the very jun6ture, and\nknowing her, fhe call'd to her to come and help\nher up. She did not tell the Woman what had hap-\npen'd to her, but that fhe was taken with a fit of\ntrembling, and that if fhe had not fat down fhe\nmufl have fallen down j all which was true : fo the\npoor Woman help'd her up, and led her home,\nwhere fhe continued very ill of the Fright for fe-\nveral Days.\nIn this time fhe had a very great defire to fee the\nGentleman, for by what the Apparition faid to\nher fhe made no doubt but he had feen ic too.\nAfter feme time he had heard that fhe was\nvery ill, and thinking what he had faid to her\nmight have had fome influence upon her, to hurt\nher, he refolv'dto go and fee her 5 for tho' he had\nrulHed her pretty much 5 yet, as he faid afterwards,\nhe\n\fof AP PARITIO NS. 149\nlie lov'd her very well 5 and the better for her fo\nleafonably recovering her Virtue and good Princi-\nples 5 and much better than he believ'd he fhould\nhave done, if he had had his Will of her, as he\nfliould certainly have had, if (he had met him that\ntime at the Farmer's.\nWith thefe kind Thoughts he went to vific\nher> and tho' fhe was very ill, yet fhe would be\nbrought out of her Chamber to fee him.\nAfter fomc Civilities, he frankly told her the\nreafon of his Vifit word for word as above, and\nthat he came to chear her up a little.\nShe thank'd him 5 but told him it was true it\nhad extremely troubled her, to think firft how\nnear fhe had been to her utter Ruin, and then how\nneedlefly fhe had been expos'd for it 5 and that tho*\nJQie had no Guilt, as he very well knew, other than\nthat which was in the firft wicked Confenting; yet\nfhe had been as much expos'd, as if fhe had been\nreally his Whore.\nHe protefted to her that he never had opened\nhis Lips of it to the Do6tor, or any one elfe y and\nthat it was the Refentment at the charging him\nwith it, that had made him fo angry, and nothing\nelfe 'y for that he fcorn'd any thing fo bafe.\nShe told him it was impoflible for any one to\nbelieve otherwife before 5 but that fhe believ'd he\nwas fatisfied how it all was, now 5 and that fome-\nthing had happen'd fince, which had open'd her\nEyes, tho' it hadalmoft kill'd her 5 and ihe believ'd\nhe knew fomething of it too.\nHe wanted to know what it was, .for he pro-\ntefted he knew nothing. What fays he^ is there\nany more Myfteries?\nSHE faid^ fhe could not tell him, becaufe fhe\nfuppos'd he would not believe her.\nHE anfwer'd^ he would believe her in every\nthing, that he ousht to believe any body in.\nL 3\nSHE\n\f1 JO The Hijiory and Reality\nS HE told him^ flie believ'd there would be no\noccafion to tell him, for that fhe did not doubt\nbfit he would be inform'd the fame way that fhe\nWas, if he was not already.\nHe importuned her earneftly to let him know\nwhat it was} and that with fuch a ferious kind of\nDifcourfe, that fhe fancy'd he had feen fomething\ntoo J but it fccms he had not: However he en-\ntreated her fo much, that at laft fhe let him know\nthe whole Story, as above.\nThere is a great deal more belongs to this\nStory, which would be very diverting, and not\nwithout its Ufes too > but as the particular Rela-\ntion docs not come within the verge of my own\nKnowledge, I cannot vouch all the Particulars, at\nleafl not fufficiently.\nHowever, 'tis enough to the Cafe in hand :\nIf the Apparition came to prevent this poor de-\nluded young Lady from proilituting her felf to a\nMan that had wheedled her in upon fuch difhonou-\nrable Terms > it could not certainly be the Devily\nor any Spirit of his Clafs, or under his Govern-\nment and Dire6tioni he would never have exhorted\nher to go back, reproached her with the Crime,\nand prevail'd upon her to believe it had been re-\nveaPd to him by the Treachery of her Lover.\nThis mufl be certainly one of thofe Angelick\nGuards which the God of Nature, in Mercy to\nMankind, has placed as a detach'd Body of Spirits\nto counter-a6b the Devily prevent the Arch-ene-\nmy feducing his Creatures, and over- whelming the\nWorld with Crime 5 and if the Story be as 1 have\nreceiv'd it and now handed it down, it feems a\nmerciful Difpofition of Providence in Favour of\nthe Gentleman, as well as the Lady 5 and be it a Pa-\nrable or a Hiftory, the Moral is the fame, and the\nImprovement of it the fame too: They that are\nrunning the fame Courfe of Folly would have Rea-\nfon\n\fof APPARITIO NS. iji\nfon to be very thankful if they were fure to meet\nwith the fame kind of Difappointmenr, and would\nnever fay it was the Devil that told it them.\nThe Gentleman it feems did not flight the\nStory fo much as fhe expe61:ed he would, nor did\nhe queftion the Truth of any or every Part of it ;\nfor fhe told it with fo much Steadinefs, always a-^\ngreeing in every Particular, and gave fo concur-\nring Accounts of the Circumftances as they related\nto what had happened before, that it was appa-\nrent 'twas no Delufion.\nThat which made him moil unealy, was that\nthe Apparition feem'd to promife to appear to\nhim 5 and he had no Defire to be convinc'd that\nway. Indeed the Story, at lead fo far as I have the\nParticulars, breaks off a little abruptly there and\ndoes not fay whether he ever faw any thing or no.\nBut it faid, it made him be quite another Man in\nhis Way of living than ever he was before 5 and\nparticularly he was very thankful that he had been\nprevented being fo wicked with her as in all Pro*\nbability he had been, if this had not happen'd.\nNow this Apparition, as is faid above, could not\nwith any manner of Reafon, be fuppofcd to be the\nDevil 'y for why fhouid an Evil Spirit appear, to\nkeep any Perfon from doing Evil ? Why fhouid it\naflume a real Shape, namely that of a Minifter in his\nGown and Caflbck, and that it was in Appearance\nthe very Minifter of the Parithj for all this fhe con-*\nHantly affirm'd, and two things are natural Infe-^\nrences from it,\nFIRST^ That the Appearance was real.\nSECONDLY^ That it was a good Spirit.\nLet the Divines read us Le6tures upon the\nNature of Spirits, and upon how far they can or\ncannot take Cognizance of human Affairs j That I\nhave nothing to do with here 5 ray Bufinefs is to\nohferve the Matter of Fa6b, viz, that they do come\nL 4 hither.\n\fiji The Hifiory and Reality\nhither, do appear, and are feen, talk'd to and con*\nvers'd with, and that they do come on good Errands,\nand therefore are not likely to be evil Spirits or\nDevils.\nTake another Hiftorical Relation, which, tho'\nI name no Names, I have very good Authority for\nthe Truth of, and that more particularly than for\nthe other.\nA Gentleman of a very good Eftate mar-\nried a Lady of alfoa good Fortune, and had one Son\nby her, and one Daughter, and no more, and after a\nfew Years his Lady died. He foon married a fecond\nVenter 5 and his fecond Wife, tho' of an inferior Qua-\nlity and Fortune to the former, took upon her to dif-\ncourage and difcountenance his Children by his firft\nLady, and made the Family very uncomfortable,\nboth to the Children and to their Father alfo.\nThe firft thing of Confequence which thisCon-\ndu6t of the Mother-in-Law produced in the Family,\nwas that the Son, who began to be a Man, ask'd the\nFather's Leave to go abroad to travel. TheMothcr-\nin-Law, tho' willing enough to be rid of the young\nMan, yet becaufe ic would require fomething con-\nfiderable to fupport his Expenccs abroad, violently\noppos'd it, and brought his Father alfo to refufe\nJiim, after he had freely given him his Confent.\nThis fo afFe6ted the young Gentleman, that\nafter ufing all the dutiful Applications to his Father\nthat he could poffibly do, as well by himfelf as by\nfome other Relations, but to no purpofe j and being\na little encouraged by an Uncle, who was Brother\nto his Mother, his.

And when he\ncame to the Counting-houfe Door, there fat his\nMan with the Book-keeper alfo, writing as he Icfc\nhim.\nIt happened juft that Moment, fome occafion\nextraordinary oblig'd him to ftep back again, and\ngo up Stairs to the Dining-Room, from whence he\ncame 5 and intending not to flay, he did not fpeak\nto the young Man, but left him in the Counting-\nhoufe, and went immediately up Stairs.\nI T was not poflible that he, or any one elfe, ex-\ncept fuch as could walk invifible, could go by, or pafs\nhim unfeen : Good Manners would have hindered the\nyoung Man from thrufting by his Mafter upon the\nStairs, if he had been gonig up ; but he is pofitive\nhe did not, and cou'd not pafs, without beine\nfeen.\nBut when he came to the top of the Stairs\nthere fat the young Man at Dinner with the other\nServants J the Room they din'd in being a little\nParlour, which opcn'd juft againft the Stairs, fo\nthat he faw him all the way of the upper Part of\nthe Stair-cafe, and could not be deceived.\nThe Maftef did not fpeak to him, which he\nwas very forty for afterwards > but the Surprize\nmade him pafs by the Room, and go into the Di-\nning-Room, which was to the right Hand of it,\nbut he fent one immediately to look, and he was\nthere really at Dinner > fo that what he (the Ma-\nfter) faw below in the Counting-houfe, muft be the\nApparition, as it certainly was.\nBut this was not all : The young Gentleman em-\nbark'd as above, and arriv'd fafe with all his Effe6b\nin America^ tho' he never liv'd to return. However,\nI cannot fay his Apparition in the manner as related\ncould have the leaft Relation to his being fick,\nand dying abroad, which was not 'till three\nYears\n\fof APPARiriONS. 169\nYears afterwards. But what follow'd was of another\nkind.\nThis young Man had an elder Brother, who\nliv'd in London 'y he was a fine Gentleman, and\na Scholar, and was at that time ftudying Phyfick.\nHe was alfo a flout brave Gentleman, and in partir\ncular underflood a Sword, that is to fay how to ufe\na Sword, as well as mofl Gentlemen'^in England.\nHe had an accidental Rencounter with a Gentle-\nman in the Street, in that fhort Street which goes\nout of Fleet-ftreet into Salisbury-Court -y and being\nfo compleat a Mafler of his Weapon, he wounded\nhis Antagonift, and drove him into a Tavern in the\nStreet, from whence came out two Men more up-\non him with their Swords, but both of them found\nthe Gentleman fo much an Over-match for them,\nthat they left him as fall as the firflj whereupon a\nfourth came our, not with a Sword, but a Fire-\nFork taken haftily up out of the Tavern Kitchen, and\nrunning at this Gentleman with it, knock'd him\ndown, and broke his Skull, of which Wound he\nafterwards died.\nWhile this was done in London^ his Brother,\nas far off as Bofton in New-England^ writing to his\nMafler the Merchant, (and who gives this Accounc\nof it) after other Bufinefs, writ this Poflfcript.\nS IR^ I heg you will he pleas'd in your Return ta\nthis to let me havefeme Account^ as much as conve-\nniently may he^ of how my Brother does^ and\nwhat Condition he is in 5 which you will excufe\nmy Importunity for^ when you read the follow^\ntng Acccotint^ (viz.)\n'THE iQth of\u2014 laft^ ahout fix a Clock in the\nMorning^^ lying in my Bed^ and broad awake^ my Bro^\nther^ or an Apparition of my Brother^ came to the.\nBed's Feet^ and open'd the Curtain^ looking full in my\nJ^acey but did not [peak, I was very much frighted^ but\nhowever\n\f170 T^^ Hifiory and Jkedlity\nhonioever Jfo far recovered as to fay to him^ Bfothe^^\nwhat is the matter with you ?\n\u00ab HE had a Napkin-Cap on his Head^ which was\n' very bloody^ he lookd very pale and ghafily^ and\n* faid^ I am hafely murther'd by -^-\u2014^ naming the\n* Perfon^ but I fhall have Jufiice done me 5 and\n* then difappeafd.\nNow this Letter was fo dated, that it was im-\npoflible any Account could be fent of the Difafter,\nthat could reach thither in that time 5 for it was\nfiot dated above fourteen Days after the Fa6t was\ncommitted in London '^ and that it was Genuine I\nam well affur'd, becaufc I faw the Letter within\nan Hour after it was received in London^ read it my\nfelf, and knew the young Mgn's Hand, and the\nyoung Man alfo perfeftly well, as I did his Brother\nthat was kill'd alfo, very intimately.\nThe young Man was fober, religious and fenfi-\nble, riot given to Whimfie, or light-headed Fancies,\nnotvapourifhordiftemper'd, not apt to fee double, or\nto dream waking, as many of our Apparition-making\nPeople arej he was befides that a Scholar, and\nvery ferious : the firft 1 mention as a Prote6l:ion to\nhim from foolifli Imagination, and the lait from\nFalftiood ; and I am fatisfy'd, the Reader may de-\npend upon both the Stories, 1 mean as to the Truth\nof them.\nI N my fpeaking of Apparitions as I have flated\nthe Cafe, I muft take leave to differ from the No-\ntions of the Ancients, who 'tis evident underftood\nall Apparition to be the Souls, or as we call them,\nthe Ghofts, of departed Perfonsj but when they\ncame to make rational Conclufions from thofe firlt\nOpinions, What wild Additions were they driven\nto make, to the firft juft Conceptions which they\nhad form'd in their Minds ?\n\fof APPARITIONS. 171\nTheir firft Conceptions^ \/ fay^ were indeed jufi:,\nconfiftent with Reafon, and with Nature j for they\nconcluded, that when the Body is dead, and the\nSoul feparated, the State was determin'd. This\nMr. Pope exprefles very well in his Tranflation of\nHorner^\nFor to the farther \u2022\nShore ^\nWhen once we pafs^ the Soul returns no more.\nThis was, I fay, a rational and juft Sentiment\nj\nbut then they were confounded in all thofe Imagi-\nnations, by feeing^hc Apparitions of their departed\nFriends, as if come back from thofe eternal Shades >\nand how to reconcile this they did not know.\nT o get over this Difficulty^ they were driven to\nftrange Shifts, and feme of them it muft be con-\nfefs'd were very foolifli ones: fuch as thefej\nI. That the Soul wandered about in the Air,\n'till fuch time as the Body obtained its due Funeral\nRites : from this Notion, the Friends of the deceaffd\nwere mightily concern'd to fee the Funeral Pile\ncrefted for their departed Friends, and to have the\nBody honourably burned j then the Alhes of the\nBones were depofited in an Urn, and that Urn bury'd\nin the Earth j when this was done the Soul was admit-\nted to pafs the Flood, (that is) to be tranfported into\nthe Elyfian Fields, from whence they never ihould\nreturn any morej but in cafe thefe Rites were not\nperformed for any Perfon, the Soul wandered reftlefs,\nand unfix'd, in a ftatc of Perplexity, for an hundred\nYears.

HOMER'S Notion of the State of the Dead,\nWas fomething like the ancient Philofophy of the\njEgyptians^ which gave the Soul a Shape like the\nBody, and that it v\/as only a Receptacle of the\nMind 5 the Mind they made to be the fublime and\nfuperior Part, and that only.\nThus in the Cafe of Apparitions, they allow'd\nthat this Cafe or Shell call'd the Soul, might ap-\npear after Death, but the Mind could nor, but\nwas exalted among the Gods, and took up its Eter-\nnal Abode > from whence\n\u00ab5 \/\/ could return no more. Thus\n\fefJiPPARltlONS.

They imagin'd\nthat the Soul was not only feparated by Death from\nthe Body, but that there was a Separation of the\niJnderftanding from its Gafe or Vehicle, as thejr\ncaird it 5 fo that the Soul, which was but the 1-\nmage and Form of the Body, might be in Hell j\nthe Body it felf burnt to Afhes remained in the\nUrn 5 and the Underftanding or Mind, which was\nthe fublime divine Parr, be in Heaven with the\nGods : This Homer exprefTes thus,\n'7\/V certain Man^ thd* dead^ retains\nPart of himfelf'y the immortal Mind remains\n\u00bb\nThe Form fuhfifis without the Body's Aid^\nAerial Semblance^ and an empty Shade.\nAgain he explains it in his Odyffey^ lib. xi. line\nCoo. fpeaking in the Name of Ulyjfes^\nNow I the Strength of Hercules behold\nj\nA Towring Spectre of Gygantick Mouldy\nAJhadowy Form ! For high in Heav'n's Abodes\nHimfelf refides^ a God among the Gods,\nHere Homer fancies Hercules^ that is the Mind,\nthe fublime Part of Hercules,, was in Heaven, an4 ex-\nalted there to the higheft Degree too j\nA God among the Gods.\nand\n\f3 74 ^^ Hiftory and Reality\nand yet at the fame time his Soul, his etcJ^cSKov or\nImage, was in Hell. And Plutarch gives us the fame\nDefcription at large.\nWhat learned Nonfenfe, and wfiat a great\ndeal of it is here, to reconcile a thing, which upon\nthe Cbriftian Foundation is made as eafie, as any\nthing not immediately vifible to the common Eye,\ncan be made?\nNature diftated, and Reafon confirm'd, that\nthe firft Principle, namely, the Soul, or as they\ncall it, the Mind or Underftanding, fled to Heaven\nimmediately after Death, and return'd no more.\nThus Andromache mourning for the Lofs of her\nHusband Heiior^ is brought in fpeaking according\nto the Doftrinc of the Ancients\n:\n'thou to the dtfmal Realms for ever gone^\nAnd I abandoned. ^ -*\nThe Dead once pafs'd to the difmal Realms (as\nthey caird the Shades below) were gone for ever^ and\nto return no more \u2022, but then they were perplex'd to\nfind that they did return, as in this Cafe ok Patro*\nclus to Achilles j tho' that (by the way) was a Dream\nonly, not an Apparition, or as we may call it an\nApparition in a Dream, and no more.\nBut they had their Apparitions, and we read of\nmany Apparitions of the Dead to the Livings as\nparticularly in the famous Example of defar ap-\npearing to Brutus : and this perplex'd them fo, that\nthey knew not how to fupport the Principle of the\nSoul not returning, under the Experience of Souls\nadtually returning in Apparition, vifiring and con-\nverfing with their Friends, which was incontefti-\nble, daily Experience making it known to all\nParties.\nTo reconcile this they fled to Invention, and\nfirlt to that of the Interval between the Death and\nthe\n\fof APPARITION S. 175\nthe Funeral of the departed Souls 5 of which be-\nfore.\nBut this is liable to fo many juft Exceptions,\nfo many Abfurdities, that it could not fatisfie Men\nof Senfe 5 for firft they were obliged to fay and\nprove, (which would be very difficult) that none of\nthe Souls of the Dead ever appeared after the Fune-\nral Rites were folemnizedj which if one Example\nhad contradided, all the Arguments in the Worl4\ncould not then have fupported the Fiftionj and\nthis I cannot doubt was contradifted on many Oc-\ncafions.\nAnp this no doubt made the ancient Syftem of\nthe JEgyptlam be reviv'd, and pafs better among\nthem afterwards 5 tho' whether the Romans receiv'di\nit or no, we do not find afcertain'd in any Part of\ntheir Hiftory.\nBesides, there was an Abfurdity in the very\nDo6trinc it felfj for if the Apparition of a departed\nSoul was limited by this Circumilance of burning\nthe Body, or performing the Funeral Rites 5 it put\nthe State of the Dead in that particular Refpc6b into\nthe Power of the Living : for Example^ If the Living,\nwho had PofTeffion of the dead Bodies of Perfons\nflain, fuppofe them Friends, had PoflefHon of the\nBody, the Soul of that Body, tho' unembodied and\ndifmifs'd, could not be admitted to reft, or as they\nexprefs'd it, could not pafs into the Shades or Realms\nbelow J fo if the Enemy had PofTeffion of the Body,\nit was in the Power of the Enemy to keep the\nSoul out of Heaven : an Abfurdity fo grofs, one\nwould think the wifer Heathens could never enter-\ntain fuch a Thought: Yet that fuch it was, the\nWords of Patrodus's Ghoft quoted from Homer\nmakes evident.\nLet my pale Corfe the Rites of Burial kmw^\nj^fid give me Entrance, in the Shades below,\nUnhap-\n\ft7^ 7^^ Hiflory and Reality\nIJnhappy Patrodusf How gro(s would thi^\nfound, how harfh and unmufical in our Times,\nwhen Chriftianity has given us more juft Ideas of\nthings ? Patrodus could not get leave to go to the\nShades below, 'till his Funeral Rites were per-\nformed 3 that is, in our Senfc, could not be admitted,\nno not into Hell it fclf, 'till his Body was burn'd\non the Funeral Pile or Pyre, and his Aihes depo-\nfited in an Urn 3 that is, buried like a Gentleman.\nB Y which Rule, the Souls of thofe poor Crea-\ntures who were killed in the Wars, and were left\nunburied in Heaps in the Field, or only a Pile of\nStones thrown upon them, as was often the Cafe,\nare wandring ftill, and neither admitted into Hea-\nven or Hell.\nAgain, it was in the Power of the Enemy, if\nhe had a Body in Pofleflion, to prefervc his Hatred\nagainfl that Enemy even beyond Death, and by keep-\ning him unburied, keep his Soul or Spirit fufpended,\nwandring, and forgotten in the Air, and neither ad-\nmitted to one or other Place, whether above or\nbelow.\nThus Achilles had the Body of He^or in his\nPower twelve Days, and Homer brings him in\ntriumphing over his Enemy in that cafe, and in a\nmanner unworthy of a Man of Honour. When he\nfpeaks to the Ghoft of his Friend Patrodus^ and\nvows to facrifice twelve Trojan Prifoners at his Fu-\nneral Pile j he adds,\nAchilles' Promife is compleat^\nThe bloody \\iit6kox ftretch'd before thy Feet^\nLo ! to the Dogs his Carcafe I refign*\nGloomy he faid^ and horrible in Fiew^\nBefore the Bier the bleeding Heflor threiv^\nProne on the Duft\u00bb\nIliad lib. xxiii. line 3f.\nSo\n\fof APPARITION S. \\77\nSo again, Achilles mourning over the Body of Pa-\ntrodus as it lay on the Funeral Pile, and the Fire\nnot yet kindled j I fay, there again he threatens to\ndeny He5tor a Soldier's Burial.\nBut heavier Fates on HeftorV Corfe attend^\nKept from the Flames for hungry Dogs to rend.\nThis was a terrible Curfe, and very cruel to poor\nHeBor after he was dead, not to fuffer his Soul to\nenter into the Shades below, which would be (to fpealc\nit in our Language) not to give him leave to go to\nHell 5 that the Gods it feems thwarted Achilles^\nand would not let his Cruelty take place, but he\nwas oblig'd to grant Priam a Truce, and let the\nTrojans bury him.\nSo [pake he^ threatning : But the Gods made vain\nHis Threat^ and guard inviolate the Slain,\nCeleftial Venus hover'd o'er his Head^\nAnd rofeat Unguents^ heavenly Fragrance ! Jhed',\nShe watch'd him all the Nighty and all the Day^\nAnd drove the Blood-hounds from their dejlin'd Prey,\nSo that the Burying of HeBor was made the Care\nof the Gods, defeating the cruel Vengeance of\nAchilles.\nTo what Length did this foolifh Notion of the\nAncients carry this Point ! putting it into the Power\nof a Man's Enemy to keep his Soul out of Heaven\ntoo, as long as his Enemy thought fit to keep the\nBody out of the Grave.\nH A p p Y it is for us in thefe malicious Days that\nit is otherwife here> when not Enemies only, but\neven cruel Creditors, might arreft the dead Body of\ntheir Debtor, and even fend the Soul of him to the\nDevilJ\nor keep it hovering and wandring in the Air\n'till their Debts were paid : As Times go noWj and\nN as\n\f78 The Hijiory ^nd Reality\nas Charity ftands now rated among us, no poor\nDebtor could be at Reft any more after he was Dead,\nthan he could before, 'till his Debts were all paid.\nNay, tho' it had pleas'd a merciful Father to\nforgive him his Sins, and as we allow it*s poffible,\nin fpite of the cruel f ^S*\n\u2022 that a\nBrankrupt may die in the State of a pardoned Peni-\ntent j yet I fay 'till the Debt was paid the more\ninexorable Creditor Ihould refufe to let him be ad-\nmitted into Heaven 'till he was paid the utmoft\nFarthing.\nI MUST confefs if this were the Cafe among\nus, I believe it would be the hardeft thing in the\nWorld to get a poor Bankrupt's Compofition ac^\ncepted, or his Certificate figned > for if it was in\nthe Power of the Creditors to fend their Debtors\nto the Devil^ I fhould be apt to fiy with the Di-\nfciples of our Lord, Who then Jljall he faved?\nHow often do we find a Creditor give it for an\nAnfwer, when a folliciting Friend comes begging\nhim to compound, and to accept the utmoft Shil-\nling that the Debtor has to offer: How often, \/\nfay^ do we find the cruel Creditor reply. No not \/,\nrilfign none of it^ the Devil fiall ha^ve him before I'll\nfign it?\nNay, if his Soul was to hover in the Air, as\nthe Ancients fancy'd, 'till the Body was buried > I\nqueftion whether they would let the Debtor go ei-\nther to Heaven or Hell 'till they had their Money\n;\ncfpecially if the hovering or wandering in the Air\nwas a worfe Condition, as 1 don't know but, while\nthe Devils are faid to be there, it may.\nBut to return to the Ancients and their Noti-\non of Futurity, and of Souls departed, the Diffi-\nculty, as 1 have obferved, was very perplexing :\nThey granted that after the Souls of Men were\nonce determined, and tranfported in Charon's Ferry-\nboat to the other fide of the River i'\/j.v, or the\nSty^\n\fof APPARITIONS. 17^\nStygian Gu\\^h^ they could return no more 5 and all\ntheir other Fables upon that Subje6t would have\nbeen overthrown and come to nothing, if it had\nbeen otherwife j fuch as Cerberus barking continual-\nly at the Gate, Charon the Ferry-man carrying all\nover but bringing none back, and the like.\nBut notwithltanding this, as I have laid, they\nfound feveral of thefe Souls vifiting the World in\nApparition, and this quite deftroy'd all the Scheme\nof their being in a detcrmin'd State > fo that they\nknew not what to think of next.\nHow would it have unravell'd all thofe hard\nKnots, and made every thing eafie to their Under-\nHanding, had they been let into this juft way of\nreafoning ? had they difcover'd that there is an An-\ngelick World, an invifible World of Spirits, fomc\nof whom being placed by their merciful Maker,\nas an advanc'd Body, at or near the outer Circum-\nference of the Earth's Atmofphere, have a Power\ngiven them at lead to take Cognizance of human\nAffairs 5 and to converfe with this World, either\nby Apparition, Voices, Noifes, good or bad Omens,\nor other fenfible Conveyances to the Mind, by\nwhich they can give Notices of Good or Evil, and\ncan intimate to Man many things ufeful to him\nin the Condu6i: of his Life.\nThat t-he Spirits inhabiting this invifible World\nare at hand 5 (how near is not neceffary to us to\nknow) can affume Bodies, Shape, Voice, and even\ncan perfonate this or that Man or Woman > fo as\nto appear in the very Figure, Countenance, and\nCloaths or Drefs of our departed Friends, fpeak\nwith their proper and diftin6t Voices, and in the\nfirft Perfon of this or that particular Man or Wo-\nman, and in their Names 5 and can thus fuit them*\nfelves in their feveral Appearances, to the Occa-r\nfion they appear for;\nN z Had\n\fi8o The Hijlory and Reality\nHad they known thefc things, I fay, they\nwould have rejoic'd in the Difcovery, and it would\nhave made every thing eafie to them. Patrodus\nwould never have troubled Achilles with a Vifit\nfrom the Air, upon pretence of his being left to\nbe wandring about the Atmofphere for want of\nhis Funeral Rites > the Dogs, or the Crows, or the\nWorms might have fcafted themfelves on Hector's\nCarcafs, it would never have difturb'd HeSlor in the\nleaft, much lefs would her Goddefs-fhip Ferns have\nconcern'd herfelf to proted his Corps 'till the fu-\nneral Pile was prepared.\nThe Do6trine of the Soul's being a Shell or\nCafe form'd into a Shape, as a Mould is form'd into\nShape to receive the Brafs or Copper, and throw\nout a Statue or Figure of this or that Heroe, which\nit is appointed to form j I fay, this abfurd Do6trine\nof the Soul, Body and Mind being three diftin6b\nPerfons in every Man, would not have found Place\nin the World 5 but all things would have been\nconceiv'd regularly of, and the World would have\nbeen rightly inform'd of future things, as well as\nof things prefent.\nHowever, to bring it down to our Cafe, all\nthis concurs to the Dodbrine of Spirits, and the\nReality of their Appearance, which is the Cafe be-\nfore us: Their Friends departed did appear > what\nit was appear'd they knew not, only negatively\nthey knew it was not their Bodies, however the\nShape might be aflumed 5 nor could they reconcile\nthat Part to their Underftanding. How it could\nbe, that the Body feem'd to appear and did not\nappear 5 or, as we might fay, appear'd as if they\nhad appear'd 5 but when a Tryal was offer'd, no\nBody could be found, as was the Cafe of PatrO\"\nclus and Achilles in Horner^ which Mr. Pope thus\ntfanflatesj\nH8\ni\n\fof APPARITIONS. i8i\nHe faid^ and with his longing Arms ejfafd\nIn vain to gf'afp the vijionary Shade,\nLike a thin Smoke he fees the Sprit fly\n^\nAnd hears a feeble lamentable Cry.\nHow grofs an Ignorance is here in fo great a\nMan as Achilles ? to go about to grafp a Viiion ! to\nfeel a Shade ! One can hardly exciife the Poet for\nallowing Achilles^ who was the Heroe of the whole\nPoem, to be fo weak, even in thofe Days 3 but ic\nmuft be allowed 'twas all in a Dream, and imagi-\nnary, and it might well awake him indeed, as it\ndid, to grafp at a Man in Armour, and find nothing\nin his Arms but Smoke.\nThe Refult of it all is this, namely, the Re-\nality of Apparition was a certain, undoubted, and\nreceived thing -, 'tis evident that they were noc\nquelHonedj for upon the Reality of the Appear-\nance of Souls, all thofe Pains were taken to fettle\nthe Poffibility of it. That it was fo, the Fre-\nquency of the thing left them no Room to que-\nItionj it would have been ridiculous to have d'l^-\nputed it J but how it could be, how to reconcile\nit to all the Notions of Soul and Body, the fu-\nture and the prefent State, that was what no bo-\ndy could explain, and no body could undcrftand 5\nwhich Ignorance put their Invention fo much on the\nRack to find out and form Schemes fox the bringing\nthe Particulars together, and making the Appearance\npoffible, whichthey daily found was in Fad; real.\n'TwAs a little ftrange that tho' they were\nfatisfied by daily Demonilration that the Thing\nwas true, yet they were obliged to believe it was\nnot true at the fame time. They frequently faw\ntheir Friends appear, and yet knew they were not\nin a Condition from whence they could return to\nappear. But the ftrangeft thing of all, at lead to\nN J\nmcj\n\fiSz The Hijiory and Reality\nme, is, that they iliould not, all this while, con-\nceive the Poflibility of Spirits afTuming human\nShape, and appearing in their Figures, in their\nShapes, and in their Names.\nThis would have put an end to all the Dif-\nficulty, and have reconciled all the Doubts that\nattended it, and at the fame time would have led\nthem into feveral fublime Truths, fuch as they\nwere perhaps perfeftly ignorant of5 as particularly\ninto the great Dodrine of the Unity of infinite\npower 5 the univerfal Empire of Providence, and its\nGovernment and Influence of and upon all the\nAffairs of this World, even the mod minute things\nin Life 5 and many other valuable Inquiries.\nThat Apparitions were believed to be real in\nthofe Days, is evident from many Inftances of it given\nin Hiftory, tho' I have not room to look far back.\n'Tis faid ih^t y^Iexander the Great was haunted by the\nGhoft of his Friend Clitus^ whom he had moll un-\ngratefully tortur'd to Death, after a long Series of\nthe moft faithful Services, and fuccefsful alfo 5 but\nthere is no particular Account of it in Plutarch.\nThe Apparition of the Gholl of Julius Cafar\nto Brutus a little before the Battel at Philippic tho'\nit be certain, is neverthelefs varioufly reported 3\nfome i\\ccounrs relate it to be the Ghofl oi Julius\nC^far^ and vulgar Opinion concurs with that Re-\nport 3 which is fo received at this time, that they\nfliovv you an original antient Piece of fine Italian\nPainting at Naples^ where the Phantome is repre-\nfented bloody and wounded, with Cafca's Dagger\nflicking in his Shoulder, which he, Cafia^ reaching\nhis Arm over his Shoulder fix'd in or near his Col-\nlar Bone before, and left flicking there 5 according\nto which our Frontefpicce to this Work is at leaft\ndefign'd; Whether that Part of the Story be right\nreprefented or not, is difficult to determine.\nBut\n\fof APPARITIONS. 183\nB o T according to Other Accounts, the Appari-\ntion was only of a Man, without any Similicude\nof Cafars and that when Brutus^ who was bufy\nwriting Difpatches for his Army which was then\ndrawing together to fight the Oclavian Troops,\nlook'd up and faw him, he boldly ask'd, What art\nthou ?and the Apparition anfwer'd, lam thy evil Genius^\nand I will meet thee again at Philippi j to which the\nundaunted Hero, unconcern'd at the Sighj\", and as\nif he defir'd him not to dillurb him at that time,\nhe being then otherwife engaged, .anfwcr'd5 JVell^\nril meet thee there^ and fo went on with his wri-\nting.\nB RUTUS was, without doubt, a Fleroe in his\nperfonal Valour, and more fo in his Principle, viz.\nthe Love Of Liberty, and of his Country > and as\nnothing but the Zeal for the Liberty of his Coun-\ntry could have embark'd him againfl the Life of\nCafar^ who was otherwife his Benefadtor, fo he\nwas above the Fear of Death, and could not be in\nthe leaft daunted at the Fore-knowledge of his Fare\nat Philippic feeing he had the Notion of Life which\nwas general at that time, namely, that a true He-\nroe could never be miferable, (ince it was always\nin his Power to die a Freeman, and not to out-live\nany threatned Calamity, whether Perfonal or Na-\nlional.\nUpon this foot he enter'd that unequal Battel\nagainfl the O61avianXx00^^ with an undaunted Chear-\nfulnefsj for he was fure one way or other to come\n\u00a9ff vicloriousj that is to fay, that if Auguftus con-\nquered his Army, he knew how to conquer Auguftus 5\nif by the Slaughter of his Troops Cafar had the\nbetter of him and defeated his Dcfigns for the Li-\nberty of his Country, He, by the Slaughter of him-\nfelf, knew how to defeat Auguftus in his Defigns of\nconquering Brutus^ fince herefolv'd to die free, and\nnot furvive the Roman Liberty j and fo he did.\nN 4 Ani>\n\f184 7i^^ Hijloyy and Reality\nAnd upon this Foundation it was, that he was\nfo unconcerned at his approaching Fate, and- fo\nundaunted in his looking at and fpeaking to the\nSpectre that appeared to him.\nBut we have yet abundance more Proofs by\nExample of the Reality of Apparitions.\nALA RICH the famous GothkkYsJmg^ who o-\nver-run fo much of the Roman Empire, had an Ap-\nparition which came to him, and told him he\nfhould undertake his Expedition againft the Romans^\nand that promised him Vi6tory and Succefs 5 forae\nfaid it was an Angel, others that it was the Ghoft\nof his deceafed PredecefTor Rhadagaifeus, When he\nfirft undercook to raife his Army he v\/as intending\nto go upon a glorious Expedition to the Eaft, to\n*wit^ againft the Hunns and the Heruli 5 that is to\nfay, into Poland^ Schvonia and Hungaria^ and per-\nhaps Mufeovy or Rufjia. But upon the Apparition\nfpeaking to him, he was encouraged to undertake a\nWar againft the Romans in Italy^ where notwith-\nllanding he was routed and utterly ovei^hrown by\nStilico i he afterwards returned into Italy^ kill'd\nStillco the Roman General, over- run the Country,\nand took and plundered the City of Rome it felf j\nthis was Ann. 40P : fo that the Apparition,of what-\never kind it was, muft be fo far Angelic as to fore-\nknow Events and Iftiies of things on Earth, which\njDuft be fuitable to the Angelic Heavenly Spirits,\nand fuperior to the Diabolic Spirits who know\nnothing Prophetic.\nNor is it any thing inconfiftent with the An-\ngelic exalted and good Spirits > for this was not\nencouraging Evil, but ftirring up a powerful\nPrince, who was to be Flagellum Dei^ to exe-\ncute the Divine Vengeance upon that wicked Peo-\nple the Romans^ whom God had refolved to deftroy,\nor at leail to reduce very low : like as God is\nfaid\n\fof APPARITIO NS. i8j\n(aid to flir up Nebuchadnezzar King of Bahylon to\ncome up againft Jerufalem.\nI SAY this could not be the Devil, be-\n) caufe (as I have always infifted upon it, fo I do ftill)\nthat he knows nothing of what is to comej the\nDevil is no fProphet, he cannot foretell or predi6i:,\nother than by probable GuefTes, rational Confe-\nquences, and fuch Circumftances in which he can\ngo farther than other People.\nYou have an Example of this in the famous\nSorcerefs Jaquelina -, fhe pretended to fpeak in the\nName of the Devil, and fometimes to have the\nDevil fpeak in her, and fo to give Anfwers as by an\nOracle, and refolve Doubts and difficult Queftions,\nwhich flie did to Admiration 3 and thereby got both\nFame and Money. Now it was obferv'd that when\nPeople came to her with Doubts and difficult Cafes,\neven fuch as none could refolve, relating to things\npaft or prefent, her Anfwers were furprizing ; but\nif they came to her to ask any Opinion of things\nfuture, and what ihou-ld be to come, the Devil was\nalways Nonpluft, and generally lyed in his Anfwers\nj\nfo that none could depend upon any thing he faid.\nIn a word the Devil was not able to foretell any\nthing J and hence I infer, as I have always faid, the\nDevil is no Prophet, he can predi6t nothing, for\nhe knows nothings and thatif any Apparition comes\nto be feen or heard, who takes upon it to tell\nwhat fhould come to pafs, you may depend upon it\nthat Apparition is not from the Devil,\nHence 1 think we may readily account for\nthat Story fo well publifh'd, whether fo well\nknown or no,of which Mr. Aubrey has given us the\nlall; Relation, as follows :\n\"Two Perfons (Ladies) of Quality, both not\n'' being long lince deceafed, were intimate Acquain-\n^' tance,and lov'd each other intirely : It fo fell our,\n^^ that one of them fell fick of the Small-Pox, and\n\" deiired\n\fl8(J The Htjiory and Reality\n\" defired mightily to fee the other, who would\n'^ not come, fearing the catching of them j the\n^* AfHi6ted at lafl; dies of them : (he had not been\n*' buried very long, but ihe appears at the other's\n'^ Houfe in the drefs of a Widow, and asks for her\n'' Friend who was then at Cards, but fends down\n^' her Woman to know her BuGnefs> who in\n*' fhort told her, {he muft impart it to none but\n'^ her Lady, who after {he had received this An-\n*' fwer, bid her Woman have her into a Room, and\n^' defire her to ftay till the G^ime was done, and\n*\n\" {he would wait on her.

Madam^ fays the Ghoft turning up\n\u2022^ her Veil, and her Face appearing full of the\n*' Small- Pox, Tou know 'very well that you and I\n*^ lov'd intirely^ and your not coming to fee me I took\n'^\nfo ill at your Hands^ that I could not reft 'till I had\n'*\nfern you^ and now I am come to tell you^ that you\n*' have not long to live^ therefore prepare to die j and\n*' when you are at a Feaft^ and make the thirteenth in\n** Number^ then remember my IFords-y and fo theAp-\n'' parition vanidiM. To conclude, fhe was at a\n'' Feaft where ihe made the thirteenth Perfon in\n'' Number 5 and was afterwards asked by the de-\n** ceas'd Brother, whether his Sifter did appear to\n*' her, as was reported 5 {he made him no Anfwer,\n*' but fell a weeping, and died in a little time after.\n'^ The Gentleman that told this Story, fays, that\n\" there is hardly any Perfon of Quality but what\n*'\nknows it to be true.\nI DO not enter into an Enquiry here whether the\nStory is true or no, I believe it in Common, for ic\nwas generally believ'd to be true : But 'tis ftrange\nto have this brought for an Evidence of the Pre-\nfcience of the Devil y whereas on the contrary it con-\nfirms what I have {aid, viz. That this cou'd not be\ntheZ)m\/,or what we call the Appearance of the De^\n*vil^\n\fof APPARITIONS. x%7\n'vil<i no, nor could it be the Sonl of the departed\njPerfon j and for the Apparition faying it could not\n'beatrefl:5either it may be put in by fome of the very\nmany Authors relating the Story j or it might be\nfaid by the good Angel or Spirit appearing, to in-\ntroduce her MefTage, and to rouze the Mind of the\nPerfon fpoken to by fomething that fhould touch\nher more to the quick, be the more feeling and\nfenfible to her, and fo make a due Imprcflion upon\nher of the truth of that which was to follow.\nBut firft, for its not; being the Devil, for I\nhave granted that the Devil may make an Appari-\ntion, tho' far from inferring from thence that all\nApparitions are the Devil : But I fay as to its not\nbeing the Devil that appear'd here, in the fhape of\nthe deceased Lady, 'tis Evident,\nFIRSTj Becaufe, as I faid above, and have re-\npeated often, the Devil cannot predi6t, he has no\nPrefcience of things before they are in View 5 he\ncan juggle and play fcurvy Tricks of many kinds,\nas when he prophefied to the Farmer the fall of\nhis ftack of Corn, and then rais'd a fudden Stormi\nand blew it down. It may be he can fee at fomc\nfarther Diftance than we can, and judge ofthe Confe-\nquences of fuch and fuch Caules better than wc\ncan, and with a more perfe6i: and exa6i: Judgment.\nBut to predidt things which are only conceal'd in\nthe Womb of Time, and behind the Curtain of\nProvidence, as this of Life and Death was, it is\nnot in Satan to do it 5 and therefore this could not\nbe from the Devil: the Lady was in Health, was\nChearful, nay Merry, was at a Feaft and at Cards.\nHere was no (ignal of Death, or fo much as of\nSicknefs: I fee no token of the Devil in this Ap-\nparition 5 except it be his extraordinary Civility\nthat he would not interrupt her Game.\nSECOND LT, It could not be the Devilj\nhecaufe of his bidding the Lady prepare for Death 5\nwhichj\n\flU 5f The Hifiory and Reality\nwhich, as I have often obferv'd, does not feem to be\nmuch of Satan's Bufinefs, not being very fuitable\nto his Difpofition, and lefs to his Defign.\nThere is fome little Incongruity in this Story\ntoo, which renders it inconfiftent, not with the De-\nyil only, but even with the Nature of a Spirit or\nApparition: As (i) Why fhould the Apparition come\nwhen the Lady was engaged and could not fpeak\nto her ? as if fhe, being a Ghofl or Spirit as we\nvulgarly exprefs it, did not know what fhe\nwas doing, as well as where fhe was? (i) How does\nher taking ill the living Lady's notvifiting her, ob-\nlige her to come and give her this kind Notice of\nher Death ?i \/ took it fo ill at your Hands^ that I\ncould not reft \"\"till I hadfeen you.\nTho' this does not fhock my Belief of the\nApparition it felf j yet it feems to hint that the\nfeveral Hands thro' which the Relation has pafs'd,\nhave made up the Speech for the Ghoft, and com-\nmitted fome Blunders in it,that are indeed ihocking\nto the Reader.\n1 T feems more rational to be as I have read the\nStory, that the Ghofl (hould fay thus: 'Tho'* I took\nit very ill at your Hands that you woiCd not come to\nfee me-y yet I could not reft 'till I had feenyou^ to\ntell you that you have not long to live^ and that you\njhould prepare^ 6cc. This is much better Senfe, and\nmore agreeable to the Nature of the things for\ncertainly coming in that manner to give the Lady\nNotice of the Approach of her End, and tocoun-\nfel her to prepare accordingly^ mufi: be allow'd to be\nan a\u00a3t of Kindnefs, not of Refentment, and a Te-\nilimony of the AflFe6l:ion that was between them 5 and\ntherefore her taking it ill that fhe had not been to\nVifit her in her lllncfs, could not rationally be\ngiven as a Reafon for it.\nBut as to the Apparition it fclf, fince it could\nnot be the Soul of the deceas'd Lady, and for the\nReafons\n\fof APPARITIO NS. i8p\nReafons above was not likely to be the Devil, or I\nmay venture to fay poGtively was not the Devil\n^\nWhat then was it ? I anfwcr with a Qaeftion :\nWhat could it be but a good Angel, or Angelic\nSpirit from the Invifible World, fent with a Mef-\nfage of Goodnefs, and a merciful Notice of her\nApproaching Death } that fhe might receive a due\ncaution, preparing her Mind and turning her\nThoughts to a proper Meditation upon fo ferious a\nSubjed > in a word, warning her of Death that fhe\nmight prepare for it ?\nThe Story of Sir John Burrougbs's Son, who\nforfaking a Miftrefs in Italy fhe murther'd her felf,\nand then haunted him as long as he liv'd, this is\nof like kind with the reft > and tho' the Devil to\nworry and perplex him might take up the Appea-\nrance of his Whore, as well reproaching him with\nthe Crime, as with her Tragical Endj yet it goes\nno farther than this, that the Devil may appear, and\nmay harrafs and terrify thofe he appear'd to, and\nthis I make no doubt of j and it rather adds to\nwhat is iniifted on, I mean the Reality of Appari-\ntions \u2022, but the Devil gave this Gentleman no good\nadvice to repenc,or prepare, and the like 5 but only\n^appear'd, frighted, and terrify'd him to the very\nDay of his Death.\nI T is alfo remarkable, that tho' this Devil in\nApparition fhev\/ed it felf to him the very Day of\nhis Death, (for he was kilPd that Day in a Duel)\nyet it faid not a word to him of what was to befall\nhim, or of what he was going to do, and 'cis very\nprobable did not know it.\nThere is another Story fomething but darkly\nrecorded of Charles VII. of France, which feems\nlikely enough to be an Apparition of the DeviU\nThat King had been diil;pmper'd and very, ill two or\nthree times, but was recovered again tolerably well,\nand was riding for the Benefic of the Air in the\nForeft\n\flOo The Hijiory and ReaTttj\nForefl: of Mms : On a fudden a Spectre ftarts up or\nout of the Woods, being a\u00bb tall meagre ill-look'd\nold Man, of ghaftly Countenance and half naked,\nand coming directly to the King takes hold of his\nHorfe's Bridle, and fays, Stop^ King: Whether go you ?\nyou are betray'd : and then immediateiy vanifhed.\nNow firft of all, this was a falfhood in Fa6t, for\nthe King was not betray'd by any body 5 neither\nwas there any Plot againft him, or againft any that\nbelong'd to him, ever heard of before, or after-\nwards J on the contrary. Secondly^ his Reign was\nat that time peaceable and quiet, his Subjects all\neafy s and for his Perfon, he hadfo few Enemies that\nhe was calPd Charles the Beloved^ and was exceed-\ningly tendred by the generality of his People.\nA GOOD Spirit, an Angelic Spirit, one of the\nSacred Guard I have fuppos'd to be placed about\nthis Earth, or in the Regions adjacent, and em-\nployed by their Bountiful Maker for the good of\nMankind, would never have come in fuch a man-\nner, furprifing, and at unawares. It would never\nhave put on a fierce and frightful Countenance,\nthus to have terrified a poor dillemper'd Prince,\nwhofe Brain was already diforder'd 5 taking the ad-\nvantage of his Weaknefs, and fo to encreafe the\nFrenzy and Diftra6tion of his Mind even to his\nDeftruftion, for he never more perfeftly recovered\nhis Senfes.\nThis mightily diiFer'd from the Condu6t of the\nfeveral Spirits appearing in the Examples mentioned\nbefore, and who kindly warn'd thePerfons of Dan-\nger, foretold Events that they might avoid them,\nor prepare for the Confequences j in a word, this\nwas an Apparition purely Devilip^^or it wasmeerly\nto do Evil, and to the ruin of the Perfon to whom\nit appear'd.\n1 THINK nothing can be a jufter Rule for us to\ndiilinguifh Apparitions by : the Evil Spirit, Devil\nlike,\n\fof APPARITIONS. ipi\nlike, comes to deceive, he is the Father of Lyes;\nand comes to do hurt, he is a Lover and the Au-\nthor of Mifchief. The good Spirit is from God, the\nFountain of all Good, and appears always for good\nand merciful Purpofesj and this I think is ajuft\nObfervation, and a Rule for us to judge of the Na-\nture of whatever Apparitions we hear of.\nCHAP. X.\nOf the different Nature of Apparitions ;\nhow we jhould behave to them ; when to\nbe afraid of or concerned about them^ and\nwhen not,\nDANGER maybe the Reafon of Caution;\nbut Guilt only is the reafon of Fear. Caution\nis the Mind's juft Regard to the Evil in view; but\nFear is a Horror of the Soul, in apprehcnfion of\nfome farther Evil yet out of view j unfeen, and\ntherefore terrible j merited, and therefore dreadful.\nIf there were no Guilt in the Mind, Death it\nfelf would be no Evil, and therefore not the Sub-\nje6t of our Fear; nor is Death it felf our Fear now\nas it is in it felf a meer paffing out of life, otherwife\nthan as it is an inlet of fome terrible State beyond ir.\nIt is not what we pafs out of, that is the bitternefs,\nbut what we pafs into ; not what we part with, but\nwhat the Exchange will be 3 not the leap out of\nLight, but the leap into the Dark ; and to come\nnearer to it, the Thought of what is beyond Death\nis only made better or worfe by what we know\non this fide of it 5 the Dread of what is to come, is\nfounded on our confcious fenfe of what is pad.\nThis State beyond Death is made our Terror,\nas we expedc in ic the Punifliment of OfFcnces, a\nRetri-\n\fipi The Hijlory and Reality\nRetrbitution for an ill-fpent Life, and as we have\nupon our Minds a Senfe of Guilt ; that is to fay, a\nConfcience of having ill-fpent our paft time, and\ndreading the Juftice of the Superior Hand, in whom\nis the Power of Rewards and Punifhmems. Now\nto bring it to the cafe in Hand.\nAll Apparition is look'd upon as a fomething\ncoming, or fent tous,from that State of 5^\/;^!^which\nis beyond Death, and therefore is look'd upon with\nthe fame Terror and Fright, which we are feiz'd\nwith at the Thoughts oF Death it felf\nHence, if we could confider calmly the Nature\nof the Apparition which we fee, we might pre-\nfently know whether we had reafon to be terrified\nat the Apparitionjj^e-^ or no: If the Apparition comes\nwith a Meflage of Peace, if it reprehends with\nKindnefs and Tendernefs, if it admoniihes with Gen-\ntlenefs, and gives Advice to amend and reform, it\ncertainly comes from a good Hand, and we need be\nunder no concern at all about it, becaufe it has no\nEvil in it felf\nI F it come in all its threatning Poflures, ghaflly\nas the Devil can make it, horrible as himfelf in Per-\nibnj yet were there no Guilt there would be no\nfear from the Apparition, or even from the Devil ap-\npearing in Perfon j becaufe we fliould know our\nfelves to be out of his Power.\nAs then the Good or Evil of the Meflage,\nwhich the Apparition brings, diftingui{hes the Ap-\nparition it felf, and tells us of what kind it isj fo\nas our Minds are, or are not intimidated by our own\nGuilt, fo we have or have not reafon to be fur-\npriz'd at the Appearance of a Me{renger,or Meflen-\ngers, from the invifible World, or at whatever he\nlb all fay.\nHie mtirus aheneus eflo^\nNil confcireftbi nulla palefcere culpa.\nMr.\n\fof APPARITIONS. 1^3\nMr. Auhery gives us the Story in his Mifcellanea of\nthe Apparition to Capio Burroughs^ Efqj in the time\nof King Charles I, and which 1 hinted at jufl now\non another occafionj the Story is as follows ;\n\" Sir John Burroughs being fent Envoy to\n'^ the Emperor by King Charles I. did take his\n'' Eldeft Son Cajhio Burroughs along with himj\n^' and taking his Journey through Italy left his faid\n'^ Son at Florence^ to learn the Language > where\n*' he having an Intrigue with a beautiful Courti-\n\" fan, Miftrefs to the Grand Duke, their Fami-\n*' liarity became fo publick, that it came to the\n'' Duke's Ear, who took a Refolution to have him\n*' murder'dj but Cajhio having had timely notice\n\" of the Duke's Defign, by feme of the Englijh\n'' there, immediately left theCity without acquaint-\n*' ing his Miftrefs of it, and came to England.\n\" Whereupon the Duke being difappoinced of his\n''\nRevenge fell upon his Miltrefs in moil reproach-\n^' ful Language : She, on the other, fide refencing\n*' the fudden departure of her Gallant, of whom\n*' {he was mod paflionately enamour'd, killed her\n'' felf.

That\n\fof APPARITIONS. ipp\n1. That where the Devil appears, he always\ndoes it like a Devilj for feme wicked Purpofe or\nother.\n2. Where he cannot prevail and excite to do\nMifchief, he aflaults with Rage, and threatens\nwith fuffering Mifchief.\nThe good Spirits or good Angels are quite of\nanother Kind > and as they come, or are fent from\nother Hands, fo they come of other Errands and\nin another manner, as I fhall give a more parti-\ncular Account of prefently.\nBut let us from hence enquire into an Opinio\non which I have met with, and that of fome Men\nof Learning and Judgment, viz. That take the\nApparitions in general, whether of good or bad\nSpirits, they never, or very rarely, do any harm.\nAs for the good Spirits, we know, as above, they\nwill do none J and if the bad do not, 'tis be-\ncaufe they can't.\nThe good Spirits, 'tis certain, will do no\nharm j it is by their general appearing for good,\nthat we determine them to be good Spirits 5 and that\nkind of Judgment is certainly very juft: but if\nthe evil Spirits, which do appear, do no harm\nneither, it is becaufe they are under fomc extraor-\ndinary reftraint of Divine Power 5 fo that tho' they\nmay come about in the Air, they are not fufFer'd\nto do any confiderable Mifchief in the World. In\nboth which cafes all the Occafion of our Terror\nabout them is taken away 5 for whether they are\ngood Spirits, or evil Spirits reftrain'd, 'tis much\nthe fame 5 one will do you no hurt, and the other\ncannot 5 and there remains no room then for the\nPannick, which is fo much upon us, when we\nhear of them.\nIt is true that Angels have fometimes been\nfent in Judgment from Heaven, and have execu-\nted God's terrible Threatnings upon Men in an\nO ^ apparent\n\fzoo The Hijiory and Reality\napparent Shape J as the Angel call'd the Deflroy\u00bb\ning Angel, which Damd faw in the Air, with his\nSword drawn and flretch'd over Jerufakm to de-\niiroyit, i Chron. xxi. if. So the Angel of the Lord\nthat flew 180000 of the -.^m\u00ab^ in one Night 5\nand it is not improbable that an Hoft of Angels\nor Apparitions appear'd in the AJfyrian Camp, and\ncut in Pieces xhc AJjyrian Army, with a Terror that\nthey were not able to refift.\nThese are extraordinary and miraculous Cafes j\nfo likewife is that when the Angel appeared to\nBalaam with a flaming Sword, and told him that\nif the Ais had not turn'd away from him, he (the\nAngel) had flain him. Numb. xxii. 33. But we\nare not now fpeaking of Angels fent out with\ncTpecial Com-miflions to execute God's Vengeance,\nbut of the Apparition of good Spirits or Angels\nfrom the invifible World of Spirits, who frequent-\nly appear, and fometimes upon fmall and very tri-\nfling Occafions, and who vifit People as well by\nNight as by Dayj this we call Walking, and Ap-\nparition, and this is fuch as is the Subjeft of our\nprefent Enquiry.\nOf thefe it is that I fay, however they may\ndifturb us, and however terrified wc are about\nthem, they very rarely do any harm.\nI HAVE heard of an Apparition which came to\na Farmer in Surry^ and threatned him that he\nwould burn his Houfe and his Barn, and all his\nCorn and Hayj what his Pretences were the Story\ndoes not relate, or what the poor Farmer had done\nto difoblige him> but the Man was, it feems,\nin the utmoil Confternation, and expoftulated\nwith the Apparition a great while 5 but at laft he\npluck'd up his Spirits, and fpoke with a little more\nCourage to it.\nWhat art thou, fays he, that threatneft mc\nthus without a c^ufe,, and fayefl thou wilt ruin me,\nnotwith^\n\fef APPARITIONS. loi\nnotwithftanding I never did thee any wrong? thou\nihouldft be the Devil^hy thy ufage of me, for good\nSpirits never do any Injuflice.\nTo' this the Devil anfwcr'd in a long, and to\nappearance, a threatning Speech, but in a Language\nthe poor Man did not underftand one Word of.\nI K NO w not what thou fayeft, fays the Farmer^\nbut I tell thee again thou feem'ft to me to be the\nDevil^ or one of his Angels, and I fuppofe thole\nare Words underilood in the bottomlefs Pitj but\nthreaten me no more with thy Rage, and with\nburning my Houfe and Cornj thou art a greatDra-\ngon indeed, but thou artchain'd, and canft do no-\nthing but what thou art permitted to do by thy\nMaker, and I fear thee not. Upon which the poor\nMan pray'd Mentally that he might be deliver'd\nfrom the Power of the Devilj and away run the\nSpe6tre, and did him no harm.\nThis was certainly a commendable Courage^\nand had fomething of the Chriftian in it too j and\nfuch a Courage, and upon the like Foundation,\nwould, for ought I know, lay all the Devils that\never walk'd, and drive away all the Apparitions\nand Spirits that People are fo terribly haunted with,\nand fo terrify'd about.\nC HAP. XI.\nOf Apparitions i^i TJ>ream^ and how far they\nare or are not real Apparitions.\nTHERE may be Dreams without Apparition,\nas there may be Apparitions without Dreams j\nbut Apparition in Dream may be as really an\nApparition as if the Perfon who faw it was awake:\nThe difference may be here, that the Apparition\nin\n\fto h The Hiftory and Reality\nin a Dream is vifible to the Soul only, for the\nSoul never fleeps \u2022, and an Apparition to the Eye-\nfight is vifible in common Perfpcdive.\nHow is it then that we fee in our Dreams the\nvery Faces and Drefs of the Perfon we dream of;\nnay, hear their Voices, and receive due Impreffions\nfrom what they fay, and oftentimes fpeak to them\nwith our own Voices articulately and audibly, tho'\nwe are fail afleep ? What fecret Power of the Imagi-\nnation is able to reprefent the Image of any Per-\nfon to itfclf, if there was not fome Appearance,\nfomeihing placM in the Soul's view, by a fecret,\nbut invifible Hand, and in an imperceptible man-\nner? which Something is in all Refpe6ts, and to all\nPurpofes, as compleatly an Apparition, as if it was\nplac'd in open fight when the Perfon was awake.\nThe Scripture confirms this Opinion by many\nExpreflions direftly to the purpofe, and particu-.\nlarly this of Appearing, or Apparition in Dream.\nGen. XX. 5. God came to Abimelech in a Dream -y\nhad it been faid that AhimeUch dreamed that God\ncame to him, there might have been fome excep-\ntion to the Parallel 5 but God actually came to him:\nand what tho' Ahimelech was afleep, and in a Dream,\nit was not the lefs an Apparition, for God came\nto him^ and fpoke, and faid to him: and in the 4th\nVerfe Ahmelcch (poke to the Apparition. What-\never the Shape was, that the Text does not men-\ntion 3 but Ahimelech knew who he talk'd with too, ^\nthat's evident, for the Text mentions it fully,\nAnd he faid^ Lord, wilt thou flay alfo a righteous.\nNation? and fo he goes on, Verfe the fifth, to\nexpoflulate and plead for himfelf and his People,\nfaid he not unto me^ flje is my Sifter? fo that he\nknew he was fpeaking to the Lord. The Text is ,\nvery remarkable, it is plain that there was an Ap- \\\nparition, but the Man was afleep and in a Dream. ,\n1\nA GAIM ^\n\fof APPAR ITIONS. 2QJ\nAgain in the cafe of Laban purfuing Jacoh^\nGen. xxxi. 24. God came to Laban the Syrian in a\nDream by Nightly and[aid unto him. Here again is an\nApparition, and a fpeaking Apparition too 5 God\ncame to him, and God fpoke to himj and Laban-\nowns, not that he dream'd of God's appearing,\nbut that God really fpoke to him, v, ip. fhe God\nof your Father \/pake to me Tefter-night^ Ikying,\nCertainly Dreams in thofe Days were ano-\nther kind of thing than they are now. God fpoke\nto them, and they anfwer'd 5 and when they were\nawake they knew that it was God that fpoke, and\ngave heed to the Vifion or Apparition of God to\nthem.\nThere are many more Inftances of the like in\nthe facred Hiftoryj as firfl: in the remarkable cafe\nof King Solomon^ i Kings iii. f. \"The Lord appeared\nto Solomon in a Dream by Nighty and God faid^\nask \"what IJhall give thee.\nThis is call'd in the Scripture a Dream, v^. if.\nand S-olomon awoke^ and behold it was a Dream > and\nyet it is all confirmed 5 and the Petition that So-\nlomon made, tho' in his Sleep, or Dream, is ac-\ncepted and anfwer'd as his real A6t and Deed, as\nif he had been awake. A good hint, by the way^\nthat we may both pleafe and offend in our Dreams,\nas really as if we were awake 5 but that is a hint,\nI fay, by itfelf.\nThat PafTage of Solomon is very remarkable to\nthe cafe in hand. If my Readers pleafe to believe\nthat there was fuch a Man as Solomon^ and that he\nhad fuch a Dream 5 they muft allow alfo that it\nI\nwas a real Apparition, God appeared to him in a\nDream.\nTo bring it down a flep lower: as God has thus\nPerfonally appeared to Men in Dreams, fo have\ninferior Spirits, and we have Examples of this too\nin the Scripture.

If I find ic\nneedful to quote what others have publifh'd, you\nfhall have it juftly mark'd as a Quotation, that you\nmay fearch for the Truth in its Original.\nBut before I come to Quotation, or to Col-\nleftion of Story, 'tis needful to obferve here alfo,\nthat as it has pleas'd God to appear in this Man-\nner, and to caufe Angels to appear alfo in the fame\nManner, and upon fpecial Occafions, fo I make no\nQueflion but the Devil often appears in Dreams\ntoo 5 and I might give but too many Examples of\nit, as particularly one in the Scripture.\nIt is apparent that God gave Satan a kind of\ngeneral Licenfe to affli6t Joh^ only not to kill him j\nwith fuch a terrible Commiffion it might be ex-\npelled\n\fof APPARITIONS. 2oy\npe6ted the De'vil would fall upon him with the ut-\nmofl Fury he was capable of, or at leaft that he was\nallowed to takes he ruin'd his Fortunes, reduced\nhim to Mifery, murther'd his Children, tormented\nhim with Boils and Sores j in fhort, left him no-\nthing but Potlherds, and an ill Wife to relieve him 5\nand as he had worry'd him, to ufe a modern Phrafe,\nwithin an Inch of his Life^ he followed him in the\nNight with Apparition, left he fhould recruit Na-\nture with Reft, and be a little refrefh'd with Sleep.\nJob himfelf complains of it, Job vii. 14. \"Thoufcareji\nme with Dreams, andterrifieft me with- V i s i o n s.\nNot that God appeared to Job in any frightful or\nterrible Form j but the Devil^ to whom God was\npleas'd to give a Liberty of afHifting Job, took that\nLiberty, and exerted his Malice to the utmoft in\nfuch a Manner.

Satan, as Toon as he\nperceiv'd that the Death of Chrift, however inten-\nded for Mifchief by the Jews, and purfued violently\nby them in their Rage and Malice at our Lord per-\nfonally, was yet a thing appointed by the determi-\nnate Council of God, for the Salvation of Man*\nkind : I fay, as foon as he perceiv'd that Part,\nwhich 'tis probable he did not know before, heftrove\nall he could to prevent it> and as fierce as h\u20ac had\nbeen to irritate the Jews before, and raife their\nFurv\n\f20\n6\nTbe Hifiory and Reality\nFury and Malice up to a Pitch, even to almoft rab*\nballing the Governor into itj now he under- hand\nftrove to prevent it, and us'd this Stratagem among\nothers by attacking Pilate's Wife in the Night, and\nfetting her to perfuade her Husband, that he was\ngoing to deliver up an innocent Perfon to gratifie the\nJews J and that he fhould have a care what he did.\nMatt, xxvii. ip.

If it be to\nopen the Underftanding, to encreafe Knowledge,\nto feal Inflruftion 3 in a word, if it is for dire6tion\nto good Anions, or llirring up the Soul of Man to\nperform his Duty to God or Man, 'tis certainly\nfrom above 5 'tis an Apparition from God, 'tis a\nVifion of Angels and good Spirits. Job xxxiii. if.\nIn a Dream^ in a Vifion of the Nighty njohen deep Sleep\nj\nfalleth upon Men^ injlumbrings upon the Bed.\nIf it be an Allurement to Vice, laying before\nyou an Opportunity to ileal, prefenting an Obje6fc\nof Beauty, an Inticement to commit an unlawful\nA6tion ; depend upon it 'tis from the dark Regions,\n'tis an Apparition of the Devil^ and he employs his\nAgents, and perhaps attends in Perfon to draw you\ninto Mifchief.\nN. B. Here 'tis worth a wife Man's conGder-\ning, whether the Devil reprefenting a Temp-\ntation to any Perfon in a Dream, and the Per-\nfon complying, he is not guilty of the FaiSl\nas really as if he had been awake. I leave ic\nonly as a Head of Refledion : For Example,\nThe Devilj fubtle in his Contrivance, as well as\nvigilant in Application of Circumftances, knows a\nMan to be in perplex'd Circumitances, diilrefs'd for\n7 want\n\fio8f The Hifiory and Reality\nwant of Money, a perifliing Family, a craving Nc*\nceflity } he comes in his Sleep and prefents him\nwith a little Child drefs'd up with Jewels of a great\nValue, and a Purfe of Gold in its Hand, and all\nthis as happening in a Place perfedly opportune for\nthe Purpofe, the Nurfe having negligently left the\nChild out of her Sight.\nA s he prefents the Temptation, he ftands at the\nPerfon's Elbow 5 prompts him j fays. Take away that\nChain or String of Pearl, and the Purfe, the Child\nis alone, it can tell no Tales, take it quickly > are\nnot you in Diftrefs, and do you not want it at this\ntime to an Extremity, and can any one ever difco-\nvcr it? the Child's Friends are rich, it will do them\nno hurtj if they valu'd fuch things, they would\nnever have put them about a little Child, it\nis no great Matter to them j bcfides 'tis due to their\nVanity and Oflentation, which was the only rea-\nfon of dreffing up a little Child in fuch a Manner.\nCome, come, take it up quickly, it may fave you\nfrom Ruin, and as foon as you are able, you may\nmake them Satisfaftion again, and fo difcharge your\nConfcience. The Man, unable to refift the Snare,\nconfencs, ftrips the innocent Child of its Ornaments,\nand goes away unfeenj but in a Moment or two\nwakes with theSurprife, fees it is a Cheat, and looks\nback on it with a double Regret, i. That he is\ndifappointed of the Prize which he wanted, and\nfancy'd himfelf reliev'd by. 2. That the Devil\nTriumphs over him, and he is both deluded into\nthe Crime, and deceived in the Expe6tation of its\nReward.\nI COULD give this in the Form of a Relation\nof Fad, and give Evidence of the Truth of it> for\nI had the Account of it from the Perfon's own\nLips, who was attacked in Sleep, and (as he faid\nwith a fincere Afflidion) yielded to the Temptation >\nand I committed the barbarous Robbery, faid he^\n-\nwitt\n\fof A??

I fay after, for at firft it feems it was not.\nUnder the melancholy Reflexions of thefe contrary\nCircumiiances, which frequently loaded his Mind,\nHe dreams one Night, that his former Miftrefs came\nto him with a fmiling Countenance 5 I might have ex-\nprefs'd it rather, that his former Millrefs appeared to\nhim in a Dream^ and with a fmiling chearful Coun-\ntenance, told him, that his Run-away Wife was\nDead, and now you -are mine, fays the Apparition.\nHe receiv'd the News with a particular Satisfa6tion,\nand emhrac'd the Lady, as his former Inclioations\ndi61:ated to him y he had not the leafl Notion, as he\nproteiled folemnly, or the leaft Remembrance that\nihe was dead.\nWhen he awak'd, and found it all a Dream,\nhe was exceedingly afflicted with the Surprifej\nlooking upon himfelf to be as really Guilty, as if he\nhad been awake, and the Lady alive 5 and I can-\nnot but fay he had fome Reafon.\nWhether this, if really True, could be any\nthing but an Apparition of an evil Spirit j the De-\nn)il laying a Snare for him, and prevailing with him\nin Dream in a manner, and to commit a Crime, which\nhe could not prevail with him to be guilty of when\nfile was alive.\nI COULD give an Account of another Perfon,\nwhom the Devil haunted frequently, and that for\nmany Years together, with lewd Apparitions j temp-\nting him in his Sleep with the Company of beau-\ntiful Women, fometimes naked, fometimes even in\nBed with him 5 and at other times in Converfation\nprompting him to Wickednefs, and that fometimes\nhe was prevail'd upon to confent 5 but always hap-\nEily\nprevented by waking in time: But the Cafe\nas on two or three Occafions been mentioned by\nother Hands, and the Perfon is too much known\nto allow the farther Defcription of it, without his\nConfent. I\n\fof APPARITIONS. zn:\nI CANNOT doubt but thefc things are ftated\nformal Apparitions of the Devil-, and tho' the Per-\nfo nmay be afleep, and not thoroughly fenfible either\nof what he is doing, or of what is doing with him,\nyet that the evil Spirit isa\u00ab5tualiy prefent with him in\nApparition, I think will not admit of any QuC'-\nflion.\nThe World is too full of Examples of this\nkind, to enter into a long Account of the Parti-\nculars. There is hardly a Book upon the Subjeft\nbut is filled up with hiftorical Relations 5 hardly a\nPerfon to be convers'd with upon the Subje6t, but\nis full of them, either for themfelves or feme of\ntheir Acquaintance 5 and every one is rendering\ntheir Dreams to be confiderable, and all to come\nto pafs: But out of five hundred Dreams fo told,\nand which fo much Strefs is fcemingly laid on,\n'tis hard to find one that we can call a real Ap-\nparition in Dream.\nThe great, and perhaps one of the great-\neft Difficulties of Life, I mean that relates to\nDreams, is to diftinguifh between fuch as are real\nApparitions, and fuch as are only the Produ\u00a3t of\nan incumber'd Brain, a diftemper'd Head, or which\nis worfe, a diftemper'd Mind : But fome Dreams\nare fo fignificant, and there follows fuch an imme-\ndiate vifible EfFe6t anfwering the defign'd Illumi-\nnation, that it cannot but be fignificant.\nA CERTAIN Gentleman who had lately buried\nhis Wife, a Lady of great Piety and Virtue, was\nfo exceedingly affii6ted at his Lofs, that among o-\nther melancholy things which were the Effe6t of\nit, this was one 5 that he was fo far from defiring\nto marry again, that he entertained a fettled ri-\nveted Avcrfion to the whole Sex, and was never\nthoroughly eafie in their Company j and thus |ie\nliv'd near two Years,\nPz Aft:er\n\fz 1\n2\nTToe Hljlory and Reality\nA FTER a certain time his Wife appeared to him\nin his Dream, or he dream'd that he faw his Wifej\nbut I rather put it in the firlt Senfe : She came\nto him, as he thought, to the Bedfide, with a fmi-\nling and pleafant Countenance, and calling him by\nthe Term which fhe always gave him, My Dearefi.\nH E was in a great Confternation, but could noc\nfpeak to jjer J but fhe faid, Do not be afraid of mc,\nI will do you no Hurtj and then faid, What is\nthe Reafon that you mourn thus for me?\nHe flill faid nothing-, that is to fay, he dream'd\nthat be faid nothing, but that he fetch'd a deep\nSigh.\nCome, come, fays Jhe^ Friends loft are Friends\nloft, and cannot be recalled.\nThen he fpoke, that is dream'd that he fpoke^\nand ask'd her, why fhe appeared to him.\nSHEfaid^ to put an End to his unreafonable\nGrief.\nHo w can that be ? fays he.

Whether, fuppofing the Cafe to be littc-\nrally true, was this an Apparition, or was it on-\nly a iimple Dream ? I affirm it muft be an Appari-\ntion, that is to fay, a Spirit came to him in the\nPerfon of, or perfonating his Wife.\nThe following Story I had from the Mouth of\nthe very Perfon who was chiefly concerned in it, I\nmean the Captain of the Ship itfelf.\nOne Captain 7'homas Rogers^ Commander of a\nShip called the Society^ was bound on a Voyage\nfrom London to Virginia about the Year i(5p4.\nThe Ship was hired in London^ and being fenc\nlight, as they call it, to Virginia for a Loading of\nTobacco, had not many Goods in her outward bound,\nfuppofe about two or three a hundred Ton, which\nwas not counted a Loading, or indeed half her\nP g Load-\n\fThe Hijiory and Reality\nLoading } the Ship being very large, above five\nhundred Ton Burthen.\nThey had had a pretty good Paflage, and the\nDay before had had an Obfervation, whereupon\nthe Mates and proper Officers had brought their\nBooks and call up their Reckonings with the Cap-\ntain, to fee how near they were to the Coafts of\nAmerica j they all agreed that they were at leaft about\nan hundred Leagues Diftance from the Capes of Vir^\ngm^.Upon thefe cuftomary Reckonings, and with-\nall heaving the Lead, and finding no Ground at\nan hundred Fathom, they fet the Watch, and the\nCaptain turn'd in (as they call it at Sea) that is,\nwent to Bed.\nThe Weather was good, a moderate Gale of\nWind, and blowing fair for the Coail:, fo that the\nShip might have run about twelve or fifteen Leagues\nin the Night after the Captain was in his Cab-\nbin.\nH E fell afleep, and flept very foundly for about\nthree Hours, when he waked again, and lay 'till\nhe heard his fecond Mare turn ouf,^nd relieve the\nWatch 5 and then he call'd his chief Mate as he\nwas going off from the Watch, and ask'd him\nhow all things far'd j who anfwer'd, that all was\nwell, and the Gale freflien'd, and they run at a\ngreat Rate 5 but 'twas a fair Wind and a fine clear\nNight > fo the Captain went to deep again.\nAbout an Hour after he had been afleep again,\nhe dream'd that a Man pull'd him or wak'd him,\nand he did wake. I am not furc, but I think he\nfaid the Thing that wak'd him bad him get up,\nthat is, turn out and look abroad. But whether it\nwas fo or no, he lay Hill and compos'd himfelf to\nflcep, and drop'd again, and fuddenly awak'd again,\nand thus feveral times j and tho' he knew nothing\nwhat was' the Reafon, yet he found it was impoffi-\nble for him to go to deep, and ftill he heard the\nVifion\n\fof AFP AR IT IONS. ny\nVifion fay, or thought he heard it fay, turn out and\nlook abroad.\nHe lay in this Uneafinefs near two Hours, but\nat lad it encreas'd fo upon him, that he could lie\nno longer, but gets up, puts on his Watch Gown,\nand comes out upon the Quarter-deck 5 there he\nfound his fecond Mate walking about, and theBoat-\nfwainupon the Forecaftle, the Night fine and clear,\na fair Wind, and all well as before.\nThe Mate wondering to fee him, at firft did\nnot know him j but caUing, Who's there ? the Cap-\ntain anfwer'd, and the Mate returns, Who, the\nCaptain ! what's the matter. Sir ?\nSATS the Captain^ I don't know, but I have\nbeen very uneafie thefe two Hours, and fome body\nor my own Fancy bid me turn out and look abroad,\ntho' I know not What can be the meaning of it.\nThere can be nothing in it, but fome Dream,\nfays the Mate,\nSATS the Captain^ How does the Ship Cape?\nSouth-West by South, fays the Mate-, fair\nfor the Coaft, and the Wind Eaft by North.\nT H A t's all very good, fays the Captain > and\nfo, after fome other ufual Queftions, he turn'd about\nto go back to his Cabin 5 when, as if it had been\nfome body that ftood by him had fpoke, it came\ninto his Mind like a Voice, Heave the Lead^ heavi\nthe Lead.\nUpon this he turns again to his fecond Mate,\nMate, fays the Captain^ when did you heave the\nLead? what Water had you?\n-About an Hour ago, fays the Mate^ fixty Fa-\nthom.\nHeave again, fays the Captain.\nThere's no manner of Occafion, Sir, y^ji the\nMate^ but if you pleafe it fhall be done.\nI don't know, fays the Captain^ 'tis needlefs in-\ndeed, I think 5 and fo was going away again,\nP 4 but\n\f2\n1\n6 The Hijiory and Reality\nbut was, as it were, forc'd to turn back as before,\nand fays to the Mate, I know not what ails me,\nbut I can't be eafie 3 come call a Hand aft, and\nheave the Lead.\nAccordingly a Hand was called, and the\nLead being call or heaved, as they call it, they\nhad Ground at eleven Fathom^\nThis furpriz*d them all, but much more when\nat the next Caft it came up feven Fathom.\nUpon this the Captain in a Fright bad them\nput the Helm a Lee, and about Ship, all Hands being\norder'd to back the Sails, as is ufual in fuch Cafes,\nThe proper Orders being obeyed, the Ship\nflay'd preiently and came about j and when fhe was\nabout, before the Sails fill'd, fhe had but four Fa-\nthoms and a half Water under her Stern > as foon as\nfhe filled and flood off, they had feven Fathom again,\nand at the next Caft eleven Fathom, and fo on to\ntwenty Fathom i fo he flood off to Seaward all the\nreflof the Watch, to get into deep Water, 'till Day-\nbreak J when being a clear Morning, there were\nthe Capes of Virginia and all the Coaft of America\nin fair View under their Stern, and but a very\nfew Leagues Diilance : Had they flood on but\none Cable's length farther, as they were going,\nthey had been Bump a-Jhore (fo the Sailors call it)\nand had certainly loll their Ship, if not their\nLives.\nNow, what could this be? Not the Z)m\/, that\nwe may vouch for him, he would hardly be guil-\nty of doing fo n-juch good > hardly an Angel fent\nfrom Heaven Exprefs, that we dare not prefumej\nbut that it was the Work of a waking Providence, by\nfome invilible Agent employ'd for that Occalion,\nwho took Sleep from the Captain's Eyes > as once\nin a Cafe of infinitely more Importance was done\nto King Ahafuerus'^ This we may conclude. Had\nthe Captain llept as ufual, and as Nature requir'd,\nthey\n\fof APPARiriONS. P17\nthey had been all loft 3 the Shore being flat at a\ngreat Diftance, and, as 1 fuppofe, the Tide low, the\n5hip had been a-ground in an Inftant, and the Sea,\nwhich run high, would have broke over her, and\nfoon have dafh'd her in Pieces.\nHow it happen'd that the Mates and other\nNavigators on Board (for it being a very great\nShip, they had feveral experienc'd Men among them)\nihould all of them have kept, and yet all be out in\ntheir Reckoning, and that fo much as to think them*\nfelves an hundred Leagues from the Coaft, when\nthey were not above twenty or twenty five, thac\nwas to be accounted for among themfelvesj but cer-\ntain it was, if it had not been for thus being\nwak'd and jogg'd in the Night, and kept awake\ntoo in fpite of his own Drowfinefs, the Captain\nhad lain ftill, and the whole Ship's Company been\nin the utmoft Hazard.\nI F this was not an Apparition, it muft be what\nthe Scripture calls it in another Cafe, being warned\nof God in a Dream-, which by the way is the fame\nthing 5 but here was fomething more than being\nwarned, for the Captain own'd he was in no Dream.\nHe dream'd nothing at all, much lefs any thing\nof Danger 5 he went to his Bed or Cabbin with\nall the prudent Caution that any Man in that im-\nportant Trufl: of a Ship in the Ocean could do 5\nand then after having made their Calculations, caft up\ntheir Reckonings, fet their Watch, and made every\nthing fure, he hid down with all the Satisfa6lion\nthat it was poffible for any Man in a like Cafe to\nhave.\nTo any Men that underftand the Sea Affairs,\nthis Cafe will be more feelingly and fendbly read j\nthey will be more touch'd with the Surprize\nthe Ship's Company muft be all in, to fee them-\nfelves juft running a-ground, when they believed\nthcrpfclves an hundred Leagues from the Shore, to\n, \u00a3nd\n\f% 1\n8\nThe Hiftory and Reality\nfind themfelves within two Inches of Death, when\nthey believ'd themfelves as fafe as a Ship at Sea\nwith a moderate Gale and a fair Wind could be\nfuppofed to be.\nAnd how will thofe modern Wits, of which our\nAge is fo full, account for this, who allow no God\nor Providence, no invifible World, no Angelkk,\nkind and waking Spirits, who, by a fecret Corre-\nfpondence with our embodied Spirits, give merci-\nful Hints to us of approaching Mifchiefs and im-\npending Dangers, and that timely, fo as to put the\nMeans into our Hands to avoid and efcape them ?\nWhich way will fuch Men folve the main\nDifficulty in fuch a Cafe as this, viz. What this\nfhould be? Will they refolve it all into fortuitous\nChance, meer Accident, ameer Circulation of things\nin the ordinary Courfe? As they fay Shoals are railed\nto bar up a Haven, which they tell us, is nothing but\nthe Sand and Stones driven down the Stream of a Ri-\nver, which lodge here or there, as their own Weight,\nor the abating Force of the Water, or this or that\nEddy and Counter-ltream checks them, fo deep'ning\none Channel where it was Shoal, and choaking up\nanother where it was deep, and all by meer Acci-\ndent: But this is very grofs arguing.\nI T were eafie to confute thefe weak pretences\nto Chance and Incident, and to {how the neceffity\nof an intelligent Being j but that is not my work :\nI am not upon the Reality of fuch an intelHgcnt Be-\ning, but the Reality of its ordinary and extraordina-\nry a6lings, the Agents it employs, and the manner\nof their executing the Commiflions they receive;\nwhich 'tis evident they faithfully perform, and\neffedually too 5 fometimes by one method, fome-\ntimes by another, and particularly by this of Ap-\nparition, as well to the Eyes of the Soul, as to the\nEye of the Body, deeping or waking 'tis the\nfame.\nOur\n\fof APPARITION S. 119\nOur Friends the Criticks may flumble here,\nperhaps5at the feeming contradifbion in the Terms,\nas particularly this of invifible Apparition. Buc\n'tis eafily folv'd, by anfwering that it is but a feem-\ning Contradidion, for both the Apparitions are vi-\nfible, only not to the fame Optick Powers 5 the Ap-\nparition in Dream is vifible to the intelle6lual fight,\nto the Eye of the Soulj and the Day-light Appari-\ntion is vifible to the common ordinary fight : and\nyou have an Expreflion in the Scriptute often made\nufe of, which gives an unqueftion'd Authority for\nthis way of fpeaking.\nThe expreffing things drcam'd of, as things\nfeen, is very frequent in the Sacred Text. Jacob\ndream'd a Dream about Lahan's Cattle, Gen. xxxi.\n10. where 'tis thus expreifed, and I faw in a>\nDream. Again Daniel, vii. i, 2. Daniel had a Dream\nand Vifions of his Head upon his Bed, v. 2.\nand I faw in my Vifion hy Night : v. 7. after this I\nfaw in the Night Vifions^ and behold a fourth Beaft :\nand V. i^. Ifaw in the Night Vifiom^and behold -^ and\nbefides this, we have the fame way of fpeaking ten\nor eleven times in the fame Chapter, and as many\nor more times in the next.\n'T I s the like in relating the Dreams of Pharaoh\nand of Nebuchadnezzar^ or the Apparitions rather\nwhich appear'd to thofe Kings in Dream. Pharaoh\nfays to Jofephj Gen. xli. 17, 18, 19.

So ^\nthat an Apparition in Dream is vifible to the Soul,\nthe Imagination fees, tho' the Eyes of the Body arc\nclos'd.\nThis Dlgreffion is owing to the nice Judgment\nof our Criticks, whofe exa6tnefs you fee I mightily\nreverence, and am wonderful careful not to fall un-\n'\nder\n\f2 20 The Hijiory and Reality\nder their dreadful Hands, in a thing fo eflential to\nmy Subjed 5 as for Trifles, I leave them to trifle with\nthem to the utmofl: oftheir more maliciouslmpotence.\nBut I come now to another Relation of Fa6t,\nwhich alfo I take upon me to vouch the Reality of,\nhaving been prefenc at the very inftanc of every\npart of it.\nA Person, whofe Name it is not fo proper to\nmention here, but who may be produc'd if there\nfliould be occaflon, being ftill living, was under the\ndifafter, about the Year 1701, to fall under a Party\nCenfure, (the occaflon is needlefs to the prefenc\nCafe.) In hopes, upon the Recefs of the Houfc, which\nwas not far ofl^, he fliould (as is ufual)be at Liberty,\nhe withdrew himfelf, and avoided being taken up as\nmuch as he could j but the Houfe refendng it, a\nVote was pafl:, ordering the Secretary of State to\nprofecute him at Law j which oblig'd him to refolve\nto leave the Kingdom, and in the mean time to\nconceal himfelf with more exaftnefs j the Govern-\nment having ifliied out a Proclamation for appre-\nhending him, with a Reward to the Perfon who\nfliould difcover where he was, fo as he might be\ntaken.\nI N order to conceal himfelf more efFe6bually, he\nleft his Lodging where he had been hid for fome\ntime, and removed to Barnet on the Edge of Hert-\nfordjhire 5 intending, as foon as he had fettled fome\nFamily Affairs, to go away North into Scotland :\nBut before he went away he was oblig'd to come\nonce more to London^ to fign fome Writings for\nthe fecuring fome Eftate, which it was fear'd might\nbe feiz'd by Out-law, i^ the Profecution had gone\non fo far.\nThe Night before he had appointed to come to\nLondon^ as above,being in Bed with one Mr. i?\nD\" he dream'd that he was in his Lodgings at\nLondouy where he had been conceard as above, and\nin\n\fof A?F ARiriONS. 2ZI\nin his Dream he faw two Men come to the Door,\nwho faid they vjtxtMeJfengers^ and produc'd a War-\nrant from the Secretary of State to apprehend him,\nand that accordingly they feiz'd upon and took\nhim.\nThe Vifion furpriz'd and wak'd him, and he\nwaked Mr. D his Brother-in-law, who was in\nBed with him, and told him the Dream, and what\na Surprize he was in about it. Mr. D feeing\nit was but a Dream, advis'd him to give no heed to\nit, but compofe himfelf and go to fleep again, and\nhe did fo.\nAs foon as he was faftafleep again, he was wak'd\nagain with the fame Dream exaftly as before j and\nhe awak'd his Brother again, as before : It difturb'd\nthem both very much 5 but being heavy to fleep,\nthey both went to fleep again,and dream'd no more.\nIt is to be obferv'd, that he faw the very Men that\napprehended him, their Countenances, Cloaths,\nWeapons, i^c. and defcrib'd them in the Morning\nto his faid Brother D in all the Particulars.\nHowever the Call to go to London being as\nhe thought urgent, he got ready in the Morping\nto go, refolving to flay but one Day, and then fee\nforward for Scotland. Accordingly he went for Lon-\ndon in the Morning, and that he might not be\nknown, walk'd it on Foot> that fo he might goby\nmore private ways over Enfield Chafe^ and fo to\nSouthgatey Hornfey^ 6cc.\nAll the way as he walk'd his Mind was heavy,\nand opprefs'dj and he frequently faid 10 his Bro-\nther who walk'd with him, that he was certain\nhe was going to London to be farpriz'd : and fo\nflrong was the foreboding Impreffionupon his Mind,\nthat he once ftop'd at Hornfey^ and endeavoured to\nget a Lodging, intending to fend his Brother to\nLondon to fee if nothing had happen'd there to give\nhim any Alarm.\nAs\n\ftt% The Hifiory and\nAs he had juft fccured a convenient Lodging,\nhe accidentally law a Gentleman Handing at the\nnext Door, who he knew very well, bu^ durft not\nventure to truft on that Occaiion j and finding on\nEnquiry that he dwelt there, he concluded that\nwas no Place for him, and fo relblv'd to go for-\nwards.\nThe Impreflion upon his Mind continuing, he\nllop'd again at IJlington^ and endeavour'd to get a\nLodging there > bur could not : fo at lad, when his\nBrother brought him word he could not gtz a\nLodging, except where it was too publick.

In a word,the Reconciliation was made\nin a few Minutes -, for he not only comply'd with\n^ny thing his Wife or her Brother defir'd, but even\nmore than they ask'd > and when they proposed that,\nto prevent Miftakes afterwards, he would confenc\nthey ihould put into Writing what they defir'd,\nand what he had faid to her.

He concluded his Coufin was dead,\nbec^ufe he faid he was out of his reach 5 and he\nconcluded that this was his Ghoft, or his difquieted\niSoul, and he dreaded the threatning of his Returq;\nHe endeavoured to wear it off of his Mind, but ic\nwould not do 5 the Impreffion to be fure would be\nftrengthned by his own Guilt, and both together\nbrought him to himfelf.\nFor this is to be obferv'd in all fuch things, viz.\nThat it is not the Fright or the Surprize that works\non the Mind, but the Convi&ion j [and therefore\ntho' this is one of thofe Relations which I do not\ntake upon me to aflert the faft of from my own\nknowledge, yet fuppofing it to be true, the Moral\nis the fame, and on that Account I relate it, viz.\nThat there may be an Apparition of a Perfon\nliving 5 and yet the Perfon living, and fo feeming\nto appear, not know any thing of it, or be any\nway concerned in it 5 and fo in this Story now told,\nit is imply'd, that the Lady here was living when\nihe appear'd to the Gentleman in Germany^ and that\nthe Gentleman in Germany was living when he ap-\npear'd to his Coufin in London^ whatever manner they\nappear'd in 5 and yet it feems that neither of them\nknew any thing of the matter, and doubtlefs had\nno concern atoall in it.\nI H A V E not been able to dive ib far into this\nStory, as to fay, that they were ever enquired of\nafterward, whether they were acquainted with the\nCircumftances or no 5 but I am indifferent as to that\nPoint,\n\fz^6 \"The Hljlory and Re^iUiy\nPoint, it is out of Queftion with me, that they\nixiight not be any way concern'd in the thing ic\nfelf, and yet that it might be really an Apparition\nof the Perfons, their Faces, Voices, Cloaths, and\nall the needful Apparatus fit for the Deiufion.\nThere are many Inftances of like kind\nwith this, and I have a very particular Relation by\nme of a Perfon who in Apparition told a Friend of\nhis, of the Fire of London^ two Months before ic\nhappen'd, mention'd the manner of the Conflcigra-\ntion, how it would begin in the Heart of the City,\nand would burn Eaft and Well;, and lay the City\nlevel with the Ground 5 to ufe the very words.\nH E happen'd not to tell the Place exaftly where\nit was to have been done 5 if he had, he might have\nbeen afterwards brought into Trouble, by the un-\nadvifed relating the Particulars j for his Friend be-\nlieved he really fawhim > and not that it was an Ap-\nparition : But it feems he made a long Religious\nExcurfion upon the difmal Condition of the Citi-\nzens, and how their Pride would be brought low 5\nhow their Glory would be laid in the Duftj and\nhow it was all to be look'd upon as a Blow upon\nthem for their Luxury, and for their publick Sins 5\nand fo feem'd to preach pretty [much : And you\nknow if Spirits from the other World were to\npreach, fome People have fuch an Averfion to that\ndull heavy Bufincfsjas they call it, that they would\ngive very little heed to it. I fay, the Apparition\nfeem'd to preach pretty much upon the Subje6i:,and\nfo the Friend began to be weary of the Difcourle,\nand put him off to fomething elfe.\nThat which feems Parttcularin this Story, and\nwhich (had I room here) would takeoup fome time\nto Difcourfe upon at large, is, that the Apparition\nwent off in Form, not difcovering it felf fo much\nas to be an Apparition y but came in at the Door,\nwas. let in by a Servant in the ufual manner, after\nknocking\n\fof APPARITIONS. 2J7\nknocking at the Door, and was carry'd into the\nParlor among the Family; that it difcours'd of\nother Matters alfo 5 as of the Dutch War, and the\nbloody Engagement at Sea : I do not remember\nexa6tly, whether it faid a bloody Engagement had\nbeen, or would be ; but 1 think it was Engage-\nment that had lately been.\nThat there were feveral other Tranfitions m\ntheir Difcourfe, from one Article of publick Buli-\nne{s to another; and at la ft to that of the Fire of\nLondon : The Gentleman who it was difcours'd to\nfeem*d not to be much concern'd at the Prediction\nabout the Fire, looking upon it as a piece of guefs-\nwork, and that his Friend fpoke it as of a thing\nwhich he fear'd, rather than as a thing he foretold,\nand pretended to know of : But after the Terrible\nConflagration had happened, and that the City was\nindeed laid low from the Eaft to the Weft, as\nhad been mentioned, then all the Particulars came\ninto his Mind with fome weight, and fome unufual\nreflection ; for the Circumftances were too evident\nto be flightly thought of\nHowever it pafs'd over in the ordinary way,\nwith a little kind of wonder ; and it was ilrange\nthat Mr. M~\u2014ftiould be able to talk fo 5 and fure^\nMr. M\u2014 deals with the Devil^ and the like$\nwhereas all this while Mr. M knew nothing of\nthe Story ; and whatever Hand it was, and for\nwhatever kind purpofes, no notice was taken of it,\nand Mr. M\u2014had fo little knowledge of it himfelf\nthat his own Houie was burnt down in the gene*\nral difafter, and he had hardly time to fave one\nquarter part of his Goods.\nIt might indeed beform'd here as an ObjeClion\nagainft this Notion, of good Spirits from thelnfivi-\nble World,and their concerning themfelves in giving\nNotices of approaching Mifchiefs, viz. That they\ndo not concern themfelves to give fuch Notices in\nS Cafes\n\f2j8 The Hijiory and Reality\nCafes of publick Calamities, when many thoufands\nnot of Perfons only, but even of Families, are con-\ncerned, and in danger j and even where many par-\nticular Perfons, who at other times have had fuch\nwarnings from them, and have been as it were their\nParticular care, have been left to fall in the com-\nmon difafter.\nThis is what I may take notice of again, ia\nits proper place 5 but at prefent I am rather ob-\nferving to you what is, than the Reafon of its being\nfo : The ways and works of Providence are Sove-\nreign and Superiour 5 the Manner conceard,and be-\nyond our Underftandings and Reafon 5 not always\nTifible tousj and yet its Proceedings not the lefs\njuft, or the lefs to be accounted for in themfelves j\ninor is it neceflary that we fhould be always able to\naccount for them to our felves. Heaven has its own\nReafons for all its Aftings, and it is not for us to\ndifputc its Sovereignty, any more than to examine\ninto the Reafon of its working. TheBifhop o^Down^\nthe Pious and Devout Doctor Jeremy Taylor^ in the\nCafe of an Apparition yet to be fpoken of, would\nneeds have the Perfon it appcar'd to ask this Que-\nilionwhen it came again, Why he appear'd,or how\nhe come to appear in fo fmall a matter, as that of\ndoing Juftice to one fingle Child, when fo many\nopprefs'd Widows and Orphans groan'd under the\nweight of greater Injuries, without any of their\nRelations concerning themfelves in the leaft for\ntheir Deliverance ? and the Man did accordingly\nask the Queftion, as we fhall fee in its place j\nbut had no anfwer given him, as indeed I think he\nought not to have cxpe6ted : but of this hereafter.\nI T is certain the approach of that Terrible Fire,\nthe like of which was never known in this part of the\nWorld5Wasnot difcover'd from the Invifible World}\nat leaft but to very few : an evident tokea that de-\nparted Souls knew nothing of it, or, if they did,\nhad\n\fof APPARITIONS. i|^\nhad no Power to come hither, and give notice of\nit 5 if they had, what Numbers of Predidions,\nForebodings and Apparitions would there have been\nin the City for feme Months before\n!\nBut are we not anfwer'd by the Scripture, and\nmight we not reply in the Language ofour Saviour\nfpcaking of the generaV Deluge, Matt, xxiv, i^S, 39.\nFor as in the days that were before the floods they were\neating and drinking^ ?narrying^ and giving in marriage,^\nuntil the day that Noe entred into the Ark^ and knew\nnot until the flood came^ and took them all away-,\nJq\nJhall alfo the coming of the Son of Man he ?\nJust fo likewife was it at the time of the Fire\nof London : 'tis faid indeed, with fome Remark, that\nit was not a Wedding Night to many, if to any one\nCouple in the City j becaufe the Fire beginning oa\nthe Sunday Morning, very few, ifany, are faid to be\nmarry'd of a Saturday } but as it was a mighty Cu-\n(lom in thofe Days to marry on a Sunday^ fo\nthere were a great many Weddings appointed for\nthe next Morning, which were hinder'd without\nany forebodings or foreknowledge 5 and that which\nwas infinitely worfe, many Women in Travel that\nvery Night, were, as it was reported, forc'd to be\ncarry'd out of their Chambers in the very Article\nof Child-Birth, and fome as I have heard were de-\nliver'd in the very Paffage from one Houfe to ano-\nther: Others, not thinking the Fire would follow\nfo fail, having removed but a little way, their\n^extremity being great, were oblig'd to be remov'd\nAgain 5 yet we find no notice of any of thefe\nthings given in the leaft.\nThis indeed is what I fay we cannot account\nfor, neither is there any need for us to account for\nthem in the DifcouiTe we are upon 5 for our Quefti-\npn is not. Why there arc no more Notices given\nthan there are, and why they are not univerfal to\none as well as another > as if it were a Grace Men\nS a, ought\n\f6o The H^Jlory and Reality\nought to have an equal Claim to : But 'tis a Pro-\npofition that fuch Ap.paritions there are, and that\ntherefore there are certain Agents fo appointed to\nappear.\nW E have like Accounts to thefe at the time of\nthe great MafTacre at Paris -y a critical Jundlure, in\nwhich the Rage of Hell feem'd to be carry'd to\na terrible Height, and when innocent Blood lay\nready to be fpilt in a terrible manner 5 the Unguar-\nded Proteltants having no Means to avoid the Mif-\nchiefs that artended them, and no Strength to refill\nthe Power of the Cut-throat Armies which fur-\nrounded them J fo they had no Intimations from\nthe invifible World to aflifl: their Efcape.\nBut what does this amount to, any more than\nthe like Cafes may argue in a thoufand Calami-\nties and Difafters which hav^ befallen Mankind be-\nfore? Nay, it confirms the grand Truth which I\nhave infilled on 5 namely, that Souls departed know\nnot any thing, and can communicate nothing, tho'\nunembody'd Spirit may.\nFor could the departed Souls ofdeceas'd Relati-\nons have known that their Fathers, or Children,\nor Brothers, or Relidls, ^c. were the next Day to\nhave been murther'd, can we doubt but they would\nhave given them all the Notice that it was in\ntheir Power to do, and at leafl have alarm'd them\nfo, as to put them upon their Guard, and give\nthem an Opportunity to die like Hero's, as many\nof them were? and as they did not do thus, I think,\nwithout Injuflice, or Prefumption, we may con-\nclude they cannot 5 they could not then, neither\ncan others do the like now.\nAnd yet as to fuch Notices as the Inhabitants\nof the invifible World were allow'd to make, I\nbelieve they were not without them at that time,\ntho' it was not thought fit by the Appointment\nof Heaven to have the wicked Rcfolution of Mur-\nther\n\fof APPARITIONS. t6i\nthcr and MafTacre defeated: as to the Reafons\nwhy, which is what we have nothing to do to\ndifpute, that we leave in Silence, as we may well\ndo.\nThe Hiftories of thofe Times are full of the\nfecret Warnings and Notices then given by the kind\nApparitions of thofe invifible Agents (whoever they\nare) in Dream. The Admiral CoUgni had no 1 fs\nthan three particular Notices given him by Dreams,\nthat his Life was in danger, and that he would\nbe murther'd if he ftay'd in Paris', an Exprefs was\nfent him from the Count S \u2014-, at Saumur^ to\nmake his Efcape and flee for his Life before it\nwas too late 5 nay, it was even faid that the King\nof Navarr^ who was afterwards Hen.

Upon this the Maid begun to take him fhort\na little, and told him, this was all out of the way\nof what he came about j if the Lodgings were too\ngood for him, that was his Bufinefs indeed, but elfe he\nhad nothing to do with her Lady, and how fhe\npleas'd to furnifh her Houfe : That her Mafter was\na Gentleman of a great Eftate, and had large Plan-\ntations\n\f66 The Hijiory and Reality\ntations in Jamaica^ that he conftantly fupply'd her\nLady with Money, fiifficient for her Support, and\nfor all her Expcnces 5 and ihe wonder'd he fhould\ntrouble himfelf with th^, which ihe was fure was\nnone of his Bufinefs : in fliort, the Girl huffed him,\nand ask'd him what it was to him, who was a\nStranger, how her Lady liv'd.\nHowever he turns to the Maid, and fitting\ndown again, calmly enter'd into fome Difcourfc\nwith her about her Lady, and her wuy of Living,\nand told fo many of the Secrets of the Family to\nher, that flie began to ufe him better, and to per-\nceive that he knew more of the Family than {he\nthought he had, or indeed than fhe did her felfj\nat laft the Wench began to be uneafie, and to que-\nllion in her Thought, whether it was not her Ma-\niler himfelf, come over Incognito^ and only that he\nh.id T'.ot yet difcover'd himfelf.\nShe tried feveral times to learn who he was, his\nQuality, his Country, his Name, and how fhe\nmight fend to him 5 but he put it off, only told her\nhe would go to where her Lady lodg'd, and\n\"wait upon her Lady himfelf> and fo treating the\nServant very civily, and thanking her for fhowing\nhim the Houfe, he went away in Form with his\nServant following him, fo that he did not vanifli as\nan Apparition at all.\nYet the poor Wench was very uneafie, {he be-\ngan to think it could not be an ordinary Creature,\nbecaufe he gavefuch flrange and particular Accounts\nof things done in the Family 5 as where feveral things\nwere depofited that belong'd to the Family, with feve-\nral Circum{i:ances belonging to her Mi{lrefs, to her\nlittle Son, and to his Father in the JVeft- Indies s and,\nin {hort, faid fome things, which, as ihe faid, none\nbut the Devil could tell of: which, by thelway, was\ntalking as ignorant People talk of fu^h things j\nnamely.\n\fof APPARlTlO NS. 167\nnamely, that if any thing be faid, or done, out of\nthe ordinary Way, and more than is common for\nMen to talk, or do, they immediately fay it mull\nbe the Devil,\nI T muft be confefs'd, it fhews a Difference be-\ntween the Prefent and the P^ift Ages : In former\nTimes, if a Man did extraordinary Things, he was\nlook'd upon as infpir'd from Heaven j or if great mi-\nraculous Things were wrought, it was faid imme-\ndiately to be from Heaven.

But now, if any thing\nbe done extraordinary, or faid furprizingly, ic muft\nbe xht Devil 'y as if God had ceas'd to work, and all\nExtraordinaries were committed to the Devil.\nThus the Pertuis Roftan^ which is a wonderful\nPaffage cut through a Mountain near Briangon^ on\nthe Frontiers of DaupFme^ calPd one of the five\nWonders of Dauphine, is faid to be the Work of\nthe Devil y only becaufe the People have no Hiftory\nrecording the Time or Manner of its making, or by\nwho J and becaufe they think it paft the Power of\nMen's Hands : and the like of many Places, and\nThings in England.

Don't tell me, fays Mary^ (that is the\nLondon Maid) I muft fpeak with her, and will fpcak\nwith her, for I have extraordinary Buiinefs with\nher.

Why, Madam, that's impofUble.\nNay, it has been your Mafler to be fure, or\nthe Devil in his Likenefs.\nI N a word, 'tis certain it was her Husband in\nApparition, or an Apparition of her Husband, and\nhe talk'd very warmly and clofely to her, and told\nher his Eftate would not fupport her expcnfive\nway of Living, and that Ihe would bring her felf\nto\n\fef APPARITIO NS. z\/i\nto Mifery and Poverty j and a great deal more to\nthe fame Purpofe, as he had faid to Mary.\nAf^fi^jT immediately ask'd her Ladyfhip, what\nmanner he appear'd in j and by the Defcription that\niier Miftrefs gave, it was exactly the fame Figure\nthat came to her, and defired to fee the Lodgings j\n\u00a3o Mary gave her Lady a particular Relation of\nwhat happen'd to her alfo, and of the Mcffage fhc\nwas charg'd to deliver.\nWhat followed upon this Alarm, and how the\nLady was reduced, and obliged to fell her fine Fur-\nniture and Equipage, and came to very low Cir-\ncumftances, tho' it was a part of the Story, is not\nfo much to my Purpofe in the Relation. But what\nis remarkable to the Cafe in hand is, that they\nalledge, that juft at this Juncture Sir 7\u2014^ O \u2014ne^\nthe Lady's Husband, died in the Wefl-Indies : I fup-\npofe by his Death her Supplies were immediately\nHopped, and that was the Occafion of her being\nreduced fo fuddenly.\nNow the Apparition, and its appearing in the\nShape or Figure of the Husband, his warning her\nof her approaching Circumftances, and moving her\nto abate her expenfive way of Liviog, and the like,\nall this is agreeable to the Opinion I have already\ngiven, that good Spirits may be allowed to afTume\nhumane Shape, and the Shape of any particulair\nPerfon, whether the Perfon be dead or living; and\nmay appear to us, to caution us in our wrong\nMeafures, to warn us againft impending Mifchiefs,\nand to direct us in Difficulties. And how merciful\nis it to Mankind, that there are fuch kind Moni-\ntors at hand, at any time, for our good\n!\nBut that this muft be juft in the Article of\nDeath, juft when the Perfon was dying, and the\nSoul departing; as if the Soul could Itay in its\nPafTagc, between Life, and the eternal State, to\ncall at this, or that Place, and deliver a Meflage ;\nFor\n\f271 T^^ Hijiory and Reality\nFor Example > if ft was to be carry'd by the An-\ngels into jibrabam's Bofom, you mud fuppofe thofe\nAngels would go about with it from Jamaica to\nLondon^ to give it leave to fpeak with his Wife,\nbefore its Tranflation, before thofe fwift Meflcn-\ngers perform'd their Task 5 nay that he mull flop\nat the London Houfe, aflume a Shape for that Pur-\npofe, talk about the moll frivolous things with\nMary the Servant Maid, and then go with another\nformal Errand to\u2014to his Wife, all this in his Journey ;\nand having difpatch'd thefe more weighty Affairs,\nthen go on for Heaven afterwards.\nThis, I fay, has to me no Confiflency in it, no\nCoherence, it does not hang together in my Opi-\nnion at all, nor can I make any common Senfc of\nit J no, not if I was to come to theoldpoetickFiiSbi-,\nons of Charon and his Ferry-Boat5 even the old\nFerry- Man would not have flept out of his Way,\nupon any fuch Bufinefs.\nWhat might be dene by the Agency of thofe\nSpirits, appointed by the Great Lord of all Spirit,\nto attend for the good of his Creatures, I have not\nthe leaft Obje\u00a3lion againfljbut that the Soul of the\nDeceafed, or Departed, can come of this Errand it\nfelf, that I deny, and mufl infifl upon it, that there\nis neither Reafon or Religion in it, 'tis founded\nwholly in the Imagination j and tho' the Imagina-\ntion may not in this Cafe form the Apparition, yet\n'tis evident the Imagination only appropriates it to\nthe Perfon, that is, to the Soul of the Perfon, who\nhas really no Share in the Operation.\nUpon this Foundation likewife flands the old\nHeathen Notion, taken from the Cafe of JchiUes\nand his Friend Patroclus^ that the Soul of the De-\nceafed cannot be at Rell, 'till he has come and given\nNotice of fuch and fuch things; that Juflice be\ndone to fuch and fuch mjur'd Perfons; and Money,\nfoandfoappropriated* be regularly difpofed, and the\nWill\n\fof APP ARITION S, 173\nWill of the Deceafed punftually performed : Thefe\n1 take not to be imaginary but fictitious, and made\nor fupplyed out of the Invention of the Relator^ in\norder to difh up the Story.\nAnd this makes the Story of the Duke of\nBuckinghani's Father, of which mention has been\nmade already, be liable to fo many Exceptions :\nThat his Father could not reft, or his Soul could\nnot be at reft, becaufe of the wicked Life his Soa\nGeorge liv'd at Court j That part muft certainly be\nadded by fome of the very very many Relators, or\nwho have calPd themfelves Relators of that Story j\nand my Lord Clarendon^ who {cems to have been the\nmoft exadt and judicious in the putting the whole\nStory together, has none of that Paffage in his Ac*\ncount of it, as we fhall fee prefently.\nUpon what Religious Foundation can we fug*\ngeft, that the Sins of the Children fhould difquiet\nthe Fathers in their Graves, or that the Souls de-\nparted can receive any Impreffion from the Beha-\nviour of thofe in Life, fubfequent to any Aftion\nthofe Souls departed have been concerned in ?\nThat they may be affeded in a Future State\nwith the Wickednefs and Offences committed in\ntheir paft Life, that I will not doubt j tho' even\nnot that in fuch a manner, as to fend them back\nhither upon any Errand about it 5 for all is irre*\ntrievable j as there is no Repentance, fo no Repa-\nration, there is neither IVork nor Invention in th^\nGrave^ whither we are all going. The Soul may\nbe in a State of Self- Reflection and Reproach 5 but\nnot in a State of Readion, no recovering for our\nfelves, nor concern for others j *tis all out of^ the\nQueftion, and all the Notices from the other fide\nof the Curtain come from other Hands, whofe\nName foever they may fpea,k in^ 6x whofe Shape\nfoe^er they may aftume.\n\fi74 The Hifiory and Reality\nI A M forc'd, how relu&ant foever, to talk Scrip-\nture to my Readers^ upon this nice part of the\nSubject J whether they will lay any wejght upon\nit or no, be that to themfelves.\nI INSIST upon it, that the Souls of the dead\ncan make no Vifits hither when once they are re-\nmoved 5 that when they are unembodied, difrob'd\nof Fleih and Blood, they have no more concern\nwith or about us j fo as either to difturb their Reft\nor ours 5 and this is plain to me, not only from the\nNature of the thing, from Reafon and Obfervati-\non> but from the Scripture. Eccl. ix. f. For the\nliving know that they jhall die : hut the dead know not\nany things neither have they any more a Reward^ for\nthe memory of them is fotgotten. This latter part re-\nlates to their having any Reward or Concern in\nthings here of this Life, no more Reward or Be-\nnefit or Share of things here : But look into the\nnext words, ver. (5. jllfo their love^ and their hatred^\nand their envy is now perijhedy neither have they any\nmore^a portion for ever in any thing that is done under\nthe Sun,\nWhat can be plainer than this, if Scripture\nbe of any moment among us? if not, I can fay\nnothing to that. But I fay, what can be plainer,\nand what do thofe People mean who tell us a Ghoft\nor Spirit appeared, and faid it could not be at Reft\n*till it had come to do fo and fo, 'till it had difco-\nver'd fuch and fuch things, and 'till it had feen ic\nwell perform'd ?\nI F my Vote in this Cafe may be of any Value,\nor I may offer any thing by way of Diredion to\nweaker Heads j let them make this one thing a\nChara6ber or Mark to know fuch things by, or to\njudge of them, viz. That when they meet with\nany Story told in fuch a manner, they ihould con-\nclude it a fid:ion, a cheat j that it is only a Scory\nmade by the Invention of Story- Makers, a Dclu-\nfion.\n\fof APPARITIONS. 17S\nfion, and that no Spirit or Apparition really com-\nihg upon any MefTage from the Invifible World,\never talks after that manner > or that if they do 'tis\na Cheat of the Devil to carry on fome Delufion,\nand to make fome Lye appear plaufible; for that\nthere can be no reality in it5that's aflerced as above,\nTbe dead know not any things not any thing HEREy\nbut rheir Love^ and their Hatred^ and their Env^ is\nperijhed,\nW E have another Story to offer in this cafe,\nwhich has been mention'd, as if it were the A\u00a3b\nand Deed of the Perfon departed 5 and in whofe\nName it was faid to be done, and who, as we may\nfay, was perfonated in it. I ihall relate the Story\nimpartially as I receiv'd it, and let all the Advan-\ntage that can be taken of it be made, I believe it\nwill not amount to any rational Conclufion, in Fa-\nvour of ithis Notion, that the Soul of the Perfon\ndeceafed is any way concern'd in it, or in any part\nof it.\nThis is the famous Story of the Apparition of\none James Haddock in Ireland^ which is publifli'd\nmany feveral ways, and that by feveral Anchors 5\nand fome of them intimating that it was really the\ndeparted Soul of James Haddock^ who could not be\nat Refl, as fome of the Writers of the Story would\ninfinuate, becaufe his little Son by his Wife E-\nleanor Welch was wrong'd in a Leafe left by him to\nth^ Child y but kept from him by her fecond Hus-\nband .\nThe abridged Story is this. In the Year i(5(52,\nan Apparition meets one Francis Taverner on the\nHighway \u2022, the Man having Courage to fpeak to it,\nasks it what he is ? and the Apparition tells him\nhe is James Haddock^ and gives him feveral Tokens\nto remember him by, which taverner alfo calling\nto mind owns them > and then boldly demands of\nthe Apparition what budnefs he had with him 5\nT ^ the\n\fzy6 T^^ Hljlory and Redltty\nthe Apparition did not tell his Bufinefs that Night;\nbut would have had I'a'verner xodiO. back his way with\nhim, and he would tell him his Bufinefs, which\n\"Taverner refus'd, as well he might ; and that part\nindeed feems the only improbable part of the\nStory.\nHowever the next Night the Apparition\ncomes to him again, and then tells him the Bufi-\nnefs, which was to defire him to go to his Wife,\nwhofe Maiden Name was Eleanor fVelJh'y but was\nthen marry'd again to one Davis^ which Davis\nwith-held the Lcafc from the Orphan, Haddock's Son,\nand tell her fhe fhould caufe Juflice to be done to\nthe Child.\nT'AFERNER neglefted to perform this Er-\nrand, and was fo continually foliow'd by the Ap-\nparition, that it was exceeding terrible to him ;\nand at lad it threaten'd to tear him in Peices, if he\ndid not go of his Errand.\nUpon this he goes and delivers the Mefiage to\nthe Woman, who if feems took but fmall Notice\nof it J and then the Apparition came again, and\ntold him he muft go to his Executor, and do the\nfame Errand 3 which he was it feems afraid to do,\nfor fear of Davis -, but the Apparition threaten'd\nDavis if he fhould attempt to do him (Xavemer)\nany Injury.\nN. B. Here I am to Note^ that this Story made\nfo much Noife in the Country^ and the Parti-\nculars appear''d to he fo faithfully related hy Ta-\nverner, that abundance of Perfons of Note\n\\ '\ncame to him to have the Relation from his own\nMouth J and among the reft the Lord Bijhop of\nDown and Qonnov^ who I name in Reverence^\nnot to his Dignity only^or fo much^ as in Reve-\nrence of his known Piety and Serioufnefs in Reli-\ngion: Being the farrCd Do6ior Jeremy Taylor,\nAuthor of a known Book calVd Rules of Holy\nLiving and Dying.

That there are really Appa-\nritions, and thefe Apparitions do perfonate fuch and\nfuch Bodies or Shapes, whofe Names they take\nupon them, and whofe Perfons they reprefent.\nBut for the reft, I think all the Notions that\nthe People then entertain'd of it, and even the Bi-\nfhop among the reft, muft be very erroneous and\nmiftaken.

The Biftiop entertain'd the Story, as if this\nApparition was really the Soul of the departed\nJames Haddock\\pi% appeared by a fecond Examination\nof faverner by his Lordfliip ; for the Lady CeU'-\nway^ and other Perfons of Quality, hearing the\nBiftiop had fent for T'averner to examine him, went\nall away to be prefent at the Examination : And the\nBiftiop being gone to a Town call'd Hillsbro* three\nMiles off^, the Company went all thither, and fa^\nverner was fent for to them, and there examin'd\nof all the Particulars again, and anfwer'd again to\nthe Satisfa6tion of all the Company.\nBut here (and for this reafon I relate this part)\nhis Lordftiip, after asking many more Queftions,\nconcluded by adviftng I'averner to ask the Appari-\ntion when it came again, Whence are you, are you\na good or an evil Spirit ? by v^hich is fuppos'd his\nLordfliip underftood, Are you in a good or bad\nState j for his next Qiieftion was, Where is your\nAbode? what Station do you hold ? how are you\nregimented in the other World ? and what is the\nReafon that you appear for the Relief of your Son\nT 3\nia\n\flyB ^loe tiijton and Reality\nin fo fmall a Matter, when fo many Widows and\nOrphans are opprefs'd in the World, being de-\nfrauded of greater JVI alters, and none from thence\nof their Relations appear to right them ?\nAnd the very fame Night ta'verner meeting\nthe Apparition again, who, it feems, was fully fa-\ntisfy'd with what he had done in delivering the\nMeflage to the Executory at this Appearing 'Ta^\n'uerner ask'd him the Queftions above, but it gave\nhim no Anfwer 3 and indeed it could not be ex-\npe6bed that Curiofity fhould be anfwered.\n'\nFor, as I faid above, it is evident by the\nQueftions, the Biihop, in all thefc Examinations,\nfell in with the vulgar Error of the Time about\nfuch Apparitions, namely, that it was the Soul of\nyames Haddock', and well indeed might he ask how\nhe came 10 Appear, when others in Cafes of\ngreater Moment did not.\nBut he fhould have ask'd. How is it poflible\nyou that are dead fhould be acquainted with thefe\nCircumftances, when the Word of God fays ex-\nprefly the Dead know not any thing, and that all\ntheir Love and Hatred is perifhed ? Had he ask'd\nhim, that, perhaps he might have told him that he\nWas not xhtSouXo^James Haddock^ but a good Spirit\nfent from the invifible World by the efpecial directi-\non of Heaven, to right a poor, ruin'd, opprefs'd\nOrphan, abandoned to Injury by its own unnatural\nMother. But to talk of the Soul of James Had'\ndock^ and what Station it held in the other World,\nthe Apparition might well go away, and give no\nAnfwer to it.\nNor in any of this Difcourfe did the Appari-\ntion pretend it was not at Reft, or could not be\nat Reft 'till Juftice was done to the Child, or 'till\nthe Meftiige was deliver'd ; the Apparition was too\njuft to itfeif to fay fo: and on the other Hand,\n*tis to me one of the moft convincing Proofs, that\nit\n<1\n\fof AP PARITIO N S. 17^\nit was really an Apparition or Appearance of a\nSpirit.\nNow, as in other Cafes, what Spirit it was may\nbe worth taking Notice of 5 here is not the leafl\nroom to fuggeft that it was the Devil^ or an evil\nSpirit} and therefore the Bifhop was wrong in\nthat too, to ask if it was a good or evil Spirit; for\nhow ihould his Wifdom judge, who was himfelf\na good Man, that an evil Spirit fhould come of a\ngood Errand, to right an injur*d Orphan, an op-\nprefs'd Fatherlefs Child? the Devil^ or any evil\nSpirit, could hardly be fuppos'd to move about\nfuch Bufinefs.\nIt is to be obferv'd here, and fhould have been\nadded to the Story, that the faid Davis and his\nWife, tho' it feems much againft his Will, did\ngive up the Leafe to the Child, the Son of that\nJames Haddock j with this difmal Circumftance, at-\ntending it, viz. That about five Years after, and\nwhen the Bifhop was dead, one Cojilet^ who was\nthe Child's Truftee, threatned to take away the\nLeafe again, rail'd at ^averner^ and made terrible\nImprecations upon himfelf if he knew of the Leafe,\nand threatned to go to Law with the Orphan.\nBut one Night being drunk at the Town of i7\/7\/-\nHall^ near Lishurne in Ireland^ where all this Scene\nwas laid, going home he fell from his Horfe and\nnever fpoke more, and fo the Child enjoy'd the\nEflate peaceably ever after.\nI N a Word, the little injur'd Orphan feem'd to\nbe the Care of Heaven in a particular manner 5\nand the good Angel which appear'd in its behalf\nwithout doubt executed God's Juflice upon the\nwicked drunken OpprefTor, the Trufleej and as\nhe imprecated Vengeance on himfelf, fo that fame\nSpirit might be Commiffion'd to fee it fall upon\nhim.\nT 4 Ani>\n\f^io The Hijlory and Reality\nAnd here it mofl: naturally occurs to obfervc\nthat the departed Souls of Men and Women dead\nand buried, cannot be fuppos^d to have any Com-\nmiffion to execute particular Vengeance on any\nin this World i the Suppofition of this would\nbring a confus'd medly of Notions upon us, fuch\nas would be inconfiftcnt not with Religion only,\nbut even with common Senfej and which need\nnot take up any of our Pains to confute them.\nNothing has more filPd the idle Heads of\nthe old Women of thefe latter Ages than the\n^Stories of Ghofts and Apparitions coming to Peo-\nple, to tell them where Money was hidden, and\nhow to find it j and 'tis wonderful to me that\nfuch Tales fhould make fuch Impreflions, and that\nfomctimes among wife and judicious People too,\nas we find they have done. How many old Hou-\nfes have been almoft pull'd down, and Pitts fruit-\nlefly dug in the Earth, at the ridiculous Motion\nof pretended Apparitions? of which I ihall fpeak\nmore in its Place.\nI H A V E hitherto ftudioufly avoided giving you\nany Accounts, however extraordinary, that have\nbeen already made publickj but this one, which\nrelates to the Aflaflination of the great Duke of\nBuckingham^ (whether famous or infamous I know\nnot which to determine him) in the time of the\nlate King Charles I, I cannot omit, becaufe the va-\nrious manner of its being related fo eminently\ntouches the Cafe in Hand.\nThat the Duke of Buckingham was ftabb'd by\none Lieutenant Felton at Portfmouth^ as he was go-\ning upon an Expedition for the Relief of RochellCy\nHiilory is fo full of it, and all that know any\nthing of our EngUJh Annals are fo well acquainted\nwith the Story of it, that I need fay nothing to\nintroduce that Part: Mr. Aubrey takes upon him\n|:o relate the Story of an Apparition upon this Oc-\ncafion in the following manner\n:\nTo\n\fof APPARITIONS. '\nz8\n*' To one Mr. Towes who had been School- fel-\n*^\nlow with Sir George Fillers^ the Father of the\n** firft Duke of Buckingham^ and was his Friend\n^' and Neighbour, as he lay in his Bed awake (and\n*' it was Day-light) came into his Chamber the\n*' Phantome of his dear Friend Sir George Fillers.\n\" Said Mr. \"Towes to him. Why, you are dead i\n*' what makes you here? Said the Knight, I am\n'' dead, but cannot reft in Peace for the Wicked-\n*' nefs and Abomination of my Son George at Court,\n'' I do appear to, you to tell him of it, and to ad-\n*' vife and dehort him from \\ his evil ways. Said\n*'\nMr. Towes^ The Duke will not believe me, but\n'^ will fay that I am mad, or doat. Said Sir George\n\" Go to him from me, and tell him' by fuch\n*' a Token (a Mole) that he had in fome fecrec\n\" Place, which none but himfelf knew of. Accord-\n'' ingly Mr. Towes went to the Duke, who laughed\n*' at his Mejfage. At his return home, the Phantome\n*' appeared again, and told that the Duke would\n*' be ftabb'd (he drew out a Dagger) a quarter of a\n'' Year after 5 which accordingly happened.\nThis Part of the Story indeed is calculated like\na true Chimney-corner Piece of News 5 that Sir\nGeorget who was dead, ihould fay he could notoreft\nin Peace for the Wickednefs and Abomination of\nhis Son George at Court.\nPreposterous! What State muft old Sir\nGeorge be in? If in a State of Mifery, what does he\nmean by refiing in Peace ? if in a State of BlefTednefs,\nwhat could his Son do to impeach his Reft? and if\nwe fhall give any. weight to what the Scripture\nfays in that Cafe, he knew nothing of him, let his\nown State or his Son's -^^^;;^\/\u00bb^\/\/^;\/i (as he calls them)\nbe what they would. See Job xiv. ip, 20, 21. The\nwaters wear the Stones: thou wajheft away the things\nwhich grow out of the dufi of the earthy and thou de^\nfiroyefi the hope of man. Thou prevaileji for ever againfi\n\fz^% ^^ Hi\/lory and Reality\nI hini'i and he pajfeth : thou changefl his countenance^\nfindfendefi him awaf. His fans come to honour^ and he\nknoweth it not'y and they are brought low, hut he pev-\nceiveth it not of them,\n'Tis plain here that the Hope (that is the\nKnowledge and Wifdom) of Man as to this World,\nis deftroyed and waih'd away in Death j his Sons\nmay rife or fall, be great or little, high or low,\ngood or evil, *tis all one to him, he knows nothing\nof it. How then could Sir George Fillers fay, feveral\nYears after he was dead too, that he could not reft\nin Peace? What! had he been at Reft and in Peace,\nand was he difquieted again by his Son George*^\nWickcdnefs? that does not hang together at all.\nThe old Knight had been dead feveral Years before\njiis Son George came to rife at Court j when he did\nrife, he was not immediately fo abominably wicked\nas he was afterward : Where then was the Soul of\nSir George the Father, all the while? his Reft could\nnot bedifturb'd *tillthe Circumftances that difturb'd\nit happen'd.\n*\nB u T my Lord Clarendon tells this fame Story,\nxvith much more Probability of Truth j for\nfirft he leaves out the Abfurdity, which indeed his\nJLordfliip was too wife a Man to impofe upon the\nWorld with the Sandion of his Authority, nor\nwas there Senfe enough in it to give it Credit.\nI N the next Place he does not make the Perfon\nto whom Sir George Fillers appeared, be an Equal,\nand an Intimate Friend, but one that had liv'd in\nthe fame Town where Sir George had liv'd, and had\nnot feen him for many Years, but recolleded him\nfrom the Cloaths he had feen him wear j whereas\nthe Story above makes them dear Friends, which\nif it had been fo, it was not likely he fhould re-\nfufe to hear the Mcffage, and yet he fcruples it\nvery much.\nBui'\n\f,>t\nAPPARITIONS. t\nBut there are more difcording Circumftanccs in\nthe Story. Let us take the Lord Clarendon's Re-\nlation, which is done with an appparent Regard to\nTruth, and is as follows :\nThe Account ofthe Apparition ofSir George\nVillers, relating to the Murther of theT>uke\nof Buckingham his Son^ as taken from the\nLord ClarendonV Hijiory, Vol. L Fo. 34,\n35\". as follows:\n'' T H R R E were many Stories fcatter'd abroad at\n*^ that time of feveral Prophecies and Predidions\n\" of the Duke's untimely and violent Death j\n*' amongft the reft, there was one which was up-\n'* on a better Foundation of Credit than ufually\n*^ fuch Difcourfes are founded upon.\n\" There was an Officer in the King's Ward-\n*^ robe in Windfor-Caflle^ of a good Reputation\n'' for Honefty and Difcretion, and then about the\n*^ Age of fifty Years or more.\n\" This Man had in his Youth been bred in a\n'' School in the Parifti where Sir George FillerSj\n*^ the Father of the Duke, liv'd, and had been\n*' much cherifh'd and obliged in that Seafon of\n\" his Age by the faid Sir George^ whom after-\n\" wards he never faw.\n\" About fix Months before the miferable End\n*' of the Duke of Buckingham^ about Midnight,\n^^ this Man being in his Bed at Windfor^ where his\n*' Office was, and in very good Health, there ap-\n\" peared to him on the fide of his Bed, a Man\n*' of a very venerable Afpeft, who drew the Cur-\n\" tains of his Bed, and fixing his Eyes upon hin),\n'' ask'd him if he knew him.\n''The poor Man, half dead with Fear and Ap-\n*' prehenfion, beiiig ask'd the fecond time, whether\n\" he\n\f1 84 The Hijiory and Reality\n** he remembred him, and having in that time\n'* called to his Memory the Prefence of Sir George\n**\u2022\nFillers^ and the very Cloaths he ufed to wear,\n\" in which at that time he feem'd to be habited,\n\" he anfwer'd him.

Whether he had done as he had re-*\n\" quired of him 5 and perceiving he had not, gave\n'^ him very fevere Reprehenfions, told him he ex-\n*' pe6ted more Compliance from him, and that if\n*^ he did not perform his Commands, he fhould en-\n*' joy no Peace of Mind 5 but fhould always be\n\" purfu'd'by him: Upon which, he promifed him\n*'\nto obey. But the next Morning, waking out of\na good Sleep, tho' he was exceedingly perplex'd\nwith the lively Reprefentation of all Particulars\nto his Memory, he was willing dill to perfuade\n\" himfelf that he had only dream'd, and confi-^\n^' der'd that he was a Perfon at fuch a diftance\n*' from the Duke, that he knew not how to find\n^' Quc any Admiffion to his Prefence, much lefs\n\" had\n\fof APPARITIONS. iSy\n** had any Hope to be believed in what he fliould\n^' fay > fo with great Trouble and Unquietnefs he\n\" fpcnt fome time in thinking what he (hould do^\n\" and in the end refolved to do nothing in the\n'' matter.\n\"The fame Perfon appeared to him the third\n^' Time with a terrible Countenance, and bitterly\n*^ reproaching him for not performing what he had\n'^ promifed to do. The poor Man had, by this time,\n\" recovered the Courage to tell him, that in Truth\n*' he had deferred the Execution of his Commands,\n\" upon confidering how difficult a thing it would\n\" be for him to get any Accefs to the Duke, ha-\n\" ving Acquaintance with no Perfon about him 5\n\" and if he fhould obtain Admiflion to him, he\n\" Hiould never be able to perfuade him that he\n'* was fent in fuch a manner > that he fhould at\n\" leaft be thought to be mad, or to be fct ori\n^' and employ'd by his own, or the Malice of other\n'^ Men to abufe the Duke 3 and fo he fhould be fure\n\" to be undone.\n\" The Perfon reply'd, as he had done before,\n\" that he fhould never find Reft 'till he fhould\n\" perform what he required, and therefore he were\n\" better to difpatch it> that the Accefs to his Son\n\" was known to be very eafie, and that few Men\n\" waited long for him 5 and for the gaining him\n\" Credit, he would tell him two or three Parti-\n\" culars, which he charged him never to mention\n\" to any Perfon living but to the Duke himfelfj\n'^ and he fhould no fooner hear them but he fhould\n\" believe all the reft he fhould fay 5 and fo repeat-\n\" ing his Threats, he left him.\n\" In the Morning the poor Man, moreconfirm'd\n\" by the laft Appearance, made his Journey to\n\" London^ where the Court then was j he was ve-\n^' ry well known to Sir Ralph Freernan^ one of the\n\" Mafters of Requefts, who had married a Lady\n\" that\n\fThe Hiftory and Reality\n^^ that was nearly ally'd to the Duke, and was him-\n\" felf well received by him : To him this Man\n** went, and tho' he did not acquaint him with\n\" all the Particular^, he faid enough to let him\n<* Icnow there was fomething extraordinary in itj\n\" and the Knowledge he had of the Sobriety and\n\u2022^ Difcretion of the Man, made the more Impreflion\n*^ on him : He defircd that by his means he might\n\" be brought to the Duke in fuch a Place and in\n\" fuch a Manner as ihould be thought fit, affirm-\n*' ing that he had much to fay to him, and of\n*' fuch a Nature as would require much Privacy,\n*' and fome Time and Patience in the hearing.\n\"Sir Ralph promised he would fpeak firft with\n*' the Duke of him, and then he fhould under-\n*' ftand his Pleafurej and accordingly, the firft Op-\n\" portunity he did inform him of the Reputation\n*' and Honefty of the Man, and then what he de-\n\" fired, and of all he knew of the matter.\n\"The Duke, according to his ufual Opennefs\n\" and Condefcenfion, told him, that he was the\n\" next Day early to hunt with the Kingj that\n\" his Horfes fiiould attend him at Lambeth Bridge,\n\" where he fhould land by five of the Clock in the\n\" Morning J and if the Man attended him there at\n\" that Hour, he would walk and (peak with him\n'^ as long as ihould be neceflary. j\n\"Sir Ralph carried the Man with him the ^\n*' next Morning, and prefented him to the Duke\n\" at his Landing, who received him courteoufly,\n*' and walked afide in Conference near an Hour^\n*' none but his own Servants being at that Hour\n\" in that Place > and they and Sir Ralph at fuch a\n\" Diftance, that they could not hear a Word, tho*\n\" the Duke fometimes fpoke loud, and with great\n\" Commotion, which Sir Ralph the more eafily\n\" obferv'd and perceived, becaufe he kept his Eyes\n*' always fix'd upon tht Duke, having procur'd the\n\" Con-\n\fof APPARITIONS. xtr\n** Conference upon fomewhat he knew there was\n*' of extraordinary.\n\" The Man told him, in his Return over the\n'' Wacer, that when he mentioned thofe Particulars\n*' which were to gain him Credit, (the Subftance\n'' whereof he faid he durfl: not; impart unto him)\n** the Duke's Colour chang'd, and he fwore he\n\" could come at that Knowledge only by the De^\n''\n1^\/7, for that thofe Particulars were only knowa\n'^ to himfelf and to one Perfon more, who he\n^' was fure would never fpeak of it.\n\" The Duke purfu'd his Purpofc of Hunting,\n^' but was obferved to ride all the Morning with\n\"\u2022great Penfivenefs and in deep Thoughts, without\n\" any Delight in the Exercife he was upon 5 and\n\" before the Morning was fpent, left'the Field, and\n^^ alighted at his Mother's Lodgings in IFbiieball^\n\" with whom he was ihut up for the Space of two\n*' or three Hours j the Noife of their Difcourlc\n\" frequently reaching the Ears of thofe who at-\n*' tended in the next Rooms. And when the Duke\n\" left her, bis Countenance appeared full ofTrouble,\n\" with a Mixture of Anger-, a Countenance that\n\" was never before obferved in him in any Con*-\n*^ verfation with her, towards whom he had a pro-\n*' found Reverences and the Countefs her felf (for\n\" though ihe was married to a private Gentleman,\n\" Sir Thomas Compton^ Ihe had been created Coun--\n\" tefs of Buckingham fhortly after her Son had firll\n\" alTumed that Title) was at the Duke's leaving\n\" her found over-whelm'd in Tears, and in the\n\" higheft Agony imaginable.\n\" Whatever there was of all this, it is no-\n\" torious Truth, that when the News of the\n\" Duke's Murther (Vhich happen'd within a few\n^' Months after) was brought to his Mother, fhe\n''\nfeem'd not in the leaft degree furprized, but re-\n*' ceived it as if fhe had forefecn itj nor did after-\n^' wards\n\f88 The Hifiory and Reality\n\" wards exprefs fuch a degree of Sorrow as was\n\" expe6ted from fuch a Mother for the Lofs of\n\" fuch a Son.\nBesides the above-named clafhing Circum-\nftances in the differing Relation of this Story, there\nare one or two that are very material, as will ap-\npear by the following Remarks.\nJ. jIUBRET {2iys Mr. Towes, as he calls him,\nwent to the Duke, and told him the Token 5 not-\nwithftanding which, the Duke laugh'd at his Mef-\nfage: whereas my Lord Clarendon tells juft the con-\ntrary, that the Duke gave him an open, tho' a very\nparticular Audience > all his Attendance keeping at a\ndiftance, and that he held him in that earneft Difcoujrfe\nfor an Hour.\n2. jIUB RET (^ys^ the Token Sir G^^r^^ gave\nto enforce or engage his Son's Attention, was, that\nhe (the Duke) had a Mole in fuch a private Part of\nhis Body 5 but my Lord fays, the Token given was\nof fuch a Nature as the Duke fwore none but the\nZ)m\/and onePerfon in the World could know, and\nthat he was fure that one Perfon would not fpeak of\nit 5 and that the Duke was extremely difturbed when\nhe heard of it.\nN.B. FAME^ thd* with fome Privacy^ fays^\nthat the fecret 'token was an inceftuous Breach\nof Modefiy between the Duke and a certain\nLady too nearly related to him^ which it fur'-\nprized the Duke to hear of\\ and that as he\n\u2022 thought he had good Reafon to be fure the\nLady would not tell it of her felf^ fo he thought\nnone but the Devil could tell it bejides her > and\nthis aflonifhed hinty fo that he was very far\nfrom receiving the Man Jlightly^ or laughing\nat his Meffage.\nWhat this Apparition then was, and from\nivhom, or from whence, remains to be decided. That\nt^e thing was real, is too well attefted j it comes\nloaded\n\fof APP ARiriONS, 48p\nloaded with fo many concurring Circumfiances,\nand told in the hearing of fo many WitnefTes of\ngood Fame and Credir, that there is no Room\nto queftion the Fad^ and as to the various Ways\nof relating it, the Truth of the whole is not a-\nbated by it at all : only as is natural to things of\nthis Nature which pafs thro' fo many Hands, eve-\nry one expreffing themfelves their own way, tho*\nmeaning the fame thing > they often vary at laft in\nthe very Subftance, by only varying at firft in the\nCircumftances.\nThe Truth of the Matter is at laft, that the\nApparition foretold his Ruin, and it foon follow'd*\nNow that this Apparition could not be the Devily\nIS evident from the Reafons laid down before in\nthe like Cafes. How can we fuppofe the Devil\nwould be offended with the wicked Life and abo-\nminable Pra61:ices of the Duke of Buckingham ac\nCourt? His inceftuous Lewdnefs, and whatever o-\nther fcandalous Pradtices he allowed himfelf in, the\nDevil might, perhaps, encourage and prompt him\nto, but he would never fend a MeiTengef to him\nto warn him againft them, and to alarm him with\nApprehenfibns of Danger attending him if he did\nnot reform. This is none of the Devil's Bufinefs,\n'tis quite foreign to him, 'twould be the weakeft\nthing in the World to fuggeft it of him.\nAgain, if it were any thing immediately from Hea-\nven, it would have been effedual to have awaken*d\nand reformed him: But as it might be a kind MefTen-\nger from another part of the invifible VVorld, where\nhis approaching Fate was known, and who having\ngiven him this Notice, left his Reformation in his\nown Power, and laid the Neceffity of it before the\nEyes of his Reafon, as well as of his Confcience,\nand that after this his Fall was of himfelfj thi^\nmakes it all rational, and eafie to be underftood, and\nis agreeable to the ordinary Cuftom of Providence\nU in\n\f^po The H'tfiory and Reality\nin like Cafes, of which many Examples might be\ngiven in the World.\nNor is it flrange, that the Apparition fhould\nperfonate the old deceafed Father of the Duke, and\naflume his Shape, to add as it were a Solemnity to\nthe Meflage, and give it a greater Influence upon the\nMind of the Duke> and the fame Meflenger might\nhave afTumed any other Shape or Perfon if it had\nthought fit, whether living or dead.\nBut if the Shape aflumed was the moft likely\nto give Weight to the Errand it was to be fent a-\nbout, we are not to wonder at all that a Spirit em-\nploy'd, or employing it felf on an Errand of fuch\nImportance, fhould be able to fingle out fuch Ap-\npearances, or fuch Shapes and Perfons to appear in\nthe Figure of, as were apteft to enforce the Mef-\nfage. Thewell-chufing the Perfon is to me a Tefti-\nmony for, not againft the Goodnefs, the Judgment\nand Capacity of the perfonating Spirit, and would\nwith juft reafoning confirm to us the validity of the\nMeflage, and of the Mefl!engcr alfo.\nAnd yet 'tis very reafonable to believe, that Sir\nGeorge Fillers^ thus feeming to appear, and whofe\nSurface or Out-fide is put on like a Mafquerade\nHabit upon this Occafion, knew nothing ofit, and had\nno manner of concern in it. Nothing is more won-\nderful in any part of the Story to me, than that\nMen of Senfe and Learning, as fome fuch have been,\ncould be prevailed upon, or rather could prevail\nupon themfelvcs, to publifli to the World fuch in-\ncongruous, fuch irrational things as thefej thata Man\ndead, perhaps twenty Years before, I think it's fo\nmuch at leaft 5 fliould appear, and fay, he could not\nrefl: in Peace for fuch and fuch things. And in ano-\nther of the fame Author's Stories, an Apparition is\nbroughi; in appearing to Dr. 7'urber'ville'*^ Sifl:er, be-\ning a Lady who was dead, and had left fome Chil-\ndren to her Husband, which Children were injur'd\n7 by\n\fof APPAR IT IONS. 291\nby a fecond Wife, contrary to the Settlement of\nthe firft Wife's Marriage > and this Settlement of the\nfirft Marriage was it feems hid behind the Wain-\nfcot, in fuch and fuch a Place, which no body\nknew of but the Children's Mother, that is to fay\nthe firfl: Wife. This Lady appeared to difcover\nwhere this Writing lay, and tells the Perfon to\nwhom fhe difcover'd it, that 'till fhe had made this\nDifcovery, ihe had wander'd in the Air, but that\nnow Ihe was going to God.\nStrange! that Mr. Glanvil^ Auhrey^ and o-\nthers, could publiih fuch a Story as this, without\nfeme jufl: Enquiries to reconcile it to common\nSenfe, as well as to Religion \\ as particularly how\nlong this Lady had been Dead 5 for it feems to have\nbeen fome Years, the Husband being married again,\nand the Children being in danger of being wrong'd\nby the Children of the fecond Venter? Now, did\nthe Soul of the firft Lady wander all that while in\nthe Air, to fee whether there (hould be any oc-\ncafion for her, to vindicate her Children's Right,\nor no? did ihe ftay from going to God all that\nwhile, only for difcovering a conceal'd Deed, thac\nher Children might not be wrong'd? how fhall we\nmake fuch a thing out to be rational ? what No-\ntions of Religion or of a future State will fup-\nport it ?\nWhy did {he not immediately difcover where\nthe Deed, or Marriage Settlement lay, and put ic\ninto the Hands of fome honeft People, in Truft for\nher Children ? and then fhe had not need to have\nwander'd in the Air 'till it had been done.\nThey muft have very low-priz'd Thoughts of\nHeaven, and of going to God, after the departing\nor feparating of the Soul from the Body in Life,\nwho think the PafTage can be interrupted by any of\nthe Affairs of this Life left unfinifh'd. If even our\nRepentance unfinifh'd, our Peace with God unfi-\nU i niih'd,\n\f2 91 The Hifiory and Reathy\nnifh'd, can never be retreiv'd, if Time is not to be\nrecalled > but that as the \"Tree falh^ fo it Jhall lie :\nShall we pretend the Soul fhall be Hopped and in-\nterrupted in its PafTage, to retrieve the Injuftice and\nViolence done to the Orphans, or Relicls of the\nFamily? fhall the Soul be brought back to find out\nold hidden ParchmentS5or as it is pretended in other\nlike Stories, to dig up old long-buried Money, and\nthe like ?\nNo, noj thofe things fhould be done in time:\nlike Repentance, they ihould not be left to that\nHazard 5 for we may depend, there is no Work, or\nDevice, or Invention in the Grave, whither we are\nall going.\nThat there are invifibe Agents, which in Pur-\nfuance of the Government of Providence in the\nWorld, may be made Inftruments, to aft in fuch\nCafes as thefe 5 to difcover Writings which being\nconceal'd may ruin Families, rob and plunder Or-\nphans, and diftrefs the right Heirs of Eftates, and\nin many like Cafes, this need not bedeny'd, and is in-\ndeed not to be difputedj and 'tis a glorious Tefli-\nmony to the Jullice of Providence, that in fuch\nCafes he does not abandon the Widows and the\nOrphans, who for want of loft or conceal'd Deeds,\nare fomeiimes in Danger of being undone, by Vio-\nlence and Rapine. But all this is eafier to be un-\nderftood to be done without Interruption of the\nordinary Courfe of Things, without obftrufting the\nSouPs FalTage into irs determined flate of Happi-\nnefs or Mifery 5 which it muft be the weakeft, and\nindeed the wickedeft thing in the World, to think\ncan be diverted by thefe Trifles > and whofe di-\nrect ProgrefHon is plainly ftated \\n the Scripture in\nthefe Words : It is appointed unto all Men once to die^\nand after Death to Judgment y or immediately after\nDeath to Judgment, at leaft fo as nothing to prevent or\nintervene 3 Heb, ix.

ARITIO N S. 2P3\ntbefe things can never break in upon that folemn\nAppointment:\nBesides, 'tis an evident Impeachment of the\nPower and Juftice, as well as the Wifdom of Pro-\nvidence, in his Difpofition of things, as if he could\nnot find out Ways to do right to injur'd Orphans,\nor to deted the Injuftice and Oppreflion of violenc\nand unreafonable Men, but the Soul of the depart-\ned Mother muftjbe kept out of Heaven to do it her\nfelf. Horrid Abfurdity ! and inconfiftent with all\nthe Notions that true Religion has iafpir'dus with,\nrelating to a Future State, and to the Gulph that is\nfix'd betwen this and that.\nThe Soul can no more be kept out from, or\ndelay'd its Entrance into Heaven, if its Portion be\nappointed for Happinefs, by any Concern for the\nAffairs of this World, than it can be difquieted af-\nter it is entered thofe Realms of Peace, and difturbed\nor brought back from thence upon any Account\nwhatfoever.\nThe very thoughts of it are fo mean, fo low-\nrated and bafe, that 'tis unworthy of our Rea-\nfon, but efpecially of our Chriftian reafoning; Pow-\ners, to entertain them. I take this Abfurdicy in-\ndeed to be much of the Caufe of that juit Ridicule,\nwhich the wifer Part of Mankind have put upon\nmoft of the Stories which are told among us about\nWitchcraft and Apparitions 5 for that they are\ntold with fuch evident Inconfillences, that they\ncannot go down with rational People: Who caa\nbelieve what cannot be true? who can make a feri-\nous thing of a piece of ridiculous Nonfenfe ? That ^\na Soul difmifs'd from Life, and going diredly into\nHeaven, {hall be call'd back by the Cry of the\nChildren after her, with a bold! ftay Mother! come\nhack^ and come and tell us where the Writings are for\nyour Joynture^ or we jhall he undone? and the poor\nMother, Uncas'd, Unembodied, muft come back,\nU }\ndifmift\n\f2p4 ^^ Hlftory and Reality\ndifmlfs the Angels that were carrying her into^^^rjr\nhanC^ Bofom, and bid them came for her another\ntime 5 and here fhe mud hover about we know not\nhow many Years, to do Right to thefe Children.\nSure the fame Power that could thus interrupt her\nPafTage into Heaven, might have prevented her fe-\nparatmg from the Body, and flic might with as\nmuch cafe, and lefs injuftice to her felf, have been\nkept out of the Grave, as kept out of Heaven.\nBut I am fick of the very Repetition > the De-\nlufion is fo grofs, I fay it is not to be wondered\nthat we are fliock'd by it in our belief of the thing\ncaird Apparition in general. The ridiculous Part\ndifcredits the real Part, and it being fo fufeiting to\nour Reafon to hear the firft Part, we throw off our\nPatience, and will hear nothing at all of it.\nI T is true we fliould not do thus 3 the Reality of\nthe Thing, abflra6ted from thefe diftrafted and en-\nthufialiick Notions,is not leflen'd : 'tis our Bufinefs\nthen to reje6t the foolifli Part, which indeed has\nalmoft fmother'd and buried the reft in its Duft and\nRubbifli, and let us judge rightly of things as they\nare. There is no want of Examples, where (Provi-\ndence permitting) Apparition has made Difcove-\nries of villainous and difboneft A6rions and Defigns;\ndete6ted Violence and Murther, done Right to in-\njured and opprefs'd Widows, and Fatherlefs Chil-\ndren; and this without fuch a monftrousandincon-\nfiftent Addition,as that of bringing back the Soul from\nits Entrance into Heaven, or difturbing its Reft and\nPeace in a future State : things too grofs to be fo\nmuch as nam'd among Chriftians, whofe Faith in\nthings Future is too well eftablifh'd to be capable\nof receiving any Impreflions from fiich Delufions.\nI HAVE an Example in Siory very particular\nto this Cafe ; and which my Author aftijres me of\nthe Truth of, tho' never yet publifti'd in Print;\nThe Story is told of the late Reverend Dr. Scot^ a\nMan\n\f\fTa^. 2^\/ ^\/ '\/^y\/zr\/\/\/\" .\/>\/\/.>\n\fof A P P ARITI N S. x^^\nMan whofe Learning and Piety was eminent, and\nwhofe Judgment was known to be fo good, as noc\nto be eafily impofed upon.\nThe Dodor, as I have the Story related, was\nfitting alone by the Fire, either in his Study or\nhis Parlourjin Broadftreet where he liv'djand reading\na Book, his Door being ihut fail and lock'dihe was\nwell affiir'd there was no body in the Room but\nhimfelf, when accidentally railing his Head a little,\nhe was exceedingly furpriz'd to fee fitting in an\nElbow Chair, at the other fide of the Fire-place or\nChimney, an Antient grave Gentleman in a black\nVelvet Gown, a long Whig, and looking with a\npleafing Countenance towards him {the Do^or) as\nif juft going to fpeak.\nN.

Establish your Mind in this particular\nand fundamental Article, that whatever appears\nit muft be either a good Spirit from the invifible\nWorld, an Agent of Mercy, a Meflenger of Peace,\nand confequently will do you no Hurt: OR,\n2. A N evil Spirit^ an Agent of Hell from Satan's\nRegion and Empire, the Air; and that fo what-\never evil Defign or evil MefFage he pretends to\ncome about, and however mifchievous his Inten-\ntion is, he cannot do the Hurt he defires, becaufe\nthat as the good Spirits are under Dire6bion, fo\nthe bad are under Limitation j the one will not^\nand the other cannot hurt you, without an imme-\ndiate Command from above. The Fear therefore\nwhich\n\fof APPARITIONS. 321\nl^hich we have upon us concerning Apparition, h\nnot or ought not to be guided by their Appear-\nance, but by the reditude of our own Thoughts j\nand as we are or are not quiet and calm within, fo\nwe ihall or ihall not be under Apprehenfions from\nAvirhout.\nFortify your Minds then with a fteady Con-\nfidence in the Supreme iVIaker and Governour of\nall things, who has the great red Dragon in a\nChain 5 and when you think you fee the Devil^\nfear nothings for He will never let loofe the De-\nflroycr upon any one whofe Mind is fteadily fix'd\nupon himfelf.\nThis is a critical, and perhaps a too curious\nPiece of Pradice for me to meddle with, efpeci-\nally here, and muft be but gently touch'd at 5 you\nwill, it may be, obje6t too againft the Dodrine\nof it, and fay, Who can fo efFe61:ually truft in\nGod, as not to be at all afraid of the Devil ? Now,\ntho' this may feem true upon many Accounts, and,\nas Times go with us, may be really a juft Obje-\nction, yet, if we will believe Hiftory or Experi-\nence, it is not fo much a Difficulty as to fay Who\ncan do it? for it has been done.\nI REMEMBER the knowu and famous Story\nof a Maid Under a real and perfonal PoffeiEon of\nthe Devily at Little Gad\/den in Hertfordjhire^ tho*\nby an unhappy Difappointment I was not prefent,\nnot knowing of the thing tiaie enough 5 yet I faw\nand conversed with feveral that were prefent and\nheard the Devil fpeak in the Maid and by the Or-\ngan of her Voice, tho' without any apparent Motion\nof her Tongue or Lips, or any Part of her Mouth*\nO F this Perfon it was pofitively true, thac\nthere was a certain good Man, tho' a Lay\nChriftian, who fo frequently pray'd with the poor\nDemoniack, being a Neighbour of her Father's,\nand fo conftantly talk'd to the Devil^ and batter'd\nY him\n\f^li The Hijiory and Reality\nhfm with Scripture, that he was, as I might\nfay, the Devil's Terror, and he would not let the\nGirl go to any Houfe or into any Room where\nthis Man (whole Name was Monks) was 5 and if fhe\nwas dire6led to any Place he would (lop her, as if he\nwas to go and fee firil if Mr. Monks was there or\nnot, and then he would bid her go, for Monks was\nnot there.\nNow, as i am well affured of the Truth both\nof the Girl's being poflelTed, really a6i:uated by a De\"\nI\n*z;\/\/inher, and of this Z)<?w7 being afraid of Mr. A\/(9;^)^j>\nthen the Qiieftion above is fo far dire&ly anfwer'd,\nthat it is poflible to arrive to fuch a State, as not\nonly not to be afraid of the Devil^ but even to make\nthe Devil afraid of us. 1 confefs it would be a State\nof Felicity that would make Life very eafie to us up-\non many Accounts 5 and I could enlarge very pleafant-\nly (to my fclf) upon that Subjc6t. But as things go\nwith the World, I queftion much whether it would\nbe fo pleafant to thofe I am writing to, and there-\nfore I leave it : and fo if I have been preaching a\nlittle, it is fo little in length, and I hope fo much\nto the purpofe, that you may forgive me for once,\nefpecially upon Promife of faying as little for your\nGood for the time to come, as I can.\nThere is indeed a right worthy and commend-\nable State of Indifference, not only as to Who (hall\nor fhall not vilit us from the invilible World, and\nfrom what Part of it .they come> but alfo as to\nwhat Station we are to have among them hereafter i\nand this happy Temper is much recommended to\nme by fome of my fafhionable Friends, as a mod\ndefirable Condition of Life: to be perfedly eafy, void\nofAnxiety and Perplexities of any kind, and forming\nthe moft perfect Compofure of Soul that can be\nimagined.\nThey defcribe this the moft accurately indeed\nby the Pradice, for they fay moft feelingly, that\nno\n\fof APPARITIONS. 3Z5\nno Tongue can exprefs the Felicity of it 5 which\nindeed I believe is very true 5 they are perfe61:ly eafy\naboutjbecaufe thoughtlefs of, that dull remote thing\ncalled Futurity. As tor there being a State of Life,\nor a Something like Life after Death, they can't fay\nbut it may be ib, for they never enquired much in-\nto the Pnnciples of the 'Saduces^ or into any other\nPricinciples about it. But what that State is to be,\nor what we are to be, or not to be, in it, they ne-\nver trouble themfelves about it ^ they look upon it as\na thing remote, which People are not agreed about,\nand they believe never xs\/'ill, 'till they come there 5\nand to be beating their Heads and perplexing their\nThoughts, about what, when they have done all,\nthey are fure they fhall never arrive to a Cer-\ntainty about, they do not fee 'tis to the Purpofeat all.\nThis is certainly a mighty brief Way with\ntheir Doubts, and a ihort anfwer to all Enquiries j\nand I muft own 'tis putting a fhort end to all\nDifputes with themfelves, about the thing called a\nfuture State.\nBut there remains a Queftion Hill unanfwer'd,\nand which is aQueflion of moment with me, what-\never it may be with them, viz. Where is the Feli-\ncity of this kind of Calm ?\nO, fays a Deifi of mf Acquaintance^ Peace of Mind\nis a Felicity, I hope.\nYes, paid \/, if it be built upon a right Founda-\ntion.\nNay, y^^'j he^ Peace is Peace 5 don't tell me of\nFoundations.\nHold Friend, [aid \/, even Molinos himfelf the Au-\nthor of the ^ietifme^ which one Author well calls\nSotifme^ and ot the Sc6t of the ^ietifis^ and who re-\nfolved all Felicity and all Religion into the Calm of\na retired Soul, yet fixed that Calm upon the Me-\nditations of an upright Mind, and the Calm of a clear\nHeart.\nY i I\n\f5 24 ^^ Hijlory and Redlt^\nI VALFE none of your Sedts, fays my Friend.\nGallio was a true Politician and a happy Man, j4^s\nxviii. 17. \/\/^ cared for none of thefe things y and there\nwas his Happincfs,\nS o a Madman, fays \/, is happy in his Lunacy,\nand enjoys a thoughtlcfs Calm, all the while he is\nin the greateft Hurry and Diforder of his Soul.

Who are you for ? Whence\ncome you? What have you to fay to me ? And it may\nbe gives it for Anfwer, Very well, go about your\nBufinefs then, I have nothing to fay to you. And\nthis fort of Courage, as he calls it, this unconcerned\nBravery, he recommends as the beft way to deal with\nthefe Spirits.\nBut fuppofe the Devil won't be put ofF (o^ but\nlays, I'll come and Vifit you to-morrow in another\nY 3 Drefs,\n\f^i6 ' The Hijiory and Reality\nDrefsj ril try your Courage \u2022, and at kft mafters this\nfort of indolent, unconcern'd Eafinefs, and the\nMan falls into Terror and Amazement \\ what has he\nat the bottom to preferve him from the Devil then?\ntruly nothing 5 but he is, like Cajhio Burroughs^ all\ntrembling, and cries out, O God ! here Jhe comes^ and\nis frighted even to Death. Certainly a cold Indiffe-\nrence about it whether it be an Angtl or the Devilj\nand above all, whether its Meffage be from Hea-\nven or Hell, will not hold it out againft the Ter-\nror that may come along with it from without, or\nthe rcfleiStions ofGuikthatmaybe railed by it from\nwithin ; fo that fome better-grounded Courage, a\nCalm begun from a better Principle, muft be en-\nquir'd after j oreltejas I fiid to my Deiftical Friend,\nwhen you do really fee the Devil you will not be\nfo eafy as you promife your felf to be. But this is\ntoo ferious for you, I muft go on.\nI COME next to the Enquiry, Whatis our bufi-\ni\\t{sj and how fhould we behave if it is our mif-\nfortune to have any fuch Appearance come to us?\nand fuppofe our Minds to be as much composed as\nordinarily may be expedted, not more than our\nNeighbours 5 but what, Ifay^ (hall we do, and what\nis the beft courfe for us to take ?\nIn my Opinion, and it is the next Advice I\nwould give, I (ay next to that of fortifying the\nMind with religious Confiderations, of which I\nhave fpoken, and which fhould always go firll,\nJpeak to it.\nB Y fpeaking to it, my meaning is. Speak tho' it\ndoes not fpeak to you. I have heard of fome Ap-\nparitions, who *tis faid, had no power to fpeak 'till\nthey were firlt fpoken to,and fome cafes of that kind\nare publifh'd by thnfe who I fuppofe believ'd them j\ntho' I fee no reafon to do fo j and particularly of an\nApparition that caufed a poor Man to follow it\nover Hedge and Ditch all Night for many a Night\ntogether,\n\fof APPAR IT IONS. 327\ntogether, 'till the poor Man was almoft hurry 'd to\nDeath j but could not fpeak to him,and the frighted\nWretch was afraid to fpeak to it 5 but at laft the\nMan fpoke, and then the Apparition's Mouth wa*\nloofed too: all which I mud confefs I fee no man-\nner of reafon to believe, and therefore cannot re-\ncommend it to any body elfe to believe.\nThere feems no Confiftency in the Nature of\nthe thing, no foundation for it in Religion, or\nany thing in it that we can Reafon upon for our\nown Underftanding 5 and where neither Nature,\nReligion or Reafon allow us any Light in it, upon\nwhat Principle can we go to make our Judgment ?\nBut leaving it therefore where we find it, I\nfay if you fee an Apparition, that is fuch an Appa-\nrition as we have been fpeaking of, not a Phan-\ntofm of your own Brain,not an imaginary Apparition\nthe cfFedfc of Fright or Dream, or meer Whimfie,\nnot a! Hypocondriack Apparition, the effe6b of Va-\npours and Hyftsrick Shadows, when the Eye fees\ndouble, and Imagination makes it felf a Teiefcope\nto the Soul, not to fhow Realities, bun to magnify\nObjefe at the remotefl diftance, and fhow thmgs\nas in being which are not, if you fee fuch an \/Ap-\nparition as this and fpeak to it, 'tis no wonder you\nreceive no anfwer, and fo you go away more\nfrighted with a filent dumb Devil than you would\nbe with a fpeaking one 5 but I fay, if the Vifion be\nreal, if it be a Shape and Appearance in form as\nhas been defcrib'd, never ihun it and fly from it 5\nhut fpeak to it,\nI F you would ask me what you fhould fay to it,\n'tis an unfair Qiieftion in fome Refpe6ls j 'tis not\npoffible for any one to di6late, without the proper\nCircumftanccs be defcrib'd. The old way you all\nknow : In the name of^ 6cc. as above, is the common\nroad. I will not cry down the Cuftooi, becaufe 'tis\nthe ufual way, and the words are good 5 but I be^\nY 4 lievc\n\f328 The Hijlory dnd Reality\nlieve a fincere mental Ejacularory Prayer to the\nBlefled Being of Beings for his fuperior Prefence,\n'\nwould be as efFe6lual as prefenting the Words to\nthe Devil as a kind of Exorcifm 5 fuch a Petition\nfent up, and then a plain what are you ? I think is\nCompliment enough for the Devil.\nA N honeft, plain, religious Scotfman who I knew,\nand who thought he faw the Devil^ tho' he was\nmiftaken too, yet had this (to me) perfe6tly new\nExpreflion upon the furprife, the Lord be between me\nflnd thee^ Satan awa^ that is go away, or get thee\naway: 'twas certainly a good thought, and the poor\nMan was right, for if the Lord was between him\nand the Devil there was no great need to fear\nhim or any of his.\nB u T to wave particular Infl:ru6tions in the cafe,\nthe Occafion will certainly adminifter the Subftancc\nof what you fhould fay > the prefent Direction is\nonly in general, f^eak to it^ never fink under the\nTerror or Surprize of the fight. The Devil is rarely\nfeen in his own Shape, and ordinarily for ends of\nhis own, he chufes to appear in familiar Shapes,\nperfonating fome or other that we know, or have\nknown, and reprefenting to our Fancy fomething\nthat will not terrify us 5 nay, 'tis the Opinion of\nthe learned Divines, that the Devil would do much\nlefs harm, and be far lefs dangerous, if he appeared\nas a meer Devil^ with his Horns, his cloven Hoof,\nand his Serpent's Tayl and Dragon's Wings, as\nFancy figures him out, and as our Painters drefs him\nup, than he does in his difguifes, and the many\nShapes and Figures he aflumes to himfelf.\nSo fatal are Mnfques and Difguifes, Habits and\nDrefles to the World, and fuch advantage does a\nfalfe Countenance give to Criminal Performances of\nynany kinds, that even the Devil is more dangerous\n^refs'd up in Mafquerade, than in his own Cloarhs,\ngnd in his own Colours > if he would come in ail\n\fof APPARiriONS. JX9\nhis Formalities and Frightfuls, he would not be\ncapable of half fo many Coufinings and Cheatings\nas he now puts upon us : now you have him here and\nhave him there, you have him every where and no\nwhere, he is here a Tempter to Wickednefs, there a\nPreacher of Righteoufnefs} to-day in one difguife,\nto-morrow in another j you know him and you\ndon't know him, fee him and don't fee him, and\nhow then can any one tell you what to fay to him,\nor how to talk with him ?\nHowever, to come as near to it as we can,\nthe firft and ordinary Queftion, natural to the\nOccafion, is to know who he is, and whence he\ncomes, what MefTage he has to deliver, what Bu-\niinefs he comes about, and what you have to do\nwith ir, why he diiturbs you in particular, and the\nlike 5 and if you may obtain fo much Civility froni\nhim, to defire him to trouble you no more 3 efpecially\nif you find the Apparition to be of the worft\nkind.\nI F it is apparently a good Spirit, I think the\nCondu6t fliould differ, as the MefTage he comes about\nwill certainly differ j if it warns you to repent of\nfuch and fuch a fcandalous Life j or if it bids you\nreform fuch and fuch a criminal Pra\u00a3tice,which you\nknow your felf guilty of j accept the kind Adrao-\nnition,fubmit to the Reproof, and promife Obediencej\nyou may depend, as I have often fliid, the Devil\ncomes of no fuch Errand.\nI F it tells you fuch and fuch Dangers attend you,\ntake the kind hint, and ufe the proper means to\navoid them, thankfully acknowledging the Good-\nncfs of the Hand that fent the Notice, as well as\nthe MefTcnger that brought it > for depend upon ic\ntheZ)<fi\/77, who is a Lover and Author, as well as the\nPromoter of Mifchief, takes no Pains to prevent it,\nbut would rather have a Hand in bringing it upon\nyoii.\nAnd\n\f330 The Hifiory and Reality\nAnd if fuch things as thefe are the Subjc6b of\nthe MclTige, what can you fay why you ihould be\nafraid of the Meflengcr ? 'Tis hard to rejoice in\nthe MelTage, and be Icar'd at the MefTenger : the\ntruth is, we are not much accuftom'd to fuch folemn\nAdmonitions, fuch good and beneficent Cautions\nand AfTiilancesj and this makes the thing ftrange\nand aweful, and be received with Terror and Fright,\nand perhaps if it was not fo we ihould receive\nthem oftner.\nWe do not find the old Patriarchs, or after\nthem, the Children of Ifrael^ were fo frighted at\nthe Apparition of Angels and Spirits 5 it's true in-\ndeed when the Angel appeared to Gideon at the\nThrefliing-Floor, it is faid he was troubled at his\nPrefenccj neverthelefs the Mefla^e was kind and\nencouraging 5 yet we find he recovered himfclf, and\ntook Courage to talk very particularly with it, and\nto expoftulate with him about the Circumftances\nof his Country, and of the People, and even to\nask a double Sign from the Angel to confirm his\nFaith : and how went he on ? he obey'd the Voice\nof the Vifion, notwithftanding all his Fears and\nDoubts, and he bow'd his Soul, and foUow'd the\nDireftions given him.\nThere are abundance of Reafons why we\nihould liften to fuch Apparitions as thefe 5 their\ndiftinguifhing Chara6ter is, that they always come\nof fome Errand or other for the good of Man-\nkind 'y take it either in general, or in particular :\nSometimes 'tis alledg'd they come upon trifling and\nmean Occafions, as is the Cafe in many Inftances\ngiven in Story, and in Print. But it may be an-\nfwered with an Enquiry, Are we fure thefe are not\ntrifling Stories, and brought in by Perfons, perhaps,\nbut half informed ? But what are we to think of\nthe Apparition to King James V. in Scotland^\nwho warn'd him againft his Flodden-Field Expedi-\ntion?\n\fof AVVARiriON S. 33t\ntion? which if he had liften'd to he had fav'd his^ \"\nLife, and the Lives of ten thoufand of his People:\nfor lefs, 'tis faid, did not fall in the whole Un-\ndertaking.\nAnd what fhall we fay of the Warning given\nto the Duke of Buckingham^ by the Apparition of\nhis own Father, which if he had liften'd to, 'tis\nvery likely he had efcap'd the fatal Knife ? for Fel-\nton^ who AffafHnated him, did it, as it feems he\ndeclared at the Gibbet, upon the Account of the\nPopular Hatred, and that he thought him a pub-\nlick Enemy to his Country.\nThese, and many more which I have men-\ntion'd, or which I have not mention'd, have been\nthe Subje6l of fuch MefTcngers, and were far from\ntrifling. If an Apparition gives any of us Notice\nof our approaching End, and bids us prepare for\nit, is not the MelTage folemn, and the Occafion\nof it weighty j and is not the Notice worth our\nRegard? Is the Preparation for Death a trifling\nthing? and the aflurance how near the time is can-\nnot but be a valuable Notice 3 I am fure it oughc\nto be elleem'd fo.\nA floutin'g atheiflick Man of Wit, who\nmuft be namelefs, becaufe he will not bear to be\nnam'd to the Crimes which he is not alliam'd to\ncommit, told me, when difcourfing this Part of\nthe Subje6i:, that it was no Kindnefs at all, for\nthat Men ought always to be prepared for Death j\nand yet cou'd not deny but that it was a remote\nAfFair which he had not yet given himfelf the\ntrouble to think about.\nI CANNOT believe but that if fome People,\nwho now value themfelves upon their bright\nThoughts, and their being above the Power of\nChagrine, or of any melanchoUy Refle6i:ions to di-\nflurb their Joy, were told (nay, tho' it was by a\nkind Apparition) that they were to die, one in a\nFortnight,\n4\n\f3 3 ^ TT^^ Hijiory and Reality\nFortnight, one in three Days; one at one time,\nand one at another, and all within a (hort time, they\nwould have a little alteration upon their Out-fides.\nG' M who laughs evermore, is conti-\nnually tittering and prompting others to thelowefl-\npriz'd Part of Mirth, who is all Levity and Froth,\nand owns that one Sigh never yet reach'd his\nHeart; fhould a folemn Apparition come to him\nand his merry Friend, the very Duplicate of him-\nfelf, and fay.

How would they fit down in Tears\nand Repentance, or fink into the Death foretold,\neven by the meer Horror of its approach ? for\nthere is the raoft Dread where there is the leafc Re-\npentance : Nor let any one cavil at the Exprefiion,\na Sentence and a Reprieve, let them take it as they\nWilli the thing is no lefs, and can be under-\nllood no otherwife of us all: We are all under the\nSentence, as dire6bly as a ^^riminal that hears it read\nat the Bar, with only this fignificant Difference,\nnamely.

Nor can I doubt but that many\nhad warnings in Dreams, that is, as I fay, by Appa-\nritions in Dream, by Vifions, and fome by open Ap-\nparitions, that the City would be deftroycd.\nRABBI JUDAH fays, the Patriarchs ap-\npeared to many, and gave them Notice, that the\nRomans would come and beflege their City, and\nthat the Temple fliould be deftroyed 5 but I doubt\nmuch of the Story, and that On a double Account.\nI .\nWhether ever any ofthe Patriarchs did {o appear and\nforewarn themj for had they done fo, they would\ncertainly have told them that the Meffiah was come,\nand that therefore the fecond Temple was to be\ndeftroy'd, for that all the Prophefies were fulfill'd.\nBur, i.

A Ghoft was\nfaid to haunt a certain Houfe in the Country not\nfar from Rygate in Surrey i it was met in the Gar-\nden by one of the Family, who had long valued\nhimfelf upon believing, and faying alfo, that there\nwere no liich things as Apparitions, and that he\nwould\n\fof APPARITIONS. 337\nwould be fure of it when-ever he met fuch a thing,\nhe would know what it was made of before he parted\nwith it.\nGoing out of the Houfe in the Evening when\nit was almoft dark, but not quite, he meets the\nApparition in the Garden j the Apparition fhun'd him,\nand would not have been feen, or made as if it would\nnot have been ktn.HJ! fays he boldly, areyou there f\nWhat are you ? The Apparition flill makes from him,\n-and he fpeaks again, \/F\/^^^r^;'^^.^ What is your Name?\nfays he, in a knid of jefting manner. My Bufmefs is\nnot with you^ fays the Apparition.

I knew One fired a Gun at\nan Apparition, and theGunburflin a hundred Pieces\nin his Hand, (that is in a great many Pieces.) Ano-\nther ftruck at an Apparition with a Sword, and broke\nhis Sword in Pieces, and wounded his Hand grie-\nvoufly. It is mofl certain that an Apparition or a\nSpirit is not to be cut with a Sword, or fhot with\na Gun ', as there is no Subftance, there can be no\nWound made 5 and 'tis next to Madnefs for any one\nto go that way to work, be it Angel or be it Dsvi\/.\nZ But\n\f33\n8\nThe Hifiory and Reality\nBut to carry this farther : In particular, an Ap*\nparition niay ihew itfelf, and peForm its Miffion in\na full and compleat manner, and yet not fpeak I\nhave a Story by me of a Gentleman who carried\non a Secret and Criminal Converfation with a cer-\ntain Lady, and having made an Aflignation to nieet\nthe Lady, was met at the Place by an Apparition\nof his own Mother J ihe faid nothing, {he did\n, not offer to fpeak, nor did he at firft know it to\nbe an Apparition. The Gentleman walks about\nin the Field near a Houfe where he had appointed\nthe Lady to meet j the Apparition walk'd about\nlikewife, and he takes it to be a Woman in ordi-\nnary, as any Woman might be feen to walk up and\ndown in the ftme Field or Walk.\nB Y and by the Woman or Lady appointed\ncomes, he meets her, and goes forward to falute\nher 3 the Apparition Ihows itfelf juft behind the\nLady, and looks him full in the Face> he ftarts\nback from the Lady, and inftead of kiffing her, cries\n'\"out^ and asks her, Who's that behind herj ihe turns\n^\nabout, but fees nobody, nor he neither, which\nfrights them both.\nHe fancies it to be an imaginary Vapour, ha-\nving no Faith at all in Apparitions, and offers to\ngo up to the Lady again 5 and behold, he fees the\nApparition juft behind her again, the Face ftand-\n'\ning juft fo as to look over the Lndy's Shoulder,\n'\n^nd ilare juft upon him 3 he cries out again, and\nknows it to be his Mother, who it feems was dead,\nand in crying out again, he adds. My Mother!\nat which it vanifhes.\nHad this Apparition any occafion to fpeak?\nWas it not Rebuke enough to look him in the\nFace? Even in common Affairs, a Look from the\n'Eye of one who has Authority to reprove, is fome-\n^\"times more effedual than the Reproof, if it was\ngiven in Words at length.\nSup-\n\fof APPARITIONS. 53^\nSuppose this Spe\u00a3tre to regard him not with\na threatning Afpe^b, but wirh a Countenance of\nPity, of a Maternal Reprehenfion, a Reproof urg-\ning Shame and Reproach, Hke that of Solomon^-\nPFhat^ my Son! what^ the Son of my Vows! my Son\nhe feen emhracing a Strumpet! the Man went away,\nfays my Story, fill'd with Confufion 3 as no queftion\nindeed but he would.\nHere was no need of Speech j the Look wa^\na Lafh, and a Reproof fufficientj the Man would\nhardly meet there any more, if he would meet the\nfame Lady any more, and 'tis very likely he never\ndid.\n'T I s very unhappy in the Cafe before me, that\nit is impofllble to atteft the Truth of all the Sto-\nries which are handed about upon fuch a Subje6t\nas this is 3 and therefore tho' I might make Flou-\nriihes of the Truth of the Particulars in all Cafes,\nas others doj I chufe rather to infifl: upon the\nMoral of every Story, whatever the Fa6i: may bCf\nand to inforce the Influence, fuppofing the Hiilory^\nto be real, or whether it be really fo or not, whicfit.\nis not much material.\nAll thefe Cafes, however, return me back to\nthe Advice above, namely, always if you fee an\nApparition, yp^^\/^ to it^ fpeak to it early, and anfwer\nany Queflions it asks, but be fure to ask it no Que-\nllions except fuch as are reafonable, and may be\nfuppofed to be within the Reach of its immediate\nCapacity to anfwer; no Queflions tending to re-\nveal the Myfleries of a future State. To ask fuch\nQueflions as are a plain diving into the Secrets of\nHeaven, which it is already declared {hall not be laid\nopen, is asking the good Spirit, if it be fuch, to of-\nfend on his Part, and is really criminal on your Part 5\nas, to ask what Condition the Perfon is in, meaning\nthe Perfon whofe Shape the Apparition takes up j\nHow he gets Leave to appear herej why he comes\nZ 2, ia\n\f34^ 5^^^ Hijiorj and Reality\nin this or that Manner j what kind of Place Hea^\nven is, and fuch like 3 as the Bilhop of Down and\nConnor ordered James Haddock to ask.\nBurfuit your Queftions to what the Spe<5bre\nIhall fay, or as the manner of its Appearance fhall\ndirecb you 5 as particularly, if it requires you to do\nany thing, to fpeak to any Perfon, or to deliver any\nAdmonition to a third Perfon, as in the cafe of the A p-\nparit ion about the Duke of Buckingham^ and as in\nthe Cafe of Dr. Scot and others 3 you may juftly aslc\nTokens by which you may make your felf be be-\nlieved 3 alio fuch Queftions as relate to yourfelf, and\nto the Nature of the thing which the Apparition\ncomes about.\nBut Quedions relating to things beyond Time^j^\ncurious Enquiries into Futurity and Eternity, are\nupon many Accounts to be avoided 3 and for fome\nReafons which 1 care not to mention in particular\n;\nbecaufe I would not form frightful Ideas in the\nMinds of thofe that read. I have fome Stories by\nme which give an Account that upon fuch needleft\nInquiries the Apparition has turn'd itfelf into ter-\nrifying Appearances, intimating Refentment 3 not\nonly a Refentment on its own Account, but as if it\nwas an Offence and a high Provocation to the fu-\npreme Power to offer to fearch into what Heaven\nhas conceal'd : To me, indeed, it feems it would be foj\nand therefore 'tis certainly befl to refrain thofe In-\nquiries.\nIn a word, the Apparition is, as I may fay, Ag-\ngrefTor 5 it appears 3 you are paffive 3 be fo ilill, other-\nwife you make your felf the Apparition, and put\nthe Apparition in your Place : ask it wherefore it\nappears to you, whether for Good or Evil 3 if for Evil,\ncall upon God for Prote6i:ion 3 if it comes for Good,\ndeclare your felf ready to receive its MefTage, and to\nobfcrte every juft Diredlion, to obey every righteous\nCommand, and attend to what it ihall fay.\nTiii.5\n\fof APPARITIONS. 341\nThis is to a6t fcarlefs, and yet cautious j bold,\nand yet wifely 5 refolv'djand yet humble 5 and in this\nTemper of Mind, I think no Man need to be a-\nfraid of an Apparition.\nYou may refolve all fuch things into this j Whe-\nther they are good Spirits or;bad, Angelick Ap-\npearances or Diabolickj they are under fuperior Li-\nmitations : the Denjil we know is chain'd, he can\ngo no farther than the length of his Tether 5 he\nhas not a Hand to a\u00a3l:, or a Foot to walk, or a\nMouth to fpeak, but as he is permitted. The Cafe\nof Jj^is Commiffion to Joh is explicit-, fuch and fuch\nthings he might do, fuch he might not> even the\nLives of ^oh'% Children, and Cattle, and Servants\nwere given him 3 and, like a De^vil as he was, he\nwent to the full Extent of his Gommiffion^ he\nfpar'd not one of them that he could deftroy, but\nhe was forbid to touch the Life o^Joh^ and he did\nnot, he durft not, he could not kill him.\nI F then we are fure the Devil is retrained from\nhurting us, any other wife than he is dire6ted and\nlimited, we may be fure that good Spirits are; for x\ntheir Nature, their Bufinefs, their Defires are all\nfix'd in a general Beneficence to Mankind 5 their\nPowers and Employments, as far as they are con-\ncerned among us, and in things upon this Surface,\nare included in the heavenly Acclamation when\nthe Angels fung to the Shepherds, On Earth Peace^\nGood-will towards Meri^ Luk-. ii. 14.\nIf at any time they are Meflengers of Judgment,\nExecutors of the divine Vengeance, it is hkewife\nby fpccial, nay, by extraordinary Commiflion; and\nthen they are indeed Flames of Fire, and pundlual^\nly do what they are commanded, and no more.\nBut even then, that we may be eafie in the\nmatter of Apparition, they do not difguife them-\nfelves or conceal their Commiffion : As Manoah's\nWife faid to him when the Angel appeared to her,\nz ? it\n\f34^ ^ \u2022^'^^ H^fi^^n ^^^ Reality\nif the LORD were pkafed to kill us^ he would not\nhave received a Burnt- offerings and a Meat-offering at\nour Hands^ neither would HE have fhewed us all thefe\nthings^ Judges xiii. z^. So here, the Apparition of a\ngood Spirit would not betray us, would not a6t by\nStratagem with us, would not appear in Peace when\nhe means War 5 come like a Friend, when he was\nfent for an Enemy -, give good Council, when he\nmeant Death and Deftru6tion; But if it appears\nin Peace, its Delign and its Meflage is certainly\nPeace,\nUpon the whole, you have no way any Oc-\ncafion to be difturbed at an Appearance, but to\nregard the Power fending, not the Agent fent 3\nlooking beyond the Apparition itfelf, and with a\nrefolved Mind, and a fteddy, calm Courage, fpeak\nto it, and demand its Bufinefsj I do not mean by De-\nmand, a Demand of Infult and Arrogance, but an\nhumble, yet refolved Enquiry, Why, and on what\nOccafion it comes to you.\nI H AVEdone counfelling.

Walking from\nthcBeginning to theEnd 5 Firfl, they got a fmall Rope,\nand tying one end of it to an old Chair which flood\nin an upper Room of the Houfe, (for they had\nfound means to get in and out of the Houfe at\npleafure) they brought the other end of the Rope\ndown on the Out-fide of the Houfe in a private\nPlace where it could not eafily be feen, and by\nthis they pulled the old Chair up, and then let it\nfall down again, and made a great Noife in the\nHoufe, fo as it might be eafily heard by the Neigh-\nbours 5 then other Boys of the fame Gang took care\nto call out to the old Women in the next Houfes,\nthat now they might hear the old Lady a playing\nher Pranks j and accordingly they would all ai-\nfemble in the Court-yard, where they could plainly\nhear it, but not one would venture to go up Stairs.\nIf any offered to go up a little way, then all was\nquiet again J but as foon as ever they retired, the\nrumbling would begin again : This was for the\nDay.\nIn\n\fof AP P A R IT 10 NS. 37J\nI N the Night, one of thefe unlucky Boys had\ngotten a dark Lanthorn, which was a thing the\nCountry People did not underftand, and with this\nhe walk'd all about the Orchard, and two or three\nClofcs near the Houfe, fometimes {hewing the Light\non this fide, and then his Comrades calling all the\nold Women about 'em to fee it, on a fudden the\nLight would go out, the Boy clofing up the Lan-\nthorn > and then he would run fwiftly crofs the whole\nField, and ihew his Light again on the other fide.\nNow he would be up in a Tree, then in the Road,\nthen upon the middle of the Heath 5 fo that the\nCountry People made no more Queftion, but that\nthe old Lady walk'd with a Candle in her Hand,\nthan that they faw the Light of it 3 and in a word,\nit pafs'd for an iVpparition as certainly as we on\nthe other hand knew what Knavery agitated it all.\nIt muftbe confefs'd that a dark Lanthorn, join'd\nwith an Enthufiaftick Head, might prevail to make\nfuch a Sham take, with weak and bigotted Peo-\nple, and they were mighty willing to fay before-\nhand that they were fure fomething walk'd.\nWhen they heard the Chair tumble about in\nthe Chamber, tho' pulled by a String and no body\nnear it, no nor in the whole Houfe, the People who\ncame together in the Court-yard, fancy'd often the\nfaw Heads of People moving up and down the\nRoom where the Noife was, and one faid pofitively\nfhe faw a white Head-drefs.\nBut to reali:^\u00a9 the Delufion, one cry'd our.\nThere's the Spirit, there's the Ghoft, juft at fuch a\nPlace of the Window j and affirm'd it flood clofe to\nthe Glafs, and defcrib'd it 5 another, as Moon-blind\nas her felf, fays^ Ay, fo it does, and points perem-\nptorily to the Place, declaring that fhe fees it plain-\nly i and thus they run away with it all together, that\nthe Ghoft walks and the Houfe is haunted, and for\na long time it is belicv'd no other 5 when he^c\nB b 4 was\n\fThe Hifiory mid Reality\nwas nothing but the mean

even with Mankind too,\nthat it is impoflible to beat it out of their Heads\n;\nand if they fhould fee any thing which they call\nan Apparition, they would to this Day follow it, in\nhope to hear it give a Stamp on the Ground, as\nwith its Foot, and then vaniflij and did it really do\nfo, they would not fail to dig to the Center (if they\nwere able) in hopes of finding a Pot of Money hi4\nthere, or fome old Urn with Afhes and Roman Me-\ndals 'y in ihort, or fome confiderable Treafure.\nA COUNTRY Gentleman had an old-built Houfe,\nwhich was the Remains of an old Demolifhed Mo-\nmftery or Religious Houfe, and he refolvcd to have\nit pull'd dov^n, but thought the Charge too much\nto beftow i fo he bethought himfelf of a Stratagem,\nwhich was to give it out that the Houfe was haunt-\ned, and this he did fo artificially, that it began to\nbe currently believed > for he made a Fellow drefs\nhimfelf up in White, and pafs fwiftly crofs the inner\nCourt of the Houfe, juft at a time when he had\nappointed others to be at the Window to fee it.\nThey gave Notice to the Houfe that there was\nan Apparition > then the Mafter and Miftrefs and all the\nFamily were called up to the Window, where, tho'\nit was fo dark that they could not diflinguilh what\nhe was, yet they plainly faw the thing in white\ngo crofs the Yard, and in. at a Door of the old\nBuilding 3 foon after it was in they perceiv'd\na Flafh of Fire in the Houfe, which was contriv'4\nthat the Fellow fhould make with fome Brimflone\nand other Materials on purpofe, fo that it fhould\nleave a Stench of Sulphur behind it, but not be juft\nthe Smell of Gunpowder,\nAs\n\fof APPARITIONS. J77\nA s he expefbed, it began to work > fome fanciful\nPeople having notice of it, and being defirous to\nfee the fame Apparition, had the occafion ofFer'd\nthem, and faw it in its ufual manner of {howing ic\nfelfJ its frequent walking was ordinary, at one pare\nof the Houfe where the Spirit had an opportunity\nto flip out at a Door into another Yard, and fointo\nthe dwelling Houfe 5 and when it went off that\nway it gave a great flamp with its Foot, and im-\nmediately it was gone.\nUpon this it was prefently faid there was Mo-\nney hid, and the Gentleman gave it out that he\nwould dig there for it, and mighty eager People\nwere to have it done j however the Gentleman\nfeem'd to cool in the matter: ftill the Apparition\nwas feen to come and go, walk to and again, almofl;\nevery Night, and ordinarily it vaniOi'd in a flaih of\nFire as above, which in a word was very extraor-\ndinary.\n;; At length fome of the Towns People in the\nVillage adjoyning, finding the Gentleman began to\nflight or negleft it, gave out, that if Efquire\nwould give them leave, they would dig, for that\ncertainly Money was hid there 3 nay if he would\nconfent they fhould have it if they found it, they\nwould dig for it and find it too, tho' they digged\nthe whole Houfe do.wn.\nThe Gentleman reply'd, that was not fair for\nthem to pull his Houfe down and have all they\nfound too, that was too hard; but he would con-\nfent to this, That provided they would carry\naway all the Rubbifh, and all the Materials which\nthey dug down, and pile up the Bricks and Timber\nin the Yard near the Houfe, and would be content\nwith half they found, he would give them leave\nto dig,\n: Well, they confented, and to work they\nWenti the Spirit or Apparition which appear'd at\nV ^ firll\n\f^jS The Hiftory and Reality\nfirft feem'd to point out the Place, and the firft\nthing they took down was a great ftack of Chim-\nnies, and a heavy piece of work it was 5 but the\nGentlemajijwilling to encourage them, fecretly hid\nfeven and twenty Pieces of old Gold in a hole in\nthe Chimney, which had no entrance into it but\nby one paflage, which he Brick'd up.\nWhen they came to this Money they were\nperfeftly deluded, and out of their Wits 5 the Gen-\ntleman happen'd to be near, but not juft upon the\nSpot when it was found, and he being call'd, very\nfrankly gave it them all j but upon Condition they\nfliould not expert the like, if they found any more.\nI N a word,this Bite made the Country Fellows work\nlike Horfes, and more came into the knot j but that\nwhich encourag'd them farther was, they did really\nlind feveral things of Value in the pulling down the\nHoufe, which perhaps had lain hid from the time\nof Demolifliing it as a religious Houfej and fomc\nMoney was found tooj but continual expectation\nand hope of finding more fo animated the Fellows,\nthat in fliort they pull'd the whole Houfe down 5\nnay, I might fay they puU'd it up by the Roots,\nfor they dug up the very Foundations, which was\nwhat the Gentleman defir'd, [and would have given\na great deal of Money to have had done.\nNor did they leave the Houfe in a heap of\nRubbifh 'y but, according to his Agreement with\nthem, they carried the Materials away, and fet up\nthe Timber and old Bricks in an adjacent Yard as\nhe directed them, and in good order too.\nSo violent was the Perfuafion, that (upon this\nfancy'd Apparition walking in the Houfe) Money\nwas hid there, that nothing could flop the eager-\nnefs of the Country People in working j as if the\nSouls of the old Nuns or Friars, or whatever they\nwere who had hid any Treafure there, fuppofing\nany was hid, could not be at Reft, as was faid in\nother\n\fof APPARITIONS. 379\nOther Cafes, or could be any way concerned for the\nfinding it fo many Years afterward, being almolt\ntwo hundred Years.\nI F they could fuppofe any thing fo'weak, where\nmuft they fuppofe thofe Departed Souls or Ghofts\ncould have been, during all that time? and why did\nthey not appear before? what had all the Ages be-\ntween done to be fo much leis in their Favour, that\nthey did not come to difcover this Money to\nthem ? but that the Depofit fhould remain untr\nGround fo long, without any enquiry after t,\n'till this Age, not at all more worthy than their\nAnceftors, ihould be inform'd of it.\nThere is not a thing in Nature fo generally\nreceiv'd, which has fo little Foundation, either in\nReafon or Religion, either in Nature or common\nSenfe j it feems not only abfurd, but ridiculous j\nthere is not only no religious Reafon in it, but it\nis inconfiftent with it felt : what feems only won-\nderful and unaccountable in it is, that fuch grols\nthings fliould make fuch Impreflions, and that it\nfhould be fo impofEble to beat it out of the Heads\nof the poflefs'd People.\nIf you ihould offer to tell them that no hidden\nMoney was ever thus difcover'd, they would laugh\nat it as the greateft Jeft imaginable, and tell you\nthere were five hundred Examples to the contrary 5\nand yet in all my Search after thofe things, and after\nevidence of Faft, I cannot arrive to one Example,\nwhere ever an Apparition directed to the finding\nMoney hid in the Ground or Earth, or any other\nplace, and that any Authentick Voucher has been\nbrought to prove it. I know there have been many,\nperhaps thoufand9,of fuch Stories told, and the Parti-\nculars are handed down with them j but I fay I never\nmet with any Authentick Proof of the Fad, fuch\nas that the Story might be told after them for Truth,\nand that a Man might fay without Blufhing that he\nbeliev'd\n\fThe Hiftory and Reality\nbeliev'd it. And let us but enter a little into the\nufual manner in which thofe Tales are related,\nthere feems to be fomething fo weak and filly in\nthe telling, as if it was only calculated for Children\nand Chimney corners : for Example j the Apparition\nis caird a Ghoft, 'tis drefs'd up (to fuit the weak-\nT\\t^s of the Imagination) in a Shrowd, as if it came\njuft out of the Coffin and the Church-yard, and as\nif the Habit of the Dead was afTum'd^to pofTefs the\nPeople with the Fancy of its being really the dead\nBody of the Perfon, and yet allow it at the fame\ntime to be a Spirit.\nWell, when it comes, and (be it what you\nwill) forms it felf in Apparition, all in white, and\nin a Shroud J what is next? it fays nothing to you,\nbut goes away before you > and perhaps fpeaks and\nbids you go or come along with it, or perhaps\nwithout fpeaking at all, leading and beckoning the\nParties they have appeared to, to follow them, and\nthen flamping with the Foot it difappears at\nonce.\nThis Stamp with the Foot is reckon'd to be a\nDire6tion to you to dig juft there, in order to find\nfome extraordinary Treafure j and he would be\nreckon'd very ftupid and fordidly dull that fhould\nnegle6b the Dire6tion, and not dig there'j and many\na vain and fruitlefs Pit has been dug on fuch occa-\u00ab\niions, to no purpofe at all.\nBut that I may not declare my Infidelity in\nthefe things in an unreafonable manner, and disbe-\nlieve without any jufl Reafon ; let me give you a\nlong Story, which feems to be left upon Record, of\na Pedlar in the Town of in Suffolk^ a\nStory believ'd as certainly as the Gofpel jand which\nit would be thought very abfurd for any one ta\nqueftion the Truth of.\nThere was a Pedlar, fays the Story ^ who us'd\nto travel about the Country with his Pack, but\n\fof APP ARiriO NS. 381\nkept a Chamber or Ware-houfe in the Market-\nTown for the depofiting and laying up fome Goods\nwhich he had there, and which were too many at\na time to carry them all about with him.\nI T happened that this Man having been abroad\nlate, and coming home with his Pack, fat himfelf\ndown upon a Stile, refting his Pack at the fame\ntime for his Eafe: while he fat here, there came up\nto him a Ghoft, in the Appearance of a Woman\ndrefs'd as above j fhe came up to him with a fmiling\nCountenance, and when flie difcover'd her felf fhe\nilept backward, and holding up a fine white Hand\nbeckoned to hifti with a Finger to follow her.\nThe Pedlar, frighted as he was, immediately\nfoUow'd the Apparition 5 (what he did in the mean\ntime with his Pack that's a gap in the Story, which\nTradition has not fupply'd 5) the Apparition leads'\nhim in this manner, going backward and beckon^\ning with her Hand over two or three Fields, 'till ic\ncame to a particular place, where there lay a great\nScone, and there giving a ftamp with its Foot ic\nvanifhed.\nThe Man takes the hint, marks the Stone,\ngoes home to carry his Pack, as we ought to fup-\npofe, and comes out the next Night with a Spade\nand a Pick Axe, and goes to work to dig a great\nPitt in the Earth.\nH E had not dug far ic'fcems, (tho' the Story does\nnot fay exprefly how far) but he found a large\nCheft 5 I fay large, for it could not be a fmall one,\nby what you fhall hear prcfently.\nHe doubled his Diligence when he came to the\nCheft, and with great Labour at length got it out\nof the place J and we may fuppofe was not long be-\nfore he found means to fplit it open, and get into\nthe infide of it to fee the Contents j for he foun4\nit very heavy when he kbour'd to get it out.\nIn\n\fj8z The Hifiory and Reality\nI N a word, he found the Cheft full of Silver,\nthat is to fay, full of Money j then keeping his\nown Council, he took care to depofite it fo, that\nby fome and fomc he got the Money all fafe home,\nand after that carried the Cheft home alfo.\nWH A T the Sum was that he found here,the Story\nis not particular in> but it feems the bulk was fuch,\nthat the Pedlar thought fit to leave off his travel-\nling about the Country as a Pedlar, takes a Houfc\nin the Town, furnifhes himfelf a Shop,and becomes\na fettled Inhabitant and Shop-keeper. During his\nappearing in this Figure,it happen'd that the Parifli\nChurch being exceeding old and out of Repair, the\nPariihioners, (whether by order ofthe Diocefan up-\non a Vifitation, or by the voluntary aft and deed of\nthemfelves the Pariihioners,! know not,) refolv'd to\nRepair the Church.\n1 N order to furnifh the needful Sums for this\ngood Work, they call a Veftry, and propofe a Sub-\nfcription of the Inhabitants, for fupporting the Ex-\npence 5 fo the Minifter and Church-Wardens go\nabout from Houfe to Houfe to fee what the Chari-\ntable Parifliioners would contribute, and among the\nreft they at length came to the Pedlar's (now Shop-\nkeeper's) Houfe, and he being told their Bufinefs\ndefires them to walk in.\nAfter fome Difcourfe, and perhaps treating\nhis Neighbours, he asks for their Roll or Subfcrip-\ntion Paper, in order to fubfcribej looking over the\nRoll he fees Sir nomas \u2014\u2014 five Pounds, another\nGentleman five Pounds, another ten Pounds, another\nforty Shillings,and fo on : Come,fays he, give a poor\nPedlar the Pen and Inkj Will your Gentry fub-\nfcribe no more than that ? fo he takes the Pen, and\nfubfcribes five and twenty Pounds.\nSome time after this, having Occafion to make\na Hatch to his Shop-Door, as in the Country is\nvery frequent, it happen'd, that fending for a Work-\nf man\n\fof AP P ARITIO NS. 3SJ\nman to make this Hatch, and looking about among\nhis old Lumber, he found nothing fo proper as the\nold Cheft that the Money was found in, and ac-\ncordingly a Hatch was made of it.\nA-w H I L E after this, as the Pedkr was fitting\nin his Shop, he obferv'd an Ancient Gentleman\nwho liv'd in the Town, and who had the Reputa-\ntion of a Scholar, and particularly of a great Anti-\nquary, flood poring very carneftly, with his Spefta-\ncles on, upon his new Hatch: This brought the\nPedlar to the Door, who after waiting a good\nwhile to fee what it was the old Gentleman had\ndifcover'd, at laft he ask'd him what it was he\nfound upon his new Hatch,that was worth fo much\nof his notice.\nTruly Neighbour, fays the Gentleman^ whan\nI obfervc is very remarkable, tho' I cannot tell the\nMeaning of it 3 and I fuppofe 'tis in a Charaftcr\nthat you cannot eafily read, as well as in a Lan-\nguage that you may not underftand.\nThe Pedlar defir'd he would read it to him.\nWhy, fays the Gentleman^ you do not underftand\nit, when I have read it.\nBut Sir, fays the Pedlarj can you not tell the\nmeaning of it in Englijh ?\nWhy, fays the old Gentleman^ it is the 'old Saxon\nEnglijh in the ancient Gothic Chara6ter, and it may-\nbe read thus,\nWhere Ithis ence flood\nStands another twice as gsod.\nHum! fays the Pedlar^ that's old ftufF indeed:\nwhat can that fignify ?\nNay, fays the old Gentleman^ that I don't know,\nfor who can tell where this ftood ?\nA Y, who indeed ? fays the Pedlar : and if they\ndid, what can there be in that ?\nThey\n\f384 7^^ Htfiory and Realty\nThey had a little more Chat of that kind 5 but\nin fliort the Pedlar got rid of his old Gentleman as\nfoon as he could, and began to ruminate upon the\nthing 5 where this flood ! Why I know well enough,\nfays he to himfelf^ where this flood > I mufl go and\nice, it may be there is fome more of the fame.\nBut then he argued, why this is fo many Years\nago {^i-ii or feven at lead, it feems) and if it was ar\nGhoft or Spirit that fhow'd me the way to it, t\nwarrant fhe has ihow'd fome body elfe the way to\nthe reft; Indeed I did not defervc it, that I did noc\nlook farther when I was at it 5 to befure it's gone\nby this time.\nThus he argued himfelf almoft out of the\nthing again, 'till at length he told his Wife of it,\n^\nwho it feems had been in the Secret before.\nWhy, you are mad, P^ysjhe^ why don't you go'\nimmediately to the place?\nNay, fays he^ 1 don't know whether I can find\nit again or no, now.\nWhat, fays his Wife^ mufl: the Devil come to\nihow it you again ? fure you an't fo dull, but you\nmay find it again.\nWell, the Man went however 5 indeed his\nWife drove him out almofl:, Go, try, fays fhe^ you\ncan but come without it.\nH E goes, and found the place in general, but\ncould not difl:inguilh the particular Spot, which\nwas levell'd partly by himfelf when he fiU'd up the\nHole again, and partly grown up with Grafs and\nWeeds 5 fo he comes back again, and tells his Wife,\nhe could not tell which was the Place, fo as to be\nparticular enough to go to Work\nWell, fays his Wife^ go in the Night; I war-\nrant you the good Devil that fhow'd you the firfl\nwill put you in fome way to find the reft, if there\nis any more.\nSo\n\fof APPARITIONS. 38J\nSo prevail'd with by his Wife's Importunity\naway he went, and I think they fay his Wife went\nwith him 5 being come to the Place, the Ap-\nparition appeared to them again, and lliow'd them,\nin the fame manner as before, the very Spot} and\nthen vaniih'd.\nf N fhort, the Man went to work, and digging\na little deeper than he did before, he found ano-\nther Cheft or Coffer, bounded about with Iron, not\nfo big as the other, but richer 5 for as the firft was\nfull of Silver, fo this was full of Gold.\nThey carry'dit home with Joy enough, as you\nRiay fuppofe, and opening it, found (as above) a very\ngreat Treafure. Fame has not handed down the\nSum 5 but fomething may be guefs'd at by the latter\npart of the Story, which is told thus.\nI T feems that all this while the Repair of the\nChurch (mention'd above) went on but flowly 5 ac-\ncording to the old Saying, it was Church-TVork-y and\na Veftry being call'd upon fome other Church-\nwork, the Pexilar, who was prefent among the reft\nof his Neighbours, took occafion to complain, that\nhe thought that Bufinefs was not honeftly manag'd,\nthat it was indeed like Church-Work^ carried on\nheavily.\nSome of the Gentlemen took him up a little,\nand told him, he took too much upon him 5 that ic\nwas none of his Affair 5 that he was not in\nTruft for the Workj that they to whom it was\ncommitted knew their Bufinefs, and that he fhould\nlet it alone, and mind his Shop.\nHe anfwer'd, it was true, that he was not trud-\ncd with it, if he had, it fhould have been finifhed\nbefore now 5 and that he had a right to complain,\nbecaufe he paid to it as well as other People} ad-\nding, that if they did not difpatch, he would com-\nplain to the Biiliop, and obtain anqther Vifitation*\nC c T H I \u00a7\n\f3 8^ - The Htjlory and Reality\nThis alarm'd the People entrufted, fo they\ngave him good Words, and told him, the truth\nwas, the Parifh Stock was almoft gone, and that\nthey had not Money to go on, 'till' the Gentlemen\nwould come into a fecond Colleftion.\nSay youfo? fays the Pedlar j there maybe fome\nReafon in thatj you can't go on indeed without\nMoneys but pray how much do you want?\nThey told him it would coft near two hundred\nPounds more to finilh it, and do but indifferently\nneither > for the Roof wanted to be taken off, and\nthey feared the Timber was rotten, and would require\nfo much Addition, they were afraid to look into it.\nIn a word, he bid the Church-wardens call a\nVeftry upon that particular Affair, and he would\nput them in a way to finiih it.\nA Vestry was call'dj the Pedlar told them,\nthat feemg they were poor, and could not raife\nMoney to go on with it, they fhould leave it to\nhim, and he would finiih it for them.\nAccordingly he took the Work upon\nhimfelf, laid out near a Thoufand Pounds, and al-\nmoft new-built the Church 5 in Memory of which,\non the Glafs-windows, there ftand the Figures of\nthe Pedlar and his Pack, and (as the People fancy)\nthere is alfo the Apparition beckoning to him, to\ncome to the Place where he dug up the Money.\nThus far the Story. How Tradition came to\nhand it down to us in this manner, and fo turn it\ninto a Fable, I have nothing to do with 5 but the real\nand more probable Part of the Tale is recorded thus.\nThat there was a Pether^ fo the old Englijh\ncalls him, that is a Pedlar^ who having long ufed\nto travel up and down the Country with his\nHorfe, and his Wife, and himfelf, all three loaded\nwith their Goods, and going from Houfe to Houfe\nfor many Years, was grown rich, by hislnduftryj\nand that being too old to continue the laborious\nPart,\n\fof APPARITIONS.\nPart, betook a Lodgings firftin the Town, and fold\nhis Goods in a Chamber^ and in the Markets only^\nbut afterward took a Houfe and a Shop in the Mar-\nket-place, and drove a great Trade.\nThat growing thus to be very rich, he con-\ntributed, upon their firft coming about for a Sub-\nfcription, twenty five Pounds towards the Repair\nof the Church j and after that, finding they want-\ned Money to finifli it, took the Work wholly in-\nto his own Hand, and finifh'd the Church at his\nown Charge} and that the Parifh, in Gratitude to\nhis Memory, caufed that Figure of the Pedlar to be\npainted upon the Glafs, where the Pedlar and his\nI?ack is reprefented in one Place travelling about\nthe Country, by which he got his Living*\nIn another Place, there are Workmen digging\nthe Foundation of the Church, and the Pedlar\ngiving them Dire&ions what to do, and how to\nproceed J and in another, the Church is built up a\ngreat way, and almoft to the Roof, and the Pedlar\nitill direding.\nI N another Place^ an Angel is painted {landing\nby the Pedlar, and pointing with a Rod or Staff in\nhis Hand, to a Place where the Pedlar fets two\nWorkmen to dig.\nNow from the Pedlar's being grown fo unex-\npe&dly rich, common Fame it feems raifed a Re^\nport, that he had found a Cheft of Money in the\nGround, and after that another. It feems alfo^\nthere is an Original for the two Verfes too, which\nis thus : when the Pedlar had firft contributed\ntwenty five Pounds towards building the Church,\nand yet the Parifhoners told him, they could not\ngo on for want of Moneys he told them they\nihould not be difcouraged, he had given them one\nBag of Money, and, fays he, where that ftood^ ftands\nanother twice as good: Til do it my felf.\nOca Hence\n\f388 The Hijlory and Reality\nHence they thought the Pedlar mufl: certainly\nhave found fome Money that had been hid in the\nGround, and that the Devil had difcover'd it to\nhim 5 and To came the whole Story to grow up by\nlittle and little into the Form as i have told it-, and\nnow to confirm it farther, they tell us the Angel,\nwhich perhaps might be but indifferently painted\non the Glafs, or on the Wall of the Church, is\ntaken for the Ghofl that difcover'd the two Chefts\nof Money to the Pedlar, and is ihowing where to\ndig for it.\nThus the Story of an Apparition is handed on\nto Pofterity, and now 'tis as currently believ'd in\nthe Country, almofl as the Gofpel> and any Man\nwould be thought very bold, that fhould pretend\nto contradi6t it, or to fay that it is not true in e-\nvery Particular.\nIf all the Stories of Apparitions leading Peo-\nple to dig for Money, were as well trac'd as this, I\nbelieve they might be found as plainly fi6bitious. In-\nvention has been mighty fruitful upon this particu-\nlar kind of Notion, that when Money is hidden\nfome Spirit or Apparition will difcover it j as if the\nSouls of thofe that hid the Money were difturb'd,\n'till it was found out and made ufe of.\nHow abfurd the very Suggeflion it felfis, I can\nhardly think worth while to fpeak of again j but\nthere are other DifHculties in it alfo, if an Appari-\ntion knows of and difcovers this Money.\n1. Why not difcover it fooner? Why let it He\nin the Ground, fometimes two or three hundred\nYears before it has been difcover'd? and then an\nApparition comes, from none knows where, to bring\nit to light.\n2. Why is the Difcovery made to a Stranger,\nand not to fome of the Line or Race of thofe to\nwhom the Money did at firft belong.'^ One would\nfuppofe the Apparition came^ or was fent, or di-\nvc&cd\n\fof APPARITIONS. 38p\nrecbed to come, todo Juftice^and to give the Money\nloft to the right Owner 5 whereas thefc Difcoveries\nare often pretended to be made to Strangers, who\nhave no Claim or any Right to it, or any Relation\nto thofe who laid it there 5 and this indeed is unac-\ncountable, and makes the reft of the Story impro-\nbable to be true.\n3. If Ghofts, or Apparitions, and Spirits, or call\nthem what you will, are thus officious, and bufy to\ndifcover Money hid in the Earth, fo as to run up\nand down to Strangers, who are no way related to\nit, or to the Race or Families who were firft\nconcern'd in it> Why then do they not difcover\nall the Money that is thus depofited* in the Dark ?\nand which no doubt is yet in great Qi-iantities,\nlodged out of the Reach of Mortal Sight, and of\nwhich we find frequent Difcoveries made 5 as par-\nticularly a great Parcel of old Gold, found lately in\nthe digging up the old Foundation of a Houfe in\nOxfordjhire. A great Parcel of Roman Gold Coin\nand Medals found this very Year, in digging up an\nold Vault in France^ and which muft have lain there\na thoufand Years at leaft, and no kind Apparition\ncame to difcover it in fo long time.\nMany fuch Examples are daily fhown us of*\nMoney found Under-ground, without the Help of\nthe Devil^ or of any Apparition, Spirit or Ghoft,\nto difcover it, and which had lain, ever fince the\nTime of the Romans^ conceal'd and unknown.\nF ROM all which Reafons I muft conclude, that\nthe departed Spirits know nothing of thefe things,\nthat it is not in their Power to difcover their old\nHoards of Money, or to come hither to {how us\nhow we may come at it 3 but that in fhort, all the old\nWomen's Stories, which we have told us upon\n'\nthat Subjed, are indeed old Women's Stories, and\nno more.\n\f3^0 The Htfiory and Reality\nI CANNOT* quit this part of my Subjefl: with-\nout obferving that, indeed, if we give up all the\nStones of Ghofts and Apparitions, and Spirits walk-\ning, to difcover Money that is hid, we Ihall lofc\nto the Age half the good old Tales, which ferve\nto make up Winter Evening Converfarion^ and fhall\ndeprive the Do6i:rine of Souls departed coming\nback hither to talk with us about fuch things, of its\nprincipal Support j for this indeed is one of the\nprincipal Errands fuch Apparitions come about.\nIt is without Doubt, that Fancy and Imagina-\ntion form a world of Apparitions in the Minds of\nMen and Women j (For we mufl: not exclude the\nLadies in this Part, whatever we do) and People go\naway as thoroughly poflcfs'd with the Reality of\nhaving feen the Devil^ as if they conversed Face to\nFace with him> when in fhort the Matter is no\nmore than a Vapour of the Brain, a fick delirious\nfume of Smoke in the Hypochondria; forming ic\nfelf in fuch and fuch Figure to the Eye- fight of the\nMind, as well as of the Head, which all look'd upon\nwith a calm Revilion, would appear, as it really is,\nnothing but a Nothing, a Skeleton of the Brain,\na Whymfy, and no more.\nSo Hypochondriack Tapours reprefent\nShipSj ^rmies^ Battels^ in the Firmament\n:\nTill fteddy Sight the Exhalation folves,\njlnd all to its firft Matter Cloud dijfolves.\nI T is out of Queftion that the Imagination forms\na great many of thefc Vifions in the Heads of the\nPeople that rekte them again to us 5 and they as\nfirmly believe them to be real Apparitions, as I be-\nlieve them to be nothing but Vapours and Cloud*\nBut on the other hand it cannot be deny'd, but that\nthere is a itrange Forwardnefs among our People\nto\n\fof APPAR ITIO NS. 3pr\nto propagate, nay, to raife and invent fuch Stories\nof Apparitions and Vifions j to furnifh them ouc\nwith popular Circumftances, and to fprcad them as\nRealities, meerly and on purpofe to form a plau-\nfible Relation j and perhaps lome, according to\nCuftom, fall into that old School-boy's Error, of\ntelling the Tale over fo often, 'till they believe it\nto be Truth.\nBut all this Fiftion and Fable, of which the\nWorld is fo full, does not at all lefTen the folid\nPart which I firll advanced, and Hill infift upon,\nn:iz. The Reality of Apparition in general j for\nthe fruitfulnefs of other Mens Imagination in coin-\ning of Falfhood, does not at all leflen the Validity\nof a Truth which the Lie is made to Mimick and\nCounterfeit.\nWe have had a world of Tales impos'd upon\nthe World about Apparitions fhevving themfelves\nto abundance of People, before^ at^ and after the late\nMaflacre in Ireland^ Ann. 1641, and it would fill\nup a Volume of itfelf to give an Account of them >\nnor is it poffible to diiUnguilli between thofe of\nthem that are Real, and thofe that were Imagina-\nry, efpecially at this Dillance of Timej but if I\nmay believe the Report of thofe that were upon\nthe Spot, and of others who rcceiv'd the Accounts\nfrom the moft Judicious and mod Confidering of\nthofe who were upon the Spot, the Fears and\nApprehenfions of the People, efpecially in Dublin^\nwhere they expe6i:ed the Murtherers would break\nin upon them ev^ery Day, fiU'd them with Dream\nand Phantofm, Vifion and Apparition, when indeed\nthere was nothing in it but their own dreadful Ap-\nprehenfioqs.\nNor could they be fo much blam'd as in other\nCafes, for here were People efcap'd from the Mur-\ntherers, even out of their very Hands > fome that\nhad feen their Wives, Children^, Fathers, Mothers,\nHusbandS|\n\f391 The Hifiory and Reality\nHusbands, Neighbours butcher'd before their Fa-\nces 5 and no Wonder if thefe had the Images of\nDeath before their Eyes, after they arriv'd5 no\nWonder if they had Apparitions and Vifions of the\nlike Mifchiefs every Hour.\nN o Wonder if they faw Clouds o? Irijh Armies in\nthe Air, heard Shrieks of dying murther'd Women\nand Children, and that they vouch'd thefe things\nwith the utmoft Solemnity, Now 'tis true in the\ncommon Notions of Humanity, one cou'd not but\npity thofe poor People, and give allowance to\ntheir Fears, and to the Fright and Horrors that\nwere upon their Minds 5 yet it does not at all fol^\nlow that we, who are not under the fame Impref-\nflons, muft come into the Delufion with them,\ngive up our Underftanding and our Reafon to their\nimagined Viiions.\nWe are to judge of thofe things by the Rules by\nwhich we ought to judge in like Cafes, and after\nyou have made Allowances for the Terrors and\nFright which the poor People might be in then,\nwe fhould confider the rational Parr, for where\nthe Apparition is real, the Rational Part is always\napparent as well as the Vifionary Part : for Exam-\nple,\nWhat Apparitions came from a good Hand,\nand for the good of the innocent People, whofc\nDangers were fo imminent, would certainly come\nin fome Space of Time before the Danger, either\nfo as to give Opportunity of Efcape, or at leaft\nPreparatory Warnings, that the People might have\ntime to look up to Heaven, which the butchering\nEnemy would not fpare theni; and fuch Appariti-\nons as thefe I fhould be inclined to give the moft\nHeed to 'y but of thefe we read of very few.\nO N the other hand, to what Purpofe could Ap-\nparitions fhow themfelves afterward? and from\nwhom did they come?

Why did they not\nHaunt the Murtherers in a moft frightful manner,\nand terrify them Night and Day, 'till they brought\ntheir own Guilt to be the worfl of Apparitions\nto them ?\nWhy did not the Terror of Blood lie upon\nthem, like a conftant Devil harrafling their Souls,\nand terrifying them 'till they were made their own\nExecutioners?

But this no ways Im-\npeaches the main Proportion, viz.
