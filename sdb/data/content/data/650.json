The inclusion of \"American\" in the title was to distinguish it from the Phrenological Journal published in Edinburgh and the title showed both the journal's recognition of its roots in European (primarily British) phrenology and its conscious attempt to distinguish its own more popular version of the new science from the more \"scientific\" and medical views of phrenology prevalent in Britain.\n\n The journal was originally published for anonymous proprietors in Philadelphia, who were soon revealed as O.S. and L.N. Fowler.  The \"Phrenological Fowlers\" were the product of a fad for phrenology among the students of Amherst College in the early 1830s.  Orson Squire Fowler (1809-1887) borrowed George Combe's Elements of Phrenology (1824) from his classmate Henry Ward Beecher, learned the science and devised a practical, easily understood method of delineations and a simplified chart of faculties, and went on the road to lecture and delineate to eager crowds while awaiting his entry into the seminary.  His success prompted his younger brother Lorenzo Niles (1811-1896) to join the business and the brothers, aided by their sister Charlotte (1814-1901), opened offices in New York and then in Philadelphia, where the journal was started.  In 1841, O.S. became sole owner and editor and moved the journal to New York.  In 1843 they were joined by Samuel R. Wells (1820-1875), a student of the Fowlers, who with them started Fowlers & Wells in 1846.  This became Fowler & Wells after the retirement of O.S. in 1855, and thereafter Wells was publisher under his own imprint until after his death in 1875 when his widow, Charlotte, at first under her own name and then as Fowler & Wells, became proprietor and Drayton and Sizer editors.  LN left for Britain in 1860 where he established L.N. Fowler & Co. in London and, in 1880, started the Phrenological Magazine, which was consolidated with this journal in 1897.  His daughter Jessie Allen Fowler first edited the Phrenological Magazine and then, beginning in 1896, helped edit this journal.  As of January 1, 1896, the American Phrenological Journal (then called The journal announced that Edgar C. Beall and Colonel Nat Ward Fitz-Gerald of West Virginia had bought control of Fowler & Wells, with the announced purpose of increasing circulation of the journal to 100,000 and re-invigorating it generally.  Beall took over editing the journal.  He was later editor of Vim magazine, president of the New York College of Phrenophysics and proponent of Sexual Science.\n\n The Fowlers were reformers to the bone, advocates of woman suffrage, temperance, the water cure, anti-slavery (despite the inherent racialist tendencies in the new science that characterized intelligence and virtue in decidedly Northern European terms).  Phrenology, despite the seeming determinism of its fundamental belief in a physical basis for character and behavior, easily provided a foundation for free will and personal development through the careful development of certain faculties and the repression of others under the guidance of phrenology.  This was exemplified by O.S. Fowler's Self-Culture and Perfection of Character (1847) and a variety of books on self-help, general life advice (Wells' Wedlock, 1870, for example), etc.  For years the masthead carried the engraving of a studious man in his cluttered study with an angel holding a crown of victory over his head.  As the fad for phrenology declined the journal easily moved to include fad foods (\"purified Solidified Cacao,\" etc.) and generally the \"Restoration of Health, on Hygienic Principles; Nature's Remedial Agencies are Light, Air, Temperature, Electricity, Diet, Bathing, Sleep, Exercises and Rest,\" and also drew within its compass physiognomy, magnetism, Delsartean Physical Culture, character reading, medical electricity, psychometry, clairvoyance, thought transference, Mental Science, etc.  Spiritualism, while not formally connected to phrenology, also found a place in the journal and Fowler & Wells and, especially, Wells (under his Samuel R. Wells imprint) were prominent publishers of spiritualist literature.\n\n The journal was profusely illustrated with drawings (replaced in later years by photographs) to illustrate phrenological types and examinations and every issue carried an extensive biography, with picture, of a prominent person, including John D. Rockefeller, Mary Baker Eddy, Annie Besant, Robert E. Lee, Bayard Taylor, and many more.   The journal carried phrenological contributions by a great variety of now unknown practitioners and theoreticians of the science but also carried contributions by the likes of Alexander Wilder (including children's fiction by him).  There were an enormous number of \"departments\" and columns on a variety of subjects, mostly of supposedly general interest  and intelligence (the migration of squirrels, the ethology of the Mormons, why do bald people disproportionately frequent churches, cures for near-sightedness, book reviews, etc.).  The journal carried advertisements from its earliest years, with the number increasing over time as the publishers realized that the profit in magazines was not in the subscriptions but in the advertisements, and offered impressive premiums to entice readers.  Prominent in the advertisements were their own American Phrenological Institute in New York (founded in 1866 by Wells, Horace Greeley, A. Oakley Hall, Russell T. Trail, et al.) and the Fowler Institute in London, which taught phrenology and supplied the literature and accoutrements helpful to the practice.  By the mid-1850s the journal claimed a circulation of 24,000.\n\n Beginning in 1839, the journal put out an annual almanac under a variety of names, collected here as Phrenological Almanac.\n\n NYPL; University of Michigan; Cornell University; University of Illinois; Harvard University; University of Minnesota, etc.      Issues:American Phrenological Journal V1 1839 American Phrenological Journal V2 1840 American Phrenological Journal V3 1841 American Phrenological Journal V4 1842 American Phrenological Journal V5 1843 American Phrenological Journal V7 1845 American Phrenological Journal V8 1846 American Phrenological Journal V9 1847  American Phrenological Journal V10 1848 American Phrenological Journal V11 1849 American Phrenological Journal V12 1850 American Phrenological Journal V13-14 1851 American Phrenological Journal V15-16 1852  American Phrenological Journal V25-26 1857 American Phrenological Journal V27-28 1858 American Phrenological Journal V29-30 1859  American Phrenological Journal V31-32 1860 American Phrenological Journal V33-34 1861 American Phrenological Journal V35-36 1862  Phrenological Journal V41-42 1865 Phrenological Journal V43-44 1866 Phrenological Journal V45-46 1867 Phrenological Journal V47-48 1868 Phrenological Journal V49 1869 Phrenological Journal V50-v51 1870 Phrenological Journal V52-53 1871 Phrenological Journal V54-55 1872 Phrenological Journal V56-57 1873 Phrenological Journal V58 Jan-Jun 1874 Phrenological Journal V60-61 1875 Phrenological Journal V62-63 1876 Phrenological Journal V64-65 1877 Phrenological Journal V66-67 1878 Phrenological Journal V68-69 1879 Phrenological Journal V70-71 1880 Phrenological Journal V72-73 1881 Phrenological Journal V74-75 1882 Phrenological Journal V76-77 1883 Phrenological Journal V78-79 1884 Phrenological Journal V80-81 1885 Phrenological Journal V82-83 1886 Phrenological Journal V84-85 1887 Phrenological Journal V86-87 1888 Phrenological Journal V88-89 1889 Phrenological Journal V89-90 1890 Phrenological Journal V92-93 1891 Phrenological Journal V94-95 1892 Phrenological Journal V96 1893 Phrenological Journal V97-98 1894 Phrenological Journal V99-100 1895  Phrenological Journal V101-102 1896 Phrenological Journal V103-104 1897 Phrenological Journal V105-106 1898 Phrenological Journal V107-108 1899 Phrenological Journal V109-110 1900 Phrenological Journal V111-112 1901 Phrenological Journal V113-114 1902 Phrenological Journal V115-116 1903 Phrenological Journal V117 1904 Phrenological Journal V118 1905 Phrenological Journal V119 1906 Phrenological Journal V120 1907 Phrenological Journal V121 1908 Phrenological Journal V122 1908 Phrenological Journal V123-124 1910-1911       <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/american_phrenological_journal","_id":650}
