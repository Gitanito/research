[Oct. 29,\nAnd. furthennore, I suggest that while we habitually use our ainiatro-\ncerebral character-centres with the same unconscious choice as leads us, for\ninstance, to catch a rope Hung at us with ollr right hand and not with\nour left, there are nevertheless certain statea-supemormal as well as ab-\nnonnal-in which our Ego (whatever that may be) expreaaea itself more\nreadily tlu-ough the dextro-cerebral centres, and aaaumea, therefore, a com-\nparatively savage character.\nH this be so, much light will be thrown on almost all that claaa of\nSpiritualistic manifestations which have been ascribed to diabolic agency.\nAnd if we are not ashamed of poaaesaing a digestive system which includes\nthe rudimentary \"vermifonn appendix,\"-a motor system which includes the\ncomparatively defective motor innervation of our left bands,-then surely\nwe need not be ashamed of poaaesaing an emotional and ideational system\nwhich includes dextro-cerebral elements some twenty generations or so in\narrear of the epoch to which our bmin, taken as a whole, entitles us to\nbelong. For those who believe that our evolution has no aaaignable limit,\nthere may even be something pleasing in such a token as this of the rapidity\nwith which we are mounting on the endless way.\nPROCEEDINGS O~' THE GENERAL MEETING ON\nSaturday, Jant14ry 2, 1886.\nThe eighteenth General Meeting of the Society was held at the\nRooms of the Society of British Artists, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, on\nSaturday, January 2, 1886.\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK, VICE-PRESIDENT, IN THE CHAIR.\nMr. E.
