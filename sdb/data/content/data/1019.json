(\"which\nis 16 Years hence,) -That is for certain fuppofed the\nBeginning of the Millennium, when the Jews will\nbe rdtored to their own Country, and rebuild their\nTemple upon the founding of the feventh Trumpet.\nA Trumpet is theSynlbol of War 5 and in the Re-\nvelations we find, that all the Seven Trumpets were\nto be attended with Woes and Lamentions $ Six of\nwhich are already paft, and the 7th which is yet t\u00ab\ncome, denoimceth tne third and kft Woe; under it\nthe Seven Vials of God's Wrath are to be poured our,\nboth upon the EalUrn and Wellern Antichnft, that is\nthe Turk and Po$e.

The kcond Vial poured upon the Sea, which\ne lays is the Papal Kingdom in its greateft Extent,\nhich will become as the Blood of a dead Man, lb\nat every Soul which liveth in it fhalj die^ for as\niili cannot live in Water turned into Blood, neither\nan Mankind any longer endure to live under the Yoke\n>f Poptlh Prieils and Governors.

The fifth Vial\nis\n\f*o Moore, 1750*\nis poured out upon the Seat of the Beafl, or the City\nof Rome, which predifcls her Deftruftion ; The Angel\nreprelents the Popes Kingdom as full of Darkneft, and\nhis Subje&s gnawing their Tongues thro' Difpair.\nThe fixth Vial is poured on the great River Euphratesf\nthat is, on the great Empire of the Turks and their\nReligion } after which there will be nothing to hinder\nthe Princes and People of the Eaft, who (hall be En*\nJightned or Converted $ or the Jews who are there\ndifperfed in great Numbers, from marching into the\nWeft to help on the Deftruftion of the Beafl. The\nfeventh and laft Vial is poured into the Air, and de-\nnotes the clearing of all places from the Darknefe and\nFog ofSuperftition and Antichriftianilm : after which\nwill be manifeft th* Myftery of God in reuniting all\nNations, and the Kingdoms of this World will be-\ncome the Kingdom of Righteoufheis.\nI have already oblerved, that the precife time when\nall thefe mighty Revolutions will happen is doubtful;\nhowever there is no doubt but we are arrived near to\nthe time of their Manifeftation ; and when the Scene\nof Affairs both in Afia and Europe will be very much\nchanged : Of this we are affured from computation\nof Scripture Prophecy, and the concurrent Teftimonies\nof the Sybils, and other Heathen Oracles 5 As alfo\nfrom lucn certain outward and vifible Signs which we\nknow were nearly to preceed that great Day. I will\ntell you very clearly, lays the Sybiline Oracles, the\nSigns whereby you may know when will be the End\nof all thefe things that lhall happen on the Earth,\nviz. when (the likends of) Swords lhall be feen in\nthe Heavens towards Sun-letting or Sun-riling, And\nthe Prophet Joel fays, ch. ii.ver. 50. the Lord will\nihew wonders in the Heavens, Blood and Fire and\nPillars of Smoke 5\nevery Body knows, that upon the\nfirft Appearance of the Northern Lights, they were\nby all forts 9f People compared to 6words, Lances,\nand other Military Weapons, or elfe to Blood, Fire,\nand Wllars of Smoke, in the very Expreflions of the\nProphet 3oel: And indeed they moft certainly do\ngreatly reiemble all thefe things $ and in fait are Fires\nand Pilhrs of Smoke or Vapour, which do frequently\nin\n\fMoore, 1750T 11\nin their Colour rcprefent Blood ; and by their Form\nand Motion, Swords, Lances, and other Military En-\nfigns : But thefe Appearances (as alfo Comets) you will\nfay, may be accounted for from natural Caufes;\nlow'd they may fo, yet as their Appearances are fb\nunivcrfal and uncommon (except of late YearsJ and\nare exaftly luch as we fee were to happen fbme fhort\ntime before the commencement of theft extraordinary\nRevolutions, preparatory to the Millennium, we may\nand ought to look upon them as ominous, and fent in\na peculiar and wonderful manner, to pr efage the\napproach of thofe wonderful and tremendious Times;\nLet us then, not be ignorant of the Signs of the Times,\nbutlook fuddenly for that great and fearful Earth-\nquake mentioned in the Revelations, for it wiil come\nand cannot be afar off} But I fear it is with us, as with\nthe Jews, when our Saviour came into the World ; or\nwith the Christians, when Antichrift ftept upon the\nStage; Chrift was both come and gone before the\nJews knew that he was the Meffias : and Antichrift\nwas grown old in the World, before the World took\nany notice of him 5 fo it may be that Antichrift is\ngoing apace to Perdition, before the People of God\nbegin to difcern it.\nObfervatims of the Four Quarters of the Tear.\nI.
