As photocopying became more available, the journal increasingly published copies of letters, newspaper articles,  and photographs.  It contained original articles on UFOs, interviews with authors and those who had seen (or been abducted by) the saucers, and promotion of various saucer-clubs and lectures.  This was the long running work of James Sylvester Rigberg, Ms.D., D.D. (1914- ), the head of the Flying Saucer News Club.  He ran a bookstore on Third Avenue and then on West 45th Street and Ninth Avenue, specializing in the occult and New Age, under the name The Flying Saucer Bookstore, which was run by Rigberg and his wife, Margaret.  The journal initially carried advertisements for Rigberg's own \"metaphysical\" books and poetry, and for a complete line of UFO books, but current New Age advertisements soon came to provide the majority of the journal: the Prophecies of Nostradamus, the Buddhist UFO Research Center (Sungma Tenzing Lama c\/o Dickhoff-Ufologist), the Hypno-Spiral Machine sold by Academy of Applied mental Sciences, the College of Divine Metaphysics in Indianapolis (degrees of Ps.D., Ms.D., and D.D. -- which may account for the degrees listed after Rigberg's name), \"Universal Psychic Science\" (half price certificates in scientific mediumship, spiritual healing, practical metaphysics, etc.), Grapho-Analysis, \"Lucky Lady Perfume (\"Helps to attract the one you want!\"), Robert Ernst Dickhoff, Ph.D., The Martian Alphabet and Language, \"Psychic Dominance,\" The Brotherhood of the White Temple (Doreal), \"Be Your Own Astrologer,\" \"Controlled Reincarnation\" (taught by the Druids in Wheatridge, Colorado), Egyptian Fortune Telling Cards (no sales tax), Hypnotism Revealed, Oahspe, The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ, and a complete line of \"Herbs, Oils, Powders, Curios, Candles, Incense, Planchettes, Ouija Boards, Crystal Balls,\" etc.  In its heyday the journal is said to have had a circulation of about 1,000.  To encourage distribution, Rigberg offered a free subscriptions to aliens -- who came in person to take him up on the offer.  Rigberg also published The International Flying Saucer Directory (1956).
