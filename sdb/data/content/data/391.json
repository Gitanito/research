RHINE'S RECENT EXPERIMENTS IN\r\nEXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION\"\r\nWILL BE READ BY\r\nPROFESSOR THOULESS\r\n2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\n[P. 305]. CASE\r\nA Premonition\r\nThe following dream, the report of which came to us through the\r\nPresident, Mrs Lyttelton, appears to he of the type discussed by\r\nMr J. W. Dunne in his well-known book An Experiment with Time,\r\nthat is to say, the subject matter of the dream is closely related to\r\nan incident which occurred shortly afterwards. In experiences of\r\nthis kind the possibility of chance-coincidence must always be\r\nreckoned with and this possibility cannot be exactly assessed in any\r\nindividual case ; the general lines upon which the evidence may be\r\nweighed are discussed by Mr H. F. Saltmarsh in his \" Report on\r\nCases of Apparent Precognition \" (Proc. S.P.R. XLII, p. 49). The\r\nnames of all the persons concerned are known to the Society, but,\r\nexcept in the case of Mr Miles, pseudonyms are given here.\r\nOn 12 June 1934 Mr W. C. Miles wrote to Mrs Lyttelton, reminding\r\nher that he had recently attended a lecture of hers in Oxford, and\r\nsuggesting that she might \" be interested in the enclosed account of a dream by a friend of mine. I have known both Miss Edge and\r\nMiss Swan for several months \". The enclosed statement, which is signed by Miss Edge, the dreamer, and also by Miss Swan and Mr\r\nMiles, is as follows : On the afternoon of Thursday, June 7th 1934 Miss Edge, after\r\nasking her friend, Miss Swan, to wake her at 4 o'clock, went to sleep\r\n(between 2 and 3 p.m.).\r\nMiss Sivan woke Miss Edge at about 4 o'clock (or just after). Miss\r\nEdge at once said that she had had a terrifying dream in which she\r\nhad been to a place where some one was being mauled by lions, and\r\nthat she herself had only just managed to climb to safety.\r\nMiss Swan, on hearing the details, said, \" You have been to the\r\nZoo \", meaning in the dream experience.\r\nMiss Edge had not been thinking of a Zoo or of animals just prior\r\nto the dream ; she had, however, been a little excited a day or two\r\npreviously, but the cause of the excitement had no reference to\r\nanimals.\r\nThe morning following the occurrence of the dream, and its communication to Miss Swan, the London papers contained accounts\r\nof the mauling of a man by lions at Whipsnade.\r\nThis statement is dated'\" Oxford, June 12, 1934 \". From the detailed report of the inquest, which appeared in The\r\nTimes, it would seem that Stenson, the man who was killed, got\r\ninto conversation with a visitor to the Whipsnade Zoo, named\r\nMyhill, when Myhill was having tea \" about 4 o'clock \". Subse-\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception\r\nquently the two men went together to see the lions and the incident\r\noccurred in which Stenson lost his life by falling into the lion-pit.\r\nIf the times given for the dream and the accident are even approximately correct, the accident must have occurred after Miss Edge\r\nwoke up and told her dream to Miss Svjan.\r\nNORMAL AND SUPERNORMAL PERCEPTION\r\nBy G. N. M. Tyrrell\r\nThe relation between normal and supernormal perception is a subject which is not much discussed, because people work so much\r\nin water-tight compartments that those who are interested in the one kind of perception are not as a rule interested in the other.\r\nBut, if supernormal perception be an admitted fact, its relation with\r\nthe perception which we call \" normal \" must surely be of an inti- mate and vital kind. It is necessary to take the two together, and it\r\nis quite possible that the firm establishment of supernormal perception might lead to a complete revision of our theories of normal perception and so of the entire nature of the physical world.\r\nI am going to attempt to bring out in a very rapid sketch a cer- tain aspect of normal sense-perception which I think puts one's\r\nmind in the right attitude for beginning to understand the kind of\r\nthing that supernormal perception is. It is merely a sketch and a\r\nsuggestion. I do not wish to be understood as undertaking to prove\r\na thesis : I am only trying very briefly to outline a point of view\r\nwhich I have found helpful, not only as an approach to problems in\r\npsychical research, but also to certain metaphysical problems. In\r\nthe short space at my disposal I shall not be able to go into detail or to discuss questions of evidence. To those of my readers (if such\r\nthere be) who think that the evidence of psychical research has not\r\nyet established anything, I am afraid that this discussion will seem\r\npremature.\r\nI will speak first of normal perception, calling your attention to\r\nthe striking fact that philosophers, though divided in their opinions\r\nas to what its nature is, are yet unanimously agreed that the whole\r\nsubject forms a very difficult problem ; and I wish to emphasise the\r\npoint that this in itself is a very strange fact : the strangeness which\r\nit introduces will be found to characterise the whole subject of perception, and to deepen the more one looks into it. For, why should\r\nsense-perception be a difficult subject ? No layman, unsophisticated\r\nin the subtleties of philosophy, ever thinks of the world of his senses\r\nas presenting any difficulties at all. If such a man were to come upon\r\nI Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\na group of philosophers discussing the subject of sense-perception,\r\nhis first impression would be, I think, that they were making dif- ficulties out of nothing. The ordinary man looks about him ; he\r\nsees trees and houses ; he hears the wind or the roar of the traffic ; he feels the solid ground under his feet, and he cannot see what on\r\nearth there is to argue about. Is not the world all given, as plain as a\r\npikestaff\u2014simply there 1 That, I think, would be his criticism of the\r\nphilosophers. The world of the sense is given\u2014just ultimate, brute\r\nfact.\r\nNow, would the attitude of the plain man be right ? Is the sensuous world just given and there, the same for all of us ? We must glance at the world of sense-perception from the philosopher's point of view, though I cannot go deeply into it, and I think\r\nit will be wise at the outset to admit that there is a good deal in the\r\nsensible world which is simply given. Berkeley's dictum remains\r\ntrue. \" When I open my eyes \", he said, \" in broad daylight, it is not\r\nin my power to choose what I shall see.\r\n'\r\n' It certainly is not, and that\r\nproves that we do not voluntarily create our world in the act of perceiving it and that it is independent of our wills. But that is not the\r\nwhole story. There is something very peculiar about what is given\r\nin this world of sense-perception. There is first the question, Why,\r\nif it is a simple datum, does it turn out to be such a problem ? Why\r\ndoes it become so unravelled when one tries to look into it and understand it in detail % For this is just what it does. It starts all right,\r\nbut becomes unravelled. The fact is that Nature handed the philosophers a problem to solve\u2014and I cannot help regarding it as a piece\r\nof irony on her part\u2014she handed them a problem to solve which was\r\nsolved already : so that when they got to work on it, all they did was\r\nto unsolve it. And that surely is an extraordinary thing to start\r\nwith ; yet I think that it is quite a fair way of stating the truth. I will try if I can to show that it is. It scarcely seems to need demonstrating that the world of our\r\nsenses is a solved problem initially, for every percipient being\u2014not\r\nonly men and women but also young children and animals, live in it without meeting intellectual difficulties so far as their acts of perception are concerned. They do not have to solve problems in order to\r\nbecome aware of the material objects around them. They may, of\r\ncourse, reason about these things after they have become aware of\r\nthem ; but they do not have to reason in order to become aware of\r\nthem. The sensuous world, in fact, flashes itself upon us as a readymade whole with a feeling of immediate conviction that it is there,\r\nself-consistent and complete. We do not reason on the spot, and I do not think that it can be plausibly maintained that we first got to\r\nknow our world by solving intellectual problems in extreme infancy,\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception 5\r\nwhich have afterwards become telescoped by habit. And can we\r\nreally persuade ourselves that the cat who becomes aware of a little,\r\ngrey patch, reasons to herself that it is a mouse ? It is, of course,\r\ntrue that for human beings, sensuous stimuli act largely as symbols\r\nand start in our minds trains of logical thought, for thinking beings\r\nlive largely in a world of universals. But this is all subsequent upon\r\nthe sensuous data. What Berkeley saw when he opened his eyes\r\n\r\nwhat we all see when we open our eyes\u2014comes upon us in an intuitive\r\nact;\u2014a mystical act if you like\u2014which has nothing to do with reason\r\nor logic.\r\nThis sense-given world is characterised by a beautiful simplicity\r\nand self-consistence, but as soon as the philosopher begins to analyse\r\nit, it opens out into a maze of difficulties. It behaves like the thing\r\nwhich in mathematics is called a divergent series, that is to say the\r\nkind of series which cannot be summed because its terms go on indefinitely getting larger and larger. The other kind of series, which\r\ncan be summed, is called a convergent series, because its terms become smaller and smaller, so that, even if there are an infinite\r\nnumber of them, they may yet be summed to a finite total. Any\r\ndecent, well-behaved problem behaves like a convergent series. A\r\ndetective novel is an example of one. It begins by presenting the\r\nreader with confused and scattered data, but as it goes on, it co- ordinates these data : the clues become clarified ; the machinations\r\nof the villain are brought to light ; everything gradually fits into its place and is satisfactorily explained at the end.\r\nBut, the problem of sense-perception does not behave like that\r\n;\r\nit behaves in exactly the opposite way. Instead of being vague at\r\nfirst, it begins by being perfectly definite ; but the more philosophers analyse it, the less definite it becomes ; and its air of being\r\na solved problem gives place to an air of being a more and more unsolved problem. Let me try to show this. Our belief in a world of material objects arises from our two senses of sight and touch alone. Without these, we should have no conception of a world of material things. The other senses fit in with the\r\nmaterial concept, but, unaided, they could not give rise to it. Now,\r\nlet us take some concrete object which we can see and touch, say, for\r\nexample, a pillar-box. I shall only be able to deal with one sense as my time is very short, viz., the visual sense. We are, then, \" seeing\r\n\"\r\na pillar-box. If we think of analysing the term \" seeing \" we shall\r\nbe astonished to find how many complex facts it covers. We look,\r\nand immediately we are aware of an entity which exists apart from\r\nourselves, away over there\u2014an entity which is the subject-possessor\r\nof a whole string of characteristics, such as shape, size, position,\r\ntemperature, colour and so forth\u2014qualities which in some sense be-\r\n6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\nlong to it. How do we get to know all this by merely opening our\r\neyes ? The philosopher objects that the term \" seeing \" is too indefinite. It covers too much. He will object : You say that at a\r\nsingle glance in this act of \" seeing \" you immediately know of this\r\nobject and its list of characteristics. You call it a\r\n\" pillar-box\r\n\"\r\nwhich is something having an inside as well as an outside ; a back as\r\nwell as a front ; a temporal history during which its characteristics\r\nmay change and yet in some way it itself remains identically the same. Do you claim to \" see \" all this in one single, visual act ? Now, it is exceedingly hard to say, if we are tackled in this way,\r\nexactly how we do get to know all these things. We are not sensibly aware of the inside of the pillar-box as we glance at it ; yet even in\r\nthat glance, we do recognise it as a thing which has an inside. We\r\nare not sensibly aware of its back, yet in the same way, we know at once that it has a back. We are not sensibly aware of its objectivity,\r\nyet we instantly recognise it as an object, and not as a mere patch in a colour-mosaic. We are not sensibly aware of it as enduring in a more permanent sense than that in which its qualities endure. Yet\r\nat a glance we recognise it to be the enduring subject of qualities.\r\nDo we infer all this from simpler data ? But introspection of the\r\nperceptual act fails to reveal any trace of inference within the act\r\nitself. We do not say to ourselves : That red oblong must be a thing\r\nhaving an inside and a back and so forth. We arrive at our result in\r\nsome way without the use of logic.\r\nThe philosopher seeks for the immediate data of the situation.\r\nWhat is it that is immediately given to sense ? Surely, astonishingly\r\nlittle when we come to look for it. Just a red, rectangular patch\r\nstanding out amongst other coloured patches, and seeming, further,\r\nto be standing away from us with a certain depth or outness.\r\nPhilosophers are not agreed as to whether this depth is among the\r\nbasic data of the situation or whether stereoscopic relief is a secondary\r\nfeature. But that is not important at present. From the slender\r\ndatum of this red, oblong, bulgy patch we jump at once in our visual\r\nact to complete awareness of a full-blown pillar-box and all that it entails. How do we get from the red patch to the \" thingness \" of\r\nthe pillar-box ? We do not reason it out ; it comes to us in a sort of\r\nintuitive flash by the process which philosophers call \" External\r\nReference.\" One can call it an intuition, or a mystical experience if you\r\nlike. I would hazard that it looks extremely like a case of suggestion.\r\nNow I have only space just to touch on this kind of philosophical\r\ndiscussion. My object is to show you that there are mysteries in the\r\nact of perception which the ordinary percipient does not dream of. If the plain man can see no difficulties in sense-perception the philosopher can. And there are worse difficulties yet. What is the nature\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception 7\r\nand existential status of this red, bulgy, oblong datum which seems\r\nto constitute that which is actually given in the visual situation ? It\r\nis this which is called the sense-datum, or sometimes the sensum. Our\r\nperceptual consciousness tells us that it actually constitutes the front\r\nsurface of the pillar-box and that it exists at a distance from us in\r\nspace. But, on reflection, is not this red datum our own private possession ? The red oblong which I sense surely belongs to me alone : the one which you sense belongs to you. How, then, can my private datum\r\nor yours be literally a constituent of a pillar-box which exists independently of you and me ? And, moreover, my datum does not always\r\nexist even for me. It depends on certain conditions, for instance, I must be looking in the right direction. Does the front surface of the\r\npillar-box go out of existence when I look the other way ? That is surely nonsense. But, what is the truth, then ? Perhaps someone\r\nelse is looking at the pillar-box. Is that what it is ? But if he is, his\r\ndatum is as private to him as mine is to me : and what if no one is looking at it ? Or if it is pitch dark ? What happens to its red sur- face then ? Can we say that its red surface is still there, only no one can see it ? But what is the sense of saying that a red surface is \" there \" when there is no possible way of distinguishing it from a\r\nblue surface or a green one ? In what sense is it red ? In what sense, so far as vision is concerned, is it there -at all ? Perhaps some one\r\nwill suggest that there is no actual red surface there, but that what is there is a potential red surface\u2014a surface, that is to say, which would\r\nbe red if certain conditions were realized. But this is leading us into\r\nstill deeper waters, for it suggests that the front surface of the pillarbox is, after all, a mere potentiality ; and if its front surface, why not\r\nits back and inside and all the rest of its sensible qualities ? And\r\nwhat is the pillar-box if it is not in some sense the sum of its qualities ? Can a pillar-box be a potentiality which is only actual at times\u2014at\r\nthose times, that is to say, when someone is looking at it ? That\r\nmakes its actuality depend upon the observer. It would be intermittently actual, and even then not publicly actual. But our perceptual consciousness tells us that it is publicly existent and always\r\nactual whether anyone is looking at it or not : and always red\r\nwhether anyone can see it as red or not. And this proposition seems\r\nperfectly simple and obvious to common sense until we try to analyse\r\nit, when it turns into a seemingly hopeless tangle of this kind.\r\nThis is what happens when we try to analyse the world of the\r\nnormal senses. I am not going to attempt to resolve the tangles here.\r\nThe ground is much too difficult and controversial. What I am\r\ntrying to do is to justify my statement that the world of the senses\r\nstarts by being a solved problem and becomes more and more an\r\nunsolved problem as one looks into it. I am showing you the\r\n8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\ndivergent series opening out. In different places in its opening fan\r\nthe various schools of realist and idealist philosophers have come to\r\nrest and remain disputing with one another. Does not this fact alone\r\nshow how unsolved the problem is ? The spell of simplicity which\r\nrests on the everyday world of our senses is broken directly we think\r\nabout that world closely. It reminds one of Mr. Belloc's charming\r\nlittle verse about the water-spider :\r\n\" He glides upon the water's face\r\nWith ease, celerity and grace ; But if he ever stopped to think\r\nOf how he did it, he would sink.\"\r\nOur common sense glides like that over the sensible world until we\r\nstop to think about it . And then, as soon as our attention is focussed\r\nupon it, its self-evident character disappears ; its simplicity vanishes ; its satisfactory feeling of being obvious withers at the touch of\r\ncriticism ; it opens out into one puzzle after another like the mathematician's divergent series. If the claim of this sensuous world to be ultimate reality were true,\r\nhow could it possibly unravel as it does ? How can facts which are ultimate facts, or entities which are bedrock entities, ever turn into\r\nanything else, however much you examine them ? If anything\r\nmanifests a self-inconsistency when it is analysed, then that thing,\r\nas Bradley was so fond of pointing out, is not reality but appearance.\r\nUnder analysis, the objects of the sensible world do manifest this\r\nself-inconsistency. They behave, as Shelley said of the leaves before\r\nthe West Wind\u2014\" like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing \". So that what this philosophical argument is bringing out is that\r\nthe world of normal perception is not the absolute thing it claims to\r\nbe, but exists relatively to ourselves. Perhaps I can illustrate this\r\nrelativity still better by taking the case of colour.\r\nWhat is the real colour of anything ? At first sight it seems a\r\nsimple question, and common sense is quite ready to answer, \" Pillarboxes and tomatoes are red ; grass and cucumbers are green ; the\r\nsky is blue and so forth. There seems to be no problem about that\r\nBut there is a problem ; it obtrudes itself even in daily life, and\r\nespecially in feminine daily life. If one ever goes on a shopping\r\nexpedition with a lady it is pretty sure to turn up. The lady selects\r\nher piece of material at the counter, but before buying it, she takes it to the window to find out what its real colour is ; because she knows\r\nfrom experience that what looks like a nice shade of beige under the\r\nelectric light may very well turn out to be an ugly shade of yellow by\r\ndaylight. Now, if you asked her what colour her piece of material\r\nreally was, she would probably answer, \" Of course its real colour is\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception 9\r\nan ugly yellow ; it only looked beige under the electric light\". She\r\nwould be speaking, of course, without the caution born of a training\r\nin philosophy. Now, it is not really a silly thing to say that a piece\r\nof material looks one colour under one set of circumstances, but is another colour, which it looks under another set of circumstances 1 How is one to define the difference between \" looking \" a colour and\r\n\" being \" a colour : and in any case, how decide which of the two\r\ncolours the thing really is and which it only looks ? The lady decides\r\nthat it is the colour it appears to be by daylight, but on what\r\ngrounds ? Only, apparently, on the ground that she is more interested in its daylight colour. But suppose that the sun suddenly\r\nturned the same colour as electric light, what would the real colour\r\nof the material be then ? She would then say that the material\r\nreally is the colour which she now says it only looks. Her point of\r\nview is thoroughly anthropocentric and relative. What she calls\r\ntheir real colours are the colours things have under the conditions to\r\nwhich she is most accustomed. The colours which things have\r\noccasionally are the colours which she says they only \" look \". But\r\nthere are no grounds for drawing a distinction between \" looking \"\r\na colour and \" being \" a colour. Things \" are \" all the colours they\r\nlook, if one can use the word are at all. There is no way of defining a real colour in the sense of an inherent colour. Colour, in fact, is not\r\nan intrinsic property of a thing but is a property which is relative to\r\nan observer.\r\nThe difficulties increase if we take into account that an object can\r\napparently be two or more colours at once, as in the phrase : \" This\r\npiece of silk looks green to me from here, but at the same time it\r\nlooks purple to you from over there \". If it looks green and purple at\r\nonce, it is green and purple at once. But I am only illustrating, and\r\nI will not pursue this argument further.\r\nA visit to the case containing the fluorescent minerals at the\r\nNatural History Museum at South Kensington gives a vivid impression of the relativity of colour. As one turns on the ultra-violet\r\nfight, the dull, grey minerals glow out into vivid pinks and blues\r\nwhich force themselves on the mind as being the real colours of the\r\nminerals.\r\nI am aware that in illustrating the point of view which I am trying\r\nto suggest by the case of colour, I am laying myself open to attack ; for it will be said that such characteristics of objects as shape, size\r\nand position do not share the relativity of colour, but are absolute\r\ncharacteristics of things. I do not believe that this is ultimately\r\ntrue, but have no space in which to vindicate my belief. I must\r\ncontent myself by stating that the relativity manifested by colour is,\r\nin my opinion, in the last analysis, general to all the characteristics\r\n10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\nof the world of normal sense-perception. Lack of space forces me to\r\nbe dogmatic. But suppose, as an illustration, that air happened to\r\nhave a double index of refraction like Iceland Spar, and our visual\r\nworld was a kind of inebriate's paradise in which everything\r\nappeared double. Should we know that physical objects were in\r\nreality single ? At first sight it would seem as if our sense of touch\r\nwould tell us so, but as the two senses would have been evolved\r\ntogether, it is much more probable that every feeling of contact\r\nwould also be double. Rare cases in which things looked or felt single would be put down as illusions.\r\nRelativity permeates the world of our senses, I maintain, through\r\nand through, although in our capacity of workaday, percipient\r\nbeings, Nature carefully arranges to hide this fact from us. She is a\r\ngreat Pragmatist, and puts practical considerations first. Consciousness of the self is, I think one might almost say, studiously kept\r\nout of the perceptual situation. This is so much the case that it gives one the impression of a teleological factor at work in the staging\r\nof the sensible world. In sense-perception, one's perceptual consciousness is projected from one like the light of a searchlight. One\r\nis like a man driving a motor-car in the dark, who is barely conscious\r\nof himself or the machine, but whose whole attention is projected\r\nforward onto the illuminated road ahead. There is, of course, an\r\nexcellent reason why this should be so in the case of the motorist\r\n:\r\nbut, may there not be an equally good practical reason why it should\r\nbe so with normal sense-perception. What utter confusion would\r\nresult if that sense of complete independence were lacking from the\r\nexternal world. Remember that Nature formed our senses for the\r\nkind of life in which a man lay down at night with his hand on his\r\nspear and his ears alert for the slightest sound of approaching danger.\r\nIt is an interesting question to ask ourselves whether, after some\r\nthousands of years of comparative safety, we are not now witnessing\r\nthe beginnings of a higher mode of cognition.\r\nBut, as I said, although our perceptual consciousness stoutly denies\r\nthat we have had any hand in shaping the world of our senses, philosophical analysis shows that we have ; only the fact is carefully screened from us. This is the teleological factor to which I referred. Does it not look as if we were perceiving, not so much the\r\nworld as it actually is, as a specially prepared version of the world\r\nwhich somebody or something wants us to perceive ? Can it be\r\nmother Nature, drawing a blackboard picture for her class in simple\r\noutlines ? That is what I think the facts suggest, although my present\r\nlittle sketch gives a very inadequate hint of it. Nature wants us to\r\nbelieve that the world of our senses is an absolute world, existing in\r\nentire independence of ourselves. But in truth it is neither.\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception 11\r\nI will now leave the philosophical argument and go on to ask what\r\nphysical science has to say ahout the plain world of our normal\r\nsenses. In its early stages, physics was entirely at one with the\r\nworld of the senses, which it accepted as a going concern. Its busi- ness was merely to examine this world as accurately as possible. Its policy was experiment : its philosophy empiricism. After its career\r\nof two or three centuries, has it vindicated the account of external\r\nreality given by our perceptual consciousness ; or has it followed in\r\nthe footsteps of philosophy in diverging from it ? To glance back first at the account which the senses give of\r\ncolour, can there be any doubt about their verdict ? Colour in perception is given as being spread out over the surface of the coloured\r\nobject. The red colour of the pillar-box is given as being spread\r\nout over its cylindrical surface away from us at a distance in space.\r\nI do not see how anyone can possibly dispute this. It is simply a fact. The colour is given as there, and there is not the slightest suggestion\r\nthat we have anything to do with its being there. As given in perception, it is perfectly independent of us. If you were to stop the\r\ncasual passer-by in the street and ask him if he had anything to do\r\nwith the pillar-box being red. what would he say ? I think the best\r\nyou could hope for would be the reply that he was not the Post Office\r\nemployee who painted pillar-boxes ; but he would be more likely to think that you were insane and hurry on. But the proposition\r\nAvhich science maintains is. exactly, that the percipient has everything to do with the pillar-box being red. It states that colour does\r\nnot exist at all in the external world. Its explanation of colour runs something like this. The surface of the pillar-box consists of\r\nmolecular groups of bonded atoms, each atom being something like a minute planetary system of electrons circulating about a positive\r\nnucleus or proton. The theory of the atom has advanced a long way\r\nbeyond this now, but that does not affect the present principle. The\r\nvibrating systems absorb part of the incoming light-energy and reflect\r\npart. That part which is reflected from the pillar-box has the particular frequency belonging to the red part of the spectrum. Some of\r\nit enters the observer's eye, and is focussed by the lenses of the eve\r\nto form a tiny image on the retina. The rods and cones of the retina\r\nunder this image are stimulated to send nervous impulses along the\r\noptic nerves to a particular part of the cortex of the brain. Certain\r\nphysiological changes take place in the stimulated portion of the\r\ncerebral tract. But now the causal sequence is broken. A hiatus\r\noccurs. Without any intelligible link or go-between, a determinate\r\nform of conscious awareness is experienced by the percipient\u2014\r\na\r\n\" sensation \" occurs. He semes a red, oblong patch. This is the first point at which the redness of the pillar-box appears in the physicist's\r\n12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\nexplanation. And now that the redness does appear, it is not something in the external world as the redness of perception certainly is. It is sensation\u2014& feeling.\r\nThe whole of this scientific explanation of colour may be summed\r\nup in two words. It is a causal theory. Science states that the pillarbox is not red, but that it causes red. And so with the other\r\nqualities of material objects. The ice is not cold ; it causes cold.\r\nThe table is not smooth ; it causes a smooth feeling, and so on. The\r\ninevitable tendency of physics is to pass from the claimed independence of the world of the senses to a dependent world relative to the\r\nobserver. Let me quote a rather well-known passage from Professor\r\nA. N. Whitehead's Science and the Modern World, which puts this\r\nfact in striking terms. He is speaking of Locke and the philosophy\r\nof science which arose towards the close of the seventeenth century.\r\n\" But the mind \", he says, \" in apprehending also experiences sensations which, properly speaking, are qualities of the mind alone.\r\nThese sensations are projected by the mind so as to clothe appropriate bodies in external nature. Thus the bodies are perceived as with qualities which in reality do not belong to them, qualities\r\nwhich in fact are purely the offspring of the mind. Thus nature gets\r\ncredit which should in truth be reserved for ourselves : the rose for\r\nits scent : the nightingale for its song : the sun for his radiance.\r\nThe poets are entirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics\r\nto themselves, and should turn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellency of the human mind. Nature is a dull affair, soundless, scentless, colourless ; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly. However you disguise it, this is the practical\r\noutcome of the characteristic philosophy which closed the seven- teenth century. ... It has held its own as a guiding principle of\r\nscientific studies ever since. It is still reigning. Every university\r\nin the world organises itself in accordance with it. No alternative\r\nsystem of organising the pursuit of scientific truth has been suggested.\r\nIt is not only reigning, but it is without a rival. And yet\u2014it is quite\r\nunbelievable.\"\r\nNow, whether it is believable or not, the important point is that if we take these two accounts\u2014the sensuous account and the scientific\r\naccount\u2014at their face values, they are in flat contradiction with one\r\nanother. There can be no question at all that our perceptual consciousness places the scent in the rose, the song in the nightingale,\r\nand the radiance in the sun ; and, for that matter, the red colour on the pillar-box. But physics denies that they are there, and places\r\nthem in our minds instead. Is there any way of reconciling these two\r\ndiverse points of view ? As far as I can see there is none, so long as both these explanations claim to be ultimate. But, if one or both of\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception 13\r\nthem, will agree to accept a relative status, then the two might be\r\nreconciled.\r\nSpace will not allow me to consider the alternatives in which :\r\n(a) the world of the senses is taken to be ultimately real while the\r\nworld of physics is the appearance of it which the scientific observer\r\nattains, or (b) the world as disclosed by physics is ultimate reality,\r\nwhile the world of the senses is a relative appearance of this to the\r\nordinary observer. I have given reasons for rejecting (a) ; and, as\r\nfor (b), how can a world-outlook which is in such a state of flux as modern physics pose as ultimate and unchangeable truth ? The only\r\nalternative remaining is that neither our senses nor the physical\r\nscientist is putting before us the world of being as it ultimately is. Both these views are strictly relative to man, who, if he is shaped by\r\nthe universe he inhabits, in turn shapes that universe in the act of\r\ncognising it, in the sense that, what is present to his consciousness is not identical with the character of the thing itself, but is a picture\r\nwhich represents it, and is peculiarly adapted to him.\r\nPhysics does not support the given character of the world of sense- perception any more than philosophy does.\r\nIt shows it as infected through and through with relativity. We\r\nneed not consider the modern developments of the subject ; they\r\nhave only left the world of the senses still further isolated. In the\r\nwords of Professor Max. Planck, \" as the view of the physical world\r\nis perfected, it simultaneously recedes from the world of sense \". The one world is now no longer recognizable in the other. And this\r\nmutual divergence is a sure indication that both of these worlds are\r\nabstractions.\r\nLet me briefly recapitulate. I have been speaking so far of the\r\nworld of normal sense-perception, and I have rapidly glanced at it from each of three different points of view. First, from the point of\r\nview of the entirely unsophisticated person whose world is the one which he sees, and feels, and hears by his unaided senses. His world\r\nwas entirely satisfactory, succinct, clear-cut, without problems or\r\ndifficulties for him. It claimed to exist in entire independence of him\r\nand to be absolute and final. Secondly, I looked at the same world\r\nfrom the point of view of the philosopher. We saw the philosopher\r\ntake it up as an already solved problem and try to analyse it, and we\r\nsaw it disintegrate under his criticism and open out like the mathematician's divergent series. I illustrated this process by taking the\r\ncase of colour, although I maintained that the principle was quite\r\ngeneral. We found that the world of sense lost its independence\r\nunder analysis and became riddled through and through with\r\nrelativity, involving the percipient as an efficient and indispensable\r\nfactor in determining the nature of that world itself.\r\n14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\nThirdly, I looked at the same world again through the eyes of\r\nphysical science, and found that its examination did the same kind\r\nof thing that philosophy had done, viz. unravelled the world of the\r\nsenses and fastened its qualities upon the observer\u2014in a word, introduced the same element of relativity, which reduced the sensible\r\nworld from being the universe as it is to being a picture of the\r\nuniverse as it seems. Now, I want to make it quite clear that in advocating this relative view of the world of normal sense-perception I am not advocating\r\nany form of Subjective Idealism. I am not asserting that the mind\r\ncreates its world. My point of view is fundamentally realist. I am\r\nsaying that both science and philosophy, if we interpret their dicta\r\nrightly, point to the world of our senses as being an aspect of something which lies behind it\u2014an aspect which has been peculiarly\r\nadapted by nature to the practical needs of humanity, and indeed of\r\nall living animals. The idea, of course, is a very old one, which has\r\nbeen familiar since at least the time-honoured illustration of\r\nPlato's cave, wherein the chained men watched the shadows of real\r\nevents passing along the back. And I shall be reminded of Kant's\r\nnoumenal and phenomenal worlds ; and also, perhaps, of the saying\r\nwhich l)r IniM' often quotes from the Quaker Mystic, [saac Pennington : \" Every truth is Substance in its own place, though it be but\r\nShadow in another place. And the Shadow is a true Shadow, as the\r\nSubstance is a true Substance \". But I believe that this view has a\r\nspecial relevance to the subject which I am now going to discuss,\r\nviz. that of Supernormal Perception.\r\nI am not, of course, in my present argument making any attempt\r\nto disclose the nature of the ultimately real\u2014the Substance which\r\nwe see as Shadow. I am merely maintaining that, whatever the\r\nnature of the ultimately real may be, the world of our normal perceptions is not identical with it. And I suggest that this point of view\r\nmakes the facts which we already know about supernormal perception\r\nmost nearly intelligible to us, and it should tend to mitigate the attitude of a priori scepticism with which these facts are generally met.\r\nI now turn to supernormal perception, using the terminology with\r\nwhich we are all familiar. This is subdivided into three headings,\r\nviz. Telepathy, Clairvoyance and Precognition. I am not sure that\r\nI should not add a fourth heading, viz. Retrocognition. But genuine\r\nretrocognition (as distinct from revival of lost memories) is a very\r\ndifficult subject, and I am not even sure whether it is possible in\r\nprinciple to obtain any evidence of it, so I will not speak of it. I need not define these three types of cognition here, and as I am\r\ntreating the subject from a theoretical standpoint, I shall say very\r\nlittle on the question of evidence. There is, of course, evidence in\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Stiperr.ornud Pp. ?c&pt ion 15\r\nthe Society's records, as well as elsewhere,, of all these three types of\r\nsupernormal perception. A good, ileal >y\u00a3 that for telepathy\" and\r\nclairvoyance is undifferentiated. An illustration of this Undifferentiated evidence is provided by the Ossowiecki case reported in the\r\nProceedings for December, 1933. This might have been a case of\r\ntelepathy, or it might have been a case of clairvoyance, or it might\r\nhave been a case of both together. The usual tendency to give tele- pathy the preference in such cases as this is, as far as I can see, no more than a prejudice. Thus there is a great deal of evidence for\r\ntelepathy and clairvoyance combined, but we do not know how to apportion most of it between the two.\r\nThe evidence for precognition, though less in amount, is nevertheless considerable. This evidence, as far as this Society is concerned,\r\nwas recently collected and sifted by Mr H. F. Saltmarsh and published in his important paper in the Proceedings in February, 1934.\r\nIt will be remembered that, after rejecting the weakest cases, the\r\nauthor was left with a total of 281 cases, which he classified into\r\ngrades of different evidential value. No one has yet taken all these\r\ncases and shown that any alternative explanation to that of precognition disposes of them more reasonably ; and as this is the only\r\nway in which the primafacie explanation of precognition can be displaced, this explanation so far stands unchallenged.\r\nI will assume, then, that Supernormal Perception exists in all three of its branches. Can we explain it ? Now, explanation means description in terms of the familiar.\r\nIf we can explain supernormal perception, we have established this\r\nvery important fact, viz. that normal and supernormal perception\r\nbelong in some way to the same order of things\u2014the order with\r\nwhich we are familiar. Both can be described in the category of\r\nfamiliar concepts. If, on the other hand, we cannot explain supernormal perception, although the converse need not be true (for our\r\nfailure might be due to insufficiency of data and ignorance) yet it might be true. That is to say, the failure to find an explanation\r\nmight mean that normal and supernormal perception belong to two\r\nentirely different orders of existence.\r\nNow, with regard to clairvoyance, is there any way in which we\r\ncan explain it in terms which are familiar to us ? Some percipient\r\nbecomes cognisant of the design on a card as it lies in the middle of a\r\nshuffled pack, or perhaps of words on a certain page in a book as it stands closed amongst other books on the library shelf. Can we\r\nconceive how such a thing can happen ? The first thing towards which our mind turns is some form of\r\nradiation hypothesis, because science explains certain of our modes\r\nof normal, sensory perception by means of radiation. We become\r\n16 Joiirr.al of Society .for Psychical Research January 1935\r\naware of a distant star, of the warmth of a fire or the ringing of a\r\nbell by one or' other kind of radiation which travels through space\r\nfrom the cognised object' to ourselves. Can it be that some form of\r\nradiation passes from the cognised design on the card or from the\r\nprint in the book, through the intervening objects to our brain or nervous system and there in some way records itself and affects our\r\nconsciousness ? A little reflection is, I think, sufficient to dismiss\r\nsuch an explanation entirely.\r\nSuppose it is a book-test, for example in which telepathy is ex- cluded. The percipient gets to know certain words on a particular\r\npage in a closed book in a shelf of books. Some sort of radiation\r\nmust be given off by the ink. It must pass through the paper, the\r\nbinding, the wood of the book-case and the walls of the room if these\r\nhappen to intervene between the print and the percipient. If this\r\nwas what was happening, it would first of all make a difference in\r\nwhat direction the percipient stood. In line with the page he would\r\nget next to nothing : at right angles to the page he would get the\r\nbest result. The nearer he approached the book, the stronger the\r\nimpression woixld become ; and if we ever came across a percipient\r\nwho could read a page of a book a mile away, we could be pretty sure\r\nof getting amazing results by holding a book against the back of his\r\nhead. None of these things show any signs of happening. But the\r\nworst difficulty a radiation theory has to meet is that if the particular\r\nletters in which the percipient was interested were giving out this\r\nradiation, every other letter on every other page, not only of that\r\nbook, but of all the other books in the book-case, would be giving it out too, and as Professor Rhine says in his book on Extra-Sensory\r\nPerception, the result would be \" one great, unanalysable splotch \". Then there is the question of distance which, applies both to tele- pathy and clairvoyance. The intensity of any physical transmission\r\nvaries inversely with the square of the distance from the source. This is the only conceivable way in which energy could spread from a\r\ngiven centre through three-dimensional space. Let us try to realise\r\nwhat this inverse-square law means. Take the most powerful lighthouse on the English coast\u2014the Lizard. Its light is directly visible\r\nto a distance of about eighteen miles. Imagine its power increased\r\nuntil the light could penetrate 1800 miles ; what would it be like to\r\ncome up and look into the lens ? Or if the steam whistle of an ocean\r\nliner were powerful enough to be heard all across the Atlantic, what\r\nwould it be like to stand about five feet away from it ? Now, there\r\nare many cases in which telepathy has taken place across the world.\r\nIf telepathy were a kind of \" mental radio\/' as the popular mind\r\nseems to believe, then an agent who could transmit a telepathic message, say, from England to Australia would be a truly terrible member\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception 17\r\nof society. No one who lived in the same county with him\u2014not even\r\nthe most unpsychic person\u2014would be able to keep his telepathic\r\nmessages out ; and to enter the same room with him would very\r\nlikely shatter one's nervous organisation and prove fatal. The extraordinary penetrability of radiation, which passes through\r\nso many obstacles on its way to the percipient, raises the question\r\nwhy such radiation should not also pass through the nervous substance of the percipient without producing any effect. It seems scarcely worth while to continue the argument against a\r\nradiation theory of telepathy and clairvoyance, but there is another\r\nargument against it, which is sufficient by itself to put the theory out\r\nof court. All meanings which are transmitted by physical means\r\nhave first to be translated into a code of symbols, which are either a series of noises, or visible marks or gestures. These are radiated by\r\nquantitative changes of energy\u2014light or sound or electro-magnetic\r\nenergy in the case of wireless. These purely arbitrary symbols are then reinterpreted by the percipient who uses his knowledge of what\r\nthe symbols mean. But there is not the slightest trace in telepathy\r\nor clairvoyance of such symbolical encoding or decoding processes.\r\nNor, one may add, is there any trace of the necessary transmitting\r\nand receiving organs. The radiation theory may surely be dismissed once for all. Is there any other theory of physical transmission which will meet\r\nthe case, which is not a radiation theory ? I have never heard of one and I cannot conceive of one. We are therefore baffled in our attempt to explain telepathy and\r\nclairvoyance in physical terms ; and that is tantamount to saying\r\nthat we are baffled in our attempt to explain them at all. But now let me recall the final result of our examination of the\r\nworld of normal sense-perception, which, put in a nutshell, stated\r\nthat the world of the perceptual consciousness is not so much the\r\nworld as our world. What assumption have we been making in trying to explain clairvoyance ? We have been assuming that the\r\nclairvoyant is getting in touch with a physical object, the physical\r\ncard or the physical book. But the conclusion summarised above\r\nsuggests that we are on the wrong track in doing this. The card and\r\nthe book are sensible objects belonging to our world : they are not\r\nbedrock entities at all. They are highly specialised pictures of something else, and it is not in the least probable that the percipient is getting in touch with what we call \" physical objects \" themselves.\r\nHe is getting in touch with whatever it is that lies behind physical\r\nobjects, and if he gets a physical picture of the card, etc., it is because\r\nthe impulse has taken this form on emergence. The clairvoyant's\r\noriginal cognitive impression is not derived from a physical object.\r\n18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January i 935-\r\nThe truth is that the physical object and the clairvoyant impression\r\nare both derived from the same source. When we ask how the clairvoyant's information is derived from the card, we are asking the same,\r\nsort of confusing question as :\r\n' How can the back view of a house be\r\nderived from the front view'? The answer is : ' it cannot'. The front\r\nview and the back view are independent of one another, but are both\r\nderived from the same source, which is the house itself. So that, if\r\nsupernormal perception be a fact at all, it looks as though we are not\r\ndealing with any mere extension of normal sensory faculty on the\r\nlines of hyperaesthesia or some extended sensitiveness to electromagnetic or corpuscular radiation or anything of that sort. Normal\r\nsensory perception is a highly specialised kind of thing. What we\r\nare dealing with lies outside it altogether. In the long run, if this\r\nview is substantiated by experiment, it looks as if there can be only\r\none result. The tendency will be more and more to show the world\r\nof normal sense-perception as something highly specialised, particular, abstract and relative instead of as we always tend to regard\r\nit. universal, concrete and absolute. If this latter were the truth,\r\nthen the relation between the normal and supernormal worlds would\r\nshow itself as that of part to whole, and the two would blend and\r\nshow continuity. But they do not. We pass in a single step from\r\nthe fully known world of the senses to something entirely inexplicable : and what can this mean except that the relation between the\r\ntwo worlds is not that of part to whole but that of aspect to entity,\r\nor, if you prefer it, of appearance to reality ?\r\nI need scarcely point out that if clairvoyance does not take place\r\nfrom card to brain, neither does telepathy take place from brain to\r\nbrain. If the card is only the sense-version of something else, then\r\nthe brain is only the sense-version of something else too\u2014and what\r\ncan that something else be except some grade of the complex human\r\npersonality 1 The reason why the messages seem to ignore space is because space itself is only a part of the sense-picture.\r\nOf precognition I have no time to speak. It plunges us, of course,\r\nat once into the controversy between determinism and libertarianism. And if we seek to delve into that, we find ourselves involved in\r\nthe most extraordinary welter of paradoxes. But this I would say,\r\nthat it ought to be possible to prove the existence of clairvoyance and\r\nprecognition quite definitely by means of fairly simple experiments,\r\nand that to establish them as facts would be of the greatest importance. In fact, psychical research has an advantage over all the\r\nphysical sciences in that they are entirely dependent on the data of\r\nnormal sense-perception : nothing they discover can be truer than\r\nthe data of the senses. But psychical research has access to another\r\nmode of cognition, and this is like getting a cross-bearing on the\r\nJanuary 1935 Normal and Supernormal Perception lit\r\nwhole range of scientific knowledge. It stands in a unique position\r\namong the sciences and at the same time enters the metaphysical\r\nproblems of philosophy. But it does not approach these from the\r\nspeculative point of view alone, for psychical research always retains its empirical basis. It is so important, occupying as it does, the\r\ncrucial centre from which the most important human problems\r\nradiate, that one wonders why all the universities in the world have\r\nnot long ago pooled their resources in an attempt to exploit its possibilities. I suppose that if the pursuit of knowledge were organised\r\non a speculative and not on a commercial and utilitarian basis, this\r\nwould have been done. But even as it is, one would think that a\r\nsociety for psychical research which strenuously pursues the experimental side and as strenuously advertises the theoretical importance\r\nof its results, ought to have great opportunities before it.\r\nREVIEW\r\nLieut.-Colonel Robert Henry Elliot, M.D., Sc.D., F.R.C.S.,\r\nThe Myth of the Mystic East. 8vo, pp. 301. London, Wm.\r\nBlackwood & Sons, Ltd. 1934. Price 7s. 6d. net.\r\nColonel Elliot has written an extremely interesting book, the least\r\nfortunate part of which is perhaps the title. His long residence in\r\nIndia as an Officer of the Indian Medical Service and his familiarity\r\nwith conjuring in Europe have made him very critical of claims that\r\nthere exists in India a\r\n\" magic \" of a different kind from that practised by conjurers in European countries, a\r\n\" magic \" depending on\r\n\" supernormal \" control of natural forces.\r\nAt several points he touches matters which have come under the\r\nconsideration of our Society, notably the \" Indian Rope Trick \". He emphasizes the fact, well known to our members, that it is impossible to get first-hand evidence, which will bear examination, of\r\nthe trick ever having been performed as described, and rightly adds\r\nthat until such evidence is forthcoming it is idle to theorise as to how\r\na thing happened which there is no reason to believe ever happened\r\nat all. He subjects to detailed criticism various testimonies in favour\r\nof the trick having been performed, and suggests that, where the\r\nbona fides of the narrators is beyond suspicion, they are confusing\r\nin their own minds traditional descriptions of this trick with memories of a quite different feat, which they had themselves observed,\r\nnamely, balancing on the top of a long bamboo pole. The whole of\r\nChap. Ill of this book is devoted to this subject.\r\nOther famous tricks, such as the mango trick, receive similar\r\n2() Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1935\r\nattention. Colonel Elliot draws attention to the very different conditions under which Indian and European magicians work, and\r\nparticularly to the fact that whereas in the West great value is paid\r\nto novelty, in the East the magician simply seeks to do the old tricks over and over again with increasing slickness. This, coupled with\r\nthe fact that the practice of magic, as so many other things in India,\r\nis hereditary, may very likely result in the Indian magician attaining\r\nby normal means a greater degree of manual dexterity than his\r\nEuropean rival. He is not, however, subjected to as close scrutiny\r\nas the European, and will generally refuse to perform the same\r\ntrick twice before the same audience.\r\nColonel Elliot is also incredulous as to the existence of \" were\r\nbeasts \", of which creatures reports from time to time reach the\r\nS.P.R. He has, in connection with medical work, made a special\r\nstudy of venomous snakes, and the latter part of the book contains a mass of information, which, if not very relevant to our subject or\r\nto the earlier portion of the book, is of considerable interest about\r\nsnakes, British and foreign, venomous and non-venomous. The reader who approaches Colonel Elliot's book from the angle\r\nof psychical research may occasionally be irritated by his dogmatism\r\non one or two matters where an open mind is desirable, e.g. the\r\npossibility of mass hallucination, but taking the book as a whole he\r\nwill find a great deal to enjoy.

Two new Members were elected.\r\nThe Council at Mr Besterman's request agreed to treat his appointment as an Officer of the Society as terminated as from the 22nd\r\nJanuary. The Council wish to place on record their appreciation of\r\nthe many services rendered by Mr Besterman to the Society since\r\nhis appointment in 1929.\r\nMr W. Whately Carington was appointed Myers Memorial\r\nLecturer for 1935.\r\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1934\r\n(1) Research : Parapsychical Phenomena. Mr Whately Carington\r\nhas actively pursued the investigations with word association tests referred to in the last Annual Report. With the co-operation of the\r\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas and the Rev. W. S. Irving he has obtained\r\nfurther material from Mrs Leonard, her control \" Feda \", and various\r\n\" communicators \", and has analysed this. Some members of the\r\nSociety have also kindly consented to be subjected to these tests in\r\ntheir normal state, and in one case also in trance condition, and Mr\r\nCarington has analysed the results.\r\nIn view of the novelty of these experiments, as ajjplied to psychical\r\nresearch, and the importance of the results which may very possibly\r\nbe obtained from them, the Council has purchased an efficient\r\nCalculating Machine, without which the analytical work would be\r\nimpossible, and has lent it to Mr Carington for use by him in the\r\nfurther work which he is actively pursuing on the same lines. Mr\r\nCarington in April read a report (published in Part 136 of Proceedings) on the work he had so far done, and further reports from him are awaited with interest.\r\nSeveral of our members have been conducting experiments in\r\nparagnosis of various kinds. The work of Dr J. B. Rhine, now the\r\nHonorary Research Officer of the Boston Society for Psychic Research and a member of our Society, on extra-sensory perception is\r\n24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February m.35\r\nof great interest. In it he has emphasised the importance of conducting experiments in such a way that results attributable to any one\r\nparticular form of paragnosis shall be distinguishable from results\r\nattributable to other forms, and this is being borne in mind by the\r\nexperimenters of our Society.\r\n(2) Paraphysical Phenomena. The sittings with Rudi Schneider\r\nmentioned in the last Report were continued after the New Year\r\nuntil Easter. A feature of the experiments was the use of various\r\nnew types of ajypliances. This was rendered possible by the generosity of Mr Oliver Gatty, who took a large part both in financing and\r\nin organising the 1934 sittings. The appliances used were described\r\nby Mr Gatty at a meeting of the Society in May, and a report on the\r\nsittings by the Investigation Officer and Mr Gatty was published as Part 137 of Proceedings. No definitely supernormal phenomena\r\nwere observed at the sittings, but the careful application of a rather\r\nelaborate mechanical system of control and recording must be of\r\nassistance in future experiments with this type of mediumship.\r\nAfter the medium had completed his sittings for the Society, he\r\ngave some sittings to Lord Charles Hope, who has reported on them\r\nin Part 138 of Proceedings.\r\n(3) The B.B.C. Lectures. Towards the end of 1933 the British\r\nBroadcasting Corporation invited several members of the Society to\r\ntake part in a series of wireless \" talks \" entitled \" Enquiry into the\r\nUnknown \", which the Corporation was organising. Ten members\r\nof the Society accepted the invitation and \" talks \" were delivered\r\nby them in January to March 1934. They aroused great interest\r\namong the general public and, in response to invitations issued by\r\nsome of the lecturers, many spontaneous cases of phantasms of the\r\nliving, haunts, precognition, etc., were brought to the Society's\r\nnotice. The \" talks \" have been reprinted in an expanded form,\r\nEnquiry into the Unknown (Methuen & Co.), and Mrs Salter has\r\nalso published some of the cases received by her under the\r\ntitle Evidence for Telepathy (Sidgwick & Jackson, Ltd.). The\r\nPresident and Mrs Salter read papers in March and September,\r\ngiving an account of some of the cases of precognition and telepathy\r\nthat they had received.\r\n(4) Donation to the Society. In February a member, who wishes\r\nto remain anonymous, presented to the Society through Mr Gerald\r\nHeard a donation of \u00a31,000, to be expended by the Council on\r\nresearch. The Council wish to record their most hearty thanks for\r\nthis donation, which is the most substantial donation towards\r\nresearch that the Society has received for many years.\r\nThe donor authorised Mr Heard to discuss with the Council the\r\nFebruary 1935 Annual Report of the Council for 193If. 25\r\nparticular lines of research in which he was most interested and\r\nwhich he thought could profitably be pursued, and a programme to\r\nbe undertaken as soon as possible was accordingly drawn up by the\r\nCouncil in conjunction with Mr Heard, who was co-opted a member\r\nof Council.\r\n(5) The Investigation Officer's Visit to America. It was part of\r\nthis programme that the Investigation Officer should visit the\r\nUnited States and Canada for the purpose of observing and reporting on several pieces of research being carried on in those countries,\r\nespecially Dr Rhine's experiments in extra-sensory perception at\r\nDuke University, North Carolina, and Dr Glen Hamilton's investigations at Winnipeg. The Investigation Officer suggested that the\r\nvisit might conveniently be extended to Brazil, so that he could have an opportunity of visiting the Brazilian medium, Mirabelli, members\r\nof the Society having offered to give him an introduction to that\r\nmedium and to contribute to the expenses. The Council accordingly\r\nauthorised the Investigation Officer to undertake a tour first of all to Brazil to investigate Mirabelli, then to the United States and\r\nCanada. An estimate of the cost of the tour was made, and with the\r\ndonor's concurrence the sum of \u00a3350 out of the donation of \u00a31,000 was allowed by the Council for the expenses of the tour.\r\nMr Besterman left England for Rio de Janeiro on the 13 July.\r\nThrough the kind introduction of a member of the Society residing\r\nin Brazil, he was able to obtain several sittings with Mirabelli at\r\nwhich he observed interesting phenomena. Towards the cost of this\r\ninvestigation Miss May Walker kindly gave \u00a325. The Council wish\r\nto take this opportunity of thanking her for her generous gift.\r\nFrom Brazil Mr Besterman went to New York, where he stayed\r\nabout three weeks. From there on the 18 September he wrote\r\nto the Hon. Secretary announcing that he had been seriously ill and\r\nthat he was returning to England in a few days' time. He arrived\r\nin England about the end of September, and on the 8 October\r\nwrote to the Hon. Secretary tendering his resignation of the post of\r\nInvestigation Officer as from the expiration of the six months'\r\nnotice required by his agreement with the Society.\r\nThe Council felt obliged to accept Mr Besterman's resignation as from the expiration of six months from the date of the letter in which\r\nhe tendered it, also, in view of a recurrence of his illness, to grant him\r\ntemporary leave of absence.\r\n(6) Research Committee. The resignation of the Investigation\r\nOfficer necessitated a revision of the Council's arrangements for\r\nresearch. The Council decided to appoint a Research Committee to\r\nadvise them as to the future organisation of research and to initiate\r\no O (M CM o O -<* O N {> t> \"* CO CO\r\ntH CM o CM \u00a3-- (M * 00 cs o CO o CM CO CD\r\nCD OS00\r\n00 iO\r\nOS\r\nto \u00a9? 1 r-l OCM oCM \u2014\r\nCO\r\nt> m-#iH\r\nCM CO CO\r\nCM O CD\r\nCO CM CM r '\r\n1 c\r\n-\r\nOS CM iC us o If)\r\ni\u2014i\r\n-\r\n1\r\n*a 00 US\r\nCO CO\r\nCO CM\r\n>o\r\n-.\r\nPL,\r\n2 ^ , o & a t\r\n8 & S \u00a7 ^ C ha Ph 5 \u00ab -S\r\nb; a, ^\r\n<J2 ~t<\r\ng\r\nC3 ^1\r\ns\r\n4 -g\r\n'OS'S\r\n5 ?.\r\ncs C CO C o OS o \u00a9 lO\r\n00\u2014\r\nu~ OS\r\nrH.

The new Committee consists of the President (ex officio),\r\nthe Hon. Editor. Dr T. W. Mitchell, Mr Whately Carington, Mr\r\nGerald Heard and Mr Oliver Gatty. This Committee has met and\r\nhas reported to the Council that it was desirable that a salaried\r\nofficial, to take office from the expiration of Mr Besterman's appointment, should be appointed, to work in conjunction with a Research Committee. After consulting leading psychologists at the\r\nUniversities, and other persons whose opinions might prove of value,\r\nthey have considered the names of possible candidates, and also the\r\nlines of research which could be most advantageously followed up at\r\nthe present time.\r\n(7) The Presidency. The Council elected the Hon. Mrs Alfred\r\nLyttelton, G.B.E., for a second term of office.\r\n(8) Changes among the Hon. Officers and Officers of the Society. In\r\nMay the Council appointed Miss Nea Walker as Hon. Editor of the\r\nJournal. The Council wish most cordially to thank Miss Walker for\r\nhaving undertaken this considerable task. Although Miss Walker\r\ngave her consent to the appointment on the understanding that it was a temporary arrangement, they hope that it may be a long time\r\nbefore she asks for other arrangements to be made.\r\nMiss Newton, who has been with the Society thirty-one years,\r\ninformed the Council that since her illness she was beginning to find\r\nthe office hours rather long. After discussion with her and Miss\r\nHorsell the Council arranged that Miss Horsell, who has consented\r\nto revert to full-time work, should take over the routine work of the\r\noffice, Miss Newton remaining Secretary of the Society and attending\r\nat the office for half-time only. The Council wish to place on record\r\ntheir warmest appreciation of the services already rendered by Miss\r\nNewton.\r\n(9) Changes on the Council. In April Mr Oliver Gatty, Mr Gerald\r\nHeard, and the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas were co-opted as members\r\nof Council.\r\n(10) New Hon. Associate. In February the Council, in recognition\r\nof the many services which the Rev. W. S. Irving had performed for\r\nthe Society, especially in connection with his investigations of Mrs\r\nLeonard, elected him an Hon. Associate of the Society.\r\n(11) Professor Driesclis Lecture. In October the Society had the\r\ngood fortune to hear a paper from Professor Hans Driesch, who was\r\nvisiting England to lecture at several universities. It is hoped that\r\nthe paper, the subject of which was \" Memory in Relation to\r\nPsychical Research \", will be printed in Proceedings.\r\n(12) Library. During the year 83 Members borrowed 431 books,\r\nFebruary 1935 Annual Report of the Council for 1934- 31\r\nand 59 books were borrowed by the National Central Library.\r\nSeveral Members availed themselves of the privilege of borrowing\r\nbooks from other libraries through the Society and the National\r\nCentral Library.\r\n(13) Obituary. During the past year the Society has sustained a heavy loss by the death of Dr Walter Franklin Prince, Research\r\nOfficer of the Boston S.P.R. and a Corresponding Member and\r\nex-President of our Society. Memorial Notices were published in\r\nPart 138 of Proceedings. Other members of long standing, whose\r\ndeaths must be recorded with regret, are : Mrs Barkworth, Lady\r\nDickinson Berry, Mrs Burrard, Professor Chattock, Dr Bernard\r\nHollander, Mrs Monypeny, Judge R. E. Moore, Mrs T. S. Perry, the\r\nDowager Lady Rayleigh, Mr R. G. Shewan, Mrs H. C. Tait, Princess\r\nMary of Thurn and Taxis, Mrs Walker-Munro and Mr Richard Wood.\r\nThe total number of deaths was eleven Members, nine Associates, one Honorary Member and one Corresponding Member.\r\n(14) Membership of the Society. During the year 47 new Members\r\nand two Student Associates were elected. The total loss in numbers\r\nfrom deaths, resignations and other causes was 43 Members and 23\r\nAssociates, leaving a net increase of five Members and a decrease of\r\n21 Associates. The total membership of the Society now stands\r\nat 743.\r\n(15) Publications. Six Parts of Proceedings were published during\r\nthe year : Part 133 in January, Part 134 in February, Part 135 in\r\nMay, Part 136 in July, Part 137 in October, and Part 138 in\r\nDecember.\r\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to \u00a368 Is. 7d.,\r\nand to members of the Society \u00a325 Os. lid. The returns from the\r\nSociety's agent in America amounted, after deduction of commission, to \u00a324 16s. 8d.\r\n(16) Meetings.

M.\r\nTyrrell.\r\n* General Meetings.\r\nREFLECTIONS ON THE MEDIUMSHIP OF\r\nRUDI SCHNEIDER\r\nBy Theodore Besterman\r\nThere is practically nothing I disagree with in Lord Charles Hope's\r\ncomments on our recent report on the S.P.R. sittings with Rudi\r\nSchneider, beyond the minor points already referred to by Mr Gatty.\r\nOur report merely set out facts in connection with a particular\r\ninvestigation, while Lord Charles Hope takes a wider view. His\r\nremarks have, however, led me to reconsider once again, from a still wider angle, the whole situation brought about by the history of\r\nRudi's mediumship. My own experience of it goes back to 1928, and\r\nI have had sittings with Rudi in the seance-rooms of SchrenckNotzhig in Munich, of the Institut Metapsychique in Paris, of Herr\r\nSchickl at Weyer, and of the S.P.R. , as well as sittings in Rudi's late\r\nhome at Braunau. In addition I have carefully studied the whole\r\nof the large literature produced by this mediumship, together with\r\nmuch unpublished material. I have also had opportunities to\r\nquestion a large number of people of all kinds who have had sittings\r\nwith Rudi under all sorts of conditions. My reflections on this\r\nmediumship may therefore be of some value.\r\nThe main point, and the only one I propose to touch on, is this : has Rudi ever produced paraphysical phenomena ? It seems astonishing to outside critics that this question has not yet been answered in a definitive way ; but there are excellent reasons for this uncertainty, reasons familiar to anyone who understands the conditions under\r\nwhich paraphysical sittings are held. When I am asked whether\r\nI have myself seen any phenomena at Rudi's sittings the genuineness\r\nof which seems to me beyond doubt, I answer without hesitation\r\n\" No \". But the subject does not lend itself to such categorical\r\naffirmatives and negatives. I should prefer to state my feelings in\r\nthese terms : \" While I am not prepared to vouch for the genuineness of any phenomenon I have seen, there are several I am unable\r\nto explain in normal terms.\"\r\n26 Sep.\r\n*24 Oct.\r\n28 Nov.\r\nFebruary 1935 Reflections on Mediumship of Riidi Schneider 33\r\nIt is of some importance to elucidate the implications of this state- ment. The obvious answer, an argument I have often used myself,\r\nis to say that ignorance of a technique does not imply its nonexistence. Because, for instance, I do not know how a fraud is carried out, it does not follow that fraud was not present. This is true, of course, as a general statement, but is again far too sweeping.\r\nIt would be absolutely true of a conjurer's performance on the stage,\r\nwhere the conditions are entirely in the performer's hands within the\r\nobvious limits. It is far less true of a sitting on my premises, under\r\nmy control, and with a medium unprovided with tools. In these\r\ncircumstances the obvious limitations are much greater, and it becomes possible to inquire whether inability to imagine how fraud\r\ncould take place does not conceivably carry with it the extreme\r\nimprobability of such fraud. Has this limit been reached in the\r\nsittings with Rudi ? But for one factor I should be somewhat\r\ninclined to think that it has. This factor is the extreme fallibility\r\nof human testimony. If human testimony, I mean of course the\r\ntestimony of honest and intelligent people, could be accepted at its face value, doubt about paraphysical phenomena could not possibly\r\nexist. This would be equally true if such testimony could be\r\naccepted even to the extent of a mere fifty or even twenty-five per\r\ncent. But we know that it cannot under the special conditions of a paraphysical sitting. Yet the testimony remains so good and so voluminous that I feel sometimes that a residuum of only five per\r\ncent, would clinch the matter.\r\nMy final conclusion, therefore, is that the reality of paraphysical\r\nphenomena must remain in doubt until further and more elaborate\r\ninvestigations into human testimony are carried out. It may be\r\nobjected that direct investigation is a more sensible course ; in\r\ntheory, yes, but hi practice, I very much fear not. The principle of\r\nindeterminacy seems to be of paramount importance here ; if paraphysical phenomena exist, nothing seems more certain than their\r\nfailure to appear when subjected to stringent tests.\r\nCASE\r\nP. 306. A Premonition\r\nMrs Dunlop, 50b Compton Avenue, Brighton, wrote as follows to\r\nthe President in February 1934 : \" On the night of October the 17th 1931 I dreamed that a man\r\ndied on the couch of my sitting-room. I did not recognise him\r\naltho' I saw him very plainly. I related my dream at breakfast to\r\n34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febkuaky 1935\r\nmembers of my family, which was a Sunday. My father-in-law came\r\nto supper that night and when starting for his home, he was taken\r\nill and we were unable to move him to bed. He died on the couch in\r\nmy sitting-room on Oct. 19th. He had not been attended by any\r\ndoctor and apparently only suffered from indigestion. It was\r\ntotally unexpected.\"\r\nMr Besterman wrote to Mrs Dunlop asking for corroborative\r\nstatements and for independent evidence of the death of her fatherin-law on the date in question. Mrs Dunlop, in reply, kindly sent\r\nstatements from her mother and her husband, and gave permission\r\nto use her account. Mrs Dunlop's mother writes as follows :\r\n\" March 21 1934\r\n6 Queens Park Terrace\r\nBrighton\r\n\" It is quite true that my daughter Mrs Dunlop who was living\r\nwith me at the time at 45 St Lukes Terrace, Brighton, told me of her\r\ndream. I was with her Father-in-law at the time he died on the\r\ncouch the next day.\r\n(Signed) E. Walter.\"\r\nMr Dunlop writes as follows : \" 50 Compton Avenue\r\nBrighton\r\n22. 3. 1934.\r\n\" This is to confirm the dream my wife had respecting the death\r\nof my Father. She related it to me the next morning at breakfast\r\nand the following day my Father died quite unexpectedly on mycouch.

M. N. Tyrrell in\r\nthe January issue of the Journal. I only regret that considerations\r\nof space necessitated so much compression. Might I suggest that\r\nMr Tyrrell would be rendering a great service to Psychical Research\r\nin general and our own society in particular were he to expand his\r\nsketch into a lengthier thesis. I sincerely hope he will find it possible to do this and I am sure he would earn the grateful thanks\r\nof all our members.\r\nWhile entirely agreeing with him that telepathy or clairvoyance\r\ncannot be \" explained \" by any \" radiation theory \", I do not think\r\nthat the second argument he advances against such a theory is entirely sound in the way he has stated it. I refer to his point about\r\nthe intensity of radiation varying inversely as the square of the distance. In some types of radiation other factors than mere distance\r\nmay intervene and quite mask the effect of distance as such, and so, apparently, torpedo the Law of Inverse Squares completely. Take,\r\nfor example, the phenomenon of what is generally known as \" shortwave wireless \". It is by no means true that the strength of the\r\nsignal received from a short-wave transmitting station varies\r\ninversely as the distance. I did some experimenting in this field a few years ago and the account of one test I made will illustrate my\r\npoint\r\n:\r\nMy transmitting station was in Tientsin, China, and using low\r\npower (about 50 watts) and a wavelength of 30 metres the same test signals were heard and reported by wireless stations in the following\r\nplaces : Chefoo - - 180 miles distant No signals audible.\r\nShanghai - - 800 ,, Signal strength r 6\r\n(Signal strength is roughly graded hi wireless by the numerical\r\ncode \/\u2022 1 to r 9. r 1 is barely audible, r 9 blasts the \"phones.)\r\nThus the strengths of the signals received in different places seem\r\nto contradict entirely the \" inverse square \" law. The nearest\r\nNew South Wales 6,000\r\nNew Zealand - 7,500\r\nArgentine - - 15,000 (antipodes)\r\nr3\r\nr 5\r\nr 7\r\n36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1935\r\nstation got no signals at all (known as \" skip distance effect \".) The\r\nloudest signals were actually received at the furthest possible distance on the earth's surface from the transmitter.\r\nThe explanation is, of course, that there are other factors that\r\ndetermine the strength of wireless signals, e.g. the wave-length used,\r\nthe weather, the time of day, the varying absorption effects of\r\ndifferent kinds of earth surface, the reflection from the \" Heaviside\r\nLayer \" and other ionisation effects in the upper atmosphere, etc. Now I imagine that a protagonist for a radiation theory for tele- pathy or clairvoyance could claim the existence of unknown factors\r\nthat would, in an analogous way, lead to very contradictory results\r\nwhen the effect of distance was being considered. There might even be some sort of \" skip distance effect \" or recipients might show\r\nsometimes better results when they were further away from the\r\nagent or transmitter. I am by no means such a protagonist. After\r\nreading Mr Tyrrell's paper I do not think a radiation theory has a\r\nleg to stand on. All the more therefore I do not wish there should be\r\nan opportunity presented for anyone to rig up an artificial leg\r\nbecause of a too-easy theorising of the jtrobable effect of distance\r\nbetween the Agent or Object and the Percipient.\r\nI am, Yours, etc.,\r\nG.

The President in the Chair.\r\nThe following members were present : Dr Margaret Balfour, Mr E.\r\nBatchelor, Miss Carruthers, Mr H. S. Collins, Dr E. J. Dingwall,\r\nProfessor E. R. Dodds, Mr G. W. Fisk, Miss Fleming, Miss Foot,\r\nProfessor D. F. Fraser-Harris, Mrs D. F. Fraser-Harris, Mrs Goldney,\r\nMr N. Harding, Miss Jephson, Miss G. M. Johnson. Mr I. B. Nicholl,\r\nDr J. V.

Thurston (Associate).\r\nThe Secretary having read the Notice convening the Meeting,\r\nthe Hon. Secretary moved the adoption of the Annual Report,\r\nwhich was seconded by Professor E. R. Dodds and carried unanimously.\r\nIn presenting the Accounts for the year, Mr Salter, Acting Hon.\r\nTreasurer, dealt with the financial position of the Society. For the\r\nsecond year in succession he had to report a slight increase in the\r\nnumber of members, which indicated that there was a real recovery\r\nfrom the \" slump \" of 1931-1932. The number of Associates was of\r\ncourse declining, as no new Associates, except Student Associates, were being elected. There was a small shrinkage in the Society's\r\nincome from investments, and on the American subscriptions owing\r\nto the rate of exchange. So far as its ordinary income and expenditure were concerned the Society was holding its own.\r\nIt remained true that the Society's ordinary income (mainly\r\nderived from subscriptions and investments) after payment of over-\r\n40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1935\r\nhead expenses, printing, etc., left only a small margin for research,\r\nand that for any research on a large scale the Society was dependent on special donations. They had received in 1934, several generous\r\ngifts, among which he might mention Mr Gatty's gift of money and\r\nappliances (and also of his own technical knowledge) and the\r\nanonymous donation of \u00a31000. The Hon. Secretary referred to Mr\r\nBesterman's American tour, and to the programme of Research\r\nundertaken by the Council when Mr Besterman had resigned his post.\r\nHe also mentioned the redistribution of work in the office and paid a\r\ntribute to Miss Newton's work over so many years, congratulating\r\nthe Society on being able to retain her services, though no longer for\r\nfull time.\r\nIn the discussion that followed Mrs Goldney and Dr Dingwall also\r\npaid warm tributes to Miss Newton. Dr Dingwall praised Mr\r\nWhately Carington's work and said he was very glad the Council were supporting it. The work was difficult and no sensational\r\nresults were to be expected, but it was really scientific in aim and\r\nmethod. He also spoke warmly of Mr Besterman's work in re- organising the Library : he had not approved of the American tour,\r\nbut would like to know what report Mr Besterman had made on\r\nMirabelli.\r\nThe President, Mrs Salter, and Mr Saltmarsh gave an account of\r\nsome of the research work in progress, particularly the psychological\r\nstudy of Leonard records undertaken by Mr Kenneth Richmond,\r\nwho had great practical and theoretical knowledge of psychology,\r\nand the experimental work in extra-sensory perception which Mr\r\nTyrrell was carrying out with appliances specially designed. Hearty\r\napproval followed on a reference to the great amount of time and\r\ntrouble which the retiring President (Dame Edith Lyttelton) had,\r\nnotwithstanding her important public engagements, devoted to the\r\nSociety's work during two difficult years. The meeting closed with\r\na vote of thanks to the Hon. Secretary, proposed by Mr Saltmarsh and\r\nseconded by Dr Dingwall.\r\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for\r\nelection to membership of the Council other than the six members\r\nwho retired by rotation. The following six members were re-elected\r\naccordingly : Mr W. R. Bousfield, Professor E. R. Dodds, the Hon.\r\nMrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., Miss Ina Jephson, Dr F. C. S. Schiller\r\nand Dr M. B. Wright.\r\nMessrs Hartleys, Wilkins, Avery and Flew were re-elected Auditors\r\nfor the forthcoming year.\r\nMarch 1935 Correspondence 41\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I thank Mr G. W. Fisk for his very kind and appreciative remarks about my paper on Normal and Supernormal\r\nPerception ? The point he raises about the inverse-square law of radiation seems to me to be based upon a misapprehension of what that law\r\nactually means. The interesting experience he describes shows\r\nhow irregularly wireless energy can be distributed about the earth's\r\nsurface ; but surely this does not entitle one to say that this \" tor- pedoes \" or \" contradicts \" the law of inverse-square distribution ! That law does not state that radiant energy always varies in intensity\r\ninversely as the square of the distance from the source. It means\r\n(whether this is explicitly stated or not) that it does so only when\r\nthe medium is uniform. Very often it is not uniform : there are\r\nreflecting, refracting or absorptive substances within the space\r\nrelevant to the transmission. This is the case inside a telescope or\r\na speaking-tube, and no one expects the inverse-square law to be\r\nobeyed in such cases as these. And it would be a complete misapprehension of the meaning of the law to say that telescopes and\r\nspeaking-tubes \" contradict \" it. The erratic distribution of wireless energy which Mr Fisk describes is only another example on a\r\nlarger scale of what is happening in an optical or acoustic instrument\r\n:\r\nand I do not suppose that he or anyone doubts that wireless waves\r\nobey the inverse-square law when the medium is uniform.\r\nWhat Mr Fisk means to suggest in the present case, if I understand him rightly, is that telepathy and clairvoyance may be\r\ntransmitted by some form of radiant energy for which there exist\r\ndistorting factors about the world of a similar kind to those which\r\nexist for wireless energy. Such an assumption, being an unsupported\r\npostulate, cannot be disproved ; but I think the following considerations will show that there is not much in the suggestion.\r\nSet up a short-wave wireless receiver at distances of, say, 10, 100,\r\n500 yards and a mile from the transmitter, and measure the energy\r\nin the receiving aerial. The inverse-square law will be approximately verified in practice in spite of the Heaviside layer and other\r\nlong-distance distorting factors. So with telepathy. Whatever\r\nfactors there might be which distorted it at long distances, it is pretty safe to say that we should get an unmistakable gradation\r\nof effects at quite short ranges, if the transmission were physical.\r\nWhen agent and percipient were sitting with their heads a few\r\ninches apart, there would be a far more striking result than when\r\nthey were in adjoining rooms ; and this would be more striking\r\n42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1935\r\nagain than when they were at opposite ends of the town. In fact,\r\nif telepathy were a physical effect, I think it would have forced\r\nitself upon the attention of mankind long ago, even though unsought.\r\nAnd the same with clairvoyance. Yours etc.,\r\nG. N. M. Tyrrell.\r\nREVIEWS\r\nJ. W. Dunne. The Serial Universe. Pp. 242. London : Faber &\r\nFaber. Price 10s. 6d.\r\nIn this book Mr Dunne develops further the theory which he\r\noriginally propounded in his earlier work, \" An Experiment with\r\nTime \". It falls into three parts ; in the first he gives a comprehensive and lucid exposition of the theory of Serialism and sets forth the general grounds on which it is based. In the second Mr\r\nDunne further elaborates his thesis and subjects it to the test of\r\ngeneral application, he illustrates his points by means of a system of\r\ndiagrams which certainly add greatly to ease of comprehension.\r\nIn the third part he applies his theory to several of the concepts\r\nof modern physics, viz. relativity, the quantum theory, Heisenberg's\r\nprinciple of uncertainty, etc. He claims that the view he advocates,\r\nviz. an infinite regressive series of times in which the time of one\r\nstage becomes an extra spatial dimension of the next, together with an infinite series of Observers, not only fits in perfectly with these\r\nconcepts but also affords an explanation of them.\r\nIt seems to me that it is this section of the book which will give\r\nmost difficulty to the ordinary reader. Unless one is fairly well\r\nversed in the more recent advances of mathematical physics many\r\nof the arguments must remain obscure in spite of the really excellent\r\nexplanations which Mr Dunne gives.\r\nFrom the special point of view of psychical research the main\r\ninterest is the author's claim to demonstrate the immortality of the\r\nObserver. I cannot help feeling, however, that very few readers will\r\nbe able to rest a solid belief in survival on the sole foundation of\r\nwhat is, after all, a finely spun web of metaphysical argument. For\r\nmyself I always have a certain feeling of mistrust for proofs of what\r\nmust be \" ; what I want to know is \" what is \" . Metaphysical argument is always a fragile thing and terribly open to destructive criticism.\r\nAs illustrating the uncertainty of conclusions resting thereon it is curious that Mr Dunne in one place employs a line of reasoning\r\nwhich had already been used by McTaggart, but derives therefrom\r\na conclusion diametrically opposite to his, viz. that there is an\r\ninfinite series of times, whereas McTaggart concludes that there is no time at all .\r\nMarch 1935 Reviews 43\r\nAs regards the main point of all Mr Dunne's work, viz. the theory\r\nof Serialism, this is not the place to enter upon any discussion of his\r\nreasoning, though I think that I should say that I cannot find\r\nmyself able to accept it. However the book is worthy of study by all interested in the more\r\nphilosophic side of psychical research, and even if lack of special\r\nmathematical training may prevent them from appreciating some of\r\nthe arguments, the main part of the book is so clearly written and\r\nthe various points so well illustrated that they should have no\r\ndifficulty in understanding the theory and forming an opinion as to\r\nits validity.

Price 3s. 6d. net.\r\nIt is clear that Psychical Research remains the most refractory of\r\nsciences because it is possessed of a double nature. To-day most\r\nsciences are becoming unpleasantly aware that their own natures\r\nare not pure or single. The observer cannot be kept out of the\r\npicture which physics now tries to give of the universe, and those\r\nsciences which try to prevent his shadow falling on their virgin\r\nwhiteness are, it would seem, attempting the impossible. Sooner\r\nof later they will all have to confess to a relativity in their descriptions which will cast a penumbra of doubt over their first brightconfident certainties. This, however, is little comfort to psychical\r\nresearchers\u2014to know that even the most detached sciences are getting involved with subjective problems. The intention of those\r\nwho determined to explore this border-land subject was to bring it under the dominion of science, and they would hardly feel compensated for this failure by seeing all the other sciences lapse toward the\r\nborder-land from which they hoped to rescue their chosen study.\r\nYet this seems the present trend of all science, and if it continues\r\nit looks as though it will end by making all science as difficult as psychical research, not an alternative which the first researchers in\r\nthat subject hoped.\r\nIs there any way out ? There does seem one possible path, a path\r\nin the true tradition of science and yet one of great difficulty. We\r\nneed not, however, think that it is impossible, for it is the path which\r\nall advanced researchers in the other sciences are beginning to survey\r\nas the route which may well lead them out of their present impasse.\r\nIt is not impossible that the same method of detached examination\r\nwhich made the first period of objective science so fruitful, may be,\r\n44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1935\r\napplied with equal success to the instrument of observation as it has\r\nbeen to the subject of observation. We now realise that our psychophysical organism is such that it cannot present us with data but\r\nrather with constructions, with instantaneous concepts rather than\r\nwith direct unvarnished percepts. As Mr Tyrrell pointed out in his\r\npaper read before the Society, the problem of apprehension to-day is far better understood than formerly, and we are beginning to analyse\r\nnot merely the \" objective fact \" but how that \" fact \" was carried\r\ninto and conveyed to our consciousness. In earlier times people\r\nknew, with the assurance of ignorance, that there was only one way\r\nof taking in the world, and that any other impressions which might\r\ncome into consciousness must be hallucinatory, purely subjective.\r\nNow, however, with a new knowledge of the capacities of the instrument which we have to employ to give us impressions of the outer\r\nworld, we are beginning to realise that whereas no impression of the\r\nouter world can be free of an element of subjective construction, so no impression in the mind can be dismissed as being wholly caused\r\nby and wholly explicable through subjective elements. As the\r\nastronomer when he wishes to see other stars than those at present\r\nin the telescope's focus alters the aperture, so it is possible that we\r\nmay alter the aperture of the mind if we wish to concentrate on\r\ncertain conditions which are not those observed, and only necessary\r\nto be observed, in the economic world, in the task of getting daily\r\nbread. Indeed it seems as though we must explore how this may\r\nbe done if we are to advance any further in our subject.\r\nIt is this consideration which makes Miss Coster's book of importance to psychical researchers. Here is an attempt to link on\r\nto our present knowledge of the working of the mind the \" field work \" done for centuries by Indian introspection. The Indian work\r\ncould not be seriously considered until our own psychology by its discovery of the subjective mind had found out how deep lie the\r\nsources of action in the psycho-physical organism, how powerful\r\nthey are and what an elaborate, patient and strange technique is required if the doors are to be opened and access to the power\r\nhouse obtained. This book is short, clear, concise, though dealing\r\nwith a subject which all who have read in it may be forgiven for\r\nfeeling could never attain to any of these desiderata. It is first of\r\nall addressed to those who wish to understand themselves\u2014those\r\nwho go to the psycho-analyst not to understand abstractly how the\r\nworld is apprehended but how to manage their own lives\u2014but,\r\nnaturally, in this subject the other side, how reality is apprehended,\r\ncannot be disregarded. There must be a converse to gnothi\r\nseauton\u2014\" understand the outer world fully and you will under-\r\nMarch 1935 Reviews 45\r\nstand yourself \". It looks then as though when psycho-analysis\r\nbecomes less concerned with the individual's problems and more\r\nwith the task of widening and varying the aperture of apprehension\r\nnot only may therapeutics enter on a new and more fruitful development, but psychical research and indeed all science gain a new and\r\nessential instrument. No one can read this book without feeling\r\nthat this is at least possible, that this path should be explored and\r\nthat the methods here recommended are both scientific and promising. G. H.\r\nWhately Carington, Three Essays on Consciousness. (Reprinted\r\nfrom the London Forum.) 30 pp.\r\nThere is one thing upon which one can rely when reading anything\r\nfrom the pen of Mr Whately Carington, and that is that one will not\r\nhave served up a rehash of stale topics and arguments, but good, fresh,\r\nstimulating food for thought, rendered all the more palatable by the\r\ndash of \" sauce piquante \" which is infused by what he himself once\r\ndescribed as verbal caracoles.\r\nThese three essays constitute a courageous and valuable attempt\r\nto tackle some of the problems arising from consciousness ; they are\r\nnot, and of course could not be, intended to deal with the subject\r\nin any exhaustive fashion. Mr Carington has simply picked out\r\nthree outstanding points and concentrated on them. His fundamental datum is stated in the proposition, \" I am conscious \", the\r\ntruth of which will be allowed by all but the extreme behaviourist.\r\nHe then argues that, because it has been found impossible to fix the\r\nline between living and non-living matter, consciousness is universal.\r\nIt seems to me that there is an hiatus in his reasoning here ; he assumes without discussion that consciousness is always con- comitant with life. I do not say that he is wrong, but I certainly\r\nthink that the gap should be filled. An unconscious living being\r\nmay be an impossibility, but the assumption that it is so should\r\nnot be made without some comment.\r\nI am afraid that I must also attempt to pick holes in his main\r\nargument. He says, \" If life is closely connected with chemicals,\r\nthen chemicals are closely connected with life \". But surely this\r\nshould be. \" Life is closely connected with some chemicals \". The\r\nonly conclusion to be drawn from this is that some chemicals are\r\nclosely connected with life. This is a particular proposition and, the\r\nundistributed term being chemicals, it follows that no conclusion in\r\nwhich this term is distributed can be drawn from this premise.\r\nMr Carington's conclusion is an universal proposition.\r\n46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1935\r\nIn his second essay Mr Carington seeks to establish the theory of an Universal Consciousness or World Soul. I think that it is a little unfortunate that the same term \" universal \" should be used in two\r\ndistinct senses. He tries to show in the first essay that consciousness\r\nis universal in the sense that all that exists, down to the ultimate\r\nconstituents of being, is to some extent conscious. What he now\r\nmeans by \" universal \" is that all these \" discatenated individual \"\r\nconsciousnesses are really in some way one. These two meanings do\r\nnot imply each other.\r\nHe develops several lines of argument, notably from community\r\nof experience, from paragnostic phenomena and from mysticism,\r\nand he undoubtedly succeeds in putting up quite a good case ; though,\r\nas he himself admits, the alternative theory of an external world can never be disproved in toto. At the very outset of these essays Mr Carington justly points out\r\nthe necessity of examining our preliminary assumptions. I think\r\nthat perhaps in this second essay he has allowed at least one assumption to escape him, viz. that any terms which we can employ, any\r\nmental machinery, processes of reasoning, concepts, etc., are adequate\r\nto deal with ultimate reality. It may be that the only answer\r\navailable to us is that of the Vedantist, \" Neti, Neti (Not so, Not so)\u2014that is to say, complete and total agnosticism.\r\nMoreover, I personally can form no clear idea of what is meant by\r\nan universal consciousness. I can construct a formula which seems,\r\nprima facie, intelligible, such as an unitary consciousness (unitary in\r\nsomewhat the same way as I normally feel myself to be an unit)\r\nwhich embraces and includes all other individual consciousnesses\r\nwithout destroying their individuality. But when I come to examine\r\nthis concept more closely I find that it evades my understanding, for\r\nthe reason that it seems to transcend the categories of number,\r\nsameness and difference and to confuse the distinction between the one and the many.\r\nIt is quite possible, in fact it seems to me probable, that these\r\ncategories are transcended in ultimate reality, but I cannot reach\r\nsuch heights myself. I believe that some of the advanced mathematical physicists\u2014I think it was Dirac\u2014have put forward a theory\r\nwhich might be called the indeterminacy of individuality. Thus,\r\nthough I admit that it is quite possible that Mr Carington is correct,\r\nI feel quite lost when I attempt to think of myself as I know myself\r\nas being only a part of another larger self which I do not know.\r\nHowever the fact that I cannot grasp the idea is no reason whatsoever for supposing that it is wrong or that others cannot grasp it. In his third essay Mr Carington sketches an outline of the evol-\r\nMarch 1935 Reviews 47\r\nution of the individual consciousness by successive differentiations\r\nand traces a parallel between it and the evolution of the physical\r\nuniverse as now conceived by modern physics.\r\nHis suggestions remind me somewhat of Herbert Spencer's famous\r\nformula.\r\nIf what I have said above may seem to be mainly criticism it is not because I do not appreciate these essays. I consider that they\r\nare a most valuable contribution towards the understanding of a very difficult subject, the most difficult perhaps because the most\r\nfamiliar as well as the most fundamental of all with which science\r\nand philosophy have to deal. I hope Mr Carington will carry his\r\nanalysis further and elucidate the meaning of the two remaining\r\nterms of his fundamental datum, viz. \" I \" and \" am.\"\r\nH. F.

N. M. Tyrrell\r\nThe following experiments form a belated sequel to the experiments\r\nwith cards which were carried out by Miss Johnson and myself in\r\n1921, and which were reported in the Journal S.P.R. for June 1922\r\nunder the title, The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. This title was\r\nscarcely pseudonymous, for \" Sinclair \" is one of Miss Johnson's\r\nreal names, and \" Nancy \" is the name by which she is familiarly\r\nknown to her friends. The suppression of the surname was merely\r\nher fancy at the time.\r\nI would direct the reader's attention especially to the cardexperiments on pp. 318-327, since these acquire a retrospective\r\ninterest in the light of those we are now publishing. It will be seen that in most cases these card-experiments reach high anti-chance\r\nprobabilities, and that some of them were apparently precognitive.\r\nI feel an absolute personal conviction that they were perfectly genuine cases of paranormal faculty. The cards, which I had just\r\nshuffled and cut on another table, were in all cases lying before me in a pack face downwards on the table in full light, and I watched them\r\nas closely as a cat watches a mouse. Miss Johnson sat beside me in\r\nApril 1935 Experiments iv Extra-Sensory Perception 53\r\na state of strained concentration, often with her face buried in her\r\nhands. Could even an expert conjurer, under these conditions, have\r\nplaced extra cards on the pack before me right under my nose without my noticing it \\ If so, it would have been a wonderful feat : but\r\nI am certain that Miss Johnson, who had no skill whatever in the\r\nmanipulation of cards, could not possibly have done so. Unfortunately, these results were obtained under conditions of\r\nvery great nervous strain, and it would have been disastrous to continue under these circumstances. For years afterwards there was\r\nno opportunity of resuming work of this kind. At last, however, a\r\nfresh opportunity has presented itself, and we have started again\r\nwith improved methods.\r\nBefore describing the recent experiments, I must say a few words\r\nabout the percipient. I and my family have known Miss Johnson\r\nintimately since 1920, and there is no one in whose complete candour\r\nand integrity I have greater faith. Not only is she a thoroughly\r\nreliable and level-headed person in the affairs of ordinary life, but\r\nshe has developed the rare faculty of self-discipline and self-analysis\r\nwith regard to her paranormal faculty. She can distinguish to a considerable extent the alloy of the mind's contribution from the\r\nparanormal gold ; and she is moreover very critical with regard to\r\npsychic phenomena in general. She combines the outlook of the\r\ninvestigator with the faculty of the sensitive. Her paranormal or parapsychic faculty has long ago. for me, proved its existence bypassing the pragmatic test of being useful in daily life. To doubt\r\nthe existence of what one habitually makes use of is, I think, to\r\nplace oneself in rather a curious logical position. But the type of\r\nproof which is amenable to mathematical analysis is, of course,\r\nneeded as well : and this, it is hoped, the present experiments\r\nsupply.\r\nI do not think that either of the terms \" Supernormal Perception \"\r\nor \" Extra-Sensory Perception \" (Dr Rhine's term) are quite the\r\nright ones to apply to a faculty like Miss Johnson's. Her power\r\nstrikes one as being very wide in its scope and as being much more\r\nlike what a French writer describes as an \" assimilation globale des\r\nevenements \" than like what we usually call \" perception \". In the\r\nterrible terminology which people invent for psychical research, perhaps \" parapsychic cognition \" would describe this diffused faculty\r\nof getting to know things in general : but I prefer the simpler term\r\n\" Extra-Sensory Perception \", even if it is not the most exact, partly\r\nbecause it reduces easily to the three euphonious initials, E.S.P.\r\nOur present method of research began by my hiding a small object\r\nwhile Miss Johnson was out of the room and by her finding it when\r\n54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1935\r\nshe came back ; and this, although a seemingly childish game, had\r\nmore in it than appears at first sight . For one thing, the act of finding the object awakened in the percipient a feeling of inward satisfaction which was very marked, and this I took to be an important\r\nlead. It induced the right state of psychological interest. No doubt\r\nthis pleasure in finding things is a psychological idiosyncrasy of the\r\npercipient s, but I have always believed that the fundamental problem in psychical research is a psychological one\u2014that is to sav that\r\nit consists largely in helping the material to emerge and to overcome\r\nthose barriers which evidently interpose themselves in the way of its externalisation. There are no well defined routes ready prepared for\r\nthe emergence of E.S.P. material as there are for the results of\r\nnormal perception, or for motor and normal sensory complexes : it must borrow the sensory routes and use them as an interloper. Consequently, the first thing to do is to make its route as easy for it as\r\npossible : and to do this one must induce in the percipient the most\r\nfavourable psychological state.\r\nIt is of little use to devise evidentially water-tight conditions unless\r\nthese include the conditions under which the phenomenon one wants\r\nto investigate can take place : therefore it is wise to adopt a form\r\nof experiment which creates interest in the percipient.\r\nAnother factor was this\u2014I knew that Miss Johnson had always\r\nhad great difficulty in expressing any paranormal feeling in words.\r\nShe could not, for example, tell me where a hidden object was : but\r\nshe could go and find it. It is fairly obvious that the act of putting\r\nany thought into words calls for a certain amount of conscious attention : and this is not compatible with the sort of emotional-impulsefactor which seems always to form part of a paranormal impression.\r\nOne can always see in Miss Johnson the little impulsive, emotional\r\naccompaniment to any genuinely paranormal feeling. And to ask\r\nher to put the cognitive element of this into words is a little like\r\nhanding a person a book of rules in a sudden emergency and asking\r\nhim to look up the best thing to do. One cannot fit one's mind to\r\npages and phrases when an emotional urge to do something is stirring\r\nin one. It is much easier to do something active. And I think in a minor way, the same sort of thing applies to the emergence of paranormal knowledge. Action is an easier mode of externalisation than\r\nspeech. Therefore, I thought, would it not be a good thing if I could\r\ndevise some sort of experiment in which the percipient had to find\r\nsomething ? A further psychological consideration was that inhibitory associations are much more likely to be connected with words than with\r\nsimple actions.\r\nApbil 1935 Experiments in Extra -Sensory Perception 55\r\nSo I set myself the task of trying to discover a way in which this\r\ngame of hide-and-seek might be turned into a quantitative experiment. I first took five 1 empty match-boxes, putting a little cottonwool into the bottom of each to deaden sounds, and told Miss\r\nJohnson to go out of the room while I hid a small object\u2014actually a die\u2014in one of the boxes. Then, shutting and moving all the boxes,\r\nI asked her to come in and point to the box in which she thought the\r\ndie was hidden. In this way she began to score rather above chance\r\nexpectation, but the method was slow and laborious and the matchboxes began to come to pieces, so I decided to make a better arrangement. I constructed five small, wooden boxes placed in a row with\r\nsloping lids overlapping the sides and facing the percipient. Behind\r\nthem was a large, wooden screen on the other side of which the agent,\r\nor operator was seated, completely screened from the percipient.\r\nThe backs of the boxes were arranged so as to be open towards the\r\noperator, who was provided with a long, flat pointer. The \" hiding \"\r\nof the object could now be done quickly by the operator thrusting\r\nhis pointer into one of the boxes ; the \" finding \" was done by the\r\npercipient raising one of the box-lids and looking in to' see if the\r\npointer was there. This was simple, and satisfied the demand for\r\npsychological interest. Two difficulties, however, remained to be\r\novercome. One was that the percipient must not be able to hear the\r\npointer being thrust into the box. The other was that the operator,\r\nseated behhid the screen, must be able to check what the percipient\r\nwas doing.\r\nNeither of these difficulties proved to be great in practice. The\r\nboxes were lined with spongy rubber covered with soft flannelette,\r\nand the pointer was made from a thin strip of flat wood, rounded at\r\nthe end and highly polished. Under these circumstances, the sound\r\nof the pointer entering a box was so reduced as to be quite inaudible on the other side of the screen. The check on the percipient was\r\neasily secured by having a strong light on the percipient's side of the\r\nscreen. Each time a box was opened the light coming through it was\r\nvisible to the operator, who could see which box was opened, and\r\nthat only one box was opened at a time. All the operator had to do\r\nwas to record each trial as a success or a failure.\r\nThis apparatus proved to be very simple and convenient. Not\r\nonly did it fulfil the object in view by allowing the percipient to\r\nexpress her paranormal knowledge by means of a simple action and\r\nwithout the need for speech ; but it also allowed the trials to be performed very quickly. We found in fact that a hundred trials could\r\nbe made in from 3J to 4 minutes. This has two important advan1 1 owe the number \" five \" to Dr Rhine's work.\r\n56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Aphil 1035\r\ntages. (1) It allows the impulse-fsLCtov in the paranormal cognition\r\nto act without hindrance ; there is not much time for the feeling\r\nwhich, e.g. indicates No. 4 box to be altered by association of ideas to\r\nsome other number. The hand has merely to flick up the lid of the\r\nbox, which falls back by its own weight. (2) It forms a very quick\r\nway of testing any subject for significance ; for one can soon reach\r\nsuch a large number of trials that even a small paranormal factor will\r\nshow itself. The Experiments. These were quite simple. The apparatus was\r\nplaced with a strong light on the percipient's side. The operator\r\nthrust the pointer into one hole at a time at random, saying the word\r\n\" In \" each time. On hearing the word \" In \", the percipient opened\r\none of the box-lids. The operator, noticing which box the light\r\ncame through, scored the result on squared paper, making a tick for a success and a dot for a failure. If more than one box-lid was ever opened at a time the trial was scored a failure. It was not considered\r\nnecessary to note how many times each number was selected, either\r\nby the operator or by the percipient. The question of the operator's\r\npossible number-habits will be discussed later : and the percipient's\r\nnumber-habits (if any) could not be effective in raising the score. It became evident after a little working with this apparatus that\r\nthe paramount necessity was speed. When genuine E.S.P. is at\r\nwork, each \" guess \" is accompanied by a powerful urge towards\r\nimmediate externalisation. Anything which delays or thwarts this\r\nurge may lead to its being replaced by a semi-conscious guess.\r\nFor convenience, the experiments were broken up into blocks of\r\n100 trials each. We usually did about six blocks at a sitting.\r\nThe experiments were begun on 10 October 1934, and the results\r\nhere given extend to 20 February 1935, which brings us to a romid\r\ntotal of 30,000 trials. Of these 9,364 were successes ; that is to say\r\nthe successes are 31-21 per cent, of the total number of trials. Since\r\nthe probability of success at each trial is \\, the chance expectation\r\nof successes in 30,000 trials is 6,000, or 20 per cent. This has been\r\nvery greatly exceeded.\r\nThe best way to show the results and general course of events at a\r\nglance is to plot them in the form of a graph, and one is given on pages\r\n60-61. Each unit of the abscissae represents 100 trials, while the\r\nordinates represent percentage successes. Each point of the graph\r\ntherefore shows the number of successes which were scored in that\r\nparticular block of 100 trials. By plotting the results in this way we\r\ncan see how the average success varied with changing conditions.\r\nFor instance, vertical, dotted lines represent the presence of visitors.\r\nChain-dotted lines represent trials in which the numbers were not\r\nApril 1935 Experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception 57\r\nchosen by myself. One section shows where lamps were used in the\r\nboxes instead of the pointer : (Full lines.) A period of illness on the\r\npart of the percipient is shown, and the important \" light feelings \" : (Short dotted lines.) The horizontal line drawn at the 20-mark\r\nshows the average chance expectation of success. It will be seen from the graph how very variable the results are. Even at the same\r\nsitting, the scoring may oscillate between 26 and 41 : and both I as operator and Miss J . as percipient have the same feeling that there is something which keeps catching on and letting go again. The successes tend to go in \" runs \" or batches with more or less blank spaces\r\nbetween. On the whole, the tendency is for the scoring to improve\r\nduring a sitting, but this is not always so. With this great variability in the results, it is difficult to deduce\r\nfrom the graph what factors have affected the scoring. I only feel reasonably confident about the following points. High scoring is promoted by (1) Good health, and absence of worries and petty annoyances and by general cheerfulness : (2) by the \" light feeling \", (L on\r\nthe graph) which in its turn is favoured by (1) ; (3) by that tendency\r\ntowards dissociation, which Miss J. refers to as \" losing herself \" in\r\nthe experiments. In addition to this, any stimulus to interest, such\r\nas particular success, tends to raise scoring. A necessary condition\r\nfor good results is also that the percipient must feel completely at\r\nease. Even a slight circumstance which clouds the serenity of the\r\nmind, whether it be a slight jarring with the personality of someone\r\npresent, or an irritating sound, or a feeling that someone is in a\r\nhurry, or even a new feature in the material conditions of the experiment, will upset this condition. In ordinary life we overcome these\r\nthings by a slight effort of will ; but the investigator has to re- member that they will have their effect on the material of E.S.P.\r\nbefore the will can act on them. That is why the demands of a\r\nsensitive must be listened to. There is no reason why they should\r\nnot be reconciled with leak-proof evidential conditions.\r\nThe condition referred to as the \" light feeling \" is a very difficult one to define : yet it is important, for it is a sure indication that the\r\nparanormal faculty is in the ascendant. From the subjective standpoint, its ingredients probably include happiness, a feeling of being a little above and aloof from the material organism, and a quickening\r\nof all the mental faculties. If one can imagine such a thing, I should\r\nsay that what I referred to above as the \" emotional impulse \"\r\nspreads itself over the period during which the \" light feeling \" lasts. Miss Johnson has told me at such times that other people's logical\r\nways of arriving at conclusions seem to her to be irritatingly slow.\r\nShe has got there in a flash before them.\r\n58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1935\r\nFor the rest, the highest score reached in any block of 100 trials was 51 . The lowest was 14. And it will be seen that only on 12\r\noccasions out of 300 did the score go below 20.\r\nPossible Explanations of the Results\r\n(1 ) Chance. A glance at the graph is really sufficient to show that\r\nthe results are not due to chance. But this must be demonstrated\r\nmore formally. If pure chance were the only determining factor, we\r\nshould expect the successes to average J, or 20 per cent., of the trials. The points on the graph would be distributed equally above and\r\nbelow the 20-line. With a small number of trials the successes might\r\ndeviate considerably from A of the trials, and yet be all due to\r\nchance ; but as the number of trials is increased, any given deviation\r\nfrom the Rvalue becomes more and more improbable.\r\nWe want some measure of this ; that is to say we want to know\r\nwhat is the probability that, with a given number of trials, our successes will deviate to any given extent from the J-value. This measure is given to us by the mathematics of Probability. The\r\ndeviation may be positive or negative. If there is some factor at\r\nwork tending to raise the results above chance value, we shall find a\r\n\u2022positive deviation greater than chance can reasonably be held\r\nresponsible for. If, on the other hand, there is a factor at work\r\ntending to depress the results below the chance value, we shall find a similar negative deviation. In the present case there is no evidence\r\nof a depressive factor. The few below-chance scores which show\r\nthemselves may be regarded as due to chance acting alone, the\r\nelevating factor being in abeyance.\r\nIf d is the deviation from chance-expectation.\r\nand a is what is called the Standard Error,\r\nthen - is a quantity called X.\r\na\r\nThe Probability, P, which we require is the integral of a fimction\r\nof X, called the Probability Integral. These Probability Integrals\r\nhave been worked out and are given in tables in books dealing with\r\nthe subject of probability. I am here taking my figures from the\r\ntables given on p. 7-1 of Dr R. A. Fisher's Statistical Methods for\r\nResearch Workers.\r\nThe Standard Deviation or Standard Error = a=Vnpq\r\nwhere n=tke number of trials,\r\np =the probability of success at each trial = j,\r\n2 = the probability of failure =f,\r\nPH then = 0-16. so that a= V0-16 n,\r\nand therefore X= \u2014\r\nV0-16 n\r\nApril 1935 Experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception 59\r\nWe can find from the tables the value of P corresponding to any\r\nvalue of X.\r\nThere is, however, something else to be decided. What value of\r\nP shall we say is sufficiently low to rule out chance as a reasonable\r\nexplanation ? In other words, when shall we say, \" There is some\r\nother factor here besides chance \", and call our results \" significant\"?\r\nIt is customary to do this when P falls below 0-05 or when A* rises\r\nabove 2, which is nearly the same thing. This point is of course\r\narbitrary, but it is necessary to fix on some definite point for significance. To quote Dr Fisher, \" Deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are thus formally regarded as significant.\" (Sometimes \" Probable Error \" is used instead of \" Standard Error \". and\r\nthen the values of X are 1-5 times greater.)\r\nWe have now a way of deciding when a result becomes significant,\r\nand of calculating the odds against any given result being due to\r\npure chance. But there is a further point to be taken into account.\r\nX may be either positive or negative, and the tables of the Probability Integral (P) have been calculated for both positive and negative values. But, since the factor which is here superimposing itself on Chance is acting so as to produce positive deviations only, we are\r\nentitled to halve the values of P which are given in the tables.\r\nLet us take the first 1 ,000 trials which Miss Johnson did and calculate what are the odds against her result being due to chance. The\r\nsuccesses she scored in these 1,000 trials amounted to 349. If pure\r\nchance had been acting alone, she would have been expected to score\r\n|- of the number of trials, that is to say 200 successes. Her positive\r\ndeviation was therefore 149 = (7. o= Vnpq= VO-16 x 1.000= \\ 160 = 12-65,\r\na 12-65\r\nFrom the Probability Integral tables. P corresponding to this value\r\nof X is of the order \\ x 10~29\r\n. Or. put into words, the odds against\r\nthis result being due to chance are of the order of a hundred thousand\r\nbillion billion to one ! Fantastic as these figures are. as we proceed the odds against\r\nchance become far greater still. For the whole 30,000 trials the\r\nnumber of successes is 9,364. This is only an average of 31-2 per\r\ncent, of the number of trials, but. because the number of trials is now so large, the value of X has mounted to about 480. and P is of\r\nthe order of | x 10-*60\r\n. Such unthinkable figures mean nothing. No one regards chance as being a possible explanation of any phenomenon if the probability\r\n\r\n\r\n<i2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1935\r\nfalls to 10~ 6 or anywhere near it : or, in other words, if the odds\r\nagainst chance are anything like a million to one. And here I had\r\nbetter say (although it should be obvious to any critic) that I have\r\nnot piled up the odds against chance to these fantastic figures in\r\norder to make a chance explanation of my results less tenable. The\r\nfigures of course accumulate automatically while the experiments are being carried on for other purposes.\r\nThe question of chance can then be dismissed, and we can pass on\r\nto consider other possible explanations.\r\nIndependence of Trials. The above calculations are based on the\r\nassumption that all the trials are independent of one another, so that\r\nthe probability of success in every trial is +. Is this assumption\r\njustified % Is the pointer equally likely to enter any one of the five\r\nboxes on every occasion ? Suppose that the operator, having put\r\nthe pointer into a particular box on one occasion, always avoided\r\nputting it into the same box again on the next occasion, then the\r\nprobability of success on the second occasion would be raised to \\\r\ninstead of \\. Or, suppose the operator habitually went to, say, No. 4\r\nbox after No. 2, or had some favourite sequence of \" runs \"\r\n; then the\r\nassumption we have made that the trials are independent of one\r\nanother would not be justified.\r\nNow, 1 think that this is the most likely criticism to be levelled\r\nagainst these experiments, and I wish to give it full weight. In the\r\ngreat majority of the trials I was myself the operator, selecting the\r\nnumbers as I went along. AVhat is more likely than that the percipient should have become used to my \" runs \", that is to my habits\r\nof selecting boxes in a certain order, and have succeeded in following\r\nme \\ Plausible as it sounds, I do not believe that this factor, if it exists\r\nat all, has had any appreciable effect on the results. The experiments\r\nare admittedly a little like a game of hide-and-seek between operator\r\nand percipient ; and if the operator allowed himself to form numberhabits and allowed the percipient to learn them, then she might score\r\na.bove chance in this way. But one must not forget that the operator can see what the percipient is doing, and so can avoid doing what he\r\nthinks she expects him to. For example, suppose the percipient has\r\nscored two consecutive successes with boxes 1 and 2. She may be\r\nexpected to try 3 next time, so the operator dodges' back to 1 or repeats 2 or skips to 5. The operator's \" runs \" are not entirely his\r\nown ; they are influenced by what the percipient does.\r\nTwo facts show pretty clearly that Miss Johnson has not, in fact,\r\nbeen scoring by following my number-habits. (1) 1.000 trials, consisting of 10 sets of 100 trials each, were done with numbers which\r\nApril 1935 Experiments in Extra -Sensory Perception 63\r\nwere not selected by myself at all. Some of these numbers were\r\nselected by a mechanical device and the rest by three other people.\r\nThe 1000 trials contained 309 successes, or 30-9 per cent. Comparing\r\nthis with the percentage of successes scored in the whole 30.000\r\ntrial*, which was 31-2, we see that the correspondence is very close\r\nindeed. Can it be maintained in the face of these figures that it made\r\nany difference whether I was selecting the numbers or not '. (2) If\r\nthe percipient was, in fact, scoring by getting used to my numberhabits, she should have become fairly expert in the course of 30.000\r\ntrials and her scoring should have gone steadily up. But it did not.\r\nIt went down. During the first 10,000 trials she scored 3.449 successes, an average of 34-5 per cent. But the percentage success on\r\nthe whole was only 31-2. She must have lost skill instead of gaining\r\nit. which is scarcely plausible. All these facts are shown on the\r\ngraph.\r\nIt may be asked why we did not always use numbers selected by\r\nsome chance-device, such as drawing numbers out of a bag. The\r\nreason is that it was found very difficult to keep looking at a card\r\nof numbers pinned up on the screen in front of one, and to operate\r\nthe pointer and to record the results all at the required speed. Even\r\na separate recorder did not help matters much. The operator,\r\nhaving constantly to look up and down, kept losing his place on the\r\ncard of numbers, and causing delays which upset the percipient.\r\nHyperaesthesia. The next most likely criticism to be brought\r\nagainst the results is that they are due to hyperaesthesia. Hvperaesthesia of sight seems to be generally dismissed by those who have\r\nseen the apparatus. The lids of the boxes are of oak and overlap the\r\nsides. The screen is 26 inches square of J\r\ninch three-ply wood, fitting\r\ninto grooves in the sides of the box-unit. There are no cracks which\r\ncould give the least help, and the point of the three-ply wood is that\r\nthere cannot be a small crack going right through because of the\r\ncrossing of the grain. I scarcely think that anyone would maintain\r\nthat the most hyperaesthetic percipient could see through a wooden\r\nscreen. But auditory hyperaesthesia sounds a priori a more probable\r\nhypothesis. I think only a personal trial with the apparatus can\r\nenable anyone to form a fair judgement as to this. No one by careful\r\nlistening on the percipient's side of the screen has been able to detect\r\nwhether the pointer was being thrust in and out of the boxes or not.\r\nBut no doubt there is some slight sound, and a critic, postulating\r\nextreme auditory hyperaesthesia on the part of the percipient, may\r\nsay that she could be guided by it. But it must be remembered that\r\nqualitative hyperaesthesia alone would not be sufficient. The sound\r\n64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apkil 1935\r\nmust be located ; not merely detected. And, as the total length occu- pied by the boxes is only six inches, the hyperaesthetic sense of\r\ndirection must be extraordinarily accurate. All I can say is that\r\nthose who have examined and used the apparatus do not regard the\r\nhyperaesthetic explanation as at all probable.\r\nAnd, further, 2.300 trials were made without using the pointer at\r\nall. In these, five small electric lamps were placed in the boxes con- nected each to its own key, so that by pressing any kev, the operator\r\ncould light any one of the lamps at will. The keys rested on spongy\r\nrubber and when depressed, made contact with globules of mercury.\r\nThey were absolutely silent. In these tests the explanation of auditory hyperaesthesia was entirely removed. They showed a marked\r\ndrop in scoring, only 551 successes being secured, the chance ex- pectation being 460. d=91, and the corresponding value of P is approximately \\ x 10~ 6\r\n, that is to say the odds against their being\r\ndue to chance is about two million to one. The graph is interesting here. A hasty critic might conclude the\r\npercipient's score dropped because the help due to auditory hyperaesthesia had been removed ; but the graph shows that the score had\r\nalready dropped beforehand, and that this drop coincided with the\r\npercipient's illness between 11 and 16 of November. Moreover, the\r\nline marked P shows where, for one block of 100 trials, the pointer\r\nwas reintroduced in the middle of the lamp-trials. The percipient\r\nhad just scored 25 with the lamps : she now scored 25 again with the\r\npointer. It made not the slightest difference. We may notice another curious thing. In the middle of these lamp-trials, during which\r\nthe percipient was not feeling very well, there suddenly occurred a\r\nflash of the \" light feeling \", when she recovered and scored 32 and\r\nthen 42, and then dropped again to the previous level. We may, I think, attribute the low scoring-average with the lamps partly to bad\r\nhealth and partly to the change in the conditions of the experiment.\r\nBut if hyperaesthesia of sound has been eliminated in these lampexperiments, what about hyperaesthesia of sight \\ I admit frankly\r\nthat this theory is possible here. The box-lids, though overlapping\r\nthe edges of the boxes and fitting pretty well, were not designed to be\r\nabsolutely light-tight, and in the dark, faint streaks of light could be\r\nseen in the cracks between the lids by getting the head into the right\r\nposition. But with the strong light shining down on the boxes,\r\nwhich was the working condition, no light in the cracks could be seen. (The Vmlbs in the boxes were worked dull and not at full brightness.)\r\nBut by postulating hyperaesthesia of sight, it might be said that this\r\nwas the cause of the successes with the lamps.\r\nWith the present apparatus this cannot be definitely disproved.\r\nApkil 1935 Experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception\r\nBut one wants to know, (a) why. if the percipient was being guided\r\nby the lights, she did not score better than she did, and (b) if she\r\ncould score as high as 42, why she did it only once when the sensory\r\nguide must have been constant all the time. In fact, I think one may\r\nsay in general that if hyperaesthesia were the true explanation of\r\nthese results, one would expect them to be much more constant than\r\nthey are. Normal Knowledge and Fraud. Is there any way in which the percipient could have obtained her results by normal sense-perception,\r\ndeceiving both the operator and the witnesses ? Everyone who has\r\ntaken the percipient's place at the apparatus has so far come to the\r\nconclusion that it is impossible to see or to hear anything normally\r\nwhich could be of the least help towards scoring. There are no\r\ncracks which the percipient can see through. She cannot look over\r\nor round the screen or under the table without standing up or bending in such a way as to be perfectly obvious and without stopping\r\nthe course of the experiment. She cannot make trial shots by raising\r\nthe lids of one or more boxes a little way and peeping in, because the\r\nlids have been tested for this, and if one of them is opened the\r\noperator sees the light coming through it before the percipient can see whether there is anything in the box or not. If the slightest gleam of\r\nlight shows through more than one box at a time, the operator marks\r\nthe trial as a failure. Besides, the percipient has repeatedly scored\r\nabove chance while being closely watched by a witness.\r\nCollusion. Could there be fraudulent collusion between myself and\r\nthe percipient ? There is certainly some scope for this. The table\r\nis only 18 inches wide, and it would be quite possible for me to nudge\r\nthe percipient with my foot under it. Dame Edith Lyttelton pointed\r\nthis out, and at her suggestion a large drawing board was put against\r\nthe side of the table so as to screen completely the legs of the operator\r\nfrom those of the percipient. Under these conditions, 400 trials were made, with 132 successes, that is 33 per cent., which is rather above\r\nthe general average of scoring.\r\nAnother thing which might be construed as a possible source of\r\nleakage is the fact that the operator says the word \" In \" each time\r\nhe thrusts the pointer into one of the boxes. Does the inflection of\r\nhis voice indicate the number of the box ? Do I do this ] Or have I arranged with Miss Johnson some system of sighs and groans by\r\nwhich she knows the number of the box I am putting the pointer\r\ninto ? There are two points about this. One is that if I did these\r\nthings, witnesses would probably have noticed it. And secondly, it would be something of a feat to do it at the rate of 27 times a minute.\r\nBut what is more conclusive is the fact that the percipient has scored\r\n66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Aprii, l\u00bb35\r\nwell above chance with two other operators. With Mr H. F. Sa.lt- marsh operating. 400 trials were made, with 121 successes, an aver- age of 30-2 per cent. X works out at 5-12, and P is of the order of\r\nI\r\nx 10-7\r\n. With Mr Gerald Heard operating, 600 trials were made with\r\n169 successes, averaging 28-1 per cent., and again P is of the order\r\n|\r\n10~\". So that if there is any question of voice-signalling, they\r\nmust both have learnt the code.\r\nWe tried a lecturer's Castanet instead of saying \" In \". but it worried the percipient and we gave it up. There seemed also to be an\r\nadvantage in the voice-method, for the sound of it must effectually\r\ndrown any microscopic sound the pointer makes, and so make the\r\ntheory of auditory hyperesthesia untenable.\r\nA Conspiracy ! Are Miss Johnson, myself and all our witnesses\r\nbanded together in a fraudulent conspiracy ? I confess that I do not\r\nfeel equal to dealing with this suggestion. All I can say is that I hope\r\nmore members will join the conspiracy ! Witnesses. The following is the list of investigators who have so\r\nfar witnessed these experiments. I give their names in the chronological order of their visits. Mr H. F. Saltmarsh, Professor (.'. D.\r\nBroad, Mr E. H. Mallet, Miss I. Newton, Mr W. H. Salter, Hon. Mrs\r\nAlfred Lvttelton. Mr Gerald Heard. Mr and Mrs Kenneth Richmond,\r\nMr Whately Carington, Miss Ina Jephson. Mrs W. H. Salter. In all,\r\n5.700 trials were made in the presence of these visitors, who were\r\nusually though not always present two at a time. 1,700 of these\r\ntrials were successes, giving an average of 29-8 per cent., which is again so close to the total average of 31-2 per cent, as to show that\r\nwhatever was producing the scoring in the presence of the visitors\r\nwas also producing it in their absence.\r\nThe presence of visitors might have been expected to lower the\r\nscoring, and the graph shows that there was some lowering at the\r\nbeginning of each visit. But the recovery was quick as soon as the\r\npercipient began to get used to then presence.\r\nDame Edith Lvttelton and Mr Heard paid six visits in order to\r\nmake a. thorough examination of the whole process which they\r\nwatched from both sides simultaneously. Mr Heard checked my\r\nscoring by watching the openings of the boxes and checked my addition of the number of successes afterwards. On some occasions he\r\nacted as operator with the result given above (169 successes in 600\r\ntrials). Mr Saltmarsh was also present several times, and also acted\r\nas operator, and these three witnesses have kindly appended their\r\nindependent testimony.\r\nOther Percipients. Although various people have tried their hands\r\nat taking the percipient's place and scoring with the apparatus, no\r\nApril 1935 Experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception 67\r\none except myself has done enough trials to enable any conclusion\r\nto be drawn. I have, however, myself acted as percipient for 1,100\r\ntrials. Mrs Tyrrell being the operator throughout. I scored 24-4 successes, an average of 22-18 per cent, d is here 24, and X works out\r\nat 1-8, giving the half value of P as 0-035. This is just below the\r\nsignificant value of 0-05, so that there is a trace of some factor\r\nbesides chance. It may be that I have occasional feeble flashes of\r\nparanormal faculty, or it may be that there is a very slight amount\r\nof truth in the theory that the percipient can score by following the\r\noperator's rims. But at any rate the tremendous discrepancy between Miss Johnson's performance and my own tells heavily against\r\nany normal explanation of her results. Speaking in round numbers,\r\nshe has scored successes at the rate of 32 per cent, of the number of\r\ntrials, whereas I have only scored successes at the rate of 22 per\r\ncent. Or, put in another form, she has scored 12 per cent, above the\r\nchance expectation of successes, whereas I have only scored 2 per\r\ncent, above them. If she can do this by following the operator's runs, or by using her eyes and ears, why cannot I do it ? Conclusion. We have here results which are colossally above\r\nchance. Either Miss Johnson has amply shown the existence of undifferentiated E.S.P.\u2014that is to say of telepathy and\/or clairvoyance\r\n\u2014an extension of human faculty which carries with it the most farreaching significance, or some possible means of reaching the\r\nresults by normal or semi-normal (hyperaesthetic) means have not\r\nbeen sufficiently ruled out. Vague criticism of results which have\r\nreached this stage is not enough : it must be shown exactly how the\r\nresults are obtained. The apparatus will be shortly removed to 31,\r\nTavistock Square, and any critic who believes that an above-chance\r\nscore can be obtained with it by normal means will have an opportunity of demonstrating how this can be done.\r\nMeanwhile it is recognised that the present apparatus is imperfect\r\nand too limited in its scope. It was in the nature of an experiment,\r\nand experience shows that it can be greatly improved upon. A new\r\napparatus is now under construction which, it is hoped, will over- come the deficiencies of the present one. It will allow pure clairvov- ance and pure precognition to be tested independently. It will lie electrically operated, self-recording and automatically fraud-proof,\r\nand will embody a mechanical selector which will select box-numbers of which the operator is ignorant. Thus, unconscious whispering and\r\nnumber-habits will be automatically excluded : and operator and\r\npercipient will work at separate tables at a distance from one another and if desired in separate rooms. The question of a physical\r\nbasis for visual hyperaesthesia (the only kind which will be relevant\r\n)\r\n68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1935\r\nwill, it is hoped, be able to be subjected to an objective, photographic test : and since a high speed of working will be possible, the\r\nrate of progress should be rapid.\r\nFinally, I should like to express my thanks to Dr R. A. Fisher for\r\nkindly assisting me with the mathematics of the subject : also for the\r\nkind help given me by the President and by all those who have taken\r\npart in the experiments and have helped me by their welcome criti- cisms and suggestions.\r\nNote by Dame Edith Lyttelton and Mr Gerald Heard.\r\nAs stated in Mr Tyrrell's report, we attended six sittings at his house\r\nin order to watch his method of carrying out the experiments in\r\nextra-sensory perception. These dates were Jan. 17th, 18th and 24th\r\nand Feb. 6th, 8th and 13th. From our notes taken at the time the\r\nfollowing particulars are quoted. On the first sitting, which began\r\nat 8.48, we watched six series of 100 calls each. Each of these runs of\r\na 100 took between 3 to 4 minutes. This was the limit of Mr Tyrrell's\r\nworking speed\u2014how fast he could place the pointer in a hole, see whether Miss Johnson had guessed right and record failure or success. The nearer he could approach to the three-minute pace for the\r\n100 run the better the guessing became. Miss Johnson often feels the\r\ncheck on her power of guessing owing to the inevitable slowness of\r\nthis method. This will be overcome by use of the new machine. The\r\nsix runs showed the following hits out of the hundred guesses : 23,\r\n27. 30, 31, 23, 35. This showed the improvement which is generally\r\nnoted as Miss Johnson becomes used to the presence of strangers.\r\nThe drop to 23 in the last but one Miss Johnson felt was due to\r\nslowness \" on part of operator. On the 18th another six rims were made, showing 32, 29, 25, 30, 40. For the sixth Gerald Heard was\r\ntried as percipient\u2014so as to study the method better. This run gave\r\n31 . On the 24th Mrs Lyttelton also made a short experimental run\r\nto test the method. This run included only 32 guesses and showed\r\n7 correct. Miss Johnson's six runs of a hundred on this evening\r\nshowed, 18, 31, 32, 37, 32, 32, successes. At the final sitting on Feb.\r\n13th her runs showed 26, 26, (this run G. H. acted as operator) 30\r\n(it was after this that on Mrs Lyttelton's recommendation a board\r\nwas put so as to prevent possible foot contact between operator and\r\npercipient) 40 hits were then made out of the possible hundred. The\r\nnext two runs were operated by G. H. again and gave 30 and 30 and a seventh was operated by Mr Tyrrell, giving 32.\r\nAt all these sittings no one was present except the two observers,\r\nApril 1935 Experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception 69\r\nthe operator and Miss Johnson. They were held in a Studio distant\r\nfrom the house. They all took place between 8.45 and 9.45 p.m.\r\nIn our opinion they gave evidence of the existence of extra-sensory\r\nperception on the part of Miss Johnson. We also think that when the\r\nnew machine for carrying out tests of this faculty is used it will be\r\npossible greatly to increase the number of experiments and the data\r\navailable. We recommend any member of the Society who wishes to\r\ngo further into the matter to communicate with Mr Tyrrell who is anxious that as many members as possible should view the experiments for themselves.\r\n(Signed) Edith Lyttelton,\r\nGerald Heard.\r\nNote by Mr H. F. Saltmarsh.\r\nI have been asked to write a short comment on the experiment in\r\nB.S.P. which Mr Tyrrell and Miss Johnson have been carrying out\r\nin so far as I have personally witnessed it. I have been present on five separate occasions on which trials have\r\nbeen made and the following table gives the details.\r\nPresent besides G. N. M. T. No. of\r\nDate. and Miss J. Trials. Successes.\r\n25 Oct. 34 Myself - 300 92\r\n27 Oct. 34 Myself - 200 69\r\n31 Oct. 34 Myself - 300 109\r\n1 Nov. 34 Prof. Broad and myself 500 132\r\n28 Feb. 35 Miss Jephson and myself - 200 53\r\nI have acted as operator in 400 trials with a total of 121 successes = 30-2 per cent. I will not enter into any lengthy discussion of these figures except to\r\nsay that it is clear that my presence alone did not act as a disturbing\r\nfactor to so great an extent as did that of Prof. Broad and Miss\r\nJephson. When I was the only visitor the percentage of success was\r\n33-7, when another visitor was present it fell to 26-4. This can\r\nreasonably be explained by the fact that I have known Miss Johnson\r\nfor a considerable time and that she is comparatively accustomed to\r\nmy presence, whereas both Prof. Broad and Miss Jephson are\r\nrelatively strangers.\r\nThis is confirmed by the fact that the first one or two runs of 100\r\ntrials which I witnessed gave a score which was considerably below\r\nthe average for the whole.\r\n70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1935\r\nMr Tyrrell has described the apparatus and the modus operandi of\r\nthe experiment, so I will confine my remarks to a few points on which\r\nI consider that criticism might be directed.\r\nAs regards bona fides, I, being well acquainted with those concerned, have no doubt whatsoever, but I recognise that my convictions are not evidence.\r\nHowever, as the percentage of success for the four rims in which\r\nI acted as operator was nearly equal to that of the whole, it is clear\r\nthat Mr Tyrrell is absolved from any complicity, unless, of course,\r\nI was myself a confederate. If this latter view be taken I have no more to say, seeing that no words of mine would then carry any\r\nweight.\r\nThe operator, himself, was the only person who was in a position\r\nto fake the record ; it follows that lack of bonafides on Miss Johnson's\r\npart could only be in the form of some normal perception of the\r\nmovement of the pointer. I examined the apparatus very carefully\r\nand watched the experiments being done with the utmost attention,\r\nand I feel confident that no normal perception was possible. I tried\r\nto act as subject myself and was able to obtain only chance score.\r\nI suggested that the operator might have some habitual sequences\r\nin selecting where to insert the pointer and that Miss Johnson might\r\nunconsciously follow these, but the fact that the average score was\r\nreduced to so small an extent by my acting as operator meets this\r\ncriticism. It is highly improbable that Mr Tyrrell and myself should\r\nhave identical sets of habits in this respect, and Miss Johnson bad had\r\nno opportunity of learning any habits which I may have.\r\nThe most formidable criticism is that of hyperaesthesia of hearing.\r\nHyperesthesia of sight I regard as being excluded, the opera\/tor\r\nbeing so completely screened from the subject. But as regards\r\nsound, while I am satisfied that no such explanation is possible, I admit that it cannot be completely eliminated with the present\r\napparatus. Every precaution was taken to render the operation\r\nsoundless, and, so far as normal hearing goes, I think successfully.\r\nBut until a limit can be set to the possibility of hyperaesthesia, a\r\ndefinite pronouncement cannot be made. With the improved\r\nelectrically operated apparatus now under construction this risk will\r\nbe entirely avoided.\r\nHowever, though theoretically the possibility of hyperaesthesia of\r\nhearing cannot be completely excluded from this experiment, I regard it, in view of all the circumstances, as almost negligibly small.\r\nMoreover, hyperaesthesia so marked and so consistent over so long\r\na period would itself be a phenomenon quite as, if not more, supernormal than mere undifferentiated E.S.P.\r\nApril 1935 Experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception 71\r\nThere is only one further point, viz. the suggestion of unconscious\r\nwhispering on the part of the operator. When witnessing the trials I was on the lookout for this ; when operating myself I had it in\r\nmind and I was never able to detect the slightest signs. This is, I admit, not conclusive, for the whispering might be normally\r\ninaudible.\r\nThis risk again will be provided against in the electrical apparatus.\r\nIn conclusion I have no hesitation in stating that I am convinced,\r\nsubject to an almost negligibly small reservation as regards hyperaesthesia and unconscious whispering, that true undifferentiated\r\nE.S.P. had been demonstrated in this experiment.\r\nH.

As a lecturer she was in\r\nmuch demand and, being well known in the realms of art and litera- ture, attracted many who would otherwise have been but little interested in this subject.\r\nIt is an advantage that, in the home of her father, Admiral, the\r\nRight Honourable Sir Cooper-Key, G.C.B., F.R.S., she met many\r\nleading scientists. Throughout her life she endeavoured to study\r\nthe laws underlying phenomena, and in Psychical Research it was\r\nher ambition to combine accurate observation with experiment and\r\ncareful inference. Nor was her mind closed to the religious implication of the facts established, and many will be grateful to her for\r\nhaving brought consolation and confidence in their hour of bereavement or mental perplexity.\r\n72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April1935\r\nHer most recent book This World and Beyond (Cassell) is to some\r\nextent autobiographical and includes some account of experiences\r\nwhich brought the assurance that her deceased husband was in\r\ncommunication with her. It also recounts how on one occasion she\r\nwas present at a demonstration of the psychic control of fire, and\r\nhad the courage to hold in her hands a burning log which, under\r\nordinary circumstances, would have inflicted severe burns, but\r\nwhich left her skin unhurt and gave only a feeling of pleasant\r\nwarmth. To those who did not know her personally this book will\r\nreveal something of her genial mind. Her versatility was considerable and she moved with ease both on the surface and amid life's deeper problems. Her quick sense of humour was used effectively\r\nboth in committee and in public speaking. Psychical Research and\r\nSpiritualism are losers by her departure.\r\nC. D.

F\r\n74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat 1935\r\nEXTRACT FROM NOTES OF A SITTING WITH\r\nMISS FRANCES CAMPBELL\r\nPreliminary Note by the Hon. Editor\r\nThe names involved in the following record must not be disclosed,\r\nbut all are known to me, as is the date of the sitting, a recent one. Before giving the record a few facts must be stated so that\r\nreaders may estimate the results for themselves.\r\n(1) The sitter had not sat with this medium before, nor had he\r\nseen her ; nor had the purporting communicator sat with her or known of her.\r\n(2) The sitting was arranged for in the following way : About\r\ntwo months or more before the sitting, The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas\r\nhad given to this sitter Miss Frances Campbell's address and tele- phone number along with those of other mediums. At that time,\r\nthe sitter had wanted these for a friend, not for himself ; and, as a matter of fact, Mr Drayton Thomas was away on holiday in Cornwall when, one morning, the sitter rang up Miss Campbell's number,\r\nspoke to a third person and said,\u2014' A sitter known to Mr Drayton\r\nThomas wishes an appointment '. An hour was named a couple of\r\ndays ahead and agreed to, Mr Thomas knowing nothing about it.\r\n(3) This sitter does not talk at sittings, beyond asking for more\r\ninformation (as below), or saying ' good ' and ' thank you '. or ' no\r\n' when a question can be denied ; and, in the portion of the sitting\r\nquoted, he took no part, as it was given too quickly to allow of\r\nremarks whilst taking longhand notes.\r\n(4) In regard to the main communicator, the personality depicted\r\nstrongly suggested to the sitter a certain man, Y, who had died\r\nfifteen days before the sitting ; the second communicator indicated\r\nequally strongly suggested Y's closest friend, who had predeceased\r\nhim and who was also a close friend of the sitter.\r\n(5) A second sitting, arranged for in the same way, the medium\r\nnot seeming to recognise the sitter, was held about three weeks later. In this sitting there was a good deal of confusion which the sitter\r\nthinks he can explain. But, he reports that,\u2014' While the same\r\ncommunicator, Y, purported to be communicating, reference was made to a picture, by way of indicating his profession of artist, and\r\nhe was said to be pointing to the frame which the medium described as elaborate, saying that the communicator remarked, pointing to\r\nthe frame, \" that's swagger \". Now this was a peculiar term of\r\npraise for anything fine, used by the communicator when living. It was so distinctive a phrase that I [sitter] once said to him,\u2014' If you\r\nMay 1935 Notes of a Sitting with Miss Frances Campbell 76\r\never come back and say at a sitting \" that's swagger \", I shall know\r\nit is you.\"\r\n' We may now take the annotated record of the first sitting.\r\nCopy of the Record of part of the Sitting, with annotations supplied\r\nby the sitter.\r\nText.

He had come in, got up\r\nfrom chair, having taking off\r\nwalking shoes, crossed floor of\r\nsitting-room in his socks to get\r\nslippers, slipped and fell. He did not wear a wrist\r\n\r\nwatch, and, though I do not\r\nremember this gesture with any\r\nconviction, on enquiring after\r\nthe sitting, from some one who\r\nhad lived for years with him, I was told he did this frequently.\r\nHe was a highly nervous man,\r\nwith such quick tensions.\r\nA close friend, a woman, was\r\nwith him when he died and told\r\nme, after the sitting, that she\r\nwent on speaking to him when\r\nthe hospital sister was telling her\r\nit was all over.

I was impatient but\r\nthat was because I used to get\r\nfrightened\".\r\nAs I felt this was not\r\n1 in\r\ncharacter ', I made a point of\r\nasking someone who had known\r\nthe putative person very inti- mately if this were possibly true.\r\nI was told when nervous he was\r\napt to embarrass through a cer- tain \" un-English \" courtesy.\r\nNot confirmed.\r\nConfirmed.

I was\r\nconsciously not aware of it.\r\n78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1935\r\nThere is a room he shows with\r\nbooks round in which he used to\r\nsit, and somewhere there is a\r\nclock he used to wind. There is a chair in the corner where he\r\nused to sit, a favourite place for\r\nhim to sit. His daughter (when she thinks\r\nof him) sees him sitting in that\r\nchair.\r\nHe says suddenly,\u2014\" I'd\r\nrather have had that outing in\r\nthe car and things have gone as they have, after all it is I that\r\npaid for it.\"\r\nHe meets a dog called Jack.\r\nAnd a man he used to argue\r\nwith always. They always\r\nargued. Now they argue but\r\nthey are friends. He says,\u2014\r\n\"It is a great treat to stand\r\nstraight \", and puts his hand on\r\nhis hip. He says he now feels quite free. Suddenly he says,\u2014\" D is there. Don \". Donald ? \" No, no, DON.\"\r\nHe says it would have made a\r\ngreat difference, such a differ- ence, if he had known that he\r\nwould see D.\r\nD. knows you (sitter).\r\nHe is embarrassed at saying\r\nI am told he used to wind a\r\nclock but don't remember it.\r\nYes, but not very evidential.\r\nThere is one daughter. He\r\nand she were not very intimate.\r\nShe lived abroad much.\r\nAfter undergoing a cure in\r\nFrance in July and early August,\r\nhe drove himself back in his car making a torn. The autopsy\r\nshowed that, as he was in such\r\nbad condition, he might have\r\ndied on the way, and the strain\r\nmay have hastened his end.

B. Rhine's Extra-Sensory Perception in Proc, xliii. 24, Dr Thonless appears to be criticising\r\nRhine's work, not as being invalid in establishing thefact of E. S. P.,\r\nbut only as being invalid in establishing his high estimate of the\r\nfrequency of its distribution, which he puts at about one in four.\r\nDr Thouless says, \" Indeed, there seems no reasonable doubt that\r\nif the D.T. experiments were carried out exactly as described, with\r\nadequately shuffled cards no other explanation than that of clair- voyance is possible. We have, however, plenty of other evidence hi\r\nfavour of the view that extra-sensory perception is to be found as a very exceptional mental power. The novelty of Dr Rhine's\r\nresults lies in his apparent demonstration that this power is not\r\nuncommon and it is here unfortunately that his evidence is quite\r\ninadequately stated \"\r\n(p. 36). And as Dr Thouless does not call in question the accuracy with which these results are stated but\r\nonly criticises the inadequacy with which other results (not the\r\nD.T.) are stated, the reader is left with the impression that he\r\naccepts Dr Rhine's evidence as valid for the existence of E. S. P.\r\n(which is the major issue) but doubts the minor issue of its common\r\noccurrence ; and that the latter only is the point which he is discussing. This point, he says, ought to be cleared up by repeating\r\nRhine's experiments, for \" his methods are so simple and his results so clear that his experiments can easily be repeated.\"\r\nWith regard to such repetitions, may I point out one thing,\r\nnamely that there is a very important factor which some investigators seem inclined to overlook, and which certainly is not easy to\r\nreproduce, but which seems to be capable of exercising a decisive\r\ninfluence on the results ? I refer to the factor of the mental or psychological atmosphere. The efficacy of this is apparently due\r\nto the fact that there exists a subconscious, controlling influence of\r\nsome sort which has the power of enhancing, of inhibiting or even\r\nof reversing the results, and which is strikingly exampled by Rhine's\r\nexperiment with Linzmayer, reported on pp. 62-63 of his book,\r\nin which he urged the latter to go on with the experiments when\r\nhe was feeling reluctant and uninterested, with the result that his\r\nscoring fell, first to chance value and then below it : and this\r\nagainst his conscious wish. And with Pearce we read, \" Another\r\nfactor that upsets Pearce's scoring, as a rule, is any change that\r\nhe does not easily and spontaneously accept as likely to work \"\r\nMat 1935 Correspondence 81\r\n(p. 77), which reveals the same influence operating again. I have\r\nalso frequently noticed with Miss Johnson that the difference\r\nbetween a high score and a low one depends upon a most delicately\r\npoised psychological condition : for example, the fact of turning\r\nthe conversation on a slightly unpleasant subject just before an\r\nexperiment I have known to send the score down to chance value.\r\nSome subconscious entity evidently can act as a censor and it has\r\ncomplete power over the course of the experiments ; and the\r\nconditions to which this censor is responsive are delicate and elusive\r\nin the extreme. Psychological \" atmosphere \" is, I am sure, one\r\nof the important ones. Now, Dr Rhine's subjects were all working in a rather unusual\r\npsychological atmosphere. As students of psychology they were,\r\npresumably, familiar with the idea of psychological experiments : they were amongst people they knew in accustomed surroundings\r\nand the psychic experiments were merely adding a fresh zest to the\r\nordmary routine of life without in any way upsetting it. And this was probably encouraging to the censor. These were conditions\r\nin marked contrast with those in which a person at random with\r\nunknown preconceptions about the whole subject (see note about\r\nPearce above) is asked to sit occasionally for an hour at a time with\r\nstrangers.\r\nDr Thouless seems to regard it as an easy matter for anyone to\r\nrepeat Dr Rhine's experiments ; but what I wish to stress is that\r\nanyone who \" repeats \" them without reproducing the psychological\r\natmosphere has not really repeated them at all. The psychological\r\natmosphere is elusive, but it is clearly of the utmost importance ; and if the investigator disregards it, nature will not.\r\nG. N. M. Tyrrell.\r\nREVIEWS\r\nMust Philosophers Disagree ? By F. C. S. Schiller. London : Macmillan & Co. 1934. Pp.'xi-359. Price 12s. 6d. net. In this volume of twenty-four collected lectures and essays, most\r\nof which have been previously published, Dr Schiller covers a wide\r\nrange of subjects which extend from the psychology of examinations\r\nto the problems of psychical research. He distributes these under\r\nthe four headings of Educational, Historical and Speculative, with a concluding Philosophical Survey, and links them by a deliberate\r\navoidance of technicality of style, which so often reduces, as he\r\nobserves, the writings of philosophers to \" verbalism and not\r\nliterature \". These readable essays, written in Dr Schiller's delightful style, are certainly the latter.\r\n82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat 1935\r\nThe initial question, \" Must philosophers disagree ? \" is answered\r\nin the affirmative. They must, the author says, becaiise Philosophy\r\nis not a single, coherent structure to which every philosopher adds\r\nhis quota. Each philosophy is rather the product of an individual\r\npersonality, stamped by that personality's history and character,\r\nand intelligible in the light of it alone. In fact, \" Philosophy is best\r\ndescribed as a sort of poetry, and often lyrical poetry at that.\"\r\nBut, on the other hand, there need not be so much disagreement as there is. It arises because \" brooding philosophers do not understand one another.\" They \" keep their best trumps up their\r\nsleeves \" ; and etiquette taboos the asking of questions while a\r\nphilosopher is alive ; while, after he is dead, there is no way of ending\r\nthe discussion as to what he really meant.\r\nSome of the essays which follow contain a destructive criticism of\r\nsyllogistic logic : and these are followed by an appreciative biographical sketch of WilUam James, and an account of the Making of\r\nPragmatism. There is also a particularly interesting essay on\r\nNietzsche, whose ideas, the author thinks, may prove very infectious\r\nin the present state of the world. For, if present trends continue,\r\n\" the gospel of the Superman may well seem preferable to that of\r\nthe Social Insect.\" Nietzsche's ' immoralism ' is presented rather as a transvaluation of values than as a negation of morality : but his\r\nunbalanced mind negates his own eulogy of the ' strong ' by admitting that they are, after all, \" weaker, less wilful, more absurd than\r\nthe average weak ones. They are the squandering races.\" So that\r\nit is possible, after all, that the meek may inherit the earth by proving themselves to be more viable than their predatory neighbours.\r\nNietzsche, providing as he does an extreme example of the\r\ntendency amongst philosophers towards inward brooding and self- absorption, draws from Dr Schiller this rather delightful sentence.\r\n\" In a queer philosophy \", he says, \" written by a crank, I once came\r\nacross the frank admission that he had written his book in the hope of\r\nrendering his ideas intelligible to himself ; ever since I cannot but think\r\nthat this must be the real secret of many renowned philosophers.\"\r\nThe same article affords a ground for an interesting discussion of\r\nthe Humanist theory of knowledge, which Nietzsche himself came\r\nhalf way towards accepting. As also with Vaihinger and others, he\r\nagrees with the doctrine that \" ' Knowledge ', ' truth ', ' logic ', nay, even ' perception ', are not in fact reproductions of the given, but\r\nmanipulations of it and operations on it, which variously and wondrously transform it.\" But he drew the conclusion that the world\r\nwhich concerns us is subjective and therefore false. \" Granting that\r\nall knowledge involves human manipulation, that truth is essentially\r\nMay 1935 Reviews 83\r\na valuation, that sensations do not occur, and that perceptions are already impregnated with valuations, because the original data were\r\na chaos . . . \" yet, why should the inference be drawn, the author\r\nasks, that\r\n;! the world which concerns us at all is false ? \" Why the\r\nhumble phrasing, \" it is all only subjective ? \" \" It is all our work ! \"\r\nrejoins Dr Schiller,\r\n' ! Let us be proud of it.\" But the reader is left wondering why the protest should not be\r\ncarried further. Why should the original data be admitted to be a chaos ? Granting the existence of an effective human factor in all these things, is there no theory of knowledge which will combine it with recognition of an ultimately ordered reality ] Is there no\r\nbridge which will span the gulf between Plato and Protagoras ? The later section of the book contains essays on the subjects of\r\nEvolution. Creation. Novelty and the Metaphysics of Change. Here\r\nthe author deals with the frequent confusion between the terms\r\n' Evolution ' and ' Epigenesis '. But the crux of the whole matter\r\nresides in our conception of the meaning of Novelty. \"It is true\r\nthat nothing ever arises out of absolutely nothing. There is always\r\nsomething out of which it grows. But that does not explain it wholly.\r\nIt does not account for the new in it. It is only in so far as it is still the old, or the old over again, that it is accounted for by what it grew\r\nout of. In so far as it is new, it remains unaccountable, unpredictable, uncontrolled, undetermined, free. That factor in it, therefore,\r\nhas arisen out of nothing, and Novelty as such means, Creation out\r\nof nothing ! \" And so, \" There is no basis in experience therefore,\r\nfor the philosophic fancy of any unchanging substratum of change. . .\" At any rate, this view engenders a hopeful and helpful attitude to- wards Psychical Research, the article on which is a reprint of Dr\r\nSchiller's Presidential Address delivered to this Society in 1914.\r\nThe question of proof bv an accumulation of probabilities, which\r\nDr Schiller supports in opposition to the demand for a single,\r\nirrefragable case, may well be revised in the light of scientific\r\nadvance since that time. Physical law seems now to rest ultimately on probabilities. \" As we probe deeper,\" says the author in a later\r\nwritten essay, \"\u2022all the objects of scientific interest are turning out\r\nto be immensely more complicated, individual, nay unique, than\r\nanyone suspected.\" We are not, in fact, in science dealing with\r\nthe essence of these individual and unique objects, but only with\r\nprobabilities concerning their external relationships. Should we\r\nnot give probability a logical value in psychical research ? The central importance which Humanism attaches to the in- dividual opens a wide vista of possibilities. \" We have no means of\r\nproving,\" says Dr Schiller in his concluding pages, \" that our whole\r\n84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May L935\r\nlife, with all the ' truths ' it supports and all the ' realities ' it attests,\r\nis not itself a\r\n' dream '\r\n: consequently death itself, when we come to\r\nit, may appear like awakening from a nightmare. This suggestion is an old one and there is much to be said in its favour . . . \" : and I think one may confidently assert that this generosity in the a priori\r\nattitude contrasts favourably with the crabbed and limited outlook\r\nwhich is dictated by the ingrained suggestions of common sense and\r\nan unphilosophical science. It throws open the door to infinite\r\npossibilities and creates an atmosphere in which human life may be\r\nlived in a spirit of high adventure.\r\nG. N. M. T.\r\nF. W. H.

Why not try the experiment ? \"\r\nHunter, in a letter to Jenner.\r\n1. Readers of the Journal will recollect that I appealed, a few\r\nmonths ago, for collaborators in some experiments in precognitive\r\nguessing which I was then planning. These were prompted by Mr\r\nSaltmarsh's \" Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition \" (Proc.\r\nS.P.R., Part 136), and their object was to see whether any prima\r\nfacie evidence of precognitive ability could be obtained experimentally.\r\nI am deeply indebted to thirty-nine members of the Society and\r\ntheir friends not only for the trouble they have taken in providing\r\nme with material, but for the very high standard of care and conscientiousness they have maintained. In particular, I have to thank\r\nMr and Mrs Saltmarsh, and Mrs B. V. Tennant, for notable contributions ; while Mr J. Fraser Nicol, of Edinburgh, has earned my very\r\nspecial gratitude for the enthusiasm and thoroughness with which\r\nhe organised a whole group of collaborators in that city. I am also\r\nagain greatly obliged to Professor Fisher for valuable advice and\r\nhelp.\r\n2. The procedure adopted was that of throwing an ordinary sixsided die from a\r\n\" shaker \" in the usual way, and subjects were\r\nrequired to write down, before throwing, what they thought or felt the number about to be thrown would be.\r\nThese guesses and throws were recorded on specially printed\r\nforms arranged in four columns of thirty guesses each, giving 120\r\nguesses to the sheet. A full \" set \" of guesses consisted of ten such\r\nsheets, normally done on different days, making 1,200 guesses in all. The words \" column \", \" sheet \" and \" set \" will be used in the\r\nabove-indicated senses of 30, 120 and 1,200 guesses respectively\r\nthroughout this report. The word \" group \" will be used generically.\r\nJune 1935 Experiments in Precognitive Guessing 87\r\n3. One set from one subject was so spectacularly successful as to\r\nbe quite clearly hors concours and nothing but confusion would\r\nresult from including it in the general analysis of the data. It is accordingly withdrawn and reserved for separate discussion in\r\nSection 13 below. Another set from the same subject was, however,\r\nobtained under different conditions, and this is included.\r\nThe whole of what follows, prior to Section 13, is accordingly\r\nsubject to the reservation \" excluding Mr X's freak \".\r\n4. Table I shows the numbers of guesses for the various subjects,\r\ntheir successes, and the probabilities that the results obtained were due to chance alone.\r\nThe first column gives the reference number of the subject ; the\r\nsecond shows the total number of guesses made ; the third gives\r\nthe expected number of successes on the assumption that chance\r\nalone is at work ; the fourth gives the number of successes actually\r\nscored ; in the fifth is the value of computed in the ordinary way\r\nfrom the difference between the numbers of successes observed and\r\nexpected, and the number of guesses involved ; in the last is the\r\nprobability of this difference being due to chance. A minus sign\r\nis prefixed, purely as an indicator, to those values of %\r\n2 corresponding\r\nto successes below expectation.\r\nTable II gives details, by sheets of 120, of 38 complete sets of\r\n1,200. The first set is an exception, because I unwisely did this set (my own first attempt) in sheets of 100. The first 24 sets are first attempts, hereinafter described as \" fresh \" sets. Numbers 25 and\r\n26 were actually preceded by 270 guesses each scored in sheets\r\nof 90 before the technique had been standardized ; they are, however, counted as \" fresh \" for the purposes of subsequent calculations. The remainder are all second, third, etc., attempts. An\r\nasterisk indicates the sets which were controlled and certified by\r\nan experimenter and\/or witnesses ; these will be referred to as \" experimenter \" sets. It is interesting to note in passing that these 23 experimenter\r\nsets score 4,657 successes\u2014an excess of 57 over expectation\u2014as compared with 2,948\u2014a deficiency of 52\u2014by the 15 \" solo \" sets. For what little it is worth it indicates that the soloists took no\r\nadvantage of their freedom from supervision.\r\nIt is clear that these 40 subjects, taken as a group, afford no\r\njustification for supposing that any precognitive faculty is at work,\r\nfor the total number of successes is exactly equal to expectation.\r\nOn the other hand, if we consider individuals, we find two subjects\r\ngiving odds of better than a hundred to one (in opposite senses),\r\ntwo better than thirty to one (also in opposite senses) and twelve\r\no 2\r\n88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\nTABLE I SN G E s\r\n2 YA P\r\nl\r\n1 a AAA l AAA 07 ft .Kftl .99\r\nZ\r\nA 1 1 A OoO A7K 0 to \u2014 \"I\/O 04:\r\n\u2022>6\r\nQ AAA AAA OUU A9K.

We should expect a\r\ncertain proportion of such relatively long odds to occur in a sample of\r\nforty subjects, even if chance alone were at work ; in fact we should\r\nexpect a hundred to one chance to come off about once in a hundred\r\ntimes, so that we need not feel particularly surprised at finding two\r\nof them in forty, especially as they are in opposite senses. Inspection suggests, however, that there are rather more of these\r\nspecially successful (or unsuccessful) cases than chance alone would\r\ngive, and we must accordingly consider the possibility of there being\r\nreal tendencies to score above and below expectation operating\r\nwith about equal frequency among our subjects. Either tendency,\r\nif significant, would imply an element of genuine precognition ; but\r\nin the one case it would lead to the throw being forecast successfully,\r\nwhile in the other we should be obliged in addition to postulate\r\nsome kind of reversal of effect leading to a below chance score. This hypothesis may seem a trifle far fetched, but it must not be\r\ndismissed a priori on that account.\r\n5. The effect of such opposite tendencies would be to increase the\r\ndispersion, or \" scatter \", of the success' totals (and their corre- sponding ^\r\n2s), which would be normally distributed if chance\r\nalone were at work.\r\nThere are various methods of testing for this kind of thing and,\r\nas I shall use them extensively below, I must devote a few paragraphs to them here.\r\nA. x\r\n2\r\ni s itself distributed in the x\r\n2 distribution ; thus, if chance\r\nalone were at work, we should expect to find 10% of the values given\r\nin the Tables (i.e., 4-0 in the case of Table I and 3-8 in the case of\r\nTable II) lying between the limits 0-0000 and 0-0158, 10% between\r\n0-0158 and 0-0642, and so on up to the last 10% greater than 2-706.\r\n(Cf. Fisher, Statistical Methods for Research Workers, sections 15 and 20,\r\npp. 60 and 83 in 4th Edn.).\r\nWe compute x'\r\n2 from the observed and expected frequencies of the\r\noriginal ^\r\n2s in these classes and find the chance of the distribution\r\nbeing fortuitous from the tables of x\r\n2\r\ni Q the usual way. The number\r\nof degrees of freedom (hereinafter abbreviated to DF) is one less than\r\nthe number of classes used.*\r\nThe 40 values of Table I give (with 7 DF)\r\nX'\r\n2 = 2.20; P = -47 2\r\nwhich is negligible.\r\n* There is some divergence of opinion as to the minimum size of class (as\r\ndefined by the frequency expected) which it is legitimate to use. A minimum\r\nexpectation of 5 is on the safe side, but we shall not come to much harm if we relax this to 4-0 (or 3-8, say, for Table II) where the figures make it convenient.\r\nJone 1935 Experiments in Precognitive Guessing 91\r\nB. The sum of a number of ^\r\n2s is distributed in the x\r\n2 distribution,\r\nwith DF equal to the sum of the DF associated with the constituent\r\ny\r\n2s. Where this last sum is greater than 30, so that the corresponding values of P are not given in the tables, we use the fact that\r\nV\r\n\/2x2 ~ V2u - 1 is distributed with unit standard error, where n is the\r\nnumber of DF concerned.\r\nApplying this to Table I we obtain\r\nS( x\r\n2\r\n) = 52-306 ; P = -09 3\r\nwhich is far from significant, though \" signs of life \", as one might say, are beginning to appear.\r\nThis test is more sensitive than A, where precautions of the kind\r\nindicated in the note are apt to have a somewhat repressive effect. On\r\nthe other hand, it is perhaps unduly affected by the smaller fragments\r\nas compared with the larger groups.\r\nC. In cases where the groups considered contain equal number of\r\nguesses, e.g., the sets shown in Table II, we may compare those observed with the expected variance of the success scores. The former\r\nis given by\r\nwhere m is the number of groups, and the latter by npq, where n is the\r\nnumber of guesses in a group, p the chance of a guess being right, and\r\nq the chance of its being wrong.\r\nThe expected ratio of the two quantities is unity with standard\r\nerror V2\/(m - 1) + l\/\u00bbmq.\r\nSince we are here concerned only with dispersion, I use p and q', the a posteriori chances instead of the a priori p and q. These of course\r\nare S\/N and (N-S)\/N respectively, where S is the grand total of\r\nsuccesses for all groups and N the grand total of guesses.\r\nApplying this to the 38 set scores of Table II, and writing OV for the\r\nobserved and EV for the expected variance, we get\r\nOV\/EV = 1-2125 ; P = -18 4\r\nwhere P is the chance of the excess of observed over expected variance\r\nbeing accidental.\r\nWe may apply the same process to the 370 sheet scores of Table II, or to the 1,480 column totals (not reproduced) and obtain\r\nFor sheets OV\/EV = -9886; P = -44 5\r\nFor columns OV\/EV = 1-0021 ; P = -48 6\r\nIt will be noted that the observed variance for sheets is actually\r\nsmaller than the expected, though negligibly so. D. In cases where, in addition to the groups containing equal numbers\r\nof guesses, they can be divided into sub-groups of equal size, e.g., the\r\nsheets of Table II, we may apply the full ritual of the Analysis of\r\nVariance, in precisely the same way as for the study of the quantity\r\ntermed \" Individuality \" in my analysis of reaction times, etc., in the\r\n92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\ncase of trance personalities. The details are too elaborate to describe\r\nhere.\r\nThis method is potentially important because it takes account of\r\nthe consistency or otherwise of the subjects in addition to their gross\r\nscores. The latter might be nothing startling, yet might become\r\nsignificant if the internal consistency were high. For example, a subject scoring 21 in all ten sets would yield a value of P, by the method\r\nusing only the gross score of -22 ; yet the chance of his scoring above\r\nexpectation ten times running is a good deal less than one in a thousand.\r\nMutatis mutandis, the same applies to the problem we are here considering.\r\n6. We will now apply these methods, as appropriate, to various\r\nselections of data and tabulate the results. The figures in brackets\r\nare result numbers for purposes of future reference, if need be.\r\nN.B.\u2014A tiresome complication arises here, however, because in the\r\ncase of an important subject (No. 7) a whole column (30 guesses) was\r\nomitted from the second sheet of the first set. This makes no difference to the y\r\n2 figures, which are computed from the guesses actually made ; but it upsets methods C and D, for which homogeneous material is necessary. In working these figures I have accordingly credited the\r\nsubject with the expected score, namely five successes, for this column\r\n(judging by the rest of her performance she is more likely to have scored\r\nsix), which seems the least misleading procedure and likely to give the\r\nmost reliable results.

For the most part, there is little reason\r\nto suspect the operation of anything but chance, although\u2014if the\r\nordinary affairs of life alone were concerned\u2014we should scarcely\r\nhesitate to accept results 19 and 23 as significant. The latter is very peculiar, and I do not profess to understand it, but the former\r\nstrongly suggests that, in \"fresh\" (first attempt) sets, there is a tendency for subjects to score unnaturally high or unnaturally low.\r\nPersonally, I should hesitate about hanging the proverbial dog\r\non this evidence alone, and I certainly should not care to rest a case\r\nfor precognition on it. On the other hand, if we find\u2014as I think\r\nwe shall\u2014that there is good reason, on other grounds, for concluding\r\nthat something of a precognitive character is going on, then we\r\nmay legitimately interpret these results as indicating that the\r\n\" freshness \" of a set is important to its operation, and that it is liable to operate in either direction\u2014that is to say, either towards\r\nsuccess, or, by reversal, towards failure. I do not think that the study of dispersion can usefully be carried\r\nfurther, but before I leave the topic there is one point of considerable\r\nmethodological importance to be noted. The tendency to high\r\ndispersion may be genuine\u2014I think it is\u2014but, even so, it is clear\r\nthat it could not be deduced with assurance from a mere inspection\r\nof the figures\u2014that is to say, it is not manifestly and without need\r\nof testing beyond the reasonable range of chance. Consequently, if we had been testing these subjects as a matter of routine, it would\r\nhave been dangerous to pick out the best (and\/or worst) performers\r\nfor intensive study, since we should expect to get very much this\r\nrange of success and failure, by chance alone, in a sample of this\r\nsize. We might then find ourselves in the position of trying to\r\naccount for an apparent lapse of paranormal faculty by searching\r\nfor change of conditions, etc., whereas the original high (or low)\r\nscore, though intrinsically \" significant \", would have been only one of the abnormal scores to be expected in a large sample. The\r\nfull epistemology here is evidently not easy, but it seems clearly\r\nindicated that it is likely to be better to work with a considerable\r\ngroup of subjects (if only to provide a night sky against which\r\nthe stars may shine) until, if ever, some establish their regular\r\nparanormality by the consistency of their performances.\r\n7. Reference to Table II will show that the totals for the different\r\nsheets (occasions)\u2014i.e. the numbers 714, 753 ... etc., at the foot of\r\nthe page\u2014vary in an apparently very remarkable manner. Table IV shows these totals split up for fresh, experimenter,\r\n94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\netc., sets, while the line of Ps shows the probabilities, obtained by\r\nmethod D, that the inter-total variations are a matter of chance alone.\r\nN.B.\u2014It is necessary to adopt some such procedure for the kind\r\nof reason I have just discussed. The chance of obtaining 817\r\nsuccesses in 37 x 120 = 4,440 throws, as for the sixth sheets, is small ; the expectation is 740 and the observed excess over it is 77 ; whence\r\nwe have\r\ny\r\n* = 4-807 ; P=-03 v.n 37\r\nBut we have to consider this result, not as an isolated event, but\r\nin the observed context of nine others, and to ask how often variations of the kind shown by these totals are likely to occur by chance\r\nin a sample of this size.

Again, the results are far\r\nfrom justifying the conclusion that anything paranormal is occurring ; but, again also, if we accept this on other grounds, we shall\r\nfind them interesting. The suggestion is that some psychological\r\neffect favourable to success is produced at the sixth \" sitting \" \u2014e.g. the feeling that half the rather tedious business is over and\r\nthe back of the work broken ; while the same sort of thing occurs\r\nat the ninth\u2014perhaps that \" the end is in sight \". The last sheets\r\nwe must suppose to be done casually and merely for the sake of\r\ngetting the job finished. The possibility of fitting some such\r\npsychological explanation to the facts seems to me to add greatly\r\nto the likelihood that they are not, in fact, fortuitous\u2014it would have\r\nbeen different if, for example, the peaks had come at the fourth and\r\nseventh sheets ; and, incidentally, we have here again (supposing\r\nthe indications to be veridical) good indirect testimony to the bona\r\nJune 1935 Experiments in Precognitive Guessing !>.->\r\nfides of the subjects. It seems very unlikely that they would\r\nextensively decide to throw in a few spurious successes in the sixth\r\nsheet, and conscientiously remove them from other sheets so as to\r\nmake the grand total come to the expected value ! But I am running far ahead of my data here and we must now\r\nturn to a quite different form of analysis, which does seem to show\r\nconclusively that some factor other than chance is at work.\r\n8. So far we have concerned ourselves only with the numbers of\r\nsuccesses ; we will now discuss their grouping.\r\nSince the chance of any given success being followed by another\r\nis, in general, one sixth, it is easy to see that a certain number of \" runs \" of two, three, four or more successes will occur, even if chance alone is at work. Theoretically, one sixth of the guesses\r\nshould be successful, and twenty-five thirty-sixths of these successes should be singletons while the others are followed by one\r\nor more further successes. But in practice it is undesirable to deal with the pairs, threes,\r\netc., partly because it is unduly laborious and partly because the\r\nexpectations soon become too small to be useful. But we can\r\nestimate the normality of the grouping, or \" packing as I may\r\nterm it, just as well by comparing the observed with the expected\r\nnumber of \" singletons \"\r\n; for there will be a deficiency of these if the\r\npacking is \" close \" (i.e., if there is an undue tendency to form pairs,\r\nthrees, etc.) and an excess if it is \" loose \". This is equivalent to enquiring whether the fact of guessing\r\nsuccessfully makes the subject more or less likely to guess successfully\r\nnext time. Either would involve a paranormal factor of essentially\r\nprecognitive character, but again we have the possibility of this\r\nworking in either of two opposite directions.\r\nIt is important to note that, in calculating the expected numbers\r\nof singletons we must not use the a priori values, one sixth and\r\nfive sixths, for the chances of success and failure, but a posteriori\r\nvalues calculated from the known number of successes in the\r\ngroup. Our problem is not \" how many singletons do we expect\r\nto find in a group of n guesses ? \" (to which the answer is 25n\/216)\r\nbut \" how many singletons in a group of n guesses of which a total\r\nof t have been successful ? \" We want to know, in fact, whether\r\nthe packing is abnormally close or loose given the number of successes actually observed in the group.\r\nThe singletons have, naturally, been scored by sheets, because\r\neach sheet was (in general) the product of a separate session, and I have allowed myself the slight latitude of treating each sheet as a\r\n\" ring \"\u2014that is to say, of pretending that the first guess follows\r\n96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\non the last, so that if both were successful a pair would be counted\r\ninstead of two singletons. This avoids trouble with end effects and is quite harmless in view of the fact that, as will appear below, I have\r\ndeveloped a purely differential method for testing the results obtained.\r\nIn these circumstances, the expected number of singletons is E=t(n- l)(n-t- 1) \/(n - l)(n - 2)\r\nwhere n is the number of guesses in the group and t the total number\r\nof successes. Then if s is the number of singletons actually observed in the\r\ngroup we have\r\nTotal successes observed - t Singleton expected - E\r\n,, ,, observed - - - g Difference - - - - E - s Grouped , , expected - - - t - E\r\n,, ,, observed - - - t \u2014 s Difference - - - - - s-E\r\nWhence %\r\n2 equals (E - s)2 \/E + (s - E)2 \/{t - E), which reduces to\r\nf(s-E)2 \/E(\u00ab-E).\r\n9. We are thus in a position to test any group or, by methods A\r\nor B above, any group of groups\u2014for normality of packing, and as soon as I applied the test, very remarkable results began to emerge.\r\nIt so happens that there are 57 groups of data in my files, namely\r\n38 complete sets of 1,200 and 19 assorted fragments of varying\r\nsizes. Each of these has some kind of claim to autonomy (that is why they are separated) and it therefore seemed appropriate to use these 57 groups as units, so to speak, for the test and to determine the value of y\r\n2 as above for each.\r\nI accordingly calculated the expected number of singletons for\r\neach sheet, summed these expectations for the group, and computed y\r\n2 from the difference between this sum and that for the singletons\r\nactually observed in the group. High values of y\r\n2 were comparatively common and S(y2\r\n) for the 57 groups came to 129-054 ; V2y2 is 16-066 and V2 x 57- 1 is 10-630 ; the difference between\r\nthese is 5-436 and since this difference is distributed with unit\r\nstandard error (cf. section 5 B above) the probability of the observed\r\neffect being due to chance is something less than 10~7\r\n, or one in\r\nten million, (EN 43).\r\n10. This result constitutes coercive evidence of \" anomalous\r\npacking \" and, if it is veridical, is clearly of the very utmost importance, for there can be no reasonable doubt that some potent factor\r\nother than chance in the usual sense of the word must be involved.\r\nJune 1935 Experiments in Precognitive Guessing 97\r\nOn the other hand, it might be contended that it is at least not\r\ninconceivable that the effect is due to some peculiarity of the\r\n\" distribution \"\u2014in the statistical sense\u2014of the guesses or throws,\r\nor both ; as, for example, by the subjects calling numbers in far\r\nfrom equal proportions and\/or the dice being biassed or improperly\r\nthrown. A suitable combination of the two abnormalities could,\r\nof course, account for high or low scoring, but I cannot see at present\r\nhow it could affect the packing here studied. But this may be due\r\nmerely to my own limitations and, in any event, it is always better\r\nto \" try the experiment \".\r\nI accordingly went through all the material again, comparing\r\neach guess, not with the throw for which it was intended, but with\r\nthe next. I then repeated the process scoring each guess against\r\nthe throw next but one. I shall refer to these as \" plus one \" and\r\n\" plus two \" comparisons (or guesses, successes, etc.) respectively.\r\nThe following figures should serve to make all clear :\r\nThe two fours constitute a normal success ; the two threes a \" plus one \" success ; and the two twos a\r\n\" plus two \" success.\r\nIt will be understood that we have to discard the first throw\r\nand the last guess when scoring for plus one successes, and the first two throws and last two guesses when scoring for plus two successes. We are accordingly left with 99-17% and 98-33% of the original\r\nmaterial arranged in the original order : the only significant\r\ndifference is that for the normal scoring the guesses were, so to say, \" aimed \" at the throws with which they are compared, while in\r\nthe other two cases they were not. This puts the whole enquiry on\r\na pleasantly differential basis and effectively short-circuits, I believe, any possibility of artifacts arising from abnormalities of\r\ndistribution, etc., of the kind just mentioned.\r\nI also repeated, of course, the whole procedure of calculating\r\n#\r\n2s for singletons as already described. Repeating the result for\r\nnormal successes we have :\r\nG\r\n4\r\nT\r\ni\r\nS(x2\r\n) p\r\nio-7 \u2022045\r\n17\r\nNormal singletons 129-054\r\nPlus one \u201e 80-017\r\nPlus two \u201e 72-258\r\n43\r\n1\r\n1\r\n45\r\n98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\nThe difference between the normal and plus one figures is obvious and can also be directly tested for significance as follows : V2%\r\n2 - \/2n - 1 is distributed with unit standard error (cf. Fisher,\r\nloc. cit., 4th Edn., p. 62) whence, by the ordinary rules,\r\nV2\/a\r\n2 - is distributed with standard error (N.B. \u2014This, as Professor Fisher points out, \" comes very neatly to the same\r\nas saying that %2 has a standard error unity \" and is \" a new\r\nand pleasing peculiarity \".)\r\nApplying this we have\r\n(V2X , 0\r\n2 - V\r\n\/2^7)\/V2 = 2-415 and P = -01 46\r\nfor the chance that the value of S(;r) for the normal singletons\r\nexceeds that for the plus one singletons as a result of chance alone.\r\nThe difference between the values for plus one and plus two\r\nsingletons is not significant, and it is for consideration whether\r\nthe value for P of -045 for the former is accidental or genuine.\r\nThe sum of ^\r\n2s for plus one and plus two singletons combined\r\nis 152-275 with 114 DF and this gives a value of P = -02 (RN 47).\r\nOn the whole I think there is little doubt that the effect of\r\nanomalous packing which is so very marked for normal successes extends also in lesser degree to those of the plus one and plus two\r\nvariety.\r\nIf my strength were as the strength of ten and I could command\r\na forty-eight hour working day, I would pursue the point a few\r\nstages further, that is to say, for plus three, plus four, etc., successes. As it is, I fear that refinements of this kind will have to wait until\r\nwe have a machine which will score guesses and throws (or other\r\nevents) mechanically and will also enable us to count normal and\r\n\" plus-w \" successes by singletons, pairs, threes, etc., automatically.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity of saying that, unless the\r\nforegoing results be wholly rejected, the provision of such a machine\r\n(which should not prove prohibitively difficult to design or expensive\r\nto construct) appears to me to be almost indispensable for the\r\nproper prosecution of this class of work and of paragnostic studies\r\ngenerally.\r\nThe foregoing shows clearly how material which is of no apparent\r\ninterest when taken in bulk may become highly informative when\r\nmethods of sufficient resolving power are applied to its fine structure.\r\nAnd I speak from experience when I say that\u2014quite apart from\r\nconsiderations of accuracy and error\u2014the application of such\r\nmethods of deep analysis by human labour alone is quite impracticable on any extensive scale or as a matter of routine.\r\nJune 1935 Experiments in Precognitive Guessing\r\n11.

There are 26 fresh and 15 non- experimenter sets, because my own first set can be used here. Values of P\r\nmarked * are actually much less than -01, but the tables available do not go\r\nbeyond this point.\r\nThese results may be taken as numbered for reference from 47 to 67 in- clusive, starting with the first of the second line and reading successive lines from left to right in the obvious way.\r\nThe change over from the \" superiority \" of fresh and experimenter sets for normal successes to the reverse for plus ones and\r\nplus twos is very remarkable and unquestionably significant ; but\r\nI cannot at the moment account for it. Among the 57 groups just discussed there are 24 \" close packed \" and 33 \" loose packed \" : the expectation is, of course, 28-5 on the\r\nhypothesis of chance alone, and this leads to\r\n#\r\n2 =1421 ; P = -12 v.n 68\r\nwhich is no more than suggestive. The indication is that, generally\r\nspeaking, a successful guess tends to reduce rather than increase\r\nthe chance of another success immediatelv following ; the effect\r\nof success, in fact, appears to be inhibitory, but more work is needed\r\nto settle the point fully.\r\n12. We may conclude with complete assurance that there is a non-chance factor involved in the \" packing \" of normal successes,\r\nand that this probably (though much less certainly) extends to\r\nplus one successes and possibly, in smaller degree, to plus two\r\nsuccesses also. The differential method employed has made it clear that this effect cannot be due to any peculiarities of the data\r\nthemselves (or, if the tendency to abnormal packing among plus one and plus two successes be ascribed to this, then there must be\r\n100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\nsignificantly a further factor operating in the case of normal successes). There remains, however, as so often in the present state\r\nof psychical research, the odious question of possible falsification or pathological mis-scoring by the subjects and\/or experimenters.\r\nI need hardly say that I am, on principle, only too anxious to\r\nthink the worst of my subjects, and if there had been any marked\r\ntendency towards positive (successful) results in the bulk data,\r\nI should naturally have pressed the successful subjects for a repetition\r\nof the experiment under strict conditions ; indeed, I intimated\r\nmy intention of doing so in the memorandum which I circulated\r\nat the beginning of the work. Actually, as we have seen, any score above expectation is just about offset by a corresponding score below expectation ; so that, even if the observed dispersion were\r\nsignificantly greater than that attributable to chance, we should\r\nhave to postulate substantially equal and opposite inexactitudes\r\namong those concerned.\r\nGenerally speaking, of course, the opportunities for what I have\r\nbroadly termed \" leakage \" are much smaller in the case of precognitive material than where we are concerned with paragnosis\r\nof other kinds. No amount of peeking and peering\u2014whether\r\ndeliberate or otherwise\u2014will enable a subject to see a non-yethappened event as it might enable him to see a contemporaneously\r\nexistent card, for example. False results due to such causes can\r\nonly be ascribed to deliberate distortion or almost criminal carelessness\u2014indeed, even the latter must be systematic, for it must\r\nnever be forgotten that random mis-scoring can never lead to\r\nstatistically significant results.\r\nI am happy to say that I can find no trace of either factor being\r\noperative ; on the contrary the internal evidence in favour of\r\nperfect probity and great care throughout the subjects and experimenters is so strong as to be, humanly speaking, conclusive.\r\nIn the first place, in order to attribute the anomalous packing\r\nto causes of this kind, we should have to suppose that rather more\r\nthan half of those concerned adopted, in varying degrees, the\r\nstrange trick of neither inventing nor suppressing successes but\r\nmerely putting them in the wrong place, carefully separated from\r\ntheir neighbours ; while there was a tendency in the remainder\r\nto do the same kind of displacement in the opposite sense ; in the\r\nsecond, these peculiar operations must be carried on (with a remarkable degree of unanimity) in such a way as to ensure the emergence\r\nof the significant results 60 and 61, 66 and 67 (plus one and plus\r\ntwo singletons for non-fresh and non-experimenter sets). Frankly,\r\nI find the suggestion quite fantastic and incredible.\r\nJune 1935 Experiments in Procognitive Guessing 101\r\nApart from this, however, it must be remembered that more\r\nwould be involved than the mere scoring of a success where none had taken place. Inasmuch as every guess and throw was entered on the sheets, it would be necessary to falsify one entry or the\r\nother, in order to make a success appear. Assuming that chance\r\nalone were operative over the remaining entries, this would necessarily involve, I think, the introduction of a tendency towards\r\npositive correlation of the guesses and throws as regards the\r\nfrequencies of the ones, twos, threes, etc., called and thrown. Certainly it would do so in the extreme limit of writing down as a throw (regardless of facts) the same number, in every case, that\r\nhad already been recorded as guessed ; presumably, therefore,\r\nthough the argument is a trifle tricky, the same would apply pro rata on a small scale. If chance alone were at work, we should expect positive correlations to be just as common as negative, but no commoner ; if falsification were operative, we should expect to find them commoner. What we actually do find is that they are a good deal rarer. Admittedly, of the 57 groups mentioned, 23 show an excess of\r\npositive correlations and 34 of negative ; while of the 440 sheets\r\ncomposing them 204 are positive to 230 negative and 6 zero. Neither\r\nof these yield significant results, but for the 40 subjects, I find no fewer than 28 showing a preponderance of negatively correlated\r\nsheets to 12 with a preponderance of positively correlated. This\r\nis significant, for we have\r\n\u00a32=6-4 ; P--01 69\r\nEven if the argument just adduced is imperfect, we must additionally credit our performers with the perverted ingenuity necessary\r\nto bring about this very curious result, in addition to the complications already mentioned.\r\nAlternatively we shall regard it as another example of the very\r\nqueer tendency towards the opposite of what one would expect,\r\nwhich is constantly cropping up in this work.\r\nIt seems also just worth noting that the only discernible con- nection between packing and scoring is that, of the 38 sets considered, the 20 which score more than 200 (expectation) have\r\nmean values for the corresponding singleton yj\r\n1 (normal successes) :\r\nFor loose packing, 29-285 ; for close packing, 14-889 70\r\nwhile the 18 which score less than 200 have mean values\r\nFor loose packing, 11-587 ; for close packing, 18-784 71\r\nThese figures look significant, though I do not know how to test\r\n102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\nthem. They imply that success in bulk scoring is associated with\r\nthat property which tends to prevent one individual success being\r\nimmediately followed by another.\r\nTo sum up : Unless some method of systematic mis-scoring can\r\nbe suggested (not too preposterous intrinsically) which will account\r\nfor all the significant results observed, it will be unreasonable to\r\ninvoke such causes in explanation of the effects. Humanly speaking, I am confident that this is impossible, and I accordingly have\r\nlittle hesitation in saying that I regard the operation of some paranormal factor of precognitive character as established beyond\r\nany reasonable doubt.\r\n13. In these circumstances we can better appreciate the remarkable performance of Mr X, to which I referred in section 3 above.\r\nThis gentleman's records showed no fewer than 407 successes in\r\n1,200 trials. This gives a value for f of 257-094 (RN 72) and a chance of accidental occurrence of one in more millions than are worth working out : I decline to pander to a depraved taste for\r\nastronomical figures. In other words, we may dismiss the chance\r\nhypothesis without further ado.\r\nIn this set the scoring was done by Mrs X, and I understand\r\nthat although the subject himself shook the die, he threw it in such\r\na manner that he could not see the result. No third party was\r\npresent as witness at any session, and it will readily be understood\r\nthat the receipt of these forms placed me in something of a quandary.\r\nThe great truth that one swallow does not make a summer, no\r\nmatter how handsome a bird it may be, is fundamental to critical\r\nstatistics. Moreover, if, in the light of our general knowledge of\r\nnature and of mankind, we ask the straight question : Is it more\r\nlikely that a man can \" foretell future events \" to this order of\r\nsuccess, or that a lady\u2014of whatsoever probity and intelligence\r\nmight in such circumstances inadvertently render unto Caesar\r\nmore than Caesar's due ? even St Paul would forgive us, I think,\r\nfor halting between two opinions. In particular it seemed to me\r\npossible that the monotonous occupation of watching throws and\r\nentering figures might, in a sensitive subject, induce some kind of\r\ndissociated state in which the natural desire for Mr X's success would over-ride the very artificial conventions defining accuracy in\r\nsuch a context. (N.B.\u2014When a die is thrown, three faces are usually visible without difficulty ; it is only a convention, with\r\nwhich the subconscious may well be unconcerned, which decrees\r\nthat only one of them is to be used for scoring successes.)\r\nThe hypothesis is admittedly far-fetched ; but so is that of\r\nparanormally bringing off 407 successes in 1,200 trials.\r\nJune 1935 Experiments in Precognitive Guessing 103\r\nSuch invidious positions are constantly arising in psychical\r\nresearch at its present stage of development, and much futile\r\ncontroversy and heartburn is occasioned by the failure to realize\r\nthe simple question of greater or less probability which is always\r\ninvolved.\r\nHowever, the whole question takes on a different aspect now that\r\nwe have decided, on other grounds, that something of a paranormal\r\nand precognitive character is taking place in other cases ; for\r\nthere is nothing, in principle, more improbable about scoring\r\n407 successes (or any other number) precognitively than about\r\nhaving any sort of cognitive relationship with a future event ; the\r\ndifference is one of degree rather than of kind, and prudence is not\r\nserved by straining at the conspicuous gnat while quietly swallowing\r\nthe less evident camel.\r\nIn the context, therefore, of the significant and paranormal,\r\nalbeit recondite, results obtained from other subjects, I have\r\nnegligible hesitation in accepting Mr X's achievement at its face\r\nvalue, and our next step should be to enquire what light Mr X's\r\nremarkable performance throws on the nature of the general process\r\nwe have been examining.\r\n14. Result No. 43, supported by various indications, tells us that the relationship between guess and throw is not a matter of\r\nchance alone ; the application of the differential method by means\r\nof \" echelon scoring \", leading to RN 46, assures us that this is not\r\ndue to peculiarities of the guesses or throws as such, but to their\r\nrelation to each other ; RN 44 and 47 strongly suggests that the\r\ninfluence of the non-chance factor extends, in reduced degree, to\r\nthrows later than that to which the guess is intended to refer.\r\nI conclude that something in the nature of precognition occurs,\r\nbut that in order to make a successful precognitive guess, three\r\nfactors are necessary :\r\n1. What I may term a bare prescience, or awareness, of the\r\n(most probable form of the) future event :\r\n2. The correct location of this prescience with respect to two\r\nor more events to which it might refer :\r\n3. The correct utilization of this located prescience by\r\nreacting in the right direction ; that is to say, by calling what\r\nthe prescience indicates and not what it excludes.\r\nThe frequent occurrence of contrary-to-expectation results\r\nstrongly suggests that the subjects are just about as likely to call paranormally wrong as paranormally right. Compare, here, Dr\r\n104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1935\r\nRhine's results on the effects of fatigue and disinclination which\r\nsuggest, as Mr Tyrrell says, that \" there exists a subconscious,\r\ncontrolling influence of some sort which has the power of enhancing,\r\ninhibiting or even of reversing the results.\"\r\nWe are thus led to the interesting view that precognitive ability\r\nconsists not so much in a\r\n\" foreknowledge of the future \"\u2014whatever\r\nthat may mean\u2014as in a successful use of the foreknowledge available. The difference between a good precognizer and a bad one would seem to be that the former can correctly apply his prescience\r\nor \" contact with the event while with the latter it is either\r\nmuddled or actively perverted. I have no doubt that the faculty\r\nof bare prescience varies considerably between different individuals ; but I certainly have the impression that its correct utilization is the crux of the matter, and this is likely to depend on delicate\r\npsychological factors the importance of which is emphasized by\r\nboth Tyrrell and Rhine.\r\n15. In this connection, the method adopted by Mr X in the\r\ncourse of his record-making set is of great interest. He writes : \"... the method I used . . . consisted of variations of the following : I would note the objects in my view and then simply select groups of\r\nthese, giving the number arrived at by taking, say, four chimneys on a\r\nroof, three legs visible of a chair at my side, six folds in the curtains,\r\nand so on. Then, as a change, I would switch to the numerals of my\r\nown birthdate\u2014 1 1 5 1 6 3 2\u2014that is, 11th May 1902. Then in the same vein I would take the birthdays of my family. Another run of\r\nfigures would come from taking the numbers of the various houses\r\nwe have resided in. . . . Naturally a certain amount of selectivity\r\nentered into these methods, and I simply followed the whim of the\r\nmoment.\"\r\nThis suggests that the trick is to occupy the foreconscious loosely, so to speak, with possible numbers and leave it to the subconscious\r\nto say \" snap \", as it were, when the right number occurs, rather\r\nthan to strain after results by attempts at visualization, etc. There\r\nis also a strong impression abroad (not yet studied) to the effect\r\nthat high speed of guessing is conducive to success ; this would fit in well with what has just been said.\r\nThese last speculations apart, however, it is clear that the investigation not only establishes the fact of precognitive paragnosis\r\nto a high order of probability (in my strong opinion, at any rate)\r\nbut also tells us a fair amount about the kind of thing that is going on.\r\nNo. 517.\u2014Vol. XXIX July 1935\r\nJOURNAL\r\nOF THE\r\nSociety for Psychical Research\r\nThe Rooms of the Society will be closed after Wednesday,\r\n31 July, until Monday, 9 September.

We must institute a Department of Psychic Aerology without delay. Every fraudulent\r\nmedium in the world will apply for membership.\r\nNow all this has a familiar ring to anyone who knows anything of\r\nthe history of spiritualism. The same argument has been used to\r\ndefend every clumsy experiment or blatant imposture. Just as Mr Tyrrell's entity \" has complete power over the course of the\r\nexperiments \" so is it claimed that the critical mind can cause as much havoc in the seance room as an earthquake. Bad spirits may\r\nbe attracted to the evil thinker and either there will be no results at\r\nall or wrecking tactics may become apparent.\r\nAlthough Mr Tyrrell states that the conditions to which the entity\r\nis responsive are delicate and elusive yet some other equally mysterious entity seems to inform him of what is occurring, just as another\r\nentity informed Dr Rhine (judging from his correspondence with\r\nme) that were I to visit Carolina in order to see his marvels my time\r\nwould be a total loss. How do these gentlemen know these things ? Mr Tyrrell knows that Miss Johnson's scoring will go down if the\r\nconversation is turned to a slightly unpleasant subject just before an\r\nexperiment. How does he know that that was the reason ? How\r\ndoes he know that it was not because Miss Johnson's tea was not the\r\nright temperature, or because his bacon was not of the right brand\r\nor because the moon was not in the right quarter ? Seriously the\r\nsituation is becoming a little farcical, and I strongly suspect that the\r\n108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1935\r\n\" entity \" that prompted Mr Tyrrell's letter was the knowledge that\r\nrecent alleged reproductions of Dr. Rhine's experiments are not\r\nillustrating the occurrence of E. S. P. For the new gospel is this. Conditions are \" right \" when E. S. P. can be demonstrated. If there\r\nis no E. S. P. then conditions are \" wrong.\" (Are these to be\r\ncounted ?) What we want is our E. S. P. and we mean to get it. Well, they will, and others at least will have the opportunity of\r\nenjoying a good laugh.\r\nE. J. Dingwall.\r\n[Mr Dingwall is surely confusing a sympathetic atmosphere, that\r\nis, an atmosphere which seeks to avoid conditions likely to have an\r\ninhibitory effect upon the percipient, with an atmosphere lacking\r\nin scientific precision or favourable to fraud. It is quite possible to\r\nbe psychologically sympathetic on the one hand, and both accurate\r\nand observant on the other. Any one who finds a difficulty in\r\ncombining these two conditions had better leave psychical research\r\nseverely alone.\r\n\r\nHon. Ed.]\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014In his letter to the Journal, Mr Tyrrell draws attention\r\nto a necessity in the repetition of Dr Rhine's experiments which I probably did not sufficiently emphasise in my review. Similar\r\nresults cannot be expected unless essential psychological conditions\r\nare reproduced. A condition emphasised by Rhine is absence of\r\neffort on the part of the subject ; a general attitude of optimism as\r\nto results is probably another. The possibility of psychological\r\nconditions not having been favourable should make us cautious in\r\ndrawing definite conclusions from any single experimenter's failure\r\nto get the same results. There does not, however, seem to be any\r\nsufficient reason for supposing the psychological conditions favourable to extra-sensory perception are so exceptionally difficult to\r\nobtain that competent experimenters used to paying attention to\r\nsuch factors in their work cannot be expected to be able to obtain\r\nthem. The positive results reported by Rhine are also stated by\r\nhim to have been obtained by a good many other people working at\r\nDuke University, therefore, one must suppose, with a good deal of\r\nvariation of psychological conditions. Those who wish to repeat\r\nthese exj:>eriments must take all the trouble they can to get favourable conditions. If, however, they were all to prove unable to get\r\nthe same results as Rhine reports, the supposition that we hi this\r\ncountry are unable to obtain favourable psychological conditions so\r\neasily obtained in America would be a somewhat improbable\r\nexplanation.\r\nJuly 1935 Reviews 109\r\nAs to what is the major issue in Dr Rhine's work. I simply disagree\r\nwith Mr Tyrrell. If, as Rhine believes, the existence of B.\" S. P. has\r\nbeen sufficiently proved by earlier investigations, it is of no interest\r\nto prove it all over again. The next step is to find out something\r\nabout it. It is true that no experiment or observation which cannot\r\nbe repeated at will can give certainty, since the probability of it being correct depends on the credibility of the experimenter which,\r\nhowever great it may be, is not infinite. But this margin of uncertainty is not much reduced by any single new set of experiments.\r\nThere are, I think, two major issues. First, has Dr Rhine discovered\r\nthat the capacity for E. S. P. is much more frequent than was\r\npreviously supposed ? If so, this is a new and important finding.\r\nSecondly, has he discovered a method of experimenting in telepathy\r\nand clairvoyance which is easily repeatable by any competent\r\nexperimenter ? If so, we need certainly worry no more about the\r\nproblem of the existence of E. S. P., since every sceptic can find out\r\nfor himself, and we can get on with the next step of finding out more\r\nabout it. Unhappily, as I said in my review, the evidence on the first of\r\nthese two points is inadequately stated in Rhine's book. Evidence on the second can only be obtained by widespread attempts at\r\nrepetition. I hope these attempts will be made, with the precautions which Mr Tyrrell so justly points out.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nRobert H. Thouless.\r\nREVIEWS\r\n\" Mr Dunne's Theory of Time in An Experiment with Time,\"\r\nby Professor C. D. Broad. Philosophy. Vol. X, No, 38,\r\nApril 1935. Macmillan & Co. Ltd. 3s. 6d.\r\nIn the March issue of the Journal I gave a short notice of Mr\r\nDunne\"s recent book, A Serial Universe, wherein he expounds\r\nfurther his theory of Time. In that notice I refrained from entering\r\ninto any criticism of the theory, which was fortunate, as it has now\r\nbeen done by our President, needless to say, far more competently\r\nthan I could ever have hoped to do, in the April number of Philosophy. Professor Broad follows his usual method of stating the\r\ntheory in his own terms and, as his statements are always characterised by that lucidity and exactness for which he is distinguished,\r\nthe method is an excellent one. Were all our philosophers able\r\nand willing to express their meaning as clearly and unambiguously\r\n110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1935\r\nas he does there would be far less confusion and misunderstanding\r\nand, I am tempted to say, considerably less \" philosophy \". The theory is not an easy one to formulate, and Professor Broad's\r\nstatement requires careful reading and some clear thinking, but,\r\ngiven these, I think that there should be no difficulty in understanding it. His primary purpose is to work out how Mr Dunne's\r\ntheory affords an explanation of precognition, and he starts with an account of Hinton's suggestions, given in his book on The\r\nFourth Dimension. Mr Dunne's theory, he says, is clearly based on Hinton's work. He then gives a clear account of that theory,\r\nillustrated with diagrams, and goes on to show how precognition\r\nmight be explained. He also deals with the point raised by those\r\n\" warning \" cases of precognition where the precognitive experience\r\ncauses action to be taken which prevents its complete fulfilment.\r\nHis explanation is based on the conception of a future which though\r\ndetermined is yet plastic.\r\nProfessor Broad then discusses Mr Dunne's concrete interpretation\r\nof his theory and rejects the idea that the \" Substratum \" is to be\r\nidentified with the Observer's brain. He states four assumptions\r\nwhich might be sufficient for a concrete interpretation of the\r\n\" Reagent \" but confesses that he is unable to discover any empirical\r\nobject with which he can identify it. Finally he deals with Mr Dunne's theory of \" Serialism \", which,\r\nso its author claims, is necessary apart from any evidence for\r\nprecognition.\r\nProfessor Broad rejects, not only this view, but also the theory\r\nof Serialism itself, holding that, even if it were true that the facts\r\nabout Time require us to postulate an infinite regress, the conclusion\r\ndrawn by McTaggart, viz. that of the non-reality of Time, is to be\r\npreferred : he does not, however, admit that any such regress is necessary.\r\nFor those who found Mr Dunne's two books rather heavy going\r\nI would recommend a careful study of this article, while those who\r\nwere able to assimilate Mr Dunne's theory from his own books\r\nwill find much further enlightenment as well as reasoned and\r\nauthoritative criticism in what Professor Broad has to say.\r\nH. F. S.\r\nJ. Arthur Hill, Towards Cheerfulness. Rider. 5s. Mr Hill's books on psychical research are well known. In Towards\r\nCheerfulness he gives us his personal reflections on psychical research\r\nand much else besides, on Shakespear's politics, on war and peace, on\r\ncure by suggestion, on the Yellow Peril. . . . He touches, in fact, on\r\nJuly 1935 Reviews 111\r\nmany subjects without perhaps going very deeply into any one of\r\nthem, writes with charm, great commonsense and quiet optimism,\r\nand is always easy to read.\r\nHe is, however, at his best on psychical research and spiritualism,\r\nand though he does not in this little book, present any of the evidence on which he bases his belief in survival (for this, the earlier books\r\nmust be read), his chapters on these subjects might well form a model introduction for those embarking on them for the first time.\r\nPerhaps his philosophy can best be illustrated by a quotation from\r\npage 179. \" Besides, from our own point of view, it is best to look at\r\nthe bright side of all possibilities. If the bright side turns out to be\r\nthe true one, we have done the right thing, and even if it does notwell, we have had the pleasure of the cheerfulness, and have been\r\nsaved from exercising a depressing effect on those around us. Therefore is it not legitimate to accept as much as we can of all optimistic ideas ? \"\r\nS. R. W. Wilson.\r\nOn Dreams. William Archer, edited by Th. Besterman. with an\r\nIntroduction by Prof. Gilbert Murray. Methuen. 7s. 6d. net. William Archer, the dramatist and dramatic critic, was interested\r\nin dreams, as Mr Besterman tells us. \" for over a quarter of a century,\r\nfor ten years of which he kept a careful record of his own dreams \".\r\nProf. Murray, a friend of long standing, describes him as\r\n;\r\n' one of\r\nthe extremely few people who could be trusted to give an exact\r\naccount of any experience he met with\u2014even of his dreams \", and\r\nas \" a most critical and disinterested observer \". Archer turned the\r\nlight of his own experience on to current theories as to the causes and meaning of dreams, and began a book, which he unfortunately never lived to complete, illustrating by examples chosen from his\r\ncollection points in these theories which seemed to him to call for\r\ncomment and criticism. The task of bringing the book out in the\r\nform the author apparently intended fell to Mr Besterman's ex- perienced hands.\r\nMuch of the book is devoted to a criticism of Freud's theories,\r\nwhich Archer thought \" not indeed baseless\u2014but stated with far too\r\ngreat generality \". Some of the dreams quoted suggest that the\r\nFreudian element was larger than the dreamer perhaps realised.\r\nOf the \" Supernormal \" there is little trace. One dream (pp. 193-\r\n195) may have been precognitive. Archer writes \" The thing is probably a mere co-incidence, but it is certainly odd \"\r\n; and that\r\nfairly states the case. The following passage is interesting : \u2014\" If I may trench just for\r\n112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1935\r\na moment on a dangerous domain, I would suggest that many of\r\nthe communications which purport to come from disembodied spirits\r\nproceed in fact from hints supplied by the sitter's subconsciousness,\r\ntransferred to the brain of the medium, and there dramatized by\r\nmuch the same mechanism, and much the same processes, as we find\r\nat work in dreams. I do not say, and do not think, that all alleged\r\nspirit-communications can be thus accounted for. . . . This implies\r\nof course that thought-transference lies within the sphere of normal\r\npsychology. I confess I cannot understand the state of mind of\r\nanyone who can ignore the mountains of evidence for its reality \". W. H.

Strutt, and the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas ; also Miss Isabel Newton, Secretary.\r\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read and signed\r\nas correct. A letter was read from Mr W. R. Bousfield resigning his seat on the\r\nCouncil on account of failing health. The Council accepted the\r\nresignation with much regret, and unanimously passed a resolution\r\nof thanks to Mr Bousfield for the work he has done as a Member of\r\nCouncil and for the valuable advice and help he has given on many\r\noccasions, particularly in connection with the revision of the Articles\r\nof Association.\r\nThe Council filled the vacant place among their elected members,\r\ncaused by Mr Bousfield's retirement, by appointing to it Professor\r\nC. D. Broad, hitherto a co-opted member.\r\n116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1935\r\nThe 333rd Meeting of the Council was held at 31 Tavistock Square,\r\nLondon, W.C. 1, on Wednesday, 25 September 1935, at 4 p.m.,\r\nSir Ernest Bennett in the Chair. There were also present\r\n:\r\nProfessor E. R. Dodds, Mr Gerald Heard, Miss Ina Jephson, the\r\nHon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., Mr W. PI. Salter, Mrs W. H.\r\nSalter, Mr S. G. Soal and the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas ; also Miss\r\nE. M. Horsell, Assistant-Secretary.\r\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read and\r\nsigned as correct. Eleven new Members and one Student Associate were elected.\r\nTheir names and addresses are given above.\r\nReports were received from Mr Whately Carington and Mr Kenneth\r\nRichmond with regard to the recent International Congress at Oslo.\r\nThe Council received with the very greatest regret a letter from\r\nProfessor F. C. S. Schiller, F.B.A., stating that owing to ill-health\r\nhe feared he would not in future be able to attend meetings of the\r\nCouncil, and tendering his resignation as a member of Council for\r\nthat reason. The Council wish to place on record their warm\r\nappreciation of the distinguished services that Professor Schiller has\r\nrendered the Society during the period of upwards of thirty years\r\nthat he has been their colleague, and they are glad to think that as Vice-President of the Society he will remain in close contact with\r\nthem and the Society.\r\nOBITUARY\r\nWe regret to record the death in July last of Major W. Rampling\r\nRose, for more than twenty years a member of the Society.\r\nMajor Rose, who was the founder and head of a large photographic business, and a recognised expert in matters relating to\r\nphotography, on many occasions placed his great knowledge of the\r\nsubject at the Society's service. In particular he was a keen student\r\nof \" psychic photography \", and in collaboration with Mr F. Barlow\r\nundertook a patient and thorough investigation of \" the Crewe\r\nCircle \" and Mrs Deane, of which a record appears in Proceedings,\r\nVol. XLI (pp. 121-138). He was also a generous contributor to the\r\nSociety's funds.\r\nWe also regret the loss sustained by the Society through the death\r\nof Mr. P. W. A. Cort van der Linden, Councillor of State, and\r\nformerly Professor of the University of Groningen, Holland. Mr.\r\nCort van der Linden was one of our oldest Associates, having been\r\nelected in 1890, and until his last illness followed the Society's work\r\nwith the keenest interest.\r\nOctober 1935 Private Meetings 117\r\nPRIVATE MEETINGS\r\nThe 137th Private Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\r\n26 June 1935, at 5.30 p.m., The President in the Chair.\r\nMiss Ina Jephson read a paper entitled \" Useful Ghosts \". An\r\ninteresting discussion followed, in which the President, Mr G. W.\r\nLambert, the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., Mr W. H. Salter\r\nand the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas took part.\r\nThe 138th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Society's\r\nLibrary on Wednesday, the 25 September 1935, Professor E. R.\r\nDodds being in the Chair, when Miss Evelyn M. Penrose read a paper on \" Divining for Water, Mineral and Oil \". Miss Penrose, who\r\nwas for some time employed as diviner by the Government of British\r\nColumbia, said that in Cornwall, her native county, divining for\r\nmetals had been employed long before divining for water, the first diviners having been brought over from Germany in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. She gave a demonstration of the methods and implements\r\nused by herself and other diviners. She referred in particular to\r\nrecent developments whereby she and others divine from a map\r\nwithout knowledge of the terrain concerned. Miss Penrose, who\r\ndisclaimed any psychic gifts, admitted she had no idea how this was\r\ndone, but said she found that in practice she could do it. She gave a very interesting account of her own sensations when dowsing.\r\nIn the discussion after the paper the following members took part,\r\nLady Barrett, Mrs Goldney, Mr K. Richmond, Col. A. H. Bell\r\n(President of the British Society of Dowsers), Prof. Stratton, Mr\r\nHarold Myers, Mr Hettinger, Mr Herbert and the Rev. C. Drayton\r\nThomas.\r\nNOTE ON PRECOGNITIVE GUESSES\r\nBy W. Whately Carington\r\nIt has been pointed out to me by Professor Fisher that unless we\r\nknow the distribution of singletons about their expected value (or\r\nat least the Variance of this value) it is impossible to determine\r\nwhether any deviation from this is significant. It follows that the\r\nconclusions reached in sections 8 to 12 of my \" Preliminary Experiments in Precognitive Guessing \" {Journal, June 1935, pp. 95-100) are not necessarily valid ; though it by no means follows, of course, that\r\nthey are necessarily invalid. They must in fact be put in cold storage\r\npending investigation of the point mentioned. This is now in hand.\r\nIt is worth noting, however, that study of grouping generally, and\r\nits association with success, and of the effect of preference with\r\n118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1935\r\nrespect to particular numbers on the successes obtained with, them\r\nreveals further anomalies difficult to ascribe to normal causes. The\r\nresults obtained will, I hope, be published shortly.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nLord Balfour's Paper on Mrs Willett's Scripts.\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nDear Madam,\u2014Having read Lord Balfour's article on Mrs Willett's\r\nScripts with great interest, and noticing the difficulty he finds in\r\nconceiving how the different layers of consciousness can show themselves as separate entities in cases of multiple personality and yet\r\nnot be separate selves, it has occurred to me that the analogy of\r\nwhat exists in the physical realm may be useful.\r\nIn the lowest unicellular animal we have an elementary individual\r\nsufficiently conscious of its environment to recognise its food and\r\nmove to it, and perform other functions.\r\nA little higher we have an animal consisting of a score or two of\r\nsuch cells. Each has the same essential structure as before, though\r\none is now more specially devoted to one function and another to\r\nanother. But in addition we find a higher self emerging, which\r\nco-ordinates the information received from the individual cells and\r\ncan direct and co-ordinate their movements. By their specialisation\r\nit has a better knowledge of its environment, i.e. a higher class of\r\nconsciousness. For what is consciousness but a perception of the\r\nenvironment ? Also there is no reason to think the individual cells have lost their\r\nselfhood, any more than individuals in an army because they obey\r\ntheir officers, though this may cause some of their activities to be in\r\nabeyance for the time.\r\nIn higher animals the same process has been extended. Groups\r\nof cells form various organs, each of which has still its own individuality\u2014the heart cut out of an animal just killed will go on beating\r\nfor a time.\r\nBut, again, here we have a higher self co-ordinating all these organs.\r\nIn health we are inclined to deny that our organs, let alone the\r\nindividual cells, are separate entities in the sense that an amoeba is one. But it is otherwise in illness ; for instance, in the case of cancer an individual cell starts multiplying regardless of its neighbours,\r\nand behaving just as the unicellular animal would do. Each organ,\r\ntoo, has its own selfhood, and if suitably fed can go on living and\r\nfunctioning for a long time when removed from the body.\r\nOctober 1935 Correspondence 119\r\nIn short, our bodies are composed of successive grades of \" selves,\"\r\nwhich, in health show no sign of their selfhood, but which in illness\r\nbecome apparent.\r\nMay there not be something of a similar character in our mental\r\nnature ? The supreme \" I \" co-ordinating lower grades of consciousness and thought, from which it draws knowledge of its environment and whose thoughts it utilises, without suspecting that they\r\nare subordinate selves, which in disease or other disturbance of the\r\nusual order may manifest their separate individualities.\r\nThe \" supraliminal consciousness \" on this view would therefore\r\nconsist of the supreme ego co-ordinating such of the subsidiary selves as are of use to it in its ordinary life (in the language of the scripts \" which pay \"), while the subliminal are those which it can leave to\r\nfunction by themselves (the ordinary bodily ones), and those which\r\nare not immediately useful to it in this life. While therefore this difficulty does not seem very serious to me,\r\nthe scripts raise another in my mind, a difficulty which has continually met me in many automatic messages, but which is specially\r\nevident in these.\r\nThe scripts give a clear account of the elaborate series of interactions between communicators and the subliminal of the autonomist\r\nnecessary to enable some simple idea, e.g. fire, to emerge. And yet they can pour forth pages of abstruse explanations with hardly a check.\r\nIt is this more than anything else which casts doubt on the\r\npersonality of the communicators. If they are merely subliminals\r\nthey can pour out their unverifiable ideas easily, but when they\r\ncome to veridical matters, of which they gain fragmentary knowledge by telepathy, then they only can stumble along. If this were\r\nso it could be understood, but if they are what they claim to be it\r\nis very hard to understand, and I should be most interested to know\r\nif there is any reasonable explanation of it. Yours, etc., J. H. HuME-RoTHERY.\r\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities.\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I congratulate Mr Whately Carmgton on the\r\nexemplary scientific integrity he displays in his paper in Part 141\r\n(Vol. XLIII) of Proceedings I I wish the spirit shown in section 10 of\r\nthat paper were more often met with in psychical research.\r\nMr Carmgton having so readily acknowledged the error of his\r\n120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1935\r\nformer ways, and having pretty plainly hinted that his present conclusions are not yet to be taken as the true gospel, I hope it will not seem ungenerous if I question whether even now he goes far enough\r\nin this direction. Mr Carington, of course, knows and says that facts are holy things, but I think he is still too ready to regard as \" facts \"\r\nthe data handed to him by myself and others. I most cordially\r\nagree with sections (2) and (I) of Mr Maby's \" Note \". I have\r\nrepeatedly urged similar considerations. From my own experience\r\nin recording these data and in watching others record them, I have\r\nno doubt whatever that the personality of the operator plays a very much greater part than Mr Carington seems ready to admit.\r\nThis influence is naturally most potent in a case like that of Rudi\r\nSchneider. I should be prepared to lay pretty substantial odds that\r\nappreciably different results would have been obtamed with Rudi\r\nand Olga if these personalities, instead of being confronted by myself, then the Society's Investigation Officer, before whom he stood\r\nin some awe, had been tested by someone with whom he felt more at\r\nease. Even my work with Mr Gatty, in which boredom was the\r\npredominant element with both subject and operator, notwithstanding our profound interest in what we were doing, I was conscious\r\nof a subtle difference in my attitudes to his two \" personalities \". These considerations may seem somewhat fine-drawn, but I think\r\nthat they are very important, and I do not see that they can be\r\nsegregated even by the elegant analysis of variance. There are other\r\nconsiderations, such as the varying technique used by different\r\noperators, a fact of importance for comparative purposes. Again,\r\nMr Carington has made allowance for fatigue on the part of the subject : but what about the operator's very real fatigue as he approaches the end of a double 100-word session ?\r\n1 hope, therefore, that Mr Carington will forgive me if I say that\r\nhe appears to have missed the point when he writes (p. 367) : \" Is it suggested . . . that if I had been present I would have recorded\r\ntimes, words or reproductions other than those actually given . . . ? \" The answer is obviously in the negative, but this is not surprising\r\nsince this Aunt Sally has been erected by Mr Carington's unaided\r\nefforts. The question should read : \" Is it suggested that if I had\r\nbeen the operator, times, words and reproductions would have been\r\ngiven to me to some extent different from those actually given to\r\noperator X, Y or Z ? \" To this question I have no hesitation in\r\nreturning an affirmative answer ; and if I am right in doing so, to\r\nwhat extent are Mr Carington's results affected ? It is a matter for\r\nexperimental 1 inquiry. u J , TYours, etc.,\r\nTheokore Besterman.\r\nOctober 1935 Correspondence 121\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014While more than impressed by the industry, skill and\r\nintellectual power displayed by Mr Whately Carington in his work\r\npublished in the last Proceedings, I venture to voice my suspicions\r\nthat there are contingent aspects of the subject which evade the\r\ngrasp of his all-but-intelligent stupendous mathematical machine,\r\nand hence, also, my regrets that he gave Mr Maby's criticism such\r\nshort shrift. For example, regarding the question of the possible effect of tele- pathy in vitiating the results. In reply to Mr Maby's remark in this\r\nconnection, Mr Carington asks, \" Who is supposed to have telepathed\r\nwhat to whom ? \"\r\nIt seems clearly possible that Mr Drayton Thomas, with his perfect\r\n(and well-founded) faith in the genuineness of \" J \" and \" E \", and\r\nknowledge of their lives, dispositions and characters, may have, so\r\nto put it, an intensifying effect upon their manifestations through\r\nMrs Leonard, and possibly more (say) in the case of \" E \" than of\r\n\" J \". Surely a series of word reactions should be obtained from\r\n\" J \" and \" E \" when Mr Thomas is not present before the suggestion\r\nof telepathy can be so confidently rejected. The same applies to\r\nMr Irving and \" D \". At the risk of being riddled by the volleys of intelligent critics\r\n(p. 340), I venture, fortified by birth and long residence in, and knowledge and love of the East, to support Mr Thomas' contention that\r\nFeda's replies have \" a strong Oriental flavour \". Putting myself\r\n(more Mr Gatty) in an Oriental \" atmosphere \", I considered Feda's\r\nreactions to the 74 words given (p. 374). I rejected 9 only, comprising\r\n15 different reactions. I accepted 96 reactions (80 different) to the\r\nremaining 65 words, these (96) comprising different reactions to the\r\nsame word and the same reaction to different words (e.g. ivild\u2014\r\nelephants ; dervish, jungle ; shoot\u2014elephants ; cook\u2014curry ; make\u2014\r\ncurry). Dress\u2014sari ; yelloiv\u2014robe [Buddhist priest] ; insult\u2014idol ; sleep\u2014mosquito ; bald\u2014priest [Buddhist again] ; cook\u2014curry ; boy\r\n[servant] ; hunger\u2014dog ; \u2014struck me as reactions which mere bookknowledge of India would not stimulate, and there are many others.\r\nIt would be interesting to know the views of other Anglo-Indians,\r\nand instructive if they vary in opinion ! At any rate this seems to\r\nbe an issue which the mathematical machine cannot handle, and\r\nbefore we dogmatise on the subject, we should ascertain whether\r\nMrs Leonard has a repressed Oriental complex.\r\nYours, etc.Ernest S. Thomas.\r\n122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1935\r\nExtra-Sensory Perception.\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nDear Madam,\u2014I was much interested in a remark by Mr G. N. M.\r\nTyrrell, in the April, 1935, Journal, to the effect that ...\" Miss\r\nJohnson had always had great difficulty in expressing any paranormal\r\nfeeling in words,\" because I myself have had this same experience,\r\nin a minor degree, on many occasions. For example, I have often\r\nhad what seemed to be momentary premonitory flashes of something\r\nabout to be done or said, and could have used the words about to\r\nbe uttered myself, but could not. Some faint but very definite power\r\nseemed always to prevent my speaking the words until too late ; then\r\nI realised that if I had uttered them, they would have been correct\r\n!\r\nLet me state emphatically that these experiences did not represent\r\nso-called \" pseudo-presentiments \", but genuine experiences, which\r\nwere carefully noted at the time. Is it possible that there is some\r\nsubtle influence at work here, connected with experiences relating\r\nto the future ? I merely propose the question without attempting\r\nto answer it. Yours, etc.,\r\nHereward Carrington.\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014With regard to the two major issues raised by Dr\r\nThouless in his letter to the Journal for July last, may it not be that\r\nthe frequency of the capacity for E.S.P. does not resolve itself into\r\ntwo rigidly distinct classes\u2014those who have it and those who have\r\nnot\u2014but rather that its manifestation is a function of the method\r\nemployed to detect it ? If the investigator is prepared to try long\r\nenough and carefully enough, he is surely more likely to get a result,\r\ngiven a moderately promising subject, than if he is content with a\r\ncasual test. But it is still true that there is a rough division between\r\npromising and unpromising subjects, and the proportions between\r\nthe two classes we do not know.\r\nWith regard to the ease of repetition of Dr Rhine's experiments, I cannot help feeling that Dr Thouless is drawing the rather natural,\r\nbut yet erroneous conclusion, that to obtain results in E.S.P. is a good deal easier than it really is. At any rate, as far as my own\r\nexperience may be allowed to count, the outstanding feature is the\r\nelusive and fluky nature of the faculty. The idea underlying the\r\nOctober 1935 Reviews 123\r\nmethod of collective experiment, that the matter can be settled by\r\nissuing something in the nature of an examination paper to all and\r\nsundry, seems to me to be based on too simple a view of the matter.\r\nOne needs to maintain personal contact with the subject and to\r\nstand by, ready to seize one's opportunity, very much as if taking\r\na photograph of a solar eclipse : and I fear that \" every sceptic \" who essays to verify the matter for himself will find that he has\r\nembarked on a considerable task.\r\nDr Dingwall's attitude is an interesting variation on the established method of experimental science. Instead of trying to find out\r\nfrom nature the conditions under which he is likely to get positive\r\nresults, he proposes to dictate to nature the conditions under which\r\nhe will accept them. \" Atmosphere \". and the many factors affecting\r\nthe internal balance of forces within the subject, are not to be al- lowed to have anything to do with the results, whatever nature's\r\nlaws on the subject may be. Only external conditions are to be\r\nallowed to count. Dr Dingwall is going to decide the circumstances\r\nunder which E.S.P. may occur\u2014an extension, I suppose, of the\r\nvogue for dictatorship into experimental science. But he is not\r\noriginal. King Canute tried the method a long time ago, with the\r\nonly result that he got his feet wet. And now we have the modern\r\n\" Canute Complex \" complacently laying down the law to nature : and we know what is going to happen. After stultifying its own\r\nexperiments, it will cry loudly that the object of them does not\r\nexist ! Yours, etc.,\r\nG. X. M. Tyrrell.\r\nREVIEWS\r\nA Bibliography of Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.

Their names and addresses are given above.\r\nThe Council filled the vacant place among their elected members,\r\ncaused by Professor F. C. S. Schiller's retirement, by appointing to\r\nit Mr W. Whately Carington, hitherto a co-opted member.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nPreliminary Experiments in Precognitive Guessing\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I venture to make a few comments on Mr Carington's most excellent paper on the precognition experiment ? One\r\ncannot fail to admire the delicacy of this instrument of analysis\r\nwhen wielded by hands so skilful as his, and one stands amazed at\r\nhis magnificent industry and patience.\r\nIt is of the first importance that he should have found unmistakable indications of an element of precognition in the \" anomalous\r\npacking \", but it seems to me that several very obscure questions\r\narise.\r\nIf there be an element of precognition it is quite clear that its\r\neffect is somehow or other masked or concealed in the totals, for\r\nthese come out exactly at chance expectation.\r\nMr Carington suggests that this masking of the effect in the totals\r\nNovember 1935 Correspondence 127\r\nis due to the operation of some sort of negative faculty. The exist- ence of such a faculty, i.e. one which produces results below chance,\r\nhas already been suggested by Rhine and Tyrrell. I find it. however,\r\nvery difficult to conceive.\r\nThe fundamental datum line, the '* tabula rasa \" on which everything is written, is a score of N.p successes and N (1 - p) failures.\r\nThis represents zero faculty\u2014even a robot would get this result. In\r\nMr Carington's experiment this is, of course, 20 successes in 120\r\ntrials ; in both Dr Rhine's and Mr Tyrrell's 20 successes in 100 trials. For the purposes of this argument I will take the latter figures. If\r\nthere be such a thing as paranormal faculty, whether of E.S.P. or\r\nprecognition, it is obviously one which does not give 100% success. Each subject seems to have a limit beyond which he cannot go.\r\nOne obvious explanation of this is that the faculty comes in waves\r\nor gushes and is then somehow inhibited.\r\nWhether this be the true explanation or not does not affect my\r\nargument ; the point is that, so far as has been experienced, no\r\nsubject has been able to obtain 100% success. We may therefore speak of a faculty as having say 20% efficiency.\r\nNow a 20% faculty acting on 100 trials in an experiment where\r\np = j would give, on the average, 36 successes, for, whether it is a matter of waves or gushes followed by periods of inhibition or whether the failure to secure 100% successes is due to some other\r\ncause, we may assume that, over a long jDeriod, the faculty is spread\r\nout evenly.\r\nAs I have said, the datum line is 20 successes in every 100 trials, so that in one-fifth of the trials the faculty will come across cases which would be successes anyhow. Now the only possible function\r\nof a positive faculty is to turn what would have been a failure into a\r\nsuccess ; it cannot affect what would have been a success whether it operated or not.\r\nIt has therefore left for its effective operation the 80 trials where\r\nchance would give failure : 20% of 80 = 16 ; thus the 16 successes due to the faulty plus the 20 due to chance make up 36. Now take\r\nthe case of a negative faculty, that is to say a faculty which produces\r\nresults significantly below chance.\r\nThe only possible function for such a faculty is to turn success into\r\nfailure ; if it operate on that which would anyhow be a failure its effect is nil. It therefore has only 20 trials whereon it can act\r\neffectively ; the remainder will be failures whether it operate or\r\nnot. 20% of 20 = 4, so a negative faculty of 20% efficiency would\r\ngive a score of 16 successes.\r\nIt is clear that such a result would be of no avail to mask the\r\n128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1935\r\neffect in the total of a positive faculty ; in order completely to do so the negative faculty must produce 16 failures\u2014that is to say. it must\r\nhave 80% efficiency. It is further clear that no negative faculty whatsoever could\r\ncompletely mask the effect in the totals of any positive faculty, the\r\nefficiency of which exceeds 25%\r\nNow I find it very difficult to believe that the negative faculty\r\nshould have an efficiency four times as great as that of the positive ; if it comes in waves, it is a very extraordinary wave which has a trough four times as deep as the crest is high.\r\nThe only other alternative which I can think of seems to me even\r\nless acceptable. We should have to assume that the subject is able\r\nsomehow to concentrate his faculty on those instances which by\r\nchance would be successes ; this involves, among other things, a knowledge of what is going to turn up, a precognitive knowledge, moreover, which must have 100% efficiency. Though I am inclined to\r\naccept the actuality of precognition, I cannot swallow this. It is indisputable that scores significantly below chance do occur,\r\nbut it seems to me that the hypothesis of a negative faculty is untenable.\r\nAt the present moment I am unable to suggest any alternative.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nDear Madam,\u2014Those of us who know the work of Mr Whately\r\nCarington know him to be a careful and sceptical investigator, so that he will sympathise with those who find his preliminary results on precognition (reported in this Journal, June 1935) very improbable\r\nand who prefer to explore other possible explanations than his\r\nsubjects' precognitive powers. It is certainly true that any significant failure of results to conform to chance expectation would be\r\nsound evidence for genuine precognition if all other possibilities were excluded. Nevertheless a precognitive power whose only effect\r\nis to reduce slightly the subjects' likelihood of guessing twice in\r\nsuccession is certainly working in a mysterious way which sharpens our suspicion that something is wrong.\r\nI propose to consider only the main body of the results and to\r\nexclude those of Mr X who showed a remarkable excess of right\r\nguesses over mean chance expectation. These experiments were\r\nnot properly witnessed and, therefore, cannot be allowed as evidence.\r\nThe author only admits them because he thinks the existence of\r\nparanormal precognitive power is established by the other cases.\r\nNovember 1935 Correspondence 129\r\nIf it is uot, it obviously cannot be established by Mr X\"s ease until\r\nthis subject shows the same results in properly witnessed exjjeriments.\r\nIt does not seem to me, however, that the other evidence put\r\nforward by Mr Whately Carington is sufficient to establish any\r\nparanormal precognitive power on the part of his subjects. It must\r\nbe admitted that if either the series of dice-numbers or the series of\r\nguesses is truly random, the effect could not be explained except by\r\nprecognition. If, on the other hand, both depart from randomness,\r\nspecial kinds of such departure could produce the result obtained.\r\nI do not think it will be doubted that the guessed series is unlikely\r\nto be random,\u2014indeed that it would be impossible for anyone so\r\nto overcome associative processes in his mind that he could call out a series of numbers which was even approximately a random\r\nseries. It seems to me to be equally unlikely that he could produce\r\none by tossing dice. The acts of picking up the die, shaking it, and\r\nturning it out are a series of muscular movements which will form\r\na habit-system likely to be repeated every time with little modification. A perfunctory tossing will produce a series of numbers far\r\nfrom random ; but the most careful shaking (such as I suppose was\r\nused in these experiments) will produce a non-random series whose\r\nnon-randomness may be perceptible only to careful statistical\r\nexamination. Such non-randomness may be shown by a greater\r\nor lesser tendency for a number to be followed by itself than would\r\nbe calculated from mean chance expectation. One cannot say\r\nbeforehand which would happen, perhaps either with different\r\nsubjects, depending on the particular habit system adopted in\r\nshaking the dice. Nor can we be sure how associative processes will\r\nmake the guessed series depart from randomness.\r\nLet us suppose that a particular subject who has guessed correctly\r\nwill tend not to repeat that guess next time, or that, whether\r\nsuccessful or not, he tends not to repeat the same guess twice in\r\nsuccession. Let us suppose also that he will be slightlv more likely\r\nthan m.c.e. to toss a second time the number previously obtained.\r\nThen a correct guess will make somewhat less likely a succeeding\r\ncorrect guess, i.e. the correct guesses will be \" loose-packed.\" This\r\nis what Whately Carington observed and what he has regarded as evidence for precognition. The above is, however, an alternative\r\nexplanation. Whether or not it is the true one could only be\r\ndiscovered by an examination of Whately Carington's raw data.\r\nThe same result would, of course, follow from the subject tending\r\nto repeat a successful guess while the chances of the toss are some- what against the same number turning up twice consecutively.\r\n130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1935\r\nI have myself tried making a succession of dice tosses to discover\r\nwhether I obtained a random series. The indication was that it was\r\nnot random, but I did not make a very extensive series, because it was obvious that the important point to determine was not whether\r\nI produced a random series of tosses but whether Mr Whately\r\nCarington's subjects did.\r\nIn order to test out the above suggestion, it would be necessary\r\nto know : (a) whether the series of tosses shows pairs of similar\r\nnumbers in succession significantly either more or less often than\r\nmean chance expectation ; (b) whether a successful guess was more\r\nor less often followed by the same guess than mean chance expectation in a random series, and (c) whether the above two departures\r\nfrom randomness, if they occurred, would produce the amount of\r\nloose-packing actually found in the results.\r\nOn the supposition that it is previous success which influences the\r\nsubject's subsequent guess, the reduction of loose-packing when the\r\nguesses are compared with the tosses removed one and two places\r\nfrom them is exactly what would be predicted. This, however,\r\ncould only happen if the subject knew when he had made a successful\r\nguess. This I presume to have been the case. On the other supposition, that there is merely a tendency for the subject to avoid\r\nor to prefer two consecutive guesses of the same number, the\r\nlooseness of packing would, so far as I can see, remain the same\r\nhowever the guessed and tossed series may be dislocated with respect\r\nto one another.\r\nI wish to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the subjects\r\nmay have tossed the dice in a perfunctory manner. I am suggesting\r\nthat, however careful was the shaking, complete randomness would\r\nonly be obtained if the die were shaken for an infinite time or by a being with an infinitely pliable nervous system who formed no\r\nhabits. With actual human subjects, shaking carefully and conscientiously, nothing but the records themselves can tell how big\r\nis the departure from randomness and whether it is enough to account\r\nfor the loose-packing of correct guesses. Until this point has been\r\ndetermined, Mr Carington's results cannot be regarded as evidence\r\nfor precognition since a significant departure from mean chance\r\nexpectation in closeness of packing might be due to another\r\ncause. Yours faithfully,\r\nRobert H. Thouless.\r\nNovember 1935 Correspondence LSI\r\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities.\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014Mr E. S. Thomas's letter in the October Journal (p. 121)\r\nreminded me that I too had been inspired by the \" strong oriental\r\nflavour \" of Feda's word-reactions to try a little private experiment.\r\nHis letter also persuaded me that it might not after all be entirely\r\nsuperfluous to report the result of that experiment.\r\nAbout a week after I had read Mr Drayton Thomas's article in\r\nProceedings, Part 141, I asked my wife to read me the list of 74\r\nwords printed on p. 374 (which I had not looked at in the interval)\r\nand to record my replies and reaction times. Half an hour later we\r\nhad a \" reproduction test \" ; and about two months later, when\r\nI had seen Mr E. S. Thomas's letter, we went through the whole list once more. Mean reaction time, first experiment 3-36 seconds,\r\nsecond experiment 3-73 seconds (Feda's mean reaction time is stated to be about 4-20 seconds). Here are some of my replies\r\n(stimulus words printed first, words repeated in reproduction test printed in italics) :\r\nMountain : Washington. Apalachian.\r\nMake : Whoopee.

Yet\r\nI am not an American ; have never visited America : have no\r\nintimate friends in that country ; and am quite discreditably\r\nignorant of its history, geography and customs. I approached the\r\nexperiment, however, with the firm intention of establishing my\r\npseudo-identity as an American citizen and a member of the Republican party. Considering that I lacked Feda's many years of\r\npractice in being a foreigner, I perhaps did not do so badly : at any\r\nrate I beat her on the speed-test. Comparing the two sets of replies,\r\nthe reader will iiotice (1) That, like Feda, I keep certain responses\r\nhandy and use them whenever possible, e.g. Angry-Roosevelt,\r\nWicked-Roosevelt, Justice-Roosevelt : cf. Feda's Make-Curry,\r\nCook-Curry, Hot-Curry, Eat-Curry (as though through those long\r\nyears in the Summer Land the poor child had been obsessed and\r\nperhaps tormented by the image of her favourite dish) ;\r\n(2) That, like Feda, I make in my haste a few mistakes : e.g. \" The Old Folks at Home \" is not an American song (false association via \" My Old Kentucky Home \"\r\n?), any more than \" Durbar \"\r\nis an Indian coin (false association via \" dollar \"\r\n?) ; (3) That I lug in my trite American references by the ears, just as Feda lugs in her trite Indian ones, \" John \"' his biblical allusions, \" Etta\r\n' : her painting. (Contrast Mrs Leonard, whose responses\r\nappeared, to the naive surprise of Mr Drayton Thomas, \" commonplace and non-identifying \". Even so would mine have appeared\r\nif, like her, I had been playing the game according to the rules\r\ninstead of trying to establish a false identity and grossly over- doing it.) I conclude (a) that responses whose reaction times average more\r\nthan about three seconds, 1 however \" reliable \" in Mr Carington's\r\nstatistical or Pickwickian sense, are, as Mr Maby has already hinted,\r\nopen to the suspicion of purposive and systematic faking ; (6) that\r\nthe results obtained with Feda are not distinguishable in quality\r\nfrom faked results.\r\nYours, etc., E. R. Dodds.\r\n1 This applies to all the Leonard personalities in the first Thomas experiment,\r\nand to \" John \" and \" Etta \" in the second ; see Proc, XLII, pp. 236, 238.\r\nNovember 1935 Reviews 133\r\nREVIEWS\r\nWalter Franklin Prince. A Tribute to his Memory. By Friends\r\nand Colleagues in Psychical Research. Boston Society\r\nfor Psychic Research, 1935.\r\nEvery serious psychical researcher will welcome the issue of this\r\nvolume as a tribute to the memory of one of the outstanding\r\npsychical researchers of our time, a man widely honoured both for\r\nhis penetrating intellectual gifts and for the nobility of his character.\r\nIt is appropriate that the Boston Society, whose destiny he in\r\nlarge measure controlled from its foundation and which owes preeminently to him the high position it holds among psychical research\r\nSocieties, should have undertaken the issue of this memorial volume.\r\nAmong his many gifts Prince, more than any psychical researcher\r\nof our time, succeeded in establishing happy personal relations with\r\nstudents of the same subject in his own country, in England, and\r\non the Continent of Europe. For many years he kept up an intimate\r\ncorrespondence with them, and in this small book tributes to his\r\nmemory are paid by many who had highly appreciated this interchange of letters, or who had in other ways met him as a colleague\r\nin their researches.\r\nIn addition to these personal appreciations Professor Gardner\r\nMurphy contributes a review of the Doris Fischer case, probably\r\nthe work for which Dr Prince will be longest remembered, and Dr\r\nWorcester a note on recent developments in the same case. The\r\nvolume concludes with a useful summary of the leading events in\r\nPrince's life, and a list of his published works compiled by Mrs\r\nAllison.\r\nThe highest praise one can give the volume is to describe it as not\r\nunworthy of the man to whose memory it is dedicated.\r\nThe Mystical Qabalah. Dion Fortune. London, Williams and\r\nNorgate. 1935. Pp. viii, 306 and 3 plates. Price 10s. 6d. net.\r\nIt is quite impossible in a short review to do justice to this arresting\r\ntreatise on a subject of a class which does not usually allure the\r\nBritish mind. Attention is soon beguiled by the attractive presentation which dispels the misgivings that may be at first aroused.\r\nThe following is a conspectus of some of its main principles.\r\nThe Qabalah is a Western development of the cosmic philosophy\r\nin which the great ancient faiths of the world were or are rooted.\r\nMan, it is proved by occult subconscious experience, is a pattern\r\nof the Universe in petto : a microcosm. The study of his nature,\r\npowers, energies, and qualities therefore throws light on the Macro-\r\n134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1935\r\ncosm. The Causative Force is more akin to Mind than to Matter : a conclusion to which Science is to-day gradually coming. The initiate\r\nthinks of the Natural Forces as Persons, and this personalisation has\r\nresulted in the building up of Thought Forms on the Astral Plane to\r\nrepresent them. Angelic beings for the Qabalist are Cosmic Forces.\r\nThus the deities of the ancient faiths became Realities for their\r\nworshippers (and still ' are ') \u2014being qualities, emotions, and forces\r\nsimilarly ' personified '. Through the ' cosmogenetic ' glyph called the Tree of Life the\r\naspirant can, by meditation, get (subconsciously) into touch with\r\nthe fundamental streams of cosmic energies ; the effect being an\r\naccess of energy to the soul and increased well-being. The adept\r\noccultist can canalise and use the powers (both good and bad) for\r\nthe benefit or hurt of humanity.\r\nThe Tree constitutes a Method of Thinking\u2014by feeding the Subconscious with symbols \" which have a peculiar logical basis deep in\r\nthe Subconscious mind \". These symbols are circles representing\r\nthe 10 Holy Sephiroth (spheres) of cosmic forces and energies\r\npersonified\u2014arranged on, and down, 3 pillars in a zigzag order of\r\ntheir successive emanation (each from the one preceding) from the\r\nPrimum Mobile to Malkuth (Earth). They are connected by Paths\r\nsymbolising their interactions. Vertically on the 3 pillars the\r\ndescent from 1 primal essence ' into matter is typified : on them the\r\nSephiroth have qualities and energies roughly typified by Force,\r\nForm, and Consciousness (the Central pillar) in descending grades : each with many collateral ' functions '. The Tree, being not a graph\r\nor map but a method of thought, is dynamic in its effects upon the\r\nsubconscious, which ' throws ' the symbolic concepts like shuttles,\r\nand the resultant web of ideas is presented to the conscious mind,\r\nwhich assimilates what it can, progressively, from this contact of the\r\nSubconscious with that revealed Reality (the World Soul). ' Magic '\r\nhas a rational basis in the realm of initiated subconscious operation.\r\nSuch is a bare outline of the central scheme. The whole system,\r\npace its Hebrew setting, is rational in its constitution, and sensible\r\nand sane in its application to life. The book is eminently readable ; the arrangement and handling of\r\nthe material masterly, the style simple, straightforward and re- strained. In spite of some deep sayings it is never ponderous or\r\nobscurantist. Analogies from psychology and physical science are employed with telling effect, and, surprising in a work of this kind,\r\nthe pages are further enlivened with flashes of vigorous humour.\r\nThe ' crede experto\r\n1 of a writer of this calibre can hardly be lightly\r\ndismissed. Ernest S. Thomas.\r\nNovember 1935 Reviews 135\r\nOkkultismus. Tduschungun und Tatsachen. By von F. Moser.\r\nOrell Fiissli Verlag, Zurich.\r\nFrau Moser's two enormous volumes undoubtedly constitute a very important and valuable contribution to the literature, already\r\nso abundant, bearing on our researches. There are 479 pages in the\r\nfirst volume and 483 in the second (index not included) ; both are profusely illustrated, chiefly though not exclusively with portraits\r\nof the leaders of the movement, and the erudition displayed by the\r\nauthor is positively bewildering. Frau Moser (a member of the\r\nS.P.R.) appears to have read almost everything dealing with\r\nPsychical Research and ''Metapsychics,\" at least in the languages\r\naccessible to her : and surely that is a good deal.\r\nThe very title of her book partly reveals its tendency : if there\r\nare in \" occultism \" delusions, there are also facts ; and Frau Moser\r\nindefatigably\u2014and on the whole very objectively, as it seems to me \u2014proceeds to separate the tares from the wheat.\r\nTo analyse adequately such a book in two pages of the Journal is manifestly impossible. Frau Moser will therefore, I hope, pardon\r\nme if I limit myself to a few remarks.\r\nIn Volume I. I find a chapter dealing with some of the classical\r\ninvestigations in the domain of Physical Spiritism : the London\r\nDialectical Society, Sir William Crookes' seances with D. D. Home\r\nand Florence Cook, Professor Zollner's experiments with Slade (with\r\nstriking reproductions of photographs from the Leipzig savant's\r\nWissenschaftliche Abhandhmgen) , Eusapia Paladino ; also Prof.\r\nLombroso and A. R. Wallace's investigations (these, I think, might\r\nhave been omitted). These old episodes are believed by the author\r\nto be genuine, not excluding the Katie King \" materialisations.\"\r\nWhatever may be thought of such a standpoint, the position of Frau\r\nMoser towards more recent researches in Physical Phenomena (\" Eva\r\nCarriere,\" Linda Gazzera, Stanislawa Tomczyk, Mirabelli, Jan\r\nGuzik, \" Margery,\" etc., etc.) seems rather illogical, for she is inclined to reject the genuineness of these latter \" phenomena \" en\r\nbloc, only making an apparent exception in favour of Willi and Rudi\r\nSchneider. That most of the investigations in question present most\r\nsuspicious features no sane critic will deny. But it will be more\r\nlogical to suppose, so at least it seems to me, that some of the older\r\nexperiments\u2014if not all\u2014were vitiated by sources of error then unsuspected, than to postulate such a difference \" in kind.\" In particular, the distinction drawn by the author between the Lichtmedien of the remote past and the more recent Dunkelmedien\r\nappears to me rather artificial\u2014with the possible exception of the\r\nSlade-Zollner experiments, where, supposing these to have been\r\n136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 193o\r\nnon-authentic, very exceptional circumstances favourable to fraud\r\nmay have operated (I do not say, did operate).\r\nFrau Moser's attitude towards the spirit hypothesis is on the\r\nwhole unfavourable, though one has the impression that she avoids\r\ncommitting herself, and though she might have drawn up against\r\nthat hypothesis a much more powerful indictment so far as experimental Spiritism is concerned. She admits, however, incidentally\r\nthat numerous researchers among the best have arrived at the conclusion that in some cases the spirit hypothesis is the only possible one. She adds that \" it is in any case the simplest '\" (p. 640). (Frau\r\nMoser does not add that from the simplicity of a hypothesis it does\r\nnot always follow that it must be the true one.) On the other hand,\r\nI miss in Okkultismus a chapter on Phantasms of the Dead and\r\nHaunted Houses, which might have furnished the author with spontaneous evidence for something like survival much more impressive\r\n\u2014to me at least\u2014than acres of records of mediumistic tranceutterances.\r\nThe chapters on telepathy and thought-transference, telsesthesia\r\n(clairvoyance), precognition, crystal-gazing, animal magnetism,\r\nhypnotism, \" hylomancy \" (psychometry), xenoglossy, Kriminalmedien, etc., are as full of incidents, observations and experiments\r\ngleaned in the literature of the subject as the chapters on Physical\r\nPhenomena. Frau Moser's conclusions are on the whole positive\r\nalmost throughout. I note that in dealing with the Kriminalmedien\r\nshe recommends extreme circumspection, whilst also admitting the\r\ngenuine character of some of the alleged facts. This circumspection\r\nis, I think, much to be commended, especially if we recollect the\r\nrecent fiasco of various rhabdomancers (posing then as \" radisesthesists \"') in the case of Nicole Marescot, a little girl apparently\r\nkidnapped a few months ago in France. I will not deny, however, that some of the evidence brought forward in the book\r\nunder this heading is impressive, especially the verdict of the\r\nLeitmeritz (Czechoslovakia) tribunal in the Hanussen case (p. 618,\r\netc.).\r\nA few more brief remarks before I have finished.\r\nFrau Moser will permit me to say that her book might have been\r\nconsiderably abridged without any damage to its contents. To give no other instance : the trio Home\u2014Slade\u2014Eusapia are marshalled\r\nbefore us twice (pp. 82-105 and 114-134, and 675-706). Once would\r\nhave been quite enough, one would think.\r\nThen, as a general rule at least, I would have omitted dreams as evidence of supernormal impressions. They almost always leave\r\nbehind them far too vague a recollection, and are besides so numer-\r\nNovember 1935 Reviews 137\r\nous that purely fortuitous coincidences become more unavoidable\r\nthan anywhere else. By the way, I am inclined to attribute to Chance pure and simple\r\nmore importance than the author does, and am convinced that it can afford us an adequate explanation of not a few exact state- ments made by mediums or mesmerised subjects. I am convinced\r\nthat much caution is here necessary, as several striking and obviously purely accidental coincidences in my own experience abundantly testify.\r\nFrau Moser does not think much of the S. J. Davey experiments : they had, she says, \" little in common with the best slate-writing\r\nperformances, and \" were not in the least like \" the best Slade\r\nseances as described by Barrett and Wedgwood (pp. 914, 915). I am not sure Frau Moser does full justice to these \" epoch-making \" Davey sittings, whose importance is fully proved, e.g. by some of\r\nA. K. Wallace's pronouncements, both public and private. Writing\r\nto me in answer to a letter of mine (in 1891. I think), he said, after\r\nenumerating some of Davey's particularly striking feats : \" I shall not believe this to have been conjuring by any vague\r\ngeneral statements, but shall require a precise description of how it was done.\"'\r\n(I am citing from memory, but remember this sentence with\r\npeculiar distinctness.)\r\nOn the other hand. I have never been inclined to press too far\r\nthe theory of mal-observation, seeing that in the last analysis almost\r\nall evidence depends on human testimony, and also because experiments devised so as to exclude mal-observation to-day may prove\r\nunsatisfactory from that point of view at some future time.\r\nOn page 227 (Volume I.) the author gives\u2014at second-hand\u2014an\r\naccount of Mgr. Valousek. a Czechoslovakia!! prelate and senator,\r\nwhich once more seems to go a long way towards proving that collective hallucinations (induced) are a real fact after all. I think\r\nthis account one of the most interesting and suggestive pieces of\r\nevidence Frau Moser's magnum opus contains, and I can only regret\r\nthat the testimony is not at first-hand.\r\nMagnum opus indeed ! The author is not infallible, but the book\r\nrepresents a splendid and to a considerable extent successful achievement worthy in many respects of admiration.\r\nWe heartily hope it may soon reach a second edition or be translated into English or French in a somewhat abridged form. In\r\nthat case, we shall expect a few inaccuracies and misspellings of no\r\ngreat importance to disappear.\r\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\r\n138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1935\r\nLa Veritd sullo Spiritismo.

Marshall Jones (Boston, Mass.).\r\n$2.00.\r\nMiss Tubby, who was Secretary of the American S.P.R. in its less controversial days, endeavours to help persons beginning the study\r\nof Psychical Research, with advice, based on her own long experience, both as to how they may best exercise any psychic faculties\r\nthey possess, and how they may best derive advantage from sittings\r\nwith persons whose powers are more fully developed.\r\nOne crux confronts every author who writes on Psychical Research\r\nfor beginners, viz. : how is the question of fraud to be dealt with ? One way is to confine the book to such phenomena (and there are plenty) as are practically free from fraud : if this course is followed\r\nthe question of fraud can be dealt with briefly, the main sources of\r\nerror, such as faulty recording, being non-fraudulent. This means\r\nleaving out a very large part of what is generally meant by Psychical\r\nResearch.\r\nAnother way is to state boldly that as regards many phenomena\r\nfraud is the dominant issue, and then to discuss in some detail what\r\ntypes of fraud are connected with what types of phenomena ; what\r\nconditions favour fraud, and what assist in prevention or detection.\r\nThe second wa}r is of course far preferable, if the size of the\r\nbook permits. In a small book the first is the only practicable\r\none.Miss Tubby is not oblivious of the issue of fraud (see pp. 79-80),\r\nbut her treatment of it is much too summary in view of the space\r\nshe devotes to several types of phenomena in which fraud has been\r\nnotoriously rampant. This defect is all the more curious as the book\r\nis dedicated to Richard Hodgson \" a great pioneer and discoverer\r\nin the larger world of the psychic \", and particularly a great pioneer\r\nin the prevention and detection of trickery.\r\nNovember 1935 Reviews 139\r\nBut if there are passages that would have made Hodgson stare\r\nand gasp, there are others which he would have warmly commended.\r\nIf all sitters with mediums giving \" communications \" were to\r\nobserve the rules stated and discussed in Chap.

His long and distinguished\r\ncareer thus coincided approximately with the life-time of our Society.\r\nAlike in geography and psychical research, the period witnessed a\r\ngreat extension of knowledge and improvement of technique, and\r\nif at the close of it the psychical researcher must regretfully admit\r\nthat in his subject there are large territories still incompletely\r\nmapped, he may derive some comfort from Mr Reeves's statement\r\nthat, notwithstanding the far greater antiquity of geographical\r\nstudy, the mapping of the earth's surface is not by any means complete.\r\nThe greater part of the book consists of an account of the progress\r\nof geography during the period in question, with reminiscences of\r\nthe famous men and women with whom Mr Reeves was brought in\r\ntouch through his work. The last chapter, however, entitled\r\n\" Psychic Experiences \"', will be of especial interest to our members.\r\nThroughout his life Mr Reeves has had psychic experiences of various\r\nkinds, including several instances when in a normal waking condition he has had visions of great vividness. In one case while\r\nliving in the country, on the afternoon of Boat Race day, after the\r\nRace had been decided, but before he had any normal knowledge\r\nof the result, he was able to describe correctly several incidents in the\r\nRace, including the winning of the toss. Moreover, in his own words.\r\n\" I suddenly saw, projected on the wall of the room, a clear picture\r\nof the race. There was Hammersmith Bridge crowded with people,\r\nand just before the two boats reached the bridge I could see them\r\nwith their crews pulling for dear life. Cambridge was half a length\r\nahead, and I felt sure they would continue to gain to the end. On\r\nthe Monday morning following, on the front page of one of the\r\npicture papers, was the view that I had seen.\" Mr Reeves, who has never been interested in boat races, attributes his experience to\r\n140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1935\r\n\" some sort of delayed telepathy \". In the other cases of visualisation quoted by him there was no verifiable correspondence with\r\nexternal events.\r\nMr Reeves also gives accounts of sittings with professional\r\nmediums, in consequence of which he has become a firm believer in\r\nspirit communication.\r\nW.

Professor Richet was President in 1905, and was for more than 40 years a corresponding\r\nmember.\r\nA fuller Memorial Notice will be printed later.\r\nPRIVATE MEETING\r\nThe 138th Private Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\r\n27 November 1935, at 5.30 p.m.. Admiral The Hon. A. C. Strutt in\r\nthe Chair.\r\nMr Theodore Besterman read a Paper on\r\n'' : The Mediumship of\r\nCarlos Mirabelli,\" which is printed below.\r\nI Mirabelli is a short, thick-set man said to have been born in 1889.\r\nbut looking older. Genial, temperamental, dynamic, unreliable, he\r\nis the embodiment of what English people understand by the Latin,\r\nand especially the South American type. His father. Luigi (Luiz),\r\nand his mother were both Italians, but the medium was born in\r\nBrazil. Rumour, even printed evidence, about his early history is as plentiful as it is unreliable : nor have I thought it worth while to\r\nE\r\n142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\ninvestigate it at all closely. It will be enough for my present purpose\r\nto say that after the war Mirabelli was employed as an assistant in a shoe shop in Sao Paulo. Mysterious happenings of a poltergeist\r\nkind took place and were thought to be due to his presence.\r\nSince that time Mirabelli has been more or less exclusively\r\noccupied as a medium. Though he is anxious not to be considered\r\nas a professional, in fact he is. Directly or indirectly Mirabelli demands and obtains (as I know only too well) substantial fees, far\r\nmore substantial, indeed, than any ever asked of me before when\r\nattending sittings on a medium's own premises. The procedure is this : Mirabelli founds or causes to be founded an institute, for\r\nwhich he works, on the premises of which he lives, and to which\r\nsitters make payment. It was in this way that the Academia de\r\nEstudos Psychicos \" Cesar Lombroso \" was founded at Sao Paulo\r\nin September 1919 ; and Mirabelli's move to Rio de Janeiro led to\r\nthe foundation there, in November 1933, of the Instituto Psiquico\r\nBrasileiro. It was in the house of this latter organisation that took\r\nplace the five formal and the various informal sittings I was privileged to attend with Mirabelli in August 1934. 1 The attention of European students of psychical research was\r\nfirst drawn to the mediumship of Mirabelli (apart from vague\r\nrumours) in 1926, by the publication of a pamphlet in Portuguese\r\nentitled 0 Medium, Mirabelli. This little book (a copy is in the\r\nSociety's Library) is described on the titlepage as the result of an\r\ninquiry conducted by the Academia de Estudos Psychicos \" Cesar\r\nLombroso \" ; and this statement naturally carried a certain amount\r\nof weight. We can now see, however, that even the limited import- ance attached to this phrase was a mistake, for it would be very\r\nlittle exaggeration to say that the Academia and Mirabelli are, or were, to all intents and purposes, one and indivisible. An interesting\r\nillustration of this was the presentation to me, on the conclusion of\r\nthe sittings, by Mirabelli, of the Sao Paulo Academia's diploma of\r\nmerit.\r\nThe chief reason, however, why this pamphlet made a considerable stir 2 was the very long list of reputable names printed in it as of persons who vouched for the phenomena recorded. From the\r\nfirst, however, it proved difficult to obtain information from Brazil as to the precise status of this list. Such information as was received,\r\n1 This was made possible very largely by a substantial grant from a recent anonymous donation made to the S.P.R., and by a generous donation from\r\nMiss May Walker.\r\n2 Sometimes a very exaggerated one, as when Mr E. J. Dingwall described\r\nthe Mirabelli case as of \" enormous importance \" {Journ. A.S.P.R. [1930],\r\nxxiv. 302).\r\nDecember 1935 Private Meeting 143\r\nby Dr Osty among others, gave rise to misgivings. And now, after\r\nmy visit to Brazil, I have no hesitation in saying that the list is almost valueless. Far from being a list of investigators testifying\r\nto the reality of the phenomena they had observed, it really partakes\r\nfar more of the nature of a visitors' list. Most of them had no idea\r\nof the use that was being made of their names. The names of a number of persons who really did accept the\r\nphenomena undoubtedly remain ; but I hope it will not seem discourteous if I say that their testimony is of relatively little value.\r\nThese gentlemen have in most cases had no experience with mediums\r\nother than Mirabelli, and they have no notion of the conditions under\r\nwhich psychical research should be conducted. Their testimony, in\r\nshort, has such value as can be given to evidence put forward by\r\ninexperienced and more or less casual visitors, concerning events over which they have no control. 1 These considerations certainly deprive the pamphlet 0 Medium\r\nMirabelli of most of its interest, for the actual descriptions contained\r\nin it of the phenomena observed are almost as inadequate as the\r\nphenomena themselves are startling ; while the illustrations are highly unconvincing set pieces. Nevertheless, the claims made for\r\nMirabelli were so extensive and the testimony, at first sight, so over- whelming, that, as I have said, considerable interest was aroused.\r\nEfforts were made from the first to induce Mirabelli to come to\r\nEurope, efforts which were renewed time and again, but always\r\nwithout success. This failure was due to the impossible terms and\r\nconditions laid down by the medium, which, had they been accepted,\r\nwould have made the resulting sittings the merest formalities.\r\nReports, however, continued to reach Europe from time to time,\r\nand a few years ago Professor Driesch had the opportunity of attending some demonstrations given by Mirabelli. Professor Driesch was\r\nnot unimpressed by what he saw, but he made it clear that the conditions were such as to make a reasoned judgment impossible. (The\r\nname of Professor Driesch promptly appeared, in 0 Medium Mirabelli Mystifica ?, among those testifying to the reality of Mirabelli's\r\nphenomena.) More recently Miss May Walker had some sittings\r\nwith Mirabelli, which she kindly reported to me at length. Her\r\nconclusion was, in brief, that some of Mirabelli's phenomena were\r\n1 In my notes I find the following first impression : \" [Mirabelli is] so accustomed to a reverential audience, that his procedure\r\nis crude in the extreme. If his phenomena are fraudulent it is inconceivable\r\nthat expert observation over a few sittings should fail to reveal the technique.\"\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that no suspicion is felt of Mirabelli in Brazil. He has been in trouble with the police on account of his activities, and\r\nseveral sitters, to my own knowledge, have felt, and feel, considerable doubts.\r\n144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\nsuspect, but that others seemed to be genuine. All these circumstances made me anxious to have sittings with this medium, and in\r\n1934, as already mentioned, this was made possible, as part of an\r\nintended more general tour of America, which I was unable to complete owing to ill-health.\r\nII The sittings in which I took part were held in the evening, and\r\nthey usually extended into the night. I made brief notes, as opportunity offered, during the sittings, and very full notes immediately on returning to my hotel or early the following (or rather, the same)\r\nmorning. On the conclusion of each sitting an official record of the\r\nproceedings was made by those present, the essential parts being\r\ndictated by Mirabelli himself. Copies of these records, in the original\r\nPortuguese, are preserved in the Kooms of the Society ; and I venture to suggest that a comparison of these records with my own\r\nnotes will throw some light on the contents of such Mirabellian\r\nproducts as 0 Medium, Mirabelli, Mantendo a Verdade, 0 Medium\r\nMirabelli Mystifica ?, Miguel Karl's Martyrios e Acrisolamento do\r\nMedium Mirabelli, Dr Carlos Pereiro da Castro's 0 Espiritismo\r\nscientifico, Dr Thadeu Medeiros's As Faculdades Metergicas do Professor Mirabelli, which are all in the Society's Library.\r\nI do not propose to give a minute account of the whole of the\r\ntransactions at the sittings I attended ; it will be seen from what\r\nfollows that this would be wearisome and uninstructive. All I propose to do is to give a general idea of what occurred, enlarging on\r\nonly one or two of the phenomena.\r\nFirst of all, a word about the conditions under which the sittings were held. These varied considerably. The illumination ranged\r\nfrom darkness to the brilliant light of seven or eight small naked\r\nelectric lamps at the ceiling ; the degree of light is sufficiently indicated during the description of each phenomenon. Those present\r\nalways included officials of the institute, and usually Mme Mirabelli ; the rest were invariably adherents of or sympathisers with the\r\nmedium ; the sitters ranged in number from one or two present at\r\nspecific phenomena, to a group of some twenty, seated like an\r\naudience. The conduct of the proceedings was exclusively in Mirabelli's hands : and it was made clear to me from the beginning that\r\nI was to be merely a spectator. No sort of control was at any time\r\nexercised, suggested or asked for by any sitter other than myself,\r\nand then without success. In general, the phenomena were of the following types :\r\n(1) The largest group consisted of the supposedly paranormal\r\nDecember 1935 Private Meeting 145\r\nappearance of objects, usually small. These were undoubtedly all faked. Mirabelli merely distracted the attention of the sitters,\r\nusually by announcing that he saw an apparition floating near the\r\nceiling, after which he took things out of his pocket and threw them\r\nabout the room. It was very quickly possible to judge from the\r\nincreasing excitement of Mirabelli's manner (always considerable)\r\nand from the increasingly persistent way in which he compelled the\r\nsitters to look in the direction in which he pointed, that an apport\r\nwas in preparation. And on several such occasions, by discreetly\r\nglancing in the wrong direction (for this takes place in full light),\r\nI had the privilege of seeing that rare phenomenon, the beginning of\r\nthe flight of the object\u2014though it is true that on these occasions the\r\npropulsive force was provided by Mirabelli's hand.\r\nTo explain the ease with which such crude fraud is perpetrated it\r\nis as well to repeat the fact that there is never anything remotely\r\napproaching to a control of the medium. It is also well to realise\r\nthat the sittings are held literally in the rooms of the Academy.\r\nThose present are only metaphorically sitters, for most of the time\r\nthe medium is moving, even running, through a series of rooms opening into each other, with the sitters after him like the tail of a comet.\r\nThe following quotation from my notes illustrates an even cruder\r\ntype of apport. \" All through the evening Mirabelli had seen [an\r\napparition] floating about carrying a bunch of flowers. Repeated\r\nattempts had failed to materialise these, until [an] Italian oration\r\n[which Mirabelli was to deliver]. As he was about to start on this\r\nMme Mirabelli vanished from the room and all the doors were carefully closed. Mirabelli spoke throughout in a very loud voice, in\r\nfact he shouted. When he had finished he took two or three of us\r\nto a distant room at the end of a passage, and there, in darkness,\r\nthere fell three separate flowers ; finally Mirabelli turned round in\r\necstasy and saw [the apparition] putting the flowers on the chandelier, which was of course invisible in the darkness. Thereupon he\r\nrushed to the switch, and lo and behold the chandelier was wreathed\r\nwith flowers. The amazement and delight of the sitters are indescribable ; but surely it is simpler to assume that Mme Mirabelli had\r\narranged the flowers there during the oration ? Certainly nothing\r\ncould have been easier and safer , though evidence is obviously lacking.\r\nThis note does not make it clear that we entered the room in darkness.\r\n(2) A not very interesting phenomenon, several times repeated, was the following : several bottles of \" magnetised \" water were\r\nplaced on a table ; at a little distance away, ranging from a couple\r\nof feet to about five yards, the medium and a few sitters were seated\r\nin a semi-circle of chairs ; the lights were turned off as soon as we\r\n146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\nentered the room ; and, after we had taken our places, one bottle\r\ncould be heard clicking against another, the tempo being varied to\r\norder. I cannot say definitely that I know how this was done, but\r\nI strongly suspect a black thread. I do not think that Mirabelli\r\nattaches a thread to the bottle which moves, but that a double\r\nthread is looped round it. If this is done it is only necessary to let go of one end of the thread, which can then be recovered and secreted.\r\nMoreover, the proceedings usually terminated by Mirabelli praying\r\n(literally, for the sittings are conducted in a very pietistic atmosphere) for a specially loud tinkle. This prayer is usually granted\r\nand the bottle falls over ; the reader will draw his own conclusion.\r\n(3) A kindred phenomenon was the paranormal tearing of paper.\r\nThis is described as follows in my notes. \" With me alone [Mirabelli] went into yet another room, where nothing happened. He\r\ntook up a sheet of thin paper, packing-paper size, and returned with\r\nit to the room in which the small group was assembled. This room\r\nwas light enough for features to be distinguished at five or six yards.\r\nHe then tore the sheet about two or three inches down, made me hold\r\nit up at arm's length, and ask [the apparition] to tear it in two.\r\nAfter several minutes, during which Mirabelli repeatedly touched\r\nthe paper, I felt a slight tug, the paper moved, but the pull then\r\nrelaxed with a sort of jerk. After a further interval, there was\r\nanother and stronger tug, and the paper was torn across at an angle.\r\nI was then made to hold a ruler across the palm of my hand, and this was eventually pulled out of it. Later a pair of spectacles was made\r\nto move on a table. This was practically all that happened, and\r\nI feel pretty sure that these phenomena were done by meaus of\r\nthreads, though, notwithstanding every effort, I was quite unable to\r\ncatch sight of one. However, the following points are to be borne\r\nin mind : ( 1\r\n) the movements are always produced towards Mirabelli\r\n;\r\n(2) they always occur at a moment when Mirabelli is in movement,\r\nthough once or twice only his head was moving (I wonder what an\r\nexamination of his beard would reveal ?) ; (3) immediately after\r\neach phenomenon of this kind, Mirabelli makes violent gestures of\r\njoy and throws himself on and embraces the object concerned. Also\r\nI took possession of the torn paper and find on it marks which, without being in any sense conclusive, support the hypothesis of a thread\r\npinned to the paper. The ruler I was unable to examine closely ; but I did find similar punctures all at one end, though nothing that\r\nwould not be found on most rulers, I suppose.\"'\r\n(4) There only remain, in the department of the paraphysical\r\nphenomena, two types, which I will now proceed to describe some- what more fully. The first is thus reported in my notes : \" The\r\nDecember 1935 Private Meeting 147\r\naudience was seated with Mirabelli facing them. He then delivered a little lecture (a thing he is liable to do, with considerable oratorical\r\nforce, on the slightest provocation) on the difference between conjuring and genuine dematerialisation, etc. He proceeded to illus- trate this by showing a few elementary coin-vanishing tricks, using a special coin of an obsolete kind, dated 1869, to which he drew our\r\nattention. Then he showed [what he claimed to be] some genuinely\r\nmediumistic phenomena. He went into another room accompanied\r\nby [one of the sitters], there, we were told, held the coin in his open\r\npalm, with the sitter's open palm over it. The coin then vanished,\r\nMirabelli returned to the room in which we were sitting, and asked\r\nme where I wanted the coin re-materialised. I elected for my own\r\npocket and in a moment or two Mirabelli announced that the coin\r\nhad been precipitated into my breast-pocket ; there I duly found it. This performance was repeated with each of the male sitters present,\r\nwith success, except that on one occasion I ventured correctly to\r\nforecast to my neighbour where the coin would be found. It must\r\nbe noted that at no time during the progress of this phenomenon did\r\nMirabelli approach within three yards of the main body of sitters. The way this trick was done was simple in the extreme. At a\r\ngiven moment, before the lecture, Mirabelli asked the male sitters one by one into an adjoining room, where he examined them \" magnetically \", making passes over them, etc. While doing so he slipped a coin into the pocket of each \" patient \". The vanishing of the coin\r\nis of course elementary palming, and the rest is obvious. All that is required is unlimited impudence and a sufficient number of similar\r\ncoins. What first aroused my suspicion was this : when asked to\r\nexamine the 1869 coin I did examine it and made a mental note of\r\nits characteristics. When I found the coin in my breast-pocket I immediately saw, from minute characteristic marks, that it was not the\r\nsame one, and the rest was then obvious. Again, every coin was found\r\nin an outside breast-pocket except X's, who had his materialised into\r\nhis hip pocket, and X had been the only \" patient \" who had been\r\nasked to take his jacket off, as I happened by chance to notice. What\r\nsurprises me in this trick is the odd mixture of very soundly thoughtout impudence (the medium admitting to and exhibiting conjuring\r\nskill), ingenious technique (I forgot to mention that when the\r\n\" patients \" returned to the circle they had to join the chain, thus\r\npreventing premature accidental discovery of the coins), and crude\r\nperformance (hiding a coin on every \" patient \"). There is no doubt\r\nthat with a little more care this trick could be developed into a really\r\nstartling performance ; no doubt in more sophisticated circles Mirabelli's genius would receive the necessary impulse.\"\r\n148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\n(5) I have left till last the second of the two phenomena referred\r\nto above, and the only really impressive part of the Mirabelli\r\nsittings. To avoid any unconscious misrepresentation, I again quote\r\nfrom my contemporary notes : \"To demonstrate the existence of\r\nhuman magnetic currents and the direction of their flow, Mirabelli\r\nproduced a bottle with a perfectly bona-fide screw cap, on which he\r\nbalanced an absolutely straightforward blackboard measuring\r\nroughly about 2 ft. x 3 ft. (exact measurements later). The blackboard was slightly distorted, as if from heat. Several sitters then\r\nstood round holding their hands over the edges of the blackboard : Mirabelli did likewise, and in a minute or two the board began to\r\nrevolve, performing about one and a half revolutions before it heeled over and fell. The same thing happened with a small swagger cane,\r\nweighted at each end with a metal ring. I can guarantee that no\r\nthreads were used in either case. It remains to be seen by trial\r\nwhether this can be done by slight blowing or the like.\" All this\r\ntook place in brilliant light. I may add that, under the same conditions, I found that blowing cannot do the trick. The measure- ments of the blackboard I afterwards found to be : 69-9 cm. x 80-3 cm. x 1 cm., weight 3-65 kgm. The round cane is 60-2 cm. long,\r\ntapering from diameter 16-5 mm. at one end to diameter 11 mm. at\r\nthe other ; it weighs just on 70 gr. Of a later sitting I wrote : \" Then followed a repetition of the\r\nblackboard rotation phenomenon, which was done exactly as before,\r\nexcept that this time the board was supported on the bare mouth of an empty bottle. The actual performance was more striking, as the\r\nboard performed, I think, three complete rotations before falling off. The light, though not so brilliant as last time, was very good, but\r\nnot quite good enough for the film I took to come out, I suspect. I am still puzzled by this phenomenon ; taking into account the good\r\nlight, the fact that Mirabelli performs the phenomenon completely\r\nsurrounded by standing \" sitters \", who seem to have complete liberty\r\nof movement, and the fact that he expressed no objection whatever\r\nto the filming, although I strongly emphasised the fact that the camera and the film were very special ones and would show every\r\ndetail, the fact that Mirabelli allowed me on each occasion to arrange\r\nthe mise en scene and did not precipitate himself on the board as it\r\nfell, the fact that the room, the table, and the bottle were all different,\r\nthough the board was the same, all these circumstances make the\r\nhypothesis of threads practically impossible, while any other\r\nfraudulent method is difficult to conceive.\"\r\nMajor Eampling Rose had very kindly loaned me an excellent\r\nSiemens cinematographic camera, with which I had hoped to obtain\r\nDecember 1935 Private Meeting 149\r\na film of the medium at work. Unfortunately the light, visually\r\nbrilliant as it was during the blackboard phenomenon, was insufficient for cinematographic work, and the film shows no more than a vague blur of movement. I have described this phenomenon as\r\ncandidly as may be, and I can only add that it still puzzles me. It\r\nis the only phenomenon of the many I saw during the Mirabelli\r\nsittings which presents a prima facie case, in so far as one is entitled\r\nto say this of a single phenomenon that appears inexplicable in a mediumship the other manifestations of which seem clearly fraudulent. Waiving such philosophical points, I could certainly wish to\r\nhave the performance repeated under conditions making cinematographv possible.\r\nIll\r\nMirabelli's mediumship is not, however, by any means restricted\r\nto paraphysical phenomena. Indeed, far more time is taken up at\r\nhis sittings by the writings produced by his hand in numerous\r\nlanguages and on many subjects, writings which purport to emanate\r\nfrom the spirits of deceased persons, most of them eminent. A\r\ncollection of these writings was published in Sao Paulo in 1929, under\r\nthe title of Mensagens do Alem obtidas e controladas pela Academia\r\nde Estudios Psychicos \" Cesar Lombroso \" atravez do celebre Medium\r\nMirabelli. This book enables us to estimate the value of these\r\npolyglot productions. I also had the privilege, during my sittings,\r\nof witnessing the production of several of such spirit communications.\r\nWe may consider first the languages in which these communications are written. The text of the book under examination contains\r\nscripts written in English, Hebrew, Greek, French, and German, in\r\naddition to Mirabelli's native Portuguese and his parents' native\r\nItalian. This is merely the order in which the languages mentioned\r\nfirst appear in the book. The amount of material in each language\r\nvaries considerably. The bulk of the scripts is in Portuguese ; apart\r\nfrom this only in French are there any long passages, totalling about\r\nthirty-five pages. There is a total of about one and a half pages in\r\nGerman, including one fairly long script. The other languages occur\r\nin small fragments only, totalling a page and a half of English, twothirds of a page of Italian, a dozen fines of what may pass for\r\nHebrew, and five words of Greek. Except in fragmentary facsimiles\r\nof Oriental scripts, we are given no examples of any of the other numerous languages in which Mirabelli is stated to have written\r\n(pp. 9-10), such as Dutch, Czech, Spanish, Polish, Latin, etc. Indeed, Mensagens do Alem and my own experience suggest that\r\n150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\nMirabelli writes freely only in Portuguese and in stilted French.\r\nHere is a specimen of the latter taken from a script executed in my\r\npresence on 14 August 1934. It purports to emanate from a Professor Pozzi, though it is not clear why he communicated in French,\r\nand is reproduced verbatim et literatimirom the original holograph now\r\nin the possession of the Society. This document begins as follows : \" Bonsoir.\u2014II y a deja bien de temps que je ne retourne plus,\r\npour vous dire combien je vous cheris, et combien j'apprecie le develloppement que vous donnez constamment a la tres saiute\r\nscience de Kardec, la revelation du salut du monde.\r\n\" Le Christ en nous annoncant la future venue de l'Esprit de la\r\nverite, savait bien ce qu'il disait, et connaissait, bien la signification\r\nque ses paroles avaient : son regard, en voyant dans l'avenir, etait\r\nplus profond que celui des astronomes qui veulent deceler les mysteres du ciel avec leur lorgnettes de fer et de verre ! \"\r\nThis is a decidedly favourable specimen of the French in which\r\nthe scripts are written. Sometimes, however, the supposed communicating spirit rounds off a message with a few words in his own or\r\nin some other language. Thus, Cromwell, after three pages of Portuguese, adds a dozen lines in English, beginning : \" Till now I did\r\nwrite in Portuguese, that's for me a foreign language, but presently\r\nI must show you I have not forgotten my dear mother country and\r\nmy loved english tongue, that I spook [how apt ! Th. B] in my\r\nyouth \"\r\n(p. 102). Newton signs himself : \" Newton The man of the\r\napple He who has ears ... he who has eyes ... as you know\r\nfrom the holy books \"\r\n(p. 88). And Lombroso concludes a message\r\nin French with a few lines in English, German, Italian, and Portuguese, in which he challenges the \" Herren Doktors \" (note the form\r\nof the plural) to explain the medium's command of languages. The\r\nEnglish lines read : \" I hope this proof will be more than to make\r\nyou believing, oh ! men ! you that always be in doubt. Jesus clear\r\nand help you ever and for ever. Good by the same [that is, Lombroso] \"\r\n(p. 159). The scraps in foreign languages are often quotations, though not acknowledged as such. An example is Newton's\r\nuse of Ben Jonson's \"It is not growing like a tree in bulk ; doth\r\nmake Man better be ! \"\r\n(p. 86). It is noticeable that the language\r\nof such quotations, as in the instance just given, is much more\r\naccurate than that of \" original \" material.\r\nIt would be idle to discuss, for it would be begging the question,\r\nwhy foreign spirits should communicate in good Portuguese when\r\nthey \" get across \" then own languages so badly. \" William\r\nCrooks \", at the end of a long communication in Portuguese, explains the matter in the following words : \" Anybody, amongst you,\r\nDecember 1935 Private Meeting 151\r\nschall certainly be surprised at hearing me in a tongue that during\r\nall my life were foreign to me, but you must undoubtedly know, thai\r\n[sic] we, abiding in the kingdom of the spirit, must have faculties\r\nthat, till now, have been unknown by all the men on earth : if I were\r\nin Prussia, I should speak german. ... I pray now, that the best\r\nand purest ghosts may defend you and learn you to partake of their\r\nelsarness [sic]. Good bye \"\r\n(pp. 39-40). This is no doubt plausible ; but would Crookes forget how to spell his own name ? Without entering more closely into such theoretical points, it is obvious enough that this kind of thing hardly justifies a claim that\r\nthe medium \" writes \" in many languages, and it is equally obvious\r\nthat, linguistically, such scripts as these do not demonstrate anything paranormal, even if we could rely on the texts printed being\r\nuncorrected, which we cannot, since no facsimiles are given of any\r\nof the scripts reproduced in the book.\r\nThis need not, however, be an insuperable difficulty for the spirithypothesis if the content of the scripts prove to be significant. The\r\nBrazilian supporters of Mirabelli consider these communications to\r\nbe of great value, and receive them with a good deal of awe. The\r\njustice of this view must necessarily remain a matter of opinion.\r\nI can only give it as my considered judgment that the scripts are very largely quite uncharacteristic, in an evidential sense, of their\r\nsupposed authors, that they contain no evidence of paranormal\r\nknowledge, and that the moral instruction which forms the bulk of\r\nthem consists of the tritest and most stereotyped sentiments, inspired largely by Allan Kardec and by popular notions of Indian\r\nphilosophy. There is certainly nothing in them beyond the reach\r\nof a man of Mirabelli's linguistic background and comparatively\r\ngood education.\r\nA few points remain to be considered in regard to these alleged\r\nspirit communications. The first is Mirabelli's alleged ignorance of\r\nall languages but Portuguese. I am satisfied that this claim, often\r\nrepeated to me by Mirabelli and his friends, is untrue. In regard to\r\nItalian it is naturally suspect, in view of the medium's Italian\r\nparentage. Moreover, the medium several times delivered in my\r\nhearing long harangues partly in Portuguese and partly in Italian.\r\nThe Portuguese passages were supposed to emanate from the\r\nmedium, while those in Italian were alleged to be uttered under the\r\ninspiration of his father. As, however, the transitions from one\r\nlanguage to the other were frequent, as the sentiments expressed were uniform and continuous, and as the medium's behaviour did\r\nnot change in the slightest visible degree, it is not easy to accept this\r\nproposition.\r\n152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\nIn regard to French and English., I have grave doubts as to Mirabelli's complete ignorance. My knowledge of Portuguese, as a spoken language, being scanty, my numerous conversations with\r\nMirabelli were conducted, on my side, in French, a little German and\r\na little English. I could not help noticing that the medium usually\r\nknew what I was talking about, especially during the course of the\r\nsomewhat delicate financial negotiations. Further, in regard to\r\nEnglish, at least, there is the additional evidence of a farewell\r\nmessage very kindly written, and presented to me, by Mirabelli.\r\nThe language of this is, if anything, superior to that of the English\r\nscripts. Here is a specimen passage, which I reproduce with all modesty : \" We want you to be messenger of the wonders you have gathered\r\nfrom this faculty without rival. Tell our brother of London the\r\nProfessor [Mirabelli] greatly desire to go to London to demonstrate\r\nexperimentally and scientifically, the admirable phenomens wich\r\nyou have observed during your visit here.\r\nWe are proud of having had the opportunity of being with a\r\nSpiritualist and progressive character such as our adoptive brother.\r\nFor that very reason the Academy Cesar Lombroso of Sao Paulo\r\nconfers upon you the diploma of which you are so deserving.\"\r\nIt cannot be pretended that these sentences, even allowing for the\r\nobviously borrowed phrases, testify to a complete ignorance of\r\nEnglish.\r\nAnother point is this : it is claimed on behalf of the medium that\r\nthe rapidity with which these communications are written is in itself evidence of their paranormality. It is also claimed that the medium,\r\nwhile writing in one language, will carry on a conversation in\r\nanother. Both these claims were made, with what I judged was\r\ncustomary enthusiasm, on behalf of the principal script produced for\r\nmy benefit, Pozzi's French communication from which I have quoted.\r\nThis document extends to under 1800 words, and was written, by mywatch, in 53 minutes, that is, at the rate of 34 words a minute. Even\r\nEdgar Wallace or Alexandre Dumas pere would undoubtedly have\r\nfound it difficult regularly to compose original matter at this rate in a language not his own. The words in italics are, however, all-important.\r\nWhat cannot be done regularly can often be done in an occasional\r\nspurt. And there is a vast difference between original matter and an\r\nincandite concatenation of sentiments of the most hackneyed description, easily paralleled in scores of spiritualistic writings of the\r\nContinental school.\r\nApart from these sufficient considerations, it must be remembered\r\nthat Mirabelli has written such messages by the hundred. He had\r\nDecember 1935 Private Meeting 153\r\ncomplete freedom, for the theme was not given to him. Moreover\r\nhe may have written this identical message on half a dozen previous\r\noccasions, since his audience is always changing and a very small\r\nproportion of his writings finds its way into print. In short , I should\r\nhesitate to say that this performance was even difficult ; and to say\r\nthat it requires a paranormal hypothesis is preposterous.\r\nAs for the medium's simultaneous conversation, this was very\r\nreminiscent of the \" talking in foreign languages \" found with\r\nmediums of the Valiantine type. The talking consisted, in this case, of occasional exclamations and murmurs, no more.\r\nSuch, then, is the far-famed mediumship of Carlos Mirabelli (whose\r\nreal Christian name, by the way, is Carmene). There are two possibilities : he is either a fraud pure and simple, or else he possesses a\r\ncertain narrowly-defined paranormal faculty, roimd which he has\r\nerected, for commercial purposes, an elaborate structure of fraud.\r\nThe sittings I attended were held under conditions over which I was\r\nnot allowed any control, so that I cannot pretend to decide for one\r\nor other of these alternatives. I can only repeat, with the reservations already made, that there appears to be a prima facie case for\r\nthe second possibility.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014No one will dispute Professor Dodds' claim, hi his\r\nstriking experiment, that he has impregnated his replies with a strong\r\nAmerican flavour, or deprecate his admission that he has overdone\r\nit : even a film fan would admit that ! Professor Dodds has only produced another Gatty experiment,\r\nbut in an atmosphere \" which has not been vecu. When he assumes that Feda is at the same game, and confidently instances\r\n\" curry \" to bear him out, his choice of example is hardly apt ! This reaction for the words he quotes is as natural to an Indian as\r\n\" bread \" for \" make \", \" break \", \" eat \", \" earn \", to a Briton.\r\nThe length of Feda's reaction-times is certainly open to suspicion,\r\nbut as this, we learn, is characteristic of all the Leonard personalities\r\ntested it may be due to some physical or psychophysical factor\r\nanalogous to deafness, slowness of perception, or other defect in the\r\n\"' entranced \" apparatus. Expert opinion (i.e. from Indians and\r\nAnglo-Indians) on Feda's credentials will be interesting if not\r\nvaluable. Yours, etc.,\r\nErnest S. Thomas.\r\n154 J'ournal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014According to his letter in the November Journal (p. 131)\r\nProfessor Dodds concludes that \" the results obtained with Feda are not distinguishable in quality from faked results,\" and his argument\r\nis that he has produced results of equal quality, and in shorter\r\naverage time, by impersonating a foreigner.\r\nI grant the possibility of producing tolerably passable results by\r\nimpersonating various types of people. While conducting the\r\nLeonard word reaction experiments I tested this for myself and\r\nachieved fair success ; but it tends to lengthen reaction time. The\r\nProfessor's argument is based on this question of time ; he thinks\r\nthat Feda's mean reaction time of 4-20 seconds is suspiciously long\r\nwhen compared with his own achievement of 3-36 seconds. Is he\r\nnot failing to allow for the asserted modus operandi of trance control ? Let him go through the list of stimulus words again, whispering his\r\nreplies to another person, who shall then voice them for him. The\r\nmean reaction time, as taken from the replies voiced by that second\r\nperson, will be considerably longer than when the Professor spoke\r\nthe reactions himself.\r\nFeda's explanation of her speaking has always been that her\r\nthoughts have to be passed to the medium and spoken by means of\r\nthe latter\"s organism. The mean time for Feda's word reactions is consistent with this statement. It would indeed have been sur- prising had Feda been as quick in completing this double process as was Professor Dodds with the single process of voicing his own\r\nreplies. q Drayton Thomas.\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014It is always a pleasure to be criticised by so courtly an\r\nexponent of the art of controversy as Mr Besterman, and few menare better qualified to speak on the points he raises. It is accordingly\r\nwith a considerable fear of appearing merely intransigeant that\r\nI venture to express the view that he has done little more than point\r\nout that \" If things had been otherwise, they would almost certainly\r\nhave been different \"\u2014a proposition which I should be the last to\r\ndispute. In particular, I agree that a less formidable operator than\r\nMr Besterman in his official capacity might well have caused less disturbance on the \" suspicion words \" in the case of Rudi and Olga\r\nthan that actually observed ; but I would certainly not agree that\r\nany change of operator would be likely to alter their strong similarity.\r\nIf ever opportunity permits, the study of the influence of the\r\noperator should certainly be undertaken, but in general I think that\r\nDecember 1935 Correspondence 155\r\nthe effects of his fatigue, etc., to which Mr Besterman alludes, are\r\neither removed by correction or subsumed under error in the manner\r\nindicated in Q.S.T.P., ii, 26, and my reply to Mr Maby's Note,\r\nsection 4. But at present I see no reason for supposing that the main outcome of the work to date would be in any appreciable degree affected\r\nby the factors in question.\r\nMr E. S. Thomas still leaves me in doubt as to who is supposed to\r\nhave telepathed what to whom ; but I cordially agree that a set of\r\n\" J \" and \" E \" reactions taken by someone other than Mr Drayton\r\nThomas would be of the utmost interest\u2014if it were practicable to\r\nobtain them, which I doubt. On the other hand, I fear I remain\r\nunimpressed by Feda's oriental reactions and attach a good deal\r\nmore weight to Professor Dodds' pleasant little experiment reported\r\nin the Journal for November.\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nWhately Garington.\r\nPreliminary Experiments in Precognitive Guessing\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadame,\u2014J'ai lu avec grand interet l'article de M. Garington sur\r\nle precognition (neologisme excellent\u2014preferable au mot de premonition). J\"ai vu aussi les observations de M. Saltmarsh et de M.\r\nThouless (Nov. 1935).\r\nPuis-je rappeler a vos lecteurs qu'avant M. Garington, dans mon\r\nlivre (VAvenir et la premonition) j'ai presente des experiences que je\r\nconsidere comme tres importantes (p. 165). Experiences que j'ai\r\ndirigees et qui ont ete faites par Armand Durex et sa sceur Brigitte.\r\nC'est la premiere fois, je crois, qu'on etudiait mathematiquement\r\nla connaissance de l'Avenir donnee par un medium. 87 petits\r\npapiers minuscules sont replies sur eux-memes, de maniere a former une petite boulette. Brigitte devait prendre un de ces papiers\r\nminuscules et, avant qu'elle ait tire, Armand indiquait le numero\r\nqu'elle allait tirer\u2014de sorte qu'il ne peut pas etre question de\r\ntelepathie. Sur 17 experiences Armand a dit le chiffre exact 6 fois. La probability etant de 1\/37\u2014nous sommes bien au-dessus du\r\nchiffre probable.\r\nDans une seconde serie, sur 17 experiences, il y a eu 2 succes. Ce\r\nqui donne, finalement, avec une P. de 1\/37 = 8, succes sur 32 experiences. Assurement, ceci represente une probabilite composee de : 1\/300,000 environ. Le hasard peut donner cela\u2014mais cela est peu\r\nvraisemblable.\r\n156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1935\r\nOn ne faisait qu'une experience par jour.\r\nInutile d'ajouter que ce n'etaient ni Armand, ni Brigitte qui\r\necrivaient les papiers. C'etait une tierce personne, tantot moi\r\ntantot Robert, le mari de Brigitte.\r\nJ'aurais bien voulu qu'Armand put continuer les recherches ; mais (chose bien curieuse !) il ne croit pas a sa lucidite\u2014et ces experiences l'ennuient beaucoup.\r\nJe n'en ai, du reste, publie qu'une partie et je pense, prochainement, les publier, avec plus de details, dans la Revue Metapsychique.\r\nLa seule objection qu'on puisse faire a ces experiences, c'est que\r\nc'est la lucidite de Brigitte, et non celle d'Armand, qui est en jeu.\r\nAlors, quand Armand a dit un numero, Brigitte, par sa lucidite,\r\ndevine, dans la corbeille ou il y a 37 papiers, quel est le papier cor- respondant au numero dit par Armand. De sorte qu'il ne s'agirait\r\npas de la precognition d'Armand, mais de la lucidite de Brigitte.\r\nCharles Richet. 1\r\nMediumistic Intelligences\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014In the Journal for October Mr Hume-Rothery points\r\nto one of several reasons which make it difficult for many of us to\r\nregard mediumistic intelligences\u2014Mrs Willett's and other\u2014as independent personalities : the contrast between the free flow of\r\nimverifiable matter, however abstruse and technical, and the strain\r\nand stumbling when it is evidential. There is also, in Mrs Willett's\r\ncase, as it seems to me, a special difficulty : the exceptionally high\r\nproportion of private matter in her scripts, although the communicators represent themselves as men who were either officers of the\r\nS.P.R. or closely in touch with its work. It can hardly be supposed,\r\nI think, that Myers and Gurney, at least, would not know that\r\nveridical detail, to be of value, should be of a kind that can be\r\npublished. Indeed, they were probably tantalized, in their time,\r\nby just such disabilities in this respect as now handicap Lord\r\nBalfour.\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nHubert Wales.\r\nERRATUM.\u2014Page 135, line 1, for \"By von F.

Dispersion, (a) I may have been unwise to treat Set No. 9\r\n(Table II) as \" fresh \". Actually, it was \" Mr X's \" second (witnessed) set, but it was done at a considerable interval after the first and under different conditions. These facts seemed to justify its being considered \" fresh \" for the purpose concerned, but as more\r\nconservative results are obtained by transferring it to the other\r\ncategory, it will be prudent to do so.\r\n(b) On the other hand it is evidently more reasonable to credit\r\nsubject No. 24 with 6 successes in the accidentally omitted column\r\nthan with 5. (Cf. p. 92, \u00a7 6.)\r\n(c) The perplexingly low dispersion shown by RN 23 was mainly\r\ndue to a misunderstanding by myself of how these cases should be\r\ncomputed.\r\n(d) The only reason for excluding my own first set from the Fresh\r\nand Experimenter set results under A, B, and C in Table III was\r\nfor the sake of comparison with those under D, which leads to\r\nnothing of interest.\r\nAmending accordingly we obtain the following values as the best\r\navailable estimates of the dispersion in the cases given, using\r\nMethod C throughout. The other cases are of no great importance\r\nand have not been re-computed.\r\nJanuary 1936 Precognitive Guessing 159\r\nP\r\nAll Sets \u202212 12 as before 25 Fresh Sets 023 191\r\n13 Other Sets \u202233* 23-\r\n1\r\n23 Experimenter Sets 32 27 1 15 Other Sets \u202212 311\r\n* In inverse sense ; i.e. low dispersion.\r\nWe conclude that there is distinct evidence (odds of 40 to 1) that\r\nthe dispersion is unduly high for fresh sets.\r\n2. Singletons, (a) Professor Fisher has kindly pointed out that\r\nmy treatment of these is invalid, because, although the formula for\r\nthe expected number appears to be correct (subject to erratum,\r\np. 112, July), we do not know the distribution about this expected\r\nvalue and consequently cannot determine the significance of any\r\ndeviation from it. The important results 43, 44, and 45, and others\r\ndependent on the treatment concerned, must accordingly be set aside until we know what this distribution is.\r\n(b) It is, however, possible to apply a much less sensitive test, not\r\ndepending on a knowledge of the distribution, to the point at issue.\r\nSacrificing most of the quantitative element, we may confine ourselves to enquiring whether D, the difference between the expected\r\nand observed numbers of singletons, is greater\u2014regardless of sign\u2014\r\nfor normal than for plus-one or plus-two successes. The expectation,\r\nof course, is that it will be greater no oftener than it is less. Writing D0 , D1; D2\r\n, for normal, plus-one and plus-two respectively, we find for the 57 groups : D0 >D1 , 34 times in 57; x\r\n2 2-123; P 073 73 1 D0 >D2 , 35 \u201e 57; x\r\n2 2-965; P -043 73-2\r\nCorresponding figures for other groupings are : For 38 Sets : D0 > Dls 20 times in 38 ; D0 >D2 , 22 \u201e 38;\r\nFor 25 Fresh Sets : D0 > D15 16 times in 25 ; D0 >D2 , 15 \u201e \u201e 25;\r\nFor 13 Other Sets : D0 > Dx , 4 times in 13 ; D0 >D2 , 7 \u201e \u201e 13;\r\nFor 23 Experimenter Sets\r\nD\u201e> Dj, 15 times in 23 ; D0 >D2\r\n. 18 \u201e \u201e 23;\r\nX\r\n2 -053 ; P -41 741\r\nX\r\n2 -947 ; P -165 74-2\r\nX\r\n2 1-960 ; P 08 75 1 X\r\n2 1 000; P -16 75-2\r\nX\" 1-923; P -92 76 1 X\r\n2 -077 ; P -39 76-2\r\nX\r\n2 2 130; P 073 77 1 X\r\n2 7-348 ; P -003 77-2\r\n160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1936\r\nFor 15 Other Sets : D0 >D!, 5 times in 15; x\r\n2 1-667; P -10 78-1 D0 > D2, 4 \u201e \u201e 15 ; x\r\n2 3-267 ; P -035 78-2\r\nMost of this is inconclusive, but there is certainly a suggestion that\r\nsingletons for \" aimed \" (normal) guesses deviate from their expected\r\nvalues more than do those for '' unaimed \" guesses as represented\r\nby the plus-one and plus-two material; in particular RN 77-2 is significant as it stands.\r\nThe tendency is most strongly marked in experimenter as compared with non-experimenter sets, in which, of course, if chance\r\nalone were at work, we should expect J) 0 >D1 and D0 <Dj, etc., to\r\nappear with frequencies proportionate to the number of sets. Actually we have : D0 >DX D0 <D1 Total L>0 >L\\, D0 <D2 Total\r\nExperimenter Sets - 15 8 23 18 5 23\r\nNon-Experimenter Sets 5 10 15 4 11 15\r\nTotal - - 20 18 38 22 16 38\r\n3-702 9-914\r\nP -026 (79-1) -0015 (79-2)\r\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is something distinctly aberrant about the singletons for normal guesses, especially\r\nin experimenter sets, and that plus-one guesses share this to some\r\nextent.\r\n(c) This view is strongly confirmed by the marked association of\r\n\" loose packed \" sets (excess of singletons) with specially high or\r\nlow scoring (successes) in the case of normal guesses, which does not\r\nobtain for plus-ones or plus-twos.\r\nTable VI is arranged to show the highest and lowest scoring sets in contiguity, and whether they are Loose or Close packed.

If we retain this feature, but\r\nrearrange the sets on the same lines as Table VI but in accordance\r\nwith their plus-one or plus-two success scores, instead of normal\r\nscores, we obtain on working the same calculations for the new EQ\r\nversus IQ : For plus-ones x\r\n2 '041, P 42 (81-2) ; for plus-twos x\r\n2 -225*, P -32\r\n(81-3) ; the values for normals necessarily remaining the same.\r\nRetaining this last arrangement, but marking L or C in accordance\r\nwith excess or deficit of normal singletons, we find : For plus-ones x\r\n2 \"675, P -21(82-2) : for plus-twos x\r\n2 '765*, P -19\r\n<82-3).\r\n* In inverse sense : association is reversed.\r\n162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1936\r\nRN 80-1 is highly significant, while none of the others are anywhere near it ; but in all cases plus-ones are intermediate between\r\nnormal and plus-twos. (N.B.\u2014All three ways of working the plustwo data show an inverse association ; but S(x2\r\n) is only 1-123 with\r\nthree degrees of freedom, which is quite insignificant, P being\r\nabout 4).\r\nThere is, however, a possibility, not yet fully explored, that the\r\neffect observed may be due to the skewness of the singleton distri- bution, this skewness itself depending on the score. RN 80-1 must\r\naccordingly be accepted with some reserve.\r\n3. Grouping Generally. I am deeply indebted to Mr W. L.\r\nStevens, of the Galton Laboratory, for giving me an exact method\r\nof treating groups. He has shown that in an aggregate of guesses\r\ncontaining a successes and b failures the expected number of groups\r\nof successes (of all sizes, not singletons only) is given by\r\na(b+l) _ a{a-l)(b+l)b. j\u2014 with variance j\u2014 ;\u2014\r\n\r\na-vb (a +b) 2 (a +6- 1)\r\nApplying these formulae to the 431 sheets which make up my\r\n38 sets and 19 fragments, seriatim, we find\r\nFor 431 sheets from all sources S(y2\r\n) 445-716 ; P -24 83\r\nFor 382 \u201e \u201e 38 sets S(x\r\n2\r\n) 389-093 ; P -30 84\r\nFor 49 \u201e \u201e 19 fragments S(x\r\n2\r\n) 56-623 ;. P -18 85\r\nThe analogue of my RN 43 is obtained by finding x\r\n2 for each set or fragment from the difference between its expected and observed\r\ngroup-totals, and the total variance, and summing these. We\r\nobtain : S(X2\r\n) 83-620 ; P -02 v.n 86\r\nMost of the effect, however, is due to the fragments, which give\r\nS(x2\r\n) 38-481 ; P -01 87\r\nwhile for the 38 sets we have only\r\nS(x2\r\n) 45-139: P -40 88\r\nIt is clear that either singletons are very much more erratic than\r\ngroups generally, or that the method I first used grossly exaggerated\r\nthe effect : or both. There is some evidence in favour of the first supposition, and the second is not improbable, though we cannot\r\ntell until the variance for singletons has been found. On the\r\npresent evidence, we can only say that there is a very strong suggestion to the effect that the grouping is actually anomalous in the\r\nJanuary 1936 Precognitive Guessing 163\r\nsame sense as previously reported. In most other contexts we\r\nshould regard it as clearly demonstrated.\r\n4. Grouping and Scoring. More significant and interesting results\r\nbegin to emerge as soon as we consider the connection between\r\ngrouping and scoring.\r\n(a) To start with, the deviations from the expected numbers of\r\ngroups for the 200 sheets of the high-scoring sets (Cf. Table VI) are\r\nsignificantly less than those for low-scoring sets.\r\nS(x2 )high is 163-847 with 200 DF\r\nand S(r)LOw is 225-246 \u201e 182 DF.\r\nProceeding as on p. 98 of my first paper, we obtain\r\nn\/2^72 -n\/2X2\r\n2 )\/n\/2 = 2-8605 ; P -005 89\r\n(6) We may also consider the distribution of Loose and Close\r\npacked sets, or sheets, among EQ and IQ scorers, on the basis of\r\ngroups, just as we did in 2 (c) above for singletons. We again find a significant association between loose packing and EQ scoring, in\r\nthe case of normal guesses, which does not occur for plus-one or\r\nplus-twos ; and plus-one results are intermediate between normal\r\nand plus-two as before. The figures are : BY SETS BY SHEETS\r\nX' P RN X\r\n2 \\> RN\r\nNormal - 6-128 \u2022017 90-1 4-304 \u202204 911\r\nPlus 1\r\n- - 1080 \u202230 90-2 3113 \u202208 91-2\r\nPlus 2 - - -915 \u202234 90-3 \u2022045 83 91-3\r\nIt should be noted that while these results agree with those\r\nobtained from the singletons, the latter are distinctly stronger ; this\r\ntends to support the suggestion made in \u00a7 3 above that singletons are more aberrant than groups, i.e. that there is some \" virtue \" about a singleton success as such.\r\n(N.B.\u2014The same caveat as to the possible effect of the skewness\r\nof the singleton distribution should be entered here as in 2 (c) above.\r\nIn neither case, however, would this appear competent to account\r\nfor the order in which normal, plus-one and plus-two results arrange\r\nthemselves.)\r\nI find it very difficult to suppose that these significant and con- cordant results are all due to chance alone ; and I cannot think of, nor has any critic suggested, any systematic abnormality of calling or throwing that could give rise to them.\r\n5. Effect of Preference. On general grounds we should expect\r\nthat, if there is any kind of psychological connection between the\r\n164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1936\r\nguess and the throw at which it is \" aimed \", the degree of preference\r\nshown for the different numbers 1 to 6 (or \" values \" as I .shall call them here) would have some influence on the number of successes obtained with each. That is to say, one would expect preferred\r\nvalues to score, on the whole, more (or possibly less) than their fair\r\nshare of successes. It is, of course, obvious that the more often a value is called (or thrown) the higher will be its score, if other factors are equal ; but this is allowed for in the following treatment :\r\n(i) In a sheet of 120 guesses, the normal number of calls for any\r\nvalue will be 20 ; so that all values called more often than this are\r\npreferred values.\r\n(ii) It is easy to show that any given value may be expected to\r\nscore GTM\/S(GT) successes in a sheet, where G is the number of\r\ntimes it is called, T the number of times it is thrown, and M the total\r\nnumber of successes for the sheet. This enables us to calculate the\r\nexpected number, E, of successes for each value.\r\n(iii) For each sheet, I correlate G-20 with 0 - E, where 0 is the\r\nobserved number of successes for the value concerned, up to the\r\npoint (A) of determining whether the preferred values between them\r\nscore more than their total expectation or less ; or (B) of determining the sign of the algebraic sum of the products (G - 20) (0 - E),\r\ni.e. whether the correlation is positive or negative. I have not con- cerned myself with the actual value of the correlation coefficient,\r\nand the tests used are accordingly of a somewhat \" diluted \" nature\r\nand likely to yield feebler indications than a more fully quantitative\r\ntreatment might do.\r\nPlan A may be said to take account only of the fact of preference,\r\nwhile plan B is concerned also with its degree.\r\nExample (Sheet V, 2) : Value G T GxT <> E O-E G-20 Products\r\n1 6 13 78 1 \u202293 \u202207 -14 \u202298 2 L3 21 273 4 3-25 \u202275 - 7 - 5-25\r\n3 IS 22 396 5 4-71 29 - 2 \u202258 4 42 25 1050 11 12-50 - 1-50 22 - 3300\r\n5 2:5 21 483 7 5-75 1-25 3 3-75\r\n6 18 18 324 3 3-86 - -86 - 2 1-72 Total - 120 120 2604 31 31 00 0-00 0 - 34-34\r\nIt will be seen (A) that the preferred values 4 and 5 score between\r\nthem 18 successes as compared with 18-25 expected and that (B)\r\nthe algebraic sum of the products is - 34-34 ; so that the sheet is reckoned as negative on either plan.\r\nJanuary 1936 Precognitive Guessing 165\r\nPerforming this calculation for each of the 382 sheets of the\r\n38 sets, we obtain : METHOD A\r\nPositive Sheets - 199\r\nNegative Sheets - 183 x\r\n* -670\r\nP -21\r\nMETHOD B\r\n210\r\n172\r\n3-780\r\n\u2022025 v.n. .92. 1 and 2\r\nThere is clearly a fairly strong general tendency for preferred\r\nvalues to obtain more than their fair share of successes, and this is more marked, as we would expect, when the degree as well as the\r\nbare fact of preference is taken into account.\r\nIf we now tabulate our results in the manner of Table VI, that\r\nis to say by sets and according to the set scores, and count the\r\npositive and negative sheets occurring in the four \" quadrants\r\nfind a very curious state of affairs. We have we\r\nMETHOD A METHOD B\r\n+ ve - ve + ve - ve For E - Q High Scorers - 31-5 48-5 32 48\r\n\u201e I ~ Q 5? 99 - 66 54 tilt 51 \u201e E - Q Low ,,\r\n- 47 35 49 33 \u201e I ~ Q 99 99\r\n- 54-5 45-5 60 40\r\n199 183 210 172\r\nIt is clear that specially high scorers form a strong exception to\r\nthe general rule just mentioned. Comparing E.Q.H.S. with the\r\nothers we have, for Method A :\r\nE.Q.H.S.\r\nOthers -\r\nTotal\r\nWhence x\r\n2\r\nand for Method B :\r\nE.Q.H.S.\r\nOthers -\r\nTotal\r\nWhence x\r\n2\r\nPositive\r\n31-5 167-5\r\n199\r\n6-560 ;\r\nPositive\r\n32\r\n178\r\n210\r\n9166 ;\r\nNegative\r\n48-5\r\n134-5\r\n183\r\nP 01 ....\r\nTotal\r\n80\r\n302\r\n382\r\n.93\r\nNegative\r\n48\r\n124\r\n172\r\nP -0013 .\r\nTotal\r\n80\r\n302\r\n382\r\n.94\r\nI should have expected success of preference to have been asso- ciated with scoring in the opposite sense, but the figures seem\r\ncoercive.\r\n166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1936\r\n6. Discussion. Apart from criticism of real value, such as that of\r\nProfessor Fisher mentioned above, there appears to be (judging\r\nfrom my correspondence) a certain tendency to cavil at the fact\r\nthat many of my results indicate the operation of non-chance\r\nfactors. This takes one of two lines : A. The data do not show the existence of a strong and\/or widespread faculty of precognition or\r\nL foretelling the future \"\r\n; it would\r\nbe contrary to common experience, and quite incredible, if they did ; therefore my results are mere artifactual wish-spawn.\r\nB. There k\r\n' must \" be \" some sort of correlation between guesses\r\nand throws \" ; otherwise nothing but chance results could be\r\nobtained.\r\nI do not know which of these I like best, for each reminds me that\r\nthe circle is the perfect figure\u2014in Logic as elsewhere ; but the\r\nfollowing remarks seem relevant.\r\nGeneral considerations of the. kind commonly known as philosophical make it appear not wholly improbable, to my mind at\r\nleast, that consciousness may have some kind of a forward extension\r\nin time, and thus some kind of \" contact with futurity \". On the\r\nother hand, the continued prosperity of Casinos and thimble-riggers\r\nmakes it clear that \" straight \" precognition of the type of event\r\nhere considered is at best extremely rare. Further, a life in which\r\nstraight precognition were the rule would, I think, be quite impracticable\u2014not to say insupportable.\r\nConsequently, if anything of the nature of \" prewareness \" (to\r\ncoin a word) exists at all. it seems much more reasonable to suppose\r\nthat it would be found in the highly garbled and perverted guise\r\nsuggested by my results than in the straightforward, but incredible,\r\nform which critics of type A simultaneously demand and repudiate.\r\nIf I had obtained strong evidence of straight precognitive faculty,\r\nI should have found it very difficult to accept ; but the curious indications I have actually obtained seem to fit very well with the\r\nsupposition that future events are not so completely insulated from\r\ncontemporary consciousness as classical theory would maintain, but\r\nthat something in the nature of an intricate protective mechanism,\r\nor censorship, is interposed to prevent our minds being over-rim by\r\nimpressions which would only confuse us. As regards \" criticism \" of the second type, I fear I must insist\r\nthat nothing of the kind is even worth discussing unless it is reason- ably specific. By this I mean that it is up to the critic to show how\r\nsome prescribed tendency in guessing or throwing, or both, could\r\nactually produce some at least of the effects observed. As soon as\r\nJanuaey 1936 Correspondence 167\r\nthis is done we can examine the data to see whether such a tendency\r\nactually exists and whether it does in fact produce the effects concerned. But vague contentions based on \" must \" are futile. On the other hand, it is clear that the mathematics of the subject\r\nare much more intricate than an amateur like myself might suppose,\r\nso that it is especially necessary to be on guard against inadvertently\r\ngenerating artifacts by inappropriate technique.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nPreliminary Experiments in Precognitive Guessing\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014In the Journal for November Mr Saltmarsh flatters me\r\nunduly, for it seems very possible, as pointed out in my Note in the\r\nOctober issue, that the effects he discusses may have been due to an\r\ninsufficiently skilful handling by myself of the technique employed.\r\nIt would accordingly be premature to discuss in detail the highly\r\ningenious argument he puts forward : but, speaking for myself, I think I should prefer his second alternative to his first\u2014supposing\r\nthat further work shows that one or the other must be invoked. If\r\nwe are going to swallow the camel of precognition at all, it seems to\r\nme likely to prove a mere straining at gnats to object to the view\r\nthat some stratum of the subconscious is 100 per cent, precognitive\r\n\r\nor substantially so with respect to the events considered\u2014and that\r\nthe effects observed may be produced by the action of a somewhat\r\nerratic censor between this layer and the conscious. But I do not\r\nfeel called upon to cross this bridge just yet.\r\nSimilar reservations perforce apply to any attempt to answer\r\nProfessor Thouless' welcome comments : but here I am on firmer\r\nground in one respect at least, in that\u2014with the utmost deference\r\n\r\nI do not believe one little word of his muscular habit-system story ! This seems to me just the kind of thing which, translated into terms\r\nof roulette croupiers at Monte Carlo, has led to innumerable suicides,\r\nforgeries, embezzlements, bankruptcies, elopements and kindred\r\ndisasters\u2014for it is just sufficiently plausible to be dangerous.\r\nUnquestionably one forms habit-systems of shaking and throwing so\r\nfar as the major movements are concerned, but their minor variations are legion and the combinations of these innumerable : and\r\nit is here, I think, that the basis of randomness is to be found.\r\nI should be sorry to attempt to define true randomness or \" pure\r\nchance \" with precision ; but I do not think we shall be far out if\r\n168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1936\r\nwe take it as that state of affairs in which the possible number of\r\ncombinations of independent result-affecting variations of the causes concerned is large compared with the number of possible results\u2014or something very like this ; and, if some such criterion be adopted, I think it will be clear that it is satisfied by any normal process of\r\nshaking and throwing a die, however stereotyped its main outlines\r\nmay be. Variations of the precise angle at which the die. is picked\r\nup, of the amount of spin given in dropping it into the shaker, of\r\nthe exact force and direction of the shake, of the angle at which it\r\nis ejected, of the height of the shaker at this moment, and of a host of other factors, all contribute to produce substantially perfect\r\nrandomness. This, indeed, is presumably the reason for dice having\r\nbeen used for so many centuries as a basis of games of chance, while\r\nI have yet to hear of anyone making a living by cultivating a habitsystem of throwing.\r\nHowever, the matter is best settled by an appeal to facts, and so soon as I am free from the pressure of further work, I shall be\r\ninterested to investigate at least an extensive sample of my raw\r\nmaterial to determine whether there are any signs of Professor\r\nThouless' hypothesis being true. For the moment I can only thank\r\nhim for putting forward a constructive suggestion susceptible of test\r\nin welcome contrast to objections based on \" must \" and lacking\r\nany account of how they are supposed to work.\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nWhately Carington.\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of Ike Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014As Mr Saltmarsh suggests, there is no evidence whatever that precognition has 100% efficiency : it is, however, a tenable hypothesis that some region of the subliminal has a complete\r\nrelationship with future event, though this relationship is not\r\nbrought to what we should call a cognitive level. It would be at\r\nthe obscure level which Professor Broad's presidential address has\r\ndone a good deal to define, if not to illuminate. And I should limit\r\nthis hypothesis of an obscure but complete relationship with future\r\nevent to \" prewareness \" of maximum probabilities, since the idea\r\nof a rigid future contains a contradiction of known psychological\r\ndata\u2014I say nothing of the metaphysical difficulties. Mr Carington's experiments, however, deal only with events of\r\nmaximum probability ; and I suggest that in guesses at these events\r\nit may not be at all a question of some \" prewarenesses\r\n' ; being\r\nJaxuaey 1936 Correspondence 169\r\n\" right \" and others \" wrong.'' This is what we can say of the\r\nguesses when they emerge as items of cognition, true or false, chancedetermined or otherwise. My own impression is that correct \" pre- wareness \" exists, at its own subcognitive level, over a very large\r\nfield : and that its results tend to emerge in highly distorted forms\r\nbecause our minds contain strongly organised protective resistances\r\nagainst seeing the future, in our present stage of evolution. (We\r\nare not yet very good at seeing the present.)\r\nOn this basis, I think. 100% precognition\u2014of a kind\u2014can be\r\naccepted as a working hypothesis, so as to remove Mr Saltmarsh's\r\ndifficulty, and leave some explanation possible, on Mr Carington s\r\nlines, for his undoubtedly significant discovery of \" anomalous\r\npacking \" with its implication that some touch exists between the\r\nmind and future event.\r\nYours, etc.. Kexneth Richmond.\r\nThe Mediumship of Mirabelli\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014The rejiort of Mr Besterman on Mirabelli printed in the\r\nJournal for Dec. 1935 is so remarkable a document that I should\r\nlike to make a few comments upon it. Five years ago I drew the attention of English-speaking inquirers\r\nto this case and emphasized its enormous importance to psychical\r\nresearchers. Since then a number of persons from Europe have\r\nvisited South America and, as far as we can judge from printed\r\nreports, have done little or nothing to clear up the puzzle. Indeed,\r\nfrom Mr Bestermams paper it would seem that he does not understand what the problem is. Had he been given definite and precise\r\ninstructions what to find out in Brazil he might have had something\r\nof value instead of bringing back stories of silly tricks. In spite of\r\nthese, however, Mr Besterman has come to a surprising conclusion.\r\nHe thinks that there is a primafacie case that Mirabelli may possess some paranormal \" faculty, and this is based on the fact he was\r\nunable to detect the modus operandi of a revolving blackboard effect . Apart from the fact that there was no reason why he should have\r\nbeen able to understand it, are we expected to believe with the late\r\nAlfred Bussel \"Wallace and Hewat McKenzie and now Mr Besterman\r\nthat because these gentlemen could not and camiot discover how\r\ncertain conjuring tricks are done there is a prima, facie case for the\r\n170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Januaey 1936\r\nsuccessful performers possessing \" paranormal \" faculties 1 It is this that makes psychical research ridiculous, and rightly so. In my account of Mirabelli, which was printed in 1930 by the\r\nA.S.P.R., I described certain phenomena and named the parties who\r\nwere said to have been present. Among these were Dr G. de Souza,\r\nMr Soares, Dr Cavalcanti. Dr Moura and Dr Mendonca. Did Mr\r\nBesterman interview any one of these persons ? Did he talk to any\r\nof the sitters who are recorded as being present at the alleged\r\nmaterializations of Bishop Barros, Prof. Ferreira, or Dr de Souza's\r\ndaughter ? To say that their testimony \" is of relatively little value \" is beside the point. It is as valuable as that of Mr Besterman,\r\nsince what they record is quite as striking as anything with D. D.\r\nHome. Do these witnesses exist ? Were they present at these\r\nsittings ? Were they lying or are they made to record phenomena\r\nwhich never took place at all ? Or must we admit that certain \" events took place which were described by those who witnessed them\r\nin the terms we liave read \" ? What were those events ? I wrote these\r\nwords in 1930. No answer has been attempted. Yet in 1934, at\r\nheavy cost to the S.P.R., Mr Besterman goes to South America\r\nostensibly to inquire into what he terms Mirabelli's \" astounding\r\nfeats \" and comes back with tales of revolving objects which puzzled\r\nhim, just as Professor Driesch and Miss May Walker came back\r\nwith stories of a door which closed by itself and a camera which\r\njumped on a table.\r\nThe problem of Mirabelli is the same as that of Home. In the\r\nlatter case the witnesses are dead and cannot now be interviewed : in the former case they are living and can be seen and cross-examined.\r\nSigned statements by Dr G. de Souza, Dr Moura or Dr Mendonca\r\ndescribing in then own words what they saw on certain occasions\r\nas recorded in 0 Medium Mirabelli would be worth far more than\r\nstories of revolving blackboards and jumping cameras which puzzled\r\nobservers who would be equally puzzled by 90% of conjuring tricks\r\nperformed by even moderately skilled artistes. As it was it seems\r\nthat the medium found Mr Besterman fairly \" easy,\" since he not\r\nonly put a coin into Mr Besterman's pocket without the latter\r\nknowing anything about it, but then suggested to him to name the\r\nvery pocket into which the coin had been put when, according to\r\nMr Besterman's account, he had been given free choice to name the\r\nplace where he wished the coin to re-materialize. If Mr Besterman\r\nhad said, \" under my heel inside my shoe,\" what would have happened ( Evidently Mirabelli knew his sitter. Yours, etc.,\r\nE. J.

For while\r\nit is clear that the Society must continue its excellent work of testing\r\nthe evidence for survival by every ingenious method that can be\r\nthought of, there seems no reason why other experiments should not\r\nbe carried on concurrently, with the hypothesis of survival provisionally adopted as a working basis.\r\nThere are now many people who possess extra-normal power and\r\nwho seem to themselves to be in touch with some definite group of\r\ndiscarnate personalities, acting together and more or less responsible\r\nfor the communications made by automatic writing or clairaudient\r\ndictation. The \" free flow of unverifiable matter \" coming through\r\nthese channels is often interesting, but there is no means of separating out what comes from the medium's subconsciousness and what\r\ncomes from other sources. Might it not be worth while to try some\r\nproxy sittings not for evidence of the survival of the recently dead,\r\nbut for evidence of the independent intelligence of these \" groups \".\r\nIf, for instance, a group A produced through their usual channel\r\n(an amateur sensitive probably) a definite body of teaching, might\r\nit not be possible to invite the A group to communicate something\r\nrelevant to that set of ideas through a Leonard sitting, the sitter\r\nbeing in complete ignorance of the kind of thing expected I Yours very truly,\r\nTheodora Bosanquet.\r\nScarcity of Accounts of Spontaneous Cases in\r\nThe Journal.\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal of the Society\r\nfor Psychical Research\r\nJune 29, 1935.\r\nMadam,\u2014As a member of the S.P.R. of more than forty years'\r\nstanding, may I express the regret that accounts of spontaneous\r\ncases on the pages of our publications appear to grow scarcer and\r\nscarcer 1 I wonder what the reason of that scarcity can be. Three hypotheses present themselves to me :\r\n(1) Such cases are of less frequent occurrence than before.\r\n1 Through a Stranger's Hands, New Evidence for Survival; compiled by\r\nNea Walker.

Hypotheses 2 and 3 I would consider as most undesirable.\r\nFor it has long seemed to me that the collection and study of\r\nspontaneous cases are likely to be one of the most fruitful fields of\r\n\" psychical \" investigations. And judging by my own experience\r\nand why should I be here a particularly privileged person ?\r\nincidents affording prima facie evidence of supernormal, nay even\r\npost mortem action are relatively not very infrequent.\r\nWe ought, in my opinion, to collect and register as many as we\r\ncan. I do not say our Society does not ; very likely it does. But\r\nI note that our Journal contains now but very few such incidents\r\nindeed.\r\nAnd yet does not such a work as Phantasms of the Living constitute even now, some fifty years after its publication, one of the foundation stones on which the S.P.R. has been raised ? If there is some hope for Psychical Research of getting tangible\r\nand positive results it is, I think, chiefly in the study of spontaneous\r\nphenomena. Could not a decisive effort be renewed in that direction ? I am,\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\r\n[We judge from the response in 1934 to appeals made during the\r\nB.B.C. Talks, that spontaneous phenomena are occurring very much\r\nas they always did. But it is difficult to persuade people to take the\r\ntrouble involved in sending accounts promptly : thus, only four per\r\ncent, of the cases of telepathy which reached Mrs Salter after her\r\ntalk were up to the standard required for publication in the Journal.\r\nIt would seem that the only way of getting a steady flow of spontaneous cases is to have a large number of active and persistent\r\ncollectors. And, if the Count's letter stimulates any of our members\r\nto take up that work, it will have been of great service. Some of our most energetic members happen to be working on other lines. But\r\nwe should indeed welcome a response to the Count's appeal. Perhaps\r\nnew members may feel inclined to respond and thus to gain an insight\r\ninto the work of the Society which they will not otherwise get % Hon.

Ever since the Society's foundation, fifty-four\r\nyears ago, Mrs Sidgwick played a leading part in our work, and she\r\nhas left an enduring mark both on psychical research as a study, and\r\non the S.P.R. as an organisation for pursuing it.

Their\r\nnames and addresses are given above.\r\nThe Report of the Council for 1935 was considered, and adopted\r\nas amended.\r\nTHE MYERS MEMORIAL LECTURE, 1935\r\nThe attention of our Members is called to the publication of this\r\nlecture, the fourth of the Series, which was delivered last autumn\r\nby Mr Whately Carington. It is entitled The Meaning of\r\n'\r\n' Survival \",\r\nand can be obtained from the Secretary (price Is.).\r\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1935\r\n(1) Organisation of Research. As announced in the Annual Report\r\nfor 1934 the Council appointed a Research Committee, to advise as\r\nto the future organisation of research and to initiate and carry out\r\nsuch research work as was practicable in the immediate future.\r\nAfter long consideration of various possibilities, the Council adopted\r\ntwo recommendations of the Research Committee : (1) That in the\r\npresent circumstances of the Society it would be desirable to appoint a young graduate of a British University as Research student, to\r\nbe trained in the Society's methods, with a view to possibly becoming Research Officer later ; and (2) That Mr C. V. C. Herbert should\r\nbe appointed Research Student for one year from September 1935.\r\nMr Herbert is a graduate of Cambridge University, a member of the\r\nSociety, and has had experience in psychical research and various\r\nbranches of scientific work.\r\nThe Research Committee continues to meet regularly.\r\n(2) Experiments conducted by Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell. Mr Tyrrell\r\nhas during the year actively pursued his experiments in ExtraSensory Perception, both with the apparatus designed by him and\r\ndescribed in the Journal for April 1935, and with a new electrical\r\napparatus he has designed, the object of which is both to eliminate sources of error in this class of investigation, and, where positive\r\nresults occur, to differentiate between different types of extrasensory perception, such as telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition. Additional experiments have also been done with cards. Mr\r\nTyrrell has had interesting results, and it is hoped that these will\r\nbe embodied in a report which will shortly be given to the Society.\r\nThe Council appealed to members of the Society to collaborate with\r\nMr Tyrrell in his experiments, and they wish to express their thanks\r\n176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1936\r\nto all those who responded to this appeal. The cost of constructing\r\nthe electrical apparatus already mentioned was borne partly by a\r\ngenerous donation from the President, Professor C. D. Broad, and\r\npartly by the funds of the Society. Additions to the apparatus were made by Mr Tyrrell with the generous co-operation and\r\nassistance of Mr Saltmarsh.\r\n(3) Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities. Mr Whately\r\nCarington has continued his important studies in this field. A\r\nfurther report by him was read to the Society on the 27th March\r\nand has since been published in Part 141 of Proceedings. Mr Carington has also been conducting experiments in precognition.\r\n(4) Records of Sittings until Mrs Leonard. For some time past\r\nvarious members of the Society have been so good as to place at\r\nthe Society's disposal complete annotated records of their sittings\r\nwith Mrs Leonard with a view to providing matter for a thorough\r\npsychological investigation. Mr Kenneth Richmond, a trained\r\npsychologist, has kindly consented at the Council's request to undertake the laborious task of making such an examination, and on\r\nthis task he has now been engaged for the greater part of the year.\r\nDuring this period a further opportunity occurred, which he gladly\r\ntook, of studying Leonard material of a slightly different type,\r\nnamely records of \" proxy \" communications obtained by Miss Nea\r\nWalker from \" communicators \" concerning whom she had very\r\nsmall information, and Mrs Leonard none at all. As a result of this\r\nstudy several of these records have been published in a book\r\n(Through a Stranger s Hands : New Evidence for Survival, compiled\r\nby Nea Walker) edited by Mr Richmond with a Preface by Sir\r\nOliver Lodge. Mr Richmond's main task is likely to occupy him for\r\nsome time to come, but he hopes very shortly to present a first report on it.\r\n(5) Finance of Research. In respect of all the above-mentioned\r\npieces of research work the Council has made grants which, while\r\nthey cannot be considered as commensurate with the value of the\r\nwork done, have nevertheless facilitated the doing of it. The grants\r\nhave been made from the anonymous donation referred to in the\r\nAnnual Report for 1934, which has enabled the Council to encourage\r\nresearch in several directions in a way that would otherwise hardly\r\nhave been possible.\r\n(6) Mr Herbert's Tour. Mr Herbert took up his duties as research\r\nstudent after the summer holidays. Owing to the generosity of a member of the Society, who offered to pay all expenses, he was able\r\nin company with some other members of the Society to undertake\r\na visit to Austria, Poland and Czecho-Slovakia, in the course of\r\nFebruary 1936 Annual Report of the Council for 1935 177\r\nwhich he had sittings with various mediums, including Rudi\r\nSchneider, Kluski and Ossowiecki. In particular he had an opportunity of observing in operation an apparatus designed by Professor\r\nSchwaiger, which may prove important in paraphysical investigation.\r\n(7) Mrs Warren Elliott. Mrs Elliott, who in the year 1928, gave\r\na long series of sittings for the Society, a report on which was published in Part 112 of Proceedings, has very kindly offered to permit\r\na further investigation of her phenomena to be made by the Society.\r\nThe Council has very gratefully accepted this generous offer, but Mrs\r\nElliott's regrettable ill-health has so far prevented any experiments\r\nbeing carried out.\r\n(8) Other Research Works. The Council regrets that the number\r\nof spontaneous cases reported to the Society does not show any\r\nappreciable increase. This branch of the Society's work is important, and the Council once again expresses the hope that members\r\nwill do all they can to bring well-attested spontaneous cases to the\r\nnotice of the Society. It is intended that such cases shall in future\r\nbe dealt with by Mr Herbert, in consultation with the Secretary and\r\nHon. Secretary.\r\n(9) Myers Memorial Lecture. The Council appointed Mr Whately\r\nCarington to deliver the Myers Memorial Lecture for 1935. Mr\r\nCarington gave his lecture on the 39th October, and it has since been\r\npublished by the Trustees of the Fund under the title The Meaning\r\nof \" Survival\" . Copies (price Is.) can be obtained from the Secretary.\r\n(10) The Presidency. The Council elected Professor C. D. Broad,\r\nLitt.D., Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Cambridge, President for the year. Professor Broad delivered\r\nhis Presidential Address on the 1st May : it has been published as Part 142 of Proceedings.\r\n(11) Changes in the Council. The Council greatly regrets to record\r\nthe loss from their numbers of three Council Members, who found\r\nthemselves, owing to illness, unable to continue to attend Council\r\nMeetings, namely, Mr. J. Arthur Hill, Mr W. R. Bousfield, K.C.,\r\nF.R.S., and Professor F. C. S. Schiller (a Vice-President and former\r\nPresident of the Society). All three had for many years been\r\nmembers of the Council, and have rendered great service to the\r\nSociety and to psychical research. The Council appointed Professor\r\nBroad and Mr Whately Carington (hitherto co-opted members) to\r\nfill the vacancies among the elected members of Council caused by\r\nthe resignations of Professor Schiller and Mr Bousfield.\r\n(12) Mrs SidgwicFs Ninetieth Birthday. On the 11th March Mrs\r\nSidgwick, who has been very closely connected with the Society's\r\n178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1936\r\nwork ever since its foundation, and to whose services in research, in\r\nadministration, and in counsel, the success, and even the continu- ance of the Society has been largely due, completed her ninetieth\r\nyear. The Council at their March meeting passed an unanimous\r\nvote of congratulation to her, which they are sure will have the\r\nhearty approval of the whole Society.\r\n(13) Changes among the Officers and Honorary Officers. In March\r\nAdmiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt took over the duties of Hon. Treasurer;\r\nthe Council wishes to thank him for undertaking this work.\r\nMr Besterman's appointment as Investigation Officer and Librarian terminated in January, and the Council then took occasion\r\nto place on record their appreciation of the many services rendered\r\nby him to the Society.\r\nMiss Kathleen Watkins, F.L.A., has very kindly agreed to act as Hon. Librarian. The Council consider themselves very fortunate in\r\nobtaining the services of a trained professional librarian for this\r\nposition.\r\nThey also wish to thank Miss H. E. Kennedy, who has offered to\r\ntranslate for the Council any letters, etc., in the various foreign\r\nlanguages with which she is familiar.\r\n(14) New Honorary Member, Corresponding Member, and Honorary\r\nAssociates. The Council has made an addition to the very small\r\nnumbers of Honorary Members of the Society by electing Professor\r\nR. A. Fisher, of London University, who has on several occasions\r\nassisted the Society's investigations by placing at the disposal of our members his unrivalled statistical knowledge. In electing Dr\r\nElwood Worcester as a Corresponding Member they have renewed\r\nthe close personal ties between our Society and the Boston Society\r\nfor Psychical Research. Dr R. H. Thouless of Glasgow University^\r\nand Professor Hoernle of Witwatersrand University, South Africa^\r\nboth of whom have taken an active part in the Society's work, have\r\nbeen elected Honorary Associates.\r\n(15) The Tenancy of the Society's Premises. The Society's original\r\nLease of No. 31 Tavistock Square was due to expire in June 1937,\r\nand in view of the dislocation of the Society's work which would\r\noccur if the Society were compelled at the expiration of this Lease\r\nto move to other premises, the Council approached the Landlord\r\nas to the possibility of a renewal of the Lease. They consider themselves very fortunate in having secured from the Landlord an agreement for a new Lease of 21 years to run from June 1935 (the last\r\ntwo years of the old Lease being surrendered), even though the\r\nrent under the new Lease will be somewhat higher than under the\r\nold. As on many previous occasions the Council wishes most\r\nFebruary 1936 Annual Report of the Council for 1935 179\r\ncordially to thank Mr Sidney Scott for conducting the legal business\r\ninvolved.\r\n(16) The Oslo Congress. The Fifth International Congress for\r\nPsychical Research was held at Oslo in the latter part of August\r\non the invitation of the Norwegian S.P.R. Several members of the\r\nSociety attended, and Mr. Whately Carington, Dr E. J. Dingwall\r\nand Mr Kenneth Richmond contributed papers. It is expected\r\nthat the next Congress will be held in Budapest.\r\n(17) Library. In addition to Members who consulted books in the\r\nLibrary, 71 Members borrowed books, the total number of books\r\nlent being 369 ; 83 books were borrowed by members of the public\r\nthrough the National Central Library, many more than last year ; and several Members availed themselves of the privilege of borrowing books on various subjects from other Libraries through the\r\nSociety and the National Central Library.\r\n(18) Obituary. During the past year the Society lost in Professor\r\nCharles Richet not only a Corresponding Member who had held the\r\noffice of President, but one of the most distinguished scientists who\r\nhas ever been actively engaged in Psychical Research. Among\r\nother losses to the Society by death we may mention Mr Giles T.\r\nPilcher, Mr J. G. Bower, Mr P. W. A. Cort van der Linden, Major\r\nClive Behrens, Mr Arthur H. Leaf, Mrs Champion de Crespigny and\r\nMajor W. Rampling Rose.\r\n(19) Membership of the Society. During the year 36 new Members\r\nand two Student Associates were elected ; one Associate became a Member, and one previous Associate who had resigned during the\r\nfinancial depression was re-elected. The total loss in numbers from\r\ndeaths, resignations and other causes were 35 Members and 14\r\nAssociates, leaving a net increase of two Members and a decrease of\r\n11 Associates. The total membership of the Society now stands at\r\n734.\r\n(20) Publications. Five Parts of Proceedings were published during the year : Part 139 in April, Part 140 in May, Part 141 in July,\r\nPart 142 in October, and Part 143 in December.\r\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to \u00a396 17s. 3d.\r\nand to Members of the Society \u00a372 0s. 4d., a considerable increase\r\nin both departments on the sales in the past few years. The returns\r\nfrom the Society's agent in the United States amounted, after\r\ndeduction of commission, to \u00a311 0s. 2d.\r\n(21) Meetings.

Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014In Mr Theodore Besterman's Paper published in the\r\nJournal of December 1935 he states, in connection with \" the blackboard rotation phenomenon \", that \"... the fact that Mirabelli\r\nallowed me on each occasion to arrange the mise en scene and did\r\nnot precipitate himself on the board as it fell ...\"\r\nI was permitted to see the film in question last summer, and have\r\nagain more recently had it projected. It seems to me that Mr\r\nBesterman is mistaken. The second occasion of the blackboard\r\nrotation phenomenon is fairly clear in the film. It shows Mirabelli\r\nthrowing himself upon the board just before the camera was stopped.\r\nNo doubt Mr Besterman was unable to see this, as he was manipulating the camera at the time. The first occasion of the same phenomenon is very obscure on the film, but as far as I could judge\r\nMirabelli is not then seen to touch the blackboard.\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nCharles M.

Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014In the January Journal Count Solovovo raises a most\r\ninteresting question : as to why accounts of spontaneous cases get\r\nscarcer and scarcer in our pages.\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that such cases occur less frequently.\r\nAs you point out in your editorial note, the response to the appeals\r\nmade two years ago in the B.B.C. talks disproves that. Nor does our Society attach any less importance to them than formerly.\r\nCount Solovovo's hypothesis No. 2 is the true one, namely \" that\r\naccounts of them are being sent to the S.P.R. far more seldom than\r\nbefore\". Having during the last ten years or so seen practically all the spontaneous cases, good, bad and indifferent, reported to the\r\nS.P.R. , as and when they were reported, I can say most positively\r\nthat during the last four or five years the decline in reports received\r\nhas been strongly marked : it has more than once been the subject\r\nof comment in the Council's reports.\r\nTwo causes are, I think, mainly responsible for the decline.\r\nFirst, the fact that during these years the daily press has printed\r\nmore than one collection of alleged spontaneous cases, unverified,\r\nuncorroborated, and, judged by S.P.R. standards, quite worthless.\r\nNot only have a number of possibly good cases been lost to the\r\nSociety in this way, but among more intelligent newspaper readers\r\nthe whole subject has been cheapened and reduced to the level of a\r\n\" stunt\". Secondly, public attention, so far as it has any concern with psychical research, has been diverted to other and more\r\nsensational matters.\r\nAll this is most deplorable. The remedy is, as you, Madam,\r\nsuggest, more active collaboration by our members in collecting cases and reporting them to Tavistock Square. It must be emphasised that the greatest possible promptness in reporting is essential.\r\nMr Herbert and the other officers of the Society will lose no time in\r\nfollowing up a case as soon as it is reported to them. It would be\r\nparticularly valuable if members living in the provinces would keep a sharp eye on the local press, which often prints accounts of apparitions, premonitions, hauntings, etc., and would at once cut out the\r\naccounts and post them to Mr Herbert, who will be glad to receive\r\nthem and to make all necessary enquiries.\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nW. H. Salter (Hon. Sec.)\r\nFebruary 1936 Correspondence 185\r\nTo the Hon Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I as one of the oldest Members of the Society for\r\nPsychical Research strongly endorse the remarks of Count Solovovo\r\nin his letter in the last Journal. Anyone referring to the earlier\r\nnumbers of the Journal and comparing them with those of the last\r\nfew years will at once appreciate how far the Society has drifted\r\naway from its original conception. What we require are facts and\r\nobservations throwing light on a future life, and the connection of\r\nthose who have passed away with those at present alive. Instead\r\nof this we get long letters of vague theory and futile mathematical\r\ncalculations about the proportions of guess-work. These may possibly be suitable for mathematical or statistical societies, but have\r\nno bearing on the objects we founded the Society for half a century\r\nago. I for one (and I believe there are many others) would be very\r\nglad to see the Society return to its own functions of investigation\r\nof Psychic Phenomena.\r\nYours truly,\r\nHenry N. Ridley, F.R.S.\r\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014The point made by Mr Drayton Thomas is, it seems to\r\nme, an important one, viz. that the possible modus operandi of the\r\ntrance, and what may conceivably happen therein, might appreciably lengthen the reaction times. He continues : \" Let him (the\r\ncritic) go through the list of stimulus words again, whispering his\r\nreplies to another person, who shall then voice them for him,. The\r\nmean reaction time, as taken from the replies voiced by that second\r\nperson, will be considerably longer than when the Professor spoke\r\nthe reactions himself \". This agrees with the remark made in our Report : \"... It must be emphasized that, on theory, the reactions are not\r\nobtained under normal conditions, and a longer reaction time than\r\nusual must be allowed in consequence. On the spiritistic theory, a\r\ncertain amount of time for ' transmission ' must certainly be\r\nallowed \" {Bulletin A.P.I. , pp. 41-42).\r\nIt seems to me that this point has been unduly slighted by those\r\nwho have dealt with the reaction times, in the trance state, as compared with normal reactions. Yet, if the spiritistic theory is to be\r\nconsidered at all, surely this must be taken into account ? Yours, etc.,\r\nHereward Carrington.\r\n186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1936\r\nEEVIEW\r\nGeraldine Cummins, Beyond Human Personality. 8vo. Pp. 223.\r\n(London : Ivor Nicholson & Watson, Ltd.) 1935. Price 6s. net. This volume contains a further series of automatic scripts purporting to be communicated by the late F. W. H. Myers. The first series was published in 1932 under the title The Road to Immortality, a review of which appeared in the Journal for May 1933 (pp. 75-76).\r\nThe reader is referred to that review for a general account of the\r\nscripts written by Miss Cummins, and purporting to come from\r\nMyers. They started in 1924, and have continued to the present\r\ntime, the essays in the volume under review having been mostly\r\nwritten in 1933 and 1934.\r\nFor the student of psychical research the chief point of interest\r\nin the scripts is the claim of authorship. In the first place it must\r\nbe noticed that they do not purport to be Myers' actual words.\r\nThe medium is said to be an \" interpreter \" (see Introduction, p. 17),\r\nand her general stock of ideas and level of culture limit and control\r\nthe mode of expression. Any comparison of style and vocabulary\r\nwith those of Myers' published works would therefore be ex hypothesi\r\nvalueless. The most one can look for is some parallelism of thought,\r\nand in assessing this opinions will differ. The earlier scripts published in The Road to Immortality contained several passages to\r\nwhich fairly close parallels (in thought, not style) can be found in\r\nHuman Personality, and certain of Myers' poems. As Miss Cummins\r\nhad not read any of Myers' works at the time the scripts were\r\nwritten, this was interesting, though the evidence fell far short of\r\nproof of the identity of the \" communicator \". Since the publication of the earher volume, Miss Cummins has no doubt increased\r\nher normally acquired stock of information about Myers, but the\r\n\" communicator \" has not made use of this in the scripts under\r\nreview. His lines of thought have been projected so far into the\r\nrealms of speculation that they have lost almost every vestige of\r\n\" clue-forming \" material.\r\nThe authors referred to by name in these scripts are Job, St. Paul, Plato, Xenophon, Plotinus and \" Madam Blavatsky \". The\r\nlast named is criticised for sponsoring an erroneous hypothesis\r\n(p. 136), but the reference to her is hardly convincing, considering\r\nthat Myers was a member of the Committee of the S.P.K. which\r\ninvestigated the impostures of that lady, who was responsible for a good deal more than erroneous hypotheses.\r\nIn general it may be said that the script, while lacking in individual character, has gained in family likeness to many other scripts\r\nFebeuaey 1936 Review 187\r\npurporting to describe the conditions of life after death. The usual\r\ntopics recur, such as clothes in the next world (p. 37), the fourth\r\ndimension (p. 39), sex relationships (p. 41), the man with two wives\r\n(p. 42), reincarnation (p. 76), animals (p. 197). Close parallels in\r\nmatter and style can be found in many other scripts purporting to\r\ncome from different individuals, in which all the above subjects are\r\ndealt with in the same rather colourless fashion. (For instance, all the subjects mentioned are to be found in Letters from a Living\r\nDead Man, Elsa Barker : Rider, 1915.)\r\nIn chapters entitled \" Beyond Human Personality \" and \" Solar\r\nMan \" there are astronomical speculations regarding life on the\r\nplanets, the sun, and the stars, of a kind with which Myers was no doubt familiar in his lifetime. See, for instance, his poem \" A\r\nCosmic History \" (Collected Poems, p. 384), and footnote thereto.\r\nBut the treatment in the script is more akin to work in that field by other \" script authors \" than to anything Myers wrote himself.\r\nThe same may be said of the chapter on \" Prayer \". In editing a work of this kind, it is important to distinguish\r\nclearly between actual and \" script \" personalities and their respective statements. Miss E. B. Gibbes, who writes the Introduction,\r\nis careful in this respect in the sub-title, which speaks of a\r\n\" Detailed\r\nDescription of the Future Life purporting to be communicated by\r\nthe late F. W. H. Myers \", and in the closing paragraphs of the\r\nIntroduction, where she speaks of the \" alleged F. W. H. M. \". But\r\nelsewhere she abandons caution and says, for instance, \" Readers\r\nof The Road to Immortality will remember the account given by\r\nFrederic Myers of the World of Illusion \"\r\n(p. 15). This is hardly\r\nfair to the memory of that great pioneer of psychical research, whose\r\npart in these scripts, even on the spiritist hypothesis, falls far short\r\nof authorship, in the ordinary sense of that term.

M. Johnson read a paper on \" Psychical Research from a\r\nSensitive's Point of View,\" which gave rise to an interesting discussion.\r\nTHOUGHTS ON THE REACTIONS OF \" DORA \" TO\r\nTHE WORD-TESTS\r\nBy the Rev. W. S. Irving\r\nIt well may he that the calling of words, and the noting the re- actions to those words of various Communicators, will prove to have\r\nopened out a new and fruitful field of investigation for students of\r\nTrance phenomena, quite apart from the reaction-timing and the\r\ntaking down of the reproductions. On 13 September, 1934, at the\r\nconclusion of her first set of these tests, \" Dora \" remarked to me : \" Do you know, while I'm giving these I could give you quite a good sitting % They bring up so many memories. It's because I'm\r\nnot trying to remember\u2014I'm myself, they come to me. These provoke so much thought and memory, too good to be missed. This is so natural. I'm not trying to remember as a test\u2014naturally. I think you'll find out, after, I've said quite a lot of personal things.\"\r\nAfter her fourth series of word-tests, she added : \" It's been very interesting because it's awakened so many\r\nmemories\u2014so many memories.\"\r\nThe study of her five series of reaction words, taken as a whole,\r\nwhich I have since made, fully justifies, I think, her remarks ; and,\r\nfurther, the kind of reminiscences evoked by these more or less commonplace words differs from that of the reminiscences usually\r\ngiven.\r\nIn ordinary Trance sittings I have found that the material,\r\nthrough Mrs Leonard, has consisted mainly of reminiscences of the\r\nthings that we did and thought important in byegone days, to- gether with present-day tests, and knowledge shown of present,\r\npast, and occasionally even future happenings. The stimulating\r\neffect of these reaction words would seem to be to strike a quite\r\ndifferent chord\u2014to restore the mental attitude of the Communicator much as it was in past surroundings, as well as to bring back\r\nmemory of trivial yet evidential details in those surroundings.

In this particular case, the Vicar's wife, Dora, was accus- tomed before marriage to a life of considerable gaiety. There has\r\nbeen nothing even approaching this line of thought at any of my\r\nprevious sittings. Next, let us take the subject of holidays which was introduced above by the words \" short \" and \" chance \" :\r\n1-Lj 2*J, 3U, 4-X;, 5*J lake Windermere You ought to have a memory about it 1,2,4,5 town Scarborough\r\n1, 2, 6, 4 valley near\r\n5 holiday\r\n3 fetch luggage That reminds me of\r\n' ; valley \".\r\n1 rage torrent\r\n2 waterfall Couldn't think of the\r\nword ! 3 load station We often had that !

Do you remember\r\na holiday we had where was a beautiful valley 1 You could look\r\nright down the side of it\u2014lovely place. Do you remember we nearly\r\ngot somewhere else instead of going there ? \" (Do you mean Scarborough ?) \"No. I'm thinking of somewhere else. We'd very\r\nnearly gone to another place again. Not in that part. There was\r\na\r\n' C ' connected with it. . . .\"\r\nIt is not, I think, difficult to trace a clearly connected line of\r\nthought in some of the above reactions : Scarborough is a town\r\nthat has pleasant memories for my wife and myself. She lived\r\nthere for a time as a child. We spent part of at least a dozen summer\r\nholidays there, and for a short time I was Assistant Curate at a Church in that town. In itself, however, the mention of Scarborough must be said to have a diminished value here, in that it has already been mentioned by Dora at past Sittings on several\r\noccasions ; but the interest, here, is not in the mention of Scarborough,\r\nbut in the line of thought that would seem to be started thereby.\r\nScarborough is divided into two parts by the valley, and. over the\r\nvalley runs a toll bridge leading from north to south of the town.\r\nArriving at Scarborough, on holiday, we regularly crossed the valley\r\nbridge with our luggage to get to the House of Rest where we\r\ngenerally stayed. The same occurred during the time we lived at\r\nScarborough, as we lived on the south cliff near the valley. My\r\nwife, also, when a child, lived in a house close to the valley. But\r\nthis is not all : remembrance of that valley seems to have recalled\r\nto Dora's mind a holiday near another and somewhat similar valley,\r\nwhere there is a far deeper view to look down upon\u2014the valley\r\nbeneath Clifton Suspension Bridge which crosses the Avon gorge.\r\nIn, I think, 1917 we had the chance of slipping away for a few days'\r\nholiday. We did not decide where to go till we got as far as Gloucester and could learn from the newspapers there whether Birmingham or Bristol had the best \" Shows \" on at the theatres. We\r\nchose Bristol, staying at Clifton, and the reference to our nearly\r\nhaving gone to another place seems pretty clear ; though, \" again \"\r\nis not appropriate. Bristol and Clifton were quite well known to\r\nmy wife, however, apart from that particular holiday, as we stayed\r\nseveral times at Clifton. It is not improbable that the reaction\r\n\" pond \" to the word \" fish \" may be a further reference to the\r\ntown, as Fishponds, which is a part of Bristol, was a familiar name\r\nto my wife, and the reaction would, I think, be a natural one. Not much need be said about the other \" holiday \" words, but\r\n\" Windermere \" is a good reaction to \" lake \", as in 1901 and 1902\r\nMarch 1936 Reactions of \" Dora \" to Word-Tests 195\r\nwe stayed for a day or two at an hotel at the head of Windermere : some of the other lakes would not have been applicable. \" Holiday \"\r\nfits in all right with \" abroad \" when it is coupled with the remark\r\n\" Talked about it ! \" Although we were never abroad together, we\r\nhad talked about a holiday in Paris the following year\u2014a sister of\r\nmy wife's was then living there. \" Voyage \"\u2014\" channel \" is good\r\n\r\nwe crossed the Bristol Channel from Weston to Cardiff about a month before my wife's last illness. And \" voyage \"\u2014\" island \"\r\nis reminiscent of trips we made from Southsea to the Isle of Wight.\r\nTurning to the subject of the giving of the reaction words : Mrs\r\nLeonard (prepared) 1 seemed to be but mildly interested. Feda and\r\n\" Dora \", however, were both bubbling over with reminiscences, and\r\nhad to be continually checked lest the power should give out before\r\nthe end. This was a very great pity as their sayings seemed to be\r\nof value. In reproductions, Feda seemed to have no special in- terest ; but \" Dora \" was intensely anxious to remember, and kept\r\nsaying, \" Don't tell me ! Don't tell me! \"\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nThe Study of the Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's\r\nMediumship\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I think that everyone will agree that one of the outstanding events in the recent history of psychical research has been\r\nthe publication of Lord Balfour's \" Study of the Psychological\r\nAspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship\", Proc. XLIII.\r\nA prolonged and careful study of this report has led me to see that there are involved therein matters of quite fundamental import- ance not only for psychical research, but also for psychology and\r\nmetaphysics. To refuse to accept the views put forward with such\r\ncogency of argument and supported by such weight of evidence is\r\ndifficult, yet acceptation entails for many of us a radical readjustment of our basic ideas.\r\nIn these circumstances I am emboldened to put forward a plea\r\nfor further enlightenment on several points which remain obscure to me. May I say at once that the questions which I ask are framed in no spirit of criticism, but solely with a sincere desire for information.\r\n1 It will be remembered that, for the purpose of these word- reaction tests Mr Whately Carington distinguishes between words put to Mrs Leonard in a ' prepared ' state, i.e. just before giving a sitting ; and words put to her\r\napart from sittings altogether, i.e. in a ' normal ' state.\r\n\r\nHon. Ed.\r\n196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1936\r\nThe matter of paramount importance is the monadic theory of\r\npersonality. In this connection I have read Lord Balfour's Presidential Address, Proc. XIX, and his article in the Hibbert Journal,\r\nApril 1913. I have also refreshed my memory of Prof. McDougall's\r\nPresidential Address, Proc. XXXI, and I am familiar with the\r\nrelevant passages in his Outline of Abnormal Psychology.\r\nIn spite of a careful study of all these sources of information, I\r\nstill find myself rather puzzled over many points of the theory.\r\nAs I understand it the human personahty is regarded as an association of selves, composed of a dominant monad at the head of an\r\nhierarchy of subordinate monads, interacting with each other and\r\nintercommunicating by means of telepathy. Prof. McDougall employs the analogy of an army ; the dominant monad is represented\r\nby the Commander-in-Chief, receiving reports from and issuing in- structions to his subordinate officers. I was tempted at first to think of the personality as being analog- ous to the entire army considered as an unity in much the same\r\nway as a colonial organism is an unity, but we are told that the real\r\nself is the dominant monad. Prof. McDougall says : \"I who consciously address you am only one among several selves or egos which\r\nmy organism, my person, comprises. I am only the dominant\r\nmember of a society, an association of similar members \" (Proc.\r\nXXXI, page 111). Lord Balfour also says : \" My own instinctive\r\nconviction is that my true self is the ' me as I know myself', and\r\nthat it will be as this me, with its formed character and stored\r\nmemories, that I shall survive, if survival there be. Other selves\r\nco-conscious with ' me as I know myself ' may also survive \" (Proc.\r\nXLIII, page 275). The \" me as I know myself \" is then the dominant monad. Who, then, are the subordinate monads, the other\r\nconscious selves ? Are they also me, but not \" me as I know\r\nmyself \" ? As they are selves, presumably they are self-conscious,\r\nand therefore know themselves as someone. In cases of dual personality one of these selves apparently assumes a personal identity\r\ndifferent from the \" me as I know myself\", and in some instances,\r\nsuch as Sally in the Beauchamp case, claims to have had a separate\r\npersonal existence long before the date of emergence.\r\nFurther, does the theory assume that these subordinate selves are capable of existing, in any circumstances, apart from the\r\nassociation ? Are the subordinate monads permanent members of\r\nthe association, or is there a process of change therein analogous to\r\nthat of the cells composing a living organism in virtue of which,\r\nthough the organism maintains its identity, individual cells may\r\ndecay and vanish, being replaced by other similar cells which carry\r\nMarch 1936 Correspondence 197\r\non their functions ? If so, where do they go and whence do the new\r\nones come ? Prof. McDougall speaks of a\r\n\" budding \" in his\r\nPresidential Address : are we to suppose that the subordinate\r\nmonads are budded off the dominant monad, either by a process\r\nanalogous to propagation by simple fission or like suckers thrown\r\noff by a plant, and that this process goes on throughout the whole\r\nof life, or that it is confined to infancy or some period in the earlier\r\nhistory of the individual ? The dominant monad, being a complete\r\nself, possesses cognitive and affective-volitional faculties, it has its own proper train of memory. Does it perceive the external world\r\ndirectly ? Can it employ the entire mechanism of the physical\r\nbody, including the sense organs, or does it make contact with its external environment only by deputy through the subordinate\r\nmonads ? These latter, being also selves, presumably enjoy possession of the\r\nfull complement of mental faculties : do they also have full run of\r\nthe physical organism or are they specialised as to function 1 I rather gather from Prof. McDougall's account that the latter view\r\nis correct, so that the subordinate monads should, strictly speaking,\r\nbe considered as less than complete selves, ranging from those in\r\nthe hierarchy nearest to the dominant, which would be nearly\r\ncomplete, down to the lowest orders whose specialised function is, say, some simple reflex. There are hosts of other questions which I should like to ask, but\r\nspace forbids.\r\nBefore leaving the matter, however, there is one point which I must raise. Lord Balfour rightly insists that inter-monadic tele- pathy is essential to the theory, and that without it it cannot stand.\r\nIn consequence we are bound to give up the view, held by Myers,\r\nthat telepathy is a function of the subliminal alone and is not shared\r\nby the supra-hminal personality. Presumably the same argument\r\napplies to telaesthesia.\r\nNow it seems to me that the weight of the evidence points to\r\nthere being a certain amount of dissociation in the large majority\r\nof cases of supernormal mental phenomena, so that although the\r\ndominant monad may possess the faculties to some degree, they are\r\nin the main exercised by selves other than the \" me as I know\r\nmyself\". Telepathy and telaesthesia, in their more advanced forms,\r\nare a heightening of mental activity, and as such it would surely be\r\nstrange to find them in the possession of the subordinate monads\r\nto a greater degree than in the dominant.\r\nI, very diffidently, venture to suggest the following view. The\r\ndominant monad, the \" me as I know myself\", occupies a position\r\n198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1936\r\nnot at the head of the hierarchy, but somewhere about the middle ; ranging below it are the subordinate monads, each specialising in its proper function and each endowed with powers of telepathy and\r\npossibly telaesthesia in appropriate degree ; ranging above it are other selves as superior to the dominant as the dominant is to the\r\nsubordinates : these would possess telepathic and telaesthetic powers\r\nin a more perfect and complete degree than does the dominant\r\n;\r\nfinally we reach the head monad of all, whom we might call, with\r\nMyers, the transcendental self. To borrow Prof. McDougall's analogy, while the dominant monad\r\nis represented by the Commander-in-Chief located at G.H.Q., these\r\nsuperior monads would be represented by the Supreme Army\r\nCouncil, the Cabinet, and finally by the Supreme Head of the State : they would be located away from the seat of war, and would function\r\nmainly in what Myers calls the metetherial environment.\r\nOn such a view evolution would consist in the gradual shifting of\r\nthe \"me as I know myself\", higher up the scale, and, if there be\r\nsurvival, this would be simply a definite step up, possibly accompanied by a shedding of some of the lowest of the subordinate\r\nmonads as being no longer required.\r\nLord Balfour warns us that difficulties arise in connection with\r\nthe problem of \" the one and the many\", and these apply with\r\nequal force to the monadic as to the stratum theory. It seems to\r\nme that the scripts themselves afford a hint of a possible solution.\r\nMrs Willett is aware of presences and of their characters, she can\r\ndistinguish between different communicators apart from any visual or auditory signs.\r\nGurney says : \"I want you to see the passage of thought, not\r\nocular or aural \" (page 93).\r\nI suggest that the knowledge acquired by telepathy and telaesthesia is sometimes of the nature of pure undifferentiated cognition, that is to say, it is neither visual, auditory, tactual, etc., but\r\nsimply direct knowledge of reality, which has to be translated into\r\nthe language of sense perception before it can be made intelligible\r\nto the supraliminal.\r\nIt may be that this is what Gurney refers to when he speaks of\r\nthe \" weaving \" process and of crystallization, and says : \" It is a dangerous weapon, yet we can't do without it \" (page 234).\r\nI gather that Lord Balfour himself takes this view, for he says on\r\npage 93 : \"I incline to the view that all visualisations of communicators, and a fortiori all fully developed hallucinatory phantasms are to be regarded as subjective constructions\u2014symbolic, it may be, of some objective reality, but still subjective constructions\r\nMaech 1936 Correspondence 199 \u2014except in so far as there is evidence for attributing to a communicator\r\na definite intention to transmit a pictorial image of himself'.\"\r\nIf this be so it appears that the cognitive faculty of some at least\r\nof the monads transcends the limitations of sensory perception, and\r\nis emancipated from the conditions of space and time as they applv\r\nto our supraliminal minds.\r\nOn page 182 occurs the following : \" And there isn't any time or\r\nplace. . . . It's like every single thing and time and thought and\r\neverything brought down to a single point \"\". In another place,\r\npage 72 :\r\n<; How nothing time is \". Now if it be possible that the categories of time and place be\r\ntranscended, it is only one step further to the transcendence of the\r\nfinal fundamental category of all. viz., that of number and sameness and difference.\r\nMyers speaks of the \" inconceivable oneness of souls\r\n: ', and longbefore him the Vedantic philosophers taught the doctrine of Maya\r\nand how the serf on attaining enlightenment learns at last the truth\r\nof the mystic phrase \" Tat tvam asi\r\n: \" \u2014Thou art That\u2014and the\r\nAtman realises its identity with Brahman (neuter).\r\nThus the difficulties concerning the one and the many may be\r\nsolved by transcending those categories. The extracts from the\r\nscripts given on pages 215-218 commencing with the words, \" The\r\none remains, the many fall and pass \" and ending \" When I am\r\neverything, you know, and everything is me \", contain abundant\r\nillustrations of this idea.\r\nThere is one further psychological point which I must mention.\r\nIn the account of the process of mutual selection given in the scripts\r\nit would seem on the face of it that the communicator holds the\r\nsomewhat naive \"storehouse \" theory of memory. I do not suppose\r\nfor a moment that the living Gurney held this view, nor, if it be\r\nreally his surviving spirit who communicates, that the words used\r\nare anything more than a colloquial fagon de parler, but the difficult\r\nquestion as to where and what are memories when they are not\r\nactually being remembered is raised in acute form.\r\nThis matter was discussed by Prof. Broad in his Presidential\r\nAddress, but, with all respect, I find myself unable to accept his\r\nproposed solution. It seems to me that any trace theory of memory\r\nwould require so complicated a set of psychological mechanisms to\r\nmake it workable, mechanisms, moreover, which have to be postulated for that sole purpose and for the existence of which there is no independent evidence, that I feel very chary of acceptance. Mr\r\nRussell's theory of mnemonic causation commends itself to me even\r\nless : it can hardly be considered a satisfactory solution of a dim-\r\n200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1936\r\nculty to invent ad hoc an entirely new mode of causation which, after\r\nall, amounts to little more than coining a fresh name for that which\r\nit is sought to explain.\r\nI should be inclined rather to seek for a solution on the lines of a transcendence of the time condition and apply this conception to\r\nthe realist theory of memory. The scripts themselves suggest this, as in the passage quoted above, \" How nothing time is \". We should then have to imagine some part of the mind, or perhaps I ought to say some superior monad, who could grasp the entire\r\npast history of the personahty in a single conspectus much in the\r\nsame way as we grasp the whole of a single specious present.\r\nI fear that this letter has attained to an unconscionable length : my only excuse must be my intense desire for further light on these\r\nmost important topics, and the feeling that were I to raise all the\r\nquestions which I should like to ask it would be at least twice as\r\nlong.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nH. F. Saltmarsh\r\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014Remarkable as the proxy case extending over eleven\r\nsittings with Mrs Osborne Leonard certainly is (Proc. Dec, 1935),\r\nI hesitate nevertheless to share the Reverend C. Drayton Thomas'\r\nconviction that Bobbie Newlove and his friends in the Beyond gave\r\nthe messages. The author seems to undervalue the possibihties of\r\nmind-reading (Gedankenlesen), especially the faculty of certain\r\nmediums to avail themselves of the unconscious of the sitter as bridge to the thoughts of distant and unknown persons (telepathie a\r\ntrois). I miss therefore the due consideration of Jack's, Bobbie's\r\nfriend's, person as source of telepathic information on the subject,\r\nand do not quite understand why Jack should be \" certainly a most\r\nunpromising and unlikely source, etc.\" (p. 502), if I were not obliged\r\nto assume a preconceived opinion of Mr Drayton Thomas. It may\r\nalso be imagined, perhaps even ascertained, that the boy spoke with\r\nother persons about the death of his friend Bobbie and mentioned\r\non this occasion that he and Bobbie had played with the water on\r\nthe Heights. Is it really out of the question that someone (for instance, a medical man) surmised thereupon, perhaps in the presence\r\nof the boy, a connexion between the two facts, although the author\r\nasserts so apodictically that no one on earth had the least suspicion\r\nthat the throat affection was traceable to the contaminated water\r\nMarch 1936 Correspondence 201\r\n(pp. 501-2 and 508) ? Likewise, I should not be so rash in affirming\r\nthat members of the \" gang \" would have no idea that Bobbie hurt\r\nhimself by playing with the water (p. 502). One could even conjecture that the suggestion, \" which had never occurred to anyone\r\n\"\r\n(p. 507) and which related to the probable cause of the child's death,\r\nemerged only in the Leonard-Feda mind.\r\nWishing to strain the telepathic hypothesis (including \" absencetelepathy \" and mind-reading) to the utmost, I should assume that\r\nBobbie's people constituted the link between medium and sitter on the one side and the persons knowing about the existence of the\r\npipes on the other side. As most of the psychical researchers believe\r\nthat the medial utterances are based upon tapping the actual or\r\nlatent thoughts of present or absent persons, I am rather astonished\r\nto read on p. 502 : \" We have no record of long and detailed messages\r\nbeing conveyed from one person to another by telepathy. Whether\r\nspontaneous or experimental, telepathy is always fragmentary.\"\r\nOr does the author strictly distinguish between telepathy in the narrower sense of the word and mind-reading ? Then he may be\r\nright. A further remark, relating to the third sitting (p. 455) : \" Sw . . . L ; these letters present an unsolved puzzle.\" Could not\r\nthey mean : Swamp-land 1 I surely do not deny that the spiritualistic interpretation of this\r\nhighly interesting and striking case seems the most obvious and\r\nsimple, but the most simple explanation is not always the right one ; truth is very often not simple.\u2014I beg to be excused for my bad\r\nEnglish : I hope you will find, however, what I intended to say.\r\nBelieve me,\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nBaron Alfred de Winterstein\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam.\u2014Dr Baron Alfred von Winterstein rightly points out that\r\nI place little value on the hypothesis of mind-reading, especially as applied to cases where the persons, whose minds or memories are supposed to be tapped, were distant and unknown to the medium.\r\nOne does not deny the possibility, but I am unable to recall creditably recorded instances where the information produced was demonstrably by that method and by no other method.\r\nIs there on record any case where a medium's excursive activity can be shown to have obtained information comparable in accuracy\r\nand amount to that found in the Newlove case ? Should it be shown that some mediums can tap a sitter's memories,\r\n202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1936\r\nit would yet remain to be proved that the same thing could be done\r\nwith the memory of a distant person who was unknown to the\r\nmedium.\r\nI am the more inclined to disregard the hypothetical action of\r\ndistant telepathy in the Newlove case because I have repeatedly\r\nobserved instances where information was given by a medium under\r\nconditions precluding telepathy from any minds on earth. One\r\ncannot enlarge on this in a letter, but I would refer to my publications, Some New Evidence for Human Survival (especially Part II)\r\nand Life Beyond Death with Evidence (chapters xi and xiii).\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nC. Drayton Thomas\r\n[Regarding Mr Drayton Thomas's remark, \" Should it be shown\r\nthat some mediums can tap a sitter's memories,\" there can be little doubt that all mediums do this, and to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nHon.\r\nEd.]\r\nThe Mediumship of Mirabelli\r\n{Translation)\r\nTo the Hon. Editor\r\nMadam,\u2014The rather mild judgment of Mr Besterman (who is such an experienced expert) concerning Mirabelli's metapsychic performances, may very well be based upon tactical considerations. Mr\r\nBesterman knows that demonstration sittings cannot prove much,\r\nsince he can have no influence upon the method followed. Perhaps\r\nhe wants, by means of a very little praise, to pave the way for later,\r\nlaboratory, sittings, which up to the present have not been obtainable.\r\nOn the other hand Mr Besterman's complete refusal of Mirabelli's \" scripts \" is to be wholly approved. \" William Crookes \" can't\r\nspell his own name correctly ! It is just as bad with \" Cesar Lombroso.\" whose name the \" Academia de Estudios Psychicos \" has even added to its list, and who has authorized the publication of the\r\nMirabelli scripts. Now, Lombroso was a Jew. But he makes\r\nMirabelli write automatically : \" Jesus hear and help you,\" etc. It would appear that on the other side not only can one have lessons\r\nin various languages, but also one can change one's beliefs.\r\nA similar case of post mortem change of belief I wrote about in the\r\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie of Nov. 1931 (\" Sensitive or Medium \").\r\nThe American spiritist M. Arthur Ford, had given, in a private\r\nsitting in Berlin (April 27, 1928), a communication to a sitter from\r\nhis mother, and she expressly revealed herself as a very pious\r\nMarch 1936 Correspondence 203\r\nChristian and concluded each sitting with a spiritist propaganda\r\nspeech. But she was, as can be proved, a Jewess.\r\nSuch spiritistic absurdities as this have apparently been frequently\r\nproduced, but they can't always have been so well established as in\r\nthose two analogous cases\u2014that of Mirabelli and that of Ford.\r\nYours very truly,\r\n(Dr) Carl Bruck\r\nREVIEW.\r\nPierre-Emile Cornillier, The Prediction of the Future.

This is the first number of a series of bulletins to be published in\r\ncollaboration with the American Psychical Institute of New York.\r\nIt contains a useful list of references to published accounts of queer\r\nhappenings which have been attributed to Poltergeist manifestations. The fist, which extends from a.d. 530 to the present day,\r\nhas been compiled by Dr Hereward Carrington.\r\nIn an introduction, Dr Carrington expresses surprise at the\r\ncautious attitude towards accepting these phenomena which is adopted by some students, and states emphatically his personal\r\nopinion that they are often genuine. He goes on to describe the\r\nadventures which befell the Rev. Dr Eliakim Phelps, of Stratford.\r\nConnecticut, in 1850 and 1851. His account of this famous case is an\r\ninteresting one ; but it seems a pity to introduce into a quasiscientific publication the footnote which appears on page 8. In this,\r\nthe author adduces Dr Phelps' family motto\r\n\r\nVeritas sine Timors\u2014\r\nas evidence of his credibility.\r\nThe rest of the bulletin contains a note by Dr Nandor Fodor on a supposed psychic manifestation in Spain which occurred in 1934.\r\n204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1936\r\nThe bulletin is excellently printed, but it would be an advantage,\r\nfor purposes of reference, if the date of publication were added to\r\nsubsequent numbers.\r\nInternational Institute for Psychical Research, Bulletin II. This contains an account, written by Dr Fodor, of a series of\r\nsittings with the medium Lajos Pap held at the Institute. It is illustrated with diagrams and photographs. A large number of\r\n\"phenomena\" were observed, mostly \" apports \". The author\r\nconcludes that \" none of the phenomena . . . can be considered\r\nsupernormal ; some of them were definitely fraudulent, others\r\nhighly suspicious \".

Strutt, to make his financial statement.\r\n208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1936\r\nAdmiral Strutt, in presenting the accounts for the year, said that\r\nat first sight the Society appeared to have paid its way, seeing that\r\nit started the year with a nominal balance of \u00a339 15s. 4d., and ended\r\nit with one of \u00a394 14s. 3d. But this was not the case, because it had\r\nreceived \u00a3350 on the sale of certain holdings of stock, and had\r\nre-invested only \u00a3250. The balance of \u00a3100 had not been re-invested\r\nin view of the dilapidations with which the Society was faced on the\r\nsurrender of the lease ; these however had not yet been carried out\r\nor paid for. The rent, hitherto \u00a3175, had been raised to \u00a3240, and\r\nwith this increase of expenditure there was a continual tendency\r\ntowards a decrease of income, caused by the conversions of the\r\nSociety's holdings to a lower rate of interest. The acquisition of\r\nnew members was the most obvious method of increasing income,\r\nand he hoped that existing members would do all they could to\r\npersuade new members to join and so help the Society.\r\nThe President then invited questions on the Financial Statement\r\nand Annual Report. Dr Dingwall congratulated the Council on\r\ngiving grants for particular pieces of work done by members, which\r\nhe said was a much better policy than a heavy expenditure on\r\nphysical mediums. He hoped they would continue on these lines. The Hon. Secretary, Mr W. H. Salter, thanked Dr Dingwall for\r\nhis remarks, with which he was in general agreement. The Council\r\ncould not however give an absolute pledge not to pursue any particular line of research. As regards dilapidations, Mr Salter mentioned\r\nthat several years ago the Society had put by \u00a3150 out of income\r\ntowards the liability for dilapidations.\r\nThe President said that, before putting the Report to the vote,\r\nhe would like to inform the Society that the Council was preparing\r\nshortly to make an appeal for funds to the public. He hoped that\r\nby that means the Society might get money, not only for income\r\nbut possibly endowment, and the appeal might also result in an\r\nincrease of members. He referred to the public interest aroused by\r\nthe broadcast talks in 1934 and to the more recent articles in The\r\nSpectator by various members of the Society. He had heard from\r\nvarious booksellers that they had enquiries asking for the Proceedings, and he noticed that there had been a considerable increase in\r\nthe Society's sale of publications last year.\r\nThe President then moved that the Report and Financial Statement be adopted, and the resolution was carried unanimously.\r\nThe President announced that there were no candidates for\r\nelection to membership of the Council other than the six members\r\nwho retired by rotation, and he accordingly declared the following\r\nsix members re-elected : The Rt. Hon. The Earl of Balfour, Sir\r\nApril 1936 Annual General Meeting 209\r\nErnest Bennett, M.P., Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., Sir Oliver Lodge,\r\nF.R.S., Professor W. McDougall, F.R.S., and Mr S. G. Soal.\r\nMessrs. Hartleys, Wilkins, Avery & Flew were re-elected Auditors\r\nfor the forthcoming year.\r\nBefore closing the meeting, the President spoke of the very\r\nserious loss that the Society had sustained through the deaths of\r\nMrs Sidgwick and the Hon. Everard Fending. It was hardly\r\nnecessary, he thought, to say much about Mrs Sidgwick, one of the\r\noldest members and one of the founders of the Society. Any one who had read the Proceedings from the beginning would know the\r\nadmirable and first-rate work she did. She had a most extraordinary\r\ncombination of qualities : a balance of judgment, neither going to an excess of scepticism on the one hand, nor superstition on the\r\nother, invaluable qualities which were extremely necessary in\r\npsychical research. While it was unnecessary to praise the various\r\nreports she had written in many volumes of Proceedings, he might\r\nmention that he had been particularly struck in re-reading, shortly\r\nbefore her death, her examination of cases of telepathy : \" Phantasms of the Living \", in Proceedings, Vol. XXXIII.\r\nThe President spoke also of the valuable work done for the\r\nSociety by Mr Feilding. He asked the members present to stand,\r\nto show their deep sympathy with Lord Balfour and the other\r\nmembers of Mrs Sidgwick's family, and with Mrs Feilding.\r\nAfter the Annual General Meeting, Mr C. V. C. Herbert gave an account of his \"\" Experiences with Continental Mediums last Autumn \". The President was in the Chair.\r\nThis will be printed later.\r\nCASE\r\nL. 1307 Intimation of Father's Illness\r\nThe following letter from Mrs Shortreed, addressed to the Secretary\r\nof the Society, was handed to Mr Herbert on 17th December, 1935 : \" I had occasion to look for a book on telepathy at our public\r\nlibrary here and chose this one : Evidencefor Telepathy, by Mrs W.

I sat tense, waiting on the telephone to ring. Until 1 o'clock, I turned\r\nover in my mind over and over again, sitting up in bed, then rising,\r\nalmost 'phoning for a taxi ; but at last I decided against this, as I might disturb my parents needlessly, if they were all right. I told\r\nmy sleeping daughter, who mumbled incoherently that I should go\r\nto sleep. Next morning at breakfast I told the family of my premonition (for such it proved). My husband said I was worrying needlessly:\r\nhowever, I determined to send my daughter down to investigate.\r\nWe had hardly finished breakfast when the telephone did ring with a\r\nbrief message :\r\n' Would Nan come down at once ?\r\n' I knew it. I dressed in two seconds, meanwhile 'phoning for a taxi, and was with\r\nmy father almost continuously until he died on Thursday, December\r\n5th.\" When I told Mother, this was her story : On Tuesday night at\r\n12 o'clock, Dad suddenly took a turn for the worse, and got out of\r\nbed, gasping for breath. Mother kept saying until 1 o'clock :\r\n' Will\r\nI send for Willie ?\r\n' (My husband, in whom Mother has great faith,\r\nand of whom she is very fond.) \" Was my Dad, who adores me, asking in his own mind for me, or probably concentrating on me ? When I told him that we would\r\nsleep at their house alternately, Dad only weakly said : ' I'd rather\r\nhave you, Nan.' But poor Daddy did not require me any more.\r\n(Signed) Nan Shortreed.\"\r\nMrs Shortreed's mother, Mrs Legge, writes as follows : \" My husband, who was very ill on Tuesday the 3rd of December\r\nwith heart trouble, took a bad turn during the night, and was unable to sleep or he in bed. I, being alone in the house, got very\r\nalarmed, and wondered if I ought to send for my daughter. As a matter of fact I was j ust on the verge of going out to 'phone for her,\r\nand yet was afraid of leaving my husband alone ; so just carried on\r\ntill the forenoon, when I got a friend to 'phone, and my daughter\r\narrived almost at once in a taxi. I wondered how she managed so\r\nquickly. When she told me of her experience during the night and\r\nwas sure she was needed, which had she not told her own family, I could hardly credit it. \" I omitted to say that the time I was anxious about my husband\r\nwas between 12 and 1 o'clock, between Tuesday and Wednesday.\r\n\" (Signed) Annie Legge.\"\r\nThe following is a copy of a letter received from Mrs Shortreed's\r\ndaughter, aged 15 : \" I have read your letter to Mrs Shortreed, and am now answering\r\nmy part of it.\r\n212 J'oumal of Society for Psychical Research April 1936\r\n\" On the night of December 3rd, I was awakened by Mother (we were sleeping together that night), who said : ' My mother wants me,\r\nAnne ! ' I knew that lately Mother had been worrying about her\r\nfather's illness, and, as I was only half awake, I said : ' Oh ! lie down and don't worry, Mummy ! ' After which I knew no more.\r\n\" Next morning at breakfast table, Mummy explained to the\r\nfamily her ' midnight experience.' ' At about 12 o'clock I awoke,\r\nwith the feeling that my mother was calling me, I determined I would\r\nget up and 'phone for a taxi,' she said. ' I sat up on the edge of my\r\nbed, and thought : now, if I 'phone, they will think I am worrying,\r\nwhich will naturally worry them all the more. No ! I'll lie down ; they might 'phone ! At about 1 o'clock,' Mother said, ' the feeling\r\nleft me.'\r\n\" Mother then said :\r\n' Now I'm waiting for a 'phone-call, I'm sure\r\nit'll come.' Sure enough ! at about 10 o'clock the telephone rang,\r\nand Mother was called down to Leith ; her father having had a very\r\nbad ' turn ' between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock. \" (Signed) Anne Shortreed.\"\r\nMr William Shortreed, P.A.S.I., has sent a statement, as follows : \" 23 Duke Street,\r\nEdinburgh, 17th January, 1936.\r\n\" I beg to confirm the statement made by my wife. At 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning, 4th December, 1935, while we were at breakfast, my wife mentioned that she had been very much disturbed\r\nduring the night and early morning by a presentiment that all was\r\npot well with her father. She stated that she had a feeling that her\r\nbarents wanted her during the night, 12 p.m. to 1 o'clock, and had\r\nneen on the point of arousing me to call a taxi for her to go to them.\r\n\" I left town for a few hours on business, and when I returned\r\nabout 1 p.m., my daughter informed me her mother had received a\r\ntelephone call at 10 a.m. to go to her parents, and that she was still there. Her father died the following day.\r\n\" (Signed) Wm. Shortreed.\"'\r\nIn a letter to Mrs Shortreed, Mr Herbert asked her if she had\r\never had similar experiences. She answers : \"... I cannot say I have had another such experience, except on one or two occasions I have felt uneasy about something, or have had the common vivid\r\ndream, which I have not been able to connect up, as in my father's\r\nillness. My daughter and I often say things, or sing a song spontaneously, using the same words, tone, etc.\"\r\nThe weak point of the case, of course, is that Mrs Shortreed knew\r\nthat her father was seriously ill, though she had no reason to be\r\nApril 1936 Case 21.3\r\nacutely anxious about him at the time of her premonition. The\r\ncoincidence of the times, i.e. that Mrs Shortreed woke precisely at\r\nmidnight, and that her uneasiness remained with her until 1 o'clock,\r\nwhereas Mrs Legge tells us that her anxiety was also between twelve\r\nand one, is certainly very striking.\r\nThe case is strengthened by the fact that the percipient has had\r\nno other experience of a similar nature.\r\nCASE.\r\nL. 1308 Retrocognitive Clairvoyance or Deferred\r\nTelepathic Impression in Dream.\r\nThis case was sent to Mr Saltmarsh as a result of his letter in\r\nThe Spectator of 17 January, 1936.\r\nMrs Samson writes as follows : \" Ayres End, Kersey, Hadleigh, Suffolk, 17 January, 1936.\r\n\" I was staying in Torquay in May, 1917, when a telegram came\r\nfrom the War Office stating that my step-son, Capt. H. W. Samson,\r\nRoyal Scots, was missing. He had been in the attack on 3rd of May,\r\nand out of his company all the officers, and nearly all the men, were\r\ngone. The next day after receiving the telegram (13th May) I dreamt that I was standing in a rather small room in a strange\r\ncountry. I saw ' H ' lying on a couch, his face and uniform covered\r\nwith mud, face drained of every drop of blood, the neck of the tunic\r\nopen and the chest exposed. Over him were bending two nuns ; one was dressed in black\u2014a stout elderly woman\u2014the other was\r\nyoung and in a white habit. The older woman lifted his head.\r\nHe was quite unconscious, but I knew he was alive. I stood about\r\ntwo yards away from him, but I could not move a finger to help him,\r\nand I felt so grateful that the two nuns were kind and even solicitous\r\nabout him.\r\n\" He was missing for eight weeks, and then we received a letter\r\nfrom him from a German hospital. He had been wounded and\r\ntaken prisoner. I wrote and told him about my dream and that it had comforted us and given us hope when every one in Command\r\nhad reported him as ' killed '. But I said ' How silly to think of nuns nursing soldiers in Germany ; it would be much more likely\r\nto be a male attendant smoking a cigarette ! ' I did not get his reply\r\nuntil October.\"\r\nExtract from letter from Captain H. W. Samson, Royal Scots, to\r\nMr and Mrs Samson. Dated 1917, September 20 : \" That was an extraordinary dream you had, Jessie : for, about\r\nthat time I was in hospital at Aix la Chapelle in a lazaretto, which\r\n214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1936\r\nwas looked after by nuns. One of them, Sister Benedicta was the\r\nhead nun and was dressed in black, while there were a few novices\r\ndressed in white. There was a couch in the room, but I hadn't any\r\nuniform on then and probably I was rather muddy and covered with\r\nblood as it was only there that I began to get attention. I have\r\npromised to go back and see them after the war is finished.\"\r\nMrs Samson adds : \" The curious part is that he received this first attention on the\r\n6th May, yet I did not dream the dream until the 13th May. Also\r\nI knew I was in a foreign country, so that the usual explanation of\r\nthe unconscious person sending a message which is received by\r\nsomeone en rapport does not fit this case. He is not imaginative\r\nand I never had any supernormal experience before or since.\"\r\nThe original letter from Captain Samson was sent to the S.P.R.\r\nIt may be objected that the case is very much weakened by there\r\nbeing no contemporary record of Mrs Samson's dream. After nearly\r\nnineteen years, her memory of the dream may have altered very\r\nconsiderably in the direction of increased coincidence between the\r\ndream and the reality. But against this it may be evidenced that\r\nthe letter from Captain Samson, which is a contemporary document,\r\nis itself strong corroboration of the truth of the account of the dream.\r\nUnless the dream were substantially as stated, Captain Samson's\r\nremarks are unintelligible. The attention of readers is directed\r\ntowards this point, and they are left to form their own estimate of\r\nthe evidential value of the case.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nThe Scarcity of Spontaneous Cases\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014As a somewhat close student of Psychic Research for\r\nsome thirty years and as an Associate of the S.P.R. (all but a short\r\ninterval) for not far off that time, may I be allowed to echo very\r\nheartily the letter of Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, dated 29\r\nJune 1935, and appearing in the Journal for January of this year.\r\nThe late Professor Flammarion as evidenced by his more recent\r\nbooks, Death and Its Mystery (3 vols.), and also in his Haunted\r\nHouses, seemed to have had very little, if any, real use for mediumistic (induced or experimental) Phenomena, and I think the same\r\ncould be said of the late Andrew Lang, another of our former\r\nPresidents.\r\nMany years ago Professor F. S. C. Schiller referred at one of the\r\nS.P.R. meetings to the fact that logical, as opposed to mathematical.\r\nApeil 1936 Correspondence 215\r\nproof is cumulative rather than inductive, i.e. like a rope with manystrands of fibre instead of being like the chain of mathematical\r\nproof which is \" no stronger than its weakest link \".\r\nIt is this cumulative proof which Professor Flammarion appears\r\nto have relied upon and it has always seemed to me that if one has\r\na mind logical enough to digest a very large number of well-attested\r\nfacts, the result is more satisfactory than instances of mediumistic\r\nPhenomena which may be in perhaps the majority of cases explicable by a number of alternative hypotheses.\r\nIn my own life-time I have personally become aware of several\r\ncases at least equal if not superior as a matter of evidence to the\r\nelusive \" Morton Case \" set out in Myers' Human Personality.\r\nand elsewhere in literature and indeed it appears to me that the\r\nS.P.R. have never (unless at the time of its \" Census \" of some forty\r\nyears ago), got hold of a tenth part of the really strong cases that\r\nhave occurred.\r\nMost people have seemed rather afraid of the S.P.R. and fail to\r\nsend up cases. Moreover, there has been of late years a tendency\r\nalmost to confine the work to very lengthy matters which are beyond the intellect or the patience of most ordinarily educated\r\npeople. Yours, etc.,\r\nGuy Heaton (M.A. Oxon.)\r\nThe Proxy Sittings\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I venture to suggest that it might be wise to\r\nsuspend judgment on the value and meaning of the proxy sittings\r\nuntil further investigations are carried out 1 From what I can\r\ngather it would seem that the majority of inquirers are of the\r\nopinion that these sittings show at least evidence of \" telepathy \"\r\n; and some of them {e.g. Mr Drayton Thomas) believe that they\r\nfurnish good evidence of \" survival \".\r\nI have recently made a very careful study of the Newlove Case\r\nand have just finished Through a Stranger s Hands. In both these\r\npublications I find little evidence of anything \" supernormal\r\n\r\nwhatever. Verification varies with the ingenuity of the annotator ; and it is of great interest to note with what efforts and with what\r\nsuccess the Control makes use of the little information given by the\r\nsitters. In this respect the transformation of the drains to the pipes\r\nthrough the kind assistance of Mr Thomas will, I think, remain a\r\nclassic instance of a principle which, I suspect, runs all through the\r\nmental phenomena, namely that it is the sitter who produces the\r\nresults, not the medium. I am, etc., E. J. Dingwall.\r\n216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1936\r\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam \u2014After reading Mr J. Cecil Maby's \" Further Note \",\r\nconcerning Mr Whately Carington's \" Quantitative Study of\r\nTrance Personalities \", in the Proceedings of December, I too am\r\ntempted to raise a question as to Mr Carington's procedure of\r\ncollecting the data for his experiments. My question concerns the\r\nlaboratory conditions under which Mrs Eileen Garrett was tested by\r\nMr Theodore Besterman in the S.P.R. for Mr Whately Carington's\r\nreport.\r\nI happened to be in London the summer of 1933 when these tests were being made. I heard at that time from Mrs Garrett, that Mr\r\nBesterman usually worked alone, with the exception of a few occasions when his wife was present. This meant that Mr Besterman,\r\nsingle-handed, undertook to be the recorder in these experiments of\r\npsychogalvanic reflexes, word association reactions, etc., while\r\nsimultaneously manipulating a galvanometer and a stop watch.\r\nWhile these experiments were being made, Mr Besterman told\r\nMrs Garrett and Dr William Brown and myself, at different intervals\r\nof time, that the results of Mrs Garrett's tests with the psychogalvanic reflexes were largely negative. And Mr Carington, in his \" Quantitative Study \", Part I, p. 184, refers to these tests in no\r\nuncertain terms, saying, \" Mrs Garrett proved to be by far the worst\r\nsubject for the psychogalvanic reflex that I have ever worked with,\r\nwhile Uvani was little better if at all.\" As concerns this record\r\nmaterial, Mrs Garrett states she did not work with Mr Whately\r\nCarington directly at any time.\r\nI should like to report in relation to Mrs Garrett's reactions to\r\nthe psychogalvanic tests with both Mr Hereward Carrington and\r\nMr Besterman, that she distinctly remembers that in both experiments when the galvanometer failed, there was no observer or technician available to restore it to working order, and no new\r\ngalvanometers were brought in to replace the imperfect machines\r\nin either experiment. And there was no attempt made, on either\r\noccasion, to ask her for more of her time, in order to make the\r\nabsolute rechecking of these failures.\r\nAs far as we can gather, therefore, the material collected under\r\nsuch conditions in both experiments was used in the construction\r\nof Mr Whately Carington's and Mr Hereward Carrington's records.\r\nWas it, then, due to lack of a functioning galvanometer, or was it due to lack of Mrs Garrett's responses that negative psychogalvanic\r\nreflexes were produced I On this point she herself has always been\r\nin conflict.\r\nApril 1936 Correspondence 217\r\nNo such difficulty in the recording of psychogalvanic reflexes has\r\nhowever appeared during her later work with trained medical men\r\nand technicians in London and New York. In Mrs Garrett's work\r\nwith Dr William Brown in 1934, the recording of these reflexes went\r\nquite smoothly. In this research, Mr E. J. Bartlett, M.Sc, manipulated the psychogalvanic apparatus for Dr Brown. (See \" Sleep.\r\nHypnosis and Mediumistic Trance \", by Dr William Brown, Character and Personality, Dec. 1934.)\r\nSimilarly, there has been no clifficulty in the psychogalvanic re- cordings of Mrs Garrett in the second experiment, now being con- ducted in New York, under the direction of several prominent\r\nmedical men, assisted by a trained technician and a recorder. In\r\nthis case, the psychogalvanic reflexes not only of Mrs Garrett and\r\nher control, Uvani, but of a secondary control, Abdul Latif, as well,\r\nhave been successfully recorded. This new research bids fair to be\r\nof great importance in the study of mediumship, as it includes a thorough physiological examination of not only Mrs Garrett in her\r\nnormal waking state, but also of Uvani and Abdul in her trance\r\nstate. All three of these personalities are being checked as to pulse,\r\nrespiration, blood-pressure, blood counts, blood-chemistry, and\r\ntypical drug responses. Perhaps most interesting of all the tests are the series of basal metabolisms and cardiograph records of Mrs\r\nGarrett and the two controls.\r\nWould the results of these later researches not lead us to believe\r\nthat the fault lies not so much in Mrs Garrett's negativity as in the\r\nlack of observation and training in those who conducted the earlier\r\nexperiments ? And how might this affect the conclusions of Mr\r\nWhately Carington's report ? Why, also, did Mr Carington eliminate from his own Word Test,\r\nin his experiments with the trance personalities, twenty of the\r\noriginal words in Jung's Word Association list ? He says, \" the reason for doing this (deleting the twenty words), in the first instance,\r\nwas that I feared lest the inclusion of many words of great common\r\ninterest\u2014such as those bearing on erotic life and the like\u2014might\r\nobscure individual differences in respect of other matters.\"\r\nWhat individual differences could be of greater significance than\r\nthose \" concerning erotic life and the like \" ? The use, then, of these\r\nWord Association Tests, seems to me to become of doubtful value\r\nwhen all the key words that deal with the repressions of the unconscious are eliminated. Do we know yet to what extent the unconscious or subconscious of a medium and trance personality are\r\nsimilar ? And what could be of more vital importance to study ? If Mr Carington has some unpublished data on this subject, perhaps\r\n218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1936\r\nat some later date he might share it with us and so permit us to\r\nknow his reasons for excluding these twenty words from his own\r\nWord Association Tests.\r\nThese tests were developed originally by the psycho-analysts to uncover the buried complexes of which the individual tested was\r\nhimself unaware. But in Mr Carington's experiments, with the\r\nconstant repetition of these lists of words to the normal waking\r\npersonality of the medium and to the trance personalities, the effect\r\nof the stimulus words must surely die down. This then raises the\r\nquestion of the ultimate value of such reaction responses, when re- peated so often in close succession.\r\nTo clarify my point, I would note that Mrs Garrett told me that,\r\nsubconsciously, the original words and their reaction responses, in\r\nthese Word Association Tests, became to her, after numerous repetitions, quite mechanical and perhaps subconsciously memorised.\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n(Miss) Margaret Naumburg.\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I venture to offer my opinion on the Oriental flavour\r\nof Feda's word-association responses ; my qualifications for so doing\r\nare that I have lived in Delhi as a missionary for twenty-four years,\r\nhave a good knowledge of Hindustani, and friendships and acquaint- ances among both Hindus and Musalmans of various social classes.\r\nIn the list given in Proceedings 141, p. 374, and in the notes\r\nthereon on the following pages, I note the following words :\r\n(1) Quite impossible for an Indian living near Simla 130 years\r\nago\r\n\r\nSamisen, amah, yashmak. Note that in the case of yashmak,\r\nnot only would the word be unknown, but the thing ; Musahnan\r\nwomen in North India never wear a veil of any sort, but a garment\r\n(the burqa) that covers the whole figure. The responses are as impossible for the character claimed as they would be, say, for the\r\ndaughter of a Scotch laird of the same period.\r\n(2) Very unlikely for the person and period :\r\n(a) Curry.\u2014To an Indian, curry is not a meal or a dish, but a relish\r\nadded to the staple dish of wheat cakes or of boiled rice. The re- action to \" make \", \" cook \" or \" eat \" would therefore be some\r\nphrase such as \" curry and rice \", never \" curry \" alone, as it can be to an Anglo-Indian or one who has merely read about India.\r\n(b) Sari for \" make \".\u2014No Indian woman makes a sari, as she\r\nmay make some other pieces of dress ; it is simply a piece of woven\r\ncloth or silk which is bought.\r\nApril 1936 Correspondence 219\r\n(c) Mission, missionary.\u2014In about 1800, when there were only one or two missionaries in the whole of North India (Carey in\r\nBengal, 1000 miles from Simla), it is almost impossible that any\r\nIndian near Simla should have ever heard of such a person.\r\n{d) Elephants (wild, shoot).\u2014I do not think that there would be\r\nany wild elephants anywhere near Simla, nor would shooting\r\nelephants be a sport even of noble or royal Indians.\r\n(e) Tablets.\u2014I know of no evidence of the use of tablets for writing\r\nin India as late as 1800 ; paper had been regularly used for several\r\ncenturies.\r\n( \/ ) BurmaJi.\u2014Very unlikely to have been heard of by an Indian\r\nat the place and time claimed.\r\n(g) mango (hot).\u2014I find it difficult to conceive of any Indian\r\nhaving this association.

Societe des Recherehes\r\nPsychiques Hellenique, Rue Aristotelous, 67, Athenes, Grece.\r\nPrice : 15 francs francais, 100 drachmes.\r\nThis book, by the president of the Greek Psychical Research\r\nSociety, is chiefly concerned with the author's \" Theorie de la Psychobolie \". This theory postulates that energy, resulting from\r\ndisturbances in the unconscious mind, is capable, in certain individuals, of exteriorisation ; where it manifests itself by reacting\r\nwith inanimate objects (telekinesis), with another human mind\r\n(telepathic suggestion), or with the tissues of living organisms (the \" evil eye \", etc.).\r\nAfter a preliminary chapter on causation, Dr Tanagras reviews\r\nthe question of precognition, and its reconciliation with an undetermined future, supporting his arguments with several interesting\r\ncases. He next considers telekinetic phenomena, citing Osty's work\r\nwith Rudi Schneider, and quoting various cases both from his own\r\n220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1936\r\ncountry and elsewhere. He then deals with telepathic suggestion,\r\nand with the action of his psychobolic influence on plants and\r\nanimals. The first part of the book ends with a chapter on the\r\ntendency for unconscious impulses to obtain realisation, this\r\ntendency being the driving force behind the psychobolic influence.\r\nThe second part of the book is chiefly concerned with chance and\r\nits relation with his psychobolic theory, the author touching, in the\r\nfinal chapters, on the moral and philosophical aspects of the subject.\r\nThe book ends with a resume of the theory, in German, taken from an article by Professor Schroeder in the Zeitschrift fur Metapsychische Vorschung for April 1934.\r\nAlthough many people will not be convinced by Dr Tanagras\"\r\ntheory, few will deny the skill with which the author marshals his\r\nmaterial in support of his views. In all, he cites 101 cases, many of\r\nwhich are of considerable interest. Dr Tanagras must be congratulated on a painstaking, if not completely successful, attempt to find a theory universally applicable to all psychic manifestations.\r\nC. V. C.

Herbert\r\nIn the autumn of last year, owing to the kindness of a member of\r\nthe Society who prefers to remain anonymous, I was able to go to\r\nAustria and Poland to sit with well-known mediums. The sittings were informal, and I was present as a private individual, not as a\r\nrepresentative of the Society.\r\nI went first to Weyer, in Austria, where I joined three other\r\nmembers of the Society, Miss Reutiner, Lord Charles Hope, and Mr\r\nEvelyn. Weyer is a small town in the lower Alps, not far from\r\nVienna, and for some time past has been the home of Rudi Schneider.\r\nI stayed in Weyer for nine days, and had no less than fourteen\r\nsittings with this medium.\r\nRudi Schneider had a flat in the house of a Herr and Frau Schickl,\r\nand was accompanied by his wife and mother. Herr Schickl is a timber merchant in Weyer, and both he and his wife are confirmed\r\nspiritualists. The sittings were held in a basement room in Herr\r\nSchickl's house. The room was unfurnished and made an excellent seance room. For some time, Herr Schickl had been experimenting\r\nwith an elaborate apparatus, said to have been constructed from\r\ndirections given by Rudi Schneider's control personality, whom we\r\ncall Rudi-Olga. The purpose of the apparatus was to obtain photographs of a paranormal nature, and we were assured that one had\r\nactually been produced bearing a portrait of the late Baron von\r\nSchrenck Notzing. Unfortunately Rudi-Olga had given orders that\r\nthis photograph should be destroyed, so we were unable to examine\r\nit. Many other photographs were shown to me, bearing more or less distinct images of an indefinite character. One, the Schickls\r\nthought, was like a human face ; but I was not able to make this\r\n1 Containing the substance of a talk by Mr Herbert at the Annual General\r\nMeeting of the Society on 26th February 1936.\r\nMay 1936 Some Recent Sittings with Continental Mediums 223\r\nout. They also showed me the apparatus with which the photographs were said to have been produced. It seemed to me to be a very fantastic affair, and I do not think it worth my time to describe\r\nit to you now.\r\nI attended one sitting at which the apparatus was used, and\r\nthrough the kindness of Herr Schickl was allowed to fix up a camera\r\nalongside the camera that formed the central feature of the apparatus ; so that anything appearing on their plate ought to have\r\nappeared also on mine. During the taking of the picture, which was\r\ndone in complete darkness, Rudi Schneider was not in trance. He\r\nand the rest of the sitters grouped themselves round the apparatus,\r\nwhich reached to the ceiling, and led by Frau Schickl they all sang\r\nor rather shouted in chorus, producing the most incredible pandemonium that I have ever heard in a seance room. I placed myself on a window ledge, overlooking the apparatus, in such a position\r\nthat I was satisfied that no attempt was made to affect the cameras by means of a normal light (an electric torch, etc.). I had invited\r\nfraud by fixing up my camera some time beforehand, and leaving\r\nit unattended with a film in position. But before the actual sitting\r\nbegan, I had removed the film, unknown to anybody, and replaced\r\nit by another. Thus, if the film had been tampered with, the\r\n\" psychic \" picture would have come out on the wrong negative.\r\nBoth films were brought back to England and carefully developed\r\nby me. Both were absolutely blank. The plate from Herr Schickl's camera was developed directly after the sitting, and showed a very\r\nfaint marking, attributed by the Schickls to supernatural forces. In\r\nmy opinion the marking was due solely to unskilful development,\r\nand possibly also to the plate being stale. The same causes would\r\nalso account for most of the images on other plates that they had\r\ngot, always excepting the Baron's portrait, which, as I have said, had\r\nbeen regrettably destroyed. The Schickls are still continuing their\r\nexperiments without Rudi Schneider, and are getting similar results ; so there is little reason to believe that Schneider had much to do\r\nwith it. Of the remaining thirteen sittings, nine were for the usual telekinetic phenomena, and the rest for interrogating Rudi-Olga, collecting\r\nthe \" power \", etc. At six of the nine telekinetic sittings movements\r\nof objects were recorded by one or more sitters, and at three of them\r\nI am convinced that actual movements did take place. These three were the evening sittings of October 6th, October 7th, and October\r\n8th. At each of these, movements took place when I was controlling the medium myself.\r\nI think that a few words on the actual method of control used\r\n224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1936\r\nwould not be out of place here. The controller sits opposite Schneider and places his two feet against the legs of Schneider's chair.\r\nHe holds the medium's two wrists, one in each hand. The second\r\ncontroller sits on the controller's left, and holds Schneider's right\r\narm with his right hand, the second controller's left hand being\r\nheld by the first of the sitters, all of whom join hands. These positions are taken up before the lights go out. It has been suggested\r\nthat Rudi Schneider is able to free a hand during a sitting without\r\nthe knowledge of the controller. This seems to me to be absolutely\r\nimpossible. Unless the controller were himself in trance, he would\r\nbe bound to know the very instant that Schneider got free. I am\r\nprepared to say without the slightest hesitation that during the\r\nwhole time that I was controlling neither of the medium's hands was ever free. As regards the medium's feet, the position of the\r\ncontroller's legs, pressed against the medium's chair, makes it impossible for him to free these without instantly being detected.\r\nThe medium's hands and feet are thus perfectly under control, nor do I consider that he could have produced the movements that\r\nwe saw by any other normal means. I am quite satisfied that he\r\nhad nothing in the nature of an extensible rod, held in his teeth ; and\r\nthat he could not have produced the movements by moving his body.\r\nIn fact, during some of the best movements he was completely\r\nmotionless, with his head down on my knees.\r\nI have here the actual notes of the three sittings in question. They\r\nwere written down by me directly after each section, and as they\r\nare quite short I will read them to you now.\r\n1935, October 6th. Evening.\r\n1st Section : hrs. 20.15 to Irs. 21.27.\r\nOrder : Rudi Schneider, C.V.C.H. (controller), Frau Schwaiger\r\n(2nd controller), Professor Schwaiger, Miss Reutiner, Lord Charles\r\nHope, Herr Kostersitz.\r\nSeveral curtain movements were reported, one of which I am\r\nquite certain was real, and which I am convinced could not have been\r\ndone normally by Rudi Schneider. There was also a movement of\r\nthe red lamp, reported by Lord Charles Hope, which was disclaimed\r\nby Rudi-Olga.\r\n2nd Section : hrs. 21.45 to hrs. 22.33.\r\nSame order.\r\nNo phenomenon was reported.\r\nRudi-Olga asked for a change of controller.\r\n3rd Section : hrs. 22.47 to hrs. 23.38.\r\nOrder : Rudi Schneider, Professor Schwaiger (controller), Frau\r\nMay 1936 Some Recent Sittings with Continental Mediums 225\r\nSchwaiger (2nd controller), Lord Charles Hope, Miss Reutiner,\r\nC.V.C.H., Herr Kostersitz.\r\nNo phenomena were reported.\r\nNote on this sitting.\r\nDuring the interval after the first section, I examined the inside\r\nof the \" cabinet \" with an electric torch, and found nothing suspicious. At the time that the curtain movement, that I saw, took\r\nplace, I had perfect control of Rudi Schneider. He was leaning\r\nforward with his head on my knees, and was quite motionless. The\r\nquick breathing had temporarily ceased. I had hold of both his\r\nwrists, and was gripping his legs with my knees. My feet were\r\npressed against the legs of his chair. I am quite satisfied that he\r\ncould not have moved the curtain by normal means. Both doors were locked throughout the sitting.\r\n1935, October 7th. Evening sitting.\r\nBefore and after the sitting I examined the \" cabinet \" and found\r\nnothing suspicious. I also looked under the large table in the corner\r\nof the room. During the sitting, the door of the room and the door of the vestibule were both locked, the keys remaining in the locks. Both doors were found to be still locked at the end of the sitting.\r\nOrder : Rudi Schneider, C.V.C.H. (controller), Miss Reutiner (2nd\r\ncontroller), Mr Evelyn, Frau Leeder, Lord Charles Hope, Herr\r\nKostersitz.\r\nWe began at hrs. 20.32 and ended at hrs. 22.02.\r\nThere were two movements of the curtain, both predicted by\r\nRudi-Olga. The first was seen by Miss Reutiner, Herr Kostersitz,\r\nand myself. I am quite certain that it was a real movement, and\r\nthat the control of the medium was perfectly effective. Rudi-Olga\r\nhad asked us to count to five, and then to \" look out \" at the curtains. The movement began about two seconds after we had said\r\n\" five \". Rudi Schneider was leaning forward with his head on my\r\nlap. I had a firm hold of his two wrists, and his legs were gripped\r\nbetween my knees. My two feet were pressed against the legs of\r\nhis chair. The distance from the inner edges of the two curtains to\r\nthe nearest point on the medium's chair was 120 centimetres. The\r\ndistance from the right-hand edge of the right curtain to the chair was 40 centimetres. The reason that the movement was not seen by the other sitters was, I think, that it was an in-and-out movement, at right angles to the plane of the curtains, and was thus more\r\napparent to the sitters on the ends of the semicircle of chairs than to\r\nthose who were more opposite the centre of the curtains.\r\n226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1936\r\nThe second movement was only observed by Herr Kostersitz. By\r\nthis time, the luminous strips on the curtains (by which the movements were made visible) had become very dim. Herr Kostersitz\r\nwas certainly in the best position to observe curtain movements,\r\nand it is possible that this one (which he described as large) was real. Lord Charles Hope held both Herr Kostersitz's hands throughout\r\nthe sitting.\r\n1935, October Sth. Evening sitting.\r\nDuring each period, both doors were locked on the inside, the keys were left in the locks. The room was searched before the sitting by\r\nLord Charles Hope and myself. Nothing suspicious was found.\r\n1st Period : hrs. 20.10 to hrs. 21.04.\r\nOrder : Rudi Schneider, C.V.C.H. (controller), Miss Reutiner (2nd\r\ncontroller), Count Schonborn, Countess Schonborn, Mr Evelyn, Frau\r\nLeeder, Lord Charles Hope, Herr Kostersitz.\r\nNo phenomenon was reported.\r\n2nd Period : hrs. 21.18 to hrs. 22.17.\r\nDuring the first part of the 2nd period the order was the same as\r\nfor the 1st period. Then, at the request of Rudi-Olga, I changed\r\nplaces with Count Schonborn, who took control.\r\nWhile I was controlling, there was a small curtain movement.\r\n\u2022 predicted by Rudi-Olga, which came after a count of five. It was\r\nseen by myself, Miss Reutiner, Mr Evelyn, and Herr Kostersitz.\r\nI have no doubt that it was a real movement, and that it could not\r\nhave been produced by Rudi Schneider by normal means. When\r\nthe movement happened, his head was down on my right thigh, I had a firm grip of his two wrists, and his legs were held between my\r\nknees. My two feet were pressed against the legs of his chair. The\r\ndistance from the curtains to the medium's chair was the same as for\r\nthe sitting of October 7th {i.e. to centre of curtains, 120 centimetres,\r\nto right edge of curtain, 40 centimetres).\r\n3rd Period : hrs. 22.32 to hrs. 0.02.\r\nOrder : Rudi Schneider, Count Schonborn (controller), Miss\r\nReutiner (2nd controller), C.V.C.H., Countess Schonborn, Mr\r\nEvelyn, Frau Leeder, Lord Charles Hope, Herr Kostersitz.\r\nOne good curtain movement, seen by everybody except Rudi\r\nSchneider and Countess Schonborn. One doubtful movement.\r\n4th Period : hrs. 0.15 to Jus. 1.35.\r\nSame order as for the 3rd period.\r\nSeveral good curtain movements seen by all the sitters. A small\r\nstool, which stood under the red lamp, was overturned and fell\r\nMay 1936 Some Recent Sittings with Continental Mediums 227\r\ntowards the sitters, coming to rest on my foot. It fell as if a force\r\nhad been applied to it in a direct line from the centre of the curtains,\r\nand acting away from the curtains. The stool had four legs and\r\nalthough it was not heavy, it needed to be tipped through a large\r\nangle before it would overbalance. Distance from centre of stool to\r\nthe centre of the curtains, 95 centimetres. Distance from the stool\r\nto the medium's chair, 93 centimetres. I have considerably longer arms than Rudi Schneider, and, when sitting in the medium's chair,\r\nI found that I could not reach the stool unless I leaned hard over to\r\nthe right. Miss Reutiner is positive that throughout the sitting\r\nSchneider never leant over to the right. Count Schonborn has had\r\nconsiderable experience in controlling this medium, and Miss\r\nReutiner, who was acting as 2nd controller, vouches that his control, so far as she was able to judge, was very firm and strict throughout\r\nthe sitting. Lord Charles Hope reports that he was holding both\r\nHerr Kostersitz's hands in his left hand.\r\nAfter the sitting was over, I searched the \" cabinet \" and the room\r\nand found nothing suspicious.\r\nLet us consider the movements produced while I myself was controlling the medium. They were all movements of the curtains\r\nforming the front of the \" cabinet \", and I am absolutely certain that\r\nthey were actual movements and not creations of the imagination\r\ncaused by the bad lighting. I am also sure that they could not have\r\nbeen caused by accidents\u2014draughts, etc. To me it seems impossible\r\nthat they could have been done by the medium by normal means.\r\nI am thus faced with three alternatives, viz. that they were produced\r\nby fraudulent manipulation on the part of one or more of the sitters ; that they were done by fraud by a person or persons from outside the\r\nroom ; that they were produced by paranormal means. In considering the first of these three alternatives, I should like to\r\ncall your attention to the fact that at the sittings in question no member of the Schneider family was present as a sitter, nor were\r\neither Frau or Herr Schickl in the room ; whereas at other sittings,\r\nat which no phenomena were recorded, the two Schickls and Schneider's wife and mother were all in attendance. The full list of sitters\r\nat these three sittings is as follows : Lord Charles Hope\r\nMiss Reutiner\r\nHerr Kostersitz\r\nC.V.C.H.\r\npresent at all three sittings.\r\nProfessor Schwaiger\r\nFrau Schwaiger\r\nI\r\nI present only on October 6th.\r\n228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1936\r\nMr Evelyn\r\nFrau Leeder\r\nCount Schonborn\r\nCountess Schonborn\r\npresent on October 7th and 8th.\r\npresent only on October 8th.\r\nProfessor Schwaiger is the chief engineer of Radio Wien, the\r\nVienna broadcasting station, and has done a great deal of research\r\nin the field of parapsychology. Heir Kostersitz is an engineer and\r\nis the professor's assistant. Frau Leeder is a venerable old Austrian\r\nlady, the widow of an official of the Court. The Schonborns are Czechoslovakians who have had much experience with sittings with\r\nthis medium. The others are all members of this Society.\r\nIt will be seen that there were only four persons who were present\r\nat all three sittings, viz. myself, Lord Charles Hope, Miss Reutiner,\r\nand Herr Kostersitz. So, unless there were two or more swindlers,\r\nit must have been one of these who was cheating. This does not seem to me to be at all probable. Nor is it any easier to suspect\r\nProfessor Schwaiger and his wife, Mr Evelyn, Frau Leeder, or Count\r\nand Countess Schonborn of nefarious practices. Except at the\r\nsitting of October 6th, when Herr Kostersitz's left hand was free,\r\nevery hand in the room was being controlled by a person other than\r\nits owner ; 1 so that, if the movements were done by a sitter by hand,\r\nhe must have received active or passive support from another person.\r\nThe only persons who sat next to each other at all three sittings were Lord Charles Hope and Herr Kostersitz. So, if they can be acquitted\r\nof collusive fraud, it would have needed at least four persons working\r\nin collaboration for tke movements to have been done by hand. But\r\nif the sitters' hands were controlled, their feet were free. Could any- one have kicked the curtains ? Herr Kostersitz was near enough ; but then there was a massive apparatus in the way. I do not think\r\nhe could have done it without arousing Lord Charles Hope's suspicion. The other sitters, except possibly Lord Charles himself, were\r\nall too far away. How about some sort of extending rod, held in the\r\nteeth ? Possible, but very unlikely.\r\nLet us consider the possibility of fraud from outside. Could someone have been concealed in the room ? The only possible places of\r\nconcealment were searched before and after the sittings. No one was found. Could someone have got into the room during the\r\nsittings without any of the sitters noticing ? The room was unfurnished except for the requisites for the sittings. The walls were\r\nplain whitewashed plaster. I am certain there were no trap doors\r\n1 Except my right hand, which was holding the medium's left hand. But\r\nfor the purposes of this paper, I must claim to be above suspicion.\r\nMay 1936 Some Recent Sittings with Continental Mediums 229\r\nor secret entrances. The windows were securely shuttered. There\r\nwas a single door, communicating with a vestibule, also unfurnished,\r\nfrom which a second door led into the garden. Both these doors were locked on the insides, and the keys left in the locks. It would\r\nmean that somebody had to open the outer door, by forcing round\r\nthe key with pincers or a wire ; close the door after him ; repeat the\r\nprocess with the door of the seance room ; get through the door\r\nwithout making enough noise to be heard by Lord Charles or Herr\r\nKostersitz, both of whom were sitting close to the door ; move the\r\ncurtains ; get out of the room ; lock the door after him with his\r\nwire or pincers ; and then lock the door of the vestibule in the same\r\nway. There was very little noise going on during the sittings ; none\r\nof the shouting and song which is sometimes a feature of sittings\r\nwith this medium. I think it is utterly impossible for such a feat of\r\nhousebreaking to pass undetected. Moreover, I examined both keys\r\ncarefully, and could find no trace of scratches, such as forcing them\r\nround from the outside would be expected to produce.\r\nCould the curtains have been moved from outside the room ? I examined the \" cabinet \" and its fittings with great care in an excellent light. There were no holes in the wall, through which strings or wires might have passed into another room. Nor were any such\r\nstrings seen when the \" cabinet \" was examined before the sittings.\r\nI could find no hole in the ceiling, through which a rod might have\r\ncome down from the floor above. A magnet ? Certainly there might\r\nhave been a powerful electro-magnet hidden in the next room,\r\nwhich would act on pieces of metal sewn into the curtains : but I must admit that I do not consider it very likely.\r\nA supernormal explanation, though intrinsically very unlikely, is rendered less so in this case, since there is a lot of evidence 1 that\r\nvery queer things do happen at sittings with this medium.\r\nWe are thus faced with three improbabilities, and I will leave you\r\nto decide which one you accept. Or, possibly, one of you may be able\r\nto suggest a more likely explanation.\r\nBefore I leave the subject of Rudi Schneider, I should like to say\r\na few words about an apparatus, designed by Professor Schwaiger,\r\nthat was used at some of the sittings. It was an application of the\r\nprinciple of dark television, by means of which a visible image is obtained of the cross section of a beam of infra-red. One can thus\r\n\" see\" objects that enter the beam, although it is completely stripped\r\nJ See E. and M. Osty, Les Pouvoirs inconnus de VEsprit sur In Matiere\r\n(Paris 1932).\r\nLord Charles Hope and others. Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi\r\nSchneider. Proc. S.P.R., 1933, June, XLI, 131.\r\n230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1936\r\nof all visible light. Light from a projector lamp is refracted into a parallel beam by a lens, and the beam is analysed by a rotating \"scanning\r\ndrum \", which will be familiar to those conversant with television apparatus. The resulting small beam traverses the whole field during\r\neach revolution of the scanning drum. The visible light is absorbed\r\nfrom the beam by means of a filter, the remaining infra-red being\r\nfocused on to a photo-electric cell by means of a second lens. The\r\namplified output of the cell is made to activate a neon glowlamp, the\r\nlight from which is synthesised by a viewing drum, rotating in synchronisation with the scanning drum. Owing to the phenomenon of\r\npersistence of vision, the eye of the observer, applied to the scanning\r\ndrum, sees, not a small spot of light rapidly traversing the field, but\r\na uniform illumination of the whole area of the field. Any occulting\r\nobject placed in the infra-red beam, will be seen as a dark silhouette\r\nagainst this bright area. This silhouette picture, which is smaller\r\nthan the original object, is not quite as clear as could be wished ; though, with a more elaborate apparatus, greater definition could no doubt be obtained. As it is, however, a very good idea can be had\r\nof the nature of any object entering the field when the apparatus is in use. For example, we tried the experiment of blowing cigarette\r\nsmoke into the beam, and its presence was at once detected by the\r\nobserver.\r\nBy recording the current through the neon lamp, either on a wax\r\ndisk or on a photographic film, the moving picture seen by the\r\nobserver could be reproduced at will. Professor Schwaiger has not\r\ndone this yet ; but the method is well known, and would present no\r\nspecial difficulties. Such reproduction would obviously be of enormous importance in psychical research, and I understand that\r\na recording apparatus will be constructed as soon as any results are obtained with the apparatus.\r\nThe apparatus was used at the sittings of October 1st and October\r\n8th ; but nothing was observed with it.\r\nFrom Weyer, we went on to Warsaw, where my chief objective\r\nwas M. Ossowiecki. I got into touch with him soon after my arrival,\r\nbut found unfortunately that he was not at all well. He told us that\r\nhis blood-pressure was abnormally low, that he was very run down,\r\nand that his doctor had forbidden him to attempt any clairvoyant\r\nwork for some time. In spite of this, he very kindly consented to\r\ntry an experiment for me, and did in fact do his utmost to \" read\r\n\"\r\nsome specially prepared letters that I had brought with me from\r\nEngland.\r\nI had planned to try three main experiments with M. Ossowiecki,\r\nMay 1936 Some Recent Sittings with Continental Mediums 231\r\nwhich, were as follows : the \" reading \" of an envelope the contents\r\nof which were unknown to any living person ; the \" reading of a\r\nsimilar envelope the contents of which were unknown to any person,\r\nalive or dead ; and the \" reading \" of an envelope containing a message in the form of a latent image on photographic paper. For\r\nthe first, I took a manuscript book, written in French, tore out a page in the dark, sealed it in an envelope, and destroyed the rest of\r\nthe book. Any question of telepathy was thus disposed of. For my\r\nsecond envelope, I built up a number of six digits, by taking a large\r\nnumber of similar pieces of paper, on each of which was written a\r\nsingle digit, selecting six of these in the dark, and pasting them in a\r\nline on to a sheet of paper, thus forming a six-digit number. Both\r\nof these envelopes contained, in addition to the message, small\r\npieces of sensitive photographic paper ; so that any attempt to read\r\nthem by means of X-rays, or by opening the envelopes, would have\r\nbetrayed itself by the fogging of the paper. For my last envelope,\r\nI prepared a special \" pen \", consisting of a hollow tube, pointed at one end, and containing a minute electric lamp. With this I \"wrote\"\r\non a sheet of photographic paper, which was then enclosed in a\r\nsealed envelope. After the \" writing \" had been done, the paper\r\nappeared quite unaltered, the writing only coming out if the paper was placed in a developing solution. This arrangement was absolutely proof against fraud by opening the envelope, X-ray examination, etc. In case this test should prove impossible, even if M.\r\nOssowiecki's powers were perfectly genuine, I also wrote a word or two on the back of the paper in ordinary pencil.\r\nAs an additional precaution, and to guard against possible substitution of the envelopes, I made secret marks on each of the three,\r\nand examined these carefully before and after each experiment.\r\nM. Ossowiecki made several attempts to read the envelopes, devoting\r\nin all several hours to them. He was not successful with any. He\r\ncontinually complained of feeling ill, saying that as soon as he con- centrated on an envelope, he began to feel giddy.\r\nOne afternoon, when he was having tea with us in the Europejski\r\nHotel, he said that it was much easier to \" read \" something that\r\nhad just been written. He suggested that I should make a drawing on a card and give it to him to try. I went to the other end of the\r\nroom and drew at a writing table, first making sure that no one\r\ncould overlook me. I drew a teapot, which happened to be the\r\nfirst thing that came into my head. I drew it in three parts : first the body and lid, then the handle, then the spout. I put the card\r\ninto one of the hotel envelopes, and sealed it up. I then tried holding\r\nthe envelope up to a strong light, and found that the drawing could\r\n232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1936\r\nbe seen through the paper. This was very unfortunate, but it was\r\ntoo late to do anything. I returned to M. Ossowiecki and gave him\r\nthe envelope, watching him very carefully to see if he held it to the\r\nlight. This I was certain that he did not do. It was not enough to\r\nhold the envelope to the window. A bright light was necessary. The\r\nonly light near M. Ossowiecki was an electric wall bracket which was\r\ndirectly behind him. To make use of this, he would have to have\r\nturned round in his seat, and I am certain that he did not attempt\r\nto do it. M. Ossowiecki held the envelope in his hands, rubbed it between his fingers, and then placed it on the table with his hand over\r\nit. He never examined it closely, nor was he wearing his spectacles,\r\nwhich were very strong ones, and without which I doubt if he could\r\nhave seen very much. He then spoke in French. A translation of\r\nwhat he said is as follows : \" I can't do anything to-day. . . . There are three parts to this\r\ndrawing. It is as if there is a pipe ; then as if ... I don't know\r\nwhat. I begin to see something ... a head ? It is not an ordinary\r\ndrawing, it is something fantastic. I don't know what it is. . . . No. I cannot do it. . . . \" I see ... a head ? . . . A tail ! A tail ! Is it a cat ? I don't\r\nknow what it is. You are not an artist, are you ? Not good at\r\ndrawing. Give me a bit of paper.\"\r\nI handed M. Ossowiecki a pencil and a piece of paper, which he\r\ndrew on. His drawing is not unlike my teapot, but is drawn on end,\r\nwith the handle at the top. \" No ! No ! Look ! Look ! \" He drew a second picture. This drawing is done the same way up\r\nas the first, but is much more like my teapot. M. Ossowiecki did not seem to have any idea of what it was supposed to be.\r\nAs I have said, I am quite convinced that M. Ossowiecki did not\r\nhold the envelope up to the light ; but afterwards I found that by\r\npressing the envelope down on to the table, one could just see the\r\ndrawing through the paper. I am fairly certain that he did not do\r\nthis, but there is a possibility that he did, as I was not on the look\r\nout for it while I was watching him. But I do not think that he\r\ncould have seen the form of the drawing without his spectacles.\r\nThis little experiment is thus of some interest, though I do not, of\r\ncourse, put it forward as any proof of supernormal faculty.\r\nWhile I was in Warsaw, I also attended two sittings with the\r\nclairvoyant Sabira, who has a great reputation in Poland. Lord\r\nCharles Hope, Mr Evelyn, and Miss Reutiner also attended the\r\nsittings. We tried Madame Sabira's powers with various experi-\r\nMay 1936 Some Recent Sittings with Continental Mediums 233\r\nments. I gave her a watch, and she attempted a description of its late owner. Letters were similarly treated, and at her special\r\nrequest, we prepared, for the second sitting, a number of identical\r\nboxes, each containing a different object. These she \" psychometrised \", and gave descriptions that she said applied to the\r\nobjects. We were not, however, able to detect the faintest sign of\r\nany paranormal faculty. All the objects were wrongly described,\r\nthe characters of the writers of the letters were unrecognisable, and\r\nthe owner of my watch was chimerical.\r\nI may add that a sitting with this medium was lately held in\r\nLondon at the Society's rooms, and an attempt was made by\r\nMadame Sabira to give medical diagnosis from photographs of the\r\npatients. The experiment was very carefully carried out, and again no evidence was obtained of paranormal faculty.\r\nFrom Warsaw we went to Kracow, where we had heard rumours\r\nof a wonderful medium \" better than Kluski \". This remarkable\r\nindividual was first said to be a judge of the High Court ; but afterwards they told us he was really an engineer. But, whatever he was,\r\nhe completely failed to materialise.\r\nWe came back via Prague, where we were introduced to various\r\ndistinguished foreigners who were interested in psychical research.\r\nIn Prague we again met Count and Countess Schonborn, who told us that, after we had left Weyer, a wonderful sitting with Rudi\r\nSchneider had taken place while the medium was staying with them\r\nat their shooting box in Austria. Herr Kostersitz had also been\r\npresent. A materialised hand had come out from the \" cabinet \" and rung a gong. Another sitting with Herr Schickl's photographic\r\napparatus had been held, at which three cameras were used : the\r\nusual one manipulated by Herr Schickl, one put up by Count\r\nSchonborn, and one belonging to Herr Kostersitz. Both Herr\r\nSchickl's camera and the Count's had produced an image ; but the\r\nimages were quite different in the two pictures. The Count's\r\nresembled a half moon, while Herr Schickl's showed a criss-cross\r\narrangement of bright lines. Herr Kostersitz's camera produced a complete blank, as mine had done. Without wishing to appear\r\nunduly conceited, I cannot help suggesting that possibly when this\r\napparatus is used, the amount appearing on the plates is inversely\r\nproportional to the skill of the photographer.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to thank very heartily the anonymous\r\nMember who so kindly paid the expenses of my trip ; and also to\r\nthank the Council for allowing me to be absent from London for over\r\nfour weeks.\r\n234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1936\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nProxy Sittings\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014Dr Dingwall's theory that the sitter makes the sitting\r\nwould involve so immense a saving of thought and labour that its attractions are obvious : but the only grain of demonstration to\r\nsupport it, so far, is the not very difficult observation that, in the\r\nNewlove case, Mr Dayton Thomas's mention of diphtheria could\r\nhave made Feda think of drains and speak of \" pipes.\" The contribution of the sitter in transforming this elementary association of\r\nideas into an elaborate chain of evidence leading to something not\r\ndrains as a likely cause of something not diphtheria, remains a matter of assertion without evidence.\r\nThe normal but unnoticed reactions between sitter and medium\r\ndeserve very careful tracing and analysis in all cases, and it is a disappointment that Dr. Dingwall continues to support his theory\r\nby declarations instead of turning his abilities to the finding of\r\ninstances which might be of real value.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nKenneth Richmond\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014Commenting on mental phenomena in the April issue\r\nof the Journal, Dr Dingwall makes the astonishing assertion \" that\r\nit is the sitter who produces the results, not the medium.\" This\r\nbeing the case, can he explain the following experiences in connection\r\nwith sittings I have had for automatic writing with Miss Geraldine\r\nCummins ?\r\n(1) Some years ago she wrote the surname and christian name of a man who claimed that he had recently died. He gave the name\r\nof the street in which he hved in a town which neither she nor I had\r\never visited. The alleged communicator was a complete stranger to\r\nus, but I traced the widow at the address given and she corroborated\r\nfurther details unknown to us which had been written by Miss\r\nCummins. Am I to assume that I am responsible for the production\r\nof the above information ?\r\n(2) The young daughter of a friend of mine died at the age of\r\nfifteen. I had not seen her since she was five. The mother asked\r\nif I would try to get into touch with her. After some confusion\r\nwhich was subsequently elucidated, Miss Cummins produced a\r\npersonality which was recognised by the mother (who was not pre-\r\nMay 1936 Correspon dence 235\r\nsent but to whom I forwarded the script), together with other\r\ndetails connected with the child which were unknown to me. One\r\nof these was a statement as to where the mother was and what\r\nshe was doing at a certain Christmas. The mother's whereabouts\r\nwere, at that time, entirely unknown to me and Miss Cummins\r\nwas unacquainted with both mother and child.\r\n(3) The case of T.M. : A man whom, though a friend of my brotherin-law, I had never met, purported to communicate through Miss\r\nCummins giving many details entirely unknown to either of us which were subsequently verified. (This case is fully reported in\r\nPsychic Science for October 1935).\r\nRegarding Nos. 2 and 3, Dr Dingwall may say that I was en\r\nrapport with the mother in the one instance and with my brotherin-law in the other and that thus I was able to produce these results. But this hypothesis does not apply to No. 1, unless he claims that I have the power of penetrating the minds and surroundings of people\r\nunknown to me who don't interest me in the least and imparting\r\ntelepathically the details ascertained to the medium.\r\nIn view of the many records extant in which evidence has been\r\ngiven by a medium of knowledge unknown to anyone present at\r\nthe sitting, I think Dr Dingwall's remark the most preposterous I have ever read.\r\nI entirely agree with Mr Drayton Thomas's statement that it yet\r\nremains to be proved that a medium can tap memories of a distant\r\nperson unknown to medium and to sitter. Yours faithfully,\r\nE. B. Cibbes.\r\nThe Mediumship of Carlos Mirabelli\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014Owing to absence abroad and other causes I am only\r\nnow able to answer Lord Charles Hope's letter in the February\r\nJournal about the film I took during the Mirabelli sittings. On my\r\narrival in New York from South America after the Mirabelli sittings I had this film processed and projected by the Eastman people. As\r\nprojected by them the film showed nothing more than a vague blur,\r\nand I was assured that no better result was obtainable. I made the\r\nmistake of accepting this assurance, coming from the source it did.\r\nAnd it now appears, thanks to Lord Charles Hope, that I made the even worse blunder of supposing that it is possible to film a scene and at the same time correctly to observe its details. For, although\r\nI was right in saving that Mirabelli did not throw himself on the\r\n236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1936\r\nblackboard, I overlooked what cornes pretty well to the same thing\r\nand what the film clearly, though momentarily, shows, that he did\r\nin fact, on one occasion, grasp the edge of the blackboard as it fell. At the same time, it is only fair to point out that the film, when\r\nprojected at close range and as sharply defined as possible, brings out\r\nthe points I made in my paper in regard to the brilliant light, the\r\nproximity of the \" sitters,\" and the consequent unlikelihood of the\r\nuse of threads passing unperceived. On the whole, I feel that the\r\nposition remains about what it was before. Nevertheless, I amgreatly obliged to Lord Charles Hope for the trouble he has taken.\r\nDr Dingwall's letter in the January Journal calls for little comment, and such as it requires has already been made by Dr Bruck\r\nin the March Journal. Dr Dingwall is one of your flash pugilists\r\nthough, it must be pointed out, strictly in theory and in theory only.\r\nHe is satisfied with nothing less than a knock-out blow in the first round, whether to terrorise his opponent, astonish his audience, or\r\nbolster up his own self-confidence, it is not easy to determine. I must confess that, and in practice as well as in theory, I am less ambitious. So long as I gain the advantage in the end, I am quite\r\ncontent to give away a few points in the early rounds, thus giving\r\nmyself the opportunity of gaining some insight into the other man's\r\nmethods. For I am interested not only in determining his merits,\r\nbut also in promoting knowledge of the science in general.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nTheodore Besterman.\r\nMISPRINT\r\n\r\nJournal for April\r\nP. 215, line 12, for \" elusive \" read \" classic.\"\r\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE\r\nCIRCULATION\r\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private\r\nnature of the Journal, from which no quotations should be made without the previous consent of the Council.

The\r\nphenomena reported were as follows : Several persons had seen a figure resembling an elderly or middleaged woman, dressed in grey. The apparition was only seen for a few seconds, and had never been heard to speak. Particulars of the\r\nappearances were entered from time to time in a notebook, the dates\r\nof the entries not being given. Some of these accounts are as follows : By ;i Mrs Westfield \" : \" I saw the ghost in February 1932 in the night nursery. I\r\nthought it was my daughter in a grey dressing gown out of bed, so I was very cross and asked her what on earth she was doing out of\r\nbed. She was standing by the fire, bending over it, and instead of\r\nanswering me she merely vanished ! My daughter was peacefully\r\nsleeping in the same room.\"\r\nBy - Mr Henry Westfield \", aged 21, Mr Westfield's son : \" 1930. I cannot remember the date, but it was on a Saturday\r\nnight, about 11 p.m. I was sleeping in my father's room and was\r\nawakened on hearing a noise. I saw what I took to be my sister,\r\nbut she did not reply when I spoke to her. I took my eyes off her\r\nto get my torch, and on looking again she had disappeared. There\r\nwas a small light in the passage way which made her cast a shadow\r\non my bed.\"\r\n1931. November. At about 9 p.m. I went up to my mother's\r\nroom to get a torch. As I came out of the door I saw a small woman\r\nstanding in front of the light. I knew at once it was the ghost as I had seen it before : she was old, with a blue grey dress on, which\r\ncame down to her ankles. She had what looked to be a grey veil\r\nhanging from her head down her back, like a nurse's cap. She was\r\nstanding in front of the lamp, and I could not see the light through\r\nher. She turned and walked into the darkness up the stairs.\" \" 1932. April. At 1 a.m. I was awakened on hearing someone\r\nwalking down stairs. I got up and looked out of my bedroom door,\r\nand saw the little woman in grey walking down the front stairs with a hght in her hand.\"\r\n240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1936\r\nBy \" Miss Westfield \", aged 22 : \" June, 1932. At 1.30 a.m. I awoke with a start and to my\r\nsurprise I saw standing by my bed the figure of a small woman. She\r\ncarried no light and was dressed in a bluish grey dress with a tight\r\nwaist and falling in thick folds over her hips. Her hair was long and\r\nbrown, hanging over her shoulders. At first I thought it was\r\nMother, and was very surprised that she should walk round the room\r\nwith no light, for there was no other entrance to the room except\r\nthrough a locked door. I switched on the electric torch and found\r\nno one. I few minutes later, Mother came in and said a figure\r\nanswering to the same description had been seen leaving my sister's\r\nbedroom.\"\r\nBy \" Miss Rosemary Westfield \", aged 16 : \" November 1st, 1933. It was just before lunch when I was\r\nentering the hall from the stairs that I saw the ghost. I did not see her distinctly, but she was standing by the round table in her usual\r\nclothes, and seemed to me to be very much interested in a bowl of\r\nflowers which stood on the table. As I approached her, she walked\r\nswiftly and noiselessly away to the other part of the hall, where she\r\ndisappeared before I could get round the corner.\"\r\nBy \" Miss Evelyn Westfield \", aged 15 : \" November 1st, 1933. About a quarter of an hour after Rosemary had seen the ghost. I was walking down the stairs, and I saw\r\na lady standing in the doorway of the drawing room. She then\r\nwalked swiftly through the door and round the table, and after that\r\nI could see her no longer. She was wearing her usual blue grey\r\nclothes, and I could not see her face. Elizabeth {i.e. Miss Westfield)\r\nwas putting wood on the fire, and did not see the ghost, which was\r\nbehind her. because she made no noise as she walked.\"\r\nVarious other similar appearances are recorded by the family,\r\nsome at night, others by daylight. Only on one occasion does the\r\nfigure seem to have appeared to two persons simultaneously. This\r\nwas during August, 1935. At about 8 o'clock, while the family and\r\nseveral guests were sitting at dinner in the hall, a young Dutchman\r\npresent, who had never heard of the ghost, saw a stranger walk into\r\nthe door, cross the hall, and go upstairs. \" Mr Henry Westfield \"\r\nalso saw it, and recognised it as the ghost. A search was made, but\r\nnothing could be found.\r\nThe most alarming appearance was in 1934. \" Mr Henry Westfield \" was going upstairs to bed at about 11 p.m., when he suddenly\r\nremembered that he had left something behind. He turned round\r\nand saw the ghost a few feet away, following him up the stairs.\r\nJune 1936 Case 241\r\nApart from these appearances, there are several other phenomena.\r\nHeavy footsteps are sometimes heard.\r\n\" Miss Westfield \" writes : \" August 1933. At about 2 a.m. I was awakened by the sound\r\nof footsteps coming down a narrow passage which led to my room.\r\nI thought that somebody wanted something, so I sat up in bed and\r\nwaited. The person appeared to pause at the door and I thought\r\nI heard a knock, but I was not sure. I called but there was no reply.\r\nThe next morning I was told that other people in the house had heard\r\nthe sound of footsteps walking up and down the passage. Several\r\ntimes since, although I have changed rooms, I have been awakened\r\nsuddenly in the night with the impression that someone had entered\r\nmy room.\"\r\nThere are several reports of a howling or screaming noise being\r\nheard, generally by daylight. This noise does not seem to be in any\r\nway connected with the wind, being heard as often in calm weather\r\nas during a storm. Many people complain that they wake in the\r\nnight with an unpleasant feeling that somebody is bending over\r\ntheir bed. Sometimes they feel touches on the bedclothes.\r\n\" Mrs Westfield \" writes : \" About 5 years ago or less I was really terrified. I was very\r\ntired and in a deep sleep when I was awakened by my bed shaking\r\nand vibrating as if someone was trying to move it backwards and\r\nforwards. I half woke and heard someone shuffling round the bed.\r\nThe person bent over me, and it seemed that someone touched my\r\nfeet and then began to grope their way up to my face. I was frozen\r\nwith terror and seized a match box, and as soon as I got a light ii stopped. I got out of bed and. with a powerful torch searched the\r\nroom and the whole house, but there was nothing to account for\r\nit. It was a dead calm moonlight night. \" Exactly the same thing happened about three years later, when\r\nsomeone seemed to grope round my bed, and actually feel their way\r\nup to my face and press their face close to mine.\"\r\nAt least two of the people who have reported this phenomenon\r\nhad not previously been told anything about the ghost, so that suggestion, unless it were a telepathic suggestion, would not account for it . The old family nurse, \" Miss Johnson \", reported that she had\r\nseveral times heard heavy footsteps walking along the passages when\r\nthere was no one there. On some of these occasions, a young\r\nnursery maid, who was in the room with her, had heard nothing at\r\nall. The nursery maid was not in the least deaf.\r\nDuring January of 1936, Mr Herbert and Lord Charles Hope\r\n242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1936\r\nspent two nights in the house. They took the opportunity of\r\nquestioning very fully all the available witnesses, including the\r\nmembers of the family whose accounts are given above, and \" Miss\r\nJohnson \". They formed the opinion that all these persons were\r\nreliable witnesses, and that they were fully convinced they had\r\nheard and seen the various phenomena. The house was carefully\r\nexamined. It is a very old foundation which has been considerably\r\naltered and partially rebuilt. The floors seemed to be unusually\r\nsolid, and there was very little of the creaking of boards so often\r\nmet with in old houses.\r\nNeither of the investigators experienced anything unusual, but\r\nduring the second night that they were in the house, \" Mr Henry\r\nWestfield \" reported that he had seen the figure of the old lady on\r\nthe staircase. Both investigators interviewed him a few minutes\r\nafterwards, and were satisfied that his account was perfectly bona\r\nfide. He was clearly convinced that he had really seen the figure.\r\nThe investigators brought to the house the well known clairvoyantMiss Frances Campbell. Miss Campbell had been told that the\r\nghost was that of a woman, and that footsteps had been heard at\r\nnight ; but apart from this she had been given no material information about the phenomena. During a seance that was held, Miss\r\nCampbell said that there were several ghosts, one of which was the\r\nghost of a dog. This is of interest, as some time previously \" Miss\r\nWestfield \" had received a \" message \" with a planchette board,\r\nwhich said that there was a ghost of a bloodhound in the house.\r\nMiss Campbell had not been told about this. Miss Campbell described the principal ghost as follows :\r\n\" The ghost is an elderly lady. She is quite nice but is rather apt\r\nto be frigid with strangers.\"\r\n[Question : what is the old lady like ?] \" It is difficult to say. She has a clear complexion. She is dressed\r\nin a dress that is not modern, but not very old. A long skirt.\"\r\n[Question : hair ?] \" It is hidden in a cap. She has small hands.\"\r\n[Question : what colour dress ?] \" Grey dress.\"\r\n[Question : tall ?] \" More than average but not tall. She carries herself with such\r\ndignity that she seems taller than in reality.\"\r\nThis description agrees very well with the reported apparition,\r\nexcept that all the people who have seen the figure describe it as\r\nshort.\r\nJune 1936 Correspondence 243\r\nThe case presents many interesting features, and is probably as\r\nwell authenticated a ghost story as it would be possible to find. The\r\nphenomena are many and varied, and have been witnessed by\r\nseveral people, some of whom are quite independent (i.e. they did\r\nnot know about the ghost) so that suggestion can be eliminated. It seems highly improbable that so many phenomena of such widely\r\ndifferent types could have been the result of malobservation or pure\r\nimagination. But on the other hand there does not seem to be much\r\nevidence that the manifestations have any objective reality. On\r\nthe contrary, there is evidence that they are subjective. All the\r\nmembers of the family who have witnessed the phenomena are of\r\nthe type generally known as \" psychic \" : many have had previous\r\ntelepathic experiences. The only member of the family who did not seem to be at all \" psychic \", i.e. Mr Westfield, has never seen or heard anything unusual in the house. Again, \" Miss Johnson \"\r\nheard the footsteps when the nursery maid could hear nothing\r\nat all. It is possible that the phenomena are all hallucinatory, and that\r\nthe hallucinations have a cause in common which one may designate\r\nas \" the ghost \", without going further into considerations of what\r\n\" the ghost \" actually is.

H. Salter,\r\n(Hon. Secretary).\r\nMemory and Telepathy\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nDear Madam,\u2014There is one aspect of the problem of telepathy\r\nwhich has never, to the best of my knowledge, been adequately\r\ndealt with. This relates to its connection with memory.\r\nLet me first of all refer to one or two generally accepted facts. According to mechanistic physiology, all our memories consist in\r\ndefinite \" traces \" left upon the nervous system, and particularly\r\nupon the brain. These traces have been given various names\r\nengrams and what not. These are supposed to be somehow \" deposited \" in the brain in somewhat the same manner that grooves\r\nare cut in a phonograph record ; the actual music is not left upon\r\nthe record\u2014only its physical counterpart. And, just as the needle,\r\nre-travelling these grooves, can reproduce the music, so renewed\r\nactivity of these cells, or the passage of nervous currents through\r\nthem, will re-stimulate and revive these latent memories, causing\r\nthem to be reproduced and recognized. The analogy is a nice one,\r\ngiving us food for thought.\r\nIt is true that Bergson and others have protested against this\r\nmechanistic theory of memory ; but it is safe to say that it is held\r\nby the great majority of physiologists to-day, in some form or another ; and for ordinary daily life it might be held a conceivable\r\npossibility\u2014once we overlook the ever-present problem of the\r\nconnection of mind and brain ! But telepathy (and of course other psychic phenomena) assuredly\r\nraise grave doubts as to the feasibility of this currently-held ex- planation.\r\nJune 1936 Correspondence 245\r\nAll our past experiences must reside within us as memories of\r\nsome sort, being only recalled when they rise into consciousness.\r\nOn the mechanistic theory, these memories must consist of \" traces\r\n\"\r\nleft on the brain, i.e., physiological changes representing \" potential\r\n\r\nmemories only, and not actual mental states or entities\u2014memories\r\nproper. These only become such in the act of their recall. Now it is the commonest thing in the world for a medium to\r\nransack the sitter's memory, and extract from it all sorts of hidden\r\nand forgotten events. Instances of this are assuredly numerous. In psychic experimentation, as Miss X expressed it years ago : \" what is on the top of one's mind does not tumble out first.\" Assuming unconscious telepathic transfer from the sitter, for the\r\nsake of argument, or (what seems to happen in such cases) actual\r\n\"mind reading\", what could be the conceivable modus operandi\r\ninvolved ? Inasmuch as these latent memories of the sitter must\r\nrepresent (on the mechanistic theory) merely physiological brain\r\ntraces, we should have to assume that the subconscious mind of the\r\nentranced medium could somehow reach into the brain of the sitter,\r\nfind the right engrams, interpret them and perceive them to be\r\n\u2022certain specific \" memories \", such as a boating trip up the Thames,\r\na picnic, a passage in Kant's Critique, and so on. The very formulation of such a conception renders it so preposterous as to rule it out from serious consideration.\r\nYet it is only these physiological traces which actually exist,\r\naccording to the mechanistic theory commonly held. The memories\r\nthemselves do not exist in a mental world as entities. If they did we\r\nshould have a sort of mental reservoir\u2014as Bergson postulated. If\r\nsuch a mental world exists, we should surely have something in- capable of being explained by mechanistic physiology. But if it does not exist, then how are we to explain the telepathic transfer\r\nor \" reading \" of such memories ? Do not such facts in themselves\r\ndisprove the current theories of memory, held by practically all psychologists ? We seem to be upon the horns of a dilemma. Perhaps light may\r\nbe thrown upon this problem by further discussion of it by some of our members ? Assuredly it represents an interesting question,\r\nwhich is sadly in need of answering ! Yours etc.,\r\nHereward Carrington.\r\n246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1936\r\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I am afraid that I find myself in substantial agreement\r\nwith Dr Dingwall in his implied estimate of the Newlove Case.\r\nIn the first place there is no satisfactory demonstration that the\r\npipes in question had anything whatever to do with the boy's death.\r\nMoreover such pipes as Mr Thomas describes are exceedingly\r\ncommon in hilly districts and I feel confident that had Mr Thomas\r\napplied Feda's vague descriptions to the case of another boy who\r\nhad died from diphtheria in another district his enthusiasm would\r\nhave led him inevitably to the discovery of suspect pipes and possibly contaminated surface water into which such pipes usually drip.\r\nFurther, by giving slightly different interpretations to Feda's vague\r\nand commonplace allusions to \" animals \", \" barns with one side\r\nopen \" \" cross roads leading to a dark bridge where trains go what\r\nyou call ' expectorating ',\" etc., Mr Thomas would soon have discovered a route leading to the pipes which appeared to fit in with\r\nthe descriptions at the sittings.\r\nIndeed, almost the only question which I find intriguing in a study\r\nof these vague records is the problem of how Mrs Leonard obtained\r\nthe names \" Bentley \" and the fair approximation to the name\r\n\" Catlow.\" It would be premature however to jump to the conclusion that these names indicate supernormal knowledge on the part\r\nof the medium. For all we know to the contrary \" Bentley \" streets may be fairly common in northern or midland towns ; it is at anyrate up to Mr Thomas to demonstrate that they are not. But another\r\npossibility suggests itself. I understand that Mr. Thomas had\r\nvisited Nelson in some year previous to the sittings. May not the\r\nnames Bentley Street and Catlow have been mentioned casually in\r\nhis presence\u2014for instance by two persons in conversation together\r\nwithin his hearing ? Now if Mrs Leonard uttered names which\r\nsounded in some respects like Bentley and Catlow it seems not\r\nimpossible that the dormant subconscious associations in Mr\r\nThomas's mind might provoke an auditory illusion which would\r\nlead him to imagine that the words he heard were \" Bentley \" and\r\n\" Catelnow \". Such illusions are very common among people with\r\nnormal hearing.\r\nAs to the influence on the general trend of ideas by Mr Thomas's\r\nverbal suggestions during the sitting, this may well be quite as\r\nserious as Dr Dingwall assumes. For is it humanly possible for even an experienced sitter like Mr Thomas to make quite accurate records\r\nof all his own remarks and intonations in addition to recording\r\nJune 1936 Correspondence 247\r\naccurately the very fluent conversation of Feda ? My own considerable experience with Mrs Garrett leads me to doubt it. I once made\r\nan experiment of allowing two shorthand writers to make a record\r\nof one of her sittings. A comparison of the typescripts showed that\r\neach had made omissions of whole phrases and of individual words.\r\nIn the case of Mrs Leonard a mechanical voice record would seem\r\nto be essential before the material is subjected to such a psychological examination as Mr Kenneth Richmond is proposing to undertake. In the absence of such records one must admire Mr Richmond's courage though not his scientific discretion.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nS. G. Soal.\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I be permitted a few words in reply to the misstatements of Miss Margaret Naumberg in the April Journal ? In our tests with Mrs Garrett, under the auspices of the A.P.I., at\r\nleast seven persons were working over her at every sitting. They\r\nwere : (1) the reader of the stimulus words, (2) the observer of the\r\ngalvanometer, (3) the stop-watch time-keeper, (4), (5) and (6), three\r\nindependent note-takers of the reaction words\u2014to ensure accuracy\r\nand agreement\u2014and (7) a note-taker of any physical reactions of the\r\nmedium and of the general rim of events during the seance. This can\r\nhardly be called a one-man show ! It was distinctly understood, before we began our sittings, that\r\nMrs Garrett was to sail June 1st, so that her time was strictly limited,\r\nand seances had to be crowded in order to get all of them into the\r\navailable time, as it was. The galvanometer was under the supervision and in charge of the\r\nbest technician procurable from the New York Medical Center ; in\r\naddition, the machine was carefully observed and inspected by two\r\nother experienced laboratory men, and also by the technician sent us from the Central Scientific Company, which manufactures the apparatus. All repeatedly checked and tested the galvanometer, but\r\ncould find nothing wrong with it. During the next sitting, however,\r\nit acted as badly as ever ! The statement is quite erroneous, therefore, that \" there was no observer or technician available to restore it to working order \". Against the above concrete facts, Miss Naumberg quotes, by way\r\nof proving her statements, the \" memories \" of the medium\u2014and\r\n248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1936\r\n\" memories \" of events which transpired in her absence, of which she\r\nknew, and was supposed to know, nothing ! Very truly yours,\r\nHereward Carrington\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I contribute to the discussion on the oriental\r\nflavour of Feda's word association responses ? I have been engaged\r\nin medical work in India for many years and for some of these years\r\nin a hill state near Simla.\r\nI disagree with Bishop Western in some points to which he refers\r\nin his letter in the April number of the Journal. For instance, he\r\nsays that in North India the association with mango would be not\r\n\" hot \" but \" coolness and refreshment \". This is the European\r\nidea, but it is one of the strongest and firmest beliefs of the Indian\r\nwoman that the mango is \" heating \". There is, during the mango\r\nseason, a great outbreak of boils and skin troubles and the women\r\nlay the blame on the heating properties of the mango. Reference\r\nto \" mango boil \" is found in old-fashioned textbooks of tropical\r\nmedicine such as Moore's Family Medicine.\r\nAs regards the remark about \" curry \", my experience is that\r\nthe Indian woman in her home usually speaks of \" kari \" (curry)\r\ntaking the word '* bhat \" (rice) for granted. It is rather the Indian\r\ncook serving Europeans who talks about \" kari bhat \".\r\nIt is true, as Bishop Western says, that saris are generally bought,\r\nnowadays. But someone weaves them in the factory. In 1800\r\nthere were no factories and the saris were no doubt woven at home\r\non a hand loom. It is not correct to say that Musalman women\r\n\" never wear a veil of any sort \". The \" burqa \" is only worn outside or when receiving men at home ; in the house, when in the\r\nfamily circle, the Musalman woman wears the loose trousers, shirt\r\nand \" chader \" or shawl over the head, which is drawn over the face\r\nwhen she feels shy.\r\nIt is true that there are words among the responses which appear\r\nunlikely for a woman living in 1800, such as missionary. But, if the\r\nassumption is correct, that Feda is the spirit of an Indian woman\r\nwho passed over many years ago, is it not possible that she has\r\nmingled with spirits passing over later and has learned of the enor- mous expansion of missionary work in her old country and of the\r\nassociation the term certainly has with justice ? Yours, etc.,\r\nM. I. Balfour, M.B.\r\nJr>-E 1936 Correspondence 249\r\nThe \" Vita Nuova ;\r\n' Case\r\nTo the Hon. Editor o\/The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014It is refreshing to find that we bid fair to have a\r\ncollator of scripts among us once more, and I do not decry the value\r\nof Mr Kenneth Richmond's masterly paper in saying that I do not\r\nthink the\r\n'\r\n' threes\r\n\"\r\n' episode very convincing.\r\nIn the first place this sort of thing is more characteristic of Myers.\r\nThen Mrs Salter's earlier script \" The bridge and the river\u2014\r\nMisericordiam Domini \" is very strongly suggestive of Hood's\r\n\" Bridge of Sighs \", borne out by the later script perhaps : \" An\r\narch and a bridge over a river\u2014\" not the bridge of sighs, but it is a\r\nreal bridge \" (my italics) . . . .'\r\n; a triple arch \". \" A real bridge \"\r\n\r\ni.e. not the poem \\ A real triple arched bridge associated with Dante (Florence) is surely the bridge over the Arno.\r\n\" Triple-arched \" at first suggested to me a well-known verse in\r\nKeats' Eve of St Agnes \" (a casement high and triple arched there\r\nwas).\r\nIn this poem there are certainly 3 principal characters : it is perhaps a\r\n\" stretch \" to say the same of the Bridge-builders ! So Keats' would have done equally well ? Yours, etc.,\r\nErnest S. Thomas.\r\nThe Scarcity of Spontaneous Cases\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I am glad to see that the Journal is now discussing the\r\nscarcity of cases spontaneously offered to the S.P.R. I venture to\r\nthink that this scarcity may be largely due to the treatment which\r\nthe bearers of tales about the supernatural too often receive from the\r\nofficials of the Society. To get such tales sent in. it is necessary to\r\nshow sympathy and a great deal of tact. In the early days of the\r\nSociety, G-urney and Myers developed an admirable skill in collecting\r\nmaterial. But in recent years the official attitude has changed, and\r\nhardly any evidence is now considered collectible. The result is that\r\nevidence is no longer offered spontaneously.\r\nThere is also a subtle logical error, which has long vitiated the\r\nmethods of the Society, to which Mr Heaton draws attention in his\r\nletter in the April Journal. It is at bottom a mistake about the nature\r\nof scientific method. The old logic assumed that single cases could be\r\nobtained which would absolutely prove a scientific hypothesis. But\r\n250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1936\r\nnowadays scientific logicians recognize that inductive \" proof \" is always cumulative, and only yields growing probabilities. Hence\r\nwhat we should look for is evidence that will gradually grow more\r\nprobable. But if we insist on using a logical canon which rejects\r\nevery piece of evidence as \" inconclusive \", as it arises, we can make\r\nno scientific progress.\r\nIf our present President could persuade our Secretariat that cases\r\nfar from \" cogent \" may yet be worth collecting, and that some of\r\nthese cases are in various ways interesting and worth publishing (if\r\nnecessary with critical annotations), I feel sure that the scarcity of\r\nspontaneous cases could be diminished, without detracting from the\r\nscientific standing of the Society, and with great benefit to its popularity, and so to its numbers and resources.\r\nI am,\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nF. C. S. Schiller.\r\nREVIEW\r\nTowards a Method of Evaluating Mediumistic Material. By J.. G.\r\nPratt. Bulletin XXIII, Boston Society for Psychical Research,\r\nInc.\r\nTo those of our members who have been feeling a little anxious at\r\nthe prolonged silence of the Boston Society the publication of this\r\nBulletin, with its foreword by Dr Gardner Murphy, will come as a\r\nrelief. With the lamented death of Dr Walter Prince it was impossible entirely to repress a doubt whether the Society would be\r\nable to continue its work in which he took so great and able a part.\r\nDr Murphy dispels this doubt and shows that although the character\r\nof the work may change it is still capable of performing much useful\r\nservice. This is a matter for congratulation, for scientific psychical\r\nresearch can ill afford to lose any supporter, much less one of the\r\ncalibre of the Boston Society. Mr Pratt's work is based upon two\r\nseries of sittings with Mrs Eileen Garrett which took place under the\r\nauspices of the Parapsychological branch of the Department of\r\nPsychology, Duke University, being part of a programme of research\r\nto be carried out under the guidance of Dr J. B. Rhine.\r\nThe problem which Mr Pratt sets himself is to discover some\r\nmethod by which it can be determined whether the relevance for\r\nthe subject of what is said by the medium in trance is greater than can be attributed to chance.\r\nHe commences by examining briefly the methods which I adopted\r\nJune 1936 Review 251\r\nin my report on the Warren Elliott case and he, quite rightly, points\r\nto a weakness therein, viz., the method of allowing for the differences\r\nin the annotators in respect to the \" will to believe \", that is to say,\r\nto find veridicality in the record, and the \" will to disbelieve \". As a matter of historical fact I did not entirely neglect this point,\r\nit is mentioned specifically in the preface to my report, but I am\r\nhappy to confess that Mr Pratt's method of dealing with it seems\r\nto me to be a considerable improvement on my own. It is more\r\nobjective, being based on a comparison of the subject's annotations\r\nof a number of records referring to other sitters with those of his own\r\nproper sitting ; whereas my method was subjective inasmuch as\r\nit depended solely on my judgement of the allowance to be made for\r\nthe peculiarity of each individual sitter in this respect.\r\nIn the second series dealt with by Mr Pratt a further step was\r\ntaken in that the whole set of records was annotated by each sitter\r\nin ignorance of which particular sitting was his own. This seems to\r\nme to be a most valuable addition to the technique of evaluating\r\nmediumistic material and is one which should be adopted wherever\r\npossible.\r\nThere is not space in a review to deal adequately with the various\r\npoints raised by Mr Pratt or to attempt to offer any detailed com- ment or constructive criticism, but there are two points which I feel that I must mention.\r\nFirst. That the method of itemising the reports of the sittings\r\nin such a fashion that the annotations are reduced to \" yes \", \" no\r\n\"\r\nor \" unknown \" may possibly be considered to be an undue simplification of the material.\r\nI must apologise for again mentioning my own work, but I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that if the sitter be allowed, in fact encouraged, to\r\ngive full details of the verifying event or circumstances, as was done\r\nin the Warren Elliott case, a better judgement of veridicality can be formed. I was inclined to distrust a plain '' yes \" and always\r\nwanted details. Sometimes these details, when furnished, led me to\r\nreject the affirmative answer in the case of sitters whose \" will to\r\nbelieve \" appeared to me to be unduly strong.\r\nThe second point is that Mrs Garrett's trance utterances, judging\r\nfrom the samples quoted in the Bulletin, appear to be far more prolific in the matter of names than is the case with most mediums.\r\nWhere a name or names, together with some five or six descriptive\r\ndetails, is correctly given the anti-chance value may be very high\r\nindeed, particularly if the name should be an unusual one. The\r\nplain \" yes \" or \" no \" scoring hardly allows for this. This point\r\n252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 193$\r\nbrings in the question of \" grouping \" which has assumed such importance in E.S.P. work.\r\nMr Pratt's method of determining the probability of any particular\r\nstatement being true for anyone in general is also objective and is based on the annotation of records by persons to whom they do not\r\nrefer, in a manner somewhat similar to what I called my \" chance\r\nexperiment \". Besides actual sitters whole sets of records were\r\nannotated by persons entirely outside the experiment. It has the\r\nadvantage of giving a perfectly definite figure for probability but\r\nI am still rather inclined to like the idea of a\r\n\" Committee \". Experience has shown me that talking things over does lead to a clarifi- cation of ideas and, as a rule, to some agreed figure for probability.\r\nPerhaps the two methods could be combined. Of the actual results\r\nof the experiment I will not speak, its importance lies for the most\r\npart in the methods.\r\nI think that Mr Pratt is to be congratulated for having made a\r\nnotable contribution to this important subject, Dr Rhine for his\r\nshare in the work and for his interesting analysis printed at the\r\nend of the Bulletin and the authorities of Duke University, again\r\nspecially including Dr Rhine, for setting on foot and encouraging\r\nthese researches. I trust that we may look forward to further\r\ncommunications from the same source. H. F. S.\r\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS\r\nBulletin II of the University of London Council for PsychicaL\r\nInvestigation (price 5s. net) contains a report by Mr Price on Kuda\r\nBux's fire-walk, with twenty illustrations and a bibliography.\r\nThis fire-walk, as performed in England last year in the presence\r\nof Mr Price and others, differed considerably from the fire-walk\r\nas frequently reported from India. Explanations of immunity\r\nfrom burning applicable to the conditions of the Indian fire-walk\r\ndo not seem to fit the English experiments. In these, for example,\r\nthere was no top layer of cool ashes to act as a non-conductor : Kuda Bux's feet were not calloused, and so far from their having\r\nbeen moistened beforehand, they seem to have been particularly dry\r\nthroughout. Mr Price concludes that the dryness of the feet, due\r\nto self-suggestion, was the principal cause of Kuda Bux's success- in the particular conditions of the test. Perhaps his light weight.\r\nwas a contributing factor. W. H.

Tyrrell, 6 Carlton Hill, N.W. 8.\r\nIN MEMORIAM\r\nWe have to record with much regret the death of one Member and\r\ntwo Associates of the Society, all of long standing.\r\nMiss Alice Balfour, a sister of Mrs Sidgwick and of Lord Balfour, was elected a Member in December 1882, the year of the\r\nSociety's foundation, and came very near therefore to being an\r\noriginal Member. Like others of her distinguished family she combined an interest in psychical research with interest in natural\r\nscience, and although she had not in recent years taken an active\r\npart in the Society's work, she was throughout a keen supporter of\r\nits policy and made some contributions to early numbers of the\r\nJournal.\r\nMiss F. Melian Stawell, who was elected an Associate in\r\nNovember 1908 and an Honorary Associate in 1921, was a classical\r\nscholar of much distinction and made valuable contributions in the\r\nJuly 1936 In Memoriam 255\r\nfields of literature and philosophy. She was deeply interested in the\r\nproblems of psychical research, especially in the problem of survival,\r\nand was at all times ready to bring her eager and yet critical mind\r\nto bear upon any evidence that was presented to her. One of her\r\nearliest contributions to our publications was a critical discussion in\r\nthe Journal, Vol. xiv, p. 231, on \" The Naples Report on Eusapia\r\nPalladino,\" and she contributed to Proceedings, Vol. xxix, p. 260, a criticism of the evidence for survival set forth in Lord Balfour's\r\npaper on \" The Ear of Dionysius,\" to which Lord Balfour replied at\r\nlength, describing her criticism as \"of that serious and thoughtful\r\nkind that helps to throw light upon a problem even when one cannot agree with it.\" I remember Miss Stawell first when she was a classical student at\r\nNewnham College and I was still a child. She stands in my memory\r\nas an almost legendary figure of prowess in scholarship, having been\r\none of the small band of women to be placed in Class I, Division I of\r\nthe Classical Tripos. One of my last and clearest recollections of\r\nher was at the Jubilee Meeting of the Society in July 1932, when she\r\ntold me how deeply impressed she had been by Mrs Sidgwick's\r\ndeclaration (made on her behalf by Lord Balfour) of belief in survival\r\nand the possibility of communciation with the dead, and how greatly\r\nshe regretted that her old friend Lowes Dickinson had not been able\r\nto hear it made. Lowes Dickinson died in August 1932 and Miss\r\nStawell contributed an obituary notice of him to the Journal,\r\nVol. xxvii, p. 322.\r\nMr E. S. Thomas, Curator during the last years of his life of the\r\nPitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, was elected an Associate in December\r\n1907. He made frequent and valuable contributions both to Journal and Proceedings : among these may be mentioned \" A\r\nDream Memory Recovered after many Years,\" Jour., Vol. xxi,\r\np. 296, \" Notes on a Sitting with Mrs Brittain,\" Jour., Vol. xxvi,\r\np. 135, \" A Series of Mediumistic Statements made to four Sitters,\"\r\nJour., Vol. xxvii, p. 74, \" The Fire Walk,\" Proc, Vol. xlii, p. 292.\r\nHe also contributed numerous reviews and letters, mainly concerned\r\nwith the question of survival in relation to telepathy. Officers of\r\nthe Society can testify to the kindly and willing help he gave them\r\nwhenever occasion arose. He was at the time of his death President of the Oxford Society\r\nfor Psychical Research and took part in the recent investigation at\r\nOxford into the phenomena of \" The Flower Medium.\"\r\nH. de G. S.\r\n256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1936\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nProxy Sittings and a Query regarding D. D. Home\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of the Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I fear that my letter in the April Journal regarding the\r\nproxy sittings produced the emotional reactions that I hoped would\r\nbe avoided. I tried not to give offence to the faithful, asking if I might \" venture to suggest \" and mentioning a principle, which \" I suspected \" ran through the mental phenomena. Nevertheless, in\r\nspite of these tentative feelers, Mr Richmond says that I make declarations and Miss Gibbes tells me that I have made astonishing\r\nassertions which are of the most preposterous kind.\r\nMy friend Mr Richmond evidently thinks that the evidence for\r\nintention on the part of the communicators in the pipes episode of\r\nthe Newlove Case is strong, but I regret that I do not agree with him.\r\nNeither do the cases mentioned by Miss Gibbes appear to me to\r\ndemand the importance that she attaches to them ; although I admit\r\nfreely that I am not acquainted with the full details. In the first instance it would seem that consultation of an obituary notice\r\nmight be a good start.\r\nI do not intend in this place, however, to ask you to print the\r\nevidence on which I base my suspicions. My original letter was\r\nintended rather as a hint to those of us still unconvinced, in spite of\r\nthe flood of spiritualistic propaganda, however academic its modern\r\nappearance may be.\r\nAnd now, Madam, may I be permitted to crave the assistance of\r\nyour readers in another matter. But let me assure them in advance\r\nthat my query is not intended as an example of what is, I understand,\r\nnow so inelegantly styled the \" Debunking of Daniel \". For some months past I have been trying to discover where the\r\nfamous levitation of D. D. Home took place on that memorable\r\nevening of December 13th, 1868.\r\nLord Dunraven tells us that it was at Ashley House, Victoria St.,\r\nLondon (see Proc. S.P.R., XXXV, p. 153). He stated the same thing\r\nin the Weekly Dispatch of March 21st, 1920. It will also be remembered that the heading of the report in the Experiences states that it was at 5 Buckingham Gate.\r\nWhat does not seem generally known, however, is the fact that\r\nLord Dunraven seems to have sent a written account with plan to\r\nSir F. C. Burnand, in whose archives it was preserved. Here we\r\nlearn that the rooms were on the first floor and that the windows\r\nfaced one another, being on opposite sides of a triangle. In the\r\nExperiences we are told that the rooms were on the third floor\r\nJuly 1936 Correspondence 257\r\n{op. ext., p. 156) and there is no mention of the position of the\r\nwindows.\r\nNow I am unable to discover if any structural alterations have\r\nbeen made in Ashley House since 1868. The fact remains that to-day\r\nthere does not seem to be any arrangement of windows to correspond\r\nwith the plan mentioned above ; nor does this arrangement seem to\r\nexist in Buckingham Gate.\r\nCan any of your readers, therefore, let me know if they remember\r\nany such arrangement at Ashley House ? If not, how are we to\r\naccount for these discrepancies, apart altogether from the new\r\nlight that this arrangement of windows sheds on this nineteenth\r\ncentury miracle ? Yours etc.,\r\nE. J. Dingwall.\r\nThe Newlove Case\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of the Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014In the Journal for June my friend Mr S. G. Soal writes\r\nabout the Newlove communications. He makes a special point of\r\nthe possibility that subconscious associations provoked in me an\r\nauditory illusion which led me to imagine that the words spoken in\r\nthe sitting were Bentley and Catlenow.\r\nThe obvious inference would be that the evidential value of these\r\nnames is suspect.\r\nThe facts can be quite simply stated. These names were not taken\r\ndown by me, but by the expert stenographer who had, at that date,\r\naccompanied me to Leonard sittings for exactly four years. It was\r\nshe who set down the names as she heard them pronounced, and\r\nthey meant no more to her than they did to me.\r\nIt is regrettable that so experienced and conscientious a re- searcher as Mr Soal should reject sober facts in favour of easy but\r\nmisleading speculations.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nC. Drayton Thomas.\r\nThe Study of the Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's\r\nMediumship\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of the Journal\r\nDear Madam,\u2014Lord Balfour has very kindly given me permission to send to you for publication in the Journal the most\r\ninteresting letter which he wrote to me in reply to mine which\r\nappeared in the March number. He himself does not wish to dis-\r\n258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1936\r\ncuss the subject any further as he thinks it all so obscure and\r\ndifficult that no advantage would be gained thereby. I feel sure, however, that all your readers will welcome the opportunity to\r\nlearn more of his views on this most important subject.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\r\nAn Open Letter to Mr Saltmarsh\r\nDear Mr Saltmarsh,\u2014I have read with much interest your letter\r\nin the Journal of the S.P.R. for March 1936 on the subject of my re- cent Paper on the Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's mediumship.\r\nAs you truly say, the Paper raises questions of importance not only\r\nfor Psychical Research, but also for Psychology and Metaphysics.\r\nWhat you call the Monadic Theory of Human Personality may\r\ntake more than one form according to the extent of the scope\r\nclaimed for it. But even in its most limited form it is bound to\r\nprovoke the kind of questions you ask. I will do my best to provide\r\nthe further enlightenment for which you plead. But the subject\r\nis obscure, and I have to confess that the conundrums you propound\r\nleave me also for the most part guessing, and unable to do more than\r\nmake suggestions or indicate lines of thought.\r\nIn the limited form which it assumes in my Paper the hypothesis\r\nconsists in substituting a group of true selves or monads telepathically interacting with each other, for the single unitary self of the\r\ncommonly accepted view. In the normal human being one of these\r\nselves is dominant and in sole control of the organism as a whole.\r\nThis dominant monad the hypothesis identifies with the \" me as I know myself.\" Your first question is, Who then are the subordinate\r\nmonads, the other conscious selves ? Are they also me, but not me\r\nas I know myself ? I may have misapprehended the precise point you wish to raise,\r\nbut surely this is not one of the many comparatively speaking side\r\nissues started by the hypothesis so much as a request to make the\r\nhypothesis itself more explicit. If so, I can only repeat what I hoped I had made sufficiently clear in my Paper, that the subordinate\r\nselves are none of them the \" me \" as I know myself, but in virtue of\r\ntheir association with the dominant me and with the organism they\r\nare, together with the organism, contributing factors in the personality which finds its resultant expression in the individual man. Each of the monads I conceive to be a\r\n\" me,\" conscious of itself as\r\nin close relation with the organism, but not in control of the organism as a whole. The subordinate members of the group interact\r\ntelepathically with the dominant self, and presumably with each\r\nJuly 1936 Correspondence 259\r\nother. But it has to be admitted that in normal experiencedreaming may be an exception\u2014the dominant self is not conscious\r\nof the interaction as an active influence, nor aware of the existence\r\nof other psychical units associated with itself and capable of being\r\na telepathic source of modifications in its own thought-content. It\r\nis one of the serious weaknesses of the hypothesis that the evidence\r\nin favour of it rests so largely on the phenomena of abnormal psychology.\r\nYou next ask whether the hypothesis assumes that the subordinate selves are capable of existing, in any circumstances, apart\r\nfrom the association. In my view the hypothesis neither assumes\r\ncapacity for independent existence on the part of the subordinate\r\nselves nor excludes it. Whether even the \" me as I know myself \"\r\ncan exist independently of the body must still be regarded as an\r\nopen question. To decide whether the subordinate monads can have\r\nan independent existence apart from the body, from the dominant\r\nself, and from each other, must be a yet more difficult problem.\r\nMonadic pluralism might still hold good of human personality\r\nwhichever alternative we adopt.\r\nOn p. 275 of my Paper 1 1 have permitted myself a bold excursion\r\ninto the realm of conjecture. The passage I refer to follows one which\r\nyou yourself have quoted in your letter. I give the paragraph in full\r\n:\r\n\" My own instinctive conviction is that my true self is the ' me as\r\nI know myself,' and that it will be as this me, with its formed character and stored memories, that I shall survive, if survival there be.\r\nOther selves co-conscious with ' me as I know myself ' may also\r\nsurvive. If so, it is permissible to hazard a guess that as they have\r\napparently co-operated when in the body, so they, or some of them,\r\nmay continue to co-operate when no longer in the body, and that\r\neach of us may find himself in the ' metetherial ' world the member of\r\na group of selves with which he has already, when in the body, been\r\nassociated in closer relation than with the rest of his environment.\"\r\nSpeculations of this kind are evidently fanciful.\r\nYour third question is, \" Are the subordinate monads permanent\r\nmembers of the association, or is there a process of change there\r\nanalogous to that of cells composing a living organism ? ... If\r\nso, where do they go, and whence do the new ones come ? \"\r\nHere again it seems to me that any attempt to answer the question\r\nmust, in our present state of knowledge, rest upon pure conjecture.\r\nYou refer in this connection to a suggestion put forward by Professor\r\nMcDougall in his Presidential Address (but not, I think, repeated\r\nin his Outline of Abnormal Psychology), that the dominant monad\r\n1 S.P.R. Proc. 1935, Part 140, Vol. XLIII.\r\n260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1936\r\nis \" not only the ruler of his society, but also the patriarch and\r\nprogenitor,\" and that \" the monads are propagated by a process\r\nanalogous to budding.\" This suggestion may not be wholly wide\r\nof the mark, but for myself I prefer to take refuge in a confession\r\nof complete ignorance. I may, however, observe that the question\r\nitself is more apposite to the form of the hypothesis as expounded\r\nby McDougall than to the more limited form of it which is all I have\r\nargued for in my Paper. This same remark applies also to your\r\nnext two questions. This will appear more clearly when I come to\r\nyour question (5).\r\nQuestion (4). \" The dominant monad \" you say, \" being a complete self, possesses cognitive and affective-volitional faculties, it has its own proper train of memory. Does it perceive the external\r\nworld directly ? Can it employ the entire mechanism of the physical,\r\nincluding the sense organs, or does it make contact with its external\r\nenvironment only by deputy through the subordinate monads ? \" When one mind apprehends the thought of another mind, I should\r\nregard the perception as being direct, but your question refers to\r\nperception of the external world. Sensory perception would cer- tainly appear to be mediate, though even here I should hesitate to\r\nmake the dogmatic assertion that no element of direct apprehension\r\nby the dominant monad enters into the process.\r\nQuestion (5). The subordinate monads, you say, being selves \" presumably enjoy possession of the full complement of mental\r\nfaculties : do they also have full run of the physical organism or are they specialised as to function ? I gather from Prof. McDougall's\r\naccount that the latter view is correct, so that the subordinate\r\nmonads should, strictly speaking, be considered as less than complete selves, ranging from those in the hierarchy nearest to the\r\ndominant, which would be nearly complete, down to the lowest\r\norders whose specialised function is, say, some simple reflex.\"\r\nThis paragraph of your letter raises far-reaching questions, of\r\nwhich I was well aware, though I excluded consideration of them\r\nfrom my study of Mrs Willett's mediumship. By way of comment\r\nI should like to begin by referring to a passage near the end of my\r\nPaper. After summarizing the constituent factors in human\r\npersonality as consisting of the dominant self, the subordinate selves,\r\nand the bodily organism, I continue as follows : \" I make no attempt to carry my analysis further, or to try to\r\nimagine in detail how the different factors in human personality\r\nwork together to produce unity and order. Any such attempt would\r\ninvolve an enquiry not only into the relation of mind to mind, but\r\nof mind to body, with the metaphysical problem of the relation of\r\nJuly 1936 Correspondence 261\r\nmind and matter looming in the background. In this Paper I have\r\nconfined myself all but entirely to the direct relation of mind to\r\nmind, a subject the systematic investigation of which may almost\r\nbe said to date from the foundation of the Society for Psychical\r\nResearch. ... I have tried to find a place for the principle of tele- pathy within the structure of human personality ; and convinced as\r\nI am that the true explanation of the lower is to be sought in the\r\nhigher, and not of the higher in the lower, I am not without hope\r\nthat the same principle, in a modified form, may be found applicable\r\nto the relation of mind to body also.\"\r\nIt will be understood from the above passage that I deliberately\r\nrestricted the scope of the monadic hypothesis so far as the treatment\r\nof it in my Paper is concerned. The monads I had in view were\r\nminds, true selves, self-conscious Egos, comparable in every way\r\nto the \" me as I know myself,\" and capable of telepathic communication with each other similar to that which we have valid grounds\r\nfor believing to take place between different individual human\r\nbeings, and some evidence for believing may take place between\r\nincarnate and discarnate minds. By thus limiting the application\r\nof the hypothesis I escaped the task of dealing with the difficulties\r\nraised by your question number 5, and inherent in the conception\u2014\r\nwhich inevitably suggests itself\u2014of a hierarchy of monads arranged\r\nin a descending scale of mentality, whose lowest members are hardly,\r\nif at all distinguishable from the elements that form the material\r\norganism. I readily admit the formidable nature of these difficulties,\r\nbut anything like an adequate examination of them would require\r\nknowledge to which I have no pretension, and involve an incursion\r\ninto metaphysics which cannot be attempted here.\r\nI am glad to note that in spite of the perplexing questions which the\r\nmonadic hypothesis suggests to you, you are not disposed to reject\r\nit off-hand, but on the contrary seem to think that a prima facie case has been made out for it. Indeed you go so far in the direction\r\nof approval as to consider it worth while to propose an amendment\r\nin the scheme in its present form in order to meet what you feel to\r\nbe a serious objection to one particular point in it. You accept the\r\nidentification of the \" me as I know myself \" with the dominant self,\r\ni.e., with the self that is in general control of the body, but would\r\nsuperpose upon it other selves as inferior to it in the mental scale\r\n(measured by the possession of supernormal powers) , as the dominant\r\n\"me\" is to the subordinate monads. \" The weight of evidence\r\npoints,\" you say, \" to there being a certain amount of dissociation in\r\nthe large majority of cases of supernormal mental phenomena,\" and\r\ntherefore to these powers being in the main exercised by other selves\r\n262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1936\r\nthan the \" me as I know myself.\" And the inference you draw is that these other selves must be regarded as superior rather than\r\nsubordinate to the dominant self in virtue of their possessing tele- pathic faculty in a higher degree.\r\nI content myself with indicating what appears to me to be one weak point in this reasoning. You are evidently thinking of tele- pathic communications between minds external to one another in\r\nthe sense of belonging to different individuals\u2014what I have called\r\nin my Paper \" exterior communications.\" But it is of the essence\r\nof my hypothesis that \" interior communications,\" i.e., communications between selves associated together in the same body, are\r\nalso telepathic. There is no ground for believing that\u2014as regards\r\nthe interior, or inter-monadic, telepathy\u2014the dominant monad is inferior in capacity to the subordinate monads. The contrary would\r\nrather seem probable. To make your inference valid ; the dictum\r\nthat the capacity for exterior communications is exhibited in a higher degree by the subordinate monads than by the dominant\r\nmonad would have to be supplemented by the further dictum that\r\nexterior communications imply a higher mental activity than intermonadic communications.\r\nThe amended version of my hypothesis is not inconsistent with\r\nits central tenet, namely that co-conscious selves must be regarded\r\nas distinct psychical units, and not as strata or phases of a single\r\nself. But frankly, it does not commend itself to me. So far as concerns general control of the body the superiority of the dominant\r\nself is undisputed : its inferiority in the matter of telepathic faculty\r\nis uncertain and may be only apparent. If your monads of the\r\nhighest rank are not in some sense subordinate to the dominant\r\nmonad, it is difficult to see in what their association with the body\r\ncan consist. They would seem to be something in the nature of\r\nguardian angels.\r\nI fear I have troubled you with a long and not very illuminating\r\nscreed, but your sympathetic reception of my ideas is my excuse for\r\ninflicting it on you.\r\nBelieve me to be, Ar . , Yours sincerely,J \u201e\r\nBalfour.\r\nThe Study op Leonard Communications\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of the Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014Surely Mr Soal's may-have-beens will have occurred to\r\nany critical reader of the Newlove case. I need only note that he\r\nbuilds from one assumption to another, all of them dependent on a\r\nJuly 1936 Correspondence 263\r\nfurther assumption that the records are faulty in not containing\r\nevidence for what he assumes. His positive and useful contribution\r\nlies in the observation that \" such pipes as Mr Thomas describes are exceedingly common in hilly districts.\"' This is a factor similar to the\r\ncommonness or rarity of a Christian name mentioned by a medium.\r\nMr Soal's general suggestion, that it is useless to undertake a\r\npsychological examination of the Leonard material in the absence\r\nof complete voice-records of everything that passed at the sittings,\r\nis not nearly complete as a counsel of perfection. If we had such\r\nrecords, they would then be insufficient without a drum-record of\r\nthe psycho-galvanometric reflex, and so on. But personally, I find\r\nmuch more ground for suspecting gaps in my own critical judgment\r\nthan in the best of the records which we possess. And my own\r\nexperience, and that of others, is not that the less accurate the\r\nrecord is, the better the ostensible evidence appears to be. With\r\nincreased signs of accuracy and completeness in the records that\r\nwe have, the evidential links appear to be more complete and coherent, and the may-have-beens fail to materialise.\r\nI can bear to dispense with \"scientific discretion\" if it means that an\r\nimperfect instrument hke the human investigator is not to make imperfect judgments from imperfect data, in an imperfect world. If it will comfort Mr Soal. let me assure him that I make no pretensions to a more exact method than is possible. His criticism is in essence perfectly sound, as far as it goes without supj)orting evidence\u2014except in\r\nthat he tends, I think, to cultivate a blind eye for the sequence and\r\nconstructive effect of what comes to expression at a sitting ; but he\r\nappears to be exaggerating a useful attitude of mind into an opinion\r\nwhich would ehminate trial and error in research and, in practice,\r\nsimply barricade the path to a better understanding of our material.\r\nI am glad of the opportunity not only to agree with, but to\r\nemphasise, the point in the late Mr Ernest Thomas's kindly letter on\r\nthe La Vita Nuova case. It would have emphasised itself, perhaps,\r\nin a different way but for a slip by which he has described as \" the\r\nlater script,\" of Mrs Salter's, what in fact was the earlier of the two\r\nbeing described in my paper as \" a much older script of hers (Feb.\r\n24th, 1916) \"\r\n\r\ni.e., more than two years before the Leonard sittings\r\nwhich supplied the La Vita Nuova material. It would have been an\r\nabsurd straining of associations if I had read into this script a prospective reference to the subsequent book-tests, and I understand that\r\nit has a quite different relevance of its own. This does not alter the\r\nfact that this script, with the phrase triple arch,\" was recalled to\r\nMrs Salter's mind by her later script, contemporary with the La\r\nVita Nuova book-tests (which script Mr Thomas has spoken of as\r\n264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1936\r\nthe \" earlier \") : nor I think does it matter that this later script\r\ncould be applied to Hood's \" One more unfortunate \"\u2014or to anyother context containing bridge, river, and pity. There is no reason\r\nso to apply it, and there is some reason for its application to the\r\n\" bridge \" references at the Leonard sitting. Further, it is a fact\r\nin evidence that the application was made, whether or not a communicator intended it to be made.\r\nYours etc.,\r\nKenneth Richmond.\r\nThe Scarcity of Spontaneous Cases\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of the Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I do not know on what grounds Prof. Schiller supposes\r\nthat \" a subtle logical error has long vitiated the policy of the\r\nSociety,\" resulting in a failure on the part of the Society's officers to\r\nrecognise the cumulative value of inductive \" jiroof.\" They mayall be presumed to be familiar with Chap. iv. of Phantasms of the\r\nLiving in which the following passage occurs (\u00a7 20) :\u2014\r\n\" It has been urged that no accumulation of instances can make up\r\na solid case, if no individual instance can be absolutely certified as\r\nfree from flaw. But the different items of inductive proof are, of\r\ncourse, not like the links of a deductive chain. The true metaphor\r\nis the sticks and the faggot ; and our right to treat any particular case as a stick depends, not on its being so flawlessly strong, as evidence for our hypothesis, that no other hypothesis can possibly\r\nbe entertained with regard to it, but on the much humbler fact that\r\nany other hypothesis involves the assumption of Something in itself improbable. Third-hand ghost-stories, and the ordinary examples\r\nof popular superstitions, have no claim to be regarded as sticks at\r\nall, since the rejection of the popular explanation of them involves no improbable assumptions of any kind : at best they are dry reeds,\r\nand no multiplication of their number could ever make a respectable\r\nfaggot.\r\n\r\nIndividual opinions will naturally vary as to the exact distinction\r\nbetween a stick and a dry reed, but a perusal of the spontaneous\r\ncases printed in the Journal of recent years, e.g. since the War, does\r\nnot suggest that the Society is attempting to set up an excessively\r\nhigh standard of faggot-value.\r\nIt should be remembered that Gurney and Myers made spontaneous telepathy a live issue, a matter of widespread interest and discussion among the educated public. Many were convinced by their\r\nargument, and unless they were members of our Society, became\r\ninclined to regard the accumulation of further instances as super-\r\nJuly 1936 Correspondence 265\r\nfluous. Others, unconvinced, continued to attribute cases of this\r\ntype to chance or other normal causes. It cannot, I think, be\r\ndoubted that, outside our membership, spontaneous telepathy no\r\nlonger arouses educated interest as it once did.\r\nBut when, by the recent B.B.C. talks, contact was made with a wider public, cases flowed in freely without, to the best of my\r\nrecollection, any complaint from the correspondents of want of\r\ntact or sympathy on the part of \" our Secretariat.\"\r\nYours etc.,\r\nW. H. Salter (Hon. Sec).\r\n[Note : Although a reasonable standard is maintained for cases printed in the Journal, it is the practice of the Society to collect\r\nand file any evidence, either in support of or against paranormal hypotheses.

London : Hamish\r\nHamilton, Ltd. 1935.\r\nThe author of this book is a scientist of world-wide fame, but, as he tells us in the first words of his preface, he is \" not a philosopher \". Yet many of the topics discussed are essentially subject-matter of\r\nphilosophical thought. The author's assertion that \" man in his\r\nentirety is located within the jurisdiction of the scientific technique \"\r\nwill not be accepted by everyone, if it is implied that scientific\r\ntechnique will prove adequate to the understanding of man in his\r\nentirety. If, however, it is merely a declaration that in the investigation of man in his entirety the methods of science should be utilised\r\nto the utmost, no scientist and no philosopher need object.\r\nThe aim of this book is to summarise all that the various sciences\r\nhave taught us regarding man's nature and to synthesize the fragmentary aspects revealed by each separate form of investigation so\r\nas to give us some inkling of what \" man in his entirety \" is like. The record of what science has taught us of man's nature is very fully\r\ntold, although only in outline, and the reader's first impression is one of wonder, not at what is unknown in man, but at the enormous mass of \" scientific data concerning the human beings of our time \". This is especially true of the chapters dealing with the body and\r\nphysiological activities, and in the account of the adaptive functions\r\nwhich are essential for man's life and development. Concerning\r\nthese departments of knowledge the author's complaint is not so much that we do not know enough, but that we fail to make use of\r\n266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1936\r\nthe knowledge we already have, with the result that man is not even now all that he might be.\r\nDr Carrel's exposition of the science of man in so far as it relates\r\nto the body and physiological activities is easily recognisable as the\r\nwork of an expert, but when he comes to deal with mental activities\r\nand the mind's place in nature the hand of the amateur is revealed.\r\nHe reiterates many times his opinion that psychology is not a science,\r\nalthough in the end he so far forgets himself as to refer to it as \" the\r\nsupreme science \". It would seem, however, that he has little acquaintance with modern psychology, and little understanding of\r\nthe part it is destined to play in that \" remaking of man \" which he\r\nfeels to be so necessary for the future of humanity.\r\nHe makes an arbitrary division of mental activities into intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and religious. Under intellectual activities\r\nhe gives a prominent place to intuition as a means of acquiring\r\nknowledge. In one aspect, he says, intuition takes place quite\r\nindependently of observation and reasoning, and adds that \" this\r\nmode of knowledge is closely analogous to clairvoyance, to the sixth sense of Charles Richet.\" He expresses his firm belief in the occur- rence of clairvoyance and telepathy and tells us that his belief is based upon his own observations and experiments rather than uponthe opinion of others. Indeed he would seem to have but a poor\r\nopinion of the work of others in this field of investigation, and he\r\nmakes the astonishing claim that \" experimenters trained in clinical\r\nmedicine . . . are alone qualified to investigate this subject.\"\r\nIn writing of religious activities, which he regards as synonymouswith mystical activities he gives expression, here also, to opinions\r\nwhich are far from being generally accepted in the world of science.\r\nHe tells us that he became interested in asceticism and \" mysticity\r\n\"\r\nat the same time as in metapsychical phenomena, that he has knowna few genuine mystics and saints, and that he considers it impossible\r\nnot to count mysticism among fundamental human activities. Hebelieves that certain spiritual activities may cause anatomical as well as functional modifications of the tissues and organs ; as, for\r\nexample, in the miracles of Lourdes. Unfortunately he presents none of the evidence on which his belief is based.\r\nThe main theme of the book is that whereas the sciences of inert\r\nmatter have made immense progress, those of living beings remain in a rudimentary state. The directions in which science has developed\r\nhave led to\r\n'\r\n' the brutal materialism of our civilization\r\n'\r\n' andmodern conditions of life have brought about a\r\n\" state of intellectual,\r\nmoral and physiological atrophy \". Dr Carrel is writing as a citizen of America and he takes as a text\r\nJuly 1936 Reviews 267\r\nfor his thesis on the need for\r\n' ; the remaking of man \" the sudden\r\ncollapse of \" the superb edifice of American finance and economics \".\r\nIt is in this connection that he asks :\r\n' : Has not modern life decreased\r\nthe intelligence and morality of the whole nation \" ? and he thinks\r\n\" the day has come to begin the work of our renovation \". And\r\nnotwithstanding his insistence on our ignorance of man's true nature\r\nand being he declares that \" to-day the science of man gives us the\r\npower to develop all the potentialities of our body. We know the\r\nsecret mechanisms of our physiological and mental activities and\r\nthe causes of our weakness. We know how we have transgressed\r\nnatural laws. We know why we are punished, why we are lost in\r\ndarkness. Nevertheless we faintly perceive through the mists of\r\ndawn a path which may lead to our salvation.\"\r\nThis book has been written with a purpose, \" for those who are bold enough to understand the necessity, not only of mental,\r\npolitical and social changes, but of the overthrow of industrial\r\ncivilisation and of the advent of another conception of human\r\nprogress.\" T. W. Mitchell.\r\nAdmiral Telemachus Kourmoulis. The Hallucinations of Logocratia. Pp. 243. Athens : Kyklos. 1936.\r\nAdmiral Kourmoulis's book does not indeed touch very closely on\r\npsychical research, but treats of philosophical, psychological and\r\nethical problems, which every student of psychical research has\r\nprobably meditated upon. In the preface the author defines\r\nLogocratia as \" every period in the world including the period in\r\nwhich we are living now . . . during which philosophising people are not able to discern the existence in us of any other data of purely\r\ncognitive purpose than the data of experience.\" The only thinkers\r\nof importance who have been free from the fallacies inherent in\r\nmost philosophical systems are, according to the author.

N\r\n270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octobee1936\r\nOBITUARY\r\nSydney Charles Scott\r\nBy the death of Sydney Charles Scott on September 18, at the age\r\nof 86, the Society has sustained a loss far greater than most of our Members and Associates can have realized, for, with few exceptions,\r\nit is only members of the Council who have been in a position to\r\nappreciate the value and the full extent of his services.\r\nHis membership of the Society, which dates from October or November, 1884, lasted nearly 52 years.\r\nCo-opted as a member of Council on March 6, 1891, he served on\r\nit until his death\u2014a period of over 45 years.\r\nHe was appointed a member of the Finance Committee (now\r\ncalled the House and Finance Committee) in January 1892, and\r\nremained a member of it till the end of 1934, when increasing age\r\nmade it necessary for him to limit his activities.\r\nHe was one of the trustees of the Endowment Fund from the\r\nformation of the Trust down to the time of his death.\r\nOn January 31, 1922, in recognition of his services to the Society\r\nhe was elected a Vice-President.\r\nThis dull and formal record will convey little to the reader ; nor can I hope to do more than give some indications of the amount of\r\nwork that he did for the S.P.R., and of his efficiency and generosity.\r\nWhile I cannot state it as a positive fact, I believe it to be the\r\ncase that the Council have more often placed on record their gratitude to Scott than to any other member past or present. Thus, to\r\ncite some instances :\r\n\r\nAt the Annual Business Meeting held on January 25, 1895,\r\n\" thanks were accorded to Mr H. Arthur Smith and Mr Sydney C.\r\nScott for the work they had done [in connection with the Incorporation of the Society] up to that time. The indebtedness of the\r\nSociety to Messrs Smith and Scott is greatly increased by the\r\nefficient manner in which the Incorporation has been carried out,\r\nand by their kindness in saving much expense which would otherwise have been unavoidable \". On November 1, 1895, the Council record \" the great indebtedness\r\nof the Society \" to Mr H. A. Smith and Mr S. C. Scott \" for the\r\nlarge amount of time and labour which they have devoted to carrying through the Incorporation of the Society, and which has enabled\r\nit to be completed at much less cost than would otherwise have\r\nbeen the case \". On December 12, 1922, the Council placed on record '*' their\r\nappreciation of Mr Scott's generosity in conducting the legal\r\nOctober 1936 Obituary 271\r\nbusiness relative to the acquisition of the Society's new premises\r\n[31 Tavistock Square] without charge to the Society \". In the Annual Keport for 1923 gratitude is again expressed to\r\nMr Scott for carrying out other legal business free of charge.\r\nOnce more, on March 18, 1931, the Council accorded warm thanks\r\nto Mr Scott \" for the trouble he had taken and the expense he had\r\nsaved the Society \" in connexion with another matter, and also \" for general legal advice \". Finally in the Annual Report for 1935 we read with reference to\r\na renewal of the lease of 31 Tavistock Square : \" As on many\r\nprevious occasions the Council wishes most cordially to thank Mr\r\nSydney Scott for conducting the legal business involved \". Yet the services for which Scott received the formal thanks of\r\nCouncil or of an Annual General Meeting by no means exhaust the\r\nlist, for he rendered many others known only to successive Hon.\r\nSecretaries and to some of the other officers of the Society.\r\nWhether Scott ever charged the Society for legal work I do not\r\nknow, but I am quite certain that, if he ever did do so, it was but\r\nvery rarely.\r\nYet it is not so much to his generosity in money matters that I\r\nwant to draw attention, as to the generosity with which he\u2014a man\r\nwith a large professional practice\u2014devoted much time and thought\r\nto the concerns and interests of the Society. I can only hope that\r\nthe Society will be fortunate enough to find a successor to Scott,\r\nwho will do what he did for it during 45 years with the same\r\nefficiency and disinterestedness.\r\nAs a member of Council he did not often take part in discussions ; but when he did intervene, in his characteristically quiet manner,\r\nit was seldom that his advice was not accepted.\r\nBesides sound knowledge of the law, he was possessed of much\r\nshrewdness and common-sense ; but the quality which, more than\r\nany other, must, I should think, have struck most people who came\r\nin contact with him was his kindliness.\r\nSome who read this attempt to explain how much the Society has\r\nowed to Sydney Scott, may fancy that, in accordance with the not\r\nuncommon habit of writing with exaggerated politeness of the dead,\r\nI have magnified the value of his work. Disliking exaggeration in\r\nany matter, and especially in what comes under the head of Obituary\r\nNotices, I have to the best of my belief written nothing which the\r\nfacts do not justify.\r\nSeptember 23, 1936. J- PAs regards the period since the War, I wish to confirm most\r\n272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octdber1936\r\nstrongly everything Mr Piddington has written as to the value of\r\nthe services Mr Scott rendered the Society, and as to the generosity\r\nwith which, on occasions too numerous to specify, he unsparingly\r\nplaced time, trouble, sagacious judgment, and professional knowledge\r\nat our disposal without any charge on our funds. W. H. S.\r\nL. 1309. CASE.\r\nLost Object found as Result of a Dream.\r\nThe following case was received by Mr Saltmarsh, as a result of\r\nhis letter in The Spectator : Letter from Mr X (whose name and address is known to the\r\nSociety) dated 1936, January 20 : \" I send you herewith an account of an occurrence which took\r\nplace in July last. \" One afternoon my wife and I took a run into the country, with\r\nthe intention of having a picnic and the expectation of a little fishing for myself.\r\n\" On arrival at the place I left my wife near the bridge which\r\ncrosses the stream and went off fishing. The stream runs through a wood, hardly a mile long, but very dense in parts and thick with\r\nundergrowth. There are no proper paths, as it is very little fre- quented, being far away from any village. On returning about two\r\nhours later, happening to put my hand in a pocket, I found a hole\r\nand that a small key which locked a drawer where I kept certain\r\npapers was missing. When and where the key had fallen I could not\r\nsay. If here in the wood, there was no use looking for it. It would\r\nbe worse than looking for a needle in a haystack. So the matter\r\ndropped.\r\n\" Next morning my wife said she had had a dream. In her\r\ndream she was in the wood sitting on a fallen tree trunk, and near a mossy stone she saw the key.\r\n\" So impressed was she with the reality of the dream that in spite\r\nof my dissuasion she went there again that day, went through the\r\nwood, guided as it were by some force, until she saw the tree of her\r\ndream. Then she sat down on it for a few minutes, and then saw\r\nthe key beside the stone exactly as she had dreamt. I was greatly\r\nimpressed when she came home in the evening with the key. She\r\nhad not gone through the wood previously and had no knowledge\r\nwhere I had gone.\r\n\" I may say that my wife has told me before of like happenings,\r\nbut this one I can verify as being absolutely true.\"\r\nOctober 1936 Case 273\r\nMrs X writes : \" This is to confirm that all my husband has\r\nwritten regarding the loss of his key, together with my dream and\r\nthe finding of the key, is quite correct.\"\r\nThis case is of great interest, in that the dreamer was not present\r\nwhen the article was lost. One hears of so many cases where the\r\nloser himself finds the lost object, as the result of supposed clairvoyance, when normal unconscious memory of the loss would provide a much more probable explanation. Here, one is tempted to\r\nconsider the possibility of normal unconscious memory of the loss\r\nbeing transmitted telepathically from Mr X to Mrs X.\r\nA NOTE ON \" RADIAESTHESIA \" IN FRANCE\r\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\r\nDr Robert Rendu, a former hospital-attendant at Lyons, has\r\npublished in the July-August number of the Bulletin of the Societe\r\nmedicale de Saint.Luc, Saint Come et Saint Damien (61 rue Madame,\r\nParis 6\r\ne\r\n), a paper on \" Radiesthesie, Science et Morale \" since\r\nreprinted in pamphlet form and which will well repay perusal.\r\n(\" Radiesthesie \", it should be added perhaps, is in France the\r\nfashionable term for dowsing and pendulum performances, whilst\r\nthe Societe in question is a Roman Catholic medical society.)\r\nThere are two chapters in Dr Rendu's pamphlet. With the second\r\n(\" Radiaesthesia and Morals \") I will not concern myself, though it\r\ntoo contains valuable observations and considerations of interest.\r\nFor our immediate purpose it will be enough to reproduce the\r\nauthor's conclusions at the end of chapter first on \" Radiaesthesia\r\nand Science \" : \" As far as I am concerned, I have now been trying for more than\r\ntwenty years to submit dowsers' (\" sourciers \") statements to experimental control, convinced as I am that whilst nothing must be\r\ndenied a priori, nothing must be on the other hand asserted without\r\nproof. If so far as radiaesthesia is concerned, we retain but those\r\nfacts which can be easily and immediately controlled ; if we are\r\nattentively on the watch so as to prevent the dowser from availing\r\nhimself of any extra-radiaesthetic data ; if we take care to undertake experiments of a simple character and apt to be easily repeated ;\r\nif especially we take into account the percentage of successes due\r\nto the laws of chance\u2014we are driven to the conclusion that hitherto,\r\nat least, the results obtained by those radiaesthesists who did consent\r\nto submit to a scientific control are to a great extent identical with\r\nthose derived from the plain calculus of probabilities \"\r\n(p. 22).\r\n274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1936\r\nThese conclusions\u2014they will not please everybody, the author\r\nadmits\u2014are supported by a mass of evidence which certainly tends\r\nto throw on the (French) radiaesthesists' claims a lurid light. Cases\r\nsuggesting insincerity are\u2014to me\u2014the most disheartening. These\r\nare but too numerous. And even when we are not compelled to\r\npostulate complete insincerity, there are distinctly unpleasant incidents. There is, e.g. at Lyons, we are told, a friar, who has specialised himself in pendulum researches over plans and has made in the\r\nsame way marvellous discoveries in the realm of biology and\r\nmedicine. Dr Rendu wants to make with him conclusive experiments. Alas, all his proposals are declined, and at last he is told : \" My competence is universally known, and I do not wish to\r\nhumiliate myself so as to make experiments.\" To this Dr Rendu\r\nreplies that never would a Pasteur, a Claude Bernard or a Branly\r\nhave thought he was humiliating himself by submitting to experimental control. Insistence proved of no avail, and as Dr Rendu\r\nwas withdrawing the friar blurted out : \" After all these experiments are but snares which are being laid to me \"\r\n(p. 17).\r\nIt should be added that the French dowsers' claims are so farreaching as to be distinctly bewildering. They seem to extend\r\npractically to everything ! To quote one of them, Father Frederic\r\nde Belinay writing in the Etudes (a Paris review, with nothing\r\nhumouristic about it and which is edited by Jesuits !) \" All underground riches, water, coal, petroleum and metals, an aeroplane\r\nwhich fell down in the prairies, guns camouflaged in a forest, submarines diving, codfish shoals escaping before a fisherman's flotilla,\r\nIncas' treasures, tombs of the quaternary era, public notaries in\r\nflight (!!), colonies of microbes, the hidden beginnings of cancer . . . everything we may conceive as being material, physiological \" is \" within reach of the powers with which the pendulum is endowed \"\r\n(p. 2). For my own part, when reading such preposterous state- ments I can but shrug my shoulders or hold up my hands in utter\r\namazement ; and I think many other Psychical Researchers will\r\nagree with me. The French Medical Society of which Dr Rendu is a distinguished\r\nmember is, as I have said, a Roman Catholic Society. The independence of its attitude before claims put forward by ecclesiastics\r\n{rather numerous in this domain) is the more to be commended.\r\nHowever I do not quite sympathise with Dr Rendu when I find him\r\nsaying (p. 30) : \" How much we wish the ecclesiastical authorities would renew\r\n[as to dowsing, etc.] the cautious (?) prohibitions of bygone days ! \"\r\nI do not quite agree because such prohibitions should not be\r\nOctober 1936 Correspondence 275\r\nmultiplied unduly. Do we not already live and move in a world\r\nsaturated with verboten % In a welcome postscript Dr Rendu adds lie is in a position if necessary to substantiate the smallest facts (alas, all negative !) mentioned in his valuable paper. We congratulate him on the\r\nscientific and critical spirit manifested in this and other statements\r\nof his and think he has done in writing \" Radiesthesie, Science et Morale ;\r\n' a very useful piece of work.\r\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nLevitation\r\nRum Schneider's Curtain Movements\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of the Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I read with great interest the article on, \" Some Recent\r\nSittings with Continental Mediums \" by Mr C. V. C. Herbert in the\r\nJournal for May.\r\nAs regards the Sittings with Rudi Schneider, I suggest a possible\r\nexplanation of this curtain movement, which may seem fantastic\r\nand far-fetched, but which, nevertheless, bears, I submit, a grain of\r\ndebate.\r\nMany years ago, when I was quite a youngster, I was serving at\r\nSitapur, a small military station some fifty-six miles north of\r\nLucknow. One day the District Superintendant of Police invited a party of friends to lunch, and to entertain them afterwards he en- gaged the services of a Brahmin, a self-styled holy man, who performed certain acts of magic or conjuring. One of his performances\r\nwas very remarkable. A member of the party, a stout, phlegmatic\r\nMajor in the Royal Army Medical Corps related it to me the following\r\nday.\r\nIt will be seen from the above that I was not present at this party,\r\nwhich consisted of ten or eleven male guests all aged in, or about,\r\nthe forties. They sat in chairs in the shade of the garden, while the\r\nBrahmin did his performance on the grass lawn in brilliant sunshine.\r\nThe act in question was as follows : Four short posts, or stakes, were stuck into the ground by his\r\nassistants (two or three in number). On these posts was poised a\r\ncushion, and on the cushion was set a small Indian boy, aged five or\r\nsix years. The Brahmin proceeded to mesmerise the boy. When he\r\nwas completely hypnotised, the assistants pulled away the posts,\r\nand the boy remained sitting on the cushion in the air without any\r\n276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1936\r\nsupport. The Brahmin passed long rods all round and over and below\r\nthe boy, to prove there was no attachment. Presently the posts were put back, and the boy de-hypnotised. The act was over. How was it done 1 The Brahmin said he could only do it with a boy under seven years. Some of the guests thought that they had\r\nbeen hypnotised, and that the posts had never been removed from\r\nunder the cushion. But as the Major said to me, \" I was smoking a\r\n' Trichy ' (Trichinopoli) cheroot throughout the proceedings.\" And he\r\ncertainly did not strike one as being an easy subject for mesmerism.\r\nThe easy solution is that the Brahmin controlled the boy with some\r\npowerful form of hypnotism. If that was so, he must have controlled\r\nthe cushion also. I have seen a certain amount of Indian juggling, some of it extremely clever, but I have never heard of a similar case to this. I am also well aware that there are many amazingly tall and unsubstantiated stories of Indian tricks going about. I cannot vouch\r\nfor the accuracy of this case, but I have the Major's word, and I believe he was too mystified at the time to have given way to\r\nexaggeration. Anyway, it happened thirty years ago and cannot\r\nvery well be authenticated now. When I read Mr Herbert's article, it set me thinking of this case, and I am beginning to wonder if it may not be possible to will- control inanimate things. May not the strong concentration of the\r\nwill power of one person, or better of several persons, cause furniture\r\nto move and curtains to sway ? In this case of Rudi Schneider the\r\nsitters were warned to count five and then \" look out \" at the\r\ncurtains. This concentrated a number of will-powers, all expectant\r\nof seeing something\u2014probably a movement\u2014on the curtains. Is it not possible that this concentration, in some way little-known to us\r\nas yet\u2014an undeveloped normal faculty\u2014may have affected the\r\nmovements of the curtains by perfectly natural means ? Yours faithfully\r\nC. R. L. FitzGerald, Lt.-Col.,\r\nIndian Army (retired).\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014I have read with very great interest Colonel FitzGerald's letter on the subject of the Schneider curtain movements,\r\nbut I must confess that his suggested explanation does not seem to\r\nme to help us very much in understanding these phenomena. We\r\nhave no evidence whatever that any such manifestation of combined \" will-power \" has ever been noticed before, whereas, if it were really so, one would expect kindred phenomena to occur spon-\r\nOctober 1936 Correspondence 217\r\ntaneously when large crowds were assembled with a common purpose. Again, it would only account for such of the Schneider\r\nphenomena as were expected by the sitters. It would not account\r\nfor the overturning of the stool, mentioned in my paper, which\r\ncame as a complete surprise to me, and, so far as I know, to all the\r\nother sitters. None the less, Colonel FitzGerald's account of the Indian perform- ance is of very great interest, and suffers only from the defect that he\r\nhimself was not an actual witness of the occurrence. I have lately re- ceived, however, an account by Lord Halifax (printed below) of what\r\nseems to have been a somewhat similar experiment carried out in 1928\r\nor 1929, and of which he was an eye-witness ; and as he has been kind\r\nenough to give permission for his account to be printed, I send it to you herewith, in the hopes that it may be possible to print both\r\naccounts together, when they will, I feel sure, add greatly to each\r\nother's value. I remain, Your obedient servant,\r\nC. V. C. Herbert (Research Officer).\r\nLevitation Experiment\r\nWe witnessed the performance of an Indian conjuror at Udaipur\r\nin 1928, or 1929, and therefore my recollection of the details may be\r\nincorrect, but, so far as I can recall it, what happened was as follows.\r\nThe performance took place in the Resident's drawing-room, the\r\nfurniture being pushed back, and the performance taking place\r\nabout 20 feet, or so, from where we were sitting. The conjuror had\r\nwith him an Indian boy, whom he enveloped in a blanket secured on the outside by cords over the boy's arms and hips. He then\r\nmade passes over the boy, who appeared to go into trance, and then\r\nto rise from the ground to the height of about a foot. The conjuror\r\nthen passed his wand below, behind and above the boy to show\r\nthat he was unsupported and unattached. After a short interval of\r\nhalf-a-minute or so with further passes he lowered the boy to the\r\nground again, and in due course brought him out of his trance.\r\nThis is to the best of my recollection what occurred, but unhappily\r\nI did not write it down at the time, and my memory may betray\r\nme in particulars. (signed) Halifax.\r\n\" Memory and Telepathy \"\r\nTo the Hon . Editor of the Journal\r\nDear Madam,\u2014Mr Carrington's letter, published in the June\r\nissue of the Journal, deals with subjects of supreme importance.\r\nI doubt, however, whether the majority of medical men believe\r\n278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1936\r\nin the \" engrain \" or \" trace \" theory of memory. The ordinary\r\nmaterialist perhaps would rejoice if such a theory were true to fact,\r\nfor he would be able to say, \" Let us eat, drink, and be merry for\r\ntomorrow we break our record.\"\r\nLately I happen to have been writing an article on \" fixed\r\nmemories \" and in that article I introduced the following personal\r\nillustration as follows : \" Nearly fifty years ago I recited at a school\r\nconcert ' The Vulgar Boy ' from The Ingolclsby Legends. Since that\r\ndate I have not had a copy of that work in my possession, nor have\r\nI seen a copy. Nevertheless I am still able to repeat a dozen verses of the poem with hardly a mistake.\"\r\nNow, taking this illustration for my text, let us imagine, for the\r\nsake of argument, that the little chap fixed himself with the associated\r\npoem, to an \" engram \" in my brain fifty years ago. By an \" en- gram \" one means I suppose the ultramicroscopical particle of\r\nelectricity within the nucleolus of a brain cell. So far so good ; we\r\nhave the little chap firmly attached to an \" engram \". But here comes a difficulty. Brain cells grow and divide to form daughter\r\ncells, the nucleolus, which is the most important and smallest part\r\nof the cell, must partake of this division ; for the daughter-cells,\r\nthough immature, resemble the parent cell in all material particulars at any rate. Presumably the engram would also divide. \" What becomes of our little chap, then ? \" If he also divides in\r\nthe course of fifty years we might have millions of parts of little vulgar boys floating about the brain and jostling millions of other\r\nmemories conscious or unconscious ; under these conditions unity\r\nof normal mind could not be maintained.\r\nIt is true, of course, that there are certain ganglionic nerve cells which control certain vital processes such as respiration, but these\r\nact automatically, and act in a definite manner throughout life,\r\nthough their material structure is changed many times. These\r\ncells, however, are not under control of the will. But by our wills we can do many things : we can, for instance,\r\nvisit and visualize places we have formerly lived in, etc., etc. \" Isn't it far easier to consider our minds as immaterial unities\r\nusing the brain as instruments to play upon ? \" The handing down of millions of memories from cell to cell seems\r\nsuch a cumbrous method of preserving memories, and not in accord- ance with wisdom or reason.\r\nIt is far easier to understand telepathy by assuming the unity of\r\nmind than by giving it a cellular structure.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nWm. A. Carden, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.\r\nOctober 1936 Correspondence 279\r\nThe Qualitative Study of Trance Personalities\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014In her letter in the Journal for April Miss Naumburg\r\nreports that Mrs Garrett was under the impression that, when Mr\r\nBesterman was working with her, \" the galvanometer failed.\"\r\nMainly on this ground, it would appear, she implies that the method\r\nin general, and my conclusions in particular, may be invalid. Since\r\nthe galvanometer and ancillary apparatus were used for studying\r\npsycho-galvanic reflexes, whereas my conclusions were based\r\nentirely on reaction times and reproduction tests, 1 this would seem\r\nto be a non sequitur, but I cannot allow the suggestions made to pass\r\nunchallenged.\r\nFirst, however, I must apologise for a verbal carelessness which\r\nmay possibly have been misleading. I ought, no doubt, to have\r\nwritten that \" Mrs Garrett's reflexes were less satisfactory than any\r\nI have previously studied,\" or words to that effect, instead of the\r\npassage quoted ; but I think that my clear implication that it was\r\nMr Besterman who collected the da,ta,(Q.S.T.P.,i, p. 117)should exonerate me from any deliberate suggestion that I did the work myself.\r\nNext, it is not quite clear to me whether Miss Naumburg wishes\r\nto suggest that the accurate collection of data was beyond Mr\r\nBesterman's powers ; but, if so, I can assure her that the task is not really at all so formidable as it sounds. It is admittedly more\r\ndifficult than the leisured reading of, say, a clinical thermometer,\r\nand requires a certain amount of practice (which Mr Besterman had\r\nhad) ; but I venture to say that almost any competent person, not\r\nunduly intimidated by apparatus as such, could easily acquire the\r\nkind of rhythmic sequence of motions, etc., which enables observations to be made in an orderly and accurate manner. As regards the main point, Mr Besterman will, I know, bear me\r\n\u2022out in saying that at no time did the galvanometer, or any other\r\npart of the apparatus \" fail \"\r\n; if it had done so, it would instantly\r\nhave been detected. The apparatus was so designed that its proper\r\nfunctioning could be tested at any moment, and we even had the\r\nequivalent of a\r\n\" dummy subject \" as an additional means of testing\r\nthe whole circuit. Actually, as a precautionary measure (which\r\nwas, as it proved, supererogatory) we had the whole apparatus\r\nchecked up by the makers on two or three occasions, but in each\r\ncase it was found in perfect order.\r\n1 The only conclusion I drew from the reflexes was, tentatively, that the\r\nphenomenon of \" countersimilarity \" probably extends to them, in the case\r\n-of Uvani, as well as to reaction times. (Cf. Q.S.T.P. ii, p. 340.)\r\n280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1936\r\nThe suggestion that, if only \" a technician \" had been called in,\r\ndifferent results would have been obtained, can, if I may venture\r\nto say so, proceed only from ignorance of the apparatus, its method\r\nof use, and the contemporary circumstances. And to speak of the\r\ngalvanometer failing because the reflexes rapidly fell off is about\r\nequivalent to saying that a telescope failed because clouds passed\r\nbetween it and a star. Further, if Miss Naumburg will consult again the report by Dr\r\nBrown to which she refers, she will see that an entirely different\r\ntype of experiment was involved. But at least one feature of Mrs\r\nGarrett's behaviour is easily identifiable, for it was\u2014to speak\r\ncolloquially\u2014the failure of the reflexes elicited by the stimulus\r\nwords to make headway against the steady and relatively rapid rise\r\nin resistance shown in Dr Brown's paper that our difficulties were\r\nlargely, or at least partly, due.\r\nThere can, in short, be no doubt whatever that the unsatisfactory\r\nnature of Mrs Garrett's reflexes was not due to \" lack of a functioning\r\ngalvanometer,\" but to psycho-physiological causes at her end. I\r\naccordingly repudiate with vigour the suggestion that the effects\r\nobserved were due to \" lack of observation and training. ...\"\r\nAnd this view is supported by the fact that very satisfactory\r\nreflexes were obtained in the Rudi-Olga experiment, whereas those\r\nobtained from Mrs Salter and Mr Gatty at later dates were very\r\nbad, despite the intervening additional practice with Rudi.\r\nOn the other hand, it is not less important to insist that the\r\n\" unsatisfactoriness \"\u2014from the computer's point of view\u2014of Mrs\r\nGarrett's reflexes constitutes no sort of reflection on her or her\r\nmediumship. For aught I know to the contrary, this type of re- sponse to word-association tests (resistance high and rapidly rising ; reflexes rapidly fading out) may be the hall mark of high-grade\r\nmediumship, though I fancy the fading is mainly a matter of \" boredom \" (cf. Q.S.T.P., ii, p. 351). When a dozen other mediums of\r\nequal quality (if such there be) have proved so obliging as Mrs\r\nGarrett we shall know more about it ; at present it would be unwise\r\nto generalise from a single case. I hope the foregoing will set Miss Naumburg's mind at rest ; for\r\nit seems unfortunate that she should be led to discount results\r\nobtained from one class of data because of Mrs Garrett's erroneous, if natural, impressions concerning the collection of another\r\nclass. As regards the exclusion of certain words of universally high\r\nemotional value from my list, I should have thought the reasons\r\nfor this would have been clear enough. If we wish to study the\r\nOctober 1936 Correspondence 281\r\ndifferences between two objects, we naturally do not study, but\r\ncarefully ignore, the points which we know in advance they are\r\nlikely to have in common. We do not seek to identify a criminal on\r\nthe ground that he has two legs, ten fingers, one heart and thirtytwo teeth : otherwise Miss Naumburg, or I, might well find ourselves in the electric chair as being indistinguishable from Public\r\nEnemy No. 1. On the contrary we concentrate on attributes which\r\nare likely to vary greatly from one individual to another.\r\nIn my early work I found that the six words giving the biggest\r\nreflexes (on which I was mainly concentrating at that time) were\r\nKiss, Love, Marry, Divorce, Name and Woman ; while the six\r\ngiving the smallest were Swim, Pencil, Pond, Flower, Give and\r\nGlass. Now it is evident that the first six are likely to be of almost\r\nuniversal interest and emotional value, while the last might give\r\nvery diverse effects according to the particular experiences of the\r\npersons tested. These, then, would be most likely to bring out in- dividual differences which might easily be overshadowed by the\r\neffects of the first six if these were included in the list. 1\r\nI quite agree that it would be most interesting to repeat the tests with words of this character included ; but I think there can be no doubt that it would have been unwise to use them in the first in- stance.\r\nMiss Naumburg suggests also that \" the effect of the stimulus\r\nwords must surely die down,\" and cites Mrs Garrett's subjective\r\nimpressions in support of this contention. But the proof of the\r\npudding is in the eating, and if this were to occur to any considerable extent we could not possibly obtain, as we do obtain, significant\r\nSimilarities, Differences and \" Individualities \"\u2014the latter, in particular, effectively demonstrating the consistency with which the\r\nvarious words are, in fact, differentiated in the case of a given\r\nsubject. I fear that \" must surely \"' cannot over-ride the facts as represented, for example, by results 11 and 14 of Q.S.T.P. ii, Table I. which show overwhelmingly the consistent differentiation\r\nbetween words by Mrs Garrett and Uvani.\r\nYours, etc.,\r\nW.

Price RM. 5.50.\r\nIt is no reflection on Dr Bender to say that the most striking thing\r\nabout these two little books is the fact that they set out the results of\r\nwork done in the Psychological Institute of the University of Bonn,\r\nwith the financial and moral support of the Notgemeinschaft der\r\nDeutschen Wissenschaft. Such a change of attitude on the part of\r\nofficial science will be most significant to those who know of the intensely conservative attitude of the German universities to the whole\r\nfield of psychical research. Dr Bender could ask for no higher tribute\r\nto his integrity and ability.\r\nThe former of the books mentioned above, though published first,\r\nis actually a sequel to the second. This latter book embodies the re- sults of a series of investigations planned to demonstrate the value of\r\nthe psychic and sensory automatisms for the study of the unconscious.\r\nThese experiments are a sort of compact summary of the work in this\r\nfield carried out during the past half-century, and they yielded the\r\nsame types of results as always before. What is more interesting is that they suggested, as so often before, that paranormal phenomena\r\nsometimes emerge during the course of such experiments. Dr Bender\r\nhad the courage to follow up these indications, and his findings are described in the first-named book.\r\nIn brief, Dr Bender's experiments, in their final stages, were\r\ncarried out with series of cards bearing the letters of the alphabet,\r\neach card being covered with cellophane in order to avoid any sus- picion of tactile hyperesthesia on the part of the subject. These\r\ncards were prepared by a third person, and were picked out by Dr\r\nBender and handed to the subject entirely under cover. Thus no- bodv present knew what card was being examined by the subject, and\r\nthere appears to have been no normal source of leakage. There were\r\nvariations in the procedure, the conditious here described having\r\nbeen the least secure ; thus the cards were sometimes so covered as\r\nto render the letters on them invisible. Under these conditions Dr\r\nBender obtained the following results, which he himself analyses\r\nmuch more elaborately : Series 1 ; 34 trials ; completely accurate indications, 7 ; chance\r\nexpectation, about 1.3. Series 2 ; 69 trials ; completely accurate indications, 15 ; chance\r\nexpectation, about 2.5.\r\nOctober 1936 Reviews 283\r\nSeries 3 ; 17 trials ; completely accurate indications, 8 ; chance\r\nexpectation, about 0.7. Series 4 : 14 trials ; complete accurate indications, 7 ; chance\r\nexpectation, about 0.5. Total of the four series : 134 trials ; completely accurate indications, 37 : chance expectation, about 5. These figures, which are not Dr Bender's, but which are derived\r\nfrom his tables, are pretty conclusive, even allowing for the small\r\nnumber of the trials, the writer's justification of which is not altogether convincing. Another defect is the fact that the entire experiments were conducted with a single subject (though in the preliminary series one or two others were used). It is also right to record the\r\nfact that a series of trials conducted early in 1934 with materials\r\n(numbers, geometrical figures, letters and words, carefully enclosed)\r\nprovided by the present reviewer, in his then capacity of Investigation Officer, proved a complete failure. This fact is duly set out by\r\nDr Bender, though he does not describe the results in detail. These\r\nreservations may possibly cause some students to suspend judgment,\r\nbut I am myself satisfied that the only loophole in these experiments\r\nlies in the statistical difficulties inherent in their small number. Dr\r\nBender states more than once that his sole purpose was to convince\r\nofficial psychology that clairvoyance must be taken seriously and\r\nthat normal psychology is bound to be defective if paranormal\r\nphenomena are overlooked. It may seem absurd to hardened psychical researchers that it should still be necessary to demonstrate these\r\nthings ; but the necessity is unquestionable, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that Dr Bender ought to succeed in his admirable purpose.\r\nIt should be stated that Dr Bender has also entered into some\r\ndistinctly interesting theoretical considerations mainly based on the\r\nintrospections of his subject. I think, however, that Dr Bender has\r\nnot given sufficient consideration to the danger of generalising from\r\nthe self-analysis, always dangerous even in the mass, of a single subject. Dr Bender is continuing his researches, with special attention\r\nto scrying, and his report will be looked forward to with the keenest\r\ninterest.

In this book, Mr Carrington examines the Bible accounts of\r\nmiracles (mostly those of the New Testament) in the light of modern\r\npsychological and parapsychological knowledge. The Bible miracles,\r\nregarded solely from the point of view of psychical research, can be\r\n284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1936\r\nof little interest to us, since our knowledge of them is based more\r\non tradition than on contemporary record. But none the less the\r\nbook will prove of value to at least two classes of persons : i.e., those\r\nwho accept the whole of the Bible, or the whole of the New Testament, as \" gospel truth \" (a class possibly larger in America than in\r\nthis country) ; and those who reject all the miracles as impossible.\r\nDr Carrington has trodden a difficult and dangerous path with\r\nconsiderable skill. He has avoided treading too heavily on religious\r\ncorns, without, on the other side, unduly offending the sceptics.\r\nThere is certainly nothing in the book which should shock or pain a\r\nreasonable person. There are, no doubt, passages with which many\r\nreaders will disagree. For example, it is clearly questionable that\r\nthe Christian religion would have come to nothing if it had not been\r\nfor the \" seeming resurrection of Christ \" (page 184). Again, some\r\nwill consider that the Author overstresses the certainty with which\r\nthe parapsychological phenomena have been established at the\r\npresent day.\r\nWe must, then, congratulate Dr Carrington in having succeeded\r\nwhere many people would have failed ; though it should again be\r\nstressed that any permanent value that the book may have, lies in\r\nthe field of theology, and not of psychical research.\r\nC.

Mr Cuddon has an excellent hypnotic\r\nsubject, and it is hoped that his work may throw light on the\r\npsychological mechanism of \" mediumship \". Some 60 \" spontaneous \" cases have been investigated, of which\r\nsix have been judged sufficiently evidential of paranormality for\r\nprinting in the Journal.'2 The documents relating to most of the\r\nothers may be seen by Members and Associates at the Society's Rooms.\r\n1 See Boston Society for Psychical Research, Bulletin XXIII, March 1936.\r\n2 See Journal S.P.R., No. 511, p. 2 ; No. 512, p. 33 ; No. 524, p. 209 and\r\np. 213 ; No. 526, p. 239 ; No. 528, p. 272.\r\nNovember 1936 Notes on Research During 1935-1936 289\r\nVarious sittings with \" mediums \" were attended by officers of the\r\nSociety, who also witnessed demonstrations of so-called sightless\r\nreading by Mr Kuda Bux, and Mr Kolb. Reports of these are available for inspection.\r\nAn interesting case of \" clairvoyance \" in Holland was investigated by Mr Whately Carington, who with the assistance of the\r\nResearch Student carried out a quantitative experiment in paragnosis. The results were not significant of supernormal faculty.\r\nAn experiment with Mrs Leonard has been begun in which a technique has been evolved for reducing the well-known \" booktests \" to a quantitative basis, so that the odds against chance may\r\nbe exactly calculated. The Rev. W. S. Irving has kindly cooperated\r\nin this. Messrs. Gattv and Irving have continued their work with Mrs\r\nLeonard, and Mr Gatty has prepared a paper on his results. The\r\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas has carried out further researches with the\r\nsame subject.\r\nMr Kenneth Richmond is continuing his study of the large amount\r\nof Leonard material that has been put on record by members during\r\n20 years. The structure of trance-personalities remains his chief fine\r\nof research in an investigation which also includes further work on\r\nproxy sittings and on the validity of book- and newspaper-tests.\r\nMr G. N. M. Tyrrell is also continuing his research in ExtraSensory-Perception. The Report on this subject published in Proceedings, xliv, Part 147, covered a period of research from 13 May\r\n1935 to 13 March 1936, but a footnote on p. 151 carried the results\r\nof one class to 2 July 1936. This latter class dealt with the condition\r\nin which, using the electrical apparatus described in the report,\r\nmechanically selected numbers were passed through the keys by the\r\noperator, the connexions from the keys to the lamps being in all cases unknown to him. Results with this arrangement, as is shown\r\nboth by theoretical calculation and by practical tests, cannot be\r\nobtained by using the Fisk method of scoring (see pp. 153-158 in the\r\nReport), the method being in fact evidentially on a par with the use\r\nof the mechanical selector itself. The chance-probability figure for\r\nthis class of results, which on 2 July was 10~14\r\n, has since then (up to\r\n12 September) been reduced to 10\"\"56\r\n, that is to say that the odds\r\nagainst this class of results being due to chance is of an astronomical\r\norder.\r\nResults with the mechanical selector itself have begun to be obtained. At present they form a comparatively small class, for which\r\nthe chance-probability figure is 0-0016 (also up to 12 September).\r\nIt is interesting to note that this class of experiment appears to be\r\n-iO Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1936\r\npassing through the same phases as the other classes which were\r\ndealt with in the above report, viz., that of gradual acceptance by\r\nthe subliminal of the subject after a long period of rejection.\r\nA new device has been added to the machine by which the selector\r\nis operated automatically by the subject herself in the act of opening the boxes, and as this arrangement, when tested out, gives a chance distribution of events, a new and interesting form of the precogmtive experiment is opened up by it. Several successes have\r\nbeen attained with it, Miss Johnson being the percipient.\r\nA hypnotised subject was tried but she failed to score above\r\nchance. A child aged six is now under test. Any member, or the friend of any member, living in or near London, having mediumistic or clairvoyant gifts, would be welcomed\r\nas subjects if they would care to try. It is of special interest to try\r\nwith children, for whom the apparatus forms a kind of guessing\r\ngame.\r\nThe Society has kept in touch with The British College of Psychic a Science, The International Institute for Psychical Research, and The\r\nUniversity of London Council for Psychical Investigation, each of\r\nwhich bodies has been of material use to the Society on more than\r\none occasion.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nExtra-Sensory Perception\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014May I venture to make a few comments on Mr G. N. M.\r\nTyrrell's \" Further Research in Extra-Sensory Perception \", published in the Proceedings for June ? First, I would like to say how I admire the scientific detachment\r\nwith which he presents his findings, whether they are disconcerting\r\n(as in the case of Mr Fisk's method of scoring) or otherwise. It has\r\nbeen said that too often those who engage in psychical research\r\nexhaust their energies in establishing the mere existence of the\r\nphenomena. Here, at least, is a triumphant exception. Long may\r\nthis painstaking collaboration of Miss Johnson and Mr Tyrrell\r\ncontinue ! They probably have their programme mapped out, but there is one experiment I should like to suggest. If the conditions entailed\r\ndo not inhibit Miss Johnson's faculty it is possible that it might\r\nyield interesting results. The hypothesis it would test may possibly\r\nhave been suggested before. It first occurred to me when reading\r\nUpton Sinclair's book Mental Radio. As I pointed out in a letter\r\nNovember 1936 Correspondence 2;U\r\npublished in the Listener of August 16 1933, certain puzzling facts\r\nrecorded in that book would be explained if the results were attri- buted not to clairvoyance, but to precognition. It may be remembered that Upton Sinclair made drawings of simple objects, placing\r\nthem in numbered envelopes. His wife then attempted to reproduce\r\nthese drawings one at a time by alleged clairvoyance. He reported\r\nthat a number of attempts bore a striking resemblance not to the\r\ncorresponding originals, but to subsequent ones. Not easy to\r\nexplain by clairvoyance, but understandable if the percipient\r\nobtained her results by perceiving her own future examination of\r\nthe original drawings.\r\nAnother justification for suggesting the above hypothesis is that\r\nit may shed light on the research described in Dr J. B. Rhine's\r\nExtra-Sensory Perception. He says (on pages 147-8, American ed.), It may be said now, I think, on good experimental evidence, that\r\nin clairvoyance and telepathy we are dealing with the same basic\r\nprocess. . . . Not only do the subjects possess both clairvoyant and\r\ntelepathic capacity, but, what is more meaningful still, they score\r\nin both conditions at about the same rate.\" He draws the conclusion that \" as referring to distinct processes there is probably no\r\nclairvoyance and no telepathy. There is just this mode of perceiving,\r\nextra-sensorially \". I should prefer to say that while telepathy\r\nprobably exists as a distinct process, the one basic process was\r\nprecognition.\r\nReturning to Mr Tyrrell's results, on first inspection they seem to\r\nconfirm the hypothesis. For instance, total 138 gives 23-8% for\r\n10,050 trials when the conditions excluded telepathy, while total\r\n140 gives 23-9% for 2255 trials when the conditions excluded\r\ntelepathy and clairvoyance.\r\nOn the other hand, his results surprised me in another direction.\r\nI had assumed that scores above chance depended on the percipient\r\nseeing the correct card or box after each trial. Or, in other words,\r\nthat precognition of an event took place only when action based on\r\ninformation obtained thus did not prevent the event itself taking\r\nplace. Such a procedure was followed presumably by Dr Rhine (it may explain the rather higher scores obtained by his subjects), but\r\nMr Tyrrell's work shows that this assumption was unjustified. In\r\nits place I venture to put forward another. Where the percipient- scores significantly without seeing the correct box after each trial a\r\npossible explanation is this. At each trial the percipient selects one box at random. By precognition the success or failure of this\r\nintention is perceived, and in the case of the latter another choice\r\nis made which is acted upon.\r\n292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Novembee 1936\r\nBut enough of speculation ! The whole matter can be solved by\r\nexperiment or it would be meaningless. If Miss Johnson can score\r\nsignificantly when her action of raising the box lid switches off the\r\nlight before it is normally perceptible, then the hypothesis is disproved. At the cost of further complication, but with the advantage\r\nof retaining apparently normal conditions, it would be desirable to\r\narrange that the change from conditions permitting precognition\r\nshould be operated by a mechanical selector selecting one trial in,\r\nsay, four.\r\nMr Tyrrell is very cautious, so that, while I do not think his\r\npublished conclusions can be construed to suggest the above hypothesis, I hope I have not trespassed hastily where he is advancing\r\ncautiously. His own theory of clairvoyance is, I think, one which\r\nwould be classified by Dr C. D. Broad as \" non-sensuous prehension \", and would not give rise to such a suggestion.\r\nYours faithfully, T. A. Strange.\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nDear Madam,\u2014In thanking Mr Strange for his letter, may I say\r\nthat I entirely agree with him in believing the distinction between\r\nthe different modes of E.S.P. to be arbitrary rather than real ? Apoint mentioned in my Report, but perhaps not sufficiently stressed,\r\nis that in the great majority of cases the fighting of the lamp and\r\nthe opening of the box were simultaneous, so that the percipient's\r\nmental act of choice as well as initial muscular movements towards\r\nthe box must have occurred before the lamp was actually alight.\r\nIf a cinematograph record of the whole process had been possible,\r\nI am sure it would have shown the percipient's hand moving to- wards the box before the lamp began to glow. Like Dr Rhine, I have been impressed by the undifferentiated character of the extrasensory faculty ; there are no signs of anything to mark off clair- voyance from precognition, a reversal of the time-order of the\r\nevents being treated with indifference.\r\nIt would certainly be interesting to try the experiment which MrStrange suggests, but it might be some time before the subject\r\ncould be induced to accept the change.\r\nYours faithfully, G. N. M. Tyrrell.\r\nIndividuality and Evidence\r\nTo the Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014Clear-headed philosophical discussion generally brings\r\nout points of practical importance, and a very clear statement on\r\nNovember 1936 Correspondence 293\r\nmental events by Mr Saltmarsh 1 has a vital bearing not only on the\r\ntheory of individuality , but on our practice in estimating evidence of\r\nindividual intention, as distinct from evidence of paranormal\r\nknowledge.\r\n\" Every mental event \", Mr Saltmarsh writes, \" occurs against a background and is to some extent coloured by that background.\r\nThe background is made up of elements from the entire past history\r\nof the individual experiencing the event. ... I suggest therefore\r\nthat every mental event contains within itself elements derived from\r\nthe whole past history of the individual.\"\r\nApart from the general assent which we may be inclined to give\r\nto this proposition, the analytical branches of psychology supply\r\nabundant and increasing evidence that it is true. And the truth\r\nof the proposition involves a clear fact about the evidence for any\r\nmental event\u2014in particular, the presentation of any piece of\r\nparanormal information.\r\nDirectly this mental event is separated from its \" background \"\r\n(if it has been given in a context referring to the past history of a communicator), it automatically loses \" colour \" as a mental event\r\nappertaining to that communicator. The paranormal detail is, like\r\nother items of experience, \" not a simple, clear-cut mental event\r\nwith sharp edges and clearly defined boundaries,\" to quote Mr\r\nSaltmarsh again ; \" rather it is an inseparable part of an organic\r\nwhole which, if forcibly taken out of that whole, becomes something\r\ndifferent.\"\r\nProbably by reason of training and habit derived from the\r\nphysical sciences, especially chemistry (the science of thought is riddled with irrelevant chemical metaphor), we find ourselves\r\npossessed of an idea that if we \" isolate \" the \" elements \" of a psychological whole, we shall somehow have explained it. Even in\r\nchemistry we isolate elements by wiping out compounds with their\r\ndistinctive properties ; and in psychical research we cannot remove\r\na piece of evidence from its context without every risk of abolishing\r\nthe properties which it has within that context.\r\nMr Drayton Thomas's recent exposition of newspaper-tests is a\r\ncase in point. Separate these events from their close interweaving\r\nwith the past history and experience of \" John \", and you have\r\nevidence of extra-sensory perception without any hint that it is being displayed with any particular intention. It is as easy to\r\npresuppose intention on the part of Mrs Leonard's trance-mind and\r\nMr Drayton Thomas's subliminal as on the part of a communicator.\r\n1 \" Some comments on Mr Tyrrell's Paper on Individuality.\" Proc, Part\r\n148, Oct. 1936, p. 188.\r\n294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1936\r\nBut restore these leaves of extra-sensory evidence to the stem of\r\n\" John's \" history and the grouping of his interests from which they\r\nemerge in the tests themselves\u2014still more, refer the whole to the\r\nroots that can be traced out in the complete records of the Drayton\r\nThomas sittings\u2014and there is positive and coherent evidence, which\r\nneeds to be criticised as such, of an organic whole which has the\r\ncharacteristics of an individual.\r\nIt seems to me important that this question of context and co- herence in psychical evidence should not be regarded as a speciality\r\nof a fad of those who are interested in it. I am quite prepared,\r\nmyself, to follow up any rational hypothesis whatever of \" the\r\ncommunicator \"\r\n; but it seems sheer waste of time to pull organic\r\nevidence to pieces, make selections from the pieces, and if these still show too much meaning reduce them to still smaller shreds, so as to\r\ndemonstrate in the end that there is nothing worth talking about in\r\nmaterial that has been effectually destroyed. And this destructive\r\nenergy could be most usefully employed in demolishing faulty\r\nevidence and showing where and why it is not truly organic.\r\nYours, etc., Kenneth Richmond.\r\nREVIEWS\r\nHarry Price : Confessions of a Ghost-hunter. Pp. 386. Illustrated.\r\nDemy 8vo. Putnams : Price, 10s. 6d. net. Mr Price has written a book which, while intended for the general\r\nreader, will be found interesting and in many places instructive by\r\nthose who have a fair amount of knowledge of psychical research.\r\nIt is written in a readable style and covers a wide field, though naturally those aspects of psychical research, with which the author has\r\nhad the greatest experience, receive the fullest treatment.\r\nIn the first five chapters Mr Price relates some of his experiences in\r\ninvestigating poltergeists and haunts, and he follows these with an\r\naccount of the \" Talking Mongoose \" on a Manx farm, a very curious\r\nincident falling within the same general class of phenomena. A\r\nlater chapter on \" How to test a Medium \" contains many sound\r\nhints for beginners, and a long chapter on \" Secrets of ' Spirit\r\n\r\nPhotography \" treats this subject very fully and drastically. The\r\nauthor explains in some detail various methods which have been, and\r\nothers which might be, used by the fakers of photographic extras. But Mr Price's attitude is not invariably negative. There is a chapter entitled \" Convincing Experiments with a French Clairvoyante \"\r\n(Mile Jeanne Laplace), and in another chapter he reiterates his belief\r\nin the genuineness of the earlier phenomena of Rudi Schneider.\r\nNovember 1936 Reviews 295\r\nLater sections deal with. \" Stage Telepathy \", Marion, (of whom\r\nwe are glad to learn a report by Mr S. G. Soal is to be expected), the\r\nIndian Rope-trick as performed by Karachi (differing considerably\r\nfrom the elusive rope-trick of tradition) and Kuda Bux's exploits,\r\nboth in reading with blind-folded eyes and in performing the fire- walk ; further reference to the latter exploit is made below.\r\nThere is also a chapter on the much discussed Brocken experiment,\r\nwhen (in honour of Goethe !) the ritual of the \" Bloksberg Tryst\r\n\"\r\nfor converting a he-goat into a young man was followed by Mr Price\r\nand Mr Joad as nearly as the unobliging absence of the moon permitted. Everyone seems to have enjoyed it except the goat, who,\r\nto judge from the photograph facing p. 338, adopted a very noncooperative attitude. He has our sympathies.\r\nIt will be seen that Mr Price succeeded in the intention announced\r\nin the Preface of making these Confessions both diverse and readable. But the Preface seems to suggest that the book has some\r\nserious bearing on the question of survival, and this is far from being\r\nthe case. There is hardly a matter treated in the book which any\r\ndisputant who knew his case would raise if debating that question.\r\nThis, and too great a readiness to sniff at the efforts of other in- vestigators are unfortunate blemishes in a book which deserves to\r\nbe widely read.\r\nWho wrote the Mahatma Letters ? By H. E. and W. L. Hare.\r\nPp. 326. London : Williams & Norgate. 1936. 10s. 6d.\r\nThe authors are to be congratulated on having written an\r\nextremely interesting book. In the year 1923 the complete series\r\nof letters received by Mr Sinnett, and purporting to have been sent\r\nto him supernormally by Indian Mahatmas living in Tibet, was\r\npublished, and in the following year a complete collection of Madame\r\nBlavatsky's letters to Mr Sinnett appeared. It therefore became\r\npossible for the first time to institute a comparison between Madame\r\nBlavatsky's letters and the Mahatma letters, and this the authors\r\nhave proceeded to do with devastating effect. Drawing parallels\r\nbetween the two series of letters it becomes obvious that the similarities between them are too close and too numerous to be attributed to any cause other than common authorship. They share the\r\nsame range of ideas, and the same general literary style, particularly\r\nthe use of gallicisms natural to Madame Blavatsky, who was always\r\nmore familiar with French than English ; similar mistakes also occur as regards the transliteration into English of Indian names,\r\nand in the spelling even of common English proper names. The question of Madame Blavatsky's motives has from the early\r\ndays of her Society been much debated. Hodgson's suggestion that\r\n296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1936\r\nshe was a Russian spy is now known not to be correct, though not\r\nfar off the mark, since the principal reason why she did not follow\r\nthis career seems to have been lack of appreciation of her abilities\r\nby her own Government. The authors of this book make the\r\nfollowing three \" interpretative suggestions \" : \" First, we trace\r\nthe power-seeking motive as the original and main cause of her\r\ndeceptions : second, we note an animus against Christianity, both\r\nexhibited and avowed, which led her to the extremity of abuse and\r\nto tactics of opposition void of moral scruple : third, we perceive\r\nthat her earlier deceptions placed her in positions which in time became untenable, so that necessity compelled her to adopt greater\r\nand more unabashed measures of defence.\" W.

Mr Eagle is Lecturer in Mathematics in the Victoria University\r\nof Manchester, and has held several scientific appointments. Thesub-title of his book, \" An Exposure of the Worthlessness and\r\nAbsurdity of some Conventional Conclusions of Modern Science\r\n\"\r\nfairly describes its nature. Many of his criticisms can be read with\r\ninterest, even by those who differ widely from him on many points.\r\nIt is surprising to observe that in a book which touches on many of\r\nthe problems to which the evidence of psychical research is extremely\r\nrelevant, the author seems to be as oblivious of that evidence as any of the typical scientists whom he criticises. W. H. S. NOTES ON PERIODICALS\r\nThe International Institute for Psychical Research. Bulletin III : June, 1936.\r\nIn 1933 Dr Watters published an account 1 of a series of experiments, performed in America, in which he claimed to have photographed, by means of a Wilson Cloud Chamber, the \" immaterial\r\nbodies \" of certain animals, liberated at the moment of death, andrendered visible by the condensation on them of water vapour in\r\nthe Cloud Chamber. The photographs, as reproduced in Dr Watters'\r\npaper, were not sufficiently clear to enable the reader to form a judgment as to the validity of the claims ; and, not unnaturally,\r\nserious students of parapsychology were unwilling to accept such an extraordinary phenomenon without corroborative evidence.\r\n1 Bulletin of the Dr William Bernard Johnston Foundation for Psychological\r\nResearch, October, 1933.\r\nNovember 1936 Notes on Periodicals 297\r\nThe International Institute is greatly to be congratulated in having gone to the trouble and expense of repeating Dr Watters'\r\nexperiments. This Bulletin, written by B. J. Hopper, M.Sc, gives a summary of the Watters paper, and describes the apparatus that was set up at the Institute, and the conduct of the experiments.\r\nIt will be obvious to the reader of the Bulletin that every effort was made to duplicate the American results ; but no \" immaterial\r\nbody \" was ever detected. It seems likely that Dr Watters was\r\nmistaken in his interpretation of his photographs, and that what he\r\nclaimed as an \" immaterial body \" was in reality nothing more than\r\nstray formations in the cloud in the Chamber, due to \" slight unevenness in the thermal conditions' \".\r\nAll workers in this field will be grateful to Mr Hopper and the\r\nInstitute for an important piece of research. C. V. C. H.\r\nPsychic Science, 1936, Vol. XV, No. 2, July. Price Is. This number contains an important paper by Mr Eric Cuddon,\r\ndescribing experiments in which a\r\n\" control \" was produced by\r\nmeans of post-hypnotic suggestion. It now seems probable that even if the messages received from \" mediums \" do originate in\r\nthe survived personalities of departed spirits, the mechanism of\r\ntransmission is, none the less, dependant on unconscious personalities in the subject's mind, i.e. that the spirit (if it is a spirit)\r\nmakes use of the psychic organisation of the subject, as well as of\r\nhis or her physical body. For this reason, Mr Cuddon's experiments\r\nshould be of the greatest interest both to investigators and to\r\nconfirmed spiritualists.\r\nMr Cuddon is greatly to be congratulated, though the very curious\r\nEditorial Note to his paper suggests that those to whom Mr Cuddon\r\nhas communicated his results are not worthy of the labours of so excellent an investigator.\r\nAnother experiment by Mr Cuddon is described in a paper by\r\nMrs Hankey. Though it has a less direct bearing on psychical\r\nresearch, it should be of the greatest interest to students of psychology and the phenomena of hypnosis. C. V. C.

Godwin Baynes read a paper on \" The Ghost as a Psychic\r\nPhenomenon \".\r\nSummary oe a Paper by Mr. J. Cecil Maby on\r\n\" THE FLOWER MEDIUM : MISS HYLDA LEWIS \"\r\nIn explaining the reasons which led a group of Oxford investigators to invite Miss Hylda Lewis, the \" Elower Medium,\" to give\r\nsittings to them in the Autumn of 1935, Mr Maby referred to the\r\nunfavourable opinion on her phenomena formed by many investigators who had already sat with her, including several members of\r\nthe S.P.R., and particularly to an occasion in the Summer of 1935\r\nwhen she had signed a\r\n\" confession \", which was published in the\r\npress.\r\nMany of Miss Lewis's friends, however, considered that she had\r\nnot been fairly treated on that occasion, and that in fairness to her\r\nshe should be given an opportunity of having her powers tested by a group combining critical judgment with a sympathetic and friendly\r\natmosphere. It was accordingly arranged that Miss May Walker,\r\nin whose company Miss Lewis had visited various investigators at\r\nhome and abroad, should bring her to Oxford towards the end of\r\nSeptember 1935, where she should live as Mr Maby's guest in his\r\nhouse, No. 3 Rawlinson Road. While living at Oxford it was intended that she should enjoy complete liberty of action and movement, except during the actual sittings, being, at the same time,\r\nkept unobtrusively under as close observation by Mr Maby and the\r\nother members of his household as the circumstances permitted.\r\nThis intention was duly carried out.\r\nMr Maby's household consisted of himself and his wife, their\r\ninfant son, a laboratory assistant (Mr Meyer), and a maid (Miss\r\nLoose). The investigating group included Miss May Walker, the\r\nlate Mr E. S. Thomas, Prof. H. H. Price (all members of the S.P.R.),\r\nCol. Dr E. F. G. Tucker, a former member, Mr F. A. Baker and Miss\r\nC. M. Bryson. Care was taken that the medium should get to know\r\nall the sitters in the ordinary way of sociability before giving them\r\nsittings, p 2\r\n304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1936\r\nMiss Lewis arrived in Oxford on Saturday, 28 September, 1935,\r\nand remained there till the following Wednesday, 2 October. She\r\ngave several sittings under appropriate control conditions, and also\r\nproduced phenomena at times when no sitting had been arranged.\r\nHer phenomena could be classified under three heads (1) supposed\r\nsupernormal \" communications \" ; (2) apports or materialised\r\nobjects ; (3) lights.\r\nMr Maby and his fellow investigators came to the conclusion\r\nthat none of the phenomena were certainly genuine, and that most\r\nof them certainly were not. Thus the supposed communications\r\ncontained no information not derivable from a Family Bible and\r\nvarious papers to which the medium, as guest, had easy access, or from conversations at meal times.\r\nThe apports or materialisations consisted of apples of a variety\r\ngrown in Mr Maby's garden and of flowers and small toys such as could have been purchased in the Oxford shops, which she had\r\nopportunities of visiting. Mr Maby gave in detail reasons for con- cluding that objects so purchased were later produced at sittings.\r\nThus flowers were found concealed in the bedroom exactly corre- sponding to those produced at two subsequent sittings, and later\r\nagain cut stalks, loose petals and wilted flowers were discovered in\r\ncircumstances that seemed to Mr Maby, who is a trained botanist,\r\nto leave no doubt that they were the relics of apports or materialisations already observed.\r\nThe investigators were unable completely to elucidate the problem\r\nof the lights without violation of the conditions they had agreed to\r\nagainst forcible stripping and search of the medium, but Mr Maby\r\nmentioned several observations regarding them which seemed\r\nstrongly to negative any supernormal hypothesis.\r\nMr Maby's paper can be seen in full at the Society's rooms. Mr\r\nMaby has also kindly deposited with the Society a fuller report of\r\nthe Oxford investigations, which has been placed with the considerable volume of other reports, several of them confidential, on\r\nthe same medium received by the Society.\r\nExtract from a Paper by the Eev. C. Drayton Thomas on\r\n\" THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BOOK TESTS \"\r\n\" Dr V. J. Woolley, while the Hon. Besearch Officer of the Society for\r\nPsychical Besearch, devised a method by which we could experiment\r\nwith a book, the identityof which should meanwhile remain unknown\r\nto anyone on earth.\r\nDecember 1936 The Significance of Book Tests 305\r\nDescribed briefly his method was as follows : He asked a friend to\r\nsend him a parcel of books without information about the contents.\r\nHe asked others to do the same. This brought into his possession\r\npackets containing a variety of books. These he placed unopened in a canvas sack. Taking this into a dark room Dr Woolley inserted his\r\nhands into the sack and opened the parcels ; all the books were thus\r\nmingled together. He then took a smaller sack and placing its mouth over that of the larger pushed a single book up into the small\r\nsack. This smaller sack he then closed by a cord passing through\r\neyelets round the rim, and placed a lead seal with his private stamp\r\nover the cord. It was then put into a large envelope which was\r\ngummed up and then secured by rice paper labels bearing marks of\r\nidentification, and this was finally wrapped in brown paper for protection. The larger sack containing the remaining books for future use was then secured in a similar manner, and was taken charge of by\r\nMrs Brackenbury, Dr Woolley's assistant, and remained in her\r\npossession till required again. The single book in the parcel was\r\nhanded to me for the experiment.\r\nIt is perhaps worth noting that the three people who supplied the\r\nbooks were not known to each other and did not meet during the\r\ncourse of the experiment, so that no list of the books in the sack\r\ncould have been compiled.\r\nWe now had a book taken at random in such a way that no earthly\r\nmind could be aware of its title. I placed it in a position easy to describe\u2014in the bookcase behind\r\nmy study door, third shelf up and at end nearest the door.\r\nArrangements being thus complete I asked my father if he would\r\nendeavour to ascertain a few facts about this book, sufficient to\r\nmake clear that he had gained access to it. He agreed to try and at a subsequent sitting told me his findings. The five statements were\r\ntaken down by my stenographer and, when typed out, were handed\r\nto Dr Woolley, who then in my presence opened the packet, after\r\nsatisfying himself that the seals were intact. Here in brief form we\r\nshall see what was stated and how it compared with the sealed book.\r\n(1) \" It is not complete, should have other books with it although\r\nit appears like a complete volume.\"\r\nThis book has a loose cover which reads \"No. 457, Everyman's\r\nLibrary \"\r\n; and the final words of the book are \" End Vol. 2.\"\r\n(2) \" There is a person's name beginning with ' G ' composed of\r\nseveral letters, like the writer or owner of the book.\"\r\nOn the fly leaf there is printed a single sentence, and underneath it the author's name, Glanvill.\r\n(3) \" The outside of the book would suggest things of the old\r\n306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1936\r\nworld and of the new world, the old style and the new, old days and\r\npresent days.\"\r\nThis was most apposite. The title reads \" Socratic Discourses by\r\nPlato and Xenophon. Introduction by A. D. Lindsay M.A. Classical. Everyman's Library. J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd. E. P. Dutton.\"\r\n(4) \" Old style print right at the beginning when you look\r\nat it you would say they don't put it like that nowadays. This was\r\nat the very beginning of the book.\"\r\nThis is entirely correct. The title page is surrounded by heavy\r\nblack conventional design and the printing imitates ancient wood\r\ntype. The whole thing aims to look antique.\r\n(5) \" Counting from the commencement on the 13th page find\r\nsomething to do with geometry.\"\r\nCounting as directed brought us to page xhi of the Introduction.\r\nThe first seven lines of this page read as follows : \" For if we have learnt geometry and housebuilding, we are in\r\nhaving done so housebuilders and geometers. That is why Socrates\r\ninquired what justice is, and not how and from what conditions it comes into being. Now this is perfectly right in the theoretical\r\nsciences ; for astronomy and natural science and geometry are con- cerned with nothing but the knowledge and contemplation of the\r\nnature of the subject of these sciences \"\r\nIt will be seen that geometry is named three times in this quotation. I can find no further reference to geometry, either in the context or elsewhere in the book.\r\nThe success of the above experiment indicated, what I had already\r\nproved to my own satisfaction, that my communicator could give\r\nme information about a book which I had not read. We can therefore . . . proceed with entire certainty that the sitter's memory need\r\nnot be the source from which book test information is derived.\"\r\nSeven other experiments were carried out under the same conditions, of which four were complete failures. The second and third\r\nexperiments (described by Mr Drayton Thomas in his paper), al- though they presented points of interest, were by no means as\r\nsuccessful as the first. Mr Thomas concludes : \" One is reminded\r\nof the way in which the book tests, given to Mrs Leonard's sitters in\r\n1917-18 so successfully, later began to fail in quality and finally\r\nceased. It is as though interest diminished somewhere or in some\r\none, or possibly some aspect of the mediumistic mind resented being\r\nused in this way. The fact remains that a particular fine of experiment seems to play itself out and cannot be successfully revived\r\nagain until after a period of rest.\"\r\nDecember 1936 Case 307\r\nMr Drayton Thomas included in his paper two other successful\r\nbook tests. One of these, concerning a place in which he and his\r\nfather, the communicator, had worked together, is of interest be- cause \" it brought together facts which were unknown in their\r\nentirety to any single mind on earth and included some that were\r\npersonal to my father and me.\" This test has already been described\r\nin a book by Mr Thomas now out of print and he hopes to re-publish\r\nit in a book which is to appear shortly.\r\nThe remaining test was concerned with a volume of Byron which\r\nhad been the property of Mr Thomas's grandfather, and showed evidence of having been \" devised and carried through by the memory\r\nand observation of my grandfather, assisted by his son Alfred in\r\nwhose possession the book had been.\" This test also Mr Thomas\r\nhopes to publish in detail later.\r\nSPONTANEOUS CASE. A PRECOGNITIVE DREAM\r\nIn response to the appeal this year that Members should send in\r\naccounts of Spontaneous Cases more freely, the following account of\r\na precognitive dream came in letter form from Lt. Colonel C. R. L.\r\nFitzGerald, a new member. Unfortunately, although corroborated\r\nin some degree, the date of the occurrence is 1913, and there is no\r\ncontemporary record ; so that the case cannot be assigned the importance possibly really due to it, and is therefore not numbered.\r\nBeing, however, interesting in its subject matter, it has been thought\r\nworth printing. Moreover, in sending it, Colonel FitzGerald remarked,\r\n\" I met one [of the two ladies mentioned in the account, page 309]\r\nquite recently in the street, after an interval of twenty-three years.\r\nShe recognised me, and the first thing she said was\u2014' Do you re- member that dream you had about Colonel Rowlandson's death ?\r\n' \"\r\nThis led to a request that Colonel FitzGerald should trace the lady's\r\naddress and ask for her version of the story without reminding her\r\nof further details, for the conversation they had had on meeting had\r\nnot entered further into the story than her spontaneous reminder.\r\nColonel FitzGerald very kindly took this trouble, and his friend,\r\nMrs Bromley, equally kindly responded, sending her account direct to\r\nthe Hon. Editor of the Journal, and it is printed after the story of the\r\ndream. The date in Mrs Bromley's account is 191 1\r\n, but she indicates\r\nin a covering note that she is not sure of the year, adding however that\r\n\" it was a curious happening and impressed itself on my memory.\"\r\nThe correspondence and original letter are all filed at the\r\nOffice of the S.P.R. In some preliminary pages of the letter in which\r\nhe relates the dream, Colonel FitzGerald says that, while home on\r\nP3\r\n308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1936\r\nleave in 1910, lie heard that a certain Colonel A. T. Rowlandson\r\nwas being transferred to command the regiment to which he himself (then a Captain) belonged\u2014the 126th Baluchistan Infantry of\r\nthe Indian Army ; and that, by chance, he discovered that his own\r\ngrandfather and Colonel Rowlandson's grandfather had been very\r\ngreat friends.\r\nThis the then Captain FitzGerald never mentioned to Colonel\r\nRowlandson, since he felt it might seem like courting favour with\r\na new commanding officer, and although the correspondence shows\r\nthat it is likely that Colonel Rowlandson did hear of it he never mentioned it to the junior officer. Colonel FitzGerald says that he\r\n\" attaches importance to the link of the two grandfathers, though it may not be relevant to the character of the dream,\" and for this reason the link is briefly indicated above. He then goes on to tell his\r\nstory, saying\r\n\r\n\" In any case, the Colonel became very attached to me : it would\r\nbe no exaggeration to say that I was markedly his favourite in the\r\nregiment.\r\nIn 1912 in Hong Kong he made me his adjutant, and we worked in\r\nclose co-operation and understanding until his death. In July 1913,\r\nI think on the night of 11th- 12th (the exactness of the date does not\r\nappear to be material) I had a remarkable dream. It was definitely\r\ndivided into three dream pictures in which I was taking no partmerely an observer. They were, all three, very vivid.\r\nIn the first, I saw an open, grass-grown space, the grass short as in a playing-field rather than a meadow. There was nothing on it, and\r\nit was bordered in the near distance by a pale, rather hazy blue,\r\nwhich I presume to have been sky.\r\nSuddenly from behind my right I saw Colonel A. T. Rowlandson\r\nride out on to the grass. He was mounted on a light grey, or white,\r\npony and was dressed rather peculiarly\u2014a white cotton polo shirt,\r\nand white flannel tennis trousers which were strapped at the knees to\r\nfacilitate riding. 1 The picture was then abruptly blotted out. I saw\r\nnothing further.\r\nAlmost immediately a second vivid picture appeared. The same\r\nfield, Colonel Rowlandson was lying on his back, his head almost\r\ntouching my feet, his right leg crossed under his left leg. He wore\r\nthe same clothes as in the first picture. His eyes were closed and he\r\ndid not move. Then I heard, coming apparently from behind me, in a\r\nclear and level voice, the words : \" Take care for the Colonel's head.\"\r\n1 Italics here and on p. 310 are mine, since the dress was, I learn, \" very\r\nunusual \" in respect of the white flannel tennis trousers strapped at the knee.\r\nHon.-Ed.\r\nDecember 1936 Case 309\r\nThat dream too disappeared abruptly, and a third scene took its\r\nplace.\r\nAgain the grass-grown space or field, nothing on it. Then again\r\nfrom behind my right came a dhoolie (Indian Utter used as ambulance) covered with a dark green material and borne by two bearers\r\nin the uniform of the military hospital. They were bearing the\r\ndhoolie away. It was covered up. I could not see who was in it. Then the same voice behind me spoke again and said : \" The\r\nColonel is dead.\"\r\nI awoke. It was early\u2014about 6 a.m. The dream-pictures left a very clear impression on my mind. All that morning I had an\r\nalmost indescribable sensation. Great clearness of mind, and yet\r\nthe feeling of being in a dream, a sort of elation as though I had been\r\nin touch with a much superior intelligence.\r\nBefore the dream, I had known that the Colonel was riding in\r\nsome sports that afternoon, but it had never dawned on my mind\r\nthat anything might happen to him.\r\nAll that morning, at breakfast and later in the regimental office,\r\nI could not get the dream out of my mind. The Colonel and I worked in the office till nearly one o'clock, when he rose to go.\r\n^ At the door of the office he turned to me and slapping his thigh\r\nwith his cane, said, \" I'm very gay today, FitzGerald, I'm lunching\r\nwith the s, riding in the gymkhana this afternoon and dining\r\nwith the s tonight.\"\r\nAt that moment I had a strong urge to tell him of my dream, but\r\nI knew him too well to think that for a moment he would consider\r\nit seriously. He was not made that way. And then he was gone.\r\nAfter lunch I was delayed by some duties and did not start for\r\nthe sports' ground till towards 4 p.m. As I passed the gate on to the\r\nground, a low roar went up from the crowd of soldiers, sepoys and\r\nothers who were looking on. Something had happened.\r\nI hurried forward to the outer fringe of the crowd. Two ladies,\r\nwhom I knew, were standing there. I joined them and on tiptoe\r\nlooked over the heads of the crowd. On the far side of the ground\r\nColonel Rowlandson was lying on the grass beside his horse, but he\r\ngot up and began to brush his white sun helmet with his arm. I was\r\nglad to see that he seemed to be fairly all right, and I quite cheerfully told the two ladies that I was relieved to see him thus, because\r\nI had dreamed early that morning that he had had a serious accident.\r\nThen I invited the ladies to have tea with me, and we moved to\r\nthe tea tent. I selected a table at the side of the tent, the wall of\r\nwhich had been taken away, so that we were sitting right on the edge\r\nof the fairway past the tent.\r\n310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1936\r\nIn a very short time the Colonel came by. He was dressed as I had\r\nseen him in my dream. He looked very pale and carried his head\r\nvery high. He did not look our way. He was looking straight in\r\nfront of him.\r\nI said to the ladies, \" I am glad to see that he is not seriously\r\nhurt, because I dreamed that he had been killed.\" I had hardly\r\nspoken the words when I saw some people hurrying up. On the\r\nground, within a yard of our table lay Colonel Rowlandson, on his\r\nback, his head towards us, his eyes closed and his right leg crossed\r\nunder his left, exactly as I had seen him in my second dreampicture.\r\nSoon the rumour got over the ground that I had dreamed this\r\ndream. The Second-in-Command, Major Wooldridge1 came up to\r\nask me about it. I said, \" the Colonel will die.\" He said, \" Nonsense,\r\nFitz, I don't believe it.\" Colonel Rowlandson never regained consciousness. A little later\r\nhe was carried from the ground in a green-covered army hospital\r\ndhoolie by two bearers. The hospital was close by. He died immediately after reaching it. There is one curious discrepancy in this dream, which it would\r\ninterest me to have explained. I dreamt that the Colonel was\r\nriding a light-grey or whitish horse, but actually his horse was a very\r\ndark brown, and I knew this well. I had previously had a light-grey\r\nArab pony and this is the only connection I can make with the\r\nmatter. But the Colonel had never ridden that pony of mine.\"\r\nCorroborative Statement sent by Mrs H. Bromley from\r\n5 Westminster, Shaftesbury Road, Southsea\r\nDated June 10, 1936\r\n\" In the summer of 1911, my husband and I attended a Gymkhana\r\ngiven by the officers of the 126th Baluchis, stationed at Kowloon,\r\nHong Kong.\r\nWe were watching the sports in company with some friends,\r\nColonel and Mrs Stewart, when we were joined by Captain\u2014now\r\nColonel C. R. L. FitzGerald.\r\nHe was unhappy and disturbed over a vivid dream he had had\r\nthe previous night\u2014a dream which had very much impressed him,\r\nand which he then related to us. In his dream he saw the Sports in progress, just as it was, at the\r\nmoment of speaking. When the pig-sticking event took place, he saw\r\nhis Colonel taking part\u2014as he rode round the field, he was thrown\r\n1 Died soon after the Great War. C.R.L.F.\r\nDecember 1936 Case 311\r\nheavily. A crowd rushed to assist him but he was fatally injured\r\nand was carried dead off the field. Our conversation turned on the fallacy of relying on dreams, and\r\nthe folly of allowing them to affect us, etc. etc., as we could see that\r\nCaptain FitzGerald was anxious, and nervous. After some minutes the pig-sticking event came on the programme, and among the officers taking part was the Colonel of his\r\nregiment.\r\nHe came galloping past us, and on\u2014when suddenly he took a\r\nviolent toss, and was thrown headlong from his mount. A crowd\r\nrushed to assist him. After lying on the ground for some minutes he\r\nwas helped to his feet, and strode off as if unhurt.\r\nWith a great sense of relief, we proceeded to the marquee for tea. Just as we sat down, we saw the Colonel coming walking towards\r\nthe marquee. As he came in fine with our table he stumbled and fell heavily.\r\nHe was carried off on a stretcher, and died on his way to hospital.\"\r\nNOTES ON EESEARCH UNDERTAKEN\r\nAn interesting case of \" poltergeist \" manifestations in a house near Leeds was ably investigated on behalf of the Society by Mr P. H.\r\nGuenault of Leeds University. Mr Guenault's report may be seen\r\nat the Society's rooms. The quantitative \" book test \" experiment is being continued\r\nwith the co-operation of Mrs Leonard and Mr Irving. Two tests have now been carried out.\r\nA few \" spontaneous cases \" have been received, one of which,\r\nit is hoped, may prove of sufficient evidential value for printing.\r\nThe investigation of this case is being carried out by the Secretary,\r\nMiss Newton.\r\nA claim to have discovered a connection between certain current\r\nevents and forecasts made by astrological methods is being investigated. It is not yet possible to say if the connection is real or imaginary. C. V. C. H.\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nMemory and Telepathy\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014It is a pity that Mr. Carden, in his letter in the October\r\nJournal, should make such an extraordinary error as he does. He\r\nasserts that \" Brain cells grow and divide to form daughter cells.\"\r\n312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1936\r\nIt is, however, well-known that nerve-cells, once they have become\r\ndifferentiated, never divide. This holds for all higher animals so far\r\ninvestigated.\r\nWhen, however, he further identifies an engram with \" the ultramicroscopic particle of electricity within the nucleus of a brain-cell,\" one may be pardoned for not taking his views very seriously.\r\nWhatever the material basis of memory be called, there are few who\r\nwould deny that it must exist : but an elementary knowledge of\r\nphysiology should make it clear that even the simplest memorytrace must involve a very large number of nerve-cells.\r\nYours etc. Julian S. Huxley.\r\nScarcity of Spontaneous Cases\r\nTo the Hon. Editor of The Journal\r\nMadam,\u2014 I am very much obliged to Mr Salter for quoting, in the\r\nJournal for July, from Phantasms of the Living an excellent passage\r\nwhich seems wholly to exonerate the founders of the Society from\r\nthe insidious logical error I was castigating. At the same time I also\r\nhad definite cases in mind when I censured certain officials of the\r\nSociety, though, fortunately, none of them is any longer responsible\r\nfor the handling of \" spontaneous \" cases. For example, a review\r\nby me of one of Mr Podmore's later and ultra-sceptical books was not\r\nallowed to appear, because I had made against him the point in question, that of not allowing the evidence to accumulate. Another,\r\nmuch later, case was that of an attractive story, involving an\r\napparently supernormal photograph (by an amateur), which was\r\nrejected because, the official assured me, he had hundreds of much\r\nbetter cases he had not published. \" Well \", I retorted, \" if so, I can only say that you are suppressing a great deal of valuable\r\nevidence ! \" The tendency to treat each case as standing alone is a\r\nreal danger, which is always recurring.\r\nI am, Madam, etc.\r\nF. C. S. Schiller.\r\n3710 Globe Ave., Los Angeles, Calif.\r\nDecember 1936 Review 313\r\nREVIEW\r\nLord Halifax's Ghost Book. With a foreword by Viscount Halifax,\r\nK.G. Geoffrey Bles. London 1936. Price 8s. 6d. net. The impression produced by this book is twofold. On the one hand its publication is to be welcomed, for it seems at first sight\r\ncalculated to make our researches more popular and more widely\r\nknown ; also to prove that even bearers of illustrious names do not\r\neschew ghost stories at times, nay, like dabbling in them. On the\r\nother hand, Lord Halifax s Ghost Booh leaves much to be desired\r\nfrom the standpoint of the quality of some of the records.\r\nOf the narratives a few are good but others are distinctly unsatisfactory.\r\nTo begin with, two narratives (pp. 196 and 201) have nothing to\r\ndo with ghosts, whether genuine or fraudulent. The second of these\r\ntwo in particular (\" The Bordeaux Diligence \") is even an obvious\r\njoke.\r\nOf the last narrative in the book (\" Colonel P's Ghost Story \") we\r\nread (p. 211) that it \" makes no pretence at authenticity, but was\r\nof Lord Halifax's own invention.\"\r\nThe story entitled \" The Gentleman with the Latch-key,\" was\r\n\" told by Lord Falmouth to Lord Grenfell, Lord Methuen and his son Paul (the present Lord Methuen). Lord Falmouth had been told\r\nthe story by a friend, who had heard it from the man to whom it happened \"\r\n(p. 193). So far as Lord Halifax is concerned the story\r\nwas therefore at least third, possibly fourth-hand.\r\nOn page 183 there is the beginning of a story told Lord Halifax in\r\nDecember 1920 by a nephew of his, Mr Charles Dunclas, who heard\r\nit from a military aviator named Villiers. Such as it is, it might therefore be regarded as third-hand\u2014which is bad enough \u2014were it not for the fact that Villiers himself was certainly no\r\neye-witness. Let us not, however, regret too much that the case cannot be properly authenticated : the idea that an airman, be he an Australian, is capable, if a loser at poker, of wreaking an awful\r\npost mortem vengeance on his co-players is rather too repugnant to\r\nbe entertained ! In such a story as that of Miss Johnes whose future is forecast by\r\nLord Lytton (p. 209) there are no ghosts whatever. It is true that\r\nLord Lytton's predictions are alleged to have been quite correct, but \u2014the story was sent to Lord Halifax by Lady Margaret Shelley,\r\nabout whose relation to Miss Johnes we know nothing.\r\nIn some cases the incidents described may be termed puzzling\r\nrather than suggestive of something supernormal ; e.g. the ones\r\n314 J'ournal of Society for Psychical Research December 1936\r\nconcerning the Eev. Spencer Nairne and \" evidently \" written by\r\nhimself, where mistaken identity seems after all a possible explanation (pp. 111-117).\r\nThis list of unsatisfactory cases in Lord Halifax's Ghost Booh\r\nis unfortunately not complete, but the instances quoted are sufficient \u2014and sufficiently characteristic.\r\nLet us now say a few words about the more or less satisfactory\r\ncases. These are not numerous, but there are some which deserve\r\nattention.\r\nI will mention the alleged hauntings in a house at Lille (pp. 11-19) ; the story entitled \" The Grey Man at Wrotham,\" where\u2014exceptionally\u2014corroborative evidence is supplied by a nurse (pp. 39-45) ; the\r\ncase of the ghost seen at Benishaw (the country house of the Sitwells,\r\nin Derbyshire) by two persons successively on the same day (pp. 123-\r\n125) ; the case described, in a letter to Lord Halifax, by a Charles\r\nG. S. (pp. 143-147) ; possibly also the story narrated on pp. 141-143.\r\nThis last case is, it should be said, second-hand, but Lord Halifax\r\ntells us : \" To his dying day my old friend Reginald Easton, the\r\nartist, persisted in the truth of the following story.\" In this case the ghost of an old murderess appears in a haunted room on seven\r\nconsecutive nights, thus presenting us with a nut somewhat hard\r\nto crack. But perhaps this is an insufficient reason for disbelieving\r\naltogether in Mr Easton's account.\r\nFinally I will mention the \" monk \" seen in August 1912 in Bolton\r\nAbbey by the present Marquis of Hartington. King George V was\r\nstaying at the Abbey at the time.\r\nThe very dramatic \" Telephone at the Oratory \" case is, I think,\r\nsusceptible of a normal explanation. Our readers will find it in the\r\nS.P.R. Journal, Vol. XIX, p. 83, but I may be permitted to make a few comments on it. Let us note first that Father C.'s experience\r\ncannot, in any case, be explained by a post mortem agency, since\r\nMrs P. was alive at the time. The experience in question may\r\ntherefore have been due to an \" orthodox \" telepathic impact. But\r\neven such an explanation may seem superfluous. Father C. had un- doubtedly been strongly impressed by Mrs P.'s state ; he tells us that he regretted having promised her doctor not to administer the\r\nlast rites on his first visit ; it is perfectly conceivable that such a\r\nstate of mind may have induced in him a\r\n\" borderland \" hallucination or quasi-hallucination connected with the telephone message.\r\nThe coincidence may therefore have been purely fortuitous.\r\nMy attention has been particularly attracted by a short story\r\n(alas, third-hand) called \" The Haunted Bungalow,\" because such as\r\nit stands it seems to confirm a hypothesis I have long thought\r\nDecember 1936 Review 315\r\nplausible with, a view to explaining some at least of the alleged\r\nhauntings. In 1871 a friend of the above-mentioned Mr Dundas,\r\nTroward by name, and his wife, when in India, had to spend the\r\nnight in a bungalow which had been hastily got ready for them and\r\nwhich it seems had a bad reputation with the servants.\r\n\" In the middle of the night Mr Troward was awakened by a loud\r\nreport, followed by terrified cries and screams from his wife. When\r\nhe asked her what was the matter, she said that a man in a grey suit\r\nhad come up to the side of the bed and leant over her, saying :\r\n' Lie\r\nstill, I shall not hurt you.' He had then fired a pistol or gun across her over the bed \"\r\n(p. 187). In the morning it was ascertained by\r\nthe Trowards that a Mr de Courcy, formerly Commissioner at\r\nHoshiarpur, had shot himself in the middle of the night in this very\r\nbungalow, leaning across the bed and saying to Mrs de Courcy : \"I\r\nshall not hurt you.\"\r\nLet us suppose that the incident occurred as described. Surely it suggests much less continuous action on the part of the unfortunate\r\ndead man, senselessly repeating the same fatal act and the same\r\nmoving words, than perception of what occurred once by a person of\r\npeculiar psycho-physical organisation.
