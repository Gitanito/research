Hallucination.\nThe following case of a sensory hallucination, perhaps tele-\npathically induced, has been sent to us through Miss Agnes\nFry, who is a Life Member of the Society. The percipient\n\fJan,, 1915. Case. 3\nwas Miss Winifred Gill, Millbrook House, Guildford, and she\nrecords her experience as follows\n:\nSunday, January 18, 1914.\nTo-night at about 8.30 (certainly between 8 and 9) I came\ndownstairs into the hail, and as I reached the last stair I looked\nup and saw what I could only suppose to be our maid Lizzie come\nfrom the direction of the front door and pass me, going downstairs\nto the kitchen. I knew that she had been suffering a good deal\nfrom toothache, and although she was not due to come in until\n9.30, I supposed that it being a cold night she had come in early.\nI was going to address some remark to her on the subject, but she\nlooked straight in front of her in a way that gave the suggestion\nof sullenness, and I hesitated and changed my mind.\nI noticed that she was dressed in a dark coat and skirt, navy\nblue or black, and that her hat was lined with green velvet, a\nfact which surprised me, as Lizzie has been in mourning for some\ntime.\nI wondered how she had got in without my hearing the bell or\nthe front door close, and, when I came to think of it, who had\nopened the door to her, as I could hear my aunt in the kitchen,\nand I found my sister reading in the drawing-room. However, I\niiad some business on hand which took my attention, and the\nmatter passed out of ray mind.\nI was down in the kitchen later on for about half an hour, and\nnot finding Lizzie there, supposed her to be in her bedroom.\nAt 9.30 she did not appear, and my aunt remarked that the girl\nwas late. I then told her that Lizzie had been in more than an\nhour, for I had seen her ; that I particularly noticed she had green\nvelvet in her hat, whereas I had thought she was in mourning ; and\nthat my sister had said, \"Oh no, she is just out of it. She has a coat\nwith a purple collar to it.\" \"In that case,\" said my aunt, \"let us\nring for her.\" She did not come, however, and I was crossing the\nhall ten minutes later to see if there were a light in her room when\nthe door-bell rang. It was Lizzie herself this time wearing a long\ngrey coat with a purple collar and a plain black hat. She struck\nme as looking unexpectedly short.\nI asked if she had been in before. She looked very surprised,\nand said, \" Why, no. Miss Winnie, but I was rather late out ; it\nwas nearly eight before I went.\"\nI tried to recall the appearance of the girl I had seen. She\nstruck me now, on looking back, and with the real Lizzie before\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1915.\nme, as having been slightlj' taller and certainly broader. She had\nworn a coat and skirt such as Lizzie usually wears, and I did not\nremember that she had worn glasses, in fact as well as I could\nremember I was almost certain that she had not.\nMy mother, whose memory for detail is very retentive, said she\nfelt sure that Lizzie had had a hat trimmed with green velvet when\nshe first came, so that I decided I would ask her in the morning.\nMonday, January 19, 1914.\nAs I was going to sleep last night I tried to think which of our\nformer maids it could have been that I saw, if not Lizzie, and I\ndecided that it probably was Nellie Lee, a girl who left us more\nthan ten years before. I dreamed about her then, seeing her face\nvery clearly. She was wearing in my dream a green velvet hat.\nIn the morning I asked Lizzie if she had, or had ever had, a hat\nwith green velvet in it, and she said yes\u2014when she first came, but\nshe had only worn it about once. The velvet was round the hat,\nbut not under the brim, and it was a very dark green. She no\nlonger possessed the hat.\nMy mother on hearing this said, \" There is only one other girl I\ncan think of M'ho it might have been, and that is Nellie Lee. She\nwas a little taller than Lizzie and stouter, and she had a hat made\nof green velvet. She has been in my thoughts a good deal lately,\nfor no reason that I know of.\"^\nI had no sensation of fear or surprise when I met the girl. I\nparticularly remember that I heard her walking on the oil-cloth ; in\nfact, there was nothing to show that it was not a being of flesh\nand blood. She passed between me and the light, and her face\nwas in shadow, which partly accounted for my mistaking her for\nLizzie.\nI was about twelve years old when Nellie Lee left, and do not\nremember to have seen her since. I believe she left the town\nalmost immediately.\nWinifred M. Gill.\nMrs. Gill corroborates Miss Gill's statement, thus\n:\nJanuary 29, 1914.\nOn Sunday, January 18, 1914, I was in my room by about\n7.30 in the evening ;\nmy son was helping me with some business\n^ When Miss Gill wrote this report, she was not aware of her brother\nhaving recently met Nellie Lee and spoken of her to Mrs. Gill. She heard\nof this next day, January 20, 1914. (See below.)\u2014Ed.\n\fJan., 1915. Case. 5\nrelating to my late husband's affairs, and we were very much\noccupied. Winifred was out to tea.\nI think it was about 8 o'clock when she came back, and I asked\nher to fetch the papers from downstairs, which she did, and went\ndown again.\nShe came up at about 9 with my supper\u2014which she had cooked\nherself\u2014and we only said a few words about her visit in the\nafternoon.\nAt about 9.45 Winifred came up and told me that when she\nwent down after fetching me the papers she saw the servant\nLizzie\u2014who was out for the evening\u2014cross the hall, from the\ndirection of the door, and go down the kitchen stairs. Winifred\nwent straight into the drawing-room where her sister Rosalind was\nsitting and told her that Lizzie had come in, and no doubt would\nget the supper. She waited a while, but as her Aunt Mary did\nnot come upstairs, she concluded Lizzie was not well and had\ngone to her bedroom, so she went to the kitchen and helped\nprepare supper.\nAt a few minutes past 9.30 Aunt Mary had remarked, \"Lizzie\nis late.\" Winifred had said, \" Oh, no, she came in at 8.30, and\nwent straight to the kitchen.\" Aunt Mary remarked that she had\nheard no one come down, and also asked how Lizzie could have\ngot into the house, as the door was locked.\nAfter Winifred had told me, I said, \" I wonder if one of our\nold maids was thinking of us and of coming into the house.\" The\nonly one I could think of at all like Lizzie was Nellie Lee, and I\nbad been thinking about her lately. My son met her not long\nbefore Christmas and came back and told me about it, and we\nremarked on how she had changed from the pretty, bright girl she\nused to be. (Winifred had not heard of this.) Nellie Lee was a\nfair girl, rather taller and larger-built than Lizzie, but might well\nresemble her in a bad light. She did not wear glasses, and, I feel\nsure, had a hat turned up with green velvet, as I used to notice\nhow pretty her hair looked against it. ,^ . ^\nSarah Alice Gill.\nMiss Gill's brother also corroborates her statement, thus:\nDecember 1, 1914.^\nI was in my Mother's room on the evening of January 18th when\nmy sister Winifred came up and told us of her experience, as related\n^ In view of the fact that Mr. Gill's corroboration was not obtained for nearly\na year, Miss Gill writes that his memory for details is very retentive.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1915.\nin my mother's account\u2014which I fully corroborate. I particularly\nremember her saying that the figure wore a green velvet hat, but\nno mention was made in my presence of Nellie Lee.\n. .\nRaymond Gill.\nMiss Verrall, who had an intervievp with Miss Gill, makes\nthe following statement, based on contemporary notes\n:\nMiss Gill came to see me, by appointment, on January 28,\n1914. I questioned her as to whether there was any possibility\nthat the figure she saw in the hall was the maid, Lizzie, going\nout, but she said that this explanation was excluded for several\nreasons\n:\n(a) Lizzie had gone out a little before 8 p.m, (see above),\nwhereas it was certainly after 8 p.m. when she saw the figure.\n(b) The clothes which the figure was wearing diff'ered noticeably\nin several ways from the clothes which Lizzie was wearing that\nevening, e.g. as regards the coat and skirt, \u2014not a long coat, \u2014and the\nhat lined with green velvet.\n(c) If the girl had been Lizzie on her way out, she would pre-\nsumably have been seen walking from the kitchen stairs to the\nfront door instead of in the reverse direction. It was impossible\nfor any one without a key to get in at the front door without\nbeing let in, unless the door was \" on the latch.\" As Miss Gill\nhad let herself in with a latch-key about twenty minutes earlier,\nand, so far as she or any one else in the house knew, no one had\ncome in since, she had every reason to think that the door was\nlatched as usual that evening.\nIn explanation of the statement in her original record that she\n\" did not remember that [the girl she saw] wore glasses,\" she\nsaid that Lizzie wore rather conspicuous spectacles.\nShe also said that according to the recollection of Mrs. Gill and\nherself no mention was made between them of Nellie Lee until\nJanuary 19, 1914, i.e. until after Miss Gill's dream about her.\nIt was on January 20, 1914, that Mrs. Gill told her of her\nbrother having met Nellie Lee a few weeks before Christmas.\nH. DE G. Verrall.\nThis case presents two points of interest :\n(i) There seems little doubt that Miss Gill experienced on\nthis occasion a vivid sensory hallucination. For there is\ngood reason to believe that at the time when Miss Gill saw\nthe figure which she describes no person answering to this\n\fJan., 1915. Case. 7\ndescription was present. The inmates of the house, as is\nclear from the narratives of Mrs. and Miss Gill, were otherwise\naccounted for, and it seems certain that no one could have\nentered the house without being admitted from within. From\nMiss Gill's statement that she particularly remembers hear-\ning the figure walking on the oil-cloth, it appears that the\nhallucination was of two senses.\n(ii) As to what may have caused this hallucination, whether,\nfor instance, it was telepathically induced, the case is not so clear.\nIf Mrs. and Miss Gill and Mr. Eaymond Gill are right in their\nrecollection that no mention was made of Nellie Lee in Miss\nGill's presence until after her dream on the night of January\n18-19, it is certainly curious that Miss Gill should independently\nhave reached the conclusion that the figure she saw was that\nof Nellie Lee, and that she should have had this impression\nat a time when, unknown to her, Nellie Lee, whom she had\nnot seen for more than ten years, had been in Mrs. Gill's\nthoughts. It is, however, difficult to be sure that nothing\nwas said to Miss Gill on the evening of January 18, which\nmight have suggested Nellie Lee to her, especially in view of\nthe fact that, according to Mrs. Gill's statement, when she\nheard of her daughter's experience, she said :\n\" I wonder if one\nof our old maids was thinking of us and of coming into the\nhouse.\"\nBut, even if we suppose that Miss Gill's dream and her\nconscious identification of the apparition with Nellie Lee were\nthe result of some suggestion made to her by Mrs. Gill,\nthere is one piece of evidence connecting the apparition with\nNellie Lee which cannot be so explained, namely, the hat\nlined with green velvet. This part of Miss Gill's impression\nwas evidently prior to any conversation she had on the\nsubject with Mrs. Gill, because she spoke of it almost imme-_\ndiately to her sister, when she was still under the impression\nthat the figure she had seen was that of the maid Lizzie.\nMiss Eosalind Gill's corroboration cannot now be obtained, but\nMr. Eaymond Gill, in the statement which has been quoted\nabove, says that he particularly remembers that in her original\naccount of her experience to Mrs. Gill and himself, Miss Gill\nmentioned the green velvet hat.\nIf any telepathic influence was involved, it came, pre-\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1915.\nsurnably, from Mrs. Gill's mind, since she had recently been\nreminded of Nellie Lee and is sure that she \" had a hat turned\nup with green velvet, as I used to notice how pretty her hair\nlooked against it.\"\nMiss Gill said, in reply to a question, that she had never\nhad any similar hallucination before, although she had had\nseveral curious experiences of a premonitory character.\nA SUPPOSED CASE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.\nIn the Annalen der Natur- und CuUur-Philosophie (Ed. Wilhelm\nOstwald) for October, 1913, there appeared an article by W.\nvon Wasielewski entitled \" Concerning a Case of Experimental\nClairvoyance.\" Our attention was called to this article shortly\nafter its appearance by one of our Associates, Professor Hans\nDriesch, but we have not hitherto published any report upon\nit, partly from lack of space, and partly because the author\nheld out hopes of a further and more conclusive series of\nexperiments, which, so far as we know, have not yet been\ncarried out.\nThe experiments were conducted by Herr von Wasielewski\nhimself, the subject being a young lady of his acquaintance,\nFraulein von B., whom he describes as enjoying excellent\nphysical and mental health. She had not apparently tried any\nsimilar experiments before, but \" for various reasons \" Herr\nvon Wasielewski concluded that she was likely to be \" gifted\nas regards the phenomena in question,\" namely telepathy and\nclairvoyance.\nThe first experiments, in the early summer of 1912, were\nconcerned with automatic writing and telepathy. Herr von\nWasielewski describes them as \" successful,\" but gives no\ndetails. Towards the end of the year the question occurred\nto him \" whether Fraulein von B. would be able to recognise\nan object in a closed box without any mental assistance\nfrom me.\"\nBy way of a preliminary experiment I packed a key about six centi-\nmetres long between folded paper in a cardboard box, which I corded\nand sealed with my own seal.\nI told Fraulein von B. to go with this box into an adjoining room,\nlie down on the sofa, and try whether she could under these conditions.\n\fJan., 1915. A Sujyposed Case of Clairvoyance. 9\ndiscover its contents. . . . During her absence I read a book which\ninterested me, in order not to think of the key, and succeeded in my\npurpose. After about eight minutes Fraulein von B. came back and\ntold me that she felt sure she had been successful. In the first place\nshe was certain that the object was of metal. Secondly, its form\nwas that of a key : a ring, then a shank, and at the top a projecting\npiece, hke the wards of a key. She therefore believed the object to\nbe a key, of such and such a length (measuring out the right distance\nwith her hands). I ascertained by careful examination that the cord-\ning and sealing of the box were untouched.\nIt might seem from this description that Herr von Wasie-\nlewski does not clearly distinguish between telepathy and\nclairvoyance in the true sense of the word, i.e. a perception\nderived neither through the ordinary channels of sense, nor\nfrom any other mind, since the fact that he w^as not con-\nsciously trying to influence Fraulein von B. at the time of the\nexperiment affects hardly at all the question as to whether she\nderived her impression from his mind. Later on in his report,\nhowever, Herr von Wasielewski does distinguish between the\ntwo types of phenomena, and puts forward reasons for thinking\nthat in the case of Fraulein von B. we have to deal with\nclairvoyance rather than thought-transference.\n[Experience] clearly points to the fact that telepathy and clair-\nvoyance are distinct although interrelated phenomena ; there is tele-\npathy proper (communication from one mind to another), and there\nis clairvoyance proper, without any such communication. Moreover,\nin my opinion it is as good as certain\u2014and later I hope to estabUsh\nbeyond doubt what I can now only put forward as a probability\n\u2014\nthat in the experiments with which we are here concerned, we have\nto do with clairvoyance and not with, telepathy.\nThe reasons which Herr von Wasielewski adduces in support\nof this conclusion are that, whereas in the case of his earlier\ntelepathic experiments with Fraulein von B.\n{a) an effort was required on the part of the agent,\n(6) not every one could play the part of agent,\n(c) separation of the agent and percipient made the experi-\nment harder ;\nin the case of the box-experiments\n(a) no effort was required on the part of the agent,\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1915.\n(6) any person could play the part of agent,\n(c) separation of the agent and percipient had no effect on\nthe result.\nFor all these reasons the hypothesis of telepathy could only be\nmaintained by supposing that any human being's bare knowledge\nof the contents of the box is sufficient to produce after an interval\nof many days an unconscious and unintentional transference of thought,\nso soon as the percipient, in this case, Fraulein von B., tries to \"see\n\"\nthe contents of the box.\nHerr von Wasielewski also attaches great weight to the fact\nthat Fraulein von B. herself declares that there is a marked\ndifference in her sensations in the two types of experiment.\nIn the case of telepathic experiments she has a series of changing\nmental images, from which one clear impression gradually\nemerges ; in the case of the box-experiments, on the other\nhand, she has a sudden detailed impression as to the pecu-\nliarities of the enclosed object, \" not so much a mental image\nof it, but rather a knowledge of its nature.\" When, for\ninstance, she was asked how she could distinguish so clearly\nbetween gold and brass, she said that gold gave her the\nimpression of a much softer metal. Fraulein von B.'s intro-\nspective analysis of her own sensations is interesting psycho-\nlogically, but Herr von Wasielewski does not seem to have\nmade any allowance for the possible effect of suggestion.\nThe weakest point of his argument for clairvoyance is that,\nas he himself admits, he has not hitherto carried out any\nexperiments under conditions \" expressly devised to exclude the\ntelepathic hypothesis,\" and considering how far stronger at the\npresent time is the evidence for telepathy than for clairvoyance,\nwe are bound, I think, to give precedence to the telepathic\nhypothesis, unless it is absolutely excluded. Moreover, some of\nHerr von Wasielewski's arguments seem to show that he does\nnot make sufficient allowance for the fact that telepathic\nimpressions may be subconsciously transmitted, and may also\nbe deferred.\nHerr von Wasielewski says that he tried fifty experiments\nin all, of which forty-five were at least partly successful.\nThe time required for each experiment was from three to ten\nminutes. He could not form any definite opinion as to the\n\fJan., 1935. A Supposed Case of Clairvoyance. 11\ncause of failure. He satisfied himself that it Avas not due to\nthe nature of the object which was to be \" perceived,\" or of\nthe material used for the outer wrapping. In describing the\nconditions under which the experiments were conducted, Herr\nvon Wasielewski says that, although he is personally convinced\nof Fraulein von B.'s absolute trustworthiness, he is aware that\nthis argument will not carry weight with the general public,\nand, moreover, the possibility of unconscious fraud has to be\ntaken into account.\nTo form any conjecture as to their content from the outside of the\nboxes was impossible. They consisted, in most cases, of thin, but\nstrong and stiff cardboard, . . . and later on they were often of tin.\n. . . The size and shape of the boxes did not bear any tell-tale rela-\ntion to their contents. For example, in the case of a fairly early\nexperiment, an object four centimetres long packed in a box about\ntwenty-five centimetres long was correctly recognised. . . .\nThe fastenings were always from the fiist knotted and sealed in\nseveral places. As a rule, I used my own seal for this purpose. In\nseveral instances parcels from people who were interested came to\nthe house ready-prepared, and provided respectively with the seals\nof those who had sent them. . . . Moreover, Fraulein von B. was\nalone with the box only for a few nunutes in a neighbouring room,\nliable to observation at any moment, and on many occasions actually\nunder observation ; often in strange houses, where no preparations\ncould be made beforehand either to copy the seals, or to take them\noff and replace them again. . . .\nIf these phenomena are to gain general recognition, it is essential\nthat we should have a guarantee against fraud, deliberate or other-\nwise, and therefore, at the risk of being tedious, I must concern myself\nwith this question a little longer. The boxes gave, as we have seen,\nno clue to their contents . . . but, in case the objection is made that\nso long as the percipient remained alone with the closed box for several\nnunutes, we have no right to say that fraud was absolutely excluded,\n... I will add that on several occasions it was found possible to\ncarry out the experiments with equal success in the presence of myself\nand other witnesses. . . .\nDr. Bayer and Professor Edmund Konig, both of this town [Leip-\nsig], the former . . . State medical-adviser, the latter a master at\nthe \"Gymnasium\" here, and author of several philosophical works\n. . . have given me permission to declare in my article in their\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1915.\nnames tliat they were present throughout the whole of one experi-\nment and thereby convinced themselves that Fraulein von B. did\nnot leave her place, nor manipulate the box in any way to\ndiscover its contents.\nIt is unfortunate that Herr von Wasielewski was not able\nto report the whole series of experiments (doubtless for reasons\nof space), but gives only a few selected instances, and even\nthose not in as much detail as might have been desired. The\nfollowing is one of the experiments which he describes. On this\noccasion Fraulein von B. was alone with the box for some minutes.\nObject. A paper-weight in the shape of an egg of reddish-brown,\nslightly speckled marble, wrapped between folded paper in a card-\nboard box. Fraulein von B. came back after an absence of eight\nminutes ; since she stated that she had not begun at once, the actual\nduration of the experiment would be about five minutes. \" It is\nan object of such and such a length (measuring off the right length\nbetween her hands), of a dark, very hard substance. But not metal ;\nI think it is stone. Judging by the shape, I should say it was a wooden\ndarning-egg of my mother's, but, as I have said, it is not of wood, also\nit is darker. And there is another peculiarity about it, that on one\nside it has a small flat surface to lie on.\" Every statement, includ-\ning the last, was correct. On the other hand, the colour was only\nnoted as dark, and, on enquiry, was not recognised more exactly.\nThis, I may add, has been hitherto a characteristic of these experi-\nments. With few exceptions, the colours of the objects are only\ndistinguished as light or dark, much as a person totally colour-blind\nmight see them. . . . Hitherto the actual colour has been recog-\nnised, as a rule, only in the case of metals, which are described as\ngrey (tin or aluminium), white (silver or nickel), brown (copper), yellow\n(gold or brass, which, however, are distinguished from one another,\nas I have said before). This rather curious circumstance is one of\nthe pecuUarities to which I referred above as bejng an argument against\ntelepathy, since in the case of telepathic communication the colour\nmust be as communicable as any other factor, and actually is so, accord-\ning to the experience of myself and other investigators. Neverthe-\nless, I note in passing that in the telepathic experiments also I had\nsome failures as well as successes in regard to colour, and this fact\nhas given me the idea of making a special enquiry on this point. At\nany rate, in the case of the box-experiments, contrary to the results\nobtained by telepathy, there was as a rule no impression of colour.\n\fJan., 1915. A Su2Jposed Case of Clairvoyance. 13\nThe following is an account of another experiment, during\nwhich Herr von Wasielewski was present throughout\n:\nObject. An empty scent-bottle, with a glass stopper, packed up\nwith paper in a tin box so that it could not move. Fraulein von B.\nput the box on this occasion on her breast. (This she usually did,\nbut the action had no influence on her success.) After about a quarter\nto half a minute she said :\n\" I feel the metal very strongly again,\nfrom my knees to my head, but another feeling also comes in between.\"\nAfter a minute :\n\" Glass.\" Then she went on with pauses of only\na second :\n\" Eather long, at the top it gets suddenly small, as though\nbroken off, then wide again, like a stopper. It is certainly a little\nbottle of glass, and the stopper is of glass too, and cut off square, not\nround\u2014the little bottle is also four-cornered.\" The size of the bottle\nand the fact that it was empty were also correctly given. The dura-\ntion of the whole experiment was about two minutes.\nHerr von Wasielewski gives one curious instance in which\nFraulein von B. received a correct impression of an object\nwhich had been accidentally included amongst the contents of\nthe box without the sender's conscious knowledge. This is the\nstrongest piece of evidence for clairvoyance against telepathy\nwhich he is able to put forward.\nHe also gives a detailed account of an experiment designed\nto show that Fraulein von B.'s abnormal powers include per-\nceptions of taste and smell. He had six small glass bottles\nmade up by a chemist, containing respectively saccharine and\nwater, distilled water, citric acid and water, quinine and water,\npeppermint essence and water, and brandy.\nThese bottles were placed one after another in a corded\ncardboard box which was laid either on Fraulein von B.'s\nforehead or on her neck. Herr von Wasielewski was present\nthroughout the whole experiment and testifies to the fact that\nshe never touched or saw the bottles. The result of the\nexperiment (in brief) was as follows :\nSubject. Impression.\nFailure.\n\" Something like port-wine, but\nlight in colour.\"\n1. Quinine.\n2. Brandy.\n3. Saccharine.\n4. Peppermint-essence. \" Peppermint.\"\n\" Sweet.\"\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1915.\n5. Distilled water. \" Something like the last, but\n6. Quinine.\n7. Citric acid.\n8.

By Maurice Maeterlinck. Translated by\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos. Meihuen & Co., London,\n1914. 340 pp. Price 5s. net.\nM. Maeterlinck's new volume is a continuation of his studies\nof the mysteries of life which were begun in the essay on Death, and\nis itself to be followed by a discussion of ''the miracles of Lourdes\nand other places, the phenomena of so-called materialization, of\nthe divining rod, and of fluidic asepsis.\" The present instalment\ncontains, in addition to a short introduction, essays on Phantasms\nof the Living and the Dead, Psychometry, the Knowledge of the\nFuture, The Elbeifeld Horses, and the Unknown Guest, of which\nthe first two have not been published before, while the others have\nrecently appeared in magazines, and one \"f them, that on the\nElberfeld horses, has been noticed in this -Journal for July, 1914,\np. 271. The whole work is very readable and suggestive, and will\nappeal the more strongly to members of the S.P.R. that its tone is\nuniformh' appreciative of the Society's work, which is constantly\nH. DE G. V.\nREVIEW.\n.A\n\fJan., 1915. 15\nquoted as authoritative, and even as more conclusive than perhaps\nit claimed to be. It is a very real impediment to progress in\nPsychical Research that when men first read the extensive\nliterature on the subject and realize how much better than they had\nexpected the evidence is, they should at once treat as established\nfact the less anomalous phenomena, such as \"telepathy,\" and use\nthem to speculate about the more anomalous, in ways that are\noften ingenious, but necessarily insecure. Whereas in fact we do\nnot understand save where we can control, and cannot discover\nwhat is the nature of the phenomena labelled \"telepathic\" until\nwe can produce them with sulficient certainty to subject them to\ncontinuous experimentation.\nM. Maeterlinck also seems too ready to go ahead in this\nincautious manner, and one cannot but deprecate such statements\nas that \" it is by this time incontestable that a violent or deep\nemotion can be transmitted instantaneously from one mind to\nanother . . . and as the most violent emotion which man can\nundergo is that which grips and overwhelms him at the approach\nor at the very moment of death, it is nearly always this supreme\nemotion which he sends forth and directs with incredible pre-\ncision [!] through space, if necessarj' across seas and continents,\ntowards an invisible and moving goal\" (pp. 17-18). If so, our\npresent calamities should generate so abundant a crop of telepathic\nphantoms as to render Psychical Research a must powerful agency\nfor peace, by convincing even the most sceptical and materialistic\nnations that they cannot get rid of their enemies by killing them.\nBut unfortunately there seem to be no signs that Psychical Research\nwill not suffer as severely as the other spiritual interests of humanity\nfrom the Ragnaroh of European civihzation.\nSimilarly M. Maeterlinck seems quite willing to accept the\nexistence of \"mediums\" as an ultimate fact and point of de[>arture\nfoi' his theories (p. 43), and to assume that there is no difficulty\nabout finding capable and trustworthj' representatives of their\nclass {e.g. pp. 58, 78). Such has not by any means been the experi-\nence of our Society, and until \"mediums\" are as plentiful and\nprocui-able as blackberries, they and their mentality should surely\nbe regarded as a difficult psychological problem deserving of the\nmost careful examination.\nM. Maeterlinck proceeds to use the existence of telepathy and of\nmediums as premisses in his theorizings about the supra-personal\nand supernatural \"subconsciousness\" which he calls the \"unknown\nguest\" who occasionally crosses the threshold of our normal life,\nand whom he greatly prefers to the spiritistic interpretation of\nthe data. That his speculations are eloquent and interesting no\nreader will denj% though Maeterlinck himself would no doubt\nconfess the enormous difficulty of penetrating the enveloping mystery\nand obtaining anj^ definite conclusions from facts so shadowy and\nconceptions so inchoate as those he is forced to rely on. From\nthe standpoint of purely scientific Psychical Research, however, one\nfeels that it is still premature to theorize except in the most\n\f16 JouTVdl of;}?(k;ieiy for Pft,yjchJUcd Besearch. Jan., 1915.\ntentative manner, and that it is a pity that in his eagerness to\nadvance M. Maeterlinck should pass so lightly over what appear\nto be some highl}' important experiences of his own. In his essay\non \" Psychometry \" (p. 52 f.) he mentions a visit of his wife to\na \" M\u2014 \" to ask her, on the basis of a scrap of paper which\nwas in his handwriting but gave no other clue, what he was doing.\nThe psychometrist at once declared that he was far away in a\nforeign country, examining horses with an absorbed and tired air.\nHe was in fact on his visit to the Elberfeld horses, though not\nactually investigating them at the time of the sitting. Even more\nstriking is the story on pp. 56-7 of the same medium's description\nof the unknown writer of a letter asking M. Maeterlinck for his\nautograph. In this case we are merely assured that \"on enquiry,\nall the details were found to be astonishingly accurate\"; but surely\nthis astonishing accuracy excites the reader's curiosity and would be\nenormously convincing. If, then, the correspondence which established\nit has been preserved, as one must presume, it should be published\nin extenso. The Editor of this Journal would no doubt be delisrhted\nto do so.\nF. C. S.

The new\nAssistant is Mr. Edwin W. Friend, who graduated from Har\nvard University in 1908, and was, at the time of his appoint-\nment, acting as Assistant in the Department of Philosophy.\nHis services, it is hoped, will relieve Professor Hyslop of the\nofl&ce work of the Society and leave him free for scientific\ninvestigations.\nThe same issue of the Journal contains the gratifying state-\nment that the Endowment Fund has recently been increased\nby the contribution of ^3,000, and\u2014though not yet reaching\nthe amount desired\u2014is at least sufficient to ensure the exist-\nence of the Society. It is satisfactory that, in spite of the\ndifficulties and discouragements which beset a young organiza-\ntion, it has secured a permanent endowment and the means to\nprovide for the continuance of its scientific work in the future.\nThat this successful accomplishment is due to Professor Hyslop's\nenergy, perseverance, and untiring zeal in the cause of psychical\nresearch, no one will be disposed to deny.\n\fNo. CCCXVI \u2014Vol. XVII.

Feb., 1915.\nmembership at the end of this year. Dm-iug the year 23\nnew Members (including one Corresponding Member; were\nelected, and 2 Associates became Members ; 62 new Associates\nwere elected, and 1 Member became an Associate. On the other\nhand, the total loss in numbers, from resignations, deaths and\nother causes, was 29 Members (including one Corresponding\nMember) and 90 Associates, making a net decrease of 31.\nThe total membership is now 1212, the numbers being dis-\ntributed as follows : Members, 286 (including 27 Honorary and\nCorresponding Members) ;\nAssociates, 926 (including 11 Honorary\nAssociates).\nThese figures, with the corresponding ones of previous years,\nhave been analysed in order to discover how far the decrease\nmay reasonably be attributed to the war. During the five\nyears, 1909 to 1913 inclusive, the average number of autumn\nelections of Members and Associates was 53, whereas this year\nit was only 31. Further, the average number of resignations\nduring the previous five years for the period August to Decem-\nber was 30, whereas this year it was 41. The figures are even\nmore striking if we omit the year 1912, which happened to be\na comparatively unprosperous one for the Society. In that\ncase, the average number of autumn elections is found to be\n56, as against 31 this year ; while the average number of\nresignations is 26, as against 41 this year.\nThe number of elections this year before the war was 53,\nwhich is up to the average of the corresponding period for the\nlast three years, though below the average (69) for the last\nfive years, 1909 and 1910 having been unusually prosperous\nyears.\nFurther evidence of the effect of the war on our numbers\nis to be found in the letters of resignation received. As\nusual, a large proportion (38 out of 75) give no reason for\nresigning ; of the other 34, 8 state specifically that it is due\nto the war, while 10 others, who allude to reduced circum-\nstances or the urgency of other claims on them, probably mean\nthe same thing. If so, the war accounts for half the number of\nresignations out of those who mention any reason for their\nresigning. Other reasons given are such as ill-health (7 cases),\ninability to attend meetings, going abroad, etc. The majority\nexpress regret for having to resign, and 8 say that they hope\nto rejoin later ; in only 3 cases out of the total of 75 is\n\fFeb., 19] 5.

Thev are as follows :\nTfyQiipp _ _ _ - 19\nxvUssia - - - - 9\nXjCi^lUili _ _ - 1\nGermany i. i\nAustria-Hungary - 6\n^ Holland - - - - 12\nItaly and Sicily 8\nNorway - - - - 3\nDenmark 2\nSpain - - - - 2\nSweden - - - - 1\nSwitzerland - 1\nPortugal - - _ 1\nRcumania - - - 1\nTotal - 77\nPublications continue to be sent to most of our members\nin France and Russia, as well as in the neutral countries,\nand it is hoped that communication will be resumed with those\nin Germany and Austria as soon as the war is over. We\nhave had several requests from members at the front to send\nthe publications there, and a letter from a medical man with\nthe Fleet, who seems to have some leisure for reading and\nopportunities for observation, asking us to send him information\nabout the best books on psychical subjects and hypnotism.\nThe drop in membership of course involves some decrease\nin the income of the Society, and it is natural that the receipts\n1 One member expresses disapproval of the Society's present methods ;\nanother says \" I cannot follow the present recondite investigations of the\nSociety with mucli interest, as they are so very complicated, and tlie Council\nshow such a very strange timidity in publishing any authoritative conclusions\non any subject.\" The third writes that he has been disappointed in his hope\nof learning from the Society the art of investigating psychical phenomena,\nbut that he has not lost his interest in the subject and hopes to be able some\ntime to send contributions both of money and information.\n2 Including Mr. Cort van der Linden, who is at present Prime Minister\nof Holland.\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1915.\nfrom the sale of publications\u2014one of our minor sources of\nincome\u2014have also fallen off. During the second half of the\nyear the sale of publications through our London agent to\npersons not belonging to the Society brought in a net profit\nof \u00a313 lis. 6d., whereas the average for the second half of\nthe previous four years was \u00a337. On the other hand, the sale\nof publications for the first half of the year realised a profit of\n\u00a327 6s. 3d., as compared with an average for the first half\nof the preceding four years of \u00a325 10s. Again, the sales of\npublications to members since the war began up to the end\nof the year amounted to \u00a34 12s. 9d., whereas the average\nreceipts for the corresponding period during the five previous\nyears amounted to \u00a316 10s. 2d.\nThe Society, however, has considerable reserves in its Endow-\nment Fund and other investments, so that no anxiety is felt as\nto its financial position. Nevertheless, in view of the present\ndecrease in income, members may be reminded that subscrip-\ntions are due on January 1st in every year.\nIn regard to the more important question of work done\nby the Society, a certain amount of the time and energy\nordinarily spent on psychical research is naturally being diverted\ninto other channels. Thus, Mr. Feilding has accepted an\nappointment on the Naval Press Bureau ; Dr. M'Dougall has\ngone to the front in charge of a motor-ambulance, and\nMr. E. N. Bennett is taking command of a Red Cross con-\ntingent which is being sent out from England to Serbia.\nIn regard to the Special Hospital for officers suffering from\nnervous shock, the scheme for which was mentioned in the\nDecember Journal, and which has now been started at a large\nhouse in Kensington, it is interesting to note that five out\nof the twenty-two medical men who have offered their services\nfree to it are members of the Council, and three others belong\nto the Society, which has thus at the outset associated with it\nmore than one-third of the whole medical staff of the Hospital.\nTurning to the more normal activities of the Society, we may\nobserve that the extra room which was added to the office at\nthe beginning of the year has proved of use in many ways.\nThe Assistant Research Officer has been able to carry on her\nwork there without the constant interruptions that were inevi-\ntable in the Library, and the room has also been in frequent\nuse for interviews and for purposes of experiment. In most of\n\fFeb., 1915. Report of the Council for the Year lOl-t. 23\nthe experiments in telepathy that are carried on at the Kooms,\nit is arranged for the agent to be in one room and the per-\ncipient in another, and both rooms have, of course, to be kept\nquiet and free from disturbance for the time being. Though\ntelepathic phenomena seem to occur fairly often, it is well\nknown that they can only be experimentally demonstrated in\nrare cases, so that much of the time spent in such experiments\nis inevitably fruitless, producing merely negative results. Among\na number of sets of experiments, however, tried during the last\ntwo years, a considerable proportion of successful results were\nobtained with two experimenters, the Misses Tipping, and a\nreport on these by Miss Verrall was read at a meeting of the\nSociety in November and will appear later in the Proceedings.\nAnother advantage of the extra room has been the greater\naccommodation thereby afforded in the Library for people who\nwish to read or consult books and periodicals there, and the\nLibrary has in consequence been used a good deal more this\nyear, though readers have fallen off again since the outbreak\nof war.\nA useful piece of work, which has been on hand for some\ntime. Vol. IL of the Combined Index to the Proceedings and\nJournal, has been completed and published this year. The\nfirst volume of this Index, covering the first 15 volumes of\nProceedings and the first 9 volumes of the Journal, was pub-\nlished ten years ago. The second volume continues the series\ndown to Vol. XXVI. of Proceedings and to Vol. XV. of the\nJournal inclusive, and in view of the increasing complexity of\nthe reports on the work of the Society, is likely to prove even\nmore useful than the first. The Index was prepared by Miss C.\nBurke and carefully revised by the Sub-Editor.\nStudy of the automatic scripts, which continue to be pro-\nduced, has gone on steadily throughout the year, and three\nreports on them have appeared in the Proceedings published\ndm-ing 1914. Mrs. Sidgwdck has also been for some time\nengaged in an examination of all the available records, both\npubhshed and unpublished, of Mrs. Piper's trance phenomena,\nfrom the point of view of finding what light is thrown bv\nthem on the psychology of her trance. A paper giving a\ngeneral account of this investigation was read at a meeting of\nthe Society in January, and Mrs. Sidgwick's full report is now\nbeing printed for the Proceedings.\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1915.\nDuring the year we had the pleasure of a visit from Dr.\nMorton Prince, who read a paper to a meeting of the Society.\nA number of reviews of psychological and other work done\nabroad have been contributed to the Proceedings and Journal\nby Dr. Schiller and Dr. Woolley. Several of these related to\nreports on the \" thinking animals \" whose performances have\nexcited so much interest in recent years, and with whom\nDr. Woolley and Mr. Bullough experimented last year at\nElberfeld. But this is another of the possible lines of investi-\ngation which are blocked for the present ; it has indeed been\nrumoured that the \" thinking horses \" have gone to the front.\nDuring the summer a series of ex].)eriments was conducted\nwith the Polish medium, Miss Stanislawa Tomczyk, in whose\npresence telekinetic phenomena are said to occur. Her\nperformances had not only been favourably reported on by\nDr. Ochorowicz, of Warsaw, and some other scientific men on\nthe Continent, but had also much impressed Mr. Feilding,\nwho had had opportunities of observing them at Warsaw and\nat Munich. The Council invited Miss Tomczyk to come to\nLondon, and appointed a Committee of investigation, con-\nsisting of Mr. Feilding, Mr. Baggally, Mrs. Sidgwick, Miss\nVerrall, Dr. Woolley, and two friends of Mr. Feilding's, Mr. S.\nCowper-Coles (an electrical metallurgist with expert knowledge\nof photography) and Mr. Mark Barr (an electrical expert), to\ntake charge of the sittings.\nEleven sittings in all were held between June 2 and July 13,\n1914, but unfortunately only inconclusive results were obtained.\nDuring part of the period the medium's health was not good,\nwhich probably accounted for the fact that several sittings\nwere almost entirely blank. At the others slight phenomena\nwere observed of the type usually associated with Miss Tomczyk,\nthat is, movements of small objects without any apparent\ncontact. The most striking incident was one witnessed at the\nfourth sitting, on June 11th, 1914, when a small celluloid ball\nwas levitated to a height of about 9 inches above the table\n(the medium's hands being about a quarter of an inch from the\nball on either side), coming down again almost at once.\nThe conditions of \" control \" were those habitually used at\nMiss Tomczyk's sittings, as described below in Mr. Feilding's\nNote (see p. 28) ;\nbut, owing to the slight nature of the\nphenomena and their desire not to discourage the medium at\n\fFeb., 1915. Report of the Council for the Year 1914. 25\nthe outset, the Committee were not able to impose such\nconditions as they would have thought completely satisfactory.\nIt may, however, be said that no evidence of fraud was.\nobtained and the Committee consider that there is undoubtedly\nstill a case for investigation.\nAt the end of the year. Miss Verrall was invited to give\na course of lectures once a week on psychical research during\nthe Lent Term, 1915, to the third-year students in psychology\nat King's College, University of London, where she has for\nsome time been assisting in the Demonstrations in Psychology.\nDr. William Brown, the head of the psychological department at\nKing's College, London, has obtained a commission in the R.A.M.C.,\nand Miss VerralFs course has been arranged to take the place of\nsome of the lectures that he would have given . In it she will\nattempt to give a general view of the various lines of enquiry pur-\nsued in psychical research and of the results so far obtained,\nconsidering them especially from a psychological standpoint.\nThis is believed to be the first time that any such course\nhas been delivered in an English University.\nMention may incidentally be made of the new London Medico-\nPsychological Clinic, which was opened in October, and an\naccount of which appeared in the December Journal. This\nhas, of course, no connexion with the Society, but so much\nhas been done through the work of the S.P.R. both to advance\nknowledge and to arouse interest in hypnotic and allied states\nfrom a psychological as well as a therapeutic point of view,\nthat new developments of this kind under the direction of\nproperly qualified persons are always especially welcomed by\nthe Council. Six members of the medical staff of the Clinic\nbelong to the S.P.R., and the Chairman of the Board of\nManagement is a member of our Council. We have already\nfound occasion to send to the Clinic several persons who have\ncome to the S.P.R.

Everard Feilding.\nEleven sittings in all were held between June 2 and July 13^\n1914. Although I do not propose to submit here a detailed\nreport of the proceedings, which may perhaps be dealt with\nlater in complete form, it may be of interest to give some\ndescription of them. An interesting feature concerning this\nmedium is that neither by herself nor by Dr. Ochorowicz, who\nhas closely studied her for several years, are the phenomena\nwhich are stated to occur in her presence attributed to spirit\naction. They consist of two classes, viz. : first, phenomena of\nthe so-called \" poltergeist \" type, many of which I have seen.\nThese occur spontaneously and generally unexpectedly in her\nnormal state, and include raps, movements of tables and chairs\nwithout apparent contact, throwings or transportations of\nobjects about the house in which she is living, frequently in\nher own proximity, but also often in places apparently beyond\nher normal reach, such as outside the room in which she is, or\neven in another room the door of which is shut. Secondly,\nphenomena produced experimentally and deliberately when the\nmedium is in a quasi-somnambulistic condition, or, more exactly\nspeaking, in a secondary state bearing all the characteristics of\na complete dual personality, somewhat similar to that of\n\" Sally \" in the case of Miss Beauchamp reported by Dr.\nMorton Prince and well known to most members of the Society.\nIt is only by long-continued observation that any conclusions\ncan be reached regarding the first class of phenomena, but the\nsecond class (which, so far as I know, are peculiar to this\nmedium) appeared, from reports received, capable of satisfactory\ninvestigation, and it was to these that the Committee confined\nits attention. The procedure is as follows. The secondary\npersonality having been first induced by hypnosis, the medium,\n* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.\n\fFeb., 1915. Note on the English Sittings with Miss Tomczylc. 29\nwho usually wears a blouse with short sleeves, submits herself\nto examination in full light ; that is, her arms and hands and\ndress, as well as the table, which is bare, are carefully scruti-\nnised for the purpose of ascertainincr that no hair or thin wire,\nby which means alone it would seem that the effects which\nfollow could be produced fraudulently, are present or accessible.\nAfter the examination she remains with her hands well extended\non the table in front of her without, so far as the closest\nobservation of the Committee could determine, ever finding an\nopportunity of picking up any such aid. It is, indeed, mainly\nto prevent such an opportunity that the observation is sub-\nsequently directed. Since, however, it is necessary to reduce\nthe light to a degree of brilliancy sufficient, indeed, to see the\nposition of the hands \\Tiith complete clearness, but insufficient to\nmake certain of seeing a hair between the medium's hands if\nthere were one, it is a matter of individual opinion, on which\nthe members of the Committee were not united, as to whether\nsuch observation, extended over a sitting lasting perhaps two\nhours or more, can ever be adequate to justify a positive\nstatement that no such opportunity presented itself.\nShe remains with her hands on the table, and generally\njoined, for a time varying from about five minutes to a half\nor three-quarters of an hour, until she reports feeling the\n\" current,\" which she says shows itself by a prickling sensation\nin the tips of her fingers. She then asks for some small object\nto be placed on the table between her hands. It is im-\nmaterial what object is chosen provided it is not too heavy,\nbut the objects usually chosen are celluloid balls of different\nsizes, from that of a marble to that of a billiard ball, a\ncigarette, matchbox, small aluminium box, spoon, etc. She\nplaces her hands on each side of the object, with her fingers,\nsometimes open and sometimes joined, pointing inwards towards\nit at a distance of from \\ inch to 3 or 4 inches on each side.\nPresently the object is seen to move about on the table ; if a\nball, running to and fro ; if a long object such as a cigarette,\nchanging its angle of inclination or lifting at one end ; if a\nbox, sliding short distances and occasionally turning over.\nShould the \" force,\" whatever it may be, be manifesting satis-\nfactorily, the experiment terminates by the medium lifting her\nhands from the table, when the object also is lifted to a\nheight varying from 6 inches to about \\\\ feet.\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1915.\nThis is the only type of experiment which I have myself\nwitnessed, but it by no means covers the range of phenomena\nreported by Dr. Ochorowicz and others, who have had longer\nopportunities of studying the case. These include the produc-\ntion of lights, effects produced without contact on photographic\nplates in the dark or in red light, or on a galvanometer,\nsudden precipitation of chemical substances held in solution,\nand vision through an opaque screen. It would appear that\nthe power alternates from one class of phenomena to another,\neach class occurring during a period when the others are not\nexhibited.\nI had already visited the medium twice in Warsaw, and had\nalso attended a few experiments conducted with her in January\nand February, 1914, by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing. The suc-\ncessful production of her phenomena seems to depend upon\nthe general condition of the medium, who is subject to positive\nand negative periods. My first visit to Warsaw in 1912 was\nduring an almost entirely negative period, and though slight\nindications of some apparently supernormal force were per-\nceptible, its action was irregular and very small. Having been\ninformed later that a positive period had again set in, I returned\nto Warsaw at Christmas, 1913, and at the series of experiments\nwhich then took place, as well as at a subsequent series a\nfew weeks afterwards in Munich, the effects were produced\nwith great regularity, the conditions being precisely the same\nas those which prevailed in London.\nAt the series held in London the phenomena proved, unfor-\ntunately, far less striking, though far better than those which\nI saw at my first visit to Warsaw. Not only were the move-\nments as a rule small, but they were also of rare occurrence,\nseldom more than three or four in a sitting which might last\ntwo hours. There was only one complete lifting of any object,\nviz. of a celluloid ball, at the fourth sitting, and the last two\nor three sittings were entirely blank. Any definite experimental\nobservation of the \" force,\" such as by varying the conditions,\ninterposing fresh obstacles to possible fraud, and so forth, was\nin the circumstances impossible, and the most that can be said\nis that the Committee as a whole were unable either to con-\nvince themselves that their precautions against fraud were\nadequate, or, on the other hand, to point to any indications that\nfraud had been employed.\n\fFeb., 1915. Note on the English Sittings ivith Miss Tomczyk. 31\nOn the assumption that the medium is possessed of some\nsupernormal force, the comparative lack of success in London\ncan be accounted for by the supposition that she was entering\nupon another (the third or fourth in her history) negative\nperiod, and that the \" force \" was already waning when the\nexperiments started and ultimately entirely disappeared. Since\nthe termination of the official sittings, I have made a large\nnumber of experiments privately, but at two only, at intervals\nof many months, has any success been obtained.\nOn the other hand, there have been a great quantity of\nphenomena of the \" poltergeist \" type, occurring in cycles of\nactivity and quiescence, succeeding one another. As phenomena\nof this kind are most difficult to control, it is impossible to\nadduce evidence which would satisfy any one who was not a\nconstant witness of them, and at present, at all events, I shall\nnot refer to these further than to suggest that should further\nexperimentation in the other kind of manifestations show a\nbetter measure of success in conditions which absolutely pre-\nclude any explanation except that of a supernormal faculty,\nthe a priori improbability of a supernormal agency in the\n\" poltergeist \" class also would be greatly reduced.\nAs already stated, a spiritistic origin of both classes is\ndisbelieved in by the medium, who, no doubt influenced by\nthe views of Dr. Ochorowicz, is disposed to attribute them to\nan emanation of some unknown kind of energy from her\nnervous system. It may be of interest to add, in support\nof her contention, that the production of a \" phenomenon,\"\neither in her normal or secondary condition, is almost invariably\nfollowed within a few minutes by a kind of collapse suggesting\na sudden depletion of nervous energy and in which she falls\ninstantaneously insensible, sometimes with rather disastrous\nconsequences, such as tumbling backwards down half a flight\nof stairs, or striking her head violently against the furniture.\nIt is rash to speculate on insufficient data, but should Miss\nTomczyk's claims ever come to be regarded as satisfactorily\nproved, viz. that, as I believe, she has a supernormal force and\nthat this force is in the nature of a discharge of energy from\nher own organism, it may be that we have here a basis for the\nexplanation of a great part, if not the whole, of the so-called\nphysical phenomena of spiritualism.\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1915.\nTO MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES OF THE SOCIETY\nFOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nThe Society for Psychical Researcii is anxious to try experi-\nments of various kinds, hypnotic and other, with a view to\nobtaining further evidence either of telepathy or of hyperaesthesia.\nIn the case of hypnotic experiments, the hypnotist would be one\nof our own medical members, experienced in work of this kind.\nIn order to carry out this purpose effectively, it is necessary\nthat a considerable number of persons should be available who\nare willing to act as \" subjects.\" It would be an advantage\nto have subjects who have already shown signs of some automatic\n\u2022or telepathic faculty, or who are responsive to hypnotic suggestion,\nbut these are not essential qualifications, since it is always possible\nthat in the course of experiments, some hitherto undiscovered\nfaculty will be brought to light.\nSome experiments would almost necessarily, and many might\npreferably, be conducted at the Rooms of the Society, but\nsome might equally well be carried out by people in their own\nhomes, provided that they kept careful records and observed\ntest-conditions. In all experimental work quantity, as well as\nquality, is important, and we hope, therefore, that not only\nwill a considerable number of subjects present themselves^ but\nthat they will be willing to continue the experiments regularly,\nsay, once a week, for at least two or three months, should it\nappear that interesting results are likely to be obtained.\nIf any of our members and associates are willing to take\npart in these experiments, we should be much obliged if they\nwould write to the Secretary, stating what kind of experiments\nthey would prefer, and especially whether they are willing to\nbe hypnotised. We appeal first to members of the S.P.R.,\nbecause we know that they take an interest in its work, but\nwe should, of course, welcome good subjects, whether members\nor not.\nIt is impossible in this preliminary notice to describe in\ndetail the kind of experiments which it is proposed to try,\nbut as instances of earlier experiments which it would be\ninteresting to repeat, we refer our readers to Proceedings,\nS.P.R., Vols.

Mar., 1915.\nINVESTIGATION OF A HAUNTED HOUSE IN\nWORCESTERSHIRE.\nBy Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nLast July I received a letter from Mrs. Roberts (pseudonym)\ngiving me details of mysterious disturbances that had occurred\nfor some time past in their house in Worcestershire. The\nhouse occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Robertas is quite in the country,\nabout two miles from a railway station : it stands back from\nthe road and has a large and beautiful garden around and\nbehind it. The house is a very old one of two stories, with\nthick walls, and considerable alterations and additions had\nbeen made by Mr. Roberts.\nMrs. Roberts's first letter is as follows :\nJuly 1, 1914.\nThe facts are these :\nWe came to this house nearly three years ago, and although\nit had the reputation of being haunted, we thought it was due\nto the fact that there is a novel about a haunted house called\n[name of house], and having no reference whatever to this house ;\nand we thought nothing of it.\nA few months ago, however, odd things began to happen.\nOne evening one of the maids went to do my room after I\nhad gone down to dinner, and was startled by hearing groans\ncoming from under my bed. She thought it was the dog, and\nwas walking towards the bed when she saw a figure emerge, and\ndistinctly heard its footsteps go round the room, out of the door,\nand along the passage. She was too much frightened to pursue\nit. The only people in the house at the time were my husband\nand myself in the dining-room, my small children asleep in\nbed, and the old cook iir the kitchen, who I think would have\nbeen incapable of the agility that would have been necessary\nif it had been any human being playing a trick. A few weeks\nlater a temporary maid (who heard nothing of this incident while\nshe was here) swore to hearing footsteps come into her room,\nwalk to the dressing-table, then come to the bed, and she thought\nher bed was pushed against the one of the maid sleeping next\nher. A light revealed nothing. The next night she again heard\nfootsteps walking up and down outside her room.\n\fMae., 1915. A Haunted House in Worcestershire. 35\nAbout six weeks later my nurse was awoke one niglit by a\ntremendous noise in tlie room below lier, which is the day nursery.\nThere were sounds as if the window was being pushed up and\ndown and the furniture of the room being thrown about. She\nthought some one must have got into the house and she was\ncoming to call my husband, when the noises stopped. The next\nnight she heard loud groaning in the room overhead, the cook's\nroom, and thought she must be feeling ill, but next day the cook\nsaid she had slept all through the night, and heard nothing\nherself\u2014though she constantly complains of noises, footsteps, and\noccasionally says she feels her bedclothes being pulled.\nJust lately things have got worse. My nurse (who is perfectly\ncool-headed, and was most sceptical about the other incidents)\nwoke suddenly one night, then heard footsteps come into the room\nand walk in a great hurry between her bed and my elder little\nboy's, felt something brush past her head, then heard the foot-\nsteps hurry to the dressing-table, then back, and cease at the door.\nDuring this time, and while the noise was still in the room, she\nmanaged to strike a light, but there was nothing to be seen.\nShe was very much afraid, and described a feeling of there being\nsomething there which one could not get by. A few nights\nlater the same thing occurred, but that time she had the feeling\nof a hand being put on her throat, and of receiving a push.\nThat night she had a night-light burning, but saw nothing. She\nalso describes a noise like an iron bedstead being lacked, and\nshe heard this noise outside her door a few nights ago, when\nnothing else happened. Since then she has heard groaning in\nher room ; and on the same night, the cook heard noises and the\nmaid who saw the first apparition\u2014and since then has experienced\nnothing\u2014was woke by the feeling of some one pushing her on the\nshoulder. She thought it was the maid who shares her room\ntrying to wake her, but found that the maid was asleep and\nthere was no one else there.\nMy husband has since had much the same experience, accompanied\nby a feeling of great stupor. He attributes it to indigestion !\nIf things go on at this rate all our servants will be leaving,\nand it is altogether very unpleasant.\nCan you, with your large experience, suggest any explanation\nor cure ?\nI much hope you will forgive me for troubling you with this\nlong letter. Even now there are details which I have left out.\nA 2\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1915.\nWriting to me again a week later, Mrs. Roberts says :\nJuly 6, 1914.\nI very mucli wisli you could come over and investigate these\nmysterious phenomena, but I hardly like to press you to come\nso far on the small chance of anything occurring when you are\nhere. The phenomena appear to centre round our cook ! She\nis certainly not young, but although one or two mysterious\nnoises had been heard before she came, nothing really developed\ntill she had been here some weeks. She admits to having lived\nin places before where similar things have happened, and my\nhope is that when she leaves in a month's time the poltergeists\nwill leave with her !\nI have just been told by my nurse that she heard noises again\nlast night\u2014a loud yell being followed by bumping noises which\nwent on over a period of 1^ hours. Unfortunately she was too\nmuch alarmed to come and call my husband and me.\nIf you think of coming, I think a week-end would be the best,\nas Sunday is rather a favourite night.\nThere are one or two elements in our case which do not seem\nquite to fit in with orthodox poltergeist behaviour, but as they\nare things more difiicult to vouch for than the noises, I have\nnot felt able to lay stress on them ; but if you come, we can\ndiscuss all this. I must, however, warn you once more of the\nextremely erratic behaviour of the phenomena\u2014sometimes dis-\nappearing for weeks. Lately, however, not more than a week\nhas passed without something happening.\nI arranged accordingly to go over and spend a week-end with\nMr. and Mrs. Roberts, to whom I am greatly indebted for\ntheir kind hospitality and also giving me every assistance in\nthe investigations I made. During the time I was there I\ntook down the testimony of the different inmates of the house\nwho had personally experienced these abnormal disturbances.\nThe evidence in each case was given to me independently and\nalone, and my cross-examination of the witnesses was cheerfully\nsubmitted to, and did not shake the evidence.\nDorothy L., under-nurse and housemaid, said\n:\nI was in Mrs. Roberts's bedroom one Sunday evening last March\nabout 8 p.m.. when I heard a groaning under the bed ; it sounded\nvery like a dog moaning, and occurred twice over. There was a\nbedroom lamp alight in the rooni but I saw nothing to account\n\fMar., 1915. A Haunted House in Worcestershire. 37\nfor the sound. Suddenly, as I was standing by the dressing-table,\nI felt a hand placed on my chest and I was pushed over by the\npressure, back to the dressing-table. A moment later I saw a\nfigure, as if coming from under the bed, moving across the room\ntowards the door : I only saw the back of the figure, which was\ntall, and white clothed. The figure went through the door out\nof the room and I distinctly heard its footsteps on the landing\noutside. I was so petrified that I was unable to stir for a minute\nor two, and I was afraid of screaming, as it would have frightened\nthe children who were in bed in the adjoining room. As soon\nas I recovered I rushed downstairs and told the cook what had\nhappened, and later on T told the head nurse, who informed\nMrs. Roberts.\nAt the time Dorothy saw the figure, Mr. and Mrs. Roberts\nwere at dinner in the dining-room, which was downstairs, but\nnot under this bedroom. The cook was at the moment engaged\nin dishing-up the dinner. The head-nurse and parlour-maid\nhad gone to church, and that Sunday evening there was no\none else staying in the house. I enquired if there was a\ndog on the premises, and found a dog was kept in the yard\noutside, but not allowed in the house. On this occasion the\ndog was not in the premises at all, for the head-nurse, as\nwas her custom, had taken the dog to accompany her to\nchurch, where it waited outside till the service was over and\naccompanied the nurse home. No other dog was kept, and\nno stray dog was in the place.\nOn another occasion, about three weeks previous to my visit,\nDorothy said :\nI was in bed and it was just getting daylight, when I woke\nup with the sound of some one coming into the bedroom ; some-\nthing crossed the room and came to my bedside and pushed me.\nI did not see any figure, there was hardly light enough, but I\ndistinctly felt a push on my shoulder, and then it went away. I\nlay awake till it was time to get up but nothing more occurred.\nI am sure it was not a dream ; the parlour-maid was asleep in\nher bed, adjoining mine, all the time. This is the last time the\n\" ghost \" visited me.\nI next examined the cook, an elderly person named Mrs. E.,\nwho said :\nDorothy on the Sunday came downstairs and told me of the\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, siar., 191\nfright she had and the apparition she saw in Mrs. Roberts's bed-\nroom, but I could not believe her. However, a little while after-\nwards I heard a groaning in my bedroom and the noise of some\none going out of the room, but I saw nothing. I was in bed\nwhen the groaning woke me up ; the room was quite dark and\nI was too frightened to stir or light the candle. Another night\nI heard a stamping sound as if some one was walking heavily\nacross the room. This time I did get up and light the candle\nand went outside on the landing : the time was 2 a.m. On at\nleast half a dozen other occasions I heard similar sounds after\nmidnight, but saw nothing. For the last week or two I have\nheard nothing. When I lived with a family in the I. of Wight,\nI also heard on several occasions curious noises which could\nnot be explained. The sounds were like some one smashing\ncrockery or moving furniture, and sometimes footsteps. These\nsounds were also heard by my mistress and others and they were\nmuch frightened and said it was dreadful. The family with whom\nI lived in the I. of Wight have, I believe, now gone to New\nZealand.\nThe cook left the Isle of Wight to come to Mrs. Roberts\n;\nher bedroom is upstairs over the night-nursery, and she sleeps\nalone. She told me she was perfectly sure no one was playing\na trick on her : and said she was certain some object was\nstanding by her bedside and uttering these groans, which woke\nher up on the first occasion.\nI next examined Ethel C, the nurse, a most intelligent and\nrespectable person about thirty years old. Ethel C. said :\nDorothy told me of the fright she had and the figure she had\nseen on the Sunday evening on my return from church that\nnight. The date was March 22nd, as I put it down in my diary\nimmediately afterwards. At first I could not believe it, though\nDorothy declared it was perfectly true. The dog had gone with\nme to church that evening, as it always does, for the church is\n2>\\ miles walk through country roads, and the dog goes as my\ncompanion and waits outside the church till I come out, and\nit did so on this occasion. Some time after this when I was in\nbed in my room\u2014the night nursery, which is over the day\nnursery\u2014J. heard the window of the room below suddenly thrown\nopen and then shut down again and the furniture Icnocked about\nin the room below. I got up and lit my candle and found it\n\fMar., 1915. A Haunted House in Worcestershire. 39\nwas 1.30 a.m. I was too frightened to go downstairs by myself\nand was going to call Mr. Roberts when the sound ceased, after\ngoing on for nearly fifteen minutes. I then laid down again and\nwaited but nothing more occurred that night. The only other\npersons in my bedroom were the two children, who were fast\nasleep. When I got up in the morning early I went to the room\nbelow and examined the room. Nothing was disturbed, the windows\nwere fastened and the door locked as usual.\nOn a subsequent occasion, June 15th last, the children being\nasleep in their cots, and I myself had been asleep when I was\nawoke by hearing heavy footsteps, as if made by a person with\nhobnailed boots, coming into the room. The footsteps tramped\nacross the room towards the dressing-table. I was terrified but\nmanaged to light the candle by my bedside and found it was\n1.20 a.m. The perspiration was running off my forehead with\nfear and I kept the candle alight, but no more sleep was possible\nthat night. I was really too frightened to get out of bed to call\nMr. Roberts and nothing further occurred that night. I am sure\nthe sound of the tramping did not come from some one walking in\nthe garden outside, for I felt the bed shaking with the heavy tread.\nA week later when in bed in the same room, I heard groans\ncoming from some one standing near my bed, and then felt an\nobject brush past my head. I lit the candle, found it was 1.30\na.m. ; the children were fast asleep in their beds and there was\nnothing to explain the sounds. The same night I heard a noise\noutside my door as if some one was striking a metallic rod. I\nlaid awake but nothing else occurred.\nA few days later, a horrible experience happened to me. I\nhad been in bed some time but was not asleep, when a hand\nsuddenly gripped my throat and another hand gripped the side\nof my body. The grip on the throat was so violent that it hurt\nbut did not choke me. I managed to light the candle after a\nfew minutes and found it was 1.30 a.m. The children were fast\nasleep and no one else was in the room. I am sure it was not\na nightmare. After that I always kept a light burning in my\nroom all night, and nothing like this experience happened again,\nthough I have heard unaccountable noises several times.\nMr. Roberts had fitted up an electric bell communicating\nwith his room from the nurse's bedside, and the Sunday night\nbefore I arrived, July 12th, the nurse rang the bell. Mr..\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1915.\nRoberts threw on a dressine-gown and ran to the room at\nonce. The nurse had heard heavy footsteps moving about\nthe landing outside the door. Mr. Roberts searched the whole\nhouse but found nothing to account for them : he then sat\noutside the room for some time but nothing else occurred that\nnight. On one occasion the nurse told me she was going\ndownstairs in the evening when some object was felt near her,\nas if trying to stop her passing. She went back to her bed-\nroom, lit a candle, but could find nothing to account for it.\nShe assured me the noises could not be explained by any\nhoax or natural cause, nor was her experience the result of\nanything Dorothy had told her, for she had dismissed that\nnarration as absurd. She is not of a nervous disposition, as\nis shown by her having had sole charge of the house and slept\nalone in it for three weeks before the disturbances began.\nMrs. Roberts has neither heard nor seen anything super-\nnormal. Mr. Roberts on one occasion (I was informed) dis-\ntinctly felt a presence as of some person brushing past him,\nbut could find nothing to account for it.\nI examined every room in the house. The night nursery\nwas carpeted with thick felt and hardly any sound was made\nwhen I walked across it. The nurse imitated the sound she\nheard by stamping across the room from the door past her\nbed to the dressing-table, and I noticed that the room shook\nas she trod heavily. The house is old and the floors upstairs\nshake when they are tramped across.\nThe room I slept in was opposite the night nursery on the\nfirst floor, the doors facing each other across the wide landing.\nAn electric bell was temporarily fitted up by my bedside, and\nthe bell push by the nurse's bed in the room opposite ; the\ndoors were also left open during the night, and I remained\nawake till 2.30 a.m. Nothing, however, occurred during the\nwhole time of my stay.\nAfter I had left I received the following letter from Mrs.\nRoberts :\nAugust 6, 1914.\nThe night you left, July 20th, Ethel, in the nursery, and the\ntwo maids who slept together upstairs, heard awful groaning\nlasting 15-20 minutes, which seemed to go round the house\u2014they all\nconfirm that.\n\fMar., 1915.

Report of Mr. Grunhaum's Experiences. 43\nA FUKTHEE EEPORT OF MR. GRUNBAUM'S\nEXPERIENCES.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nIn the last Part of the Proceedings two papers, by Dr. Woolley\nand myself, were published on a series of hallucinatory im-\npressions experienced by one of our foreign members, there\ncalled \"Mr. Griinbaum.\" Many of these were the result\nof suggestions deliberately made by Mr. Griinbaum to himself\nin a state of self-induced hypnosis, or some condition of\na similar kind ; and though the hallucinations often diverged\nconsiderably from his conscious intentions, he was generally\nable to trace their variations to something that had recently\nattracted his attention or had been in his mind. The account\nshowed clearly two points : (1) That Mr. Griinbaum is un-\nusually liable to hallucinations ;\nthat is, that ideas which\nwith most of us remain merely ideas are in his case liable\nto become externalised almost as vividly as if they had been\nproduced by sensations derived immediately from external\nobjects ; (2) that these hallucinations are undoubtedly sub-\njective ; that is, that their source can be traced to his own\nmind, as Mr. Griinbaum himself has always recognised, and\nas Dr. Woolley makes clear in his analysis of them.\nQuite recently, however, one of these hallucinations has\ncoincided with the death by accident of a relative of Mr.\nGriinbaum's in such a way as to suggest that this particular\ncase was, at least partially, telepathic in character, and the\nsuggestion is borne out by the fact that on the same night\nMr. Griinbaum's mother had a dream relating to the same\nperson. The hallucination was of the same type as many of\nthe previous ones, and showed many of their idiosyncrasies, so\nthat the coincidence between it and the death may, no doubt,\nhave been purely accidental. The case is further weakened\nby the fact that Mr. Griinbaum did not mention it to any\none till after he had heard of the death. This is, however,\nso far as I can remember, the first time that he has reported\nto us any such coincidence with any of his experiences\n;\nit seems therefore very improbable that it is a case of illusion\nof memory. Having known Mr. Griinbaum personally for\nsome years, I have every confidence that his statements\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1915.\ncan be depended on, and his reports are always characterised\nby great care and precision.\nIt appears to me not improbable that a genuine telepathic\nimpression should take a form which the percipient's own\nmental habits had made customary for him,\u2014in other words,\nas I suggested above, that this case may be telepathic, but\nonly partially telepathic. But even if nothing more than\na chance coincidence, it seems to me of interest.\n1 was first informed of it in a letter from Mr. Grriinbaum\nas follows :\nJanuary 17, 1915.\nTwo curious cases happened recently to me.\nI.\nAt about the beginning of this month I came home one day\nvery tired and sat down in a chair in the back room. As I\nfeel that I can hardly keep my eyes open, I say to myself\n:\n\" Get out of your body.\" Shortly afterwards my mother came\nin from the hall and woke me up by saying :\n\" Come now,\nwhat's the use of this ? Have you been walking up and down\nin the corridor all the while ? I heard somebody walking up\nand down, and coming out of the front room in the hall. I\nfound nobody there.\" The hall has a stone floor. I told her\nthat I had not done so.\nII.\nIn the night of Tuesday, January 12th, shortly after I had\ngone to bed, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I feel all at once a \" brain-\nsqueeze \" ^ accompanied by :\n(1) a pain of horrid anxiety in my heart ;\n(2) a vision of a black-rooted skull ^ with two big eye-holes.\nThis skull is enveloped in a very fine gauze of black\nyarn.^\nThe thing startles me, and I call myself directly to order. Directly\nafterwards I feel a slight trembling all through my body, accom-\npanied by the low rwmbling sound. [Mr. Griinbaum had mentioned\n^ Cf. the account of Mr Griinbaum's previous experiences, Proceedings,\nPart LXIX., p. 403. The sensation is there described as a \"club-blow.\"\n\u2014A. J.\n2 I am utterly indifferent in regard to skulls.\n^ Cf. op. cit. pp. 396-398, for other instances of visions seen through a\nhallucinatory thin black veil or gauze.\u2014A. J.\n\fMar., 1915. Report of Mr. Grunbaum's Experiences. 45\nto me in a previous letter that a low rumbling sound sometimes\naccompanied liis hallucinations.\u2014A. J.] Then the indescribable\ndivine sensation comes on (as in my first phonograph experiment i)\nand I find myself in a globe of opalescent light.\nTherein I see the folloAving vision :\nIn front of me, and slightly to the left, there stands a long\ncurved blackish stick or rattan. On this long stick there stands\na skull ; it swings from right to left. The skull is phosphorescent.\nAt the same time the head of my cousin M., who lives in\nthe city W., is leaning towards me.\nThen the head of my cousin begins to fade away and the\nswinging skull takes the features of my cousin. There is no\nflesh on the skull, but the phosphorescent skull takes the features\nof my cousin in such a way that it shows a marvellous likeness\nto him. It swings then to left and right, looks in a very friendly\nway at me and moves away, still swinging, from the curved\nstick, going very very slowly upwards. That is the end.\nIn the morning at breakfast we received a note from my\ncousin, who lives here around the corner of the street, that\nshe had just received a telegram that her brother (my cousin\nM.) had died.\nGoing to the funeral, I found that my cousin M. had been\nrun over by an express train at the railway station at W., where\nhe lives. He was killed on the spot, being so terribly injured\nthat it was only on account of the papers he had in his pocket\nthat he could be recognised. He had been taking leave of an\nacquaintance and had brought him to the train. In order to\ncome home quickly to his wife, he walked round the train in\nwhich his friend was, and was caught by the express that was\ncoming on behind his friend's train without his knowledge, and\nthis caused his sudden death.\nWhen I consider this case from a psychological point of view,\nI find myself facing a puzzle. First of all : the time is wrong.\nThe accident happened between 7 and 8 o'clock on Tuesday\nnight, and I saw the vision on the same night between 11 and\n12 before going to sleep. How can this be explained ? And\nthen, I cannot suppose that my cousin was consciously thinking\nof me at that terrible moment, as the time must have been\ntoo short and he was on the way home to his wife, who was\nwaiting for him. I had not met with him for some thirty years.\n1 Op. cit. p. 401.\u2014A. J.\n\f4() Journal of Society for Psychical Research, biae., 1915.\nThen it is a curious thing that I saw nothing at all connected\nwith the idea of a train in my vision, because, if the poor\nfellow had had any particular idea in his head at that terrible\nmoment, it must have been the idea of a locomotive and of his\nwife.\nThen there is still something else. There are at present a\ncouple of thousand people dying daily on the battlefields. I\nhave never seen anything at all about the war.\nWhy did this particular thing just reach me ? Might it perhaps\nhave been on account of his being a family relation ? But\nwhy did only I see it ? And why only 4 hours later ?\nThere remains the curious point of the two different skulls\n:\nthe black-smoky-black-rooted one and the bright phosphorescent\none. In the course of my own experiments I found many times\nthat a self-induced happy vision was preceded by a black-\nsmoky horrid one. But here it is exactly the reverse, in so far\nthat I regard the black-rooted horrid skull as the telepathic\nimpression [if it can be considered such). This was then followed\nby the bright phosphorescent one.\nBut why the \" brain-squeeze \" ? Nobody (and certainly not\nI) had been thinking about the possibility of such an accident\n;\nand, in fact, I had altogether forgotten about my cousin, as he\nlives in another city. His marriage was a most happy one.\nIf this \" brain-squeeze \" had come at the moment that he\nwas run over, then one might be compelled to suppose that he\nhad been thinldng of me at that special moment, but I think\nthat is very unlikely.\nI am really sorry that I did not speak about it to anybody\nbefore the telegram was shown to us. Then I remarked to\nmy cousin that it would not surprise me \"if he had died in the\nbeginning of the night.\" This is in fact all I said to her.\nBut you see, when once long ago I saw the vision of my nephew\nS., he turned out afterwards to be remarkably well. So I did\nnot like to make people anxious all for nothing.\nDuring these last two weeks I had not been experimenting\nat all.\nP.S.\u2014Suppose a man gives himself a self-induced vision of\nsomething horrid, would you think that it would then be pre-\nceded or followed by a white benevolent one ? Just as a happy\nbenevolent vision may be preceded by a black, smoky, horrid\none ? You see, I have many a time seen these two types\n\fMar., 1915. Revort of Mr. Grunbauvis Experiences. 47\ntogether at tlie same time, tlie black smoky one alternating\nwith the white benevolent one.\nIn reply to my enquiries and request for any corroborative\nevidence that might be obtainable, Mr. Griinbaum wrote\nagain :\nFebruary 3, 1915.\n. . . With this letter I send you the following particulars :\n(I.) The note announcing the death of my cousin, Mr. M., to\nmy cousin Mr. I., who is living here round the corner of the\nstreet. My own note being lost, I include his note, as both\nnotes have been delivered by the same postman at the same\ntime, the post-ofiice being opposite to us.\nThe postmark shows that this note reached him and me on\nJanuary 14th at about 10 o'clock at night It runs : W ,\n14.1.15, 1-2. N., which means : 14-Jan.-1915, between 1 and\n2 o'clock p.m.\n(II.) A note by my cousin, Miss M. M., who lives here also\naround the other corner of the street.\n(III.) A translation of the account of the accident that appeared\nin The Fatherland, a newspaper published here at H. W. being\nonly a small town, there is no special newspaper there.\n(IV.) I send also the copy of The Fatherlajid to you.\nFurther information has shown that the accident must have\nhappened as follows :\n[Here Mr. Griinbaum gives a diagram of the platforms and\nlines at W. railway station.]\nMy cousin had been taking a friend to the train going to\nA. He had taken leave of this friend, and, in order to come\nhome quickly, he seems to have walked across the lines behind\nthat train, in order to get out of the railway station before\nthe express from A. should pass. It happened, however, that\nthis express train, passing W. at full speed, without stopping,\ncaught him exactly at the moment when he was crossing.\nThis express train passes W., according to the time-table, at\n7.30 p.m. The annexed time-table ^ shows this.\nMy cousin brought his friend to the train that leaves W. at\n7.24. This train is generally late. The express from A. leaves\nA. at 7.15, and, as it takes about eighteen minutes to run from\nA. to W., it passes W. at full speed at about 7.30.\n1 The time-table showed all the times of these various trains! as stated\nby Mr. Griinbaum.\u2014A. J.\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1915.\nNow this is just the time that I generally take a little nap,\neither trying experimentally for visions or leaving it to chance.\nI am sure that I saw nothing at all at that time.\nYou will remember that in my previous letter I considered\nthe first horrid instantaneous violent skull (which was only visible\nfor about a tenth of a second) as the \" telepathic impulse.\"\nI hasten now to take back this supposition. As far as explana-\ntion goes, I don't know what to make of it.\nThe most incomprehensible part of the phenomenon lies for\nmyself in the fact that in the first black-rooted, violent halluci-\nnation there was nothing that could remind me in the slightest\nway of my cousin. These details came only later on in the\nbrilliant benevolent one.\nSo that my standpoint is now that I have no standpoint\nat all.\n(V.) I also enclose here a note of what my mother dreamt\nduring the night of the 12th. If there is anything more you\nmight like to know, please write to me.\nThe documents enclosed in this letter were as stated by\nMr. Griinbaum :\n(I.) The original obituary notice of his cousin's death with\na translation as follows :\n\" Herewith I give you notice of\nthe sudden death of my husband, Mr. W. M., at the age\nof 52 years. W ,\nJanuary 12, 1915. The funeral will\ntake place on Saturday at 1.30 p.m.\" The post-mark is as\ndescribed in Mr. Griinbaum's letter.\n(II.) A statement (in English) by his cousin. Miss M. M.,\nas follows :\nJanuary 31, 1915.\nThis is to certify that in the morning of the 13th of January\nI received a telegram giving me notice of the sudden death\nof my eldest brother W. My cousin [Mr. Griinbaum] coming\nto me at about 10 o'clock that same morning remarked to me,\nafter he had taken notice of the telegram, that it would not\nsurprise him at all if my brother had died during the beginning\nof the preceding night, giving, however, at that moment no\nfurther details as to what he meant by such a statement, as\nI was in a hurry to catch the train to W.\n(III. and IV.) A copy of the newspaper The Fatherland\nfor Thursday, January 14, 1915, containing a paragraph\n\fMae., 1915. RejJoH of Mr. Grunbcmm's Experiences. 49\nabout Mr. M.'s death, of which Mr. Griinbaum furnishes a\ntranslation as follows :\nThe Fatherland, 14tli January, 1915, morning edition.\nOn Tuesday evening there happened a terrible disaster at\nW., of which a highly esteemed citizen was the victim.\nMr. M., who was leaving the second platform (from which\nthe trains start for A.), in order to go out of the railway station,\nwas just at the moment that he was crossing the railway track\ncaught by an express train coming from A. He was so terribly\ninjured that death followed instantaneously.\n(V.) An account of the dream of Mr. Griinbaum's mother,\nwritten by herself, of which his accompanying translation is\nas follows :\nIn the night of 12 to 13 January between 5 and 6 o'clock\nin the morning, I dreamt that I was sitting in an auto. This\nauto was standing in front of the house where my nephew,\nMr. M., was born. When the auto began to run I felt very\nanxious lest it should run into the water, as the road was very\nsloping. At the moment when I expected that it would run\ninto the water, and my anxiety was the strongest, I awoke.\nOn receiving this account, I wrote to ask Mr. Griinbaum\nwhen his mother had first told him of her dream ; whether\nshe had at any other time had dreams or impressions which\nshe believed to coincide with a death or any other definite\nmisfortune ; whether she was inclined to believe that dreams\nhad significance ; and whether the house before which the\ndream-auto was standing was the same as the one at W.\nin which Mr. M. had recently been living. Mr. Griinbaum\nreplied :\nFebruary 13, 1915\nAs my mother is ill just now and is not allowed to come\nout of her bed (she is 75 years old), I will write down what\nshe told me just now.\nMy mother's dream. I remember very clearly and I am abso-\nlutely sure that my mother told me about her dream directly\nat breakfast on the 13th January, even before we received tidings\nfrom my niece, M. M., who lives quite near to us here in the\ncity. At breakfast as well as afterwards I did not pay any\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1915.\nattention to her dream, because I did not see any connection\nbetween her dream and the accident, as I did not know about\nany accident. The detail of the express train only reached\nus on the 14th, after M. M. had gone to Al. and W., and after\nshe had written about it, and after Mr. I. showed The Fatherhnd\nto us on the 14th.\nIn the newspaper we are reading (\nThe ) there has never\nappeared any note at all about the sudden death of my cousin.\nSo that it is only on the 14th January afternoon that Mr. I.\nshowed his newspaper, The Fatherland, to us, giving details about\nthe express train.\nWhen I wrote my first report to you I did not tell about\nmy mother's dream, because I did not judge it clear enough,\nand because an auto is not an express train, and because there\nwas nobody run over by the auto in her dream. But afterwards\nit came to me that it was anyhow a curious coincidence, and\nthat it might perhaps be of interest to you to know about it.\nIf my mother were not ill just now she would be willing\nto write about it herself to you, as she says that she is sure\nthat there must have been some sort of connection.\nOther experiences of my mother. If you do not count my own\nexperimenting with my mother {ivithout her knowledge) when\non three different occasions she heard :\n(a) the footsteps in the room above ;\n(b) the bird jumping in the room ;\n(c) somebody pacing up and down in the corridor,\nthen I know of only one incident that was very striking. It\nwas the following :\nOne of my mother's friends from her youth is the old minister\nof justice, Mr. K. He is an old man, now 84. He is living\non the other side of the city. I think it must have been in\nSeptember, 1914, that my mother one day coming down at\nbreakfast told me that she had a very curious experience that\nnight. She said :\n\" I was lying in a state of half-sleep this\nmorning, and all the while thinking about the European War,\nat about 6 o'clock in the morning, when all at once there appeared\nbefore my eyes a very big, bright visiting-card of about a foot\nlong as follows : [drawing of visiting card with Mr. K.'s name\non it]. The name was written in black type on a white card.\nMr. K. has not come to see me for the last three years, so I\nwonder what this means.\"\n\fMae., 1915. Report of Mr. Grunbau7n's Exjyeriences. 51\nOn that day nothing happened, but on the next day the old\nman really came to pay us a visit.\nMy mother has not at all the habit of ascribing any signi-\nficance to dreams. She knows of no other dreams or impressions\n[of her own] that coincided with any misfortune. When her\nonly daughter died in D. (she living quite near to her in the\nsame city) she had no intimation of it.\nThe city of Al. is the native town of my cousin, Mr. M.\nIt was in front of his native house in this city that the dream-\nauto started, not in W., where my cousin had been living as\nlong as twenty-seven years and where he was run over by the\npassing express train.\nSo that it comes to this : Both my mother and I had im-\npressions of a deadly danger, or even death, in some way connected\nwith my cousin W. M. My impression occurred four hours after\nthe accident happened, and before going to sleep. My mother's\nimpression occurred ten hours after it, and before she awoke.\nThe fact of the death was not made known to me till after\nbreakfast, when my cousin M. showed the telegram to me. The\nfacts about the express train only reached us on the 14th January\nwhen my cousin I. showed the copy of The Fatherland to me.\nIn the letter just quoted, Mr. Griinbaum refers to three\ninstances of apparently telepathic communication between\nhis mother and himself, when she had an impression corre-\nsponding to some impression or idea of his at about the\nsame time. The first instance was mentioned to me in one\nof his earlier letters. The third is given at the beginning\nof his letter of January 17, 1915, quoted above. The second\nwas described in a letter to me dated December 21, 1914,\nin which, after speaking of the \" low rumbling sound \" which\nsometimes accompanies his self-induced hallucinations, he\ngoes on :\nI heard this many a time when experimenting. Once, sitting\nopposite to my mother after dinner, I noticed it. On that\noccasion it was followed by the sound as if a big bird were\njumping on the floor behind me. I heard very distinctly the\n\" pit-a-pat \" of the bird along the wooden floor. As there was\na thick carpet on the floor, a real bird could not, of course, have\noccasioned such a sound.\nBut the curious point is that when my mother awoke, she\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1915.\nsaid :\n\" Dear me, how curious ! I thought there was a big\nbird in the room !\n\" She had not heard anything of the sound\nof rumbHngs.\nThese cases are not of course evidential, since they were\nnot fully recorded at the time, but only noted incidentally\nby Mr. Griinbaum when he was writing out reports of his\nown experiences. Nevertheless, if his recollection of them is\naccurate, there seems reason to believe that his mother's\nmind and his own may occasionally be in telepathic com-\nmunication.

As Professor\nBjarnason's report is very long and detailed, only selections\nfrom it can be published here. But first some account must\nbe given of how we got into communication with him, and\nunder what circumstances he made the enquiries upon which\nhis report is based.\nOn April 8, 1914, Professor Bjarnason wrote us a letter\ngiving an account of \" a poor peasant in the north of Iceland,\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apr. -May,\nknown by the name of Dreaming-Joi [Joe] . . . who for a\nlong time has been used as a dreaming oracle by his acquain-\ntances.\" Professor Bjarnason said that he had heard a good\nmany stories about Dreaming Joe, partly from two pupils\nof his own who knew him, and he wrote to ask whether\nthe Society for Psychical Research would care to have a\ndetailed report on the case, which would involve his\ngoing to the north of Iceland to obtain first-hand testimony\nfrom the people amongst whom Dreaming Joe had lived.\nIn the following May Professor Bjarnason sent us, by request,\na short preliminary report, giving such instances of Dreaming\nJoe's faculty as he had been able to collect at second hand\nduring the last few years. On the strength of this report\nit was decided that he should be asked to go to the north\nof Iceland on behalf of the Society to make a detailed investi-\ngation of the case.\nIn accordance with this plan Professor Bjarnason left\nReykjavik on July 9, 1914, for Raufarhofn, and spent about\na month travelling over the country in which Dreaming Joe\nhad spent his life, and collecting the evidence of various\npeople who had first-hand knowledge concerning his supposed\nfaculty. During part of this time Dreaming Joe himself\naccompanied Professor Bjarnason in the capacity of a guide.\nThe detailed report which Professor Bjarnason sent us on\nhis return to Reykjavik included all the evidence, negative\nas well as positive, which he had been able to collect in regard\nto Dreaming Joe. We have selected for publication at full\nlength instances in which Dreaming Joe appears to have been\nparticularly successful, but something will be said later of his\nfailures in regard to their bearing on an estimate of the whole\ncase. H. de G. V.]\nProfessor Bjarnason's Report.\n'\nOn Langanes, one of the most northern peninsulas of Iceland,\nthere lives a man named Johannes Jonsson. He has been\na shepherd and a farmer all his life, and has scarcely ever\nbeen outside his own parish. Yet he may be said to be\nknown throughout the whole country by the name of \" Dream-\ning Joe.\" He is so called because in his sleep he replies\nto questions which are put to him, tells people the where-\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 55\nabouts of lost things which uobody knows where to find,\nbesides informing them of various other things that they\nare desirous of knowing. At one time he was even a kind\nof oracle for the people of the north and east country.\nIt is now eight years since my interest in him was first\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. ape.-May\nawakened by the reports I heard of him, and especially by\nthose stories which were told to me by Mrs. Giidriin Bjorns-\ndottir, who was personally acquainted with Joe, and in whose\nservice he had been for some time. In April, 1906, I wrote\na letter to Mrs. Gudrun Bjornsdottir, asking her to obtain\nfor me reliable information about several facts concerning\nDreaming Joe. Mrs. Gudrun ^ then wrote to a sister of\nJoe's, A. Jonsdottir, who was an acquaintance of hers, for-\nwarding my letter to her, and asking her to obtain reliable\nanswers to my questions.\n[Professor Bjarnason then gives a list of his questions and\nthe answers obtained. I will only give a resume here of\nsuch facts as are not mentioned in the subsequent narrative.\nJoe was born of quite healthy parents, and his gift is not\nshared by any other members of his family. When he has\nbeen questioned in his sleep, he is conscious of fatigue after\nwaking. He does not always remember having been questioned,\nbut he is a light sleeper and often awakes during the question-\ning, and has only a dim recollection of what he has been\nasked about. His eyes are usually closed during the question-\ning, and, so far as is known, he has never walked in his\nsleep. If he is asked to dream of something, he concentrates\nhis thoughts on it before going to sleep ; then he can generally\ngive the desired information.\nProfessor Bjarnason adds that his own experience of Joe indi-\ncates that these answers are correct as far as they go.\nH. DE G. v.]\nBlOGEAPHICAL SkETCH.\nDreaming Joe, who is now living in the village of Thors-\nhofn on the Langanes, is fifty-three years of age. He was\nborn at Saudaneskot on the Langanes, on April 24, 1861.\nHe was brought up with his parents until his father died,\nwhich happened when he was eleven years of age. He then\nremoved with his mother to the parsonage of Saudanes, where\nhe stayed until he was nineteen years old (1880). During\nthis time he was twice taken seriously ill, it was thought\n1 In Iceland the custom of calling people by their forenames still prevails.\nThe ladies seldom bear their husband's surnames, but are generally called\nthe daughters of their father.

He says it was not certain that his\nfirst illness, which occurred when he was about thirteen years\nold, really was typhoid fever, but it was after that illness\nthat he first discovered the fact that he could sometimes\nat will dream the whereabouts of things he had lost ; but he\nwas never questioned in his sleep until he was over twenty\nyears old. Then he had become farm-servant at Ytra-L6n, which\nis the next farm to the north-east of the parsonage of Saudanes.\nAt Ytra-L6n he stayed for four years (until 1884), and was\noften questioned in his sleep. Fcom there he returned to\nSaudanes where he now stayed for two years (till 1886), and\nit was during these two years that he was most frequently\nquestioned.\n[Professor Bjarnason then relates how Dreaming Joe spent\nsome years moving from one farm to another, always in the\nsame district. H. de G. V.]\nIn the year 1893 he married, and since then it has\nalways been more difficult to get permission to question\nhim in his sleep, as his wife has always been greatly opposed\nto its being done. For he was sometimes asked about thefts\nand all kinds of misdoings, and betrayed people, which he\nwould never have done of his free will.\nWhile collecting the stories about Dreaming Joe and trying\nto obtain the best possible proofs of their veracity, I have\nmet with great difficulties on account of the long time which\nhas elapsed since some of the events occurred. I have as\nfar as possible proceeded in the following manner\n:\n(a) I have taken pains to find those people who have\nthemselves seen or heard what the stories state, having only\nin a few instances (as in the case of Doc. theol. S. P. Sivert-\nsen) taken stories recorded by noted men Avho had received\ntheir information of the facts from eye-witnesses or from Joe\nhimself.\n(6) I have also referred the stories to Joe, and recorded\nhis comments on them, as, after having become personally\nacquainted with him, I consider him scrupulously honest and\nvery trustworthy, and as he himself makes less of his gift\nthan most of those who have known him. Joe told me that\nin his younger days he often used to remember his dreams\nvery plainly when he awoke, but since he grew older he\nA 2\n\f58 Journcd of Society for Psychical Research. Apk.-May^\nremembers them very indistinctly or not at all. For this\nreason he remembers some of the oldest stories best.\n(c) I have got each person to record his account according\nto his own memory without previously telling him what I\nalready had heard from others of the same occurrence. This\nis why there are in some cases several variations of the same story.\nI. The Story op the Sheep.\n[I have included this story because it is the earliest re-\ncorded case in which Joe exercised his factdty, and it is a\ntypical example of the kind of powers which he is currently\nreputed to possess. Owing to the long lapse of time since\nthese events occurred, very little corroborative evidence can\nnow be obtained. H. de G. V.]\n{Recorded from Joe's own statement by Doc. theol. S. P. Sivertsen\non October 19, 1903.)\nOne day at Ytra-L6n [in the summer 1881] Joe lay down\nafter breakfast in the meadow for a nap. He then began to\ntalk in his sleep and said :\n\" The poor creatm'es are so awfully\ndistressed.\" This he repeated two or three times. Tryggvi\nJonsson, then farmer at Ytra-L6n [now in Pembina, N.D., U.S.A.],\nasked him what he saw in his sleep. Joe repHed :\n\" I see two\nsheep away up in the highlands, and they have hooked their\nhorns together and cannot disentangle themselves.\" Tryggvi\nthen asked him in what highlands they were. Joe could not\nsay. He thought it was either the Highlands of Hvammur\nor of Dal. Tryggvi then asked Joe if he could not see the\nmarks on their ears. To which Joe replied that he could only\nsee the marks on one ear, the one that turned up, for he thought\nthe sheep had been struggling about and were now so exhausted\nthat they were lying down. Joe described the marks that he\nsaw, so that Tryggvi concluded that one of the sheep belonged\nto the farmer Jon at Dal and the other to Sigfiis, the farmer\nat Hvammur. [They are now both dead.] Joe said that the\nsheep would not be able to disentangle themselves, for they had\nalready exerted themselves to the utmost. All this Tryggvi\ntold Joe when he awoke. He asked Joe what he had dreamt,\nand whether he knew that he had been questioning him. Joe did\nnot know anything about that, but said he had been dreaming\nsome nonsense about sheep.\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 59\nSome considerable time now elapsed until all the sheep had\nbeen gathered and driven down from the highlands in the autumn.\nThe sheep Joe had described had not been found anywhere.\nNow Sigurd, the son of Jon at Dal, happened to come and\nstay overnight at Ytra-L6n. People began to speak about the\nsheep and Joe's dj-'eam. Sigurd thought it remarkable how Joe\nhad answered in his sleep, and asked if they might not try\nto question him again, and ask him to describe more minutely\nthe place where the sheep were. Joe's permission was then\nobtained, and that night, after he had gone to sleep, they asked\nJoe about the place in the highlands ; and he described it so\nthat Sigurd at Dal felt certain that he recognized it as being\nin the Dal highlands.\nSome time later Sigurd went to the highlands and found the\ntwo sheep with their horns hooked together, lying dead in a\nplace which was just like the one that Joe had described. One\nof the sheep belonged to Jon at Dal, and the other to Sigfus\nat Hvammur.\nI have been trying to obtain proofs of the facts (1) that\nJoe was questioned in his sleep, and (2) that the sheep were\nfound according to his directions.\nAs to the first point, I have written to Tryggvi Jonsson,\nthe discoverer of Joe's gift, but have as yet received no reply.\nOn the other hand, I have quite unexpectedly received the following\ne\\'idence :\nThorshofn, June 25, 1914.\nI, the undersigned, Johann Gunnlaugsson, bailiff, hereby testify\nthat I Avas out in the meadow and heard distinctly when my\nbrother-in-law Tryggvi Jonsson asked Dreaming Joe about the\nsheep in this story, and that the story is quite true and correct\naccording to my memory.\nJoHANN Gunnlaugsson, BaiUff.\nAs to the second point, it is difficult to prove that the\nsheep were found according to Joe's directions. Sigurd at\nDal is dead, and neither his wife nor daughter, whom I\nhave seen, remember anything about this. But this may\nbe accounted for by the fact, that this happened just before\nhe was married. But Bjorn Jonsson, bailiff, a brother of\nthe deceased Sigurd at Dal, remembers it. When asked\nabout this on July 19, 1914, he replied that he remembers\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Aph.-Mat,\nthat the sheep were found according to Joe's directions.\nLastly I have received the following evidence from men who\nhave of their own accord told me this story :\nReykjavik, July 7, 1914.\nWe, the undersigned, recognize this story and remember to\nhave heard in our youth that the sheep were found in the place\ndescribed by Joe.\nBj. J6n. JoHANNESSON, Karl H. Bjarnakson,\nPrinters.\nThe following stories occurred while Joe was at Saudanes\nfor the second time (1884-1886) in the service of the clergy-\nman, the Rev. Vigfiis Sigurdsson. Larus Johannesson had\nthen just taken orders and become curate to the Rev. Vigfus.\nThe Rev. Larus had heard about Dreaming Joe, and asked\nhim if he really was as peculiar as he was said to be. Joe\nreplied that rumours generally exaggerated. But some days\nlater the Rev. Larus tried Joe's powers in the following\nmanner.\nII. The Curate's AVhip.\n{Recorded by Doc. theol. S. P. Sivertsen in 1903 from\nJoe's own statement.)\nThe Rev. Larus was summoned to the farm Lseknisstadir to\nchristen a child. AVhen his horse had been saddled he said\nthat he couldn't find his whip, which was quite new and had\nbeen made by the silversmith Bjorn Palsson. He therefore asked\nsome of the lads to lend him a whip. He then asked Joe to\ntry to find the whip for him, while he was away. Joe was\nshy with the clergyman, and made no reply. The curate then\nasked whether Sveinn Jonsson [now living at Nordfjordur] might\nnot ask Joe about it, while he was away. Sveinn Jonsson was\na fellow-servant of Joe's, and Joe gave him permission to try.\nDuring the night Sveinn asked Joe about the whip. Joe replied\nthat he saw the whip, but he would not tell where. Joe did\nnot say any more that night. Next morning Sveinn told him\nwhat he had said, and was vexed with him for not telling where\nthe whip was. Next night Sveinn questioned him again, but\nreceived the same reply. This time Joe remembered that he\ndreamt of the whip, but would not tell Sveinn where he had\ndreamt it was, for he thought he might be mistaken. He there-\nV\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 61\nfore went out to find the whip himself, according to his dream.\nHe found it in a horse-stall in a stable in the home-field, where\nit lay under a heap of refuse of hay. Two days later the Rev.\nLarus came home and was told what reply Sveinn had received\nfrom Joe in his sleep. He then wanted to question Joe once\nmore. But that evening Joe went into the stable and took the\nwhip and removed it to the next stall. In the night Joe awoke,\nso they couldn't question him. In the morning the curate\nasked him about the whip, and Joe told him to come with\nhim down to the stable ; and there he showed him the whip\nand told him that he had removed it the evening before. The\nRev. Larus had himself hidden the whip in the stable.\nJoe told me this summer (1914) that lie remembers all\nthis very distinctly, and would be willing to swear in court\nto its truth, except the item that he removed the whip to\nthe next stall, which is not correct ; he says that he only\nthought of doing so, for he thought that perhaps Sveinn had\nhidden the whip to fool him. Still it seemed to him the\nfirst night that he saw the Rev. Larus go into the stable\nwith the whip, but he could not believe it of the clergyman.\nIt was rather late in the day when they walked down towards\nthe stable, and when Joe was going in, the curate asked\n:\n\" Are you going in there 1\n\" Joe made no reply, but went\nin, while the curate remained outside. He took the whip\nfrom under the hay and brought it to the curate. The\nRev. Larus now laughed and said :\n\" Well, you certainly\nare a remarkable man.\" Then the curate told Joe that he\nhad hidden the whip in order to try his powers.\nThe Rev. Larus died in 1888, and his widow, Mrs. Gudrun,\ndoes not remember anything about this occurrence, so you\ncannot get any first-hand evidence thereof. Still, I have\nspoken with a very reliable man, Bjorn Gudmundsson, at\nHallgilsstadir, who told me this story even more minutely\nthan Joe had done. He said that among other things the\nclergyman had said to Joe : \"It isn't so easy to steal at\nSaudanes now. I shouldn't like to be the one to do it.\"\nWhen I asked Joe about this, he smiled and said he remem-\nbered these words, but he had not thought it befitting to\nrepeat them as those of a clergyman.\nFrom Sveinn Jonsson I have received the following statement\n:\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apr. -Mat,\nNoRDFJoRDUR, August 22, 1914.\n... I remember that the Rev. Larus lost a whip which was\nfound according to the direction of Dreaming Joe. I am sorry\nI cannot give more information about this incident as I have\nfor the most part quite forgotten it.\n. . . Dreaming Joe was often and by many people questioned\nin his sleep about all kinds of things which they desired to know\nsomething about. He always replied promptly, and experience\nshowed that his answers always proved reliable. I have myself\noften asked Joe in his sleep about many things and could always\nrely on his answers.\nI was with him at Saudanes for ten years.\nSVEINN JONSSON.\nIII. Sees fifty Sheep and finds them.\n{Recorded by Doc. theol. S. P. Sivertsen in 1903 fro7n\nJoe's own statement.)\nOnce fifty sheep were missing from the fold at Saudanes.\nThey were searched for for two whole days. Then the Rev.\nVigfiis asked Joe to take a nap. Joe did so, and the clergyman\ntried to ask him about the sheep. Joe now described the place\nwhere the sheep were, and said that they were lying together\non the southern slope of a high hill, and that to the north and\nnorth-east of this place there was a barren moor. When Joe\nawoke he remembered plainly that he had dreamt of the place\nwhere the sheep were. He got a horse to ride in search of them.\nHe went straight to a hill which he saw was just like the one\nof which he had dreamt, and there he found all the missing sheep.\nWhen asked about this story Joe said it was not quite\ncorrect. He thought there had only been about thirty sheep.\nHe says, too, that the Rev. Vigfus tried to question him, but\ndid not succeed, as he then awoke. But still he requested\nhim to go and look for the sheep, as he thought that he\nabove all others would be able to find them. The clergy-\nman now lent him his own horse. Joe started off, and\nwhen he was out in the open field, he lay down and dreamt\nof the sheep. His dream was just as is stated above, and\nhe found the sheep according to his dream.\nI have not been able to obtain any further evidence of\nthis story ;\nstill, I think it worth relating, as it shows how\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 63\nearly Joe began to practise a method he has especially culti-\nvated in his later years, viz. dreaming for himself, when other\npersons either are not able or not allowed to question him.\nThere are many other stories of Joe's finding missing sheep,\nwhich could be verified.\nIV. Little Vigfi^ts's Puese.\n{Recorded by Mrs. Gudrun {see p. 56) in 1906.)\nOne evening everybody had gone to bed except my sister\nHalldora, Metta and I. Metta went upstairs and was about\nto go to bed, when she heard that Joe was talking in his sleep.\nHe said it was too bad that he couldn't tell anyone about little\nVigfus's purse. Vigfiis Thordarson (a nephew of the Rev. Vigfus)\nhad lost a purse and had begged Joe to try to find it for him.\nThen Metta asked him if he could see it. Joe repHed that there\nwas a purse behind the stove in the north-room, but it was\nempty. Metta came down and told me this. I went into the\nnorth-room and found the purse, but it was empty. We then\nwent upstairs again and Metta asked Joe where the money was.\nHe said that little Jonas (a lad at the parsonage) had taken it\nand had thrown the purse there, in order to make it appear as\nif it had been taken by some of the people who came to church.\nHe added that little Jonas would be fortunate if he didn't get\ninto mischief some day. He said that the money was wrapped\nup in a rag and was stuck into a hole in the wall of the store-\nhouse. There was also some money therein that did not belong\nto Vigfus, but was the savings of Jonas himself. I don't re-\nmember how much money he said was wrapped up in the rag,\nbut it proved to be just as he said. I now went out to search\nfor it, and while I was away Joe said that I was feeling all\nover the wall without finding the right place. I then went\nin again, as I couldn't find the money, and Metta asked him\nmore minutely about this. He then said there were two holes\nin the wall [the wall being made of turf and stone] near the\ndoor of the storehouse. In one of these the lads always kept\nthe wedge with which they split the fuel ; but in the other\nhole was the rag containing the money, and if one looked care-\nfully, a bit of the rag might be seen sticking out of the hole.\nAll this proved just as Joe said. I went out again and found\nthe hole at once, for on looking more carefully, I saw the rag sticking\nout of the hole.\n\f(j4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apk.-May,\nMiss Halldora, Mrs. Gudrun's sister, tells this story in exactly\nthe same way as Mrs. Gudruii, although they have not for\nmany years spoken about this subject.\nMetta has emigrated to America. I have written to her\nbrother-in-law, Jon Jonsson, from Sledbrjot (formerly an M.P.\nhere), who also is living in America, and he has promised me\nto obtain for me Mrs. Metta's evidence concerning this case.\nThe owner of the purse, now the Rev. Vigfus Thordarson\nat Hjaltastadm\", remembers this quite well, although he was\nvery young, but it seems to him that he himself questioned\nJoe and found the purse, which can hardly be true against\nthe evidence of Mrs. Gudrun and Miss Halldora.\nJoe himself had almost forgotten this occurrence, but on\nbeing reminded of it, he recollected it quite well.\nV. Sees the Rev. Halldob's Purse.\n(a) Statement by Mrs. Gudriin, made in 1906.\nThe last winter that my brother Halldor was at Saudanes,\nhe lost a purse, and Joe was asked about it. When the purse\nhad been described to him, Joe said that such a purse was in\nthe pocket of a jacket which was hanging in the house at Eld-\njarnsstadir (a farm in the parish of Saudanes) and that the\njacket belonged to Hallgrimur. The next time Hallgrimur came\nto church at Saudanes, Halldor asked him about the purse, which\nhe then produced, taking it out of his pocket.\n{h) Statement by the Rev. Hallddr Bjarnarson.\nReykjavik, July 4, 1914.\nIn the sjiring of 1885 I was at Saudanes. Joe was then a\nservant there. The previous autumn I had lost a purse, which\nI had laid in the window of the north-room at Saudanes. I\nasked the people to question Joe about the purse. When he\nwas asked about this, he first replied that he did not know what\nthis purse looked like. It was then described to him. It had\nno lock, but was kept closed by a piece of elastic. Then Joe\nreplied that there was a purse like that in the pocket of a jacket\nat Eldjarnsstadir. The jacket was hanging in the room under\nthe staircase and belonged to Hallgrimur, who had been a servant\nat Saudanes the year before. A week or two later Hallgrimur\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 65\ncame to cliurcli. I then took him aside and told him that\nI suspected him to have a purse which I had lost the year\nbefore. Thereupon he took the purse out of his pocket and\nasked me if that was mine. I recognized it at once. He then\ntold me that he had found it under the wall of the storehouse,\nand said he was very sorry he had spent 35 auv. (=5 pence)\nwhich were in it. I said that it did not matter at all, as I\nhad only asked about the purse in order to see what Joe was\nable to do. Some of the children had evidently taken the purse-\nand carried it out.\nHalldor Bjarnarson.\nA similar story is told in the article on Dreaming Joe ia\nHeimsJcringla, April 1, 1891, where the main facts correspond\nwith what is related above.\nJoe himself has a vague recollection of this story.\nVI. Sees the Ship \" Kristine.\"\nThe Rev. Halldor Bjarnarson of Prestholar relates the following :\nEeykjavik, July 8, 1914.\nIn the spring of 1885, I was one evening after bedtime standing\nwith my brother-in-law, the late Rev. Larus, on the stony slope\nabove the house at Saudanes. We then saw a ship which was\nsailing in, and was already inside the Brimnestangi. We at once\nthought that it was the ship Kristine belonging to the \" Grana\n\"\nTrading Company, for Joe had been asked about it the preceding\nnights. The hrst time he saw it to the south of Iceland, and\nthe second time he said it was off the eastern firths. I now\nwent in and upstairs. Everybody there was fast asleep. Joe\nslept in a bed under the sloping ceiling, but I stood by the\ngable Avindow, facing the north, and could from there see the\nship. I then asked Joe if he could tell me where the Kristine\nwas now. He mumbled something and then he said that it was\nin the bay, opposite to the Lambanes' breakers, and was saihng\nin. I saw through the window that this was exactly correct.\nHalldor Bjarnarson.\nJoe confirms this story. He remembers being asked about\nKristine several times.\nI have not got any more stories of Joe from his second\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Avk. May,\nstay at Saudanes. The following three stories are from his\nsecond stay (1886-88) at Ytra-L6n.\nVII. The Embroidered Suspenders.\n{Stateynent by Mrs. Gudrun, recorded in 1906.)\nBjorn Gudmundsson at Hallgilsstadir once came to Saudanes\non his way to Ytra-L6n. Bjorn had with him a pair of em-\nbroidered suspenders, which he had been asked to take to the\nsaddle-maker in order to have the straps put on them. But\nBjorn lost the suspenders. When he came to Ytra-L6n, Joe\nwas asked about the suspenders, which he had lost. He said\nthat Bjorn had left them at the bottom of a barrel, in the\nnorth storehouse at Saudanes, and that Sigvaldi, a servant at\nSaudanes, would find them and return them. This proved as\nJoe said.\nOn July 21, 1914, I spoke to Bjorn at Hallgilsstadir. He\nremembered this incident at once, and added that he went\nback to Saudanes, and when he came there, Sigvaldi had\nnot yet found the suspenders, but had said he would find\nthem, which he also did very soon. He found them at the\nbottom of a barrel in the storehouse.\nSigvaldi is now dead.\nJoe says that this story is quite correct.\nVIII. The Horse with the Clean-shaven Tail.\n(Statement by Mrs. Gudrun, recorded in 1906.)\nOnce there was a change of tenants at the farm of Brinmes\non the Langanes. 0 was the name of the tenant who\nsurrendered the lease, but his successor was called S . At\nthe time of this story 0. was still at Brinmes, and the two\nfarmers were not on friendly terms. One morning when the\npeople came into the stable, they saw that the tail of S.'s\nfavourite horse had been very closely shaved. S. was greatly\ngrieved at this offence, and had some one ask Joe for him who\nhad done this. Joe rephed that he supposed 0. knew some-\nthing about it. He requested this to be kept secret, for he\ndid not wish 0. to hear that he had accused him of doing this.\nNevertheless, this soon came to O.'s ears, and he was greatly\nenraged. He even threatened to report Joe to the magistrate\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 67\nfor this. Joe then told him he might do as he liked about\nthat, but he would then tell where he had hidden the horse-hair.\n0. never reported the case to the magistrate. But Joe said\nthat he had buried the horse-hair on the beach, and there it\nwas found.\nI have heard this story from different people, as so many\nknow it, for it caused some sensation in its time. But it\nwas especially memorable to Joe, on account of the fuss that\nwas made about it all over the Langanes. He was so annoyed\nby this, that after this he was very reluctant to allow people\nto question him in his sleep, unless he could trust their\nsecrecy.\nMiss Halldora and the Rev. Halldor of Prestholar both\nconfirm this story, and several other people who still live\non the Langanes. \u2022\n\u2022\nIX. The Story op the Needle-case.\nMrs. Gudrun relates the following :\n[Recorded in 1906, revised in 1914.]\nWhen I left Prestholar (in 1895) I moved to Sigurdarstadir\non the Melrakkasletta. Joe was then on the Langanes, living\nat his farm, 'Assel, more than a day's journey from Sigurdar-\nstadir. During the summer, while I was at Sigurdarstadir, I\nhappened to lose my needle-case and couldn't imagine how I\nhad lost it. I always used to carry it in my pocket, and from\nthere it disappeared. I had often mentioned how sorry I was\nto lose that needle-case, for I had had it so long. That summer\nI had a maidservant Avho later took service at Langanes.^ I\ndon't remember how long a time passed until I once got a message\n[Mrs. Gudrim is not sure it was a letter] from her saying that\nshe had asked Dreaming Joe how my needle-case had been lost,\nand where it was to be found. He had told her in his sleep\nthat once the preceding summer I had gone down to the mouth\nof the river at Sigurdarstadir to drive away the cows from Odds-\nstadir [the next farm to the west]. It was as if Joe saw it\nall in his sleep, although it had happened a year before, for\nhe smiled as he said :\n\" Well, well, the way Mrs. Gudrun bustles\nMrs. Gudrun did not remember her name, but she thought it was Ingibjorg\nAmadottir, now living at Seydisfjordur.\u2014Ag. Bj.\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. Aph.-Mat,\nabout. There she is running after the cows, and there the\nneedle-case falls out of her pocket, as she holds up her skirts.\"'\nHe then said that the sea took the needle-case, but that it\nhad now drifted on shore again, and was lying by a stone which\nstood just below some old walls on the gravel plains. I found\nthe needle-case at once according to this description, but there\nwas a rent in the lid, which was screwed on, and the end of\nit had fallen out. But I have had the lid mended and the\nend filled up with cork. More than a year had passed from\nthe time I lost the needle-case until I found it again.\nJoe denies any knowledge of this incident, and says :\n\" This\nis either a fib invented by Mrs. Gudrun or somebody has\nasked me in my sleep and then run away without telling\nme anything about it.\"\nI have myself seen Mrs. Gudrun's needle-case, which is\njust as described above, and am personally convinced of the\ntruth of her story, as she is a most trustworthy person.\nStill, I have met with the greatest difficulties in trying to\nget this story verified. I have sought all the way from\nHusavik to Seydisfj(')rdur for the woman Ingibjorg Arnadottir,\nwho\u2014-Mrs. Gudrun thought\u2014was the servant who had\nquestioned Joe. At last I found her at Seydisfjordur. But\nshe said she knew nothing about this, and that it could not\nhave been she who questioned Joe, for she had gone straight\nfrom Raufarhofn to Seydisfjordur and had never stayed on\nthe Langanes. But she told me about two other women,\nwho had been her fellow-servants at Mrs. Gudrun's, Salgerd\nSigurdardottir, who is probably dead now, and Gudrun Bald-\nvinsdottir from Fagranes on the Langanes. She is the one\nmost likely to know something about this, and if she does\nand I can find out where she lives, I shall soon procure\nher evidence. But this will take some time.\nX. Jon Skinni's Trunk.\n(a) Doc. theol. S. P. Sivertsen recorded this story in 1903\nas told to him by Johann Gunnlaugsson, bailiff at Thorshofn :\nJon \" Skinni \" Jonsson, shoemaker at Thorshofn, lost a trunk\noff one of the coasting steamers. Joe dreamt he saw the trunk\nin a place which he described minutely, although he said he\nhad never been there. He also described the trunk, how it\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. G9\nlooked and wliat was in it. Under the locker lie said there\nwas a clock, covered over by a pillow-case. The trunk itself was\npainted yellow. All his description was correct. The descri^^tion\nhe gave of the place fitted a storehouse at Seydisfjordur, in which\nthe trunk was subsequently found.\nWhen Mr. S. P. Sivertsen asked Joe himself about this,\nhe remembered Jon Skinni\"s trunk, and said that Jon had\nthanked him for helping him to find it, and had said he\nwould certainly never have got it without his help.\nJon Skinni died shortly after 1900.\n(6) The following corroborative evidence has been received\nfrom J. J. Dahlmann :\n- - \u2022 Keykjavik, April 14, 1911.\nProm the year 1892 to 1900 I lived at Seydisfjordur. In the\nsummer of 1898 I travelled to Thorshofn, where I made the\n.acquaintance of a man named Jon Jonsson, generally called\nSkinni,\" as he was from a place called Skinnastadur. This\nman complained that his wife had lost a trunk which she had\nhad with her on board the S.S. Hdlar. He said that her initials\nand the name of the town of Thorshofn had been inscribed\non the trunk with blue crayon. He also told me that he had\nconsulted Dreaming Joe [then living at the farm of 'Assel] and\nasked him to try to look for the trunk in a dream. Dreaming\nJoe was by that time well knowm for his dream visions. Noav\nJoe tried to find the trunk and said that he had seen it among\ndifferent things, in a certain house, the walls of which were only\nabout two feet high, and which had a sheet-iron roof. Just below\nthe house he said there was a pier ; he also said the house was\nstanding in a firth which he described quite minutely. Joe was\nquite unacquainted with the firths on the east coast for he\nhad never been there : but still he said he was pretty sure that\nthe firth he now saw was Seydisfjordur. I also recognized the\n\u2022description as being that of Seydisfjordur, and the house Avhich\nJoe had mentioned as being the storehouse of the United Steamship\nCompany.\nJon Skinni now asked me to inquire about this trunk at Seydis-\nfjordur. I wrote his description of the trunk in my j^ocket-book,\nand among other things he told me that nearest the lid there were\nstockings and other articles of dress. The note-book with the\n\u2022description is still in my possession, although some of the words\n\f70 Joxivnal of Society for Psychical Research. Apk.-Mat,\n\" A.J.\nThorshofn\nare so faded that they are quite illegible. But what is still discernible\nis thus :\nOakpainted . . . with a black stripe . . . brass\ntacks on the lid . . . dovetailed, with an ivory\nkeyplate.\"\nWhen I came to Seydisfjordur I asked the United Steamship\nCompany's agent, Consul Stefan Jonsson, about this. He said\nthat it was not very probable that the trunk was still at the Com-\npany's storehouse, but gave me permission to go in there and\nlook for it. I went in and looked for the trunk for some time.\nAt last I found it in a corner, under a heap of all kinds of\ngoods. This trunk corresponded exactly to the description I\nhad of Skinni's trunk, except that there was no inscription visible.\nI then went back to the Consul, St. Jonsson, and told him that\nI had found the trunk in the storehouse, and described it to\nhim. He then said that the trunk I have found belonged to\na carpenter up in the country, and that it was to be sent along\nto him at the earliest opportunity. Thereupon I wrote to Jon Skinni,\ntelling him the result of my search.\nWhen I came again to Thorshofn the following summer (1899)\nI asked Jon Skinni whether he had got his trunk, to which\nhe replied that he had. He told me that on the receipt of\nmy letter, he had written to the steamship company's agent\nat Seydisfjordur, and told him what were the contents of his\ntrunk, and sent him the key, so that he could open it. It\nthen appeared that the trunk was the one that his wife had\nlost, and it was sent to him to Thorshofn. The blue inscription\nhad faded off.\nJoN J. Dahlmann.\nI have myself seen Mr. Dahlmann's note-book, containing\nthe fragments of the description, cited above. The copy is\ncorrect, but there is no date to this memorandum.\nThe storehouse at Seydisfjordur in which Joe is said to have\nseen Jon Skinni's trunk, is quite rmique. A house called\n\" Liverpool,\" belonging to a mercantile firm, was once swept\noff its foundation by an avalanche. The foundation, which\nis about two feet high, was later furnished with rafters and\ncovered with a sheet-iron roof, and used by the steamship\ncompany as a storehouse in and about 1898.\n[Professor Bjarnason sent us two photographs of the store-\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 71\nhouse, showing the very low-pitched roof which distinguishes\nit from neighbouring storehouses. H. de G. V.]\nI spoke to Consul St. Th. Jonsson at Seydisfjordur, but\nhe had only a vague recollection of this incident. He had\nJon Skinni's letter searched for, but it was not to be found.\nThe Consul promised me to ask the man who had then\nhad on hand the expedition of goods at the storehouse about\nthis, in case he should remember it, but I have not yet heard\nfrom him concerning this.\nThe merchant, Mr. Pall Oddgeirsson, Westman islands, has\nprocured for me the following statement of Jon Skinni's\nwidow, Mrs. Anna Jonathansdottir, and their daughter Gud-\nbjorg :\nVestmanneyjar, September 19, 1914.\nJon Jonsson from Skinnastad, who lost the trunk, asked Dream-\ning Joe to try to dream about it. The result was as follows :\nJoe said that the trunk was in a storehouse at Seydisfjordur\n[which had formerly been swept away by an avalanche]. He\ndescribed the trunk thus :\n\" Oak painted\u2014yellow\u2014with a bone\nkeyplate, and no inscription, but large chalk marks on the bottom,\"\nbut Mrs. Anna does not remember what marks he said they\nwere. In the trunk he said there was a small clock and a\nchessboard, and these things, he said, were lying under the\nlocker. The key was sent to Seydisfjordur, and a trunk exactly\ncorresponding to the one Joe dreamt of was found in the store-\nhouse above mentioned, and the above-mentioned articles were\nfound under the locker. Mrs. Anna and her daughter both assert\nthat this is irrefutably true.\nXL Predicts the Arrival op a Steamer.\n(a) Doc. theol. S. P. Sivertsen recorded this story, in 1903,\nas told to him by Joe himself\n:\nIn the autumn of 1901, many people from Seydisfjordur were\nwaiting for the S.S. Mjolnir at Thorshofn. Among others there\nwere Kristjan Jonsson, ;\nshipowner from Gunnolfsvik, and his\nservant GisH. They were getting tired of waiting, as a whole\nweek had passed from the time at which the ship was expected.\nKristjan then sent Gisli to Joe and begged him to allow Gisli\nto ask him in his sleep about the ship. Gisli slept with Joe\nthat night, and asked him about the ship. Joe said it would\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apr.-May.\narrive the following day, and, if that did not come true, it would\nnot be of any use for them to wait any longer. But this came\ntrue, for Mjolnir arrived that day.\n(6) On July 25, 1914, this story was told to me by Mr.\nIvristjan Jonsson, shipowner at Gunnolfsvlk, thus :\nIn the year 1901 I went to Thorshofn in order to catch a\nsteamer there, by which I intended to take my workpeople to\nSeydisfjordur. The Mjolnir was expected to touch at Thorshofn,\nalthough it was not bound to do so, as Thorshofn was not in-\ncluded in its route. I had fourteen people with me, and it\nwas therefore very important for me to get some information\nconcerning the ship. When I had been waiting for five days,\n1 began to feel uneasy and thought that perhaps the ship had\nsailed by on its way east. I then decided to send one of my\nfishermen, Gisli 'Olafsson Frejdendal to 'Assel, where Joe lived,\nwith a message asking him to find out for me where the Mjolnir\nwas now. Gisli stayed with Joe overnight, but came to Thors-\nhofn between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, telling me not\nto worry, for the Mjolnir would arrive at Thorshofn at about\n2 o'clock that same day. Joe had seen it in the night, sailing\npast a low land. He said there had been a man standing on\nthe bridge, who resembled me somewhat, and wore his beard\nthe same way as I did. This description agreed with that\nof the captain Endresen. The rest also proved true. The\nship arrived at Thorshofn about the middle of the day. I then\nwent on board and asked the captain whose watch it had been\nat midnight, to which he replied : \"It was I Avho was then on\nthe bridge.\" \" Where were you then ?\n\" I asked. \" I was\nthen saihng past the island of Flatey.\" And thus this all agreed\nwith what Joe had said.\nKristjan Jonsson.\n(c) Evidence of Gudm. Finnbogason, Ph.D. :\nReykjavik, September 9, 1914.\nI was a passenger on board the Mjolnir in the autumn of\n1901, when the above incident took place. I remember that\nthe ship was about a week behind its appointed time. I went\nashore in the first boat together with Thorsteinn Skaflason from\nSeydisfjordur and some others. Th. Skaflason and I went straight\nup to Snabjorn Arnljotsson's house, where we had breakfast.\nI remember that Mr. Sn. Arnljotsson told us when we came that\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 73\nhe had known that the Mjolnir would come that day, as Joe\nhad seen it passing a flat island in the night ; I think he said\nat 3 o'clock, and we concluded that it was the island of Hrisey.^\nThis is all I remember concerning this.\nGUDM. FiNNBOGASON, Ph.D.\nI have not yet received any answer to my letter from the\nother witness, Editor Th. Skaflason, Seydisfjordur.\nI have neither been able to find Gisli 0. Frejdendal nor\nthe captain mentioned in this story.\nXII. The Missing Purse at Thorshofn.\n(a) Statement by Adalsteinn Jonasson, farmer at Hvamnmr.\nHvAMMUR, July 21, 1914.\nIt was in the butchering season, in the end of September or\nthe beginning of October, 1913, that I employed the farmer Vigfus\nJosefsson of Kiida to slaughter sheep for me. Early in the day\nhe took off his jacket and laid it on the wall, and in his jacket-\npocket was a purse containing 17 crowns (Danish) and 10 ore.\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon he paid a man 1 cr. out of\nhis purse, and putting the purse back in the pocket he laid the\njacket in the same place. In the evening when he was going to\ntake his jacket^ it lay flapping on the wall, and the purse was\ngone. Vigfus came home and complained to us of his loss, and\nwe went out with a lantern and searched for the purse. But we\ncould not find it. That same evening I applied to Joe. He said\nhe would try to dream about the purse, although he thought it\nwas not of much use and that it would be better for me to try\nto ask him in his sleep. Joe himself had been absent at the\ntime of the disappearance of the purse, as he had been sent to\nsearch for some horses.^ As I lived in another house, I asked Joe\nif he would not rather try to dream about the purse. In the\nnight Joe dreamt about the purse so distinctly, that I could from\nwhat he told me give an accurate description of it to the owner,\nwhich he said was quite right. Joe said at once after this first\n1 It is more probable that the ship was sailing past Flatey.\u2014Ag. Bj.\n2 Asked when he had gone to fetch the horses, Joe replied that he had\ngone before 4 o'clock and did not return before the sheep slaughtering was\nover and the men were carrying home the meat.\u2014Ag. Bj.\n^\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apr. -May,\nnight that the purse would be found. He said he had dreamt\nthat he saw a man take the purse out of the jaclset pocket and\nhide it in a pile of clods under the western wall of the so-called\n\"ice-depot.\" Joe had gone there pretty early in the morning,\nand it seemed to him as if one of the clods had been displaced;\nbut he did not find the purse. The next night Joe dreamt of the\npurse again, and when I asked him about it in the morning, he\nsaid he had dreamt something similar to what he had dreamt the\nnight before, and the purse would be found. I went home that\nday, in order to start off for the mountains to gather the sheep,\nand I asked Joe to come and bring me the purse, if it should be\nfound. In the afternoon of October 9 I came back from the\nmountains, and then Joe had just arrived. He brought me the\npurse, from which nothing had been taken. He then told me that\nhe had dreamt of the purse in a new place the third (or fourth) night.\nAnd that time he had dreamt of it outside an ice-house, which is\njust by the ice-depot. I believe he told me that he dreamt of it\nthere under a slab ^ of stone. He had gone in the morning and\nfound it under the slab of stone. I then kept the purse for about\na fortnight, and returned it to the bailiff, Hjortur at 'Aland,\nin compliance to the owner's request.\nAndalstbinn Jonasson.\nThat same day [Jixly 21, 1914], I visited the bailiff, Hjortur\nat 'Aland, and he told me that he had received the purse and\nreturned it to the owner, Vigfus at Kuda.\nOn July 25 I was at Thorshofa, and Joe showed me the\nplaces where he had dreamt of the purse. The pile of clods\nwas still outside the \" ice-depot.\" I also saw the ice-house,\nbut the so-called \" Red Shed \" had been moved off its founda-\ntion and put on another. Nor did I see any stone slab to the\nnorth of the old foundation. But it might easily have been\nremoved or thrown away, while the shed was being moved.\nJoe took no witnesses with him when he was looking for the\npurse.\n1 On being asked, Joe told me that he dreamt of the purse outside the\nice-house the second night. Then a night passed in which he either did not\ndream of the purse at all or at least very indistinctly. The fourth night he\nsaid he dreamt that the purse was lying under a large slab of stone beyond\nthe so-called \" Red Shed,\" but not, as above stated, beyond the ice-house.\nThere he dreamt of it the second night. He found it after the fourth night\nunder the stone.\u2014Ag. Bj.\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 75\n{h) The Evidence of Vigfus of Kikld.\nKUDA, September 17, 1914.\nI, the undersigned, hereby testify that the purse which I lost\nout of my jacket-pocket, September 30, 1913, was found by\nJohannes Jonsson at Thorshofn, containing just what had been\nin it when it was lost.\nVigft5s Josefsson.\nThis last story, if true in every detail, shows that Joe has\nbeen in full possession of his remarkable gift as late as in\nthe autumn of 1913. Since that he has not, as far as I know,\ndreamt anything remarkable, nor has he been asked about\nanything in his sleep, until in the summer of 1914, when I\ntried to ask him about several things for three nights, at\nVopnafjordur, but without any positive result, as will be seen\nin the part I give below of the protocol then made.\nExperiments with Dreaming Joe.\n[Professor Bjarnason first gives an account of an experiment\nwhich was carried out in 1903 by a group of investigators, to\ntry whether Joe could perceive clairvoyantly some names\nwritten on slips of paper enclosed in sealed envelopes. Special\nconditions were devised to eliminate thought-transference. The\nresult of the experiment w^as not recorded in detail, but so far\nas can be ascertained, Joe failed to read any of the slips.\nAs regards clairvoyance, therefore, the conclusion to be drawn\nfrom this experiment is negative. In 1914 Professor Bjarnason\ntried some experiments with Joe himself. On tw^o successive\nnights, July 27 and 28, 1914, he arranged with a friend in\nReykjavik, Mr. 0., that the latter should perform some con-\nspicuous and unusual action, whilst Professor Bjarnason, who\nwas staying with Joe at Vopnafjordur, should question him in\nhis sleep and endeavour to obtain some account of what Mr. 0.\nwas doing at Reykjavik. In this case also the result of th.e\nexperiment was negative. On the first night Professor Bjarnason\nfound it impossible to question Joe, because his sleep was so\nlight that he constantly woke. This habit of waking whenever\nhe is addressed has for some time been a serious difficulty in\nthe way of testing Joe's powers. Professor Bjarnason ascribes\nit chiefly to the fact that Joe suffers much from rheumatism,\nwhich makes him restless at night.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apk.-Mat, 1915.\nOn the second night Joe slept more deeply and it was possible\nto question him, but the answers he gave were vague and\nshowed no connexion with the subject of the experiment.\nTowards the end of the night he had a dream about a town.\nBut his description of it, though not wholly incorrect as applied\nto Reykjavik, was not sufficiently accurate to be evidential.\nThe third experiment on July 29, 1914, was also unsuccessful.\nH. DE G. v.]\nBefore parting from Joe, I asked him to try to dream about\ndifferent things, but especially about a gold brooch which my\nwife had lost some months before, and no one knew what had\nbecome of it. I also asked him to try whether he could not\n\" appear \" to me either asleep or awake. Up to the present\ntime this has been quite without any result. And Joe writes\nto me in a letter dated September 24, 1914 :\n\" I have been very unsuccessful with those dreams. I have done\nwhat is in my power to try to dream something of significance,\nbut without success. For this I blame the rheumatism which is\njust going to do away with me in the night, so that I can\nhardly ever get a good sound sleep. While this is the case, there\nis not mucli to expect from my dreams.\"\nTaking everything into consideration, my impression of\nDreaming Joe is this : For many years, especially between\n20 and 30 years of age, he has been gifted with travelling\nclairvoyance in a high degree, but since his marriage this has\ngone on decreasing, and at present it is impossible to affirm\nwhether it still exists or not. Still this gift seems to have\ndistinctly revealed itself as late as in the autumn of 1913, and\nperhaps it may yet manifest itself.\n[To he concluded.^\nNOTICE.\nAn Associate of the Society wishes to dispose of some books\nbearing on Psychical Research, including a complete set of the\nSociety's Journal.

June,\nAN ICELANDIC SEER.\nFURTHER COMMEXTS ON PROFESSOR BJARNASON'S REPORT;\nBy Helen de Gr. Verrall.\n{Continued from the jmceding nnmher of the Journal.)\nProfessor Bjarnason concludes his report on Dreaming Joe\nby expressing tlie opinion that \" for many years, especially\nbetween 20 and 30 years of age, he has been gifted with travel-\nling clairvoyance in a high degree.\" Now Professor Bjarnason\nhas the advantage of a first-hand acquaintance with the case, he\nhas visited most of the places to which his report refers and has\ncross-examined many of the witnesses. His opinion therefore\nmust carry considerable weight. Nevertheless it may be doubted\nwjiether, as the case now stands, the evidence will support -his\nconclusion, for the absence of contemporary records makes it\nimpossible to obtain such detailed knowledge of the circum-\nstances as might have excluded other hypotheses. Clairvoyance,\nor telaesthesia, is \" a perception of concealed material objects or\ndistant scenes,\" to be distinguished from telepathy, \" a per-\nception of or communion with the thoughts and emotions of\nother minds.\" It is clear that great precision of evidence will\nbe needed before we can determine whether a phenomenon\nshould be ascribed to telaesthesia rather than telepathy, to say\nnothing of other possible contributory caiises, such as sub-\nconscious observation and memory.\nIn order to show how these difficulties apply to the present\ncase, it is worth while to consider a few of the stories in\ndetail, especially the story of \" The Missing Purse at Thorshofn\n\"\n(see Journal, April-May, 1915, p. 73). which is much more\nrecent than any other recorded instance of success on the part\nof Dreaming''Joe.\nIn the first place, it will be apparent that the story depends\nfor its interest entirely on Joe's good faith. There is evidence\nto show that he did not take the purse himself or actually\nsee it taken, because he was absent from the farm at the time\nof the theft. But there is nothing but his own word to prove\n\f1915. An Icelandic See): 79\nthat he did not hnd the purse by some normal means, since\nhe \" took no witnesses with him when he was looking for the\npurse.\" Professor Bjarnason has expressed his strong con-\nviction of Joe s complete honesty and trustworthiness, a con-\nviction which appears to be shared by all those who have come\ninto contact with him, and is borne out by all the evidence\nwhich Professor Bjarnason has been able to collect. I think,\ntherefore, that we may with some confidence dismiss the\nhypothesis of conscious and deliberate fraud, and we may\nassume that in the main Joe's account of his experience in this\ncase is correct, namely that he had some dream-impression in\nregard to the whereabouts of the lost purse, and having made\nsearch in accordance with this impression, eventually found the\npurse in a position corresponding more or less closely with his\ndream. The question remains\u2014how far do these facts make it\nnecessary to assume some abnormal power on the part of the\ndreamer ? It is hardly possible to give a complete and definite\nanswer to this question on the available evidence. We are\nnot told at all precisely the relative positions of the place from\nwhich the purse was stolen and the place at which it was\nfound, but it may be that Joe s knowledge of the topography of\nthe farm and of the habits of those who frequented it might\nlead him to conclude, either consciously or subconsciously, that\nthe purse was likely to be hidden near the ice-depot. Then,\nagain, it should be noted that he did not at once dream of\nthe purse in the right place. He dreamt that it was \" in a\npile of clods under the western wall of the so-called '\nice-\ndepot,' \" and having ascertamed next day that the purse was\nnot under the clods, he thereby narrowed the field of search.\nIf it is true that he described the purse accm^ately, never\nhaving seen it before, the evidence for powers of a clairvoyant\nor telepathic nature is strengthened. But no details of this\nincident are given, nor any proof that he may not have seen\nthe purse at some time. It should be noted that on an earlier\noccasion, when he was asked to find a lost purse, Joe objected\nthat he did not know what the purse looked like, and a\ndescription of it was therefore given him. (See Journal, April-\nMay, 1915, p. 64.)\nIn several other stories also there are points in the evidence\nwhich suggest that subconscious observation and memory may\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June,\nhave contributed to the result. The case of Little Vigfus's\nPurse may be quoted as an example. (See Journal, April-May,\n1915, p. 63.) In the first place, it is impossible to be certain\nthat Joe had not seen the purse lying behind the stove in the\nnorth-room in a normal way, although very probably the\nincident had made no impression on his conscious mind ; in\nthe second place, it will be noted that in his description of\nthe place where the money would be found, Joe said that a\nbit of the rag containing it \" might be seen sticking out of\nthe hole.\" Mrs. Gudrun says that this description was correct,\nbecause, on making a careful search, she saw the rag sticking\nout. But the objection at once occurs that what was visible\nto Mrs. Gudrun was visible to others, and what certainty have\nwe that Joe had not noticed the rag himself and inferred sub-\nconsciously that something had been concealed in the wall ?\nSuch an explanation may not appear probable, but these flaws\nin the evidence must be entirely removed (in a way that it is\nnot now possible to remove them) before we can admit that\nthe case affords a proof, or even a strong probability, for the\nhypothesis of clairvoyance.\nThe story affording the strongest prima facie support for this\nhypothesis is that of The Needlecase (see Journal, April-May,\n1915, p. 67), but the evidence would be much strengthened by\nobtaining the testimony of the servant who is said to have\nquestioned Joe. It is to be hoped that this may yet be\ndone.\nIn addition to the fact that the evidence in favour of clair-\nvoyance is inconclusive, there is a certain amount of negative\nevidence against it. Allusion has already been made to the\nfailure of the experiment in 1903. (See Journal, April-May,\n1915, p. 75.) Moreover, amongst the incidents which have been\nomitted from the published report there are three cases in\nwhich Joe was asked to find dead bodies, the position of which\nwas not known to any living person, but in each case he failed.\nSuch cases are especially favourable for obtaining proof of\nclairvoyance, since telepathy from any living mind is ex hypothesi\nexcluded. The fact that in each of these three instances Joe\nfailed to locate the body is evidence, so far as it goes, against\nhis possessing clairvoyant powers. A brief report of one of\nthese incidents is printed below as a specimen\n:\n\f1915. An Icelandic Seer. 81\nThe Shepherd's Body.\n{Statement by Gudm. Vilhjdhnsson, farmer at Sydra-Ldn.)\nJuly 24, 1914.\nOne Sunday in the spring of 1897 we had an awful northerly\nsnowstorm. In the morning the shepherd at Eldjarnsstadir started\noff for the sheep-cot, at some distance from the farm-house, at the\nusual time in the morning, but he did not return in the evening.\nAt about noon the next day the storm abated, and men from\nthe neighbouring farms went to search for him. The search was\ncontinued for several days without success. Then Joe was asked\nto try to dream where the man was. He said that he saw the\nman, and he was buried under a thick heap of snow beside a\nbig hill in the land of Hvammsstadir, which is about an hour's\nwalk to the south of Eldjarnsstadir. Joe said, moreover, that he\nhad been alive in the snow for three days. People thought Joe's\naccount very probable, but as there is in this place which Joe described\nsuch a great number of hills all resembling each other, it is only\npossible for those who are thoroughly acquainted with the place\nto discern them from each other. Therefore no attempts were made\nto dig for the body, and the search was given up for the time.\nAbout a month or so later a shepherd from Eldjarnsstadir came\nupon the corpse lying on a level field about half an hour's walk\nto the eaut of Eldjarnsstadir. Thus all that Joe had said about this\nproved sheer nonsense.\nGudm. Vilhjalmsson.\nConclusion.\nMy own impression, after reading the whole of Professor\nBjarnason's clear and careful record,^ is that we have in\nDreaming Joe a genuine case of sensory automatism, spon-\ntaneous in its origin and taking the form of visions seen in\nsleep, or in a condition between sleeping and waking. These\nvisions can be influenced by the waking volition of the dreamer\nor by questions put to him in sleep. There is little doubt, I\nthink, that in these circumstances knowledge is displayed\nwhich the dreamer does not consciously possess, and as regards\nthe source of this knowledge, an explanation may perhaps\nbe found in sub-conscious observation and memory, or in\n^ About a third of the report has been printed here, the remaining stories\nbeing of the same general type.\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

In some cases the evidence suggests\npowers of a clairvoyant kind, but owing to lapse of time\nthe records are not sufficiently precise or detailed to support\nany certain conclusion on this point.

HYSLOP ON THE HISTORY OF MARTHE BERAUD.\nBy H. de G. Verrall. . ..\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for\nJanuary, 1915, contains a criticism by Dr. Hyslop of my\narticle on The History of Marthe Beraud, published in Proc.\nS.P.R., Vol. XXVII., p. 333 ff. On several points I am glad\nto find that Dr. Hyslop and I are in agreement, but he puts\nforward two objections which I will try to answer.\n[a] Dr. Hyslop complains that in considering the hypothesis\nof fraud I make no attempt to determine the fundamental\nquestion of whether the medium is hysterical. According to his\nopinion, we have no right to use the word \"fraud\" in a case\nof hysteria. \" Fraud,\" he says, \"is a state of mind. It is not\na mode of action. Fraud is a conscious attempt to deceive and\nassumes normal mental conditions.\"\nWhen Dr. Hyslop says that fraud is conscious, he means\npresumably that it is \" potentially memorable,\" according to\nthe definition given by Mr. Myers in Human Personality, and,\ntherefore, that before imputing fraud we nmst ascertain that\nthere is no dissociation of consciousness. This proposition will be\ngenerally admitted, if our object be to make a psychological\nanalysis of the medium's condition, or to estimate her moral\nresponsibility for her actions. But Dr. Hyslop does not appear\nto take into account the fact that in writing the history of\nMarthe Beraud I was primarily concerned to determine the\nobjective physical nature of certain observed phenomena, rather\nthan to discuss the psychological peculiarities of the medium\nin whose presence they occm\". The question which I tried to\nanswer was not so much, \" What is Marthe Beraud's state of\nmind when these phenomena occur ?\n\" as \"In what do the\n\f1915. Dr. Hyslop on the History of Marthe Beraud. 83\nphenomena themselves consist ? What actually happens ?\n\"\nIt seems to me that we are not likely to give a clear answer\nto either of these questions, unless we recognise that they are\ndistinct one from another.\nWe recognise the distinction clearly enough in other fields of\nenquiry. Suppose, for example, that a solicitor appropriates to\nhis own use the securities entrusted to him, his clients will\nassuredly accuse him of fraud, and he cannot escape the charge\nby declaring that he suffered from a dissociation of consciousness\nand thought the securities were his own. The question of\nwhether he is responsible for his actions has nothing whatever\nto do with the loss to his clients, although it may affect our\nmoral judgement of the man himself. Similarly in the case of\nMarthe Beraud, we have first to consider whether there is any-\nthing deceptive about her phenomena, before considering the\nmental or moral part which she plays in their production.\nNow, various observers of these phenomena have put forward\nthe theory that in order to explain them we must have recourse\nto an unknown physical law, such, for instance, as Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing's theory of \" ideoplasma,\" and, taken at their\nface value, the phenomena do appear to require some hypothesis\nof this kind. My main endeavour therefore was to analyse the\nevidence for and against this hypothesis\u2014the evidence, in fact,\nfor and against the hypothesis of a supernormal agency in the\ncase.\nI will not quarrel with Dr. Hyslop over the use of a particular\nword, but if the actual character of a phenomenon is concealed\nso skilfully, and the appearance of another character is given\nso exactly, as to suggest, almost beyond doubt, that these two\ncircumstances are purposive, we are justified, I think, in saying\nthat there is simulation, just as we speak of simulation in the\ncase of the protective colouring of certain insects, without imply-\ning any inoral judgment. In the case of Marthe Beraud, as I\nsaid in my report, there seems evidence that the simulation, if\nnot conscious, is sometimes deliberate, in the sense that pre-\nparations are made beforehand with a view to producing a\ndesired effect.\nBriefly, I think that Dr. Hyslop confuses the issue by throwing\nso much emphasis on the psychological aspect of the problem.\nI maintain that in such cases it is legitimate, and indeed neces-\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1915.\nsary, before we turn to questions of psychology, to determine,\nif we can, the objective physical nature of the phenomena\nconcerned.\n{b) The second criticism which Dr. Hyslop puts forward is\nthat whereas I reject Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's theory of\n\" ideoplasma,'\" I suggest that the medium may have some\nabnormal power of bodily secretion. \" Now I should like to\nknow,\" he says, \" what difference one can conceive, or is\nobliged to set up, between '\nideoplasty ' and an '\nabnormal\npower of bodily secretion.'\n\"\nAdmitting that one is not \" obliged to set up \" any difference\nbetween ideoplasty and bodily secretion, since Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing's ideoplastic creations are ex hypothesi secreted from the\nmedium's body, I yet maintain that between Dr. von Schrenck-\nNotzing's theory and mine there is a marked difference of\ndegree, if not of kind. For Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing suggests,\ne.g., that by some process of thought the medium is able to\ncreate from her body a material object having the appearance\nof a patched and torn, but recognisable portrait taken from an\nillustrated paper (see Proc, Vol. XXVII., p. 362 ff.). But\nthe processes of bodily secretion, as we know them, present no\nphenomenon in the least analogous to this. When I suggested\nthat the medium might possess some abnormal power of secre-\ntion, I had in view secretions analogous to those which exist\nin normal cases, but presenting some unusual feature. I\nreferred, as an instance of my meaning, to Dr. Kafka's report,\nin which he suggests that a liquid secretion of some kind issued\nfrom the medium's breasts. We know that even in normal\ncases secreta of various kinds, e.g. the sweat, may be induced\nor modified by suggestion, and the theory which I tentatively\nput forward was that in Marthe Beraud\u2014an abnormal case\n\u2014\nthe secreta have been modified or increased in various ways to\na very unusual degree. I should, on this hypothesis, accept\nDr. Hyslop's statement as to \" the ideas, conscious or uncon-\nscious, of the medium being presumably active in causing the\nsecretion of the substance necessary to simulate materialisation,\"\nbut I should modify this statement by suggesting that this\nprocess of simulation (it will be noted that Dr. Hyslop himself\nadmits the term here) is frequently assisted by methods in\nwhich bodily secretions play no part.\n\fNo. CCCXXI.\u2014Vol. XVII.

I have leave from Mr. and Mrs. [Jackson] to send it\nyou, on condition that, if published, names of places and people\nshould be altered, and that they should not be \" worried.\" They\nare naturally anxious, and so am I, that their little daughter\n[Beatrice] should forget all about it as soon as possible. . . .\n[Beatrice] is a very nice little girl, and they naturally want to\ncheck this development, due to her state of health, as speedily as\npossible. When I left on April 10 nothing further had happened.\nThe account enclosed is as follows :\nMarch 19, 1915.\nOn Monday, March 8, 1915, in the afternoon, Mrs. W. Jackson\ncalled on us with her two children, Beatrice, aged fourteen, and\nMarie, aged about five, to tell us of a remarkable noise which had\nsuddenly begun to make itself heard in their house in the evening,\nfor the first time on the previous Saturdg-y, March 6. She\ndescribed it as a sort of loud and rather prolonged grunt, some-\nthing like the noise that might be made by a pig or some other\nanimal if it wasn't feeling quite well, and it sounded apparently\nall over the house in various rooms, upstairs and down, and on\nthe stairs, etc. It had occurred again on Sunday evening. They\nwere all very puzzled and beginning to be even a little alarmed,\nand their servant was already distinctly frightened by the mysterious\nsound. Would we come over this evening and see if we could hear\nit and could suggest an explanation.\nWe agreed to go over about nine o'clock, but as we were sitting\nat dinner soon after eight, we got a message from Mrs. Jackson\nto the effect that the noise had started again about half-past\nsix and had been going on at intervals ever since, and would\nwe come at once, if we could, as it might stop later on. So we\nfinished our dinner hurriedly and answered the summons. For\nabout a quarter of an hour after we got to the house we heard\nnothing. Mrs. Jackson and my husband and myself were all\ngathered together in the drawing-room, with the doors open, and\nBeatrice was hovering about near us, sometimes in the room\nwith us and sometimes outside. As the noise had now apparently\nceased downstairs, Mrs. Jackson and I went to the landing\n\fJuly, 1915. A Poltergeist Case. 87\nupstairs, leaving my liusbaud to smoke and listen in the drawing-\nroom. We stood about for some minutes listening, all in vain ;\nwlien suddenly came a hail from my husband below\n\u2014\" Theit it is.\nI heard it then ; did you hear it ?\n\"\u2014\" No, where was it ?\n\"\nHe indicated the direction of the sound (I forget exactly where he\nsaid it seemed to come from), and said he had been standing\nalone in the doorway between the dining-room and drawing-room\nwhen he heard it.\nIn a few minutes it occurred again, and that time we all heard\nit. Mrs. Jackson and I were still standing on the landing upstairs,\nand the sound seemed to come from the passage below. It was\nquite loud and immistakable. Beatrice was at that time some-\nwhere downstairs. Soon we heard the sound again, twice, and\nthen it seemed to me to issue from a bedroom behind us, in\nwhich little Marie lay in her cot, listening also for the sound and\nevidently rather excited, but apparently not alarmed. She also\nheard it, and said it seemed to her also to be in her room, but\nher mother said it sounded to her as if it came from upstairs,\njust outside the child's open bedroom door.\nI forget how many times we heard it that evening\u2014a good\nmany times altogether, and every time it was exceedingly difficult\nto locate the sound. Beatrice was never in sight when we heard\nit, though she flitted about downstairs and up at intervals, or\ncalled up to us, or down to us, to ask us if we had heard it.\nEven after she had gone upstairs to her bath, and when we were\ndownstairs, we heard it once or twice.\nBy this time Mr. Jackson had come in and corroborated all his\nwife had told us.\nWe suggested all the possibilities we could think of: (1) escaping\nair from some old gas pipe (it is an old house, which has been\nmuch altered at various times) ; (2) water in a waste-pipe ; (3)\npractical joking by the servant ; (4) a noise made by their next-\ndoor neighbours. As to (1), they did not think it likely, but\nadmitted that the sounds never came till after the gas was lighted,\nso they eventually agreed to test that question the next night by\nnot lighting the gas. As to (2), there appeared to be no con\nnection with any water arrangements, as the sounds seemed to go\non quite independently of the use of the bathroom or other pipes.\nBut the bath-water is heated by a geyser, so they would test\nthat too the next night by not heating the water for the bath.\nAs to (3), they had had the servant for 2| years and nothing\n\f8S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1915.\nhad ever happened before, and she was obviously frightened and\ninclined to attribute the noise to some supernatural agency\n\u2014\nasking Beatrice, for instance, whether her grandmother was quite\nwell, and thus hinting at a possible explanation of the sound.\nAs to (4), the walls of the house were thick, and they never\nheard any sound at all from their neighbours.\nAfter Beatrice had gone upstairs to bed, we asked Mr. and\nMrs. Jackson to tell us when and where they had first heard the\nsound. They agreed that it was on Saturday evening when they\nwere sitting in the drawing-room and Beatrice was in the passage\njust outside, with the door half-open between them. Suddenly\nthe sound occurred, and Beatrice exclaimed in a startled voice,\n\" Mummy, did you hear that ? What is it ?\n\" \" Wnj, yes. You\ndid it yoiu'self, Beattie,\" they both replied. No, I didn't,\nreally. I don't know what it was.\" That was the beginning,\nand both evidently thought that the sound proceeded from Beatrice,\nbut were afterwards shaken in their conviction by the child's\ndenials, and by the odd way in which the sound seemed to\ntravel all over the house. Mr. Jackson, however, said that for some\ntime at first he thought it was Beatrice playing a practical joke,\nbut he had given up that theory now. Both were evidently\nutterly puzzled, and Mrs. Jackson was perturbed both for the\nsake of the children and for the effect on the servant, who was\nalready frightened and would be sure to give notice presently if\nthe noise went on. Another woman who was in the house as\ncharwoman was also alarmed.\nWe could do no more that night, so we went home, after\nhaving urged them to try the effect of doing without the gas and\nbath-water the next night. Mrs. Jackson, by the way, had\nadmitted earlier in the evening that the noise was beginning to\nget on her nerves, too, a little, because she thought now that it\nsounded \" human,\" not like an animal, or a noise made by a gas\nor water-pipe. Secretly we agreed with her, but we did not say\nso. On the way home we agreed that Beatrice must be at the\nbottom of the trouble, and suggested that it might be a hysterical\nmanifestation of some sort, knowing that such things were possible,\nand also that Beatrice has been lately in a highly nervous state\nof health, and has been in medical hands for it. We agreed\nfurther that we would not propound this theory at present to any\none else, but would await events and the result of experiments\nwith the gas and water, etc. I said that if it really was Beatrice,\n\fULT, 1915. A Poltergeist Case. 89\npresently there would most likely occur further, and possibly\ndifferent, manifestations.\nI forgot to add above that we, of course, asked both Mr. and\nMrs. Jackson if it was possible that the noise came from outside\nanywhere, or could be caused by rats or mice. They said they\nhad searched outside the first night and found nothing, that they\nwere not troubled by rats or mice, and that in any case the\nsound, whatever it was, was inside the house. Of that they were\nsure, and for that matter, so were we.\nThe next day, Tuesday, March 9, we heard nothing, and purposely\ndid not go down to inquire, because we thought, if it were Beatrice's\ndoing, it was better not to show too much excitement about it.\nOn Wednesday morning (10th) I called to try and find Mrs.\nJackson at a time when I thought Beatrice would probably be\nout, but I found no one at home, except the servant, of whom\nI asked no questions. That afternoon, when I was out for a\nwalk with a friend . . . who had arrived at tea-time to stay with\nus, we met Mr. Jackson, and asked him for news. He said they\nhad tried experimenting the night before with both gas and water,\nand the noise had gone on just the same, and they were as far\nfrom an explanation of it as ever. He added that they had\nasked Mr. Shaw, the science master here, to come down after nine\no'clock this (Wednesday) evening to see if he could throw any\nlight on the subject. I took the opportunity of suggesting,\n\" Ask Dr. B ;\nperhaps he could help,\" and Mr. Jackson went\noff saying, yes, it might be a good thing to do so. I knew that\nDr. B had been attending Beatrice lately. I also sent a\nmessage to Mrs. Jackson by her husband to the effect that I would\ntake her and the two little girls in to sleep in our house for a\nfew nights, if she liked to let me know in good time the next day.\nThursday passed (the 11th), and Mrs. Jackson sent no message,\nso I concluded she did not want to come, and that perhaps Mr.\nShaw had suggested some solution. We heard nothing more that\nday, but on Friday afternoon (the 12th) Mrs. Jackson again\ncalled on us at tea-time, this time alone. Mrs. Jackson had\ntea with us, and said she had come again about the noises,\nbecause she was now getting seriously perturbed. Mr. Shaw had\nspent part of Wednesday evening with them and had heard the\nnoises, and suggested that they might be due to a waste-pipe,\nand asked them to get the plumber to come in and make some\nalteration to the \" trap \" arrangements of the pipe. So they called\n\f00 Journal of Society for Psychieat Research. July, I9i5.\nin Harding, who refused to alter the pipe, saying it was perfectly\nall right, and that if he made the desired alteration it would\nonly make the pipe dangerous and let sewer-gas into the house.\nAVliile he was in the house he heard the noise, and thought it\nproceeded from Marie, Mrs. Jackson's little girl, and said so.\nMrs. Jackson said no. she was sure it was not, and Harding\nstayed for some time on the stairs, listening for the noise again.\nI cannot remember whether Mrs. Jackson said he did hear it again\nor not, but she went on to say that she and Mr. Jackson were\nnow coming to the conclusion that the noises had somethins; to\ndo with Beatrice. We asked why, and she told us that not only\nwere the old noises continuing, but there were fresh developments.\nAfter Beatrice had gone to bed on Thursday night, her mother\nran upstairs to look at her in bed and see that she was sleeping\nquietly, as she often does. She foimd her apparently asleep, but\nrestless. Suddenly, as she stood looking down at her, a clicking\nsound, like that made by a person snapping his fingers, appeared\nto come from the bedstead. At first Mrs. Jackson though-: she\nmust be imagining it, but it occurred again, and she put her\nhands on the bedstead and felt it vibrating. vShe sat down for\nsome time by the bed determined to wait and watch, and make\nsure about it. The noise occurred again, Beatrice apparently\nasleep and motionless, and she again felt the bedstead vibrating\nand heard it clicking, even while she held one of Beatrice's hands\nin her own. Then she knocked on the floor as a signal to Mr.\nJackson, and he came up and heard the sound and felt the bed\nvibrating too. They roused Beatrice with some difficulty out of\nan apparently heavy sleep, and after she woke up she, too heard\nthe sound and asked them if they heard it.\nBesides this bed-clicking noise, Mrs. Jackson said they had\nheard at least once (I am not sure if she said oftener) a loud\nknocking noise, and she rapped hard four times on the table to\nshow us what it was like. Also the same evening, after Beatrice\nwas in bed, they had heard a loud noise, I think she said\ntwice, like some one hitting the partition wall on the stairs very\nhard with the open hand. The servant was by this time so\nterrified that she would not sleep alone, and Beatrice had had\nat first to sleep with her, and now the servant was sleeping out,\nhaving refused to sleep in the house any longer. The noises were\ngetting on all their nerves, and Mrs Jackson said she was getting\nvery worried about it, and did not know what to do for the best.\n\fJuly, 1915. A Poltergeist Case. 91\nNow, at last, as she had said herself that the sounds appeared\nto be connected with Beatrice. I told her something of what I\nhave read of such occurrences and urged her to tell Dr. B\nabout it, because if it was Beatrice doing it, it was due to her\nstate of health and ought to be checked at once. It was quite\na new idea to her that a child, or any person, could do such\nthings and be apparently unaware that she was doing them, and\nshe promised to see Dr. B and get him to come round that\nnight to their house. It was too late, we agreed, for her to\nbring the children to us that evening, and I also wanted her\nto consult Dr. B fii'st and see if he thought it wise, so I\nsaid I would take them in on Saturday for the week-end, or a\nfew days, if necessary, and she went away.\nOn Saturday, the 13th, I went soon after breakfast to see\nMrs. Jackson and to ask her if they wanted to come. She told\nme she was in a state of great indecision as to what she ought\nto do ; that Dr. B had been to their house on Friday night\nfor a short time, but had heard no noises, and had promised to\nreturn later, but had not done so ; so she concluded he had been\nprevented. He agreed that Beatrice might be causing the sounds,\nand said that if it turned out to be so, it would be a good\nthing to take her up to London to see a specialist. In the\nmean time he saw no objection to their all coming over to stay\nwith me. So I said I would go and get ready for them, and\nasked what I should tell our servants to explain their sudden\narrival. This led to a further discussion of all the little difficulties\nof the situation, and eventually Mrs. Jackson decided that it would\nbe better to take the children away somewhere out of the place,\nand we thought of . That seemed a good idea, and she said\nshe would go that afternoon and see if Mrs. W could take\nthem in. In the course of this conversation Mrs. Jackson said,\n\" I don't know if I was wise, but I told Beatrice that I thought\nshe was making these noises herself.\" Beatrice said, \" How could\nI, Mother ?\n\" and Mrs. Jackson explained that it is possible for\npeople to make such noises and not know that they did it, which\napparently surprised Beatrice.\nAfter this we heard no more till Monday, the 15th, when I\nmet Beatrice in the street, and she told me that they were all\nthree going to that afternoon for a week. I congratulated her,\nand said it would be nice, and sent my love to her mother and said\nno more, and Beatrice did not volunteer a word about the noises.\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1915.\nOn Monday night, after they had gone, Ernest (my husband)\nand Mr. Lambert went down to see Mr. Jackson and to inquire\nhow things were going on. The house was perfectly quiet, but\nMr. Jackson said it had been so since Saturday. The noises had\nceased on Saturday and had not recurred. On Saturday evening\nhe and Mrs. Jackson had kept Beatrice with them all the time\ntill she went to bed, and nothing had happened, and when she\nwas sent up to bed, Mrs. Jackson had said, \" Now, Beattie\u2014no\nnoises, mind !\n\" and there had not been any.\nMr. Jackson also described to Ernest and Mr. Lambert the\nloud noises and raps they had heard, and gave them a fuller\ndescription of what happened about the bed-clicking. He said\nthat he felt the vibration of the bed very distinctly even when\nhe lifted it up in his hands off its two end-feet. After they\nroused Beatrice they moved her into another bed in her mother's\nroom, and when she was asleep again that bed started the same\nclicking and vibrating. Mr. Jackson himself took the original\nbed to pieces to see if he could find any screw or wire loose\nanywhere, then, finding it all right, put it together again and\nslept in the bed himself, and it was quite quiet.\nI forgot to add that, when I was talking to Mrs. Jackson on\nSaturday morning, she described how she had sent Beatrice and\nthe maid to do the bedrooms together, because the maid was\nafraid to go alone, and that Beatrice also helped her in the\nkitchen for the same reason. After both had been upstairs\ntogether for a while, both declared that when they came back\nto the kitchen they found all the cupboard doors open which\nthey had left shut when they went ripstairs. Mrs. Jackson said\nthey must have left them open, but they declared they did not.\nThis, I think, happened on Friday evening, or it might have been\nThursday. It was not later.\nOn Tuesday, the 16th, we heard no more, but on Wednesday,\nthe 17th, I met Mrs. Jackson at S station, and she said all\nhad been quiet at and there had been no disturbance of\nany kind.\nOne more thing I forgot to add. I asked Mrs. Jackson again if\nshe were quite sure the noises could not have been made by the\nservant or by the charwoman, and she disposed of that by saying\nthat they had occurred when they were out of the house, as well as\nwhen they were in it.\n[Signed] M. Hazell.\n\fJuly, 191:3. A Polierf\/cist Case. 93\nTo this account Mr. Ernest Hazell added the following note :\nMarch 19, 1915.\nThis is perfectly acctirate as far as I Imow. It omits, however,\none curious fact told to me by Mr. Jackson. When Beatrice\nwas sleeping on a bed in her mother's room, that bed also began\nto produce the clicking sound. When Mr. Jackson first entered\nthe room the sound was apparently coming from the head of the\nbed. When he moved there, the sound also moved and seemed\nto come from the foot of the bed. He then moved there, when\nthe sound at once came only from the head of the bed. I think\nhe tested this two or three times, the residt always being the\nsame, i.e. the sound always came from that part of the bed\nfrom which he was furthest ofi'.\n[Signed] E. Hazell.\nThe child's father and Mr. Lambert also endorse Mrs. Hazell's\naccount as follows :\nMay 11, 1915.\nThis is an accurate account of what Mr. Jackson told me when\nI went to see him with Mr. Hazell.\n[Signed] J. J. Lambert\nMay 24, 1915.\nFound quite correct in every way.\n[Signed] W. K. Jackson.\nMr. T. A. Shaw makes the following statement, written on\nMay 24, 1915, as to the noises in Mr. Jackson's house :\nPresent in house, Wednesday, March [10th], 9.30 p.m.-ll p.m.\n9.30-10 p.m., in drawing-room with doors open. Heard unusual\nnoise twice, best described as a sort of grunt. As the sound came\nthrough open door, it was difficult to locate exactly.\n10-10.30 p.m. Stood upstairs at junction of two passages ; heard\nsimilar noise again ; this proceeded from passage at end of which\nwas bedroom occupied by the child Beatrice Jackson, the door\nbeing open. Lnmediately the sound ceased, the child half wakened\nup, but was pacified by mother.\n10.30-11, in drawing-room ; heard similar sound again, not so\nviolent and very difiicult to locate.\nCarefully examined water-pipes, gas-meter, drain-pipes, etc.,\nand came to conclusion that it was impossible for sound to have\nproceeded from them.\n\f94 Journal of Society for Pffychical ResearcJi. July, 1915.\nMrs. T. A. Shaw writes :\nMay 25, 1915.\nI went to Mrs. Jackson's at 8.30 the same evening as my husband,\nand heard the noises three times before he came. One of these\ntimes it was most distinct and prolonged, and seemed to be just\noutside the drawing-room door. Beatrice was upstairs, quite away\nfrom us, but she called down, \" Did you hear that. Mother ?\n\"\nIt was so loud and certainly sounded in a different part of the\nhouse from where she was. The other two were fainter, but\ndistinct, but Beatrice was downstairs then and nearer to where\nwe heard them.\nAnd later :\nMay 26, 1915.\nI forgot to add that I stayed on at Mrs. Jackson's after my\nhusband came, and agree with all he has said.\nMrs. Jackson has kindly added the following statement\n:\nMay 25, 1915.\nMrs. Hazell's account of what happened in our house and what\nI told her is quite correct.\nIt has occurred to me that possibly a few remarks about the child\nherself might help towards an explanation of things.\nI should like to state that neither my husband nor myself\nconnected the noises with B. up to the very last night, and\nto this day we have no definite proof of her having caused them.\nI still find it difficult to believe that she could have made those\nweird sounds ; indeed, but for what occurred on the last night,\nI think I should refuse to connect her with them.\nMrs. Hazell has related how, on that night, I roused B. and\nsent her to my room, because her bed seemed to be ticking in\na strange way and I wanted to try and find out what caused\nthis. I was just outside my room when I heard a loud, distinct\nthumping on the wall (it is made of canvas and laths just there).\nI went straight into the room, to find B. apparently fast asleep.\nWhen roused, she denied having made the noise, but said she had\nheard it. I mention this in detail again, because it was the\nfirst intimation we had that the child was, subconsciously, \" play-\ning tricks \" on us. There was no possibility of any other person\nor thing having caused this noise, only my husband and self and\nthe two children being in the house at the time From that\nmoment we realised that B.'s nervous system must be seriously\n\fJOLY, 1915. A Poltergeist Case. 95\nafiected, and tliat it was possible that she might have been at\nthe bottom of everything. Nothing further happened, and there\nthe matter rests.\nI may add that B. is a lively girl, normal in every way, and of\naverage intelligence, though not gifted. For the last two years\nshe has not been able to bear any mental strain, and was obliged\nto leave school last November owing to a complete nervous break-\ndown, accompanied by nightmares of a violent character. Her\ngeneral health, however, soon improved at home and, except for\nthese occurrences in March, she seemed in normal health.\nGebtbude Jackson.\nALLEGED VISIONS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.\nA LARGE number of enquiries have reached us as to the\nauthenticity of the alleged visions of angels, etc., seen on the\nbattlefields in France, and in many cases the enquirers have\nsent us copies of accounts that have appeared in a number of\nnewspapers, parish magazines, etc.\nPractically all these accounts are identical, beginning \" Last\nSunday I met Miss M., daughter of the well-known Canon M.,\nand she told me she knew two officers, both of whom had\nthemselves seen the angels. ...\"\nOn first receiving the account, we wrote to Miss M., asking if\nshe could put us into communication with these officers. She\nreplied, \" I cannot give you the names of the men referred to\nin your letter of May 26 [1915], as the story I heard was quite\nanonymous and I do not know who they were.\"\nIt thus appears that the account was repeated and circulated\non purely hearsay evidence ; and there is reason for believing\nthat it was founded on the story of visionary archers led by\nSt. George, which was invented by a journalist, Mr. Arthur\nMachen, and published in the Evening News.\nIf, however, any of our readers can obtain first-hand accounts\nfrom the witnesses of any actual apparitions, we should be very\nglad to receive them.\nCONTRIBUTION TO THE LIBRARY OF THE SOCIETY.\nWe are greatly indebted to Mr. H.

A. Frostick, of Christchurch, New\nZealand, an Associate of this Society, an interesting account\nof a bhnd dog which is said to answer questions intelKgently\nby barking. The feats of this dog recall those of the \" think-\ning horses \" of Elberfeld (one of which, it will be remembered,\nwas also blind), and of the \" thinking dog \" of Mannheim.\nIt will be seen that in the case here reported, the evidence is\nopen to the same objections as were raised in the earlier cases :\nthe animal usually gives his answer to a question by repeating\nsome simple action, such as stamping the foot or barking a\ncertain number of times. If, therefore, we could suppose\nthat a signal were given him when he should stop, no remark-\nable degree of intelligence would be required for his perfor-\nmance, but only keen powers of observation. We need not\nbring the bona fides of the experimenters in question by\nsupposing that the signal is given consciously, since there\nis abundant evidence\u2014for example, in muscle-reading experi-\nments\u2014that slight indications unconsciously given can be\nreadily perceived.\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct.-Kov.\nIn the case of the Elberfeld horses, it was said that the\nanimals could answer questions the nature of which was\nnot known to any person present. That is not alleged in\nthe present case; in fact, there is evidence to the contrary.\nAs the case stands at present, therefore, the dog's performance\ncan be explained by supposing that he responds to some\nkind of indication unconsciously given. Since he is blind,\nthis indication is probably auditory\u2014perhaps a slight change\nof breathing\u2014and it may be that the dog's blindness makes\nhis task easier by saving him from visual distractions. We\nhave written to Mr. Frostick suggesting that some further\nexperiments should be tried to test this hypothesis. But\nsince communication with New Zealand is a lengthy process,\nwe have decided to print this preliminary report while awaiting\nfurther developments. In addition to Mr. Frostick's report,\nwe also publish some extracts from an article which appeared\nin a New Zealand paper, The Lyttelton Times, giving an\naccount of a public performance by the dog. It should be\nsaid that his owners have never exhibited him for money\nexcept for a charitable purpose.\nMembers of the Society will recollect that a paper on the\nElberfeld horses was read at a meeting in 1913, and a short\nreport of it was published in the Journal, Vol. XVI., p. 98 If,\nA short account of the Mannheim dog, by Dr. F. C. S.\nSchiller, also appeared in the Journal, Vol. XVI., p. 244 ff.\nAny further investigation into either of these cases is at\npresent precluded by the war. Ed.]\nLetter prom Mr. J. A. Frostick.\nJune 16, 1915.\nAt the request of one of our Members, Mr. Richard Thorp,\nof Napier, N.Z., I herewith send you particulars of the powers\npossessed by a most remarkable dog, owned by Mr. William\nSmith McGibbon, Kilmore St., of this city.\nAccompanied by my daughter, I visited the house of Mr.\nMcGibbon on Saturday evening last, June 12th.\nThe dog is a small black and tan terrier, between five\nand six years old. It was found by its present owner about\nfive years ago in a semi-starved condition and was taken in\n\f1915. A \"Thinking Dog.\" 101\nand cared for. Nothing remarkable was noticed for about\na year, when it gradually went blind, and has been for years\nquite sightless.\nIt always had the habit of begging for food, but after\nit went blind it would bark for a piece\u2014always one bark.\nOne day the owner said, \" Bark twice, Darkey, and you\nshall have two pieces,\" which he immediately did. This was\nconsidered remarkable, because it was repeated on several\noccasions and under different conditions. It was then dis-\ncovered that the dog apparently possessed almost human\nintelligence, answering questions by a succession of short,\nsharp and decisive barks.\nThe dog sits on a chair, is very quiet, and somewhat shy\n\u2014\nsometimes a little difficult to get started with his work,\nespecially when strangers are present. Occasionally he takes\na dislike to individuals, and if so, will not work at all, but\nthis happens very seldom.\nMr. McGibbon finds it best to ask a few questions that\nthe dog has answered before. It appears to get the dog quiet\nand confident\n:\n\" How many feet have you ?\n\" - -\n(4)\n\" How many eyes ?\n\" - - - -\n(2)\n\" How many ears ?\n\" - - - -\n(2)\nAll these he answered without hesitation, but when asked\n\" How many tails ?\n\" he always gives two barks.\nThese and other similar questions were answered instantly\nin my presence :\nDivide 12 by 3 - - - - 4 barks.\nCount 12 - - - - - 12 \u201e\nTake 2 from 12 - - - - 10 \u201e\nDivide 100 by 25 - - - 4 \u201e\nDivide 1000 by 100 - - - 10 \u201e\nHow many sixpences in half a crown ? 5 barks.\nIf you spent one sixpence out of half a crown, how many\nsixpenny pieces would you bring back ? 4 barks.\nHow many roods in one acre ? How many furlongs in\none mile ? How many ounces in one pound avoirdupois ?\nHow many troy ounces ? How many lbs. in one stone ?\nWhat is the day of the month ? What is the month of the\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct. -Nov.\nyear ? What is the year over 1900 ? Every answer was\npromptly and correctly given.\nThen I was permitted to frame the questions :\nHow many letters in Frostick ? 8 barks.\nWhat is the time by Mr. Frostick's watch, nearest hour ?\n9 barks.\nIs the minute hand before 9 or past 9 ? 4 barks.\nHow much past ? 3 barks. This was quite correct. My\nwatch was exactly 9.3. It was not the correct time, my\nwatch being two minutes fast of town time.\nI then asked him, \" What is my age over 50 ?\n\" He gave\n8 barks, which is correct.\nThe next question : If you wrote down one million in\nfigures, how many naughts would you use 1 (6.)\nUp to this point every answer (except as to the number\nof tails) was correct, but at this stage the dog commenced\nto get a little restless and excited, and made quite a number\nof mistakes.\nHow many gas-brackets in the room ? (4.) The number was 3.\nWhat is the age of this lady visitor over 25 ? (3.) It should\nhave been 6.\nHow many coins in my pocket over 18 ? (6.) It should have\nbeen 8.\nHow many buttons on the lady's boots ? (20.) It should\nhave been 22.\nAt this stage it was agreed to give the dog a rest.\nAfter about ten minutes we started again, with most re-\nmarkable results. I took from my pocket a bank-note, which\nMr. McGibbon did not handle, neither could he see the face\nof it :\nDarkey, Mr. Frostick has a bank-note. Whab is it worth\nin pounds sterling ? (1.)\nSpell one. (3.)\nWhat is the number of the note, starting with the unit\nfigures ? The dog gave the barks, 6. 8. 10. 7. 5, which was\nexactly right.\nThe next question was : add 4 to 6 and take off 8. (2.)\nThe next question : Can you tell us how many letters are\nrequired to spell the name of the maker of Mr. Frostick's\nwatch ? (4.) Dent is the maker.\n\f1915. A \" ThinJcing Dog.\" 103\nHow many figures are there on the works of the watch ? (7.)\nThis was not quite correct, but it reads : No. 61152. This\ntotals 7. When asked what are the figures, the dog remained\nperfectly silent. I then opened the works and looked at\nthe number, when the dog at once gave barks in the following\norder, commencing at the unit figure : 6 116 2. He was\nwrong with the second figure, but when I looked at it I\nthought it was 6.\nThis ended my questions.\nThe owner asked the dog a few more usual questions, such\nas Goodbye. (7 barks.) But, says Mr. McGibbon, Good Bye\nis two words ;\nseparate them. (4, long pause, 3.) Good-night\nwas answered in the same way, and this ended the questions.\nMr. McGibbon says if he concentrates his thoughts the\ndog can answer any question, if the answer be known to\nMr. McGibbon.\nMrs. McGibbon, Senr., can also get the dog to work, but\nthey have found that if Mr. McGibbon says, \" Don't answer\nthat question, Darkey,\" no one can get him to do so.\nThe whole exhibition was remarkable, but the most significant\nincident in my opinion was the watch. I knew the maker's\nname was Dent ; I also knew that there were two letters\nand five figures, indicating the maker's number, but I did\nnot know the number. The 4 barks for the name and the\n7 barks for the number were instantly given, but no response\nas to the figures until I opened the case and read them, when\nhe seemed agitated and could scarcely get the barks out\nquickly enough.\nI leave the theory for the Society to explain, but the facts are\nexactly as stated.\nTo show you that public interest is being aroused, I send you\na copy of a local newspaper published last week. . . .\nExtracts from Article in the Lytlelton Times,\nJune 12, 1915.\n. . . Darkie was lifted by his master on to a small table,\nin good view, and petted and soothed away from his natural\nshyness. . . . We were informed by the master that Darkie's\nremarkable gift of intuition or understanding, or whatever it might\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct. -Nov. 1915.\nbe called, was discovered quite by accident in the family to which\nthe little dog belongs ; and that the gift had only been cultivated\nsince that remarkable discovery. Then Darkle was put through\nhis paces. . . . Darkle answers his master's questions by a series of\nshort, sharp barks, very detached and distinct. The first questions\nwere simple, and led gradually up to more difficult ones.\n\" Now, Darkie, count three.\"\n\" Bow ! wow ! wow !\n\"\n\" Four.\" The answer was correct. From that various numbers\nwere mentioned, some by the master, and some by members of\nthe audience. In every case the answers were right, and then\nthe master proceeded to give Darkie small sums to do, such as :\n\" Six and four.\"\n\" Divide that by five.\"\n\" Twice eight. How much more is that than ten ?\n\" \" Correct.\"\n\" Now give me the square root of sixteen.\"\n\" Bow ! wow ! wow ! wow !\n\" says Darkie.\n\" Spell good-night.\" \" Bow ! wow ! wow ! wow ! wow ! wow !\nwow ! wow ! wow !\n\" But you gave me that all in one word,\" says the master.\n\" Now put the hyphen in the right place.\"\nDarkie gives his little short barks over again, pausing after\nthe fourth one.\nNow comes a test where the dog has no words to guide him.\n\" I have put three coins on the table,\" says the master to\nthe blind dog. \" Tell me how many shillings they make.\" Darkie\nbarks five times. Sure enough, the three coins were a florin,\na sixpence and half-a-crown.\nA gentleman in the audience also tries this test. \" I have\nthree coins here,\" he says. \" How much do they make in shil-\nlings ?\n\" Darkie barks twice, and the coins prove to be a shilling\nand two sixpences. Another gentleman asks the date on a\ncoin in his hand. \" How many more years than 1900 ?\n\" Darkie\ngives five yaps. The date is 1905. . . .\nIn perhaps one case out of ten or twenty, Darkie went wrong\nin his answers. But when his master would say, \" You are quite\nwrong, Darkie,\" he almost invariably gave the correct answer a\nsecond time. ... So quickly did he reply in some instances, that\nthe questions were scarcely out of the interrogators' mouths before\nthe reply was forthcoming. . . .\n\fNo. CCCXXIV.\u2014Vol. XVII. . ..

In one or two instances this has been\ndone because correspondents asked that their names should he\ntvithheld, and in other cases the identity of the writer being a\nmatter of no moment for the purpose we had in view, we have not\nasked permission to reveal it. We take this opportunity of thank-\ning all those who have assisted us in our enquiry, and especially\nthe Editor of ''The All Saints Clifton Parish Magazine.\"\u2014Ed.]\nVery widespread interest has been aroused by the stories\ncurrent during the past year of \" visions \" seen by British\n\fDec, 1915. An Enquiry concerning ''the Angels at Mons.\" 107\nsoldiers during the retreat from Mons. Many enquiries have\nreached us as to whether we have received any first-hand\nevidence of these visions, and it seems worth while to go into\nthe question at some length, not only with a view to deter-\nmining, so far as is possible, what is the truth of the matter,\nbut also because the whole history of the case throws an\ninteresting light on the value of human testimony and the\ngrowth of rumour. These points are of particular interest to\nthose concerned in psychical research, because it is upon\nhuman testimony that their conclusions must to a great extent\nbe founded.\nThe tide of rumour was at its height in May and June of\nthis year, and of the reports which reached us about that\ntime a large number can be directly traced to an article\nwhich first appeared in The All Saints' Clifton Parish Magazine\nfor May, 1915, and was there reprinted in July.\nThis article ran as follows :\nLast Sunday I met Miss M., daughter of the well-known Canon\nM., and she told me she knew two officers both of whom had\nthemselves seen the angels who saved our left wing from the\nGermans, when they came right upon them during the retreat\nfrom Mons.\nThey expected annihilation, as they were almost helpless, when\nto their amazement they stood like dazed men, never so much as\ntouched their guns, nor stirred till we had turned round and\nescaped by some cross-roads. One of Miss M.'s friends, who was\nnot a religious man, told her that he saiu a troop of angels\nbetween us and the enemy. He has been a changed man ever\nsince. The other man she met in London. She asked him if he\nhad heard the wonderful stories of angels. He said he had seen\nthem himself and under the following circumstances.\nWhile he and his company were retreating, they heard the\nGerman cavalry tearing after them. They saw a place where they\nthought a stand might be made with sure hope of safety ;\nbut,\nbefore they could reach it, the German cavalry were upon them.\nThey therefore turned round and faced the enemy, expecting\nnothing but instant death, when to their wonder they saw between\nthem and the enemy a whole troop of angels. The German\nhorses turned round terrified and regularly stampeded. The men\ntugged at their bridles, while the poor beasts tore away in every\ndirection from our men.\na2\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. dkc, 1915.\nThis officer swore he saw the angels, which the horses saw\nplainly enough. This gave them time to reach the little fort, or\nwhatever it was, and save themselves.\nWe received reports almost exactly identical with the above\nfrom several other sources. It is worth noting that these\nstatements are ascribed to various authors, but taking into\naccount the fact that, save for a word here and there, all the\nstatements are verbally identical, we are justified in assuming\nthat they all originate from one source, probably the All\nSaints' Magazine.\nIn each case the story is told on the authority of Miss M.,\nwho is said to have known personally the ofiicers concerned.\nAccordingly we wrote to Miss M. to ask whether she could\ncorroborate these stories, and received the following reply :\nMay 28, 1915.\nI cannot give you the names of the men referred to in your\nletter of May 26, as the story I heard was quite anonymous, and\nI do not know who they were.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that these reports, based on the\nauthority of Miss M., break down at a crucial point. They\nprove to be no more than rumours which it is impossible to\ntrace to their original source. There is also another suggestive\npoint to note in this connexion.\nThe Vicar of All Saints' Parish, Clifton, when he sent us the\nstatement, which had appeared in his parish magazine and is\nprinted above, sent with it another report, attributed to a\ncertain Miss E. W., as follows :\nA Hospital Nurse, who has been attending to a wounded British\nSoldier, said to him the other day : Do you believe in God ?\n\"\nHe answered: \" I do now, but I used not to. But ever since the\nBattle of Mons my opinions have changed.\" Proceeding, he said :\n\" We had a terrible time and at last a company of us was\nhemmed into a large chalk pit. We were quite powerless and\nheard the German cavalry approaching. Suddenly I looked up and\nencircling the top of the pit was a ring of shining Angels. As the\ncavalry rushed up the horses saw them and there was a general\nstampede. Our lives were saved and the Germans were put to\nconfusion.\"\nSeven soldiers including officers saw the Angels. The soldier\n\fDec, 1915.

W.\nWe have also received through a member of the Society,\nMrs. S., the following statement, which was sent to her by a\nfriend :\nA hospital Nurse who has been attending to a wounded British\nSoldier said to him the other day :\n\" Do you believe in God ?\n\"\nHe answered :\n\" I do now, but I used not to, but ever since the\nBattle of Mons my opinions have changed. We had a terrible\ntime and at last a company of us was hemmed into a large chalk\npit. We were quite powerless and heard the German cavalry\napproaching. Suddenly I looked up and encircling the toj) of the\npit was a ring of shining Angels. As the Cavalry rushed up the\nhorses saw them and there was a general stampede. Our lives\nwere saved and the Germans put to confusion. Seven soldiers\nincluding an officer saw the Angels.\"\nThe Soldier gave the names and addresses and the Nurse wrote\nto them and the story was authenticated ; one of the officers\nwriting says :\n\" Its all perfectly true but it's too sacred to put in a\npaper.\" One of the officers was a friend of Miss M., Canon M.'s\ndaughter ; he was not a religious man before, but has been a\nchanged man ever since.\nIf this last statement is compared with Miss E. W.'s report\nand the report in the All Saints' Parish Magazine, it will be\nseen to be a combination of the two. The first paragraph and\nthe first half of the second are verbally identical with Miss\nE. W.'s statement, but whereas Miss E. W. gives Miss Leonard\nas her authority, in the account sent by Mrs. S. Miss M.\nappears again as the source of the story.\nOne of the officers was a friend of Miss M., Canon M.'s\ndaughter ; he was not a religious man before, but has been a\nchanged man ever since.\nThere can be little doubt that this sentence is from the\nsame source as one which occui-red in the All Saints'' Magazine :\nOne of Miss M.'s friends, who was not a religious man, told her\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec,, 1915.\nthat lie saw a troop of angels between us and the enemy. He has\nbeen a changed man ever since.\nIt has already been shown that Miss M. denies having any\nauthority in this matter. As regards Miss Leonard, one of our\nmembers wrote to ask whether she could substantiate the story\nattributed to her. He was referred by Miss Leonard to another\nlady, to whom he also wrote ; but so far he has received no reply.\nOne other piece of alleged evidence in support of the\n\" Angels of Mons \" may be briefly dismissed. In the Daily\nMail for August 24, 1915, there appeared a communication\nfrom Mr. G. S. Hazlehurst stating that a certain Private\nRobert Cleaver, 1st Cheshire Regiment, had signed an affidavit\nin his presence to the effect that he \" personally was at Mons\nand saw the Vision of Angels with [his] own eyes.\" Speaking\nof his interview with Private Cleaver, Mr. Hazlehurst said :\nWhen I saw Private Cleaver, who struck me as being a very\nsound, intelligent man, he at once volunteered his statement and\nhad no objection to signing an affidavit before me that he had\nseen the Angels of Mons.\nHe said that things were at the blackest with our troops, and\nif it had not been for the supernatural intervention they would\nhave been annihilated. The men were in retreat, and lying down\nbehind small tufts of grass for cover. Suddenly the vision came\nbetween them and the German cavalry.\nHe described it as a \" flash \"... The cavalry horses rushed in\nall directions and were disorganised.\nIn the Daily Mail for September 2, 1915, there appeared a\nfurther communication from Mr. Hazlehurst to the effect that\nin consequence of a rumour that Private Cleaver was not\npresent at the battle of Mons, he had written to the head-\nquarters at Salisbury for information as to his movements, and\nreceived the following reply :\n* '\nRecords Office, Cheshire Regiment.\n. . . (10515 R. Cleaver.) . . .\nWith regard to your enquiries concerning the above man, the\nfollowing are the particulars concerning him. He mobilised at\nChester on August 22, 1914:. He was posted out to the 1st\nBattalion, Expeditionary Force, France, with a draft on September\n6, 1914. He returned to England on December 14, sick.\n\fDec, 1915. An Enquiry concerning \"the Angels at Mors.\" Ill\nMr. Hazlehurst concludes :\nThe battle of Mons was in August, 1914, and readers will draw\ntheir own conclusions. Information sworn on oath is usually\nregarded as sufficiently trustworthy for publication, but apparently\nnot in this case. . . .\nSo far, therefore, as concerns Private Cleaver and the other\nevidence which has been considered up to this point, the\nlegend of the Angels at Mons remains insufficiently corroborated,\nand the suggestion has even been made that it owes its origin\nentirely to a story by Mr. Arthur Machen, called The Boivmen,\nwhich first appeared in the Evening News of September 29,\n1914, and, as its author himself affirms, was purely fictitious.\nSubsequently The Boivmen was published in book form, and in\nhis preface to the first edition Mr. Machen supports the con-\ntention that the source from which the legend of the \" Angels\nof Mons \" sprang is no other than his own tale. In his\npreface, however, to the second edition he says that, in con-\nsequence of further evidence which has been brought to his\nnotice, he has modified this opinion. Apart from this evidence,\n\u2014which will be considered in due course,\u2014one would have\nexpected that, had Mr. Machen's story been the sole origin of\nthe legend, the various versions of it that have been current\nwould have borne clearer traces of their origin. Those versions\nwhich have been quoted above bear hardly any resemblance to\nMr. Machen's tale beyond the fact that the central incident in\neach case is a supernatural intervention on behalf of the\nBritish army. Shortly after the publication of The Bowmen in\nbook form, Mr. Harold Begbie published a pamphlet entitled\nOn the Side of tlie Angels, in which he set out to refute the\nassertion that Mr. Machen was solely responsible for the reports\nconcerning the Angels at Mons. Mr. Begbie's object is to\nprove \" not that Angels appeared at Mons, but that before\nMr. Machen had written his fiction British soldiers in France\nbelieved that Angels had appeared to them.\" We may there-\nfore expect to find, as we in fact do, that Mr. Begbie's\nevidence is not such as to throw any clear light on the precise\nnature of the experiences which he relates. That is not\nprimarily his purpose, and the reports which he has collected\nare in some cases given at second hand, and in others have\nl)een described by the percipients only after an interval of\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, dec, 1915.\nmany months since the date of the experience, so that due\nallowance must be made for inaccuracy of memory, the force\nof suggestion, and other common sources of error. We have,\nhowever, tried to get further particulars in all cases which\nseemed likely to prove interesting, but the result has hitherto\nbeen small. In one way or another many possible witnesses\nhave passed out of reach, and other witnesses do not feel\nthemselves able to assist us. It may, however, be of interest\nto quote and discuss some of the best accredited reports,\ntogether with such additional information as we have been\nable to obtain about them.\nIn the Daily Mail of August 12, 1915, there appeared a\nreport of an interview with a wounded lance-corporal, whose\nname was not given. His statement\u2014quoted also by Mr.\nBegbie\u2014was as follows :\nI was with my battalion iu the retreat from Mens on or about\nAugust 28. The German cavalry were expected to make a charge,\nand we were waiting to fire and scatter them. . . .\nThe weather was very hot and clear, and between eight and\nnine o'clock in the evening I was standing with a party of nine\nother men on duty, and some distance on either side there were\nparties of ten on guard. . . . An officer suddenly came up to us\nin a state of great anxiety and asked us if we had seen anything\nstartling. . . . He hurried away from my ten to the next party\nof ten. At the time we thought 'that the officer must be expecting\na surprise attack.\nImmediately afterwards the officer came back, and taking me\nand some others a few yards away showed us the sky. I could\nsee quite plainly in mid-air a strange light which seemed to be\nquite distinctly outlined and was not a reflection of the moon,\nnor were there any clouds in the neighbourhood. The light became\nbrighter and I could see distinctly three shapes, one in the centre\nhaving what looked like outspread wings ; the other two were not\nso large, but were quite plainly distinct from the centre one.\nThey appeared to have a long loose-hanging garment of a golden\ntint, and they were above the German line facing us.\nWe stood watching them for about three quarters of an hour.\nAll the men with me saw them, and other men came up from\nother groups who also told us they had seen the same thing. . . .\nI remember the day because it was a day of terrible anxiety\n\fDec, 1915. An Enquiry concerning \" the Angels at Mons.\" 113\nfor us. That morning the Munsters had a bad time on our right,\nand so had the Scots Guards. We managed to get to the wood.\n. . . Later on the Uhlans attacked us and we drove them back\nwith heavy loss. It was after this engagement, when we were\ndog-tired, that the vision appeared to us.\nWe wrote to the Lady Superintendent of the hospital at\nwhich the man had been treated, to whom he was said to\nhave told his experience before it was published, and asked her\nwhether she could put us into communication with him. She\nreplied on October 28, 1915 :\nThe man about whom you enquire has left here and has failed\nto answer my letter and postcard. I do not therefore know his\npresent whereabouts. When I hear from him again 1 will write\nto you.\nWe have heard nothing further, and up to the present,\ntherefore, the rejiort, having reached us only at second hand,\ndoes not conform to the standard of evidence which any\nscientific enquiry demands. But assuming for the moment that\nthis report gives an accurate account of the lance-corporal's\nexperience, it would be a weak scaffolding upon which to\nbuild up a theory of supernatural intervention.\nIt appears that, having had their attention directed to it by\nan officer \" in a state of great anxiety,\" the lance-corporal and\nsome of his companions saw a light in the sky, divided into\nthree parts, of which the central part resembled a figm-e with\noutstretched wings. We are not told how, or by whom, this\nresemblance was first observed, and nothing is easier than to\ninterpret a vague cloudlike shape according to one's fancy.\nThe lance-corporal tells us that there were no clouds in the\nsky that night, but tells us nothing about smoke. It seems on\nthe face of it not improbable that a bank of smoke, which was\nin some way lit up, might have been hanging \" above the\nGerman line,\" and it has to be remembered that men who are\n\" dog-tired,\" who have just repulsed one hostile attack and are\nmomentarily expecting another, are not likely to be in a state\nconducing to accurate observation. The lance-corporal told the\nLady Superintendent at the hospital that \" under the feet\nof the three figures was a bright star and that when the\nfigures disappeared, the star remained.\" It was in fact a\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1915.\n\"real\" star, and perhaps constituted the point de repere of the\nillusion.\nIt is interesting to compare with the lance-corporal's state-\nment the following report in the Liverpool Courier (October 25,\n1915) of a sermon by the Rev. C. M. Chavasse :\nHe had never yet got first-hand evidence on the subject, but he\nhad been told by a general, a brigadier, who was far from super-\nstitious, that a captain and subaltern serving under him were\ncertain they saw something at Mons. They were men who would\nnever dream of seeing angels, but they said they saw something,\nsome bright pulsating light, which came between the little company\nof Englishmen and a troop of charging Uhlans on their horses,\nwhich frightened the horses so that they scattered and bolted,\nwhile a little further along, where the British line was broken, the\nGerman troops refused to advance, saying that they saw so many\nEnglish troops there, although there was not a man to oppose them.\nMr. Begbie also quotes several incidents reported by Miss\nPhyllis Campbell in an article in the August number of the\nOcctdt Review. Miss Campbell was working at a hospital in\nFrance during the early part of the war, and she says that\nseveral of her patients told her of the \" visions \" they had\nseen on the battlefield. We wTote some time ago to Miss\nCampbell asking whether she could give us any further\ninformation or put us in touch with the soldiers to whom\nthese experiences had come, but we have not yet heard from\nher. In any event, it does not seem likely that we should\nnow be able to get any first-hand knowledge of these cases,\nand without this we cannot judge them.\nWe have communicated with several other people whom Mr.\nBegbie quotes as having first-hand information on the subject\nof these visions.\nOne writes that he is \" not able to help us \" ; another\nrefers us to a friend as the chief source of his information.\nWe have written to this friend, but received no reply. A\nthird correspondent writes that she is\nnot in the least concerned as to the proofs. ... I do not\nreally think it is the smallest use trying to bring these things\nhome to roost. They are revealed by God for individual need and\nare not intended to become the talk and speculation of the\nmarket-place.\n\fDec, 1915. An Enquiry concerning \" the Angels at Mons.\"\nTwo other incidents remain which are worth relating. In\nSeptember of this year Mr. Machen received a letter from a\nlieutenant-colonel at the Front, which was published in the\nEvening News of September 14, 1915. The colonel's statement\nwas as follows :\nOn August 26, 1914, was fought the battle of Le Cateau. We\ncame into action at dawn, and fought till dusk. We were heavily\nshelled by the German artillery during the day, and in common\nwith the rest of our division had a bad time of it.\nOur division however retired in good order. We were on the\nmarch all night of the 26th and on the 27th with only about two\nhours' rest.\nThe brigade to which 1 belonged was rearguard to the division,\nand during the 27th we took up a great many different positions\nto cover the retirement of the rest of the division, so that we had\nvery hard work and by the night of the 27th we were all abso-\nlutely worn out with fatigue\u2014both bodily and mental fatigue.\nNo doubt we also suffered to a certain extent from shock ;\nbut\nthe retirement still continued in excellent order, and I feel sure\nthat our mental faculties were still ... in good working con-\ndition.\nOn the night of the 27th I was riding along in the column with\ntwo other officers. We had been talking and doing our best to\nkeep from faUing asleep on our horses.\nAs we rode along I became conscious of the fact that, in the\nfields on both sides of the road along which we were marching, I\ncould see a very large body of horsemen.\nThese horsemen had the appearance of squadrons of cavalry, and\nthey seemed to be riding across the fields and going in the same\ndirection as we were going, and keeping level with us. . . .\nI did not say a word about it at first, but I watched them for\nabout twenty minutes. The other two officers had stopped talking.\nAt last one of them asked me if I saw anything in the fields.\nI then told him what I had seen. The third officer then con-\nfessed that he too had been watching these horsemen for the past\ntwenty minutes.\nSo convinced were we that they were real cavalry that, at the\nnext halt, one of the officers took a party of men out to recon-\nnoitre, and found no one there. The night then grew darker, and\nwe saw no more.\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dkc, 1915.\nThe same phenomenon was seen by many men in our column.\nOf course, we were all dog-tired and overtaxed, but it is an\nextraordinary thing that the same phenomenon should be witnedsed\nby so many different people.\nI myself am absolutely convinced that I saw these horsemen\n;\nand I feel sure that they did not exist only in my imagination. . . .\nIt is interesting to compare with this statement a letter\nfrom Lance-Corporal A. Johnstone, late of the Royal Engineers,\nwhich was published in the Evening News of August 11, 1915,\nas follows :\nWe had almost reached the end of the retreat, and, after\nmarching a whole day and night with but one half-hour's rest in\nbetween, we found ourselves on the outskirts of Langy, near\nParis, just at dawn, and as the day broke we saw in front of us\nlarge bodies of cavalry, all formed up into squadrons\u2014fine, big\nmen, on massive chargers.\nI remember turning to my chums in the ranks and saying\n:\n\" Thank God ! We are not far off Paris now. Look at the\nFrench cavalry.\"\nThey, too, saw them quite plainly, but on getting closer, to our\nsurprise the horsemen vanished and gave place to banks of white\nmist, with clumps of trees and bushes dimly showing through\nthem. . . .\nWhen I tell you that hardened soldiers who had been through\nmany a campaign were marching quite mechanically along the\nroad and babbling all sorts of nonsense in sheer delirium, you can\nwell believe we were in a fit state to take a row of beanstalks for\nall the saints in the Calendar.\nIt will be seen that the colonel's experience and that of\nLance-Corporal Johnstone have much in common, but whereas\nthe latter finds the explanation in an illusion of the senses,\ndue mainly to physical fatigue, the former is convinced that the\nhorsemen did not exist only in his imagination. Although it is\nnot possible to prove that the colonel was mistaken, it will,\nI think, be generally held that the weight of probability is\nagainst him, especially in view of his admission that he and\nhis companions were \" absolutely worn out with fatigue\u2014both\nbodily and mental,\" and that some effort had been necessary\n\" to keep from falling asleep on [their] horses.\"\n\fDec, 1915. An Enquiry concerning \"the Angels at Movs.\" 117\nIn addition to the enquiries to which reference has been\nmade above, we have also written to a considerable number of\npeople who had been mentioned to us as possessing first-hand\ninformation on the subject of these \"visions,\" but in no case\nhave we succeeded in obtaining satisfactory evidence. Some-\ntimes our letters have been unanswered, sometimes it has\ntranspired on enquiry that a story purporting to be at first-\nhand was in reality only at second or even at third-hand.\nThe following is a typical case. Miss R. wrote to the secretary\nas follows :\nThe day after I saw you I . . . saw Mrs, B. When talking of the\nstory of Mens, she said she had met a lady who told her she knew a\nman who had seen the vision. I asked her to send me his name.\nMrs. B., on being asked for the name of the man, replied\n:\n... I have been told the name of one man who saw it [the\nvision], but it was given me under strict secrecy, so I may not\nteU it ; and then, again, it is not first-hand, for I did not hear it\nfrom him. . . .\nAnother correspondent, in reporting to us his unsuccessful\nefforts to track down a story, writes that \" somehow, first-hand\nknowledge seems to be purposely withheld,\" and we have\ncertainly found it very elusive, whether \" purposely \" so or not.\nSumming up the evidence at om- disposal, the following\nconclusions may be drawn :\n(a) Many of the stories which have been cm'rent during the\npast year concerning \"visions\" on the battlefield prove on\ninvestigation to be founded on mere rumour and cannot be\ntraced to any authoritative source.\n(6) After we have discounted these rumours, we are left with\na small residue of evidence, which seems to indicate that a\ncertain number of men who took part in the retreat from\nMons honestly beUeve themselves to have had at that time\nsupernormal experiences of a remarkable character. The best\npiece of evidence of this kind is the statement of the colonel\nwho wrote to ]\\Ir. Machen (see p. 115).\n(c) When, however, we turn to the question of what grounds\nthere are for assuming that these experiences were in fact\nsupernormal, it must be admitted that these grounds are\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1915.\nslight. In the last of the three narratives printed above, the\nauthor himself, Lance-Corporal A. Johnstone, puts forward the\nview that he and his friends were subject to a sensory illusion\ndue to extreme fatigue. When we remember that this con-\ndition of fatigue was also present in the other two cases, it\nseems not unlikely that the same explanation will account for\nthem. The best piece of evidence, as I have said, is that of\nthe lieutenant-colonel, and it may be that we have here a case\nof collective hallucination rather than illusion. But whether\nthis is so, and whether the hallucination, assuming that it\noccurred, was purely subjective or due to any external cause,\nwe have not evidence to show, nor does it seem likely that we\nshall now be able to obtain such evidence.\nIn the main, therefore, the result of our enquiry is negative,\nat least as regards the question of whether any apparitions\nwere seen on the battlefield, either at Mons or elsewhere. Of\nfirst-hand testimony we have received none at all, and of\ntestimony at second-hand none that would justify us in assum-\ning the occurrence of any supernormal phenomenon. For we\ncannot make this assumption, until we have established at\nleast a strong probability that the observed effects are such as\nonly a supernormal phenomenon could produce, and in the\npresent instance, as I have tried to show, all our efforts to\nobtain the detailed evidence upon which an enquiry of this\nkind must be based have proved unavailing.\nCASE.\nL. 1203. Collective Hallucination.\nThe following case, which appears to be one of collective\nhallucination, was originally brought to our notice by Mr.\nE. P. Larken, who has been for some years an Associate\nof this Society. Mr. Larken wrote to us on July 23 of this\nyear telling us that he had received an account of her ex-\nperience from one of the percipients, Miss Ernestine Anne,\nand suggesting that we should obtain further information\nfrom her. We wrote accordingly to Miss Anne, who sent\nus in reply a detailed account of her experience and corro-\nborative statements from the three persons who shared it,\nher father, mother, and brother.\n\fDec, 1915. Case. 119\nSince the experience occurred on July 6, 1913, the four\nstatements which we print below were all made about two\nyears after the event, but Miss Anne also sent us a short\npaper written in September, 1913, that is, two months after\nthe event, for an Essay Club, and in all essential particulars\ncorresponding to the later account which we print here,\nbecause its form is better suited to our present purpose.\nMiss Anne's account is as follows :\nJtdy 28, 1915.\nI visited the ruined Abbey of Jumieges on the first Sunday\nof July in 1913 [July 6]. I was accompanied by my father,\nmother and youngest brother. We arrived at the ruin about\n3 p.m., and we proceeded at once to inspect the imposing-looking\nruin of the monastic church, called \" I'EgHse Notre Dame.\" It\nis the largest and most impressive example of Norman ecclesiastical\narchitecture 1 have ever seen. It was built cruciform, and the\nright-hand \" arm \" of the cross joined on to another much smaller\nchurch, which was used as the parish church and goes by the\nname of \" I'Eglise St. Pierre.\" The walls of this latter church\nstand more or less intact, but only the nave of the monastic\nScattered\nStones^\nNotr^ Dame\nChurch\nNotre Dame\nChurch\nTower Tower\njumi6ges churches, i.\nSt Peters\n*- Church\nTower Tower\nJUMlkOES CHURCHES. II.\nchurch remains ; and a small number of scattered stones mark\nthe place where the choir was once. Trees and shrubs cover\nthe spot where the presbytery once stood. After we had spent\nsome time in the Notre Dame ruin, we walked on into the Church\nof \" St. Pierre.\" We had been there about ten minutes admiring\nthis exquisite fourteenth century Gothic ruin, and 1 then wandered\naway a short distance from my companions ; 1 suddenly became\naware of the sound of a large number of men's voices which\nseemed to come from the open space on our left where the\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, Dkc, 1915.\nfew scattered stones marked the site of where the monastic\nchoir had been. The singing was very soft ; the air was quite\nfamiliar ; I remember saying to myself twice : \"I am imagining\nthis ! I am imagining this !\n\" and then the music \" left \" my\nattention as I heard my father exclaim :\n\" Why, there are the\nmonks singing !\n\" I heard no more singing after that, so I\nreally only heard it for a few seconds. I was so struck with\nthe strangeness of the thing that I determined to pretend I\nhad heard nothing, until I learnt from my companions if their\nexperience had been the same as my own. I found this was\nthe case, and we agreed that the voices were chanting \" Vespers\n\"\n\u2014that is to say, they were chanting a psalm in Latin. We\ntried to think of possible \" natural \" explanations, but the present\nparish church was a kilometre and a half from there\u2014so the\ncaretaker told us\u2014besides which, if the sound had come from\nthere, we should have heard it for longer than a few seconds.\nIt was a very fine day, and I do not remember that there was\nany wind. We spent about half an hour longer near the ruins\nwithout hearing anything else in such an extraordinary way.\nI wrote an account of this shortly after it took place, which\nhas helped me to remember the facts very well indeed.\nErnestine Anne.\nWe have also received the following corroborative accounts :\nBURGHWALLIS HaLL,\nAsKERN, nr. Doncaster, July 28, 1915.\nOne Sunday afternoon about the beginning of July, 1913,\na party of us motored out from Rouen to view the ruins of\nthe old Benedictine abbey at Jumieges.\nOn arriving at our destination we found the small village\nnear by (and in fact the whole countryside) absolutely deserted,\nthe entire population having gone to a Grand Regatta Fete\nwhich was being held at a town on the banks of the Seine three\nor four miles away. .\n-\nNot a soul was to be seen about, beyond the concierge at\nthe lodge at the entrance of the grounds in which the ruins\nstand. We wandered around a bit and presently entered what\nmight have been the chancel of the church in happier days.\nNow there was nothing but bare walls, with the blue sky of\nthe heavens for a roof. We had not been there many seconds\nbefore I became aware of the beautiful singing which appeared\n\fDec, 1915. Case. 121\nto come from quite close to where we stood, and about half-\nway up the ruined, blackened wall facing us.\nIt was as a choir chanting the psalms at Vespers in exquisite\nharmony and softly. I could almost distinguish the very words\nof the Latin.\nI exclaimed :\n\" Hullo, the monks are singing !\n\" taking it\nquite as a matter of course, and forgetting that I was not actually\nin a church but only standing amidst the ruins of what had\nonce been one. Then somebody else in our party said some-\nthing, and the singing stopped\u2014very gently and very softly\n\u2014\nas it had begun. Immediately after, we explored all around,\nbut there was no one about. Everything was deserted and\nourselves the only people near the place. The chanting, whilst\nit lasted, was very superior to anything that I have ever heard\nin any church, especially in France.\n^^^^^^ L. S. Anne.\nJuly 28, 1915.\nIt was on a Sunday in July in 1913. We motored over to\nJumieges. It was a lovely hot, clear summer's day.\nWe went into the ruins of the abbey by the west entrance,\nand passed right up the great church from nave into choir\n\u2014\nthen turned off into the ruins of the parish church of St. Peter's,\nwhich adjoins the abbey.\nWe were all four standing a few paces apart, looking at the\nwonderful ruin, when I heard\u2014very distinctly\u2014men's voices\nsinging in the choir. When I think of it, I can hear them now\n\u2014\ntrained melodious voices, singing in harmony, the different voices\nwonderfully balanced and trained. It seemed somehow quite\nnatural ; it had not yet dawned on me that it was super-\nnatural. I remained for some seconds held. The sounds were\njust those of a choir singing under a vast vaulted roof.\nThen my husband said :\n\" There are the monks singing !\n\"\nEven then it seemed nothing very strange. I think it was because\nwe felt it was so strange that we spoke so little about it, though\nwe must have uttered exclamations of astonishment and ex-\nchanged experiences\u2014as we have done since.\nI may add that no human singing in the neighbourhood could\nhave conveyed the impression of what I heard, which was the\nharmonies at the end of a plain chant, sung by a well-balanced,\nperfectly trained choir echoing through a vast vaulted roof.\nEdith Anne.\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1915.\nJuly 30, 1915.\nIt was a Sunday in July, 1913, that I visited the ruins of\nthe abbey of Jumieges, with my mother, father and sister.\nWe entered the ruins by the west doorway, and proceeded\nup the church in the direction of the choir. On reaching the\nsanctuary, or rather what Httle remains of it, after spending\nsome time looking at the ruins, we turned through the south\nwall into the smaller parish church of St. Pierre, which is alongside\nthe monastic church.\nWe left the parish church, after examining it, by the west\ndoor, and were standing in the garth outside. I remember that\nI was looking into some ancient graves that had fallen in. I\nsuddenly became aware of the sound of chanting\u2014as of a choir\nof monks. One of the party exclaimed :\n\" There are the monks\nsinging.\"\nThere were no other persons in the ruins or grounds save\nthe members of our party.\nThere was no evidence of any church near by which could\nhave originated the sounds.\nThe singing only lasted about thirty seconds or a minute, and\nas we spent a considerable time afterwards in the ruins and the\ngrounds, we should have heard any subsequent sounds had there\nbeen any. ^ Edward Anne.\nIt is evident that the interpretation to be placed upon the\npercipients' experience depends upon the question of whether\nany chanting, such as was heard, is likely to have been\nactually taking place at the time within a sufficiently short\ndistance to be audible. The time of day at which the ex-\nperience occurred\u20143.30 p.m. on a Sunday\u2014rather favours this\nhypothesis, since it is a likely hour for the chanting of Vespers.\nBut we have still to consider by whom the Office might have\nbeen chanted, and where. As regards the present Parish\nChurch of Jumieges, Miss Anne states, on the authority of the\ncaretaker at the ruins, that it was nearly a mile away, a\ndistance at which it is hardly possible to suppose that singing\nwould be audible, especially on a day when there was no wind\nto carry the sound. It is said, however, in La Grande Encyclo-\npSdie (published in 1887) that the \" capitular hall \" and various\nother accessory buildings at Jumieges are still almost intact,\n\fDec, 1915. Case. 123\nand that \" a community of Benedictine monks has recently\nacquired all these buildings for the purpose of re-establishing\nan abbey in them.\"\nIn reply to an enquiry as to whether it had been ascertained\nthat no monks were in residence at Jumieges in July, 1913,\nMiss Anne writes :\n,\nNovemher 12, 1915.\nThe caretaker at Jumieges certainly said nothing about there\nbeing a Benedictine Community living at Jumieges, and I think\nshe would have done, had this been the case, when We questioned\nher. She said the whole place belongs to the people who own the\nchateau which is built of stones from the ruin. . . .\nI think myself there can be no Benedictine Community there,\nas all the French Benedictine monks that I know of, were turned\nout of France ten years ago, and also the English Benedictine\nCommunities, so I think if there had been a French one at\nJumieges, they would have gone too. . . .\nAs the evidence, therefore, stands at present, it appears\nunlikely that any chanting such as the percipients heard,\nshould have been actually taking place at the time, but this\npoint cannot be considered clearly established, and the fact\nthat the sounds were heard by all the four members of the\nparty is, so far as it goes, a reason for supposing that these\nsounds were not hallucinatory in character, but due to normal\nphysical causes. If any of our members have information as\nto whether (\u00ab) there were any monks resident at Jumieges\nAbbey in Jvdy, 1913, or (6) there is in the immediate neigh-\nbourhood of the Abbey any ecclesiastical building in which\nchanting is likely to take place, we should be much obliged if\nthey would communicate with us.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nWe have received from Dr. F. C. S. Schiller the following\nletter concerning the report on \" A Thinking Dog \" which\nwas printed in the preceding number of the Journal, October-\nNovember, 1915 :\nTo the Editor of the Journal.\nIt is perhaps worth pointing out that, according to the interesting\naccount given in the Journal of last October, the performances\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Resectrch. Dkc, 1915.\nof the New Zealand dog \" Darkie \" differ very materially from\nthose of the Mannheim dog \" Rolf.\" In the latter case the\nexperiments made were designed to bring out the dog's capacity\nto think independently, and there was no suggestion that the\nanimal had supernormal powers of cognition. Nor were questions\ninvolving any supernormal powers of perception put to him.\nBut \" Darkie \" appears frequently to have been asked questions\nwhich could not be answered by the normal powers of any\nintelligence, and it is definitely suggested that he answered by\ntapping telef)athically the knowledge of his master, who, \" if\nhe concentrates his thoughts,\" enables the dog to answer any\nquestion known to him (p. 103). Indeed even more than this\nis involved in questions asking the dog to tell the time by a\nparticular watch (which was wrong), and the numbers on a bank-\nnote and a watch, which were presumably unknown to the\ninquirer : this would require a sort of clairvoyance, though the\nconditions of the experiments are not very clearly stated. Of\ncourse, M. Maeterlinck's theory that dogs are \" psychics \" who\nhave access to a cosmic reservoir of all knowledge, would obtain\nsupport from the experiments if the animal's knowledge were\nfound both to go beyond that possessed by any human mind,\nand to be such that its own sense perception could not account\nfor it ; but until it is made clear that the conditions exclude\nboth this and telepathic transfer from a human mind, this ex-\nplanation can hardly be entertained. Indeed, as the record\nstands, it can hardly be said that the most obvious interpretation\nof all, that of unconscious signalling, is excluded, though no\ndoubt it is rendered more difficult by the fact that \" Darkie,\"'\nlike the Elberfeld horse \" Berto,\" is blind.\nF.

Jan.-Feb.\nSOME RECENT CASES OF PREMONITION\nAND TELEPATHY.!\nBy the Rev. M. A. Bayfield.\nSince a few of the experiences which form the subject of this\npaper are without corroboration, it seems desirable to begin\nwith a word or two about the kidy to whom they occurred,\nlest you should regard these uncorroborated incidents\u2014or,\nindeed, the main narrative\u2014with any suspicion. Of course, as\nour experience has taught us, it is only prudent, in the case\nof any one not well known to us, to receive unsupported\nstatements on the subjects with which the Society is concerned\nwith a certain amount of reserve ; but in the present case you\nwill, I think, agree with me that the incidents which are\nconfirmed by the testimony of others lend full credibility to\nthose which are not so supported.\nThis lady, who\" belongs to a family well known in North\nDevon\u2014her maiden name was Chichester\u2014has been known to\nme from her childhood and to my wife from her birth ;\nindeed,\nour families are connected by marriage. Of the truthfulness of\nher statements we have no doubt, and I have myself carefully\ncross-examined her on each of the incidents that are now to be\nbrought before you. I ought fui-t.her to state that those\naccounts which are in my own language, and which form the\nmajority, were written down from information given in con-\nversation several weeks before I received the confirmations of\nother persons concerned. That is to say, my account of any\nparticular incident is really her own independent account, not\na story put together by me upon a comparison of the whole\nevidence. She signed each account separately when I had\nwritten it, and has since read and signed the whole paper as\ncorrect. Similarly, her written accounts were given to me\nbefore I received the corroborations. From childhood, as she\ntells me, she has had experiences similar to those recorded\nhere, but until the occurrence of one tragic incident which I\nshall have to relate, attached no particular impoi-tance to\nthem. The recent experiences were first brought to my own\nnotice a few months ago. I at once urged her to make\n'This paper was read before the Society on November 22, 1915,\n\f1916. Recent Oases of Premonition and Tetepathy. 127\ncontemporary notes of all such premonitory impressions, but\nalthough she fortunately did so in two subsequent cases, in\nthree others the good intention was forgotten.\nIn 1910 Miss Chichester married Lieut. George Harley\nPownall, R.N., and they went to live at Harwich, where he\nwas in command of a submarine. She tells me that when they\nwere engaged she felt convinced\u2014it seems to have been a\nsettled conviction and more than a mere fear\u2014that he would\nnot live long ; but admits that she considered the submarine\nservice a dangerous one even in time of peace. We may see\nreason to think that this opinion was perhaps not the sole\ncause of the presentiment. Lieut. Pownall was of a robust\nconstitution and his health was excellent.\nOne day while they were at Harwich she saw, or thought\nshe saw, through a window that looked on the street, her\nhusband come up on his bicycle, get off, and approach the\nhouse. She then heard the door open and shut, and the sound\nof his footsteps in the hall. As he did not come into the room,\nshe went out but found no one. This was in the afternoon.\nLieut. Pownall, who had not been near the house at that time,\nreturned about an hour later. ^\nIn 1913 Lieut. -Commander Pownall (he had been jjiomoted in\n1911) was appointed First Lieutenant of the Egmont, depot-\nship of the submarines at Malta, with command of the Sub-\nmarine Flotilla there. Mrs. Pownall went out with him.\nIn August 1914, after the outbreak of the war, Mr. R. E.\nKnox, R.N.,2 who was on the staff of Admiral Carden, Admiral\nSuperintendent of the Dockyard, said in Mrs. Pownall's pre-\nsence, \" Anyhow we [meaning the Admiral and his staff] shall\nnot leave Malta, for the Admiral has jiist received an extension\nof his appointment \"\n\u2014or words to that effect.^ A few days\nlater, about August 12, on coming down to breakfast Mrs.\n1 Some ten or eleven years ago, when away on a visit. Bliss Chichester\nhad a visual hallucination of her mother, who, being then at home, had\nendeavoured (without any previous arrangement) to make herself visible to\nher daughter. She had previously had a similar hallucination of her mother,\nbut without intention on the latter' s part.\n^ Not the real name or initials.\n* There was, I believe, no formal \" extension \" ; it would be more correct\nto say that it became known that the Admiral was not to be relieved as\nhad been expected.\n\fl28 Journat of Society for Psychical Research. Jan. -Feb.\nPownall said she had dreamed on the previous night that\nAdmiral Garden was going to have command of a fleet at sea,\nbut nowhere near England. This was said to her husband and\nMr. Knox, and later to Captain L. T. Esmond.^ Since it was\nthen common knowledge that the Admiral was not to be\nrelieved, her friends naturally dismissed the dream as absurd.\nSome five weeks after this (I am betraying no secret, for the\nfact was at once publicly known) Admiral Garden was appointed\nGonimander-in-Ghief of the Mediterranean Fleet, then at the\nDardanelles.\nThis is corroborated by Mr. Knox as follows :\nOctober, 1915.\nIn August 1914 I was [on the staff of] Admiral Garden. I\nremember that towards the end of the month^ I said to Mrs.\nPownall that the Admiral and his staff would be fixtures at Malta\nduring the war, as the appointment of the Admiral who was to\nrelieve him had been cancelled. I remember also that a few days\nlater Mrs. Pownall said she had dreamed that Admiral Garden was\nin command of a Fleet at sea. Lieut.-Gommander Pownall,\nGaptain [Esmond], and I regarded it as extremely improbable that\nhe would leave Malta Dockyard.\n(Signed) R. E. Knox\nCaptain Esmond writes from Malta on October 23, 1915 :\nMrs. Pownall told me in August 1914 that she had dreamed\nthat Admiral Garden was to have a command at sea, but nowhere\nnear England. This was generally regarded as improbable, in\nview of the fact that the Admiral had only recently received an\nextension of the appointment he then held at Malta.\nSome time after the outbreak of the war, but before Sep-\ntember 7 of last year, the question of the dispatch of sub-\nmarines from Malta to the Dardanelles was discussed among\nMrs. Pownall's friends. It is natural to surmise that the\ndiscussion began after August 10, and that it arose from the\nfact that the Goeben and Breslau had on that day succeeded\nin reaching Constantinople. The naval officers were of opinion\n1 Not the real name or initials.\n- Since sending this statement Mr. Knox has written that he cannot\nclearly recall what time in August the incident happened. Mrs. Pownall\nfixes the date as being a few days after August 8, on which day she and\nher husband moved into the house in which the dream occurred.\n\f1916. Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 129\nthat the submarines would remain at Malta for the defence of\nthe island. Mrs. Pownall, however, constantly affirmed to her\nhusband and others that the submarine flotilla would be sent\nto the Dardanelles and that he would go with them. She will,\nI am sure, not quarrel mth me if I say that her grasp of\nnaval strategy is not such that this conviction, opposed as it\nwas to expert opinion, is hkely to have been based on reflec-\ntion and judgment. The declaration of war against Turkey, it\nwill be remembered, was not made until November 5, 1914.\nThe premonition is corroborated by Mr. Knox as follows :\nNovember 1, 1915.\nI remember Mrs. George Pownall saying in August 1914 that the\nMalta submarines would be sent to the Dardanelles. We all\nconsidered this most improbable.\n(Signed) R. E. Knox.\nCaptain Esmond writes under date October 23, 1915 :\nBefore the Submarine Flotilla left Malta for the Dardanelles it\nwas the general opinion in Naval circles that it would not be so\nemployed, being required for the defence of the island. I remem-\nber that Mrs. George Pownall nevertheless afl&rmed more than once\nthat the submarines would be sent to the Dardanelles. This took\nplace.\nOn September 7, 1914, Mrs. Pownall saw her husband pass\nacross the harbour in his skaff. She had frequently seen him\ndo so, but on this occasion she said to herself, \" He is going\nto the Admiral to receive orders for the dispatch of the\nsubmarines to the Dardanelles.\" This was in fact the case,\nand the flotilla left Malta next day. Lieut. -Commander Pownall\nmade the voyage in the Hindustani, a collier, which was\nafterwards renamed the Hindiikush and became the submarine\ndepot-ship at the Dardanelles. He remained on this ship until\nhe was transferred to a transport on some day between the\n17th and 2.5th of April, 1915.\nWhen her husband parted from her, Mrs. Pownall felt\nabsolutely sure she would never see him again, ^ and from that\nday onwards she always felt peculiarly depressed on Sundays,\nand mentioned the fact in letters to her husband many times.\nOn Sunday, April 25, 1915, he was killed by a bursting shell\n1 Her own words are :\n\" I had not a shadow of doubt about it.\"\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan.-Feb.\nwhile in charge of a boat taking part in the first landing on\nGallipoli. He was wounded in the early morning and died at\n10.30 a.m.\nOn that same afternoon at Malta Captain Esmond called on\nMrs. Pownall and delivered a letter written to her by her\nhusband, whose letters were sent that way by private arrange-\nment\u2014probably for greater safety or more rapid delivery.\nAfter giving her the letter Captain Esmond left Mrs. Pownall\nin the drawing-room, saying he was very tired and would go\ninto the smoking-room and have a nap. She proceeded to read\nthe letter, which was dated the 17th of April, and when about\nhalf through was seized with an overpowering conviction that\nthe landing had taken place and that her husband had been\nkilled. The conviction was so strong that she felt impelled to\ngo and tell Captain Esmond at once, but refrained from\ndistiirbing him. I have naturally not been able to ask to see\nthis letter, but Mrs. Pownall assures me that it contained\nnothing about naval matters beyond the statement that her\nhusband was going on to a transport.\nIt should be explained that the officer in command of a\nsubmarine flotilla does not live on a submarine, but on what\nis called a depot-ship, which may be any ship that is suitable\nfor the purpose. Lieut. -Commander Pownall, as I have said,\nhad up to the time of writing been on the collier Hinduhish.\nWhen Mrs. Pownall read that he was going on to a transport,\nshe wondered why this was, but her only conclusion was that\nfor some reason he was to be temporarily transferred from his\nsubmarine duties. No doubt the removal to a transport anight\nsuggest duties in connexion with the troops, and as I have\nrecently learned, this was in fact the explanation, for the naval\nofficers who superintended the landing were all placed together\non an empty transport in order to make the necessary arrange-\nments. Mr. Knox, however, writes to me that a naval officer\nwould not necessarily infer from the change even a relinquish-\nment of the submarine duties ; \"it might only mean that a\ntransport was being used as a Submarine Parent instead of the\ncollier which had hitherto been used.'' We shall see that the\ntransference did not suggest to Captain Esmond any partici-\npation in the landing. He had peculiar facilities for knowing\nall that was to be known, and shortly before this had told\n\f191G. Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 131\nMrs. Pownall that the landing would not take place for some\nlittle time.\nTogether with the letter from her husband, Captain Esmond\nhad brought to Mrs. Pownall a letter from Mr. Knox, who also\nwas at the Dardanelles. She does not remember which she\nopened first. Mr. Knox's letter has been destroyed, and he\nhas no recollection of its contents. Mrs. Pownall, however, is\nsure that it contained no reference to the landing of the troops ;\nand we may take it for certain that, even if anyone had known\nthe precise day of the landing more than a week before, Mr.\nKnox would not have divulged so vital a secret, and also that\nhe would certainly not have said a word about Lieut. -Com-\nmander Pownall's taking part in the operation, even if he had\nthen any expectation of his doing so. Before Mr. Knox left,\nMrs. Pownall had obtained from him a promise that he would\nsend to Captain Esmond a telegram with the news of her\nhusband's death whenever it should happen ; she says she did\nthis because she was sure he would be killed. This telegram,\nas we shall see, Mr. Knox sent.\nTo continue the story. When after about an hour Captain\nEsmond returned to the drawing-room, Mrs. Pownall told him\nshe was sure the troops had landed and that her husband had\nbeen killed. He replied that he did not believe it for a\nmoment ;\nfirstly, because he did not think the landing would\ntake place for a day or two, and, secondly, because whenever it\ntook place, it was most unlikely that Lieut. -Commander\nPownall would have any part in it. Apparently nothing that\nhe could say produced any effect, and she replied that she was\nsure she was right. So sure was she, that she asked him to\npromise that he would himself bring her the news when it came,\nand he said he would certainly do so if the need should arise.\nI now give Captain Esmond's account of this interview,\nwritten from Malta ; it confirms Mrs. Pownall's account with\nextraordinary particularity.\nOn Sunday April 25th 1915, the day on which Lieut. Comdr\nPownall was killed, I took to Mrs. Pownall at her house a letter\nwritten from her husband to her and sent under cover to me\n.\nAfter giving her the letter I went into the smoking-room and\nslept for an hour. On my return to the drawing-room Mrs.\nPownall told me she was sure her husband had taken part in the\n\fl')2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan. -Feb.\nlanding and been killed. I was not aware that the landing had\ntaken place, and did not expect the attempt to be made for 2 or\n3 days. That Lieut. Comdr Pownall would land seemed to me\nimprobable, as he was O.C. Submarines. However, I had heard\nthat he had received some appointment other than that of O.C.\nSubmarines. In reply to Mrs. Pownall's statements I said that it\nwas of course possible, but that in view of the fact that 10\nbeachmasters had been appointed by the Admiralty, whom I had\nseen passing through only 3 or 4 days previously, I did not\nthink for a moment that a valuable submarine officer would be\ntaken as a beachmaster. This was my honest belief.\nMrs. Pownall then asked me to bring her the official news of\nher husband's death, and I said I would be sure to do so, if it\ncame. When the news actually arrived I was unavoidably pre-\nvented from fulfilling this promise. As far as I am aware, the\nonly news Mrs. Pownall received of her husband's death was a\nprivate telegram from Mr. [Knox . . .] to me. When I received\nit [this was on the Wednesday after the death] H. E. the Gover-\nnor was expected and I could not leave my office, and my tele-\ngram was communicated to Mrs. Pownall by Mrs. Limpus, wife of\nthe Admiral Superintendent. On my arrival at 2.0 p.m. (2 hours\nafter receiving the telegram) Mrs. Pownall was quite calm, and\ntold me that as soon as she saw Mrs. Limpus she knew she had\ncome to tell her her husband was dead. She was expecting the\nnews hourly.\nCaptain Esmond appends the following note to his accounts\nof the three incidents in which he was concerned :\nOctober 23, 1915.\nThe facts I have related above are absolutely true and I am\nprepared to swear to them, if necessary.\n(Signed) L. T. Esmond, Captain, . .\n.\nSome account of Lieut.-Commander Pownall himself is desir-\nable for a complete appreciation of this incident, and it will be\nmost convenient to give it at this point. He was an excep-\ntionally talented and able naval officer, and so far as it can be\nsaid of any one man in a service that contains so many men\nof great ability, there can be no doubt that his death is a\nserious loss to the Navy. Not only was he a master of his\nparticular business, but he also possessed considerable literary\nand other gifts, and was a most agreeable and interesting\n\f1916.

His appointment at Malta is evidence of tlie\nestimate which the Admiralty had formed of his abilities.\nYou have no doubt been wondering how an officer so\nvaluable for his proper and most important duties came to be\nengaged in one of the landing parties. One asks with some\nindignation and a bitter literalness, Que diahle aUait-il faire\ndans cette gaUre ? No authoritative explanation is likely to be\nobtainable, and we can only suppose that it was a case of\nsheer necessity. Similar things have happened before, and will,\nI imagine, happen again. It is small comfort for those who\nmourn for him, though it says much for our Naval Service,\nthat, as is shown by our later submarine successes in Turkish\nwaters, his command has evidently passed into no less able hands.\nI have said thus much of this officer\u2014and I would also\nremind you of Captain Esmond's opinion on the matter and of\nMr. Knox's remark on the removal to the transport\u2014in order\nthat it may be clearly seen how little reason, humanly speak-\ning, Mrs. Pownall had for supposing her husband would be in\nany special danger at the Dardanelles, and how she was least\nof all justified by any ordinary calculation of probabilities in\nher conviction that he had died as one of a landing party.\nWe have now to return to Malta. Mrs. Pownall spent the\nearlier part of the evening of April 25 (the day of the\ndeath and of her impression concerning it) alone in the house ;\nshe had allowed her maids to go out, and there are no\nchildren. She was sometimes on the first floor and sometimes\non the second, but on whichever floor she might be, she heard\nfrom time to time footsteps on the floor below ; the impression\nwas of human footsteps, but she did not otherwise distinguish\nthem. She went down three times to search, but found no\none. Becoming uneasy, she went out and induced a friend,\nMme. Davie, to come and spend the evening with her. She\ndid not mention the footsteps to her, nor her conviction of her\nhusband's death, but Mme. Davie also heard footsteps and also\nsearched twice for an explanation in vain. A letter has been\nwritten to the lady, asking for her confirmation on this point,\nbut no answer has been received. Mrs. Pownall thinks she\nmust have left Malta.\nIn London on this same night a dream was dreamed which\nonly perversity, as it seems to me, could dissociate from Mrs.\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan. -Feb.\nPownall's distress at her husband's death, of which she had\nbecome so strangely convinced. Before relating the dream I\nshould state that the \" John \" who appears in it is a brother\nof Mrs. Pownall who died in Sumatra in September, 1914. In\nview of the experiences accumulated in this paper, it is some-\nwhat remarkable that Mrs. Pownall had no premonition of her\nbrother's death nor any telepathic impression of any kind in\nconnexion with it, although he was her favourite brother and\nthere was a strong mutual affection between them. The dream\noccurred to a sister of Mrs. Pownall, Mrs. Grenfell White, and\nthe following is her account of it, with her husband's con-\nfirmation.\nNovember 6, 1915.\nOn a Sunday night last April I dreamt that I saw Vera [Mrs.\nGeorge Pownall] crying dreadfully, and I saw John very plainly,\nand he said to Vera, '\nI wish I could speak to you, but I can't.'\nWhen I woke up I said to my husband, '\nI knoiv something has\nhajDpened to George '\n; and I then went on to urge him very\nstrongly to remember what I was going to tell him, and in\nparticular to remember that I had told him before we had any\nknowledge that my forebodings were true. I then told him my\ndream, and my insistence made him remember the circumstances\nclearly. We afterwards learned that George was in fact killed on\nthat Sunday. I had not previously dreamt about John since his\ndeath in September 1911.\n(Signed; Thomasine Grenfell White.\n155 Sloane St., London.\nNovember 6, 1915.\nThe above is a true account of what occurred.\n(Signed) W. Grenfell White.\nOn the following day, Monday, April 26, although Mrs.\nPownall's impression of her husband's death was less painfully\nvivid, the conviction was as strong as ever, and she proceeded\nto tear up papers and letters and do other things which she\nwould not otherwise have done, in view of an early return to\nEngland. She actually told her maid that she would have no\nfurther need of her services.\nOn the next night, Tuesday, somewhere about midnight she\nsuddenly woke up in bed, and after a few minutes heard\nfootsteps in the street below. Her first thought was that it\n\f1910. Recent Cases of Premonition and Telepathy. 135\nwas Captain Esmond bringing her the news as he had promised,\nand she felt relieved when the steps went past the house.\nThis feeling, however, was followed by the thought, \" He will\nnot come ; Mrs. Limpus [^vife of Admiral Limpus] will bring\nme the news.\"\nOn the Wednesday morning Mrs. Pownall went out into the\ntown, and on her return at 1 o'clock found Mrs. Limpus\nwaiting for her with a telegram confirming all this sad fore-\nknowledge. The telegram ran as follows :\n\" Pownall killed\n25th beach party. [Knox.] \" Soon after this she received a\nnote from Captain Esmond saying he was very sorry that he\nhad been unavoidably prevented from fulfilling his promise to\nbring the news himself. As you will remember from his\nstatement, he also called at 2 o'clock.\nMrs. Pownall left for England on Monday, May 3, 1915, and\nthere was a curious premonition in connexion with her de-\nparture. The boats, which go weekly, normally come into\nMalta and leave again after a stay of a few hours. Mrs.\nPownall had expected to leave on Tuesday, May 4, but Captain\nEsmond had told her that the boat had been delayed and\nwould not come till the Thursday. On waking on Monday\nmorning at about 7.30 she felt convinced that the boat would\nleave at 11 o'clock that day, and at once got up and made\npreparations to start. She usually got up between 9 and 10,\nafter breakfasting in bed. At 9.30 she received a note from\nCaptain Esmond telling her that the boat would leave at 11\nthat day, and she started by it at that hour. In peace time\nthe boat was accustomed to leave in the afternoon, but after\nthe outbreak of the war, according to Mrs. Pownall's recol-\nlection, the hour varied. I do not know at what hour the\nboat came in on the morning in question, but I can think of\nno normal means by which Mrs. Pownall, lying in bed in her\nhouse, could become aware of its arrival, or indeed of the\narrival of any ship. Captain Esmond writes to me that he\ncannot remember anything in connexion with this incident\nbeyond the broad fact that \" the boat arrived two or three\ndays before she was expected and upset all the arrangements.\"\nThis, however, is fortunately all the corroboration we require.\nOn reaching England, Mrs. Pownall went to her parents in\nDevonshire, and stayed wdth them for about ten days. At\n\fI\n136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan. -Feb.\nthis time she had not been informed whether her husband had\nbeen womided in the head or in the body, nor whether he had\nor had not died instantaneously ; but she told her mother,\nwhile on this visit, that she was sure he had been shot in the\nback and had not died at once. Her mother has only a vague\nrecollection of this, but Mrs. Pownall is positive on all three\npoints. Some time in June she received a letter, dated May\n31, from the Chaplain on board the transport, informing her\nthat Lieut. -Commander Pownall had been wounded in the back\nand had lingered a few hours. She had not written to any one\nfor information on the point, and this was the first that had\nreached her. Before receiving this letter, Mrs. Pownall had\nreceived two others from the Dardanelles, one from an officer\nand one from an able seaman, but neither made any reference\nto the locality of the wound.\nThe next three experiences I give in Mrs. Pownall's own\nwords. She made no contemporary notes, but says that her\nrecollection is clear.\nOctober, 191.5.\nIn July 1915 I was staying at Eastbourne with Miss Bayfield,\nwho was driving a motor ambulance in the neighbourhood. Mr.\n[R. B. Knox] was also there on leave, expecting a fresh appoint-\nment. One day I told him he would get his appointment on such\nand such a day, naming a day of the week four days ahead. I\nremember counting the days as they went by. He obtained his\nappointment on the day I named.\n^\n(Signed) Vera Pownall.\nMr. Knox has sent the following confirmation of this, and\nfortunately has been able to supply the dates :\nIn July 1915 I was on leave at Eastbourne and was expecting\nan appointment.

Just\nas I was about to take it up I had the impression that I should\nfind among the casualties the name of Major Ash, of the Middle-\nsex Regiment, as either killed or wounded. On opening the paper\nand looking down the casualty lists I found his name among the\nwounded. I did not know Major Ash well, having only met him\nat Malta two or three times, and I had no particular interest in\nhim, though I knew Mrs. Ash fairly well while we were both at\nMalta. I had had a letter from her some three months before\nthis. I had not been thinking of Major or Mrs. Ash, and I did\nnot know whether he was on the Western Front or at the Darda-\nnelles, or indeed where he was. (Signed) Vera Pownall.\nThe next incident also occurred last month. I should state\nthat my daughter has for the last two months been tem-\nporarily living with Mrs. Pownall in London. I give the story\nas written down at their dictation, beginning with Mrs.\nPownall's account :\nAt about 7.15 p.m. on October 12, 1915, at my flat in London,\nI made the following note on the back of a tradesman's bill :\n\u2014\n'\nI feel that there will be a Zep. raid to-night or to-morrow at\n9.45 p.m. V. Pownall. Oct. 12.' For the rest of that day the\nmatter was entirely absent from my mind. On October 13 Miss\nBayfield and Mr. [J. Knox, Mr. R. E. Knox's] brother, dined with\nme at the flat at 7.15. During dinner I found it strangely\ndifficult to collect and control my thoughts, and seemed to myself\nto be in a state of suppressed excitement and expectancy, but I\nwas expecting nothing in particular. I did not think of Zeppelins,\nand I had entirely forgotten the memorandum written on the\nprevious evening. No thought of Zeppelins occurred to me until\nwe were standing outside in the street at about 5 minutes past 8,\nwhen Miss Bayfield said, '\nWhat a lovely night for Zeppelins !\n'\nThe night was clear and still. Even then I did not think of my\nnote. When we heard the first bomb dropped on London that\nevening we were in a theatre ; I at once remembered my memo-\nrandum and looked at my watch, which gave the time as 9.40.\nMy watch loses about 5 minutes each day, and I regulate it every\nmorning at about 9.30 by the clock on the Great Central Hotel,\nwhich I can see from my windows.

During dinner I noticed that\nVera seemed extraordinarily distraite and preoccupied. More than\nonce she did not reply when we spoke to her, and she seemed to\npay imperfect attention to what was going on. Also she talked\nhttle. All this was quite unusual with her, especially at dinner\nand when entertaining guests. 1 said to her something to the\nfollowing effect, '\nWhat is the matter with you ? I never knew\nyou so vague !\n'\nShe replied, '\nI feel something is going to happen.\n[ When I said this I did not think of Zeppelins.' Vera Pownall.]\nI said, '\nWhat ?\n'\nShe answered that she did not know. I then\nsaid, '\nTo whom 1\n'\nand she said, '\nTo all of us.' I said, '\nWhen ?\n'\nand she replied '\nOh, soon '\n[meaning, as Mrs. Pownall has ex-\nplained, within a day or so]. Then she apologised for being '\nso\nvague,' and we all laughed about it.\nAfter dinner we were going to a theatre. When Mrs. Pownall\nand I were putting on our things I said to her, '\nIs it going to\nhappen to you or me ? ', and she replied, '\nOh no ; we are all in\nit.' Either now or earlier I said to her, '\nIs it something awful ?\nand she answered, '\nNo.'\nWhile we were at the theatre we heard the bombs, and at the\nsound of the first or second Vera said to me, '\nI wrote that down\nyesterday and put it in my dressing-table drawer.'

The follomng is Mrs. PownalFs account of it :\nNovember IWi, 1915.\nYesterday morning, when I began to read the paper, I had it\nfixed in my mind that I should see \" British Submarine Lost \"',\nand I hunted through the paper expecting to see something\nabout it, but found nothing. A Commander from the Admiralty\ncame to luncheon, and at lunch I said to Cyrille and him, \" Did\nI dream it or did I see in yesterday's or to-day's paper that a\nBritish submarine had been lost ? Was it in any paper ?\n\" The\nCommander said, \" No,\" and also Cyrille.

E. Reinold, Comr.R.N.\nThis brings me to the end of my story, but if you are not\nalready wearied, I should like to add a few remarks on some\nof the incidents\u2014offering, perhaps, by the way, a few targets\nfor the discussion which I hope follow.\nA resolute critic, unconvinced even of telepathy, might\ndismiss this somewhat remarkable series of predictions as\nmerely so many examples of chance coincidence, accounting\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan.-Feb.\nperhaps for their number by a reference to the extraordinary\nruiis on the red or the black at Monte Carlo, and to other\nsimilar phenomena. I must confess that such a view would\nseem to me to be a fresh illustration of the surprising credulity\nof the incredulous, who, rather than accept a new truth which\nconflicts with their prepossessions, are ready to believe the\nincredible. The simplicity which would believe that we have\nhere to do with nothing but chance, would appear to be\ncapable of believing anything. This explanation, then, I\nunhesitatingly dismiss, and seek further afield.\nSeveral of the incidents are obviously explicable by telepathy\nbetween the living, and may be considered to strengthen the\nevidence for it\u2014perhaps to extend our conception of it. Three\nothers\u2014Admiral Garden's appointment, the dispatch of the\nsubmarines, and the Zeppelin raid\u2014may be so explained, if we\nmake certain assumptions ; but of the premonition of the\nvisit of Mrs. Limpus and some points of detail in other cases\ntelepathy seems to me to offer no explanation at all.\nTo take first the hallucination at Harwich, we may suppose\nthat Lieut. -Commander Pownall, being compelled to leave his\nnewly married wife alone for most of the day, was always\ndesirous of returning home as soon as his duties permitted.\nHe might often, consciously or unconsciously, while in the\nmidst of his work picture himself so returning. On this\nparticular afternoon a thought of the kind\u2014perhaps a \" high-\nexplosive \" one, so to speak, caused by an apparent chance of\nan early return afterwards found to be no chance\u2014may have\ncaught Mrs. Pownall at a favourable moment, and the visual\nhallucination was the result. One only wonders why hallu-\ncinations of this kind do not occur more often.\nTelepathy will explain the dream about Admiral Garden's\nappointment, if we make a wild and quite gratuitous assump-\ntion. The dream, you remember, occurred about August 12,\n1914. Now, the Goehen and Bieslau reached Constantinople\non August 10, and their escape caused much irritation in this\ncountry. At the Admiralty and in Government circles the\nirritation was no doubt acute. It is conceivable\u2014I do not\nventure to say that it is more than conceivable\u2014that someone\nthen in high ofiice, whose name I forbear even to guess, under\nthe stimulus of this irritating disappointment, flashed out a\n\f191C. Recent Gases of Premonition and Telepathy.\nvery highly explosive thought the impact of which was felt as\n\u2022\nfar as Malta\u2014the thought being something like this, \" X.\nmust be recalled, and Garden must have the Mediterranean\ncommand !\n\" Whether the thought was justifiable or not of\ncourse I do not discuss, and it does not matter ;\niior does it\nmatter that the change (which, as we know, was actually made)\ndid not take place till more than five weeks after the date of\nthe dream. This audacious suggestion is, of course, a mere\nfancy, but it is the best I can myself make in the interests of\ntelepathy. On its merits I attach small value to it, and I\nhave reasons for believing it to be improbable. I am not at\nliberty to impart these reasons, but those of you who have\nfriends in naval circles will perhaps be able to obtain infor-\nmation from which you can foim your own opinion on the\nmatter.\nSimilarly, the dispatch of the submarines could be explained\nby telepathy from the Admiralty, if the step was decided upon\nthere at a sufficiently early date. Perhaps we may some day\nbe allowed to learn how this was ; but in view of the fact\nthat the flotilla was ordered to leave at some twenty-four\nhours' notice, it does not seem likely that the matter was\ndiscussed and decided in London more than a day or two\nbefore. Otherwise one would have expected longer notice to\nbe given.\nThe incidents of the steamer, the womiding of Major Ash,\nand the loss of the British submarine obviously suggest a\ntelepathic explanation, since in each case some one knew the\nfacts before they reached Mrs. Pownall. With regard to Mr.\nKnox's appointment also, it is possible that somebody at the\nAdmiralty thought the thought, \" in 3 days' time we shall\nsend Mr. Knox notice of his appointment.\" All the same,\nboth the thought itself and the transference of just that\nthought on a trivial matter are nob easy to explain. As to\nMrs. Grenfell White's dream, which is veJdical on the only\npoint that we can test\u2014Mrs. Pownall's distress, telepathy,\nwhile it accounts for the knowledge of her grief, does not\naccount for the presence of the brother. Nor does it account\nfor the mysterious footsteps heard in the house at Malta the\nsame evening, which in view of the dream, it does not seem\nmerely fanciful to connect with him\u2014unless we are to connect\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan-.-Feb.\nthem Avith the husband. I do not mean that a spirit's foot-\nsteps may be audible ; but I can imagine that if my sub-\nliminal consciousness receives the impression of a spirit's\nl^resence or influence (I do not know what word to use), the\nimpression might emerge in the vague form of an hallucination\nof the sound of footsteps.^\nWith regard to the Zeppelin raid, we may say, if we like,\nthat Mrs. Pownall obtained her information fi'om the Germans\nin Belgium who were planning it. Ab first blush that may\nseem easy ; but we must remember that the only rap-port\nbetween them is a violent mutual repulsion, and the pro-\nduction of rap-port by repulsion seems unlikely. Moreover, as\nthese Germans presumably thought in German and Mrs.\nPownalFs knowledge of that language is extremely slight and\n(as I have proved by experiment) Cjuite insufficient to under-\nstand such a message as might be presumed,^ one must ask\nhow it came to be so conveniently translated in transit. Or\ncan such a thought (all the concepts which it embraces being\nfamiliar to the receiver) be transmitted from mind to mind,\nwithout the employment of language ? I am disposed to think\nthat this may be so, although, so far as I am aware, we have\nno recorded example of telepathy between people who do not\nunderstand each other's language. Even so, however, not all\nour difficulties are removed. How are we to explain Mrs.\nPownall's precise knowledge of the hour of the raid ? On the\ntelepathic hypothesis, the enemy proposed to himself to drop\nhis first bomb on London at 9.45 ; but if he did, we know\nenough of aerial navigation to be able to say that he was\n^ It was suggested by a speaker at the meeting that the hearing of foot-\nsteps may have been the result of expectation, but the suggestion seems\naltogether gratuitous. Why should there be any such expectation ? Mrs.\nPownall had never before had this hallucination, though she had frequently\nbeen alone in the house in the evening, and convinced as she was of her\nhusband's death, one would suppose that the last thing she would expect\nwould be to hear his footsteps ;\nmoreover, she did not distinguish them\nas a man's footsteps. It may be added that Lieut. -Commander Pownall had\nnever lived in this house ; Mrs. Pownall moved into it after he left Malta.\nMme Davie had not been told about the footsteps before sho thought she\nheard them herself, so that in her case it is equally difficult to imagine why\nshe should expect to hear them.\n- In the following sentence, \" Ein Viertel vor zehn, werden wir uber\nLondon ankommen,\"' the only word translated was iiber.\n\f1916.

In this case, therefore, telepathy cannot, I think,\nbe lightly allowed to have the last word. ^\nThe knowledge of her husband's death may well have been\napprehended by Mrs. Pownall telepathically ; the impression\nmay have been subliminally received at the moment of death,\nto emerge in some mysterious way through the handling of\nthe letter. There is, however, one point in this painful episode\nwhich telepathy does not wholly explain.\n]\\'Irs. Po^\\Tiall appears to have known for many months that\nher husband would be killed at the Dardanelles, and also, as\nI incline to think, that it would be on a Sunday. At any\nrate, she was possessed by an unshakable conviction on the\nformer point, and the conviction was justified by the event.\nShe did not, I believe, consciously expect bhat he would die on\na Simday, but her remarkable depressions on Sundays look\nlike the formless emergence of a subliminal impression to that\neffect.^ The depressions were peculiarly distressing and usually\nculminated in weeping. They began when she woke in the\n1 An article in the Observer of October 3 contained the following para-\ngraph :\n\"Sunset coming earher, the hours of the possible arrival of German\nairships over London is put forward, and this month we may expect them\nas early as 10 p.m. In November, December, and January, they might in\ncertain conditions get here before 9.30 p.m. ;\nand, other things being equal,\nthey will be a trifle less particular about the amount and direction of the\nwind during the winter, for they will have a greater duration of dark hours\nfor the job.\" Jlrs. Pownall takes the Observer and it must therefore be\npresumed that she read this article ; but even so we are not much helped.\nThe impression was not received until 10 days later, and \" as early as\n10 p.m.\" does not suggest 9.45.\n- Dr. Wingfield once told me of a patient, a young lady, who for a long\ntime had refused to go out of the house for fear that something dreadful\nwould happen to her, she knew not what. Suspecting this vague fear to be\nthe emergence of something more definite in the subliminal, he hypnotised\nher and told her to dream of the thing she was afraid of. On waking her,\nhe bade her make notes of her dreams and bring the notes to him. She\nbrought notes of some half-dozen, of which he selected one.

Nothing at all like them occurred on other days,\nand during the week, but for the one great trouble, Mrs.\nPownall preserved her normal cheerfulness. Of course, there\nare countless instances of people saying that they are \" con-\nvinced \" they will never again see someone dear to them, but\nthey do not mean more than that they greatly fear it will be\nso. Mrs. PownalFs other veridical predictions seem to forbid\nus to regard the present case as one of mere foreboding, and\nshe herself absolutely refuses to regard it as such. Every\nprediction of the future must be considered on its merits and\nin its own setting, and having regard to all the circumstances,\nI cannot persuade myself that we have not here a case of\nactual foreknowledge. With every desire to show common\nsense, I am unable to accept accidental coincidence as a\nsatisfactory explanation of the facts. But if it is a case of\nforeknowledge, how are we to account for it ? I can imagine\nthree possible views, and someone may suggest a fourth or\nmore.\nFirstly, we may suppose the information to have been\nconveyed by a spirit who had knowledge of the future.\nSecondly, we may suppose that the mind can of itself, and on\nits own initiative, travel into a world of thought where there\nis no past or future\u2014where all that is, all that has been, all\nthat is to be, is equally known and knowable. Thirdly, there\nis a supposition which those who find it difficult to believe that\nwe on earth ever come into contact with a spirit world, would\nperhaps prefer to either of these two. We may suppose that a\nman in perfect health may by some mysterious means come to\nhave, consciously or subliminally, a foreknowledge of the very\nday of his death many months before it takes place\u2014and that,\nalthough his death is to be a violent one, and not due to some\ndisease whose rudimentary existence the subliminal may be\nsupposed to be capable of noting, while it is also able to\nforecast and to time with accuracy its fatal development. We\nmay suppose that Lieut. -Commander Pownall had this fore-\nknowledge and was unable to prevent the communication of it\ntelepathically to his wife. This idea is not to be hastily\nrejected ; but it must be admitted that it transcends normal\nexperience quite as outrageously as does the idea of communi-\n\f1916.

It is, however,\nthe explanation offered by Professor Flournoy of a case of\nforeknowledge of death from disease described in his book\nEsprits et Mklimns. That case, which is very well attested, is\nso remarkable that I gave a summary of it in a review of the\nbook in Vol. XXV. of the Proceedings. Since it may be\nthought to lend some support to this last theory, I will give\na bare outline of the story here. For convenience, I accord the\ndates to the Kussian calendar, which is twelve days behind ours.\nA certain Mme Buscarlet of Geneva, after acting for three\nyears as governess to the two little daughters of M. and Mme\nMoratief at Kasan in Russia, returned to Geneva in August,\n1883. At Kasan she became acquainted with a Mme Nitchinof\nand a Mile Olga Popoi. Mme Nitchinof was headmistress of\nthe Institut ImpSrial at Kasan, a school which Mme Moratief's\ndaughters began to attend after Mme Buscarlet's departure, and\nshe and her husband were intimate friends of the Morafciefs.\nOn December 10 (our 22nd) Mme Buscarlet wrote a letter to\nMme Moratief, but did not post it till the 12th, and it reached\nKasan on the 20th. Professor Flournoy saw both the letter\nand the envelope with the Geneva and Kasan postmarks.\nAfter about a page of Christmas greetings, the letter goes on\nas follows. It is written in French, but I translate, omitting\nall that is not essential.\nLast night I had an absurd dream. . . . You and I were on a\ncountry road, when there passed in front of us a carriage from\nwhich came a voice calling you. When we got to the carriage\nwe saw Mile Olga Popoi lying stretched across it inside, dressed in\nwhite and wearing a cap trimmed with yellow ribbons. [Mme\nBuscarlet told Professor Flournoy that the cap also was white,\nand that she had seen the body of a lady invested for burial in\nthis manner in Russia.] She said to you, '\n1 have called you in\norder to tell you that Mme Nitchinof leaves the Institute on the\n17th.' The carriage then drove on. How ludicrous dreams are\nsometimes.\nAfter this the letter turns to other subjects.\nIn a letter written in reply and dated Kasan, December 20\n(the day on which Mme Buscarlet's letter arrived), M. Moratief\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, Jan. -Feb.\nwrote to Mme Buscarlet that he and his wife had dined at\nMme Nitchinof's house on the 13th, which was four days\nafter the dream. After dinner Mme Nitchinof felt unwell, but\na doctor who arrived immediately diagnosed nothing more than\nan ordinary slight sore-throat {une simple et Ugere angine). On\nthe 14th and 15th the doctors, three in number, failed to find\nanything alarming, and only on the morning of the 16th was\nthe illness recognised as scarlet fever. At 5 p.m. on that day\nthe patient could hardly speak, and at 11.45 the same night\nshe died. For fear of infection, the body was removed from\nthe school to a neighbouring chapel at 2 a.m. on the 17th.\nThus Mme Nitchinof did indeed \" leave the Institute \" on the\n17th. Mile Olga Popoi's intrusion into the dream is unex-\nplained.\nThere remains one final puzzle. If Mrs. Pownall had ex-\npected that ofiicial news of her husband's death would be sent\nto Admiral Limpus, she might naturally suppose that it would\nbe brought on to her by Mrs. Limpus. Questioned on this\npoint Mrs. Pownall wrote :\n\" I could not possibly have expected\nAdmiral or Mrs. Limpus to bring me the news. Ofiicial news\nof the death of a Naval ofiicer always comes straight from the\nAdmiralty to the wife or nearest relative. About a fortnight\nafter George was killed I had a letter from the Admiralty\ntelling me of his death. I arranged with Mr. [Knox] that,\nshould anything happen to George, he was to send a telegram\nto Captain [Esmond].\" Now, Mr. Knox's private telegram to\nCaptain Esmond arrived in Malta at noon on the Wednesday,\nand until a few minutes after that no one on earth could\nknow by any normal means, nor even by telepathy, that the\nnews would be brought to Mrs. Pownall by Mrs. Limpus.\nHer intervention was the outcome of an accident which did not\nhappen till noon on that day. How, then, could Mrs. Pownall\nknow of it twelve hours before ?\nThe following considerations, which I present because they\noccurred to me and might be thought to touch the point,\nreally afl:ord no solution of the mystery. In asking Captain\nEsmond to \" bring her the ofiicial news \" Mrs. Pownall seems\nto have had some dim notion that it might be officially\ntelegraphed to Malta direct from the Dardanelles, though on a\nmoment's reflection she would have remembered that head-\n\f1916. Recent Gases of Premonition and Telepathy. 147\nquarters authorities communicate casualties only to the Admir-\nalty or the War Office. She was well aware of this. Such a\ntelegram, if sent\u2014though passing, as did all official telegrams,\nthrough Captain Esmond's hands\u2014would have been addressed,\nshe thinks, to Admiral Limpus. She tells me she never thought\nof this until I questioned her on the point ; her only thought\nwas that Captain Esmond was always the first recipient of\nofficial news, and she had forgotten for the moment her\narrangement with Mr. Knox. Moreover, even if it had occurred\nto her that an official telegram from the Dardanelles would be\naddressed to the Admiral, she would not have thought of Mrs.\nLimpus as a possible messenger ; she would have felt sure that\nCaptain Esmond, when forwarding the telegram to the Admiral,\nwould at the same time inform him that he had promised to\nbreak the news to her himself, if it should come.\nNOTE.\nNovember 22, 1915.\nI have read Mr. Bayfield's paper, and declare that it faith-\nfully describes my experiences and the facts connected with\n(Signed) Vera Pownall.\nNOTE ON A CURRENT PERIODICAL.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research\nfor November, 1915, contains a report by Dr. Hyslop on some\nsittings with Mrs. Chenoweth, at which interesting results were\nobtained. The sittings were held under the following circumstances.\nA lady of whom Dr. Hyslop knew nothing wrote to him from\nGermany asking if he could recommend a \" psychic \" to her,\nas she had recently lost her husband and wished, if possible,\nto get into communication with liim. Dr. Hyslop knew of\nno psychic in Grermany, and the lady, Mrs. Tansch, was unable\nto come to America, but she sent an article which had belonged\nto her husband, and her sister, then living in Boston, had some\nsittings with Mrs. Chenoweth on her belialf. Mrs. Tausch's\nhusband had been professor in a small Western University in\nAmerica, and had returned to his old home in Germany shortly\nbefore his death.\nDr._ Hyslop made all the arrangements for the sittings himself,\nand imposed, he says, the usual conditions, that is to say, he\ndid not tell the sitter, Mrs. Tausch's sister, the 'name of the\nmedium to whom he was proposing to take her, and Mrs.\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan.-Fkb. 1916.\nChenoweth, who had been given no information in regard to\nthe sitter, was entranced before the latter entered the room.\nAt the beginning of the first sitting a sign was made which\nin Mrs. Chenoweth's automatic writing habitually represents\nProfessor William James, and in reply to an enquiry it was\nso interpreted here. Subsequently Jennie P., one of Mrs.\nChenoweth's habitual \" controls,\" enquired whether the spirit\nwho wished to communicate was associated with any one called\nWilliam. Dr. Hyslop asked her whether she meant William\nJames, and she said she did not know. Later on again, when\nProfessor Tausch himself was purporting to communicate, the\nfollowing dialogue took place\n:\nI wish to prove to them all that I was not a fool to be interested in this\nbelief of spirit ... I also had some records I had been much interested in.\n(Yes, do you mean they were your own ?).\nNo.\n(Whose ?).\nOthers. My personal experience was limited.\n'\n(Yes, do you know whose records they were ?).\nYes, J. had some.\n(Let me be sure what the J. is for.)\nMy friend James.\nCommenting on this, Dr. Hyslop says ^\nNow Professor James was a friend of the communicator, and Mrs. Tausch\nwrote in response to my enquiries that Professor James had given them\nrecords to read and they had done so. Of course I knew nothing of this\nfact, and indeed nothing of the man and his life.\nPreviously to her question about the \" man named William,\"\nJennie P., on being asked what the communicator's work had\nbeen, said that it was \" philosophical \" and \" he philosophized\nabout everything.\" He had in fact been a professor of philosophy.\nSeveral other small incidents and peculiarities were correctly\ndescribed, and in \" the subliminal stage of the recovery \" the\nletters T h T were given. They were interpreted by the\n\" subliminal \" as Theodore, the name of a previous communicator.\nDr. Hyslop made no comment on this beyond saying that the\nname Theodore had no relevance. At the second sitting \" without\nany help \" the name Tausch was given, variously, but never quite\ncorrectly spelt. It should be noted that Tausch was not the\nsitter's name, and assuming, as Dr. Hyslop implies,, that care\nwas taken not to mention the name in the medium's presence,\nthis is a good piece of evidence for knowledge supernormally acquired.\nIn conclusion, Dr. Hyslop points out that the interest of the\ncase lies especially in the fact that the communicator made several\ncorrect and distinctive statements about himself for the verification\nof which it was necessary to apply to Mrs. Tausch in Germany, as\nthe facts were unknown either to Dr. Hyslop or to the sitter.\nIt would be interesting to see the complete record of these\ntwo sittings, and perhaps Dr. Hyslop will give us this opportunity\nlater.

H. Salter read a paper by Mrs. A. W. Verrall\non A Series of Experiments in \" Guessing,\"' which will be\npubhshed later in the Proceedings.\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1915.\nDuring the past year, as might be expected, the Society\nhas again felt the effect of the war, and we have to report\na further decrease in membership.\nIn the course of the year 7 new Members were elected,\nand 2 Associates became Members ; 34 new Associates were\nelected, and 8 Members became Associates. On the other\nhand, the total loss in numbers, from resignations, deaths\nand other causes, was 24 Members and 113 Associates, making\na net decrease of 96.\nThis decrease in membership is due to a diminution in\nthe number of candidates for election rather than to an\nincrease in the number of resignations ; for whereas in 1915\nthe number of elections was 41 (including 7 Members), the\naverage number for the five years preceding the war, 1909-1913,\nwas 122 (including 21 Members), and on the other hand the\nnumber of resignations in 1915 was only 98, as against an\naverage of 63 for the years 1909-1913. We think that under\nthe present circumstances, it is a matter for congratulation\nthat the increase in the number of resignations is not larger,\n\fMarch, 1916. Report of Council for the Year 1915. 153\nand we are glad to record that many members, when writing\nto resign, have expressed their appreciation of the Society's\nwork and their hope of rejoining later.\nThe total membership is now 1116, the numbers being\ndistributed as follows : Members, 263 (including 27 Honorary\nand Corresponding Members) ;\nAssociates, 853 (including 11\nHonorary Associates).\nWe drew attention last year to the marked falling off in\nthe sale of publications which took place after the outbreak\nof war, and the sale in this country continues to be\nmuch below the average. The amount realised during 1915\nby the sale of publications to members at the Rooms of\nthe Society was \u00a319 10s. 6d., whereas the average annual\nreceipts for the five years 1909-1913 were \u00a346 lis. Id. ; and\nthe amount realised in 1915 through our London agent by\nthe sale of publications to persons who are not members of\nthe Society was \u00a339 6s. 6d., whereas the average for the\nfive years preceding the war was \u00a382 Os. 7d. In each case\nit will be seen that the receipts last year were less than\nhalf the average. On the other hand, the amount realised\nin 1915 by the sale of publications in America was \u00a316 13s. lid.\nthe average for the years 1909-1913 being \u00a319 10s. 6d. It\nwill be seen that the decrease in this case is far less marked,\nand this strengthens the probability that the decrease in the\nother sales is due to the war, since this would naturally have\nless effect in America than in England.\nThe decrease in our membership and in the sale of publica-\ntions, together with the discontinuance of all subscriptions\nfrom hostile countries, has inevitably caused a considerable\ndiminution in the income of the Society, and we propose,\nif necessary, to meet this diminution by using part of the\nincome from the Endowment Fund. This income now amounts\nto about \u00a3280 per annum, and the intention had been that\nit should be allowed to accumulate longer.\nIt is not only financially that the Society has been affected\nby the war. Its activities have been to some extent restricted\nby the fact that many of those upon whose co-operation we\nusually reckon are now engaged in war-work. Thus, Mr.\nFeilding is engaged on Government work, Dr. M'Dougall is\nin charge of the Neurological Section of the Royal Victoria\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Maech, 1916.\nHospital, Netley, and Dr. Woolley is working in a military\nhospital at Tooting. The majority, in fact, of our medical\nmembers are now working in war-hospitals. Amongst the\ncases which have come mider their observation are some\nwhich throw an interesting light on the problems of psycho-\ntherapeutics, cases, for example, of \" shell-shock,\" so that\nalthough the energies of these members are at present diverted\nfrom psychical research, we hope that our Medical Branch\nmay reap the benefit of their experiences when the war\nis over.\nThe deflection of public interest into other channels has\nbeen shown by a decrease in the enquiries and correspondence\nreceived by the Secretary, and by the smaller number of\nreaders in the Library.\nThe number of well-evidenced spontaneous cases which\nwe receive from or through our members continues, we think,\nto be disappointing. One might perhaps have expected that\nthe war, with its large tale of casualties and with the in-\ncreased emotional tension accompanying it, would have pro-\nduced a number of interesting experiences, and indeed the\nimportant paper read by Mr. Bayfield at the meeting on\nNovember 22nd, does deal with those of one percipient. But\non the whole, evidence of apparitions at the time of death\nor wounding has been conspicuous by its absence. Such\ncases have doubtless occurred, but practically none of those\nwhich have reached us have come up on investigation to\nthe standard of evidence required. There was, for instance,\none where the parents of a soldier reported that they had\ndreamt of him, and his sister that she had seen a vision of\nhim, on the night he was killed. But no first-hand evidence\nof their having mentioned their experiences before they knew\nof the death was forthcoming. Another case reporting that\na vision of a son by his mother had occurred at the time\nof his death, turned out to have no foundation whatever.\nIn a third case (not, however, a war case) which looked\npromising, leave to publish even anonymously has been refused\non religious grounds.\nWe have enquired, so far as was possible, into two matters\nconnected with the war which seemed likely to be of some\ninterest to the Society.\n\fMarch, 1916. Report of the Council for the Year 1915. 155\n(a) In the Journal for December, 1914, we inserted a notice\nasking for first-hand information concerning the alleged passing\nof Kussian troops through this country in August, 1914.\nWe entered into this enquiry with the idea that if the reports\nabout these troops should prove entirely without foundation,\nthe case would be psychologically interesting as a remarkable\ninstance of the speed with which a false rumour may spread.\nWe did not receive a large number of replies to our enquiry,\nbut the most probable conclusion to be drawn from those\nthat were sent us is that these rumours, hke many others,\nwere composed of a large superstructure of fancy built on\na small basis of fact.\nThere seems to be little doubt that Eussian soldiers were\nactually seen in this comitry during August, 1914, and this\ncan be accounted for by the fact that a certain number of\nRussian stalf-ofiicers were in England at the time, accompanied\nby their orderhes. The behef that these Russian troops were\nvery numerous was encouraged by the accidental circumstance\nthat just at that date large numbers of Territorials were\nbeing moved from the north of Scotland southwards, which\naccoimts for the numerous reports of troop trains thundering\nall night through junctions. This is the explanation of the\n\" Russian myth \" which was quoted in the Times of April\n29th, 1915, on the authority of Mr. H. B. Steele, Hon. Secre-\ntary of the Press Representatives' Committee at the Press\nBureau.\nFrom several statements which have reached us it seems\nhkely that the \" materialising \" energy of these Russian ghosts\nwas further increased by the fact that during this same month\nof August, 1914, a substantial body of Russian reservists\npassed through this country on their way home from America.\nThese men, of course, were not in uniform, but their nationality\nwas likely to become known in any places through which\nthey passed, and so the tale of \" Russian troops in England\n\"'\ngrew yet more.\nThe psychological moral to be drawn from this incident is\nthat human testimony is of very little scientific value, unless\nit is of a definite character and given at first-hand\u2014a con-\nclusion often suggested by our investigations and still further\nreinforced by another recent enquiry.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1916.\n(6) In the early part of last year stories began to be widely\nprevalent concerning the alleged \" visions of angels \" on the\nbattlefields in France and Belgium. In the Jiily Journal\nwe printed a notice asking oui' readers to send us, if they\ncould, first-hand accounts of these supposed apparitions.\nThe correspondence which resulted from this request was\nvoluminous, and a report upon it appeared in the December\nJournal. The result of the enquiry was in the main negative.\nWe were unable to obtain any satisfactory evidence at first-\nhand, and it became apparent that in weighing such evidence\nas was available, a large allowance must be made for exaggera-\ntion and inaccuracy.\nAttention has sometimes been drawn to the fact that much\nof the best evidence for experimental telepathy was obtained\nin the early days of the Society, and that there has been\na falling ofi^ in this respect in recent years. As the remedy\nfor this would be that more people should interest themselves\nin the subject and try experiments, a notice was printed\nin the Journal for February saying that the Society was\nanxious to try some further experiments in telepathy and\ninviting members and their friends to offer themselves as\nsubjects. Ten members responded to this invitation, with\nseven of whom experiments were conducted in the course\nof the spring on over thirty occasions. The number of\nexperiments which took place on each occasion ranged from\nabout three to six, and two, or sometimes three persons took\npart in each experiment.\nThe conditions of these experiments varied ;\nusually both\nthe agent and the percipient were at the Rooms of the Society,\nbut in one instance only the agent was there, the percipient\nbeing at a distance. In three cases the percipients were\nhypnotised, or at least an attempt was made to hypnotise\nthem ; with the other four percipients hypnotism was not\nemployed. No attempt was made on any occasion to hypno-\ntise the agent. The subjects chosen for transmission included,\n(a) visual images of various kinds, diagrams, pictures, etc.,\nand (6) action.\nExcept in the case of one percipient, these experiments must\nbe reckoned as failures, that is to say, the degree of success\nwas never beyond what might be accounted for by chance-\n\fMarch, 1916. Report of the Council for the Year 1915. 157\ncoincidence. As regards the one exception, it should be noted\nthat only a very small measure of success was obtained as long\nas the series of experiments was conducted under conditions\nsimilar to those which obtained in the other series. Subse-\nquently, however, it was arranged that the percipient, Mrs.\nStuart Wilson, should try some experiments with Mrs. Salter ^\nin connection with Mrs. Salter's automatic writing. Interesting\nresults followed, and it is hoped that a report upon them\nwill be published later.\nSome of our members are inclined to complain that so\nmuch attention is now devoted to the study of automatic\nwriting, and we may therefore observe that this circumstance\nis not wholly due to the perversity oi investigators.\nIn the present case it was not the intention of those who\narranged these experiments that they should be in any way\nconcerned with automatic writing, but the fact remains that\nuntil this element was introduced the result of the experiments\nwas of very little interest.\nIn the Lent Term, 1915, Mrs. Salter gave a course of\nlectures on psychical research to third-year students in psycho-\nlogy at King's College, University of London. Considerable\ninterest was shown in the subject, and Mrs. Salter was asked\nto repeat the course in the following October Term. This,\nhowever, she was unable to do on account of her marriage.\nAn interesting Presidential Address was delivered in July\nby Professor Gilbert Murray, and we hope to publish it later,\ntogether with a detailed report on some experiments in thought-\ntransference carried out by Professor Murray himself, upon\nwhich the conclusions suggested in his address were largely\nbased.\nWe have to record with regret the death, as a result of\nthe sinking of the Lusitania, of Mr. E. W. Friend, who was\nfor a time Assistant Secretary to the American Society for\nPsychical Research, and had already published several in-\nteresting articles in the American Journal.

He may be wrong in so regard-\ning them, but it is wort^h while calling attention to the\npossibility that the fact may be evidence of the supernormal\nwithout deciding the issue between two types of it.\nThe ground for suspecting clairvoyance in the case is that\nin nearly all cases the knowledge of the percipient was rather\nof the physical objects in the environment of the agent\nthan always the special object thought of, though usually the\nobject thought of was also evidently in the mind of the\npercipient. But in two cases the intended thought of the\nagent was not received. This is noticeable especially in experi-\nments 4 and 14. In the first of these two the intention was\nto communicate the idea of War, and the physical object\nplaced before the agent was a map of Bulgaria. Something\nsquare and dark was \" seen \" by the percipient, but no hint\nof the idea of war. In the fourteenth experiment the object\nthought of was a Madonna and Child, and the picture was\non the wall of the room where the agent was sitting. But\nwhat the percipient \" saw \" was a coin which might be inter-\npreted as an obscure perception of the face and halo.\nIn the other instances, at least all but one, the objects\nmentioned by the percipient could have been perceptively\n\" seen \" and not telepathically \" perceived.\" If the experi-\nments had not been conducted with emphasis on external\nobjects, the coincidence between telepathic and clairvoyant\nperception could not have been observed. It seems to the\npresent writer that obscure perception of the objects instead\nof telepathic access to the agent's mind is just as possible\nan interpretation as the telepathic one.\nTo decide the issue in such cases something should be\nintently thought of that is not associated with the objects\nbefore the agent, and if those thoughts are obtained, the\nobjection from clairvoyance would not apply. It seems that\nmotions and physical objects are, or were regarded as more\nor less necessary to success, and the experiments were con-\nducted under that view. This makes no difference when\nyou are testing the hypothesis of the supernormal, but in deciding\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1916.\nthe question between telepathy and clairvoyance, we should\nhave to see that the thought to be conveyed had no natural\nor necessary connection with the objects and the motions\nperformed. I do not deny the possibility of giving the pheno-\nmena a telepathic interpretation, but it is just as possible\nto give them a clairvoyant interpretation. It may be im-\npossible to experiment in these instances without resorting\nto methods that threaten these two separate interpretations\nwith a conflict, but it might be well to try a series in the\nmanner suggested. I do not think the issue of the super-\nnormal is involved ; for I think the coincidences are hardly\ndue to chance. But the interpretation of them may be debated.\nJames H. Hyslop.\n[The December number of the Journal of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research contains a more detailed review\nby Dr. Hyslop of these same experiments. In this review\nhe also takes into account some earlier experiments by the\nMisses Tippiiig- -not published in our Proceedings\u2014which he\nconsiders as strengthening the evidence for telepathy against\nclairvoyance.\nIt should be noted in connexion with Dr. Hyslop's argument\nthat telepathy can only be eliminated as a possible cause\nby eliiTiinating the agent altogether. Experiments on these\nlines have been tried, but %vith scant success, and the\nburden of proof lies therefore with the advocates of clair-\nvoyance. H. DE G.

It is naturally impossible to\nsummarize the detail of so elaborate a study in this Journal, but\nsome idea may be given of its contents. The mystic in question\nis the principal of a flourishing girls' school in French Switzerland,\nintelligent and educated, energetic, healthy though hard-worked,\nand very religious. Nevertheless she had inherited from her\n\fMaech, 1916. Note on a Current Periodical. 1Q3\nmother's side a certain neuropathic tendency which had been\ndeveloped in consequence of her personal experiences into painful\nobsessions, to be relieved of^ which she had appealed to Prof.\nFlournoy in December, 1910. He treated her (at first) by hyp-\nnotism and suggestion, and the revelations contained in his study\nare an eloquent proof of how completely he won her ponfidence.\nThe narrative consists largely of confidential and contemporaneous\nreports of her experiences to her spiritual director which were\nwritten without any suspicion that they would ever be published.\nIn the autumn of 1912 the '\nmystical ' developments of Mile\n'\nCecUe Ve's '\npsychic life began by her feeling conscious from time\nto time of the presence of an invisible Friend or Helper who\nsympathized with her troubles. Prof. Flournoy compares him to\nthe '\nLeopold ' of '\nHelene Smith,' but the religious model and\ninspiration of the phenomenon are obvious. After being consoled\nby this spiritual visitor for six months, in March, 1913, '\nMile Ve,'\nbeing then 50 years of age, had her first taste of the mystical\nexperience of ecstasy. Her description of it certainly accords very\nremarkably with those which Roman Catholic mystics have ren-\ndered classical, and the confirmation of them by one holding very\ndefinitely Protestant views seems valuable testimony to the objec-\ntive reality of the experience, even though it is perhaps unfor-\ntunate that '\nMile Ve '\nappears to have been already acquainted\nwith the famous account of mysticism in James's Varieties of\nReligious Experience. At any rate, it is important to note that\nthough she was irresistibly impressed with her experiences, she\nnever became incapable of a certain critical reserve, perhaps\nbecause they did not accord with her spiritual tastes. The God\nshe desired was a personal being ; the '\ndivine '\nshe encountered\nseemed the irruption of something wholly impersonal, and '\nbeyond\ngood and evil '\nin the Nietzschean phrase she unconsciously\nadopted, a manifestation of power, not of love. Moreover, part of\nthe price paid for contact with it was the total extinction of\npersonal being ; the rest was made up of anticipatory fears and\nhesitations and physical pains and distresses that followed upon\nthe ecstasy. All these drawbacks of the mystical experience are\ndescribed with the utmost vividness and candour, so that the\ncritical reader, who has not the experience but only descriptions\nof it to go upon, cannot but feel that the question of the moral\nvalue of mysticism will sooner or later have to be raised. And\nthis whether the phenomenon is regarded as merely subjective\n\f1.64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1916.\nand psychological or as attesting a reality that transcends the\nmystic's personality. After all the experience may have to be\nregarded as emanating from something diabolical rather than\ndivine, if its consequences turn out to be predominantly bad. Or\npossibly, if moral interpretations are ruled out, the '\nmystical\n'\nexperience may tell us what death feels like. However this may\nbe, it should be noted that between the 2nd March, 1913, and\nthe 31st July, 1914,\n'\u2022\nMUe Ve '\nhad 31 ecstasies. Then the war\ncame and upset her school, and imposed on her fresh demands of\nsocial service, thus switching off her energies from preoccupation\nwith the state of her soul. Few will contend that this suppression\nof '\nMile Ve's '\nmystical experience is either a justification or a\ncondemnation of the war ; but it is a curious fact. At any rate,\nwe may feel that the subsequent incidents of '\nMile Ve's '\nspiritual\ncareer are sure to be of interest to psychologists, and psychical\nresearchers will doubtless note also that in Prof. Flournoy's\nopinion her endowment is distinctly '\nmediumistic,' and that she\nmight have developed into a good '\nmedium '\nif her religious\nconvictions had not given her a strong prejudice against spiritism.\nF.

April, 1916.\nIN MEMORIAM\u2014EDWIN WILLIAM FRIEND.\nBoTtN June 15, 1886\u2014Died Ma^ 7, 1915.\nIn this period of flux, when we of America are perhaps sun-\ndered more completely from old ideals than you of Europe and\neven less advanced towards new, a pioneer is a precious man\nto us. When that man is a scholar trained, his value is more\nthan doubled, and his loss the greater. When Edwin Friend\nwent down with the Lusitania his loss was more than a\npersonal matter, for he was one of the few who combine keen\nmind with deep moral purpose and bold aspiration in philo-\nsoplxical research. Like many a young thinker he felt the\nstress and strain of our industrialized society, saw the pro-\ngressive disintegration of our applied philosophies of life, and\ndeeply deplored the almost universal tendency to materialism.\nUnlike most, however, he refused to stop at barren discontent,\nbut spent his whole energy in looking for the promise of a\ncure.\nFor this reason there was in his interest in psychical research\na determination, immixed with lax mysticism, to plumb those\ndepths of our existence that science has so far left uncharted.\nFriend's method and his true value can only be understood\nwhen considered in the light of his training and development.\nBorn in Indianapolis, in the Middle West,' he grew up among\n\" practical \" people, pioneers and the children of pioneers who\nhad no bent for speculation, no great interest in education.\nHis own father, far from supporting him in his desire to learn,\ndiscouraged him from any ambition but the accepted business\ncareer. But it chanced that he and two or three companions,\ndrawn by a common interest or curiosity for knowledge, began\nto study and experiment in the exact sciences with results\nwhich carried them far beyond the ordinary preparatory school\nwork. Thus at thirteen or fourteen a group was formed so\nintimately bound by a spirit of research that through the later\nyears of high-school and university life it persisted.\nYoung Friend was most active in his studies of physics,\nchemistry, biology, geology and the like. But the breadth of\nhis point of view and the idealism of the boy are well shown\nin a paper he wrote when barely fourteen, in which he de-\n\fApeil, 1916. In Memoriam\u2014Edivin William Friend. 167\nscribes the student of to-day, the investigator in new fields, as\na modern knight-errant, giving his Ufe to a glorious journey\nthrough science, exploring for the good of mankind. Though it\nis written in the florid vocabulary of a youngster who has read\nalmost too much of the world classics, the devotion to an\nideal which dominated his later life is already revealed. The\nboy shows the aspirations of the man.\nHe had already become interested in modern languages\nbefore he entered Harvard University, and this interest carried\nhim, before he left, into a deep study of Greek, Latin and\nSanscrit. He acquired languages with facility, for he grasped\nso completely the spirit of each that its construction and\nsyntax seemed natural aiid easy. French and German he\nmastered thoroughly enough to pass as a native in either\ncountry, while he read Italian, Russian, Swedish and Flemish\nwithout difficulty. This linguistic preparation, which would have\nbeen a life work for many men, was merely the backgroimd\nand the tool of an impelling interest in philosophy and psycho-\nlogy. This greater interest of his which we have seen fore-\nshadowed by the childish essays of years before was matured\nby the lectures of such men as Hoyce and James, and possibly\neven more by wide reading coupled with a constant intellectual\nintercourse with friends. The early Indianapolis group, far\nfrom breaking dov\\Ti, was a dominating influence of his univer-\nsity career, for these friends had gone on with him to Harvard.\nThese men lived together, studied and talked, kept their\ndifferentiating interests bound by a common breadth of view,\nand, through a realization of the larger miity of their lives,\nmade their discussions training-schools of thought.\nIn 1908 Friend received his Bachelor's degree, in 1909 his\nMaster's degree, and in the autumn of 1910 he left for Berlin\non a travelHng fellowship in philosophy. Knowing the language\nalready almost perfectly, he met no barrier in his effort to feel\nthe contact of German thought. The lectui'es, and, even more,\nthe exchange of ideas with German students\u2014for his very\npresence bred deep discussion\u2014were doubtless important in\ngiving him a new angle in his point of view, but he conceived\na distaste for what he felt to be the growing materialism of\nmodern Germany. Like many other foreign students there who\nescape the lure of material perfection, he was repelled by the\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Aphil, 1916.\nnational philosophy of the relation of the individual to the\nstate.\nAt the end of this year he returned to the United States to\nteach Latin and Greek at Princeton University. There he\nremained two years, making warm friends particularly among\nhis students. His ability to breed interest in a subject from\nhis own deep interest, to make the past vital to the present,\nproved him an admirable teacher. He was increasingly con-\nscious, however, that not even his deep sympathy for the\nclassics could reconcile him to the teaching of mere language.\nFor this reason he accepted gladly the opportunity which\noffered itself to him two years later, to go to Harvard as\nassistant in philosophy. There the time was passed in teaching\nand in further study on his own part.\nThis slight sketch of Edwin Friend's early career has,\nperhaps, given a fairly definite indication of what the man's\ninterests were to become. Grounded early in science, the real\ntendency of his mind was to speculation. The vague idealism\nof the fourteen-year-old boy had become passionate interest\nin philosophy in the young man. But, just as he had felt\nscience to be knight-errantry in the service of mankind, so he\ndeemed philosophy a means and living truth the end. During\nhis college course he had come upon Myers's great book on the\nsurvival of human personality, and this was probably the\nturning-point in his life, the event that formed him. He\neagerly consumed the two volumes, and, fired with enthusiasm,\nread long passages to his group of friends, leading them in\nlong discussions which were to result in moulding once for all\nhis life purpose.\nThrough the rest of his university work, through his years\nat Berlin and Princeton, his deep interest in psychical research\nnever flagged. James had said to him, at one time, that he\nconsidered psychical research the most important scientific\ninvestigation of the twentieth century, and this judgement\nFriend took to liimself. When in the spring of 1914 he was\nasked to become the assistant secretary of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research, he accepted the offer, and took\nup the double task of editing the Journal and of investigation.\nNot the least of Friend's qualifications for this work was his\nrange of interests. His omnivorous reading, which he had\n\fApril, 1916. In Memoriam\u2014Edwin Williavi Friend. 169\ncarried on from his first school-days, and of late years in three\nor four languages, had given him the breadth of background\nnecessary to a man who would face the world with an un-\npopular new hypothesis. This, with his philosophical training\nand his inherent feeling for logic and method, led him to\norganize in his mind the scattered phenomena of the great\nfield of psychic research. He died too soon to have made\nmore than the merest beginnings of this synthesis, but those\nwho have talked with him or who have read his few articles\nare aware of a fluency of idea, striking in logic and coherence.\nIn the actual routine of his work, if one may speak of the\nroutine of such a subject, was the sympathetic application of\nmodern critical methods of investigation. His wife, whom he\nmarried in the early summer of 1914, had previously done\nsome automatic writing, though with negligible results. She\nnow developed into an automatist of considerable power, and\nit was largely through her work that his researches were\npursued.\nThe material thus obtained was largely of philosophic nature.\nFriend felt keenly the significance of the moie specific evi-\ndential matter which goes to make up the scientific proof of\nsurvival. He realized, however, that in the case under his\nobservation, development of the automatist could best be\nfurthered by careful consideration on his part of the material\nwhich offered itself. Thus, thoroughly alive to the manifold\ndifiiculties which beset such work, he gave much time and\nthought to discussion in the sittings of the ethical implications\nof survival, and its relation to our philosophic conceptions. It\nwas his hope to carry his work eventually to the point of\nevidence, but not alone to the evidence shown by detailed\nallusion to obscure fact. He felt that in the last analysis the\nonly evidence which can carry utter conviction to thinking\nmen is that which shows development as well as continuing\nidentity of the purported communicator. He felt also that\nproof of this kind can only be made clear by the application\nof pragmatic tests to those precepts advocated in communi-\ncations.\nMyers, James, and Hodgson, aided by certain individuals\nwho, as in the Piper case, signed themselves with Latin\npseudonyms, wrote through Mrs. Friend. We cannot here\n\f170 JoiLrnal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1916.\nadequately analyse or attempt to evaluate the results, as the\nrecord covers a period of over eight months' constant work.\nIn style, however, in intellectual grasp, and in pliilosophic\ncontent they are vividly characteristic.\nThis work of research, which was carried on with his editing\nof the Journal, was interrupted last May by his departure for\nEurope. There had been some internal disagreement in the\nsociety which culminated in Friend's resignation. A group of\nthose interested felt that it would be worth while to form a\nsub-society centering at Boston, and it was to gain the co-\noperation of the Enghsh S.P.R. that Friend left for England.\nMiss Pope of Farmington, who sailed on the Lusitania on the\nsame errand, brought details of his death. Friend had faced\nthe crisis with all the strength of his belief. He refused to\nboard a lifeboat while there were yet women and children to\nbe saved, and had secured life-belts for Miss Pope and for her\nmaid. Then with steady, cheering words he led the way to\nthe side, bade them follow after him, and leapt from the fast\nsinking ship into the sea.\nThough he was scarcely twenty-eight, and had begun his\nhfe-work less than a year before, he had clearly shown his\nmetal. With added experience and maturity, with the accumu-\nlation of data, and with the aid of fellow investigators, he\ncould not have failed, clear of mind and of purpose as he was,\nto exert a very great influence on the movement towards\npsychical research and on modern thought. He was more than\na student, more than a pioneer, he was a philosopher.\nNorman Parker.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\" INFLUENCES \" AND SURVIVAL.\n{To the Editor of the S.P.R. Journal.)\nFebruary 1st, 1916.\nThe chapter on \" influences,\"' in Mrs. Sidgwick's admirable\n\"Study of the Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena,\" is of\nspecial interest to me. This part of the subject has been rather\nneglected, I think ; and it seems worth while to draw attention to\nit, and to consider certain important bearings that it may have\non the question of survival.\n\fApril, 1916. Correspondence. in\nMrs. Sidgwick refers, with characteristic caution, to the \" sup-\nposed \" influence of these rapport-objects, and remarks that \" one's\nfirst impression naturally is that all this must be nonsense\n\"\n{Proceedings, Vol. XXVIIL, pp. 305-306), going on to say, however,\nthat some effect does seem to be produced. This, to me, is both\namusing and instructive ;\namusing because it seems so timorous\nabout something that I am quite sure of, instructive because it\nillustrates once more how greatly we are at the mercy of our own\npersonal experience in investigation. Mrs. Sidgwick accepts tele-\npathy with ease, and, as it seems to me, invokes it rashly ;\nwhile she hesitates about the efficacy of \" influences.\" I, on the\nother hand, am convinced of the latter\u2014rashly so, as it will no\ndoubt seem to her ; while I have doubts about any very extensive\ntelepathy. The explanation lies, I supj^ose, in our different\nexperiences.\nMy own experiences with a local trance-medium, plus knowledge\nof the experiences of intimate friends of mine with the same\nperson, leave me in no doubt of the su^^ernormality of some of\nthe knowledge shown ; and I am fairly sure that the hypothesis\nof telepathy from the sitter's normal consciousness is insufficient.\nI am also inclined to rule out, in some cases, the supposition of\ntelepathy from the sitter's subliminal consciousness, there being\nno evidence to suggest that the knowledge in question was there.\nE.g. when a sitter received a correct diagnosis from a lock of hair\nwithout knowing, so far as I know or can reasonably infer,\nanything about the distant person's ailment. It remains, therefore,\nto decide whether the rapport-object actually carries the infor-\nmation in some unknown way, or whether it establishes a tele-\npathic rapport between the control and the distant patient. And\nthis point I have never yet been able to decide finally, though I\nnow lean to the telepathic-rapport theory rather than to psycho-\nmetry. One thing however seems indicated,\u2014that the telepathy\nextends to the patient's subliminal, if it is telepathy at all ; for\nin two striking cases known to me, the control's diagnosis was in\ncomplete disagreement with what the patient and (so far as was\nknown) everybody else believed, yet the control turned out to be\nright. Of course this idea of telepathy from a subliminal is more\nor less hazardous, and some may favour the psychometric notion ;\nbut on the whole there seems more evidence in favour of the\nformer. And, though in the two cases the knowledge was not\npossessed by any normal mind\u2014though indeed it might exist as a\n\fl72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1916.\nguess\u2014we are at least justified in supposing that a patient's\nsubliminal knows a good deal more about his bodily state than his\nnormal consciousness does ; for it knows how to produce blisters,\nstigmata, and how to effect various remedial changes, in some\nhypnotised subjects.\nOn the whole, then, I incline to think that a rapport-object\nserves as a link between mind and mind and not as an actual\ncarrier of information. But it is very desirable that the question\nshould be further cleared up. If psychometry of the sort claimed\nin old books like Denton's Soul of Things and new books like\nHooper's Spirit Psychometry is a real fact, much of the Piper\nevidence becomes valueless so far as it is supposed to point to\nsurvival ; for in many cases an \" influence \" was presented, and\non the psychometry hypothesis this object could or might convey\nany amount of information about its former owner, whether that\nowner was still in existence on the other side, or not. If on the\nother hand psychometry is disproved or rendered improbable, the\nPiper evidence for survival remains as good\u2014broadly speaking\u2014as\nDr. Hodgson thought it; the \"influences\" being regarded as links\nbetween the control and the now discarnate owner of the object.\nConcerning presentation of \" influences \" of dead people, my\nexperience has not been wide, but I have just lately had a fair\namount. A few months ago there died a dear friend of mine\nwith whom I had for years had a compact that the one to go\nfirst should try to communicate and give evidence of identity.\nShe sent me sealed envelopes containing test-words, also a number\nof worn gloves, etc., which she herself wrapped up carefully in\noiled silk (the best \" insulator,\" Hodgson long ago told me)\nduring the last weeks of her illness. I presented one of these to\na psychic friend\u2014not a professional medium\u2014who gets automatic\nwriting, a few days after my friend died. She was said to be\n\" sleeping \" mostly, and no evidence was forthcoming. Three days\nlater the glove was presented to a professional trance-medium, by\na sitter who\u2014it was purposely arranged\u2014knew nothing about the\ndead person except that she was a friend of mine and a woman.\nSome few details were obtained, such as that death had taken\nplace recently in \" the prime of her life \" and that the disease was\nof a certain character (all correct) and the first two letters of the\nsurname were correctly given. But there was nothing evidential\nin the way of a definite message, although my friend purported\nto be present\n\u2014\ni.e., was said by the control to be so. About the\n\fApeii., 1916. Correspondence. 173\nsame time I sent another glove to a very good normal clairvoyant\nnear here, who is well known to me, and he got correct details\nabout the illness, but felt that the person was \" not yet awake.\"\nHe kept the glove, at my request, and tried on many occasions\nto \" get something \"'\nfrom it, but without further success. On\nJan. 19 I had a personal sitting with him, and he handled both\nthe glove and a small silver box which had belonged to the same\nperson ; but he got nothing except an impression of flowers (she\nsent me more flowers during my own illness than anybody else,\nso this is slightly evidential) although he proceeded to give me a\nlarge amount of evidential matter about other deceased people\nwhom\u2014so far as I know and believe\u2014he had never heard of.\nNow, if psychometry were a fact, should I not have had evidential\nfacts given me at once, from the handling of the glove, much\nmore extensively than was the case ? If on the other hand it\nserves only as a telepathic link, naturally I shall not get much\nevidence until the mind of the owner wakes up from the recupera-\ntive sleep which is supposed to follow death. It may of course\nbe said that the two mediums failed to get much evidence because\nof their belief in this post-mortem sleep ; but this will not do,\nfor one of them was told nothing about the date of the death\n\u2014\nit might have been years ago\u2014and the other could not have been\nthus influenced on Jan. 19, for he believes that people generally\n\" wake up \" within a few days of death, and he knew that my\nfriend died over two months before the sitting.\nBut if my friend was entirely unconscious and unable to com-\nmunicate, how came it that both mediums, though failing to set\nany real message, nevertheless got evidential details about the\ndisease from which she suffered, and one or two other things ?\nPerhaps, after all, an \" influence \" bears some psychical traces of\nthe owner, which can be perceived by sensitives without any\nassisting activity of that owner's mind ; while for any message\ninvolving initiative, the awakened mind is of course required. But,\nif so, we are back nearly at the old difficulty ;\nfor, until we\nknow the extent of the possibility of these psychical traces, it\nwill be impossible to infer with safety the activity of the supposed\ndiscarnate mind.\nAnd there, for me, the matter rests at present, unsatisfactorily\nenough. The two things I am sure of, are, that influences\n\"\nreally help in the production of supernormal phenomena of the\nclass indicated, and that this side of the subject deserves more\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, ioib.\nattention than it has hitherto received. Perhaps one thing remains\nto be said, in case it is asked how I know that the information\nwould not be forthcoming just the same, without any object being\npresented. The answer is : Because when an object is presented,\nthe supernormal things said are specially relevant thereto ;\nwhereas,\nwhen no object is presented at all\u2014as in most of my own sittings\n\u2014though I usually receive evidence of various sorts, it has no\nperceptible relation to what I am expecting or thinking about.\nSome of the soi-disant spirits of my Jan. 19 sitting were people\nI had not thought of for months, until the medium gave the\nname, with accompanying detail. I think this justifies me in\nbelieving that the efficacy of \" influences \" is due to something\nmore than the medium's self-suggestion, though of course I do not\nclaim that it \" proves \"it. I think none of us claims that\nanything \" proves \" anything in psychical research !\nJ. Arthur Hill.\nClaremont, Thornton,\nBradford.\nREVIEW.\nThe Yoga-System of Patanjali, or The Ancient Hindu Doc-\ntrine OF Concentration of Mind, embracing the Mnemonic\nRules, called Yoga-Sutras, of Patanjali ; the Comment, called\nYoga-Bhdshya, attributed to Veda-Vydsa, and the Explanation,\ncalled Tattva-Vdigdradi, of Vdchaspati-MiQra. Translated from\nthe original Sanskrit by James Haughton Woods. (Harvard\nOriental Series, Vol. 17.)\nFor many centuries past, travellers returning from India have\nbrought back with them marvellous tales of holy men whom they\nhad seen practising ingenious and terrible forms of self-torture.\nThese sadhus or yogis, as they were called, would bury themselves\nin the ground, leaving but their heads emerging ;\nsway head\ndownwards over a slow fire, or suspend themselves from trees by\nhooks thrust into the muscles of their backs ;\ncrouch, naked, in\nthe full heat of noon, between four sacrificial fires : or, with eyes\ndazed by glare and madness, stare unceasingly at the blazing\ncircle of the sun. Thus Yoga has come, in the minds of many\npeople, to mean a system of brutalizing austerities, fitter for\nmadmen than for saints.\nYoga, however, is more than this\u2014more, and less. First of all,\nit is a complete system of philosophy. And, secondly, it is the\n\fApril, 1916. Revietv. 175\nancient system of disciplining the mind, whereby the Hindus, and,\nfollowing them, the Buddhists, sought to bring the consciousness\ninto that state which they call Samadhi, and which apparently\ncorresponds to the highest \" degrees of orison \" and \" infused\ncontemplation \" of the West\u20acrn mystic. It is a text-book of this\nscience of menticulture that Professor Woods has translated for\nus, in the seventeenth volume of the Harvard Oriental Series.\nMax Miiller distinguished four kinds of Yoga-processes, viz.\nHatha Yoga (physical training), Laya Yoga (concentration), Raja\nor \" Royal \" Yoga (breathing exercises), and Mantra Yoga (repe-\ntition of sacred sentences or Mantra).\nA better classification, however, would seem to l)e that given\nby Swami Abhedananda, viz. Bhakti Yoga (union by love, that\nis, devotion to a particular god or aspect of the Deity), Karma\nYoga (union by works or good deeds), Jnana Yoga (union by\nknowledge), with Raja Yoga (mind discipline and concentration,\nsometimes also called union by will), and its essential preliminary\nHatha Yoga.\nThe man or woman, then\u2014for there are yoginis as well as\nyogis\u2014who wishes to attain Samadhi, must first renounce the\nworld and go far away from the haunts of men. The Swatmaram\nSwami, a modern writer on Yoga, recommends a small cell\n\" situated in a place free from rocks, water and firC; of the\nextent of a bow's length, and in a fertile country ruled over by\na virtuous king.\" Here the aspirant must study the Vedas and\nput himself under the care of a spiritual director or Guru. First,\nhe must practise the eighty-four chief Asanas or fixed postures of\nmeditation, and learn to remain in any one of them for hours\ntogether, motionless. Some, as for example the ''\npadma-asana\n\"\nor lotus posture, have alluring names, but most of them would be\nimpossible to a European. Mr. R. W. Frazer, in Indian Thought\nPast and Present, sarcastically describes a few of the \" simpler and\nmilder practices,\" one of which Asanas is to be maintained, he\nsays, for twelve years, if the Yogi would gain magic powers of\nbody and mind.\nPranayama, or regulating of the breath, is an important part of\nthe recluse's training. So, too, Pratyahara, or the banishing of\nintruding thoughts. But the chief business is the repetition of the\nMantra ;\n\" Om,\" \" Om tat sat Om,\" and the great Gayatri Mantra\nbeing the most usual. Similarly, Mohammedan mystics repeat the\nBeautiful Names of God and the formula La illahe ill' Allah.\"\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1916.\nProfessor Duncan Macdonald in Religious Attitude and Life in\nIslam gives an excellent account, drawn from Sufi sources, of the\nmethod in which a sacred sentence is to be used. The Hindus hold\nthat something of the religious consciousness of the Guru passes to\nhis Chela with the giving of the Mantra. Finally, the seeker will\npractise the concentration of his attention on some religious\nsymbol, as, for example, one of the five Tattwas, whose immediate\nmeanings are Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Spirit ; or on some one\nidea ; and learn The restraint,\" as Pataiijali puts it, of the\n\" fluctuations of the mind stuff \" (chitti).\nSo, then, the Yogi, by austerities, by physical training, by\nrepetition of holy words, and by the concentration of his mind on\nsome one symbol or idea, passes through the three stages of\nconsciousness known as Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. Fully to\nexplain these terms would take the writing of volumes. They are\nusually translated as Concentration, Meditation and\u2014no, there is\nno usual translation of Samadhi. Hindu writers distinguish many\ndifferent kinds of Samadhi, and, according to Kern, one Maha-\nyanist writer gives as many as 108.\nIn the science of Yoga, Patanjali holds much the same place\nthat St. Thomas Aquinas does in Scholastic Theology. Practically\nall subsequent teaching has his Yoga-sutras, or mnemonic sen-\ntences, as its text. Voluminous commentaries have been written\non the Sutras, though the majority of the teaching has always\nbeen oral, and a great part of it secret. Two translations of the\nSutras, as far as I know, already exist in English, that of Swami\nVivekananda, with its naive and charming comments, and the\nwell-known one of Rajendra Lala Mitra. There was room, how-\never, for Professor Woods' scholarly and accurate rendering. It is\nthe earnest hope of the present writer that the inclusion of this\nvolume in The Harvard Oriental Series may call attention to the wide\nfield of possible research into Hindu psychology and spiritual exercises,\nto which the study of Patanjali forms so attractive a prelude.\nProfessor Woods has enriched his book with a full bibliography\nand with a valuable introduction on the authorship of the Sutras,\ntheir date and those of the Commentary and Explanation. In the\ntranslation itself the chapters on supernormal powers, such as\nclairvoyance, clairaudience, levitation, etc., will possibly be of most\ninterest to the members of the S.P.R., but the whole volume\ndemands the serious attention of all students of Comparative\nReligion and of Religious Psychology.

Jacks.\nThe whole subject of dreams is virtually an unexplored terri-\ntory waiting for the psychologist who will make it his province\nin a thoroughly serious spirit. I say this after reading as\nmuch of the literature of dreams as I could lay my hands on,\nincluding the work of Freud.\nI have frequently expressed this opinion to friends of mine\nwho take an active part in the work of Psychical Research.\nI would not say that abnormal or supernormal phenomena like\nautomatic writing, or cross-correspondences, or haunted houses,\nhave received more attention than they deserve : but I do say\nthat the phenomena of dreams, which are a normal experience,\nhave received far less attention than they deserve. In current\npsychology, as distinguished from Psychical Research, the\nneglect of them is disgraceful and astonishing. They are\ntreated as a negligible side-show ; or as belonging to some\nrealm of nonsense which it is beneath the dignity of the\npsychologist to consider.\nI think it a pity also that Psychical Research, when it has\ntaken up the subject of dreams, has concentrated so much of\nits thought on the question of the \" veridical \" character of a\ncertain limited class. This, no doubt, is a point of great\n\fMat, 1916. Dramatic Dreams 179\ninterest and worthy of due consideration. But veridical\ndreams are exceptional, at all events, and not one whit more\n\" mysterious \" than many other classes which are quite com-\nmon, and which hardly receive an allusion in the literature\nof the subject. Moreover, while so little is understood of the\npsychology of common dreams, it seems futile to expect much\nlight on the nature of the \" queer \" ones.\nIn order to limit the subject I will here call attention to\nI\nonly one class of common dreams, which, for want of a better\n;\nadjective, I call \"dramatic.\"\nBy a dramatic dream I mean one in which more than one\nperson play distinct and yet interdependent parts, whether as\nactors or as speakers, and in which the action leads on to an\nissue or crisis unforeseen by any of the parties to its develop-\nment. To make this clearer I will quote an actual case.\nIn my dream I am walking in an unfamiliar country and\nrealize that I have lost my way. Presently I meet a stranger\n} whose appearance greatly puzzles me, for he is clothed in a\nsun helmet and white ducks. The feeling of being puzzled,\nthe knowledge that I do not know the person before me is,\nbe it observed, an integral part of the dream. I then ask\nI\nhim to tell me the way home and wait for his reply, wondering\nwhat it will be ; the waiting and the wondering being also\nintegral parts of the dream. To my surprise and horror\u2014all\nelements of the dream\u2014he answers that I may give up all\nhope of finding my way home, for I am in China, and the\nnearest city is Shanghai.\nThe problem that now arises is, who is the author of this\nstranger and of the part he plays, and of the effect that part\nhas upon me ? Who constructed this man in white ducks,\nwho put that reply in his mouth, who invented my sui-prise\nand horror when I heard it ? Where did it all come from ?\nThe common answer is, of course, that the mind of the\ndreamer does the whole thing. At some time or another I\nhad been reading about China and people in white ducks ;\nI had also had the experience of losing my way, and out of\nthe medley of images stored in the brain my mind constructs\nthese groupings and works them up, in virtue of some\nmysterious hanky-panky, into the scene described. In short,\nthe dream is simply the invention of the dreamer.\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1916.\nA little consideration is enough to show that this kind of\nexplanation, into whatsoever details it may be worked out, is\nsheer nonsense. .\nThe explanation involves three agents. The dreamer and\ntwo dream personalities ; one of whom seems to be the original\ndreamer himself \" I \", and the other a second and distinct individual\n(the man in white ducks). These two last and all that they say or\ndo are supposed to be the invention of the first, i.e. the dreamer\ninvents a dream-image of himself and another dream-image of\nsomebody else.\nUp to that point the explanation presents no difficulties on\niriie surface (though there are plenty in the depths). The\nconstructive imagination of the novelist or dramatist seems to\npresent a perfect analogy. Psychologically the dreamer is only\ndoing what Defoe did when he constructed the character of\nRobinson Crusoe (introduced in the story as \" I \") and of Man\nFriday, and \" set them going \" in definite dramatic situations.\nBut, unfortunately, this analogy stops at the very point\nwhich most challenges an explanation. For the dream includes\nnot only the presence, actions and conversations of the persons\nconcerned, but the whole series of psychological reactions\ncaused by the acts done and the things said. Now, some of\nthese are of such a kind that they cannot be accounted for in\nthe way supposed. One of them, for example, was my intense\nsurprise on learning that I was in China. But if my own\nmind had invented the notion that I was in China, it would\nnot have been surprised on hearing another person say that I\nwas there. The dream-person was surprised and intensely so. The\nsurprise was not acted ; it was the real thing. Moreover, there was\nthe moment when he was waiting for the reply of his interlocutor,\nwondering what it would be\u2014a perfectly definite psychological\nstate. But such a state could not occur if the fact were that\nI had the reply up my own sleeve all the time. I have\nmyself written a good many stories, and readily admit that\nwhen a writer puts a remark in the mouth of one speaker he\ndoesn't always know what reply he will invent for the other\nspeaker. But he does know that he has to invent the reply,\nwhatever it may be ; and when it comes he recognizes it at\nonce as his own invention. Between such a case and that of\nthe dream the difference is quite distinct, and no analogy is\n\fMay, 1916. Dramatic Dreams. 181\npossible. I grant also that in the highest artistic invention\nthe creator may become so completely identified with what he\nis creating as to be ignorant that he is creating it, and to\nfeel some of the surprise at the result which he would have\nfelt had he been a mere spectator of the process. But here\nthe artist and the dreamer become one, and the process,\ninstead of explaining what takes place in dreams, is itself the\nthing to be explained. And even in this case there is an\nj,\nimportant difference. When the work is done, the great artist\n'\nhas plenty of evidence that his own mind did it. However\nrapt \" Beethoven may have been in composing the Ninth\n\\ Symphony, and however surprised he may have been at the\nresult, he was afterwards fully aware of his own responsibility\nfor its creation and under no danger of attributing it to Bach.\nBut this is the very point on which evidence is lacking in the\ncase of the dream\u2014the very point in dispute. Here the\nprincipal evidence is my surprise on learning that \" I \" was in\nChina, and this evidence, so far as it goes, indicates that the\ninformation was a piece of genuine news. For the mind\ncannot prepare surprises for itself any more than a man can\nplay chess with himself.\nMy point is, then, that however far we may be able to go\nin explaining the situation of a dramatic dream by attributing\nit to the mind of the dreamer, the explanation breaks down\nutterly when we come to the psychological reactions, which\nare just as much a part of the dream as is the situation from\nwhich they issue.\nBy way of emphasizing the point, I will cite another instance\nof a dramatic dream. In this case I dreamt that I was fight-\ning a duel with rapiers with a man whom I seemed, in my\ndream, to know quite well, but who was and is a perfect\nstranger to my waking life. The personality of my antagonist\nand the surroundings were extraordinarily distinct, and are\nclearly remembered now after an interval of four years. I\nhave never handled a rapier in my Hfe, but in my dream I\nfound myself skilled in its use. Nevertheless, I was full of\nanxiety as to the issue, and terribly afraid that I might lose\nmy life. I offered at the outset to shake hands with my\nopponent, and asked in what I had offended him. \" You will\nfind that out in another world,\" he answered, \" for I am going\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1916.\nto send you to heaven.\" I remember being surprised at his\nanswer, for I expected he would say \" hell.\" Then the duel\nbegan ; and a more real \" duel was never fought. My\nantagonist's thrusts and parries were all his own ;\nthey baffled\nme every moment. He changed his tactics incessantly, and I\nwas intensely on my guard, for I could see that his purpose\nwas to take me unawares. I felt all the tension of fighting\nfor my life, and made a desperate resolve that I would kill\nmy foe. After a time he seemed to weaken, and I made sure\nthat I should win. Then he suddenly sprang to one side and,\nwith a thrust I was too late to parry, he slit my cheek from\nmouth to ear, and a moment afterwards plunged his rapier\nthrough my body. I believe I awoke at the same moment.\nI do not offer this as a wonderful \" dream, but as a\nsample of a large class of dreams which has never been\nthoroughly studied. The suggestion I make is this : even\nallowing\u2014^what is very difficult to allow\u2014that the mind of the\ndreamer accounts for the part played in this dream by one\nof the actors involved (myself), it certainly does not account\nfor the part played by the other. Nor does it account for the\npsychological reactions on either side.\nCompare with this the duel of Hamlet and Laertes as\nimagined by Shakespeare. Here the mind of Shakespeare is\nin control. To each of the imaged personalities he assigns his\npart and combines them both to a foreseen result. They do\nand say what the imagination of their creator makes them\ndo and say. And the creator knows perfectly well that he\nis creating. In the dream the consciously creating mind is\nentirely absent and consciousness transferred to the personalities\ncreated.\nThe dream-personalities, then, have a genuine experience\u2014at\nleast one of them (myself) has it, and the other (my antagonist)\nappears to have it also. Each has a mind of his own which\ndetermines his actions in relation to the similarly determined\nactions of the other. One of them remembers his experience\nand can report it afterwards. They appear to be independent\nof any third mind which is pulling the strings.\nLastly, compare the dream-duel with any \" actual \" duel of\nhistory. Are there any tests of the \" reality \" of the one\nwhich are not equally satisfied by the other ?\n\fMat, 1916. Dramatic Dreams. 183\nIt may be said there are many. For example, my present\nbody bears no trace of the wounds received in the dream-duel.\nBut this objection holds only if we assume that my present\nbody and my dream body, which was pierced by a rapier, are\nthe same body. Why make that assumption ? The dream-body\n(or its owner) certainly felt the wounds, and bore plain traces\nof them.\nAgain, my antagonist cannot be found or called as a witness.\nThis assuredly leaves my evidence without his corroboration,\nbut does not affect its value as far as it goes. It is a diffi-\nculty, but not a fatal one. For the fact that my antagonist\ncannot be found is no proof that he never existed.\nMy own conclusion is that the dream-duel actually occurred\nin the same sense that any duel, or any event, actually occurs.\nI would not go the length of saying that it occurred to me :\nbut it occurred to somebody. Whatever difficulties may beset\nthis conclusion\u2014and they are mainly difficulties of exposition\n\u2014\nthey are less, in my opinion, than those which attach to any\nother hypothesis or explanation.\nIn saying this I do not overlook the circumstance that the\nconclusion lacks corroborative evidence, whether of my \" anta-\ngonist \" or anybody else. The strength of the conclusion lies\nin the fact (as it seems to me) that the dream cannot be\ninterpreted in any other way.\nThe main difficulty ot exposition is, that the pronoun \" I\n\"\nhas to be used throughout in a double function ;\nfirst, to\nindicate the person here and now narrating his dream, and\nsecondly, to indicate the dream-personality whose experiences\nare narrated. A single pronoun being used for both, they\nappear to be the same identical \" I.\" But to assume their\nidentity is to beg the most important of the questions at\nissue.\nNOTICE OF CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nArchives de Psychologie, No. 60, Dec. 1915, contains some\nreflections by Prof. H.

Schiller.\nIt was psychologically to be expected that the terrific strain\nof the most terrible of wars should produce widespread emo-\ntional disturbance in the populations subjected to it, and that\nthis, again, should lead to an apparent recrudescence of many\nprimitive beliefs and practices. For though to a cursory\ninspection these might seem to have become extinct, they\nremained deeply ingrained in human nature and had only been\ndriven underground ;\nthey would, therefore, be sure to be\nbrought to the surface again by any spiritual convulsion. So\nit was just as natural that the allies should circulate stories of\nsupernatural interventions on behalf of their just cause as that\nthe Germans should revert to the magical practice of hammer-\ning nails into images. The alleged war-prophecies plainly\nbelong to the same stratum of beliefs and make their appeal\nto the same condition of war-neurosis, aiid the ordinary sociolo-\ngist would not hesitate to dismiss them as unworthy of\nscientific attention. But our Society exists for the express\npurpose of raking over the rubbish-heaps of orthodox science,\nand must not shrink from the search for truth in unlikely\nplaces. I need not apologize, therefore, for putting on record\nthe results of examining a number of prophecies about the war\nwhich have been in circulation.\nThe material placed in my hands by the ofiice of the S.P.R.\nis, unfortunately, far from complete. It is composed only of\nmatter published in this country and in France, and so throws\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1916.\nno light on the doings of the interpreters of prophecy else-\nwhere. It did not, moreover, enable me to trace all the\ndocuments referred to, and to verify such assertions as seemed\nverifiable. The researches necessary for this purpose would\nhave been arduous or impossible under present circumstances ;\nstill it might have been our duty to undertake them, if the\nevidential quality of the material had been such as to con-\nstitute even a jjrma facie probability that the results of such\nresearch would be anything but negative. As a matter of fact,\nit must be confessed that the evidence was so bad that it\ndid not seem to warrant further investigation. The bulk of\nit is just irresponsible, unauthenticated, unverifiable, and often\nanonymous, hearsay. Still one should not, even so, assert\ndogmatically that the evidence, where it has not been possible\nto test it, must be as bad as where it has been tested ;\nonly\nit seems fair to say that the burden of proof rests on those\nwho believe it to be better. They may be required to give\ndefinite verifiable references for the authenticity of the pro-\nphecies alleged ; until this is done, their inherent improba-\nbihty, their anonymity, and vagueness suffice to condemn them.\nI will proceed to criticize some of the more verifiable cases.\n(1) The best known perhaps is that about some arithmetical\ncoincidences in the life of William, the first German Emperor.\nIt has bhe merit of having certainly been in existence before\n1914, though it was probably not invented until 1888. The\nstory goes that in 1849 Prince William of Prussia \" was\nwandering incognito in the Rhine Provinces attended only by\nan aide-de-camp,\" ^ and was accosted by a gipsy (at Mainz),\nwho hailed him as 'Imperial Majesty.' \"Not a little amused\n\u2014\nfor at that moment his chance of succeeding even to the\nthrone of Prussia seemed slight\u2014the Prince asked \" when he\nwould be emperor, whereupon the gipsy took the date of the\nyear and added to it the figures l+8+4-f-9, thus producing\n1871 (right). A further inquiry as to how long the Prince\nwould reign was similarly answered by 1871 -fl -fS-f-T +1 = 1888\n(right again), and finally the end of the German Empire was\n1 I quote from Mr. Ralph Shirley's pamphlet on Prophecies and 07nens of\nthe Great War, 3rd ed. 1915 (p. 11 foil.), a work the uncritical character of\nwhich is not redeemed by the fact that its author plainly shows how little\nbehef he himseU' has in the prophecies he retails.\n\fJune, 1916. War Prophecies. 1S7\npiophesied for 1888 +1 +8^ 8*+8 = 1913. Now even in 1914 it\nhad to be explained that the Kaiser craftily put off the\nbeginning of the war in order to defeat (at any rate) the\nprophetic gipsy : by 1916 even the most credulous must have\nbecome sceptical about the correctness of the terminal date.\nBut this is by no means the sole flaw in the story. It is\nnot historically true that the future emperor had no expecta-\ntion of becoming King of Prussia : in 1849 he was heir pre-\nsumptive, and Ills brother's marriage had remained childless\nfor twenty-five years. Nor can the alleged prophecy have been\nmade to him in exile ; for though he retired from Berlin in\nMarch 1848, he was back again in June, and took his seat in\nthe National Assembly, while in 1849 he was commanding the\narmy wliich put down the popular risings in South Germany.\ni\nClearly, then, hvo out of the four dates in the story are\ndemonstrably wrong. If a prophecy was made to him in\nexile, it must have been in 1848, not in 1849. But if we take\nthis year as our starting point, the dates for the establishment\nof the German Empire and its first emperor's death go wi'oiig.\n1848 +1+8 +4+8 = 1869, and 1869 +1+8+6+9 = 1893. The\ninterpreters of prophecy may explain this by saving that the\nFranco-German War should have come in 1869, and that the\nemperor should have lived to be 96 ;\nindeed, they had better\nsay this, for if they persevere they will be rewarded by a final\ngleam of success. For 1893+1+8+9+3 = 1914, which is (or\nmay be) right. But with this mode of calculation again two\n(at least) of the four dates are wrong.\n(2) A more antique, and even more unfortunate, appeal to\nprophecy is presented by the Pro])hecy of Lehnin, which has\nnow been translated into English for the first time, with notes,\nby '\nSepharial,' and is published as a sixpenny pamphlet\nby W. Foul-sham & Co. (an ominous name !). This prophecy\n\"prefiguring the rise and fall of the Prussian despotism of\nGermany,\" as the title-page avers, is ascribed to a certain\nArminius, Prior of the monastery of Lehnin in Brandenburg\nabout 1240, and so is very much of a '\nchestnut.' It is\ncomposed of a hundred (shockingly bad) Latin verses, and\nprofesses to foretell the fortmies of Brandenbiu-g, the rise of\nthe Hohenzollerns, their conversion to the Lutheran heresy, and\n^ Cf. Encyc. Brit. s.r.\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, loic.\ntheir downfall, in a thoroughly monkish spirit. It is predicted\nthat with the eleventh of these heretical rulers the dynasty\nwill end, Germany will recover her peace, prosperity and\nking,'^ and that the monastery of Lehnin will be restored to\nits pristine splendour. In view of this conclusion it would\nseem to demand some audacity to interpret the prophecy as\nheralding the overthrow of Germany. However, neither\n'\nSepharial '\nnor Mr. Shirley are abashed. They also boldly\nassert the authenticity of the prophecy's alleged date, although\nit appears to be a matter of common knowledge among the\nlearned that it was never printed before 1723, and cannot be\ntraced back beyond 1693. Brockhaus's Encyclopedia says curtly\nthat its authenticity has been convincingly disproved, that it was\nprobably concocted by Canon Andreas Fromm about 1684, and\nthat since that date all its '\nprophecies '\nhave gone very wide\nof the mark.\nThe most insuperable objection to the claims of this prophecy\nalso appears to be arithmetical. As before, the interpreters\ncome to grief over a simple sum in addition. For the fact is\nthat the eleventh Protestant Hohenzollern has come and gone\nsome time ago : his name was Frederick William III., and he\ndied in 1840 ! It follows that William II. cannot be the\neleventh Protestant Hohenzollern to rule over Brandenburg.\nHe is, in fact, the fifteenth. This unfortunate discrepancy has\nnot altogether escaped Mr. Shirley (I.e. p. 57), who considers\nit a \" curiously exact \" fulfilment of prophecy that the Catho-\nlics should have \" had their disabilities removed during the\nreign of Frederick IV., who, though the twelfth in succession,\nrepresents the eleventh generation, Joachim II. succeeding his\nbrother Joachim I.\" All these assertions are incorrect, and\neven if they were not, would not help Mr. Shirley. For on\nhis own showing Frederick William IV. was the twelfth Hohen-\nzollern. How, then, can William II. be the eleventh and be\nidentified with his own great-grandfather, Frederick William III.?\nMr. Shirley's interpretation of the final catastrophe is no\nless curious. The prophecy rujis\n\" Tandem sceptra gerit qui stemmatis ultimus erit (sic !)\nIsrael infandum scelus audet morte piandum.\"\n' Not tint\/s, as in '\nSepharial's '\ntranslation.\n\fJune, 1916. War PropJiecies. 189\nThis should mean that the last Hohenzollern will be mur-\ndered by a Jew. But Mr. Shirley interprets \" presumably\nfrom the point of view of the Prior of Lehnin '\nIsrael '\nis a\nname adopted for the Christian community in Brandenburg !\n(3) An article by Prof. William Gregory in BlacJavood's\nMagazine for May 1850 records a number of popular\nprophecies which he found current in the Lower Rhine coimtry,\nand which seemed to him to agree in presaging a great war\nmth a terrific final battle of the Birch-Tree, near Werl, in\nWestphalia. These legends have now apparently wandered\nup the Rhine and yielded the material which has been\nvamped up into what Mr. Shirley reports as \" the Prophecy\nof Mayence,\"' so called after an (imaginary) convent of St.\nHildegard near this city, {I.e. pp. 13-15) and dates at 1854.\nHe gives away the French origin of its present form by leaving\nthe word for birch-tree untranslated, as a French place-name\nin the middle of Germany. There are, of course, other differ-\nences also. In Prof. Gregory's material the war was conceived\nas being between the north and the east (Russia, Prussia)\nagainst the south and the west (Austria, France) which\naccorded well enough with the circumstances of 1849-50 ; in\nthe '\nprophecy '\nof Mayence the political combinations have\nbeen brought up to date. Both versions agree in having a\nstrong CathoHc bias.\nM. de Vesme, the editor of the Annales des Sciences Psij-\nchiqiies, who has subjected War Prophecies to some excellent\ncriticism and very damaging research in his issues for Oct.\n1915 and Feb. 1916, throws some light on these discrepancies.\nIt appears that in 1909 {i.e. during the first Austro-Ser\\'ian\ncrisis), the Message? d' Alsace Lorraine printed a tale by an\nex-organist, M. Jecker (now dead) who professed to have read\nthis prophecy in 1866 in an old book (without a title-page)\nwhich he found in the house of a village priest (whose heirs\ndestroyed his Hterary remains). He learnt it by heart (!) and\ntold it to 500 persons between the years 1866 and 1870,\nnot one of whom is now producible. In 1912, after the\nAgadir crisis and the death of M. Jecker, the Messager pub-\nlished some additions, which are chiefly interesting as predicting\nthat three wars would be waged to restore the Bourbon\nmonarchy in France. In 1914 another and extensively faked\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1916.\nversion was issued. In this the clerical and Legitimist passages\nwere cut out, including the picturesque detail that the '\nyoung\nprince of the old blood of the Caps '\n(Capets) should mount\nhis white horse from the left side because his right leg was\nlame. The number of the Allies was increased from four\n(? France, Russia, England, Serbia) to seven, and the ending\nwas gi-eatly altered, the promised restoration of the Pope's\nTemporal Power having become extremely mal a propos.\nIt is evident that every editor who publishes a '\nprophecy\n'\nconsiders it his duty to bring his mateiial up to date.\n(4) A French Catholic origin may similarly be ascribed to\nthe prophecy of '\nBrother John '\nwhich appeared in the Paris\nFigaro, and is wholly unauthenticated.^ The same bias runs\nthrough the Almanacks of Mme de Thebes, to which we may\nnext turn. Mme de Thebes is a professional prophetess of\nParisian fame who combines clairvoyance with astrological\nskill, and has a reputation which impresses the editor of the\nOccfdt Review. He thinks that \" her predictions in the issues\nfor 1912 and 1913 were not a little remarkable.\" He has,\nhowever, finally to admit that \" the Parisian seeress seems to\nhave anticipated that the struggle would begin a year before\nit actually took place \" (Prophecies and Omens, p. 41).\nNow the facts about '\nMme de Thebes '\n(as gathered from an\nexamination of her Almanacks for 1912, 1914 and 1915) appear\nto be these. Like all '\nprophets ' she is fond of predicting\nwars and catastrophes, and after the 1911 crisis it would have\nbeen remarkable if she had refrained from doing so, especially\nas political circles in Paris, with which she appears to be more\nor less in touch (probably on their feminine side), seem to\nhave been far more conscious of the critical condition of\nEuropean peace than those in London. Her prophecies, however,\nare mostly couched in vague general terms, and she often '\nhedges.'\nMoreover, the claims to a '\nfulfilment '\nof her previous pre-\ndictions which she annually makes are frequently very 'thin.'\nMr. Shirley's comment on its 'provenance is \" Monsieur Peladan states\ntliat the Latin book \" (in which his father is said to have found it) \" is\nlost and that his translation only exists in the handwritmg of a clerk who\ncopied it. He has not even produced this somewhat inadequate evidence\nin confirmation of his bona fides \" (I.e. p. 24). But it was M. de Vesme who\ninterviewed M. Peladan, and forced him to own that \" unfortunately I possess\nno proof of the authenticity of this document.\" Verb. Sap.\n\fJune, 1916. War Prophecies. 191\nShe also makes a considerable uumber of egregious blunders.\nFor example, both in the 1911 and 1912 issues she predicted\nthe outbreak of the Great War in 1913 (p. 28 and p. 25),\nand the downfall of Germany and the disappearance of her\nemperor (p. 36 and pp. 37, 44). In the 1912 issue she predicts\nalso an earthquake and a scarcity of milk in France (pp. 25-6),\nan attack by Italy on France (p. 36), the success of the\nDuchess of Hohenberg's ^ plans (p. 37), a civil war in Belgium\n(predicted also in 1909), which might well set Europe ablaze,\na multitude of violent deaths and a possible collapse of mon-\narchy in England, and revolutions in Japan. The 1914 issue\ncontains i-)iter alia the following obvious failures : the French\narmy on the frontiers by the 20th March, 1914, the discovery\nof great mineral wealth in Western France and its trans-\nformation into an industrial district (p. 53), again a war with\nItaly (p. 54), the extinction of the Belgian monarchy and the\nsubjection of Belgium (p. 58), external and internal war in\nEngland, with the greatest danger of a complete overthrow\n(p. 59). On the other hand, the prediction of a new Pope\n(p. 54) would be a palpable hit, if it had not been known\nhow precarious the health of Pius X. had been getting. The\nissue for 1915 predicts a (victorious) end to the war by June\n1915 (p. 37), a revolution in Germany and the Kaiser's dis-\nappearance (p. 53), the death of the '\nsinister old man,' the\nEmperor of Austria (a very probable prediction, seeing how\noften the newspapers have prepared the public mind for it !)\n(p. 54), the destruction of Turkey (p. 65), and an apology to\nBelgium for having suspected the court and the Flemings of\nsiding wdth Germany. There are no clear successes in this\nissue at all ; for it was obvious that \" vaHant Servia is not\nat an end of its warlike destiny \" and probable enough that\nBulgaria would be involved (side not stated).\nThese specimens will probably suffice to show what clair-\nvoyance and astrology can do in the way of prediction. A\nglance at the efforts of astrology piue, simple and unaided\nmay fitly conclude our study. For only an utterly hard-\nhearted Psychical Eesearcher will refrain from shedding a\nsympathetic tear over the downfall of poor ' Old Moore.'\n^ The consort of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, who was murdered with\nhim at Serajevo.\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1916.\nThat this worthy's Almanack for 1914 should have failed to\nread the doom of European civilization in the stars may be\nexcused perhaps by human frailty and the feebleness of man's\nvision ; but one would have expected him to make ample\namends at any rate in 1915, and to give quite as authentic\nan account of it as the leading newspapers. To our astonish-\nment, however, we find nothing at all that can be interpreted\nas a recognition by the astral powers of the troubles of the\nterrestrial\u2014merely conventional remarks that at such and such\na time \" the safety of the Tsar will give grave reason for\nanxiety to his best friends \" in the police ! It is rumoured\nthat the explanation is simple. Old Moore's \" genuine Foul-\nsham edition \" for 1915 had gone to press before the end of\nJuly 1914 ! It will not do for a prophet, however, to be\nmore than a year behind the times. So in 1916 Old Moore\ndoes discover the war. In fact he is full of it, full also of\ndisasters, victories, defeats, strikes and revolutions, all illus-\ntrated with the most lurid woodcuts. In the end he leaves\nthe war going strong on the 31st of December. I grieve to\nsay '\nOld Moore ' is rather a pessimist, who ought to be\nsuppressed for prejudicing recruiting. But what can one\nexpect for one penny ? Let those who desire to be cheered,\nand are willing to spend sixpence on the lore of the stars,\nbetake themselves to Zadkiel's Almanack for 1916, and believe\n(if they can) that the war will be brought to a victorious\nconclusion in March.\nIn view of all this material, it certainly does not become\neasier to believe that the human race is growing in enhghten-\nment and increasing in critical mtelligence.

Constable.\nIn considering this subject Jlrs. Sidgwick's point of view\nis so neutral, and she keeps so remarkably free from all pre-\njudice arising from the personal equation, that her opinion\nmust have great weight. The following paragraph appears\nto me to express a sound theory, so perhaps I may be for-\ngiven for paraphrazing it in some measure :\n\" Of course, communication mth the dead, when it occurs,\nmust imply a real commimicator in the background, but\nthe point is that this does not necessitate either the dramatic\ncommunicator or the control being other than phases or\nelements of Rlrs. Piper, nor does it exclude the possibility\nthat the dramatic communicator is a fiction, or a dream,\nor a hallucination of the control, each of which things it\nappears sometimes to be. That it is with phases or elements\n\u2014centres of consciousness\u2014of Mrs. Piper, and not with entities\nindependent of her, that the sitter is in direct communication,\nseems to me for the reasons given to be the hypothesis which\nbest fits the facts so far as we know them : that under which\nthey most readily fall into an intelhgible order and are most\neasily interpreted. And it is also a hypothesis against which\nno valid arguments have, so far as I have seen, been\nadduced.\" (p. 320.)\nI agree fully with what is above stated. Indeed, I would\ngo further, \u2014I suggest that where there is a real communica-\ntion from the dead, the real communicator must always find\nhis greatest stumbling-block to communication in the always\npresent fact of the dramatic communicator.\nNow we are all self-conscious subjects, embodied or un-\nembodied. Self-consciousness is a thing in itself, for us.\nThe common bond of union between us is in Consciousness,\nand from this bond there is constant, timeless, communion.\nBut communication infers mental operation in time.\nThe evidence for telepathy between the living is found in\nthought-transference ; there is sympathy or rapport between\nthe mental operations of the agent and percipient. (Note.\nIt is shown in '\nPersonality and Telepathy '\nthat there is\nno direct transference of ideas ; the direct bond is in com-\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1916.\nmunion, there is emergence of like or associated ideas.) But\nin telepathy between the living and the dead this cannot\nbe. Imagination\u2014as Kant says, deep buried in the soul\nof man\u2014still exists for the dead, but the inhibition of imagin-\nation by the brain for the production of thought is impossible\nfor the dead : the dead have no brains, as instruments for\nthought. There are but the brains of the living for use,\nand so, in any particular case, the brain of the living must\nbe used by the dead for communication with the living.\nMark the distinction made between communion (which\ntranscends ideas) and communication.\nMrs. Piper falls into hypnosis under the impression that\nanother personality is to take possession of her organism.\nShe does not fall into that deep state where there is not\nonly full inhibition of all external sensuous effects, but full\ninhibition of personal mental operation. (Note. But a few\ncontinuous records of communication from George Pelham\nsuggest this state.) There is still, for her, some mental\noperation, and she is still open, in some measure, to external\nsensuous effects.\nMentally, she is affected by her impression that the person-\nahty which has been brought to her attention is to take\npossession of her organism ;\nshe, desiring such possession,\nnaturally dramatizes this personality. I write '\nnaturally\n'\nbecause human experience informs us of what takes place.\nWe all of us, embodied, live in dramatization. I am I\n;\nI offer to the world but a dramatized self ; each one of us\nknows he is not that self published to the world. If you\nwho read try to worry out what you yourself are you will\nfind you exist in dreams : you exist in your own dreams,\nwhich have little or nothing to do with yourself as a mere\nactor manifest on the world's stage. The pleasures of love\nexist largely in self-revelation to another\u2014the one enjoys\nadmitting another behind the scenes, where he or she is\ndressing up for appearance before the footlights.\nIf we say that the communicator suggested to and desired\nby Mrs. Piper is\u2014to take one instance\u2014Julius Caesar, we\nencounter no difficulty in explanation of what takes place.\nMrs. Piper dramatizes Julius Caesar. No matter whether\nthe dramatization be successful or not the mental process\n\fJuly, 1916. Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance. 197\nis akin to that of Shakespeare dramatizing Hamlet, or Cer-\nvantes Don Quixote. We have nothing before us but a\ndramatized communicator.\nIt is when a dramatic communicator like George Pelham\ncomes on the scene that our difl&culties in explanation begin.\nThat George Pelham is dramatized as a communicator is,\nI think, clear from the fact that, ordinarily, when there\nis manifest consecutive mental operation on Mrs. Piper's\npart as shown by her speech or writing, then G. P. is\ndramatized. But, sometimes, the dramatic communicator\nG. P. appears to give us communications not from the\nactor dressed up by Mrs. Piper but from himself. It is\ntrue that when he gives these communications he gives them\nthrough himself as an actor, as dressed up, but the communica-\ntions would appear to be from himself undramatized. We\nhave some analogy from Shakespeare : Thackeray gives us\na very clear character of Shakespeare himself, though we\nknow little or nothing of Shakespeare's hfe, apart from his\ncharacterizations of philosophers, warriors, cowards, clowns,\nand women. Sterne, in the pulpit, is said to have once\nrevealed himself by taking off his periwig and throwing it in\nthe face of the congregation.\nNow if G. P. could, without impediment, use Mrs. Piper's\nbrain, he could himself communicate directly with us. But\nhe does not do this : the information we get from him is\nusually 'scrappy and imperfect.' (p. 320.)\nIf Mrs. Sidgwick's theory be sound, this scrappiness and\nimperfection are accounted for. For, by that theory, G. P.\nfinds impediment to direct communication not only from\nMrs. Piper's partial personal mental activity and partial open-\nness to external sensuous affections, but from her natural\ndramatization of G. P. as a communicator. G. P. has to\n'\nseize ' moments of blankness on Mrs. Piper's part in mental\nactivity and openness to sensuous affections, for direct com-\nmunication. The very scrappiness and imperfections of\ndirect information from G. P. are what, by the theory, we\nshould expect\u2014what we should expect, that is, if G. P. be\na real communicator.\nBut I must be a little critical. The position of those of\nus who are outsiders is to be pitied. The best evidence\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1916.\nfor direct communication is denied us. For instance, Mrs.\nSidgwick refers to a '\ndramatic incident.' On turning to\nthe account of this dramatic incident (Vol. XIII., p. 321),\nwe find that it consists of statements of private matters\nmade privately to a Mr. Howard by G. P., through Mrs.\nPiper, which fully convinced Mr. Howard that G. P. himself\nhad been communicating with him. But neither we\u2014nor\nHodgson himself\u2014are told what was communicated. The\nabove is not the only instance existing. I think we must\nnot quarrel with this concealment of private matters, for\nthe concealment is on its face natural and reasonable. Even\npersonally I admit myself particeps criminis. For the strongest\ninstance I have ever had of communication with the dead\ngave me information that no one else living will ever be made\naware of. But all such instances do not constitute evidence\nof any hind, unless we fall back, unreasonably, on the accept-\nance of authority for belief and confuse belief with evidence.\nAgain, when direct information gets through from a real\ncommunicator, I think it should, naturally, be marked as\ndifferent in some way from information beginning and ending\nwith the dramatized communicator ; how marked it is difficult\nto define. But as to this I may use analogy. Like other\nhuman beings I dream, and in the twenty-five thousand days\nand nights of my passing life have probably dreamt, by day\nand night, millions of dreams. All have past from immediate\nmemory : all but three. These three exist always present to me\nin time\u2014three instances of communion with the dead, two of them\nfollowed by the emergence of definite ideas. The three were\nmarkedly different in impression from their millions of fellows.\nPossibly there is some evidence of this difference in the\nPiper records. There are a few abnormal and excited\n\" rushes '\nat her waking stages which appear to give direct\ncommunication. And, where the communication is direct\nand continuous, the record, perhaps, appears marked by an\nabsence of personal mental activity on Mrs. Piper's part.\nAll communications revealing what personal existence is\nafter disembodiment must, I think, be referred to as begin-\nning and ending with dramatized communicators.\nThought being correlated to movement of the material\nbrain exists in inhibition of imagination, and we can imagine\n\fJuly, 1916. Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance. 199\nthat the disembodied may be able to use the brains of the\nembodied for the inhibition of their imagination. But we\ncannot imagine any inhibition of imagination opening to us\nthe wonders of free imagination. They may be able to come\nto us on our limited plane, but we can rise to them on\ntheir relatively limitless plane only in extasy, where we are\nfree from the limits of thoughts and ideas. The child playing\nwith its earthly toys is apt to picture for itself a future\nlife where toys are innumerable and unbreakable.\nAN AUTHENTIC PROPHECY?\nSince writing the criticism of War Prophecies in the June\nJournal, I have had my attention called to a Serbian prophecy\nwhich has some pretensions to authenticity, and certainly has\nseveral points of interest. Not only is it claimed that it has\nbeen extensively fulfilled already, but some of its fulfilment is\ndemonstrably posterior to the prediction ; also it still concerns\nthe future. Moreover, it was made the subject of a contem-\nporaneous official record, and has had considerable pohtical\ninfluence. The story as gathered from two versions in M. Chedo-\nmille Mijatovich's A Royal Tragedy, published in London in\n1906, and from a private paper contributed by him to the records\nof the S.P.R. in July, 1903, and if one ignores minor dis-\ncrepancies, runs as follows :\nOn the 29th (or 28th) of May, 1868, a peasant named Mata,\nfrom the neighbouring village of Kremna, began to cry aloud\nin the principal street of Ujitza, a town in western Serbia, that\nthe then Prince of Serbia, Michael Obrenovich, was being horribly\nmurdered and '\nslashed with yatagans.' He was arrested by the\npohce as causing public alarm, but in the evening a telegram\narrived announcing the correctness of his vision. The Prefect\nof Ujitza then interrogated Mata further, and found that he\nhad no connexion with the assassins, but had had other visions\nabout the future of Serbia, and put his predictions on record.\nThe document containing them was sent to Belgrade and kept\nin the Secret Archives, but M. Mijatovich, though he professes\nto have watched the fulfilment of its predictions from 1875,\nwhen he first heard of it, and was told in 1880 by Milan G.\nMilityevich that he had a copy, and in 1889 by Nicola Christich,\nthen Prime Minister, that he had read the original document,\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1916.\ndoes not himself claim ever to have seen it. Anyhow, the\nprophecies of Mata are said to have predicted the events of\nthe reigns of Milan and Alexander with great exactitude, including\nthe latter's murder and the extinction of the Obrenovich line.\nThe evidential value of these reports it will be possible to judge\nonly when the authentic text of the '\nprotocol ' is pubhshed\n;\nbut this is not likely to happen, as the Serbians probably destroyed\nall their secret archives before evacuating Belgrade. We are\nonly concerned evidentially, therefore, with those parts of the\nstory which referred to events subsequent to 1903.\nThese predict (1) the succession of the Karageorgeviches, whose\nrule, however, is to be short, '\n2 or 3 years,' '\nabout 3 years,'\n'\nnot for long,' in the various versions given by M. Mijatovich\n;\n(2) a foreign conquest leading to great suffering among the people,,\nso that they will envy the dead in the churchyards. This will\nlast '\na few '\nyears or '\nmany.' (3) Then there will arise a saviour\namong the people who will deliver them from their oppressors\nand unite all Serbians happily in one state. (4) This liberator\nis to be in some sense a descendant of the Obrenoviches, '\nas\nthough an oak tree, after being cut down, should suddenly send\nup a shoot from its roots at some distance from the original tree.'\nNow it is evident that so far only the second of these pre-\ndictions can be said to have been fulfilled, and that not very\nremarkably. For in 1868 the position of Serbia was precarious\nenough to make a foreign conquest seem quite a possible eventua-\nlity. However, Mata would be more likely to think of the Turks\nthan of the Austrians and Bulgarians.\nThe first point cannot be said to have come true literally^\nfor the Karageorgevich rule would have lasted a dozen years,\neven if it were not destined to be restored. The third point\nmerely expresses commonplaces of patriotic aspiration everywhere.\nThe fourth point is certainly remarkably definite, and its\nfulfilment would go far to place Mata's clairvoyance beyond\ncavil. At the same time, it is highly improbable, though not\nwholly impossible. For although the house of Obrenovich is\napparently extinct, it is understood that through the female line\nits claims have passed to a grandson of King Nicholas of Monte-\nnegro, while the son of King Milan and Mme. Artemise Christich\nis still alive. While therefore its further fulfilment seems im-\nprobable, it is perhaps permissible to keep an eye on the Black\nProphecy of Mata of Kremna. '\nF. C. S. Schiller.\n\fJolt, 1916. Dreams and Psychology. 201\nDREAMS AND PSYCHOLOGY.\nThe opinions expressed in Dr. Jacks's charming little paper in\nthe May Journal on Dramatic Dreams so entirely accord with\nbeliefs I have cherished (with very little social encouragement)\nfor very many years, that I cannot refrain from seconding his\nappeal on behalf of the dream life, which is so considerable a\nportion of the totality of human experience. In particular, I\nwould echo his complaint about the neglect of dreams by pro-\nfessional psychologists. Here we have hundreds, even thousands,\nof highly selected, trained and endowed men who have been\nspending their whole time on researches which are only very\nremotely connected with the problems of concrete minds, and\nhave so far been singularly barren of applications, and they\nleave utterly unrecorded, uninvestigated and untouched insistent\nphenomena which could easily be experimented with and about\nwhich almost nothing is definitely known ! We are all dreamers,\nand yet we have never tried to conquer this region of experience,\nto discover the best methods of dreaming and of regulating its\napparent madness. There ought surely to be a Society for the serious\nand scientific study of dreams, which would co-operate with the S.P.R.\nThe present is not, however, an auspicious time for inaugurating\nsuch a Society ; so I will content myself with suggesting to Dr.\nJacks that he ought to change the nomenclature he has used\nfor the several characters that enter into the problem of the\ndream. He distinguishes, quite rightly, between the dream-\npersonahty which has the experience and the '\nI '\nwhich narrates\nthe dream when awake. But he calls the latter '\nthe dreamer,'\nand this is surely wrong. The '\ndreamer '\nshould be the person-\nage who actually has the dream, and not he who subsequently\nrecalls it, often imperfectly, and reflects upon it. Moreover,\nDr. Jacks appears to think (p. 183) that the chief problem about\nthe dream is to explain the relations of these two personahties.\nBut this is surely relatively easy. That the 'dreamer' is a 'second-\nary personality '\nof the waking '\nself '\nis attested both by the\ndifferences and by the discontinuities of memory between them,\ncoupled with the fact that the waldng self can '\nappropriate\n'\nthe dream-experience. The source of the dream, however, is a\nreal mystery. Dr. Jacks well shows that neither the dreamer\nnor the waking self can claim to create the dream and to con-\nstruct its plot. The obvious inference is that there exists a\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1916.\nthird party, whom I have called the maker of the dream, and\n(tentatively) identified with the '\nSally '\nof the Beauchamp Case.\nMy terminological proposal, therefore, put forward most recently\nin the review of Dr. Morton Prince's Unconscious (in Proceed-\nings, Pt. LXX. pp. 50-1-6), 1 is to distinguish, \u2014(1) the normal waking\nself, who is not identical with the dreamer though he may be\naffected by '\ndreams '\nhe remembers, or even {teste Freud) forgets\n;\n(2) the dreamer, for whom the dream is real and usually forms\nthe real world ; (3) the maker of dreams, who victimizes the\ndreamer. I trust that Dr. Jacks will assent to this classification,\nand did not mean to play upon me the common philosophic\ntrick which consists in taking a technical term which another\nphilosopher is labouring to fix, and ruining it by promptly using\nit in a second sense liable to be confused with the first. For\nto agree upon common terms for what we wish to investigate\nis the first step towards a solution of the problem of dreams.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nNOTE BY DR. JACKS.\nI HAVE read Dr. Schiller's note and appreciate his point. In\nreply I have to say that I find it extremely difficult to choose\na nomenclature, or indeed any form of expression, which does\nnot beg the question involved in the identification of the dream-\npersonalities. I know of no problem in philosophy in which\nit is at once so vitally essential and yet so difficult to free theory\nfrom the misleading of language. Let me try to be more explicit.\nSmith dreams he is fighting a duel. Here, I think, four per-\nsonalities are distinguished in ordinary speech. (1) Smithy, who\nremembers and narrates the dream, (2) Smitha, asleep and dream-\ning, (3) Smiths ,\nfighting the dream-duel, (4) Smith's antagonist\n\u2014\nto whom, oddly enough, corresponding personalities to (1), (2),\n(3) do not appear to be attached.\nDr. Schiller contends that I err in calling Smithy the '\ndreamer,'\nand I admit the justice of his correction. But when he insists\nthat Smithg (or is it Smithg ?) is the dreamer I fail to follow\nhim. The fact is exhausted when you say Smithj fought the\nduel which is remembered by Smith ; when you expand this and\nsay Smithg dreamed that he fought the duel you go beyond the\nfact and commit yourself to a theory ;\nindeed, you beg the\nquestion. For the question to my mind is precisely this\u2014was\n1 Cf. also Humanism, 2ik1 ed., pp. 266-7.\n\fJuly, 1916. Note by Dr. Jacks. 203\nthe duel a real duel (in the sense that any historical duel is\nreal) or was it an unreal event, an event that never happened,\nan event concocted or made up by a peculiar mental process\nwhich goes on when the body is asleep ?\nIt is almost impossible to use ordinary language which does\nnot adopt the second of these alternatives, thereby clouding the\nwhole issue with a foregone conclusion. We say '\nSmith dreamed\nthat he was fighting a duel,' and this implies at once that Smith\nperformed a mental process\u2014his mind did something or other\n\u2014\nof which the duel was the product. But what evidence have\nwe that Smith's mind did {i.e. concocted) anything at all ? The\nevidence, so far as it goes, simply records that a duel was fought\nby two men, neither of whom appears to have been Smith, and\nthat Smith when he was awake could narrate the experience of\none of them. How Smith got access to that experience as\nthough it had been his own is precisely what we do not\nknow. To say that Smith dreamed the experience is not to\nsolve the problem but to restate it There it seems to me that\nDr. Schiller, like myself in the instance for which he properly\ncorrects me, goes beyond the evidence by introducing the 'dreamer.'\nTo solve the mystery it may be necessary to get rid of this\npersonality altogether. I do not pin myself to this solution but\nI do say that if the inquiry is dominated from the outset by\nthe conception of a '\ndreamer '\nand a special process of mental\nconcoction called '\ndreaming '\nwe are going beyond the facts.\nWhat if there is no such process at all, and no such person ?\nPsychology has already got rid of a good many fictitious\n*\nmental processes.' What if '\ndreaming '\nis one more of the\nsame class ?\nAmong the various personalities concerned in the dream under\ndiscussion I may say that the one about which I am most curious\nis (4)\u2014the antagonist. He was a very lively gentleman whom\nI would recognize among a thousand if I were to meet him\nto-morrow. Who, in heaven's name, was he ? Dr. Schiller's\ntheory leaves him wholly unidentified. And what an interesting\nhght would be thrown on the matter if it should turn out\nthat at the very time that '\nI '\ndreamed '\nI '\nwas fighting\n'\nhim,' somebody else dreamed that '\nhe '\nwas fighting '\nme.'\nWhen the matter comes to be fully investigated it may be\nfound that in dreams also there are such things as cross-\ncorrespondences.\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1916.\nCASE.\nL. 1204. Coincidental Hallucination.\nThe following case of a coincidental hallucination was first\nbrought to our notice by a paragraph in the daily press on\nJune 6, 1916, in which it was stated that :\nThe sister of Seaman George William Malpress, of Peterborough,\none of the men who went down with the '\nQueen Mary,' had a\nrealistic dream last Wednesday [the day the '\nQueen Mary ' was\nlost]. She was lying ill in bed when she thought that her brother\ncame to her bedside, and although she spoke to him repeatedly\nhe would not answer. He appeared quite well and happy.\nSubsequently, in reply to enquiries, we received the following\naccount from the percipient, Mrs. Baxter :\n56 New Ed., Peterboro', June 19, 1916.\n... in reference to my dream\u2014as it was published in the\npapers, but it was not a dream, it was a vision. I was very ill\nat the time. It was the afternoon of the day of the battle that\nI saw my brother. I was taken worse and thought I was going\nto die. I was with my brother on his ship and he was so happy\nand singing, and then it changed and he was at home on leave.\nI thought I repeatedly spoke to him each time but he did not\nspeak to me. I knew I was ill, and thought he would not\nspeak because I was disfigured. I asked my mother if he had\ngone back and she said he had not been home. I said I knew\nhe had, it seemed so real. 1 was very much upset because he\nwould not speak to me. 1 did not hear of the sinking of the\n'\nQueen Mary '\nuntil a week after, as 1 was too ill for my mother\nto tell me. . . . It would be just about the time when the ship\nwent down that I saw my brother, as it was late in the afternoon\non Wednesday, May 31.\nF. Baxter.\nOn June 29, 1916, the Secretary went to Peterborough and\ncalled upon Mrs. Baxter and her mother, Mrs. Malpress, who\nkindly answered all the questions she put to them. Their\nevidence, as noted and summarised by the Secretary at the\ntime, and confirmed by their signatures, was as follows :\nOn May 31 Mrs. Baxter was suffering from erysipelas, and had\nbeen ill from the previous Friday. About 5 o'clock in the after-\n\fJuly, 1916. Case. 205\nnoon she \" felt something snap inside her, and part of herself\nseemed to have gone out of her ; she thought she was dying.\"\nThen she seemed to be on a ship, or very near it ; she could\nsee the sailors moving about, and heard them singing ;\nthey were\nvery happy. She spoke to her brother on the ship ; he wouldn't\nanswer. She called for a scarf he had given her, so that she\ncould hide her face, as she was disfigured. Then the scene\nchanged, she was at home, her brother was at home, she spoke\nto him, but he wouldn't answer. She cried, thinking it was\nbecause she was disfigured. The vision went. She was still very\nupset because he wouldn't speak to her. She asked her mother\nif her brother had gone back.\nShe had never had a vision, or a dream, of this kind before.\n(Signed) FLORENCE Ethel Baxter.\nJune 29, 1916.\nMrs. Malpress said that her daughter had been \" lightheaded\non and off\" during her illness, but that at the time of the\nvision she seemed \" listless and blank.\" She continued :\nWhen she had this kind of blank feeling come over her, I went\ndown to find some one to fetch the doctor as I thought she was\ndying. When I went up again she was crying, and seemed very\nupset. I asked her what was the matter. She said Will had\nbeen to see her, and he wouldn't speak to her. The following\nmorning I said, \" How did Will look ?\n\" \" Just as usual,\" she\nsaid ;\n\" I thought he was here home on leave. He was in his\nuniform, and very bright and happy.\"\n(Signed) Hannah Malpress.\nJune 29, 1916.\nThe news of the Naval Battle, including the announcement\nof the loss of H.M.S. '\nQueen Mary,' was published on Saturday\nmorning, June 3, 1916. In the casualty list, which appeared\na few days later (our reference is the Daily Telegraph, June 8)\nthe name of G. W. Malpress, A.B., was included in the crew\nof the '\nQueen Mary.'\nIt is stated in Admiral Sir John Jellicoe's despatch on the\nbattle, published in the press, July 7, 1916, that the action\nbegan at 3.48 p.m. (Greenwich mean time) on May 31 ; and\nin the various reports by observers, that the '\nQueen Mary '\nsank soon afterwards. In an article in the Daih\/ Telegraph on\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, i&ie\nJune 6, Mr. Hurd, indicating approximately the course which\nthe battle took, says :\nQuite early in the action the '\nQueen Mary,' by an unfortunate\nmischance, or good German gunnery, was hit, and sank in a few\nminutes. ... It should be emphasised that this misfortune\noccurred almost immediately after the action opened.\nThus, it will be observed that the coincidence in time\nbetween the hallucination, which occurred about 5 p.m.,\nsummer time, and the death of Seaman Gr. W. Malpress,\nwhich occurred soon after 4.48, summer time, was very close.\nIt is chiefly owing to this coincidence in time that we print\nthe case, contrary to our practice of excluding hallucinations\noccurring during illness where delirium is present. The evidence\nis further strengthened by the following considerations: (1) the\nhallucination seems to have been the only one which assumed\ndefinite form during the illness ; (2) it was certainly the only\none described by the percipient during this time ; and (3) it\nwas unique in her experience.\nThese points will be apparent from the evidence on the\nmedical aspect of the case, kindly contributed, in answer to\nour enquiries, by Dr. H. Latham, of Peterborough, who was\nattending the percipient. The questions which were put to him\nare given below in square brackets :\n^ July 3, 1916.\n[How long was the percipient delirious, and was the delirium\nintermittent ?]\nFrom Monday night. May 29, until the end of the week. Yes ;\nshe appeared to ramble and say \" queer things \" (the mother's\nreport to me) only at night. In the morning or afternoon when\nI saw her she seemed clear in her mind.\n[Was this particular hallucination described to you before the\nnews of the Naval Battle on May 31 was known to the public 1]\nI cannot lix the day, but I can say positively that I was told\nof it, both by Mrs. Malpress and Mrs. Baxter, long before the\nlatter had any information of the Naval Battle or the death of\nyoung Malpress. Mrs. Baxter did not know anything about the\nNaval Battle, etc., until a full week after it had occurred, as I\ngave strict orders that she was not to be told. About a week\nafter the Battle, say Wednesday, June 7, she picked up a paper\n\fJOLY, 1916. Case. 207\nwithin her reach and saw the list of officers or men on the\n'\nQueen Mary.' It was many days before this that I was in-\nformed of the vision, both by the mother and Mrs. Baxter.\nLater, Dr. Latham wrote as follows :\nJuly 15, 1916.\nMy distinct impression is that the hallucination was mentioned\nto Mrs. Malpress before the Naval Battle was known of. But I\nreally cannot fix the date when it was told to me. All I can\nsay is that, when I was told of the hallucination, I questioned\nMrs. Baxter, and she told me quite simply that she had seen\nher brother on the deck of his ship, that he looked quite as\nusual, but never spoke a word. She told me this many days\nbefore she knew of the Battle, but I cannot fix the date.\n[Were any other hallucinations described to you during the\nillness ? And have you heard of any experiences of the same\nkind that Mrs. Baxter ever had ?]\nNo, only that she said such \" queer things.\"\nI am quite sure that neither Mrs. Malpress nor Mrs. Baxter\nhave ever had any other previous experience of the Idnd. They\ntook no interest in the subject when I was first informed of it,\nwhich was early, and long before anything appeared in the papers.\n(Signed) H. Lath.\\m, M.B.

When Mr. Henry Holt, the well-\nknown pubhsher and the author of the very elaborate summary\nof the results of Psychical Research entitled On the Cosmic Rela-\ntions, started The Unpopular Revietv in Jan. 1914, one of the\nunduly unpopular subjects he determined to popularize was\nPsychical Research. His Review has ever since had articles\nbearing on this topic in almost every number. At first these\nwere only abstracts, speculations and expositions of work already\ndone, by the Editor, Mr. H. A. Bruce and Prof. W. R. Newbold ;\nlatterly, however, fresh evidence has been presented. The July\n1915 number, for example, has an account by Mr. E. W. Friend\nof automatic writings, obtained through his wife, which purported\nto come from WilUam James. Mr. Friend, as readers of the\nobituary note in this Journal for April 1916 will remember, was\na promising American scholar who was proposing to devote\nhis life to Psychical Research, but was one of the many victims\n\f208 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. Jcly, 1916.\nof the Lusiiania's disaster. In printini; Mr. Friend's notes the\nEditor admits that they are not evidential, i.e. that they do\nnot contain information about James which was unknown to\nthe automatist, hut both he and Mr. Friend thought that the\npart of James was well acted and that many of the answers\nwere characteristic of his manner. It should be noted, however,\nthat though she had never met James and was not a trained\nphilosopher, Mrs. Friend had read a good deal in his books, and\nalso a little Bergson. It seems to me also that though the\nremark \" I could tear up some of my Psychology\/, but not a\ndamn word of Pragmatism \" sounds authentic, the other passages\nquoted as characteristic are quite unconvincing. For example,\nthe reply to the question '\nWhat do you think now of the moral\nequivalent of war?' 'There is no moral equivalent to a pro-\nceeding so barbarous,' seems entirely oblivious of the whole\npoint and argument of James's splendid essay with this title.\nAgain, I grieve to say, that Mrs. Friend's '\nJames '\nhas, in spite\nof the asseveration quoted above, somewhat forgotten his prag-\nmatism. \" When a spirit unhampered by material mechanism\ncalls to his being a thought, it calls to him the whole meaning\nof the subject in its true universal relation \"\n(p. 184) is certainly\nnot a pragmatic sentiment. It is Platonic. The doctrine that\nperceptions are '\nseparated '\ninto conceptions for practical use is\ndistinctively Bergsonian. On the whole, therefore, it will be\nsafer to return a verdict of '\nnot proven.'\nThe number for Jan. 1916 contains a report on the case of\n\" Patience Worth.\" She first communicated through a ouija board\ncontrolled by Mrs. J. H. Curran of St. Louis in July 1913,\nand her records already amount to five large volumes of type-\nscript. Mr. Holt, who has examined these and the manu-\nscript of a then forthcoming book by Mr. C. S. Yost, the\neditor of the St. Louis Globe- Democrat, declares that \" very little\nof this matter is the frequent trash of involuntary writing.\nNearly all of it is to be taken seriously as literature. Much\nof it is literature of a high order.\" Certainly '\nPatience Worth '\nwrites dehghtfully sententious and pungent Elizabethan (or\nJacobean) English, and extemporizes abundant blank verse which\nhas strong claims to be ranked as poetry. The contrast between\nher language and the colloquial American of the sitters is very\nstriking and is consistently sustained. But of course it is not\nevidential. '\nPatience Worth '\nhas, it seems, made no attempt\nto authenticate herself as a historical character. She has, there-\nfore, so far to be treated as a '\nsecondary personality '\nof Mrs.\nCurran. But she bids fair to enrich the records of automatism\nand enlarge our knowledge of what secondary personality really\nis and of what it is capable.

I.\nThe foUomng case of what appears to be a telepathic dream\nwas brought to our notice by an associate of the Society,\nMi-. Ben Davies, who is personally acqu4.inted with the per-\ncipient, Mrs. Phillips, of 21a Dean Road, Cricklewood, N.W.\nMrs. Phillips's original statement was as follows :\nJune 5, 1916.\nOn the morning of Thursday, June Ist, I looked at my watch\nand found it was 5.30 a.m. I went to sleep again, and had the\nfollowing dream :\nI went to the window and drew aside the bhnd ; in the distance\n(on my right) I saw a number (9 or 12) of luminous objects\nflying in an aimless way in a circle. Nearer was a smaller group.\nOn looking closer I saw they were dead heads with small wings\non the side of the head (something like the head of Hypnos at\nthe British Museum) and when the face was turned away the\nback view was that of a Union Jack. I saw the colours distinctly.\nOne of the nearer group came wafting toward me, not using\nthe wings, and as it came 1 could distinguish the features. It\nwas a man's dead face, the eyes were closed and [it] was unknown\nto me. It came close to my window and knocked up against\nthe glass. I heard the sound and can still remember it. I\ntapped the pane several times to try and make it go away, and\nthen I woke up. Sybil M. Phillips.\nMrs. Phillips's statement was corroborated by her husband\nand two neighbours, as follows :\n(a) 21a Dean Road, Cricklewood, N.W. [June 5, 1916.]\nMy wife related her dream, as contained in the foregoing\nstatement, to me on Thursda} afternoon, June 1st. No rumours\nof the naval engagement of the j^revious evening were known\nby either of us at that time.^ B. E. Phillips.\n^ The. MOWS of the battle of Juthmd was first published in the evening\npapers of Friday, June 2, 1916.\n\fOct., 1916. Gases. 211\n(6) Bedford House, York Place, W. [Received June 9, 1916.]\nJVIrs. Phillips told me the foregoing dream on the morning of\nThursday, June 1st. M. Sturgeon.\n(c) 6 Hawke Road, Upper Norwood. [Received June 9, 1916.]\nSirs. PhilUps told me this dream on the morning of Thursday\nlast. Makiun Ct, Ewen.\nWe also received a statement from Mr. Davies to the effect\nthat ou the morning of Saturday, June 3, 1916, when the\nnews had come of the naval battle, a neighbour to whom\nMi's. Phillips had pre\\nously related the dream came to her\nand suggested that it should be interpreted as referring to\nthis battle. On June 9, 1916, we therefore wrote to Mrs.\nPhillips to ask the following questions :\n(i) Was the neighbour referred to in Mr. Da\\'ies's statement\none of those whose corroboration we had received ?\n(ii) Did Mrs. Phillips often dream ? If so, had she ever\nbefore had any veridical dreams ? Was there anything specially\nvivid about her dream on June 1, 1916 ?\nTo these enquii'ies JVIi-s. Phillips replied as follows :\n21a Dean Road, Cricklewood, N.W. Sunday, [June 11, 1916].\nI cannot say that I have ever had a dream before which\nwas so YiYid and impressed me so much. 1 dream very often,\nalmost every night, but these dreams are of a scrappy and in-\nconsequent natm-e ; often 1 cannot recall them. You may judge\nhow much this dream impressed me by the fact that 1 told\nit to so many people. I think the fact that I didn't connect\nthis dream with the naval battle immediately was because I\nwas so engrossed with the battle itself, but of coiu'se as soon\nas Mrs. Ewen suggested the connection in the morning (I heard\nthe news on Friday night) 1 knew of course that it was some-\nthing of the kind you suggest. Although I cannot claim to\nhave had any other dream which exhibited supernormal know-\nledge, it may interest you to know that my mother has had\nmany such dreams. For instance, when my husband had sun-\nstroke in India, we found she (here in England) had dreamed\non or about the same date that he was so hot she could not\ncome near to him. Perhaps these quahties are hereditary.\nS. M. Phillips.\n\f21:^ Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1916.\nMrs. Ewen's corroboration of the dream was received first\non June 9, 1916 (see above), but we also received the following\nstatement from her :\n6 Hawke Road, Upper Norwood, June 25, 1916.\nMrs. Phillips told her dream to me on the Thursday morning\n[June 1, 1916], and I was under the impression that she told\nme that the dead face had a sailor's cap on. Mxs,. Phillips is\nquite certain that she did not say so, and I possess a rather\nvivid imagination. I must have pictured this in my mind. I\nasked Mrs. PhilHps at the time if she had any friends in the\nNavy, for I was convinced that it had to do with that. I cannot\nexplain this at all. Marion Ewen.\nThe weak point about Mrs. Phillips's dream, if we are to\ninterpret it as relating to the naval battle of May 31, 1916,\nis that there is nothing distinctively naval about it ; for a\nUnion Jack might evidently be associated with any one who\nhad died in the defence of this country, on land as well as\non sea. It may be slightly i)i favour of a naval interpretation\nthat Mrs. Phillips should have seen heads only without bodies,\nfor this peculiarity of her vision has no obvious association\nwith the idea of corpses on a field of battle, whereas any\none, picturing to themselves a sinking ship, is likely to think\nof the drowning men in the water with only their heads\nvisible. This perhaps accounts for the fact that Mrs. Ewen,\nwhen she heard the dream, seems at once to have associated\nit in her own mind with some naval event.\nII.\nL. 1206.\nWe have also received lately through Sir Lawrence Jones\nanother record of a dream, apparently telepathic, the dreamer\nbeing his sister, Mrs. Fuller-Maitland. Her record of the\ndream (contained in a letter to Sir L. Jones) is as follows :\nWood Rising, Rye, Sussex, April 25, 1916.\nEdward [Mr. Fuller-Maitland] has a picture in [the] R.A. We\nheard on Saturday morning it was in. On Friday afternoon\n[April 21, 1916] I was very tired and went to he down about\n3.30. I fell asleep for a few minutes, and as I woke up 1 had\na distinct vision of the big room in the R.A. and Edward's\n\fOct. , 1916. Cases. 213\npicture hanging on the left of the door as you go in from the\nsecond room. I came down and said to E., \" Your picture is\nin and is hung in the big room high up on the left of the door.\"\nThe next morning he got his in-notice, and yesterday he went\nup for varnishing day and found his picture in the big room\non the left of the door high up ! I saw the room as plainly\nas possible, and it was quite empty, two or three men in it\nand no red velvet sofas. Mr. Powles says they judge the pictures\nin that room and that probably the sofas are removed. ^\nSir Lawrence Jones corroborates Mrs. FuUer-Maitland's\nstatement, as follows :\n39 Harrington Gardens, S.W., June 2, 1916.\nThe picture is hung on the right of the door from Room No. 2,\nas you enter, but on the left as you look at [it] from the big\nroom itself. My sister says that she seemed to be standing\nat the end of the room and that the picture seemed to her\nabout a third of the way down the wall. This is about correct.\nLawHENCE J. JONLS.\nWe also wrote to Mr. Fuller-Maitland asking for a corro-\nborative statement, and received the following reply :\nWood Rising, Rye, Sussex, June 10, 1916.\nI am sending, as you request, an independent account of my\nwife's veridical dream. On Good Friday afternoon [April 21,\n1916] my wife told me that she had just had a vision of my\nlarger picture (I sent another which was also kept back but\nnot hung) hung on the right of the door of the large room, as\nyou enter, and rather high up. 1 asked her to put her impres-\nsions down in writing, which unfortunately she did not do, but\nshe told Mr. Powles in my presence. It was, as I told her\nat the time, extremely unhkely that I should be hung in the\ncoveted large room, if hung at all, especially as the picture is\nrelatively small.\nThe following morning I received my varnishing ticket, and\non Monday went straight to the place she mentioned, where\nI saw my picture. Edward Fuller-Maitland.\nOn June 5, 1916, we wrote to Mrs. Fuller-Maitland asking\nthe following questions :\n(a) Whether any other picture of Mr. Fuller-Maitland 's\nhad, on a previous occasion, been hung in or near the place\nwhich figured in her dream.\n1 It has been ascertained that this conjecture is right.\n\f214 Jour'nal of Society for Psychical Reseaich. Oct., 1916\n(6) If she expected that the picture (to which the dream\nrelated) would be hung.\nMrs. FuUer-Maitland replied as follows :\nWood Rising, Rye, Sussex, June 10, 1916.\nlu answer to your questions about my dream on Good Friday,\n(rt) My husband has never before had a picture hung in the big\nroom at the R.A. (6) 1 did not expect the picture to be hung,\nthough I knew it had a chance. Accepted pictures are so con-\nstantly crowded out that till the varnishing ticket actually arrives\none can never feel the least certain.\nGERTRUDIi J. FuLLER-MaITLAND.\nThe following corroborative statement was also received\nfrom Mr. Powles, who is a member of the Society :\nThe Highlands, Rye, Sussex, June 11, 1916.\nI do not remember the exact date, but I clearly remember\nthat it was some days before the result of the hanging at the\nR.A. was known to outsiders, that Mrs. Fuller-Maitland told\nme of a vivid dream she had had, m which she saw her husband's\npictm'e placed rather high up on the south wall of Room III.\n\u2014\n.\nnot quite in the middle, but rather nearer the entrance from\nRoom II.\nLess clearly I seem to remember that she told me it had\noriginally been placed farther down on the right of that wall.\nL. C. FOWLES.\nThe value of this case depends to a considerable extent\non the question of how' exactly the position of the picture\nin Mrs. FuUer-Maitland's dream corresponded with its actual\nposition on the wall of the room at the Royal Academy.\nIt will be seen that there is an apparent discrepancy between\nthe statements made by Mr. and Mrs. Fuller-Maitland as\nto the position of the picture in the dream. Mrs. Fuller-\nMaitland in her letter to Sir L. Jones says that she saw it\n\" hanging on the left of the door as you go in from the\n2nd room \" ; Mr. Fuller-Maitland says that in his wife's\ndream the picture was \" on the right of the door of the\nlarge room as you enter.\" Sir Lawrence Jones explains this\ndiscrepancy (see above) and says that Mrs. Fuller-Maitland\nimagined herself standing \" at the end of the room,\" facing\nthe picture, we may suppose. Looked at from that position, the\n\fOct., 1916. Oases. 215\npicture is correctly described as being \" on the left of the\ndoor \" leading from Room II. into Room III.\nMrs. Fuller-Maitland's original statement that the picture\nwas \" on the left of the door as you go in from the 2nd\nroom \" was not accurate, but Sir L. Jones's interpretation\nof her words is confirmed by Mr. Powles's statement that\n\" she saw her husband's picture placed rather high up on\nthe South Wall of Room III., not quite in the middle, but\nrather nearer the entrance from Room II.\"\nRoom II.\nDoor-\nS. Wall Picture\nRoom III.\nThe above plan (which is a rough sketch, not drawn to\nscale) makes it clear that a picture in the position described\nby Mr. Powles must be on the left of the door from Room II.\nfrom the point of view of a spectator facing this door.\nIn view, however, of the fact that no written record was\nmade of the dream until after its confirmation, it will be\nwiser in weighing the allowance that must be made for chance-\ncoincidence to assume only that Mrs. FuUer-Maitland was\ncorrect as to the wall upon which the picture was hung.\nNow there are eight rooms at the Royal Academy in which\na picture of the size of Mr. Fuller-Maitland's might be placed\nand four walls to each room. Moreover, the picture having\nbeen accepted as doubtful, the chances were about even\nwhether it would be hung or not ; for of accepted pictures\nabout half are crowded out. This would make the odds 63 to\n1 against Mrs. FuUer-Maitland being correct in her statement\nthat the picture would be hung on a particular wall. Probably,\nhowever, the odds may be reckoned as higher than this, first\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1916.\nbecause Mr. Fuller-Maitland had another picture accepted\nas doubtful, about which Mrs. Fuller-Maitland might have\ndreamt, and it was not likely that both pictures would be\nhung on the same wall of Room III. ; and secondly, because\nthere is reason to think that Mrs. Fuller-Maitland was approxi-\nmately right as to the position of the picture on the wall.'\nAs to what cause\u2014other than chance\u2014is likely to have\nbeen operative, it should be noted that the picture had almost\ncertainly been hung at the time of Mrs. FuUer-Maitland's\ndream. Its position was therefore known to several people,\nand Mrs. Fuller- Maitlaud's impression may have been tele-\npathically derived.\n1 1 went to the Royal Academy on July 28. I chose a picture which I\njudged to occupy the position described by Mrs. Fuller-Maitland, but on\nreferring to the catalogue I found that the picture of her dream was about\n10 feet further to the right, immediately next to the door between Room II.\nand Room III. \u2014H. de G.

Kenneth Girdlestone.\n[The author of this paper is a Member of this Society.\nThe names of the patient and of the doctors who attended\nthe case have been given to us, but are withheld here by\nrequest.\u2014Ed.]\nBeing interested in Psychology, I very naturally accepted a\nproposal made by one of our military doctors that I should\nvisit a patient of his who had been found wandering in our\ntown and who had been brought by the police to the hospital,\nwhere he was found to be suffering from complete loss of\nmemory : the memory of events both near and remote was\nobliterated from his mind, and his power of recognition was\ngone ; he no longer knew his wife, when she visited him,\nnor could he identify himself. He had not lost the power\nof speech, but I understand that before I saw him he made\nknown his wants by other signs ;\nindeed, he continued acting\nthus until the lost, or rather dormant, powers of which I\nhave spoken gradually, and at first almost imperceptibly,\nreturned.\nWhen I first saw him I was unaware of the length of time\nhe had been in hospital. I learnt later that he had been\nthere some three weeks, and that he had remained for that\nperiod in a dazed kind of condition, his facial expression\nbeing at times that of a man bewildered by an insoluble\nproblem.\nMy knowledge of the doctor's patient, whom I will call\n1 The method adopted for inducing hypnosis was acquired by the -vvriter's\nactual experience of treatment by fully qualified medical men.\n\fNov. -Dec, 1916. ^-1 First Experiment in Suggestion. 221\nmy pupil for reasons that will soon become obvious, was\nscanty. His history as far as I knew it was that by trade\nhe was a fitter, that he had an accident in which he injured\nhis right arm seventeen vears since, that he was for a short\ntime in the Police Force, had joined the shire Regiment\nat the outbreak of the war, had been discharged as medically\nimfit after a month's service, had le-enlisted in the R.A.M.C.,\nhad been in France for about five months, where he was\nwounded in the same arm that had been previously injured\nin the accident, and that he had left his depot on his return\nfrom the Front and had been found as I have already de-\nscribed. I also knew that he was a married man with two\nchildren, and it was not long before I learnt that his age,\naccording to a medical report hanging beside his bed, was\nsix and forty.\nI first hypnotised my pupil (January 28, 1916) in a little\nroom which I was assured would be free from noise. I\nasked him to lie in an easy chair, or it may be that I pointed\nto it. Anyhow he readily did so, and upon my resting the\npalm of my hand across his forehead and suggesting rest, etc.,\nhe fell into a doze. He was awakened from this by reason\nof some one suddenly bursting open the door. My pupil\nimmediately moved his left arm upwards, resting his head\nin the palm of his left hand, and began mumbling something\nabout a wall 4000 feet high and later about \" Dr. Jordan . . .\nof Brumagum . . . little fellow.\" To my question as to\nwhether he had ever heard of Dr. Jordan he replied slowly\nthat he'd heard the name.\nThe next day (January 29) he seemed for a moment to\nrecognize me, but upon my taking a chair beside his bed\n(I never used the small room again, as I found that it was\nused for stores which might be wanted at any moment) he\nsuddenly named all the days of the week in French several\ntimes. I now began instructing him as if he were a child.\nI brought with me a child's ABC, the letters being large\ncapitals, coloured, and each ha\\dng beside it an animal, also\ncoloured, its name beginning with the letter alongside of\nwhich it lay. He soon began coppug these letters. With\nhis right hand he generally copied them correctly, with his\nleft, where possible, they were reversed, so that E became\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research. Nov.-Dec, 1916,\nD Q, etc. There was also a strong inclination to begin\ndrawing his letters from right to left instead of vice versa.\nBut when once the proper method was pointed out to\nhim the inclination grew less and less. After some days\nit disappeared and only recurred on two noteworthy\noccasions, of which I shall speak in due course. He\nseemed unable to copy any letters beyond K. I managed\nto get him to repeat their names so far and then thought\nI would find out if he were able to appreciate numbers.\nHe had the greatest difficulty in numbering my five fingers,\nbut he found it easier to comit the letters of the alphabet,\nnot because the alphabet would be easier to count, but because\nonce again familiar with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, they would\nprobably flow more easily a second time. And such was\nthe case ; for upon my saying A, B, etc., he articulated 1, 2,\netc. When I reached G, however, he was unable to continue,\nso I did so for him, saying Gr. 7, H. 8, I. 9, J. 10. He\ninstantly broke in: \"number in Police Force,\" when he\nheard me say ten. He then began talking about a bath, and '\nI asked him what water was. To answer this required a\nlot of thought. At length he replied slowly yet decidedly,\n\" Something that makes you dry.\" There was then a very\nlong pause, during which he was no doubt trying to correct\nhimself, for his next utterance was, \" Not dry but wet.\"\nThis made me think that not only was there an inclination\nto invert letters, when copying, but one also to invert ideas.\nIt must be remarked that he talked with great caution, both\nDOW and for some time, as if trying his best to correct these\ninverted ideas. When milk was brought to him, and I pointed\nto it, he called it du lait. He asked me the number of days in\nthe week and the number of weeks in the year, to which\nqueries I replied respectively 7 and 52. He then asked\nme the number of days in a year, and I naturally replied\n365. Almost before the words had left my lips, he quietly\nbut decidedly told me how many he considered the correct\nnumber, namely 364. This number stood Out clearly before\nhim, he said. The result of 7 multiplied by 52 had flashed\nto his mind.\nThe third day (January 30) I again hypnotised him, and\nI may mention in passing that he always appeared to lose\n\fNov.-Dec, 1916. A First Experiment in Suggestion. 223\nwhat for the sake of convenience I will call ordinary con-\nsciousness when under hypnosis, although when awake he\nseemed to be living in a dream. Nevertheless most of his\nquestions were quite sensible ones. For instance, he asked\nwhere Calcutta was and how much it would cost to get\nthere, but was well satisfied when I showed him two florins,\nthree coppers, and a shilling. His train of thought had no\ndoubt suddenly changed, and instead of the coins answering\nhis question, they brought to him the idea of moulding, for\nhe proceeded to show me how to make them. He then\nasked me what compasses are, at the same time trying to\ndraw imaginary circles, his thumb being the centre, his first\nfinger describing the circumference. \" Can you measure to\n1\/1000 inch ?\n\" was another of his questions.\nOn the next day, Monday, January 31, I again hypnotised\nhim. This I continued to do daily, at first merely suggesting\nrest and quiet, and then that the memory should gradually\nreturn. On the Tuesday he asked me what I did. I said,\n\" Writing.\" He then noticed the armlet I was wearing and\nwas able to distinguish the colours and to name them. When\nI showed him a yellow colour, he was unable to say what it\nwas, but he struck a match, blew it out, and then asked\nme where the flame had gone. \" Like life,\" he remarked,\n\" goes out \" ; this before I had time to frame an explanation.\nHis power of philosophical speculation did not seem to have\nbeen impaired, perhaps it was even stimulated.\nOn the Wednesday a hazy notion as to what time is became\nnoticeable in his remarks.\n\" I saw a lady this morning who told me you were her\nson. I don't believe it, she looks so young.\" (My mother\nhad visited him the previous afternoon. She is vivacious\nand has a youthful figure.)\nOn Thursday he showed some resistance to rest, but he\njaelded after a little persuasion. He did a Jig-Saw puzzle\nand moulded coins, etc., in Plasticine. He now knew all\nthe capitals with the exception of Z.\nOn the following day (February 4) I gave him a child's\ncopy book, which he told me he would study after I had\ngone. I also began teaching him the small letters used for\nprintmg, and gave him a book with pictures of machinery\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical i2esearc\/i. Nov.-Dkc, 1916.\nin it. I wrote to his wife, and told my pupil that I had\nwritten to \" Maggie \" in answer to a letter she had sent him.\nI gave him typewritten extracts from this letter so that he\ncould copy the letters.\nThe letter referred to is from ^bury. My pupil tells\nme (Saturday, February 5), that he will go there when\nthey let him out, as somebody might know him there. In\nanswer to my question whether time seems longer when I am\nabsent he replies, \"Yes.\" He now recognizes the lady who\nvisits him three times a week (my mother). By signal he\nasks me to bring him some cigarettes. He can now read\nmost of the small printed letters. He has done some copying,\nand is always ready to show me how he progresses. Writing\ncomes more naturally with his left hand ; with the right he\ndraws the letters as if copying pictures. On the next day,\nSunday, I show him a box. He draws a rectangle and writes\nBOX on it at my suggestion. I get him to do the same\nwith many other objects, always making him spell the word ;\nthen I pronounce it and he repeats it. He writes alternately\nwith the right and left hand, with one until tired, then with\nthe other. I have forgotten to say that after my first experi-\nment I always visited him in the ward where there are some\nforty patients.\nI will now let my notes, as taken day by day, speak for\nthemselves :\nMonday, February 7. Points to word \" eggs \" in copy-book,\nsays he had them for breakfast (correct). \" Have anjrthing\nelse ? \" I enquire. \" Bread and butter,\" he replies (correct).\nAsks if malarial fever is near Singapore. Gives account of how\nhe will live with \" that girl.\" (Has already told me that having\nno work and no money it would be vsrong to have a wife yet.)\nSays he won't give her any money when he gets some, but will\nfeed her. Parcel arrives by j)ost from his wife. Writes a post-\ncard of thanks at my dictation. Can only pronounce small\nwords. Can't send love because he hasn't any.\nTuesday, February 8. Has copied the days of the week and\nput a cross through Sunday and Monday. Proceeds to cross\nout Tuesday, as now that I have come another day has gone.\nSays he cannot draw a box I show him because it is solid and\nthe paper is flat. He draws it, making the sides contiguous\n\fNov.-dec, 191C. A First Experiment in Suggestion. 225\nwith the top ; there is no knowledge of perspective. Writes\nfaster, chiefly using his left hand.\nWednesday, February 9. When I move the hands of my\nwatch, he tells me they must be on different shafts, otherwise\nthey would move at the same speed. Readily understands the\nrelation between the movements of the two hands. I tell him\nthe little hand moves one space to the big hand's ten. \" Wrong,\"\nhe says. When I say 1 to 12, he says I am right. He draws\nshafts, pulleys, and all kinds of engines, explaining them minutely-\nI give him a very difficult puzzle involving the placing together\nof six pieces of wood so as to make a Slaltese cross. He does\nit with ease. I give him a calendar from which he can tear\noff each day as it passes.\nThursday, February 10. I have not hypnotised him for two\ndays, but now do so. When awake he asks the following ques-\ntions :\n\" What's the place where (he raises his hand about 3 feet\nfrom the floor, evidently meaning children) go . . . the bell\nrings . . . there's a blackboard ?\n\"\n\" School,\" I reply.\nHe says they are not all that height (lowers and raises his\nhand) and one is bigger than all (the master).\n' Was it before I came here that I went there . . . and have\nI been here ever since ?\n\"\nI answer his questions and tell him his memory is returning\nand that he will soon remember what he did between leaving\nschool and coming here. He asks about Maggie, and says that\nif she recognizes him, he'll go back with her when she comes.\nHe is beginning to read short words aloud.\nFriday, February 11. I hypnotise him. WTien awake he asks\nme if when \" they \" (children) are ten they work in cotton\nmills. I say it's rather young to do so, but he insists that\nthey can go to school half a day and work the rest. He writes\nseveral words without my dictating them, and when I draw a\nhammer and other tools he is able to spell them phonetically,\nlikewise a number of words, both English and French, such as\nWensday and Bon sivar, not taught him pictorially or otherwise\nby me.\nSaturday, February 12. I h}'p)notise him. When awake he\nasks what a specialist is, and mentions Queen's Hospital and\nDr. Jordan Lloyd who has a black beard. (This I now know\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov. -Dec, 19I6.\nis the doctor who saw hun seventeen years ago at the said\nHospital.) He asks what excitement is, and says he was told he\nmustn't have any. He points at the figure 10 on box and says\nhe had that number on his neck. \" When you were a police-\nman,\" I say. I show him a map of England and point out\nhis home, bury, and other places. He puts his finger on\nWolverhampton, spells it, and says he has been there. He can\nspell equally well when names are inverted.\nSunday, February 13. He shows me the following names he\nhas written down : JAMES A. JOHNSON, FRANK GIBSON,i\nLOWER HOPTON ROAD, MIRFIELD. He tells me both these\nlive at Mirfield, that the former is himself (in reality a brother),\nthe latter his sister (in reality his brother-in-law and his address).\nHe writes down in my presence treboR. I tell him he has\nwritten one of his own names backwards. He then writes\nROBERT (3) JOHN(l) JOHNSON i\n(2), in the order indicated by\nthe numbers, his own name.

Joseph Johnson, minister of the Park Avenue Con-\ngregational Church, Ashton-on-Mersey, to the Knutsford Board\nof Guardians. The election was to take place on the foUowmg\nday. We had an animated meeting, and with my thoughts full\nof this I left before its close, and (alone) turned out into the\nbrightly lighted and bustling thoroughfare of School Road, Sale.\nI had walked but a few paces when I was staggered by seeing,\nas in a cinema show, reflected in the air in front of me a clear-cut\npicture of my brother in Australia, lying with the unmistakeably\nhelpless look of a dead or unconscious man who had just fallen.\nI saw his pose, his clothes, and even his thick curling hair as\nif in life before me.\nMechanically I must have continued walking as no one appeared\nto notice me ; but I felt my brother was dying or dead, or that\n\fNov. -Dec, 1916. Gases. 231\nsomething tragic was happening to him, and I began at once\npraying for him in an agony of supplication. The picture faded,\nand I hurried on out of the light of the shops and into the\ndarkness of Washway Road.\nSuddenly, when halfway along the road, the picture shone out\nagain before my eyes, this time against the dark sky. Again\nI saw the prone helpless figure, the colouring of clothes and hair,\nthen as before it faded quickly away, and I did not see it again.\nI think it was between 8 and 9.30 p.m., or about then, that\nI left the meeting. I remember that my sister had not been\nvery well, and that she was in bed. 'When I reached home I\nran up to her room and broke down in telling her what I had\njust seen, saying I was \"sure something had happened to Edgar.\"\nI remember she tried to soothe me by saying I was simply\novertired\u2014that I should get away to bed and \" would see things\nwould be all risht in the morning.\" I tried to believe this\nwould be so, but all the Saturday and Sunday following I kept\nthinking of my brother and praying constantly for him. On the\nMonday morning the post brought a nice kind letter from him\nwritten from Hobart from our cousin's home there, enclosing\na belated birthday gift for our small nephew,, dated 4th March.\nWe were so glad to have the letter, and my sister said :\n\" Now\nyou see Edgar is all right.\"\nOn the Thursday morning {i.e. April 10, 1913), my sister being\nstill confined to bed, I sent up the letters to her, then suddenly\nI heard her cry out, and I rushed upstairs to find her sitting\nup with a scared look holding out the (enclosed) letter from\nMr. Huie, C.A., from Edinburgh, stating that he had just\nreceived a \" cablegram from Mellsourne \" announcing \" the death\non April 7th of our brother Mr. J. Edgar Paterson.\nThe next news we had was when our sister-in-law's letter\n(enclosed) arrived telling us how Edgar, when travelling home\nfrom New Zealand to Melbourne, had suddenly fallen down\nunconscious on the ship when nearing Melbourne, had been\ncarried ashore at Melbourne unconscious, and placed in Hospital\nthere (on the Saturday, April 5th, 1913), where he had lingered\nwithout regaining consciousness till the Monday, April 7th, when\nhe slipped quietly away.\nMary M.

Edgar Paterson was taken ill quite suddenly on board ship,\nwhen on his way to Melbourne, between 10 and 11 a.m. on\nFriday, April 4, 1913 (Victoria time), that he became uncon-\nscious at once and died in hospital in Melbourne on April 7,\n1913. By Greenwich mean time, therefore, he was taken ill\nbetween midnight and 1 a.m. (approximately) on April 4,\n1913, and he had been unconscious about twenty hours when\n^ \" Standard time \" in Victoria is ten hours in advance of Greenwich\nmean time.\n\f234 Journal of Society for PsycJncal Research. Nov. -Dec, 1916.\nMiss Paterson saw the apparition of him between 7 p.m. and\n9.30 p.m. on that day.\nUpon the evidence of this and the many other recorded\ncases of a similar kind most investigators will be ready to\nassume that \" between deaths and apparitions of the dying\nperson a connexion exists which is not due to chance alone.\" ^\nIn the present instance, the sudden and unexpected nature\nof Mr. Paterson's illness precludes the idea that anxiety on\nhis behalf in Miss Paterson's mind could have been a contri-\nbutory cause of her experience. Another peculiarity worth\nnoting is the great distance which intervened between the\ndying man and his sister, almost the greatest distance terres-\ntrially possible. We thus find it again cogently demonstrated\nthat whatever the means of communication in such cases may\nbe, it is one which distance does not invalidate.\nIn Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 245 ff., Myers discusses\nat some length whether apparitions of this kind can always\nbe explained by \" telepathy pure and simple,\" or whether\nwe must not in some cases assume an actual \" modification\nof space \" caused by what he calls a \" psychorrhagic \" faculty\non the part of the agent ; for the details of the argument\nreaders must turn to Myers's book. In the particular instance\nunder discussion it seems likely that the cause of Miss Paterson's\nvision was a telepathic impression received by her mind from\nthe mind of her brother and externalised by the same mental\nmechanism which can externalise, as an hallucination, sugges-\ntions given in hypnotic trance.\nAs to whether this impression wa's received at the moment\nof the hallucination, or whether it had been received earlier\n\u2014\nperhaps at the first moment of Mr. Paterson's seizure\u2014and had\nlain dormant in the percipient's mind, waiting an opportunity\nto rise into consciousness, we have no means of determining.\nOne point may be noted : Miss Paterson has said that she saw\nthe figure of her brother lying prone with his clothes on, and\n^ Since Mr. Paterson did not die until two days after Miss Paterson's vision,\nthe case cannot be reckoned as a \" death-coincidence \" according to the\ndefinition given in the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, Proc, S.P.R.,\nVol. X., p. 208, but this circum.stance has onlj' a .statistical import and\ndoes not detract from the psychical interest of the case.\n\fNov. -Dec, 1910. 2:35\nit appears, as stated by Mrs. J. Edgar Paterson in her letter of\nJune 24, 1913 (see above), that Mr. Paterson was \" up and\ndressed \" when he was taken il], so that in its main features\nMiss Paterson's vision seems to have reproduced a scene which\nactually occurred. The scene is depicted rather as it might\nappear to a spectator than from the standpoint of Mr. Paterson\nhimself, from whom it is suggested that the impression came.\nBut this should perhaps be explained by supposing that the\nactual mise en scene in such a case is pro\\'ided by the drama-\ntising instinct of the percipient's n^ind.\njVIiss Paterson informs us that, so far as she is aware, she\nhas never had any other similar experience.\nII.\nL. 1208.\nWe have received the following case of what seems to be a\ntelepathic impression from Mr. L. C. Powles, a member of\nthe Society. The percipient is Mr. James W. Sharpe, late\nFellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.\nMr. Powles's statement of the case is as follows :\nThe Highlands, Rye, Sussex, July 2, 1916.\nOn Aug. 4, 1913, I had been invited by a friend; Miss B.,\nliving in the neighbouring town, some three miles off, to meet\nMr. James W. Sharpe. On the afternoon of that day, therefore,\nI rode over to her house, leaving my wife, who was not well\nenough to accompany me, resting by herself.\nAt tea-time we talked, I think, entirely upon psychical matters,\nand I remember asking Mr. Sharpe if he saw '\nauras '\nround people,\nand, if so, what he saw round me. At first he saw nothing,\nbut later he said :\n\" You asked me to tell you ; 1 do now see\nsomething.\" He saw two things behind me. (1 now refer to\nmy notes made the same evening on my return.) \" One, a dark,\nnot inimical,^ half-human creature, with knotted hands placed\nupon my shoulders.\" This he said was \" symbolical of illness\nnear at hand\u2014a warning.\"\nThen appeared the \" faint slight figure of a young woman\nwith oval face, etc.\" (here follow some details which very well\napply to my wife's appearance). She \" tried to avert the illness.\"\nWhen I came home towards six o'clock my wife told me she\n1 For comment on this woid, see below.\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

C. POWLES.\nWe have also received a statement from Mrs. Powles, as\nfollows :\nJuly 2, 1916.\nI remember perfectly my husband going over to tea on Aug. 4,\n1913, at our friend's house, Miss B.'s, and ray being unable to\ngo with him that day.\nI was anxious about him, as he had only recently recovered\nfrom pneumonia, and there was a very cold wind. To pass\nthe time and divert my thoughts I took up the Strand Magazine,\nand became absorbed in a very horrible story of a man disguised\nas a gorilla who came behind his enemy and broke his neck\nwith his powerful hands.\nI have always had a great horror of gorillas from childhood,\nand far-fetched as it was, I was made very nervous and oppressed\nby the story and longed for my husband's return. Immediately\nhe came, I told him of the story and the absurdly nervous\nstate it had left me in. This interested him extremely, and he then\ntold me something of Mr. Sharpe's vision. He did not at the\ntime describe it quite fully for fear of alarming me, and par-\nticularly did not mention that Mr. Sharpe thought it might be\na Health-warning. Isabel G. Powles.\nIt will be observed that these two statements were written\non July 2, 1916, nearly three years after the occurrence of\nthe incident to which they refer. Mr. Powles's statement,\nhowever, is based on notes made Avithin a few hours of this\nincident, and we have been able to obtain further corroborative\nevidence in the form of a statement by Miss B.^ who was\npre,sent when the percipient, Mr. Sharpe, described his impres-\nsions, and also a letter written by Mr. Powles to Miss B.\non the day after the incident occurred.\nMiss B.'s statement, contained in a letter to Mr. Powles,\n^ This lady's name and address are known to us, but are withheld here\nat her request\n\fNov. -Dec, 1916.

Nov. -Dec, 1916.\nhave not thought it necessary to get any further statement\nfrom Mr. Sharpe. It should be noted, however, that he himself\ninterprets the vision as a symbolic and presumably subjective\nrepresentation of an impression concerning Mr. Powles's health ;\nbut the coincidence between the form assumed by this sym-\nbolic image and Mrs. Powles's mental pre-occupation at the\ntime, and her fears about her husband, is curious, and suggests\na telepathic origin for the vision.\nEEVIEW.\nTlie Quest for Bean Bridgman Conner. By Anthony J. Philpott.\nW. Heinemann, London.\nThose who have read my paper on the psychology of Mrs.\nPiper's Trance Phenomena in Proceedings, Vol. XXVIII., may\npossibly remember that more than once, but especially on p. 112,\nthe futile search in Mexico for a boy officially reported dead, but\nbelieved by his relatives to be still alive, is referred to. Mr.\nPhilpott's book gives a lively and interesting account of the\ncase by one of those who conducted the search and concluded\nwith good reason that the boy, or rather young man, was really\ndead. I read the book with interest, because I had previously\nseen no written record of the case. My knowledge of it was\nconfined to unannotated references to it in some of Mrs. Piper's\nsittings, and rather vague recollections of what Hodgson had\ntold me about it and especially about the failure of Mrs. Piper's\npart in it. The case is an instructive one, as showing how\nlittle confidence can be placed in the statements of mediums\npressed into a quest of this kind, and it may be worth giving a\nbrief account of the story as related by Mr. Philpott.\nConner was a young citizen of the United States who went\nto the city of Mexico to work as electrician in a theatre, but\nwas shortly after going there taken ill with typhoid fever and\nremoved to the American hospital, where he died in the spring of\n1895. An official account of his death and burial was sent\nby the American Consul-General to his father in Vermont. A\nfew months later his father had a vivid dream in which his,\nson appeared to him and said he was not dead, but alive, and\nheld a captive in Mexico. This confirmed certain vague doubts\nand suspicions entertained, for reasons too long to enter into here,\nby the young man's friends. Through the advice of the Rev,\n\fNov.-Dec, 1916. Review. 239\nM. J. Savage, they consulted Hodgson, and through him Mrs.\nPiper. Mrs. Piper's controls confirmed the view that Conner\nwas alive. \" She claimed,\" says Mr. Philpott, \" that he had\nbeen taken from the hospital at night by the '\nSouth road '\nand\nwas being held for ransom or some other dark purpose.\" The\ncontrols affirmed that the body of another patient who had died\nwas dressed in his clothes and buried as Conner.\nThus fortified in their suspicions, Conner's friends decided that a\nMr. Dodge, who knew him well, should go to Mexico to look\nfor him. Mr. Dodge was not reassured by his enquiries, but\nultimately having obtained leave to have the body, which had\nnow been buried for about a year, exhumed, he \" was pretty\nwell convinced at the time that \" it was that of Conner. Mrs.\nPiper's controls continued to assert, on the contrary, that he\nhad been taken along a South road,\u2014to a country house said\nPhinuit, to Tuxedo said G.P. Unfortunately, when Mr. Dodge\nreturned home, experts in Vermont concluded that teeth and\nhair taken from the skull of the buried body were not those of\nConner. The grounds on which they formed this conclusion\nwere judged by Mr. Philpott, who discussed the matter with\nthem later, to be insufficient : but their opinions naturally carried\ngreat weight at the time, and were held to confirm in general\nthe statements of Mrs. Piper's controls.\nMrs. Piper was ill and unable to give sittings during a great\npart of 1896. When she resumed in October of that year Mr.\nDodge had more than one sitting with her, in the course of\nwhich she gave a lurid account of Conner's condition at or near\nPuebla (Puebla being now substituted for Tuxedo) in some sort\nof lunatic asylum described with some detail. Mr. Dodge and\na friend started again in search, and while they were searching\ndirections given in the Piper trance were telegraphed to them.\nThe controls professed exact knowledge of their whereabouts\nas well as of that of Conner, and described them sometimes\nas near or actually in the building where he was confined, and\nso forth ; but the indications given were always incorrect or\ninadequate, and they returned puzzled and disajapointed.\nIn the meanwhile the newsjaapers\u2014or rather a newspaper, the\nBoston Globe\u2014took the matter up, and early in 1897, after Mr-\nDodge's return, sent Mr. Philpott to carry on the quest. Mr.\nPhilpott ultimately satisfied himself that the descriptions given\nwere misleading ; that it was impossible that Conner could be\n\f^40 Joarnal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov. -Dec, 1916.\nin confinement as described without the knowledge of the Mexican\nauthorities, by whom at that time the reins of government were\nfirmly held ;\nand, moreover, that there could have been no\nmotive for kidnapping him. He also found the nurse, previously\nlost sight of, who had actually seen Conner die, and, in fine,\npractically set the whole question at rest.\nAs to Mrs. Piper, what apparently happened was that the\nenquiry set her subliminal imagination to work. She got some\nthings right according to the ideas of Mr. Dodge\u2014perhaps in\npart by thought-transference from him, and once started on the\nwrong line embroidered on it further. According to Mr. Philpott\nthere was at least one remarkable incident, which he attribi;tes\nto thought-transference. A certain landscape view as seen from\na particular identifiable spot at Puebla was described by the\ncontrols vividly and accurately. This was after the second return\nof Mr. Dodge, who had seen the view, and in his presence. The\ncorrespondence of the description with the original was verified\nby Mr. Philpott. Certainly, as related, this would seem to have\nbeen a remarkable instance of telepathy from the sitter. I do\nnot remember hearing from Hodgson that anything so striking\nhad occurred. Perhaps he had not heard of the impression it\nproduced on Mr. Philpott.\nMr. Philpott's story of his quest is well and interestingly told,\nand gives the impression of sincerity. His discussion of psychical\nresearch, however, is somewhat shallow, and combines a too\nready credulity with a want of understanding of the attitude\nof those engaged in work on the subject. In particular, I think\nhe misunderstands the attitude of Hodgson. This is not unnatural,\nfor Hodgson, who had a great dislike to anything concerning Mrs.\nPiper getting into the newspapers, and therefore disapproved\nof Mr. Philpott's mission, evidently avoided seeing him or giving\nhim a chance of sitting with Mrs. Piper before he went, and\nprobably did not readily accept his account of his quest after-\nwards. Prejudice thus apparently exhibited by Hodgson may\nwell have engendered prejudice on Mr. Philpott's side, and at\nany rate deprived him of the opportunity of judging Hodgson\nand his methods and beliefs at first hand. Mr. Philpott, I am\nglad to observe, implies that they made it up later, and in the\nend I do not think they substantially difi;ered about the case.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\fJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nINDEX TO VOL.
